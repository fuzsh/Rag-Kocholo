        "text": "Early Days in the Forest Service\n\nVolume 1\n\nWILLIAM W. MORRIS\n\nForest Assistant\n\nCoeur d'Alene, 1909-1914\n\nEXPERIENCES ON A NATIONAL FOREST\n\nBy William W. Morris\n\nI have always loved the woods. This love has doubtless come down to me from a line of ancestors who could build ships from timber they had hewn with their own hands, and others engaged in the sawmill business.\n\nFour years of sedentary work was enough to increase this affection for the great outdoors, so that I determined to make a study of the then comparatively new subject of forestry, hoping to make it eventually my profession. I soon found that in order to be a forester one must have a knowledge of many things, which apparently on the face of them did not pertain to forestry. For instance, it was necessary to have a considerable knowledge of the arts and sciences, and it was not until my third year at the large university, that any subject dealing directly with the subject of forestry was taught me. It was with a light heart that after five years of study at this university, I was able to pass successfully the Civil Service examination given by the Government for admission into the U. S. Forest Service.\n\nSoon after taking this examination I was summoned by wire to report at the District Office of the Forest Service at Missoula, Montana. I arrived at Missoula July 3, 1909. Met Mr. Silcox, Mr. Rutledge, Mr. E. E. Carter, Mr. Greeley and many others. From Missoula I was soon detailed to the town of Wallace, Idaho. To be frank about it, I had never heard of the town of Wallace before, and as the train puffed up the beautiful valley of the Bitterroot River, over the summit of the Bitterroots, which marks the Montana-Idaho divide, then glided rapidly down into the Coeur d'Alene Valley, I wondered many times what kind of a town it was going to be my lot to strike. I was very agreeably surprised, for as the train sped into the station I saw a unique little city, set like a tiny jewel in the heart of the mountains, where five canyons meet.\n\nIt seemed like a toy city as I obtained better views of it later on from the high surrounding hills, but it was clean and spotless, and very much up to date, with fine homes and fine people. The hills on all sides of the town, coming down to the very doorsteps in fact, were covered with a beautiful young growth of timber. I had very little difficulty in locating the office of the Forest Service, as one can walk the entire length of the city in a few minutes. Here I met my Supervisor, W. G. Weigle, under whom I worked for two years, and for whom I always had the greatest respect and regard.\n\nA few days after arriving I was sent out on my first trip on the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. At that time this forest comprised about a million and one-half acres, and included the land drained by the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene Rivers, in northern Idaho. As there were only a few rangers and forest officers on this forest at that time, it kept one constantly on the jump, attending to fires, timber sales, and other work that needed attention. Few were the trails in those days, and much of the forest was unknown. Most of the trips were taken on foot, with one's blankets and supplies in a large Duluth packsack carried on the back. A walk of twenty-five miles carrying from forty to eighty pounds was not uncommon and often the distance was even greater than this in a single day's trip.\n\nMy first trip on the forest was to look over some burned timber on the Little North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. A man had applied for this timber, as he thought it would still make good lumber. Our duty was to make a map of the area and an estimate of the amount, with recommendations as to the manner of cutting, and the proper price at which to sell it. From Wallace we went to Harrison by rail, down beautiful Coeur d'Alene Lake, to the town of the same name, which is ideally situated at the north end of the lake. From this point we made the walk into the river, the deputy supervisor, two rangers, and myself. At the river I saw for the first time beautiful stands of white pine timber, one of the most valuable timbers that the U. S. has produced. I soon learned that the main species growing on this forest were western white pine, Douglas fir, western larch or tamarack, western yellow pine, lowland fir, western hemlock and cedar, the order given showing about the relative importance. We were fortunate enough to find a settler's cabin the first night. The next day we went on up the river, located and mapped the burned timber. The following night we stayed at a cabin belonging to a small mining company. Holes in the ground and old mining prospects are common throughout this region. This particular mine or prospect had a good copper showing, and we explored it for a distance of about fifteen hundred feet, with the aid of a \"palouser.\" There are several things in this region called \"palousers.\" Later on I will mention the word again and mean something entirely different. In this case a \"palouser\" means simply a tin can with a hole cut into it, and a candle inserted in the hole, so that the lighted end is inside the can, and the wind will not blow it out. I had occasion to use these devices often.\n\nAt this mining cabin our host happened to be a man who had come in from the town of Wardner, Idaho, where the great Bunker Hill and Sullivan lead min is located, one of the largest in the world. He had come into the river to tell the man who was working the claim, where we were staying, that his brother had just been killed in the mine at Wardner. Thus I got my first idea of the dangers attending this rough mountain life, in the mines and logging camps.\n\nThe rest of the summer, which was in the year 1909, I had the good fortune to be assigned, on rough reconnaissance work, with an old lumber cruiser. In this manner I was able to get over a great deal of the forest, and become acquainted with the timber, and other conditions. At that time it was not known what areas were timbered, and what were burned or bare, so our methods on this reconnaissance were to make a map of the watershed of timber, that we were estimating, showing by suitable colors on the map, timbered, burned, and bare areas. Then we would go into areas of timber that were good averages of the whole, and made a careful estimate of a small plot. After determining the amount per acre, the total acreage of timbered country was obtained from the map, and a rough estimate of the timber made.\n\nI considered it lucky to get out with a man trained in the woods all his life, and the experience proved valuable later on. Most of the summer we spent in a little tent, or sometimes in the open, doing this sort of work. You may be sure it was all most interesting to me. The country was new and almost unexplored. Occasionally we would come to an old settler's cabin, and sleeping in one of these one night, I had my first experience with pack rats. The pack rat is a large mountain rat, so named because it has the habit of packing off to its nest almost everything that it sees. They seem to be particularly partial to all bright shiny objects, such as spoons, silver dollars, etc. The woodsmen regard them with more or less superstition, as they have a peculiar method of tapping in the night time, when one is trying to sleep, much in the manner of the Morse telegraph code. This they do with their back feet. I remember one old cabin where we slept one night a carpet had been hung out at the head of a bed built of logs. When we laid down in the bed our heads touched against this carpet. I remember waking up several times in the night, feeling a pack rat rubbing against my head, as it ran back and forth on the other side of the carpet. There had been some volunteer potatoes come up near this cabin, and that night the pack rats had been working diligently, and had cut all these potato stalks down, and placed them all in front of our cabin door, where we saw them the first thing in the morning on going to make our ablutions in the cold mountain stream flowing near my friend the cruiser remarked that he thought it was a \"whitecap\" warning to get out, which we did as our work at this place was completed.\n\nIt was my good fortune to spend a considerable part of the fall of that season, on stem analysis work. This is a detailed study of the growth of trees, and consists of a measurement of the diameter growth, usually at every sixteen foot section of the tree, for ten year periods, and other diameter and height measurements are also recorded. In this way the contents of the tree in board feet can be obtained for ten year periods, and from these figures yield tables, showing the average stand per acre at different ages are obtained. These yield tables are of great value in determining what any piece of land, not now timbered, might be expected to grow in any given period of time. This work was done along the line of the new Chicago Milwaukee and Puget Sound Railway, which in order to conform to a certain grade had been cut through the hills in a great loop just on the Idaho side of the divide between the two states.\n\nThe whole line at this place consisted of tunnels and large bridges over gulches. It was a great piece of engineering work. The longest tunnel was the Taft tunnel, named from the town of Taft on the Montana side. This tunnel was over seven thousand feet long. It was very interesting walking through it, especially when one met a train in the middle. On our own side of this tunnel there sprung up a new characteristic railroad town called Grand Forks. It was universally admitted that the town of Taft was the toughest town in the country, until Grand Forks came into being. This town quickly went into first place for that honor. Many times its inmates were arrested for selling liquor without a license on forest property, but each time, except the last, they escaped penalty, on the ground that they were on a mining claim. The last time they were tried however, they were fined, and made to leave the place within a short time.\n\nShortly after my work was completed in this locality, I was detailed to the Menominee Indian Reservation, in Wisconsin, marking timber to be cut for logging. On my return from this trip, about the first of February 1910, I found the town of Wallace buried under snow, figuratively speaking, with more coming almost every day. At this time I was initiated into work in the mountains in the winter time. If it was hard to carry a forty pound pack in the summer, it was doubly hard when one had to wade through five feet or more of snow.\n\nHowever after a little practice, I soon became adept with snowshoes. As there were several tracts waiting to be examined at the time, I was assigned to make these examinations and reports.\n\nThe Idaho woods in the winter are wonderful. In the month of February the snow fell quietly almost every day. Sometimes stumps and logs get covered to a height of six feet or more, as there is usually little wind, to blow the snow off. The great boughs of the spruce, hemlock, and cedar bend almost to the breaking point with their white load. The silence is awesome but inspiring. I often thought, as I worked in these snow clad regions how few people have the opportunity for the enjoyment of such absolute solitude and quiet as are afforded by these mountain fastnesses in the winter time. Frequently we saw the large round tracks of the mountain lion, or the smaller ones of the lynx, the dog like track of the coyote, the deep hoof like marks of the deer, and down by river streams the claw marks of the marten and mink. None of these animals will molest one unless they are cornered. The snow often came so wet that it would cause great branches to be broken off the trees. I remember one night a young fellow (Wilfred Willey) just graduated from Yale University and I had turned in early after a hard day's work. A wet snow had been falling heavily for some time. We were camped in a little log cabin, built by some prospector who evidently had an eye out for the timber, but it had been abandoned. I was dreaming peacefully when a great roar awakened me, and then all was silent. Thoughts of snow slides went into my head, but I was soon asleep again. In the morning we saw that a mighty branch of a giant old fir tree, standing near the cabin, had been broken off by the weight of the wet snow. The fact that the snow would pile up so high on stumps and logs, often caused us a great deal of annoyance if not of danger. The only means of crossing the small streams where we were working was over foot logs covered high with snow. One day, crossing on the top of one of these snow laden logs on snowshoes, the snow suddenly gave way, and I found myself holding wildly on to the footlog face upward, gradually slipping into the water. I called to my companion to come to my assistance, but before he could do so, I was forced to let go my hold, and found myself lying back down in the icy waters. Fortunately the stream at this point was not very deep, and the discomfiture of a cold bath in the winter time, several miles away from dry clothes, was the only bad result.\n\nThe supervisor had an application for a large body of timber on the drainage of the St. Joe River about this time and had been planning during the latter part of February to make an expedition to this area. The purpose of this was to get an estimate of the timber, and to make a map of the country, in order to obtain an idea as to the cost and feasibility of logging it. The trip involved a hard climb over a high divide, and our ranger in Wallace, who is by the way a direct descendent of Count Pulaske of Revolutionary fame, built a large toboggan to carry our equipment on this trip. Many were the speculations by the old timers, as to whether this toboggan would be a success in the mountains or not. One had never been used before, and we were all eager to give it a trial, when an event occurred that held us back for some time.\n\nTHE GREAT SNOWSLIDES\n\nIt had been snowing every day in Wallace for some time. On one Sunday about the last day of February 1910 it was raining for a change, but snowing in the canyon town of Burke and Mace about seven miles up the large canyon where there were two railroad lines connecting these towns with Wallace. The high hills and mountain peaks were covered with a mantle of snow many feet in depth. That night just before going to bed I was talking with an old resident, who had been in the country before Wallace was started. He remarked at the time how favorable the weather was for a snowslide. It only needed a little wind perhaps, or the movement of some animal on a high bare peak, to start a little snowball sliding, which would develop in its downward path into a mighty avalanche carrying everything before it, and dealing death and destruction in the valley below. That night I was awakened shortly after midnight by the sound of several locomotives giving four loud blasts in succession. Then I heard several people passing in the street; talking in excited tones. I could not sleep for some time, especially as the locomotives kept up their shrill blasts. I tried to convince myself that nothing was wrong, and finally fell asleep again. In the morning on going to the restaurant to get some breakfast, I learned that a great snowslide had almost swept the town of Mace out of existence a little after midnight, and that a second slide had just struck the town of Burke. It did not take me long to go to the office, where I obtained a camera, and, accompanied by another Forest Officer (Joe Halm), was soon en route for the scene of the disaster. The Burke canyon is only a few hundred feet wide. High mountain peaks were on either side, much of the timber having been burned off or removed several years before. On reaching Mace we found that the town had almost been buried under a great mass of snow that was as hard as ice from the impact when it struck, and people were walking on top of this. Remains of houses and furniture were scattered everywhere, and a train of freight cars had been half buried in one place.\n\nMany bodies had already been taken from the ruins, and I believe that in all about nineteen people perished in these two slides. The impact of the slide had been so great that the high school about five hundred feet away from where the slide struck had the windows broken, and the small growth on the opposite side of the canyon from which the slide had come had been bent over and covered with snow, as if struck by a hurricane, so great was the rush of air.\n\nThe slides had come from the top of what is known in the locality as Tiger Peak, high and bare, and it was not the first time that it had sent a great snow mass to the valley below. This mountain is largely undermined by some of the richest lead and silver mines in the country. The slides as is their custom had followed the draws, and those who had been unfortunate enough to locate at the mouth of these draws were first awakened by a great roar, only to be buried under tons of snow a few seconds later.\n\nThe prompt assistance of the miners from the mines at this place saved many lives. It was some time before we got over the effects of this calamity, and felt as if we cared to venture forth in the mountains.\n\nOUR TRIP WITH THE TOBOGGAN\n\nMarch of that year was a beautiful month. One perfect day followed another. Along about the first part of the month we started out on our trip to estimate and report on a large area of timber lying on Big Creek, tributary to the St. Joe River. Our route lay from Wallace up Placer Creek of the Coeur d'Alene over the divide to Big Creek on the St. Joe. It was a beautiful March morning when a party of six of us (Weigle, Gregory, Willey, Halm, Pulaski, Morris) started out with our toboggan. Ropes were attached from the front and two from either side. Several feet of snow lay on the level in Wallace, and grew deeper as we increased our elevation. It was easy work at the start, and we were all feeling our oats, and light hearted with the beautiful day, the crisp mountain air, and the ease with which our equipment was moving along on the toboggan. We felt that it was going to be a success. It was after leaving the road, however, and turning up the West Fork trail, that we began to experience trouble. Here the trail had been built in some parts on a thirty degree slope, and with about five feet of snow on the level no sign of it was visible. It was necessary for us to go ahead and break a level place in the snow for the toboggan to travel on. Moreover we were somewhat fearful of snow slides as a result of this, for the slopes above us were all bare of timber, and we had already passed over a large slide that had vent its fury on the few trees that had been in its path. These were strewn promiscuously in the gulch below. None of us felt that we would like to be substituted for one of these trees.\n\nBy night we had travelled about three miles. We sought shelter in a small cabin, where I taxed icy culinary ability by baking a loaf of baking powder bread. The roof of this cabin was covered with about six feet of snow. We saw several cabins that had been completely broken down by their weight of snow. The following day was when our hard work really began. Our trail now lay up a steep hogsback, which led to a large ridge running to the main divide. By hard work, which involved packing some of the things on our back, we succeeded finally in getting the toboggan to the main ridge. Before starting this climb, we took a drink of water in the creek, and filled a canteen which however did not go far among several perspiring men. Soon we began to suffer quite severely from thirst. Eating snow only aggravated the situation. The going was somewhat easier on the ridge, as it extended for a mile or more at an easy grade. We sat down in the snow at noon, and snatched a bit to eat, but without water our food stuck in our throats. Slowly and with increasing labor we continued on. About four o'clock we suddenly came to the divide, the highest point of our trip. The top was covered with an enormous snowdrift which ended in a sheer drop on our side of about ten feet.\n\nThere was no other way than to cut steps up this, and by putting a stout cruiser's stick deep into the snow on the top, we were enabled to pull ourselves up. We now saw that the usefulness of the toboggan had come to an end, and with great reluctance we hid it in some bushes near by, where it finally burned in the great fires that swept the country the following summer. We had left some of our things behind, and one of my companions (Wilfred Willey) and myself went back to get these, while Halm and Pulaski returned to Wallace. The things which we went back for were mostly blankets, and putting a large supply of these in our packsacks we started again for the summit. It was a wild scene that lay before us. Darkness was coming on and to add to our discomfiture, it began to snow, so hard at times that it was hard to see many feet in advance of us. The wind too was blowing a gale as we neared the exposed summit. At this point, the ridge narrowed to a sharp edge, with steep slopes on either side covered with frozen snow. The footing was difficult and my companion (Wilfred Willey) lost his snowshoe, which slid for about a hundred feet down the mountain side and fortunately stopped by striking a tree. He had to cut steps down to it, which took considerable time. We finally made our way to the summit up the steps cut in the frozen snow by our two companions in advance. It was quite dark now, but the ridge was level and the walking good. Weigle and Gregory had constructed a rough shelter in the snow in the most secluded place they could find. They had dug a hole in the snow, covered a portion of the top of it with boughs, from a nearby tree. After spreading a \"tarp\" on the snow under the boughs, we put the blankets we had brought on top, and then built a large fire in front. We would have been very comfortable, had we not suffered so from thirst. We ate our supper of boiled beef, bread and some preserves with great relish. We tried to melt some snow in the preserve can, but without success. We estimated that there were twenty or thirty feet of snow beneath us, and it made a soft and feathery couch. Shortly after turning in a heavy blizzard struck us, the wind howled, the air was thick with hard pellets of snow which came even through our roof of boughs. The storm stopped as quickly as it came upon us, the wind ceased, the stars came out, nature was at rest again, and I knew no more until morning.\n\nThe sight that greeted our eyes on arising was one that only a few people get a chance to behold. The sun was just appearing. The air was exceptionally clear, and the bare mountain sides glistened as if set with myriads of diamonds. Miles and miles of the rough mountain country lay before us, with shining snow clad peaks and ridges as far as the eye could see. Even the Cabinet range was visible in far away Montana. I did not wonder at the remarks that I had so often heard that if Idaho could be levelled off and pressed out it would make some state. I longed for a camera, but on a trip of this kind it is hard enough to pack necessities. That day we made our way down to Big Creek in the St. Joe watershed, where we were to do our work. Water never tasted better to me than that morning when we first struck a mountain stream. Weigle and Pulaski returned to Wallace, Gregory, Willey and I stayed to make the estimate.\n\nWe remained in this watershed almost two weeks, estimating the timber and making maps. Some of our trips were hard, but most of our work was enjoyable. I know at one time we were troubled with snow blindness, and used to rub our faces with the burnt bark of the red fir, which is quite corky. This apparently gave some relief, but we presented ridiculous appearances. I remember one evening a companion of mine and I had wandered on our snowshoes many miles from our cabin in our estimating work. We were in another fork of Big Creek at a place where in the following summer eighteen men, fire fighters, were to lose their lives in the great forest fire. We could not reach our camp that evening and were contemplating sleeping out in the snow when we came in sight of a neat little cabin. Nobody was at home and we took the liberty of staying for the night. We found flour and I made some cakes and tea, and altogether made out very well. The cabin was as neat as a pin. In one end was a crucifix and a folding bed. We were indeed fortunate to strike such a place in this wilderness. The next day we returned to our camp, and a few days later went down the creek to the St. Joe River, where we returned home by rail and boat to Wallace.\n\nTHE HEADWATERS OF THE COEUR D'ALENE\n\nAt the time of which I write the Forest Service had few trails on the Coeur d'Alene Forest, and many regions were not only inaccessible in case of fire, but almost unknown. One of the first things we wanted to know in order to make a working plan for the forest was how much timber we had, what areas were timbered or burned, and what areas might be profitably planted or restocked. A working plan is a detailed plan of running a forest. In the plan a certain amount of timber is allotted to be cut each year on a certain area, or during a certain period, so arranged that the forest will not be overcut. The plans also show the areas to be restocked, and the improvements to be made. In order therefore to get an idea of the timber located at the head of the Coeur d'Alene River I was detailed by my supervisor to take a party of three men, go up there and make a map of about a township of the timber, with a rough estimate. About the middle of May we started out. This party consisted of rangers George Hamilton and Allen, guard Millsap and myself.\n\nOur supplies were sent from Wallace to the town of Prichard, which is located on the river. At this point we took boats. These were long flat bottomed affairs, pointed at both ends so that they could be more easily poled, if the term \"easily\" can be used as applied to pole boating. To all those who have never poled a boat up a swiftly flowing river, I would say that it is not the easiest job in the world, and requires a great deal of skill and endurance, a fact which I soon learned. I had with me three rangers, one of whom had charge of the district which we expected to examine, and two sort of general men assigned to various parts of the forest as the occasion demanded. We finally reached what is known as the forks of the river, above which the two streams are known as the East Fork and the West Fork. From here our work was done, and we camped the greater part of the time at this place.\n\nIt took us three days to reach this place, a distance of about twenty five miles, for it was in May and the water was high, from the melting snow that even yet remained on some of the timbered areas. Often we were compelled to jump out of our boat, wade the river and tow the boat by a rope fastened to the bow. It was slow hard progress. However as we got near the head of the river the fishing became good, and a good mess of trout tasted fine and cheered our drooping spirits after a hard day's work wading the river.\n\nIsaac Walton himself probably never had the beautiful spots in which to fish, which this river afforded as it wound its sinuous way through the wilderness. Here it glided swiftly over a shallow bar, and was not over a foot in depth, again it would pass very slowly by a great rock cliff, where the water was deep, and dark, and where the big ones loved to play, and how savagely they would take hold of one's fly, as it alighted quietly in some likely spot, easily accessible to the poorest angler from the passing boat.\n\nWe stayed for several nights at a natural meadow near the \"Forks.\" Here a small cabin was located, and we had a stove on which to cook our trout, with all the comforts of home. The first night here we were awakened by the snorting of a deer in our meadow, who evidently suspected that someone was trespassing on his domain. In this little meadow grew the camas plant, the root of which is a bulb, and starchy and which the Indians of the West often use for making bread. We found some very good timber in this region especially in the river bottoms, but the slopes were mixed with a large percent of defective hemlock. In one place we came across a large white pine about five feet in diameter, and one hundred and seventy five feet tall, which had been cut down, and about sixteen feet of the tree near the butt had been used to make a dugout. Some trapper had evidently taken his skins out down the river. The rest of the tree was wasted, beautiful wood, which in this section of the country can hardly be bought at any price. At the \"Forks\" camp we had company - i.e. a great number of little crossbills, pretty little creatures of all colors, and with their bills crossed so that when they ate anything they had to bend their heads sidewise. These little fellows had evidently never seen a human being before, for they were exceedingly tame, and would eat out of one's hands before we left. On this trip, we saw lots of new country, and located a great deal of bare land which some day we hoped to restock. We also saw a number of peaks, which we climbed, commanding great views of the surrounding country, some of which are now lookout stations, connected directly to the office by telephone. We usually worked in twos, except where we took some careful strips, and calipered the timber on them, when all four of us worked together. In this way we obtained some careful estimates per acre on certain areas, and applied these estimates to corresponding areas on our maps, in this manner getting the total stand of timber.\n\nI had heard before starting on the trip that Halley's comet was to be visible in the northwest for a certain time in the evening, and so I attempted several times to locate it, but the mountains or the timber so completely shut off the view of the heavens that I was doomed to disappointment. We stayed up in the wilderness without seeing a soul until after Decoration Day. On the morning of that day we worked, but thinking that a rather unpatriotic thing to do all day, we devoted the afternoon to fishing, if not more patriotic at least a delightful change. As we expected to return to Wallace in a short time, we decided to let the office force have a taste of brook trout, which we had been enjoying so much. Accordingly we dammed up a little stream, a minute portion of the main river at the \"Forks,\" and converted it into a very small pond a few feet wide. Then we went fishing, and what fishing we had! One of the rangers caught sixteen out of one hole, and I got eight out of another. The largest one was about seventeen inches long. These fish we put into our fish pond, where they lived, and were in good shape a few days later. My rubber blanket served as a seine to catch them in, and it was only a short time before we had them cleaned, salted, and packed with ferns in one of our provision boxes. We had almost the limit allowed by law, and several residents of Wallace, as well as the members of the office force enjoyed a trout supper.\n\nThe return trip was worth all the hardships of going up. We glided by places in a few minutes that had caused us hours of toil on the upward journey. Swiftly we would shoot over narrow bars, where the water was bubbling and writhing, and where occasionally we could feel the canoe rub on some stone or hidden log, then into the deeper quieter waters, looking black and treacherous, with perpendicular rock cliffs overhead, and at these points we would almost stop. But we got through without a mishap, and were down to Prichard in less than a day, where we returned to Wallace by the one daily train.\n\nFrom this time on until about the middle of July I was kept constantly on the go both in and out of the office. About this time I had the pleasure of visiting one of the great copper mines above Wallace, with my brother, who had made me a short visit. There is only one large copper mine in the neighborhood of Wallace, the great mining industry being in lead. The copper is not native but is found in various forms. We first travelled by a car electrically propelled for what seemed to be miles into the solid rock, then were let down several hundred feet in a bucket. Here we saw the men in the stopes, where the ore is obtained, working machine drills into the ore bearing rock, preparatory to the insertion of a blast of giant powder. This is dangerous work, as large pieces of stone frequently fall from overhead, and blasts are discharged by accident. The man working here is never safe, though many of the old miners I have talked to like the work better than other occupations. It is like the sailor who believes himself safer on sea than on land. A few hours later we were both glad when we saw daylight ahead of us as we rapidly sped on our car from the bowels of the earth to the beautiful sunshine, with the songs of the birds and the colors of the flowers and sky, which would mean so much more to us, if we were to lose them.\n\nTHE GREAT FIRES OF 1910\n\nNever within the memory of all the old timers did the Coeur d'Alene experience such a dry spell as occurred during the summer of the year 1910. Even as early as April the south slopes were quickly relieved of their snow burdens, and became quite dry. A fire was reported to the office on one of these slopes the latter part of that month. A few scattering showers in May and June about completed the sum total of the rainfall for the summer.\n\nReturning from another hard trip up the Coeur d'Alene River by pole boat in early July, I was taking a somewhat needed rest in the office, by writing up reports, etc. when Professor Kirkwood from the University of Montana made us a visit. As he wanted to make a study of the flora found upon our forest, I was very much pleased when the supervisor asked me to accompany him on his trip, and show him some of our more accessible timbered areas. July 13, 1910 saw us climbing the top of Striped Peak, about five miles from the city of Wallace, and reached by what is known as the West Fork trail. It was a beautiful day, but quite hot and dry with a stiff southwest wind. We arrived at the top of Striped Peak, which has an elevation of over six thousand three hundred feet, about lunch time. We had hardly sat down on the top of the peak to eat our lunch when I noticed smoke in the southwest. I took a compass shot in the direction of this smoke and then sat down to finish our lunch. As we were eating smoke suddenly appeared in the southeast, and fanned by the gale that was blowing quickly developed into what looked to be a stiff fire. Looking carefully in the direction of the other fire we also detected smoke, a thin narrow band of it, in the southwest but nearer than the first one we had seen. This was too much. It was necessary to report these fires at once and postpone, for a time at least, our trip. Hastily taking a compass shot on the three fires and estimating their distance as near as possible, I plotted them approximately without the aid of a protractor, on my map, and we started on the return trip to Wallace.\n\nAt that time no telephones connected this peak with the office, as is now the case with all of the mountain peaks that command a good view of the country. Before descending we took a look at the fire in the southeast. It was coming our way rapidly, and although possibly twenty miles away, it seemed as if it might be at our mountain peak in a short time. Little did I think as we left that high point that day, a point commanding a view of timbered slopes and canyons, bare peaks and green ridges, stretching away as far as the eye could reach, that it would be my last view of this beautiful panorama of green clad hills. The next time I was to behold it again it was with a feeling of great sorrow, sorrow for a fallen race whose scattered and broken remains lay spread out before me. The greenness had vanished. The canyons and hillsides were covered with a twisted mass of broken blackened trees, in some places five trees deep. It reminded me of jackstraws more than anything else. Great pines almost two hundred feet long were there, broken, twisted and fallen, the product of hundreds of years of slow but sure accumulation of food from the earth and air. What a sad sight it all was for one who had viewed the same country from this spot only a few months before.\n\nWe reached the forest office in Wallace in the afternoon. The stenographer said that the supervisor had already gone out on a fire. The fires we had seen had all been reported, and action taken. From then on until about eleven o'clock that night, the telephone was going continually, either the same or other fires being reported from various sources. Thus the fires had caught us all at once, and from then on until the middle of September it was one continual fight, though at that time we did not know it was to be. The next day I was sent out to one of the fires that we had sighted the day before from Striped Peak. This fire was on the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene river about thirty two miles from Wallace by rail. Professor Kirkwood was to accompany me. I was to stay until the fire was under control, then go on up the river with Professor Kirkwood. It was thought it would probably take a day or two to control this fire. It took just fifty five days and nights. The one daily combination freight and passenger train took us up the river quite near the scene of the fire where the Graham Creek Ranger Station was, and is still located. A small stream emptied into the river at this point, and it was up this stream the fire was burning. With the ranger from the station we started for the scene immediately. A road led for about two miles up the canyon along this little stream. Three settlers had taken up claims in this canyon some time before. The fire originated probably from burning brush from the furthermost claim, about two to three miles up the stream. It had started the day before we arrived, and conditions were just right to give the fire a great start up the mountainside. At the first cabin about one mile up, some young ladies from Spokane had been visiting. Their suitcases full of clothing were still in the stream where they had thrown them the day before, in their hurry to leave the place. As it happened it was not until about fifteen days later that anybody on this little road would have been in any great peril. The fire was burning quite near the second cabin and that afternoon we confined our efforts to stopping it at that point, which we did temporarily. Only a few men were working, and we all had to turn to with axes and mattocks. Professor Kirkwood proved himself to be an expert with the mattock, as well as in the classification of plants. A camp down the river had promised to send up a big gang of men, but they did not arrive until the following day. When they finally came I divided them up into two groups, one going up to the head of the fire, another group working to head it off in some valuable timber on the slope just over the ridge from the second cabin. These fire lines eventually met. Most of the men were foreigners and not highly satisfactory. We had a crew of about sixty all told. In making a fire line axes and crosscut saws are first employed to clear away all windfall and dead stubs, and these are followed up by men with mattocks who clear a trail exposing the mineral soil, about three feet wide. Patrol men are sent back on this trail as it is increased in length, to keep sparks and fire brands from blowing over it, or to put out fires caused by these being blown over the line, before they have developed into a large fire. Usually these fire lines are constructed a little to the lee side of a ridge, as it offers a favorable place to fight a fire, and it will run down hill on the lee side much slower than it comes up on the other.\n\nEverything was going along favorably except the weather. It seemed as if it could not rain. Several times clouds appeared that under ordinary circumstances would have poured rain copiously, but not so this year. After getting a fire line around the fire on the east slope of the canyon, we tackled the west slope, where a fire had been burning lightly in some small timber. That day the wind came up strongly, and scattered fire everywhere. However we were enabled by working several nights to get a fire line up to the top of the divide, on the west side of the creek, so it was kept for the time being from going down towards the mouth. Many of the men had left or were unsatisfactory, so I went about the last part of July to Wallace to get hold of some more men. I returned with twenty-nine. Conditions were then bad in Wallace. The air filled with smoke and fires were raging everywhere in the mountains. Our supervisor was almost exhausted with the strenuous work, both night and day. I met a man on the train when going to Wallace, an old timer, with whom I conversed relative to the fires. He said \"We will be all right as long as we don't get one of those 'Palousers' lasting about three days, which would scatter our fires everywhere now that it is so dry.\" Now a \"Palouser\" this time referred to a gale of wind from the Palouse country which strikes the whole region occasionally. The Palouse country is famous for its wheat, and the wind picks up the fine red soil and carries it for miles, filling one's throat and nose and covering everything with a fine powder. Fortunately these are rare and the country is usually calm, with very few violent storms. But this year one of these was to come along with many other things. The wind is one of the chief factors in fire fighting. When the wind blows hard and other conditions are right, the fire leaps up into the crowns of the trees, and travels along at a great pace, by brands blowing ahead of it and starting new fires. When it is quiet one may work quite close to a fire, but let the wind blow, and it is necessary to keep a respectful distance. It is also well to get on a fire early in the morning for this is usually the coolest and quietest time of the day, and the dew has a tendency to check the fire.\n\nAt this time we had only one small fire that was not under control. This was burning in a small area of rather poor timber on the east side of Graham Creek but nearer its mouth than we had been before. But this fire was to be our downfall, for it was in an old slashing, and a wind came up strongly the day we attacked it, and soon it was leaping and rushing over our fire line in all directions, but mainly towards the mouth of the stream. We could do nothing with it. Bringing down the men we put forth all our endeavors keeping it on the east side of the stream. Here for the first time we had a chance to use water, its natural enemy. But it was no use. Looking up on the west slope we suddenly saw smoke, and in a short time this side was a roaring furnace, traveling rapidly down towards the mouth of the creek, and threatening to shut off our escape in this direction. Men worked like heroes that day. I remember one man a \"lumberjack\" who had come to the camp drunk. I had hesitated to employ him, but being short of men at the time took him. I will always remember how that man dashed into the fire with buckets of water or shovels of earth, as cool as a cucumber, doing everything that human power could do and much more than most human power. The men called him Patsy, and I will always be grateful to Patsy for his strenuous endeavors against such great odds, as well as to many other faithful ones. It was necessary for us to get out of the canyon now in a hurry, and running through some fire that was already before us we reached the railroad. At the mouth of the stream just before coming to the railroad track was a small schoolhouse (Graham Creek School near the Prichard Ranger Station).\n\nThe fire was there as quick as we were. As we lay down on the track exhausted I remember hearing the school bell give a final clang as it fell to the ground its supports being eaten away by the tongues of fire. As the fire came down the west side of the stream toward the mouth of the river the timber was uprooted at just about the time the flame struck it. The falling trees caused a continual roar, and in some places were thrown in rough whirls, resembling the work of a tornado. Arriving at the mouth of the stream, the fire jumped the railroad tracks and river, and started burning in a flat on the opposite side about an eighth of a mile from the mouth of the stream where we had heretofore confined it. On this flat was a cabin belonging to a logging camp, and in this cabin were several boxes of giant powder. This we buried in the river, so that no sparks could get at it.\n\nTaking a much needed rest that night, we began early the next morning to fight the fire on the flat. Had it gotten away from here the whole upper river would have been threatened. The fire jumped the main Coeur d'Alene River and threatened the Grizzlies. Fortunately we were able to get a fire line around it the first day. Once it jumped the fire line, and for a moment the upper river seemed doomed, but by quick work this danger was avoided. The next few days our efforts were confined to stopping the fire on the west side of the river slope. After building several miles of fire line, only to have the fire jump over it in spite of all efforts, we finally succeeded in running a fire line to the summit of the slope, taking advantage of a rock slide part of the way. Here we stopped it completely on the western front. The watershed in which we had been fighting the fire was now almost burned over. So far however we had confined this fire within it, with the exception of some small areas on the main river. It was away up at the head of this watershed on the east side that the danger now threatened, for the fire had jumped over our lines, and was threatening the large watershed of beautiful timber to the east. We established a camp on this high ridge, separating the two watersheds, and cut a fire line along it. This camp was not in a very desirable place as far as water and provisions were concerned, for everything had to be packed in with horses, and for a time it was necessary to carry the water on our backs with five gallon water bags that we had for that purpose. A logging camp was situated in the watershed below us, and possibly three miles away to the east, nearer the main Coeur d'Alene River. From here our supplies were packed by pack horses coming to camp every two or three days. It was necessary for us first to build a \"shotgun\" trail as they call a very rough trail in that country, and this was so steep in some parts it was hard for a pack horse to get over it, even with a moderate load.\n\nAbout this time a man appeared for work who said he had been a cook. We had been bothered a great deal heretofore by not being able to get a man who knew the art of cooking for a crew of men in the \"open.\" Formerly we had done a good deal of the cooking at the ranger station, and at one of the cabins in the watershed below. I determined therefore to give this man a try, and he proved to be a wonder, and soon had order out of former chaos. He had a place for everything, and built a fireplace with stone he found on the mountain top. He had the men line up for their meals, and dished it out to them in a lordly manner as they passed in review. He could turn out some dishes that would make some of our fine hotel chefs take notice, and with very little in the line of provisions or dishes to do it with and under the most trying circumstances.\n\nWe were situated on a bare ridge, with a lodgepole thicket a little way below us. The men built Indian \"tepees\" with this young lodgepole, and we looked for all the world like an Indian village stuck away up there on the top of a high ridge.\n\nThere were a great many bears on this ridge, attracted there probably by the huckleberries that grew in great profusion, and which sometimes stayed our thirst, when water was not obtainable. One of the boys in his spare moments made a bear trap of logs. This was made in the nature of a figure four, the bear having to crawl under a heavy log to get the bait. On eating this bait, stick holding the heavy log would release, and allow it to fall on the unfortunate bear. But we were destined not to have any bear meat, much as we wanted fresh meat, for although Mr. Bruin got intro the trap one time, he managed to pull himself out.\n\nOne time we had been out of bread for some days, and the packer had promised to relieve the situation on his next trip. Bread of some kind is essential to the happiness of camp life. We all were looking forward to the packer's coming. He finally arrived one day, and after unloading the faithful horses, a few of us who happened to be in camp exclaimed \"But where is the bread.\" The packer said he had brought about three dozen loaves, but that the pack horse carrying it had slipped off the trail on a steep rocky hillside, had rolled over a couple of times, and the bread had scattered in all directions. He had succeeded in getting the horses on the trail again, but he had not been able to pick up the bread, as some of the horses had continued on ahead, and he was afraid of losing them. Accordingly I threw my packsack over my shoulders and went down the trail in search of a few loaves. I found the point at which the horse had slipped off the rocky slope, and soon began to pick up scattered loaves. It reminded me of picking up manna in the wilderness, or stories I had read of breadfruit trees. The loaves were scattered over a distance of more than an eighth of a mile, as the hill was very steep. I had picked up possibly twenty loaves, and was about to leave when I decided I would climb a tree and take a careful look around. Something caught my eye a way down the hill. I went down to it, and there was one of the boxes that had been packed on the pack horse. All around this box were scattered loaves of bread, and I believe I must have picked up a dozen more at this place. This was quite a find, and I returned to camp with a bulging pack sack and rather proud of my ability to secure bread in the wilderness.\n\nThus passed the first stage of operations at this camp, days of most strenuous toil on the part of everyone, but days which I can now look back to with somewhat of a feeling of pleasure, for the fire at that time was under control, and the life in the camp went along smoothly. But this was the calm before the storm. It had been a fight against nature from the beginning, and so far it looked as if we were getting the best of it. But soon nature was to show us what she was capable of doing when in her rougher moods.\n\nIt was near the twentieth of August and our fires had been surrounded by well made fire lines and things looked fairly favorable. But it was extremely dry, so much so that the soil was like powder, and a spark dropped at any point would quickly start a conflagration.\n\nOn the afternoon of the nineteenth of August I walked down to the ranger station, to talk over the situation with Ranger Schneider. Our fires were smouldering, but I felt they were under control. The following morning the ranger and I started for the fire camp. The wind was fresh in the early morning and strengthening every minute. When we reached the camp it was blowing a gale. Our \"Palouser\" had arrived. With great rapidity the smouldering fires below began to gather headway, and in a few minutes had gone over our ridge below the camp with a mighty roar, and down into the watershed we had been working all the summer to protect. But it was necessary for us to get busy now to protect our camp and ourselves. We cleared a place on the ridge where we placed all the provisions. We made a fire line below in the lodgepole thicket, but while doing this the fire jumped up into the crowns of the trees, and the head axeman was almost suffocated. We had to abandon this fire line and confine our attention to work on the ridge above our camp, where the fire was threatening to come over.\n\nIt was getting late and I was strongly hoping the wind would die down with the coming of night as it so often does. But there was no let up this time. It was blowing about sixty miles an hour now from the southwest. Our work on the ridge above us was in vain, for with a rush the fire was upon us at this point, then over. No human means could stop it now. Over the ridge it went into our precious timber below. The work of the summer was undone, at least I thought so then. We were too in a somewhat serious predicament. Fire had gone over our ridge below us in the morning, and above us in the evening. Trees were falling and burning on these areas continually. Our food supply was covered with sand and dirt. The men were called in. We sat down and ate what we could.\n\nNever had any of us seen such a wild sight. In the direction of the city of Wallace great masses of smoke were blowing wildly up the valley of the South Fork. Southward toward the St. Joe River stood a great white cloud pillar, apparently still, looking like a great thundercap, or the steam cloud that attends the eruption of a volcano. Many of the men thought it was a cloud and predicted rain at last. Westward the sun was setting in a flying black mass, looking like a great red ball of fire. Our high ridge gave us a wonderful view. The weird scene greatly impressed them, and one could not help having the feeling of fear and awe which the scene produced, as if a great tragedy was about to happen. Many fire fighters from other parts spoke of this later. They said the very air was afire. And tragedy was taking place in all these regions.\n\nAt Wallace at this time women and children and the sick from the hospitals were crowding the cars to escape the wall of flame that rolled down the mountainside that same afternoon and burned almost a third of the town. Where the great white pillar of smoke hung townships of timber were being consumed, great trees were being uprooted and snapped in pieces by the thousands with a mighty roar that could be heard for miles, and many a brave fire fighter met his doom on that fateful day and the day following. In all, about eighty men perished in this great fire at our camp.\n\nThe wind continued to blow all night. Most of the men, dead tired, turned into their lodgepole shacks. The situation however looked too serious to make me think of sleep. At nine o'clock it was apparent that something must be done. The men were awakened, and each one told to take his blankets and other belongings, and start off down the ridge. Two of us buried all the tools we could find. Our provisions had already been put together in an open space.\n\nIt was rather dangerous work going through the fire in the dark on the ridge below, where trees were still burning and falling, from the fire that had passed over in the morning. The trail was completely obliterated by fallen trees, and in the darkness was hard to follow. We made it all right and after walking several miles, lay down on the ground and slept until morning. I was awakened by one of the night patrol men coming in. \"Say,\" he said, \"you ought to see our old camp there is nothing left of her.\" I went back to take a look. The lodgeshacks, provisions and all tools that had been left were completely gone, and the ridge was swept bare. A few tools had been left near the provisions, in the cleared open space, yet only the iron parts were left showing with what heat this fire had rushed over our camp.\n\nWe were indeed fortunate to have escaped so well. It was necessary that something be done at once. The men had had very little supper, no breakfast, and no dinner was in sight. They were worn out from overwork, and lack of water both for drinking and washing purposes. Sending some men down to the logging camp for provisions, I went to the ranger station to see what I could get and report the situation to the Wallace office, and try and get some more men to tackle the fire again. Supervisor Weigle answered my telephone call. He said \"The situation is serious. A great deal of Wallace has burned and our ranger here (Pulaski) has lost six men in a tunnel. I can't send any more men. You will have to do the best you can without them.\" I got several loaves of bread at the ranger station, and hastened back to camp. It was a dark day and the sun was hidden, as it was for many days following.\n\nWhen I arrived at camp, I found most of the men leaving. I was unable to make them stay by either persuasion or force. However some of the faithful few stuck, among whom was my cook fortunately. We made arrangements with the foreman of the logging camp to get a line around the lower part of the fire, which was now burning in the watershed where the logging was being done, and we attacked the fire at the top and finally connected up with their fire lines. A patrol was established on these new lines, which formed a circle four or five miles long, and on completion of their trip around the circle the patrol man would report at the camp. The wind continued to blow for four days, gradually slacking on the last day and getting colder, so that the fire went down greatly. It was traveling down hill, and protected from the wind, as well as being on the more moist eastern slope, so we soon had it under control again.\n\nThe last few days on the fire in camp on the high ridge I look back to with somewhat of a feeling of pleasure. The weather had changed. It was getting colder and a feeling of approaching autumn was in the air. Everybody seemed to feel that their hard work was nearly over, and their spirits rose accordingly. Around the campfire at night I had a chance to size up my crew. A number of men who had been with me all through the fire were there. One was a young Englishman who had fought in the Boer war. He could tell many exciting stories of his experiences, and also was quite a poet and singer. Often he held the attention of the whole camp as he recited bits of poetry of his own composition, or sang some old English airs. There were also two Montenegrins who were the best workers I had, and they had been with me from the first. They were very faithful and never seemed to get tired. One time one of these men was carrying water for the camp in two five gallon water bags. He had a hard climb up a steep trail, but there was not water enough for all the men to wash. \"That all right, I get some more\" he said, and though it was late and he had been working hard since early morning, back he went for more water. We also had two southern boys with us from South Carolina. They were a different type from most of the others, but good workers. They were out for a trip to get adventure and experience in the West, and I believe they went home satisfied.\n\nAnother young fellow who had been one of the foremen throughout the fire was with us (Guard Burk, later a ranger). He was the wag of the camp, and always making the men laugh with his jokes. I remember he said in regard to our first cook, \"He was so greasy that every morning he had to roll in the ashes of the fire to keep from sliding down the hill.\"\n\nOn the night of September fourth raindrops on our faces awakened us. First only a few fell, and then, increasing, it soon began to come down quite heavily. We lay there and enjoyed it. We were glad to get wet, for we knew our long fight was over. The next day the rain continued, so we broke up our camp, and I bid an affectionate farewell to the faithful crew, the men going on their various ways, most of them never to see each other again. I returned to Wallace, where the people were just recovering from the effects of the fire, which had burned a large part of the town. The hills surrounding the city, which formerly had been so green and beautiful, were now bare and black.\n\nOne of the first things that we found it necessary to do after the fire was to clear out our old trails Most of these were absolutely impassable, and not an easy matter. Gangs of men were out on this work all the fall. Great tree trunks were piled across the trails in twisted and broken tangles, often five trees high, and it was necessary to cut through all this with axe and saw. This work took much time and money.\n\nPLANTING WORK\n\nLate in the fall of 1910 the government sent to the Coeur d'Alene Forest about a ton and a half of walnut seed, red oak acorns, and hickory nuts. This seed was sent as an experiment to see if such deciduous trees would grow so far away from their eastern home, and in a country where their only neighbors would be mostly the conifers. It was a very interesting experiment, for there have been many conjectures, as to why the hardwood trees were not found to any extent in this mountain region of the west.\n\nAs it was too late in the season to plant the nut seed that fall, they were stored for the winter in a long trench, dug in the ground, where the nuts were laid several layers deep, covered over with plank, and then with earth, where they could keep cool and moist, but not rot. The following spring they were in fine shape for planting, the walnuts just beginning to sprout a little. They were planted in May in two large areas, covering altogether about ninety acres. A crew of fifteen or twenty men did the work. The nuts were planted four by four feet apart. The men had pointed sticks with a projecting iron piece near the pointed end, on which the foot was placed, to thrust the stick into the ground. The nuts were carried in bags hung around the neck. The head man or \"Head nut\" as he was nickname by the planters, obtained a straight line from a row of red flags, placed in line on long straight poles. The second man worked four feet from the first man, and a little in the rear of him. The third man worked in the same position from the second man, and so on down the line. When the head man came to a flag, he passed it down the line to the end man, who placed it in the ground four feet from the line he was planting. In this way the alignment was well kept, and the area necessary to plant any given amount of seed could be figured in advance.\n\nThe red oak and the walnut came up fairly well. It was strange a few years later to go there and see these little fellows growing so far away from their natural home, surrounded by strange neighbors. Especially in the fall were the red oak pretty, for they turned a brilliant red, and made themselves quite conspicuous. The cold nights of the Coeur d'Alene were apparently not the best thing for the black walnuts; nevertheless they grew fast in the summer, but many got winter killed. However the experiment is still going on and the final outcome will be interesting.\n\nAfter the fires much more attention was given to planting and restocking denuded areas. The tremendous loss through the non-use of vast areas of waste land began to make itself felt to some extent. In the fall of 1912 almost twenty four hundred acres on the Coeur d'Alene National Forest were seeded to white and yellow pine, the seeding being done with corn planters (the little red oak were so attractive that a potted one was soon seen in many of the Wallace homes). This area was rather inaccessible, and it was necessary to build three miles of trail over a high ridge to get to it. Many a farmer's boy has used a corn planter all day where the fields are level and free from obstructions, but it is quite another thing to work steadily all day long, climbing steep hills and rockslides, and jumping over windfalls, all the time trying to keep a straight line, and an even distance apart. A small strip of western yellow pine plants were planted, this strip running clear across the seeding area, including all slopes. This was done in order to get comparisons on planting and sowing, and comparisons on the rate of growth on various slopes. At this camp our supplies were first shipped by rail to the town of Prichard, Idaho from Wallace, a distance of about thirty-eight miles. From Prichard they were hauled by a wagon a distance of six miles up the Coeur d'Alene River, much of the road being in the river bottom, to the mouth of Lost Creek. From the mouth of Lost Creek, they were packed on horses, and taken about five miles over the temporary trail, which we had built. The difficulty of getting supplies to these inaccessible places is one of the chief factors for a logging company to consider, when undertaking a logging operation in these regions.\n\nThe area that we were attempting to restock was almost completely denuded of tree growth. Several fires had run over it and the last one in 1910 had almost cleaned it up. Hardly a seed tree was left which might in time restock the area. It was an ideal place for such work.\n\nOne night at this camp we had a very heavy windstorm. There were several burnt snags standing near our tents, and we were much afraid one of these might go over. These old snags are one of the most dangerous things with which a woodsman has to contend, and they are always careful to pitch their tents away from the reach of one. In our case we had chosen as clear a place as it was possible for us to find. On the ridge above us we could hear almost a continual roar, as tree after tree went over. Fortunately being between two ridges we were not exposed to the wind, and few trees near us went down. The only mishap we had was when a tent blew down in the middle of the night. Although this was a large tent and had quite a number of occupants all slept soundly until morning, in spite of the fact that the canvas was lying directly upon them. We had quite a character in that camp. He had been a circus performer, gave balloon ascensions, was a vaudeville actor and a singer, and could turn his hand to most anything. He used to get out in the evenings and in his old boots do stunts on the slack wire which he had found in camp, and strung up between two trees. One time he told me his greatest ambition was to invent a parachute, in which he could safely drop from an aeroplane.\n\nThe following year I read in a Spokane paper where a man of the same name, Francis Thayer, had attempted to drop from an aeroplane in a parachute near Seattle, and was drowned in Puget Sound. The wrist strap had broken or become released which attached him to the parachute.\n\nThe work on this area lasted about a month. The following spring a large area was planted on Placer Creek near Wallace. This was planted with western yellow pine, Douglas fir, and some western white pine. In order to get to it, so that our planting could be done in the month of May it was necessary to cut through a snowslide which completely blocked the road at one point. In all about five hundred thousand young trees, mostly two years old were planted at this place. This covered an area of approximately six hundred acres. The trees were sent to Wallace from the Savenac Nursery at Haugan, Montana, and from the Boulder Nursery at Helena, Montana. They came done up in bundles of one hundred each, all packed in wet moss, and placed in large strong boxes. Some of the fastest men on the work would plant as many as a thousand trees a day. Our camp at this place reminded me of a young array, for at one time over a hundred men were employed here. At this planting camp I suggested to Pulaski the value of a tool that a man could dig holes with and plant trees also. Pulaski produced one.\n\nPossibly it may be seen to some degree, from what has been said above, something of the nature of what the National Forests are endeavoring to accomplish, in selling their mature timber, in restocking their waste lands, and possibly above all things in giving these lands adequate fire protection. Experience along these lines has improved the methods used wonderfully and the Service is every day becoming more efficient.\n\nThe remainder of my work in this Service was of a somewhat similar nature to that already described. I had many other wonderful trips and wonderful views. I agree with most westerners that the mountains do have an inspiring and uplifting effect on those within their environs. In looking at them from some high divide, I have often thought how they typified all nature. There is the great lofty peak, from which radiate out in various directions great spurs, and in turn from these spurs come ridges, and from these ridges smaller ridges, and so on till they reach water level. Everything seems to be composed of smaller parts. The most powerful telescope cannot find the end of the universe, but constantly reveals new worlds and new suns; and the most powerful microscope cannot separate matter into its smallest units. Once it was the molecule; now it is the ion. The moons revolve around their planets, the planets around a central sun, and this whole system or universe is probably in turn influenced by a larger controlling body, around which it may be revolving. It is the theory of limits over again; on one side approaching zero, on the other side infinity. Thus, a great mountain peak, lifting its massive head above the clouds, covered with eternal snows and reigning supreme over all times and civilizations, may well typify the Infinite.\n\nForest Service cabin constructed by Rangers Wilkerson and Tuttle in June 1899 at Alta, Montana.
