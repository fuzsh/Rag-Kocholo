Sarac – DA writes that the “countdown in RS has started. Another 24 hours remain before HR Paddy Ashdown announces decision on the measures he intends to carry out due to this entity’s non-cooperation with the ICTY.” DA says that at this moment there are speculations in RS that there is a list with 15 officials HR would dismiss. Journalist also analyses warning of the 11 NGOs in RS to Ashdown that they would demand resignation of the Government and withdrawal of Serb representatives from BiH institutions if he introduces abolishes Ministries of Interior and Defence. Author says the role of these associations is to keep the RS institutions, which is united stance of both opposition and position, “thus demands for removal of the Government and extraordinary elections should… be seen as one of possible solutions to the current situation.” DA further writes that if Government resigns, it can perform its duties in the technical mandate and reminds that when Nikola Poplasen was removed Dodik stayed in the same mandate for next two years, adding it is not impossible for this Govt to the same and stay in the office until 2006. “In that case, removals of the individuals would be useless, there would be confusion and one would not know who is responsible for the cooperation with the ICTY.” In second case, DA says Cavic could decide to appoint opposition leader as Prime Minister designate to ensure parliamentary majority, which could prevent extraordinary elections.\n\nDnevni Avaz pg 5 ‘Ashdown announces sanctions for those responsible in RS tomorrow’ by M. Drinjakovic – Irena Guzelova, OHR Director of Communications, says that HR Paddy Ashdown will announce the beginning of the process which will keep going until the next NATO summit: “There were a number of speculations far from reality… Current cooperation with the ICTY is not even close to the one demanded from BiH… I cannot talk about individual measures that this process will include as they are still being finalized.” Guzelova also added that as for the police reform, message of the EU was clear: “authorities for the law enforcement to be transferred to the state level… BiH or RS authorities’ rejection to adopt these recommendations will block BiH progress towards European integrations.” Nezavisne Novine, pg. 3 ‘Stricter measures towards RS to follow tomorrow’ by S. G. also carried OHR Guzelova’s statement on the issue. When it comes to the police reform, stresses Guzelova, Ashdown doesn’t intend to interfere with the Feasibility Study, which also includes the police reform: “BiH has to meet that condition from the Feasibility Study on its own if it wants to get closer to EU.”\n\nSlobodna Dalmacija, pg 18 ‘Measures to be announced on Thursday’, by B.

There are two proposals: the first one includes 5 police regions, while the other one proposes police to be organized in 9 regions and Sarajevo, as a separate one, according to Zilic. Issue of police management has also not been solved. There are two proposals; the first one proposes a state director to be in charge with BiH police, while according to the second one that should be the task of a body comprising regional directors.

Does this mean that official Belgrade will be held responsible for what happens to the RS in future?”, High Representative Paddy Ashdown has stated: ‘The RS authorities are responsible for what happens in the RS. President Cavic for one has done much to change attitudes in the RS, and for the first time RS institutions recognize the need to meet international obligations. An example is the RS Government’s Srebrenica Commission Report. President Cavic has said that he doesn’t want the RS to be the roadblock on BiH’s path to Europe. The problem is that individuals and institutional structures in the RS that are doing just this. This situation cannot continue’.\n\nDnevni Avaz pg 2 ‘BiH Court must be allowed to try anyone’, Dnevni List, pg 2, mentioned on front ‘BiH Court must work without political interference’, by M. Batarello – The High Representative for BiH, Paddy Ashdown, replied to the open letter that the HDZ BiH addressed to the OHR, PIC member countries’ ambassadors and other representatives of the IC in BiH, in which the HDZ requested that the persecution of the elected Croats’ representatives be stopped (see OHR media Round Up, Dec 14, 2004). In his reply, the HR agreed with the HDZ’s claims that there was a need for building of democratic institutions in BiH, however HR Ashdown denied the HDZ’s claim that there were international forces in BiH that undermined state institutions and senior officials in BiH. Claiming that the biggest priority of the IC in BiH is to establish the rule of law, HR Ashdown says: “That’s why we have especially focused our efforts in the last two years on establishing of the BiH Court.

We have recognized achieving of such intentions at the green table through the clear scenario that has been going on, the scenario that does not include legally elected representatives of the Croat people at all levels of authority in BiH”.\n\nHerceg Bosna Radio, BHT, FTV, Oslobodjenje pg 3 ‘Ljubo Beslic appointed Mayor’, Dnevni Avaz pg 8, mentioned on cover, Nezavisne Novine, cover ‘Ljubo Beslic is the Mayor’ and pg. 6 ‘Beslic is the Mayor’ by V.

Stressing that the Council plays significant religious and also political role, Paravac said that the Presidency members wished to hear opinions of the representatives of religious communities on how to improve and activate the work of the Council.

Kristo, Nezavisne Novine, pg. 4 ‘17% VAT rate’ by M. Cubro, Glas Srpske, pg. 2 ‘Single rate was adopted’ not signed – The draft law on value added tax with a single rate of 17 per cent was passed by an absolute majority in the BiH House of Peoples on Tuesday. Since the BiH House of Representatives earlier adopted the law in different text foreseeing a differentiated VAT rate, a commission was established in an attempt to coordinate various texts of the lawl. Twelve out of the 13 House of Peoples representatives in attendance voted in favor of the law. The law was passed with the provisions which the sponsor of the law, the BiH Council of Ministers, had submitted to the BiH Parliamentary Assembly for adoption. The provisions refer to a single value added tax rate of 17 per cent and a zero rate for exports. The law envisages that value added tax become effective on 1 July next year and sets the threshold for the registration of companies and firms at KM 50,000. BiH CoM Chair Adnan Terzic addressed Tuesday deputies in the BiH Parliamentary House of Peoples in the course of a discussion on a draft law on value added tax (VAT). Terzic said the BiH Council of Ministers endorsed the draft law that provides for introduction of the VAT on 1 July 2005, with a single rate of 17 per cent, and a zero rate for exports. He added that accent in the public, as well as in the debate on the VAT in the BiH House of Representatives, had been put on the need to pass a law that would ensure a higher level of social welfare protection for all those categories of less well-off citizens that might be hit by possible increase in prices of basic provisions. In that sense, the state and entity prime ministers signed recently a statement citing they are ready to define, together with their respective governments, social welfare measures for the most endangered categories of population, that are due to take effect simultaneously with the VAT. Terzic assessed that different rates of the VAT were far more suitable to well-off citizens, since they had more buying power and spent more. “Also, different rates would also be good for smugglers, organized crime and expansion of grey economy,” said Terzic. According to Terzic, there are not guarantees that bread will not go more expensive even in case of the zero rate on basic provisions, and analyses pointed out there are no special causes for rise in prices even under the conditions set by the single VAT rate.\n\nFTV, Oslobodjenje pg 17, mentioned on cover ‘Coming to better businnes environment through lobbying’, Dnevni Avaz pg 15 ‘Employers took over Bulldozer Project’, Dnevni List, pg 9 ‘Domestic employers take over managing of Bulldozer’, by Erna Mackic, Slobodna Dalmacija, pg 16 ‘Bulldozer in Association of employers’, by B.

Mikerevic said that millions intended for RS citizens had ended in the private pockets or “were lost over incompetence of the management structures of “Srpske Sume” company”. He also assessed that the dealings cited in the report of international auditor but also previously in the report of RS Audit Office had greatly damaged the forestry status and contributed to weakening of the entire forestry sector in RS.,\n\nPDHR Hays said the Company “Srpske Sume” had been run as if it had been a private firm, stressing (according to NN and GS): “Unfavourable contracts were signed, expenses were exceeded, number of products were underestimated and reserves were not registered.

Kalamujic – Daily brings that, according to the audit report for 2004, BiH Presidency, with agreement of the BiH Council of Ministers, this years spent more than 100.000 KM from the budget reserves to compensate for the costs made previously. The report, says author, shows that Presidency was not able to make its financial dealings more serious following last year’s “catastrophic” findings. The majority of the money, 70.000 KM, was spent for a car, “Audi”, for Borislav Paravac, which was bought in 2003. Chair of the CoM, Adnan Terzic, says he was not too much worried with this sum of the money which CoM had to approve as the obligation was made earlier, but that CoM was facing difficulties paying out millions KM of costs for Old Bridge opening ceremony, Pope’s visit, Mostar investment conference, etc and adds Presidency should be concentrated to reformatory process in BiH and new ministries to be founded, not millions KM worth manifestations.\n\nSlobodna Dalmacija, pg 17, mentioned on front ‘Ashdown blackmailed with wartime connections with Karadzic?’, by Zlatko Tulic – Commenting on deals that Drazenko Mandic, Dragoslav Popovic and Aleksandar Sasa Mandic (son of Momcilo Mandic) have cut with the BiH Prosecution, the deals that are according to the author scandalously mild (between 15 and 20 months imprisonment), the author writes that many people inside and outside the BiH Court also believe that the deals are scandalous. Comparing the deals that other people have cut with the BiH Prosecution (Miroslav Prce who agreed to 5,5 years imprisonment), the author wonders whether the deal between the Prosecution and the above mentioned persons is aimed at protecting the High Representative for BiH, Paddy Ashdown, because of his “dishonest” works with Radovan Karadzic during the war. In that context, the author reminds of a recent statement by Momcilo Mandic, who stated that he was ready to talk about links between Karadzic and Ashdown only when his son got out of jail.\n\nNacional pg 12 ‘Paddy’s aggression against Republika Srpska’ by Dusan Maric – This is a part 2 of article firstly published on Tuesday, about the secret plan for abolishing of RS. According to this article, the third phase of measures of a secret Muslim police includes two feints against SFOR or international police, both of which would take part in the eastern part of RS, as close as to Serbian border, believed to be a hide-out place of Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. The aim of the feints would be to accuse Serbs for attacks.\n\nThe fourth and most extreme activity would include the repetition of Sarajevo Markale, most likely in Srebrenica, in front of the mosque.\n\nSource at the F BiH MoI claims that the Muslim political top almost unanimously supports the plan, with differentiated views when it should be carried out.\n\nAccording to inset, the same source claims that CIA has been familiarised with the plan from the very beginning through its moles at Muslim political and police top leadership."
