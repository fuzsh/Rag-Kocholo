This means that the search covers the following time periods for these content types:\n\nFor events, the search results are pre-filtered according to the date of the event from today until one year into the future.\n\nFor publications, the search results are pre-filtered according to the publication date from today until two years in the past.\n\nFor news, search results are pre-filtered by the publication date from today until one year in the past.\n\nUsing the \"Period\" filter, you can extend or reduce the search time accordingly at any time.\n\nYour search term is used to search the contents of the entire website - this includes all pages at kas.de as well as all pages of the numerous independent microsites of the Political Education Forums, foreign offices and other microsites. If you are interested, you can also limit your search to one of these microsites using the special filter \"target website\".\n\nIf the PDFs are available in a readable format, they will also be searched for your search term and offered to you as a document in the search results.\n\nPlease do not use more than five search terms at a time. To increase the performance of the search function, the maximum number of search terms has been limited to five terms.\n\nSearch syntax"
