        "text": "A graduate in Accounting and Finance from the Université de Sherbrooke, Mr. Bédard began his career at KPMG in 1975. He rose to become a senior auditor within three years while obtaining his CA and CMA designations. Subsequently he served as a Controller in the forest products sector before joining Saputo in 1984 where he progressed through the ranks to become its Vice-President Finance. In 1996, he assumed management of a regional trucking firm which eventually became TFI International.\n\nFrom the outset, Mr. Bédard introduced a bold strategic plan of expansion, based on specific criteria including profitability, market penetration and geographic expansion. He has built a strong management team and has empowered them to ensure the Corporate philosophy of decentralization.\n\nThrough a series of acquisitions and strategic investments across Canada and the U.S., Mr. Bédard has created a powerful, diversified trucking and logistics network. TFI International continually studies acquisition opportunities to further strengthen its network.\n\nThe creation of shareholder value is an on-going focus and is a key priority for Mr. Bédard.\n\nMr. Bédard’s community activities include participation in a range of humanitarian causes and support for foundations active in health and higher education. Mr. Bédard was awarded the title of Fellow by the Quebec FCPA Order in February 2011.\n\nDavid Saperstein joined TFI International in 2016 as Vice-President, Mergers & Acquisitions, a role in which he focused on M&A activities throughout the North American transportation industry and led the TFI International team in assessing and coordinating potential opportunities. He was named Chief Financial Officer of TFI International in 2019. David has spent over 15 years in investment banking at several firms in the United States and Europe including Goldman Sachs. He holds a Master in Business Administration degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in Economics and International Relations from Stanford University.\n\nKal Atwal joined TFI International in 2016 as Vice-President of Finance for TForce Logistics Canada and became president of TForce Logistics Canada in 2018. Kal was named Executive Vice-President of TFI International in 2019, responsible for the majority of TFI’s North American Logistics segment. Currently, he oversees the Canadian LTL divisions as well as the logistics operations of JHT in the United States. Prior to joining TFI, in addition to holding leadership roles at Progressive Waste Solutions and Day & Ross Transportation, a division of McCain Foods, Kal spent more than a decade at GE Capital. Kal is a CPA and holds a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting and Finance from the University of Greenwich in London, England.\n\nLarry Fuaco joined TFI International in 2004 as VP Operations with Trans4 Logistics, and previously had spent 10 years with TNT Logistics in various transportation leadership roles. In 2010 Larry assumed the role of Vice-President Operations for Canpar Express, transitioning to the newly acquired Loomis Express as Vice-President Operations in 2012, and in 2014 he became the Vice-President Operations for both Canpar Express and Loomis Express. In 2020, Larry was appointed President of TForce Integrated Solutions and in 2022 he took on the additional role of President of TForce Logistics Canada and AC Logistics Canada. Larry holds an Honors in Business Administration from Wilfrid Laurier University."
