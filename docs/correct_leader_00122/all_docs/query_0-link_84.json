        "text": "The workshop covered such topics as \"XXI century Management: to employ and / or to be employed\", \"Labour Market: Today and Tomorrow\", \"Technology of Employment\", \"Time Management\" and \"Leadership and Corporate Culture\". In addition to presentations by experts, the liveliest discussion on the topic was held with KAS-Martens Centre Discussion Club 2017 participants and guests.\n\nThe main part of the workshop was supplemented by presentation of Mrs. Viktoria Jancosekova, Manager of Presidentâ€™s office at Martens Centre (WMCES, Brussels, Belgium), who gave an overview of WMCES planned activities and also commented on the recent declaration of the EPP on Belarus adopted during the political assembly recently held in Copenhagen.\n\nThe seminar receives financial support from the European Parliament. Sole liability rests with the organizer, the European Parliament is not responsible for the activity."
