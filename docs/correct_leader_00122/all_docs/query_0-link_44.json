        "text": "For the « Wilfried Martens » building, which was meant to comply with the highest energy efficiency standards (BREEAM Excellent),\n\nFranki Foundations performed the laying of geothermal probes, anchored into the bedrock, and up to a depth of 240 meters, a feat never achieved before in the Belgian capital!\n\nIndeed, geothermal probes are usually laid in the first layers of the soil, and multiplied when more calories are needed. But in this case, the available land was restricted (3.000 m²), so the probes had to be laid deeper in order to cover the heating and cooling needs of the future building.\n\nThe geothermal system will ensure heating of the building in the winter and cooling in the summer, for the most efficient energy balance.\n\n\"This was not an easy project” says Project Manager Dimitri Timbremont.\n\n\"At this depth, we had no detailed plan of the soil. So the start-up was very challenging because we had to refine the drilling methods during the drilling self. And we regularly faced some surprises. Nevertheless, this site was very interesting for us and we have gained extra experience with geothermal drilling, which is an activity we want to expand as it is closely linked to our standard deep foundations works.”\n\nIn collaboration with its Swiss partner Augsburger, the Franki team has updated its drilling technique according to the nature of the underlying soil in order to successfully drill as deeply as necessary."
