Whatever it is you need, you can get in touch with us by email or phone, write to us or reach out on social media.\n\nThe EPP Group has various information offices across the European Union, which liaise closely with both the Members of the EPP Group and the national authorities in their local country. They share information on the Group's activities and inform the Group on any national issues that may impact its Members' activities."
