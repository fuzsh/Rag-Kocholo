Simmons says the words were followed by a plea. \"I don't want to go to Awilda Lopez was the mother whom Elisa did not call mommy. Awilda had her daughter every other weekend, and Elisa had returned from those visits bruised and shaken .\n\nThe child now was telling the caseworker that she wanted to suffer no more. The visits continued, and Elisa happened to be with her mother the day in May 1994 when the child's father succumbed to cancer. Awilda announced that she was keeping the child, and the months that followed demonstrated that even when backed by numerous reports of abuse, a child's plea can mean nothing to the agency that calls itself the Child Welfare Administration. Elisa was in her mother's custody Nov. 17 of last year, when they attended a birthday party in their building on Pike St .\n\nShe wore a white blouse and a black dress, and at one point a 9-year-old named Eric asked her to dance. In earlier times, Simmons had taught Elisa the merengue and the girl had danced with a joyful exuberance. She now only shuffled, as if the blasting music did not quite reach her. \"I tried to move, but she was dancing slow,\" Eric says. Still, Elisa retained a quality that had in earlier times enchanted Prince Michael of Greece .\n\nEric remained charmed enough to keep dancing, holding both her hands as they danced to song after song.

The girl's fingers were caught in the door, and Awilda took her into the bathroom to soak them in the sink. Eric says Awilda summoned him to join them. \"She said: 'Come over here. Apologize to the little Eric says .\n\nOn other occasions, Awilda is said to have called Elisa a \"little whore.\" Eric says that when he went into the bathroom Awilda seized his hand and attempted to make him molest her daughter. \"I was Eric says. Eric fled the room, and he later would say that he was too scared to say anything. Elisa also was silent and seemed in a daze as the music kept blasting and the party continued. \"I think she felt like a dream in the mind,\" Eric says .\n\nElisa sat on the sofa, and Eric says that a second shock of the night came when Awilda suddenly slapped the child. He says Elisa stayed silent, her head dropping, her lower lip protruding. \"I like she was going to cry sometime,\" Eric says. Elisa and Awilda then departed. The abuse continued, and officials at Elisa's new school did not fail to detect the signs .\n\nOn Dec. 19, a social worker from Public School 126 spoke to a deputy director of the CWA Manhattan field office. The CWA official is said to have deemed the case \"unreportable.\" By April of this year, matters had gotten so out of control that Awilda herself sought help from CWA. She was unable to get her caseworker and sought the help of Dr. Bart O'Connor of Project Chance .\n\nO'Connor rushed to the house and found that the child's bed had been burned bait SEE 15 DALY As PAGE 28 til ning ."
