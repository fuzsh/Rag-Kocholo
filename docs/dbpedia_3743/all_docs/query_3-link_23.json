But when anyone hears the Black Dahlia, there's a pretty good chance they know exactly who you're talking about. The Black Dahlia is the most infamous unsolved murder in US history. Even 74 years later, true crime aficionados all over are still intrigued by the Black Dahlia. On January 15, 1947, the bisected and horribly mutilated body of a young woman was discovered in a vacant lot in downtown Los Angeles. The victim was eventually identified as 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, better known as the Black Dahlia. What followed this gruesome discovery was decades of outrageous stories of Elizabeth's last days, tons of false confessors and even more suspects, ranging from relatively convincing to downright bonkers. Join Arielle and Amanda as they break down the facts of America's most notorious unsolved murder in part 2 of a 2 part series.\n\nWhen people hear the name Elizabeth Short, they may not immediately recognize it.

However, this would change for Thad after only living in Baraboo for two weeks. In early July of that year, Thad fell asleep on the couch of his family’s home. When he awoke, he realized he was not in his home and he was not familiar with who he was with. Instead, he was being carried on a dark country road. What Thad would endure next would be 43 hours of relentless torture at the hands of a sadist who was no stranger to hurting others. Join Arielle and Amanda as they dive into the details of the amazing story of how Thad Phillips survived his encounter with the Bonebreaker Killer.\n\nIn the mid and late 1950s, Dr. Harold Perelson was a brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon operating in Los Angeles, California. Dr. Perelson had what seemed like the perfect life: a successful medical practice, a huge, gorgeous home, a beautiful, loving wife named Lillian, and three amazing children, Judye, Joel and Debbie. But looks can be deceiving and behind closed doors, the Perelson family’s life was anything but perfect. The struggles of the Perelson family would be thrust into the light in the early morning hours of December 6, 1959, when Dr. Perelson carried out a plot to murder his wife and children. The years following the murders found the house as a macabre tourist attraction. Join Arielle and Amanda as they dissect the facts of this case and try to understand what caused a husband, father, and well-respected, successful doctor to do the unthinkable.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://medium.com/s/story/the-murder-house-8bea26f11e5b#.i0f0q1xki\n\nhttps://mylabucketlistdotcom.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/the-paranormal-house-in-los-feliz-bucket-list/\n\nhttps://strangeremains.com/2019/12/26/the-sinister-story-of-las-murder-mansion/\n\nhttps://www.laweekly.com/the-story-of-the-los-feliz-murder-mansion-and-its-paranormal-aftermath/\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-los-feliz-hill-murder-mystery-20090226-story.html\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/nn98xx/heres-what-its-like-to-sell-las-most-notorious-murder-house\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/4wbkw9/the-photographer-who-got-a-last-glimpse-at-the-creepy-glory-of-the-los-feliz-murder-mansion\n\nhttps://la.curbed.com/2016/4/4/11363474/los-feliz-murder-house-inside\n\nThe criminal justice system process is intended to protect the innocent, right the wrongs, and deter perpetrators from wrongdoing, but what happens when the judicial system that we rely on to serve justice and uphold the law fails?

Joel Michael Guy, Sr., and his wife, Lisa, were no different. In November 2016, the Guys gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving with their family in their Knoxville, Tennessee, home. This was going to be the Guys’ last holiday in their home. You see, the Guys had finally reached the point in their lives most every couple dreams about: retirement. The Guys had plans to move to the home where they were going to spend their “golden years” shortly after Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, the Guys’ plans would be shattered when they were brutally murdered and dismembered just days after the Thanksgiving celebration. Even worse than the brutality of this double murder was that the person behind these heinous acts was someone who was closest to the couple.

Authorities quickly realized they were dealing with a serial killer. Local officers were aware they were ill-equipped to handle a massive hunt for a serial killer, so they created a task force and called in the FBI as backup. This task force worked tirelessly until the murderer was brought to justice. They utilized many tactics including a “decoy” operation, surveillance of a suspect, suspect profiling, and much more. Join Arielle and Amanda as they discuss the circumstances surrounding the heinous crimes of a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n\nRinging in the New Year is usually all about closing out old chapters and beginning new ones on fresh, blank pages.

After recuperating, Linda found herself in the hospital yet again, just six months later. One year after her first hospital stay, Linda, a once healthy woman, unexpectedly died.

The Sheriff’s Office of the small town was ill equipped to handle a case of such magnitude and several investigative mistakes were made along the way.
