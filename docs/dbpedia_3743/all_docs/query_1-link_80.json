Little Ariel was born on the island of Oahu in the small township of Waimanalo, just outside of Honolulu, to parents Melanie Joseph and Adam Sellers. She and her siblings had been taken in by Child Protective Services due to her parent's issues with substance use, and in 2019, was placed in the home of Isaac and Lehua Kalua. In all, the Kalua's ended up with 4 of Melanie and Adam's children in total... which was a huge mistake. On September 23, 2021, Ariel was reported missing by her adoptive mother, however, things quickly didn't add up. After authorities spoke with Ariel's older sister, things began to look grim, and the police suspected foul play. As of the date of release in August of 2024, Ariel Sellers is STILL missing.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/melanie.josephsellers.9\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mommii.mellii.143\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MoMMiiMeLLii\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HGIH808\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2024/05/a-working-group-that-emerged-from-a-tragedy-sets-out-to-reform-child-welfare-services/\n\nhttps://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/01/06/hawaii-news/bail-denied-for-adoptive-father-in-murder-of-6-year-old-girl/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/hearing-to-unseal-adoption-foster-care-documents-in-isabella-kalua-case-set/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/isaac-kalua-felonies-filed-for-bankruptcy-ahead-of-adoption-2021-11#:~:text=Isaac%20Kalua%20%E2%80%94%20who%20was%20charged,for%20bankruptcy%20in%20June%202020&text=Isaac%20and%20Lehua%20Kalua%20were,death%20of%20their%20adopted%20daughter\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2023/08/state-failed-to-heed-warnings-of-waimanalo-girls-abuse-lawsuit-alleges/\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2023/08/a-hawaii-mother-haunted-by-the-brutal-killing-of-one-child-tries-to-hold-onto-another/\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-hawaii-girls-adoptive-parents-arrested-charged-murder/story?id=81108634\n\nhttps://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/11/23/hawaii-news/abuse-reported-years-before-isabella-kaluas-death/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/family-friends-waimanalo-community-hold-vigil-for-isabella-kalua-after-adoptive-parents-arrested-for-alleged-murder/?ipid=promo-link-block1\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/couple-charged-with-murdering-adopted-daughter-expected-in-court-as-waimanalo-memorial-for-ariel-grows/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/where-is-she-a-year-after-isabella-kaluas-disappearance/\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/beat/trial-of-couple-accused-of-killing-waimanalo-girl-is-postponed/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head over to Boulder, Colorado, to discuss the case of Jason Midyette, a two and a half month old baby boy who was born into a well to do local family. On February 23, 2006, Jason was rushed to his pediatrician, Dr. Jill Siegfried, after he was described as “out of it, lethargic, stiffening his arms and legs, moaning and just not feeling well.” After being transferred to Boulder Community Hospital Foothills, it was found that baby Jason had a skull fracture, mixed chronic and acute subdural hematomas, and a complete loss of gray-white interface involving the cerebrum. X-rays taken revealed a number of fractures in various stages of healing. These fractures included the left parietal skull, right clavicle, left forearm, corner fractures of both femurs, and fractures on both ends of the left tibia. Jason had a total of 30 broken bones to his body, in various stages of healing. The sweet little boy who should have lead a happy an healthy life, passed away on March 3, 2006.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/15086106/jason-jay-midyette\n\nhttps://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/File/Court_Probation/20th_Judicial_District/Cases_of_Interest/Midyette/07CR919.pdf\n\nhttps://www.coloradodaily.com/2009/07/30/coke-porn-and-abuse-at-midyette-trial/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/woman-convicted-in-death-of-son-will-leave-prison/\n\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/molly-midyette-sentenced-to-16-years-for-her-son-jasons-death-speaks-out-video-5905210\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/louisville-father-convicted-in-young-sons-death-moved-to-halfway-house/\n\nhttps://www.coloradodaily.com/2009/07/30/two-experts-cite-disease-in-midyette-babys-death/\n\nhttps://murderpedia.org/female.M/m/midyette-molly.htm\n\nhttps://www.9news.com/article/news/local/alex-midyette-arrested-after-bond-violation/73-339084101\n\nMissing episodes?\n\nClick here to refresh the feed.\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy travel to Idaho to tell the sad tale of Dawson McKinney, the most adorable little newborn baby whose life was cut short at just two months old at the hands of his mother, Danielle Radue.

week, Drewby and Yergy head to Iowa to discuss the case of Gracie Buss who fell victim to one of the most common monsters that we've seen on this show... Mom's new boyfriend. Gracie, her brother, and her mother - the barely literate Kristi Buss - lived in a duplex is Waterloo back in 2014, when Chad Allen Little came into the family's life. Around this same time, Gracie kept suffering injuries, which Chad attributed to seizures and \"falls down the stairs.\" In the early morning hours of May 30th, 2015, Gracie suffered another such mysterious injury. After several hours, she was rushed by ambulance to Covenant Medical Center. However, Gracie’s injuries were so extensive that he transferred her to the pediatric intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where she was placed on life support. Three days after she arrived at the ICU, Gracie was taken off life support and passed away. Her organs were donated to children in need.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/iowa/court-of-appeals/2021/19-1062.html\n\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/08/09/waterloo-kristi-amber-buss-pleads-guilty-sentenced-4-year-old-daughter-gracie-buss-may-2015-death/1973829001\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147422228/gracie-vernell-buss\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147422228/gracie_vernell-buss/photo\n\nhttps://www.news8000.com/news/crime/iowa-man-convicted-of-murder-in-death-of-4-year-old-girl/article_0675a174-3e80-56bf-b8a0-1abed18df67e.html\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-man-gets-life-for-killing-girlfriends-daughter-511475422.html\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KWWL7/posts/4-year-old-gracie-buss-was-found-unconscious-in-her-waterloo-home-in-may-2015-gr/10154960446531528/\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/gracie-buss\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-woman-pleads-guilty-in-4-year-old-daughters-death-531028091.html\n\nhttps://www.news8000.com/news/crime/trial-delayed-for-couple-charged-in-4-year-old-s-death/article_67b133a4-0910-5881-8d4a-a04bfa87b7eb.html\n\nhttps://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/04/waterloo-residents-raising-funds-for-young-girls-funeral/\n\nhttps://www.kcci.com/article/4-year-old-girl-found-unresponsive-has-now-died/6907887\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/chad-little-motions-for-new-trial/article_1c3bd846-9d60-5191-bf4a-3f3504391297.html\n\nhttps://www.nhregister.com/texas/article/Waterloo-man-charged-with-death-of-4-year-old-girl-10023548.php\n\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/06/18/waterloo-murder-trial-iowa-man-gets-life-killing-girlfriends-daughter/1491788001/\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/jury-selection-starts-for-trial-of-waterloo-man-accused-of-killing-4-year-old-gracie/article_fdc94513-1d5f-5781-8aec-1f5cd689c277.html\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/autopsy-photos-show-numerous-injuries-on-4-year-old-s-body-in-murder-trial/article_7f49fe3f-7122-50d7-af26-414bdaca632d.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AB2I9IYtmQ\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kristi.buss.98\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kristi.buss.3\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/chad.little.963\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-woman-pleads-guilty-in-4-year-old-daughters-death-531028091.html\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=815258638845452\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KWWL7/videos/815258638845452\n\nhttps://doc-search.iowa.gov/Offender/Search\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=744535471008484&set=a.744544754340889\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/vzjch9s\n\nhttps://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/04/waterloo-residents-raising-funds-for-young-girls-funeral/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to Columbus, Ohio to discuss a highly requested story, and that is the case of Darnell Taylor.

week, Drewby and Yergy follow a circus performer family across the United States and discuss the tragic case of Eduardo Posso, and adorable little boy who just wanted to juggle and be free. After essentially being kidnapped by his father and stepmother, Eduardo was taken across the country and made into the family scapegoat, with some of his siblings considering him to be \"not part of the family.\" In the end, Eduardo died from malnourishment and dehydration, and had lost 50% of his body weight. Only hair was present in his stomach at autopsy. He was also beaten with a metal bat, shocked with an electronic collar, shot with a staple gun, and chained up in the bathroom.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://thefuneralchapel.net/book-of-memories/3860815/Posso-Eduardo/obit.php?&printable=true\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/mother-of-boy-shackled-starved-in-monroe-county-said-she-knew-something-was-wrong-no-one-will-listen/\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/07/25/life-without-parole-sought-for-dad-stepmom-in-starving-death-of-12-year-old/46644245/\n\nhttps://www.fox13news.com/news/mourners-dont-let-abused-boys-death-be-in-vain.amp\n\nhttps://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/in-court-of-appeals/2153597.html\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/mother-of-boy-shackled-starved-in-monroe-county-said-she-knew-something-was-wrong-no-one-will-listen/amp/\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/manatee-county/could-eduardo-possos-horrific-death-have-been-prevented/amp/\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/video/news/crime/vigil-held-for-12-year-old-boy-restrained-with-shackles-and-a-dog-collar-in-motel-bathroom-before-he-died/67-775fa579-1b47-4740-a92c-c4c5387282d0\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=U5DaNqVzIKHgjelhjlyoqfi5Z8DGe5MAWOEzhuAYuRKIcdLT8_PAVo43RnHM6q2Q0\n\nhttps://amp.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article230991853.html https://casetext.com/case/posso-v-state-2/\n\nhttps://fb.watch/sUY3Q7sar2/?mibextid=KsPBc6 - WTHR interview\n\nhttps://thefuneralchapel.net/book-of-memories/3860815/Posso-Eduardo/\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/video/news/crime/vigil-held-for-12-year-old-boy-restrained-with-shackles-and-a-dog-collar-in-motel-bathroom-before-he-died/67-775fa579-1b47-4740-a92c-c4c5387282d0\n\nhttps://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/media-room/national-statistics-on-child-abuse/\n\nhttps://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/media-room/national-statistics-on-child-abuse/#:~:text=Child%20abuse%20is%20deadly.,compared%20to%20girls%20at%202.15\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/circus-parents-indiana-chain-son-selfie-starved\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7087223/amp/Boy-died-evil-parents-tied-bathtub-tortured-electric-shock-collar.html\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1011851\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_executed_in_Indiana#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2020%20people,with%20lethal%20injection%20in%201995\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/eduardo-luis\n\nhttps://cbs4indy.com/news/florida-investigators-say-they-found-no-signs-of-abuse-months-before-12-year-old-died-in-indiana/amp/\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2022/10/07/judge-gives-man-65-years-in-starvation-death-of-12-year-old-son/69545042007/\n\nhttps://fox59.com/indiana-news/father-pleads-guilty-to-murder-in-sons-beating-starvation-death-in-monroe-county/amp/\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/florida-investigators-say-they-found-no-signs-of-abuse-months-before-12-year-old-died-in-indiana/amp/\n\nhttps://indianapublicmedia.org/news/posso-sentenced-to-65-years-after-pleading-guilty-to-murder-of-12-year-old-son-in-2019.php\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=zwXyVGcWCaCNoKD5x7RXSU_cS4qf78ZgGdkOD9uu4s0lMYQ2iX8CUziLyecymlE50\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2022/10/07/judge-gives-man-65-years-in-starvation-death-of-12-year-old-son/69545042007/#:~:text=Posso%2C%2035%2C%20has%20been%20incarcerated,Walnut%20Street%20when%20Eduardo%20died\n\nhttps://www.mysuncoast.com/2019/05/30/manatee-county-sheriffs-office-releases-child-abuse-investigation-involving-year-old-boy-who-later-died-extreme-abuse/?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://www.wbiw.com/2022/07/21/indiana-court-of-appeals-denied-a-woman-a-lighter-sentence-for-the-murder-of-her-stepson/\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=pKCMQe-7smEffEpjXuqG0Eg9lREUFXv6lskxYtW-fO9O6WgE4pOm5SsR2vX2Ttc00\n\nhttps://eu.tmnews.com/story/news/2019/05/31/details-emerge-in-12-year-olds-starvation-death/117328246/\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/06/04/us/boy-starved-to-death\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzbYi7mn0z0\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile/100063561125871/search/?q=posso\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to both Midland, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada to discuss yet another case where methamphetamine and \"mom's new man\" are a lethal combination. Logan Cline was an adorable boy with his whole life ahead of him. That was until his mother, Stormy Johnson, got involved with Corey Allen Trumbull, a meth addict who was cruel to animals and obsessed with death. Not only did Corey get both Logan and his older sister, Lexi, hooked on the drug, but he started physically abusing Logan - an act which would lead to Logan's badly beaten body being abandoned in a an old car in Wichita Falls.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/7MwcgztTsfC3mkfw/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Dh4M8Uq2ffpYjKKU/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005166616651\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/M63icgLkWCTowygy/?mibextid=LQQJ4d https://www.facebook.com/share/cujJ1B3U1kKkXuCg/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/stormyljohnson\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Dx8kGwck7BhrMUu2/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/207744312/logan-cline\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z4MT-zNSQEM?feature=shared\n\nhttps://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2020/03/trumbullarrestreport_Redacted.pdf\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/jury-needed-only-15-minutes-to-convict-moms-avowed-white-supremacist-boyfriend-of-11-year-old-boys-heinous-torture-murder/amp/\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g56891-d277960-Reviews-Red_Roof_Inn_Wichita_Falls-Wichita_Falls_Texas.html\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/logan-cline039s-funeral-expenses\n\nhttps://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/news/local/2020/04/16/trumbull-indicted-capital-murder-death-logan-cline-11/5149998002/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/crime/crime-crime/accused-child-murderer-corey-trumbull-booked-on-3-million-bonds/amp/\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/corey-trumbull-appealing-capital-murder-conviction/vi-BB1jA8qZ\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/09/07/stormy-johnson-pleaded-guilty-sentenced-murder-logan-cline/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/testimony-begins-in-trumbulls-capital-murder-trial/amp/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/testimony-begins-in-trumbulls-capital-murder-trial/amp/\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/08/22/details-murder-revealed-during-corey-trumbull-murder-trial/\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/08/28/medical-examiner-takes-stand-trumbull-murder-trial/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to LaPorte, Indiana, to discuss the case of 4-year-old Judah Morgan, who was placed in a loving home, only to have that stripped away 18-months later. CPS took Judah from his foster parents, and placed him in the home of his biological parents, Mary Yoder and Alan Morgan. During this time, Judah was tied up with duct tape and thrown into the basement of the couple's squalid home, only to die from blunt force trauma due to all of the beatings he suffered at Alan's hands.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Aa8vWXLZd88U3bAF/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/263339215/judah-marshall-morgan\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/resources/pdf/2b9b99bf-ce2f-4d5a-8529-5083dfa0e15e-amendedjudahmorganlawsuit.pdf\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/unbelievable-judge-lashes-out-after-mother-said-she-missed-the-sweet-boy-she-helped-torture-and-beat-to-death/amp/\n\nhttps://gb.readly.com/magazines/pick-me-up/2024-03-14/65ec8eb427cff78b81cf208b\n\nhttps://www.tributebook.com/domains/9e84358d-f21f-4355-8b21-a2eb010b669d/obituaries/22691600/book?utm_source=www.lakeviewfhc.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=obit_event_view_book#\n\nhttps://www.youthservicebureau.com/programs\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/judah-morgan-laid-rest-child-abuse-murder-potty-training-judahs-law-father-mother-foster-parents-caregiver-child-care-department-services-dcs-hearings-wythogan-park-indiana\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/appeal-denied-father-murders-son-potty-training-judah-morgan-judahs-law-convicted-prison-sentence-upheld-child-abuse-laporte-county-indiana\n\nhttps://www.wndu.com/2022/11/29/laporte-man-sentenced-death-son/\n\nhttps://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/crime/northwest-indiana-man-sentenced-to-more-than-60-years-for-murder-of-4-year-old-son-judah-morgan\n\nhttps://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/crime/new-charges-filed-against-northwest-indiana-woman-accused-in-death-of-4-year-old-son\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/la-porte-county-man-charged-with-murder-in-4-year-old-sons-murder\n\nhttps://eu.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2024/05/09/indiana-dcs-child-services-red-flags-judah-morgan-laporte-county-child-abuse-torture-foster-home/73606219007/\n\nhttps://fultoncountypost.com/wroi-news/711123#gsc.tab=0\n\nhttps://www.wndu.com/2021/10/14/court-docs-show-history-child-abuse-laporte-co-homicide-case/?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3c_z4aThOQU?feature=shared\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/justiceforjudah\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/263339215/judah-marshall-morgan\n\nhttps://fultoncountypost.com/wroi-news/664385#gsc.tab=0\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/emiyoder\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to Florida once again to discuss the case of infamous family annihilator, Ronnie O'Neal. Once a community activist, Ronnie snapped after falling victim to a random drive by shooting. Although he was separated from his wife, Kenyatta, at the time, she welcomed him back into their home once he was released from the hospital as he had nowhere to go. The couple shared two children - Ron’ Niveya, who had cerebral palsy, and Ronnie IV, whom they called \"Little Ronnie.\" March 18th, 2018, several 911 calls were placed from the couple's suburban neighborhood - two of which were from Kenyatta and Ronnie. That evening, Ronnie shot his estranged wife and bludgeoned her to death with the gun in their neighbor's yard. He then went back into the home and hacked his wheelchair-bound daughter to death in front of his young son, who was hiding in the kitchen. He then turned his attention on Little Ronnie, stabbing him nearly to death before setting the house ablaze. There was just one problem with Ronnie's plan... his son lived to testify against him in court, where Ronnie gained notoriety for his courtroom antics.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/477664219/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/472520492/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/480133777/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/480133777/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/474956256/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/498849391/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/507852057/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://newspapers.com/image/577841195/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/697533550/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/737943548/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/740665508/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742337526/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742674595/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742980122/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0wNPsxlD0w\n\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2021/07/23/family-members-condemn-ronnie-oneal-as-he-gets-life-for-fatal-attack-on-family/\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/i-am-safe-i-am-loved-riverview-boy-stabbed-set-on-fire-adopted-by-detective-who-responded-to-double-murder/\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/florida/second-district-court-of-appeal/2023/21-2460.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0wNPsxlD0w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqOLoCwi6A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MmsTQNU_N8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE1ioxSGh0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXcLWHIsHsU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snSU49TM1OM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn7oT62kWlQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6yiy6i_Uzo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGPaC6qsqbk\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/228555724/ron'niveya-o'neil\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188794344/kenyatta_barron\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch?ref=search&v=1131601890811194&external_log_id=a7f0ed76-e137-4bf5-bf7a-0613a6b2e680&q=kenyata%20barron%20murder\n\nhttps://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/ronnie-oneal-found-guilty-of-murdering-his-girlfriend-9-year-old-daughter-in-2018\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/ronniveya-oneal\n\nhttps://theautismwars.blogspot.com/2021/06/autisticwhileblack-against-erasure-of.html\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/article/news/crime/psychologist-testifies-ronnie-oneal-trial/67-2adb32cd-7938-4097-b342-15e47602cda2\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/ronnie-oneal-murder-trial-detective-who-adopted-oneals-son-speaks-to-jurors/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opd23dTTQbI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGmGIa6yBI8\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vikingmindset11/video/7300367525240425771\n\nHappy 4th of July Week if you're living in the States.

Even more infuriating than the fact that this beautiful little girl was killed, is the fact that Demont was being paid by the state of Virginia to care for her - but he didn't. He did the exact opposite of that.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/kare-11-investigates-heavens-tragic-life-and-death/89-611352180\n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/norfolk/heaven-watkins-latoya-smith-sentencing/291-6ff0fe42-2331-4d58-9886-d7004cca287f\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ohqL3WsVGOg?list=PL63Lm4ZCdVCBOIToqZexHpMQL7MbE48L9\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yp0PD4CXg&list=PL63Lm4ZCdVCBOIToqZexHpMQL7MbE48L9&index=2\n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/video/news/local/13news-now-investigates/full-interview-sheronda-orridge-on-her-niece-heaven-watkins/291-8221111\n\nhttps://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/news/heavens-story-after-girls-death-her-child-abuse-case-is-prompting-nationwide-legislation\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/heaven-watkins\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/485\n\nhttps://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr485\n\nhttps://childwelfaremonitor.org/2018/11/27/why-america-needs-an-interstate-child-abuse-and-neglect-registry/\n\nhttps://wset.com/news/local/mother-fianc-charged-in-death-of-11-year-old-autistic-child-caused-abdomen-to-split\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/193395667/heaven-raola-watkins\n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/investigations/man-pleads-guilty-in-norfolk-child-abuse-death/291-a934951d-da32-4f72-ac16-9b908034afda\n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/13news-now-investigates/gov-northam-signs-heavens-bill-into-law/291-277a0507-c670-4b14-a2ed-9fc4e31795f8\n\nhttps://www.wtkr.com/2018/05/25/bond-hearing-scheduled-for-norfolk-mother-charged-with-murder-in-childs-death\n\nhttps://www.wtkr.com/2018/05/23/family-of-11-year-old-victim-speaks-out-as-they-plan-memorial-services-to-honor-the-child\n\nhttps://www.wtkr.com/2018/05/21/two-more-children-taken-from-norfolk-home-after-11-year-olds-death\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/episode-103-heaven-watkins-part-1/id1499010711?i=1000553419032\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head back to Albuquerque to discuss the case of Omaree Varela, a beautiful little boy who was abused by both his mother, Synthia Varela, and his stepfather, Steve Casaus - who was a violent criminal. Things came to a head on December 27th, 2013, when Synthia became so upset with Omaree that she literally kicked him to death. Much like many of the cases we've discussed on this channel, CPS and local authorities were very much involved in the family's life, and failed in their duty to protect Omaree.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/man-convicted-in-brutal-killing-of-9-year-old-boy-gets-20-years-less-in-prison/28918564\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/abqjournal/name/omaree-varela-obituary?id=38476994\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/omaree-varelas-stepfather-to-be-re-sentenced/\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/124680846/omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/horrible-crime-shook-city-state-including-victims-young-siblings/28753226\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-tragic-case-of-omaree_b_5534857\n\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/slain-childs-estate-blames-nm-caseworkers/\n\nhttps://www.cabq.gov/police/documents/childabusepreventiontaskforcereport.pdf\n\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-nmd-1_15-cv-01039/pdf/USCOURTS-nmd-1_15-cv-01039-0.pdf\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/214518720/Omaree-Autopsy-Report\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/stephen-casaus-sentenced-to-10-years-in-federal-prison/\n\nhttps://apnews.com/general-news-fc06c0248e444c268bd4e1b93e0749bc\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/omarees-mom-during-sentencing-i-love-my-kids/\n\nhttps://casetext.com/case/state-v-casaus-2\n\nhttps://www.petedinelli.com/2019/07/30/nine-year-old-omaree-varela-settlement-needs-to-be-made-public/\n\nhttps://www.pressreader.com/usa/albuquerque-journal/20150905/281522224857924\n\nhttps://www.kxan.com/news/woman-sentenced-to-40-years-for-kicking-9-year-old-son-to-death/\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/judge-omaree-varelas-mother-competent-to-stand-trial/\n\nhttps://www.robertorosalesphotgraphy.com/blog/2014/1/10/memorial-services-held-for-omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/timeline-of-the-omaree-varela-case/5008916\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/candelight-vigil-held-for-omaree-varela/5053387\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/speakforomaree/\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/prosecutors-evidence-shows-stephen-casaus-involved-in-omarees-death/\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/casaus-family-wrap/4452741\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvBxvWANUKc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvB2V6FOwCk\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2553953/Police-did-911-call-recorded-abuse-boy-9-later-died.html\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2617634/Terrible-toll-meth-mother-stomped-son-9-death.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzaf6fYo4is\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIomy4J3CLY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4to-bmzy-L0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FOJtKLJ1_4\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/steve-casaus-latest/4442601\n\nhttps://www.cd.nm.gov/offender-search\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy discuss the tragic case of 22-month-old Shaylyn Ammerman, a beautiful toddler who lived in a house with her extended family in Bloomington, Indiana.

Kyler Parker, an acquaintance of the Ammerman family, was arrested and soon confessed to raping and murdering the toddler before discarding her body in a wooded area.

Like many of the children that we've discussed on this channel, CPS failed to intervene when Nefertiti was singled out for abuse, and during the Spring of 2024, the little girl was found buried in a shallow grave in a wooded area near a baseball field.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/269129481/nefertiri_diamond-harris\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/niosha.smith.31\n\nhttps://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/syracuse-police-look-for-5-year-olds-body-in-woods-mother-accused-of-beating-her-to-death/\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/03/search-continues-for-body-of-5-year-old-syracuse-girl-mom-charged.html\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/crime/2024/03/why-didnt-school-contact-police-when-5-year-old-police-say-mom-killed-missed-3-months-of-school.html\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-woman-charged-5-year-old-daughters-fatal-beating\n\nhttps://cnycentral.com/news/local/what-onondaga-co-child-protective-services-knew-before-mother-allegedly-killed-5-year-old\n\nhttps://13wham.com/news/local/dead-5-year-olds-mother-lied-to-syracuse-school-about-where-she-was-for-months\n\nhttps://cnycentral.com/news/local/woman-arrested-concerning-disappearance-of-5-year-old-daughter-police-actively-searching\n\nhttps://cnycentral.com/news/local/5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-death-ruled-a-homicide-by-medical-examiners-office\n\nhttps://13wham.com/news/local/watch-live-officials-provide-update-on-search-for-body-of-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/03/a-message-for-neffy-found-buried-in-her-pajamas-this-was-not-your-fault-you-did-not-deserve-this.html\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/03/latasha-mott-singled-out-neffy-for-punishment-and-rage-that-ended-in-childs-death-friend-says.html?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://www.wrvo.org/safety-crime/2024-03-28/spd-continues-to-investigate-death-of-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris\n\nhttps://www.informnny.com/abc50-now/vigil-to-be-held-for-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-who-was-killed-by-her-mother/\n\nhttps://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/community-holds-vigil-for-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-who-was-killed-by-her-mother/\n\nhttps://13wham.com/news/local/mothers-boyfriend-charged-for-allegedly-helping-to-hide-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-body\n\nhttps://cnycentral.com/news/local/man-accused-of-helping-to-hide-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-body-out-of-jail\n\nhttps://www.cnycentral.com/news/local/remembering-nefertiti-harris-a-godmother-shares-about-her-life-beyond-tragic-loss\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/crime/2024/04/boyfriend-of-mother-accused-of-beating-her-daughter-to-death-taken-into-custody.html\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/news/2024/05/1-more-red-flag-dismissed-in-neffys-death-mom-also-vowed-to-kill-son-ima-beat-the-life-outta-him.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=syracuse_nf&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3ToOq8JPX0DNOSd3U-CqrZ28SyS8gCiGT0dglPSag19ORC5UN7Pla6vas_aem_ZmFrZWR1bW15MTZieXRlcw\n\nhttps://www.informnny.com/abc50-now/woman-accused-of-killing-5-year-old-daughter-deemed-mentally-competent-to-testify-moving-case-to-grand-jury/\n\nhttps://cnycentral.com/news/local/community-to-unite-at-funeral-service-for-5-year-old-nefertiti-harris-friday\n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/galleries/IXRAY3AKZ5AJ3GHXNVZWPIL3MY/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head out to Gary, Indiana, to discuss the case of Christian Choate, a beautiful little boy who was locked inside a dog crate by his father and stepfather, who also ordered his older sister to act as his jailer.

Medical Examiner Dr. Pramod Gumpeni found a total of 96 fractures on the infant. Her skull was fractured in two places. One of these head wounds was a fracture of the right parietal bone, which measured 8.5 centimeters – that’s a crack almost 3 and ½ inches long on a tiny newborn skull. Her ribs were broken in 71 places and the long bones in her arms and legs were broken in 23 places. Some of the rib fractures showed signs of healing. She was also bruised and battered. The doctor noted five distinct trauma areas on her right arm, six trauma areas to her left leg, and three trauma areas to her right leg. She had five bruises on her face, ten on her scalp and nine on her chest and belly. There were retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, and Dr. Gumpeni said her brain was markedly liquefied. She had old and fresh brain bleeds, as well as old and fresh areas of bleeding on her spinal cord, indicating multiple episodes of injury. The most severe bleed covered the surface of the right half of her brain and extended along the base of her brain on both sides. She had bled so much from her brain that the blood pooled there. Her cause of death was blunt force trauma of the head with subdural hemorrhage and skull fracture. A contributing factor was blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities. Her manner of death was homicide.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.mattkeyser.com/silent-cries\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/hard-to-imagine-a-more-innocent-victim-dad-admits-to-killing-newborn-daughter-who-suffered-at-least-70-to-80-total-fractures-due-to-beatings/\n\nhttps://cw39.com/news/local/da-father-gets-to-45-years-in-prison-for-killing-premature-baby/\n\nhttps://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/murder/texas-parents-charged-after-2-month-old-daughter-dies-with-96-fractures\n\nhttps://www.khou.com/article/news/mother-charged-in-10-week-olds-brutal-death-not-allowed-contact-with-two-other-children/285-5001389a-f434-48c8-8313-979037a0560a\n\nhttps://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/murder/texas-parents-charged-after-2-month-old-daughter-dies-with-96-fractures\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/APrayerForBrooklynn/photos/a.375677915907424/1517795085029029/?type=3&source=48&paipv=0&eav=Afbv0CSksoFxzPWiO56e6Kg-7VpRwsM0N6LBB1Jxg38-lUlT9ftfpfueezbIrXd89vQ&_rdr\n\nhttps://www.harriscountyda.com/houston_father_sentenced_to_45_years_in_prison_for_killing_premature_baby\n\nhttps://www.khou.com/article/news/local/its-heart-wrenching-allegedly-abused-babys-great-grandmother-never-got-to-meet-her/285-782f6b1c-a05c-47b8-84e6-bfc00395b59d\n\nhttps://cbsaustin.com/news/local/houston-infant-dies-with-90-plus-fractures-parents-charged\n\nhttps://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/baby-jazmine-robin-dies-with-more-than-96-fractures-parents-jason-robin-katharine-white-arrested\n\nhttps://www.click2houston.com/news/2019/09/05/charges-upgraded-for-couple-arrested-in-connection-with-death-of-10-week-old-daughter/\n\nhttps://www.click2houston.com/news/2019/06/26/parents-arrested-in-connection-with-10-week-old-daughters-death/\n\nhttps://abc11.com/jazmine-rose-robin-jason-jr-katharine-white-premature-baby-with-96-broken-bones/5362936/\n\nhttps://abc13.com/houston-baby-killed-jazmine-rose-death-jason-robin-sentenced-premature/13419128/\n\nhttps://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/das-office-10-week-old-baby-had-96-fractures-cracked-skull-when-she-died-parents-arrested/285-ce54f718-113e-42c1-ac2f-5fd386ecfb35\n\nhttps://www.kiiitv.com/article/news/crime/mother-charged-in-10-week-olds-brutal-death-appears-before-judge/285-5001389a-f434-48c8-8313-979037a0560a\n\nhttps://twitter.com/houstonpolice/status/1143567602620534784\n\nhttps://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2023/06/23/father-who-beat-his-baby-to-death-sentenced-to-45-years-in-prison-set-to-testify-against-babys-mother/\n\nhttps://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/tx-jazmine-robin-10-weeks-beaten-to-death-by-parents-houston-june-2019-arrests-1-guilty.454228/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ChGOcFtSyU&t=1833s\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/200488559/jazmine-rose-robin\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/200488559/jazmine_rose-robin/photo\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jason.robin.7359\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/katharine.white1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaAtqbIhHM\n\nhttps://inmate.tdcj.texas.gov/InmateSearch/start\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/katharine.white1\n\nShow more"
