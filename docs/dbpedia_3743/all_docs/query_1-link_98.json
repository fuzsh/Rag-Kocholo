        "text": "Finding its roots as early as 1865, the Jim Crow Era would end in being one of the most tragic and socially challenging eras. Following the ratification of the 13th Amendment leading up to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s, young Emmett Till was born amongst the chaos, in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nA breech baby, born July 25th, 1941, Emmett Louis Till was the happiest baby his mother, Mamie Till-Mosby, could have hoped for. Laid back as could be, all it took was baby Emmett to have a clean diaper and fresh bottle. With these two variables present, life was smooth sailing for the mom and son duo.\n\nIn Emmett’s early years, his grandmother (Mamie’s mother) would often watch him while his mother worked. Mamie worked evenings and nights at this time and could not be present as often as she would have liked. However, eventually Mamie would be able to afford their own apartment and the two would move to live on their own.\n\nEmmett did well in school. He excelled in art, science, and spelling. Science was his absolute best. Reverend Wheeler Parker, Emmett’s cousin, described the young boy as a jokester. In between his studies, Till was a class clown through and through. Another cousin, Simeon Wright, remembers Emmett as a boy with no sense of danger. A classic dare-devil. In an interview with a family friend, who did not want to be known, she stated that Emmett was an intelligent, sweet, and loving child. Minus the minor mischief kids would get into, Emmett was a well-rounded young man.\n\nMoses Wright, a preacher and Emmett’s great uncle, visited Chicago in the Spring of 1955 to attend a funeral. At the conclusion of the funeral proceedings, Wheeler Parker’s mother (Emmett’s aunt) had arranged for Wheeler to return to Mississippi with Moses to spend the summer vacation. Eager to join, Emmett asked and pleaded with his mother to allow him to go. After a back and forth debate between his mother and aunt, it was agreed to allow Emmett to go with Moses and Wheeler to Money, Mississippi for the summer.\n\nThe morning of departure, they were all to rendezvous at the 12th Street Train Station in Chicago. At the station, excited for the journey, Emmett took off running to catch up with his cousin and uncle.\n\nMamie says, “Wait a minute! You didn’t kiss me goodbye. How do I know I’ll ever see you again?”\n\n“Awhhh Momma!” Emmett responded as he turned back to kiss his mother goodbye. Emmett removed his wristwatch and handed it to Mamie saying, “Here take this, I won’t need it where I’m going.”\n\nMamie gladly took the watch and agreed to wear it. Wearing his father’s ring his mother had given him, Mamie says, “What about your daddy’s ring?”\n\n“I’m gonna keep it to show off to the fellas.” replied Emmett.\n\nMoses, Wheeler, and Emmett arrived in Money, Mississippi. Both boys were eager to have fun and play in the fields. Arriving during cotton picking season, Emmett and his friend, Roosevelt Crawford, were not old enough to work in the fields. In lieu, the two youths played in the fields around the farm.\n\nAugust 24th, 1955, Emmett, Wheeler, and a group of other boys headed into town to make a refreshment stop at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. Roy Bryant, the owner, was away working as a truck driver for extra income, leaving his wife, Carolyn Bryant to run the store. The family, poverty stricken, lived in the rear of the store with their two children.\n\nWheeler Parker made his purchase in the store and was exiting the building as Emmett Till was walking in. Going inside to purchase bubblegum, this is when Carolyn Bryant alleges that Emmett Till made lewd and vulgar statements towards her. There are many theories and accounts of what is claimed to have transpired inside the store between Emmett and Carolyn. However, an interview with an anonymous source stated, “Emmett went up to the register and asked for ten cents worth of bubblegum. Mrs.Bryant put out her hand and he dropped the money into her hand (showing an example of dropping the money). That was it, he walked out. Nothing else.”\n\nAs the group of boys gathered in the bus outside, Carolyn Bryant exited the store. As she walked towards her car, Emmett Till let out a loud wolf-whistle. The whistle that would change Emmett’s life and history. Many accounts claim the whistle may or may not have occurred. However, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Emmett’s cousin, was present and has verified the occurrence.\n\nEvery boy on the bus frightened, Emmett began to realize the harm his innocent whistle had caused. Emmett became encompassed with fear as someone on the street yelled, “She’s going for a gun!” as Carolyn Bryant speed walked towards her car. The bus drove off before she could reach her vehicle and Emmett begged his friends and cousins not to tell his great uncle Moses. All agreed to secrecy.\n\nAugust 27th, 1955, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, Roy’s half-brother, returned from truck driving. Catching wind, from a young local boy, of the situation that occurred between Emmett and Carolyn, both men were enraged. Rumor began to spread throughout town that the two men were going to get Emmett Till. Revenge was going to be executed. The anonymous witness interviewed stated, “I told Moses Wright to take the boys straight to the train station and send them back to Chicago, and he didn’t do it.”\n\nAugust 28th, 1955 Wheeler Parker heard a knock on the door, as he laid in bed. It was approximately 2:30 am. Parker said during an interview, “I heard men asking for the fat boy from Chicago. They wanted to talk to him.”\n\nMoses Wright was filmed describing his first hand account of the events that transpired that fateful night.\n\nAt 2:30 am, Moses heard a knock on the door. Approaching the door, he said, “Who is it?”\n\n“This is Mr.Bryant, I want to talk to the boy.” responded Roy Bryant. Moses Wright opened the door. There, in front of him, stood a man with a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other. It was Mr.Bryant and J.W. Milam. Wheeler, peeking his head out of his room, saw the man with a gun and flashlight, also.\n\n“Do you have two boys from Chicago?” Bryant asked.\n\n“Yes.” responded Moses.\n\n“I want that boy that did all that talk.” said Bryant. Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam entered Moses Wright’s house. They looked in the first room, and didn’t see Emmett. Peered into the second room, still no sign of Emmett. Approaching the third bedroom, there on the bed was 14 year old Emmett Till. Bryant and Milam grabbed Emmett and drug him along towards the front door.\n\nBoth men asked Emmett a battery of questions. Emmett answered them all, but the men grew infuriated as he failed to say “yes sir” or “no sir.” The men decided to take Emmett with them. Emmett’s great aunt, Elizabeth Wright, was petrified and offered the men money not to take the boy. It appeared J.W. Milam was calling the shots, and his mind was made up. Emmett Till would be going with them.\n\nBryant and Milam told Moses that they were going to take Emmett up the road, whip him, and turn him loose. Scare fear into him.\n\n“They marched him to the car and asked someone in there if this was the right boy.” stated Moses.\n\n“Yeah.” responded the passenger in the car, assumingly Mrs.Carolyn Bryant.\n\nThe men threw Emmett into the vehicle and drove off. As the truck drove through Money, they continued driving west across the Tallahatchie River. J.W. Milam knew the perfect place to take Emmett and frighten him. Milam knew of a bluff that overlooked the river. Located near Rosedale, the river bent smoothly around the bluff. If one would fall, it would be 100 feet down to the river’s surface and then 100 feet deep once you hit. The men planned to whip Emmett with the pistol, Milam’s Colt .45 from WWII, and shine the flashlight down the bluff to show Emmett what fall he could look forward to.\n\nThe group drove close to 75 miles without finding the bluff. The men desperate to find it, the truck came to a stop at an intersection just south of Rosedale. Milam turned south and headed towards the entrance of Beulah Lake off of Mississippi Route 1.\n\nGiving up on finding the bluff, they returned to J.W. ‘s house, located on Sheridan’s Plantation, at approximately 5 am. As the men removed Emmett from the truck and taunted him, he showed no fear. Emmett didn’t believe the men had the guts to actually kill him. Milam said in an interview with Look Magazine, “We were never able to scare him. They had just filled him so full of that poison that he was hopeless.”\n\nBryant and Milam directed Emmett towards a tool shed in the rear of the property. Both men began whipping the boy. Beginning with Milam and then Bryant jumping in. They repeatedly pistol whipped Emmett with the Colt .45.\n\nEmmett never screamed. Remaining tough he said, “You bastards, I’m not afraid of you. I’m as good as you are. I’ve had white women. My grandmother was a white woman!”\n\n“Well, what else could we do? He was hopeless. I’m no bully; I never hurt a n****r in my life. I like n*****s…in their place…I know how to work ’em. But I just decided it was time a few people got put on notice. As long as I live and can do anything about it, n*****s are gonna stay in their place. N*****s ain’t gonna vote where I live. If they did, they’d control the government. They ain’t gonna go to school with my kids. And when a n****r gets close to mentioning sex with a white woman, he’s tired o’ livin’. I’m likely to kill him. Me and my folks fought for this country, and we got some rights. I stood there in that shed and listened to that n****r throw that poison at me, and I just made up my mind. ‘Chicago boy,’ I said, ‘I’m tired of ’em sending your kind down here to stir up trouble. G*dd**n you, I’m going to make an example of you — just so everybody can know how me and my folks stand. ‘’’ said J.W. Milam.\n\nMilam knew his plan now. The men loaded Emmett back into the truck and headed west. The truck pulled into Progressive Ginning Company, 3.4 miles east of Boyle, Mississippi. Bryant and Milam directed Emmett to get out and load a broken, 74 pound, cotton gin fan into the back of the truck.\n\nFan loaded, they headed back towards Glendora and turned towards Swan Lake. Headed north across a bridge, Milam turned the truck down a dirt road that ran alongside the Tallahatchie River. After a couple miles, the men passed L.W. Boyce’s property. The truck reached a halt approximately thirty yards from the river’s steep embankment. They had arrived at an isolated location that J.W. had used for squirrel hunting in the past.\n\nEmmett was commanded to unload the cotton gin fan. He carried it to the river bank and stood silently.\n\n“Take off your clothes.” ordered Milam as he aimed the .45 at the boy. Emmett complied.\n\nJust shy of 7 am, Milam looks at Till and says, “You still as good as I am?”\n\n“Yeah.” Emmett replied.\n\n“You still had white women?” asked Milam.\n\n“Yeah.” Emmett replied once more.\n\nSuddenly, the pistol jumped in J.W. Milam’s hand. Emmett flinched and turned his head, only to catch a bullet in his right ear. He dropped to the ground, tragically deceased.\n\nBryant and Milam used barbed wire to attach the cotton gin fan around Emmett’s neck. After they were satisfied with the securement, they threw Emmett’s body and the fan into the twenty foot deep Tallahatchie River.\n\nLater that morning, Moses Wright knocked on John Crawford’s door. He explained to Crawford what happened at his house earlier that night, and told him that Emmett never returned home. The two headed into Money to look for the boy. Hopeful that he just got turned around after they whipped and scared him. Wright and Crawford were unsuccessful in finding Till.\n\nMoses returned home and contacted the Sheriff’s office to report Emmett missing. Sheriff Strider took the report.\n\nAugust 31st, 1955, three boys were fishing along the Tallahatchie, downstream from the devastating shooting, when they spotted something. It was the body of a boy. They contacted the police. The Sheriff went to Moses Wright’s house and told him that they found the body of a boy. Unsure of the identity, Moses was asked to come down to the river to see if it was the body of Emmett Till.\n\nThe body laid there, nude. So badly injured and damaged that they could not tell who he was. However, Moses looked at the hand and noticed the ring. It was Emmett’s father’s ring he had been wearing.\n\nMoses looked at the rest of Emmett’s body. He saw that his tongue and private parts were cut off. The young boy suffered a tragedy.\n\nMamie was notified of Emmet’s body being recovered at 9:30 am on the 31st. The Sheriff stated that they wanted an immediate burial of the body. Why? Due to the lynching being bad news for the state of Mississippi and would be worse for the people to see. The Sheriff scheduled a burial for the following morning.\n\nAs family in friends from Money, Mississippi and the surrounding area arrived at the church, the funeral began. After the message, they headed outside to the pre-dug hole. The basic pine box holding Emmett’s body was about to be lowered into the grave when the word came. Mamie had rallied Chicago Officials and demanded the return of Emmett Till’s body to be buried at home. She was successful.\n\nHowever, her success was short lived. As Emmett’s remains arrived in Chicago, Illinois, Mamie was told that the pine coffin could not be opened. Funeral Director A.A. Rayner was prohibited from opening the coffin (However, information could not be found leading to who prohibited the opening).\n\n“Do you have a hammer?” Mamie asked Rayner. She was determined. After paying for the return of her son’s body, if Rayner could not open the coffin, Mamie would. Rayner decided if Mamie was so determined to open it, he would go ahead and do it, regardless of being prohibited. His only request was for Mamie to return home and relax. Rayner would call her once the pine box was opened.\n\nLater that day, Mamie received the phone call from Rayner. She left her apartment and headed back towards her lifeless son’s body. Approximately 2–3 blocks away, she smelt an odor that was gut wrenching. As she got closer, Mamie realized the stench was coming from Emmett’s remains.\n\nMamie examined her son’s body. She described what she saw as follows: Emmett’s tongue was cut and lying on his chin. His right eyeball was out of the socket and laying midway down his cheek. The left eyeball was completely gone. The bridge of his nose looked like it had been chopped with a meat chopper. All but two teeth were missing. She looked at his ear and she saw a hole straight through Emmett’s head. She could see light shining through from the other side. Last, Mamie noticed what appeared to be an axe injury. The men took an axe and hit Emmett straight down the top of his head, splitting his face from the back of his head. The two monsters, Bryant and Milam, mutilated her son.\n\n“Open casket,” was Mamie’s decision for the funeral. A.A. Rayner asked Mamie if she wanted him to try and do something with Emmett to make him more presentable. She declined. She wanted the world to see what the two men had done to her son. Over a five day period, fifty thousand people would pass by Till’s body to pay respect.\n\nRoy Bryant and J.W. Milam were arrested for the kidnapping and murder of Emmett Louis Till.\n\nSeptember 20th, 1955 began the trial for the two men’s crimes. Mamie was present at the Sumner, Mississippi courthouse, despite the hate letters, dirty pictures, and bomb threats she had received over the weeks. The press found it ironic that the town’s slogan was, “A good place to raise a boy.” Considering, Emmett was only a boy when lynched.\n\nEvery lawyer in the area donated their services to the two defendants. A total of $10,000 was raised for their defense. Locals poured into the courthouse to show their support of Bryant and Milam as they remained disgusted with the Northerners visiting to support the prosecution.\n\nSheriff Strider ensured he did everything possible to keep the courthouse segregated. With an all white jury, he forced the blacks to sit in the back. Black Congressman Charles Diggs traveled from Detroit to view the proceedings. Strider refused to allow him into the courtroom until the judge overruled stating, “You cannot deny a U.S. Congressman access.”\n\nThe trial began and the prosecution had remarkable eyewitness testimony. Willie Reed was working at Sheridan’s Plantation when he saw a truck come driving up. He saw five people in the truck. Identified in the cab were J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant. Emmett Till was in the bed of the truck. After the truck parked and the people dispersed, Reed heard a strange noise. He began walking towards the tool shed and stopped at the well as the strange noises turned to clear whippings and cries. As he stood at the well, Milam walked by and asked if he heard anything. Willie declined.\n\nMoses Wright testified to the account at his house on August 28th. When asked if he knew who it was that took Emmett, Wright stood and pointed at Milam and Bryant, identifying them as the perpetrators. Mamie testified that the body removed from the Tallahatchie River was her son, Emmett Till.\n\nTestifying without the jury present, was Carolyn Bryant. Carolyn stated that Emmett attempted to purchase $0.02 worth of bubble gum and made “ugly remarks” towards her. She continued to testify that he afterwards whistled at her. Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam never took the stand to testify on their own behalf.\n\nRepresenting Bryant and Milam, defense attorney Sidney Carlton prepared to give his closing statement. Carlton told the all male, all white jury that if they failed to free Milam and Bryant, “Your ancestors will turn over in their grave, and I’m sure every last Anglo-Saxon one of you has the courage to free these men.”\n\nThe jury went into deliberation. After only 67 minutes, they returned with a verdict. The all-white jury found Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam not-guilty of the kidnapping and murder of Emmett Louis Till. Those not on the defense’s side were devastated. Two monsters got away. One juror made the ludicrous statement, “We wouldn’t have taken so long if we hadn’t stopped to drink pop.”\n\nIn 1956, both Bryant and Milam interviewed with Look Magazine. They provided a full confession to the kidnapping and murder, knowing that they could not be charged due to double jeopardy. Both men would never serve time for the heinous act. J.W. Milam died from bone cancer in 1981. Roy Bryant died from cancer in August 1994. Carolyn Bryant divorced Roy shortly after the court proceedings, becoming Carolyn Bryant Dunham. In her old age, she confessed to fabricating the claim of Emmett Till making verbal and physical advances towards her.\n\nMamie Till-Mosby would go on to graduate from Chicago Teachers College in 1960. From here, she proceeded to become an activist educating others of the atrocity that her son endured and the injustice served. She partook in a successful 40 year career as an activist until she passed away January 6th, 2003 at the age of 81.\n\nIn 2018, the FBI would receive orders to review unsolved cases from the civil rights era. With new information (not yet released) brought to light, the FBI reopened the murder investigation of Emmett Till. No further charges have been made to this date.\n\nThe United States may have exited the civil rights era, our country as a whole is still experiencing major racial tension. 67% of Americans feel race relations are negative. Of those, 70% believe they are getting worse. Americans are in need of change. A survey showed that most citizens believe the answer to solving the racial imbalance is by focusing on what all people have in common, not differences. After all, we are all people and we are all worthy of love.\n\nThe following sources were accessed to provide information on the horrific lynching of Emmett Louis Till:"
