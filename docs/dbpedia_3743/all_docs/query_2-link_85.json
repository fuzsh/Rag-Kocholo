        "text": "The FBI joined the search Tuesday for a woman charged with child endangerment stemming from the death of a 7-year-old boy in her care and mistreatment of two of his brothers.\n\nAuthorities have been flooded with tips that the boys' caretaker, Sherry L. Murphy, left New Jersey, Newark police Lt. Derek Glenn said.\n\n\"Some of the information suggests that she is possibly in a southern state with other family members,\" Glenn said. He declined to say which state.\n\nThe body of Faheem Williams was found Sunday in a plastic storage bin, a day after his brothers were found burned and starving in a locked basement room. An autopsy found he died of starvation and blunt force to the stomach, and his death was ruled a homicide.\n\nFurther tests will be done to determine if Faheem was already dead when Murphy moved to Newark from nearby Irvington about a month ago, Glenn said.\n\nMurphy, 41, of Newark, is a cousin of the boys' mother, Melinda Williams. Murphy began caring for the boys when their mother was jailed on assault charges in March.\n\nThe search for Murphy, a go-go dancer, was focused on bars in Newark and Irvington, Mayor Sharpe James said. She was nearly captured late Monday but police missed her by minutes, James said.\n\nAuthorities also used a cadaver dog to search Murphy's former home in Irvington, but would not say if they had found anything. They went there after the home's new owner reported a foul odor.\n\nMurphy, who has five children of her own — ages 8, 13, 14, 15 and 18 — had moved to the house a couple of months ago. While her own children did not live with her, investigators said the three boys stayed locked in a putrid basement room furnished only with a bed, a dresser and a light. They said Murphy fed them sporadically, sometimes only with a doughnut or candy.\n\nFaheem's twin, Raheem Williams, 7, and another brother, Tyrone, 4, were in fair condition at University Hospital in Newark, were they were being treated for starvation and dehydration\n\nMurphy's live-in boyfriend told police he found the boys while looking for work boots in the basement.\n\nPolice found Faheem's body in a plastic storage bin in the house Sunday, after Raheem told investigators he had a twin brother he had not seen for some time.\n\nThe boys' mother was struck by a car while en route to see them in Newark. She was told about them by a relative who had been called by the Division of Youth and Family Services, said Police Director Robert K. Rankin Jr.\n\nWilliams was in critical but stable condition Tuesday at a New York City hospital. She was released from jail in August, and told police she could not find Murphy or the children. It was unclear where Williams had been living since then, Rankin said.\n\nGov. James E. McGreevey demanded a report on the case from the Department of Youth and Family Services. McGreevey said someone complained to DYFS in October 2001 that the boys were being abused, but the case was closed in March 2002 without an onsite investigation.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services, which includes DYFS, said the agency had received 11 complaints involving the family dating back to 1992, some of them substantiated.\n\n\"There may have been major problems in the handling of the case\" and corrective measures would be taken, Human Services Commissioner Gwendolyn Harris said.\n\nIt is a shocking case but, as CBS News Correspondent Richard Schlesinger reports, to experts it is not unexpected.\n\n\"In child welfare systems across the country, they're operating on overload,\" says MaryLee Allen, of the Children's Defense Fund. \"Too many children, not enough resources, untrained staff.\n\nIn 2001, 5-year-old Rilya Wilson who was supposedly being supervised by the state of Florida vanished and has never been found. A few years before that, in New York, 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo was beaten to death by her mother after being returned home by the city's child welfare agency. It's a risk child care officials run every day(GRAPHIC) because right now there are about 550,000 children in foster care nationwide."
