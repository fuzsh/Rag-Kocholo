        "text": "Listen to my podcast\n\nThe tragic case of Elisa Izquierdo is an all-too-familiar tale of bureaucratic ineptitude. Her short life and brutal death was so horrendous that it reduced even the most hardened officers to tears. When she was just 6-years-old, she was murdered by her abusive mother.\n\nNew York’s Child Welfare Administration knew all about Elisa’s plight long before her death yet did nothing to save her. Young Elisa became a symbol of the failures in New York’s Child Welfare Administration and Family Court, whose bureaucracy allowed this little girl to slip right through the cracks and into her grave.\n\nSources:\n\n1.
