He first gained popularity as a member of the legendary rock band, The Beatles. His unique vocals, innovative songwriting, and dynamic stage presence played a pivotal role in propelling the group to unprecedented heights of fame during the 1960s. In addition to his work with The Beatles, Lennon's solo career was marked by several iconic albums that showcased his profound lyricism and evocative melodies. Lennon's early life was characterized by hardship and loss. His parents separated when he was young, and he was raised by his aunt after his mother's untimely death. Despite these challenges, Lennon found solace in music, and it was during his time at the Liverpool College of Art that he formed his first band, The Quarrymen, which would later evolve into The Beatles. After The Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a solo career, releasing critically acclaimed albums such as Imagine and Plastic Ono Band, which reflected his deep-seated concerns about social issues and his yearning for peace. Tragically, Lennon's life was cut short when he was murdered outside his New York City home on December 8, 1980. Despite his premature departure from the world, his legacy continues to resonate powerfully in contemporary music and culture. His timeless songs, known for their emotional depth and lyrical brilliance, are celebrated worldwide. John Lennon's life and career stand as a testament to the transformative power of music and the enduring appeal of his vision for a more peaceful world.\n\n01/24/1943\n\nBirthplace : Texas, USA, Dallas\n\nSharon Marie Tate Polanski (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers. She made her film debut in 1961 in Barabbas with Anthony Quinn. She was next seen in 1966 with the occult-themed Eye of the Devil. Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film, Valley of the Dolls, earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. Tate's last completed film, 12+1, was released posthumously in 1969.On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family in the home she shared with Polanski. At the time of her death, she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with the couple's son.\n\n02/12/1809\n\nBirthplace : Hodgenville, Kentucky, USA\n\nAbraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy. Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of seceding from the union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country. Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.\n\n05/21/1960\n\nBirthplace : St. Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nJeffrey Lionel Dahmer (; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster, was an American serial killer and sex offender who committed the rape, murder, and dismemberment of 17 men and boys from 1978 to 1991. Many of his later murders involved necrophilia, cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body parts—typically all or part of the skeleton.Although he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, and a psychotic disorder, Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial. He was convicted of 15 of the 16 murders he had committed in Wisconsin, and was sentenced to 15 terms of life imprisonment on February 15, 1992. He was later sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978. On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution.\n\n06/14/1928\n\nBirthplace : Rosario, Argentina\n\nErnesto \"Che\" Guevara, commonly known as el Che or simply Che, was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture. As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed. His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology. Later, in Mexico City, he met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht, Granma, with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.\n\n04/02/1939\n\nBirthplace : Washington, D.C., USA\n\nMarvin Gaye was born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939 in Washington D.C. The son of a church minister, his introduction to music occurred through singing gospel at his father's church, foreshadowing a career that would span multiple genres and decades. Despite his tumultuous childhood marked by physical abuse and strict religious upbringing, Gaye pursued his passion for music, eventually becoming one of the most influential musicians of his time. In the early 1960s, Gaye signed with Motown Records, where he achieved his initial success as a session drummer before transitioning into a solo career. His versatility was evident as he effortlessly moved between different musical styles such as R&B, soul, and pop. He was known for his smooth, soulful voice and his ability to convey deep emotion through his music. His hit singles like \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" established him as a leading artist in the Motown roster. Despite his commercial success, Gaye's life was filled with personal struggles, including drug addiction, financial difficulties, and troubled relationships. His music often reflected these struggles, most notably in his critically acclaimed 1971 album What's Going On, which tackled social issues like war, poverty, and racism. His later work continued to be innovative and influential, pushing the boundaries of contemporary R&B and soul. Tragically, Gaye's life was cut short when he was fatally shot by his father in 1984, but his legacy continues to inspire and influence musicians and fans alike."
