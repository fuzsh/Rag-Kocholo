Dakota had a very supportive and loving extended family and foster family. However, like many children that we cover on this show, DCFS just couldn't be bothered with keeping this sweet boy in a home where he was safe and loved. No. Instead, he was placed in the home of Jennifer Wilson, and her husband, Robert. On April 25th, 2024 - 20 days after being placed in the Wilson's Valparaiso home, Dakota tried to escape and ask for help. Enraged, Jennifer pinned the 91 pound boy beneath her 340 pound frame, where he slowly suffocated to death over the course of 7 minutes. After realizing what she had done, emergency services were contacted and Dakota was rushed to the hospital. Two days later, on April 27th, Dakota was taken off life support and was pronounced dead shortly after.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://fox59.com/indiana-news/questions-arise-following-death-of-10-year-old-indiana-boy-in-foster-care/\n\nhttps://www.fox32chicago.com/video/1449678\n\nhttps://wgntv.com/northwest-indiana/he-was-always-loved-former-foster-parent-seeks-answers-following-death-of-10-year-old-indiana-boy/\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/06/mourners-remember-dakota-levi-stevens-for-his-smile-creativity/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/regionnewssource/photos/porter-county-foster-mother-charged-in-death-of-10-year-old-dakota-levi-stevens-/1289490855529748/\n\nhttps://www.whitefuneralhomeofgriffith.com/obituary/Dakota-Stevens\n\nhttps://wgntv.com/northwest-indiana/brought-a-lot-of-joy-10-year-old-northwest-indiana-boys-death-ruled-homicide-while-in-foster-care/\n\nhttps://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2024/07/12/dakota-levi-stevens-foster-system-dcs-jennifer-wilson-child-abuse-indiana-valparaiso-porter-county/74386145007/\n\nhttps://www.chestertontribune.com/articles/community-mourns-for-dakota/\n\nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/dakota-levi-stephens-charges-filed-jennifer-wilson-northwest-indiana/3488021/\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13637963/Foster-child-dead-neighbor-adopt-abusive-mom.html\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/06/mourners-remember-dakota-levi-stevens-for-his-smile-creativity/\n\nhttps://abc7chicago.com/post/police-porter-county-issue-arrest-warrant-jennifer-wilson/15055414/\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/upgrade-jennifer-lee-wilson-s-charges-from-reckless-homicide-to-manslaughter-murder\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/liberty-township-subdivision-remembers-dakota-201500510.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK799Yx8GRiANYVKzmEwnS1SfWhvtTc_g0ld-TtPJN-mmQNw6JyIco02jLNplAmmp5z4fNJkBZIYXOpHnt0TBMf8Lb1ZXL3gAlkxyJKV-8BHcGX5ow46glP-V6NXaRp81wfhgcPCcyKdQDIloYzKD6dVO7wQUg0ysXdTHanEuxp7\n\nhttps://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/heartbreaking-last-words-boy-10-602526\n\nhttps://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/340lb-michigan-mom-crushed-foster-600513\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justicefordakotalevi\n\nhttps://www.geisenfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Dakota-Levi-Stevens?obId=31397283\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122142886676252480&set=a.122118927242252480\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/02/monday-candlelight-vigil-planned-to-remember-dakota-levi-stevens/\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/i-was-laying-on-him-and-he-was-acting-bad-foster-mom-killed-10-year-old-by-lying-on-him-for-several-minutes-police-say/\n\nhttps://regionnewssource.org/porter-county-foster-mother-charged-in-death-of-10-year-old-dakota-levi-stevens/\n\nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/nw-indiana-woman-accused-of-reckless-homicide-in-10-year-old-sons-death-arrested-in-michigan/3489297/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1291808625297971&id=100034065376827&set=a.962393871572783\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=949318550329359&set=a.543528914241660\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/518276322/videos/1003467258237223/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/39537128749151121\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/3953712874915112/user/518276322\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005218698316\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2455087624675170&set=pcb.2455090351341564\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/3953712874915112/user/100071474108079/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10162740094246323&set=gm.3973971096222623&idorvanity=3953712874915112\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy take a trip down to Enid, Oklahoma, to discuss the case of Caliyah Guyton, an adorable little 2-year-old girl whose death was completely preventable. In April of 2022, Caliyah and her parents, Chelsea Guyton and Cody Buckingham, took a trip to Enid to visit Cody's parents, who were staying in the Grand Prairie Hotel. What should have been a fun family vacation turned sour when Michael Geiger entered the picture. Michael was a lifelong criminal who had just gotten out of prison a month earlier, and was staying at the hotel as something of a handyman. He'd only been in Enid for a few hours. That evening, Cody and Chelsea joined Michael in his hotel room, where they hung out, had a few drinks, and smoked crystal meth. Michael told them he would pay the couple $5,000 if Chelsea would “spend 24 hours with him.” However, it wasn't really Chelsea that he'd set his sights on...\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/the-funeral-cost-of-baby-caliyah?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cp%20share-sheet&fbclid=IwAR0FjjuY6a6VzYx0wSQgkJDnk2TN_kIzPSkwmoEgs_fmUY_nBfHopd7-HPc\n\nhttps://kfor.com/news/local/court-documents-reveal-gruesome-details-in-toddlers-rape-murder-at-enid-hotel/\n\nhttps://www.newson6.com/story/63974ca273f25b7dd8f90a5d/enid-man-accused-of-killing-2yearold-arraigned\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/man-raped-and-murdered-2-year-old-girl-who-was-found-dead-in-pool-cops/\n\nhttps://www.newson6.com/story/626cb0bc8a2d90071ee53602/loved-ones-hold-memorial-for-2yearold-murder-victim\n\nhttps://www.enidnews.com/news/we-are-here-for-caliyah-vigil-held-for-2-year-old-girl-found-dead/article_4effc90e-c828-11ec-a9e7-83d7e237e9a2.html\n\nhttps://www.enidnews.com/news/enid-police-make-arrest-in-case-of-sexual-assault-murder-of-2-year-old-thursday/article_3e1c099c-c6eb-11ec-ad5d-5393172770fd.html\n\nhttps://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/NEW-INFORMATION-MICHAEL-GEIGER-NOV-16.pdf\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/5635848313096198/permalink/5639777926036570/\n\nhttps://www.enidnews.com/news/geiger-ruled-incompetent-in-rape-murder-of-toddler-in-2022/article_d7d36be4-7db4-11ee-8edb-1f34bc85e5bb.html\n\nhttps://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-enid-death-penalty-raping-killing-toddler/41986215\n\nhttps://www.enidnews.com/news/appeals-court-issues-stay-in-geiger-case/article_402b0a06-3ad7-11ee-8081-435098304fb0.html\n\nhttps://www.newson6.com/story/6397c58e8e99957d8f6c2203/man-accused-of-raping-killing-enid-2yearold-claims-innocence\n\nhttps://www.vanceairscoop.com/news/outside_the_gate/judge-seals-mental-evaluation-of-murder-suspect/article_a519cd87-2e4b-515d-8704-0cb48804994e.html\n\nhttps://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/caliyah-guyton-2-allegedly-raped-and-murdered-by-michael-scott-geiger-51-4-29-2022.622065/\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-aryan-brotherhood-member-accused-of-raping-2-year-old-and-throwing-her-into-motel-pool-to-die/\n\nhttps://www.americanhotels.co/us/enid/oyo-hotel-enid-ok-van-buren-2-mi-from-integris-bass-baptist-hea.html\n\nhttps://kfor.com/news/court-documents-suspect-in-enid-toddler-rape-and-murder-case-had-criminal-history-dating-back-at-least-thirty-years/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ekenneyk?comment_id=Y29tbWVudDoxMDE2MDIyOTc5MTUyODA2MF8zNDU2OTE2ODc1NDQyNjA%3D\n\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/5240856/girl-raped-murdered-hotel-body-pool-oklahoma/\n\nhttps://x.com/NoWonderland__/status/1520744902598053894/photo/2\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy are back in Ohio to discuss the case of a sweet little girl named Sereniti Jazzlyn-Sky Blankenship-Sutley, who fell victim to an all too common monster in the cases we cover... Mom's new man. On October 7, 2017, at 5:15 AM, Sereniti's mother, Kelsie, found the 13-month-old little girl unresponsive. She was rushed to the emergency room, where she was pronounced dead. Meanwhile, mom's new man, Joshua Gurto, fled Ohio, and lead police on an interstate manhunt. He was ultimately apprehended in Pennsylvania. While running Joshua's DNA, it was discovered that his profile was tied to an unsolved 2004 rape and burglary case, where the victim was beaten in the head with a hammer.\n\nSupport Our Patreon:

week, Drewby and Yergy travel to Hawai'i to discuss the case of Ariel Sellers, also known as Isabella Kalua in the media. Little Ariel was born on the island of Oahu in the small township of Waimanalo, just outside of Honolulu, to parents Melanie Joseph and Adam Sellers. She and her siblings had been taken in by Child Protective Services due to her parent's issues with substance use, and in 2019, was placed in the home of Isaac and Lehua Kalua. In all, the Kalua's ended up with 4 of Melanie and Adam's children in total... which was a huge mistake. On September 23, 2021, Ariel was reported missing by her adoptive mother, however, things quickly didn't add up. After authorities spoke with Ariel's older sister, things began to look grim, and the police suspected foul play. As of the date of release in August of 2024, Ariel Sellers is STILL missing.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/melanie.josephsellers.9\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mommii.mellii.143\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MoMMiiMeLLii\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HGIH808\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2024/05/a-working-group-that-emerged-from-a-tragedy-sets-out-to-reform-child-welfare-services/\n\nhttps://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/01/06/hawaii-news/bail-denied-for-adoptive-father-in-murder-of-6-year-old-girl/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/hearing-to-unseal-adoption-foster-care-documents-in-isabella-kalua-case-set/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/isaac-kalua-felonies-filed-for-bankruptcy-ahead-of-adoption-2021-11#:~:text=Isaac%20Kalua%20%E2%80%94%20who%20was%20charged,for%20bankruptcy%20in%20June%202020&text=Isaac%20and%20Lehua%20Kalua%20were,death%20of%20their%20adopted%20daughter\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2023/08/state-failed-to-heed-warnings-of-waimanalo-girls-abuse-lawsuit-alleges/\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/2023/08/a-hawaii-mother-haunted-by-the-brutal-killing-of-one-child-tries-to-hold-onto-another/\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-hawaii-girls-adoptive-parents-arrested-charged-murder/story?id=81108634\n\nhttps://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/11/23/hawaii-news/abuse-reported-years-before-isabella-kaluas-death/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/family-friends-waimanalo-community-hold-vigil-for-isabella-kalua-after-adoptive-parents-arrested-for-alleged-murder/?ipid=promo-link-block1\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/couple-charged-with-murdering-adopted-daughter-expected-in-court-as-waimanalo-memorial-for-ariel-grows/\n\nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/where-is-she-a-year-after-isabella-kaluas-disappearance/\n\nhttps://www.civilbeat.org/beat/trial-of-couple-accused-of-killing-waimanalo-girl-is-postponed/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head over to Boulder, Colorado, to discuss the case of Jason Midyette, a two and a half month old baby boy who was born into a well to do local family. On February 23, 2006, Jason was rushed to his pediatrician, Dr. Jill Siegfried, after he was described as “out of it, lethargic, stiffening his arms and legs, moaning and just not feeling well.” After being transferred to Boulder Community Hospital Foothills, it was found that baby Jason had a skull fracture, mixed chronic and acute subdural hematomas, and a complete loss of gray-white interface involving the cerebrum. X-rays taken revealed a number of fractures in various stages of healing.

Sweet Dawson, nicknamed \"Baby Dolphin\" by his family members, suffered a brain bleed, retinal hemorrhaging, and a skull fracture, before passing away in his father's arms in the pediatric intensive care unit at St. Luke’s Hospital in Boise.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group:

week, Drewby and Yergy head to Iowa to discuss the case of Gracie Buss who fell victim to one of the most common monsters that we've seen on this show... Mom's new boyfriend. Gracie, her brother, and her mother - the barely literate Kristi Buss - lived in a duplex is Waterloo back in 2014, when Chad Allen Little came into the family's life. Around this same time, Gracie kept suffering injuries, which Chad attributed to seizures and \"falls down the stairs.\" In the early morning hours of May 30th, 2015, Gracie suffered another such mysterious injury. After several hours, she was rushed by ambulance to Covenant Medical Center. However, Gracie’s injuries were so extensive that he transferred her to the pediatric intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where she was placed on life support. Three days after she arrived at the ICU, Gracie was taken off life support and passed away. Her organs were donated to children in need.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/iowa/court-of-appeals/2021/19-1062.html\n\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/08/09/waterloo-kristi-amber-buss-pleads-guilty-sentenced-4-year-old-daughter-gracie-buss-may-2015-death/1973829001\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147422228/gracie-vernell-buss\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147422228/gracie_vernell-buss/photo\n\nhttps://www.news8000.com/news/crime/iowa-man-convicted-of-murder-in-death-of-4-year-old-girl/article_0675a174-3e80-56bf-b8a0-1abed18df67e.html\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-man-gets-life-for-killing-girlfriends-daughter-511475422.html\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KWWL7/posts/4-year-old-gracie-buss-was-found-unconscious-in-her-waterloo-home-in-may-2015-gr/10154960446531528/\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/gracie-buss\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-woman-pleads-guilty-in-4-year-old-daughters-death-531028091.html\n\nhttps://www.news8000.com/news/crime/trial-delayed-for-couple-charged-in-4-year-old-s-death/article_67b133a4-0910-5881-8d4a-a04bfa87b7eb.html\n\nhttps://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/04/waterloo-residents-raising-funds-for-young-girls-funeral/\n\nhttps://www.kcci.com/article/4-year-old-girl-found-unresponsive-has-now-died/6907887\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/chad-little-motions-for-new-trial/article_1c3bd846-9d60-5191-bf4a-3f3504391297.html\n\nhttps://www.nhregister.com/texas/article/Waterloo-man-charged-with-death-of-4-year-old-girl-10023548.php\n\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/06/18/waterloo-murder-trial-iowa-man-gets-life-killing-girlfriends-daughter/1491788001/\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/jury-selection-starts-for-trial-of-waterloo-man-accused-of-killing-4-year-old-gracie/article_fdc94513-1d5f-5781-8aec-1f5cd689c277.html\n\nhttps://www.kwwl.com/news/autopsy-photos-show-numerous-injuries-on-4-year-old-s-body-in-murder-trial/article_7f49fe3f-7122-50d7-af26-414bdaca632d.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AB2I9IYtmQ\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kristi.buss.98\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kristi.buss.3\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/chad.little.963\n\nhttps://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Waterloo-woman-pleads-guilty-in-4-year-old-daughters-death-531028091.html\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=815258638845452\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KWWL7/videos/815258638845452\n\nhttps://doc-search.iowa.gov/Offender/Search\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=744535471008484&set=a.744544754340889\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/vzjch9s\n\nhttps://www.radioiowa.com/2015/06/04/waterloo-residents-raising-funds-for-young-girls-funeral/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to Columbus, Ohio to discuss a highly requested story, and that is the case of Darnell Taylor. Darnell was a sweet toddler who was placed in the care of his grandparents after his mother, Latitia Taylor, made concerning comments following a 911 call that made police believe that she was a danger to herself and her son. Soon, Darnell's grandparents found that taking care of a rambunctious little boy was just too much for them, and called on family friend, Pammy Maye, to look after the little boy. As the family had known Pammy for 42 year, they thought this was going to be a great fit for everyone... However, Darnell's placement with Pammy ended up having dire consequences...\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.wtap.com/video/2024/02/16/graphic-911-call-audio-pammy-mayes-husband-calling-police/\n\nhttps://www.news5cleveland.com/news/missing-persons/amber-alert-issued-after-foster-mom-alleged-she-harmed-her-5-year-old-foster-child\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/darnell-taylor-taken-children-services-after-2022-incident-biological-mom-report-shows/530-34b81806-3a7f-48b2-adb8-f6d3085db862\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/biological-family-of-darnell-taylor-worried-for-his-safety/530-e1855c89-eda5-422b-b4f6-cc9722a5154b\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio-amber-alert-darnell-taylor-pammy-maye/530-8b8c3da9-614c-4ab7-92ab-cd2d38743550\n\nhttps://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-amber-alert-darnell-taylor-columbus/95-e1cdaad8-0bf5-4adc-9f5c-6616f293e0f7\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/biological-family-of-darnell-taylor-worried-for-his-safety/530-e1855c89-eda5-422b-b4f6-cc9722a5154b\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaN1-d5nVLs\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/missing-ohio-5-year-darnell-taylor-found-dead/story?id=107288327\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=697287685909049\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/story/news/state/2024/02/15/darnell-taylor-kidnapping-what-we-know-about-the-missing-5-year-old/72612250007/\n\nhttps://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/boy-found-dead-after-amber-alert-was-removed-from-mothers-home-after-being-left-outside-alone/\n\nhttps://www.cleveland19.com/2024/02/16/timeline-what-we-know-after-columbus-amber-alert-ends-death-5-year-old/\n\nhttps://www.cleveland19.com/2024/02/18/find-justice-my-grandson-grandmother-murdered-5-year-old-wants-answers-after-amber-alert/\n\nhttps://www.29news.com/2024/02/18/you-threw-him-out-sewage-5-year-old-boy-allegedly-murdered-by-foster-mother/\n\nhttps://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/south-columbus-pays-tribute-memorial-grows-at-drain-site-where-young-boys-body-found\n\nhttps://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/gallery/south-columbus-pays-tribute-memorial-grows-at-drain-site-where-young-boys-body-found?photo=4\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2024/02/21/what-we-know-and-dont-know-darnell-taylor-pammy-maye-investigation-columbus-ohio-amber-alert/72640549007/\n\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/story/news/crime/2024/02/27/woman-accused-suffocating-5-year-old-amber-alert-pammy-maye-darnell-taylor-ohio-columbus/72761659007/\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/crime/columbus-woman-accused-killing-5-year-old-boy-extradited-to-franklin-county-jail/530-76587aca-e434-4f3b-ab0d-be7da9e30554\n\nhttps://www.insideedition.com/pammy-maye-foster-mom-murder-sewer-darnell-taylor\n\nhttps://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/ohio-state-highway-patrol-issues-amber-alert-darnell-taylor\n\nhttps://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/twins-who-grew-up-in-foster-system-walk-for-darnel-taylor/\n\nhttps://abc6onyourside.com/newsletter-daily/pammy-maye-accused-of-killing-5-year-old-darnell-taylor-indicted\n\nhttps://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/pammy-maye-arraigned-murder-charges-darnell-taylor-death-ohio-amber-alert/95-12c385ce-2975-4a29-828e-ec9814aadc8f\n\nhttps://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/ohio-amber-alert-pammy-maye-trial-darnell-taylor-columbus/95-b1e01853-f226-404f-afee-96dd02c8d991\n\nhttps://www.wlwt.com/article/bodycam-video-pammy-maye-columbus-amber-alert/60483922\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/crime/pammy-maye-confesses-killing-darnell-taylor-police-body-camera-video-shows/530-e4f98e4c-4003-45c9-9fb7-800689ac1802\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9L36Q9wvdU\n\nhttps://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2024/06/04/autopsy-columbus-ohio-darnell-taylor-amber-alert\n\nhttps://www.10tv.com/article/news/crime/how-mental-health-could-factor-into-case-against-pammy-maye/530-9dd95a20-f074-4faa-a169-493dc7634c9b\n\nhttps://m.cwcolumbus.com/news/local/pammy-maye-darnell-taylor-ohio-amber-alert-accused-killing-5-year-old-boy-legal-guardian-columbus-cleveland\n\nhttps://www.diehl-whittaker.com/obituaries/Darnell-Taylor?obId=30901056\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/264088683/darnell-taylor\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088178340905\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to Florida to discuss the case of Jordan Belliveau, and absolutely adorable little boy who was thriving in the case of his foster family.

week, Drewby and Yergy follow a circus performer family across the United States and discuss the tragic case of Eduardo Posso, and adorable little boy who just wanted to juggle and be free. After essentially being kidnapped by his father and stepmother, Eduardo was taken across the country and made into the family scapegoat, with some of his siblings considering him to be \"not part of the family.\" In the end, Eduardo died from malnourishment and dehydration, and had lost 50% of his body weight. Only hair was present in his stomach at autopsy. He was also beaten with a metal bat, shocked with an electronic collar, shot with a staple gun, and chained up in the bathroom.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://thefuneralchapel.net/book-of-memories/3860815/Posso-Eduardo/obit.php?&printable=true\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/mother-of-boy-shackled-starved-in-monroe-county-said-she-knew-something-was-wrong-no-one-will-listen/\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/07/25/life-without-parole-sought-for-dad-stepmom-in-starving-death-of-12-year-old/46644245/\n\nhttps://www.fox13news.com/news/mourners-dont-let-abused-boys-death-be-in-vain.amp\n\nhttps://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/in-court-of-appeals/2153597.html\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/mother-of-boy-shackled-starved-in-monroe-county-said-she-knew-something-was-wrong-no-one-will-listen/amp/\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/manatee-county/could-eduardo-possos-horrific-death-have-been-prevented/amp/\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/video/news/crime/vigil-held-for-12-year-old-boy-restrained-with-shackles-and-a-dog-collar-in-motel-bathroom-before-he-died/67-775fa579-1b47-4740-a92c-c4c5387282d0\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=U5DaNqVzIKHgjelhjlyoqfi5Z8DGe5MAWOEzhuAYuRKIcdLT8_PAVo43RnHM6q2Q0\n\nhttps://amp.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article230991853.html https://casetext.com/case/posso-v-state-2/\n\nhttps://fb.watch/sUY3Q7sar2/?mibextid=KsPBc6 - WTHR interview\n\nhttps://thefuneralchapel.net/book-of-memories/3860815/Posso-Eduardo/\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/video/news/crime/vigil-held-for-12-year-old-boy-restrained-with-shackles-and-a-dog-collar-in-motel-bathroom-before-he-died/67-775fa579-1b47-4740-a92c-c4c5387282d0\n\nhttps://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/media-room/national-statistics-on-child-abuse/\n\nhttps://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/media-room/national-statistics-on-child-abuse/#:~:text=Child%20abuse%20is%20deadly.,compared%20to%20girls%20at%202.15\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/circus-parents-indiana-chain-son-selfie-starved\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7087223/amp/Boy-died-evil-parents-tied-bathtub-tortured-electric-shock-collar.html\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1011851\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_executed_in_Indiana#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2020%20people,with%20lethal%20injection%20in%201995\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/eduardo-luis\n\nhttps://cbs4indy.com/news/florida-investigators-say-they-found-no-signs-of-abuse-months-before-12-year-old-died-in-indiana/amp/\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2022/10/07/judge-gives-man-65-years-in-starvation-death-of-12-year-old-son/69545042007/\n\nhttps://fox59.com/indiana-news/father-pleads-guilty-to-murder-in-sons-beating-starvation-death-in-monroe-county/amp/\n\nhttps://fox59.com/news/florida-investigators-say-they-found-no-signs-of-abuse-months-before-12-year-old-died-in-indiana/amp/\n\nhttps://indianapublicmedia.org/news/posso-sentenced-to-65-years-after-pleading-guilty-to-murder-of-12-year-old-son-in-2019.php\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=zwXyVGcWCaCNoKD5x7RXSU_cS4qf78ZgGdkOD9uu4s0lMYQ2iX8CUziLyecymlE50\n\nhttps://eu.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/crime/2022/10/07/judge-gives-man-65-years-in-starvation-death-of-12-year-old-son/69545042007/#:~:text=Posso%2C%2035%2C%20has%20been%20incarcerated,Walnut%20Street%20when%20Eduardo%20died\n\nhttps://www.mysuncoast.com/2019/05/30/manatee-county-sheriffs-office-releases-child-abuse-investigation-involving-year-old-boy-who-later-died-extreme-abuse/?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://www.wbiw.com/2022/07/21/indiana-court-of-appeals-denied-a-woman-a-lighter-sentence-for-the-murder-of-her-stepson/\n\nhttps://public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/Document/Opinion?Id=pKCMQe-7smEffEpjXuqG0Eg9lREUFXv6lskxYtW-fO9O6WgE4pOm5SsR2vX2Ttc00\n\nhttps://eu.tmnews.com/story/news/2019/05/31/details-emerge-in-12-year-olds-starvation-death/117328246/\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/06/04/us/boy-starved-to-death\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzbYi7mn0z0\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile/100063561125871/search/?q=posso\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to both Midland, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada to discuss yet another case where methamphetamine and \"mom's new man\" are a lethal combination. Logan Cline was an adorable boy with his whole life ahead of him. That was until his mother, Stormy Johnson, got involved with Corey Allen Trumbull, a meth addict who was cruel to animals and obsessed with death. Not only did Corey get both Logan and his older sister, Lexi, hooked on the drug, but he started physically abusing Logan - an act which would lead to Logan's badly beaten body being abandoned in a an old car in Wichita Falls.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/7MwcgztTsfC3mkfw/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Dh4M8Uq2ffpYjKKU/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005166616651\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/M63icgLkWCTowygy/?mibextid=LQQJ4d https://www.facebook.com/share/cujJ1B3U1kKkXuCg/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/stormyljohnson\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Dx8kGwck7BhrMUu2/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/207744312/logan-cline\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z4MT-zNSQEM?feature=shared\n\nhttps://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2020/03/trumbullarrestreport_Redacted.pdf\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/jury-needed-only-15-minutes-to-convict-moms-avowed-white-supremacist-boyfriend-of-11-year-old-boys-heinous-torture-murder/amp/\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g56891-d277960-Reviews-Red_Roof_Inn_Wichita_Falls-Wichita_Falls_Texas.html\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/logan-cline039s-funeral-expenses\n\nhttps://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/news/local/2020/04/16/trumbull-indicted-capital-murder-death-logan-cline-11/5149998002/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/crime/crime-crime/accused-child-murderer-corey-trumbull-booked-on-3-million-bonds/amp/\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/corey-trumbull-appealing-capital-murder-conviction/vi-BB1jA8qZ\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/09/07/stormy-johnson-pleaded-guilty-sentenced-murder-logan-cline/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/testimony-begins-in-trumbulls-capital-murder-trial/amp/\n\nhttps://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/testimony-begins-in-trumbulls-capital-murder-trial/amp/\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/08/22/details-murder-revealed-during-corey-trumbull-murder-trial/\n\nhttps://www.newschannel6now.com/2023/08/28/medical-examiner-takes-stand-trumbull-murder-trial/\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to LaPorte, Indiana, to discuss the case of 4-year-old Judah Morgan, who was placed in a loving home, only to have that stripped away 18-months later.

During this time, Judah was tied up with duct tape and thrown into the basement of the couple's squalid home, only to die from blunt force trauma due to all of the beatings he suffered at Alan's hands.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/Aa8vWXLZd88U3bAF/?mibextid=LQQJ4d\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/263339215/judah-marshall-morgan\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/resources/pdf/2b9b99bf-ce2f-4d5a-8529-5083dfa0e15e-amendedjudahmorganlawsuit.pdf\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/crime/unbelievable-judge-lashes-out-after-mother-said-she-missed-the-sweet-boy-she-helped-torture-and-beat-to-death/amp/\n\nhttps://gb.readly.com/magazines/pick-me-up/2024-03-14/65ec8eb427cff78b81cf208b\n\nhttps://www.tributebook.com/domains/9e84358d-f21f-4355-8b21-a2eb010b669d/obituaries/22691600/book?utm_source=www.lakeviewfhc.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=obit_event_view_book#\n\nhttps://www.youthservicebureau.com/programs\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/judah-morgan-laid-rest-child-abuse-murder-potty-training-judahs-law-father-mother-foster-parents-caregiver-child-care-department-services-dcs-hearings-wythogan-park-indiana\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/appeal-denied-father-murders-son-potty-training-judah-morgan-judahs-law-convicted-prison-sentence-upheld-child-abuse-laporte-county-indiana\n\nhttps://www.wndu.com/2022/11/29/laporte-man-sentenced-death-son/\n\nhttps://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/crime/northwest-indiana-man-sentenced-to-more-than-60-years-for-murder-of-4-year-old-son-judah-morgan\n\nhttps://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/crime/new-charges-filed-against-northwest-indiana-woman-accused-in-death-of-4-year-old-son\n\nhttps://wsbt.com/amp/news/local/la-porte-county-man-charged-with-murder-in-4-year-old-sons-murder\n\nhttps://eu.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2024/05/09/indiana-dcs-child-services-red-flags-judah-morgan-laporte-county-child-abuse-torture-foster-home/73606219007/\n\nhttps://fultoncountypost.com/wroi-news/711123#gsc.tab=0\n\nhttps://www.wndu.com/2021/10/14/court-docs-show-history-child-abuse-laporte-co-homicide-case/?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3c_z4aThOQU?feature=shared\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/justiceforjudah\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/263339215/judah-marshall-morgan\n\nhttps://fultoncountypost.com/wroi-news/664385#gsc.tab=0\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/emiyoder\n\nThis week, Drewby and Yergy head to Florida once again to discuss the case of infamous family annihilator, Ronnie O'Neal. Once a community activist, Ronnie snapped after falling victim to a random drive by shooting. Although he was separated from his wife, Kenyatta, at the time, she welcomed him back into their home once he was released from the hospital as he had nowhere to go. The couple shared two children - Ron’ Niveya, who had cerebral palsy, and Ronnie IV, whom they called \"Little Ronnie.\" March 18th, 2018, several 911 calls were placed from the couple's suburban neighborhood - two of which were from Kenyatta and Ronnie. That evening, Ronnie shot his estranged wife and bludgeoned her to death with the gun in their neighbor's yard. He then went back into the home and hacked his wheelchair-bound daughter to death in front of his young son, who was hiding in the kitchen. He then turned his attention on Little Ronnie, stabbing him nearly to death before setting the house ablaze. There was just one problem with Ronnie's plan... his son lived to testify against him in court, where Ronnie gained notoriety for his courtroom antics.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/477664219/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/472520492/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/480133777/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/480133777/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/474956256/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/498849391/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/507852057/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://newspapers.com/image/577841195/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/697533550/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/737943548/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/740665508/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742337526/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742674595/?match=1&terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/image/742980122/?terms=Ronnie%20Oneal\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0wNPsxlD0w\n\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2021/07/23/family-members-condemn-ronnie-oneal-as-he-gets-life-for-fatal-attack-on-family/\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/i-am-safe-i-am-loved-riverview-boy-stabbed-set-on-fire-adopted-by-detective-who-responded-to-double-murder/\n\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/florida/second-district-court-of-appeal/2023/21-2460.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0wNPsxlD0w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqOLoCwi6A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MmsTQNU_N8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyE1ioxSGh0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXcLWHIsHsU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snSU49TM1OM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn7oT62kWlQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6yiy6i_Uzo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGPaC6qsqbk\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/228555724/ron'niveya-o'neil\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/188794344/kenyatta_barron\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch?ref=search&v=1131601890811194&external_log_id=a7f0ed76-e137-4bf5-bf7a-0613a6b2e680&q=kenyata%20barron%20murder\n\nhttps://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/ronnie-oneal-found-guilty-of-murdering-his-girlfriend-9-year-old-daughter-in-2018\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/ronniveya-oneal\n\nhttps://theautismwars.blogspot.com/2021/06/autisticwhileblack-against-erasure-of.html\n\nhttps://www.wtsp.com/article/news/crime/psychologist-testifies-ronnie-oneal-trial/67-2adb32cd-7938-4097-b342-15e47602cda2\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/ronnie-oneal-murder-trial-detective-who-adopted-oneals-son-speaks-to-jurors/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opd23dTTQbI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGmGIa6yBI8\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@vikingmindset11/video/7300367525240425771\n\nHappy 4th of July Week if you're living in the States.

Things came to a head on December 27th, 2013, when Synthia became so upset with Omaree that she literally kicked him to death. Much like many of the cases we've discussed on this channel, CPS and local authorities were very much involved in the family's life, and failed in their duty to protect Omaree.\n\nSupport Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachine\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachine\n\nJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1\n\nInstagram: miserymachinepodcast\n\nTwitter: misery_podcast\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM\n\n#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrime\n\nSource Material:\n\nhttps://disability-memorial.org/omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/man-convicted-in-brutal-killing-of-9-year-old-boy-gets-20-years-less-in-prison/28918564\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/abqjournal/name/omaree-varela-obituary?id=38476994\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/albuquerque-metro/omaree-varelas-stepfather-to-be-re-sentenced/\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/124680846/omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/horrible-crime-shook-city-state-including-victims-young-siblings/28753226\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-tragic-case-of-omaree_b_5534857\n\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/slain-childs-estate-blames-nm-caseworkers/\n\nhttps://www.cabq.gov/police/documents/childabusepreventiontaskforcereport.pdf\n\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-nmd-1_15-cv-01039/pdf/USCOURTS-nmd-1_15-cv-01039-0.pdf\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/214518720/Omaree-Autopsy-Report\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/stephen-casaus-sentenced-to-10-years-in-federal-prison/\n\nhttps://apnews.com/general-news-fc06c0248e444c268bd4e1b93e0749bc\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/omarees-mom-during-sentencing-i-love-my-kids/\n\nhttps://casetext.com/case/state-v-casaus-2\n\nhttps://www.petedinelli.com/2019/07/30/nine-year-old-omaree-varela-settlement-needs-to-be-made-public/\n\nhttps://www.pressreader.com/usa/albuquerque-journal/20150905/281522224857924\n\nhttps://www.kxan.com/news/woman-sentenced-to-40-years-for-kicking-9-year-old-son-to-death/\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/judge-omaree-varelas-mother-competent-to-stand-trial/\n\nhttps://www.robertorosalesphotgraphy.com/blog/2014/1/10/memorial-services-held-for-omaree-varela\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/timeline-of-the-omaree-varela-case/5008916\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/candelight-vigil-held-for-omaree-varela/5053387\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/speakforomaree/\n\nhttps://www.krqe.com/news/prosecutors-evidence-shows-stephen-casaus-involved-in-omarees-death/\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/casaus-family-wrap/4452741\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvBxvWANUKc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvB2V6FOwCk\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2553953/Police-did-911-call-recorded-abuse-boy-9-later-died.html\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2617634/Terrible-toll-meth-mother-stomped-son-9-death.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzaf6fYo4is\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIomy4J3CLY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4to-bmzy-L0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FOJtKLJ1_4\n\nhttps://www.koat.com/article/steve-casaus-latest/4442601\n\nhttps://www.cd.nm.gov/offender-search\n\nShow more"
