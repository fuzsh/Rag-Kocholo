        "text": "Thursday April 11, 1996\n\nNew York State Supreme Court justice, Marylin Diamond, struck down a state law that granted a state board power to decide union contracts as unconstitutional inteference by the state into city affairs. This is blow to the union and a coup for Mayor Giuliani in his negotiations with the union.\n\nThe dispute over Doris Duke's $1.2 biliion estate seems to be over. The tentative settlement requires that Bernard Lafferty, her butler, give up his executor role, but allows him to keep a large sum of his money."
