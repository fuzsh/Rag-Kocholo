Simmons says the words \"I don't want to go to Awilda Lopez was the mother whom Elisa did not call mommy. Awilda had her daughter every other weekend, and Elisa had returned from those visits bruised and shaken. The child now was telling the caseworker that she wanted to suffer no more. The visits continued, and Elisa happened to be with her mother the day in May 1994 when the child's father succumbed to cancer .\n\nAwilda announced that she was keeping the child, and the months that followed demonstrated that even when backed by numerous reports of abuse, a child's plea can mean nothing to the agency that calls itself the Child Welfare Administration. Elisa was in her mother's custody Nov. 17 of last year, when they attended a birthday party in their building on Pike St. She wore a white blouse and a black dress, and at one point a 9-year-old named Eric asked her to dance. In earlier times, Simmons had taught Elisa the merengue and the girl had danced with a joyful exuberance .\n\nShe now only shuffled, as if the blasting music did not quite reach her. \"I tried to move, but she was dancing slow,\" Eric says. Still, Elisa retained a quality that had in earlier times enchanted Prince Michael of Greece. Eric remained charmed enough to keep dancing, holding both her hands as they danced to song after song. A SMILING Elisa Izquierdo, in school photo, is focus of charges that pleas for help fell on deaf ears .\n\n\"Maybe five,\" Eric says.

Awilda.\" MICHAEL DALY \"Maybe more.\" Then the time came for the cake. Eric afterward wandered into another room, and perhaps Elisa was a bit charmed as well, for unbeknownst to him she was right behind him when he closed the door. The girl's fingers were caught in the door, and Awilda took her into the bathroom to soak them in the sink .\n\nEric says Awilda summoned him to join them. \"She said: 'Come over here. Apologize to the little Eric says. Morgy hints at probe of system By BARBARA ROSS and CORKY SIEMASZKO Daily News Staff Writers Declaring \"'the city should be ashamed\" of Elisa Izquierdo's slaying, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said yesterday a grand jury probing the case could examine problems in the child welfare system. \"We want to see if there was other criminal conduct, any kind which we have jurisdiction over,\" Morgenthau said .\n\nHe refused to put the blame solely on the city Child Welfare Administration and would not comment on whether caseworkers who were supposed to protect Elisa were being targeted. Morgenthau also urged the Legislature to make child abuse a felony. It is now a misdemeanor. His remarks. came Afothe 6-year-old girl's mother, Awilda Lopez, was indicted on second degree murder charges re nogs On other occasions, Awilda is said to have called Elisa a \"little whore.\" Eric says that when he went into the bathroom Awilda seized his hand and attempted to make him molest her daughter .\n\n\"I was Eric says. Eric fled the room, and he later would say that he was too scared to say anything. Elisa also was silent and seemed in a daze as the music kept blasting and the party continued. \"I think she felt like a dream in the mind,\" Eric says. Elisa sat on the sofa, and Eric says that a second shock of the night came when Awilda suddenly slapped the child .\n\nHe says Elisa stayed silent, her head dropping, her lower lip protruding. \"I felt like she was going to cry sometime,\" Eric says. Elisa and Awilda then departed. The abuse continued, and officials at Elisa's new school did not fail to detect the signs. On Dec .\n\n19, a social worker from Public School 126 spoke to a deputy director of the CWA Manhattan field office. The CWA official is said to have deemed the case \"unreportable.\" By April of this year, matters had gotten so out of control that Awilda herself sought help from CWA. She was unable to get her caseworker and sought the help of Dr. Bart O'Connor of Project Chance. O'Connor rushed to the house and found that the child's bed had LOT been burned He said the girl's neighbors in a lower East Side housing project who may have .\n\nheard her screams would not face criminal charges because their alleged negligence \"does not rise to the level of a crime.\" However, he left open the possibility that others who may have abused Elisa could be indicted. Lopez' husband, Carlos, was in jail on a probation violation Nov. 20, when Elisa was slammed against a concrete wall. Dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, Lopez appeared before Judge Lee Elkin in Manhattan Criminal Court for less than a minute yesterday before being returned to Rikers Island. She was being held without bail and under a suicide watch .\n\nAnother hearing is set for Dec. 20. In addition to second-degree murder, Lopez is charged with first -degree man slaughter and endangering the welfare of Elisa and fivo of her other fine children: Kasey Mahones, 8, and Ruben Rivera, 9. by exposing them to the abuse inflicted on their sister. Elisa was subjected to abuse starting in May 1994, when her biological father, Gustavo Izquierdo, died of cancer and she went to live with her mother .\n\nLopez' attorney, Daniel Ollen, told reporters: \"This woman is not the ogre she has been portrayed to be. There are things about this case that haven't been reported. You would be very surprised. It will put her in a different light.\" Asked whether Elisa's life with her late father was as idyllic as it has been described in some news media, Ollen replied: \"Good He said Lopez frequently baby-sat for her neighbors including a child with palsy.
