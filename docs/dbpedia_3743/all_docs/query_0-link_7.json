        "text": "CHRISTMAS died weeks ago in apartment 20A at 75 Pike Street, in the lower Manhattan projects known as the Rutgers Houses. It didn't stand a chance. How could it after Elisa Izquierdo lost her life there -- brutally, the authorities say, and at the hand of the person she should have been able to trust the most: her mother?\n\nThere is, however, a ghost of Christmas present at apartment 20A. Fittingly for this city, it is a graffiti writer.\n\nSomeone with a can of black paint sprayed the words \"killer\" and \"murderer\" on the front door. The paint ran on some of the letters, adding a ghoulish touch to the indelible accusation.\n\nDown the hall, Millie Vasquez remembered having first seen those words soon after Thanksgiving, when 6-year-old Elisa and her mother, Awilda Lopez, became symbols of the city's potential for monstrosity. Mrs. Vasquez can no longer bear to go near apartment 20A.\n\nBut life goes on, and yesterday brought another holiday, the one we associate most closely with children and their laughter and hope that all their tomorrows will be better.\n\nFor Mrs. Vasquez, it was the toughest Christmas in 21 years at Rutgers Houses.\n\n\"I just dragged this season,\" she said. \"I've been depressed. But then I decided that I couldn't keep doing this to myself. I've got my own family. I've got two kids in the house, and we're going over to my mother's. So four or five days ago, I said: let's make this Christmas.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
