'Intimate Relations' is a 1996 Canadian-British film, the first movie by writer and director Philip Goodhew. It stars Rupert Graves, Julie Walters and Laura Sadler. The film is a drama and black comedy about a young man who has an affair with both the middle-aged housewife he is lodging with and her daughter.

The film is based on the true story of Albert Goozee, who was put on trial in 1956 in England. He was arrested after his 53-year-old landlady, Mrs. Lydia Leakey, and her 14-year-old daughter, Norma, were found murdered. Goozee was tried only for the murder of the teenage girl, convicted and imprisoned for life.
