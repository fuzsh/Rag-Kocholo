        "text": "Intimate Relations is a (1996) Canadian-British film, starring Rupert Graves as Harold Guppey, Julie Walters as Marjorie Beaslie and Laura Sadler (1980-2003) as 14-year-old Joyce Beaslie. When Harold first appears in the film after leaving the Merchant Navy, he tells his brother Morris, who hasn’t seen him since he was a child that he was in Australia for a bit and had been travelling ever since he left the 'home'. Morris’ wife tells Harold that he’s not welcome in their lives - he’s just not the sort of person they want around their child. The viewer discovers Harold's father died when he was 10 years old and he was 'sent away' - about 1933 (presumably to Australia, which would make him one of the migrant children) as his mum couldn't cope with his 'unruly behaviour'. The film is a black comedy about a young man who has an affair with the middle-aged housewife he is lodging with.\n\nThe film takes place in the 1950s in the suburbs of London and is based on the true story of Albert Goozee who killed his landlady and her daughter, and either was or became a paedophile. He was sentenced to death but had a reprieve days before on grounds that he had been \"provoked beyond reason\", and the sentence commuted to life imprisonment. He was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia and detained at Broadmoor. After he was released, he went on to commit more crimes including at aged 73, the indecent assault of two girls aged 12 and 13. This brings into question why this disturbing film was made into a black comedy."
