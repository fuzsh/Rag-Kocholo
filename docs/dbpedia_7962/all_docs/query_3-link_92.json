        "text": "Call it the clash of the titans. While Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams were each world famous on their own terms, what’s less known about the two legendary writers are the intimate details of their close, sometimes contemptuous, friendship—until now.\n\nIn the new documentary, Truman and Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation, in theaters June 18, filmmaker Lisa Immordino Vreeland (whose previous films includes Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel and Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict) explores the unique relationship the two shared through archival film clips, letters, and the writers’ own work. To help bring the men to life, Jim Parsons voices Capote and Zachary Quinto portrays Williams.\n\nTruman & Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation will be in theaters on June 18.\n\n“In making this film, I was attracted to a simple—yet evocative—concept, that of the imaginary conversation,” Immordino Vreeland tells T&C. “I love the idea of being able to listen in on an intimate encounter between two sharp and creative minds operating at the height of their powers, and this is the very experience I created.”\n\nAnd while the film’s protagonists are no longer with us, the director says their story is one that’s still resonant today.\n\n“I seem to run into a common theme, and one I love exploring in my films, which is the sacrifice that artists give to their métier—often it can ruin them, we certainly witness this in the film,” she says. “Despite Truman’s best efforts to sabotage their friendship they are able, at the end of their lives, to mutually respect each other and their work. Although it was Tennessee who took that first step in repairing their friendship in a letter he wrote to Truman in 1978, what matters is that it was repaired. Ultimately, I realized that even if they were dueling literary voices their goal was to create the richest imaginary world for us, the readers.”"
