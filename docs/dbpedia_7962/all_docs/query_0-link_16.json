(HU). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nBefore the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Russian cinema genres resembled those common in Europe at the time. In the 1920s, however, Russian filmmakers, armed with bold new ideas about cinematic art and with a revolutionary political ideology, created theories of \"montage\" and a decade of acknowledged film masterpieces. In the 1930s, the experimental directions of early Soviet cinema were replaced by the doctrine of \"socialist realism,\" a style closer to that of classical (Hollywood) narrative cinema, with themes intended to foster the political and didactic agenda of the state. After Stalin's death in 1953, however, filmmakers were able to reintroduce personal and even religious and philosophical themes, as well as return to a more 'poetic' style, particularly in Ukrainian film. As censorship ended during the Gorbachev period of glasnost (openness), 1985-91, a more honest and naturalistic cinema emerged, along with renewed stylistic experimentation. In the 1990s and in the first decades of the 21st century Russian cinema has reacted to American-style genre films by adapting those patterns to deal with new pressing concerns, such as ethnic conflict and the economic traumas of the transition to capitalism. We will view, analyze and discuss fifteen films from the 1920s through the 2000s-with an eye both to their intrinsic artistic structure and to the social and cultural background and the political events with which they deal.\n\nFTVM 314 / POLISH 314 Polish Cinema\n\n(3).
