        "text": "Join a Discussion on Movies\n\nhen a good-looking young lodger named Harold Guppy (Rupert Graves) is invited to move into the fussy little household of Marjorie Beasley (Julie Walters), he is made more than welcome. Living her idea of a dainty existence in a provincial British town (the year is 1954), the 50-ish Marjorie still has some unladylike impulses.\n\nShe keeps these secrets from her inquisitive 13-year-old daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler), and from her husband, Stanley (Matthew Walker), who lost his leg in World War I. He has apparently been getting on Marjorie's nerves ever since.\n\n\"My husband and I keep separate rooms for medical purposes,\" Marjorie explains to Harold, whose own problematic past has left him too wishy-washy to run for the door. Sure enough, Harold is soon recruited to make Marjorie feel less lonely in the simplest possible way. Since Philip Goodhew's \"Intimate Relations,\" a black comedy about this household, is billed as being \"inspired by true events,\" it's safe to assume from the outset that there's more to this story than illicit sex. It's safe to assume that somebody winds up dead.\n\nDespite the fact that it tells an ultimately sad story, \"Intimate Relations\" concentrates on the kitschier aspects of its odd menage. Marjorie, though played with warmth and humor by Ms. Walters, is an instant target. With her hair curled so primly that it seems to be in rollers, with thick glasses and the frumpiest of clothes, Marjorie makes herself a goddess of dowdy domesticity and maintains a perfectly hypocritical demeanor with her neighbors.\n\n\"Oh, Pamela, you silly, silly girl!\" she exclaims in shock when a co-worker is fired for being pregnant. Marjorie works at a genteel cleaning establishment, which is nicely apt, since in figurative terms she has the dirtiest laundry in town.\n\nIn a film so drily acerbic that it can give a wicked spin to a line like \"Lemon puff?,\" Goodhew winks at his characters' naivete. There is the evening, for instance, when Joyce's birthday party includes a game of spin the bottle and Harold and Marjorie wind up doing the heartiest spinning. Emboldened by this, Marjorie creeps into Harold's bedroom in her flannel nightie and captures her prey, only to be interrupted by Joyce moments later.\n\n\"It's not fair!\" Joyce wails, catching her mother in bed with the lodger. \"It's my birthday!\" The lovebirds have no choice, the film assumes, but to invite Joyce to climb in with them for a chaste night's sleep.\n\nAmusing as it often is, with Ms. Sadler entertainingly sneaky as the teen-age daughter and Graves so wonderfully dim, \"Intimate Relations\" runs into trouble as it heads for mayhem. Goodhew's archness wears thin, leaving no room for the pathos that these last scenes require. Having satirically distanced himself from these absurd people, he cannot easily give much weight to their plight.\n\nIn retrospect, since the real man on whom Harold's character is based has spent much of his life in hospitals and jails, convicted of crimes including sexual assault on schoolgirls, this story looks like no laughing matter.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\nINTIMATE RELATIONS\n\nRating: \"Intimate Relations\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
