        "text": "“Good Will Hunting” is one of my all-time favourite movies.\n\nI rewatch it every few years, and I still cry at the famous, “It’s not your fault” scene. Especially now, watching the film again after Robin William’s death, much of his character’s wisdom hits home in a more profound, heartbreaking way.\n\nThe other day, I was hanging out with some male friends and one made a comment that always makes me shake my head and laugh, “Girls don’t poop!” For some reason, men at our age still want to believe that women are these perfect creatures who don’t fart, poop, yell, cry, or sometimes eat pizza off the floor at 2 a.m. in the morning.\n\nBut it reminded me of one of my favourite scenes in “Good Will Hunting” where Robin Williams talks about his deceased wife farting in her sleep, and how one night it was so loud, it woke the dog up.\n\nApparently, the scene was also improvised and he had the whole set laughing hysterically. Ah, we miss you, Robin Williams.\n\nWhat this scene tells me about love and relationships:"
