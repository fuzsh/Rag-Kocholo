        "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that adolescents’ behavior is influenced by what they see in popular media, including movies. Years of research have supported an association between viewing violence in media and subsequent aggressive thoughts and behaviors (Bushman & Huessman, 2001; Paik & Comstock, 1994; Wood, Wong, & Chachere, 1991). Research has found that exposure to sexual content in media influences sexual attitudes, intentions, and behavior (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education, 2001; Ashby, Arcari, & Edmonson, 2006; Brown et al., 2006; Collins et al., 2004; Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, & Berry, 2005). Initiation of other risk behaviors, such as smoking and drinking alcohol, has also been linked to exposure to media portrayals of these behaviors (Klein et al., 1993). Viewing smoking in movies is associated with adolescent initiation of smoking (Dalton et al., 2003; Hanewinkel & Sargent, 2007; Sargent et al., 2001; Sargent et al., 2005) and having a favorite star who smokes is also associated with trying smoking (Distefan, Gilpin, Sargent, & Pierce, 1999; Distefan, Pierce, & Gilpin, 2004; Tickle, Sargent, Dalton, Beach, & Heatherton, 2001). Similar effects have been reported for viewing alcohol content in movies on the initiation of alcohol use (Sargent, Wills, Stoolmiller, Gibson, & Gibbons, 2006). Additionally, prior experimental studies demonstrated that children who viewed drinking portrayals on television had more positive beliefs about alcohol than children who did not (Kotch, Coulter, & Lipsitz, 1986; Robinson, Chen, & Killen, 1998; Rychtarik, Fairbank, Allen, Foy, & Drabman, 1983).\n\nIn order to determine whether a child should see a particular movie, many parents in the United States rely on ratings determined by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Established in 1968, the MPAA rating system is the most widely available movie rating system in the U.S.; it is the only rating that currently appears on DVD/VHS covers, is listed in theaters when movies are released, and appears on all advertising materials for films. Although other rating systems are being developed and are available on the internet (e.g., http://www.screenit.com and http://www.kids-in-mind.com), the MPAA rating system continues to be the most accessible and visible rating system to parents making decisions about movie appropriateness. The MPAA uses a 5 category age-based rating system: G (appropriate for general audiences), PG (parental guidance is suggested, some content may not be appropriate for all children), PG-13 (parents are strongly cautioned, content may not be suitable for children under age 13), R (restricted to individuals 17 or over unless accompanied by a parent or guardian), and NC-17 (no one under age 18 is admitted) (Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA], 2005b).\n\nAlthough MPAA ratings are supposed to offer a quick way for parents to determine the age appropriateness of movies, parents often judge movie content to be less appropriate for adolescents than the MPAA ratings would suggest (Walsh & Gentile, 2001) and over 40% of parents in a recent survey indicated that ratings did not provide enough information to assist them in making decisions about their children’s movie viewing (Longacre et al., in press). To supplement the ratings, the MPAA ratings board also provides descriptive content codes (e.g., graphic violence, brief nudity, or strong language), which provide additional information about the reasons for the rating. The use of some content codes, particularly those related to sexuality and violence, do correlate with MPAA ratings. However, content codes related to substance use, including alcohol and tobacco use, often inadequately or inconsistently represent the content of the films (Thompson & Yokota, 2004). This probably reflects the fact that tobacco and alcohol are not currently among the content areas specifically considered by the MPAA ratings board when evaluating a movie. In a recent study, 61% of parents reported that they want to be informed about smoking and drinking in films (Longacre et al., in press). This suggests that the criterion currently used for MPAA ratings may not match parents’ concerns. In addition, there is recent evidence of “ratings creep” (a decrease in the strictness of the ratings over time) suggesting that the MPAA ratings board may be giving more lenient ratings to objectionable content over the last decade (Thompson & Yokota, 2004). Gentile, Humphrey, and Walsh (2005) have advocated for additional research to examine the reliability and validity of rating systems over time as a step in moving toward a system that will better meet parents’ needs.\n\nThe objectives of the present research are to quantify the risk behavior content in a large sample of popular contemporary films released over a nine-year period, examine differences in content between MPAA rating categories, and explore how well MPAA ratings distinguish risk behavior content. Sex, violence, and drug use are explicitly used by the MPAA ratings board to determine rating categories. As such, these behaviors are examined in this paper as context for the behaviors of primary interest: tobacco and alcohol use. In a content analysis of a smaller sample of movies we found the mean amount of tobacco use was positively correlated with MPAA rating (Dalton, Tickle, Sargent, Beach, Ahrens, & Heatherton, 2002). However, this association does not necessarily mean that the ratings adequately discriminate content if the distributions for each rating category substantially overlap. To our knowledge, the extent to which the current ratings distinguish tobacco and alcohol content for individual movies has not been quantified. In response to pressure from public health advocates, the MPAA recently announced that it will consider tobacco as a criterion in the rating system (MPAA, 2007), but it is not clear how this will be implemented or what impact this consideration will have on a movie’s rating. This analysis evaluates whether a revision to the current rating system is necessary to adequately inform parents about tobacco and alcohol content in movies. It also establishes an important baseline comparison for the evaluation of the MPAA’s future policy change in the consideration of tobacco use. Secondarily, evidence of “ratings creep” over this time period is also explored to determine if frequency of risk behaviors within the rating categories became more prevalent over time.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur analysis shows that the rating system does statistically differentiate mean levels of smoking, drinking, sexual behavior, violence, and drug use in movies, with R rated films containing the highest levels of each of these behaviors. However, as further analysis indicated, evidence of mean differences in the portrayal of risk behaviors across rating categories did not necessarily equate to the ability of any given rating to accurately describe the content of any specific film. When the variability in the amount of risk behaviors in films was taken into account, we found a large degree of overlap in content between rating categories. Particularly with regard to alcohol and tobacco content, we found that the rating categories do not adequately distinguish the amount of these behaviors portrayed in a movie. Although it is not the purpose of the currently established ratings categories to accurately distinguish amount of tobacco and alcohol use, viewing alcohol and tobacco use on screen have been empirically linked to adolescent initiation of smoking and drinking. Therefore, it is disconcerting that ratings, which are supposed to help parents decide whether or not their children should see a film, do not clearly differentiate how much of these behaviors were portrayed. The high degree of overlap between rating categories indicates that the MPAA ratings, as currently defined, are not an adequate proxy for tobacco or alcohol content in a movie and therefore are not useful for parents who may want to know about content that could influence the risk behaviors of their children. Additionally troubling is recent research by Jenkins and colleagues (Jenkins, Webb, Browne, Afifi, & Kraus, 2005) that found a similar effect for violent content — a variable that is supposed to directly contribute to MPAA ratings. In line with the present data, they found that despite mean differences in violent content in ratings, the violent content within each rating category varied to such an extent that the ratings did not adequately predict the level of violence in the film. On a practical level, the MPAA ratings may not differentiate content on a movie-by-movie basis as well as parents expect, despite the fact that the MPAA states that their ratings board “uses the same criteria as any parent making a judgment” when rating a movie (MPAA, 2005a).\n\nRecently, in response to increasing pressure from anti-smoking groups, major public health organizations, and State Attorneys General, the MPAA announced that it will begin to consider cigarette smoking as a criterion when rating a movie (MPAA, 2007). In addition, it would be possible to add descriptive content codes to provide more specific detail about a films’ smoking or drinking content. Although it is possible that this may make the rating system more informative for parents, our data suggest that anything short of a definitive rating for movies with smoking content is unlikely to clearly differentiate movies based on tobacco use. For example, even though the MPAA considers sexual content when rating a movie, we still found a substantial degree of overlap of sexual content in movies across all rating categories. Importantly, the significant degree of overlap would be missed by an analysis that concentrates only on statistical differences between average seconds of exposure. However, female nudity was not found in any G or PG movies because the MPAA has determined that nudity automatically warrants a higher rating. Similarly, in order to completely eliminate smoking from youth-rated movies, any movie with smoking would need to be assigned an R-rating.\n\nWe acknowledge that our measures of exposure do not take into account the context in which risk behaviors appeared in films. This context is likely to be very important in terms of which behaviors viewers’ adopt. For example, characteristics of the context such as whether the person engaging in the behavior is a favorite actor of the viewer or a momentary background figure, or whether the behavior itself is portrayed as glamorous or buffoonish, will likely add to or detract from the power of the overall portrayal. The sexual content variable, in particular, included time of exposure to a range of behaviors including sexual intercourse as well as relatively benign romantic kissing, and did not differentiate the type or graphicness of sexual activity portrayed. Because we did not consider intensity or context of sexual behaviors, which presumably are considered by the ratings board, we may have overestimated the degree of overlap of sexual content across rating categories. However, the fact that even this rough measure of sexual exposure time seems to better distinguish between rating categories than tobacco or alcohol exposure is troubling given the known relationships between viewing tobacco and alcohol use in movies and teenage smoking and drinking. Drug use and violence were coded categorically, which limited our ability to directly compare them to the other variables in the ratings discrimination findings. However, it is clear that the MPAA ratings are much better at distinguishing drug use than violence based on our finding that none of the G or PG movies we coded contained high salience drug use, but approximately half of the G and PG movies contained high salience violence.\n\nOverall, we found that the amount of tobacco and alcohol use in movies has decreased over time. This could suggest that the movie industry is responding to increasing pressure by public health groups to eliminate smoking from movies and/or that they are simply reflecting the decrease in smoking among the general population. We did not find support for increased risk behavior content over time for any movie rating and in fact, there was a general decline in the amount of smoking, drinking, and sexual behavior over time, suggesting that a “ratings creep” was not evident in these data. Ratings creep, however, is only one type of inconsistency that might affect the reliability and validity of move ratings (Gentile, Humphrey, & Walsh, 2005). The fact that the MPAA ratings do not clearly distinguish age-appropriate from age-inappropriate content indicates that the ratings are not a useful indicator of movie content for certain risk behaviors.\n\nThe MPAA rating system has been used by parents for almost four decades, and it is easily accessible and understandable to most parents. Studies have shown that an R-rating for a film is a reasonable proxy for high amounts of risk behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol content, and parental restriction of children’s access to R-rated films is related to a lower risk of engaging in smoking and drinking (Dalton, Ahrens, et al., 2002; Jackson, Brown, & L’Engle, 2007; Sargent et al., 2004; Thompson & Gunther, 2006). However, the present analysis shows that a substantial proportion of the lower rated movies may have as much alcohol and tobacco use as R-rated movies. If the intent of the MPAA rating system is to help parents select age-appropriate movies, it is clear that the system may need to be expanded to content beyond its current scope (violence, sexuality, and profanity) to include other health behavior content that has also been shown to be detrimental to children such as tobacco and alcohol. More extensive content-based ratings systems for films that do take tobacco and alcohol use into account are being developed and are currently available on the internet (e.g., http://www.ScreenIt.com, http://www.Kids-In-Mind.com, http://www.commonsensemedia.org). However, these guides are not as easily accessible as the MPAA ratings and it is unrealistic to expect that most parents have the time or resources required to consult them prior to each movie viewing. This study demonstrates that the MPAA criteria for determining a film’s rating need to be updated to better reflect research demonstrating that adolescents are influenced by movie portrayals of risk behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use. Future research should examine whether any updates to the rating system are useful for parents who are concerned about these behaviors."
