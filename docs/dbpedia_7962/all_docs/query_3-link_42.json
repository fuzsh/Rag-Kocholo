        "text": "This wry, charming romantic comedy of 1938 features a marvellously caddish turn from Garry Marsh as a philandering husband whose wife proves to be every bit as adept as he in the art of deception!\n\nGeorge Gommery enjoys slipping up to town to see some little actress, and never suspects that his wife can play the same game just as well as he can. Or at least, he never suspects until he tells his wife that her lover is engaged to the woman whom he has been entertaining in London...\n\nAlso starring the lovely June Clyde and '30s comedy legend Moore Marriott, with music from acclaimed British bandleader Lew Stone, Intimate Relations is presented here in a brand-new transfer from the original film elements, in its as-exhibited theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nFirst released: Monday 26th January 2015\n\nFear not! Many items can still be ordered. Amazon in the UK delivers to many international territories, whilst their Australia, USA and Canada stores also supply many equivalent or imported items.\n\nIf you are in the North America, look out for US/Canadian flag icons on popular product listings for direct links.\n\nIf you order from a UK store, please note that the UK is in Region 2 and B, respectively, for DVDs and Blu-rays - check your player's compatibility, or look for multi-region products if you are located in another region.\n\nIf you are in Australia or New Zealand (DVD Region 4), note that almost all DVDs distributed in the UK by the BBC and 2entertain are encoded for both Region 2 and Region 4. The UK and Australasia are in the same Blu-ray region (B).\n\nFurther information & advice on importing"
