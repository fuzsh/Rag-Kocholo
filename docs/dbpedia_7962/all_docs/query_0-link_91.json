        "text": "The 1920s: Rumours\n\n1922\n\nBirth of the BBC. Its first Director-General John Reith has a reputation for strict morals but his personal diaries, held by BBC Archives, reveal he had at least one passionate, romantic and (his biographer believes) sexual relationship with a man when in his twenties.\n\nIn 1922, sex between men is illegal. There is no specific law about lesbians, but LGBT+ people lead hidden lives, risking blackmail, arrest, social rejection and ruin.\n\n1928\n\nDame Ethel Smythâs work is first broadcast by the BBC. She is the first woman to be made a Dame for her achievements in music and is honoured by the BBC for her 75th birthday.\n\nEthel Smyth enjoys many passionate affairs with women. As a Suffragette she is jailed with Emmeline Pankhurst (with whom she is in love) and composes the Suffragette anthem âMarch of the Womenâ.\n\n1929\n\nPoliceman Harry Daley broadcasts in the My Dayâs Work slot on Childrenâs Hour. Oscar Wildeâs The Selfish Giant is also broadcast that day.\n\nHarry Daley, a self-educated gay man, meets the BBC producer JR Ackerley while walking his Hammersmith beat. Ackerley, also gay, puts Daley on the radio and introduces him to his literary friends including Room With A View author EM Forster.\n\nDaley and Forster go on to become lovers for many years.\n\nThe 1930s: Can we mention?\n\n1937\n\nCan the BBC even mention the name of Oscar Wilde? The most celebrated gay man in living memory.\n\nWildeâs work is broadcast but the man himself is never talked about. Journalist, author and playwright Jean-Joseph Renaud broadcasts his memories of Wildeâs last months in Paris, without any reference to the cause of his downfall.\n\nSome praise the BBC for its open-mindedness in mentioning him at all.\n\n1938\n\nDouglas Byng is the first female impersonator on television. He later has his own shows including Byng Ho! and Queue for a Song.\n\nHe never retires, and in 1977 at the age of 90 appears on Parkinson and Radio 4.\n\nWithin his own theatrical world, Byng is openly gay but very discreet outside it. He stars in music hall, revue and cabaret.\n\nThe 1940s: Performing from the closet\n\n1941\n\nCelebrated broadcasting bandleader Guyana-born Ken âSnakehipsâ Johnson is killed in an air raid while performing at the CafÃ© de Paris in London. He is remembered for his influence on British swing.\n\nJohnson lives with well-known writer and critic Gerald Hamilton who refers to Ken as âmy husbandâ. Biographers routinely ignore Kenâs sexuality until academic Stephen Bourne discovers first-hand testimonies of Ken's relationship.\n\n1944\n\nLord Alfred Douglas - otherwise known as âBosie', Oscar Wildeâs lover, and central to his downfall 50 years earlier, reads poetry in his only broadcast.\n\nA year before, the BBC considers asking Douglas to talk about Wilde, but thinks it would ânot be wiseâ.\n\nThe 1950s: An acceptable subject?\n\nRex Jameson creates âMrs. Shufflewickâ at a BBC audition, when a vicar character is deemed unsuitable for the BBC. As the cheeky Cockney charlady, Jameson appears on radio and TV from 1950 to the 1970s.\n\nâShuffâ becomes a regular in venues around the gay scene with an innuendo-filled act. After Jamesonâs death in 1983, famous Camden drag pub The Black Cap names a bar âShufflewickâsâ after her.\n\nWally Stott is a household name as composer, arranger and band-leader, famous for The Goons and Hancockâs Half Hour, the biggest hit radio comedies of the time. This is the title page from one of his original scores in the BBC Music Library.\n\nIn 1972, Wally transitions, and as Angela Morley enjoys an award-winning career. Film music includes the score for Watership Down and frequent appearances conducting the BBC Concert Orchestra.\n\n1953\n\nSir John Gielgud is arrested for cottaging.\n\nUnlike Turing, his arrest does hit the headlines.\n\nAs a recently knighted celebrity actor, the case is one of the high-profile scandals in the early 50s that prompts a review of the law.\n\nGielgud gives a false name in court but is recognised and fears ruin, but he receives a standing ovation at his next theatre performance.\n\nJohnâs bother Val Gielgud enjoys a long BBC radio career and is Head of BBC Variety, from 1929-1963.\n\n1953\n\nThe BBC wrestles with if and how it can talk about sexual orientation.\n\nThese memos from November 1953 show it is divided.\n\n1954\n\nDeath of Alan Turing. In 1953 he reports a theft to police, but when officers realise he is gay, they arrest him instead.\n\nConvicted, Turing accepts chemical treatment to âcureâ his same-sex attraction, rather than face prison.\n\nAn inquest records suicide by cyanide poisoning.\n\nTuringâs life as a gay man is reported cautiously by the BBC.\n\nHe receives a posthumous Royal Pardon in 2013.\n\nTuringâs code-breaking war work is unknown to the public at this time, but as a pioneer of computing and artificial intelligence, he broadcasts twice, in 1951 and 1952.\n\nAs was quite usual then, no recording is made.\n\n1957\n\nThe Wolfenden Committee publishes its Report into the laws on homosexuality and prostitution. It recommends a partial decriminalisation of sex between men over 21 in private.\n\nA change in the law takes another ten years to get through the UKâs parliament.\n\nThe BBC usually asks psychiatrists, lawyers and clergymen to discuss the âproblem of homosexualityâ.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Wolfenden Report, BBC Radio broadcasts âThe Homosexual Conditionâ. The issue is similarly treated in BBC TVâs Lifeline programme.\n\nWolfenden himself appears on Any Questions where the panel, including bisexual Lord Bob Boothby, is asked if the Church is making a moral error in supporting the Report.\n\n1958\n\nWolfenden (whose son is gay), and EM Forster meet on a BBC radio programme.\n\nForster is the author of Passage to India, Room With a View, and the âgay Lady Chatterleyâs Loverâ, Maurice.\n\nThere is much speculation as to what is talked about off-mic during their radio encounter.\n\nThe 1960s: Nearly 'out'\n\n1964\n\nNaomi Jacob dies. Performer, composer, writer, panellist and essayist, her first work is broadcast by the BBC in 1924.\n\nA lesbian when it was virtually impossible to be âoutâ, Jacob, otherwise known as âMickyâ to her friends and lovers, defends Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness against its banning in 1928.\n\nShe becomes friends with Hall and her lover Una Troubridge.\n\nThis photograph shows Jacob at her last broadcast on Womanâs Hour in 1964, shortly before her death, aged 80.\n\n1964\n\nJoe Orton is a startling new talent, spotted by young BBC Radio producer John Tydeman - later instrumental in his success. âTydieâ eventually becomes a legendary head of BBC Radio Drama.\n\nOrton is murdered by his lover in 1967. He leaves behind diaries perhaps even more entertaining and outrageous than his plays.\n\n1965\n\nWriters Marty Feldman and Barry Took use gay slang Polari in the innuendo-laced Julian and Sandy sketches in Round the Horne, with literal straight-man Kenneth Horne. Millions listen at Sunday lunchtimes to the highly gay stereotyped characters played by Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams.\n\nPolari has origins in the Roma communities, Italian, slang, and other sources. Its aim is to confuse outsiders, especially âBetty Braceletsâ, Polari for the police!\n\nbona = good, dolly = pretty, eke (ecaf) = face, lallies = legs, naff = rubbish/poor, nanty = no/nothing, ogle = look/eye, omi = man, omipalone = gay man, palone = woman, riah = hair, varda = see\n\n1965\n\nIn the Spring of 1965, a psychological TV drama features a love triangle with a gay aspect. The studio-based play is billed as âa cosmopolitan London couple (Glenda Jackson and Alfred Lynch) find their outwardly charmed lives upended by a troubled homosexual friend (Nicol Williamson)â.\n\nThe BBC is sufficiently rattled to postpone its broadcast for a year.\n\n1967\n\nThe UKâs Sexual Offences Act is law. However, after 10 long years of campaigning to implement the Wolfenden Report, the new act is barely a victory for gay rights. It only decriminalises gay sex in private between men. It does not cover the Merchant Navy or the Armed Forces, does not extend to Scotland or Northern Ireland, and does not equalise the discriminatory age of consent for gay men. An explicit ban on sex between women never exists in UK law.\n\nMan Alive broadcasts two editions weeks ahead of the Act looking at the lives of gay men and lesbians in turn.\n\nThe 1970s: Breakthrough\n\nThe 1970s see many camp, effeminate but never actually out and positive LGBTQ+ characters on TV.\n\nMr. Humphries (John Inman), Bombardier âGloriaâ Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes) and comedian-host Larry Grayson represent only one type of gay man. The broader diversity of LGBT+ lives is barely represented on-screen. Especially absent are lesbians and the trans community.\n\nThese omissions and stereotypes are heavily criticised by the LGBT+ community and others subsequently. Could it be that the LGBT+ artistes that did make it on air in the 70s were presenting their authentic selves in the only way TV allowed at the time?\n\n1970\n\nIn Steptoe and Son - Any old Iron? Harold is pursued by a stereotyped, predatory gay man, an antiques dealer. Albert teases Harold using the language of the time.\n\nThe title is a pun on Steptoeâs scrap business and Cockney rhyming slang: âIron hoof = poofâ.\n\nNegative portrayals of the LGBT+ community on television are widespread at this time, but radical for its day, toward the end of this episode of Steptoe and Son a gay police officer is introduced, without all the usual stereotyped characterisations.\n\nIn the real world in 1962, with Steptoe and Son already an early hit, Albert, played by Wilfrid Brambell, is arrested for âpersistently importuning menâ in Shepherdâs Bush, West London. He is given a conditional discharge, and has to pay costs.\n\n1970\n\nThe first male same-sex kiss on British television.\n\nBBC Twoâs broadcast of Edward II by Christopher Marlowe sees Edward (Ian McKellen) and Gaveston (James Laurenson) kiss.\n\n1970\n\nThe first female same-sex kiss on British television.\n\nIvich (Alison Fiske) and Irma (Consuela Chapman) kiss in David Turnerâs highly acclaimed 13 part adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartreâs trilogy of novels, The Roads to Freedom.\n\n1973\n\nFor the first time the UK trans community gets its own programme.\n\nIn Open Door, members of the trans community are given full editorial control over the issues that affect them, and there is a sense of celebration in this all-trans presented programme.\n\n1974\n\nAlthough The Roads to Freedom (BBC Two, 1970) shows two women kissing for the first time in a British television drama, it is not until 1974 that two characters specifically depicted as lesbians kiss on-screen.\n\nThe BBC TV drama âGirlâ, is a 35 minute drama set in the army, by James Robson.\n\nJackie (Alison Steadman) is leaving the army and encounters Corporal Harvey (Myra Frances), her ex-lover.\n\n1974\n\nJan Morris, established historian, journalist, author, and travel writer publishes Conundrum, her account of her transition, becoming one of the most prominent trans women in the public eye.\n\nVincent Kane interviews Morris on the publication of her book, four years after he interviews Morris pre-transition.\n\n1978\n\nTom Robinsonâs âGlad to Gayâ is released reaching 18 in the Top 40 within a week. Identifying as gay, Robinson is unique in chart music at the time, when record companies expect artistes to be in the closet for fear of affecting sales.\n\nâGlad to be Gayâ is banned by Radio 1âs Top 40 show, and not performed on Top of the Pops, but John Peel continues to play it. Tom Robinson later presents many music and magazine programmes across BBC Radio.\n\n1979\n\nThree films follow George Robert's transition to Julia Grant. The BBCâs Audience Research Department analyses viewersâ reactions and find only a minority feel the programme to be offensive or distasteful.\n\nLGBT+ themes are now seen more often in BBC drama - and with less controversy.\n\n1979\n\nThe Other Side: Only Connect.\n\nA play based around a researcher's discovery of thinker and early gay rights campaigner Edward Carpenter (1844-1929).\n\n1979\n\nPlay for Today: Coming Out by James Andrew Hall with Anton Rodgers and Hywel Bennett.\n\nThe original billing says âLewis Duncan's reputation is as a best-selling writer of tough he-man thrillers. But Lewis is actually a life-long homosexual and when he rashly contributes an article to a gay magazine, it looks as though he may be forced to declare himself.â\n\nThe 1980s: That kiss\n\n1983\n\nAIDS was first reported on in-depth on television.\n\nPanorama looked at a new condition during a wider segment about STDs and, in March 1983, noted there had been 12 AIDS related deaths in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile science strand Horizon broadcasts Killer in the Village, the first full-length in-depth UK documentary on the health crisis emerging in New Yorkâs gay village known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS.\n\nIn his interview for the BBC Oral History Collection, Producer Alec Nisbett explains to former Horizon Editor Simon Campbell Jones how Killer in the Village was made, despite initial resistance.\n\n1984\n\nPop starts to come out! Most LGBT+ performers from Freddie Mercury to George Michael keep their sexuality quiet as the music industry demands, but two new bands with out-gay members and lyrics with gay themes break convention with their hit debut singles Frankie Goes to Hollywoodâs âRelaxâ and Bronski Beatâs âSmalltown Boyâ.\n\nBroadcasting these tracks is another matter. In 1984 Frankie appears on Top of the Pops with âRelaxâ, but Radio 1 DJ Mike Read calls it âobsceneâ.\n\nThe BBC promptly bans it from daytime and chart shows, though late show DJâs âKidâ Jenson and John Peel continue to play it.\n\n1987\n\n1987 sees the first same-sex kiss in a UK television soap when Eastendersâ Colin gives boyfriend Barry a light peck on the forehead.\n\nThe Sun newspaper reports, âITâS EASTBENDERS ... a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs...when millions of children were watching.â\n\n1988\n\nSection 28 of the Local Government Act (1988, now repealed) states that a local authority âshall not intentionally promote homosexuality... as a pretended family relationship.â\n\nIt is the first anti-LGBT+ law introduced for more than 100 years.\n\nLesbians protesting against Section 28 invade the 6 oâclock News while on air. Sue Lawley and Nicholas Witchell continue presenting over shouting and scuffling.\n\nEditor, Tony Hall apologises later on the 9 oâclock News.\n\n1988\n\nScene: Two of Us, is a BBC Schools drama telling the story of schoolboys Matthew (Jason Rush) and Phil (Lee Whitlock) trying to understand their feelings for each other.\n\nIn the hostile atmosphere of Section 28 and AIDS, a nervous BBC first avoids showing Two of Us at all, then does, but only at 23.30.\n\nEventually the drama gets shown in a daytime BBC Schools & Colleges slot in 1990.\n\n1988\n\nDebating Section 28 and the arts on Radio 3 with the Sunday Telegraphâs Peregrine Worsthorne, Ian McKellen âaccidentallyâ comes out.\n\nHe tells his family before the recorded programme was broadcast and goes on to found LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall.\n\nThe 1990s: Itâs not Daytime, itâs Gaytime!\n\nJustin Fashanu becomes the first professional footballer in England to come out as gay. In 1981 he he is the first black footballer to command a Â£1 million transfer fee.\n\nHis clubs and fellow players have known his sexuality with mixed reactions, but once public, he receives abuse from crowds during matches. He commits suicide in 1998.\n\nIn 1992 Fashanu presents a pilot for the first national radio show aimed at LGBT+ youth, but doesnât go on to present the strand on Radio 1.\n\nIn this interview from 1992, Justin talks openly about coming to terms with his sexuality. He acknowledges the concessions he's been forced to make and the effect coming out has had on his career, his family and his treatment by the media.\n\n1994\n\nOut This Week begins on Radio Five Live in 1994. Made by All Out Productions, it is the first national radio news magazine âfor lesbians and gay menâ.\n\nPresenters include Nigel Wrench and Rebecca Sandles.\n\nWrench wins a Sony Gold Award for Out This Week and uses his acceptance speech to come out as HIV positive.\n\nIn 1998 he makes AIDS and Me for BBC Radio 4.\n\n1994\n\nByker Grove runs a gay storyline in 1994. Aimed at 12-16 year olds, the drama tackles many controversial issues in its 20 year run.\n\nIn this episode, Noddy, exploring his sexuality, kisses his friend Gary at the cinema.\n\nGary does not react well.\n\nThe Sun newspaper calls for producer Matthew Robinson to be sacked over the gay storyline.\n\n1995\n\nGaytime TV begins on BBC Two, the first BBC TV programme aimed at and LGBT+ audience.\n\nIt is presented by Rhona Cameron, Bert Tyler-Moore and Richard Fairbrass.\n\nThe programme runs until 1999.\n\nEditor Neil Crombie bills the show as âso glamorous and exciting straight people will love it too!â\n\nIndependent production company Planet 24, who makes Gaytime TV is founded by boyfriends Charlie Parsons and Waheed Alli.\n\nIn 1998, LGBT+ activist Alli becomes the youngest and first out gay member of the House of Lords. He is also the most prominent gay politician from a muslim tradition.\n\nThe 2000s: Trans visibility & BBC News LGBT+\n\nIn 2001 the BBC makes another attempt at targeting a gay audience - and this time only gay men.\n\nThat Gay Show \"edgy and irreverent\" is on the digital-only channel BBC Choice.\n\nPresenters included Kristian Digby, Jonathon Natynczyk, Tom Ashton, Robert Robertson and Scott Cappuro.\n\n2002\n\nTipping the Velvet (BBC Two, 2002) is based on Sarah Watersâ novel set in the world of Victorian music hall.\n\nSome predictable elements of the press profess outrage, but the BBCâs tone is more âbring it onâ, celebrating an adaptation full of humour and fun â as well as pushing the boundaries of depictions of lesbian sex on UK television.\n\n2005\n\nThe UKâs first LGBT+ History Month gets its initial publicity on BBC Radio 4âs âTodayâ programme. The underlying tone of the interview arguably mirrors that of earlier attempts by the BBC to grapple with the issues. Throughout the interview there is a general emphasis on challenging the need for the event.\n\n2006\n\nOne of the most prominent out lesbians in broadcasting, Claire Balding, and Radio 4 Announcer Alice Arnold celebrate their Civil Partnership in 2006.\n\nWhen same-sex marriage is legalised in 2013, they are able to backdate their union in a ceremony at the same venue.\n\n2015\n\nIn 2015 Rebecca Root is the first trans woman cast in a comedy.\n\nBoy Meets Girl is developed from a winner of the BBCâs 2013 Trans Comedy Award.\n\n2015\n\nIn the same year Riley Carter Millington joins Eastenders as Kyle Slater, the first trans man to play a trans character in a UK soap.\n\nTrans activist Paris Lees wrote âKyleâs entrance into EastEnders is a cultural landmark on a par with the showâs first gay character in the 80s.â\n\n2017\n\n50 years on from the first relaxing of anti-LGBT+ laws, the BBCâs major Gay Britannia season looks back at LGBT+ history and tells many new stories from different perspectives about life for LGBT+ people in 2017.\n\n2018\n\nAn established radio DJ at BBC Manchester in their former identity, Stephanie Hirst comes out as trans on BBC 5 Live.\n\nIn 2018 she becomes the first trans DJ with a daily radio show in the UK.\n\n2019\n\nBen Hunte is appointed the BBCâs first LGBT Correspondent in March 2019.
