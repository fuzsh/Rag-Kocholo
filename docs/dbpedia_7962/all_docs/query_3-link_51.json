        "text": "We’re sexists. How hard it is to acknowledge that I still can’t figure out. The day to day sexism we either do, or entertain is not only harmful and derogatory to the women, but it is equally derogatory to us as men. I was watching Thappad and had a very brief observation of the film. Thappad is the story of women who are perfect in their work that organizes the home they’re married too. Amu, played by Taapsee, is perfect in every manner. She cooks well, she takes care of her family, she is devoted to her husband, everything is so perfect, and then when the man of the family with his toxic masculinity hits her before everyone, the whole film becomes sympathetic towards her, and her perfect activities.\n\nThough it should be praised that a film on domestic violence came into the mainstream, but what I didn’t like is the attachment of perfection and those perfection which are pleasing for the men/patriarchy of this society. That’s where we become sexists and misogynists. If Amu would’ve been a woman who goes to parties, arranges projects for her male colleagues, dances in pubs, drinks, smokes, falls under the definition of whore that patriarchy cultivated, wears shorts, follows nothing that cages her like vermilion or mangalsutra, then would the Indian society be sympathetic to her? Or forget Amu, any woman who does all of these, just because she understands that she has the freedom and the right to do all of these, does any sympathy exists in the Indian society for those women?\n\nThe things a woman does is mansplained every time by the men of this society. Be it her dressing sense, or the ideology she follows, the programmes she watches and the life she leads, all of them are seen from the eyes of men only. If something is displeasing to the eyes of a man, the society calls that inappropriate. Take for example, the idea of an independent is still asked in this society even though there’s no such thing/question for the men of this society. If a woman does something that’s just like a man, then the society gets furious, even the feminists become angry because to them a woman should not behave or fall under the criteria of men to be independent. The thing is she isn’t copying a man. She’s just doing the things she feels frees her wings. All of these freedom are enjoyed by men, so it would naturally appear that a woman is trying to be a men. Ironically, she’s a woman and she’s adopting the style that’s not at all designed by men of this society.\n\nFrom attachment of pink with women, to tight tops, from red lipstick to glittering designs, all of them are the products of pure sexism, and also because these things are legit from the eyes of a man. A woman isn’t asked whether she likes pink or not, but the society has decided pink is for women. Similarly, visit a mall and all the tops you’d see for women happen to tighter because the design has been forced upon the women over centuries. From the Anarkali dress to humungous robes, women were never asked about their choice. Instead, they have always forced to fit in such dresses just because a man likes to see them draped all over. A woman could love a loose top, or the t shirt we men wear, and they wear. These are some sexism we as men propagate by judging those who wear/do whatever the hell they like to wear/do.\n\nSo, Thappad to me wasn’t good or feminist because it was meant for the perfect women of this society which is hard to find in a society where women are fighting for equal space in their workplace. It is hard to find a slave like Amu in a world where women are not holding themselves in the kitchen or in cleaning the clothes of their husbands. It isolated the advocate of Amu, yet she stood up because of her privilege. There are middle class women who are breaking rules, becoming single mothers, and setting fire on the moral codes of this society. Thappad wasn’t their story because all of their acts are not at all appropriate or perfect for the patriarchy of this society. Netra Jaysingh, played by Maya Sarao, was also the perfect woman, with a perfect job, and a perfect status with just an imperfect husband. The film deals with perfect people. Not with those who are not that privileged, but still are pretty liberal in their attitude. It doesn’t tell their story because to the society since they’re not from the privileged status, so their freedom is whorish, and offensive to the maryada and sabhyata of this society.\n\nThe problem with the industry still remains just like with the society. To both the platforms, a woman who drinks is either a slut or a single woman who hates men. A woman who breaks moral codes is still not a woman who can be a good mother or a good professional. A woman who has multiple affairs still is not a good woman even though it is her choice, not of anyone else’s. A woman who thinks outside the box still has to earn a man’s respect to be acknowledged by the rest. A woman still has to crave for a man to get some existence. A woman still has to fall under every criteria a man wants her to fall into to live in this society. We still think her freedom as an imperfection that needs a limit. We still think that her way of life should be according to our definition. Those who break them, their stories aren’t told, and even if someone dared to make anything about them, they’re not shown by those who wear the moral fabric of an already rotten patriarchal society."
