        "text": "A historic marker to honor the victims killed in a racially motivated Dollar General shooting last year is planned for the Grand Park neighborhood.\n\nJacksonville’s City Council is expected to discuss an emergency request Wednesday for the marker to be installed before the end of the month.\n\nIf approved, the marker would be installed one day before the one-year anniversary of the hate-fueled crime.\n\nThe installation is currently planned for Aug. 25 at the intersection of Kings Road and Canal Street, which is a half block away from the store.\n\nCity Councilwoman Ju’Coby Pittman, who represents the district where the shooting happened, is the sponsor of the bill.\n\nThe marker is already paid for from money set aside by the Parks and Quality Life Special Commmittee, which is used for park improvements.\n\nEach district had $10,000 set aside for that.\n\nThe inscription of the marker includes the date of the shooting and says “Lives Lost.”\n\nA part of the inscription reads: “These victims were more than just names, they were beloved family members, friends, and members of our community. Their achievements and legacies stand as a testament to their character and resilience.”\n\nThe three people murdered were Angela Carr, A.J. Laguerre Jr. and Jerrald Gallion.\n\nThe FBI determined the attack was a racially motivated hate crime.\n\nThe gunman killed himself.\n\nThe store reopened in January."
