        "text": "Grand Council Treaty #3’s overall goal is the protection, preservation and enhancement of Treaty and Aboriginal rights.\n\nThe Grand Council Treaty #3 existed in the territory of the Anishinaabe Nation, key to Canadian Confederation in that the British wanted to plan a route between Fort Garry and Fort William (now Winnipeg, MB and Thunder Bay, ON respectively).\n\nGrand Council Treaty #3 was planned to be the first post-Confederation treaty, but the Anishinaabe held firm that they would not cede lands, nor allow farming or settlement, in their territory. On October 3, 1873, the 55,000 square miles of territory agreed to be shared between the Anishinaabe and the British.\n\nThe Chiefs negotiated, among other things, that British “business” would be allowed within the entire territory, and that both the land and resources would be shared between Anishinaabe and the British as “brothers.”\n\nFrancis Kavanaugh was re-elected as Grand Chief “Ogichidaa” of the Anishinaabe Nation in Treaty #3 by a Traditional Selection Process on October 3, 2023. This is the first time a Grand Chief was selected for a fourth term to serve the citizens of Grand Council Treaty #3. Ogichidaa Kavanaugh from Naotkamegwanning First Nation is currently serving his third consecutive term and his fourth term all together.\n\nOgichidaa Kavanaugh was honoured by the traditional selection process, and acknowledges the trust and responsibility placed on him by the leadership of Treaty #3. Ogichidaa Kavanaugh has been involved with Grand Council Treaty #3 for over 45 years, and previously served as Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3 from 1997-1999 during which time he was instrumental in the Treaty #3 Governance Initiative.\n\nThroughout his career, Francis has held a variety of positions within the Nation including, Executive Director at Grand Council Treaty #3, Ojibway Tribal Family Services and a few terms on Council in his home community of Naotkamegwanning.\n\nOgichidaa Kavanaugh commits to working with the administration and the leadership of Grand Council Treaty #3 to address current challenges of mental health and addiction, housing, policing, child welfare and educational inequities facing member First Nation communities, while honouring our sacred responsibilities to the land and the water.\n\nCouncils are a very important part of the governance structure of Grand Council Treaty #3. They bring the history of the past and the knowledge of the future. They are also the connection to ensure balance and equality for Gitiziminan (Elders), Oshkiniigig (Youth), Mizi’iwe Aana Kwat (2SLGBTQQIA+), Gaagiidoo-Ikwewag (Women) and Mamawichi-Gabowitaa-Ininiwag (Men) in the Treaty #3 Anishinaabe Nation.\n\nEach Council consists of Treaty #3 Anishinaabe members elected through a traditional selection process which represent each of the four (4) directions for their expertise, skills and traditional knowledge. Their primary role is to bring the history, unique needs and most importantly, the voice of Elders, Women, Men and Youth from the people, to the people."
