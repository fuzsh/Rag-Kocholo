        "text": "Primary Elections are held so that voters registered with a qualified political party may select their party's nominees to the general election for partisan offices. Because a primary is a party election, only voters registered with one of the parties qualified to conduct a primary in New York City may vote in their party's primary.\n\nGeneral Elections are held to elect candidates to public offices. For partisan offices, nominees from the party primary elections appear on the ballot, along with independent candidates.\n\nSigning a petition is an important way to participate in the electoral process.\n\nIn New York State, most candidates get on the ballot by filing a petition containing a specified number of signatures. The required amount varies, depending on the office sought and whether the candidate is seeking a party nomination or a spot on the ballot as an independent. Some candidates are nominated by political committees and conventions.\n\nOnly enrolled party members living within the appropriate district may sign petitions for candidates who seek their party's nomination. However, any registered voter living within the appropriate district may sign a petition for a candidate seeking to run as an independent in the general election as long as s/he has not already signed on behalf of another candidate.\n\nThe State Legislature and/or City Council can place Proposals, Questions, and Referendum measures on the ballot for New York City voters to adopt a change in the State Constitution, change a law or approve the expenditure of funds without legislative actions. In addition, a Measure can be placed on the ballot if it meets certain legal requirements and if proponents show public support by collecting signatures of at least five percent (5%) of the city's registered voters."
