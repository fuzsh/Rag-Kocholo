        "text": "Last Updated March 4, 2024\n\nCheck Your Registration and Party Affiliation Online\n\nIf you are currently registered to vote in Clark County, NV, log in to Registered Voter Services and select View My Registration Information from the dropdown menu to quickly see your registration data, including your party affiliation, voting eligibility in a specific election, polling place, precinct, elected officials (with contact information), and address on record on record with the Election Department.\n\nFederal/State Primary Elections (CLOSED),\n\nEven-Numbered Year\n\nWhat Is a Primary Election\n\nA Primary Election is a preliminary (nominating) election to select, when necessary, Democratic, Republican, and nonpartisan candidates who will run in the General Election contests (except candidates for special district offices, who will only appear in the General Election). The direct vote of the people selects the candidates, rather than the votes of convention delegates.\n\nNevada Is a CLOSED Primary Election State\n\nIn Nevada, Federal/State Primary Elections are \"CLOSED.\" That means if you chose Democrat or Republican as your party in your Voter Registration, you may vote only for candidates from your own party and you may also vote in nonpartisan contests. If you chose a party affiliation other than Democrat or Republican, you may vote only in nonpartisan contests.\n\nFederal/State General Elections,\n\nEven-Numbered Years\n\nCandidates who receive the most votes in a General Election are elected to office. You may vote for all offices and questions on the ballot for your precinct, regardless of your party affiliation.\n\nPresidential Preference Primaries in Nevada,\n\nPresidential Election Years\n\nAB126 of the 2021 legislative session established Presidential Preference Primaries. Starting in 2024, Nevada will have a Presidential Preference Primary (PPP) as part of the nationwide process to choose the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates for the November General Election ballot. You may only vote for candidates from your own party (the party you specified in your voter registration). The first Tuesday in February in presidential election years is the date for the PPP. In 2024, it will be February 6. Candidates whose party affiliation is anything other than Democratic or Republican cannot participate in the PPP. These candidates will go directly to the General Election ballot. For more information, contact the Secretary of State's office."
