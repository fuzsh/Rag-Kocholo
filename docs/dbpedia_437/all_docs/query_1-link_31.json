        "text": "GENESEE COUNTY, MI -- Voters have set the stage for November in Michigan House of Representatives districts that include at least some portion of Genesee County, according to unofficial results.\n\nJust three of the seven House races had contested primary elections on Tuesday, Aug. 6, and a fourth contest involving a write-in candidate wonâ€™t be officially settled until the county Board of Canvassers reviews results to determine if Democrat Matt Schlinker recorded enough write-in support to include him on the Nov. 5 general election ballot.\n\nIn contested races on Tuesday, incumbent Cynthia R. Neeley defeated challenger Michael Clack in the District 70 Democratic primary, state Rep. Brian BeGole defeated primary challenger Kevin Rathbun in the Republican primary in District 71, and incumbent Phil Green turned back two GOP challengers in District 67.\n\nThings are more complicated in House District 68, where incumbent David W. Martin was unopposed in the Republican Party, and the late Tim Sneller, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary, collected more than 6,000 votes in Genesee County despite having died weeks before the election.\n\nSchlinker ran a write-in campaign on Tuesday, hoping to collect at least 5% of the votes cast by Democratic voters in the district.\n\nIf he did, Schlinkerâ€™s name will appear as the Democrat standard bearer against Martin in the general election.\n\nUnofficial county results show more than 16% of voters in the Democratic primary wrote in a candidate for the position in the district, but the county Board of Canvassers will review those results to determine how many of those votes went to Schlinker, a former Flint City Council member, according to county Clerk-Register Domonique Clemons.\n\nHere are the other results from other area state House races:\n\nIn District 67, with 99% of the vote counted, Green advanced to the general election by winning the Republican primary with more than 77% of the vote, according to results from the Associated Press.\n\nGreen defeated fellow Republicans Sherri Cross and Sherry Marden on Tuesday and will face Democrat Anissa Buffin, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary, on Nov. 5.\n\nThe 67th District includes the northeast corner of Genesee County, including Richfield Township and the village of Otisville.\n\nIn District 69, which includes the Flushing and Mt. Morris areas, Democrat Jasper Ryan Martus and Republican Patrick Duvendeck were unopposed in the primary election and will face off in the general election.\n\nIn District 70, Neeley will face Republican Rob Waskoviak in November after defeating Flint Community Schools Board of Education member Michael Clack on Tuesday.\n\nWith 83% of the vote counted, the AP projected Neeley as the winner after she received more than 60% of the Democratic votes from the district, which includes all of the city of Flint.\n\nIn District 71, the AP projected BeGole to best Rathbun in the Republican primary after the incumbent received 7,265 votes compared to 3,550 votes for Rathbun with 97% of ballots having been counted.\n\nThe victory means BeGole in the November general election will go up against Democrat Mark D. Zacharda, who faced no opposition from his political party on Tuesday.\n\nIn District 72, incumbent Republican Mike Mueller, R-Linden, and Democrat John Dolza each advanced to the general election after having been unopposed in Tuesdayâ€™s primary.\n\nIn District 97, Democrat Mark Putnam will face Republican Matthew Bierlein in the general election. Both candidates were unopposed in their primary elections."
