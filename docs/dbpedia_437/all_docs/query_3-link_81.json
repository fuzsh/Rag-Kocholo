        "text": "Every elected official and public employee who makes or influences governmental decisions is required to submit a Statement of Economic Interest, also known as the Form 700. The Form 700 provides transparency and ensures accountability in two ways:\n\nThe FPPC is available to answer any questions you may have on Form 700 reporting or filing. However, in order to better assist you, you should obtain your “disclosure category.” A disclosure category is a description of the types of financial interests you must disclose on your Form 700 based on your job classification or position. Each agency defines its own disclosure categories for each position based on the type and scope of work performed.\n\nThe guidelines provided in the following document apply to individuals whose Form 700 is forwarded to the FPPC. The FPPC receives Form 700s from certain state and local elected officials, judges, high level state employees, and certain employees for the California Assembly and Senate. If a public official fails to timely file his or her Form 700, the case will be referred to the FPPC Enforcement Division, and a penalty of up to $5,000 may be imposed. File on time!\n\nForm 700 Late Fine Guidelines\n\nCertain public employees, such as auditors, may be eligible to file an abbreviated version of the Form 700. Check your agency’s conflict of interest code regarding your eligibility to file the Form 700-A.\n\nOnly researchers employed by the University of California or California State University may file a Form 700-U.\n\nIf you need to file an amendment for a previous year you must be sure to use the correct version of the Form 700. Below are the last seven versions."
