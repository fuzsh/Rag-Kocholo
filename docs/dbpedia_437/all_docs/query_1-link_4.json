        "text": "The Council for National Policy (CNP) is a right-wing 501(c)(3) nonprofit group that has been described as \"a little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country\"[1] and \"a hyper-secretive Christian Right powerhouse that helps set the movement’s agenda\".[2] Anne Nelson's book about CNP, Shadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right, describes how the organization connects \"the manpower and media of the Christian right with the finances of Western plutocrats and the strategy of right-wing Republican political operatives.”[3]\n\n\"The CNP describes itself as a counterweight against liberal domination of the American agenda,\" reported ABC News.[4]\n\nCNP's membership is comprised of leaders in the family values, national defense and decency movements woven by members of the Dead Billionaires Club like the Adolph Coors Foundation, the Koch brothers, Richard DeVos, Richard Scaife and other billionaires and foundations who have invested heavily in developing a complex web of far-Right groups, think-tanks and politicians over the last forty years to return the United States to its pre Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 19th century capitalist roots.[5]\n\nBarry W. Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told the New York Times about the CNP meeting ahead of the 2004 Republican National Convention, \"The real crux of this is that these are the genuine leaders of the Republican Party, but they certainly aren't going to be visible on television next week.\"[6]\n\n\"Utah Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Holland said that the Council for National Policy meeting gives [the public] 'a rare opportunity to see - or more accurately not see - what Republicans are all about. And that is how policy is influenced in this country by what amounts to a secret society of far-right-wing conservatives and religious extremists.'\" [7]\n\nMission\n\nCNP describes itself as, \"A united conservative movement to assure policy leadership and governance that restores religious and economic freedom, a strong national defense, and Judeo-Christian values under the Constitution.\" [8]\n\nNews and Controversies\n\nCNP Received $210,000 From Political Committees FEC Records Show\n\n\"Since 2004, political committees have disbursed $210,000 to the Council for National Policy,\" FEC records reviewed by Forbes detail.[9]\n\n\"The most-recent pay out came from the PAC that arose out of the congressional campaign of former Secretary of Health and Human Service Tom Price. It donated $5,000 to the CNP in February,\" Forbes reported.\n\nCMD Reveals Funders and Agenda of CNP's 40th Anniversary Celebration\n\nIn May 2021, CNP celebrated its 40th Anniversary at the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, Florida with a Black Tie Gala following its spring meeting.[10]\n\nAt the meeting, CNP awarded its “Lantern of Liberty” award to Republican lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a Big Lie fueler and Trump legal advisor who lost her job following news that she participated in a January call in which Trump asked Georgia election officials to “find” votes to overturn the results and make him the winner of the state’s electoral votes.[10]\n\nEdwin Feulner, founder and former president of The Heritage Foundation, delivered the keynote address that the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) obtained and published.[11]\n\nThe full agenda of CNP 40th Anniversary Meeting is available here.\n\nThe Council for National Policy 40th Anniversary Funders are:[10]\n\nLinda Bean, heiress to the L.L. Bean company\n\nBob Burckle, president, Eastern European Mission\n\nDon Campion, founder and president, Banyan Air Service\n\nPeggy Dau, Iran Alive Ministries\n\nDiana Denman, president, The Reagan Legacy Forum\n\nVivian Noble DuBose, president and CEO, Noble Properties Inc.\n\nRichard Hayes, partner, Hayes, Berry, White & Vanzant, LLP\n\nAllen Herbert, chairman, American-Chinese Fellowship of Houston\n\nGeorge Hiller, president and CEO, George M.

Many former and current CNP members also have ties to hate groups.[12][13]\n\nFormer CNP Board of Governors member Michael Peroutka also served on the board of League of the South, a neo-Confederate, white supremacist hate group.[12]\n\nFormer CNP Board of Governors member Joseph Farah runs the online news platform WorldNetDaily, which has heavily promoted The Pink Swastika, a book which argues that Adolph Hitler and other members of Nazi leadership were gay, and that homosexuality was a major cause of Nazi atrocities.[12]\n\nCNP Board of Governors member Mathew Staver, who is also the board chairman and founder of hate group Liberty Counsel, which \"has worked for the re-criminalization of gay sex, described the Boy Scouts as a 'playground for pedophiles', and likened LGBT activists to terrorists.\"[12]\n\nCNP member Brigitte Gabriel has called Muslims a threat to the civilized world and claimed a practicing Muslim 'cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.'\" She is the the founder of ACT for America, \"an anti-Muslim hate group that operates a network of chapters across the U.S. that disparage Islam and promote Islamophobic legislation at the state and national level.\"[13]\n\nAs described by the SPLC, Gabriel and other CNP members \"enjoyed unprecedented access to the White House under Trump, meeting with his staff on numerous occasions. The Trump administration implemented policies long promoted by the anti-Muslim network, such as the Muslim ban and a low cap on refugees.\"[13]\n\nCNP member Tony Perkins, who is also president of the anti-LGBTQ hate group Family Research Council, has falsely claimed that pedophilia is \"a homosexual problem” and that gay people “recruit” children.[12] In 2001, he spoke for the white supremacist hate group Council of Conservative Citizens.[12] Perkins has also said \"Islam is not a religion... it is a comprehensive system which is incompatible with the Constitution.\"[13]\n\nPerkins served as president of CNP in 2012 and from 2015-2019 and as vice president in 2013-2014. Like Gabriel, he \"enjoyed extensive access to the Trump administration.\"[13]\n\nFormer AG Bill Barr Criticizes \"Secular-Progressive\" Public School Climate at Council for National Policy Annual Meeting\n\nOn May 20, 2021, during CNP's Annual Meeting, former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr received the Alliance Defending Freedom's annual Edwin Meese III Award for Originalism and Religious Liberty.[14]\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Barr criticized the \"increasingly militant and extreme secular-progressive climate of our state-run education system\", which he called the \"greatest threat to religious liberty in America today.\" He described how some schools teach children they can express whichever gender identity (or lack thereof) they wish, without anyone else having a say. A lesson such as this, he said, \"does not just contradict particular religious teachings on gender and the authority of parents; it is a broadside attack on the very idea of natural law, which is integral to the moral doctrines of a number of religious denominations.\"[14]\n\nBarr also criticized Critical Race Theory (CRT), which he called \"nothing more than the materialist philosophy of Marxism substituting racial antagonism for class antagonism.\" CRT, according to Barr \"is fundamentally incompatible with Christianity\" and \"antithetical to the Christian view.\"[14]\n\nBarr argued that \"secular-progressivism\" should be seen as a religion and be given the same Constitutional protections and prohibitions as other faith traditions. He asked, \"how is it Constitutional to have a state-run school system fervently devoted to teaching little else? And how on earth can these same institutions be allowed to use the state to punish traditional religious doctrines as hate speech?\"[14]\n\nBarr concluded his speech arguing in favor of vouchers, saying they \"would also promote all kinds of diversity in our schools— diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, and ways of thinking... a universal voucher system would solve some of our most intractable and contentious social problems.\"[14]\n\nCurrent and Former CNP Members Organize Protests Alleging Voter Fraud in 2020 Election\n\nCurrent and former members of the Council for National Policy organized and promoted so-called \"Stop the Steal\" protests in order to build a movement to question the legitimacy of the 2020 Election, the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) reported.[15] The #StoptheSteal site was created by Ali Alexander aka Ali Akbar, a Pro-Trump influencer on Twitter with over 140,000 followers and a former CNP member. On Twitter, Alexander identified \"patriots\" he is working with to \"save the election,\" many of whom are members.\n\nFor example, Amy Kremer, chair of Women for America First and co-founder of Women for Trump, led protests in Georgia and Michigan. Women for Trump’s co-founder Caroline Wetherington is a member of the CNP. Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, is listed as an organizer of the Arizona protests, and is a CNP member. Ed Martin, president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, listed by Alexander as a partner, is also a member of the CNP.[15]\n\nFreedomWorks, led by president Adam Brandon, who also serves on the advisory council for Turning Point USA and the CNP Action Board of Directors, also organized “Protect the Vote” protests in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Oklahoma.[15]\n\nTea Party Patriots Action also announced that it was “working with FreedomWorks, Turning Points, Heritage, and countless social media influencers” to promote and hold “Protect the Vote” rallies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. TPPA’s honorary chairman Jenny Beth Martin serves on the CNP Executive Committee and a number of those working at the Heritage Foundation are also CNP members.[15]\n\n15 CNP Members Attend Amy Coney Barrett's White House Rose Garden Ceremony\n\nAt least 15 CNP members attended a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House where Amy Coney Barrett accepted Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court, the Associated Press reported.[16] \"Among the other Council for National Policy members on hand for the Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony was Penny Nance, the head of Concerned Women for America, which ran a monthlong Women for Amy bus tour that hit events in 12 states aimed at boosting support for Trump’s nominee. Also in the Rose Garden crowd was Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group helping mobilize voters for Trump. Dannenfelser is listed in the 'Gold Circle Member' in the Council directory,\" Biesecker and Slodysko wrote.\n\n“CNP has been strategizing to dominate the Supreme Court for decades,” said Anne Nelson, a Columbia University researcher who wrote a book on the group. “They have worked through the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association, all run by members of the CNP.\"[16]\n\nVice President Mike Pence Thanks CNP for \"Consistently Amplifying the Agenda of President Trump\n\nMike Pence wrote a letter to CNP's President Bill Walton on March 30, 2020 thanking him for supporting Trump and his administration. The letter wrote, \"In these difficult days for our Nation and our world, faced with the unprecedented challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, I just wanted to thank you and the Council for National Policy for your support and for consistently amplifying the agenda of President Trump and our Administration.\"[17]\n\nBlumenthal's Grayzone Exposed CNP's 2018 Membership List\n\nIn August 2020, Max Blumenthal published Council for National Policy's full 2018 member list in The Grayzone, commenting \"The CNP’s personnel comprise a blend of conservative movement leaders, industry moneymen, foreign policy hardliners, and culture war activists enforcing right-wing unity at the base of a Republican Party that has cohered around the doctrine of ultra-nationalist Trumpism.\"[2]\n\nTrump's Connections to CNP\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke for about one hour at CNP's 2020 annual meeting.[18] CNP's 2014 membership directory listed Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, both of whom served as Trump's counselors, as members of the organization.[19]\n\nMike Pence Membership and Evangelical Turnout Strategy Using Scare Tactics\n\nCenter for National Policy's campaigns use scare tactics on issues like abortion and LGBTQ rights to politically engage conservative Christians. A 2019 piece by Shadow Network author Anne Nelson described Vice President Mike Pence's membership in CNP as well as the group's strategy to identify and turnout \"some 17 million politically unengaged evangelicals, many concentrated in swing states\" by telling them falsehoods such as \"Democrats will 'execute babies on the day of their birth'\" and that \"schoolchildren face a mortal danger of sexual assault by transgender people using public restrooms.\"[20]\n\nCNP Secret Meeting to Discuss Strategy After Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Confirmation\n\nCNP members met for a three-day retreat during Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process. As described by The Intercept, \"The agenda for the event featured a veritable who’s who of Christian conservatives, including Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Justice Clarence Thomas; U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley; former Sen. Jim DeMint, the former president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank; pollster Frank Luntz; and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio...\" Other attendees included T. Cullen Davis, Herman Cain, Bob McEwen, representatives from Family Research Council, and presenters from Faith and Freedom Coalition.[21]\n\nSPLC Exposed CNP's 2014 Member List and Group's Mix of Mainstream and Extremist Conservatives\n\nIn 2016, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) obtained a copy of CNP's 2014 membership directory.[12] SPLC described the group's membership, saying: \"The 2014 CNP members are paragons of the conservative establishment. There are business titans, Christian college presidents, owners and editors of right-wing media outlets, GOP mega-donors, government staffers and leading members of conservative think tanks. There are officials of organizations like the National Rifle Association and the Federalist Society. There are politicians and political appointees, anti-abortion activists and also some who are less known publicly as conservatives, like Linda L. Bean, who owns L.L. Bean Inc., an outdoorsy clothing company.\n\nBut what is most remarkable about the directory is that it reveals how the CNP has become a key meeting place where ostensibly mainstream conservatives interact with individuals who are, by any reasonable definition, genuinely extremist.\"[12]\n\nRigid Secrecy Rules Regarding Guests and Communication with the Media\n\nCNP maintains strict secrecy rules for its members, who \"are told not to discuss the group, reveal the topics discussed in the closed-door meetings, or even say whether or not they are members of the organization.\"[22] A 2014 memorandum listed CNP's full set of rules:[12]\n\nSpecial guests may attend only with advance unanimous approval of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe solicitation of funds on a one-to-one basis is prohibited at meetings.\n\nCouncil meetings are closed to the media and the general public. The media should not know when or where we meet or who takes part in our programs, before or after a meeting.\n\nSpeakers' remarks at Council meetings are off the record and not for circulation later, except with special permission.\n\nMembers and guests are requested to keep in their personal possession their registration packets and other materials distributed at the meeting.\n\nOur membership list is strictly confidential and should not be shared outside the Council.\n\nFundraising from the list is also prohibited.\n\nHistory and Founding\n\nAs reported by ABC News, \"CNP was conceived in 1981 by at least five fathers, including the Rev. Tim LaHaye, an evangelical preacher who was then the head of the Moral Majority. (LaHaye is the co-author of the popular Left Behind series that predicts and subsequently depicts the Apocalypse). Nelson Baker Hunt, billionaire son of billionaire oilman H.L. Hunt (connected to both the John Birch Society and to Ronald Reagan's political network), businessman and one-time murder suspect T. Cullen Davis, and wealthy John Bircher William Cies provided the seed money.\"[23] The report also notes how \"Christian activist Paul Weyrich took responsibility for bringing together the best minds of conservatism, and his imprint on the group's mission is unmistakable: It provided a forum for religiously engaged conservative Christians to influence the geography of American political power.\"[23]\n\nA 2020 New Republic book review of Anne Nelson's Shadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right retells the story of CNP's founding: \"In 1981, Weyrich, Viguerie, LaHaye, Republican functionary Morton Blackwell, anti-feminist lawyer Phyllis Schlafly, oil scion Nelson Bunker Hunt, beer magnate Joseph Coors, and some 50 other conservatives began meeting every Wednesday morning in Viguerie’s handsome Virginia home. It was there that they founded the Council for National Policy. The CNP was deliberately modeled after the Council on Foreign Relations, a prestigious nonprofit think tank with thousands of prominent members and deep connections to America’s foreign policy elite. Similarly, the CNP focused early on international affairs, presenting Oliver North with a special award “for national defense” and inviting far-right Salvadoran death squad leader Roberto D’Aubuisson to give a talk. It also sought tax-exempt status, citing the group’s similarity to the CFR. And though membership in the CNP was likewise highly exclusive and by invitation only, Nelson wryly notes that its 1982 executive committee included Richard Shoff, 'former state secretary of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan.'\"[3]\n\nCNP Action, Inc.\n\nAccording to CNP's website, \"CNP Action, Inc. is the 501(c)(4) sister organization of the Council for National Policy. Founded in 1987, CNP Action, Inc. serves as an advocate for conservative principles such as limited government, free economic enterprise, traditional values and a strong national defense. It promotes issues or specific pieces of legislation through regular Action Sessions and publications.\"[24] Beginning in April 2020, this organization began involved with strategies to reopen U.S. states despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[25][26]\n\nCNP Action Organized \"Pro-Trump\" Doctors To Legitimate Reopening Efforts\n\nAssociated Press reported on a May 2020 conference call between CNP Action and a senior staffer for Trump's reelection campaign, originally obtained by Center for Media and Democracy. In the leaked meeting, these operatives discussed \"recruiting 'extremely pro-Trump' doctors to go on television to prescribe reviving the U.S. economy as quickly as possible\" despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.[25] When asked about these efforts by AP, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh asserted he took no issue with contradicting the government's infectious disease experts. Murtaugh explained, \"Our job at the campaign is to reflect President Trump’s point of view... We are his campaign. There is no difference between us and him.\"[25]\n\nCNP Action Helped Coordinate COVID-19 Lockdown Protests\n\nIn April 2020, CNP Action \"hosted weekly conference calls to coordinate coronavirus response tactics\", working together with organizations including FreedomWorks, Open the States, ReOpen PA, The Save Our Country Task Force, and Tea Party Patriots.[26] The stated goal of Tea Party Patriots was to \"share the stories of people who have been affected by the lockdowns, to show that we must be concerned with both sides of this crisis.\"[26]\n\nCNP also shared information through email about attending in-person events, including an Eagle Forum-organized car protest at the Alabama Capitol Building and a lockdown protest at the Pennsylvania state capitol.[26]\n\nTies to the Bradley Foundation\n\nThrough 2018 Council for National Policy received $485,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. As of September 2020, Bradley president and CEO Richard Graber was a CNP Board of Governors member.[8][27]\n\nTies to the American Legislative Exchange Council\n\nAs of 2020, Lisa Nelson, the CEO of ALEC, was a CNP member.[8]\n\nAbout ALEC\n\nALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve “model” bills.
