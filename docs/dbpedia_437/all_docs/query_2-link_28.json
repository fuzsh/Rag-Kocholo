        "text": "San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, and occasionally \"The Most Serene Republic of San Marino\", is a sovereign state in the North of the Italian Peninsula.\n\nHistory[]\n\nGreat Nuclear War []\n\nSan Marino was not a member of the NATO, and it wasn't aligned neither with NATO or also with the Warsaw Pact, so for thing things and others; like his population San Marino wasn't hitted by the nuclear bombs, and the surrender area wasn't hitted also that. The only place at be hitted in Italy it was Rome, who was the capital of Italy.\n\nRight after the nuclear war the Capitan Regents have a open a reunion of the Parliament with the military chief of San Marino it was decide of make stock of supply for the winter, send group of scouts out the territory of the Republic and with the help of the 30 Carabinieri present in the Republic for explore the territory outside, after the first week of scouting it was discover that the Italian countryside wasn't hit and Tuscany and Marche wans't in a status of chaos.\n\nIn the 67' after some time years of stability and grown their own economy some Gendarme have encounter a pilot of the Italian Air Force who have crushed with his airplane, the pilot was made a recon mission over the province of Rimini for knowing what remain of that area and if was free for be annexed by the Italian Republic. After have contact the Italian Government at Turin with the help of the Tuscans the pilot was send back at home, with the help of the Italians they have been at knowing of the Mob State in south Italy, of the spread of Communism in the Romagna and of Sicily. San Marino now have an ambassy in all the Italian states, exept for the Neapolitan Republic, the two nations have rocky relations with the Mafia state.\n\nIn the decades after the war the economy have grown and also population, from the 16.197 of 1962 to the 20,681 of the 1972, also in that years from the 5,000 to the 15,000 peoples take refuge in the Republic, most of this refugees decide to become a citizens of the Republic, only few of that decide to go in other parts of Italy.\n\nIn the 80s' San Marino economy begain to focused on banking sector and on international tourism, also with the annession of the Romagna by the Italian Republic borders on northern return in a normal state (Before was militarized) and with the 2/3 of the border on Italy the security for the republic is newly entrusted at the Italian Armed Forces.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the Captains Regent are both heads of state and heads of government, and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government.\n\nLegislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council. The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts correspond to the old parishes of the republic.\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the Captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\nAdministrative divisions[]\n\nSan Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as castelli (meaning \"castles\").\n\nSan Marino is the capital.\n\nThere are also eight minor municipalities:\n\nAcquaviva\n\nBorgo Maggiore\n\nChiesanuova\n\nDomagnano\n\nFaetano\n\nFiorentino\n\nMontegiardino\n\nSerravalle\n\nMilitary[]\n\nSan Marino has one of the smallest military forces in the world. National defence is responsibility of Guard of the Rock and by the Gendarmerie. Different branches have varied functions, including : performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the Military of San Marino.\n\nCrossbow Corps[]\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately eighty volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform is medieval in design. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today and is composed by 100 members.\n\nGuard of the Rock[]\n\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national Government, they are also the most great branch of the armed forces with 250 guards.\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.\n\n= Guard of the Council Great and General[]\n\nThe Guard of the Council Great and General commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the 'Guard of Nobles', formed in 1740, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the Captains Regent, and to defend the Great and General Council during its formal sessions. They also provide a ceremonial bodyguard to government officials on festivals of both state and church, it have 20 guards.\n\nThe Company of Uniformed Militia[]\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial.
