The Subcommittee seeks to identify risks associated with procurement, development and deployment of AI-enabled technologies, including compliance, data privacy, bias, security, and ethical risks; interpret UC’s risk appetite related to those risks; design a framework for assessing and monitoring those risks; and, time permitting, pilot the framework on a select set of AI-enabled technologies."
