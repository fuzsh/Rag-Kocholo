        "text": "“The music I make now is mine because I believe it and it’s true,” he says. “That’s what I can\n\ncontribute, and that’s how I see myself fitting in. The currency of the realm is authenticity, and I\n\nthink there’s room for mine.” That’s something he proved with back-to-back #1s that put him in the forefront of this era’s songwriters, and he proves it again with One Of Us, an EP that establishes him an artist of real depth and vision.\n\nThe breakthrough came with the 2X PLATINUM “Prayed For You,” the only debut single to top\n\nthe Billboard Country Airplay chart in 2019. The PLATINUM follow-up, “Everywhere But On,”\n\nmade him one of just a handful of new artists to hit the top twice in a row in six years. In the\n\nprocess, he racked up more than half a BILLION total global streams across his catalog while\n\nsurpassing 27 million views alone for the official music video for “Prayed For You.”\n\nHe quickly became one of his generation’s busiest and most visible artists, appearing on Good\n\nMorning America, The Kelly Clarkson Show, Bachelor in Paradise, and The Late Show with\n\nStephen Colbert’s #LateShowMeMusic digital series. Along the way, he performed the national\n\nanthem for major NFL and NASCAR events, plus debuted at the Grand Ole Opry with about 150\n\nfriends and family members in attendance from his hometown.\n\nOne Of Us, the six-song collection that is the latest step in his musical journey, shows Stell at his\n\ncreative best, with songs that bring alive a landscape of small-town dreams, friendship, love, and\n\nheartbreak. The title track is an anthem for those who share and celebrate the day-to-day realities\n\nof small-town life. “Man Made” honors the strength and inspiration provided by the woman behind\n\neven the most accomplished man, and “Somewhere Over The Radio” deals with the siren call of\n\nleaving to pursue dreams bigger than a hometown, “about how hard that decision is, and the\n\npeople you leave behind but really take with you wherever you go.”"
