Guest producers for Still: Volume 1, which was recorded in various locations in the UK and mastered at the legendary Abbey Road Studios, are the acclaimed Manchester, UK-based independent band Rivers & Robots.\n\nStill is emotive and reminiscent of a film score, combining strings, brass elements and electronic instrumentation, making it an ideal backdrop for moments of prayer and meditation for individuals and churches. The tracklist includes new interpretations of worship songs from artists and writers including Martin Smith, Brenton Brown, John Mark McMillan and Matt Redman as well as original compositions from Rivers & Robots. From creating an atmosphere for soaking prayer, to offering a sonic oasis during the rush hour commute, the album calls listeners to still their hearts before God.\n\n“When Integrity Music asked us if we’d like to produce the first in their series of instrumental worship albums called ‘Still,’ we jumped at the opportunity,” says Rivers & Robots frontman Jonathan Ogden. “As guys who love listening to instrumental music in those times of prayer and meditating on the Bible, we were excited by the opportunity to create that kind of album.”\n\n“We put some bare-bones ideas together over a few days and then set about recording it, working through each instrument, starting with drums, bass, guitars, piano and then extra layers like synths, strings, brass and percussion,” explains Ogden. “Every day we started with prayer, to ask God for inspiration and creativity, and to make sure that everything we played was done as an act of worship. Often worship songs are defined by their lyrics, but we’re firm believers that any form of art can be worship.” All songs are loaded and ready to use- just access your WorshipTeam.com system database.\n\nThe songs are full featured with complete lyrics, chord charts and full length audio.

Recorded live with her team at Hope Unlimited Church on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, the album is Zschech’s first project following a life changing cancer diagnosis in 2014 and features 11 new songs penned by her along with guest writers like Martin Smith, Paul Baloche, Jenn Johnson and Leeland Mooring.\n\nHere I Am Send Me is also Zschech’s first new album since 2013’s critically acclaimed Revealing Jesus. Produced by Andy Mak, the new recording opens with a full-on declaration of the greatness of God in the song “You Are Great” written with Martin Smith (Delirious?) in response to the most challenging season of her life.\n\n“When I was at my sickest, Martin flew over from England to sit with us, sing songs over our church, and walk and talk with me and my husband, all the while speaking courage into us,” Zschech says, her voice full of emotion recalling the dark days after her diagnosis of breast cancer that is now in remission. “It’s week one of treatment and you feel like you’re going to die, and Martin said, ‘Darls, I know you’re going to want to write songs about this season. What do you want to say?’ And I said, ‘I want to say ‘HE IS GREAT!’ And so we wrote this song together and have been singing it in our church. That’s where it started… In the midst of the fire, it doesn’t change who our God is.”\n\n“Cancer is a dreadful thing,” continues Zschech. “The medical world doesn’t like to use the word ‘healed.’ They like to say the word ‘remission’… but I’m believing God’s report over my life. I speak Psalm 91 over myself every day, I take my medicine and I take the word of God and I do my best with what I can do in the natural and trust God with those things over which I have no power.”\n\nFollowing this opening track, the album proceeds to take listeners through a journey declaring God’s greatness, love and call, and gives worshippers a voice of response, as in the song, “You Will Be Praised.” Written with Baloche and Johnson upon Zschech’s first return to America after cancer treatment, the song unabashedly declares the power of the Holy Spirit living among us that makes fearlessness possible in every season and circumstance of life. It is, in many ways, her testimony.\n\nThe album also features “Beloved,” a modern hymn of surrender co-written by Zschech with Mooring and Casey Moore. Other standouts include “Love and Wonder,” written by the Zschech’s teen daughter, Zoe, and Bonnie Gray from Hope UC, “Kingdom Come,” co-written with Thomas Macken and reflecting a year-long teaching theme at the church and “Go,” written with Andy Mak, that closes the album.

Lewis, Saint Patrick, John Newton, Saint Thérèse, Saint Francis, William Cowper, Saint Augustine, George MacDonald and others, mining for undiscovered gems, something to connect these individuals to modern believers.

We find ourselves standing where we always hoped we might stand—out in the wide open spaces of God’s grace and glory, standing tall and shouting our praise.” [Romans 5, 1-2, The Message]\n\nHooper, an associate pastor for LIFE Church, is a featured vocalist on the album along with LIFE’s worship leaders Mike Harvie, Eby Corydon, Chelsea Carins, Ryan Carins, Aaron Baxter and worship pastor Jock James. The songs on Wide Open Space were penned by LIFE team members, along with guest writers including Benji Cowart and Chris Sayburn.

The Voice of the Martyrs (VOM), a nonprofit that offers practical and spiritual help to persecuted Christians, has launched the “i am n” movement that has already generated over $5 million in aid for Christians who have been displaced by the self-proclaimed Islamic State known as ISIS. Now, VOM is partnering with Integrity Music and its parent organization, the 140-year old church resource provider, David C Cook, to help spread awareness of the plight of persecuted Christians around the world through a new i am n album releasing Feb. 12, and i am n book and curriculum releasing March 1.\n\nThe “i am n” movement takes its name from the symbol used by ISIS militants to target believers. It began when ISIS militants moved into northern Iraq and began identifying Christian-owned property by painting the Arabic letter ن or “n” on homes and churches. This single letter conveyed the accusation that the occupants were “Nazarenes”—followers of Jesus of Nazareth rather than Islam—giving them the ultimatum to convert to Islam and stay in the community, leave, or die.\n\nIntegrity Music worked with VOM to develop a soundtrack for the movement, featuring music from All Sons & Daughters, The Brilliance, Lincoln Brewster, Paul Baloche, Travis Ryan, New Life Worship, WorshipMob, NCC Worship, Desperation Band, Rend Collective, Israel and New Breed and newly signed Integrity worship leader, Greg Sykes. The 12-track i am n album includes the song, “We Stand As One,” performed by Sykes and written especially for the album by him along with Integrity A&R Director Steve Merkel, writer of “Lord Have Mercy,” and Dove Award winner Don Poythress, who’s also the songwriter behind country hits like Willie Nelson’s “You Remain” and Easton Corbin’s “A Little More Country Than That.”\n\nIn addition to the music, David C Cook published the book i am n: Inspiring Stories of Christians Facing Islamic Extremists along with a 90-day companion devotional and related curriculum. The i am n book shares the real-life stories of Christians holding on to their faith in the midst of violence, fear and death. Readers will be inspired, encouraged and challenged by the tremendous faith and courage of their persecuted brothers and sisters in Christ and motivated, enabled and equipped by the practical insight VOM provides at the conclusion of each story.\n\nProceeds from the sale of all “i am n” related products will be used by Voice of the Martyrs to support persecuted Iraqi and Syrian Christians, including those fleeing Syria as refugees by providing temporary shelter, medical care, food, clothing, clean drinking water and more.

Signed to Integrity last year, Robinson is a veteran musician known for his genre-bending, prophetic style of worship. Already a best-seller in stores throughout the United Kingdom and Europe, the 14-track Outrageous Love hits Christian retail stores in the U.S. and Canada on January 22. At that time, the project will also be available globally through any region served by iTunes and Amazon with an 18-track “Digital Deluxe” already available through iTunes in some regions.\n\nRecorded live at House On The Rock in north London, Outrageous Love was produced by Robinson and Goziam Okogwu, mixed by the renowned John Jaszcz (“The Yoshman”) known for his work with Kirk Frankin and Marvin Sapp, and mastered at Abbey Road studios. The album features cowrites with Israel Houghton (“Let The People Say”), Matt Redman (“He Holds Everything”), and Christine D’Clario (“Revival In Your Name”) among others, and includes a duet with UK worship leader Lara Martin on “I Worship And Adore You.”\n\nRobinson, who also has five studio albums to his credit, describes himself as a “revivalist at heart,” and his passion for spiritual revival and renewal within the larger Body of Christ and individual believers is reflected throughout Outrageous Love.\n\n“One of the components of revival is unity, and we have successfully and intentionally brought together worshippers from different cultural expressions,” says Robinson of the international and interdenominational representation found in the recording.\n\n“We have begun to see many testimonies and incredible feedback,” he continues. “So many of the songs are starting to be used in local churches… we are hoping that listeners will have a sense of the songs as powerful tools, as backdrops in their personal worship settings.” All songs are loaded and ready to use- just access your WorshipTeam.com system database.\n\nThe songs are full featured with complete lyrics, chord charts and full length audio.

The album features Christmas classics seamlessly married with vertical worship lyrics, and is an extension of Baloche’s 30-year mission in ministry to equip worshipers and worship leaders with songs and resources that help them express glory to God.\n\nFor singer/songwriter Paul Baloche, writer of worship standards like “Open The Eyes Of My Heart,” “Hosanna,” “Our God Saves,” “Your Name” and “A New Hallelujah,” Christmas is a season of worship. With Christmas Worship, Baloche is aiming higher than nostalgia; higher than recreating the sounds of the season.\n\n“There is so much content and beauty and theology in a song like ‘Hark the Herald Angels Sing’ and ‘What Child Is This?,’ but most of these traditional carols are not vertical in nature; not speaking to the Lord,” says Baloche. “‘O Holy Night’ is a perfect example. At the climax, we’re singing, hands raised, to a thing, ‘Oh night divine.’ By adding a simple chorus at the end, a response to the beauty of the lyric, melody and the nostalgia of these beautiful carols, and then segueing into a first-person response in keeping with the Advent season, it’s amazing the shift in perspective.”\n\n“Paul has a genuine passion to see local church worship leaders equipped to lead their churches week in and week out,” says Adrian Thompson, ‎VP Song & Artist Development at Integrity Music. “This project comes from Paul’s desire to see local churches engaged in worship during the advent season rather than just having a season of special church music.” All songs are loaded and ready to use- just access your WorshipTeam.com system database.\n\nThe songs are full featured with complete lyrics, chord charts and full length audio.

At the heart of the new CD is a challenge, a dare to listeners to see what is possible when they boldly follow God. This message is being taken to the world with Planetshakers LIVE!, broadcasting internationally Monday, Sept. 21, at 8:30 pm ET on Daystar Television Network, which reaches into 108 million homes in the US, 10 million homes in Canada and 700 million homes worldwide – a potential viewing audience of over 2 billion people.\n\nA 90-minute special featuring new music from #LETSGO and personal “Let’s Go” stories in front of a live, invitation-only audience in Dallas, TX, Planetshakers LIVE! will be hosted by Brian Carn and John Gray (from Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church), as well as feature special guest, Gospel recording artist Tasha Cobbs.\n\nA truly global event, the broadcast will also be simulcast live to a free “Watch Party” held halfway around the world at the Church of God Dasmariñas in the Philippines, Tuesday, Sept. 22 at 8:30 am PHT. In addition to this event, the Planetshakers Live! partners are teaming up to give away #LETSGO to the live audience in the Philippines: for every album purchased on the day of the event, one will be given to an attendee in the Philippines.\n\nThe “Watch Party” location was chosen after Planetshakers heard stories of concert attendees who made significant sacrifices just to be able to travel to see them in concert.\n\n“It is inspiring, and simultaneously heartbreaking, to hear countless stories of people skipping meals so they can travel to one of our events,” shares Joth Hunt, Planetshakers worship leader, guitarist, and producer. “It’s hard to imagine someone doing that, but it just goes to show that their souls are more hungry than their bodies. That’s why we wanted to put on this special ‘watch party’ just for the people of the Philippines.” All songs are loaded and ready to use- just access your WorshipTeam.com system database.\n\nThe songs are full featured with complete lyrics, chord charts and full length audio.
