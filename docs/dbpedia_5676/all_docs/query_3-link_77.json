        "text": "It started off on a tinkling piano one day and morphed into a musical explosion the next. The project came out of lots of conversations between me and arranger/composer Louk Boudesteijn and I of “how ARE we gonna we do this?”. We wanted musical warriors and every person in this group is a beast. So when we didn’t have a project title for the project, we realized on day 1 of rehearsal it could ONLY be The Rocketeers.\n\nIt’s a little mad, layered and super rich. It was recorded live. But my soul is soothed by the end. It’s a jazz orchestra. Or a Big Band. Or none of those two things but inspired by everything from them. I want to be a part of moving that genre forward. I sing in a lot of jazz orchestras in Europe and well, I wanted my own - simply put! This was no easy task. You can’t just lightly toss a project like this together like a summer salad. It took months and months of dozens of highly caffeinated conversations and arranging. It’s different than anything I’ve ever done and as an artist trying to align with her soul in today’s world. This felt like that path.\n\nOut on GroundUP. Listen all digital stores Buy CD/vinyl\n\nFRAY the story: A visual deep dive into the delicate thread that holds love together, and how that same thread which bonds us can also be the source of our unraveling.\n\nThis is a film based on the story of an “unraveling” set in the landscape of music and lyrics written by Lucy Woodward & David Garza, in a song that was recorded at Sonic Ranch at the border of Texas and Mexico. The story opens up a conversation between the head and the heart, the heart being the wiser of the two. We witness the dialogue and dance unfold, as the head speaks in threads of ice blue, and the heart in threads of fiery orange.\n\nIt features Lucy dancing and entangled in thread, along with two dancers who have their own conversation with the thread as they are wrapped in a sweater made-for-two. The sweater is the centerpiece of the film, as it represents the heart and was designed and knitted to be “pulled” and unraveled in one take. It was directed, conceptualized and choreographed by Caroline Le Duc, who is also featured as one of the main dancers of the film. It also features renowned dancer and movement artist, Baptista Kawa who is a performing artist in Jacob Jonas The Company.\n\nAs Lucy attempts to wrap up and pack the different pieces of herself and a complicated love into boxes, she gets tangled in the truth, that love remains complexly intertwined … even when it’s unraveled. She observes the two dancers, that are moving in and out of connection, within the sweater made of the thread that binds them. Lucy not only observes the dancers and witnesses her own unraveling reflected in theirs, but more profoundly, she is the one pulling the thread.\n\nI HAD A WILD YEAR. I sang at the Tunisia Opera House and learned how to bargain with locals at the rug market. I also learned quickly that I was not particularly good at this. Vendors were quite aware of this, too and probably pitied me. Started a crazy, wild and beautiful Big Band in Europe, my 2023 adventure, where vocally I am the most colorful and expressive I have ever been. The US Embassy brought me in to work with young, devoted singers in cities such as beautiful Athens (this is really the way to learn about a culture). I sang in Romania (above photo) with 103°F fever (had Covid and didn't know it) but as Bette and Judy say, the show must go on (watch soundcheck in Romania!). Can't summarize the following quickly but: I volunteered at the Poland/Ukraine border cooking food for refugees when the war started last April. This journey was one that stuck with me the longest; still does. I think I experienced PTSD in the weeks that followed and it certainly changed my perspective on just about everything. I learned about bravery, the human spirit and how to make bread pudding for 1000 people (can’t even make bread pudding for 1). I kept thinking I would write about the kitchen but I felt I had to sort of go inward more than outward if that makes sense. Maybe one day.\n\nI just got the Master back for my 5th solo album. I listened to it twice, on 2 different headphones and 2 locations - once in my house in pajamas with coffee and the other on my bike as I casually zipped around town. One listen-through is intense, zoned in, eyes closed. The other is taking in the environment. Bridges opening and closing over canals, construction site jackhammers, babies crying.\n\nAm I background music? Do I command attention? I have no clue. But once I sign off on this album, I will never listen to it again. I’ve always done that. I don’t know if that’s weird or common. I think I read that Joni Mitchell does the same thing so I ain’t that crazy…\n\nI call this Music and Bravery because it is scary putting out an album. Terrifying, actually. This now means that people can criticize you! Bash your songs! Compare you to others! The trolls come out! Yay! (I have the best trolls ever, by the way). I know now that it’s just a part of the industry fabric and I’ve sure as hell gotten used to it. But I’m going to try and be courageous and not invite that fear in this time round ‘cause ya look for it, it’s gonna come find ya.\n\nI am planning to go to the Ukraine/Poland border this week (Przemysl to be exact) to volunteer with World Central Kitchen. I don’t know if it’s stupid or brave. But it’s in my heart so as of today, my flight is booked. I will chop vegetables and stir soup for 6 hours if I have to. I sometimes get a bit woozy with slight trepidation about going but I’m keeping an eye on every news pop-up and will decide based on what I feel the morning of my flight.\n\nPutting an album out and going into a war zone are both terrifying. And for the record, I know I don’t NEED to say this because you are intelligent people reading this: I am not comparing an album release to a war. Every image of a Ukrainian refugee slices my heart. A life boiled down to what they can fit in their backpack. What would I carry in my backpack if this was my time to run in search of a new life? So, yeah. I am thinking about my fears today and what I’m willing to put on the line. How will I put one foot in front of the other…\n\nThere is a girl next to me in a coffee shop selfie-ing away. I wonder what her bravery is behind that sassy lip gloss. At the next table, 3 girls in hijabs and Converse high tops are giggling contagiously over dessert. I wonder what their bravery is. This new album is full of songs about all of these girls. How I’ve related to them in my life growing up in NYC, on tour in Europe or watching them live a different kind of life on one of my trips to Kenya. I’m singing about all of their/our bravery.\n\nI’m going to get on my bike home now and maaaybe have 1 or 2 more listens to the new Master. This *might* be a good sign that I *think* I love my new album (did I just say that?) and for the first time in years, I am not as critical of my voice and the stories I sing. That’s my little sliver of bravery for today. Tomorrow it will hopefully be something else.\n\nPhoto by Caroline Le Duc"
