Her spine was healed and the cloud of depression was gone. She truly encountered the Lord in that moment.\n\nThrough that experience, the Lord had given her this song. But without being signed to a record label there was no hope for radio play or sharing her message, so she just put a video of her singing ‚ÄúIn Jesus Name‚Äù on the popular social media app, TikTok ‚Äì watch the viral clip below:\n\n@katynichole_ Worship with me‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüò≠ #worship #worshipleader #worshipmusic #worshipsongs #christiantiktok #christian #christianity #fypp #fyp #jesus#voiceeffects ‚ô¨ In Jesus Name God Of Possible Demo ‚Äì Katy Nichole\n\nThe video went viral and before she knew it, radio stations started playing her song before she was even signed to a record label ‚Äì how amazing is that!?\n\nKaty shared, if she could say one thing to people, it‚Äôs that God is a God of healing. God‚Äôs healed me, so I know He can heal someone else‚Äù."
