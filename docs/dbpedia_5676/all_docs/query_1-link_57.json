        "text": "Christian contemporary music inspires believers to worship through the power of music. Many faith-based movies feature songs written and performed by well-known Christian music artists. From movies that follow the lives of our favorite performers to scenes containing familiar praise tunes, these are the top 10 movies featuring Christian music, artists and songs.\n\nI CAN ONLY IMAGINE\n\nI CAN ONLY IMAGINE follows the inspiring true story behind MercyMe’s most popular Christian contemporary song of the same name. The plot centers around lead singer Bart Miller’s path to reconciliation with his abusive father after he turns his life over to Jesus. It features a solid Christian worldview and serves as a poignant reminder of the power of forgiveness through Jesus Christ. There’s no objectionable content – save for tastefully executed abusive violence. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE is a heartfelt film appropriate for the 10+ crowd.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nGOD'S NOT DEAD\n\nGOD’S NOT DEAD is a powerful evangelistic movie about a college student who challenges his philosophy professor’s curriculum when asked to sign a pledge that God is dead. Several lawsuits involving the place of Christian faith in universities inspired the plotline. It features a well-known song of the same name written and performed by the contemporary Christian band Newsboys (released in 2011). Parents should be aware of light violence that might be intense for young children. GOD’S NOT DEAD is an exceptional movie with a great soundtrack.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nI STILL BELIEVE\n\nI STILL BELIEVE is based on the inspiring true story of Christian music star Jeremy Camp’s marriage to his first wife Melissa, who is dying of cancer. It’s a story of hope during tragedy. The movie shows a very strong Christian worldview and is a shining example of sacrificial love. It contains light violence, hospital scenes and mature elements, so MOVIEGUIDE® suggests caution for younger children. I STILL BELIEVE is a wholesome film filled with inspiring praise music for teens and adults to enjoy.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nFIREPROOF\n\nKirk Cameron stars in the faith-based film FIREPROOF about a fireman whose marriage is on the rocks. He takes on a 40 Day experiment called “The Love Dare” to try to save the relationship. The film features the hit song “While I’m Waiting” by the Christian music artist John Waller. It contains a robust Christian worldview and shines a light on forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Parents should know there is light violence and some adult material but nothing overtly salacious. FIREPROOF is appropriate for kids ages 12 and up.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE JESUS MUSIC\n\nTHE JESUS MUSIC tells the untold story of Christian Contemporary Music. It features interviews with Christian musicians Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Lauren Daigle, and many more. The film focuses on the history of the Christian music genre from its beginnings in the 1960s to the present. The soundtrack includes songs by chart-topping artists like Hillsong Worship, Chris Tomlin and TobyMac. THE JESUS MUSIC contains a Biblical worldview with light language and violence. This one is a fun option for parents and teens 13+.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nHILLSONG: LET HOPE RISE\n\nHILLSONG: LET HOPE RISE is a documentary that offers viewers a worship music experience. It follows the Christian worship team from Hillsong Church as they prepare a new song to perform in the Los Angeles Forum. The film contains a strong Christian worldview with no questionable elements, making it safe for the entire family. The soundtrack features many of the team’s most-known songs, like “Oceans (Where My Feet Will Fail).” HILLSONG: LET HOPE RISE might inspire everyone to sing along.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nBREAKTHROUGH (2019)\n\nBREAKTHROUGH is a moving film about a faithful mother’s prayer for her son’s healing and restoration after he drowned in a lake. The movie features a remix of the hit Christian song “This Is Amazing Grace” with a performance by Phil Wickham and gospel rapper Lecrae. It has a very strong Christian worldview that shines a light on the power of prayer. Parents should know there is light violence with scenes of peril that may frighten young children. BREAKTHROUGH is a tear-jerker worth a watch on the next family movie night.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nCOURAGEOUS\n\nCOURAGEOUS is an emotional movie made by the creators of FIREPROOF. When tragedy strikes a sheriff’s deputy, he questions his priorities in life. Leaning on his religion, he vows to be a better parent and inspires his fellow Policemen to sign a contract to be stronger Christians and fathers. The film features the hit song “Courageous” by Casting Crowns, which calls for believers to have the courage to serve the Lord. Despite some action violence, COURAGEOUS is an uplifting film appropriate for the 13+ crowd.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nAMAZING GRACE\n\nAMAZING GRACE tells the true story of William Wilberforce, an abolitionist who leads the charge to end slavery in 18th-century England. He draws inspiration from ex-slave trader John Newton (who wrote the beloved hymn “Amazing Grace”). This stirring movie features the well-known Chris Tomlin song “Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone).” Parents should know there is light language and violence, but the Christian message shines through. AMAZING GRACE is a remarkable story appropriate for kids 11 and up.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nGRACE UNPLUGGED\n\nTweens will love GRACE UNPLUGGED, which follows the story of Grace Tray, who has her faith tested when she launches a music career in Hollywood. She must fight the lure of stardom after being thrust into the real world. This unforgettable film has a very strong Christian worldview with pro-family messages. Parents should know there is a scene with alcohol, and a girl runs away from home. The positive messages outweigh the questionable moments, as it’s a prodigal story. It’s filled with incredible praise music to boot. Kids 12 and older will enjoy GRACE UNPLUGGED.\n\nFull Review ⇾"
