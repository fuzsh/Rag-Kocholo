        "text": "Recently, much of the creative discussions we've been having on Season 4 of The Record Process have centered around the importance of finding the right people to work with in the studio. I've had the privilege of interacting with some of the most legendary producers in the game ( Joe Chiccarelli , Steve Evetts, Warren Huart , @ David Ivory , ect) and I've also spent time in the drivers seat bringing the visions of countless younger artists to life in the studio. With so many great insights from respected producers and artists popping up on the show each week, I thought it might be helpful to compile a few of the most valuable tips I've learned across my last 20+ years of making music. Here's what I've found...\n\nOne of the most crucial parts of the recording and creation process is working with the right music producer. Finding the right music producer has a major impact on the quality and potential of your songs and the overall growth of your music career. It’s about more than just finding someone credible and talented, but someone you vibe with and that will be excited to take your music to the next level.\n\nEach collaboration is going to have its own dynamic, flow, and expectations. There’s nothing worse than constantly butting heads or dealing with tension in the studio. To avoid that, I'll share some tips on choosing the right producer for your band and how to best navigate that artist / producer relationship.\n\nThe Role of Music Producers (and why finding the right one is a game changer)\n\nThe music business is highly competitive. A skilled music producer has the ear and experience to get your work produced at the quality it deserves. During the recording process, they’ll work with you to come up with a creative direction and coax the perfect sound that delivers the collective vision. With expert knowledge of acoustics, musical composition, and audio engineering techniques, a music producer with a solid ear can shape a song into something that stands out and resonates with listeners.\n\nGreat music producers tend to have both technical and soft skills, with the ability to offer constructive feedback and valuable advice to music creators. They should be patient, a skilled problem solver, and an effective communicator. It’s important that both the artist and music producer feel comfortable sharing their ideas and experimenting. This is where the magic happens.\n\n5 Key Tips for Finding and Working With the Right Producer for Your Band\n\n1) Start the search\n\nUnsigned artists will need to work harder to secure solid relationships. The first step is to stay curious and ask around. Who is making the records for bands in your local or online scene that seem to be making an impact? Keep a rolling list of all those involved in these records. Remember, assistants often turn into engineers, who often turn into studio owners and then producers. Follow up on the deep credits if you can’t afford to hire the larger-name producers just yet.\n\n2) Do your research\n\nTo find the right producer, do your research and due diligence. Look for someone who has made a record you admire, and that is comparable with your band’s sound. Learn as much as you can about their work. Ask other musicians what it was like to work with that producer. Vet them to make sure they are professional, credible, and have a good reputation when it comes to their work ethic and reliability.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that you should look out for signs that the producer hasn’t done THEIR research on the band ahead of time. This is a dead giveaway that they are just taking the call to entertain a request from a manager or friend.\n\n3) Chemistry matters - BIG TIME!\n\nFind a music producer who fits your sound, genre, and vibe, and who truly understands your music. For example, if they write your band off as just another Blink-182 (speaking from personal experience…) when you’re aiming for something more nuanced, it probably is not the best fit. It’s important that they LIKE the music, so it’s a good idea to ask the producer you’re considering what artists they enjoy listening to recently. They should be excited to work with you and potentially willing to offer initial thoughts on new demos or previous material.\n\nChemistry matters in the artist / producer relationship. Ask detailed, nuanced questions in advance to make sure there is good chemistry, and pay attention to the questions that they ask you. Are they curious about your artistic intentions and creative ideas? Have they digested your previous catalog and come with suggestions? Or are they only concerned with the budget? It’s important that you’re compatible and can get along. The recording process is already anxiety-inducing enough. No one wants to add loaded interactions and arguments to the mix. The band and music producer should work as a team.\n\n(BTW: Want the weekly inside scoop on the artist-producer workflow responsible for albums from artists like Justin Bieber, Kylie Minogue, Coheed & Cambria, Sueco, and more??? Then check out my podcast THE RECORD PROCESS)\n\n4) Set expectations\n\nSet clear expectations from day one. Define the role the producer should play. Lay out the desired timeline, budget, and deal parameters for pre-production, production, mixing, and mastering. Establish what the producer is expecting from the band before recording begins.\n\nDecide how the song should sound and feel BEFORE you step into the studio, and make sure every band member is on the same page. Don’t be vague, because not knowing what you want only wastes time and money for everyone involved (and can easily irritate the people hired to steer the ship). Time for experimentation in the studio is a creative luxury that many artists might not be able to afford early on.\n\nKeep an open mind of course, but do your best to have an agreed upon blueprint for the songs before heading into the studio. Even if you can’t articulate it verbally, use examples of songs that inspire you and pinpoint specific aspects you want to draw inspiration from, whether it's the vocals, the kick/snare sound, or the transition between parts. Having some kind of reference is always better than walking in cold.\n\n5) Communicate often and with respect\n\nCommunication is key to the artist / producer relationship and every part of the creation process. Speak up if the producer is suggesting changes that aren't an authentic reflection of your vision. Trust your instincts and don’t sacrifice your core identity out of intimidation. That said, don’t hire somebody you wouldn’t trust to experiment with an idea if they hear an opportunity to push the song further. Different producers and mixers have different levels of creative involvement. Let them know what you’ve enjoyed about specific projects they’ve worked on in the pass, and make sure they are actually the ones responsible for those choices.\n\nBe respectful when swapping ideas or giving feedback. Be able to listen, absorb, and implement constructive criticism. The producer is there to help you and offer an outside perspective. When you’re so close to the music and all of your emotions are tied up in the song, it’s valuable to have someone who can listen objectively to find its strengths, and where there’s room for improvement. Mutual respect is necessary in creating a harmonious working environment where the music can flourish. It also strengthens the artist / producer relationship.\n\n6) Put it in writing - agreements can be your friend\n\nBefore you begin the collaboration process, make sure you know and understand the music producer’s policy. What services are included? How much will it cost? Have a frank conversation about fees and splits. Producers may take an upfront fee that covers their time and costs, which can be billed by the hour, day, song, or album. Don’t expect someone to work for ‘exposure.’ Make sure you have the budget before you embark on this process. It can be helpful to get everything in writing to be on the safe side.\n\nSo to recap, working with the right producer is critical to making music at a professional level you can be proud of, as well as making the recording process as smooth as possible. You’re creating music, not filing your taxes—it should be fun! If it’s not - your days of prolific songwriting might be numbered… Take your time to do your research. Follow your gut to maintain artistic integrity while also being open to new perspectives and opinions. You don’t know what you don’t know yet? And sometimes it’s about unloading the tasks you can \"technically” do yourself in order to free up space to expand other aspects of your talent.\n\nWant to learn more about what roles different producers play in the studio?
