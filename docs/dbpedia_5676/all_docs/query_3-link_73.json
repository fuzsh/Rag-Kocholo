        "text": "Before this year, Chappell Roan had never even been to Coachella. Now, not only can she say she's attended — she's performed in the desert, too.\n\nRoan played an evening set on the Gobi Stage on April 12, and is set to return for Weekend 2. Fans clad in everything from cowboy boots, Sandy Liang-inspired bows and, perhaps most importantly, jorts, gathered to celebrate their shared love of Roan's radiance, karmic kink and gay cowgirl doctrine.\n\nThroughout her performance, bubbles breezed through the air as Roan belted out her infectious (and aptly titled) track \"Femininomenon,\" which speaks to lover girls forced to live in an online-dating hellscape. \"Ladies, you know what I mean?/ And you know what you need and so does he/ But does it happen? No!\" Following collective screams of pure joy, the already enlivened crowd roused to match Roan beat-for-beat, shouting back in perfect unison, \"Well, what we really need is a femininomenon!\"\n\nIn an era of bedroom pop and sad-girl music, Roan has been hailed by both critics and fans for bringing fun back to pop music. Along with her staunch sense of self, Roan's penchant for explicit lyrics that are equally parts introspective and horny makes her dance-pop anthems all the more infectious.\n\nRoan's ambitiously experimental debut album, 2023's The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, cemented her status as one of the most exciting pop stars on the rise. While she only recently landed her first single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Good Luck, Babe!,\" her rapidly growing fan base — and an opening slot on Olivia Rodrigo's sold-out GUTS World Tour — indicate that she's on her way to superstardom.\n\nPerhaps part of Roan's magic is that it was all on her own terms. After parting ways with her first label, Atlantic Records, she built a loyal following as an independent artist before signing with Island Records last year. Even as a major label artist, she's determined to only do things her way; her indefatigable commitment to her craft — as well as writing her own rules when it comes to fashion and makeup — is precisely why her fans are so enraptured by both her music and persona.\n\nHer fearlessness was on full display during her first Coachella set, where the words emblazoned on her bodysuit read \"Eat Me.\" She talks the talk, and walks the walk (in fabulous, knee-high boots, of course), matching her unabashed aesthetic with equally bold career moves; for one, the openers for her headlining tour are local drag queens.\n\nWith eyeliner winged to the heavens, near-perfect vocal stability and fiery curls ablaze, Roan's shimmering Coachella Weekend 1 performance proved that her stage presence is equally dynamic. And if she had any doubters, she had one thing to say to them: \"B—, I know you're watching!\"\n\nIn between rehearsals for her Coachella debut, Roan took a look back on her journey to one of music's most coveted stages. Below, hear from Roan about five of the most impactful milestones in her career — so far.\n\nReleasing Her Debut Album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess\n\nI ended up signing [with Island Records in 2023] because this project honestly got too big to be independent anymore. I just wasn't willing to give up anything, any creative control or for any amount of money.\n\nBeing an independent artist was really special because I proved to myself that I could do all these hard things that I had never done. I built it with an entire friend group and many, many years of work. So it wasn't just me, but it proved a lot to me.\n\nIt proved I can make it through hard circumstances — with no money. You truly can. You do not need a label to do a lot of what an artist's career requires. You don't need a label to put on your own show, or make a music video, or even write a song, or find creative people. You don't need that s—t. I mean, a label is just money, you know? You don't need a lot of money to do this. To make it grow is, I think, where it takes a lot of money. That's what was difficult.\n\nMusic allows me to express anything, even things that I've never experienced before. It allows me to express queerness, even if it was only daydreams at that point. It allows me to express parts of me that I'm not even ready to accept yet.\n\nI don't give a f— if you don't f— with the music. You don't have to come to the concert. That's the whole point of it. You don't have to like it. I think throughout the year, I'm like, \"What can I get away with?\" Because right now it's pretty tame for what it is like to be a gay artist. But I just want to push it to see how far can I go — with the most controversial outfits or things to rile people up. I'm not really afraid to do that.\n\nHaving a song [like \"Casual] with the lyric, \"Knee deep in the passenger seat/ And you're eating me out,\" and it's being considered to go to radio. That's kind of a big thing to get away with.\n\nIt's not even that big of a thing. What's that song? Is it Flo Rida? That's like, \"Can you blow my whistle, baby/ whistle baby.\" Okay, that's obviously about like a f—ing blowjob. [Laughs.] No one cares about that. To me, I'm like, Let's talk about eating out on the radio. I actually think it has to be bleeped, but still, if I can get away with it, that's cool.\n\nFeeling Financial Freedom & Stability\n\nNot making money at all just sucked. But I learned how to do my own makeup and bedazzle and sew a little bit. I think that the scrappiness came from [the idea that] it's scrappy if it's fun.\n\nI think that's what kept me going — because if this wasn't fun, I would not even be here. But it was scrappy and fun, and it was with my friends. It didn't feel dire. I was also just working at a coffee shop, and I was a nanny, and I was working at a donut shop. I was doing part time jobs all on the side too. So it was all just rough [in the beginning].\n\nI have freedom because now [singing] is my full-time job. It provides for me now. As the project grows, I can do bigger shows and be like, I want outfit changes now, and I want more lights, and I want confetti. I can afford confetti now!\n\nIt's about expanding the universe in a thoughtful way. And not just like throwing a s— ton of money at things to make things look expensive or wear all this designer s— for no reason.\n\nI just try to look at how we are starting to gain momentum financially and see how can I intentionally use that to, one, pay the team in a way where they're not bare bones anymore, and two, [ask ourselves] how can we honor this project and this album and the queer community? Can we pay drag queens more? Can we bring drag on the road? Now, financially, doors have opened where we can walk through them with love and intention. Just recklessly, throwing money at s— to see if it works.\n\nOpening Olivia Rodrigo's Arena Tour\n\nOlivia [Rodrigo] just asked. It was official, we went through our management. But I was like, Oh my God.\n\nPreparing a 40-minute set is a different vibe than headlining, obviously. You are going out to an audience that is not there for you and doesn't necessarily care if you're there or not.\n\nThis is, like, my fourth or fifth artist I've opened for. But for an arena tour, I just needed to gather my nerves. I think that's the difference between any other show. Like, F—, there's 20,000 people out there right now. I've never performed in front of that many people. I don't know what this emotion is, and I just have to tame it right now.\n\nStanding Up For Herself Creatively, Even When There's Pushback\n\nI stand up for myself, I would say, every day. Sometimes, you get this opportunity, a huge opportunity with a lot of money on the table. [Yet,] I'm just like, That just doesn't make sense creatively. That doesn't align with my values. I'm not doing that.\n\nOne huge creative decision was I stood up and pushed the entire headlining Midwest Princess tour back to the fall. The album was supposed to come out while we were on tour. I was like, \"This is a horrible idea!\"\n\nThat caused a big ruckus, but it ended up being fine, and I was right. I'm usually right. [Laughs.] It's like a mother with her kid — a mother knows best. I feel like [that] when it comes to the integrity of my project.\n\nI know how it is to not be able to afford a ticket or even f—ing food. A concert ticket, a lot of times, means multiple meals for someone. I get it, I couldn't afford some artists' tickets. That's why it's really important to me to try to keep them as low as I can and my merch as low as I can.\n\nThere's pushback of ticket prices being low and we're playing rooms that are so expensive. The fee to even play them is so expensive. So, you have to raise the ticket prices to just even be able to afford to play the room. There's always an argument [with my team] there, every tour. I'm in control of stuff and if I'm saying this is how it's going to be —- it's just going to be that way.\n\nPerforming At Coachella For The First Time\n\n[After the first weekend of Coachella] I am feeling very relieved. I was so stressed about many things. How is the outfit going to work? Will the crowd really be engaged? It went so well, I have no qualms with anything. I loved every second of it.\n\nIt feels like I am partying with [my fans]. I am not performing to them; I’m performing with them. [I want people to remember] a really fun, freeing show. Very campy but very meaningful too.\n\n4 Ways Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS World Tour Shows A New Side Of The Pop Princess\n\nFrom vinyl records by the 1975 and U2, to album reissues and previously unreleased music, record stores around the world are stocking limited and exclusive releases for Record Store Day 2024.\n\nThe first Record Store Day kicked off in 2008 and every year since, the event supporting independently owned record stores has grown exponentially. On Record Store Day 2024, which falls on April 20, there will be more than 300 special releases available from artists as diverse as the Beatles and Buena Vista Social Club.\n\nIn honor of Record Store Day 2024 on April 20, here are 10 limited and exclusive drops to watch out for when browsing your local participating record store.\n\nDavid Bowie — Waiting in the Sky (Before The Starman Came To Earth\n\nBritish glam rocker David Bowie was a starman and an icon. Throughout his career, he won five GRAMMY Awards and was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\n\nOn RSD 2024, Bowie's estate is dialing it back to his Ziggy Stardust days to make Waiting in the Sky (Before The Starman Came To Earth) available for the first time. The record features recordings of Bowie's sessions at Trident Studios in 1971, and many songs from those sessions would be polished for his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.\n\nThe tracklisting for Waiting in the Sky differs from Ziggy Stardust and features four songs that didn’t make the final album.\n\nTalking Heads — Live at WCOZ 77\n\nNew York City-based outfit Talking Heads defined the sound of new wave in the late '70s and into the next decade. For their massive influence, the group received two GRAMMY nominations and was later honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2021.\n\nWhile promoting their debut album Talking Heads: 77, the quartet recorded a live performance for the New Albany, Pennsylvania radio station WCOZ in 1977. The Live at WCOZ 77 LP will include 14 songs from that performance at Northern Studios, including seven that will be released for the first time. Among the previously unheard cuts are \"Love Goes To A Building On Fire\" and \"Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town.\" During that session, Talking Heads also performed songs like \"Psycho Killer\" and \"Pulled Up.\"\n\nThe Doors — Live at Konserthuset, Stockholm, September 20, 1968\n\nThe Doors were at the forefront of the psychedelic rock movement of the 1960s and early '70s. One of Jim Morrison's most epic performances with the band will be available on vinyl for the first time.\n\nLive at Konserthuset, Stockholm, September 20, 1968 includes recordings from a radio broadcast that was never commercially released. The 3-LP release includes performances of songs from the Doors’ first three albums, including 1967’s self-titled and Strange Days. In addition to performing their classics like \"Light My Fire\" and \"You're Lost Little Girl,\" the Doors and Morrison also covered \"Mack the Knife\" and Barret Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\" live during this session.\n\nDwight Yoakam — The Beginning And Then Some: The Albums of the '80s\n\nOver the course of his 40-year career, country music icon Dwight Yoakam has received 18 GRAMMY nominations and won two golden gramophones for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1994 and Best Country Collaboration with Vocals in 2000.\n\nOn Record Store Day 2024, Yoakam will celebrate the first chapter of his legacy with a new box set: The Beginning And Then Some: The Albums of the '80s. His debut album Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. and 1987’s Hillbilly Deluxe will be included in the collection alongside exclusive disc full of rarities and demos. The 4-LP set includes his classics like \"Honky Tonk Man,\" \"Little Ways,\" and \"Streets of Bakersfield.\" The box set will also be available to purchase on CD.\n\nThe Beatles — The Beatles Limited Edition RSD3 Turntable\n\nBeatlemania swept across the U.S. following the Beatles’ first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in February 1964, setting the stage for the British Invasion. With The Beatles Limited Edition RSD3 Turntable, the band will celebrate their iconic run of appearances on Sullivan’s TV program throughout that year.\n\nThe box set will include a Beatles-styled turntable and four 3-inch records. Among those records are the hits \"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\" \"Till There Was You,\" \"She Loves You,\" and \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" which the Beatles performed on Sullivan's TV across several appearances.\n\nAmong 23 GRAMMY nominations, the Beatles won seven golden gramophones. In 2014, the Recording Academy honored them with the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo and Noah Kahan — From The BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge LP\n\nOlivia Rodrigo and Noah Kahan are two of the biggest pop stars in the world right now — Rodrigo hitting the stage with No Doubt at Coachella and near the end of her global GUTS Tour; Kahan fresh off a Best New Artist nomination at the 2024 GRAMMYs. Now, they're teaming up for the split single From The BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge LP, a release culled from each artist's \"BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge\" sessions.\n\nThe special vinyl release will include Rodrigo's live cover of Kahan's breakout hit \"Stick Season.\" The single also includes Kahan’s cover of Rodrigo’s song \"Lacy\" from her second album, GUTS. This month, they performed the song live together on Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour stop in Madison Square Garden.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club — Buena Vista Social Club\n\nInfluential Cuban group Buena Vista Social Club popularized genres and sounds from their country, including son cubano, bolero, guajira, and danzón. Buena Vista Social Club's landmark self-titled LP won the GRAMMY for Best Tropical Latin Album in 1998.\n\nThe following year, a documentary was released that captured two of the band's live performances in New York City and Amsterdam. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the documentary, the Buena Vista Social Club album will be released on a limited edition gold vinyl with remastered audio and bonus tracks.\n\nBuena Vista Social Club is one of the 10 recordings to be newly inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame as part of the 2024 inductee class.\n\nDanny Ocean — 54+1\n\nVenezuelan reggaeton star Danny Ocean broke through on a global level in 2016 with his self-produced debut single \"Me Rehúso,\" a heartbreaking track inspired by Ocean fleeing Venezuela due to the country's economic instability and the lover he had left behind.\n\nWith \"Me Rehúso,\" Ocean became the first solo Latin artist to surpass one billion streams on Spotify, on the platform with a single song. \"Me Rehúso\" was included on his 2019 debut album 54+1, which will be released on vinyl for the first time for Record Store Day.\n\nLee \"Scratch\" Perry & The Upsetters — Skanking With The Upsetter\n\nJamaican producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry pioneered dub music in the 1960s and '70s.

Though he was tragically murdered in 1997, his legacy continues to live on through his two albums.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Notorious B.I.G. dropped his 1994 debut album Ready to Die, which is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop releases of all-time. In honor of the 30th anniversary of the album (originally released in September '94), his estate will release Ready To Die: The Instrumentals. The limited edition vinyl will include select cuts from the LP like his hits \"Big Poppa,\" \"One More Chance/Stay With Me,\" and \"Juicy.\" The album helped him garner his first GRAMMY nomination in 1996 for Best Rap Solo Performance.
