        "text": "The Latest Track Is Kroger’s Response To The Questions Posed Throughout “No Filter,” The First Single From The Anticipated New Project\n\n5 April 2024 – Nashville, TN – “Still Yours,” a new song from GMA Dove Award®-nominated singer, songwriter, and worship leader Sarah Kroger, is out now leading up to her anticipated album, A New Reality, releasing May 17 (Integrity Music). Listen to the song HERE and view the lyric video below.\n\n“’Still Yours’ speaks to the history of my relationship with God and falling back on that history,” Kroger shares. “That’s the beautiful thing about relationships, having a history of experiences with each other that a foundation of love is built upon. This is me saying, ‘I’m still fighting to choose You because I believe it’s worth it. Our story isn’t done yet.’”\n\nPenning the song with award-winning writers Jeff Pardo and Ethan Hulse, “Still Yours” is Kroger’s response to the questions she presents throughout “No Filter,” her debut single that was released last month from the upcoming project. “No Filter” is her hope-laced faith journey that God is still who He says He is while offering listeners the courage to question and seek God.\n\nIt is Kroger’s vulnerability that through her music, there is a hope to ignite the need for conversation around faith and doubt within the Church. It is her mission to assure the listeners that their doubts do not disqualify them from pursuing closeness with God.\n\nWith “Still Yours,” “No Filter” and the rest of the songs featured on A New Reality, Kroger creates to reach the silent strugglers, the closet doubters, and anyone who has felt alone in their spiritual battles. Throughout the new album, she shares, “I hope people feel encouraged to bring their imperfect, questioning, doubting selves to God. I want people to be reminded of the beauty of His presence in the world. He’s more real than we can comprehend.”\n\n– # # # –\n\nABOUT SARAH KROGER: Sarah Kroger is a GMA Dove Award®-nominated artist, songwriter, and worship leader. With her previously released albums Your Time (2011), Hallelujah Is Our Song (2013), Bloom (2019), Light (2020), and London Sessions (2023), her latest project, A New Reality, is out May 17, 2024 (Integrity Music).\n\nWith parents involved in worship ministry, Kroger’s love for music was sparked at a young age, but the impact of bullying coupled with her struggle with anxiety and shyness hid her musical talents for years. Everything changed when she met Jesus in an intimate encounter through worship at a youth conference; “Worship became my language with God,” she explains. “It allowed me to communicate with the Lord in a way I hadn’t experienced before…it opened my heart.”\n\nRealizing music was a gift she desired to give back to the Lord, she began leading worship around the world, drawing people from a variety of cultures and church backgrounds under the banner of Jesus. With a passion for creating a safe and prayerful space through her music, her focus has always been an authentic portrayal of her relationship with God.\n\nWith A New Reality, it is her hope that people will come away knowing that it’s ok to question, to pull on the string and enable the unraveling to happen, knowing there is One who is gently mending the tangled threads back together into a beautiful, reconstructed tapestry.\n\nWoven with contemplative songs that expose honest vulnerability along with corporate worship songs that express the magnificence of God, the entire collection offers new ways to see suffering, questions, and silence as building blocks for a new faith—one that is stronger because of the struggle. Sarah Kroger brings listeners into that newness by helping us all ponder the mystery of God, rest in the wonder, and see that questions are a sacred path to a new reality."
