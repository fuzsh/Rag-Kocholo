        "text": "“I’m terrified,” Lauren Daigle said with a broad smile rather than any evident terror. It was six weeks before the release of her new self-titled album, and the biggest singer in contemporary Christian music (CCM) was sitting in a lounge at the midtown Manhattan offices of Atlantic Records, glowing with positivity.\n\nDaigle, a vivacious 31-year-old with a whimsical streak that’s evident in her colorful wardrobe, has crossed over into the pop world with greater success than anyone since Amy Grant in the early ’90s. But this is the first time she’s written love songs that aren’t about religious faith, and she’s worried that people will hear them as references to her personal life, rather than ruminations about universal experiences.\n\n“I’m all about writing songs to help people through things they’re questioning,” she said.\n\n“Lauren Daigle,” due May 12, will also be her debut on a major label, after releasing three albums on Centricity Music, a Nashville indie, and it will likely propel her further into the public eye. Later this year, she’ll headline her first arena tour.\n\nThe United States has become a much more divided and combustible country since Grant’s heyday, and Daigle is no newcomer to navigating the lion’s den. She has been caustically criticized within the Christian community for some of her choices, especially for appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” hosted by a lesbian celebrity, in 2018. All performers are carefully scrutinized in the social media age, but CCM artists live under a unique microscope, and much of the audience is unforgiving."
