        "text": "Matt Redman releases a special album titled “Coming Back To The Heart (Live Collection).” Recorded at the Beverly Theater in Las Vegas, this project revisits songs written or co-written by Matt for the Church over the last 25 years. After noticing new enthusiasm around some of his older songs, he decided to re-imagine them and invite people into a fresh expression of worship. One of the hallmarks of this record is the joining together of various songs: “I was amazed how well that worked – some just interlocked together so beautifully and naturally – like ‘Better Is One Day’ with ‘Facedown’ (both reverential songs around the theme of God’s presence) and ‘Never Once with ‘You Never Let Go’ (both songs about the faithfulness of Jesus),” Matt shares.\n\nThis live collection also introduces a brand-new song, “Let Me See Jesus,” which captures the album’s central message, as Matt explains, “that’s what the ministry I’ve been entrusted with is about.” Beholding God naturally leads to expressing praise and singing, “it’s the natural reflex of a soul who has glimpsed something glorious about God,” he continues.\n\n“Coming Back To The Heart (Live Collection)” is sonically communal and dynamic as it was recorded with stripped-back instruments in order to make room for the congregation’s voices. The room was filled with local worship leaders and singers, a deliberate move to go beyond the city’s entertainment reputation and into encounter with the living God. Featuring classics such as “Heart of Worship,” and a gospel-inspired outro on “10,000 Reasons,” the new album expresses something familiar in an unfamiliar manner. “I hope these songs will help us sing age-old truth in a fresh way,” Matt concludes.\n\nMission House releases another title from their second edition of Family Nights. The dual single, “The Whole Earth Is Full of Your Glory + Can't Stay Down,” is a folky Americana tune. Recorded live alongside friends in Charlotte, North Carolina, the new release captures Mission House’s signature warmth and their worshipful gratitude. The first portion of the single was written with Jessie Early and Jacob Early, and the second part features lyrics co-penned with John Mark McMillan. The new single takes us from awe at the beauty of the Creator, to a song of courage and faith out of that wonder. Mission House created a space that is as inspiring to worship as it is sonically engaging.\n\nThe Spirituals continue their journey of reimagining hymns with their newest release, \"Tis So Sweet,” a standout track from their new Hymns project coming in October 2024. The Hymns project was born out of the desire to breathe new life into timeless songs, bridging the gap between the past and the present and telling God’s endless story in a fresh manner. These hymns have transcended generations, carrying the message of God's love and hope.\n\n\"Tis So Sweet\" is a joyful and uplifting song that explores the meaning of trusting in Jesus. It reminds us of the importance of placing our faith in Him at all times, through every season of life. The Spirituals's rendition invites a new generation to fall in love with these sacred words and melodies, fostering a deeper connection with God."
