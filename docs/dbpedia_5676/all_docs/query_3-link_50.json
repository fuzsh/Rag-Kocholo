        "text": "Aaron Williams might be a new name to most, but he’s been steadily writing and leading songs of worship for years. The Texas native has been at the forefront of Dwell Songs — a musical expression birthed out of a larger discipleship movement — as well as Shane & Shane’s The Worship Initiative; and he just secured his first record deal with Integrity Music. However, up until recently signing on the dotted line, Williams has mostly released his original music independently. He dropped his first live solo effort, “The Hope of Christ,” in 2022 via The Worship Initiative.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Aaron Williams Enlists Mission House for Declaration of Dependency on ‘Abide’\n\nThe “Abide” singer is especially passionate about mentorship. You’ll often find him investing in worship teams around the country, seeking to help fellow worship leaders grow, mature and thrive at various stages in their journey. He’s just as content leading a seminar on worship and theology as he is sharing his music with a packed auditorium of worshipers. Moreover, he often finds his songs comfortably soundtrack intimate moments of prayer, reflection and worship in a living room just as easily as they exist in a church or concert setting.\n\nWilliams is also the founder of The Way of Worship, “a community of trusted leaders committed to discipling worship leaders, songwriters and musicians in the way of Jesus.” Still a relatively new endeavor, The Way of Worship offers cohorts, retreats and online resources to equip, educate and encourage faith-centered creatives.\n\nIn keeping with this mission, the father of three has developed multiple resources he hopes will support the next generation of worship leaders, as well as draw believers of all callings into a deeper relationship with Christ. Together with Kathryn Maack, he’s co-authored a book called “Whole,” which teaches readers how to unite seemingly contrasting aspects of the human experience with their divine assignments and unique personalities to become everything they were meant to be. Additionally, Williams has personally crafted companion material for his latest radio single, “Abide (feat. Mission House),” called “Teach Me to Abide,” a simple, straightforward guide that points readers toward living and leading from a place of abiding in Jesus."
