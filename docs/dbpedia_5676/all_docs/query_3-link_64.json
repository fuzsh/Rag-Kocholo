        "text": "âI can write songs that can impact my sphere of influence for God and I will do so. However, if I will train an army of Kingdom pens to do the same, the multiplication effect for the spread of the gospel through music would be exponential.â JLR\n\nThis single focus, and her all-consuming love for Jesus and His Bride, leads Jennie Lee Riddle to intentionally invest herself widely in the Kingdom.\n\nShe is a passionate worship leader, team trainer, songwriter, and conference speaker. She is honored as a five-time Dove award nominee and three-time Dove award winner, top 10 CCLI songwriter, and multiple BMI award winner for top 25 radio. She is best known for authoring Phillip, Craig and Deanâs gold-certified #1 hit single âRevelation Songâ along with several other songs like âWhen The Stars Burn Down,â âHope of the Broken World,â âMystery of Faith,â to name a few. Numerous artists have covered Jennieâs songs, including Kari Jobe; Gateway Worship; Michael W. Smith, Selah; Newsboys; Jesus Culture; Dustin Smith; Travis Cotrell; NewSong; Shane & Shane; Superchick; Rebecca St. James; JJ Heller; Glen Packiam; Jared Anderson; Fike; Sixteen Cities; Travis Ryan; Crystal Yates; Michael English; Matt Papa and many others.\n\nHer songs have been carried by the largest Christian tours including Passion and Winter Jam and are sung by churches both large and small in every denomination throughout the world.\n\nThe latest personal musical endeavor of Jennieâs is the forming of the cooperative People & Songs and the release of her critically acclaimed album, âOpus 1, Collective,â the first in a series. âOpus 1â³ enjoyed a #1 debut on iTunes, receiving all five-star reviews to date, in addition to being touted by Worship Leader Magazine as the âIndie Best of Best for 2012.â Her record was listed in the top 10 albums of 2012 by New Release Tuesday. âOpus 2â is currently underway.\n\nJennieâs strong calling towards mentoring leaders, fostering Kingdom culture, and growing healthy communities of creatives has led her to hold key roles for the GMA (Gospel Music Association) and NPWI (National Praise & Worship Institute). She is regularly found in classrooms of all sizes around the US in hopes of inspiring creatives and travels throughout churches in the United States, Europe, and Asia with fellow writers, artists, speakers, and those she mentors. Jennie also owns and operates New Nation Music, LLC and its affiliates: www.analyzemysong.com, www.theemergingsound.com â a summer intensive for creative teens, www.memoryhousemusic.com â an indie production company, and www.peopleandsongs.com - a interdenominational community of worship leaders and pastors who serve together to unify the Body of Christ through music.\n\nJennie has been married to her best friend, Darrin, for 26 years. They have four children, ages 16-25, and split their time between McKinney, TX and Nashville, TN, where Jennie is an Integrity Music staff writer and helps lead at LifePoint Church under Travis Ryan as part of the worship community."
