        "text": "To a Christian, there are two main types of music, gospel and secular. Gospel music is quite a niche in that it services a Christian audience. This limitation often makes it harder for gospel artists to achieve global recognition. Now, imagine how much harder that is for an independent gospel artist.\n\nIndie Gospel artists have two ladders to climb. First, they must try to reach an audience without the deep pockets of a record label behind them. If they manage to get the audience, they must then struggle to break beyond a strictly Christian audience. In this article, I'll celebrate ten independent Christian artists making beautiful music.\n\nTen Christian indie artists I enjoy listening to\n\nFor King and Country\n\nOne of my favorite Gospel artists, For King and Country is finally starting to get the widespread recognition they deserve. This brother duo released their first EP in 2008 and it earned them a deal with Warner Music Group one year later. They took on the name \"For King and Country\" and have been making music for king and country ever since. I know what you're thinking, this isn't an indie band. Just hang on.\n\nIn 2016, after two albums with WMG, the duo moved to an independent record label called Curb Records. They've gone on to release three more albums and add two Grammy wins to their previous two. For King and Country are probably the most successful on this list, but there are still some incredibly talented artists to come.\n\nPhil Wickham\n\nWith eleven albums released over eighteen years, Phil Wickham is a shining example of consistency. He released his first album in 2003 and continued making music until the world started to listen. After his first album, he signed with Simple Records, an independent label. Between 2006 and 2013, Phil Wickham released five albums. It was in this run he finally started making a name for himself, even earning a top spot on the Christian Airplay Songs Chart with his song, This is Amazing Grace.\n\nPhil Wickham is an awesome example to any young Christian, indie artist trying to gain widespread recognition. Consistency cannot be replaced in your journey to success. Phil Wickham has gone on to win four Dove Awards among several other milestones.\n\nAda Ehi\n\nTime for some Nigerian flavor with Ada Ehi, a personal favorite of mine. One of the biggest gospel artists in Nigeria, she has released seven albums since her debut in 2009 and continues to minister all over the world. She owes much of her success to independent label, Loveworld, which was founded by the general overseer of her church, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. If you'd like to vibe to some Nigerian music, Ada is an awesome place to start.\n\nBrooks Ritter\n\nOnce described as a vocalist with abilities somewhere between Adele and John Legend, Brooks Ritter is a worship leader at heart. He released his first album, The Horse Fell Lame, in 2009 to some success but not enough to be a viral hit. His next two albums also haven't made him a household name all over, but his music is quality and his message is true.\n\nThat said, he hasn't released any new album since 2016 so he's perhaps not the best example of consistency for your career. Let's hope his 2021 EP, Ghost Come to Life, is somewhat predictive of a more active musical future.\n\nAntoine Bradford\n\n\"Not quite gospel, but not quite RnB.\" This is the description of Antoine Bradford's music by many listeners. He first released music in 2017 and has continued to grow steadily. I especially enjoy one of his more recent songs, Dear Struggling Christian. If you'd like to hear about Christian life in a way that you can relate to, this is your guy.\n\nTaylor Leonhardt\n\nTaylor Leonhardt is a much newer face than the likes of Phil Wickham. She started her music career in 2015 with the release of an EP, Truest Things. Then she teamed up with Jess Ray to form Mission House, although she still releases solo music. She has released two more albums by herself and five with Jess Ray. Hold Still, her most recent solo album, is one I especially like and recommend.\n\nTaylor Leonhardt is signed to the independent label Integrity Music. You may have heard of their founder, one of the most revered gospel artists of all time, Don Moen.\n\nZach Winters\n\nIf you enjoy listening to indie folk music, Zach Winters is the man for you. After his first album as far back as 2004, Zach Winters has consistently served us indie folk Gospel music, with his last album coming out in 2022. He doesn't only make music that praises God's greatness and mercy, but also songs that we can all relate to in our journey to be better people.\n\nZach Winters has released over twenty projects and continues to make music. He's also been on several tours around both the US and Europe. He also enjoys performing for people in tough situations. He performed for orphans in Mexico and Syrian refugees, for example.\n\nGreatman Takit\n\nLet's round up our list with some Nigerian spice. Great man Takit is a young, budding Christian rapper from Nigeria who I enjoy listening to. He's by no means one of the most successful Christian indie artists in the world, but I like to give some of my personal favorites a shout-out sometimes.\n\nHe has released two albums, an EP, and several singles so far. He's nowhere near where he wants to be, but he's certainly on the way. If you like African music but can't seem to find the right Gospel tune, Greatman is a safe place to go.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGospel music is a calling, otherwise it would be too easy for Gospel artists to branch off into the more glamorous secular music industry. Sticking to their path takes a ton of dedication.\n\nSo to every Gospel indie artist trying to make a living off music, you're not alone. I cherish and celebrate you."
