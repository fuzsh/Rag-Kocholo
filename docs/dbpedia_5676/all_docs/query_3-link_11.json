        "text": "American singer and musician (born 1950)\n\nThis article is about the singer-songwriter. For the footballer, see Don Moen (Canadian football).\n\nMusical artist\n\nDonald James Moen (born June 29, 1950) is an American singer, pianist, and songwriter, specializing in Christian worship music.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMoen grew up in Two Harbors, Minnesota, where he attended high school, graduating in 1968.[1] Moen attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian liberal arts school.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHe became a Living Sound musician for Terry Law Ministries and traveled with Terry Law for ten years.[2] After, he worked for Integrity Media for over 20 years, serving as creative director and president of Integrity Music, president of Integrity Label Group, and an executive producer of Integrity Music albums.[3] He left Integrity Media in December 2007 to start a new initiative, The Don Moen Company.[4] The Don Moen Company acquired MediaComplete, the church software company that created MediaShout. Moen became a radio host for Don Moen & Friends in 2009. Moen received a Dove Award for his work on the musical God with Us in addition to nine nominations for his songs.\n\nMoen also worked with Claire Cloninger, Paul Overstreet, Martin J. Nystrom, Randy Rothwell, Ron Kenoly, Bob Fitts, Debbye Graafsma, Paul Baloche, Tom Brooks, Aline Barros, among many others. He worked with musicians, Justo Almario, Carl Albrecht, Abraham Laboriel, Alex Acuña, Paul Jackson, Jr., Lenny LeBlanc and Chris Graham.[citation needed] He was a catalyst in launching the careers of Paul Baloche, Darlene Zschech, Israel Houghton, and Hillsong United.[5]\n\nHe produced 11 volumes for the Hosanna! Music series of worship albums. His first album under his own name, Worship with Don Moen, was released in 1992. His music has total global sales of over five million units.[3][6]\n\nMoen's first album for Hosanna! Music, Give Thanks, became the label's bestseller. Produced by Tom Brooks, Give Thanks went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. Moen followed this with a number of albums of his own including two, En Tu Presencia and Trono De Gracia, in Spanish. God with Us won the Dove Award for Best Musical. On an Asian tour in 1999 he recorded The Mercy Seat at Singapore Indoor Stadium and Heal Our Land at Yoido Park in South Korea, which was released in 2000. One of Moen's albums, I Will Sing, was recorded at Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nGod Will Make a Way: The Best of Don Moen was released in 2003 and features 19 greatest hits. The title song was written for his sister-in-law and her husband, whose oldest son died in an auto accident while their other three children survived but were seriously injured. Moen's Hiding Place became his first studio album which was recorded at Paragon Studios in Franklin, Tennessee, and was released in the autumn of 2006. I Believe There Is More released in late 2008. His third studio recording titled Uncharted Territory (funded successfully through Kickstarter) released on March 27, 2012.[7] His Christmas album, Christmas: A Season of Hope, was released on October 22, 2012, and some songs were recorded at a studio in Czech Republic.[citation needed] Moen released Hymnbook as a celebration of reaching over 1 million likes on his Facebook page.[8][9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMoen and his wife, Laura, have been married since May 19, 1973. Together, they have five children.[10][1]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nGive Thanks\n\nReleased: 1986\n\nFormat: CD, tape, download\n\nLabel: Integrity Music, Hosanna!
