        "text": "Darci Lynne, the America's Got Talent winner who is equally talented at singing and ventriloquy (and yodeling!), took a break from her usual pop covers to slow down with a worship song, and she sounds just lovely.\n\nAccompanying herself on the piano, Lynne sang \"Goodness of God,\" a popular Christian song from the Bethel Music label collective. She also shared one of her favorite passages from Scripture in the caption, writing, \"One of my favorites to sing!!!'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.' Psalm 150:6.\"\n\nRELATED: 12-Year-Old Darci Lynneâ€™s Vocals Were Beyond Her Years for Viral AGT Audition\n\nAbout \"Goodness of God\" by Jenn Johnson\n\nJenn Johnson, one of Bethel's co-founders, began composing the song on the fly while driving in her car. She told Fox News that she was inspired by the process of adopting her so,n Ryder. In addition to Johnson, the credited writers are Ed Cash, Jason Ingram, Ben Fielding, and Brian Johnson, and the song was released in 2019."
