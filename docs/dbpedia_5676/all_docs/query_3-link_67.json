        "text": "Ricky Suave comes to you from New York to shine with his refreshing, multi-faceted music. Ricky has been making music for some time now, under various names, and dabbling with different sounds. He has worked on the production, songwriting, and DJing, looking for a layered sound that he was proud of and connected with.\n\n“Waiting: Reckless In Seoul” is Ricky Suave’s latest single with his new record label “Crew of Roamers Records”. He combines influence from many genres to produce a dense, striking song with a groove to it. The ethereal melody underneath the vocals expertly contrasts the quick and solid beat, which is introduced later in the song. His influences of Reggae, Trap, R&B, and more stand out through his spirited vocals and backing track.\n\nYellow Claw, Rvssian, and Timbaland are three childhood influences of Ricky’s that weave their way through parts of his music. You can feel the integrity and emotions in his lyrics, singing “I don’t wanna wait for another day, we only got tonight” and taking you along a story of passion and longing. “Waiting: Reckless In Seoul” is short and sweet, drawing you into the song then dropping off suddenly, leaving the listener eager for more. Be on the lookout for more from this up and coming artist.\n\nHey Ricky, nice to catch up with you. We really enjoyed listening to your new song! It’s so versatile, where did the production process begin for this track? Did you have an idea of how you wanted it to sound sonic when you wrote the lyrics?\n\nI started creating the song in November of last year. I was in the middle of studying for my finals when I took a break and listened to some music, just to ease some of the stress. When I didn't like some of the tracks I heard, I looked up some samples I wrote the song with three friends and my younger sister, one of which was my friend Brandon who ended up singing and rapping in the final version. I knew I wanted the lyrics to match the feel of the overall track, which was somewhat dark and remorseful, yet demanding and light. When it came down to recording, he matched the tone and energy that was needed and the rest was history.\n\nThough “Waiting: Reckless In Seoul” is quite fast-paced, there is also a darker, more passionate aura around the song. Do you draw inspiration from your own experiences?\n\nDefinitely. When I finished mastering the demo, I automatically got started with the writing process. I honestly didn't know how hard that would end up being. I asked my friends and family for some ideas on how the song should go and a few of them suggested I write about past relationships. The fact that I had just gotten out of an almost three-year relationship made it all the more obvious to pursue this project. The relationship itself was nice, but it left me in a position where I was vulnerable and depressed. Writing about it gave me clarity on how things should’ve been handled and how I can prevent those mistakes from happening again.\n\nWhy did you make the decision to use alias names for past releases? Do those songs represent different stages in your life?\n\nThe first alias I had represented a younger version of myself, one that wasn't fully prepared to know what the real world was like but had fun doing what he did. When I first began, I produced a ton of urban-EDM tracks with another producer friend of mine because that's what I grew up listening to. It isn't very often that you would hear a Hispanic kid from the Bronx rising up, not just in the EDM scene but in other genres as well. For that reason, I gave up on my old alias (it was AD2X.Eric for any of those wondering) and decided to reinvent myself. The songs I make now represent that same kid from back then but has learned to love himself and others with any insecurities and trauma involved.\n\nWhere do you see yourself heading with your music in the coming years? Did you enjoy experimenting with different sounds?\n\nI really want people to hear my music on a greater scale, not much in the local scene. Most of the music I make is sort of like a reoccurring therapy session to help me navigate through life and because of that, I try not to put a barrier on the type of music that I produce. If I want to produce an R&B track, I'll produce an R&B track. If I want to produce a Dancehall track, I'll produce a Dancehall track. There's really no stopping someone's creativity when they're being exposed to many different cultures and perspectives and that's something I remind myself when meeting new people and ideas. I have to make myself happy, not just with the music but with life in general before I can even consider the wants and needs of others.\n\nWhat has been keeping you inspired throughout 2020?\n\nAll of the recent protests and activism I've been seeing not just in person, but online is keeping me going at this point. We live in a world where people are constantly suffering and there isn't enough attention being placed on those issues. An artist friend and I even worked on a track a week directly after George Floyd's death because we felt that event needed to be showcased. You hear reports that men and women of color are being neglected, abused, and even killed by the systemic prejudicial cycles that plague this country and enough is enough.\n\ninstagram.com/therickysuave"
