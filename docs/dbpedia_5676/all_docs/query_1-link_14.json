        "text": "Bringing together decades of experience from various key facets of the entertainment industry, Christian music leaders Lance Wieland, Marcus Rixon and Jay Speight announce the formation of Amplo Records. The label launches with the signing of acclaimed singer/songwriter Nathan Sheridan to an exclusive recording contract, as well as songwriter Phoebe Scott to an exclusive publishing agreement.\n\nAmplo Records will unveil Sheridan’s highly anticipated single, “Something Worth Singing About,” August 5, and the song is set to impact Christian radio August 26. Launching his career in 2018 with the critically acclaimed full-length Broken With You, Sheridan—a National Guard veteran—is a prolific songwriter and emotive recording artist drawing inspiration from his personal journey of overcoming profound adversity and loss.\n\nWest Tennessee native Phoebe Scott is a multi-genre songwriter. In addition to releasing several solo singles, Scott’s compositions have been recorded by a range of artists and her work has garnered various film and television placements.\n\n“Nathan Sheridan and Phoebe Scott are the perfect flagship signings for Amplo,” says label co-founder Marcus Rixon. “We have long been champions of Nathan’s unique talent, and Phoebe is an inspired songwriter who we’ve had the privilege of getting to know through Writes & Bites, a monthly community-building event for artists and songwriters.”\n\n“Marcus, Jay and I met in 2019 through our involvement in Writes & Bites,” Amplo co-founder Lance Wieland adds. “We quickly realized that we share a heart for coming alongside emerging artists to provide a strong foundation from which they can grow and flourish. We’re thrilled to be working together on behalf of the artists we believe in.”\n\n“Amplo is Latin for amplify, and it encapsulates our vision for the company,” explains label co-founder Jay Speight. “Marcus, Lance and I share a common passion for nurturing and developing the next generation of artists and songwriters. By combining our skills and experience under the Amplo banner, we feel we’re uniquely positioned to help our artists reach a wider audience with their music, which in turn amplifies the impact of their ministries.”\n\nAbout The Amplo Records Team\n\nMarcus Rixon is the founder and president of Rixon Entertainment Group, a Franklin, Tennessee-based company specializing in artist management. Rixon Entertainment Group boasts Platinum-selling, GRAMMY®-nominated, multi-Dove Award winning artists, producers, and songwriters—including Selah, Stars Go Dim, and Chris Bevins.\n\nLance Wieland is the CEO of Franklin-based WieRok Entertainment Group. Specializing in artist management and creative services, WieRok’s flagship management client, six-time Dove Award-nominated hip-hop recording artist Steven Malcolm, leads a diverse roster of Christ-centered artists engaged in writing, producing, performing and promoting authentic and unifying creative content to the world.\n\nBased in the Nashville area, Jay Speight is a sought-after songwriter and producer with more than two decades of label, publishing, production and artist development experience. His songs have been recorded by such iconic artists as Trace Adkins, Travis Tritt and NewSong, among numerous others.\n\nFor further information, visit amplorecords.com.\n\n##"
