        "text": "After spending 20 years with Atlantic Records, Skillet is going off on their own new label and releasing a new single at the same time.\n\nThe frontman of the Christian rock band is starting his own music imprint called Hear It Loud.\n\n\"After this long, we’ve learned enough about our audience to know what they want to hear,\" lead singer John Cooper said in an interview with Billboard. \"We have a pretty good handle on that now, so it’s time for us to be pushed out of the nest, or maybe jump out of the nest.\"\n\nSkillet is releasing a new single on August 9 called 'Unpopular' and is the first single on an upcoming album, Revolution coming out November 1.\n\n\"There’s not this chain of people that need weigh in on it. The system takes a really long time. Instead, I wrote a song and we recorded it eight days later. That is a huge benefit. With the change in pace of technology and of the industry, that was important to me to be able to make quick decisions.\""
