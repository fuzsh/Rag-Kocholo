My heart is filled to overflowing with thanksgiving and songs, and I cannot wait to share them.”\n\nZschech’s new album is slated for global release on March 3. The project features new songs penned by Zschech and her church members along with guest writers. The album is Zschech’s first project following her battle with cancer and the first since the 2013 release of her critically acclaimed album Revealing Jesus.\n\nSources: Hoganson Media\n\nConnect With Darlene Zschech\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter\n\n“Get Plugged In!” To JesusWired\n\nFacebook | Twitter | YouTube | Email | Pinterest | Instagram | Soundcloud | RSS\n\nAbout Darlene Zschech:"
