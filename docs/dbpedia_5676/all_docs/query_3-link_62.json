        "text": "Charts\n\nFind Spotify charts at charts.spotify.com or in the Spotify app via Search > Charts.\n\nWe generate chart stream numbers using a formula that protects the integrity of our charts, and makes sure all voices of our users are reflected.\n\nThis formula means not every stream on Spotify is eligible for charts. Some songs may have fewer chart-eligible streams than others, depending on streaming behavior. So the stream count you see in charts might look different to the app and Spotify for Artists.\n\nOur chart filtering doesn’t impact the royalties we pay to creators.\n\nViral charts\n\nViral charts capture the songs gaining the most buzz on Spotify.\n\nChart placement is based on a few factors:\n\nIf a song has recently risen in plays\n\nHow often people share the song\n\nHow many people recently discovered the song\n\nViral charts are entirely data-driven.\n\nGlobal charts use data from all listeners, and regional charts look at data among listeners in that particular region.\n\nCity charts\n\nCity charts are ranked by streaming popularity in a particular city.\n\nLocal Pulse shows songs uniquely popular in that particular city, relative to their overall popularity.\n\nWe include all cities around the world with high streaming activity on Spotify.\n\nNote: City charts are only available at charts.spotify.com.\n\nWhen charts update\n\nDaily charts usually get published before 12 PM EST (4 PM UTC) the day after the chart period.\n\nYou can see weekly charts after the charting week ends globally. A charting week begins Friday and ends the following Thursday.\n\nEligibility\n\nFor a daily chart, any song or album live on Spotify before or during a charting day is eligible (12:00 AM - 11:59 PM UTC).\n\nFor a weekly chart, any song or album live on Spotify before or during a charting week is eligible (Friday 12:00 AM - Thursday 11:59 PM UTC).\n\nRe-entries\n\nWhen an entry falls off a chart and re-enters, its streak count resets.\n\nA streak is the number of consecutive weeks or days an entry’s been on a chart, not the total number of weeks or days ever on the chart.\n\nThe peak position doesn’t reset. It’s the highest position an entry’s ever been on the chart.\n\nSharing your chart position\n\nUse Promo Cards from charts.spotify.com to share your (or someone else’s) chart position on social media."
