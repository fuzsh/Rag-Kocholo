        "text": "10. Passion: Better Is One Day Passion Band (1999)\n\nThis release galvanized a musical movement that has been multiplied and used by God to transform the lives of millions of young people.\n\n9. Pray Andraé Crouch Warner\n\nSome 30 years after his first record, Andraé Crouch, proved yet again that quality, creativity, and, yes, anointing can come in the same package. His personal trademarks are all here: songs full of Scripture, lyrics referencing the person and work of the Holy Spirit as well as the Second Coming, and his endearing selflessness that allowed other singers to share the solo parts with him. I mean, who knew there was such a force as Tata Vega until 1984’s No Time To Lose? God has always used him as a gathering place for some of the best musicianship and creative energy the world has ever known. His seven Grammy’s only attest to the ability of his music to touch hearts no matter what walk of life they come from. God has used him and his songs to build bridges within the Church and without.\n\nAndraé never follows he always leads. His projects have always seemed streets ahead of their time. Pray is like one great church service from start to finish—full of power and emotion, conviction and resolve. Pastor Andraé starts out giving us the Word on the first track and finishes the project reminding us that Jesus is returning soon. Crouch’s work has always encouraged me spiritually and creatively. From a schoolboy trying to copy his piano licks, to an adult where I’ve been privileged to throw my arms around this living legend and tell him how much he has meant to me. Many a Christian artist and songwriter can thank him for paving the way racially, creatively, and spiritually. Praise the Lord—he does all things well! (Written by David M. Edwards)\n\n8. Beautiful Things Gungor Brash Music (2010)\n\nWith Beautiful Things, Gungor expanded the boundaries of the worship genre. Beautiful, skilled, and creative, this release is a New Song.\n\n7. Facedown Matt Redman Sparrow/sixstepsrecrods (2003)\n\nRedman’s influence in the worship genre is ineffable. The worship leader’s, worship leader he fills his music with passion, intellect, and elegance, paving the way to a hopeful future in Church music. Facedown the epitome of his craft and anointing.\n\n6. Hillsong United Hillsong/Integrity Music (2010)\n\nOne of my all-time favorite worship album’s is Hillsong United’s 2006 release United We Stand. Featuring foundational songs such as “From the Inside Out,” “The Stand,” and “Take It All,” these songs have impacted the Church spanning across the globe and have had a profound impact on worship writer’s and leaders alike. Sonically this album broke new ground in the live worship genre, which can be extremely elusive to all of us who make worship albums. That being said, the live worship experience, which I have been fortunate to see twice, is too great an experience for any recording medium to capture.\n\nTo me, a standout of the record was Joel Houston stepping to new heights both in writing and his presence on the album. This was also the first CD featuring Brooke Fraser, who stands out on “None but Jesus.” These songs have not only had a profound impact on the Church, but have found a way to unite a global audience worshiping God. In every aspect of society today you will find people trying to define a movement. Whether that was their intention or not, Hillsong United have done so successfully through powerful songs and voices of worship. (Written by Peter Kipley)\n\n5. Change My Heart Oh God Various Vineyard Music (1996)\n\nThe quintessential early Vineyard release, these songs could well be the spark that started a revolution. The title track alone is one of our most cherished gifts, but there’s more here: “Refiner’s Fire,” “I Believe in Jesus,” “Hosanna,” “Isn’t He,” “More Love, More Power,” “Holy and Anointed One,” “Light the Fire Again,” this release was used by God to truly change the world in some powerful ways.\n\n4. Live From Another Level Israel Houghton Integrity Music (2004)\n\nIt’s so easy to write about anything that involves Israel Houghton. This album, Live From Another Level was absolutely breakthrough when it was released—bringing together pure CCM, pure gospel, pure worship, and songs that really called us to come near to God. To hear the Church global make “Friend of God” their own is a true reflection of man’s desire to be closer to our creator, and to me, this album reflected our unchanging desire for relationship over religion. The other thing about this project as a whole, is that if you play it from start to finish and actually engage with the worship leadership that is woven throughout, you truly are led to the courts of our King. This is done with integrity, wisdom, and a sweet anointing that dose not manipulate, but rather, encourages us in our pursuit of Christ and his presence.\n\nNo one leads and writes songs of praise quite like our Israel. Again and again these songs that declare and announce that our God reigns, that he is to be praised, and that friendship with him is possible, are written, played, and sung with complete conviction. And to be honest, they really help a heart like mine jump over its own inadequacies, allowing me to run toward God in praise! I genuinely am thankful to Israel and his team of genius players, singers, and prayer warriors that I know spend countless hours truly bringing their finest, both musically and spiritually.\n\nThanks Israel, you continue to call us up to “a whole nuther level!” (Written by Darlene Zschech)\n\n3. A Greater Song Paul Baloche Integrity Music (2006)\n\nA Greater Song by Paul Baloche is the album that gave us “Your Name” and “Hosanna” which have been such gifts to the Church. I’ve led both of those songs many, many times and have seen God’s people experience his transcendent presence in power and in truth through them. In recent years I’ve become a good friend of Paul’s and it’s no mystery to me why God has and continues to use him in such mighty ways. His heart pounds with a passion to always sing a greater song to God here on the earth, to lift him higher still. Thank you Paul for reminding us that in his presence, all our fears are washed away and for giving us songs that carry His presence to every heart that will sing.\n\n2. Arriving Chris Tomlin Sparrow/sixstepsrecords (2004)\n\nChris Tomlin is easily the Christian singer/songwriter exemplar for the current generation of worship albums. This is not an arguable statement; it’s the truth. With words and thoughts that are as beautiful as they are accessible by nearly every age range, Arriving was the beginning of the changing of the guard. Chris Tomlin showed us what we never knew we were missing in church: a combination of passion, theology, and the anthemic hook. From the moment Arriving released anthems grabbed the reigns from the praise choruses and said, “We’ll take it from here.” And it was songs like “Indescribable,” “How Great Is Our God,” and “Holy Is the Lord,” that were able to gather large portions of the body of Christ, and we were woven together in apt adoration and united in heartfelt and honest praise. Beyond all of this, its is no small thing to note that Tomlin stood out as an example to other men, willing to pour out passion and heart—to bow before the Lord our God in humility and love, unashamed. On Arriving, Tomlin is filled with charisma and optimistic praise. Arriving also marks the collaborative work between Tomlin and preeminent producer/songwriter/instrumentalist Ed Cash. Undoubtedly, this duo (along with the Passion’s various worship leaders) has been used by God to transform the way this generation offers its sung worship to our Father. And Arriving was Tomlin hitting his stride in the journey. (Written by Jeremy Armstrong)\n\n1. Cutting Edge 1&2 Delirious? Furious? (1994)\n\nAlthough known for its reserved religious expression, England is experiencing a sweeping revival fueled by contemporary worship music. At the forefront is Delirious?, five lads from the seaside town of Littlehampton who stormed the British charts—without any record deals or media exposure. (early band description, circa 1994)\n\nIf Love Song ignited the rock band as worship model, and the Vineyard continued to light the fire, then The Cutting Edge band (named after a youth movement in the UK), aka Delirious? added a booster rocket and shot it into the stratosphere. The first time I heard, sang, and danced to “I Could Sing of Your Love Forever” (originally recorded on one of two cassettes and then released on CD as Cutting Edge 1&2 in 1994), I was caught up in its sheer joy and exultant declaration of God’s love … and yes, we almost did sing it forever. It was followed at service-end by “Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble,” (Cutting Edge 3&4, 1995)—which in SoCal after having just survived the Northridge Earthquake was more than a lyrical concept—pulling everyone from their seats in a burst of staccato pogo-ing. This was two years before the songs were released in one double CD in the US. As in the early Jesus movement, the music flew faster than the industry’s ability to produce and distribute, circulating worldwide, infusing worship with new vitality, accessibility, and power. Sometimes called the “Delirious? Movement,” their impact on not only what we sing, but what we write, and how we reflect that faith locally and globally has been inestimable. The Delirious/U2-ing of American worship can be heard every Sunday across the land. And though we always encourage leaders to develop their own voice, emulating the truth, beauty and rock-worthy worship of Delirious? is an inspired starting point. (Written by Andrea Hunter)"
