His elder brother was George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax.[1]\n\nHe served as Groom of the Bedchamber to the Duke of York from 1665 to 1672 and to King Charles II from 1673 to 1678. During this time he was also made envoy-extraordinary to France between 1672 and 1673 and between 1678 and 1682.[2]\n\nIn 1673 he was elected Member of Parliament in an irregular election for Newark, which was eventually declared void in 1677.[3] In the subsequent by-election Savile was properly re-elected, sitting until 1679. He was elected again in 1685, sitting until 1687.\n\nIn 1680 he was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. He was subsequently an envoy at Paris, where he died in 1687.\n\nHe was a close friend of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester.\n\nSee also[]\n\nSavile Baronets, of Thornhill (1611)\n\nReferences[]\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: \"Savile, Henry (1642-1687)\".
