        "text": "The de Carteret family originated in Normandy. They colonised the island of Sark as Seigneurs. At the time of the restoration, some became Barons Carteret and were granted lands in the Carolinas and in the State that became New Jersey.\n\nTheir ancestral seat is Saint Ouen's Manor, Jersey, still today owned by persons of that name."
