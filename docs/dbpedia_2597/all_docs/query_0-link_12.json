        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Gr-Gz\n\nGraaf, Fred de, byname of Godefridus Jan de Graaf (b. Feb. 28, 1950, Roosendaal en Nispen [now part of Roosendaal], Noord-Brabant, Netherlands), Dutch politician. He was mayor of Apeldoorn (1999-2011) and chairman of the First Chamber (2011-13).\n\nGraaf, Theo(dorus Matheus Johanna) de (b. Nov. 27, 1912, Rijen, Gilze-Rijen municipality, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands - d. Jan. 15, 1983, Nijmegen, Netherlands), Dutch politician. He was mayor of Nijmegen (1968-77).\n\nGraaf, Thom(as Carolus) de (b. June 11, 1957, Amsterdam, Netherlands), Dutch politician; son of Theo de Graaf. He was leader of Democrats 66 (1998-2003), a deputy prime minister and minister without portfolio (government reform and kingdom relations) (2003-05), and mayor of Nijmegen (2007-12).\n\nGraaff (of Tygerberg), Sir David Pieter de Villiers, (1st) Baronet (b. March 30, 1859, Villiersdorp, Cape Colony [now in Western Cape province, South Africa] - d. April 13, 1931, Milnerton, Cape province [now in Western Cape], South Africa), finance minister of South Africa (1915-16); created baronet 1911. He was also mayor of Cape Town (1891-92), minister of public works and posts and telegraphs (1910-12), minister without portfolio (1912-13), and high commissioner to the United Kingdom (1914).\n\nGraaff (of Tygerberg), Sir (David Pieter) De Villiers, (2nd) Baronet (b. Dec. 8, 1913, Cape Town, South Africa - d. Oct. 4, 1999, Cape Town), South African politician; son of Sir David Pieter de Villiers Graaff. He became a member of parliament in 1948, the year the United Party was ousted from government by the conservative National Party, which imposed the formal system of apartheid and held power until the first all-race elections in 1994. Graaff took over leadership of the United Party in 1956. He led the opposition to the governments of three apartheid prime ministers, Johannes Strijdom, Hendrik Verwoerd, and B.J. Vorster. In 1977, the United Party was dissolved and the New Republic Party was founded, of which he briefly served as interim leader before retiring. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1931.\n\nGraaff-Nauta, Dieuwke (IJtje Willemke) de (b. May 22, 1930, Sneek, Friesland, Netherlands - d. June 10, 2008, Sneek), interior minister of the Netherlands (1994).\n\nGraanoogst, Ivan, Surinamese politician. He was minister of culture and sport (1982) and people's mobilization, army, and police (1982). Having been army chief of staff, in 1990 he became army commander when DÃ©si Bouterse resigned the position in a dispute with Pres. Ramsewak Shankar; soon afterward, the army deposed Shankar, and Graanoogst ruled the country for a few days until Johan Kraag was installed as president, who reinstated Bouterse. In 1992-93 Graanoogst was again army commander.\n\nGrabar-Kitarovic\n\nGraber\n\nGrabar-Kitarovic, Kolinda, nÃ©e Grabar (b. April 29, 1968, Rijeka, Croatia), foreign minister (2005-08) and president (2015-20) of Croatia. She was also minister of European integration (2003-05) and ambassador to the United States (2008-11).\n\nGrabarczyk, Cezary (Stanislaw) (b. April 26, 1960, LÃ³dz, Poland), justice minister of Poland (2014-15). He was also minister of infrastructure (2007-11).\n\nGraber, Pierre (b. Dec. 6, 1908, La Chaux-de-Fonds, NeuchÃ¢tel, Switzerland - d. July 19, 2003, Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland), president of the Council of State of Vaud (1968) and president of the National Council (1965-66), foreign minister (1970-78), and president (1975) of Switzerland. He was also mayor of Lausanne (1946-49).\n\nGrabowski, Kazimierz (b. 1866, Lemberg, Austria [now Lviv, Ukraine] - d. Feb. 3, 1932, LwÃ³w, Poland [now Lviv, Ukraine]), governor of Lwowskie wojewÃ³dztwo (1921-24).\n\nGrabowski, Witold (b. March 13, 1898, Batum, Russia [now Batumi, Georgia] - d. Oct. 25, 1966, London, England), justice minister of Poland (1936-39).\n\nGrabski, Tadeusz (Wojciech) (b. March 14, 1929, Warsaw, Poland - d. Feb. 2, 1998, Poznan, Poland), a deputy premier of Poland (1980). He was also chairman of the Presidium of the People's Council (1972-73) and governor (1973-75) of Poznanskie wojewÃ³dztwo and first secretary of the party committee of Koninskie wojewÃ³dztwo (1975-79).\n\nW. Grabski\n\nGrabski, Wladyslaw (b. July 7, 1874, Borowo, near Lowicz, Poland - d. March 1, 1938, Warsaw, Poland), prime minister of Poland (1920, 1923-25). A Socialist in his youth, he later joined the National Democracy Party and was elected a member of three successive sessions of the Duma (1906-12), the legislative body of the Russian Empire, of which Poland was then a part. After Poland had become detached from Russia, Grabski was elected to the Polish constituent assembly (January 1919) but was soon sent to join the Polish delegation at the peace conference in Paris. Returning to Warsaw, he became minister of agriculture in December 1919. From June 23 to July 24, 1920, he was prime minister and in this capacity went to Spa, Belgium, to ask the Allied Supreme Council for immediate aid in arms and munitions to enable Poland to defend itself against Soviet Russia. He served as minister of finance in the cabinet of National Defense until November 1920 and again in January-July 1923. On Dec. 19, 1923, he became prime minister (and finance minister) again. He succeeded in stabilizing the Polish economy by the creation of a new Polish currency (Feb. 1, 1924), the gold-based zloty, to stop inflation, and the foundation of the Bank of Poland (April 15, 1924). In the summer of 1925, however, he was faced with a new crisis. Germany launched a \"tariff war\" on Poland, and the Deutsche Bank sold large quantities of the new Polish currency in the money markets of Berlin and Vienna. The zloty lost almost 50% of its original gold value, prices rose, and unemployment increased, forcing Grabski's resignation on Nov. 13, 1925. After Gen. JÃ³zef Pilsudski's coup d'Ã©tat of May 1926, Grabski retired from active politics.\n\nGraÃ§a, Abel (da) (b. Jan. 20, 1840, IcÃ³, CearÃ¡, Brazil - d. Sept. 26, 1897, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of ParÃ¡ (1870 [acting], 1871-72); son of JosÃ© Pereira da GraÃ§a, barÃ£o de Aracaty; brother of Heraclito de Alencastro Pereira da GraÃ§a.\n\nGraÃ§a, AntÃ³nio Ricardo, acting governor-general of Angola (1853).\n\nGraÃ§a, Carlos (Alberto Monteiro Dias) da (b. Dec. 22, 1931 - d. April 17, 2013, Lisbon, Portugal), foreign minister (1988-90) and prime minister (1994-95, 1995) of SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe. He was also minister of social affairs (1975-77) and a presidential candidate (1996).\n\nGraÃ§a, Heraclito de Alencastro Pereira da (b. Oct. 18, 1837, IcÃ³, CearÃ¡, Brazil - d. April 16, 1914, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of ParaÃ­ba (1872) and CearÃ¡ (1874-75); son of JosÃ© Pereira da GraÃ§a, barÃ£o de Aracaty.\n\nGraÃ§a, JoÃ£o SimÃµes Lopes, barÃ£o e visconde da (b. Aug. 1, 1817, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil - d. Oct. 25, 1893, Pelotas), acting president of Rio Grande do Sul (1871). He was made baron in 1872 and viscount in 1876.\n\nGraÃ§a, Joaquim JosÃ© da (b. 1823 - d. Sept. 25, 1889), governor-general of Angola (1870) and governor of Macau (1879-83).\n\nGrachev, Pavel (Sergeyevich) (b. Jan. 1, 1948, Rvy, Tula oblast, Russian S.F.S.R. - d. Sept. 23, 2012, Moscow, Russia), defense minister of Russia (1992-96). He was also commander of the Soviet Airborne Forces (1990-91) and chairman of the Russian State Committee for Defense Affairs (1991-92).\n\nGracia\n\nGracia Arregui, Ignacio, nom de guerre IÃ±aki de RenterÃ­a (b. Nov. 30, 1955, RenterÃ­a, Basque Country, Spain), Basque guerrilla leader. It was believed that he joined the Basque separatist group ETA as a young adult towards the end of the Francisco Franco dictatorship, which brutally repressed Basque culture until Franco died in 1975. In 1977 he was granted an amnesty for ETA members by the new civilian government, but soon went back underground. He received guerrilla training in Algeria, becoming a military commander by 1980, according to the official police biography. He was arrested in Spain for minor offenses in 1981 and 1982 but set free each time. He lived illegally in France from 1987. Investigators believed he was ETA's supreme leader since 1992, when he stepped into a vacuum left by the arrest of 24 suspected ETA leaders in the Basque town of Bidart in southwestern France. By a stroke of irony Bidart was also the town where Gracia Arregui was captured in his flat in September 2000. He was suspected of ordering an assassination attempt on Spain's King Juan Carlos in 1995. ETA experts believed that as head of ETA's military operation, his authority was rivalled only by that of Mikel Albizu, ETA's alleged ideological chief. In February 2000 he had been tried in absentia in France and sentenced to six years for conspiracy, arms possession, and falsifying documents. Gracia Arregui's arrest came two days after 20 other suspected ETA leaders were arrested in what police called a devastating blow to the group. But ETA has bounced back from \"devastating\" blows before, aided by its hydra-like command structure and driven by a longing to reunite an ancient Basque homeland in northern Spain and southern France.\n\nGracie, Samuel de Souza LeÃ£o (b. Nov. 11, 1891, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - d. March 3, 1967, Rio de Janeiro), acting foreign minister of Brazil (1946). He was also chargÃ© d'affaires in Paraguay (1921) and the United States (1924-25), minister to Bolivia (1931-34), Austria (1935-38), Hungary (1938-39), and Sweden (1939), and ambassador to Chile (1940-46), Portugal (1947-52), and the United Kingdom (1952-55).\n\nGradin, Anita (Ingegerd) (b. Aug. 12, 1933, HÃ¶rnefors, VÃ¤sterbotten, Sweden - d. May 23, 2022), Swedish politician. She was minister of immigration and equal opportunities (1982-86) and foreign trade (1986-91), ambassador to Austria (1992-94), and EU commissioner for immigration, justice and home affairs, financial control, anti-fraud, and relations with the European ombudsman (1995-99).\n\nGradin, Ulrica (Catharina) (b. May 22, 1961, LuleÃ¥, Norrbotten, Sweden), acting governor of VÃ¤stmanland (2021-22).\n\nGradinari, Svetlana (Fyodorovna) (b. June 4, 1979, Komrat, Moldavian S.S.R.), foreign minister of Gagauzia (2013-15).\n\nGradnauer, Georg (b. Nov. 16, 1866, Magdeburg, Prussia [now in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany] - d. Nov. 18, 1946, Berlin, Germany), minister-president of Sachsen (1919) and interior minister of Germany (1921).\n\nGrady, J(oseph) Harold (b. Feb. 27, 1917, Williamsport, Pa. - d. Jan. 9, 2002, Timonium, Md.), mayor of Baltimore (1959-62). He was named the city's top prosecutor in 1955 and elected to that post in 1958. He was then drafted to run for mayor in 1959. That year, he rode to victory on a wave of political change, defeating incumbent mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr., in the hotly contested Democratic primary. In the general election, Grady defeated Republican Theodore R. McKeldin, former mayor and governor. The election of Grady, who was backed by Irv Kovens, also had historic consequences. It marked the eclipse of James H. \"Jack\" Pollack's political machine and the rise of Kovens as a kingmaker. When Grady and his running mates, Philip H. Goodman and R. Walter Graham, Jr. - popularized as the Three Gs for Good Government - were elected, they gave every appearance of being a united team. Before the administration finished its first year, it became apparent that the team was not pulling together. Goodman, the City Council president who succeeded him as mayor, and Graham, the comptroller, were complaining that Grady was not consulting them on important matters, and they began disagreeing with the administration line on occasion. The city's financial problems afflicted the new mayor. To save money, he discontinued free public baths and merged the Park Police into the Baltimore Police Department. He also speeded up land acquisition and construction of the Jones Falls Expressway and the Baltimore Civic Center, later renamed the Baltimore Arena. Judge Grady left City Hall in 1962, three years into his term, when he was appointed to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore, forerunner of the Circuit Court.

Grandi was a leader in the 1922 March on Rome that brought Benito Mussolini to power. He then served in the Chamber of Deputies as a party member. As foreign minister (1929-32) and ambassador to Britain (1932-39), he encouraged stronger ties with the League of Nations and helped soothe British opposition to the Italian conquest of Ethiopia (1935-36).

July 23, 1885, Mount McGregor, N.Y.), president of the United States (1869-77). He served in the Mexican War (1846-48) and resigned from the army on April 11, 1854. During the Civil War, Grant was appointed lieutenant general in March 1864 and was given command over all the armies of the United States. His basic plan for the 1864 campaign - to immobilize Gen. Robert E. Lee near the Confederate capital at Richmond, Va., while Gen. William T. Sherman led the western Union army southward through Georgia - was successful. In late 1865 Grant toured the South at Pres. Andrew Johnson's request, was greeted with surprising friendliness, and submitted a report recommending a lenient Reconstruction policy. In 1866 Grant was appointed to the newly established rank of general of the armies of the United States. In 1867 Johnson removed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in order to test the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act, which required the assent of Congress to removals from office, and in August he appointed Grant secretary of war ad interim. When Congress insisted upon Stanton's reinstatement, Grant resigned his secretaryship (January 1868), thus infuriating Johnson, who believed that Grant had promised to remain in office to provoke a court decision. Johnson's angry charges brought an open break and strengthened Grant's Republican ties, leading to his nomination for president in 1868. He was elected with a small popular margin over his Democratic opponent, Horatio Seymour, former governor of New York. He won reelection easily in 1872, with a large margin over Horace Greeley.\n\n1 Grant decided to reverse his given names and enroll at West Point as Ulysses Hiram Grant (presumably to avoid having the initials HUG embroidered on his clothing); however, his congressional appointment was erroneously made in the name Ulysses S.

He was also prefect of the French dÃ©partements of Hautes-Alpes (1980-81), Charente-Maritime (1984-86), FinistÃ¨re (1986-88), Somme (1991), and Ille-et-Vilaine (1993-94).\n\nGrassi, Giuseppe (b. May 8, 1883, Lecce, Puglia, Italy - d. Jan. 25, 1950, Rome, Italy), justice minister of Italy (1947-50).\n\nGrasso\n\nGrasso, Ella (Rosa Giovanna Oliva) T(ambussi), nÃ©e Tambussi (b. May 10, 1919, Windsor Locks, Conn. - d. Feb. 5, 1981, Hartford, Conn.), governor of Connecticut (1975-80). A Democrat, she served two terms in the Connecticut House of Representatives (1953-57), 12 years as Connecticut's secretary of state (1959-71), and two terms in the U.S. Congress (1971-75). She was elected governor of Connecticut in 1974 and in so doing became the first woman to be elected governor in her own right (i.e. the first not to be the wife or widow of a governor). In office, she exercised great frugality. She kept state spending low by limiting aid to cities and welfare recipients and, in a memorable blunder in 1975, by laying off 500 state workers just before Christmas. Her popularity suffered as a result of these austerity measures. Her success with Connecticut's economy, however, ultimately gained her a second term as governor. She left a mark of conservatism on the government, choosing, for example, to prohibit the state financing of abortions under Medicaid, saying \"I do not wish to be a party to killing the children of the poor,\" a formulation that dismayed feminists. She also consistently opposed the extension of legalized gambling, an important source of state revenue. She was forced to resign on Dec. 31, 1980, because of fast-spreading cancer.\n\nGratry, Guillaume Alexandre Auguste (b. Sept. 1, 1822, Ath, Netherlands [now in Belgium] - d. July 13, 1885, Saint-Gilles [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium), war minister of Belgium (1880-84).\n\nGratz, GusztÃ¡v (b. March 30, 1875, GÃ¶lnicbÃ¡nya, Hungary [now Gelnica, Slovakia] - d. Nov. 21, 1946, Budapest, Hungary), finance minister (1917) and foreign minister (1921) of Hungary. He was also ambassador to Austria (1919-21).\n\nL. Gratz\n\nGratz, Leopold (b. Nov. 4, 1929, Vienna - d. March 2, 2006, Vienna), mayor of Wien (1973-84) and foreign minister of Austria (1984-86). He was also education minister (1970-71) and president of the National Council (1986-89).\n\nGrau (Cavero), Rafael (Leopoldo) (b. Jan. 17, 1876, Lima, Peru - d. [assassinated] March 4, 1917, Palcaro, ApurÃ­mac, Peru), justice and education minister of Peru (1914). He was also mayor of Callao (1913-14).\n\nGrau San MartÃ­n, RamÃ³n (b. Sept. 13, 1887, La Palma, Pinar del RÃ­o, Cuba - d. July 28, 1969, Havana, Cuba), president of Cuba (1933-34, 1944-48).\n\nGrauls, Jan (b. Feb. 12, 1948), Belgian diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (2008-13).\n\nGrauss, Alois (b. June 18, 1890, Jenbach, Tirol, Austria - d. Nov. 29, 1957, Rotholz bei Jenbach, Tirol), Landeshauptmann of Tirol (1951-57).\n\nGraux, Charles (Alexandre Louis) (b. Jan. 4, 1837, Brussels, Belgium - d. Jan. 22, 1910, Brussels), finance minister of Belgium (1878-84).\n\nGrave, Frank de, byname of Franciscus Hendrikus Gerardus de Grave (b. June 27, 1955, Amsterdam, Netherlands), defense minister of the Netherlands (1998-2002). He was also acting mayor of Amsterdam (1994).\n\nGravel, Mike, byname of Maurice Robert Gravel (b. May 13, 1930, Springfield, Mass. - d. June 26, 2021, Seaside, Calif.), U.S. politician. He was a Democratic senator from Alaska (1969-81) and a candidate for the 2008 and 2020 Democratic presidential nominations and for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination.\n\nGravenhorst, Jacob Bennebroek (b. Dec. 6, 1802, CuraÃ§ao - d. Sept. 29, 1859, CuraÃ§ao), interim governor of CuraÃ§ao (1854-56).\n\nGraves, (David) Bibb (b. April 1, 1873, Hope Hull, Ala. - d. March 14, 1942, Sarasota, Fla.), governor of Alabama (1927-31, 1935-39).\n\nBill Graves\n\nGraves, Bill, byname of William Preston Graves (b. Jan. 9, 1953, Salina, Kan.), governor of Kansas (1995-2003). The Republican was elected secretary of state in Kansas in 1986. He was not the favourite going into the 1994 governor's race. That was probably Democratic Congressman Jim Slattery, one of those instinctively political Democrats who captures a Republican seat (as he did in 1982) and holds onto it indefinitely, with a voting record that promotes local interests and wobbles between moderate and liberal on national issues. Slattery was able to win a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary with an impressive 53%. But in the general he had little to say, slipping from one issue to another, then focusing on charges that Graves had received contributions from executives of an Alabama company owned by his father-in-law which was accused of misleading seniors about their insurance coverage. Graves, who won his six-candidate primary with 41%, had a more solid theme. He pledged to keep spending down, to rein in government; he called Slattery a \"double-dealing Washington congressman\" - pretty tough stuff in 1994. The race blew open in the last weeks, and Graves won 64%-36% - the widest margin in over 20 years, and an astonishing showing against a man who had after all won election to Congress five times in a major portion of the state; Slattery carried three of 105 counties. Graves was reelected even more decisively in 1998, defeating Democrat Tom Sawyer 73%-23%.\n\nGray, Isaac P(usey) (b. Oct. 18, 1828, Chester county, Pa. - d. Feb. 14, 1895, Mexico City, Mexico), governor of Indiana (1880-81, 1885-89). He was also U.S. minister to Mexico (1893-95).\n\nGray\n\nGray, L. Patrick, in full Louis Patrick Gray III (b. July 18, 1916, St. Louis, Mo. - d. July 6, 2005, Atlantic Beach, Fla.), acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1972-73). He served aboard submarines in World War II and the Korean War during a 20-year career in the Navy. In 1960 he worked for Vice Pres. Richard Nixon in his failed bid for president. He returned to government service after Nixon was elected president in 1968, serving as executive assistant to the secretary of health, education and welfare and on the president's cabinet committee on desegregation. In 1970 he was appointed assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil division. Nixon appointed Gray acting FBI director in May 1972, after the death of J. Edgar Hoover. Months later, the Watergate break-in occurred which ultimately led to Nixon's resignation. Though Gray was never indicted for any Watergate-related misdeeds, descriptions of him as a Nixon loyalist who helped thwart the investigation and as someone the White House thought could be pushed around dogged him in the years following the scandal. He vigorously disputed the depiction. Shortly before his death, he said that he had reacted with \"total shock, total disbelief\" to the revelation that his former deputy, W. Mark Felt, was the secret Watergate source known as Deep Throat who was secretly feeding information to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward. Gray said he believed the trusted deputy had been unhappy at being passed over for the top job and had talked to the Post in order to sabotage him.\n\nGray, Robin (Trevor) (b. March 1, 1940, Kew, Vic.), premier of Tasmania (1982-89).\n\nGray, Sir Robin, byname of Sir Robert McDowall Gray (b. July 2, 1931, Borgue, Scotland - d. April 2, 2022, Mosgiel, near Dunedin, N.Z.), New Zealand politician; knighted 1993. He was speaker of the House of Representatives (1990-93).\n\nGray, William Bain (b. 1886 - d.

April 1, 1962, London, England), British justice secretary (2012-15). He was also lord president of the council (2015-16) and transport secretary (2016-19).\n\nGraziani\n\nGraziani, Rodolfo, marchese (marquess) di Neghelli (b. Aug. 11, 1882, Filettino, near Frosinone, Italy - d. Jan. 11, 1955, Rome, Italy), Italian colonial administrator. He served in Eritrea (1908-13) and Libya (1914) and then took part in World War I. Soon afterwards he returned to Africa and participated in the fighting for the reconquest of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. In 1930 he became governor of Cyrenaica and assumed the task of crushing the Sanusi rebellion of Omar al-Muktar. He created vast concentration camps into which he herded the nominally peaceful natives, thus cutting them off from the Sanusi. At the same time he constructed along the Cyrenaican-Egyptian frontier a continuous line of barbed-wire entanglements which prevented the passage of supplies to the rebels from their sympathizers in Egypt. Recalled home to a high military command in 1934, he was not left long in charge of the Udine Army Corps but was sent out in the following year to be governor of Somalia (1935-36). When the Ethiopian war broke out, he was entrusted with the operations on the southern front. His services were rewarded by his promotion to be a marshal and later by the marquisate of Neghelli. He was viceroy (1936-37) and honorary governor (1938) of Italian East Africa. Again commanding in Libya at the outbreak of World War II, he advanced against Egypt in 1940. Decisively defeated by Sir Archibald (later Earl) Wavell (December 1940-February 1941), he resigned his post. After the Italian armistice of 1943, Graziani became defense minister of Mussolini's German-backed Italian republic, engaging in antipartisan warfare. Placed on trial after the war, he was sentenced to 19 years' imprisonment in 1950 but was released the same year, later becoming leader of the Italian neofascist movement.\n\nGrazynski, Michal (Tadeusz) (b. May 12, 1890, Gdow, Austria [now GdÃ³w, Poland] - d. Dec. 10, 1965, London, England), governor of Slaskie wojewÃ³dztwo (1926-39). He was also Polish minister of propaganda (in exile, 1939).\n\nGrcic, Branko (b. April 16, 1964, Knin, Croatia), Croatian politician.

Feb. 7, 1956, Tomsk oblast, Russian S.F.S.R.), finance minister (2002-05) and prime minister (2008-09) of Moldova. She was also first deputy prime minister (2005-08) and chairman of parliament (2019-21).\n\nGrechko, Andrey (Antonovich) (b. Oct. 17 [Oct. 4, O.S.], 1903, Golodayevka [now in Rostov oblast], Russia - d.

May 6, 2004), speaker of the House of Assembly of South Africa (1983-86).\n\nGreeley\n\nGreeley, Horace (b. Feb. 3, 1811, Amherst, N.H. - d. Nov. 29, 1872, New York City), U.S. politician. A liberal Whig, he became increasingly bitter in the early 1850s over the failure of his Whig colleagues to support him for high public office - a lifelong ambition. He also grew disenchanted with the party's ambivalence toward slavery, which he opposed on both moral and economic grounds. In 1854 he transferred his allegiance to the newly emerging Republican Party, which he helped organize. Throughout the decade, his newspaper, the New York Tribune, constantly fed the rising anti-slavery excitement of the North; his paper became anathema to slaveholders of the South. After the onset of the Civil War (1861), Greeley pursued an erratic course, though generally he sided with the Radical Republicans in advocating early emancipation of the slaves and, later, civil rights for freedmen. He lost much public respect by opposing the renomination of Pres. Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and in signing the bail bond of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis in 1867. Partly out of political pique and partly from disagreement with the corruption apparent in the first administration of Pres. Ulysses S. Grant (1869-73), he joined a group of Republican dissenters, forming the Liberal Republican Party, which opposed Grant in 1872. The party nominated Greeley for president, and, in the dreary campaign that followed, Greeley was so mercilessly attacked that, as he said, he scarcely knew whether he was running for the presidency or the penitentiary. Despite the faction's inexperience, Greeley polled more than 40% of the popular vote; he died before the electoral college met, and his 86 electoral votes went to four minor candidates.\n\nGreen, Anne, nÃ©e Glass (b. March 21, 1952), chief islander of Tristan da Cunha (1988-91, 2003-07).\n\nGreen, Arnold (Karlovich) (b. Aug. 30, 1920, Riga, Latvia - d. Nov. 4, 2011), foreign minister of the Estonian S.S.R. (1962-90). He was also deputy premier (1953-58, 1960-84), education minister (1958-60), and president of the Estonian Olympic Committee (1989-97).\n\nGreen, Dwight H(erbert) (b. Jan. 9, 1897, Ligonier, Ind. - d. Feb. 20, 1958, Chicago, Ill.), governor of Illinois (1941-49). He was defeated for a third term by Adlai E. Stevenson. Green had first attracted public notice in 1931 as the prosecutor who sent Al Capone to prison for federal income tax evasion.\n\nGreen, Fred W(arren) (b. Oct. 20, 1872, Manistee, Mich. - d. Nov. 30, 1936, Munising, Mich.), governor of Michigan (1927-31).\n\nGreen, George Conrad (b. April 5, 1897 - d. May 29, 1976), administrator of Grenada (1942-51).\n\nG.

He was also minister of works and hydraulics (1969-72), public affairs (1972-73), cooperatives and national mobilization (1973-77), and labour, health, and housing (1977-80), vice-president for public welfare and labour affairs (1980-82), agriculture (1982-84), and social infrastructure (1984-85), first deputy prime minister (1984-85), and mayor of Georgetown (1994-2016).\n\nJ. Green\n\nGreen, Josh(ua Booth) (b. Feb. 11, 1970, Kingston, N.Y.), governor of Hawaii (2022- ).\n\nGreen, Malcolm Scrimshire (b. Sept. 24, 1824 - d.

Nov. 25, 2017), foreign minister of Mexico (1998-2000). She held a string of diplomatic and foreign posts, culminating in her arrival at the UN in New York in March 1994 as assistant secretary-general in the political affairs department. The highest-ranking woman at the time in the UN bureaucracy in New York, Green was appointed the first coordinator of all women's issues in the UN system in 1995. Most considered her an outspoken advocate on a wide variety of issues, including working conditions at the UN, harassment complaints, and the role of women in UN programs worldwide. Green moved to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's personal office where she was an adviser mainly on Western Hemisphere and European affairs. A former Mexican deputy foreign minister, Green was well versed on Central American problems and played a key role in the 1992 El Salvador peace accords. She continued to advise Boutros-Ghali on the issue and traveled with him to the region. She left the UN at the end of 1996, at the same time as Boutros-Ghali. She returned to Mexico, where she won election to the Senate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) the following year. Appointing her Mexico's first female foreign minister in 1998, Pres. Ernesto Zedillo stressed Green's extensive foreign affairs experience in posts ranging from Mexico's last ambassador to East Germany (1989-90) to its representative at the World Bank. In 2001-04 she was ambassador to Argentina.\n\nGreen, Theodore F(rancis) (b. Oct. 2, 1867, Providence, R.I. - d. May 20, 1966, Providence), governor of Rhode Island (1933-37).\n\nGreen, Warren E(verett) (b. March 10, 1870, Jackson county, Wis. - d. April 27, 1945, Watertown, S.D.), governor of South Dakota (1931-33).\n\nGreene, Daniel J(oseph) (b. 1850, St. John's, Newfoundland - d. Dec. 12, 1911, St. John's), premier of Newfoundland (1894-95).\n\nE.P.C. Greene\n\nGreene, E(verly) P(aul) Chet (b. Jan. 15, 1964), foreign minister of Antigua and Barbuda (2018- ). He has also been minister of trade, industry, commerce, sports, culture, and national festivals (2014-18), trade and immigration (2018- ), and agriculture and Barbuda affairs (2023- ).\n\nGreene, Wallace M(artin), Jr. (b. Dec. 27, 1907, Waterbury, Vt. - d. March 8, 2003, Alexandria, Va.), U.S. Marine Corps commandant (1964-67). His 37-year Marine career took him to China in the 1930s and to London and the South Pacific in World War II. In March 1965, when Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson ordered combat troops to what was then South Vietnam, a Marine regiment was the first American combat unit to enter the country. The U.S. presence eventually grew to 500,000, of which about 70,000 were Marines. Under Greene, the Marine Corps grew from 178,000 active-duty personnel to nearly 300,000. As chief of staff of the Marine Corps and then as commandant, Greene was instrumental in a study that looked 20 years into the future and put forth new ideas that later became part of Marine Corps doctrine. A key proposal was training individual infantrymen to spot targets and use satellite positioning and \"terminal guidance\" systems to call in artillery, airstrikes, or rockets.\n\nGreene, William (b. March 16, 1696 [1695, O.S.], Warwick, Rhode Island - d. Feb. 23, 1758, Warwick), governor of Rhode Island (1743-45, 1746-47, 1748-55, 1757-58).\n\nGreene, William (b.

July 19, 1842, Clitheroe, Lancashire, England - d. March 5, 1896, Lowell, Mass.), governor of Massachusetts (1894-96).\n\nGreenidge\n\nGreenidge, Carl (Barrington) (b. March 3, 1949, New Amsterdam, British Guiana [now Guyana]), finance minister (1983-92) and foreign minister and a vice president (2015-19) of Guyana and acting secretary-general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (1994-96). He was also minister of economic planning (1983-84).\n\nGreening, Leslie Stuart (b. May 31, 1895, England - d. 1974, West Sussex, England), administrator of Antigua (1946-47) and Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla (1947-49).\n\nGreenly, William L. (b. Sept. 18, 1813, Hamilton, N.Y. - d. Nov. 29, 1883, Adrian, Mich.), acting governor of Michigan (1847-48).\n\nGreenspan\n\nGreenspan, Alan (b. March 6, 1926, New York City), chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (1987-2006). He was an ardent follower and close friend of the writer Ayn Rand, whose espousal of laissez-faire capitalism formed the basis of much of Greenspan's economic philosophy. He favoured a kind of supercapitalism based on decreased government regulation, a balanced budget with strong defense spending, liberalized banking laws, and a return to the gold standard, but he admitted that this was impossible in a less-than-perfect world. An economic adviser (1968-74) to Pres. Richard Nixon and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (1974-77) under Pres. Gerald Ford, he was considered a free-market theorist with a practical ability to get things done. He was also chairman of the National Commission on Social Security Reform (1981-83) and served on other advisory boards. When Paul Volcker resigned as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on June 2, 1987, Pres. Ronald Reagan named Greenspan as the new chairman. Despite reservations on the part of some senators, he was confirmed almost unanimously on August 3. Shortly after he took command, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 508 points on October 19. He acted quickly to ensure liquidity in the markets, but he moved too slowly to prevent the U.S. from falling into a recession in 1990. When Asian countries underwent a financial crisis and an economic downturn beginning in 1997, he lowered U.S. interest rates in 1998 in order to cushion the economy. As the Asian economies recovered and the U.S. economy continued its solid expansion, he then began a series of interest-rate hikes in June 1999 that continued into 2000. On Jan. 4, 2000, Pres. Bill Clinton nominated Greenspan to a fourth four-year term. He married television journalist Andrea Mitchell in 1997.\n\nGreenstock, Sir Jeremy (Quentin) (b. July 27, 1943, Harrow, England), British diplomat; knighted 1998. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1998-2003).\n\nGreenup, Christopher (b. 1750, Loudoun county, Virginia - d. April 27, 1818, Blue Lick Springs resort, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1804-08).\n\nGregg, Hugh (b. Nov. 22, 1917, Nashua, N.H. - d. Sept. 24, 2003, Lebanon, N.H.), governor of New Hampshire (1953-55). Rising from alderman-at-large to mayor of his hometown of Nashua, he became at age 35 New Hampshire's youngest governor. He was a moderate Republican who based his administration on the notion that only growth could keep New Hampshire's tax rates down. He did not seek reelection after his single term, but made a comeback attempt in 1960 and lost.\n\nGregg, Judd (Alan) (b. Feb. 14, 1947, Nashua, N.H.), governor of New Hampshire (1989-93); son of Hugh Gregg.\n\nGregh, FranÃ§ois-Didier (b.

With the overthrow of Louis-Philippe in 1848, he was appointed commissary of the provisional government for his native dÃ©partement of Jura, and he subsequently served in the Constituent Assembly of 1848 and in the Legislative Assembly of 1849. Fearing the rise of Louis-NapolÃ©on (later Emperor NapolÃ©on III), he advocated a weak executive, a viewpoint he held throughout his career. He was out of office in 1851-68, practicing law but also engaging in Republican political activities. In 1868 he was elected to the Corps LÃ©gislatif, where he quickly emerged as a leader of the liberal opposition. After the fall of the Second Empire in 1870, he served as president of the new National Assembly (1871-73) and as president of the Chamber of Deputies (1876-79). In January 1879 when Marshal Patrice de Mac-Mahon, president of the republic, resigned, GrÃ©vy was elected to the post. As president, he strove to minimize his powers, preferring a strong legislature. In his foreign policy he resisted nationalist demands for revenge against Germany in the aftermath of the disastrous Franco-German War (1870-71) and opposed colonial expansion, though Annam and Tonkin became French protectorates during his presidency. He was reelected in 1885 but was forced to resign in 1887 in a furor over the sale of decorations for the LÃ©gion d'Honneur by his son-in-law, although he himself was not implicated.\n\nGrew, Joseph C(lark) (b. May 27, 1880, Boston, Mass. - d. May 25, 1965, Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.), acting U.S. secretary of state (1945).

Jan. 29, 2002, Chandigarh), governor of Madhya Pradesh (1989-90).\n\nA.H.G. Grey\n\nGrey, Albert Henry George Grey, (4th) Earl, (4th) Viscount Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (4th) Baron Grey of Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (5th) Baronet (of Howick) (b. Nov. 28, 1851, St. James Palace, London, England - d. Aug. 29, 1917, Howick, Northumberland, England), governor general of Canada (1904-11); nephew of Henry George Grey, Earl Grey. A Liberal, he sat (1880-86) in the British House of Commons before succeeding to his earldom (1894). He also served (1896-97) as administrator of Mashonaland. In Canada, Grey was extremely popular as governor general, and a Canadian football trophy, the Grey Cup, bears his name.\n\nGrey, Charles Grey, (2nd) Earl, (2nd) Viscount Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (2nd) Baron Grey of Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (3rd) Baronet (of Howick), courtesy titles (1801-06) Baron Grey, (1806-07) Viscount Howick (b. March 13, 1764, Fallodon, Northumberland, England - d. July 17, 1845, Howick, Northumberland), British prime minister (1830-34). When only 22 he was elected member of Parliament for Northumberland. When the French Revolution of 1789 revived the political agitation caused by the American Revolution, Grey was one of the young Whig aristocrats who formed the Society of the Friends of the People (1792) to encourage lower and middle-class demands for parliamentary reform, but his reform bill of 1797 was heavily defeated. When in 1806 Lord Grenville formed the so-called government of All the Talents, Grey (now Lord Howick) became first lord of the Admiralty. When Charles James Fox died the same year, Grey took his place as foreign secretary and leader of the Foxite Whigs. The dismissal of the ministry the following year, the loss of his seat for Northumberland, followed by his removal in 1807 to the House of Lords, increased his political detachment. Between 1815 and 1830 Grey was patron, rather than leader, of the quarrelsome and divided Whig opposition. In 1830 his opportunity came at last. The collapse of the Duke of Wellington's ministry brought Grey into office with popular backing for a reform of the antiquated parliamentary representative system. Still, the extent of the changes proposed in his bill of 1831 staggered even his own supporters, and it needed a fresh general election and the coercion of the House of Lords before the bill ultimately passed into law in 1832. A wave of popular enthusiasm sustained him during the long battle and returned a vast liberal majority to the House of Commons in 1833. He retired from politics in 1834.\n\nE. Grey\n\nGrey, Sir Edward, (3rd) Baronet, also called (from 1916) (1st) Viscount Grey of Fallodon (b. April 25, 1862, London, England - d. Sept. 7, 1933, Fallodon, near Embleton, Northumberland, England), British foreign secretary (1905-16); grandson of Sir George Grey (1799-1882). A relative of the 2nd Earl Grey, a former prime minister, Edward Grey was reared in a strong Whig-Liberal tradition. He succeeded to his grandfather's baronetcy in 1882. From 1885 to 1916 he sat in the House of Commons. On Dec. 10, 1905, Grey began his service as foreign secretary, under the new Liberal prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. After the assassination of the Austrian archduke Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo (June 28, 1914), Grey and the German emperor Wilhelm II independently proposed that Austria-Hungary, without resorting to war, obtain satisfaction from Serbia by occupying Belgrade, which the Serbian government had abandoned. When all peace moves failed, Grey won over a divided cabinet to accept the war by tying British intervention to Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium rather than to Britain's dubious alliance with France. His comment about the war became proverbial: \"The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.\" He was responsible for the secret Treaty of London (April 26, 1915), by which Italy joined Great Britain and her allies, and tried to solicit U.S. support for the Allied cause. In July 1916 he was awarded a viscountcy. On Dec. 5, 1916, he retired as foreign secretary after the longest uninterrupted tenure of that office in history. In 1919 he was sent on a special mission to the United States in a futile attempt to secure U.S. entry into the League of Nations. In 1923-24, despite increasing blindness, he led the Liberal opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nGrey, Sir George, (2nd) Baronet (b. May 11, 1799, Gibraltar - d. Sept. 9, 1882, Fallodon, Northumberland, England), British home secretary (1846-52, 1855-58, 1861-66); nephew of Charles Grey, Earl Grey; cousin of Henry George Grey, Earl Grey. He was also chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1841, 1859-61) and secretary of state for the colonies (1854-55). He succeeded as baronet in 1828.\n\nGrey, Sir George (b. April 14, 1812, Lisbon, Portugal - d. Sept. 19, 1898, London, England), governor of South Australia (1841-45), New Zealand (1845-53, 1861-68), and Cape Colony (1854-61), superintendent of Auckland (1875-76), and premier of New Zealand (1877-79); knighted 1848.\n\nGrey, Henry George Grey, (3rd) Earl, (3rd) Viscount Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (3rd) Baron Grey of Howick (in the County of Northumberland), (4th) Baronet (of Howick), courtesy title (1807-45) Viscount Howick (b. Dec. 28, 1802, Howick, Northumberland, England - d. Oct. 9, 1894, Howick), British politician. A member of the House of Commons from 1826 to 1845, he subsequently was Whig leader in the House of Lords. During the prime ministry of his father, the 2nd Earl Grey, he served as undersecretary of state for the colonies (1830-33) and resigned when the cabinet refused to bind itself to undertake the immediate abolition of slavery. He was appointed undersecretary for home affairs and became secretary at war (1835-39) in the administration of Lord Melbourne. In 1841 he was celebrated for his debates in opposition to the protectionist policy of Sir Robert Peel's administration. He became secretary of state for war and the colonies in 1846 and six years later resigned with his associates; he never again held office. He opposed Lord Aberdeen's policy in declaring war against Russia. Striving to introduce free trade into relations between Great Britain and her colonies, Grey was mainly successful in Canada, where his appointment of the 8th Earl of Elgin as governor general, and his subsequent support of Elgin's policies, led to the first British recognition (in the late 1840s) of local self-government. His constitution for New Zealand, however, proved unworkable, as did his attempt to settle convicts in the Cape Colony (South Africa).\n\nGrey, Thomas Philip de Grey, (2nd) Earl de, (3rd) Baron Grantham, (5th) Baron Lucas, (6th) Baronet, original surname Robinson (b. Dec. 8, 1781, London, England - d. Nov. 14, 1859, London), lord lieutenant of Ireland (1841-44); brother of Frederick John Robinson, Earl of Ripon; son of Thomas Robinson, Baron Grantham. He was also British first lord of the Admiralty (1834-35). He succeeded as Baron Grantham in 1786 and as baronet in 1792, changed his surname to Weddell in 1803, and succeeded as Earl de Grey and Baron Lucas and changed his surname to de Grey in 1833.\n\nGrey, Sir William (b. March 26, 1818 - d. May 15, 1878, Marldon, near Torquay, England), lieutenant governor of Bengal (1867-71) and governor of Jamaica (1874-77); knighted 1870.\n\nGrey, William George (b.

Dec. 7, 1946, Bathurst [now Banjul], Gambia), foreign minister of The Gambia (2007-08). In 1997-99 he was ambassador to the United States, Brazil, and Venezuela and high commissioner to Canada, and in 1999-2002 high commissioner to Sierra Leone and ambassador to CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Liberia. In 2002-06 he was permanent representative to the United Nations. He was also minister of higher education, research, science, and technology (2007, 2008-09).\n\nGrey of Naunton, Ralph Francis Alnwick Grey, Baron (b. April 15, 1910, Wellington, New Zealand - d. Oct. 17, 1999), British colonial administrator. Grey, who was knighted in 1956, was appointed deputy governor-general in Nigeria in 1957, serving until 1959. From 1959 to 1964 he was governor of British Guiana, then was governor of the Bahamas from 1964 to 1968. After his appointment to the House of Lords in 1968 he became Baron Grey of Naunton. He served as governor of Northern Ireland from 1968 until 1973, when that title was abolished. Subsequently, many of those powers were assumed by the Northern Ireland secretary, a member of the cabinet. He was deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Development Corporation from 1973 to 1979, and president of the Britain-Nigeria Association from 1983 to 1989.\n\nGrey-Wilson, Sir William (b. April 7, 1852, Kent, England - d. Feb. 14, 1926), governor of Saint Helena (1887-97), the Falkland Islands (1897-1904), and the Bahamas (1904-12); knighted 1904.\n\nGreyg, Samuil (Alekseyevich) (b.

He was also state comptroller (1874-78).\n\nGrice, Norman (b. 1893, Bradford, Yorkshire, England - d. ...), resident commissioner of Penang (1946).\n\nGrier, Sir Selwyn Macgregor (b. April 22, 1878 - d. Nov. 8, 1946), governor of Trinidad and Tobago (acting, 1929-30) and the Windward Islands (1935-37); knighted 1934.\n\nGriffin, (Samuel) Marvin (b. Sept. 4, 1907, Bainbridge, Ga. - d. June 13, 1982, Tallahassee, Fla.), governor of Georgia (1955-59).\n\nA. Griffith\n\nGriffith, Arthur (Joseph), Irish Art Ã GrÃ­obhtha (b. March 31, 1871, Dublin, Ireland - d. Aug. 12, 1922, Dublin), president of the Irish Republic (1922). He sought to divert the Irish from their attempt to win self-government through legislative action in the British House of Commons. Instead, he urged passive resistance. At a meeting in Dublin (October 1902), the Cumann nan Gaedheal (Society of Gaels) announced this policy, which was called Sinn FÃ©in (We Ourselves). By 1905 the name had been transferred from the policy to its adherents. British authorities incarcerated him with other Sinn FÃ©in members in Frongoch, a detention camp in Merioneth, Wales (May-December 1916). After their release, Eamon de Valera was elected leader. Griffith was jailed twice more for his anti-British journalism. After the Sinn FÃ©in electoral victory in December 1918, the Irish members of the House of Commons met as the DÃ¡il Ãireann (Assembly of Ireland). They went beyond Griffith's plan, however, and declared for a republic with de Valera as president and Griffith as vice president. During de Valera's long absence in North America (1919-20), Griffith acted as head of the Irish Republic and carried out his own program of civil disobedience. In the fall of 1921, Griffith unwillingly went to London as leader of the Irish delegation to the self-government treaty conference. Finally agreeing to exclude six Ulster counties from the republic, he was the first Irish delegate to accept the British terms, later embodied in the Anglo-Irish Treaty (Dec. 6, 1921). When the DÃ¡il narrowly approved the treaty (Jan. 8, 1922), de Valera resigned, and Griffith was elected president of the Irish Republic. Opposition to the treaty led to the outbreak of civil war in Ireland (June 28, 1922). Exhausted from overwork, Griffith died soon afterward.\n\nGriffith, Charles Duncan (b. 1830, Grahamstown, Cape Colony [now in Eastern Cape, South Africa] - d.

July 21, 1948, Savignone, Genova province [now Genova metropolitan city], Italy), Italian politician. He first became known as a comedian. His open criticism of Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi in 1986 and his characterization of the Socialists as a party of thieves resulted in his de facto blacklisting from television. (Grillo was vindicated when Craxi later fled the country and was convicted in absentia of corruption.) He then toured Italy, mixing comedy and political commentary in his live performances. He exposed corporate misconduct and political corruption. On Sept. 8, 2007, he organized V-Day (\"V\" being the first letter of an Italian obscenity that was directed at the political class), a nationwide protest that drew over one million participants. He co-founded (with Gianroberto Casaleggio) the Five Star Movement, a political party espousing a broadly populist, anti-establishment platform, in 2009. The \"five stars\" represented public water supply, sustainable development, widespread Internet connectivity, clean and accessible public transportation, and environmental protection. He became one of the most popular political figures in Italy, and the movement garnered widespread support. In 2012 Five Star candidates won local elections in Parma and Sicily, and early parliamentary elections in February 2013 placed Grillo at the centre of European politics. Five Star candidates claimed roughly one-fourth of the seats in both houses, preventing the formation of a stable government. According to Five Star's bylaws, Grillo himself was forbidden to hold office because of a past conviction for involuntary manslaughter. In 2015, just a year after the party made gains in the European Parliament elections, he announced that he was leaving politics and returning to comedy. Luigi Di Maio was elected leader in 2017 and, although Grillo said that unless the party won an outright majority it should remain in opposition, entered government alongside the right-wing League after elections in 2018.\n\nGrima, Christopher (b.

After serving in a Scottish infantry regiment from 1939 to 1947, he was appointed secretary of the Scottish National Trust, which was concerned with the preservation of historic buildings. In 1945 he was asked to stand as the Liberal Party's candidate for Orkney and Shetland islands, Britain's northernmost constituency, but he lost by a narrow margin. In 1950 he ran again, but this time he won and was soon chosen Liberal whip. In 1956 he was elected leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party and set out to revitalize the party. He attacked the 1957 Suez invasion and set the Liberals in opposition to an independent British nuclear deterrent. The Liberals had been the first party to favour entry into the European Economic Community in 1955, and he was vigorous in promoting the policy. He offered proposals for greater social and educational expenditure and called for \"co-partnership in industry\" between management and labour. His innovative approach and telegenic personality brought early success in 1958 with a major upset by-election victory for himself and increased support for the Liberals in other by-elections. In 1959 the Liberals more than doubled their vote of 1955, though they won only 6 seats. They carried 9 constituencies in 1964. Though the party won 12 seats in 1966, Grimond, dissatisfied with the rate of progress, relinquished the leadership in January 1967 but continued to represent his constituency. Briefly, for two months in 1976, he assumed a caretaker's role until David Steel replaced Jeremy Thorpe as party leader. In 1983 he moved to the House of Lords on becoming Baron Grimond.\n\nGrÃ­msson\n\nGrÃ­msson, Ãlafur Ragnar (b. May 14, 1943, ÃsafjÃ¶rdur, northwestern Iceland), president of Iceland (1996-2016).

He contributed articles to the clandestine patriotic and liberal publication Varpas (1889-1905; \"The Bell\") and was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Democrat (Liberal) Party in 1902. Before World War I his house at Marijampole was a gathering place for Lithuanian democrats, and he was persecuted by the tsarist Russian government. After World War I, as a leader of the Lithuanian Peasant Populist Party, Grinius was a member of the Lithuanian constituent assembly. On June 8, 1920, he formed a cabinet that on June 12 signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. He resigned as prime minister on Feb. 1, 1922. On June 7, 1926, he was elected president of Lithuania but after only six months in office a military coup was staged in order to thwart an alleged Communist plot and he was forced to resign, the founder of the Lithuanian republic, Antanas Smetona, being elected in his place. When the Germans invaded Lithuania in 1941, Grinius was asked to help establish a Nazi-controlled government. He refused, saying he would not sanction the shooting of Lithuanian Jews, deportation of Lithuanians to Germany, and colonization of Lithuania by Germans. When Soviet troops moved in to occupy Lithuania in 1944, he fled to Germany. He went to the United States in 1947.\n\nGrinko, Grigory (Fyodorovich) (b.
