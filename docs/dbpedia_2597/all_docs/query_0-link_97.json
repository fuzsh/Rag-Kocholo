Although Dugdale makes no mention of the Grey family before the time of Richard I., yet, it appears from good authority, they were of ancient descent and great eminency long prior to that aera.âBANKS. This family rose to the highest eminence in England, where they were ennobled by the titles of Duke of Suffolk and Kent, Earl of Stamford, Baron Grey, of Codnor, Ruthyn, Wilton, Rolleston, Wark, Chillingham, Howick, and had the honour of producing that truly estimable characterâLady Jane Grey, who fell an innocent victim to the ambition of her father, the Duke of Suffolk.âDOUGLAS. The descent of this family is deduced, by a French genealogist and antiquary of great repute (Francis de Belleforest, of Cominges), from Rollo, chamberlain to the Duke of Normandy. It is one of the most ancient and illustrious in Peerage.âBURKE.\n\nWARK CASTLE has been in the possession of the Greys for several centuries. It was originally built by K. HENRY II but is at present almost level with the ground.\n\nThis noted stronghold of the Greys, in Border wars so fam'd a spot,\n\nWas built at first in ancient days; to guard the country from the Scot,\n\nWho oft fell here, or ran away, pursued and routed by the GREY.\n\nOn Stone C. J. Gulliford\n\nPrinted by Metchim & Burt.\n\n5. THE MILFIELD MS. 1 THE noble antient and flourishing familey of Grey are descended from Rollo,1 who was chamberlain to Robt. Duke of Normandy and of his Gift had the Castle and honour of Croy in Picardy from whence his Posterity assumed there name of De Croy. The above-mentioned Rollo had a daughter named Arietta who was mother to William the Conqueror, Anschitel De Croy2 comeing into England with William the Conqueror obtained Divers lands in the County of Oxford and Elsewhere and from him sprang many great and Illustrious familys in England, afterwards called De Grey, such as the Dukes of Kent and Suffolk, The Marquis of Dorset, Earls of Tankervills and Stamford, The Barons of Wark and Chillingham Wilton Codnor, Ruthin and Roleston. There is an account given by antient writers and particularly in an old history of Northumberland of one of the familey of Grey of Heton. Richard Grey who, in the Reign of Henry the 3rd accompanying John Vescy of Alnwick Castle to the Holy wars, these two English Barons were Emminent Cheftains in the Christian army, and led by Curiosity or Devotion they went together to visit the monks of mount Carmell and they their found a Countryman of their own, one Ralph Fresborn, a Northumberland man.\n\n6. 2 When Vesey and Grey Returned to England they prevailed upon the superior of the Carmelites to let Fresborn go with them to England upon Condition they should found a monastry of Carmelites in their own Country, which they accordingly did; the Place they fixed upon was Hulne Induced as supposed from the Resemblance the adjoining hill Bore to mount Carmel this was the first monastry of Carmelite Friars in these Kingdoms. (Founded in 1240)\n\n3 Heton Castle was then the chief seat of the Grey family which hath been very antient in Northumberland and Famous for Divers military Exploits The Castle was a staitly noble Building, and nearly Square, a Court on the West side called the Lyon's Court, and on the North side an extraordinary spacious Vault that 100 horses might stand in, was in the year 1270 (3) the estate of Sir John Grey who in that year founded a monastry at Berwick for the Order of White Friars. (Henry 3rd. Wallis History of North. Page 1.)\n\nSucceeded by Sir Ralph Grey An Inquisition Post mortum taken after the Death of Ralph Grey shews amongst many other estates that the manor of Howick was then in the Possession of the Grey Family. Heton Castle then the seat of Sir Thomas Grey Capt- of Norham Castle who Defended it against the Scotch (who then Besieged it) with Great Bravery and obliged them to Desist from there Ienterprise and Retire. (This inqision was produced at a trial of Law at the Assizes at Newcastle, 23 Agt, 1770, between the Duke of Northumberld. and Sir H. Grey Bat.)\n\n4 In Edward the second's time Thos- De Grey being Governour of the Castles of Couper and Fife in Scotland came into that Realm shortley after his Coronation and with twenty-six men Broke through those forces which Gualter De Bickerton had laid to Intrap him Other Particulars no less memorable (to witt) at the siege of Strayhelin\n\nNORHAM CASTLE. This episcopal fortress (which makes such a figure in border history) was generally in the keeping of the Greys. In 1318 it made a gallant defence against the Scots, who after a seige of nearly 12 months, were repulsed by the intripid governor, the renowned Sir Thomas Grey, who slew in a duel one Cryne a noted sea-robber said to be a Flemish admiral.\n\nThe Scots renewed their fierce attack resolved to force their way\n\nBut they as oft were driven back by brave Sir Thomas Grey.\n\n7. [Stryvelin] upon the Rescue of Lord Beaumont he received a dangerous wound under his Eye, he was taken Prisoner by the Earl of Murray by a too eager and forward a pursuit of the Scots, he was governour of Norham Castle where he was twice Besieged by the Scots once for near six months the other for full seven months, he slew one Crymas a Scottish admiral who had been a Great Robber at sea, he had a Charter of Free Warren throughout all his lordships of Fenton Nesbit Doddington North and South and Middlemost Mid-dleton Howick Eworthheddon, and hawkhill in the County of Northld and that he routed the Earls of Southerland and March upon their Invasion of the North whilst King Edward the 3rd was at the siege of Tournay Sir John Grey of Heton created Knight of the Garter at the Foundation of that order by King Ed. 3rd (Camden says) and here I am willing to set down their names that were first Chosen into this order and be commonly called the Founders of the order for their Renown is not to be abolished who in those days for stout Courage warlike Prowesses had few or no Peeres and were in that regard advanced to this honour Edward King of England 3rd Sr- Thos- Holland Edward his eldest son Pr- Wales Sr- John Grey4 Heny- Duke Lancaster Sr- Richd- Fitz Simon Thos- Earl of Warwick Sr- Miles Stapelton The Capdall de Buch Sr- ThoÂ«- Walle Earl of Stratford Sr-Hugh Wortlesley Earl of Sarisburie Sr- Niel Loring Ralph Mortimer Earl of Marsh Sr- John Chanders Sr- Joh Lile Sr- James Audely Sr- Barth.

This Sir John Grey Being a man of great action in his time was in the 2nd Henry 5th with that King at the siege of Caen in Normandy, and in the 4th Henry 5th Retained by Indenture to serve him in his wars of France with 40 men at arms whereof himself and one other Knight to be part of the number the rest Esquires, and one hundred and twenty archers having for himself and the other Knigh 4sh- per day and for the esqrs- 1s. per day being then stiled Sir John Grey of heton Knight, he behaved himself so valienly in that service that as a reward for the same he had the next Ensuing Year a grant from\n\n9. the King of the Castles and Lordships of Tilye in Normandy to hold to him and the Heirs\" male of his Body In the 5 of Hen. 5th upon the Taking of Sir John Oldcastle the Chief of the Lollards who was found in the Poweys lands he was sent with a Guard to fetch him up to Parliment. 6 Hen 5th he was Capt. of Gaunt, and in Consideration of his services had a Grant Bearing date at Rohen the 31st January of the Earldom of Tankerville Normandy with all the appurtenances to hold to him and the Heirs male of his Body By homage and the Delivering of a Bassinet (or Helmet) at the Castle of Bouen on the feast Day of St. George Yearly (The Title of Tankerville 1419) He was again in the Wars of France and the same Year made Governer of Harfleur and in the 8 Year Hen 5th in farther Recompence of his many and Great services had a Grant of the Lordships of Chartelaw, Griences and Dappily with their appurtinances lying also in the Duchy of Normandy which were part of the Possessions of Sir John Harpeden Kt. whereof he had been disposesed of by the King's Enemies and recovered by the Valour of Sir John Grey which Grant was likewise to him and the Heirs male of his Body In the same year he was also made Governour of the Castle of Tournay in Normandy, and in the 9th Year of Hen. 5 being again in the wars of France with Thos- Duke of Clarence Passing a River and marsh near the Castle of Beaufort in some Disorder had the hard fate together with that Duke and Divers other Gallent Englishmen to be slain. (the title of Tankerville Extinct) as it does not appear he left Issue as is supposed by Dugdale that author haveing Blended by mistake the Peddigree of some of the Familey of the Greys of Kent and that of Heton for it appears that this Earl of Tankerville was succeeded by Sir Ralph Grey of Wark his brother* (if not the title have remained in the familey being Granted to the Heirs male of his Body. 9 .

H.] :â The aforesaid Edward Grey died in 1653, and was succeeded by his eldest son Philip, whose son and daughters dying without issue, his nephew, John Grey of Howick (only son of John Grey of Acton, who married Dorothy Lisle) became his heir. This gentleman married the daughter of Pearson, by whom he had three sons, viz. :â1. Sir Henry. 2. Thomas, who died unmarried at Howick. 3. John Grey of Morwick, who married Ann daughter of Edward Grey of Alnwick, by whom he had three daugh-\n\n16. ters and three sons, viz.âMargaret-Anne, who married John Grey, already mentioned; and Mary, who married William Hay; John, a Captain in the army, killed in Germany; Henry, a Lieutenant in the royal navy; and Charles of Morwick, who married Catherine, daughter of the Eev. John Skelly, by Lady Betty Gordon, his wife, and died in 1814, leaving a son, Sir John Grey, Lieutenant-general in the army, K.C.B., who at his decease, in 1856, bequeathed his estate of Morwick to his relative, the Right Hon. Sir Geo. Grey, Bart., Secretary of State for the Home Department. The sisters of General Grey were Ann, married to the Rev. John Hunter, and Catherine the wife of John Burrell, Esq., father of Capt. George Burrell. The said John Grey, was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Grey, Esq., who was created a Baronet, 11th January, 1746. Sir Henry served the office of Sheriff for the County Northumberland, 1736. He married Hannah, daughter of Thomas Wood, Esq., of Falloden, by whom he had five sons and four daughters, of whom wereâHenry, his successor, as second Baronet, who died unmarried in 1808, when the Baronetcy devolved upon the late Earl; Thomas, who fell in a duel with Lord Pomfret, and buried in South Audley chapel; Margaret, married to Sir Grey Cooper; Elizabeth, married to Sir James Pennyman, Bart. Sir Henry died in 1749; his fourth son, Sir Charles Grey, K.B., having adopted the military profession, was advanced to the rank of Major-general in 1777, Lieutenant-general in 1782, and General in 1796. Sir Charles acquired distinction in the first American war, in which he had an important command; in 1794 on the breaking out of hostilities with the Republic of France he was appointed Commander-in-chief of the land forces, sent to reduce the West India Islands, in conjunction with Lord St. Vincent who had charge of the naval operations; on January 8th, 1783, he was invested with the ensigns of the order of the Bath ; into which however he was not installed till the 19th May, 1788. He earned this distinction by his long military services in the preceding contest with America; and by a regular gradation of active employment from the time of his first entry into the army. He was Aid-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand at the battle of Minden, at which he was wounded in the foot; he was also with General Wolfe at\n\nHOWICK HALL\n\nSEAT OF EARL GREY\n\n17. the taking of Quebec. In 1797 he was sworn one of his Majesty's Privy-council. At length worn out with age, and active services, he retired to his seat in his native county, to pass the remainder of his days in the bosom of his family. His Majesty, however, was not forgetful of his merits, even in retirement, for, during the Addington administration, he was elevated to the peerage by the title of Baron Grey de Howick, in the county of Northumberland, by patent, dated 23rd May, 1801; and was further advanced to be Viscount Howick, and Earl Grey, 11th April, 1806. He died 14th November, 1807, aged 78, being then governor of Guernsey. His remains were conveyed, on Thursday, the 26th of the same month, from Falloden House, for interment at Howick, where they were deposited in the family vault. The funeral was attended by the Earl, his son (and Countess), Mr. and Lady Elizabeth Whitbread, the Hon. and Kev. Mr. Grey (afterwards bishop of Hereford), and the Hon. Commissioner Grey. His Lordship's charities were only limited by his means, his heart was unbounded, and no deserving object ever sought relief at Falloden House in vain. The same benevolent spirit which he carried with him into retirement was uniformly displayed in his military career, through the whole of which the comfort of the private soldier was a peculiar object of his care. His Lordship married, in 1762, Elizabeth daughter of George Grey Esq., of Southwick, by whom (who died 26th May, 1822) he had issue:â1. Charles, Viscount Howick. 2. Sir Henry-George, G.C.B., G.C.H., a General in the army, and Colonel 13th light dragoons, born 25th October, 1766; married 20th August, 1812, Charlotte, only daughter of the late Sir Charles Des Voeux, Bart.; and died 11th January, 1845. 3. Sir George, K.C.B., Captain, R.N., created a Baronet 2nd July, 1814, died 3rd October, 1828. 4. William, Lieut.-colonel in the army, who was born 20th October, 1777, and dying 10th August, 1817, left issue by his wife, Maria, daughter of General William Shirreff:âWilliam-Thomas, born 22nd April, 1807; married 7th January, 1841, Maria-Georgiana, second daughter of Captain William-Henry Shirreff, R.N., Superintendent of the Dockyard at Chatham; Charles-Conrad, Captain, R.N., born 2nd January 1817; married, 23rd April, 1844, Caroline Nesbit, eldest\n\n18. daughter of the late Major Turner Macan, of Carriff, co. Armagh, and died 29th May, 1848; Maria-Susanna; Emily-Hannah, married, in 1837, to James Duberley, Esq., of Gaines Hall, Huntingdonshire. 5. Edward, Bishop of Hereford, Prebendary of Westminster, born 25th March, 1782; married, first, 21st March, 1809, Charlotte-Elizabeth, daughter of James Croft, Esq., of Greenham, Berks, by whom (who died 26th May, 1821) he had issueâEdward, Lieutenant, R.N., died in 1835; Charles, married Sarah, daughter of W. Gyde, Esq., of Cheltenham, and died in 1839; Leopold-James-Henry, Bengal Civil Service, married, in 1842, Emily-Maria, daughter of Lieut.-colonel Costley, and died in 1845; William, married, 1845, Margaret Hungerford, daughter of W. Jackson, Esq., E.I.C.C.S.; Elizabeth, married, 1836, to the Rev.

H. R. Lloyd, Vicar of Carew, Pembroke; Hannah-Jane. The Bishop married secondly, 1824, Elizabeth, daughter of the Right Hon. Sir Robert Adair, G.C.B., and by her (who died in 1829) had issue:âFred. - Septimus, born 12th June, 1826; Alexander-Thomas, born 12th June, 1826, and died 29th May, 1836; Francis-Douglas, born 11th April, 1828; Arthur-John, born 10th September, 1829. The Bishop married thirdly, 1831, Eliza, daughter of John Innis, Esq.; and by her had one son and two daughters; Alfred, born 1834; Louisa and Alithea-Emma. He died 24th July, 1837. The sisters of the Bishop wereâ1. Lady Elizabeth, born 7th April, 1765, married January 18th, 1789, Samuel Whitbread, Esq., M.P., for Bedford, and had issue, Elizabeth born 21st December, 1791; William born 4th January, 1795; Samuel-Charles, born 16th February, 1796; and Emma-Laura, born 19th January, 1798. 2. Lady Hannah-Althea, married 24th August, 1807, Captain Bettesworth of the Tartar frigate, who was killed in action 25th May, 1808; and after his decease was the wife of the Right Hon. Edward Ellice. Charles, second Earl K.G., succeeded his father the 14th November, 1807; he succeeded also his uncle, Sir Henry Grey of Howick, at whose decease the year following he became third Baronet.\n\nFALLODON,\n\nSEAT OF SIR GEORGE GREY, BART.\n\n19. Lord Grey was born at Falloden, near Alnwick, on the 15th of March, 1764, the eldest son of Sir Charles Grey, K.B., the first Earl Grey, by Elizabeth, daughter of George Grey, of Southwick, co. Durham, Esq. He received his education first at Eton, and subsequently at King's College, Cambridge. At the age of eighteen he visited the continent, and made the tour of several of the European States. Whilst in Italy he made the acquaintance of H.R.H. Henry-Frederick, Duke of Cumberland, who gave him an appointment in his household. He returned to his native country in 1786, and in the same year he was returned to parliament for the county of Northumberland, the vacancy having been occasioned by the elevation of Lord Lovaine to the Upper House. He had not, however, completed his twenty-first year until two or three days previous to that on which he took his seat. To the surprise of his connections, whose political principles were on the other side, he immediately joined the Whig party, then in opposition under Charles Fox. His first speech was delivered in the debate on Mr. Pitt's commercial treaty with France, and gave presage of the talent by which his long parliamentary career was subsequently distinguished. The oratorical ability which he displayed on this occasion secured him a foremost position in the House; and during the same session, which was his first, he was named one of the managers in the impeachment of Warren Hastings; and from that time he always took a leading part in the debates. In 1792, Mr. Grey became a member of the Whig Club, and shortly afterwards of the great political confederation known as the \" Friends of the People,\" the avowed object of which was to obtain a reform in the system of parliamentary representation. At the head of this formidable association stood the names of the principal members of the Whig party, and it included thirty-two members of Parliament. Mr. Fox however, declined to enrol his name amongst them, ob-serving, \" Though I perceive great and enormous abuses, I do not see the remedy.\" The society, however, continued to grow in numbers, and increase in influence. A series of resolutions, passed at their meetings, and a declaration of the principles and objects of the society were printed and extensively circulated. On the 30th of April, Mr. Grey gave notice in the House of Commons of a motion, which in\n\n20. the course of the next session, he should submit to the consideration of the House, the object of which was a reform in the representation of the people. In 1793, he presented a petition from the Society of the Friends of the People, praying for a thorough reform in, and a shorter duration of parliament; and then moved that this petition, with others presented at the same time, should be referred to a select committee, to examine and report thereon. After two long debates, the motion was negatived by a majority of 282 to 41. War with France was now considered, even by some of the oldest Whigs, to be a necessary evil; but Mr. Grey rather increased his opposition. On the defeat of the Duke of Brunswick, he declared that \" his retreat before the French armies was a triumph to every lover of liberty.\" The session of 1795 was marked by his opposing the grant for the liquidation of the Prince of Wales's debts, and his proposing that the addition should be reduced from Â£65,000 to Â£40,000. It was, however, negatived by a majority of 169 votes. His motion also for an impeachment of Mr. Pitt, and the whole body of ministers, for misapplying the public money, was lost by a great majority. In 1797 Mr. Grey brought forward his plan of Parliamentary Reform. He proposed to give the county of York four new members, and to divide each county into two districts, each returning a member. The right of voting was to be given to copyholders and leaseholders, as well as freeholders. In cities and boroughs, the elective franchise was to be extended to all householders paying taxes. Lastly, parliaments were to be triennial; his motion was supported by 91 votes, and negatived by a majority of 165. On this occasion Mr. Grey (only 33 years of age) made a long and eloquent speech, which concluded as follows:â\" When he looked abroad, and surveyed the face of Europe, there was no object, which to him, as an Englishman, attached to the constitution of his country, was so desirable as a respectable and independent House of Commons, speaking the sentiments, and consulting for the interest of the nation at large. In France a revolution had taken place; the principles at least in which it originated, whatever others might think of them, he should always defend. Stained it certainly had been with enormities, but ministers themselves had\n\n21. confessed that order was restored, and that they had asked pardon of God and man; for his own part he entertained a sanguine hope that, in the end, it would tend to the diffusion of liberty and rational knowledge all over the world; with this revolution, then, how ought the people of this country to be governed? The constitution ought to he restored to them; and when every abuse was reformed, the system would leave them nothing to regret. If you look to Ireland, you find the affairs in that country were every day becoming more alarming. God grant that a convulsion may not happen; but it can only be prevented by measures of reform and conciliation. If such an event should unfortunately take place in that country, would it not be wise to prevent all grounds for discontent in this, by removing in time every just cause of complaint? How was it possible that the House could possess the confidence of the people after having brought the country to suffer disgrace after disgrace; after being brought to the verge, if not into the gulf, of bankruptcy, without witnessing one effort, on the part of its representatives, to wipe off the stains it has received, or to save it from approaching ruin? Was it believed that the debates in that House were conducted with a view to the public good ? He admitted, for the sake of argument, that the side of the House with which he had the honour to act, were no more actuated than the other by motives of a pure disinterested nature; though, while he made the admission, his conscience acquitted him of the crime; was it not in every one's mouth that the object of the one party was to keep their places, and of the other to supplant them? And if such an opinion was entertained, how was it compatible with respect? \" These were the motives which induced him to submit to the House the motion which he should have to propose. There was one other point, which was personal to himself, and upon which, perhaps, he ought not at all to trouble the House. As long as he held a seat in that House he should think himself bound to perform the duty he owed to his constituents; but he considered it as unnecessary any longer to expose himself to that obloquy which he had sustained in acting the part which he found himself called upon to take in the discussions of that House. Seeing calamity succeed calamity, and that every effort of his had hitherto been ineffectual in stemming the\n\n22. tide of misfortune, he despaired of a continuance of his efforts being more successful; and therefore, though he should always in future be present, to vote for or against any measures by which the interests of his constituents might be affected, after that night he should not think proper to trouble the House with any observations.\" Mr. Grey concluded with moving, ' That leave be given to bring in a bill to amend and regulate the election of members to serve in the Commons House of Parliament.'\" Mr. Grey, until the death of Mr. Pitt, continued one of his most strenuous opponents. One of his ablest speeches was made on the subject of the union between Ireland and England, to which measure he avowed his hostility in terms of the bitterest denunciation. In January, 1806, Mr. Pitt died, and Mr. Fox was called to the administration of public affairs. Mr. Grey who, by the elevation of his father to the peerage had become Lord Howick, was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the Cabinet; in October following, the country was deprived of the services of Mr. Fox. Lord Howick then became leader of the House of Commons, and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The abolition of the slave trade was proposed by this administration; the Sovereign took alarm at the attempt of ministers to relieve Roman Catholics from some of their existing disabilities, and they were dismissed; parliament was dissolved; Lord Howick, not choosing to contest the county of Northumberland, took his seat for Appleby. The death of his father, which occurred shortly after, removed him to the upper house of parliament on the 14th November, 1807. For some years after, his time was passed in the leisure and retirement of private life. Of his domestic circle Madame de Stael observes, that \" into no English family did she ever enter with such high expectations, and in none had her highest idea been so completely fulfilled.\" When the Duke of Portland resigned in 1810, a negotiation was opened with Lords Grenville and Grey who, however, declared it to be quite inconsistent with their views to unite with the proposed ministry. Again, in February, 1812, the Regent expressed his wish to bring Earl Grey and Lord Grenville into the cabinet, deeming that a union of leading men would give confidence and satisfaction to the\n\n23. country; but the difficulties were insuperable; the Marquis Wellesley, and afterwards Lord Moira, failed in obtaining their co-operation. The joint letter addressed to the Duke of York, in which Lords Grey and Grenville declined the offer of peace and power, is dated 15th February, 1812. Again, in May the same year, after the tragical death of Mr. Perceval, the same noblemen received another overture, but which they also declined.11 The retirement of the Earl of Liverpool, in 1827, placed Mr. Canning at the head of affairs. Lord Grey declined to support that statesman. His Lordship, after the death of Mr. Canning, in a speech on the second reading of the Roman Catholic Relief Bill in 1829, justified himself for having declined to extend to the deceased statesman's administration his active support. Lord Grey took a prominent part in the trial of Queen Caroline, on whose behalf he was induced to come forward with the utmost eloquence and fervour; and to the powerful effect of his able defence was mainly due the ultimate defeat of her accusers. After this his life was passed principally in the bosom of his family, until the sudden termination of the Wellington Administration in 1830, brought him forth from his retirement to assume the reins of Government. During; the four years he continued in office, he carried Parliamentary Reform and the Abolition of Slavery. After his retirement from office, in 1834, he took no part in politics, but resided principally at Howick with his family. The character of Earl Grey has been sketched as follows:â \"Nature and fortune united to lavish their choicest gifts upon the deceased nobleman; in his lot were combined birth, wealth, talents, education, and a wide field of action; and when he made his celebrated declaration,âthat he would stand or fall by his order, it is impossible not to acknowledge that it was men like himself who made that order, indeed the Corinthian one of our national architecture. The most splendid qualities, when aided by opportunities for displaying them, seldom fail to raise their possessor to personal distinction, but their good or evil influence on the welfare of society is purely accidental, unless they are accompanied by judgment to give them a proper direction. The character of the noble Earl, though he was some-\n\n24. times, even at the commencement of his career, accused of being a party man, forbids all suspicion that he was actuated by any other principle than that of honour. His defence of the Prince of Wales's rights, when he thought they were endangered, and his opposition to an intended augmentation of that illustrious personage's revenues, when he thought it impolitic, evidence the presence of a strong sense of public duty. His stern rejection of the fascinations of power, though offered by the representative of majesty, rather than associate himself with men of whose political principles he disapproved, must be admitted by his enemies, if, indeed, such a man could have an enemy, to demonstrate his integrity.\" That all his public measures were designed by him for the good of his country, there can be no doubt, but it would be premature to venture an opinion on their ultimate issue; posterity is the only tribunal where the talents and efforts of this distinguished patriot can be fairly judged and duly appreciated. In person Lord Grey was tall, slender, and of a singularly dignified bearing; the expression of his face, though the features were small, was rather severe, but intellectual and commanding. His eloquence was of a fervid and masculine order, with a noble air of superiority, giving the idea of one of the ancient, classic orators, more than any modern speaker. This veteran statesman died at Howick Hall, Northumberland, on the 17th July, 1845, in his eighty-second year, being at the time of his decease, the second Earl Grey and Viscount Howick, Baron Grey of Howick, the third Baronet, K.G., a Privy Councillor, an Elder Brother of the Trinity House, and a Governor of the Charter House; a Vice-president of the Marine Society, Commissioner of the Land Tax, and a Trustee of the National Gallery, &c, &c. Lord Grey married 18th November, 1794, the Honourable Mary-Elizabeth Ponsonby, only daughter of William Brabazon, first Lord Ponsonby of Imokilly, and by that lady had issue ten sons and five daughters. Their names are as follows :âI. Henry, present Earl, born 28th December, 1802, succeeded his father at the age of 43; married 9th August, 1832, Maria, daughter of Sir Joseph Copley, Bart., of Sprotborough.

S. Newcastle, 6th September, 1837.\n\nINSCRIPTION.\n\nThis column was erected in 1838, to commemorate the service rendered to this Country by CHARLES, EARL GREY, K.G. who, during an active political career of nearly half a century, was the constant advocate of peace, and the fearless and constant companion of Civil and Religious liberty. He first directed his efforts to the amendment of representation of the people in 1792, and was the minister by whose advice, and under whose guidance the great measure of Parliamentary Reform was, after and arduous & protracted struggle, safely and triumphantly achieved, in the year 1932.\n\n27. NOTES 1. Banks calls him Rollo or Fulbert; and Playfair says:â\"This Rollo most probably was a direct descendant of Rollo, the Chief Commander, a Dane who in the ninth century invaded the Northern provinces of France, whom King Charles III., of France, afterwards converted to the Christian faith, and giving him his daughter Gisela in marriage, and with her the whole dukedom of Normandy. Rollo was succeeded by his son William, who was father of Richard, the father of the famous Robert, Duke of Normandy, whose illegitimate son, William, afterwards conquered and became King of England, It is not a little singular, that for several centuries the Danes were the only conquering nation in Europe; and at nearly the same period that Rollo invaded and conquered Normandy, they sailed up the river Seine, and burned Paris once, and a second time compelled the inhabitants to pay a large sum in money to prevent a similar catastrophe. The Seine cannot be ascended in winter without towing, on account of the rapidity of the current, and in summer is very shallow, yet the enemy arrived in boats, and burned the capital of Charlemagne, not much more than a century after his splendid conquests.â This aforesaid Rollo, the conqueror of Normandy, was a Norwegian duke, who, on account of his piracies, was banished from his country by Harold Harfager, who conquered Norway in 870. He first retired with his fleet among the islands of the Hebrides to the north-west of Scotland, whither the flower of the Norwegian nobility had fled for refuge ever since Harold had become master of the whole kingdom. He was there received with open arms by those warriors who, eager for conquest and revenge, waited only for a chief to undertake some glorious enterprise. Rollo setting himself at their head, and seeing his power formidable sailed towards England, which had been long, as it were, a field open on all sides to the violence of the northern nations. But the great Alfred had, some years before, established such order in his part of the island that Rollo, after several fruitless attempts, despaired of forming there such a settlement at should make him amends for the loss of his own country. He pretended, therefore, to have had a supernatural dream, which promised him a glorious fortune in France, and which served at least to support the ardour of his followers. The weakness of the government in that kingdom, and the confusion in which it was\n\n28. involved, were still more persuasive reasons to insure them of success. Having, therefore, sailed up the Seine to Rouen, he immediately took that capital of the province, then called Neustria, and making it his magazine of arms, he advanced to Paris, to which he laid seige in form. This war, at length, ended in the entire cession of Neustria, which Charles the Simple was obliged to give up to Rollo and his Normans in order to purchase a peace. Rollo received it in perpetuity to himself and his posterity, as a feudal duchy dependent on the crown of France. A description of the interview between Charles and this new duke, gives us a curious picture of the manners of these Normans (as they were called by foreigners); for the latter would not take the oath of fealty to his Sovereign lord any other way than by placing his hands within those of the king; and absolutely refused to kiss his feet, as custom then required. It was with great difficulty he was prevailed on to let one of his warriors perform this ceremony in his stead; but the officer to whom Rollo deputed this service, suddenly raised the king's foot so high that he overturned him on his back; a piece of rudeness which was only laughed at; to such a degree were the Normans feared and Charles despised. Soon after, Rollo was persuaded to embrace Christianity, and he was baptised with much ceremony by the Archbishop of Rouen in the cathedral of that city. As soon as he saw himself in full possession of Normandy, he exhibited such virtues as rendered the province happy, and deserved to make his former outrages forgotten. Religious, wise, and liberal, this captain of pirates became, after Alfred, the greatest and most humane prince of his time. er Les Normands, peuples sortis du Nord, apres avoir pirate les long des cotes de la mer, se jetterent dans la France du tems de Charles le chauve, et y firent des degats incroyables. Ces courses durerent environ quatre-vints ans, pendant lesquels la resistance fut souvent inutile. Il en falut venir a des tributs honteux, et payer des sommes d'argent, qui ne fasoient qu'attirer les Barbares. Ils assiegerent trois fois Paris, et en effrayerent si fort les habitans dans le neuvieme siecle, que dans les oraisons publiques, ils prioient Dieu de les delivrer de la fureur des Normands. Le Roi Charles le Simple fit un traite avec les Normands, donna sa fille Gisle a Rollon, Rhou, ou Raoul, chef de ces peuples, et lui ceda la Normandie, lâan 912, avec le titre de Due, a condition qu'il tiendroit cette province a foi et hommage de la couronne. Rollon se fit batiser, et prit au bateme le nomme de Robert. Les Normands eurentant de consideration pour lâequite de ce premier Due, qu'ils semblent encore l'appeller a leur secours, par le cri de Haro, comme s'ils disoient Ha Rou. Cette clameur n'a lieu que chez eux. Rollon, ou Robert, fut pere de Richard I, dit le Vieil, et surnomme Sans Peur, qui laissa Richard II, dit lâIntrepide. Celui-ci eut pour successeur Robert II qui de Herleve, femme d'un gentilhomme ou, selon d'autres, d'un pelletier de Falaise, eut Guillaume, dit le Batard, puis le Conquerant, parce qu'il conquit l'Angleterre; il morut l'an 1087.âMORERI. 2. This name, Anschitel, signifies son, according to Blomefield, who, in his history of Norfolk, speaking of Middle Henling, says: âIt was held by Ulchetell, a Dane in the Confessor's days, and by Anschitell, his descendant, or son, as the name intimates.â\n\nSIR JOHN GREY, K. G. 1350.\n\n29. 4. Camden gives the name simply John Grey; Carte calls him John, Lord Gray, of Codenore; but Ashmole has it Sir John Grey, according to the following list. He says:âKing Edward III. having instituted said order, and set down rules and statutes for the government and regulation thereof, he next resolved to elect, from the flower of his own chevalry, twenty-five noble and valiant knights, who, together with himself, should make up the number of 26, (for of so many doth the order by his appointment consist); and, indeed, that age furnished him with every choice of gallant men made famous by martial exploits performed in the battles of Sluce, Crescy, and Durham. The first that he elected into this noble order was Edward, his eldest son, who had already in part deserved, and afterwards obtained the title of a valiant and renowned prince; and the rest of those accomplished colleagues were these that follow, and thus placed in their stalls:â ON THE SOVEREIGN'S SIDE. ON THE PRINCE'S SIDE. 2. Henry, Duke of Lancaster. 2. Thomas, Earl of Warwick. 3. Piers, Capitow de la Bouch. 3. Ralph, Earl of Stafford. 4. William, Earl of Salisbury. 4. Roger, Earl of March. 5. Sir John Lisle. 5. Sir Bartholomew Burghersh. 6. Sir John Beauchamp. 6. Sir John Mohun. 7. Sir Hugh Courtney. 7. Sir Thomas Holland. 8. Sir John Grey. 8. Sir Richard Fitzsimon. 9. Sir Miles Stapleton. 9. Sir Thomas Wale. 10. Sir Hugh Wrottesley. 10. Sir Nele Loring. 11. Sir John Chandos. 11. Sir James Audeley. 12. Sir Otes Holland. 12. Sir Henry Earn. 13. Sir Sanchet Dabrichcourt. 13. Sir Walter Paveley. Of the aforesaid Sir John Grey, Ashmole gives the following account:â\" He was eldest son of Richard, Lord Grey, of Codenore, in Derbyshire (by Jane his wife) who had been Seneschal of Gascoigne in the reign of King Edward the Second. In that notable and famous expedition made into Scotland, ananno 7 Edward III., he had command, when his valour was so far taken notice of, that not long after, the King in part of recompence thereof, and of his great expenses in those wars, acquitted him of all such debts as he then owed unto his exchequer. Towards the end of the 9th year of Edward III., he went again to the wars of Scotland, (being of the retinue of Hugh Audley), and two years after, in another expedition then made thither, anno 12 Edward III., he attended the King into Flanders, and, Anno 14 Edward III., went over thither, when by the way that famous naval fight happened near Sluce; the following year he undertook employment in the Scottish wars. Anno 18 Edward III., he, with Nicholas de Langford, and Edward de Chandos, were assigned to array all able men in Derbyshire, from 16 to 60 years of age, and to have them in readiness to march with them, or others whom the King should appoint, within three day's warning, against the Scots, then ready to invade this kingdom. The following year he went in the retinue of Henry, Earl of Derby, into Gascoigne; and in regard he stayed there the next year in the King's service, his lands in Kent were exempted from finding men\n\n30. for guarding the sea-coasts. With this earl he returned to England, and went to Calais in his retinue, Anno, 21 Edward III, and stayed there the following year. There being an invasion threatened by the French, Anno, 26 Edward III., he was joined in commission with the Lord Deyncourt to array all able persons in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and to conduct them to such places as might stand in need of them for defence of the realm. He went in the expedition which the aforesaid earl made into Bretagne, Anno 29 Edward III. ; and after attended the king on his voyage royal into France, Anno 33 Edward HI, and the same year was constituted governor of the town and castle of Rochester for life. More of his military services we find not before he obtained the King's license, Anno 39 Edward III, to go on pilgrimage ; and, Anno 45 Edward III, being grown very aged, and not able to endure travel, he obtained a special dispensation (wherein his many and great services performed with much fidelity and valour are by the King acknowledged), to exempt him coming to Parliaments, (to which he had received summons from the time of his father's death, which happened anno 1336), and councils, and charging him with setting forth of soldiers in the wars for the future. He married Alice de Insula, by whom he had Henry his eldest son, who married Joane, daughter of Reginald Cobham, of Sterborough, but died before his father, and John his second son, who both went in the retinue of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, in his expedition into France, anno 43 Edward III, and Alice a daughter, wife of William, son of Sir Adam de Everingham, of Laxton, in the County of Nottingham.\" The services of this nobleman were so highly esteemed by the king, that he received from the hands of the monarch himself a hood of white cloth, embroidered with blue men dancing, buttoned before with great pearls ; and being to perform divers military exercises in a tournament at Canterbury, had certain accoutrements of Indian silk, whereon the arms of Sir Stephen Cosyngton, Knight, were painted, bestowed on him by the king. He died about the year 1392, and was succeeded by his grandson Richard Lord Grey, who was also a Knjght of the Garter. His arms areâBarry of six, ar. and az. The first of the Greys of Northumberland who had conferred on him this honour (that of K.G.) was Sir John Grey, Earl of Tankerville, elected in the reign of Henry V. His arms are:âGu. a lion rampant, within a border engrailed, ar. 5. This conspiracy happened at Southampton, whither Henry had come to embark his army, which was now ready to sail for France. Of this event the following account is given by Monstrelet:â Item ledit Roy d'Angleterre venu au port de Hautonne auec tout son exercite, prest pour passer la mer et venir descendre enFrace, fut aduerty, qu'aucuns grans seigneurs de son hostel si auoient fait cospiration a l'encontre de luy, vueillans remettre le Comte de la Marche vray successeur et inheritier de feu le Roy Richard en possession du royaume d'Angleterre, ce qui estoit veritable: car le Comte de Cantorbrye [Cambridge] et autres, auoient conclud de prendre le dessusdit Roy et ses freres, sur intention d'accomplir les besongnes dessusdictes: si s'en descouurirent au Comte de la Marche\n\n31. lequel reuela au Roy Henry, en lui disant, qu'il aduisast a son fait, ou il seroit trahy, lui nomma lesdits conspirateurs: lesquels le dessusdit Roy fait tantost prendre, et brief ensuiuat, fait tracher les testes a trois des principaux: c'est a ssauoir au Cote de Cator-brie, frere au Due dTorch [York], au seigneur Seruppe [Scrope] lequel couchoit toutes les nuicts auec le Roy, et au Seigneur de Grez [the chevalier Grey], et depuis en furet aucuns executez. Monstrelet gives a copy of the letter written by Henry V., and sent by one of his heralds to the King of France, of which the following is a translation:â\" To the very noble Prince Charles, our cousin and adversary of France. Henry, by the Grace of God, King of England and France. To give to every one what is their due is a work of inspiration and wise counsel, very noble Prince, our cousin and adversary. The noble kingdoms of England and France were formerly united, now they are divided. At that time it was customary for each person to exalt his name by glorious victories, and by this single virtue to extol the honour of God, to whom holiness belongs, and to give peace to his Church by subjecting in battle the enemies of the public weal. But, alas! good faith among kindred and brotherly love have been perverted; and Lot dersecutes Abraham by human impulsion; and Dissension, the mother of Anger, has been raised from the dead. \" We, however, appeal to the sovereign Judge (who is neither swayed by prayers nor gifts from doing right), that we have from pure affection done everything in our power to preserve the peace; and we must now rely on the sword for regaining what is justly our heritage, and those rights which have from old time belonged to us; and we feel such assurance in our courage that we will fight till death in the cause of justice. The written law in the book of Deuteronomy ordains, that before any person commences an attack on a city, he shall first offer terms of peace ; and although violence has detained from us our rightful inheritance, charity, however, induces us to attempt by fair means their recovery, for should justice be denied us, we may then resort to arms. And to avoid having our conscience affected by this matter, we make our personal request to you, by the bowels of Jesus Christ, to follow the dictates of his evangelical doctrine. Friend, restore what thou owest, for such is the will of God, to prevent the effusion of the blood of man who was created in his likeness. Such restitution of rights cruelly torn from us, and which we have so frequently demanded by our Ambassadors, will be agreeable to the supreme God, and secure peace on earth. \"From our love of peace we were inclined to refuse fifty thousand golden crowns lately offered us; for being more desirous of peace than riches, we have preferred enjoying the patrimony left us by our venerable ancestors with our very dear cousin Catherine, your illustrious daughter, to iniquitously multiplying our treasures, and thus disgracing the honour of our crown, which God forbid ! \" Given under our Privy Seal, in our Castle of Southampton, the 5th day of the month of August, in the year of Our Lord, 1415.\" The above letter having been presented to the King of France by the herald, (Antilope, pursuivant at arms) he was told that the king and council would examine it and deliberate on its contents, and that the king would provide accordingly in such\n\n32. time and place as should seem good to him; and that he might return to his lord, the King of England, when he pleased. Monstrelet, in his account of the battle of Azincourt, makes mention of the Lord de Croy, of Picardy, and his son Sir John de Croy, as among those on the side of France, who were slain on that fatal day. Of the same family no doubt are the Greys, De Greys, and Grays of England and Scotland. 6. About this time the Greys were in possession of Wallington. It belonged, in 1326 and 1365, to John de Grey, who took the local name of de Wallington, and had a son \"Robert de Wallington,\" whose only daughter and heir, Johanna, married William le Strother, on whose death it came with its dependencies to John de Fenwick, of Fenwick Tower, who married his youngest daughter and coheir, Mary, in the reign of Henry IV. John Grey de Walyngton is witness to a deed respecting Bywell, and dated at York, in 1318 (MS. Mat. L. 163). John de Walyngton and Elena his wife recovered 20 marks from Robert de Fenwick in 1343, and was a witness to deeds in 1342 and 1349 (III. ii. 16, 17). John, son of John de Walyngton, gave 10 marks, 34 Edward III., for forfeited lands in Greenleighton and Middleton Morel (Abb. Rot. Orig. ii. 261, Cal. Rot. Pat, 171); and Robert de Walyngton, next of kin and heir of John de Walyngton, quiet-claimed to John de Fenwick, Esq., all his right in the manor of Camboe in 1393. Thomas Grey occurs as a witness to Wallington deeds in 1358 and 1393 (P. 6, 7). Emmotta Grey and her son, John de Herle, burgess of Newcastle, 16th May, 1393, released to John del Strother all arrearages due from Wallington and Heugh. The Greys, indeed, have been located, or held lands, more or less all over the county of Northumberland, at different places; to wit: Heton, Horton, Chillingham, Werke, Howick, Norham, Holy Island, Falloden, Ancroft, Kelloe, Rosse, Elwick, Goswick, Cornhill, Beale, Lowlyn, Bradford, Buckton, Twisell, Fenwick (N. D.), Milfield, Morwick, Nesbit, Doddington, Chiswick, North and South Middleton, Duddo, Tweedmouth, Murton, Heddon, Brunton, Alnwick, Wallington, Stanton, Stannington, Nunny Kirk, Angerton, Longhorsley, Morpeth Castle, Newminster Abbey, Broom Hill, Beechfield, Chevington^ West Ord, Budle, &c, &c. 7. The judgment 'pronounced against Sir Ralph Graye, of Warke, for treason in the fourthe year of King Edward the Fourth. The Earle of Worchester, Constable of England, sate in judgement, who remem-bring him saying, Sir Ralphe Graye thou hast taken order of knighthood of the Bathe, and anie taking that order ought to keep his faith which he maketh therefore, therefore, remember thee the lawe will that thou shallt proceed to Judgement, these matters shew so evidentlie against thee, that there needeth no further examination, certaine persones of the king's true subjects thou hast lefte wounded, as it seemeth here thou canst not denie this, thou hast drawen them with force of Armes unto the kings our dread Souveraignes Mortell enemies, and ranged thee in battaile against thy oath and faith which thou madest with thy owne voluntarie will against the Matie. of our most naturall Souveraigne, the which thou wotest well, gave unto thee such trust, and in such wise ministred his grace unto thee that thou haddest the keeping of his castels in the North partes.\n\nLADY JANE GREY\n\nAn earthly for a heavenly crown, thou freely didst resign.\n\nSweet flower of Paradise! thy scent, perfumes this book of mine.\n\nReader! as on thou lookest here,\n\nEmbalm her memory with a tear.\n\nHENRY GREY O.V.P. 1545\n\nFATHER OF CHARLES GREY OF KENT.\n\n33.

Item, Sir Ralphe Graye, the king had ordeined here thou maiest see the King of Armes and Harouldes, and thy owne proper Coates of Armes, which he should teare of thy backe and bodie, and so thou shouldest be disgraded of thy worshipp, Noblenes, and armes, as of the order of knighthood, also here is another coate of thy armes reversed, which thou shouldest have worne on thy bodie going to that death ward for that belongeth to thee after the lawe, notwithstanding the degradinge of knighthood, of the Noblenes, and of the armes, the king pardoneth that for thy Nobell Grandfather, who suffered trouble for the king's most Noble Predecessours. Now Sir Ralphe Graye this shalbe thy penaunce, thou shallt goe on thy feete to the Townes ende, and there thou shallt be laid uppon a hurdle, and drawen to a scaffold made for thee, and thou shallt have thy head smiten of from thy bodie, and it to be buried in the friers, thy head where the king's pleasure shall be.âCopied from GUTHRIE'S MSS. 8.

In that era of plots and political intrigues, comprised in the reigns of the later Stuarts, Forde, Lord Grey, afterwards Earl of Tankerville, was a very busy and adventurous personage. He took part in the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, and commanded the horse at the battle of Sedgmoor, where he is accused of having treacherously deserted his post, and of flying at the first charge ; relative to which\n\n34. historians have been divided as to whether it was the result of treachery or cowardice. The strict entail in which his estates were bound, aided by his skill in administering effectual presents, is supposed to have saved his life ; after his estates in anticipation had been already given (though they proved beyond reach) to the Earl of Rochester. This memorable passage in his history eclipsed the fame of his previous concern in the celebrated Rye House Plot; but a memoir he had himself written of that affair having been preserved in manuscript until 1754, was then printed and published. When on his way to the Tower on that occasion, he appears to have {made his escape in a very extraordinary manner, to which he only briefly alludes in the memoir, but what he has omitted, Badesley, in his \"Genealogia Diversa, &c.\" (one of the Harl. MSS.), has supplied as follows: \" June 27th, 1683. \" This morning, about 7 of ye clock in the morning, the Lord Grey being brought to the Tower in a coach by Sarjt. Deerham ; the coach stopping at the Bulworke Gate, my Ld. found the Sargt. asleepe, who not wakeing upon my Lord's jogging of him, the coachman knowing nothing of the matter, suffer'd my Lorde to come out of the coach, and walked away, leaving the Sarjt. sleeping, and one or two of owne servts. standing by the coach side; he tooke water at Sab-staires, neare the Custom House, and landed at a place called Pickled-herring on the other side; but, before they landed him, they were followed by a soldier in a boate, who called out to them to stopp a Traytr to the King and country, upon which they stopped till the soldier came up to them; but immediately he said, it is not the man, and after whispering a littel, they went away together. The soldier's name is Robt. Clinton, of Capt. Delavalâs company. The waterman that tooke him up is named Thos. Heed, and is in custody upon the guard at ye Tower.\" Lord Grey, when he made his escape, was on his way to the Tower, after having been examined before the King and council. His own remark on the subject is this : \" The escape I made none can imagine I foresaw, unless they will suppose I had the spirit of divination, or had agreed with the messenger for it, which I protest to God I had not, nor ever proposed it to him.\" He got clear off to Holland. On the accession of William III, Lord Grey was restored to his former honours, and afterwards created by patent, dated 11th May, 1695, Viscount Glendale and Earl of Tankerville. In 1699 he was made a Lord of the Treasury, and in the same year, on the death of the Viscount Lansdowne, he became Lord Privy Seal. He died in 1701, and was buried at South Harting, in Sussex, where his coffin was seen by the late Sir William Burrell, bearing the following inscription: \"N, \" The body of the Right Honble Lord Grey, Earl of Tankerville, Viscount Glendale, Baron Grey, of Werke, and Baronet, Lord Privy Seal, and one of the Lords of his Majesty's most Honble Pnvy Council, who died the 24th of June, 1701, in the 47th year of his age.\" Arms : quarterly, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed, and three lions rampant, under a coronet, similar to that now assigned to a Marquis. The same arms, with a baron's coronet, were on his brother's coffin-plate with this inscription :\n\n35. \"The Right Honble Ralph Lord Grey, Baron of Werke, died the 20th of June, 1706, aged 45 years.\" The following is the character of this intriguing statesman, published in \" The Complete History of Europe,\" for the year of his death:â \"He was, to do him justice, a person of excellent parts, and delivered himself to admiration, and appeared zealous for the interests of his country, as well as of reformed manners of late years; as to his own particular, though I wish I could say the vices of his youth were inferior to the virtues of his more advanced years, which last were never able to obliterate the remembrance, I was going to say resentment, wrought by the other in his injured lady, in the person of so near a relation, though they kept a civil correspondence to his dying day.* As for his expedition with the Duke of Monmouth in the West, it will be the hardest task imaginable to convince the generality of people that he was not the betrayer of that unfortunate man; though, for my own part, I believe him innocent in that matter, and that it was his estate that saved him, but the instrument and manner of it is not for me at present to name. However this were, we are so far from having any tolerable instance of my Lord's courage at Sedgmoor fight, that the fate of the brave duke may more justly be attributed to the want of that than the other, and will ever remain as some reflection on his memory as long as the remembrance of that action shall endure.\" Sir Walter Scott, in his edition of Dryden's Works, has the following note on \" Absalom and Achitophel,\" Cold Caleb, p. 234. Forde, Lord Grey of Wark, described among Absalom's IX. worthies as, Chaste Caleb next, whose chill embraces charm s Women to ice, was yet in treason warm, Of the ancient race of Jewish nobles come, Whose title never lay in Christendom. He appears to have been a man of very great indifference to his domestic concerns, as the Duke of Monmouth, under whose banners he enlisted himself, was generally believed to have an intrigue with Lady Grey. In an account of a mock apparition which that lady is supposed to witness, she is made to state, \" That on Saturday, the 29th of January, 1680, being alone in her closet about nine o'clock at night, she heard a voice behind her, which mildly said, Sweetheart. At which she was at first not at all frightened, supposing it to be an apparition, which she says has often of late appeared to her, in the absence of her lord, in the shape of a bright star and blue garter, but without hurting or so much as frightening her.\" Lord Grey, ignorant or indifferent about these scandalous reports, went step for step with Monmouth in all his projects. He was a man of a restless temper and lively talents, which he exercised in the service of the popular party. He was deep in the Rye House Plot, and probably engaged in the very worst part of it; at least Lord * This is in allusion to his reputed intrigues with his sister-in-law, Lady Henrietta Berkeley, for which he was tried at the King's Bench, 23rd NOV., 1682.\n\n36. Howard deposed that Grey way full of expectation of some great thing to be attempted on the day of the king's coming from Newmarket, which was that fixed by the inferior conspirators for his assassination. Upon the trial of Lord Russell, Howard was yet more particular, and said, that upon a dark intimation of an attempt on the King's person, the Duke of Monmouth, \" with great emotion struck his breast, and cried out, God so ! kill the king! I will never suffer them? That Lord Grey, with an oath, also observed upon it, \" that if they made such an attempt, they could not fail.\" Ramsay charged Lord Grey with arguing with Ferguson on the project of rising at Taunton. Grey, on the first discovery of this conspiracy, was arrested, but finding the ofiicers drunk, he escaped in a boat, and fled into Holland. He was afterwards very active in pushing on Monmouth to his desperate expedition in 1685. He landed with the duke at Lyme, and held the rank of general of horse in his army. Like many other politicians, his lordship proved totally devoid of that courage in executing bold plans, which he displayed in forming or abetting them. At the first skirmish at Bridport he ran away, although the troops he commanded did not follow his example, but actually gained a victory, while he returned on the gallop to announce a total defeat. Monmouth, much shocked, asked Colonel Matthews what he should do with him ? who answered, he believed there was not another general in Europe would have asked such a question. Lord Grey, however, fatally for Monmouth, continued in his trust, and commanded the horse at the battle of Sedgmoor. There he behaved like a poltroon as formerly, fled with the whole cavalry, and left the foot, who behaved most gallantly, to be cut to pieces by the horse of King James, who, without amusing themselves with pursuit, wheeled and fell upon the rear of the hardy western peasants. So infamous was Grey's conduct, that many writers at the time, thinking mere cowardice insufficient to account for it, have surmised, some that he was employed by the king to decoy Monmouth to his destruction, and others, that jealousy of the domestic injury he had received from the duke induced him to betray the army.* This caitiff peer was taken in the disguise of a shepherd, near Holt Lodge, in Dorsetshire, and confessed that, \" since his landing in England, he had never enjoyed a quiet meal, or a night's repose.\" He was conveyed to London, and would probably have been executed, had it not been discovered that his estate, which had been given to Lord Rochester, was so strictly entailed that nothing could be got by his death. He, therefore, by the liberal distribution, it is said, of large sums of money, received a pardon from the king, and appeared as a witness on the trial of Lord Delamere; and was ready to do so on that of Hampden; yet he is supposed to have kept some secrets with respect to the politics of the Prince of Orange, in reward of which, he was raised to the rank of an earl after the revolution.+ * Next, Monmouth came in with an army of fools, Betray'd by his cuckold and other dull tools, Who painted the turf of green Sedgemoor with gules. + Whatever difference of opinion others may have entertained of this heterogeneal fungus on the Grey stock, the late Earl Grey (who happily inherited not a drop of his degenerate blood)\n\n37. 10. There is, in the county of Durham, a curious tradition of the son and heir of this Charles Bennet, the particulars of which, as related in a recent memoir of the Allan family, are as follows :âIn the early part of the last century, Edward Colville, who had realised a handsome fortune as a wholesale butcher and extensive grazier, resided in a mansion called the White House, which may still be seen in the vicinity of Gateshead. The respectability of his character and the style in which he lived were such as to admit of his daughter, Camilla, attending the assize balls in Newcastle-on-Tyne; and gifted by nature with an elegant person, and with the advantages of education, she was a young lady eminently qualified to grace those scenes of gaiety and fashion; at one of which she had the good fortune to attract the attention of a young nobleman, Lord Ossulston, heir apparent of the house to Tankerville. Camilla was the envied object of her less favoured rivals, when this nobleman, after the proper formalities, solicited the honour of walking a minuet with her. She blushingly consented, and rarely had the company present witnessed a more striking display than that which this elegant couple, in their evolutions of graceful movement, exhibited. Lord Ossulston was charmed above measure by the beauty of his partner, and the next day beheld the future lord of Chillingham, at an hour which would now be thought preposterously early, calling at the White House to pay his respects to its fair tenant. Next day, and the next again, he renewed his visits; and the young lady's father, from being simply flattered, began to fear that a sentiment of love might arise in their unwary hearts, and engender hopes that would end only in disappointment. Perhaps he had even graver fears, which any one acquainted with the maxims of the parents of that age will not deem to have been at all unreasonable, when the fact is known that Camilla's sweet teens of youth and innocence had four more years to run. He, therefore, made some efforts to prevent all intercourse between Lord Ossulston and his daughter; but, denied admittance to the house, the ardent lover still could beset her when she went abroad, seat himself near her at church, and get insinuated into any little social party where she was expected. Mr. Colville at length saw it to be necessary to take very decided measures, and he resolved to place the young lady for some time in a new and distant home, where her sister, who was eight years older, might be a proper guardian. Mr. Lionel Allan, his son-in-law, had settled as a merchant in Holland, and he had also a friend who conducted a vessel of his own regularly between South Shields and the ports of Holland and the north of France. It may here be remarked that the shipowners, who in those days navigated their own vessels from the Tyne, were a highly respectable class of men, generally possessing good education and manners, and living, when at home, in a style of considerable dignity. Amongst the descendants of some of them might be found members of both Houses of Parliament. They took the name of Captain, and had some valid pretensions for doing so, as trading beyond certain latitudes and longitudes, specified by Queen Elizabeth, gave masters of merchant\n\nwould hear nothing in his favour ; but, when talking about him with a friend of mine, characterized him with indignant emphasis, \"a great rascal.\" Certainly between the two men there was no imaginable point of resemblance; they were as unlike as Satyr to Hyperion.âE. H.\n\n38. vessels a modified permission to assume that title. Captain Aubane (of the family of Aubane, of Great Yarmouth, not Aubone of Newcastle) readily entered into the views of his friend Colville, and undertook the expatriation of the young lady. She was accordingly conducted, in the most private manner to South Shields, and put on board his vessel; for if, as is likely, she regarded her lover with affection, and deemed her deportation a compulsory exile, the authority of parents in those days was too stern and inflexible to admit of anything like effectual remonstrance on her part. The ship arrived at Rotterdam in safety, having on board Camilla, who was duly consigned to the care of her brother-in-law, Mr. Lionel Allan. If Mr. Colville, however, believed that Lord Ossulston had been \" thrown out,\" he was mistaken, for, after the lapse only of a few weeks, his Lordship made his appearance in Rotterdam, and became as troublesome to Mr. Allan's family, who had charge of his mistress, as he had formerly been to her father. The Linden Walks lent their shade to meetings of the lovers; and, when such were denied, his Lordship made signals from the street, which Camilla could furtively read in the friendly mirror projecting from the parlour window. Mr. Allan now became more distressingly alarmed than even the father had been, and resolved to get quit of his onerous charge. Captain Aubane ere long returned to Rotterdam for another cargo, and Camilla was once more put on board. The Dutch coast had been for a day lost in the blue distance, and honest Aubane was congratulating himself on the prospect of soon committing Miss Colville in safety to her father's keeping, when, descending into the cabin, how was he astonished to behold, kneeling at her feet, that very Lord Ossulston whom he supposed to have been left lamenting on the quay of Rotterdam! He soon learnt that the lover had contrived, by the connivance of a sailor, and doubtless with the concurrence of his mistress, to secrete himself in a cask on board the vessel shortly before it sailed. It was too late to think of returning to port to put the intruder ashore; but Captain Aubane commanded him to withdraw from the cabin, and not to appear there again, unless in his company and by his express permission. He also stipulated that, while he himself was on deck on duty, Lord Ossulston should, both day and night, be at all times under his immediate surveillance. The lover found himself compelled to submit to all these restrictions; but the privilege of seeing his mistress once a day, even in the presence of a third party, served in no small degree to reconcile him to their strictness. In the course of the voyage, which was not a short one, the heir of Tankerville made a more favourable impression on the mind of Aubane, who became convinced that, however frivolous or otherwise objectionable might have been the feelings with which he at first had regarded Camilla, he was now actuated by an honourable motive. He was also induced to believe the young man when he protested, in the most earnest manner, that his future felicity depended on his obtaining her who alone could make him happy. The South Shields shipowner did not, indeed, like the idea of encouraging a young nobleman in a design which must be regarded with dislike by his father and other relatives; but, on this point also, his scruples were at length overcome, doubtless by persuasions strictly honourable. On arriving at South Shields, he allowed Lord Ossulston to become an inmate of his house,, in company with Camilla, until the consent of her father was\n\n39. obtained, and the necessary preparations were made for their nuptials. The union of the happy pair took place at Jarrow Church, the ancient seat of the Venerable Bede, a sacred edifice which, from some local prepossession, has been for ages the resort of young couples desirous of absolving their mutual vows, by joining their hearts and hands without the consent of parents. After their marriage they resided for some years at White House with the lady's father. At length the death of his father occurred, and placing on his head the coronet of nobility, made him a peer of the realm; and Camilla Colville, as Countess of Tankerville, became entitled to the chief seat in the splendid halls of Chillingham Castle. Our heroine was afterwards one of the ladies of the bedchamber to Queen Caroline, consort of George the Second. She played her part as a peeress with a due portion of dignity and spirit, and continued, long after being the mother of three children (one of whom, George, was godson to his namesake the king) to be one of the most beautiful women at the English court. She survived her husband in a long dowagerhood, and died in 1775, not indeed at the age of 105, as has been repeatedly stated in grave works of authority, but of 77. Her father, however, reached the former age; and her sister, Susanna Allan, outlived her whole generation, her husband, ten brothers and sisters, and ten children, dying at the age of 92. 11. The letter in which the noble lords declined the offer of power and place, is too honourable to them to be omitted: \" Camelford House, 3 June, 1812. \" My Lord, \"We have considered, with the most serious attention, the minute which we have had the honour to receive from your Lordship, and we have communicated it to such of our friends as we have had the opportunity of consulting. \" On the occasion of a proposal made to us under the authority of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, we wish to renew, in the most solemn manner, the declaration of our unfeigned desire to have facilitated, as far as was in our power, the means of giving effect to the late vote of the House of Commons, and of averting the imminent and unparalleled dangers of the country. No sense of the public distress and difficulty, no personal feelings of whatever description would have prevented us, under such circumstances, from accepting with dutiful submission, any situations in which we could have hoped to serve His Royal Highness usefully and honourably; but it appears to us, on the most dispassionate reflection, that the proposal stated by your Lordship cannot justify any such expectation. We are invited, not to discuss with your Lordship, or with any other public men according to the usual practice in such cases the various and important considerations, both of measures and of arrangements, which belong to the formation of a new government in all its branches, but to recommend to His Royal Highness a number, limited by previous stipulation, of persons willing to be included in a cabinet, of which the outlines are already definitely arranged. To this proposal we could not accede without the sacrifice of the very object which the House of Commons has recommendedâthe formation of a strong and efficient administration. We enter not into the examination of the relative pro-portions, or of the particular arrangements which it has been judged necessary thus\n\n40. previously to establish ; it is to the principle of disunion and jealousy that we object to the supposed balance of contending interests in a cabinet so measured out by preliminary stipulation. The times imperiously require an administration united in principle, and strong in mutual reliance, possessing also the confidence of the Crown, and assured of its support in those healing measures which the public safety requires, and which are necessary to secure to the government the good opinion and affections of the people. \" No such hope is presented to us by this project, which appears to us equally new in practice and objectionable in principle; it tends, as we think, to establish within the cabinet itself a system of counteraction, inconsistent with the prosecution of any uniform and beneficial course of policy. We must, therefore, request permission to decline all participation in a government constituted on such principles; satisfied, as we are, that the certain loss of character which must arise from it to ourselves, could be productive only of disunion and weakness in the administration of the public interests. We have the honour to be, with respect, &c, \"GREY, \" The Most Hon. the Marquis Wellesley.\" \" GRENVILLE. -\n\nFamilies that have in them the blood of the Greys, being descended from Sir Thomas Grey, of Heton, Northumberland:â DUKES.
