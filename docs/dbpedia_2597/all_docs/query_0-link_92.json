Hugh Gallagher and Co. were declared contractors for Indian meal at £7 per ton. Their tender was not the lowest, but their sample of meal being better, and their liberal offer not to press for payment until the finances of the Union were in better position, secured for them the contract. They also were declared contractors for barley meal at £6 15s. per ton, and for whole meal at £10 p. ton.\n\nMessrs. W.O. McCormick & Co. get the contract for American flour at £1 5s. 6d. per barrel.\n\nMr. Sweeney's tender for oatmeal was accepted at £9 7s. 6d. per ton and Mr. George S.

BOURKE, Steward.\n\nVAGRANTS\n\nThere was a desultory conversation among the Guardians, on Saturday, at their meeting, as to the best mode of freeing the town from the number of vagrants with which it is now infested, but no definite resolution was adopted. We trust they will, on the next Board day, take it more earnestly into consideration and carry out the provisions of the Act with rigour and determination, so that the numbers who are daily pouring into the town may seek a livelihood and a home elsewhere than in the streets and purlieus of Ballina.\n\nPOOR RATES - OPINION OF COUNSEL.\n\n1st quere - Is a landlord liable to be successfully sued by a civil bill or otherwise for a rate struck during the time his tenant was in occupation of his land, but which lands the tenant thereafter asserted his right of entry and took possession, by leaving a caretaker in charge of the lands; but did not otherwise occupy them, or did he use them for any purpose or derive any profit from them, his caretaker merely superintending the lands till they could be set?\n\n2d quere - The above lands having remained unset under the above circumstances, another rate is struck and the landlord is, for such new rate, rated by name. Can payment of such last mentioned rate be legally enforced from him?\n\nIn reply to the first quere, I am of opinion that a landlord cannot, under the circumstances stated, be successfully sued by civil bill or otherwise.\n\nIn reply to the 2d quere, I am also of opinion that payment of rate, under the circumstances mentioned, cannot be enforced from a landlord because, amongst other reasons, the whole poor law code, in this country, as well as in England, requires that each occupier, to be rated, or to be liable to pay rates, must beneficially occupy. See Ren v. Welbank, 4 Maule and Selwin, 229. Ren v. Suelcoates, 12 East, p. 80, because the 61st, 71st, 79d and 78th sections of the 1st and 2nd Victoria, chap. 56, make a clear distinction between an owner, lessor, or landlord, and an occupier or tenant, which distinction cannot be demolished by the tortuous act of abandonment of his farm by the tenant, or by the legitimate exercise of his right of ownership or title by the landlord, by a lawful entry on the deserted premises; because the words in the 71st section, \"by the person subsequently in occupation,\" it is further clearly explained by the latter part of the 78th section to mean, the beneficial occupation of a subsequent actual tenant.\n\nAs to my opinion on the second quere, I am fully supported by authority of the cases of the King v. Dwyer and Hall, p. 600 and the King v. Morgan and Dayrrel, Justices of Buckinghamshire, 3 Ad. and El. p. 648.\n\nPIERSE CREAGH, 52, Great Charles st.\n\nBIRTHS\n\nAt Rahassane Park, County Galway, the Lady of T.A. Joyce, Esq., of a son.\n\nAt Fitzwilliam-square, the wife of Alexander C. Lambert, Esq., of a daughter.\n\nAt Ennisworthy, the Lady of Wm. Freeman, Esq., Manager of the Provinical Bank, of a son.\n\nAt Devonshire-place, Mrs. F. Mahon, of a daughter.\n\nOn the 31st ult., at Glinville Glin, the Lady of Major G. FitzGerald O'Connor, of a son.\n\nAt Enniskean Cottage, the Lady of the Rev. Wm. Sherrard, of a son.\n\nThe Lady of C. Blake, Esq., Thornhill, Tuam, of a son.\n\nAt Dunfanaghy, county Donegal, the wife of Wm. Maridith, Esq., Sub-Inspector of Constabulary, of a son.\n\nMARRIAGES\n\nIn Carrickfergus, John W. Cox, Esq. Captain 13th Prince Albert's Light Infantry, eldest son of Sir William Cox, Coolcliffe, Co. Wexford, to Emma Jane, daughter of the late Capt. Griffin Royal Navy.\n\nJ. Morris, of Rathdown, Esq. to Charlotte Emily, daughter of the late J. Seymour, of Seapoint, Bray, Esq.\n\nThe Rev. John Hewson, B.A., Rector of Kilmore, Erris, son of Mr. Charles Hewson, of Sandymount, to Mary Meares Moran, daughter of the Very Rev. the Provost of Kilmacduagh.\n\nOUTRAGE AND ATTEMPT TO MURDER.- Thomas Studdert, Esq. of Danganelly house, was waylaid on his return from Kilrush on Wednesday evening by two men, one of whom secured his horse by the reins, while the other inflicted a severe wound on his head with a stone. John Dosty and Michael Honan have been committed for trial for this outrage. It is believed that the miscreants were hired by other parties to assassinate Mr. Studdert, as he has taken an active part in successfully checking abuses and exposing frauds in connexion with the administration of poor laws in his neighbourhood. -- Limerick Chronicle.\n\nPEERS' DEATHS - 1849\n\n1.

Browne, Sir Wm. O'Malley and Mr. Ouseley Higgins. The first is a Protectionist, and we learn that his canvass is progressing most favourably. Mr. Browne is a Whig, and is nearly connected with the Sligo family. This gentleman formerly represented the county in Parliament. During the late year he took an active part in the proceedings of the relief committee, and went to London to collect the means of alleviating the misery which then pervaded and unfortunately still exists, in the West of Ireland. Mr. Higgins is the nominee of Dr. M'Hale, and Sir William O'Malley also comes forward as a Whig, without any chance of being elected, but having just enough of support to divide the interest which might else achieve an easy victory over the Spiritual Dictator.\n\nMr. Higgins has sent out his address, which begins open-mouthed against the church, betraying thereby, the neat Roman hand which really penned it. On the other points he promises to vote for everything tending to disturb the foundations of property and order; but, in his private canvass, he is at pains to assure timorous electors that he does not wish \"to go as far as Dillon Browne.\" That is a pledge which any lover of his country will keep, as long as he can help himself. Further, indeed, than Dillon Browne, it would not be easy, for the most determined progressionist to go, unless his ambition aspired to the honour of keeping a light house at the South Pole, for our expatriated patriot is not to slacken sail till he finds himself a few miles lower down the world than Cape Horn. What his position is to be, when he gets there, seems doubtful. Some authorities dub him a Governor, others only a Surveyor-General; but the probability is that like Alexander Silkirk, he may lay claim to both, for lack of any Christian to dispute the sceptre:-\n\n\"I am Monarch of all I survey.\"\n\nA fifth candidate, in embryo, last year appeared in the burley person of Mr. MacDonnell, of Deo Castle. He does not actually throw his hat into the ring, which \"delicacy\" forbids him to do until the vacancy shall be declared; but he is in now way delineate in avowing his sentiments, which are for \"a cheap leaf\" It is well enough for gentlemen who have plenty of money, like Mr. M'Donnell to expatiate on the advantages of a cheap leaf. Aregath Shiess goes for now in the West, and, as Mr. Taper says, there is nothing like a good cry, we rede Mr. Higgins looks sharp to that of \"Big Joe and the big loaf.\"--Mail.\n\nCROSSMOLINA PETTY SESSIONS\n\nMagistrates present - Daniel J. Curice, Esq., R.M., Mervyn Pratt and W.

A decanter in which was some malt, and which was emptied, and some castor oil, were left under the archway of her house.\n\nIt appears that one of the pins that fastened the shutters was broken, and consequently, not sufficiently long to be checked inside; this, a person who happened to be in the shop late on that evening perceived; it is therefore probable that in that circumstance originated the robbery. The police are on the alert, and from their efficiency there is scarcely a doubt that the robbers will be detected.\n\nSCENERY AT BELFAST\n\nThe summit of the Cavehill commands a sweep of great extent on every side; and, on a summer afternoon, when the sun's rays sparkle on the distant waters of Lough Neagh, Lough Strangford and the Channel, yields one of the most superb views in our islands. The busy town beneath, with its river, covered with shops of many flags and every form, gradually widening into Belfast Lough, and the latter losing itself between the Copeland and the Maiden Islands in the Channel, with the Scottish hills in Galloway for a back ground to the east, or the same river, winding its course up the fertile valley to Lisburn, now lost for a long distance, to be again revealed between corn fields or through trees in a narrow line of silvery brightness, and its densely-peopled banks, away from the ocean to its source, studded with little towns and numerous villas, catching the eye amid its many cottages, sometimes clustered round a tall chimney or gathered together at the corners of bleaching fields, that seem, even in July, to have a covering of snow; or over the Castlereagh hills, on the South-east, to Lough Strangford, with its many islands chequering its wide-expanses of water, surrounded by many pleasant villages, so hidden and out of the way of the world as scarcely to be known; or the sharp and distant summits of the Mourne mountains, raised by their Maker like a barrier between the dark South and the black North; or the corner of wide Lough Neagh and the Bann river, carrying away its waters to the North, and the Derry Mountains closing on the scene to the West.\n\nCOURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH\n\nCriminal Information.\n\nThe Queen, at the prosecution of John Jardine, v. F.W. Conway, Esq., proprietor of the Evening Post.\n\nMr. Whiteside, Q.C., (with whom was Mr. Napier, Q.C.,) applied for a conditional order for a criminal information against Mr. Conway, for publishing certain documents and articles in the Evening Post newspaper, of which he was the registered proprietor. he moved on the affidavit of the applicant, who deposed at great length to the facts connected with the procession, &c., of Orangemen, which took place at Dolly's Brae, in the month of July last, and stated the he believed it was the intention of the government to prosecute him, at the next assizes for the county of Down for joining that procession , and that certain publications, which appeared in the Evening Post, viz., Mr. Berwick's report of the inquiry at Castlewellan, Mr. Redington's letter relative to the dismissal of Lord Roden and the Messrs. Beers, together with various leading articles, were calculated to prejudice him upon his trial, as the newspaper in question was extensively circulated in the north of Ireland.\n\nThe Court granted the conditional order.\n\nIRISH PEERAGES - We extract from the memoirs of the Right Hon. Henry Grattan, by his son, M.H. Grattan, M.P.: - \"The Lord Lieutenant did not wish to leave Ireland under the disgrace of the censure passed upon him. He accordingly waited till the ensuing year, and in the meantime applied himself to all the arts of corruption. It was generally stated the one of the Peerages was sold to Mr. Brown (afterwards Lord Kilmaine); another to Sir N. Lawless, (Lord Cloncurry); a third to Lord Limerick. They gave 3,000l. a piece for them.- This was laid out in a stock purse for the purchase of members in the lower House; and the circumstance was discovered by Mr. Brown quarrelling with Government, because they refused to return his son as one of the members.\n\nASSAULTS\n\nA few nights since William Massy, a blacksmith residing at Castleconnor, was proceeding home from the market of this town when he was accosted by a man who had his face concealed by the collar of his great coat and asked some questions relative to a plough iron the man had in his hand. After giving him some directions about the iron Massy was about proceeding on his way when the fellow struck him with the iron and inflicted a severe wound on his head and robbed him of some money he had in his waistcoat pocket. The perpetrator of this outrage has not yet been discovered.\n\nOn the same night of the above assaults a carman named Lundy from Aclare, was attacked by four men at the chapel of Bunniconlan, and received two cuts on the head and one one the lip. Lundy did not know any of the party by whom he was attacked, but suspects they were in the service of a neighbour in Aclare who owed him a grudge.\n\nOUTRAGE - On Monday night two houses at Clountha, in the parish of Kilgarvin, out of which John Cawly and Michael Kelly were ejected a few days previous, were set on fire and destroyed. A suspicion rests upon the former tenants as being the incendiaries.\n\nFIRE\n\nAn alarming fire broke out last night in a small stable belonging to Mr. James Dixon, at the rere of Bridge-street, through the carelessness, and we believe, intemperance of a servant. For a considerable time it raged with fury, having soon communicated itself to two other small thatched houses. Fortunately these houses were constructed only at one end with other buildings which were higher, so that the flames did not reach their roof, which was also of thatch, and the sparks, drifted by a slight breeze, fell on the slated house. Sub-Inspector Fox and all the men of the police parties stationed in the town and Ardnaree were quickly on the spot, together with a number of townspeople aroused by the cry of fire. Every exertion was used to keep down the flames and prevent their extending further. It was impossible to allay the alarm of the inmates of the surrounding houses, who went to much useless trouble in removing their furniture, which must have suffered much damage thereby.\n\nROBBERY AND NARROW ESCAPE OF THE THIEF. - On Thursday last a young man named Patrick Casey, stole £30 and some valuables from the house of his aunt, a Mrs. Ellen Commerford, who keeps a public house in Mooncoin. Two policemen immediately went in pursuit, and suspecting the rogue was bound for America, closely watched the packet on the quay at Waterford. Finding Casey did not go on board, the policeman determined on going to Dungannon in the steamer, for the purpose of intercepting him in case he should attempt getting to the vessel on the way. - When at Passage a boat put off, in which, as it approached, the Constables observed the intended emigrant, and were felicitating themselves on the certainty of effecting the arrest, but just as the boat came to the steamer's side, Casey observed some indication on board which did not augur auspiciously for the success of his emigration scheme, and he immediately ordered the boat to be put back in haste, and the constables to their horror, were compelled to look at the pray [sic] escaping from their fangs just as it came almost within their grasp.\n\nHORRIBLE MURDER NEAR BORRISOKANE. - At half-past seven o'clock on last Saturday morning, as William Ardill, steward over the property of Mr. Falkiner, of Mount Falkiner, near Borrisokane, was passing through his employer's property, a shot was fired at him; the slugs with which the gun was loaded took immediate effect. Mr. Ardill fell dead immediately, having been shot through the heart, his blood flowing in abundance from his wounds and making a large pool where he lay. He left a wife and seven children, and in all respects he was esteemed as honest to his master, civil and obliging to those about him, attentive to his family, and most exemplary in all the relations of life. A deep mystery envelopes this atrocious crime. No clue whatever to the perpetrator has been discovered. It is a startling fact, in connection with this crime, that about five or six years ago a cousin and namesake of Ardill - and employed, we believe by Mr. Falkiner also - was murdered in the same place, and under circumstances of equal mystery, as though some persons were arrested on suspicion and lodged in jail, no evidence was brought forward afterwards sufficient to put the parties on their trail. -- King's County Chronicle\n\nDEATH OF DR ELRINGTON\n\nIt is our painful task on this day to record the very unexpected death of the Rev. Charles Elrington, D.D., Regius Professor of Divinity, Trinity College, Dublin, and Rector of Armagh, in the Primate's Diocese.\n\nDoctor Elrington was a man of profound and extensive learning - a sound and orthodox divine- firm in his character; and in all the social relations of life amiable and highly respected. The Sabbath services of yesterday, in College Chapel, evinced in their melancholy solemnity the place he held in the esteem and affections of the members of that venerable seat of learning, of which he had many, many years, indeed, been a distinguished light and ornament. The chapel was hung in mourning draperies, and the funeral sermon was most effectively preached by Dr. Todd. His demise, which took place at his parochial residence, was sudden and is said to have been the consequence of an attack of gout in the stomach.\n\nBIRTHS\n\nAt Island, Wexford, the Lady of William Bolton, jun., Esq, of a son.\n\nThe Lady of Martin H.

Very early in life he settled in France, upon a considerable estate which he purchased at Galville, near Rouen; and there my eldest sisters were born. He was not long, however, in finding out that they did not order things much better in France than in Ireland; and that although nominally equal to his neighbors in religious estate, the church made invidious distinctions in the distributions of her honours among the faithful. My father, probably having previously experienced more substantial annoyances, was finally so nettled at the partiality shown by the cure, in administering the honour of the censer to a neighbouring seigneur, whim he though to have no right to be fumigated before himself, that he sold his estate and returned to Ireland, where he conformed to Protestantism, and became thereby qualified to hold a territorial stake in the country. So far the French priest's nationality was a fortunate matter for my father and his descendants. He found a good market for his chateau and lands, the ownership of which, fifteen years later, would in all probability have cost him his head; and he made a good investment of the proceeds to his native country. His first possession in Ireland was the estate and borough of Rathcormac, in the county Cork; but this he subsequently sold to the first Lord Riversdale, and bought the estates in Limerick, Kildare, and Dublin, which still remain in the family. To the active mind of my father, however, neither the duties nor the rights of landed property afforded sufficient occupation, and he accordingly entered, to a large extent to a large extent, and with considerable success, into the banking and woollen trades. He also became a member of the Irish House of Commons, was created a baronet in 1776, and removed to the House of Peers in 1789. This short sketch of may father's career, practical commentary upon the position of the Irish nation during the latter half of the last century. -- Lord Cloncurry's Personal Recollections.\n\nEMIGRATION TO THE CAPE- PORT NATAL\n\nRespectable families who are not eligible for the government grant, can have 100 acres or more on a lease of 10 years, at a yearly rental of 1s. per acre, with the option of purchasing their allotments at any time during their lease. This land is of the richest quality, fit for the plough, being clear, and with ordinary culture, capable of producing wheat, barley, oats, beans, peas, Indian corn, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, sugar, coffee, arrow root, figs, pineapples, grapes, oranges, and all European fruits and vegetables.\n\nOxen and milch cows may be purchased in fine condition, at £4 each in Natal. Sheep, from 4s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. according to the quality of the wool. Fowls 2s. per dozen. Indian corn is brought in by the natives in great abundance at 1s. per bushel and pigs thrive amazingly on this. The bay of Natal abounds with fish. The Mauritius is the market for exporting live stock, &c., where the fat cattle bring from £20 to £30 according to weight and quality.\n\nIn addition to numerous testimonials on the subject of the capabilities, climate, and soil of Natal- the following extract is from a letter received by the agent for this colony, Mr. Young, Sun Court, Cornhill:-\n\n\"Now with regard to Natal, the land, I may say, of my adoption, I cannot well say too much for it; it far exceeds my most sanguine anticipation, in the beauty of its scenery, the uninterrupted fertility of its soil and the salubrity of its climate; none of all these qualities can be too long dwelt upon, nor yet overdrawn. The surface of the country is generally undulating, in no place rising (excepting on the Drakenberg,) higher than 700 feet, and that in a few instances, and even in these, the hills are clothed to the very summit with the richest pasture you can imagine; the richness of it, indeed, is the only fault it has, as young cattle are apt to surfeit themselves on it at first; this fault, however, is soon corrected and is disappearing as the country becomes occupied. I have already travelled over a good deal of the soil in all directions, and in no one instance have I seen cause to change any opinion of the country. Of course some localities are more suitable for the cultivation of certain crops than others; for instance, as yet it is generally considered the vicinity of the sea or within parallel of 200 miles from it, it is most suitable for cotton, more especially, the finer staples of it. The native Natal Cottontree, as well as the American Upland, has been found to do well up the country. This new Colony has none of the great draw backs of the older colonies neither does it, in capability or internal resources, fall short of any of them. Natal is no in its infancy, and only requires to be better known, to induce many hundreds of our farmers, who have hard struggles at home, (in order to make both ends meet,) to come out. There are none of the frequent and periodical draughts here, with which both the old colony of the Cope, as well as all our Australian colonies are scourged.- During the summer and winter there is plenty of water for all purposes. Winter being the dry season here and also the best time for putting in root and pulse crops, it is found beneficial and necessary to irrigate the land, whilst the seed is germinating, for which there is at all times and abundant supply; and from this gently undulating character of the country it is an operation easily performed. Comparatively little advantage has, as yet, been taken of the natural capabilities of the soil; indeed I can scarcely say that any, unless we except the cultivators of cotton. All we are in want of here therefore, is labour and moderate capital; especially the farmer. Send us these and I am justified in predicting, that Natal, in a few short years, would become not only our most flourishing colony, but would also, on account of the suitableness of their soil and climate for the cultivation of cotton, become of immense importance to Britain; as in some measure, rendering her more independent of America, for that article. You have seen, of course, the reports already made on the Natal Cottons, by the Chambers of Commerce at Manchester and Liverpool, where were very favourable. After seeing a good deal of the country; I have at length fixed on a farm, about two hours ride from Pieter Maritzburg, lying upon the Umganie River, it is nearly 6,000 acres in extent, with much valuable wood on it, which can be floated down the Umganie to D'Urban, where there is always a ready sale for it at high prices. It now pays well to transport it thither by waggons, a distance 70 miles and sawn with a pit sawn. The place I have bought is very beautiful, and remarkably rich in pasture. It is situated at the conflex of the Umganie and Kaokloof rivers. The former forming its southern boundary down to the mouth of the Kaokloof, or as it is called in the Ordnance map, the Karhlons, from which point it runs direct to north. There is a pretty good house upon it, and a mill for grinding flour. I mean to commence operations immediately; we have good and pleasant neighbours around us. The Government upset price is 4s. per acre, a real good Government farm seldom fetches less in the neighbourhood that I speak of than 5s.\"\n\nLine of packets sailing on the 1st of each month from Gravesend. The rate of passage in the cabin is £39; intermediate is £15 15s.; steerage, £11.\n\nPOOR RATES RESCUE\n\nSome short time since Mr. Robert R. Savage, Collector, made a seizure of sheep for arrears of poor rates due on the lands of Dohoma, Erris, when he was followed by several persons armed with pikes and sticks. He succeeded in bringing the sheep to pound, but the mob increasing showed a determination to attack. Stones were thrown and several of the drivers stuck. The pound-keeper delayed opening the door, evidently with the intention to gain time for the mob. When the door of the pound was at length opened and some of the sheep driven in, one man who was armed with a large stick entered and endeavoured to force the sheep back, and struck fiercely at any who dared to interfere with him. At the same time there were several persons on the walls of the pound throwing stones at the men who were attempting to drive in the sheep. One of the drivers forced his way into the pound, when he was attacked by the man inside, and both then struck at each other. Mr. Savage, when he saw there was no other way of saving the lives of his assistants, directed them to escape in the best manner they could. They were pursued by the mob, which at this time had increased to several hundreds. Mr. Savage to save his life turned his horse on the pursuers, and thus checked them for the moment. The pursuit was renewed, and continued about six miles, when four of the drivers were overtaken exhausted on the mountains by six men who would, doubtless, have taken summary revenge were it not for the timely interference of two gentlemen. We believe this affair is in course of investigation, and is the only instance of any rescue being attempted since Mr. Savage's appointment.\n\nTHE ARMY\n\nThe Athlone Military District is to be abolished instead of the Kilkenny, and the following special service officers are to be reduced on the 21st March next, viz.-\n\nMajor-General Wemyes, at Athlone, and his Aide-de-Camp, Lieut.

A troop of the 1st Royal Dragoons, and the whole of the Artillery, along with their band (which played the Dead March in Saul) attended.\n\n~~~~~\n\nAt Tuam Petty Sessions on Monday, the Lord Bishop of Tuam, and Thos. Brerton, Esq., R.M., presiding, a poor man summoned Mr. Edward Concannon, Poor-rate Collector, for having exacted from him, 1s. costs, in addition to his poor rate of two pounds. A man having proved that no distress had been made on his property, the bench fined the collector 3s, being treble the sum exacted, and 1l. costs.\n\nWednesday last eight vessels with foreign bread stuffs arrived at Cork.\n\nBALLINA BENEVOLENT SOCIETY\n\nThe Committee of the Benevolent Society have pleasure in submitting to the Public for their inspection the report of their proceedings for the year 1849. And they feel thankful that they have been enabled in some measure to carry out an object as earnestly recommended and dearly cherished by some members of the Institution who have passed away amongst us. We have been apprehensive for the last three years that owing to the general outcry about the pressure of the times, and oppressive poor rates, we would have been obliged to relinquish this little effort to remove a small portion of that wretchedness, induced by extreme poverty, with which we are surrounded. Unhappily the poor law, instead of lessening the class of objects who in former years used to look to us for assistance, appears to have increased them. The destitute room-keeper, whose claims we advocate, clings to her miserable home with a tenacity that often surprises us. She would rather endure any amount of suffering, than relinquish it. To such, as far as our means will allow, we distribute articles of clothing, and in times of sickness, milk and other nourishment. It remains for the consideration of our subscribers whether they will continue their kind assistance in carrying out the design of this society.\n\nSubscriptions will be thankfully received by the Rev. Arthur Moore, Treasurer, or by any member of the Committee. The latter meet every Friday at the \"Ladies Society Room, for the encouragement of Industry,\" Knox's street.\n\nCOMMITTEE\n\nMRS.
