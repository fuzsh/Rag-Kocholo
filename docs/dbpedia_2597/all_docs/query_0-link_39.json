The union of England and Normandy u-as acconiplished ori\n\nthe 14th October, 1066, when William, Dukc of Norrnandy, on\n\nJhe pretest of being the acknowledged heir of the English King,\n\nEdward the Confesser (1042-106 6cf,ated and slew at Senlac\n\nHill near Hastings in Sussex, Harold 11 (January-October, 1066);\n\nwho had seized the throne on the Confeçsor's death. Following\n\nthis victory, \\ViIliarn had, nithi11 a feiv years, hrought the rest\n\nof England under his rule.\n\nIj. The Xorman Conquest Ras, however, iri no sense the migra-\n\ntion of a race from one territory to another. During the 10th and\n\n~xth centuries the Norsernen (Norrnans) hsd firmly established\n\nthemselves in Normaridy, and consolidatecl a growing principality,\n\nwhich admitted but a nominal suzerainty to French Kings. It\n\nwas iiot their intention to abandon thiç ricli conquest (which\n\nincluded the ChannelIslands) ;and thus King William I of England\n\n(1066-1087) devoted equal attention to hoth England and Nor-,\n\nmancly ;his barons held large estates in both, and the principles\n\nof feuclalism as practised in the Duchy werc iiitroduced into the\n\nnewly-won kingdom.\n\n16. After William's death there were occasions when inheritance\n\nor rebellion threatened to break this union. But, under King\n\nHenry II of England (1154-118g),the authority ofa singlesovereign\n\nwas firmly established in both England and Normandy. i\\loreover,\n\nby Henry's marriage with Eleanor ofAquitaine, considerable new\n\nterritories were added to his dorninioiis. Towards the end of Henry's\n\nreign, another danger to the retention of Normandy and other\n\nFrench possessions began to appear.

Meanwhile, Philip's. u1nbitio.n to conquer Englaiid was\n\natternpted during his lifetime by his son, Louis (afterivards\n\nLouis VIII), partly at the invitation of a rebellious English baron-\n\nage. The attempt, hawever, failed ; and, by the Treaty of Lam-\n\nbeth, signed on the rztli September, 1217 l, it was agreed, infer\n\ndia,that both sides should rccover the possessions ,which theÿ\n\nhad held before Philip's invasion of Kormandy in 1202. This\n\nprovision includecl such of the Channel Islands as still rernained\n\nin French Iiands (see paragraph 24, below).\n\n18. John was succeeded by his son, King Henry III of Englancl\n\n(12r6-127~), who made several u~isucceçsfulatternyts to regain his'\n\nlost possessions on the inainlantl of France. By a treaty dra~vn\n\nup at Abbeville on the 18th May, 1258, and ratified at Paris iii\n\nOctober, 1259 2, Henry renou~iced al1 claims to contincntal Nor-\n\ninandy, as well as certain other possessions there ;but the Channel\n\nIslands are not exprcssly ~nentioiied. Promises of the restitution\n\nof various other territories madc hv the French King, Louis IX\n\n(1226-12701, tardily or never implernented, led to fresh disputes.\n\nSome attempt \\vas made to scttle disputed points at Périgueux in\n\n1311, when the French claimed that, in virtue of thc Treaty of\n\n1259, al1 the Islands adjoining Normandy, Saintonge and Poitou\n\nshould be theirs. To this, the English replied that, in thcir opinion,\n\naccording to the terrns of thc Treaty, the King of England (i.e.,\n\nEdward II (1307-1327)) could neither surrender nor restore any\n\nIslands 3.

Before the French concluest of continental Normandy iii\n\n1204 from King Jolin (see paragraph 16, above), the Channel\n\nIslands were an integral part of the Duchy of Normancly and were\n\nincluded ivithin its administration. They had been annexed by\n\nWilliam Longsword, Diike of Normandy (g31-gqz), in 933-the\n\nyear in which he received also the districts of Avranches and\n\nCoutances from the Frencli King, Raoul (923-g36),following a\n\nsuccessful campaign against his western neighbours, the Bretons,\n\nMany important fiefs in the Islands were appurtenances of larger\n\nones, cliiefly in the Cotentin area (i.e th, modern Department of\n\nManche), but the Dukes tliemselves possessed considerable personal\n\nestates in the Islands.\n\n23. The Islands, during the years 1204-1213, changed hands\n\nbetween the English and the French more than once. RIuch of\n\nthe detsiled history of the cvents during these years is somewhat\n\nobscure. According to staternents made at the Assize of 1309%\n\n(see paragraphs 46 and 128, bclow),held in Jersey, King Philip II\n\n(Philip Augustus) of France (1180-1223) twice ejected the English\n\nKing John (1199-1216) froin the Islands, and the latter twice by\n\narmed force reconquered them. Philip appears to have endeavoured .\n\nat first to secure thern by persuasive means. His cause is said to,\n\nhave been supported there by a \"French party\", composed of lay\n\nand ecclesiasticalpersons with continental connexions. The majonty\n\nof the'Islanders, however, probably apprehensive of French inten-\n\ntions towards their own interests, opposed him4. About 1205,\n\nPhilip had secured the Islands by force of arms ; but, a yenr later,\n\nthe French were driven out by the English under Eustace the.\n\nMonk and John was able to resume their administration through.\n\nl Thc Royal Xrms of France, too, continued to be quartered untiycar.t\n\nFief:an estate heldabaron directly ofthe Kinreturn forcertainservices,\n\nchiefly military.\n\na Assiz: proceedings beforc thc King's justices in his Courts.\n\n' P.

After a long period of immunity, Jersej? was occuyied from\n\n1461 to 1468 (i.e d.,ring the struggle betwecn the rival English\n\nroyal Houses of York and Lancaster, known as the Wars of the\n\nRoses) first by the Seneschal of Normandy, Pierre de Brézé,Count\n\nof Maulevrier, who \\vas a cousin of Queen hlargaret, wife of the\n\ndeposed Lancastrian King of England, Henry VI (1422-1461). The\n\ncircurnstances surroiinding this occupation are obscure, but it\n\nseems probable that the Islands were found to be useful to the\n\nexiled House of Lancaster in bargaining for French aid 4.De Brézé\n\nmade no attempt to interfere either with the system of governmcnt\n\nin Jersey or with the Islanders' way of life ;and his Ordinances,\n\npromulgated in 1462, rcgarded as a landmark in the evolution\n\nof Jersey Government\" S. On his departure from the Island in\n\n1463, his follourer, Jean Carbonnel, heId it for Charles, Duke of\n\nNormandg, then in revolt against his brother, King Louis XI of\n\nFrance (1461-1483). Finally the Island wns retaken in 1468 for\n\nthe Yorkist King of England, Edward IV (1461-1483), by the\n\nEnglish fleet under Richard Harliston, with the help of Philip de\n\nCarteret. In 1549 a French expedition seized Sark (then uninliab-\n\nited) and held it for nine years ; attempts to land in Jersey and\n\nGuernsey were, hon~cver, repulsed.\n\n- ---\n\nl Le l'ataurelï'A~TfedievaAdmi~isfraiiooftheChaii~ieIslnizds,G2.\n\na Ibid.p. 64.\n\nLe Patourel, \"Ertrlier Invasof thChannel Islands\"(143~~).\n\n' Ibid.The storyof Sir Philipde Carteret's Iiolding western porticin of\n\nJersey is legenda:ythe French occupation was complete.\n\nIbid. 3IEWORIAL OP THE UNITED KINGDOM (3 III 52)\n\n3€l\n\nSteps taken toSafeguardthe ChaîtnelIslands /rom the Ravages of War\n\n34. 011 the 27th February, 1481, following a petition addressed\n\njointly by King Edward IV of England \"and the inhabitants\n\necclesiastical and secular of Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney and\n\nthe islands adjacent thereto\" to Pope Sixtus IV, complaining that\n\n\"divers pirates, etc.\" frequently raided the Islands, their churches,\n\nmonasteries and people, \"carrying off booty ....and prisoners,\n\nwaunding ancl slaying\", the Pope issued a monition ordering \"the\n\nsaid pirates, etc., and their abettors to abstain frorn such attacks;\n\netc., under pain of eoipso sentence of excommunication, anathema,\n\neternal malediction, confiscation, etc.\", atid to make restitution l.\n\nThe intention was evidently to protect the local commercial pros-\n\nperity of the Islands. On the 1st March, 1483, at the request of\n\nEdward IV, this temporary Papal injunction was re-issued by the\n\nsame Pope as a Bu11 2, which provided that the Islanders and their\n\nsurrounding seas, to the limit of human vision, should be regarded\n\nas neutrai in time of war, with immunity from capture within\n\nthose limits of enemy ships and goods 3.The Bull was hailed ~vith\n\nenthusiasm, not only in the Islands, but dso in France, where it\n\nmas officially proclaimed, and the new privilege of neutrality was\n\nenforced in both the I~lsular and the French courts. There were,\n\nof course, transgressions of the privilege, as in 1549, when Sark\n\nmas occupied by the French and attcmpts were made on Jersey\n\nand Guernsey. Again, in 1626,when war broke out between England\n\nand France, the Fr'ench Governmeilt issued proclamations prohib-\n\niting any tracic with the Islands a.\n\n35. Since the privilege of neutrality rested upon a Papal Bull,\n\na delicate situation was created by the rejection of Papal Supremacy &.\n\nIn practice the neutrality of the Islands was observed as before ;\n\nbut it was obviously necessary to replace the Bull as the authority\n\nfor the privilege.

This led the Privy Council\n\nto revieu. the whole c~uestion of neutrality. On the 11th Junc,\n\n1587, it informed Leighton that it was \"satisfied' that the privilege\n\nhad in fact esisted\", and he was \"instructed that no such arrest\n\n[of ships and goods] should be made in future tci the prejudice of\n\nthe island privileges and liberties.\"\n\n36.

Morcover, \\Villiam, at the very outset\n\nof his reign, had resolvcd upon war with France ; and, since a\n\nprofitable source of income to thc lslanders appears to have been\n\nthe supplying of guripowder and aminunition to the French niain-\n\nlaiicl, he no doubt tvished to preveiit trading with the potential\n\ncnemy 4.\n\nEcclesinstical Eve~zfs i~athe Islands\n\n37.

Sii-icethey were\n\ntherefore ecclesiristically within the jurisdiction of a.French Bishop,\n\nthe natural friction between the Bishop's and the King's Coiirts\n\nwas incvitably increased after their separation from Normandy.\n\nThere were twu main causes for this friction. The King ofteii found\n\ncause to allege that the Bishoy's Court was hearing pleas which\n\nthe King considered should be heard before Iiis own. For instance,\n\nin 1309, the liarden of the Islands was instructcd to proclaim the\n\nKing's order \"prohibiting any one from citirig, uilder pain of\n\nforfeiture, any of the officers of thc said island [sic]o ,r any other\n\nperson of the same, to appear before the bishop of Coutances and\n\notlier ecclesiastical judges outsidc the said islands to answcr\n\nconcerning inheritances and fees in the said islands, the cognisance\n\nwhereof pertains to the king, which he learns that certain men\n\nhave presuined to do\" 5.Again, the King claimed that the Islanders\n\nIbid., op. cil.,45-6.\n\nIbid.p. 46.\n\nPrivy Council Registe2/73, f209.

The difficulty\n\narising out of this privilege was overcome by appointing the two\n\nRural Deans in Jersey as special commissaries of the Bishop of\n\nCoutaiices, with authority to dcal with actions nominally within\n\nthe cornpetence of his Court. These Deanery Courts thus acquired\n\na certain measure of importance. Desyite these special provisions,\n\nthe anomaly of divided allegiance between an E~lglish King aiid\n\na French Bishop becamc increasingly intolerable under the impact\n\nof the Hundred Years' \\Var between England and France, and of\n\nthe Great Schisrn I.\n\n38.

During this periocl, particularly in Jersey, they\n\nwere occupied with problerns ofa domestic character. The insularitu ,\n\nof the inhabitants is testified by a cornplaint against foreigners\n\nsetting up shops for the sale of inerchandise in Jersey.

In addition to the clear description of the Ecrétious\n\nas a part of Jersey, it is significant that, the day bcfore the Priors\n\nreceived their protections, a comniission issued from the English\n\nExcliequer ordering the seizure of the property of \"al1 Frenchmen\n\nand others of the lordship and power of the king of France, as well\n\nsecular as religious, within the king's realm and power\", and the\n\ndetention of all religious in their houses, as it was known that the\n\nKing of France had gathered together a \"great fleet in divers parts\n\nof his Iordship\" which was to be sent against the rcalm and the\n\nChannel Isla~lds \".\n\n49.

In 1692 an Act of the States\n\nof Jersey 3, because of a state of war between England and France,\n\nrestricted travel to the Ecréhous. Only such persons as had legiti-\n\nmate busiriess, çuch asgathering sea-weed,were allowed to go there.\n\nThe object was to prevent trading with the enemy. In 1692Philippe\n\nLe Geyt, another Jersey historian, mentions fish-tithes payable on\n\nthe Island un fish csught offits coasts and off certain Islets, among\n\nwhich he specifically includes the Ecréhous 4.\n\n50. From the 19th century onwards references to the Ecréhous\n\nbecorne more common. They are coiisidered in Section A of Part II\n\nof this Mernorial.\n\n51. References to the Minquiers Islets are far fewer than thoçe\n\nto the Ecréhous Islets. Apparently, the earliest mention of the\n\nMinquiers belongs to the reigrl of King James I of England (1603-\n\n1625). 011 1615,1616 and 1617, there are entries on the rolls of the\n\nCourt of the Fief and Seignory of Noirmont in Jersey, which shew'\n\nthat the Crown claimed the right to wreck of the sea at the Min-\n\nquiers Islets which the Crown would not have done, if the Min-\n\nquiers had not been regarded as British territory . Towards the end\n\nof the same century this right became the subject of a law-suit.\n\nOn the 6th Auest,. 1692, the King's Attorney-General and the\n\nKing's Receiver of Revenues in Jersey successfully claimed .the\n\nright to wreck at the hlincluiers in defiance of the counter-claim of\n\n' ' Exlente de I'Ile de Jersey, 1607.- Jacques I (SociéféJersiaise, 5th Pubn.),\n\npp. 6-7 ; Extente {ac.), 1668.-Charles 11 (S.

Later references (i.e.after the 17th century) are considered\n\nin Section B of Part II of this Rlemorial.\n\nConclusion\n\n54. As it has been stated (see paragraph 21, above), no English\n\nsovereign after Edward IV (1461-14 8er)ously considered recover-\n\ning the lost possessionsof England in France itself. Thus, continental\n\nNormandy waç, in actual fact, relinquished to the French Crown,\n\ndespite the absence of any forma1 instrument which ackiiowledged\n\nits surrender.\n\n55. The Channel Islands themselves, however, contiilued, escept\n\nfor certain brief periods, in the firm possession of the English. The\n\nlongest period during which any of them was occupied by a French\n\nforce was from 1461-1468, during the IVarsof the Roses (see para-\n\ngraph 33, above). Other French attacks upon the Islands were\n\nsporadic, and at no time did the invaderç obtain, except in the case\n\nof Sark in the niiddle of the 16th century (seeparagraphs 33'ancl34,\n\nabove), more tIian a temporary foothold.\n\n56. It will be seen therefore that during the Middle Ages the\n\nChannel Islands remained attached to the English Crown by feudal\n\nties, the English King was represented there by Lords or Wardens\n\nof the Islands, and the latter delegated their administrative func-\n\ntions to officiaismainly drawn from the Islanders. In later years the\n\nIslanders themselves secured an increasing degree of administrative\n\nautonomy, but this neither impaired the sovereignty of the English\n\nCrown over the Islands, nor prejudiced the ailegiance ofthe Islanclers\n\nto the Crown.\n\n57. That the Ecrétious were considered iil medieval tirnes tv be\n\npart of the Channel IsIands is shewn by the fact that Piers des\n\n1 Acte de la CourRoy:tlde 1'Ilede Jersey.

JIEJIORIAL OF THE USITED KISGDOM (3 111 j2)\n\n46\n\nPréaux, who had been granted the Channel Islands by John in.\n\nrzoo, considered that he, in turn, in 1203, could grant these Isletç\n\nby subinfeudation in virtiie of the charter of 1200, which mentioned.\n\nby namc only the three largest Channel Islands (i.e.,Jersey, Guern-\n\nsey, and Alderney ;see paragraph 4, ahove). Aftcr the separation.\n\nof the whole archipelago from continental Normandy in 1204, the\n\ncontinuation of thc Ecréhoiisas an appendage of Jersey during the.\n\nMiddle Ages is shewn by various judicial and administrative acts,\n\nwhich are dealt with in paragraphs 46 to 49 inclusive, above, in\n\nyaragraphs 128 to131 inclusive, below, and in yaragraph zoo, below..\n\nEvidence relating to the Minquiers is of latcr origin than that con--\n\ncerning the Ecréhous. Its absence before 1615 (the earliest date of'\n\nany present evidence discovered by the Government of the United\n\nKingdom) is prohably due to loss of records. There iç evidence to.\n\nprove the existence as far back as 1550 (and possibly still earlier) of'\n\nCourt Rolls of the Seignory of Noirmont, which claimed seignoriaL\n\nrights over the Minquiers l.It would seem unlikely that these rights.\n\nshould suddenly have been first exercised in the year 1615 (seepara--\n\ngraph 51, nbove).\n\n58. The acts inanifesting sovereignty, which are set out in.\n\nPart II of this Memorial, shew that in modern times the close,\n\nrelationship between Jersey and both groups of Isletç, the existence\n\nof which is supported by the medieval and 17th century evidence,\n\nwas but the continuation of an already long established state\n\nof afiairs.\n\nSub-Section C.-The Present Constitution of Jersey\n\n59. The Channel Islands are included among the British Isles,\n\nbut do not form part of the United Kingdom. The laws of the.\n\nChannel Islands are based on the ancient customs of the Duchy\n\nof Wormaildy, of whicli tliey foniied part until 1205. The saver--\n\neignty of the King of England is, to the present day, only admitted\n\nin his right: as Dukc of Normandy. The Channel Islands are siibject.\n\nto the legislativc supremacy of the United Kingdom Parliament,.\n\nwhich is exercised for them inrelation to such subjects as nationality.\n\nand defence. The legislative assemblies of Jersey and Guernsey,.\n\nknown as the States, have power to pass Acts which require the-\n\napproval of the King in Council. The Channel Islands possess.\n\ntheir own courts from which an appeal lies to the Judicial Com-\n\nmittee of the Privy Council in London.\n\n60.

Through the years, it became customary for the\n\nRoyal Court, in matters of importance, to call to its assistance\n\nand counsel \"the captain, or his lieutenant in his absence, erith\n\nthe 12 ministers [or rectors] :inclthe ra constables\" of the Jersey\n\nyarishes, and this body came to bc called the Three Estates or\n\nthe Common Council of the Island. Legislative yower remained\n\nwith the Royal Court until 1771, when it was removed from that\n\nbody and vested in the whole \"Assernbly of the States\", thiit is\n\nto ssy, the 12 Jurats, the 12 Rectors and the 12 Constables of\n\nthe parishes.\n\n61. In 1Sj6, 14 Ileputies werc added to the States and the\n\nconstitution of that Asscmbly remained unchanged (save for an\n\niiicrease, in 1907, iii the niimber of Deputies from 14 to 17) rintil\n\n~gqS, when a major constitutional reform took place, a riew\n\nAssembly of the States, consisting of 12 Senators, 12 Constables\n\nand 25 Deputies, being created. Thc Jurats and the Rectors ceased\n\nto sit in the States, the former, however, remaining in office as\n\nmembers of the Royal Court.\n\n62.

The Lieutenant-Governor 2, who is also appointed by the\n\nSovereign, and who is tlie successor of the \"captain\" previously\n\nreferred to (see paragraph 60, above), continues, as of old, to enjoy\n\nthe right to sit, and to speak, in the States. He is the representative\n\nof Her Majesty in the Islancl, anci is the official channel of com-\n\nmunication between the Governmerit of the United Kingdoni and\n\nthe Insular Authorities.\n\n64. The administrative authority of the States is exercisecl\n\nthrough Committees of its inemhers elected by, and respoiisibIe.\n\nto, the Assembly. Two of those Committees, that is to Say, of\n\nHarbours and Airport (formerly Pierç and Harbours) and of'\n\nFinance, are concerncd with the Minquiers and the Ecréhous, the\n\nformer because it is responsible for fisheries, the maintenance of\n\nbuoys and beacons and navigational matters generally, the latter\n\nbecause it is the Insular Customs authoritÿ.
