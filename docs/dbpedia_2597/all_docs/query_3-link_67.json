        "text": "THE CREATORS OF THE THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSE\n\nThe racing of Running Horses for the purposes of gambling had long been established in England by the time it was banned, along with theatres, dancing and Christmas festivities, by Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth. The Restoration of Charles II in 1660 saw the resumption of horse racing and the beginning of a breeding process that resulted in the production of the Thoroughbred Racehorse.\n\nThere is much confusion surrounding the identities, dates and pedigrees of the horses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The absence of names and dates for most of the mares, the custom of referring to imported oriental stallions by the names of their successive owners, horses known by more than one name and horses with identical names, has left us with a mass of unreliable, contradictory and sometimes downright impossible pedigrees.\n\nIn order to identify and date the horses of this period it is essential to know the owners and breeders of this period. They were members of the royal family, the nobility and the landed gentry, of well documented family histories, interrelated and were, with very few exceptions, descendants of, or married to descendants of, Henry I.\n\nThe Compiler of this website is JAMES RONALD HARDIMAN See below\n\nSee THE ANCESTORS OF JAMES RONALD HARDIMAN\n\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF OWNERS AND BREEDERS\n\nWILLIAM AISLABIE (1704-) Breeder of Bucephalus and Poor Robin Sir RALPH ASSHETON 2nd Baronet (1651-1716) Breeder of Fox and Fox-Cub GEORGE BAKER 'Last of the George Bakers' JOHN BARTLETT of Nutwith Coate, near Masham, Yorkshire (1707-1769) Owner of Bartlett's Childers CHARLES BENNET 1st Earl of Tankerville (-1722) Owner of Bay Wilkinson HENRY BENNET Earl of Arlington (1618-1685) Owner of Arlington Barb Mare WILLIAM BENTINCK 2nd Duke of Portland (1708-1762) Owner of Portland Arabian PEREGRINE BERTIE 2nd Duke of Ancaster (1686-1742) Breeder of Gentleman, Romp and Look-at-me-lads ROBERT BERTIE 1st Duke of Ancaster (-1722) Owner of Oldfield Mare WILLOUGHBY BERTIE 4th Earl of Abingdon (1740-1799) Breeder of Potoooooooo HUGH BETHELL (-1752) Owner of Bethell's Arabian THOMAS BLADEN (1697-1780) Owner of Bladen's Grey Horse GEORGE BOWES (1701-1760) Breeder of Cato, Romulus and Remus WILLIAM BOWES (1657-1707) Owner of Bowes Byerley Turk mare Sir FRANCIS BOYNTON 8th Baronet (1777-1832) Owner of one of the half-bred brothers to Spitfire, the grandam of Muley Moloch FRANCIS BROWNE 4th Viscount Montague (-1708) Breeder of Whiteshirt mare Sir JOHN BROWNLOW 5th Baronet (-1754) Owner of Brownlow Turk GEORGE BRUDENELL 3rd Earl of Cardigan (1685-1732) Owner of Cardigan Colt Sir CHARLES BUNBURY 6th Baronet (1740-1821) Owner of Diomed ROBERT BURDETT (1670-1716) Owner of Vixen and breeder of Old Child Mare, Young Child Mare and Whimsey ROBERT BYERLEY (1660-1714) Owner of Byerley's Turk WILLIAM CAPELL 3rd Earl of Essex (1697-1743) Owner of Smiling Ball WILLIAM CAVENDISH 2nd Duke of Devonshire (1673-1729) Owner of Basto, Old Scar and Childers LEONARD CHILDERS of Carr House, near Doncaster, Yorkshire (1673-1748) Breeder of Childers and Bartlett's Childers Sir HUGH CHOLMLEY 4th Baronet (1632-1689) Owner of Cholmondeley's Barb Mare JOHN CHURCHILL 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722) Owner of Marlborough Little Mountain Barb CHARLES COCKAYNE 5th Viscount Cullen (1710-) Owner of Cullen Arabian EDWARD COKE (1701-1733) Owner of Coke's Arabian, later known as Godolphin Arabian CHARLES COLYEAR 2nd Earl of Portmore (1700-1785) Owner of Squirt ANTHONY ASHLEY COOPER 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (1621-1683) Owner of Shaftesbury Turk VELTERS CORNWALL Owner of Hutton's Spot and Redstreak WILLIAM CROFTS Baron Crofts of Saxham (1611-1677) Master of the Horse to James, Duke of York.
