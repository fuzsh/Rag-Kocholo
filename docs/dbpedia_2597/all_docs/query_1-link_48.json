        "text": "History\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort is a title that has been created several times for members of the prominent Somerset family.\n\nThe first creation came in 1385 when John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford was granted the title of Duke of Beaufort by King Richard II. However, this creation was short-lived and the title became extinct upon his death in 1400.\n\nIn 1605, James I created Sir Henry Pierrepont, 2nd Baron Pierrepont as Duke of Beaufort. This creation lasted until 1619 when he died without male heirs.\n\nIn 1643, the title was revived once again for William Seymour, 2nd Marquess of Hertford who had married the wealthy widow Catherine Spencer, daughter of the 1st Earl of Sunderland. However, due to his father-in-law’s opposition, he was never able to assume the title and it passed instead to their son, Edward Seymour, 3rd Marquess of Hertford on his grandfather’s death in 1652.\n\nIn 1660, the title was inherited by Edward’s younger brother, Algernon Seymour, 4th Marquess of Hertford who had previously served as Lord High Treasurer under King Charles II. He held the title until his death in 1684.\n\nIn 1709, the title was once again bestowed upon John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne who had been a prominent politician during the reigns of Queen Anne and King George I. His descendants continued to hold the title until the death of Percy Wyndham-Deedes, 12th Duke of Leinster in 1968. Since then, there have been no further creations of Dukes of Beaufort.\n\nFamily tree\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort is a title that has been created twice in British history.\n\nThe first creation came in 1385 when John de Mowbray was granted the title by King Richard II. He had already been appointed Earl of Nottingham and Baron Bromley, but this new title gave him additional power and influence within the kingdom. His descendants continued to hold the title until it became extinct in 1472 upon the death of his great-grandson, also named John de Mowbray.\n\nThe second creation came in 1609 when Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Surrey, was granted the title of Duke of Beaufort by James I. This time, the title was given as part of an arrangement between the Howards and the Tudor dynasty, which allowed for more stability in government. The Howards were one of the most powerful families in England at the time, and the Duke of Beaufort held significant political power.\n\nHis son, Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort, married into the royal family through his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of King James VI of Scotland and I of England. Their son, Charles Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort, was instrumental in the English Civil War, fighting on behalf of the Royalists against Parliamentarians. After the war ended in 1651, he fled to France and remained there for several years before returning to England under Oliver Cromwell‘s rule.\n\nIn the following centuries, the dukes of Beaufort continued to play important roles in British politics and society. They supported the Hanoverian succession after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, and their support helped secure the ascension of George I to the throne. In modern times, the current Duke of Beaufort is David Michael Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort, who inherited the title from his father in 1986.\n\nCoat of arms\n\nThe coat of arms for Duke of Beaufort is a red shield with three gold lions passant guardant on it.\n\nIn heraldry, a lion represents courage and royalty. The word “passant” means walking or moving forward, while “guardant” indicates that the lions are facing forward rather than turned towards each other.\n\nThe motto associated with this coat of arms is “Quam bellum pro patria”, which translates to “For war against my country.” This reflects the historical role of the dukes in defending their homeland from invasion by foreign powers.\n\nTitle and rank\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort is a title in the Peerage of England.\n\nIt was created on 29 July 1682 for Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester, by King Charles II. He had already been created Earl of Glamorgan in 1643 and Marquess of Worcester in 1660. The dukedom is one of the most ancient and noble titles in the British peerage, having been held by several prominent families since at least the 12th century.\n\nThe current holder of the title is David Michael Somerset, 11th Duke of Beaufort, who succeeded his father in 2017.\n\nDucal residences\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort has had several ducal residences throughout history.\n\nOne of his most notable residences was Badminton House in Gloucestershire, which is still owned by the Duke of Beaufort and used as his main residence. Built in the early 17th century, it is an example of English Baroque architecture and features a large library and art collection.\n\nAnother important residence of the Duke of Beaufort is Llangoed Castle in Carmarthenshire, Wales. This castle dates back to the 12th century and has been owned by the family since the mid-16th century. It is now open to visitors and offers guided tours of its historic rooms and gardens.\n\nNotable family members\n\n– Sir George Grey, 3rd Baronet (1675-1742), British politician and diplomat\n\n[Sir] William Grey, 4th Baronet (1729-1807), British politician and landowner\n\n[Lady] Jane Grey, Countess of Berkeley (c. 1537–1554), English noblewoman and cousin to King Edward VI\n\n[Sir] Thomas Grey, 1st Earl of Windsor (1451-1501), English nobleman and military commander during the Wars of the Roses\n\n[Sir] John Grey, 2nd Earl of Windsor (died 1554), English nobleman and son of the previous earl\n\n[Sir] Henry Grey, 3rd Earl of Windsor (1515-1554), English nobleman and soldier who fought in the French wars under Henry VIII\n\n[Sir] Edmund Grey, 4th Earl of Windsor (1516-1554), English nobleman and soldier who fought alongside his brother in the French wars\n\n[Sir] Richard Grey, 5th Earl of Windsor (1524-1558), English nobleman and courtier to Queen Mary I\n\n[Sir] Thomas Grey, 6th Earl of Windsor (1530-1554), English nobleman and military commander who fought for both England and Scotland\n\nDuchess consorts\n\nThe Duchess consort is the wife of a duke.\n\nIn England and Scotland, the wife of a duke is known as a duchess. In France, she is called a princesse d’Orléans or a comtesse de Paris.\n\nThe title of duchess is derived from the French word duc, which means “duke.” It was first used in the Middle Ages to refer to the highest-ranking noble in a region, equivalent to an English earl or Scottish lord.\n\nToday, there are approximately 300 British peers who hold the title of duke, including several married to duchesses. These include Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex; and Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nThe Duke of Beaufort has been married three times.\n\nHis first marriage was to Lady Mary Eleanor Lennox, daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Somerset, on 14 May 1709 at St. James’s Church, Westminster. They had six children together:\n\n– Henry Somerset, 6th Duke of Beaufort (1743–1803)\n\n– Lord William Somerset (died young)\n\n– Lady Elizabeth Murray (wife of Sir Thomas Murray)\n\n– Lady Frances Seymour (wife of George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales)\n\n– Lady Emily Lennox (wife of John Carteret, 5th Earl Granville)\n\nTheir eldest son, Henry Somerset, succeeded his father as the 6th Duke of Beaufort in 1792.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, the Duke remarried to Anne Hunt, daughter of Thomas Hunt of Swansea, on 25 March 1714 at Badminton House, Gloucestershire.

They did not have any children together.\n\nMilitary career\n\nSir Henry Somerset was commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards on October 20, 1759.\n\nHe rose through the ranks and served as a captain in the 4th Regiment of Foot from January 1763 to May 1768. He then became a major in the 2nd Dragoons before being promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 6th Light Dragoons in August 1772.\n\nSomerset fought in the American Revolutionary War, serving as commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America from June 1775 until his resignation in March 1776. During this time, he led troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Siege of Boston.\n\nIn September 1776, he was appointed Governor of Jamaica, where he remained for three years. Upon returning to England, he was made a general and given command of the 2nd Division of the army. In 1782, he was appointed Colonel of the 6th Foot, which later became the Royal Irish Rifles.\n\nSir Henry Somerset died on July 1, 1799, at the age of 70.\n\nLegacy"
