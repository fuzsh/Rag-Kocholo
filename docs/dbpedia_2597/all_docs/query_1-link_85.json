She is often credited with being born on 03 Sep 1654 and baptised the same day, in Kilkhampton, Cornwall, England[1] but it seems likely this is a daughter who died young, as Grace was said to have been aged 77 when she was buried in 1744, which would place her birth in about 1667. Her husband died in 1695 aged 28, which would also place his birth in about the same year,[2] and difficult to imagine he would have married a woman 13 years older than himself.\n\nHer father also states in his will that she was his youngest daughter; \"my youngest daughter Grace wife of George Lord Carteret\" and the codicil mentions \"my dear daughter the Lady Carterett\".[3]\n\nShe and her husband, George Carteret were married when quite young, the licence dated 15 March 1674/75. He succeeded as Baronet, and was created Baron Carteret of Hawnes, county Bedford 19 October 1681.[2]\n\nShe and her sisters Jane, the wife of Sir William Leveson-Gower, and Catharine, the wife of Craven Peyton, were the three co-heirs of their nephew William Henry Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath when he died of the smallpox, without issue in May 1711.[4] Grace was created Viscountess Carteret and Countess Granville 1 January 1714/15, with remainder to her heirs male, but a special remainder for the Viscounty only to her husband's brother Edward Carteret.[2]\n\nShe died on 18 October 1744 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 27 October that year, aged 77. The administration of her estate was granted on 2 November 1744. Her eldest surviving son, John Carteret, succeeded to all her titles.[2]\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:N53T-J7J : 11 February 2018, Grace Grenvile, 03 Sep 1654); citing KILKHAMPTON,CORNWALL,ENGLAND, index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 897,356.\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Cokayne, George Edward, The Complete Peerage: or a history of the House of Lords and all its members from the earliest times, 2nd ed., vol. 6, rev and ed. by Hon.
