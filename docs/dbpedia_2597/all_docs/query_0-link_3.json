        "meta_description": "Carteret is a surname of Norman origin. It derives from Carteret, Normandy, an inhabited place on the northwest coast of the Cotentin peninsula, facing the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands are the only remnant of the Duchy of Normandy, the original territorial holding of William the Conqueror, who invaded England in 1066. Historically, members of the Carteret family have occupied influential positions in the Channel Islands, notably as hereditary Seigneurs of Sark and hereditary Bailiffs of Jersey.",
