Kilkenny, who was descended from Thomas Swift, eldest brother of the half blood to William Swift of Rotherham, grandfather of Viscount Carlingford.\" This case was commonly referred to the contemporary Press as \"the Carlingford Peerage case.\" This, however, is misleading - the case should be better described as \"Swifte v. Swifte,\" since the legal battle was over the plaintiff's entitlement to participate in the personal estate of his dead father. At no time was any attempt made to obtain recognition of the plaintiff's right to be acknowledged as \"Viscount Carlingford.\" The case occupied large sections of the newspapers of the time, and I have therefore sought out those reports which best convey the facts of the case, commencing with the \"Daily Mail\" of 2 November 1905:- 'There commenced before the Irish Master of the Rolls [Sir Andrew Porter] at Dublin yesterday a trial which has been long pending, and which involves the possession of the estates and title of the Carlingford peerage, which has been dormant for some years. 'The plaintiff is George Godwin Barnham Swifte, who claims to be the lawful child of a former Lord Carlingford, and as such entitled to a share of the estate at present held by Mary Jane Swifte and Godwin Butler Meade Swifte. The latter is now Master of Swiftesheath, a fine old mansion with an extensive and picturesque estate in County Kilkenny. 'Counsel for the plaintiff said that the peerage was dormant and Mr. Swifte claimed it, but had never prosecuted his claim in the House of Lords. In 1842 Lord Carlingford secretly married Miss Jane Hopkins, daughter of the late Captain Hopkins, of the 76th Regiment, and in 1845 the parties were publicly married in Liverpool. 'Two children were born of that marriage - Longueville Meade Swifte and the plaintiff. Viscountess Carlingford, otherwise Hopkins, died in 1848. Lord Carlingford subsequently, in 1863, married the defendant, Mary Jane Swifte. The defence, said counsel, had been raised by this lady that the plaintiff, his brother Longueville, and his sister, were not lawful children of their father, because he had openly committed bigamy by marrying Miss Hopkins - a previous marriage having been effected by Lord Carlingford with Baroness de Wetzlar, which was still existing. 'The plaintiff submitted that the Court of Probate in Ireland had declared Lord Carlingford to be the lawful husband of [the] plaintiff's mother. It was a very significant incident that when the second marriage took place in Liverpool, one of the wedding presents was from Baroness de Wetzlar, who was alleged by the defendant to be the first wife of Lord Carlingford. After that marriage Lord and Lady Carlingford resided in Dublin, and plaintiff and his brother were recognised as their lawful children. Counsel referred to an elder sister of the plaintiff, who was presented at the first Drawing Room after the death of the Prince Consort as the Hon. Julia Ianthe Swifte, and who afterwards married Dr. O'Flaherty, an eminent London physician. 'When sixteen years of age the plaintiff was asked to sign indentures to enter a ship called the Sandringham. He refused to do so, and went to his sister in London. Before the ship sailed from Plymouth, the plaintiff went down to join the vessel, but the captain refused to take him on board. After a time the plaintiff was put on board the Royal Alice, and sailed for Australia, with directions to join the Sandringham there; but again the captain refused to take him. 'When in Calcutta, on board the Royal Alice, he heard accidentally of his father's death, which took place in July 1864. It so happened that the Sandringham was also at Calcutta, and left port with 700 coolies. It was her last voyage, as she was lost with all hands, except the captain and his wife. 'Counsel had not concluded his argument when the court rose.' Upon the resumption of the hearing, the \"Daily Mail\" of 3 November 1905 reported:- 'When the hearing of the legitimacy suit of Swifte v. Swifte was resumed by the Master of the Rolls at Dublin yesterday, very interesting evidence was given by the plaintiff, George Godwin Barnham Swifte. 'He claims the dormant Carlingford peerage; but in this suit only seeks a declaration that the personal estate of the late Godwin Meade Pratt Swifte, commonly known as Lord Carlingford, was divisible between himself, his deceased brother, Longueville Meade Swifte, and one of the defend- ants, Godwin B.M. Swifte; and a declaration that the second defendant, Mrs. May [Mary?] Jane Swifte, was liable to make good and pay to the plaintiff and to the legal personal representative of Longueville M. Swifte the full amount of their shares. The total yearly value of the property in dispute is stated to be about £20,000. 'Mr. Swifte, in the course of examination, said that his father, who was generally known as Lord Carlingford, was named Gordon [Godwin?] Meade Pratt Swifte. He produced the certificate of his father's marriage with Jane Anne Hopkins in Liverpool on March 18, 1846. The witness was born January 10, 1847. The birth and baptismal certificates of himself and his brother Longueville were produced. His father told him he had gone through the ceremony of marriage with his wife in 1842, and that the marriage was registered at Doctors' Commons, but that it was technically irregular. At the same time he thought it was perfectly legal. 'The witness also produced his schoolbooks, in which his name was entered as the Hon. George Swifte. His mother died in 1847, and his father married Miss Clarke in 1863. The witness and his brothers and sister lived in the house afterwards as members of the family. When his father returned from the honeymoon he had a conversation with Harold, one of his (witness's) brothers, in the ball-room. Harold on that occasion refused to go to sea, or to California, informing his father at the same time that he was heir to the title and property. His father replied that he was sorry Harold was not the heir, as he was born before the Liverpool marriage; and he added that Longueville was the heir. 'Harold left to reside in another part of the country, and the property, which had till then been managed by him, was taken in charge by Eldon Clarke. About a week after that witness went to sea. 'At a later period, when he saw his father declining in health, he asked him to allow him £100 a year. His father replied, \"Oh, that's nothing. You will be very well off.\" In reply to a further question by the witness, his father said, \"Harold is not my heir. Your brother Longueville is.\" His father had always claimed the title, but never asserted his right to it. He was about to do so when he died. 'He went on to tell how he was supplied with a sea-chest inscribed \"The Hon. G.B. Swifte\" and told to go to sea; how he ran away and hid in a plantation, and how the captain of the Sandring- ham, when the plaintiff at last went to Plymouth to join the ship, refused to allow him on board. Then he joined the Royal Alice, and found the Sandringham at Calcutta and heard of his father's death. The Sandringham after went down with 700 coolies on board, and when Mr. Swifte went home Mrs. Swifte said they had supposed he was lost with the ship. 'The Solicitor-General: Did you give any instructions for formulating a charge against the defend- ant, Mrs. Swifte, of having, with the assistance of her relatives, endeavoured to entrap you to get into a ship the captain of which was to scuttle it? - Oh, no. An unseaworthy ship. And consequently to drown you? - If she was lost. And she was lost. And was it done for the express purpose? Is that the charge you have made? - There is great suspicion about it. To secure your death? - That was the suspicion. Do you charge that today? - Well, as far as suspicion goes, I was told on board the other vessel that I was sent away to be got rid of. 'Mrs. O'Flaherty, sister of the plaintiff and widow of Dr. O'Flaherty, a London physician, said she was the daughter of the late Godwin Swifte, commonly called Viscount Carlingford. At the first Drawing Room held after the death of the Prince Consort Lord Carlisle was Lord Lieutenant [1859- 1864], and she was presented as the Hon. Miss Swifte. Her father attended the Levee, and she thought there was some demur about him being presented as Lord Carlingford. He was ushered in as Godwin Swifte, Esq., and he said, \"No. I am Lord Carlingford.\" She was taken to the vault where her mother was buried, and her father pointed out the coffin with the name Viscountess Carlingford. 'Her father told her everything about the marriage with the Baroness de Wetzlar. He said that her mother did not like the way in which she and her father were living. She was a Roman Catholic, and they were married by a Roman Catholic priest just to ease her conscience, and that her papa consented. 'He said that he then went to Naples, where he was always considered a bachelor and moved in the highest circles. It was given out that he was a married man, and he was angry about it. He told her that he came home and then married her mother. He said that the divorce [marriage to Baroness de Wetzlar?] was annulled and that the deeds proving it were in a tin box under his bed. 'The court then adjourned.' Extracted from the Derby \"Daily Telegraph\" of 4 November 1905:- 'The Solicitor-General then opened the case for the defendants, stating he would prove that in 1833, in the parish chapel at Loitsch, in Austria, according to the most strict formalities of the Austrian law, the parish priest celebrated a marriage between Lord Carlingford and Baroness de Wetzlar. There was nothing at the time to prevent the marriage taking place in Ireland, for the penal law in force at the time only prohibited a priest from celebrating a marriage between a Protestant and a Roman Catholic. Counsel contended that this marriage was valid, and that therefore the plaintiff's case failed. Ernest Swifte, divisional police magistrate, Dublin, and a cousin of the defendant, said in August last year he went to Loitsch, in Austria, and found in the Parish Church register an entry of the marriage of Lord Carlingford and the Baroness de Wetzlar in 1833. He subsequently obtained a copy of the certificate of the death of the Baroness in 1856. Witness produced copies of both documents.' Judgment was finally given on 15 November and fully reported in the \"Daily Telegraph\" of 16 November 1905:- 'The Master of the Rolls delivered judgment, yesterday, in Dublin, in the case of Swifte v. Swifte, in which the plaintiff, George Barnham Swifte sought a declaration that he was a lawful son of the late Godwin Pratt Swifte, commonly called Lord Carlingford, of Swifte's Heath, Kilkenny, and as such entitled to a share in the personal estate of his deceased father. Mrs. Swifte, the widow, contested the claim, on the ground that when her late husband married the plaintiff's mother he had a lawful wife alive in Austria. 'His lordship, in the course of an exhaustive judgment, which occupied an hour and three quarters in delivery, stated the causes of action. The amount of money which, in any event, represented the share of the personal estate to which, in his own view, the plaintiff was entitled would be a relatively small sum. That was the matter in respect of which the action was brought. No question and no claim to a peerage arose, or could arise, in the action. It was perfectly clear that no peerage whatever was involved, and his lordship would not, as he had done during the hearing, give people a title or a name to which no right had been shown. It was not an action for the recovery of large estates, nor, except in the case which was commenced by the same plaintiff in 1884, had any claim been put forward to the real estate. 'The circumstances of the present case were somewhat peculiar. They had been called romantic, but so far as his lordship's functions were concerned he had only to deal with a question of the legal rights of the parties. The facts of the case were only conversant with the transactions of Mr. Godwin Pratt Swifte, who was born, apparently, about 1808. He came into possession of the family estates, and, as was the custom of that period when a young man reached a certain age, he went abroad on what was called the grand tour. When in Austria he met a lady who was called the Baroness von Wetzlar and there could be no doubt that she was a person of good family. Her father was the Baron von Wetzlar, and her mother had been the Countess von Egb. When Mr. Godwin Pratt Swifte met her they formed an acquaintance which ripened into intimacy, the precise character of which his lordship did not care to go into. He had no evidence one way or the other about it, although there were some statements made at the Bar in reference to it. 'Whether their acquaintance was unduly intimate or perfectly harmless, there was no doubt that on Feb. 3, 1833, he was married to her in the Catholic Church at St. Loitsch, in Austria, by the parish priest. That marriage has been proved as a matter of fact beyond all question. She was his lawful wedded wife unless the marriage was invalidated by circumstances which were so very much pressed at the Bar, founded on the provisions in the penal code. They appeared to have separated; whether they intended to separate permanently or not his lordship did not know. 'Having returned to this country the husband undoubtedly contracted another marriage on March 18, 1845, with a Miss Jane Ann Hopkins, a young lady who occupied a respectable position in society. She was married regularly in Liverpool Parish Church. The first wife, the Baroness von Wetzlar, was beyond all question living at that time, for she did not die till Jan. 30, 1859. If the first marriage, there fore, was valid, and was not determined by divorce or some other equivalent, the marriage of 1845 was illegal and void. 'At the time of the 1845 marriage there were two children of Godwin Pratt Swifte and Jane Hopkins, born before the Liverpool marriage, one of them named Harold and the other a daughter, who was respectably married in London, and his lordship wished to say, in speaking of these things, that he desired most strongly to emphasize his opinion that there was nothing discredit- able to either of these children as regards their birth. If they were illegitimate no one, under the circumstances of the case, would refrain from sympathising with them. 'Longueville Swifte, the third child of this union, was born on May 9, 1845, a couple of months after the marriage of his parents in Liverpool. The plaintiff, George Barnham Swifte, was the fourth child of the same marriage, the second that was born in wedlock, assuming the marriage in Liverpool was a legal marriage. Then Longueville would have ranked as the eldest son of his parents, notwithstanding the existence of the boy Harold. Longueville died somewhere about 1871, and therefore at that time, if the Liverpool marriage was a good one, the plaintiff would have become entitled as heir-at-law to his father's estate. Jane Ann Hopkins having died on Aug. 14, 1847, the husband, so far as the marriage with her was concerned, was free to contract another, and he did contract a marriage with Mary Jane Clarke in February, 1863. Apart altogether from every other question in the case, there could be none as to the validity of that marriage, because the Baroness von Wetzlar was then dead some four years and Jane Ann Hopkins was also dead. Of the marriage with Mary Jane Clarke there was issue only one son, Godwin Swifte, who had been joined as a co-defendant. His father, Godwin Pratt Swifte, died on July 14, 1864, intestate. 'His lordship held that the Austrian marriage was legal. It was not celebrated in Ireland between British subjects. If it had been the Act of George II would have applied. It was celebrated in Austria and as had been sworn to by lawyers from that country was in strict conformity with the laws of Austria [and as a result the plaintiff was illegitimate]. 'Turning to the allegations implied against the defendant in the interrogatories administered to her by the plaintiff, the Master of the Rolls said they amounted to a shameful and scandalous abuse of the process of the Court. They alleged, for instance, that the defendant conspired with others to murder the plaintiff by having him put to sea in an unseaworthy vessel with a disreputable captain. How, he asked, was a lady living in Kilkenny to know that a certain vessel was seaworthy or not, and how was she to know that her captain was a disreputable person capable of taking part in, and giving effect to, a murder conspiracy? It was a ridiculous assumption. The plaintiff had failed on all points and judgment would be for the defendant, with costs.' Charles Robert Carington, 3rd Baron Carrington and later Marquess of Lincolnshire A man by the name of Eustace Clare Grenville Murray was, in August 1858, appointed as British Consul for the Black Sea ports, based in Odessa. Complaints about his behaviour became so numerous that an inquiry was ordered by the Foreign Office. The inquiry found that he had granted passports to non-British subjects, he had failed to levy fees that would have been payable to the British government, and he was found guilty of such irregularities in the solemnization of marriages to the extent that it was doubtful whether some of them were not invalid, with any children born out of those marriages being consequently illegitimate. As a result of the inquiry, Murray was dismissed in May 1868. In January 1869 a new newspaper, the Queen's Messenger, appeared and soon displayed a remarkable hostility towards the Foreign Office. In its issue of 17 June 1869, the paper contained a sketch portrait of \"Bob Coachington, Lord Jarvey.\" This was a thinly disguised attack on Lord Carrington and his family, and Carrington sought to find the identity of the perpetrator. Having received information which convinced him that Murray was responsible for whatever appeared in the Queen's Messenger, Lord Carrington sought and found Murray on the steps of the Conservative Club, and there attempted to physically assault him, but it seems that all Carrington succeeded in doing was damaging Murray's hat. Carrington also informed Murray that \"I am Lord Carrington and you know where to find me.\" Murray pressed charges against Lord Carrington, who was summoned before the Marlborough Street Police Court in July 1869 to answer two charges - one of assault, and the other \"for maliciously, unlawfully, wilfully, and wickedly uttering in the hearing of the plaintiff certain provoking, malicious, and scandalous words, with intent to instigate, incite, and provoke him [Murray] to fight a duel with him [Carrington].\" At the end of the hearing, after Carrington had been sent for trial, there occurred a remarkable riot in the court, which was reported in the [Cardiff] 'Western Mail' as follows:- 'The assault upon Mr. Grenville Murray at the Conservative Club by Lord Carington [sic] was enquired into on Wednesday, at the Marlborough-street Police-court ..The following is a description of the \"scene\" which took place in the court at the close of the case. One of the many persons accompanying or in attendance upon Lord Carington - who, by the way, though a very youthful-looking peer, is physically much more than a match for the complainant - was an elderly man, with a japanned tin deed box. This was ultimately the cause of a scene the like of which the magistrate said he had never before witnessed in a court of law. The excite- ment of the case proper was heightened by the incidental allegation that certain papers produced had been literally stolen for the purposes of the defence. As the hearing went on, the gentleman with the box - who turned out to be Mr. Newman, a solicitor, and who clasped the big box with both arms throughout the whole time - kept on supplying Lord Carington's counsel and solicitors with bundles of manuscript, evidently Queen's Messenger \"copy,\" duly labelled as to the dates, etc. After the magistrate had given his decision a rush was made at the box, just as Mr. Newman was returning some of the papers. Cries of \"Police,\" \"Murder,\" and \"Help\" arose. Twenty or thirty men, old and young, clustered around the box, shouting at the top of their voices, and struggling, kicking, and fighting for the prize. Chairs were hurled out of the way, forms overturned, inkstands capsized. The attacking party was at first successful, and the box began to approach the edge of the table. The defenders then waxed frantic, and created terrible din and confusion. Young gentlemen, who had watched the case in lavender kids [gloves] and with unruffled mien, now threw themselves into the melee, and blows, with both fist and stick, were freely exchanged all round. Half-a-dozen police at length hurried in from the outside, and the day was speedily decided against the attackers. The box was safe and sound, but some papers were torn to shreds in the scuffle. The \"row\" did not by any means terminate when this issue was decided. The battle was renewed, apparently to enable the combatants to settle any outstanding accounts, and the fun to the score of spectators who had invaded the magistrate's enclosure, to be out of harm's way and to witness the action was largely added to by the behaviour of half-a-dozen gentlemen who, keeping safely out of the thick of the fight, leaped about from chair to chair screaming gratuitous advice to everybody. This scene lasted ten minutes, and when it was at an end broken furniture, torn coats, and battered hats told of the varying fortunes of the combatants. Lord Carington, who had taken an active share in the strife, was then seen patting various policemen on the back, and congratulating them and his friends generally upon the upshot of the little incident. Several persons were taken into custody and promptly hustled out of the court by the police while the affray was going on, some of them, as was said, without at all deserving the vigorous treatment they met with. The most remarkable point of the whole affair was its impracticability, for apart from the chances of rescue, the size of the box, and the narrow guarded entrances of the court would have rendered it impossible for any one to get off with it. The worthy magistrate had calmly surveyed this extraordinary contempt of court from his chair. The Duke of Beaufort, the Marquis of Worcester, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord Colville, the Marquis Townshend, Marquis of Blandford, Lord Clonmel, Lord George Lennox, Lord Bingham, and other persons of distinction were present.' At his subsequent trial on 23 July 1869, Lord Carrington was found guilty of assault, while the charge of inciting a duel was dropped. Carrington was bound over to keep the peace and fined £100. In the meantime, however, Carrington had caused Murray to be charged with perjury, accusing Murray of lying on oath when Murray stated that he had no connection with the Queen's Messenger, or that he had written the defending article. At Murray's subsequent trial, it was proved that the registered proprietor of the Queen's Messenger was Murray's son, and that the draft of the offending article was in Murray's handwriting. Before his trial could be completed, however, Murray fled to the Continent, where he remained in exile for the remainder of his life before dying in Paris in December 1881. The special remainder to the Barony of Carteret created in 1784 From the \"London Gazette\" of 27 January 1784 (issue 12514, page 3):- 'The King has been pleased to grant to the Right Honourable Henry Frederick Carteret, and the Heirs Male of His Body lawfully begotten, the Dignity of a Baron of the Kingdom of Great Britain, by the Name, Stile and Title of Baron Carteret, of Hawnes, in the County of Bedford, with Remainders to the Honourable George Thynne, Second Son, the Honourable John Thynne, Third Son and the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and every other Son and Sons severally and success- ively, of the Right Honourable Thomas Lord Viscount Weymouth, and the respective Heirs Male of their Bodies lawfully begotten.' Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassillis The 4th Earl of Cassillis is remembered in Scottish history for his abduction and torture of Allan Stewart, Commendator of the Cluniac Abbey at Crossraguel, in Carrick [the modern South Ayrshire] in Scotland. The Earl wished to appropriate some of the lands, together with the income arising therefrom, surrounding the Abbey. In order to achieve this, he tricked Stewart into accompanying him to Dunure Castle, the home of the Kennedy family, where he was tortured by being roasted over a brazier in the 'Black Vault' of the castle. Eventually, Stewart submitted to the Earl's demands and signed the lands in question over to the Earl. He was finally rescued by the intervention of his brother-in-law, but his feet had been so burnt that he was never able to walk again. A good summary of Allan Stewart's ordeal is included in the Wikipedia article on \"Dunure Castle.\" After his rescue, Stewart made a complaint to the Privy Council of Scotland. The following is taken from 'The North British Review' of February 1845. I have retained the original spelling, adding explanations where necessary:- 'The manuscript records of the [Scottish] Privy Council, of 20th June, 1571, bear, that he [Allan Stewart] presented a complaint against Gilbert Earl of Cassilis, Thomas Master of Cassilis, his brother, \"and their complices,\" to the effect, that \"being on 30th August 1570, within the wood of Corsraguell, doing my lawful errands and business, believing noe harm nor invasion to have bein done to me by ainie persons,\" nevertheless the said Earl and sixteen others \"came to me, and ther persuaded me, be their flatterie and deceitfull words, to pass with him to his castle, and he putting me within the same, that I should be in such firmance, commanded six of his servants to wait upon me, so that I escaped not, and took from me my hors and all my weapons, and then depairted, until the 1st September thereafter, when he came again, and required me to subscribe to him, ane feu-charter [a document establishing a form of land tenure] made in parchment, of the baill lands pertaining to the abbacie; togidder with ain nineteen and five years talk of the teynds, which I niver read one word of, and answered that it was a thing most unreasonable, and I could noway.\" The Earl, however, \"after long boasting and menacing of me, caused me to be caryed to ane houss, callit the Black Vault of Denbie, wher the tormentors denuded me of all my claiths perforce, except onlie my sark [shirt] and doublet [jacket], and they band baith my hands at the shackle bane, with ane cord, as they did baith my feet; and band my soalls betwixt ane iron chimney and a fire; and being bound soe thairto, I could noway steir or move: whilk [which] being done, they set the same chimney upoe a great fire, whilk was ther readie prepaired for my tormenting, so that I micht not steir, but had almost inluked through my cruell burning.\" This regimen proved effectual. \"Seeing noe other appearance to me, but aither to condescend to his desyr, or else to continue in that torment, I said I would obey to his desyr; howbeit it was soir against my will.\" He then signed the deeds. \"Whilk being done, the said Earle caused the said tormentors of me, to swear upon the Bible, niver to reveal a word of this my unmerciful hand-dealing.\" This was not enough. The Earl afterwards \"requyred me to ratifie and approve the same, befor a notar and witnesses, whilk I utterly refused, and thairfoir he as off befoir, band and putt me to the same manner of tormenting; and being in soe grait pain, as I trust nevir man was in the like with his life's self, when I cryed 'Fye upon me, will ye no ding whingers [daggers] in me, and putt me out of this world, or else putt ore barrell of powder under me, rayther than to be demayned and tormented in this unmercifull maner.' The said Earl hearing ane cry, baidd his servant putt ane stopper in my throat, whilk be obeyed.\" But the tortured wretch had firmness not to yield. He goes on to narrate, that \"their seeing I was in danger of my life, my flesh consumed, and brunt to the bane, and that I would not condescend to his purposs, I was relieved. Further, the said Earl, without any title of right, has taiken up my haill leving at Crossraguel, taking noe fear of our Sovereign Lordis letters, or chairgis usit in his name, even as he wer ane eximed persone, not subject to the lawes, but might doe all things at his pleasure.\" Notwithstanding Stewart's complaint to the Privy Council, it appears that little action was taken against the Earl following this incident. The special remainder to the Barony of Castle Coote created in 1800 From the \"London Gazette\" of 2 August 1800 (issue 15281, page 889):- 'His Majesty hath been pleased to grant the following Dignities, and Letters Patent are preparing to be passed under the Great Seal of this Kingdom accordingly, viz....to Charles Henry Earl of Mountrath, the Dignity of Baron of Castle Coote, in the County of Roscommon, and the Heirs Male of his Body; and in Default of such Issue, to Charles Henry Coote, Esq; of Forest Lodge, in the Queen's County and to his Heirs Male.' Mervyn Tuchet, 12th Baron Audley and 2nd Earl of Castlehaven Before 1617, Tuchet had married Elizabeth Barnham, who died young, but not before producing six children. Elizabeth's sister Alice was the wife of Sir Francis Bacon. Tuchet's second wife was Lady Ann Stanley, daughter of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby. Ann, a famous beauty, had previously been married to Grey Bridges, 5th Baron Chandos. Five children were born from this marriage, including Elizabeth Brydges, of whom more later. According to the will of Henry VIII and the Succession to the Crown Act of 1543, commonly known as the Third Succession Act, Ann was heir presumptive to the throne of England upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. For a detailed discussion of this subject, the reader is referred to a website compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner to be found at - http://www.wargs.com/essays/succession/castlehaven.html Notwithstanding Ann's claim to the throne, on the death of Elizabeth I, she was passed over in favour of King James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England. James was the senior male descendant of Margaret Tudor, older sister of Henry VIII. Whatever the merits of Ann's claim, she married Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven on 22 July 1624. On their wedding night, Lady Ann was surprised when Castlehaven's manservant, Anthill, appeared suddenly at the bedside. In Ann's words, \"Anthill came to our bed, and the Lord Audley talked lasciviously to me and told me that my body was his and that if I lay with his wife to decide which, between him and Skipwith, was the better endowed. \"He took delight in calling up his servants to show their nudities and forced me to look upon them and commend those that had the longest.\" If Lady Ann demurred, force was employed. When Giles Broadway (or Browning), the butler, came to her bed, Lord Audley held her firmly by the hands and feet. \"He delighted to see the act done, and made Broadway lie with me in such a way that he might see it, and though I cried out, he never regarded the complaint I made but encouraged the ravisher.\" At Lord Audley's subsequent trial, Broadway told the court that, after he had taken Lady Ann, he was in turn sodomized by his lordship, as was Fitzpatrick, a cook. The court was then told that Lady Ann was not the only ill-treated woman in the family. Lady Ann's daughter, Elizabeth, testified that she had been forced to submit to Skipwith, the groom. \"He used oyl to enter my body first for I was then but twelve years old and he usually lay with me by the Baron's privity and command.\" Elizabeth was later forced to marry Skipwith. It was Lord Audley's son, James, who eventually informed on his father, due to his fear that his father intended to disinherit him. Charged with a capital offence before a jury of his peers, Audley admitted that a servant might occasionally have shared his bed, but only because of the shortage of rooms in his various houses. The court declined to accept this defence and Audley was attainted of felony, sentenced to death and beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 May 1631. Broadway and Fitzpatrick were also executed. There seems to be little doubt that Audley's death was brought about by Lady Ann's manipulations. Fitzpatrick testified that she was \"the wickedest woman in the world, and had more to answer for than any woman that lived.\" For further reading on this case, the reader is referred to \"A House in Gross Disorder; Sex, Law and the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven\" by Cynthia B. Herrup (Oxford University Press, 1999). Herrup also makes it clear that Lady Ann was the equal of her husband in immorality. After Audley's death, Elizabeth, having got rid of Skipwith, married James, Audley's heir and nemesis. Because he had been attainted, his English peerage, being descendible to heirs general, was forfeited, but the Irish Earldom and Barony, being in tail, were not affected. This was because the peerages in tail were protected by the statute 'De Donis Conditionalibus' contained in the second Statute of Westminster (1285) which preserved all entailed honours against forfeiture for felony. A similar situation arose in 1760 when Earl Ferrers was executed without any effect upon the descent of his peerages. The following edited account of Audley's trial is taken from \"A Critical Review of the State Trials\" [London 1735]:- 'The Trial of Mervin Lord Audley, Earl of Castlehaven, for a Rape and Sodomy, before the Lord Keeper Coventry, Lord High Steward, and the rest of the Peers commissioned to try him, 25 April 1631. 7 Car. I. 'Three Indictments had been found against this Lord by the Grand Jury at the preceding Lent Assizes for Wiltshire. The first for a Rape of his own Wife, whom he held by Force, while one of his Servants lay with her: And the other two Indictments were for Buggery with a Man. Before the Trial, the Judges came to the following Resolutions, on certain Queries, sent them by the Lord High Steward: 1. That a Peer could not be tried by a common Jury, but must be tried by his Peers. 2. That a Peer could not challenge any of his Peers. 3. That a Peer could not have Counsel, but on Points of Law. 4. That his own Examinations taken without Oath, might be read against him; but the Examinations of others must be upon Oath. 5. That the Wife, in case of a Rape, being the Party wronged, may be Evidence against her Husband. 6. That where one stood mute in a Rape he might have his Clergy; but not in Buggery. 7. That to denominate the Offence a Rape, there must be Penetration. 8. That the Lords Triers might eat and drink before they agreed; but could not separate, or adjourn, till they gave their Verdict. 9. That a Peer could not be convicted by less than twelve Peers. 10. That if a Prisoner stood mute in an Appeal, he must be hanged; for that it was an Attainder. 11. That a Peer standing mute in an Indictment, might be pressed to Death. 12. That the Lord High Steward, after a Verdict, might take Time to advise upon a Point of Law; and his Office continued until Judgment given. 'It was resolved also, That if a Woman was a Whore, she might however be ravished: But it was a good Plea for the Man, that she was his Concubine. And that, if a Man took a Maid by Force, and ravished her, and she afterwards gave her Consent, and married him, this would not purge the Offence, but it was still a Rape. 'The said several Indictments being certified, and brought into Court, and the Prisoner commanded to the Bar, the Evidence was produced: And first, the Examination of the Lady Audley, as to the Rape, who deposed, that her Lord (the Prisoner) called his servant Brodway, into his Bed while she was asleep: That she waked, and made all the Resistance she could; but his Lordship held both her Hands, and one of her Legs, till Brodway lay with her: That, as soon as she got from him, she would have killed herself with a Knife, and that Brodway forced it from her. Brodway's Examination also was read, who confessed, that his Lordship called him into his Bed, and bid him lie with his Lady; and, that he did lie with her, whilst his Lord held one of her Legs and both her hands. 'As to the Sodomy, Brodway deposed, That the Earl used his Body as the Body of a Woman; but never pierced it, only emitted between his Thighs. 'Fitz-Patrick, another Servant, deposed, That his Lord had twice committed Sodomy with him (the Deponent); That Henry Skipwith, another Servant, had lain with the Lady Audley, by his Lord's Command, and in his Presence: But the Lady, in her Examination, says, she cried out, and that Skipwith did not lie with her. 'The Lady Audley also deposed, That the first or second Night after she was married, her Lord called Ampthill (who had been his Page, and to whom he had married his Daughter) to his Bedside, and said, Now her body was his, and, if she loved him, she must love Ampthill: That he made Skipwith come naked into his Chamber; and delighted to call in his Men-servants, and shew her their Nudities, recommending the largest to her. 'Skipwith also deposed, That his Lord made him lie with the young Lady Audley, his Son's Wife, who was then but twelve Years of Age: That he could not enter her at first, and the Lord Audley fetched Oil to open her Body, but she cried out, and he could not enter her yet; then his Lord ordered Oil to be brought a second Time, and the Deponent entered her. 'The young Lady also deposed, That the Lord Audley saw Skipwith lie with her several Times; and, that nine Servants of the Family also had seen it: That she had no other Maintenance than what she had from Skipwith; and that, among other Arguments the Prisoner used to make her lie with Skipwith, he told her her Husband did not love her; and threatened to turn her out of Doors, if she would not: Adding, that he would tell her Husband she did, if she did not; and confirmed the Circumstance, of their using Oil to penetrate her Body. 'Fitz-Patrick also deposed, That his Lordship kept a Whore in the House; and, that he made four or five of his Servants lie with her in his Presence; and his Lordship lay with her in their Sight. 'The Judges' Opinion being demanded on some Parts of the Evidence, resolved, That it was Buggery within the Statute, where the Body is used so far as to emit thereon, without Penet- ration: And so, where there was an Emission upon a Woman's Belly, it ought to be adjudged a Rape: And that in a Rape a Woman is not limited to any Time to make her Complaint, if the Process be by Indictment; but in an Appeal she is. 'The Lord Audley, in his Defence, said, That his Wife's Testimony ought not to be regarded, since she had confessed her lying with Brodway. To which it was answered, he could not urge that Fact in his Defence, since he had forced her to suffer it. Then he said, that his Wife and his Servants were not competent Witnesses; and that they were put upon practicing against him by his Son, who fought his Life: Adding, That his Wife had been false to his Bed, and had a Child in his Absence; and then made Protestations of his Innocence. But Woe to that Man (he said) whose Wife and Servants should be admitted Witnesses against him, and whose Son conspired his Death! His Son was now come of Age, and wanted his Lands, and his Wife a young Husband, now he was grown old, and had therefore plotted his Destruction. 'The Lords Triers having been withdrawn some Time, returned, and were unanimous in their Opinion, that the Prisoner was GUILTY of the Rape: But as to the Sodomy, eleven of his Peers were of Opinion, that he was NOT GUILTY, and sixteen declared him GUILTY; which Difference of Opinion seems to have arisen from the Evidence that Brodway gave, that the Lord emitted between his Thighs, but never penetrated him. 'Judgment was afterwards passed upon the Prisoner, that he should be hanged: However he obtained the Favour of being [be]headed; when he professed himself perfectly innocent of the Crimes he was charged with. 'The Lord Audley's two Servants, Lawrence Fitz-Patrick and Giles Brodway, were brought to their Trials, the first for Sodomy, and the other for a Rape, June 27, 1631; when Fitz-Patrick's Confession was produced against him, as Evidence of his having committed Sodomy with his Lord; and the Jury desired to be informed, if the Person who suffered the Buggery to be committed upon him, could be said to commit Buggery, as the Words of the Statute were. To which the Lord Chief Justice answered, That every Accessory to a Felony, was a Felon in Law: And the Prisoner voluntarily prostituting his Body, when he was not only of Understanding and Years, to know the Heinousness of the Offence, but of Strength to resist his Lord, he was guilty of Buggery. The Prisoner in his Defence insisted, That the Evidence he had given for the King, at his Lord's Trial, ought not to be produced against him at a Trial for the same Fact: But the Court answered, it might; and that it was sufficient to convict him: Whereupon the Jury found him GUILTY. 'At Brodway's Trial the Lady Audley appeared in Court, and gave the same Evidence of the Prisoner's committing a Rape upon her, while her Husband held her, as she had done at her Lord's Trial: And the Court demanding, whether the Prisoner entered her Body, when he forced her, she answered, He did; and she intended to have expressed as much at the Lord Audley's Trial: And Brodway having confessed as much before, the Jury found him guilty; and they were both [Broadway and Fitzpatrick] hanged, confessing the Facts at their Executions.'"
