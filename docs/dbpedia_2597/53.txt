Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur of Sark (18 February 1584 – 22 August 1643) was the son of Philippe de Carteret I (1552–1594) and Rachel Paulett (1564–1650), daughter of George Paulett (1534–1621) who was Bailiff of Jersey from 1583 to 1611, and his wife Elizabeth Perrin (1538–1615).

He matriculated at the University of Oxford at an early age in 1594, the same year he succeeded his father as Seigneur of Sark. He was knighted in 1617, and became Bailiff of Jersey in 1627. He died in 1643, being succeeded in the Seigneurie by his son, Philippe 4th Seigneur of Sark.

Carteret was a stanch Royalist during the English Civil War, especially during the Interregnum. As Lieutenant Governor of the island of Jersey he would ensure the loyalty of the population to Charles II and crack down on parliamentary sentiment from the fortress of Mont Orgueil.[1]

When Charles II came to Jersey Philip Carteret along with his cousin George Carteret were his escorts.[2]
