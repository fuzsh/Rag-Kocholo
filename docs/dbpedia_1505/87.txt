ROPER, Daniel C. (1867-1943).

This South Carolina attorney and legislator served as the fifth Secretary of Commerce under Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-38), in which capacity he proved critical to implementing FDR's "New Deal"; in 1939 he served as U.S. ambassador to Canada. Item #41871

Bold signature in ink on a stiff 3" X 1Â½" card with "Secretary of Commerce' typed below the signature. Very good. Quite faint paper clip imprint. Original Department of Commerce transmittal envelope, cancelled on 1 February 1936, also present. A choice example from the height of his fame.
