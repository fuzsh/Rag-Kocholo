Wells v. Roper

No. 103

Argued January 2, 1918

Decided March 18, 1918

246 U.S. 335

Syllabus

The First Assistant Postmaster General, in accordance with a decision of the Postmaster General, undertook to terminate an existing contract for automobile mail service at Washington, D.C., to make place for a similar service to be conducted by the Department under a special appropriation, his action being based upon the supposed authority of the contract itself and being purely official, discretionary, and within the scope of his duties. Held that a suit to restrain him from annulling the contract and from interfering with its further performance was in effect a suit against the United States, and was therefore properly dismissed.

44 App.D.C. 276 affirmed.

The case is stated in the opinion.
