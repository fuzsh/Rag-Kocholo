The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in Room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable Robert C. Scott (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Scott, Johnson, Jackson Lee, Davis, Forbes, Gohmert, Coble and Lungren. Also present: Representatives Conyers, Ellison and Jones of North Carolina. Staff Present: Bobby Vassar, Subcommittee Chief Counsel; Rachel King, Majority Counsel; Veronica Eligan, Professional Staff Member; Michael Volkov, Minority Counsel; Caroline Lynch, Minority Counsel; and Kelsey Whitlock, Minority Staff Assistant. Mr. Scott. Thank you. I would like to call the meeting of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security to order. We have many excellent witnesses today. We will get to them as soon as possible, so I will keep my statement brief. But in the meanwhile we have the gentleman from North Carolina, Walter Jones, with us today who wanted to drop in. He is in the middle of another hearing and has to leave, but he wanted to greet us. Mr. Jones. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and the Judiciary Committee Chairman, Mr. Conyers, for holding this hearing. And the reason that I am here and my involvement is that for the last--since August of last year I have joined many of my colleagues in the United States Congress who have been concerned about the indictment of Border Agents Ramos and Compean and feel that they should never have been brought to trial. So therefore I hope that this hearing today will bring many, many sunshine to many aspects of the law itself, as well as the fact that these men, in our opinion, should not have been prosecuted by the Federal D.A. In west Texas. And thank you for letting me say thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. And thank you for being with us today. One of the motivations for today's hearing, as has just been stated, is the conviction and sentencing of the two Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Compean, who were sentenced to 11 years and 1 day and 12 years of incarceration respectively. Regardless of what you think of these two agents or whether they were rightfully prosecuted, the fact remains that the U.S. District court was restrained when it came to sentencing the two men. The judge had to sentence them to at least 10-year minimum sentences. Mandatory minimum sentences have been studied extensively and have been shown to be ineffective in preventing crime. They have been effective in distorting the sentencing process. They discriminate against minorities in their application, and they have been shown to waste the taxpayers' money. In a study, a report entitled, quote, Mandatory Minimum Drug Sentences: Throwing Away the Key or the Taxpayers' Money, the RAND Corporation concluded that mandatory minimum sentences were less effective than either discretionary sentencing or drug treatment in reducing drug-related crime and far more costly than either. And the Judicial Conference of the United States has reiterated its opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over a dozen times to this Congress, and noting that they severely distort and damage the Federal sentencing system, undermine the sentencing guideline regiment established by Congress to promote fairness and proportionality, and destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging charge and fact plea bargains. The Judicial Center, in its report entitled General Effects of Mandatory Minimum Prison Terms: A Longitudinal Study of Federal Sentences Imposed, and the Sentencing Commission, United States Sentencing Commission, in its study entitled Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System, found that minorities were substantially more likely than Whites under comparable circumstances to receive mandatory minimum sentences. The Sentencing Commission also reflected that mandatory minimum sentences increased the disparity in sentencing of like defendants because they were not applied in 40 percent of the cases, and at the same time increased the cost as a result of the rate of trials rising from 13 percent of the defendants to 19 percent of the defendants with no evidence that mandatory minimum sentencing had more crime reduction impact than discretionary sentences. Former Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke often and loudly about these wasteful cost increases, and he said mandatory minimums are perhaps a good example of the law of unintended consequences. There is a respectable body of opinion which believes that these mandatory minimums impose unduly harsh punishment for first-time offenders, particularly for mules who played only a minor role in drug distribution in a drug distribution scheme. Be that as it may, the mandatory minimums have also led to an inordinate increase in the prison population and will require huge expenditures to build new prison space. He went on to say that mandatory minimums are frequently the result of floor amendments to demonstrate emphatically that legislators want to get tough on crime just as frequently as they do not involve any careful consideration of the effect they might have on the sentencing guidelines as a whole. The Federal Judicial Conference has studied mandatory minimums and has written the House Judiciary Committee over a dozen times in the last 10 years urging us not to adopt the mandatory minimum sentences, stating that they distort attempts to enforce an orderly and proportionate sentencing regimen in the Federal system, and they violate common sense by requiring vastly different defendants to get identical sentences simply because they technically violated the same section of the criminal code. And we know that the title of the offense often is not a good description of the seriousness of the crime. It also creates a bizarre situation where the decision of when to release a defendant is made not at a parole hearing just before the person is released and you can review the sentence, what he has done to better himself, where he is going to go and what he is going to do. It is not even made at the sentencing where the judge makes a decision based on the seriousness of the crime and the particular defendant before him and all the facts in evidence in that case. But it is made when the legislature passes the criminal code. That is of the three opportunities, I guess, about the worst time to make that decision. With that thought I would lead to my distinguished colleague, my colleague from Virginia, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Forbes from the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia. Mr. Forbes. Thank you, Chairman Scott. And I appreciate your scheduling this hearing so that we can fairly assess the importance of mandatory minimum sentences in the criminal justice system. Mandatory minimum penalties are an effective means to ensure consistency in sentencing and to promote the public safety by deterring others from committing crimes and preventing recidivism. The need for mandatory minimum penalties has taken on a greater significance given the advisory nature of the Federal sentencing guidelines. The Supreme Court's 2005 decision in United States v. Booker invalidated the mandatory sentencing requirement of the sentencing guidelines. The U.S. Sentencing Commission's March 13, 2006, report on Booker's impact identified substantial concerns about unrestrained judicial discretion. Such discretion undermines the very purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act to provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing and avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct. The Sentencing Commission's data updated through the second quarter of 2007 shows continuing sentencing disparities, including a steady rate of nongovernment-sponsored below- guideline sentences for defendants; geographic disparities among the judicial circuits; and sentencing reductions in a significant number of drug-trafficking cases, immigration cases, firearms offenses, pornography and prostitution offenses and white collar. Advisory sentencing guidelines that result in lower penalties for the worst offenders only increase the significance of mandatory minimum sentences. Beginning in 1984, Democrat Congresses passed important mandatory minimums, along with other sentencing reforms, including the Federal sentencing guidelines. Prior to the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act, Federal judges had unfettered discretion to sentence a criminal defendant as they pleased. This unbridled discretion resulted in enormous disparity in sentences for similarly situated defendants. Senator Kennedy, one of the principal advocates of the Federal sentencing guidelines, stated that the existing sentencing disparity was a national scandal. He noted that the Federal Criminal Code invites disparity by conferring unlimited discretion on the sentencing judge. The shameful disparity in criminal sentences imposed in the Federal courts is a major flaw which encourages the potential criminal to play the odds and beat the sentence. Sentencing disparity is unfair. Aside from ensuring consistency in sentencing, mandatory minimum penalties provide prosecutors the tools to secure the cooperation of criminals to dismantle criminal enterprises, gangs and other organizations. Without such a penalty, for example, gang members will not cooperate with law enforcement. They will simply turn their back on cooperation, do the time, and gang violence will continue to expand and threaten our communities. While some complain about mandatory sentencing schemes there is research to show that such penalties have been a significant factor in the reduction of violent crime over the last 30 years. Some would say that is coincidence. Statistical researchers have shown to the contrary. Increases in prison population have incapacitated recidivists and deterred others from committing crime. Professor Steven Levitt conducted a study to show that a significant part of the decline in violent crime is attributable to increased incarceration. In a more recent study, Joanna Shepherd demonstrated that truth-in- sentencing laws have a dramatic impact on reducing serious violent crimes. Other studies confirmed the obvious point. Incarcerating an offender prevents him from repeating his crimes while he is in prison. Balanced against these reductions in crime from deterrence and incapacity, there is significant cost savings to society from reducing the occurrence of crime. Mandatory minimum penalties, however, need to be specifically tailored and fairly applied. The Sentencing Commission's recent study on the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine demonstrated again the need for reform in this area. And I commend the Commission for its study and look forward to hearing more about it and possible solutions. I am also glad that we are taking the time to examine the Government's prosecution of the Border Patrol agents' case. The controversy surrounded this prosecution is significant. I have many questions and concerns about the manner in which the Government conducted this prosecution. To me the question is not the penalties that were imposed in that case, but rather whether the case should have been brought at all. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Do any of the other panelists have a statement? Mr. Conyers. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Scott. I recognize the Chairman of the full Committee Mr. Conyers. Mr. Conyers. Thank you so much. I want to commend you and the Ranking Member, both from Virginia, for bringing us together and to bring such a distinguished set of panelists. We don't usually have two judges, a U.S. attorney and a future attorney all with us at the same time. Marc Mauer is well known in his work here. He has been before the Committee perhaps more than anyone else. This is a-- of all cases, I can't understand--we could have a hearing on this case, and I know it is on appeal, but there are circumstances in it that are so incredible that I find it breathtaking. I suppose the main reason we are here is because we have been trying to get mandatory minimum sentences in some kind of a different position, and so I just can't fathom why Border Patrol agents working for the Government, doing their job, end up being charged and prosecuted under a law that to me seems to be very inspecific. And, of course, the case is under appeal. But since it is before us, I think that it is something that we really have to deal with. I find that mandatory sentences--and I join both the Chairman and the Subcommittee Ranking Member--that during mandatory minimums we have witnessed a fivefold increase in the number of women currently entangled in our criminal justice system as a result of their minimal involvement in some drug- related crime. In two States we have almost 20 percent of the people incarcerated are serving mandatory minimum terms. We are incarcerating people at a rate higher than any other Nation on the planet. And so this brings together some very important considerations. I want to thank our colleague from North Carolina, Congressman Jones, for having brought this matter to the attention of the Committee. Walter Jones has been unrelenting in his support for hearings in this Committee. He is chairing another meeting, and he will be back shortly, I'm sure. And so I thank the Committee for allowing me to welcome all of the witnesses and ask unanimous consent that my remarks be included in the record. Mr. Scott. Thank you. We have a distinguished panel of witnesses here to help us consider the important issues before us. And we have been joined by the gentleman from Georgia Mr. Johnson. I thank you. Our first witness will be the Honorable Ricardo H. Hinojosa, Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission since 2003 and judge of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas since 1983. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School. And before becoming appointed judge, he was in private practice in McAllen, Texas. Our second witness is the Honorable Paul C. Cassell, judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah since May 2002. He is a graduate of Stanford Law School. Prior to that he was a professor at the Utah College of Law where he worked in many cases, and particularly well known for his work with the National Victims Constitutional Amendment Network. Our next witness is Richard B. Roper, III, U.S. District Attorney, Northern District of Texas. In Dallas, Texas, he served as the assistant U.S. attorney since 1987 until he was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney on June 29, 2004. Prior to that he served as the Tarrant County assistant district attorney for 5 years. He received his law degree from Texas Tech. Our fourth witness is Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit organization engaged in research and advocacy on criminal justice issues. He has been engaged in this work for 30 years and has authored two books and many journal articles on various aspects of crime policy. He received his B.A. From the State University of New York in Stony Brook, and has a master's in social work from the University of Michigan. Next is T.J. Bonner, who is the national president of the National Border Patrol Council of the American Federation of Government Employees of the AFL-CIO. He represents the concerns of approximately 11,000 front-line Border Patrol employees. And lastly we have Serena Nunn. She served more than a decade in Federal prison for her participation as a low-level nonviolent conspirator in a cocaine sale organized by her boyfriend. Her case received attention in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, which featured her in an article about mandatory minimum sentencing. A young lawyer brought her case to the attention of President Clinton, who commuted her sentence on July 7, 2000. After being released from prison after more than a decade, she has finished her bachelor's degree at Arizona State University and then was accepted at the University of Michigan Law School, from which she graduated last year. Each of the witnesses' written statements will be made part of the record in its entirety. I would ask that each witness summarize his or her testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help stay within that time, there is a timing device at your table. When 1 minute is left, the light will switch from green to yellow and then finally to red when your 5 minutes are up. We will now begin with our witnesses. Judge Hinojosa. TESTIMONY OF RICARDO H. HINOJOSA, CHAIR, UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION, WASHINGTON, DC Judge Hinojosa. Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on behalf of the United States Sentencing Commission regarding mandatory minimum sentencings generally and Federal cocaine sentencing policy specifically. My written testimony provides information on Federal statutory mandatory minimum sentencing compiled from the Commission's fiscal year 2006 data file. My testimony does not focus on any particular case. The Commission does not generally comment on individual cases, particularly when pending appeal. The Commission firmly believes that the sentencing guideline system remains the best mechanism for assuring that the statutory purposes of sentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) are met, and it has worked consistently with Congress to identify alternatives within the guideline system in lieu of mandatory minimums. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 specifically directed the Commission to develop guidelines that would achieve those statutory purposes. And as the Supreme Court last week recognized in Rita v. United States, `the result is a set of guidelines that seek to embody the Section 3553(a) considerations both in principle and in practice.'' The Commission identified at least 171 mandatory minimum provisions in Federal criminal statutes. In fiscal year 2006, of the 60,627 Federal offenders for which the Commission received sufficient documentation to conduct this analysis, 20,737 offenders or 29.8 percent, were convicted of a statute carrying a mandatory minimum penalty. Of the 33,636 counts of conviction that carried a mandatory minimum, 94.4 percent were for drug offenses and firearms offenses. Offenders other than Whites comprise 74.0 percent of offenders convicted of a statutory mandatory minimum penalty compared to 70.9 percent of those offenders in the overall offender population. Black offenders were the only racial or ethnic group that comprised a greater percentage of offenders convicted of a statutory mandatory minimum penalty, which was 32.9 percent, than the percentage in the overall offender population, which was 23.8 percent. To gauge the demographic impact of mandatory minimums, however, it proved helpful to extract the Federal immigration caseload from the analysis. Immigration offenders comprise 23.8 percent of offenders in the overall caseload, but only 0.8 percent of the offenders convicted of a statute carrying a mandatory minimum sentence. The demographic data excluding immigration cases shows that Hispanic offenders comprise 38.1 percent of the nonimmigration offenders convicted of a statutory mandatory minimum penalty, but 29.7 percent of the overall offender population. And Black offenders comprise 33 percent of the nonimmigration offenders convicted of a statutory mandatory minimum penalty, but 29.8 percent of the overall offender population. Many offenders convicted of a statute carrying a mandatory minimum are being sentenced without regard to and below the mandatory minimum because of a substantial assistance provision under 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) and, for drug offenders, because of the substantial assistance provision and/or the safety valve provision under 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(f). Of the 18,987 mandatory minimum offenders for whom the Commission had sufficient information for the analysis, 13.6 percent, or 2,591 offenders, were sentenced without regard to and below the mandatory minimum because of the statutory substantial assistance provision. Of the 16,334 drug mandatory minimum offenders for whom the Commission had sufficient information for the analysis, 7,812 offenders, or 47.8 percent, were sentenced without regard to and below the mandatory minimum because of the substantial assistance provision and/or the safety valve provision; 84.2 percent of the offenders convicted of statutes carrying a mandatory minimum sentence were drug offenders. The impact of drug mandatory minimum penalties on Black offenders is largely driven by crack cocaine offenses. Black offenders comprise 32 percent of offenders convicted of drug mandatory minimum statutes, but 29.2 percent of the overall drug offender population. If crack cocaine cases are excluded from the analysis, Black offenders comprise 14.4 percent of the remaining drug cases in which a drug mandatory minimum applied and 14.8 percent of the remaining drug cases overall. I would like to address briefly the issue of Federal cocaine sentencing policy. This past year the Commission undertook an extensive review of the issues associated with Federal cocaine sentencing policy. The Commission received public comment showing almost universal criticism of current cocaine sentencing policy. The Commission's efforts culminated in the issuance of its fourth report to Congress on the subject in which the Commission again unanimously and strongly urged Congress to act promptly to address the problem of unwarranted crack cocaine sentencing disparity. On May 1, the Commission submitted to Congress an amendment to the drug trafficking guideline that would reduce the base offense level for all crack cocaine offenders by two levels. The Commission firmly believes this is only a partial remedy and that a comprehensive solution to the problem of Federal cocaine sentencing policy must be legislated by Congress. The Commission stands ready to work with Congress as it continues to study the issues of mandatory minimums and Federal cocaine sentencing policy. The Commission is committed to working with Congress to maintain a just and effective national sentencing policy in a manner that preserves the bipartisan principles of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Thank you for the opportunity to testify so quickly before you today. I look forward to answering your questions, and I appreciate your letting me have a little bit of extra time, but that is about the fastest I have ever talked. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Judge. [The prepared statement of Judge Hinojosa follows:] Prepared Statement of Ricardo H. Hinojosa [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Scott. Judge Cassell. TESTIMONY OF PAUL G. CASSELL, JUDGE, JUDICIAL CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, DC Judge Cassell. Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to be here today to explain the Judicial Conference's long-standing opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing schemes. The Judicial Conference opposes mandatory minimum sentences because they block judges from considering the individual circumstances of particular cases. Mandatory minimum sentencing schemes create a one-size-fits-all system that requires Federal judges to ignore individual differences in particular cases. Testimony in today's hearing illustrates the wide range of cases that come before Federal judges. You will hear testimony from Ms. Serena Nunn, a first-time offender who was a minor participant in a drug distribution scheme organized by her boyfriend. You will hear a representative from the Border Patrol Union talking about Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, convicted of discharging a firearm while arresting a drug smuggler on the Texas border. And I will talk about Mr. Weldon Angelos, a record producer from Utah who carried a firearm to several marijuana deals. Obviously these are different cases that require different approaches. They require something other than a cookie-cutter approach to justice. But mandatory minimum sentences force judges to treat cases such as these as essentially indistinguishable. When Federal judges are forced to follow mandatory minimum sentencing schemes, truly bizarre sentences result, which can seriously undermine public confidence in the system. In my written testimony I talk at length about the 55-year prison sentence I was required to hand down to Mr. Weldon Angelos. His crimes were possessing a firearm during several drug deals, and he certainly deserved to be punished for that. But it made no sense for me to give a sentence to him that was far longer than he would have received for such heinous crimes as aircraft hijacking, terrorist bombing, second degree murder, espionage, kidnapping, aggravated assault, sexual assault on a child and rape. These are not just hypothetical illustrations. The same day that I sentenced Mr. Angelos to 55 years in prison, I also had before me Mr. Cruz Visinaiz. He was convicted of murder for beating Clara Jenkins, a 68-year-old woman, repeatedly over the head with a log. I gave Mr. Visinaiz the maximum sentence recommended by the guidelines, 22 years in prison. It was hard for me then and remains hard for me to this day to explain to Ms. Jenkins' family and to members of the public why that murderer received a far shorter sentence than a drug dealer who simply carried a firearm to several drug deals. Unfortunately the implicit message to crime victims with such bizarre sentences is that their suffering does not count for as much as the abstract war on drugs. The public, too, will wonder about whether their hard- earned tax dollars are well spent to imprison Mr. Angelos for essentially the rest of his life. The cost will be in the neighborhood of $1.3 million, and probably much more, as the taxpayers will be required to subsidize his geriatric medical treatment in prison. Every empirical study with which I am familiar strongly suggests that the taxpayers will get far more bang for their buck by not imprisoning Mr. Angelos while he is a senior citizen and using the money saved to put additional law enforcement officers on the street or extra prosecutors into the Department of Justice. Because of problems like these, the public favors allowing judges to make the final decision about what sentence should ultimately be imposed. A recent poll shows that three-quarters of all Americans support allowing judges to set aside mandatory sentences if another sentence would be, in their judgment, more appropriate. On behalf of the Judicial Conference, I urge the Subcommittee to start the legislative process to eliminate inflexible mandatory minimum sentencing schemes. A good place to start would be by unstacking the 924(c) mandatory minimums that produced the irrational 55-year sentence for Mr. Angelos, that I have just discussed, as well as the 159-year sentence for Marian Hungerford, plus we shouldn't forget 3 years of supervised release after that, that I review in my testimony. A more general solution would be to allow judges to go below mandatory minimum sentences whenever the sentencing guidelines advise a lower sentence. The guidelines represent the considered judgment of a congressionally created agency, the Sentencing Commission, about what sentence is usually appropriate and could serve as a signal that a lower sentence is necessary in a particular case. No doubt there are other solutions that are possible as well, but in closing I urge the Subcommittee to pass something that will allow Federal judges to impose fair and appropriate sentences in each individual case. Unfortunately mandatory minimum sentences require Federal judges to ignore obvious differences in the cases that come before them, to impose absurdly long sentences that lack any connection to a logical system of punishment, and to waste taxpayer dollars by incarcerating offenders for decades when the money could be better spent to fight crime elsewhere. I urge this Subcommittee to start the process which will end mandatory minimum injustices. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Scott. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Judge Cassell follows:] Prepared Statement of Paul G. Cassell [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Scott. Mr. Roper. TESTIMONY OF RICHARD B. ROPER, III, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, DALLAS, TX Mr. Roper. Good morning, Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Forbes. It is an honor to appear before this distinguished Committee and with these fine witnesses to discuss the Department of Justice's views regarding the continued use of mandatory minimum sentences as a part of an overall strategy to reduce crime in our country. I hope to give a perspective of a 25-year prosecutor who has worked at both the State and Federal levels. Petrified neighbors, concerned parents, tragic victims, frustrated police officers and our fellow citizens look to us to make our community safer. I believe that tough Federal sentencing laws, including the application of mandatory minimum sentences, when combined with prevention and prisoner reentry programs, can effectively reduce crime. Essentially our tough Federal sentencing laws have allowed Federal and local law enforcement to selectively target violent criminal organizations and impact communities. If time permitted, I would highlight many successful initiatives in my district, the Northern District of Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where strong Federal statutes have been used to rid neighborhoods of entrenched drug-trafficking organizations and gangs ruining the community. My colleagues across the country could give many more examples. One initiative in Dallas resulted in a 47 percent reduction in the crime rate in that community. A neighbor in that area came up to me at a local weed-and-seed meeting and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to come outside her house without fear for the first time in a long time. There is a common theme in all of these initiatives. These organizations were involved in the commission of violent crimes in addition to significant drug-trafficking activity. Prior efforts at the State level were unsuccessful, resulting in defendants receiving little or no time. Our Federal statutes allowed law enforcement to garner the cooperation of lower- level gang members, allowing them to climb the hierarchical ladder to bring down the leaders, dismantling the organizations. Those statutes ensured that those outlaws would not quickly return to these communities and again wreak havoc. On the other hand, those deserving defendants received a safety valve reduction tempering the application of the mandatory minimum provisions. Importantly, those Federal statutes sent a clear message of deterrence, echoed in the lyrics of a local Dallas rap artist later convicted in one of our initiatives when he said, ``better call the Feds; DPD, the Dallas Police Department, ain't enough.'' While I can provide several examples of the deterrent effect of these sentencing provisions, especially in Texas, that I have observed over the last 25 years as a prosecutor, I offer the success we have had in Dallas. Since 2002, newly released parolees and probationers are required to attend a reentry program where they are educated about the severe Federal penalties associated with firearm possession and use. Federal, State and local law enforcement heads, including myself, meet with these people and convey to these former prisoners their commitment to vigorously enforce the Federal firearm laws. A study conducted by the University of Texas in Arlington found that since the institution of this program, there has been nearly a 50 percent reduction in the incidence of gun crimes in Dallas County. The threat of severe confinement no doubt contributed to this reduction. And may I add a footnote. If you think the word is not out about the possibility of significant time for carrying firearms during drug crimes, I had a defendant myself when I was an AUSA, a meth lab cook, who took an informant and told an informant not to bring a firearm to the lab because I don't want--he said this--``I don't want that firearm enhancement on me if I am busted by the Feds.'' Finally, I respectfully suggest that it would be imprudent to quickly dismiss the thoughtful deliberations of Members of Congress which resulted in the Sentencing Reform Act and the inclusion of selected statutes for mandatory minimums. As a young Federal prosecutor in the 1980's, I witnessed a dramatic difference in sentencing Federal defendants received depending on where in the country they were sentenced or even who sat as a judge. Those tough Federal statutes, including selected provisions with mandatory minimums, when used as a part of an overall strategy, including prevention and reentry initiatives, can reduce crime, bettering our communities. I ask that Congress should carefully consider whether to retreat from this effective sentencing structure. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Roper. [The prepared statement of Mr. Roper follows:] Prepared Statement of Richard B. Roper [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Scott. Mr. Mauer. TESTIMONY OF MARC MAUER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE SENTENCING PROJECT Mr. Mauer. Thank you so much, Congressman Scott. In my testimony I want to address three key themes that address Federal mandatory sentencing, and these are, first, that the Federal mandatory penalties adopted in the 1980's were essentially based on false premises about their ability to reduce crime; secondly, mandatory sentencing has not, in fact, achieved its stated objectives; and thirdly, that alternative policies could produce more fair and more effective sentencing. Now, the first theme is that mandatory sentencing was based on false premises. Mandatory sentencing, as we have learned through many years, is not, in fact, mandatory; it is not, in fact, consistent. As far back as 1991, in the report by the Sentencing Commission, a comprehensive report on mandatory sentencing, we learned that in about a third of the cases that a mandatory sentence might have applied, in fact, the defendant was permitted to plead to a charge below the mandatory sentence. Now, there are a variety of reasons why that took place. There are also racial and ethnic disparities that resulted from those plea negotiations. But in terms of mandatory sentencing, somehow sending a message that if you do the crime, you do the time, we know that in a third of the cases that was not the case. These people went to prison, but for varying degrees of time. Mandatory sentencing is also premised or has also been promoted as having a strong deterrent effect on potential offenders. And here I think we have a very serious problem in that the research on deterrence in criminal penalties for a very long period of time has shown us that deterrence is much more a function of the certainty of punishment rather than the severity of punishment. In other words, if a person believes that he or she will be caught for a crime, if there is more law enforcement out there or something like that, then they may think twice about committing a crime. But merely increasing the amount of punishment that someone is subject to for people who generally do not believe they will be caught does not add very much to any kind of deterrent value. We see the mandatory penalties, as we know, in the Federal system have been overwhelmingly applied to drug offenses. This is the area where they are also least likely to be effective, and that is because drug offenders, low-level sellers on the street, are easily replaced. As soon as we snatch up a few on the street corner, there is an almost endless supply, as we have seen through the war on drugs and the record number of arrests and incarceration and an endless supply of people who are willing to take their place for a chance to make a quick buck or so. And so their replacement, in fact, diminishes any impact that the mandatories may have. In terms of the level of success, we now have 20 years of experience with Federal mandatory penalties. Some proponents claim that the decline in crime in the 1990's is evidence of the success of mandatory penalties in particular. If we look at the research to date on why crime declined in the 1990's, the best research seems to suggest that at most about 25 percent of the decline in violent crime was due to rising incarceration. Some researchers believe it is as little as 10 or 15 percent. But we are talking here about incarceration in general. Of all the convictions in the U.S. every year, approximately 1 million, only 6 percent take place in Federal court. Of those, only a small fraction are mandatory penalties. So essentially we are looking at perhaps 1 or 2 percent of all the convictions involving Federal mandatory penalties. It is possible that has had an effect on crime, but we certainly have no idea from any of the research or any of the data, so it is extremely speculative to assume that that is a factor there. Secondly, in terms of the level of success, as we have heard very clearly from the Sentencing Commission and many others, the drug quantity levels established in mandatory penalties, particularly for crack cocaine, not only are not effective but they encourage prosecution of lower-level offenders by setting the crack cocaine threshold at 5 grams. The Sentencing Commission data shows us that more than 60 percent of the people prosecuted for crack cocaine offenses are low-level offenders. This is not exactly what Federal resources should be doing, and we have seen as well, of course, the disproportionate impact of communities of color. Thirdly what can we do to develop more effective and more fair sentencing policies? Well, since the Booker decision by the Supreme Court, we now have an even greater chasm between mandatory penalties, particularly for drugs, and all other Federal crimes. The sort of disruption in the sentencing grid or the sentencing proportions is even greater now that Federal judges have more discretion in nonmandatory cases. And it calls into question the whole structure much more severely. What can we do? It seems to me Congress might want to request that the Sentencing Commission conduct an updated assessment of mandatory penalties. It has been 16 years now since the Sentencing Commission first did that. Secondly, we want to review the drug quantities, particularly for crack cocaine, and raise that to the level of powder cocaine certainly. It seems to me we should consider the expansion of the safety valve. This is used in approximately a third of the relevant drug cases. Judges are finding significant numbers of cases where it is appropriate. It may be time to see if judges should have more discretion in this regard as well. Finally we see that the experience in the States over the last several years is one that is very much moving toward reform, reconsideration of sentencing policies. I think we have much to learn from that experience in the States. I think the States are moving in an interesting direction that suggests that maybe it is time to reconsider some of these policies. Thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Mauer follows:] Prepared Statement of March Mauer [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Scott. Mr. Bonner. TESTIMONY OF T.J. BONNER, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL (AFGE), CAMPO, CA Mr. Bonner. Thank you, Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes, other distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, for the opportunity to try and put a human face on one of these cases. I represent 11,000 front-line Border Patrol agents. This agency has a long, proud history dating back 83 years. In that span of time--and bear in mind, when I entered on duty 29 years ago, there were about 2,500 Border Patrol agents, a relatively small agency. In that short span of time, more than 100 officers have given their lives in the line of duty. As we speak, every 8 hours a Border Patrol agent is assaulted in the line of duty. It is a very dangerous job. It is a testament to the high-quality training that in almost every circumstance when these agents are confronted with danger, that they respond correctly according to their training. The incident that occurred on February 17, 2005, in Fabens, Texas, was no different. Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, when confronted with an armed drug smuggler who wielded on them with a gun, responded properly when they opened fire to defend themselves. Now, how they ended up in Federal prison is a mystery to me because I have examined facts there. And let us be clear about one thing: There were only three eye witnesses, the two agents and the drug smuggler. Everyone else who was near that area had their vision completely obstructed by an 11-foot-high levee road, so they could not see what happened. And we have physical evidence that was taken from the body of the smuggler about a month later by a U.S. Army colonel, and this colonel testified in court. And also his statement as part of the investigative record shows that the smuggler's body was turned at the moment of impact, indicating that the agents were telling the truth when they said that the smuggler was running dead away from them and turned with his left arm and pointed something at them. Now, they had a split second to determine what that object might have been. Many of us have had the benefit of months to ponder what someone could have possibly been pointing at law enforcement officers as he was fleeing from them. I can't come up with a different answer. It was a gun. Someone who is carrying $1 million worth of marijuana, in my experience as a Federal law enforcement agent, is going to be armed, and that is borne out by the experience of many of my colleagues. The fact of the matter is this person absconded. He got back across the border, so we will never know with certainty. The real mystery is why did the U.S. attorney choose to believe a drug smuggler over the word of two sworn Federal law enforcement officers? This case is very troublesome, it is troublesome to the public; it is troublesome to not just Border Patrol agents, but other law enforcement officers who are sitting back wondering how this could have happened in the United States of America. I realize that the focus of this hearing is on mandatory minimum sentences, but you can't get to a sentencing phase if you don't have a prosecution. Why were these agents prosecuted in the first place is a question that simply has not been answered to my satisfaction. With respect to the mandatory minimum sentences, it bears noting that U.S. attorneys have great discretion as to whether or not to bring those charges in the first place. There was an incident in January of this year down in Del Rio, Texas, where Border Patrol agents, State and local law enforcement officers were fired upon by an individual with a high-powered .30-06 hunting rifle. When he was arrested, he stated that the only reason he stopped firing at the law enforcement officers was because he ran out of ammunition. The same U.S. attorney who prosecuted Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, Johnny Sutton, did not bring charges of 18 U.S.C. 924(c), use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence. He merely charged him with assault against a law enforcement officer, which carries a 20-year maximum penalty, no minimum penalty. This case cries out for an investigation. I am not asking for a decision on the spot, but I am asking that this case be fully investigated. It is quite obvious that the Administration is not going to lift a finger to investigate itself, so it falls upon the Congress to take that action, to appoint someone who is impartial and empowered to go in, subpoena people, and get to the heart of this matter, because with each passing day that these agents are allowed to rot in solitary confinement in prison, the public confidence goes down. The confidence of hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers around the country is declining. This is a crisis of confidence that needs to be addressed now. Thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bonner follows:] Prepared Statement of T.J. Bonner [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Scott. And I just remind you, you indicated that this hearing is on mandatory minimums. Many of the issues that you have and the questions you have asked are being considered now on appeal, and we don't want to inject ourselves in that process. The impact of that case, though, for this hearing is on the fact that the judge had to sentence at sentencing and could not consider anything other than the mandatory minimum when they were sentencing. And that is what we want to make sure we focus the attention on. Ms. Nunn. TESTIMONY OF SERENA NUNN, J.D., ANN ARBOR, MI Ms. Nunn. Initially I would like to thank this Committee and FAMM for affording me this opportunity to share my experiences and opinions regarding mandatory sentencing provisions affecting thousands across the country. Also I would like to emphasize that nothing I say today should be interpreted as my failure to recognize the far-reaching negative consequences that illegal drugs has had on communities across the country. To the contrary, I understand how the illegal drug trade has ravaged communities and individuals across the country. Moreover, I fully accept responsibility for my actions and understand that I deserved punishment. However, I will state unconditionally to this Committee that the wide net cast in the effort to remove major drug traffickers from the community has taken many potentially first-time offenders out of the community for lengthy periods of time. With that being said, I will briefly discuss how mandatory minimums affected me. I was raised in a single-parent home in the inner city of Minneapolis. I was the eldest of three. In high school I wrote for the school yearbook and newspaper. I was also homecoming queen and a cheerleader. I graduated from high school in 1987. After graduation I attended Morris Brown, an Historically Black College in Atlanta, Georgia. While in college I experienced financial difficulties. In the summer after my first year, I returned home. I planned to work, save money and return to Morris Brown College, but that never happened. I met a guy named Monty during the summer after my first year in college. After we began dating, it was obvious that he dealt drugs. In May 1989, Monty and several others were arrested for attempting to purchase 20 kilos from a Government informant. Within a month of his arrest, at age 19 I was indicted on three Federal felony counts involving the distribution of cocaine. Our trial lasted 5 weeks. Then on December 22, 1989, a jury returned a guilty verdict, and I was taken into custody. In May 1990, the sentencing judge wanted to give me a lenient sentence due to my age, limited role in the conspiracy and the fact that I had no prior criminal record, but Federal mandatory minimums forced the judge to sentence me to 15 years and 8 months. In December 1997, the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper in Minnesota featured me in an article about mandatory minimums thanks to FAMm. And in December 1997, I received a letter from an attorney who was willing to review my case on a pro bono basis. After he reviewed my case, he decided that we should file a Presidential commutation of sentence. The commutation was filed in March of 2000 with the support of the Federal sentencing judge in my case, the Governor of Minnesota, the State attorney general in Minnesota, the Federal prosecutor in my case and our congressional Representative in Minnesota. On July 7, 2000, I received a Presidential commutation and was released from prison that day. Since my release I received a bachelor of arts degree, I received a law degree. I currently work as a law clerk for a criminal defense attorney, and I cohost a radio talk show. I would just like to add that my lengthy sentence due to mandatory minimums placed a severe strain on my family, it made my transition into society extremely difficult, and had it not been for a strong support system, it would have diminished all of my hope in becoming a successful, productive citizen back into society. Simply put, I feel that mandatory minimums should be abolished, and they should allow judges to regain their discretion. Thank you. Mr. Scott. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Nunn follows:] Prepared Statement of Serena Nunn I was raised by a single parent in the inner city of Minneapolis, and I had a good childhood. I did well in high school, writing for the yearbook and school newspaper while juggling cheerleader duties, and was elected Homecoming Queen. In 1987, I graduated from high school. After graduation, I attended Morris Brown College in the fall of 1987, and I became the first person in my family to attend college. My mother had planned on subsidizing my college costs but was unable to do so due to personal and financial problems. Unable to support myself at school, I returned to the inner-city environment that I had tried so hard to leave. My plan was to work, save money and return to Morris Brown, but that never happened. After returning to Minneapolis, I began dating a young man named Monty, who seemed to do well for himself. After moving in with him, it became evident that he was dealing drugs. Stupidity, naivete and love kept me in the relationship. On May 17, 1989, Monty and several others were arrested for attempting to purchase twenty kilograms of cocaine form a government informant. Within a month of his arrest, at age nineteen, I was indicted on three federal felony counts involving the distribution of cocaine. While living with Monty, my voice was recorded through wiretaps, answering our phone and passing messages between him and his drug associates. I was convicted of the three charges against me at a trial that included twenty-four co-defendants. The judge wanted to give me a lenient sentence due to my age, limited role in the conspiracy and the fact that I had no prior criminal record. But the federal mandatory- minimum sentencing laws forced the judge to sentence me to fifteen years and eight months. In December 1997, after eight years in prison, The Minneapolis Star Tribune featured me in an article about mandatory-minimums. Soon after, I received a letter from a young attorney whom only a week earlier had been sworn to practice law. He reviewed my case on a pro bono basis and determined that my only hope of an early release was if President Clinton commuted my sentence. At the time, President Clinton had commuted fewer than five sentences. My attorney devoted a great deal of time to my case, and in March 2000, he submitted my clemency petition. On July 7, 2000, President Clinton commuted my sentence and I was released that day. A decade in prison taught me many invaluable lessons about life. Shock was my immediate reaction to daily confinement. I could not fathom living the next fifteen years without privacy, and constantly being told when to wake, eat and sleep. I ultimately survived the mental tribulations by refusing to lose sight of my future, telling myself that my early dreams of earning a college degree were not quashed, just postponed. I also realized that my actions in Monty's conspiracy contributed to my community's degradation and punishment was warranted. However, a fifteen year eight month sentence seemed extremely unfair considering I was a first-time, nonviolent offender. After five years in prison, I had laid the foundation for my future by completing several college and self-improvement courses. Eight years into my sentence, however, I began to feel depressed as a result of spending most of my twenties in prison, and I still had several more years left, which would stretch into my thirties. I survived depression through prayer, the support of my family and friends, by hardening my determination, and telling myself that despite bleak circumstances, nothing could prevent me from reaching my goals. After my release I attended college full-time at Arizona State University (``ASU'') and worked twenty-hours a week in the political science department. While working on my bachelors degree at ASU, I devoted a significant amount of time to traveling the country, speaking with members of Congress, law students, undergraduate students and special interest groups about the impact of federal mandatory-minimum sentencing laws. In 2002, I graduated from ASU with a degree in Political Science. In 2003, I began attended the University of Michigan Law School. During law school, I worked at the Public Defenders Service in Washington, D.C. In 2006, I graduated from the University of Michigan Law School. Currently, I work as a law clerk for a criminal defense attorney in Detroit, Michigan. Additionally, I co-host a Public Affairs Program on one of Detroit's radio stations. Mandatory-minimums negatively affected my life in many ways. They stole many of my productive years in life because I went to prison at age 20 and was not due for release until age 34. Fortunately, I received a Presidential Commutation so I had the opportunity to redeem myself. However, there are hundreds of women, and men, serving lengthy sentences under mandatory-minimums who will not receive a Presidential Commutation and will serve each day of their sentence. Mandatory-minimums placed a severe strain on my family members. After my incarceration my immediate family fell apart. My mother fell into a deeper depression. My sister, with whom I share a very close relationship, moved away to another state, and my younger brother, who was 13-years old, felt alone and hopeless. Approximately six years into my incarceration, my younger brother was convicted of murder. My grandmother, who was a pillar of strength in my life, developed health problems during my incarceration. Unfortunately, ten years into my incarceration she passed away. As a result of the mandatory-minimum sentence I received, I was removed from society for almost eleven years. Once I was released, technology was a major obstacle in my life. I did not know how to operate items that are a part of everyday use. For instance, I did not know how to properly operate a computer, use a debit card at the grocery store or gas station, or know that public bathrooms had self- flushing toilets. Technology continues to evolve and when a person is removed from society for such a long period in life it makes the transition back into society extremely difficult. After many years of my incarceration, I felt that I was a different person, mentally and spiritually. All I wanted was a second chance to try again in life, to show everyone that I could be a productive citizen, and that I did not need fifteen years of incarceration to become a better person. However, as the years droned on it became harder to believe that my future would be successful because I felt as though I was ready to be released, yet I was still incarcerated wasting away. If I did not receive a commutation, then mandatory-minimums would have robbed me of my hope that I would get another chance in life. Simply put, mandatory-minimums should be abolished to allow judges to regain their sentencing discretion. Mr. Scott. And I thank all of the witnesses for your testimony. We will now have questions, and I will begin recognizing myself for 5 minutes. We have been joined by the gentleman from North Carolina Mr. Coble and the gentlelady from Texas Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee. And Mr. Davis has been in. First, Mr. Mauer, is there any evidence that mandatory minimums reduce recidivism? Mr. Mauer. No, there is no evidence that shows that. And keeping people in prison longer does not reduce recidivism. People are going to make it or not make it based on their family and community support when they get out and what we do that is constructive in prison, but mandatory sentencing has no effect. And, if anything, one can argue that it is counterproductive. In States where you have a chance to earn some good time or parole release, there may be some incentive built in to participate in programming in prison which is taken away when you have a mandatory sentence. Mr. Scott. You indicated that there was little deterrent involved in the longer mandatory minimums. Do you have research to support that? Mr. Mauer. Well, we do know that the research, as I indicated before, on sort of certainty versus severity, is very compelling in showing that potential offenders will respond somewhat to greater law enforcement. The example I always think of is if we are traveling on a highway, some of us have been known to go above the speed limit from time to time. If it is a holiday weekend and there are more State troopers out, most of us will go at the speed limit. So the certainty has changed, and it changes our behavior. But most of us don't know whether the penalty for speeding is $50 or $100 or whatever, and so we are not really paying attention to the severity of the penalty because we don't expect to get caught. It is only when that chance of certainty changes that we may change our behavior. I think if there is anything in terms of research on mandatories, the most obvious cases, just the impact of the war on drugs, we have increased the drug offender population in our prisons and jails from about 40,000 people in 1980 to nearly a half million today, and one would think that if the idea of mandatory sentencing and massive incarceration was a way to send a message to drug users and drug sellers, we should have sent that message with great force by now, and certainly drug abuse remains a problem in many communities. Mr. Scott. Let me ask Judge Hinojosa, the punishment for-- along the same lines, the punishment for crack is substantially different than the sentencing for powder; that for 5 grams of crack, you get 5 years mandatory minimum, and you can get probation for the same amount of powder. Is there any evidence that the more severe punishment has encouraged people to use powder rather than crack? Judge Hinojosa. We don't have any evidence of that. As you know, we are again urging Congress to revisit this issue, because as our report points out, the 100 to 1 ratio has created and continues to create problems with regards to the type of individual who might be punished under the mandatory minimum ratio of 100 to 1 between crack and powder. And the Commission itself has taken some action with regards to the guidelines which we consider a very partial remedy to a problem that needs to be seriously addressed by Congress, and we again urge that action by the Congress. Mr. Scott. You talk about the safety valve and why that-- let me ask Judge Cassell, because you mentioned the case where you had to sentence somebody to 55 years. Why was that person not entitled to a safety valve consideration? Judge Cassell. The safety valve didn't apply to his kind of case. It is not applicable in 924(c) cases. It wouldn't be applicable in the case of the Border Patrol agents that has been discussed. Mr. Scott. Where it is applicable, why doesn't it remove the manifest injustice in the kinds of sentences that have to be imposed? I have talked to a number of judges who have indicated similar same-day sentences for someone with an obviously much more severe crime got much less of a sentence because of the mandatory minimums. Why doesn't the safety valve solve most of those problems? Judge Cassell. Well, the safety valve is a step forward, but it doesn't apply in all cases. There are five requirements that people have to meet to satisfy the safety valve exception, and some cases simply don't fit into those five criteria. The basic problem here is that judges aren't given the opportunity to assess individual circumstances of individual cases. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Mr. Roper, you indicated that you had a significant reduction in crime because you were able to impose long sentences. Why couldn't you have achieved that result with traditional long sentences rather than mandatory minimum long sentences? Mr. Roper. Well, I think the reason is, it is that threat of going to jail. It could be under the guidelines. Sure, you could do it just like that if the guidelines were mandatory, but the problem is, you know, a lot of people don't want to cooperate against drug trafficking organizations just because they have a sense of public--of duty. They do it because they are in a position where they have to do it. And I think we need those tools to be able to garner the cooperation of these lower-level drug dealers, give them a break. That is one reason that many times 924(c)s don't apply, the mandatory minimums don't apply. People do choose to cooperate. And being somebody that is right on the front lines, we need that. People call us, Chairman, to rid these communities of problems, and we have to have the tools to do it. We can't do it just from wiretaps or just from the sense of waiting for people to come forward. We need to infiltrate those organizations, and if we don't have the tools to do it, we can't do that. Mr. Scott. My time has expired. Mr. Forbes. Mr. Forbes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me thank all of our witnesses for being here. We are on a limited time period, so I may have to cut you off because I want to get as many questions in as I can. I want to set the stage first of all, because one of the things we do in these hearings, we bring in six witnesses and we tend to blend apples and oranges, and we listen to testimony and we are trying to say, who is talking about this? Is that the issue we are really looking at? Part of our job is to make sure we get the apples in the right basket, the oranges in the right basket and so forth. And one of the things that I am looking at here, let's look at, first of all, procedure, how we change this. We have today the Chairman of the Crime Subcommittee who is here, who has said this violates common sense, mandatory sentencing laws are ineffective in stopping crime, it is wasting taxpayer money, no careful consideration by Members of these bills. We have the Chairman of the full Committee; at any time we could bring a bill before the full Committee saying, do away with mandatory sentences, and let's vote on it, and let's have a debate on it and see if the Members agree with all these things. And I encourage them. If that is the route we need to go, bring the bill up. We don't have to have any more hearings on it. Let's just do it. The second thing that we look at is, we blend State and Federal issues. We talk about, sometimes, what is happening in the State system, what is happening in the Federal. But then I heard the Chairman raise this argument today. He said--didn't understand why border agents doing their job end up being prosecuted under the law. Mr. Bonner, that is exactly what you are saying. It doesn't have anything to do with whether it is a mandatory minimum or not. What your big issue is today, they should never have been prosecuted at all. If we went to the Nifong case with the prosecution of the Duke lacrosse players, and let's say not only was he able to get an indictment by a grand jury, but he somehow got a conviction, we wouldn't be in here arguing that we ought to do away with the rape laws in North Carolina. We would be saying it should never have been prosecuted. Mr. Bonner, I want to ask you--you raised a good point in your testimony. You said, why did U.S. attorneys choose to believe the word of a drug smuggler over two sworn officers? And I agree with you. But that prosecutor had the discretion of whether to bring that charge in the first place, and he also had the discretion of whether simply to bring it with assault, with serious bodily injury, which was the underlying offense. If those agents had gotten 8 years instead of 10 years, would that have been any less egregious in your eyes? Mr. Bonner. No, it wouldn't have. If they had received 1 second, it would have still been a gross miscarriage of justice. Mr. Forbes. So your major concern today--and it is a rightful concern--was why they were prosecuted in the first place. Is that a fair---- Mr. Bonner. That is a fair characterization. Mr. Forbes. And Judge Cassell, I listen to you and have the utmost respect for you and appreciate your being here. You talked about the message that came to crime victims, of disparity with mandatory sentences. But there is also a message that goes to crime victims for judges who have that discretion and abuse it by releasing individuals with slaps on the wrist when they commit serious crimes. We talked about the message to taxpayers when mandatory sentences result in unfair sentences. But there is also a message to taxpayers from judges that release people without giving them adequate sentences. Talking about the message to criminals that they get, it is also a message if we say to criminals, if you do the crime, you are going to do the time. We had a hearing in New Orleans that just astounded me because the reason we went down there was because we hoped that--somebody hoped, I think, that we were going to find out that there were all kinds of problems after Katrina. In reality, what we found out was New Orleans had a lot of problems before Katrina and after Katrina; and one of the major reasons--look at these statistics, 7 percent of the individuals arrested ever went to jail and 12 percent, including the ones for violent felonies and murders, ever went to jail. And we had people coming in testifying; it was creating huge problems with morale for police officers, huge problems in corruption down there. My question to you is, we are always trying to strike a balance, and balances aren't easy. When President Clinton signed the law that you had to impose that sentence, when he signed the law on the case with--in Mr. Bonner's case, I know he didn't intend that these results were going to take place. And we always have to modify and get the law; it just doesn't mean we throw the baby out with the bath water. In the case of New Orleans, for example, I know it is egregious, but what should we do in those situations, Judge? Should we still give them unfettered discretion in how they continue to hand down their sentences? Judge Cassell. I think you are exactly right. We have a balance here. Somewhere between a 55 years for somebody like Mr. Angelo--let me suggest the perfect balance here is what the Sentencing Commission has come up. They have put together guidelines that cover every single case---- Mr. Forbes. Mr. Cassell, with all due respect, I have got cases right here where the judges aren't doing that. They are given sometimes 46 percent, 50-some percent and these are in serious rape cases and pornography cases that are tough cases. And from our position on the legislature, sometimes you sit back and you just say, I don't know how we are going to get those judges to do it. And one of the methods we have are mandatory sentences. Mr. Roper, you have lived this. You see it on the streets. It is not theory to you. How important are these mandatory sentences to you in dealing with the crime you have to stop every single day? Mr. Roper. Well, like I said, it allows us to get cooperation from folks at a lower level, to work up the food chain, so to speak. And it also allows us to take these people out of the community that are violent. Many of the--what you would consider maybe midlevel drug dealers, sometimes those are the most violent offenders that we deal with that--in addition to being gang members, drug trafficking organizations, that they also are very violent. Mr. Forbes. And if you don't get them off the streets, then they take good people like Ms. Nunn sometimes and they bring them into those crime networks, too. Is that not a fair statement? Mr. Roper. Yes sir, they do. That is the sad thing about it. It ruins communities. Mr. Forbes. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. Mr. Scott. Thank you. Mr. Conyers. Mr. Conyers. This is so important, this hearing. I know Marc Mauer is sitting to your left, Mr. U.S. Attorney, and I think he is entitled to make some comments about the discussion that has gone on, that my good friend, the Ranking Member who, I am sorry, is leaving us now---- Mr. Forbes. Temporarily. I will stay to hear---- Mr. Conyers. Because I am going to talk about you, my man, and I don't want you---- Mr. Forbes. I will stay. Mr. Conyers [continuing]. I don't want you to leave and say, Wow. As Chairman, I am working overtime and breeding bipartisanship in the Judiciary Committee. And it is long overdue, and I want to do it. But what my colleague--who, if I remember his track record on these matters, is still a proponent of mandatory minimums and the death penalty and the gang bills. And then he invites us to vote it out of Committee and bring it up for a vote. Well, let's work on that together, Mr. Forbes. And I would be willing to--and yes, I will yield. Mr. Forbes. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I will proudly say I am very much in favor of the gang bills. I think we have enormous gang problems in this country. I am proud--I will continue to work on that. And I still remember the first---- Mr. Conyers. But what about mandatory minimums? Mr. Forbes. I will get to that. And I am sure the Chairman will give you as much time as you will need, if you don't mind yielding to me since you are the Chairman. When we first brought the gang bills before this Committee, your question to me was, do we have a gang problem in the United States? I don't see a gang problem. Today everybody acknowledges the gang problem. The question is, what do we do about it? The death penalty, I believe in the death penalty. I don't mind saying today that I think the death penalty cures crime. The final thing, let me just answer your question on mandatory minimums. I don't believe in mandatory minimums across the board. I think we have an egregious case, and what Judge Cassell said, we have got to look at that situation, what Mr. Bonner's case is; I think we have to examine those situations. We don't get it right every time. We don't always hit the mark. But what I also do is, I know what Mr. Roper says is echoed by law enforcement agents across---- Mr. Conyers. Well, I don't know if I shouldn't have let you leave the room since you are using all my time. But I do this in the spirit of bipartisanship because we are going to get to the bottom of this for the first time in 12 years in the House of Representatives. And now I want to turn to Marc Mauer, who has been before this Judiciary Committee more times than I can recall, to help us put this in perspective. And remember, Mr. Mauer, I am trying to win over Republicans to support this. So that is why I am being very deferential. Mr. Forbes. Chairman, with all due respect, you have got the majority. We are riding along here. Mr. Conyers. Yeah. I have got the majority for 6 months. As a matter of fact, 6 months and--well, it is 5 months and 25 days, so--and it is a pretty thin majority, as I get reminded almost every day around here. Mr. Mauer. Mr. Mauer. I will stay away from political discussion. You can work that out. But thank you, Mr. Forbes, for being here. A couple points on this, first, in terms of looking at sentences of incarceration. As you point out, the New Orleans system, I think by all accounts the New Orleans system, as everybody recognizes, was a mess before Katrina and certainly very much afterwards. I think the problem we have in any system, not just New Orleans, if we look at who was sentenced to a period of incarceration, rarely is this solely a function of what the judge has done. Much more often it is a question of the strength of the evidence the prosecutor has. It has to do with plea negotiations; 90 percent of our convictions are results of plea negotiations, the strength of the case, the quality of the defense attorney. And so the judge may or may not be influential on any given case. Often, I think the prosecutor would say, I am glad I got a conviction even though they don't get much time because it is better than nothing. So we have to look very carefully at what is going on there. On the question of controlling judges, I don't know who all these so-called ``soft judges'' are these days. I really don't see much evidence. Certainly, in the Federal system, we have, you know, excellent data pre- and post-Booker, and judges are behaving, I think, quite responsibly overall and taking these very seriously, as are State judges. The broad picture, of course, over the last 30 years we have increased our prison population by over 500 percent. So, somehow, somebody is sending many people to prison and keeping them there for a long time. Now, whether or not we think that is a good idea, I would point out one of the things that has happened is, we have had I think a very severe imbalance in resources that has developed. The more money we have put into the prison system, the less we have on the front end of probation and parole supervision; and so probation and parole officials will tell you over and over again that their caseloads have mushroomed, they can't provide effective supervision. So I think we have got into a very vicious cycle now whereby offenders who could be managed appropriately in the community with services and supervision, now judges and probation officials are often unwilling to take a chance on that because they don't feel they have the proper supervision, and so prison becomes the option. That is why the whole reentry problem has been recognized so significantly. So I think this imbalance, inappropriate incarceration of far too many low-level offenders, has put the system considerably out of balance and, I think, done a disservice to what everybody would agree is that prison should be used for violent, dangerous offenders that we need to be protected from. Other people can be supervised in the community. Mr. Conyers. Mr. Chairman, based on your promised generosity, I ask for 1 additional minute. Mr. Scott. Without objection. But pending that, I would like to recognize the presence of the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Conyers. Thank you very much. We are in a very complicated situation here, and I am just happy that Howard Coble is here and Judge Gohmert is here, because these are the folks that are going to help us move toward some kind of conclusion on this mandatory minimum. We have got some more hearings that we will probably have to reach, and I would like to ask Mr. Bonner in terms of his feelings about--not about the case, about these two Border Patrol agents, which I think deserves an investigation and a discussion with U.S. Attorney Sutton at another time. But how do you see us moving into a more realistic version of criminal justice? We are fighting gangs, we are fighting drug dealers. In what direction should we be moving from your experience and perspective? Mr. Bonner. Well, that is a very broad question, Mr. Chairman. We are clearly losing the war on drugs. Our borders are out of control. Many of our cities have crime problems that are completely unacceptable. So I think we need to rethink some of the strategies that we have been pursuing. Clearly, when the cost of drugs is cheaper today than it was 10 or 20 years ago, and when our agents on the frontlines at the border estimate that we seize perhaps 5 percent of all the narcotics coming across the border, we are not winning the war on drugs. We are not securing our borders. We are not stopping illegal immigration. And I could go on for a long time about ways to improve the system, but I think it requires a fundamental rethinking of some of the aspects. I mean, for example--and I know that I am taking up precious time, but you opened the door here. So, you know, for example, on the issue of why do 3 or 4 million people come across our borders illegally every year? They are coming looking for work, and they can find work, and as long as that happens, they will come across. And the drug smugglers are using them as a shield, as a diversion; and that explains why it is so easy to get anything, whether it is drugs, terrorists or weapons of mass destruction across our borders. Mr. Conyers. Thank you so much. And I thank the Chairman for his generosity. I have a lot of questions for the judges, and we will hopefully get back. Thank you, Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott. Thank you. The gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Coble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I apologize to you and the Ranking Member. I had two other meetings and I arrived belatedly. I came in just as Mr. Bonner was speaking. Good to have you all with us. Mr. Bonner, most of us are not unfamiliar with the Border Patrol case about which you testified. What other prosecutions against law enforcement or Border Patrol officers have been initiated by U.S. Attorney Sutton? Mr. Bonner. Mr. Sutton? Mr. Coble. Several? Mr. Bonner. Several. The Deputy Sheriff out of Rock Springs, Texas, Gilmer Hernandez; Border Patrol Agent Gary Brugman out of Del Rio, Texas; you had Border Patrol Agent Noe Aleman out of El Paso; you had FBI Special Agent in Charge Hardrick Crawford. Mr. Coble. Do you have concerns about the way those matters were handled? Mr. Bonner. I do. I think we need to open up an investigation and relook at all of those cases because the conduct of the U.S. attorney there--and this is not a universal slam against the U.S. attorneys because we have many, many fine U.S. attorneys in this country who get it right consistently. But when you have one who is exhibiting a pattern of going after the wrong people and giving immunity to drug smugglers, then I think you have to reopen those cases and take a long, hard look at them. Mr. Coble. Well, I don't want the tone or tenor of my question to imply that I am trying to slam-dunk Mr. Sutton. I don't even know him. But let me ask you this--pardon? Mr. Gohmert. Go ahead. Mr. Coble. Thank you, Tex. But, Mr. Bonner, let me ask you this: What specific concerns, if any, do you have concerning the prosecutor's decision to immunize the victim in the Border Patrol case about which you testified? Mr. Bonner. Well, I bristle at the use of your word ``victim'' because the two victims here were the Border Patrol agents. Mr. Coble. Yeah. I don't disagree with that. Mr. Bonner. The drug smuggler was immunized. And out of gratitude for that, he continued in his nefarious ways and was caught in October of that same year, another load in Clint, Texas, very near the same area where he was shot by Border Patrol agents when he pointed a weapon at them. A van containing 752 pounds of marijuana was discovered, and the occupant of that house pointed him out, pulled him out of a photo lineup, named him by name, physical description. And his brother, who was in Mexico corroborated that. His brother said that he couldn't come back because he had been convicted on drug charges in the U.S. and would be incarcerated if he came back. But he said, he is the guy that the Border Patrol agent shot about 6 months ago, taking it back to February of that year. Mr. Coble. Well, as I said, Mr. Bonner, none of us is unfamiliar with that case. We all are very familiar with it. And, Mr. Chairman, this may not be for me to say but I think serious consideration should be commuting those sentences, if not pardoning. But that will be for another day. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Davis. Mr. Chairman, can I make a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. Scott. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Davis. Simply for a parliamentary inquiry, I don't want to waste my questions on this. But there has been a lot of testimony about a particular U.S. attorney and a particular U.S. case, and I wonder if the record could be opened to give him a chance to respond. Mr. Scott. It could be. People can send in whatever they want. The testimony here is not on the case itself or the prosecution, but the impact of mandatory minimums. People can ask questions, I guess, about whatever they want to ask. Mr. Davis. I am just simply troubled, Mr. Chairman. There has been significant commentary about a case that is under way, and the opposite point of view has not been represented. Mr. Scott. And on appeal--it is presently on appeal. The point is well taken. And if the gentleman submits any response, without objection, it will be accepted. The gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am concerned about the case involving agents Ramos and Compean, and I appreciate the opportunity that you have taken, Mr. Bonner, to let the Nation know about what happened. And it was in the context of this hearing, which happens to be on mandatory minimums, that you did that. And you did it because these two individuals, Agents Ramos and Compean, have been victimized by the mandatory sentencing scheme that we have enacted into law here. And that is something that Mr. Roper, the former DA and current U.S. attorney, feels very passionately about in terms of the propriety of our maintenance of the mandatory minimums because he feels like they go far toward enabling crime to be addressed, and crime rates would go down as a result. But, nevertheless, what has happened here with Agents Ramos and Compean is, after they were charged and convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and aiding and abetting each other, I suppose, in that offense and also deprivation of rights under color of law--and I don't know what the particulars of the case were, but it does appear from your testimony that someone was shot in the buttocks, but they were shot from a side angle; and they were a fleeing felon with $1 million worth of marijuana. And so I guess an argument could be made that these Border Patrol agents were simply doing their job. However, a prosecutor decided to charge them, and he charged them with a violation of 924(c), which is discharging a firearm during the commission of the assault or during the commission of the deprivation of rights, whichever the case may have been. And that was a prosecutorial decision that was made by U.S. Attorney Sutton who, by the way, did not make that same decision in a case involving a fleeing felon who used a weapon and unloaded it and stopped firing only because he had no more ammunition. That is what you have testified to, correct, Mr. Bonner? Mr. Bonner. That is correct. Mr. Johnson. And so the prosecutor is exercising his discretion, and that discretion translates into what kind of mandatory sentence, if any, would be applicable. And so Compean and Ramos got charged with 924(c), Mr. Roper, but the other gentleman did not, prosecutorial discretion, and the judges don't have the ability once the prosecutor makes the call as to who--as to what to charge with. Then you are locking the judges into what they can sentence the individual for, not the facts of the case, but the charge that he was convicted of. So what we have done is shifted discretion away from the judges to exercise discretion, and hoisted it upon the prosecution which--by the way, Mr. Roper, I am very impressed with you and, in terms of your desire, your strong desire to enforce the law. And I would say that you probably would be biased in favor of prosecution as opposed to defense. And I would think that the judges, after hearing the evidence, would be less biased toward one group or one arm versus the other; in other words, prosecution, defense, the judges sitting up there and making the decision would be able to weigh all the evidence and decide without bias what the proper sentence was. I believe that is the reason why you are here today, Mr. Bonner, is because the case of the Border Patrol agents illustrates this shift of power from the judges to the prosecutor. What do you say about that, Mr. Roper? Mr. Roper. Well, if I understand your question right---- Mr. Johnson. My question is, isn't it true that mandatory minimums shift discretion, sentencing discretion, ultimately away from judges and into the hands of prosecutors? Mr. Roper. I think to some degree that is true, yes. Mr. Johnson. Let me ask you, Judge Cassell and Judge Hinojosa, what are your thoughts on that? Judge Cassell. I think you have hit the nail on the head when you transferred discretion into the arms of the prosecutor, they are a biased party in the sense that they are representing one side. They are representing the prosecution. Our job as judges is to try to balance the competing concerns; and I think from an institutional perspective, we are better able to exercise discretion, better able to make the individualized judgments that are required in sentencing decisions and is one of the parties in the case. Mr. Johnson. Judge? Judge Hinojosa. Congressman, we have a system in this country basically where the prosecutors do have discretion. When we get stopped for speeding, it is the policeman who decides if we are going to be given a ticket or not. That is just the way the system is set up. However, it does lead to situations where a prosecutor can bring something before a court based on particular charges and therefore deprive the Court of the opportunity to view a range of sentences. That is why I, as a judge and certainly as the Chair of the Sentencing Commission, believe strongly that the sentencing guidelines try to do away with that prosecutorial discretion to some extent with regards to the modified real offense conduct that is used by a judge to determine what the sentence should be; and it goes beyond just the particular charges, but the actual conduct in commission of an offense as well as all the other factors that would be considered. So that is one way that the sentencing guidelines system that was set up by the Sentencing Reform Act was supposed to bring this into the judges to, overall, look at the picture of an offense as opposed to whatever particular charges were brought. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. I have run out of time. Mr. Scott. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. And we had a parliamentary inquiry on the propriety of having hearings with ongoing litigation. I didn't know if that was talking about something today or the EPA hearings yesterday with ongoing litigation. Mr. Davis. I was talking about the events today. Mr. Gohmert. Not about the---- Mr. Davis. Yes. Clarity was needed on that. Mr. Gohmert. Okay. Well, I will mention, yesterday was also regarding a matter that is involved in pending litigation. But you know, the mandatory sentencing issue has really surprised me as a former district judge and briefly in the court of appeals in the State system. Every felony that we undertook had a range of punishment; there was a minimum and there was a maximum, and as a judge, I had discretion to go anywhere within that range. That was the legislative prerogative, to make a range of punishment, and I never thought much about that being this horrible thing called a mandatory minimum. I had the range of punishment. And I appreciate the judges' comments about their sentencing guidelines. Some of us remember when the guidelines took place, some of our Federal judge friends were just going nuts about how horrible they were, how they could usurp control and discretion of the Federal judges. And then it seemed, as time went on--kind of like the frog you put in cool water and eventually warm it up--the judges got quite comfortable with their discretion having been taken away. And then to the point that it seemed, in the last year or two I have been in Congress, we heard judges saying, we haven't had that much problem with the guidelines because they took their discretion away, so they didn't have to stand as much heat for sentences. But I just have difficulty understanding why there is so much problem with the legislature setting a low end and a high end and, Judge, you have got the middle. Judge Hinojosa, do you have a problem with having a low end, or is it that the low end is sometimes too high? Judge Hinojosa. I guess the question is on the issue of mandatory minimums. I guess what mandatory minimums do do is, they treat everybody exactly the same. What the Commission has always felt is that the guidelines and the individual considerations that get taken into effect, whether it is a mitigating role or an aggravating role, whether it is the use of a firearm or not the use of a firearm, in the sense that if there is no firearm, there is no potential difference in the sentence. And so the point that is made on the Commission's part is that the 35-50-3a factors talk about the background in the offense conduct of the individual defendants as well as all these other factors that are to be considered. The guidelines that take those into effect in that, that system is different from a system that automatically starts treating everybody exactly the same and where you have some cliffs where you might end up with just a very small amount with regards to drugs, for example, putting you over the top, as opposed to somebody who has just got slightly less. Mr. Gohmert. But that is the minimum, right, Judge? That is not the maximum that you can do. That is just the low end; isn't that correct? Judge Hinojosa. Right. Mr. Gohmert. So I am not sure from your answer--well, my question was, do you have a problem with the mandatory minimum not being low enough or just having a mandatory minimum at all? And I am still not sure where we stand on that. But I would also point out--I am not--I think McCain- Feingold was one of the biggest constitutional blunders we had at Congress that said, Gee, we want to sound like we are toughening up on this, and as I understand it, it provides for a mandatory prison sentence; and the President said, Well, gee, just be aware I am going to sign it if it comes up here; I will let the Supreme Court take care of it. The Supreme Court said, Don't count on us to be constitutional. So--they punted too, so we ended up with a law that I think has serious constitutional issues. So it is important that we take a good look at these issues and not punt to another body because we can't count on anybody else. And I do appreciate the hearing, and I appreciate the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Committee of the whole indicating that this is an important issue. But it seems like the focus ought to be more on, are the mandatory minimums too high and what should those be, rather than should we have them at all, leaving absolutely complete discretion to the judge. And my time has obviously expired. Mr. Scott. Thank you. The gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee. Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member, the Chairman of the full Committee. This is a hearing long overdue and an important, instructive hearing by the witnesses' testimony to give us guidance for what I think is the chief responsibility of this Committee in particular--but the Congress, Congress first of all, oversight and legislative reform to the extent that it works for the American people and certainly protecting the Constitution. And I do include in the Constitution the issue of the rights of victims and their families, and the rights of those, of course, who have been before the judicial system. So I hope that in my questioning--and I would ask the witnesses if they would give me brief ``yes'' or ``no'' answers. And, Judge Hinojosa, I am very aware of how fast you spoke the first time around. But if I could start with you, and just be as brief as you possibly can be. Do you think it is possible to have a legislative fix for this issue dealing with mandatory sentencing? Can we analyze the facts and come up with a balance that might be responsive to your testimony? Judge Hinojosa. I would hope so. And that is a quick answer. However, you know, at the very least, Congress needs to revisit this issue and at least start looking at it. Certainly in crack, something needs to be done. The issue of the safety valve applies in drug cases. It doesn't seem to apply--it doesn't apply in other cases. There are a lot of situations where I think that it is time for Congress to start looking at this. Ms. Jackson Lee. We should get involved? Judge Hinojosa. And I think from the Commission's standpoint, it is true, our last review was 16 years old. There is a changing docket in the Federal system. We are up to 37 percent of defendants in Federal court are noncitizens of the United States. We are up to about 24 percent of the docket is immigration. So this is a very different docket from what it was in 1991. Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. Let me just point out the statistic in your Table One, demographics, which I find appalling. All mandatory cases, you have a percentage of 32.9 percent African American, 38.2 percent Hispanic. Do you include the Hispanics as immigration cases? Judge Hinojosa. In that table we do. Ms. Jackson Lee. And so if we were to look at this from an issue that really faces America on a regular basis, we have got a lopsided, almost seemingly discriminatory approach here where we have over 60 percent almost--in fact, 70 percent, it looks like, of the defendants are mandatory--happen to be minorities. Is that accurate from your table? Judge Hinojosa. It is on this table. Ms. Jackson Lee. The one I am looking at. I know there are further explanations, but I just want to get that on the record. Judge Hinojosa. We also have to realize that up to 43 percent of the docket is Hispanic, which is a big difference from 10 or 15 years ago, because of the growth of the immigration docket, as both of us know living in the Southern District of Texas. Ms. Jackson Lee. Absolutely. Which clearly points to your issue of, let's review this, let's have the oversight of Congress. Thank you. Judge Cassell, you were very clear on the fact that the Judicial Conference wants to get back in the business of being judges. What is the single most important element of that message that you are getting? Why is it so important? Because some people are concerned that the abuse was going the other way, that you will--a judge, a southern judge of the 1960's, will throw the book at somebody who happens to be African American, let someone else walk. How do you respond to that? Judge Cassell. I think we want judges to be able to make the punishment fit the crime. The only way to do that is to give the judges the opportunity to assess an individual case, an individual crime, an individual offender. Now, you mentioned there may be some problems. We have in this country an appellate court system that, as the Supreme Court told us just a couple of days ago, can review the substantive decisions judges make at sentencing. I am a trial judge; if I make a mistake---- Ms. Jackson Lee. That appeal process."
