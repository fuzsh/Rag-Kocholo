He explores four obvious ways of meeting the challenges of the learned world: ignoring them, running away from them, agreeing with them, or meeting the opposition on their own grounds.\n\nKeywords: Mormon Studies\n\nSee also: “Nobody to Blame” (1960)\n\nID = [8378] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1960-08-03 Collections: farms-reports,nibley Size: 998 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:42\n\n1964\n\nNibley, Hugh W. “The Early Christian Church in the Light of Some Newly Discovered Papyri from Egypt.” Preliminary Report.

The Prophet brought forth many of the same concepts that are found in ancient temple libraries, such as the council in heaven during the premortal period, the casting out of Satan, the doctrine of the “two ways,” the fallen nature of mankind, and the need for a redeemer. Accompanying the doctrines is a body of rites or ordinances, and Nibley gives special attention to the Nag Hammadi documents.\n\nKeywords: Apocrypha; Pseudepigrapha; Dead Sea Scrolls\n\nID = [8370] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1964-01-01 Collections: farms-reports,nibley Size: 209 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:42\n\nNibley, Hugh W. “The Philosophical Implications of Automation.” Preliminary Report.

In other words, living the Word of Wisdom is not an issue in the world to come.

Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1980.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nThis presentation contains suggestions for interpreting various features found in the Pearl of Great Price facsimiles. Hugh Nibley notes that variations within stereotyped images, such as a person about to be sacrificed on the lion couch, can have widely divergent interpretations, thus leaving room for Joseph Smith’s interpretation of Abraham on the altar. Facsimile 2 can be compared to apocryphal books about Abraham that describe a cosmic journey with elements resembling certain features in the book of Abraham. The coronation scene in Facsimile 3 also shows authentic elements.\n\nKeywords: Pearl of Great Price; Abraham\n\nID = [8385] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1980-01-01 Collections: abraham,farms-reports,nibley Size: 209 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:42\n\nSmith, Robert F. “Shakespeare and the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report.

He gives evidence to support the claim that people inhabited the American continent for centuries before the arrival of the Nephites, that the Hill Cumorah was not too far away for Moroni to reach, and that the “fulness of iniquity” described in the Book of Mormon has much evidence in extant art from that time.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Archaeology\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Moroni\n\nID = [8369] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1980-07-13 Collections: bom,farms-reports,nibley Size: 209 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:42\n\n1981\n\nGillum, Gary P. “Hugh Nibley Quotes: Of the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report.

Sources suggest that in Israel, perhaps as early as the Second Temple period, laymen recited the Genesis creation story while priests were offering sacrifices. The laymen were expected to recite the account in towns far away from Jerusalem for the benefit of those who could not go to the holy city. Hearing about the creation enabled listeners to experience a renewal of creation in their own setting.\n\nKeywords: Old Testament; Ancient Israel\n\nTopics: Old Testament Scriptures > Genesis\n\nOld Testament Topics > Temple and Tabernacle\n\nID = [8575] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1981-01-01 Collections: farms-reports,old-test Size: 998 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\nTvedtnes, John A. “The Isaiah Variants in the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report.

This paper identifies certain principles evident in the relations between these nations and compares the principles found in the Book of Mormon with international practice of Ancient Israel in the old world. This paper is not want to be a study of the law of nations of the ancient Near East; rather, our purpose is to identify, if possible, principles of the law of nations in the Book of Mormon. Ccmparisons to the culture of the ancient Near East are not meant to function as proof (or disproof) of the old-world origin of the Book of Mormon culture. They should be taken as interesting illuminations of the principles of international relations which appear in the history of the ancient American nations.\n\nID = [8418] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1982-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports Size: 998 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:43\n\nEssig, Fred, and Dan Fuller. “Nephi’s Slaying of Laban: A Legal Perspective.” Preliminary Report. Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1982.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nFew passages in the Book of Mormon have inspired more criticism and moral outrage than the account of Nephi slaying the unconscious figure of Laban. Many point to this episode as evidence against the Book of Mormon being an inspired document. In this study we will attempt to examine the legal as well as the extra-legal ramifications of this incident. Since the law of ancient Israel was inexorably tied to the religious and moral code of the Israelites, any attempt to divorce the two would be patently artificial. Therefore, while this study will emphasize what we know about the operation of justice, that, by necessity implies a discussion of Israel’s relationship to her lawgiver, Yahweh. In analyzing this slaying, a determination must be made of which Hebrew law codes would most likely have applied during Nephi’s time. The Book of Mormon places the slaying between 592 and 598 B.C.1 The primary sources for Hebrew law of that time are the law codes of the Old Testament. They are three in number: the Code of the Covenant (Exodus 21-23:33), the Deuteronomic Code (which includes Deuteronomy 19), and the Priestly Code (which includes Numbers 35). Although there is some difference of opinion among scholars about the compilation dates of these various codes, the general consensus is that the Code of the Covenant was compiled before 800 B.C., the Deuteronomic Code around 700 B.C., and the Priestly Code in about 350 B.C.5 Comparing these dates to the date of slaying, it can be seen that the Code of the Covenant and the Deuteronomic Code were in existence before the time of the slaying and date in roughly the same time period as the slaying. The Priestly Code, however, was compiled after the exile in Babylon and almost 250 years after the slaying.\n\nID = [8350] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1982-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports Size: 998 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:42\n\nGillum, Gary P. “Complete Annotated Bibliography of Hugh Nibley’s Works.” Preliminary Report.

Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1983.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nSubmitting oneself to an ordeal was viewed in several ancient legal systems as a means of seeking a divine dispensation of judgment. The idea that justice will prevail in a contest between good and evil survives in the spontaneous schoolyard ordeal: “Cheaters never prosper” chant the children who win the replay after a dispute over whether the original ball was fair or foul. Piaget found that young children often believe that natural events are punishment for moral transgressions, while teenagers discard the idea of immanent justice in favor of mechanical chance.\n\nNearly every society has, at some time in its development, made formal use of the ordeal to test guilt and innocence, and nearly every society has used water as one of the mediums to reveal the truth--God’s judgment. This study examines the common elements of water ordeals in secular and scriptural contexts. An overview of trials by water is followed by specific analysis of water ordeals in the Near East generally, which in turn serves as background for detailing the literal and metaphorical water ordeals in the Old Testament, New Testament and Book of Mormon.\n\nTopics: Book of Mormon Scriptures > Ether\n\nID = [8542] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1983-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports Size: 998 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\n1984\n\nBlack, Susan Easton [as Susan Ward Easton]. “The Book Of Mormon: A Witness for Christ.” Preliminary Report.

Roberts wrote three papers that listed parallels between the Book of Mormon and the second edition (1825) of Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews and constructed the possible argument that the Book of Mormon relied upon the latter. Welch responds to that claim by listing over eighty discrepancies between the two works, and Palmer and Knecht rebut Roberts’s theory by using statistics to show that the passages of Isaiah quoted in both works do not lead to conclusions of plagiarism.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Answers to Criticisms\n\nID = [8408] Status = Type = journal article Date = 1985-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports,welch Size: 209 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:43\n\nNibley, Hugh W. “Approach to Facsimile II.” Preliminary Report.

John Tvedtnes argues that Joseph Smith did a good job of rendering, as closely as he could in English, an ancient text. He discusses instances where the English language used in the Book of Mormon reflects a Hebraic source.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Language\n\nID = [8609] Status = Type = talk Date = 1994-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports Size: 213 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\nWelch, John W. “Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report. Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1994. Transcript of a lecture presented as part of the FARMS Book of Mormon Lecture Series.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nResearch into literary forms in ancient scriptures led John Welch to the original discovery in 1967 of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon. In this lecture, he discusses chiasmus, a poetic form in which the first stanzas descend to a crucial midpoint and the rest of the passage parallels the first part in a mirror-like fashion. This artistic convention, although found in Greek, Latin, and English writings, was more highly developed in Semitic or Hebrew literary works. It was largely undetected until about the middle of the nineteenth century. Welch explains that for the trained eye the Book of Mormon abounds in chiasms ranging from simple to quite complex.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Literature\n\nID = [8619] Status = Type = talk Date = 1994-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports,welch Size: 213 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\nWelch, John W. “Christ and Temples in the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report.

Transcript of a lecture presented as part of the FARMS Book of Mormon Lecture Series and prepared by the staff of the Portland Institute of Religion.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nJohn Welch proposes that the mission of Christ and the significance of temples intersect in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon teaches the surpassing importance of the temple. There are twenty-seven explicit references to the temple in the Book of Mormon, as well as allusions to the temple found in words and phrases. Temple themes in the Book of Mormon can be better appreciated through an understanding of the law of Moses, including festivals and ritual observances.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Christ; temple\n\nID = [8620] Status = Type = talk Date = 1994-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports,welch Size: 213 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\nWelch, John W. “Ten Testimonies of Jesus Christ in the Book of Mormon.” Preliminary Report.

Transcript of a lecture given at the FARMS Book of Mormon Lecture Series.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nOne of the most important functions of the Book of Mormon is to convey to the modem world powerful testimonies of the divine mission and essential attributes of Jesus Christ. Many Book of Mormon prophets knew Jesus personally; therefore, their teachings and testimonies about him are based on firsthand knowledge and acquaintance. John Welch discusses ten of the prophets who testified of Christ.\n\nKeywords: Book of Mormon; Christ\n\nID = [8623] Status = Type = talk Date = 1994-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-reports,welch Size: 213 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:44\n\nTov, Emanuel. “The Hebrew Bible in the Dead Sea Scrolls.” Preliminary Report.
