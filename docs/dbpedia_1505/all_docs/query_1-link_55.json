        "text": "Air Force History\n\nJeannie Flynn became the first female fighter pilot in the Air Force on Feb. 10, 1994, after a change to official policy that previously precluded women from flying in combat. This led to many other firsts by female fighter, bomber and space shuttle pilots on multiple airframes.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 1996, after three-and-a-half years, Operation Provide Promise officially ended. This was the longest sustained international humanitarian airlift in history, up to 1996, and the U.S. Air Force flew more than 4,500 sorties to deliver 62,802 metric tons of cargo to Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia Herzegovina. Altogether, aircraft from 21 nations participated in the United Nations humanitarian airlift and flew nearly 13,000 sorties to deliver some 160,000 metric tons of supplies to Sarajevo.\n\nTerrorists bombed the Khobar Towers on June 25, 1996, near King Abdul-Aziz Air Base, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. Air Force members and injuring 300 other Americans. The Americans were participating in Operation Southern Watch to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. As a result of the bombing, most Air Force personnel in Saudi Arabia moved to more remote, easier-to-defend sites in the desert."
