The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Amy Klobuchar, presiding. Present: Senators Klobuchar, Durbin, and Grassley. Senator Durbin [presiding]. I am pleased to call this nominations hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee to order. I know that we have votes scheduled around 10:30, so we will do our best to accommodate everyone's schedule. I am stepping in here for Senator Klobuchar who will be arriving momentarily. I want to give a warm welcome to all the nominees. We also welcome family and friends who accompany them, and you will have an opportunity to introduce them shortly. We have five nominees under consideration today. First I want to call upon Senators Murray and Casey to introduce the nominees from their home States. Senator Patty Murray. PRESENTATION OF HON. SALVADOR MENDOZA, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, BY HON. PATTY MURRAY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON Senator Murray. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. It is my privilege today to introduce to this Committee Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr., who has been nominated by the President to be the next United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington. I want to welcome Judge Mendoza. His wife, Mia, is with him today; his mother, Maria; and his long- time legal assistant, Monica; who have traveled out here from what we call ``the other Washington.'' And I especially want to welcome to this Committee his mother, who is visiting our Nation's capital for the very first time to witness her son testify before this Committee as a nominee of the President of the United States. Maria, I know how proud you must be. And we are honored that she is with us today as well. Mr. Chairman, it is not every day that I get to introduce a nominee who also happens to be a former intern in my office. And it is also not every day that a man who is the son of a migrant farm worker and who himself worked on the farms in Yakima Valley is called on by the President to become the first Latino Federal judge in the Eastern District of Washington. So as a Senator from Washington State, I am incredibly proud to introduce him to this Committee today, because through his life's story, Judge Mendoza represents the very best of our State's honest, hardworking spirit. Madam Chairman, through his work ethic, his commitment to his community, and his belief in equal opportunity, Judge Mendoza is a leader and a role model for families throughout our State and particularly young men and women born into poverty and difficult circumstances. In fact, in his application to serve as Federal judge, he discussed his own upbringing, and I want to quote it to you. He said: ``I worked and studied hard to better myself and my family. I understood then what I believe now: that both the quality of the educational system coupled with a strong system of justice will lift up the entire community.'' Madam Chairman, I could not agree more, and it comes as no surprise that throughout his professional life, Judge Mendoza has stayed true to those words. From serving as a trustee for Columbia Basin College to helping coordinate the annual Tri- Cities Youth and Justice Conference, to helping to create the first drug court for Benton and Franklin counties, Judge Mendoza has given his time and experience investing in institutions that each and every day lift up communities throughout our State. He is currently a superior court judge, but his judicial career spans private practice, service as an Assistant Attorney General, and years of experience in superior, district, municipal, and juvenile court. He is an experienced practitioner in Federal court and served from 2010 to 2013 as lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference. And through his many years of legal practice and judicial experience, Judge Mendoza will come to the Federal bench well prepared. He has described his judicial philosophy as guided by the principles of patience, respect, and humility--the same principles that have guided his life and legal career and principles that will serve him well as a member of the Federal judiciary. So I want to thank Judge Mendoza for his willingness to serve Washington State as a Federal judge. I have said time and again that as a country we are best when good people are willing to give of themselves in service to others. It is service to others that has defined Judge Mendoza throughout his career and will continue to define him as he assumes the duty of this new office. I am very proud to be here today to support his nomination. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Klobuchar [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator Murray. Senator Casey, you are here to introduce Cheryl Ann Krause. PRESENTATION OF CHERYL ANN KRAUSE, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT BY HON. ROBERT P. CASEY, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Senator Casey. Madam Chair, thank you very much. I am honored to be here along with Senator Toomey to speak in favor of the nomination of Cheryl Ann Krause to be a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, one of our great circuits in the United States. I would say first that Cheryl's life has been a commitment to excellence, a commitment to public service, and I think it is a great American story of hard work and achievement. The academic credentials that she brings to this job are substantial. She attended Stanford University Law School. She clerked for--and the University of Pennsylvania, graduating summa cum laude, undergrad. I wanted to make sure I got that Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania academic credential in there. It is significant. After law school, Cheryl served Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court of the United States, later served as a prosecutor in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for 5 years, where, among other things, she was fighting public corruption cases and dealing with all kinds of prosecutions involving international bank fraud, securities fraud, all the range of prosecutorial achievements that she was able to amass in those years. I think also when you look at her work as a lawyer in the private sector, as a Federal prosecutor, it is a life and a degree of excellence that you often do not see. But I think it is infused by a deep and abiding commitment to public service. And when any of us make a determination about the person we should vote for on a district court or appellate court, we, of course, consider a range of credentials and questions. One, of course, is experience. I think when it comes to experience in the private sector or as a Federal prosecutor, as well as a whole other range of experiences, very few people would be able to outdistance what Cheryl brings to this nomination. Second, we ask that the nominees have the kind of commitment to public service and the integrity to serve as a judge on either the district or appellate court. And, third, I think--and these are broad categories, but we hope as well that they can be a judge that will not just judge fairly but will bring a judicial temperament to their work as a judge. I think on that measure as well Cheryl stands out. So I think whether it is a combination of academic credentials, her broad experience in the public and private sector, and especially her experience as a prosecutor, but I think overall a commitment to public service is the reason that I and so many others have decided to support her nomination with enthusiasm and with a degree of intensity that is, I think, pretty rare in this town. And I am grateful to have worked with Senator Toomey bringing this nomination forward, along with the White House and the Obama administration, and so we are grateful. And I will say finally that Cheryl's family is here. I know they will be introduced later. We are especially grateful they are here, led by Colonel Bradford R. Everman, her husband, who has made a deep commitment to the security of the United States, and we are grateful for his service as well. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator Casey. Senator Toomey. PRESENTATION OF CHERYL ANN KRAUSE, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT BY HON. PATRICK J. TOOMEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Senator Toomey. Thank you, and good morning, Chairman Klobuchar, Senator Grassley, Senator Durbin. Thanks very much for giving me this opportunity to help to introduce Cheryl Ann Krause. I would like to point out that she was nominated by President Obama on February 6th, and so I appreciate the timely scheduling of this hearing and the progress we are making. I also want to take a moment to thank Senator Casey for the collaborative efforts that he and I have engaged in. We have had eight successful confirmations since I have taken office. We still have two very well qualified district court nominees, Ed Smith and Gerald McHugh, who are awaiting Senate confirmation, which I hope will occur soon. And we have eight more district court vacancies that we are working on, but I would just point out that this is a case of some terrific bipartisan cooperation that is, in fact, making real progress for Pennsylvania, and I appreciate Senator Casey's work in this area. As Senator Casey has already described, Cheryl Ann Krause has a very, very impressive personal and professional background. She clearly has a wealth of legal experience in public service and private practice. Her commitment to the community has been very impressive. Her work for children with disabilities, a Penn Law School project that supervises law students representing indigent defendants. As Senator Casey pointed out, she comes from a family that is committed to public service, her husband having spent years as a fighter pilot for the U.S. military. When I met with Ms. Krause, I found her to be a very, very impressive candidate, clearly very, very intelligent, very knowledgeable about the law, a very thoughtful and careful person. I can tell you from the many folks with whom I have discussed her candidacy, she has an outstanding reputation in the legal community and beyond for excellence, for competence, and most importantly to me, for an impeccable character. So I am confident that she will make a strong addition to the Third Circuit court, and I thank this Committee for its time and hope that they favorably report out this nominee. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much to both of you. I know you want to stay for our entire hearing, but I am sure you have other business. Thank you for coming. Next, Senator Durbin, thank you for starting this hearing out. I had another commitment. He is here to introduce Staci Michelle Yandle, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois. PRESENTATION OF STACI MICHELLE YANDLE, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, BY HON. DICK DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am pleased to introduce Staci Yandle, nominated to serve as district court judge in the Southern District of my State. She has been nominated to fill the vacancy in the Benton courthouse when Judge Phil Gilbert assumes senior status on March 15th. Staci Yandle was born in Centreville, which, coincidentally, is the home town of my wife. That had nothing to do with her selection. [Laughter.] Senator Durbin. But it did not hurt. She currently lives in Carlyle. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois and her law degree from the Vanderbilt University School of Law. Over the course of her legal career, Ms. Yandle has gained extensive litigation experience. Currently she has her own solo practice in O'Fallon, Illinois, which she has operated since 2007, before that working for two prominent law firms in southern Illinois--Carr Korein Tillery and The Rex Carr Law Firm. Ms. Yandle has handled a wide variety of litigation matters, including employment, education, medical injury, civil rights, nursing home abuse. Most of her cases, she has either been sole counsel or lead counsel. She served as an arbitrator in the 20th Judicial Circuit Court in Illinois on approximately ten occasions. She was appointed to serve on the Illinois Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights from 1992 to 1996, and also appointed to serve by the Governor on the Illinois Gaming Board from 1999 to 2001; currently served on the board of the Illinois Bar Foundation; and she has also worked as an adjunct law professor at the St. Louis University School of Law; has a distinguished record of pro bono service in our area; spent over 50 hours per year representing indigent clients and nonprofit corporations, including the nonprofit Delta Economic Development Corporation, which operates a child- care center in my home county of St. Clair. Ms. Yandle's nomination is also historic in several respects. Never before in Illinois history has there been an Article III Federal judge who is openly a member of the LGBT community. Upon confirmation, Staci Yandle will be the first. Upon confirmation, she will also be the first African American Federal judge ever to serve in the Southern District of Illinois. And up to this point, no woman has ever served as a Federal judge in the Southern District. I believe that Ms. Yandle will be preceded by Nancy Rosenstengel, whose nomination is currently pending on the Senate floor, and she was the first woman ever nominated to serve on that court. In short, Staci Yandle's confirmation marks another important milestone in the journey toward equality of opportunity for all Americans. Ms. Yandle was recommended to me by a bipartisan screening committee that I established. I am pleased that she has been nominated here before the Committee today, and I am going to work with my colleagues to move her name through the confirmation process. One thing I want to note for the record which is very important only in southern Illinois, but extremely important in that place: Some are wondering what is going to happen to the Benton courthouse. I want to make it very clear that even after Judge Gilbert becomes a senior judge, I am committed to continuing the active status of a Federal judgeship in Benton, which Ms. Yandle will serve in that capacity if approved by the U.S. Senate. Finally, I will mention that Ms. Yandle is joined here today by her mother, Sylvia Yandle; her brother, Brian Yandle, and his wife, Sheila; and her nephew, Darell Yandle. Welcome to all. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator Durbin. We have a series of five votes that start at 10:30, and so we are going to change this up a little bit and have all of the nominees come up at the same time. And before that starts, I wanted to introduce Mr. Leon Rodriguez, who has been nominated to serve as Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Department of Homeland Security. He is currently the Director for the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He previously served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. He was born in Brooklyn, New York. Mr. Rodriguez earned his B.A. from Brown University in 1984 and his J.D. from Boston College Law School in 1988. I also know that both Senator Reid and Senator Heller are going to come in about 15 minutes to say some good words of introduction for Mr. Boulware, who is nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, and so we are looking forward to their coming to join our Committee. So we will have to make a little room or bring up some chairs when they join us. But before you all come up, Senator Grassley, did you have any words before we start? Senator Grassley. I will put it in the record. Senator Klobuchar. Excellent. [The prepared statement of Ranking Member Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. Okay. So why don't all the nominees come up, and we will swear you in. Okay. Do you want to stand? Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Ms. Krause. I do. Mr. Boulware. I do. Judge Mendoza. I do. Ms. Yandle. I do. Mr. Rodriguez. I do. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Thank you for being with us today, and we will start out with Ms. Krause. If you want to take a moment to introduce anyone from your family that is here with you today, we would love to meet them. STATEMENT OF CHERYL ANN KRAUSE, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT Ms. Krause. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar and Ranking Member Grassley, and thanks to the Committee for the opportunity to be considered today. My appreciation to both Senators Casey and Toomey for their gracious words and introduction, and also to the President for the profound honor of this nomination. With me in support today are many family and friends who have traveled from Pennsylvania and elsewhere. We have here my husband, Bradford Everman, who is my constant support and inspiration to public service. With me also are my son, Johnny, and 15-month-old Estelle, who, if left to their own devices, would have more to say to this Committee than me, and so I think will be excused shortly. Senator Klobuchar. She is looking good now, though. Ms. Krause. My sister, Elizabeth Krause, and her children, Zoe and Eli; my brother and sister-in-law, Aaron and Stephanie Krause, and their children, Sophie and Bryce; and many other family and friends who have come here. I would also like to note that coming from my firm Dechert are a number of partners and associates who are here supporting me and who are watching from afar, and I thank them all for their support. [The biographical information of Ms. Krause appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Mr. Boulware. STATEMENT OF RICHARD FRANKLIN BOULWARE II, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA Mr. Boulware. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Thank you to this Committee. Thank you to the Ranking Member as well for being here. I also want to thank my home State Senators, Senator Reid and Senator Heller. I want to thank Senator Reid for recommending me for this nomination, and I want to thank Senator Heller for his support. With me today I have family and friends. I have my family here: my brother and his wife, Yvette, and their daughter, Elizabeth. I have my father, Frederick Boulware, and his wife, Pamela Callahan; and, of course, I have my family, three very vibrant and young children: my youngest, Zafeen, who is back there, who I am sure you will hear talking; my son, Kahlil--she is 4 going on 35. [Laughter.] Mr. Boulware. My son, Kahlil, who is 5 years old, my oldest daughter, Oniana; and, of course, the love of my life and my partner, Nancy. The one person who is not here today is my mother, so I want to thank her, too. [The biographical information of Mr. Boulware appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. That is very nice. Very nice. And I do see that Senator Heller has arrived. He wants to say a few good words about you, and maybe he wants to settle in here, and we will have Mr. Mendoza, Judge Mendoza say a few words, and then we will go to Senator Heller, and he can say a few good words about Mr. Boulware. Judge Mendoza, good to see you. STATEMENT OF HON. SALVADOR MENDOZA, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON Judge Mendoza. Thank you. Good morning, and I would really like to thank the Committee for scheduling this hearing so promptly after the nomination. I want to thank, of course, Senator Murray for those kinds words that she had this morning, and also Senator Cantwell for her continued support. Along with them, of course, I would like to thank Governor Inslee for his support as well. I would like to thank President Obama for this incredible nomination, this incredible opportunity. I am certainly honored. Here with me today is my wife, who is an excellent lawyer, an excellent wife, and an incredible mother. Senator Klobuchar. Which one is your wife? I see three women with smiles. [Laughter.] Judge Mendoza. The people that are not here are my three children: Carmen, who is 4; my son, Danny, who is 6, and Anthony, who today turns 9 years old, so Happy Birthday, Anthony, if you are watching. And an important person in my life who is here with me is my mother. My father and she--my father passed away in 2008, but both of those two individuals taught me an in credible amount of what it means to be a good human being, and I appreciate that. Also with me today is my long-time legal assistant, Monica Villanueva, who is not only my legal assistant but a very good friend of mine. Also, I have my three brothers who are not here, were not able to make the trip: Hector, who is taking care of my three kids and Josey; and my brothers, Robert--Bobby--and Raul. The person who is also not here is my sister, who passed away a year and a half ago, but I know that she is with me at this moment, and when I lost her, I lost my best friend, and I just would like her name to be in the record. My friends who are home watching, I appreciate them, especially Norma Rodriguez, Mario Anteriano, and Scott Johnson. I would also like to thank my colleagues on the superior court bench who have been amazing supporters and mentors. Also, my friends at the Supreme Court, State of Washington, Justice Gonzalez, Justice McCloud, and Justice Johnson, who have been very strong supporters. Additionally, and finally, I would like to thank the Federal bench of the Eastern District of Washington, especially Chief Judge Peterson, Judge Suko, and Judge Shea. Thank you. [The biographical information of Judge Mendoza appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much. Senator Heller, you are here to say a few good words about Mr. Boulware. PRESENTATION OF RICHARD FRANKLIN BOULWARE II, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA, BY HON. DEAN HELLER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Heller. I am. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and also to the Ranking Member, Mr. Grassley, for holding this meeting. And I want to congratulate all the nominees who are here with us today. Congratulations, Richard. It is good to see you again. Mr. Boulware. Thank you, Senator. It is good seeing you as well. Senator Heller. Judicial nominations and subsequent confirmations for qualified individuals are one of the most important and unique responsibilities we hold as Members of the U.S. Senate. Through the role of advice and consent, I believe each nominee must be carefully considered, and I am pleased to say that I believe we are continuing to accomplish this goal in this Congress through bipartisan support. In Nevada, where our delegation is certainly not one-sided, it is critical for us to work together to find qualified candidates who will uphold America's principles of impartiality under the law. I believe Mr. Boulware embodies these characteristics and serves as an example that, with a bilateral effort, we can find middle ground in instances where it is necessary. That being said, I believe Richard Boulware will make an excellent district court judge for the State of Nevada. After sitting down with him, discussing his nomination at length, I found him to be an extremely impressive nominee. A graduate of Harvard University, Mr. Boulware went on to earn his law degree from Columbia University in 2003. He currently serves as Assistant Public Defender, Federal Public Defender for the District of Nevada in Las Vegas. He also has extensive experience arguing before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This trial experience, coupled with his impressive academic accomplishments while clerking for the U.S. district court, I believe will serve him well on the bench. Outside of his professional duties, he is currently serving his local school system as a member of the Superintendent's Educational Opportunities Advisory Committee. Again, congratulations, and thank you again for the opportunity, Madam Chairwoman, for introduced this Nevadan, outstanding Nevadan, to this Committee, and I look forward to his testimony as well as the Committee's consideration for Mr. Boulware's nomination. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator. Ms. Yandle. STATEMENT OF STACI MICHELLE YANDLE, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS Ms. Yandle. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. I would like to thank you, Madam Chair, Ranking Member Grassley, and Members of this Committee for scheduling this hearing and allowing us the opportunity to speak with you today. I would like to thank Senator Durbin for his introduction and for his support. I certainly would like to thank President Obama for his nomination and for this honor. I would also like to thank various members of my community, my friends, family, who are not in the room with us today, but I certainly want to thank them for their continued support. I would like to thank and introduce the members of my family who are in the room with me today: first and foremost, my mother, Sylvia Yandle, who traveled here with me from southern Illinois. I would like to thank my brother and my sister-in-law--I actually normally refer to her as my sister, but we are on the record and I will be technically correct. She is my sister-in-law, Sheila Yandle. They traveled here from North Carolina; and my nephew, Darell, who traveled here from Detroit. I would also like to acknowledge and thank someone else who is not in the room. That is my father, Robert Yandle, who is deceased, and, frankly, has been deceased for quite some time, but who is ever present with me, and he is certainly--I feel his presence today, and I would like to acknowledge that as well. Thank you. [The biographical information of Ms. Yandle appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Ms. Yandle. Mr. Rodriguez. STATEMENT OF LEON RODRIGUEZ, NOMINEE TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Rodriguez. Thank you, Chairwoman, and what a great honor it is to be here this morning. I want to start by acknowledging my spectacular wife, Dr. Jill Schwartz. She is a research physician dedicated to the eradication of some of the most devastating diseases that we face in our society. I would also like to acknowledge my children: Talia and Elias Rodriguez, who are in the center aisle here today. Also with me today is former CIS Director, actually the founding Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Eduardo Aguirre, who was appointed by President Bush to stand up the new agency, along with his Deputy Director, Michael Petrucelli. Also here are our good friends Bicky Borman and Gerald Kell, and my current chief of staff, Juliet Choi. I would like to acknowledge the members of my staff from the Office for Civil Rights, some of whom I know are watching us this morning. And, finally, I would like to acknowledge my parents, who are watching us from Rody, Incorporated, in Miami, the small business they started in 1966. That business is still alive and well today, and Isaac and Sara Rodriguez are watching us as they do their work. And, finally, I would like to salute the great American stories of the other nominees here today. Their stories illustrate the long road that we all travel to days like this one, and it is stories like theirs that really inspire me to do hopefully, in the event of my confirmation, a job like Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is such a great path to offer opportunities to new Americans. So thank you, Chairwoman, for this great opportunity. [The biographical information of Mr. Rodriguez appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you so much, Mr. Rodriguez. We welcome your family. We welcome all the nominees' families. And now we have our Majority Leader, kind of the head of our family, Majority Leader Reid here to say some good words about Mr. Boulware. PRESENTATION OF RICHARD FRANKLIN BOULWARE II, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA, BY HON. HARRY REID, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Reid. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have had the good fortune over the years to be able to appoint people to different positions. I do not know how many judges, but 10 or so in Nevada. And it is always very difficult when family members are involved in a selection because you are always afraid: Am I showing too much favoritism? Is the person really qualified? Well, in this instance, I have known his Mom and Dad for many, many years, and they should be very proud of him, as I am, because his qualifications are unparalleled. This is a good man and a good candidate to be a judge for life. I am happy to introduce to the Committee Richard Boulware. He is an intelligent, talented young lawyer, and I have no doubt he will distinguish himself as a judge. He has worked very hard. He is the first African American man to be on the Federal bench in Nevada, but not the first African American. He has some really big shoes to fill with Johnnie Rawlinson, who was on the district court, as she has now really distinguished herself on the Ninth Circuit. He has been a public defender in Nevada since 2007. Before that, he was a public defender in New York for 4 years, worked at the prestigious firm of Covington and Burling in New York. He grew up in Las Vegas, attended Harvard University as an undergraduate, and then took some time off. He checked out the private sector. He clerked for a district court judge in the Southern District of New York, and prior to entering law school, he owned a consulting business. He told me the reason he decided to go back to school, to go to law school, is he was watching impeachment proceedings on television of President Clinton, and he said, ``I need to be a part of that, part of the legal profession.'' And so that is what he did. He went back to law school, Columbia, where he distinguished himself as a great scholar, a good student. He is really well qualified in every aspect. And he is not just naked from being in the court all the time. He has entered public service in many different ways: a leadership role in the NAACP in Las Vegas; he has also served as a volunteer attorney for U.S. Vets, an organization that serves homeless veterans of the armed forces since 2009. I would hope there were not homeless vets in Nevada, but that is not true. There are lots of them. It is commendable that he would devote his time to help these people who are really in need. He is past president of the Las Vegas chapter of the National Bar Association, has extensive experience trying criminal cases in the Federal court system. I have talked to many of the Federal judges who understand what an advocate he is for the rights of the accused. He has received the Medal of Justice Award from the State Bar of Nevada. He received the Dedicated Service Award last year from the Nevada Attorney General's Criminal Justice Program. So I am very impressed with him, and I know that he will be an outstanding judge. And I feel very good and proud of him and his family, most of whom are here today. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Majority Leader Reid. Okay. Senator Reid. I was afraid Senator Grassley was going to ask me some questions. [Laughter.] Senator Klobuchar. Yes, I know. Senator Grassley--can the reflect Senator Grassley is very good at asking questions. He asks a lot of questions. But that is not the case. You can leave and do your duties, Majority Leader Reid. Okay. We are going to begin here, and the reason Senator Grassley was talking to me was just about making sure that Senator Durbin would go after me, and then he was going to allow him to go after I do. And, in fact, Senator Durbin, maybe you want to go first. That is fine. All right. I am going to start here with you, Ms. Krause, and I am a former prosecutor like you, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you think that experience will impact you on the bench. And also the pro bono work that you do, if you could talk about that. Ms. Krause. Yes, thank you very much, Senator. If I may, as a preliminary matter, I realize in my excitement to be here I omitted two of perhaps the most important people in the room: my parents, Robert and Marilyn Krause. Senator Klobuchar. Good call. [Laughter.] Ms. Krause. They have made the trip here from Pennsylvania as well, and it is a great joy to me to be able to share this day with them. Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Ms. Krause. Yes, Senator, I did serve as a prosecutor for many years, and I have continued with public service through my pro bono work in private practice. As a prosecutor, I had the opportunity to do both trial and appellate work, and that has given me a great appreciation for the importance of the record, how to read a transcript, issues of credibility of witnesses and motion practice in the district court, many of the things that, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as an appellate judge, will give me a good foundation for reviewing and understanding the record. I think further in both that commitment to public service and the honor there of serving as a representative of the United States, I was held to highest ethical standards and, of course, a mandate on prosecutors to think not only as an advocate, which, of course, is an important part of that job, but also the mandate to do justice. And if I have the privilege of serving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, of course, being fair, impartial, seeing all sides, and serving the public with the highest ethical standards would be paramount. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. Mr. Boulware, you also served as a public defender, and could you talk about that experience and how that will help you on the bench? Mr. Boulware. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for the question. I think one of the things that it has given me an opportunity to do the most is participate in criminal trials. I have participated in at least 15 Federal criminal trials, including jury and non-jury trials, in two different districts, in both the District of New York and the District of--the Southern District of New York and the District of Nevada. I have also been able to participate in a variety of different types of Federal cases from white-collar complex cases, which I have been the lead attorney on with respect to my office for the past 3 years, but a variety of different types of cases that come to the public defender's office. So I believe that diversity of experience, in particular the trial experience, as my nomination is for a trial court, I believe all of that, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, will serve me well as a district court judge. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. You also should note you were born in Rochester, Minnesota, since I had no one to introduce-- -- Mr. Boulware. Yes, I was born---- Senator Klobuchar. The home of the great Mayo Clinic. Mr. Boulware. Yes, I was born actually at the Mayo Clinic. Senator Klobuchar. You had a good hospital. Mr. Boulware. Yes. Senator Klobuchar. Excellent. It worked out well for you. Okay. Judge Mendoza, as a judge, do you want to talk a little bit about how being a judge, your current job as judge is going to differ from this one? Judge Mendoza. Thank you, Senator, for that question. Yes, as a judge currently, one of the duties that I have is being civil presiding judge for both of our counties, in Benton and Franklin County. As a practitioner, I primarily handled criminal law, so it is important to have both the criminal law experience and the civil law experience, and that will suit me well, if I am confirmed to this position. I think it is also important to note that I was a deputy prosecutor and an Assistant Attorney General, and I think those experiences would also help me. I think it is important to bring a wealth of experience to the position. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Ms. Yandle, I have a feeling that Senator Durbin is going to ask you a question. Would that be right? Good. So I am going to use the remaining time that I have to ask Mr. Rodriguez a few questions. Again, it is an important job that you are going to be taking here. USCIS is an agency of 18,000 employees and contractors. Can you talk about how your management experience as county attorney and other positions is going to help you out there? Mr. Rodriguez. I appreciate that question. In particular, as county attorney for Montgomery County, I was on the senior leadership team of a county with a $2 billion annual budget, a $2 billion capital budget, 10,000 employees, an organization that had much of the same complexity as Citizenship and Immigration Services does. My prosecutorial positions really prepared me for the fraud investigation aspects and the national security aspects of the CIS Director's job. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. And I have a specific concern, and maybe you heard about this, about the plans to move--and this was, of course, before you were in your job--the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service office in Minnesota from its current location near The Mall of America, which is a very accessible location--accessible by bus, accessible by light rail, one of the biggest shopping malls in the country actually. And it obviously was a good location, and what your office decided to do or your soon-to-be office was that they moved the location, and it would be 3 miles from a metro transit stop. Obviously a lot of people that use this service do not have cars, and they are not able to afford cabs. And it has actually become quite an issue. Our newspaper, our major newspaper has editorialized about it a number of times, and the worst part about it, Mr. Rodriguez, is I like that they told the truth, but the GSA admitted that they actually made a mistake. They thought they saw a sign for a bus, and they thought it was a real public transit bus, but it was just some private bus service that hardly goes there. And so it is a glaring error, and last year, this office had 28,000 visitors, processed more than 13,000 applications for naturalization, and they have already now gotten a contract with this new place, and it is a huge problem. Could you commit to working with me and the GSA to address these concerns about what is happening here? Because it is kind of an outrage. Mr. Rodriguez. I can assure the Senator, first, that I am aware of the situation and that I can commit to working with you to find a resolution. In my current job, the work we do is all about accessibility to Government services, and so this is really core to my professional identity to tackle these sorts of issues. Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Well, I appreciate that. I am looking forward to working with you on it. With that, we will turn it over to Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin. Thanks a lot, Senator Klobuchar. Let me for the record ask my nominee here, Staci Yandle, a question. I am familiar with your career and what you have done, and you have spent a lot of time representing the little guy, plaintiffs trying to recover in lawsuits where the odds are against them, pro bono defendants and clients, and folks who are usually considered to be the least likely to succeed under our system of justice. And that is one of the things that attracts me to you, and you know that. When Chief Justice John Roberts had his confirmation hearing before the Committee, here is what he said: ``If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win in a court before me. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then the big guy is going to win.'' What do you think of Chief Justice Roberts' statement? Ms. Yandle. I think his statement is absolutely correct, and I think that is the proper role of a district court judge. It would be certainly what I would value as well. Based on my years of experience, as you mentioned, Senator, trying cases on behalf of plaintiffs, it has given me actually a very keen appreciation for the importance of impartiality and judicial integrity. I have gotten that appreciation from the other side of the bench. And so it is extremely important, and I agree with what Justice Roberts said. If confirmed, and in any matter that comes before me, based on the law and the applicable precedent, should, as you put it, the little guy win based on the law, they will; and should the corporation prevail based on the law, they will. Senator Durbin. One of the questions asked of you by Senator Kirk--and we were all together yesterday when he asked this question--was about a constitutional amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the role of the Federal Government, the role of the States, and it is something that we talk about night and day around here as part of the ongoing conversation. And he asked what your approach would be, what your views would be as a district court judge on that amendment. Ms. Yandle. Yes, and that was the Tenth Amendment, which guarantees, of course, the rights to the State where there is an absence of Federal right. And what I indicated was I have not engaged in any type of constitutional analysis about the strength or weakness of the Tenth Amendment. However, the Tenth Amendment as well as any other part of the Constitution, if there were a matter to come before me if I were confirmed, I would look first for Supreme Court guidance. Lacking that, I would look for any guidance from the Seventh Circuit. And I would certainly apply the law. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Mr. Rodriguez, it was 13 years ago when I introduces a bill called the DREAM Act in this Committee, and my cosponsor was Senator Orrin Hatch. It has been a long, long journey. Four years ago, I wrote a letter to President Obama, co-signed by Senator Lugar; a year later another letter, co-signed by, I believe, a dozen of my colleagues. In each of those, I asked for the President to consider an Executive order that would spare the DREAM Act-eligible young people in America from deportation. The President issued that Executive order, and it is known as DACA, and it defers deportation of those eligible for the DREAM Act, specifically those who came to the United States under the age of 16 and who have no serious criminal record, finished high school, and at least hold out the promise to be real assets to this Nation. Well, we are now moving forward with that, and some still criticize it. In fact, there has even been a vote in the House of Representatives to repeal this DACA provision, the Executive order of the President. A half million have come forward, roughly, and signed up with the Government, registered as promised, and now are leading otherwise normal lives. I just was told that nine of them have been admitted to medical school in the city of Chicago. I was with another just a week ago who is now a teacher in the suburbs of Chicago. They have been given their chance. I would like to ask you two things. First, what is your view about this prosecutorial discretion as it relates to DACA or other deportations? And, second, will you be prepared when the 2-year period ends and these and many others who have been given DACA seek renewal to have the administrative resources there so they can do that in a timely fashion? Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, I really appreciate your calling attention to the many wonderful young people who have participated in the DACA program. They speak to the great American promise that I discussed during my opening statement. These are students, these are strivers. And as you have observed many of them are now pursuing professions; a number of them have indicated their interest in serving in our armed forces if that opportunity were to become available to them. And so I certainly will commit to doing everything that I can and having the goal, in the hopeful event of my confirmation, to making that process work and to finding the appropriate resources to making that process work. Thank you. Senator Durbin. If I could do one followup, the question was raised about the critics have said the President did not have the authority to issue this Executive order. I have felt that the issue of prosecutorial discretion has been fairly clear in the past. In fact, justice Kennedy recently said, ``A principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.'' This is from Justice Kennedy in a recent case striking down one of the controversial Arizona immigration laws. Would you comment on this issue of prosecutorial discretion? Mr. Rodriguez. Well, certainly I have spent a significant portion of my career as a prosecutor, primarily in the criminal justice context, in some cases in administrative context as well. There is prosecutorial discretion in all of those contexts. It is not unlimited. It is not uncabined. But there is prosecutorial discretion that would apply in all of the contexts that the Senator is describing. Thank you. Senator Durbin. Thank you. Thanks to all the nominees. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator Durbin. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I will start with you, Ms. Krause. First of all, congratulations to all of you. I would have said that in my statement, but I put it in the record. Senator Durbin. Is your microphone on? Senator Grassley. My microphone is on, yes. Maybe I am not--you can always hear me. You have written about conditions of supervised release that courts have imposed on convicted cyber criminals and argued that restrictions on cyber criminals' Internet use was extreme in certain cases. So then the question: Under what circumstances do you believe it is appropriate for courts to require a cyber criminal to obtain permission before possessing or using an Internet-capable device like a computer or a smartphone? Ms. Krause. Thank you, Senator. That article was one summarizing the law of many different circuits and pointing out that in some cases there had been complete bans that had been overturned; whereas, the standard--and certainly the standard articulated by the Third Circuit in United States v. Freeman-- is that there be a relationship of the least restrictive necessary to serve the penological interest. I think that those restrictions would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and they may range from needing to seek permission or limited restrictions up to and including a complete ban in certain cases like the Mitnick case, which I described in that article as well. Senator Grassley. Okay. Now, you are just going to love when I ask you about something you wrote when you were a third- year law student. That would be your views on Title VII, reviews in which you stated your belief that, ``Discrimination remains a widespread social problem.'' Basically you said that although overprejudice was gone, a more subtle form of discrimination still persists. Based on that you, argued that a certain affirmative difference, the after-acquired-evidence defense, should be limited in Title VII cases. Now, I already recognize that you wrote that as a law student, but I would like to know whether your views have changed since 1993. Do you still believe that discrimination remains a widespread social problem? Ms. Krause. Senator, that article from 1994 related to the use of the after-acquired-evidence defense, and I still believe that Title VII should be enforced. It is the enactment of Congress' considered policy determination that there remains the need for protection of civil rights, including in the workplace. The position that I took there that it was Congress' view that the protections as embodied in Title VII still needed to be pursued ultimately was adopted by the Supreme Court in McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Company, where, I might add, they actually cited to that article. I believe as a judge, if I have the privilege of being confirmed, that issues about Title VII would need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis, considering the applicable law and Supreme Court precedent, as well as Third Circuit precedent, applied to the facts of the particular case or controversy that might come before me. Senator Grassley. Do you have happen to believe that whether or not affirmative defenses that courts have recognized in Title VII cases should be limited or unavailable in order to combat discrimination in society? Ms. Krause. I do not have a view on that as a general matter, Senator. With that particular affirmative defense, the Supreme Court concluded, consistent with the EEOC and others that had looked at the issue, that it was not appropriate for that to be used as a complete defense, although it did cutoff damages. Senator Grassley. So you would follow the Supreme Court? That is an obvious answer. Ms. Krause. Senator, I would follow the Supreme Court in that, as in all things, if I have the honor of being confirmed. Senator Grassley. One last question that I offer a lot of judges, both district as well as circuit, or even Supreme Court nominees. You have had a distinguished career as a lawyer and appellate advocate, but never served in a judicial capacity. Lawyers use many resources in formulating arguments that judges might necessarily rely on in deciding your cases. So then this is about the issue of whether or not you as a judge ever think it is proper to rely on foreign law or on views of the world community, as some judges have stated it, in determining the meaning of the Constitution or Federal statutes. Ms. Krause. Thank you, Senator. No, I view the U.S. Constitution as well as statutes of Congress, of course, as domestic law, and I would look to domestic law sources to interpret them. I am aware that in certain cases, for example, in discussing the jury system, the Supreme Court on occasion has looked to British common law and referred to foreign law in some circumstances. Obviously, I would abide by the precedent of the Supreme Court in the holdings of those cases, but my approach, if I am confirmed would be to apply to domestic sources of interpretation to U.S. law. Senator Grassley. For the district nominees, I am going to submit questions in writing, and I am now going to go to Mr. Rodriguez. So if you would answer those when we submit them, I would appreciate it. [The questions of Ranking Member Grassley appear as submissions for the record.] Senator Grassley. Mr. Rodriguez, you were a board member of CASA de Maryland, a group that advocates for Latinos and immigrants. While I have strong disagreement over some of the stances that this organization has taken over the years regarding immigration policy, I would like to discuss several events that occurred while you were on the board, and especially in light of the job that you have been nominated for. While you were a member of that board, the organization published a booklet entitled, ``Warning: Protect Yourself from Immigration Raids.'' That was March 2007. The booklet was designed to inform undocumented workers how to avoid or minimize the chance of triggered lawful deportation proceedings. It encouraged undocumented workers not to give law enforcement a name of an individual, even while acknowledging that it is a crime in some jurisdictions not to do that. Some press accounts also noted how illustrations could be perceived as disparaging law enforcement. So my question: As a board member, did you have any knowledge of this booklet before it was published in March 2007? Then I will go on to another question. Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, I was not aware of that publication. Senator Grassley. Thank you. After the booklet was reported in the press, did you take any steps, either privately or publicly, to encourage the organization to retract the pamphlet? Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, what I might point out is that actually I separated from board service in May 2007. When I became county attorney for Montgomery County, I discontinued basically all of my nonprofit involvements at that time. So I did not become aware of this publication, Senator, honestly until you referenced it today. Senator Grassley. So you were gone 2 months after it was published. Mr. Rodriguez. That is correct. Senator Grassley. Okay. Let me go on then. As a board member, that organization, CASA, entered a lawsuit filed on behalf of undocumented immigrants. That lawsuit sought to prevent Maryland's Motor Vehicle Administration from complying with the Federal law REAL ID Act. That Act was enacted following September the 11th and was one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Among other things, it required States to strengthen their identity verification procedures to ensure State forms of identification could be used for Federal purposes, such as boarding an aircraft. Do you personally oppose the REAL ID Act? Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, I do not have a specific opinion on the REAL ID Act. Certainly if those are questions that this body is considering, I would look forward to working with the Senator in the hopeful event of my confirmation to discuss that Act. Senator Grassley. Well, this might be an easier one for you to answer. Do you believe that States should fully comply with the Federal law, the Federal REAL ID Act? Mr. Rodriguez. It is certainly my view, and a core part of what I did as county attorney advising Montgomery County, that States and localities should comply with Federal law. And certainly whatever Federal law there might be, it is my view that States and localities are obligated to comply with those laws. Senator Grassley. Okay. And then I think that answer probably applies to this question, but let me ask it anyway. Do you believe a State that is attempting to comply early with an upcoming Federal mandate deadline should be prevented from compliance until the 11th hour? Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, it is difficult to specifically-- without knowing all the facts applicable to a particular situation, it is difficult to offer a legal judgment on whether the Federal Government does or does not have the authority in the context that you describe. All of these situations tend to be factbound, and so I would not venture to offer an opinion on that subject today. Senator Grassley. Okay. Now, here is one that I think you can answer. If confirmed, you will have to help enforce the immigration law. Even though the REAL ID law is not under the jurisdiction of the Customs and Immigration Service, you may play a role in its continued implementation. If confirmed, will you use your position as Director to administratively obstruct the REAL ID law? Mr. Rodriguez. Senator, you can have my assurance that in my role as CIS Director I will uphold the laws of the United States. Senator Grassley. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about congressional oversight. While you were chief of staff at Civil Rights, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conducted an investigation into the decision to decline to prosecute a case from Philadelphia concerning racial intimidation of voters on election day. On May 14, 2010, then Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez testified before the Commission and answered questions concerning this inquiry. In regard to your working with him, did you help prepare Mr. Perez for his testimony before the Commission that day? Mr. Rodriguez. I was part of the team. I did not play a central role in preparing him for his testimony. Senator Grassley. At one point in the questioning, a Commissioner asked Mr. Perez whether any political leadership was involved in the decision not to pursue this particular case of voter intimidation. Mr. Perez responded, ``No.'' However, a FOIA lawsuit later revealed that the Department of Justice was aware of more than 50 emails between political appointees and career attorneys regarding the Government's ``decisionmaking process'' to decline to prosecute the case. A Federal judge even commented that these internal DOJ documents ``appeared to contradict Assistant Attorney General Perez's testimony before the Commission that political leadership was not involved.'' That is what the judge said in the decision to dismiss this case. At the time of Mr. Perez's testimony, then, the question to you is: Were you aware of these emails' existence? Mr. Rodriguez. I am aware generally about--is my--I am on. I am aware generally of the issue that the Senator describes. It was my understanding that the decisions were made by career staff that there certainly were communications with political leadership about the decisionmaking process that was being undertaken at that particular point in time by the career staff. That is my general understanding. I am not specifically aware of the context of the emails that the Senator describes. Senator Grassley. Also during this investigation, the Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division refused to comply with the Commission's lawful subpoenas. Were you involved in the deliberation to refuse to honor the Commission's subpoenas? Mr. Rodriguez. I actually--I was involved in the process of gathering large numbers of documents and information to comply with the Commission's subpoena. And my recollection is we delivered thousands of pages of documents to the Commission. Senator Grassley. Here is a question that is very important to me because I concentrate on oversight as a Member of Congress. Do you believe that it is acceptable for an agency or agent of the Federal Government to refuse to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena? Mr. Rodriguez. No, I do not believe that it is within the authority of a Federal agency to refuse to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena. I do note that there are occasions where there are certain constitutional and statutory privileges that may shield certain information or documents from production, and I would assume that when those privileges are asserted, they are asserted in good faith. Senator Grassley. Let me ask you this next question, but let me preface it with something like this, that in all the years I have been in Congress, there is not a person like you or anybody else that has come before us for a political appointee that has not always said yes, will you respond to our letters, will you come before us to testify, will you cooperate with oversight, all those things. And invariably they never live up to it. So what is your view of the oversight authority of Congress? Mr. Rodriguez. So I think the Senator's question is how can I assure you that I mean it when I say that. Is that correct, Senator? [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. Yes. Thank you for understanding me. [Laughter.] Mr. Rodriguez. And I think particularly for an agency like USCIS, where the role that we play touches every single State, every single congressional district, I think our partnership with this body and with the House of Representatives is really critical, one, to our discharge of our duties as an executive agency, but really our ability to effectively do our business as Citizenship and Immigration Services. I need you to fully understand what we are doing, the challenges that we face, the opportunities that we are seeking. And so I really view it as in the interest--in the hopeful event of my confirmation, in the interest of my agency to have an open relationship with your office and to provide you the information that you need to fulfill your oversight role. Senator Grassley. You know, this may sound like I think this is a problem just with this administration. Do you understand, I think this is a problem throughout Republican and Democrat administrations, and there is a culture in these administrations to thumb their nose at the Congress, not to respond any more than they have to, have to write five or six letters before you really get the answers you want. I have had people at the start of this administration before I even knew what this administration might do, give a whole file of letters unanswered from the Bush administration that I thought surely they would help us get answered so that they would not be blamed for not answering our letters, you know. My last question on another subject. You told Senator Durbin that you would put more resources into DACA. That tells me you will continue the program. Will you expand the program beyond its current form? And, second, news reports have suggested that DACA has taken resources away from other immigration programs, including family and employment visas. Are you saying DACA does not have enough resources today? Won't adding more just harm other programs further? Mr. Rodriguez. Yes, well, what I meant to say in responding to Senator Durbin's question is that we will do what we need to do to make sure across the board, throughout our functions as Citizenship and Immigration Services, that we have the resources that we need, that we are efficiently allocating the resources that we have to discharge all of our functions, and that we discharge our obligations as to all of our lines of business. I was not meaning to forecast the future of DACA or to say what I would do in the future about DACA. I cannot prejudge those situations without yet being confirmed, and I do hope that I will be confirmed. What I can say is that if I am confirmed, I view it as part of my stewardship of the agency to make sure that the agency is proper resourced to do everything that it does and that no one line of business suffers over any other line of business. Senator Grassley. Okay. You have answered my questions well. I may not agree with you. You may have too much leeway in some instances. But if you answer my letters, you are going to satisfy me more than a lot of---- [Laughter.] Mr. Rodriguez. So, Senator, you should also know that I have a particular--I am a former false claims prosecutor, and so I wanted to take an opportunity---- Senator Grassley. You are okay then. [Laughter.] Mr. Rodriguez. Well, I wanted to thank you for your leadership on the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act. Senator Grassley. Well, thank you. And thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you, Senator Grassley. Has anyone else done anything with false claims? No, you do not have to answer. That is fine. I want to thank you all--and, Mr. Rodriguez, I just wanted to put something on the record, and we do not have to go into it. Maybe we can later in writing. But Congresswoman Ros- Lehtinen from the House of Representatives, a Republican, put in a good letter of support for you and your nomination, and specifically mentioned the work that Senator Grassley had asked about with CASA de Maryland and your good work there, and I wanted to put this on the record, and just wondered why you got involved in that organization and the kind of work that you saw yourself as doing in the organization. I know Senator Grassley had a serious question about a booklet and some things, but I am giving you that chance to talk a little bit about the organization. Mr. Rodriguez. I come to really my entire professional and personal life with the perspectives that came from being the son of immigrants. My parents came here fleeing from the Castro dictatorship in Cuba. My grandparents actually went to Cuba fleeing anti-Semitism and poverty in Turkey and Poland. So it is profoundly part of our identity as a family to understand what it means to be starting fresh in a new country, what those hardships are. And so I always have an affinity to any enterprise, be it a Government agency of 18,000 people or a small community nonprofit, to support people who are trying to pull themselves up by their boot straps and make a good life here in America and to help their families realize the dreams of this country. So those are really my motivations. Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you. That was a very nice way to end this excellent hearing. I know many of you are pursuing your dreams in these jobs, and we want to thank you for your patience here with our rather interrupted proceeding here and there. And also your family members, I did not hear any babies crying. I do not know what happened to that baby, but I do not know, fell asleep, whatever. And we want to thank you for being here, and we will keep the record open for a week for further questions, and this hearing is adjourned. Thank you, and thank you, Senator Grassley. [Whereupon, at 10:39 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Additional material submitted for the record follows.] A P P E N D I X Additional Material Submitted for the Record [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] NOMINATIONS OF HON. BETH BLOOM, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA; PAUL G. BYRON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA; HON. DARRIN P. GAYLES, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA; AND HON. CARLOS EDUARDO MENDOZA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA ---------- TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Christopher Coons, presiding. Present: Senators Coons and Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER COONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE Senator Coons. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to call this nominations hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to order. I would like to welcome each of our four nominees, their families and friends, to the U.S. Senate and congratulate them on their nominations. I would also like to welcome Senator Nelson, who is here to introduce the nominees, and we may well be joined by Senator Rubio. Today there are 83 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. This is an unacceptably high number. Over 5 years into this administration, the Federal bench still sits nearly 10 percent vacant, a 70-percent increase in the number of vacancies since the President took office. The result is that Americans are getting less justice and more slowly. In some districts, such as the Eastern District of North Carolina, a seat has been vacant for 3,000 days. In Texas, vacancies nearly 2,000 days old are leaving courts suffering under caseloads more than double that recommended by the Judicial Conference. And yet the Senate delegations from those States have not agreed with the President on any nominees to fill those longstanding and now critical vacancies. The judicial selection and confirmation process, broadly speaking, is quite simply failing to achieve the results contemplated for it by our Founders under the Constitution. This hearing is an important step in addressing the judicial vacancy crisis. There are five current vacancies on Florida's Federal trial courts, and today we will hear from nominees for four of those seats. I applaud Senators Nelson and Rubio for their progress and am grateful for their bipartisan cooperation and look forward to their introduction of today's four nominees. First, though, I will offer the opportunity to our distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, to say a few words. Senator Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. First of all, congratulations to the nominees. I will take just a minute to talk about the productivity of the Committee, compare the term of President Obama with the term of President Bush. After yesterday's confirmation votes, the Senate has confirmed 64 lower-court Article III judges during President Obama's second term. By comparison, up to this point in President Bush's second term, the Senate has confirmed only 27 lower-court Article III judges. So 64 confirmed so far in the second term of this administration, 27 in the previous Presidency. With respect to the entire 5 years and 3 months of a Presidency, we have approved 233 for President Obama, 229 for President Bush. So I am glad we are being so productive and doing what we have to do, and once again, thanks to the nominees. Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley. I would now like to yield to the distinguished Senators from the State of Florida to introduce our nominees. I know that both of my colleagues have pressing schedules, so please feel free to depart if you must after your introductions, and again, thank you for your collaboration in making sure that we have judicial nominees to fill these important vacancies. Senator Nelson. PRESENTATION OF HON. BETH BLOOM, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA; PAUL G.
