Roper.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nRoper was born in North Carolina and became graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Class of 1918.[1] During World War I, he served aboard the USS Roe (DD-24), which operated in the north Atlantic, performing coastal, anti-submarine patrols, escort operations.\n\nLater, Roper would assume command of the USS Wisconsin (BB-64) for the closing months of World War II, succeeding Earl E. Stone. During that time, he led the Wisconsin in the Battle of Okinawa. For his service during the battle, he was awarded the Legion of Merit.[2] Previously, he had been given a Letter of Commendation for his services in the South Pacific Area, during which time he helped plan the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands Campaigns.\n\nJohn Wesley Roper died on September 8, 1963, and was buried together with his wife Hazel N. Roper (1898–1978) at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego.[3]"
