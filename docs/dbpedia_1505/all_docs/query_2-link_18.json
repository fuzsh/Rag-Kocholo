        "text": "The Know\n\nOne aspect of the Book of Mormon that sometimes turns heads is its four usages of the word dragon. Two of these occurrences are in quotations from Isaiah, which is perhaps not surprising since the word can be found in many passages of the King James Version of the Bible. However, the term is also used in two passages unique to the Book of Mormon, both times appearing as a simile for fierce fighters (Mosiah 20:11; Alma 43:44). Readers may be surprised by these occurrences and ask why dragons, mythical creatures, are mentioned in the Book of Mormon.\n\nBecause the Nephite conception of dragons may have been originally derived from the Israelite view, it is worthwhile to summarize what dragons were in the Near East and in the Hebrew Bible particularly. The Hebrew word translated as “dragon,” tannin, is a broad term describing reptilian creatures of various sizes: snakes, crocodiles, and even legendary sea serpents. Though tannin is sometimes translated as “whale” in the King James Version, the approximation is somewhat conjectural, and tannin is regularly reptilian.\n\nTannin is occasionally described on land; however, it is primarily associated with water and is typically described in or with water. Similar to other Near Eastern “dragons,” it represents the watery chaos that preceded Creation. Many Near Eastern cultures thus connect the slaying of a primordial sea monster to the dawn of Creation. Several biblical passages seem to make reference to Jehovah slaying a great sea monster (tannin) as part of the Creation and use proper names like Rahab for the monster.\n\nThe Hebrew conception of tannin may also be behind some of the Book of Mormon’s usages of the word “monster.” After quoting an Isaiah passage about God slaying a tannin, Jacob repeatedly personified death, hell, and the devil as an “awful monster” from which God “delivereth his saints.” The tannin could also be the conception behind the “monster of the sea” Moroni differentiated from whales in Ether 6:10.\n\nAs Latter-day Saint scholars like John L. Sorenson and Matthew Roper have noted, many of these Old World conceptions of a tannin could have easily translated to both the biological and cultural environment of the New World. Speaking of Mormon’s mention of dragons in Mosiah 20:11, Sorenson explained:\n\nWhat kind of “dragons” did he have in mind? The reference was probably to the crocodile or caiman. … But this “dragon” was much more than a dangerous bit of the natural world. In Mesoamerican mythology a giant creature of crocodilian form was thought to float on the supposed subterranean sea. His back was the surface of the earth, and his connection with earth and waters tied him symbolically with productivity and fertility. This “earth monster” is repeatedly shown at the base of relief carvings. … We can at least note two things about Zeniff’s dragon imagery: (1) it had powerful meaning to his listeners—beyond being a mere literary phrase, and (2) the complex of ideas is represented not only in the Book of Mormon but in Palestine and in Mesoamerica as well.\n\nSeveral species of crocodilians (including crocodiles, alligators, and caimans) can be found in the Americas. Many of these regularly attack humans and sometimes cause fatalities—their ferocity is noted in some of the earliest descriptions of them. The Americas are also home to dangerous serpents like pit vipers as well as many aquatic or semi-aquatic serpents such as water snakes, garter snakes, and the venomous yellow-bellied sea snake.\n\nWhile the biological underpinnings of an Old World tannin or dragon can be nicely mapped onto New World animals, there is also a conceptual overlap with the mythological idea of a dragon in the New World. Indeed, ancient American societies had many cultural and mythological parallels to the tannin as a supernatural, aquatic, and violent reptilian monster.\n\nNew World cultures associated many different themes with serpents and crocodiles, but these reptiles were frequently associated with water—like the Hebrew tannin. Water itself seemed to be personified as a serpent. Similarly, images from Tulum and the Dresden Codex depict a cosmic flood of water pouring from the mouth of an enormous crocodile.\n\nIn a Creation story from the New World, a giant crocodile or caiman was killed, and its body was used to form the earth and the sky—similar to the Creation stories of Near Eastern cultures, in which a monster living in a primordial ocean was slain. In the New World story, the earth itself was considered to be the back of either a giant crocodilian or turtle. Thus, crocodilians became a symbol not only of water but also of the earth and fertility, and they were sometimes portrayed with trees growing from them. The Popul Vuh recounts how the Hero Twins defeated a giant crocodilian monster who could form mountains. The term dragon is sometimes used to describe these creatures and the animals they are based upon in modern scholarship.\n\nThe serpent was a sacred symbol in ancient Israel, and several Old World cultures deified the serpent or portrayed it as a supernatural being. New World cultures also often deified the serpent, and many New World deities appear in serpentine or even crocodilian form. Not all reptilian deities were water related, nor were they always warlike. Likewise, not all water deities were warlike, but there certainly was overlap between each of these themes. Deities like K’uk’ulkan and Tlaloc could be portrayed as both reptilian and aquatic. The sea itself was sometimes depicted as a place of violence. One of the primary supernatural beings associated with war was the War Serpent, which was associated with the water deity K’uk’ulkan.\n\nCombat in ancient Mesoamerica seems to have been sometimes conceptualized as fighters transforming into zoomorphic supernatural beings during conflict. Mayan royalty were sometimes accompanied in processions by battle beasts, representatives of spiritual animals (called wayob), into which the kings were thought to transform in combat. These spiritual animals were sometimes depicted as serpentine creatures. The wayob were typically depicted as jaguars, though some have argued that the associated imagery is actually crocodilian or some combination of jaguar and crocodile. Serpents and crocodiles were also featured on Mayan headdresses. Perhaps these ideas helped create the Nephite imagery of fighting “like dragons.”\n\nThe Why\n\nKnowing that all these conceptions of the Hebrew tannin—serpents, crocodiles, and legendary primordial sea monsters—were familiar in a New World setting helps dispel accusations that the word dragon is out of place in the Book of Mormon. Rather, the term could well designate a number of powerful creatures that the Lehites would have been familiar with and that were spoken of in ancient American cultures. This understanding also helps elucidate what the Book of Mormon authors probably had in mind when describing those who fought “like dragons.”\n\nIt may also seem strange to readers that some ancient Israelites and Nephites, individuals whom we claim were enlightened by God’s prophets, may have believed in the existence of fantastical creatures. Yet, while some within Israelite and Nephite society may have literally believed in mythical creatures, many mentions of these creatures in Hebrew and Nephite scripture appear to be figurative or polemical. In some cases the terms could perhaps have been mistranslated and may refer to a very real creature without supernatural connotations. Scripture teaches that God speaks to all nations according to their own language and that He is able to accommodate the cultural worldviews of all peoples, giving them as much truth as He sees fit and in ways they can understand (Doctrine and Covenants 1:24; Alma 29:8).\n\nThough the dragon (from the Greek drakon) later became a symbol for the devil in the Revelation of John and in Christianity generally, the Book of Mormon usage—and incidentally, the Mesoamerican usage—was somewhat more neutral. The Nephites who were inspired by a higher cause than their enemies were said to have fought “like dragons.” Though peace should always be assertively promoted, readers will nonetheless inevitably have spiritual combat with their trials and temptations and can “fight the good fight” against the devil with the same legendary fierceness as a caiman, crocodile, or sea serpent."
