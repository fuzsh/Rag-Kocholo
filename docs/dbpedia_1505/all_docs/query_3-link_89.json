        "text": "Tapir as âHorse.â As Professor Sorenson and others have repeatedly pointed out, the practice of naming flora and fauna is far more complicated than critics of the Book of Mormon have been willing to admit. For instance, people typically give the names of familiar animals to animals that have newly come to their attention. Think, for instance, of sea lions, sea cows, and sea horses. When the Romans, confronting the army of Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC, first encountered the elephant, they called it a Lucca bos or âLucanian cow.â The Greeksâ naming of the hippopotamus (the word means âhorse of the riverâ or âriver horseâ) is also a good example. (Some will recall that the hippopotamus is called a Nilpferd, a âNile horse,â in German.)\n\nWhen the Spanish first arrived in Central America, the natives called their horses and donkeys tzimin, meaning âtapir.â The Arabsâ labeling of the turkey as an Ethiopian or Roman rooster (dÄ«k al-Ëabash or dÄ«k rÅ«mÄ«), the Conquistadorsâ use of the terms lion and tiger to designate the jaguar, and the fact that several Amerindian groups called horses deer represent but a few more examples of a very well-attested global phenomenon. The Nephites too could easily have assigned familiar Old World names to the animals they discovered in the New.\n\nLarson dismisses Sorensonâs suggestion that the Mesoamerican tapir may have been considered by some Book of Mormon writers to be a kind of âhorseâ or donkey, declaring that the tapir is much more like a pig (pp. 192â93). Here, though, it is important to remember that Sorenson was comparing the horse to the larger Mesoamerican tapir (Tapiris bairdii) and not one of the smaller species. It is also noteworthy that Sorenson is not the only scholar to suggest the similarity. Kamar Al-Shimas notes that in contrast to pigs, the tapir is one of the cleanest of animals. Hans Krieg likewise feels that the comparison with the pig is unfortunate.\n\nWhenever I saw a tapir, it reminded me of an animal similar to a horse or a donkey. The movements as well as the shape of the animal, especially the high neck with the small brush mane, even the expression on the face is much more like a horseâs than a pigâs. When watching a tapir on the alert, . . . as he picks himself up when recognizing danger, taking off in a gallop, almost nothing remains of the similarity to a pig.\n\nâAt first glance,â note Hans FrÃ¤drich and Erich Thenius, âthe tapirsâ movements also are not similar to those of their relatives, the rhinoceros and the horses. In a slow walk, they usually keep the head lowered.â When one observes them running, however, this changes:\n\nIn a trot, they lift their heads and move their legs in an elastic manner. The amazingly fast gallop is seen only when the animals are in flight, playing, or when they are extremely excited. The tapirs can also climb quite well, even though one would not expect this because of their bulky figure. Even steep slopes do not present obstacles. They jump vertical fences or walls, rising on their hindlegs and leaping up."
