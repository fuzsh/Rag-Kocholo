        "text": "246 U.S. 335\n\n38 S.Ct. 317\n\n62 L.Ed. 755\n\nWELLS\n\nv.\n\nROPER, First Assistant Postmaster General of the United States.\n\nNo. 103.\n\n1\n\nMessrs. Daniel Thew Wright and T. Morris Wampler, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n2\n\nMr. G. Carroll Todd, Assistant to the Attorney General, for appellee.\n\n3\n\nMr. Justi e PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n4\n\nThis was a suit in equity brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for an injunction to restrain Daniel C. Roper, First Assistant Postmaster General, from annulling a contract theretofore made between plaintiff and the Postmaster General acting for the United States, and from interfering between plaintiff and the United States in the proper performance and execution of the contract by plaintiff. The Supreme Court sustained a motion to dismiss the bill, its decree to that effect was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (44 App. D. C. 276), and plaintiff appeals to this court.\n\n5\n\nThe contract was made February 14, 1913, and by it plaintiff agreed for a stated compensation to furnish, during a period of four years a number of automobiles (with chaffeurs) specially equipped according to specifications for use in collecting and delivering mail at Washington, D. C. One of its provisions (the third) was a stipulation that:\n\n6\n\n'Any or all of the equipments contracted for herein may be discontinued at any time upon ninety days' notice from the said party of the first part,' meaning the Postmaster General.\n\nAnother was:\n\n7\n\n'18. That all acts done by the First Assistant Postmaster General in respect of this contract shall be deemed and taken, for all purposes, to be the acts of the Postmaster General, within the meaning and intent of this contract.'\n\n9\n\nBoth courts held it to be essentially and substantially a suit against the United States and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and in this view we concur. The effect of the injunction asked for would have been to oblige the United States to accept continued performance of plaintiff's contract, and thus prevent the inauguration of the experimental service contemplated by the act of 1914â€”a direct interference with one of the processes of government. The argument to the contrary assumes to treat defendant, not as an official, but as an individual who, although happening to hold public office, was threatening to perpetrate an unlawful act outside of its functions. But the averments of the bill make it clear that defendant was without personal interest and was acting solely in his official capacity and within the scope of his duties. Indeed, it was only because of his official authority that plaintiff's interests were at all endangered by what he proposed to do.\n\n11\n\nThe United States has consented to be sued in the Court of Claims and in the District Courts upon claims of a certain class, and not otherwise. Hence, without considering other questions discussed by the courts below or raised by appellant in this court, we conclude that the dismissal of the bill was not erroneous."
