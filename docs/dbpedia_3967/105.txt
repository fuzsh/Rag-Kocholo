Candaba is noted for its production melon, that are sold worldwide. The swamps are communal fishing grounds encompassing some 430 km2 of highly arable farmlands. Candaba swamps are very fertile due to its sustained deposits of humus and decaying plant residues. Migrant wild ducks and various wildlife bird from Siberia, New Zealand, Mongolia and other parts of Asia use Candaba as their yearly sanctuary.
