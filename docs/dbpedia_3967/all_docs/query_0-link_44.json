In order to appreciate it one must gain some familiarity with the conditions which prevailed in Spanish times. The first evidence of the Spanish governmental attitude toward education in the Philippines is found in a royal edict of March 21, 1634,i in which Felipe IV orders all archbishops and bishops to take steps for the education of the Filipinos in the Spanish language and in Christian doctrine. That this decree was more honoured in the breach than in the observance is evident from another royal decree of June 20, 1686,- in which the king reminds civil and religious authorities that the non-observance of the decree of 1634 will be charged against them. Neither of these documents provided for financing the scheme of education ordained, but a decree of Decem- ber 22, 1792,^ did make financial provision for the estab- lishment of Spanish schools for natives. The salaries of teachers were to be paid from the royal treasury, and deficits were to be made up from the communal prop- erties and treasuries. Although this was the first practical attempt to in- troduce general native education, there are evidences that individual opportunities were offered to, and em- braced by, Filipinos. It is probable, too, that in certain • Blair and Robertson, Vol. 45, p. 184. » Ibid., Vol. 45, p. 186. ' Ibid., Vol. 45, p. 222. VOL. II — B 501 502 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT localities the most generous of the Spaniards opened private schools. The College of San Jose was founded in 1601, the Uni- versity of Santo Tomas in 1619. Neither made provi- sion for educating natives. They were established for the children of Spaniards only, although both later ad- mitted Filipinos. But in the rules for the short-lived college of San Fehpe (1641-1645),^ Corcuera lays down the following: \"The college servants shall be of influ- ential Pampango families, and they shall be taught to read and write in the Spanish language, and shall be given clerkships if they show aptitude therefor.\" We learn that when the charity school of San Juan de Letran passed under the control of the Dominicans in 1640, native boys were admitted, on payment of fees, to share the advan- tages offered charitably to Spanish orphans.^ Primary education for Filipinos secured no real foothold until 1863.^ In that year, by royal decree, a school system originally planned for Cuba was extended to the Philip- pines. It made provision for the beginnings of primary instruction in all municipalities of the islands. A sum- mary ^ called forth by a circular of March 1, 1866, gives information with regard to the progress actually made. This summary fixes the number of towns at nine hundred, the number of children attending school at one hundred thirty-five thousand boys and twelve thousand two hun- dred sixty girls, and the number of schools at sixteen hundred seventy-four, but it gives the number of build- ings actually in use for schools as only six hundred forty-one. Instruction in Spanish was not always, or even generally, given. In 1863 provision was also made for the establishment of a normal school at Manila. In 1893,^ forty years later, ' Blair and Robertson, Vol. 45, p. 175. 2 Ibid., Vol. 45, pp. 213-265. 2 Census of the Philippines, Vol. Ill, pp. 578-590. * Ibid., Vol. Ill, p. 591. ' Ibid., Vol. Ill, pp. 579-580. EDUCATION 503 the actual appropriation for the Normal School was $5525. Fourteen years after the American occupation, the appropriation for the Normal School was $56, 476.42, in addition to $224,500 spent for new buildings and furniture.' In 1892 there were two thousand one hundred seventy- three schools. The attendance of these schools was small and irregular. In 1896, at the outbreak of the insurrection, the Spanish had in operation a public school system which could call upon the Normal School for teachers and also upon such graduates of private schools as cared to undertake the work. Naturally the latter were few. Between 1863 and 1893, the Normal School had enrolled two thousand and one students. This may be contrasted with the number of schools which, under the present regime, prepare the pupils for teaching, as well as for other occupations. Including the students of the Phihppine Normal School, the Philippine School of Arts and Trades, the Provincial High and Inter- mediate Schools, nearly thirty-seven thousand pupils are now following studies which fit them more or less to un- dertake the work of giving instruction to others. In addition to the Normal School, the Spanish estab- lished a Nautical School in 1820, a School of Commercial Accounting and of the French and English Languages in 1839, and an Academy of Drawing and Painting. Their final system of public instruction was not badly planned, but it was never actually put into full operation. From the beginning of the insurrection against Spain in 1896 until the beginning of the insurrection against the United States in 1899, most of the public schools were closed. The schooUiouses were used for barracks, prisons, or hospitals. No attempt was made to keep them in repair, and what scanty equipment they had once pos- sessed was for the most part destroyed or stolen. Between 1899 and 1901, many of these buildings were ' Report of Director of Education, 1911-1912. 504 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT repaired in towns which were occupied by American soldiers, and the beginnings of a public school system were made by our victorious army. Wlierever our flag was raised a public school was soon established, soldiers often serving as teachers, and the moral effect of this upon the Filipinos was very great. The city of Manila was natiu-ally the first place to receive attention. Three weeks after our army entered it on August 13, 1898, seven schools were opened under the supervision of Father W. D. McKinnon, chap- lain of the first Cahfornia Regiment. In June, 1899, Lieu- tenant George P. Anderson was detailed as city superin- tendent of schools for Manila, and during the following school year he had an average of forty-five hundred pupils enrolled in the primary schools. Captain Albert Todd was detailed to act as superintendent of schools for the islands, but on May 5, 1900, in anticipation of the transfer of the islands from mihtary to civil government, he gave way to Dr. Fred W. Atkinson, who had been chosen by the Philippine Commission as superintendent of pub- lic instruction. This title was changed later to that of director of education. On January 21, 1901, the commission passed Act 74, the basis of the present school law. It provided for the appointment of one thousand American teachers to begin the work of establishing a school system carried on in English. Appointments were made as rapidly as possible. By the end of the year, seven hundred sixty-five Ameri- can teachers were at work. When provision was made for the appointment of this large number of Americans, it was with the idea that they should act as teachers of Enghsh in schools over which there should be FiUpino principals, but there was, at that time, no body of Filipino teachers properly pre- pared to carry on school work, and by force of cu-cum- stances, this plan was soon altered. Ten school divisions were established, covering the EDUCATION 505 archipelago. Each was presided over by a division superintendent of schools. The teachers were theoreti- cally subject to his control, but the divisions were so large that it was impossible for him to exercise control very effectively. It is perhaps well that many of the teachers were left free to employ their o\\\\ti ingenuity in meeting local conditions. The school system finally established represents a composite of the recommendations of hundreds of teachers scattered throughout the archipelago, and these recom- mendations were based on hard-earned experience. One of the first duties of teachers was to begin the training of Filipino assistants. This took form in the organization of so-called aspirante classes, into which the best of the Filipino youth who were old enough to teach, and who had already received some education, were gathered. These aspirante classes were often held side by side with classes in the primarj^ schools first estabUshed by American teachers, and by the beginning of the year 1902 some of the brightest pupils were able to assist in primary school work. These classes made possible the establishment of organized primary schools under the control of American teachers with Filipino teachers in the lower grades. Their graduates formed the nuclei of the first secondary schools, which were estab- lished in 1903. The difficulties which teachers had to overcome at the outset were numerous. In some of the older and richer towns there were stone or brick schoolhouses more or less fit for occupation. In such cases a small number of old wooden benches and a few square feet of blackboard were usually available. Sometimes there were books provided by the army : Baldwin's readers in English or in rudely translated vernacular ; Frye's geographies translated into Spanish ; and possibly Spanish editions of the history of the United States. This stock was greatly improved during the latter half of 1902, and 506 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT teachers were furnished books and supplies as rapidly as transportation facilities penrdtted. In 1901 the number of school divisions was increased to eighteen, and in 1902 to thirty-six, making the school divisions identical with the thirty-six then existing poUt- ical subdivisions of the islands. The organization of the public school system gradually crystallized and assumed something of the form which it has to-day. Barrio ^ schools were opened, and the work of American teachers who were detailed to supervise them was thus greatly increased. The school system took permanent shape in 1903 and 1904. As it now stands it is controlled by the director of education, who is responsible for its conduct. Serving with him, and subject to his control, are an assistant director and a second assistant director. The directors have immediate charge of the general office, which has the following divisions : records, accounting, buildings, property, academic, industrial and publications. Each has a chief who is directly responsible for its work. The islands are now divided into thirty-four school divisions, corresponding, except in two cases, to provinces. Each has its superintendent of schools. The divisions are subdivided into districts, over each of which there is a supervising teacher who is responsible for the conduct of its work. Certain of the intermediate schools are under supervising teachers, while others are directly under division superintendents. The school system to-day extends to the remotest barrios. It is organized and equipped for effective work, and ready to carry out promptly and effectively the policies determined upon by the central office. In each province there is a central provincial school offering intermediate and secondary courses. Only twelve of them now give a full four-year course. Others offer three years, two years or one year of secondary work. • Barrios are small outlying villages. EDUCATION 507 There is also a manual training department attached to the provincial school, or a trade school. So much for the provincial school system. At JVIanila we have the PhiUppine Normal School, with an attendance of six hundred sixty-nine, and the Phil- ippine School of Arts and Trades, with an attendance of six hundred fortj^-one. Also, there are the School of Commerce and the School for the Deaf and Blind, both supported directly from insular funds. The School of Household Industries has recently been established for the training of adult women in embroidery, lace- making and smiilar arts, so that they may return to their provinces to estabUsh little centres for the produc- tion of articles of this nature. This is most important work. The FiUpinos are endowed with great patience, and with extraordinary delicacy of touch and manual dexter- ity. If productive household industries based on these valuable characteristics are generalized, the prosperity of the common people will be very greatly increased. Of the school system in general it can be said that Filipino teachers have been gradually employed for the lower grades, and Americans have thus been freed to take charge of the higher instruction. Priniary instruction is now in the hands of Filipinos, and intermediate in- struction is rapidly being tiu-ned over to them. In July, 1913, there were about eighty-five hundi-ed Filipino teachers, with an estimated total enrolment of five hundred thirty thousand pupils. The total enrolment in primary schools was approximately four hundred ninety thousand, in intermediate schools thirty thousand nine hundred, and in secondary schools sLx thousand. 'When we compare these figures with the hundred and seventy-seven thousand reported by the Spanish govern- ment in 1897, and when we consider the fact that attend- ance at that time was extremely irregular, it is e\\ddent that noteworthy progress has been made. Mere figiu-es, however, come far short of telhng the whole story. There 508 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT has been very great improvement in the qiiaHty of the instruction given. In the old days children ' ' studied out loud,\" and the resulting uproar was audible at quite a distance. On their arrival in these islands, Americans found that the educated Filipinos as a rule held honest manual labor in contempt, while many of those who had managed to secure professional educations did not practise their professions, but preferred to live a life of ease. There were doctors who made no pretence of treating the sick, and lawyers who had studied simply for the standing which the title would give them. The Bureau of Educa- tion has brought about a profound change in public sentiment ; a change of basic importance to the country. It was apparent at the outset that any educational sys- tem adhering closely to academic studies would simply serve to perpetuate this condition of affairs. Fortunately, those in charge of the situation were untrammelled by tradition, and were free to build up a sj'stem that would meet actual existing needs. The objection to manual labor offered much difficulty, but it has been largely overcome. There was, furthermore, a feeling against industrial work on the part of the people in many regions, based on the idea that teachers meant to supplement their salaries by the sale of the industrial i:)roducts of the schools. This prejudice, which seemed formidable at first, disappeared when the bureau took up in earnest the intro- duction of industrial education and vocational training. Just as the academic organization grew out of local conditions, so did industrial education accommodate itself to existing circumstances. In the Spanish colegios, girls had been taught to do exquisite embroidery and to make pillow lace. In various parts of the islands, hat weaving was carried on by families or groups of famiUes. The making of petates,^ of rough but durable market bas- kets and of sugar bags constituted widespread local • Sleeping mats. ■i|Uti«irib«iHuiM EDUCATION 509 industries. American teachers were quick to see how these vagrant arts could be organized and commercialized. An intense rivalry sprang up between supervising teachers, and as a result the arts of pillow lace-making, embroidery, Irish crochet, hat weaving, basketry and macrame work have been introduced and standardized throughout the primary and intermediate schools. The excellence of the output is truly astonishing. Courses in housekeeping and household arts also re- ceived early attention. The social and economic condi- tions in the Philippines are such that the so-called \"domestic science\" course of .American schools is quite in- adequate to meet the needs of Filipina girls. Specialized instruction in hygiene, in the care of the sick, in house- hold sanitation and in the feeding and care of infants is included in this course of housekeeping and household arts, which was taken by fifteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven girls during 1912-1913. School gardening was introduced at an early date. This course now includes the school garden, in which each pupil has his own indi\\idual three and a fourth by thirteen foot plot, and home gardens which are not less than four times the size of the school plot. By this arrangement eighty per cent of the garden work is carried on at the homes of the pupils or on vacant lots under the direct supervision of teachers. In the beginning much of the school agricultural work was not very practical. Teachers who themselves knew nothing about agriculture were wedded to the small \"individual plot\" idea, which I regret to say still continues to prevail in some of the schools. On a bit of ground about three feet by si.x the pupil might plant one tomato plant, one camote vine, one grain of rice, two or three eggplants and a flowering plant or two. This gave him helpful open-air exercise, but taught him nothing about agriculture. Weeks after the school year had opened I once visited a number of school 510 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT gardens in Mindoro and found that several of them con- sisted of rectangular plots marked off on soUd sod with shells picked up on the beach ! On my return I told the director of education that three active hens would have done far more toward preparing soil for cultivating than had all the childi-en in these towns. These conditions have changed rapidly since the adop- tion, three years ago, of a definite policy of agricultural education consisting of standard school and home gar- dens and farm schools for Filipinos ; and large com- munal tracts of land cultivated at the Settlement Farm Schools for non-Christians. Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Lewis of Bukidnon was as deeply disgusted with the former play agriculture as was I. Exercising, I fear, rather arbitrary authority over the local Filipino teachers, but with my connivance, he persuaded them to tm'n their active, strong school- boys loose on large tracts of the beautiful prairie land found near almost every school in the sub-province, and raise crops. As a result of this experiment, first carried out at Tankulan, each boy took home a bushel or two of unhulled rice. Parents were enthusiastic, and so were the boys. From this small beginnmg came the so-called farm- settlement schools, of which there are thirty-eight among the non-Christian tribes. On large, well-fenced, carefully cultivated tracts of ground the schoolboys grow camotes, upland rice, corn, bananas, cowpeas, beans, pineapples, egg plants, arrowroot, and in some cases, cacao and coffee. Instead of learning what incUiddual plants will do when grown quite by themselves under abnormal conditions, they learn to produce real crops. They become interested in the introduction of American sweet potatoes in place of the less nutritious camotes, in the selection of seed corn, in the generalization of the better varieties of bananas, and in other practical matters. Incidentally they largely furnish the school food supply. It is of course true that in many of the Fihpino towns EDUCATION 511 sufficiently extensive tracts of land cannot be had near the schools to make such a system possible, but, wherever it can be done, school children should be taught how to raise crops on a commercial scale, instead of spending their time on small individual plots of ground. Even the latter procedure has good results. It teaches them not to be ashamed to work. It also makes possible the introduction of home gardens, and through this means brings the practical production of vegetables into the home life of the people, with the result that imused yards and vacant lots are put under cultivation. The system of establisMng home gardens is one which meets with my unquaUfied approval. In 1911-1912 there were no less than twenty-two thousand nine hun- dred fifty-eight of these. It is said to be true that a large percentage of them soon pass into family care, and thus not only help to educate parents, but become a per- manent additional soui'ce of food supply. The schools have proved a useful medium through which to bring about the introduction of new and valu- able plants. There are many school nurseries in which grow thousands of seedUngs, and these are distributed at opportmie times. Woodworking is one of the industrial branches which received first attention. As previously stated, every one of the thirty-eight provinces has either a trade school with first-class equipment, or a manual training department at- tached to the provincial school. Eighteen schools have al- ready been established as regularly equipped trade schools. The Phihppine Normal School and the Philippine School of Commerce offer special advantages to those studying for the profession of teaching, or for a business career. Previous to 1909, industrial instruction was only par- tially organized. Experience had shown, by that time, that it was expedient to introduce a degree of specializa- tion into the courses of study at an early stage of the child's development. Special intermediate courses were 512 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT therefore organized to meet this need. After finishing the four-year primary course, the child may choose between a course in teaching, a course in farming, a trade course, a course in liousekeeping and household arts and a general intermediate course. Relatively few children are at present able to take up secondary courses, and it is therefore necessary to provide in the lower grades for instruction which will prepare them for some vocation. So important has become tliis hne of instruction that it has been found necessary to maintain, in the general office, an industrial information department, under a division chief, which employs a botanist, a designer, four native craftsmen and a force of travelling super- visors who inspect trade schools, machinery, school gar- dens, building sites and the general industrial work done throughout the public school system. This system of industrial instruction receives the fullest support from the Filipino people. The following quotation from the twelfth annual report of the director of education serves to give some idea of the extent to which industrial instruction has been developed in the Philippines : — \"As is at once evident, with requirements so definitely fixed for industrial work in the schools, the great majority of the pupils who are enrolled must be engaged in some branch of this work. An examination of the figures included among the statistical tables of this report will show that of the total en- rolment of 235,740 boys and 138,842 girls during the month of February, 1912 (an average month), 216,290 boys and 125,203 girls — 91 per cent of the entire monthly enrolment — were doing some form of industrial work. More specifically, it will be found that 21,420 boys were taking manual training and trade work; 96,167 boys were engaged in school gardening and farming ; 15,463 girls were also engaged in garden work ; and 68,194 girls were taking up various lines which go under the general caption of minor industries. . . . Further in this connection it \\\\'ill be found that in the subject of lace-making alone 16,439 girls were receiving instruction; in embroidery, 12,339; and in cooking 4768. There were 22,965 boys and EDUCATION 513 7709 girls making hats in the industrial classes, 40,264 pupils making mats, and 104,424 studying the art of basketry. \"... 1309 pupils were enrolled in the regular trade school classes ; 924 in regular trade courses in other schools ; and 7360 in the shops operated in connection with provincial and other intermediate schools. In 401 school shops having an enrolment of 19,949 boys, articles to the value of P142,189.74 were fabricated and from this product, sales to the amount of P131,418.13 were made during the school year 1911-12. In addition to the above, 10,3.56 pupils were doing work in 236 primary woodworking shops conducted in connection with municipal primary schools in all parts of the Islands. The figures for trade and manual training are taken from the March report.\" This most important result is due in very large measure to the determination of the Honourable Newton W. Gil- bert, while secretary of public instruction, to give a practi- cal turn to the activities of the Bureau of Education. I must confess that at first I was profoundly dissatisfied with the work which this bureau was doing, for the reason that, in my opinion, it tended to produce a horde of graduates fitted to be clerks, in which event they would naturally desire to feed at the public crib, or be likely to become abogadillos,^ who would be constantly stirring up trouble in their owti tow^ls, in order to make business for themselves. Much of the industrial work originally provided for was at the outset carried out in a haphazard and half- hearted way. Under Mr. Gilbert's administration it has been hammered into shape, and we now see in pros- pect, and in actual realization, practical results of vital importance to the country. Personally, I feel especialh' indebted to Mr. Gilbert for his attitude relative to school work among the non- Christian tribes. The children of the hill people are naturally hard-working. In some places they were being actually taught idleness in the schools, and in most the ' Literally, \"little lawyers.\" This designation is commonly applied to pettifoggers. 514 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT education given them was of little practical value. I found Igorot children in Lepanto studying geography. I asked a boy what the world was, and was told that it was a little yellow thing about the size of his hand ! This was a fairly accurate description of a map, the significance of which had utterly failed to penetrate his understanding. Filipino teachers who were not considered fit for appoint- ments in the lowlands were being foisted off on to the unfortunate hill people, as they were wilUng to accept very small salaries in lieu of none at all. Prior to Mr. Gilbert's assumption of office, my frequent complaints had produced no practical result. He was kind enough to say to me at the outset that he would give very serious consideration to my opinions in the matter of educational work among the people of the non-Christian tribes. To-day industrial work has taken its proper place in schools estabhshed for them, and considerable numbers of them are being fitted for lives of usefulness, although it is still ti'ue that school facilities among them are, as a rule, grossly inadequate. In Ifugao, for instance, with at least a hundred and twenty-five thousand inhabitants, there are but two schools. In Kalinga, with some seventy-six thousand inhabitants, the first school has just been opened. However, this condition will doubt- less be remedied in time. The former tendency of FiUpinos to prepare themselves for trades or professions and then not follow them has been largely overcome. IVIost of the students graduating from the Philippine Normal School take up the profession of teaching, and practically all of the graduates of the Philippine School of Arts and Trades are following the lines of work which they have studied. And now I come to what I deem to be one of the most important ac- complishments of the Bureau of Education. Before the American occupation of the Philippines the Filipinos had not learned to play. There were no athletics worthy of the name. Athletic sports had their begin- EDUCATION 515 nings in the games played between soldiers. Gradually Filipinos became interested enough to attend contests of this nature. Later, through the influence of American teachers, they began to take part in them. As soon as athletic sports reached a point where competition be- tween towns and provinces was possible, they aroused the greatest enthusiasm among the people. To-day, the athletic policy of the Bureau of Education is heartily approved by all classes. At first, highly specialized sports were introduced, but the necessity for develop- ing some form of group athletics in which a large percent- age of the pupils would take part was soon niade manifest. For the past few years this programme has been pushed. Eighty per cent of the pupils now participate in some form of athletics, and the number steadily increases. The results are justifying the hope of the original pro- moters of this athletic programme. The physical develop- ment of the participants has been wonderful. The spirit of fair play and sportsmanship, hitherto lacking, has sprung into being in every section of the islands. Base- ball not only strengthens the muscles of the players, it sharpens their wits. Furthermore it empties the cock- pits to such an extent that their beneficiaries have at- tempted to secure legislation restricting the time during which it may be played. It has done more toward abol- ishing cockfighting than have the laws of the conamission and the efforts of the Moral Progress League ' combined. It is indeed a startling sight to see two opposing teams of youthful savages in Bukidnon or Bontoc \"playing the game\" with obvious full knowledge of its refinements, while their ordinarily silent and reserved parents \"root\" with unbridled enthusiasm ! Annual meets between athletic teams from various groups of pro\\'inces, and a general interscholastic meet held each year at the Philippine Carnival, offer advan- ' An organization wliich long vigorously combated the coek-pits, but failed to bring about their abolition. ^ 516 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT tages of travel to boys who have seldom if ever left their homes, and promote a general understanding between the various FiUpino peoples. In the \" Far Eastern Olympiad \" held at Manila in 1913, in which China, Japan and the Philippines participated, the victorious teams representing the Phihppines were largely composed of schoolboys. When the American school system was organized, it was found that adequate accommodations for school children were almost entirely lacking. In some of the towns there were long, low stone or brick buildings, small and poorly hghted. They were usually located in the larger centres of population, and had no grounds that could be used for play or garden purposes. In most of the barrios, there were no schooUiouses at all. The American teachers at once set to work to put the old buildings into decent condition. Some private houses were rented, and others were donated, for school purposes. In a number of cases the teachers attempted, as best they could, to construct buildings for the thousands of pupils who wished to avail themselves of school priv- ileges. At that time the whole burden of such con- struction fell upon the municipalities. The insular government had given them no aid. Many mistakes were made during these early days, and many of the buildings then erected have long since fallen into ruin. The experience gained has demonstrated the folly of spending large sums of money on anything but strong, permanent construction. It will be necessary, for a long time, to depend to some extent upon temporary buildings ; and when these can be erected at low cost they are good provisional expedients, but destructive storms and the rav- ages of wood-eating insects quickly reduce them to ruins. The demand upon local funds for the maintenance of schools was so pressing, and these funds were so limited, that it was found impossible to erect modern buildings without insular aid. Wlien the necessity for help was s a z w u s EDUCATION 517 brought to the attention of the insular authorities, the commission responded by enacting a bill which ap- propriated $175,000 from the congressional reHef fund for the construction of school buildings. Two years later $150,000 were appropriated and, in August, 1907, an additional $175,000 were voted for this purpose. A total of $500,000 was thus made available by the Com- mission before the Philippine assembly came into existence. This amount was augmented by provincial and munic- ipal funds and voluntary contributions, and the erection of twenty-two buildings for provincial high schools, twenty-sLx for trade and manual training schools, and fifty-seven for intermediate schools other than provincial was thus made possible. The first act of the Phihppine Assembly was to vote for an appropriation of $500,000, available in four equal annual instalments, to aid municipalities in constructing school buildings. The bill was duly approved by the commission and became a law. Under its terms, munici- paUties received $2 for every dollar furnished locally, the maximum insular allotment for one project being $2500. This bill was later supplemented by an act which appro- priated an additional $500,000 under similar conditions. Three subsequent acts have been passed, each appro- priating the sum of $175,000 for the aid of municipalities in constructing school buildings under such conditions as the secretary of public instruction may see fit to prescribe. The funds made available by the three appropriations last mentioned are being used chiefly for the erection of large central school buildings at provincial capitals. The sums appropriated by the Philippine Legislature since the assembly was established have made possible the construction of five hundred twenty-nine school build- ings, of which two hundred seventy-thi'ee are finished and three hundred nineteen are being buUt. There have been additional appropriations for the con- struction of a Philippine Normal School already com- VOL. II — C 518 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT pleted at a cost of $225,000, a girls' dormitory now build- ing to cost $147,000 and a building for the Philippine School of Arts and Trades to cost approximately $250,000. The bureau has required that school sites for central schools shall have a minimum of one hectare' of land, and the barrio schools a minimum of one-half hectare, for playgrounds and gardens. There have been secured to date three hundred eighty-nine school sites of ten thou- sand or more square metres, and six hundred forty-three sites of at least five thousand square metres. These rep- resent the results obtained during the past three years. The Bureau has formulated a very definite construc- tion policy. Its programme may be outlined briefly as follows : — 1. The preparation of a set of standard plans for permanent buildings which provide for a unit system of construction whereby additions may be made ^vithout injury to the original structure, and which shall be within the limited means available. 2. The selection of suitable school sites. 3. A decent and creditable standard in temporary buildings. 4. The proper care and maintenance of schoolhouses and grounds. 5. The equipment of every school with the necessary furniture and appliances of simple but substantial character. From the beginning, other branches of the government have clearly seen that no agency is so effective as the Bureau of Education in the dissemination of knowledge among the people. It has therefore been called upon frequently to spread information, either through class- room instruction or through the system of civico-ed- ucational lectures established by an act of the Philip- pine Legislature. The Bureau of Health has frequently requested it to instract the people in the means to be used for the prevention of diseases, particularly cholera, smallpox and dysentery, and has always met with a ready response. Great good has doubtless been accomplished 1 A hectare is equivalent to two and a half acres. EDUCATION 519 in this way, but with regret I must call attention to the fact that in connection with a matter of fundamental importance the Bureau of Education has signally failed to practice what it preached, or at all events what it was re- quested to preach. The Philippines are constantly men- aced by epidemic diseases, such as cholera and bacillary dysentery, while amoebic dysentery occurs in every munic- ipality in the islands and is a very serious factor in the annual death-rate, hook-worm disease is common, and typhoid fever is gradually increasing in frequency. The question of the proper disposition of human feces is there- fore one of fundamental importance. It seems incredible, but is nevertheless true, that in connection with a large majority of the modern school buildings which have been erected there are no sanitary facilities of any sort whatso- ever. The condition of the ground in the rear of many of these buildings can better be imagined than described. This state of affairs not only sets an evil example to the children, but exposes them to actual danger of infection with the above-mentioned diseases. In many of the special provincial government towns where a great effort has been made to have the people clean up, I have found school grounds and the private premises of school teachers, including, I regret to say, those of American school teachers, to be in a more unsanitary state than were any others in town ; and finally, in despair of securing improve- ment in any other way, I have fallen back on the courts and caused teachers responsible for such conditions to be brought before justices of the peace and fined. The Teachers' Camp at Baguio was long maintained in a shockingly unsanitary condition ; and as a result many persons who went there seeking health and recrea- tion became infected with intestinal diseases, and were incapacitated for work during more or less prolonged periods. In deahng with this situation I finally resorted to radical measures, but got results. Such a state of affairs is wholly incomprehensible to 520 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT me. School-teachers should be the first to set the people practical examples in sane living, which means sanitary living, and should improve the great practical opportunity afforded by the public schools to bring home to their pupils certain homely but much-needed lessons in ordinary decency. In another important particular the Bureau of Education has, in my opinion, fallen short of performing its manifest duty. Not only does beri-beri kill some five thousand Fili- pinos outright, annually, and cripple ten times as many, but it is believed to be a determining factor in the deaths of large numbers of infants through its untoward in- fluence upon their mothers. As previously stated, the fact that it is due to a diet made up too largely of polished rice has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. Persons who eat unpoUshed rice do not contract it. Tiqui-tiqui, the substance removed from rice in the process of polishing, has proved to be a very effective remedy for it. The use of polished rice should therefore be discouraged, yet at the Phihppine Normal School, where the brightest and best youths of the land receive their final education before going out to teach their fellows, polished rice is fur- nished the students ; and the director of health, and I myself, have sought in vain to have the unpolished article substituted for it. The secretary of public instruction has stated, with obvious truth, that it is only when polished rice forms a very large element in the diet that there is actual danger of its causing beri-beri, and so far as I am aware no case of beri-beri has occurred at this school ; but the practical result of the present practice will be that the graduates, while instructing their pupils in the dangers of the use of polished rice, will themselves continue to use it. There exists at the present time a foolish prejudice against unpolished rice, which, although far more nutritious and actually more palatable than the polished article, does not look so attractive and is commonly considered \"poor man's food.\" So long as the instructors in the EDUCATION 521 public schools continue to teach by precept that its use is dangerous, and by example that it is safe, the undis- criminating and ignorant Filipino public, which does not draw fine distinctions, will be encouraged to continue to eat it, will eat it in excess, and will pay the penalty. The Bureau of Education has cooperated with the Bureau of Lands in instructing the people as to the right to acquire homesteads and free patents. It has also given the Bureau of Public Works assistance in promoting the campaign for good roads. Its system of civico- educational lectures has met with fair results. Thousands of people have secured information relative to the rights and duties of citizens, the prevention of human and animal diseases, and the growing of corn, coconuts and other useful crops. A corn-raising contest in 1912 was participated in by more than thirty thousand boys, and thousands of people attended the demonstrations which formed a part of the campaign. This is a most important matter. Corn is a far better food than rice. At first the only books available for use in the schools were those prepared for American children. These were soon found to be unsuited to the needs of Filipino children, and teachers were set to work to prepare more suitable text-books. Book companies in the United States quickly interested themselves, and as a result there is now in general use a comprehensive series of text-books partic- ularly adapted to the needs of Filipinos. In the secondary grades American text-books are quite generally used, although a few special texts deahng with literature, rhetoric, economic conditions and colonial history have been prepared in the islands. In order to keep the teacher in the field well informed, the Bureau of Education has issued a large number of bulletins and circulars on matters of current interest. These bulletins have covered instruction in domestic science, drawing, manners and right conduct, school buildings and grounds, embroidery and athletics, and 522 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT have conveyed information as to the general and special courses of study followed in such schools as the School of Arts and Trades, the School of Commerce and the Normal School. They have received much commenda- tion from educators in the United States and the Orient. When pubhc schools were first opened children crowded into them by thousands. With them came many adults who beheved that they could learn English in a period of a few weeks, or in a few months at the most. No doubt they entered the schools in many cases with the idea of thus conciliating the victorious American nation. It was not long until they realized that there was no royal road to learning. Then came a slump in attendance. Largely through the influence of the American teacher and his Filipino assistants, the attendance was again built up. This time the people clearly understood that education is not a matter of a few months or weeks. It is greatly to their credit that they have now settled down to a realiza- tion of what public education is, and are giving the public school system most loyal support. The industrial programme has been accepted with enthusiasm, and without doubt there are in the islands to-day thousands of people who believe that it is a Filipino product. There is an interest in athletic sports that can hardly be equalled in any other country. The crowds of en- thusiastic spectators that attend every meet of importance testify to the hold that such sports have taken upon the people, whose attitude toward all forms of education is such that it needs only adequate revenue to develop an effective school system along the broadest lines. Manhood suffrage does not exist in the Philippines. The qualifications for an elector are as follows : he must be a male citizen at least twenty-three years of age, with a legal residence of six months previous to election in the municipality where his vote is cast, and must belong to at least one of the three following classes : — EDUCATION 523 1. Those who, previous to August 13, 1898, held the office of municipal captain, gobernadorcillo, alcalde, lieutenant, cabeza de barangay, or member of any ayuntamiento. 2. Those who hold real property to the value of S250 or annually pay $15 or more of established taxes. 3. Those who speak, read or write English or Spanish. With a population of approximately eight million people, there were, in 1912, two hundred forty-eight thousand qualified voters. Of these a large number had obtained the franchise because they belonged to class 1 or class 2. Death yearly claims its quota from both these classes, but the public schools more than make up the decrease by their yearly contribution. Any boy who finishes the primary course possesses the Uterary qualifications of an elector, and will become one on at- taining legal age. In 1912 there were graduated from the primary schools 11,200 pupils, of whom approximately 7466 were males; from the intermediate schools 3062 pupils, of whom 2295 were males ; and from the secondary schools 221 pupils, of whom 175 were males. In that year alone the schools therefore contributed 9936 to the contingent of persons qualified by literary attainments to vote. Of these 175 are perhaps capable of intelligently holding municipal and provincial offices, and to this number may probably be added half of the 2295 intermediate male graduates, making an increase of 1362 in the possible leaders of the people. The pubUc schools, however, do not limit their con- tributions to that part of the electoral body having lit- erary qualifications only. Vocational training, it is true, is limited in the primary grades to cottage indus- tries ; but no pupil is graduated from the primary schools with only literary quaUfications. In some form or other, he has had a vocational start. His own energy must determine the use he makes of it. The intermediate schools add vocational training to 524 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT increased academic training. All their graduates have done three years' work in the general course, leading to a literary course in the high schools, the course in farming, the course in teaching, the business course, the course in housekeeping and household arts or the trade course. Of the graduates of secondary schools a small part have highly specialized vocational training; but the great majority have followed the literary course and have undoubtedly done this with the idea of entering pohtical life. Rome was not built in a day, and in spite of her- culean American efforts, it will be a long time before Filipinos cease to regard a certain kind of literary culture as the proper basis for statesmanship. It has been said of them that they have \"the fatal gift of oratory\" ! The future leaders of the Filipino people, dependent or in- dependent, must be the output of the pubhc schools. The danger is that the number of would-be leaders will be disproportionately great in comparison with that of the useful but relatively inconspicuous rank and file. There are in the Philippine Islands fully twelve hundred thousand children of school age. The present available resources are sufficient to educate less than one-half of that number. The claim has been made that a due proportion of the very limited revenues of the insular government has not been expended for educational purposes. It is not justi- fied by the facts. It is certainly important to keep the Filipinos alive, and if this is not done, they can hardly be educated. The expenditure to date ^ from insular funds for health work, including cost of necessary new buildings, has been approximately S9,630,000 ; that for educational purposes, also including buildings, approximately $21,376,000. As a simple matter of fact, the Bureau of Education has been treated not only with liberality but in one re- gard with very great leniency. Taking advantage of ' End of fiscal year 1913. The Sacred Thee uf the Iflgai;*. This great tree at Quiangan is considered sacred by the Ifugaos of that region. They believe that when it dies they too will perish. EDUCATION 525 the friendly attitude of the legislative body and of the people toward education, one of its earlier directors in- curred expense with utter disregard for appropriations. He repeatedly made deficits of $150,000 to $250,000 and then in effect calmly asked us what we were going to do about it. After stating that I, for one, would never vote to make good another deficit incurred by him while he was allowed to remain in the service, and at a time when I was threatening to hold the director of forestry per- sonally responsible for a deficit of S5000 resulting in his bureau from unforeseen expenditures by forest offi- cers in remote places, and therefore more or less excusable, I learned that the usual shortage in the Bureau of Edu- cation had again occurred and was being covered by the quiet transfer of a sum approximating $200,000. The present director of education believes that the total number of children who would enter the pubhc schools without compulsion, if adequate facihties were provided, is approximately eight hundred thousand. Until revenues materially increase not many more than five hundred thousand of these can be educated, if due regard is had for other imperative necessities of the government and the people. If the people of the United States, or any political body composed of them, really desire to help the Filipinos toward the practical realization of their ideal of an independent, self-sustaining government, let them stop talking about the advisability of now conferring upon the present generation of adults additional rights and privileges, and provide the hard cash necessary to make mtelligent, well-trained citizens out of the three hundred thousand children who are now annually left without educational advantages which they earnestly desire, and greatly need. Under the Spanish regime private education as dis- tinguished from that provided for by the government attained considerable importance. At the time of the American occupation, Santo Tomas, the oldest univer- 626 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT sity under the American flag, had colleges of medicine and surgery, theology, law, engineering and philosophy. There were also numerous private so-called \"colleges\" for boys and girls and very numerous smaller private institutions. At first the establishment of pubUc schools had no apparent effect on those conducted privately other than to induce them to introduce the study of EngUsh, but as years went by, the organization, modern methods and industrial development of the public schools forced the private institutions into activity. The law provides that the secretary of public instruction may give ap- proval and recognition to such private schools as meet certain requirements, and in 1910 a division superintend- ent of schools was detailed to assist him in carrying out this provision. His report for the period ending Septem- ber 1, 1912, is a very interesting document. It compares the Philippine private schools with those of South America, very much to the disadvantage of the former. It notes particidarly the lack of manual training in boys' schools and the lack of standardization in the manual training of girls' schools ; and speaks of the allegiance of the Filipino institution to the classical programme of mediae- val institutions of learning. It is a notable fact, however, that English is gaining. Thirty-four private schools are giving their entire primary and intermediate courses in that language ; nine are giving primary, intermediate and high school courses in it, and two are so giving all courses, including the college course. These private institutions are employing pubhc and normal school graduates as teachers to a constantly in- creasing extent. They are bringing their courses of study into conformity and competition with those of the public schools ; are introducing athletics ; using stand- ard patterns and materials in their industrial work, and rapidly improving their buildings and equipment. Dur- ing the year 1911-1912 improvements to the value of $100,000 were made in four of the Manila private schools : EDUCATION 527 the Jesuits are planning a new college to cost 81,000,000 ; the Dominicans an expenditure of 3500,000 on a new uni- versity, and the Liceo de Manila looks forward to becom- ing the most modern and best equipped school in the islands. Twenty-five private schools have already received government recognition and approval. No account of education would be complete without mention of the University of the Philippines. Higher education is the great conscious goal of Filipino desire ; and to meet the growing need for it, an act passed June IS, 1908, established this institution. Subsequent amend- ments authorized, when practicable, colleges of liberal arts, law, social and political science, medicine and siu-gery, phar- macy, dentistry, veterinary science, engineering, mines, agriculture and fine arts. At present there are in actual operation the colleges of hberal arts, veterinary science, engineering, medicine and surgery', law, agriculture and the school of fine arts. Instruction in pharmacy is given in the College of Liberal Arts, and instruction in forestry is given in the College of Agriculture. By special acts of the Philippine legislature, several scholarships have been provided, but for the most part the university is open only to those who can afford to live in Manila dur- ing their period of attendance. The opening of some of these colleges has served sharply to call attention to one of the present weaknesses of the Filipino people. It is but a few years since agriculture was well-nigh prostrated as a result of the decimation of cattle and horses throughout the islands by contagious diseases. The need for well-trained veterinarians was, and is, imperative. Filipinos properly qualified to under- take veterinary work would be certain of profitable em- ployment. A good veterinary course was offered in 1909. At the same time the School of Fine Arts was opened. No one took the veterinary course the first year. Admissions to the School of Fine Arts were 528 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT closed when they reached seven hundred fourteen. At the end of the school year 1912-1913 the students in the Veterinary College numbered twenty-seven as compared with six hundred ninety-four in the School of Fine Arts. The grand total enrolment of this latter institution since its organization is thu'ty-two hundred twenty-nine, while that of the Veterinary College during the same period is forty-seven. It is necessary to restrict attendance at the School of Fine Arts. Until there is a livelier and more general interest in saving carabaos than in paint- ing them, the country will not attain to a high degree of material prosperity through the efforts of its own people. I take genuine pleasure and pride in briefly describing the work of the Philippine Training School for Nurses. I have always beUeved that young Fihpina women would make excellent trained nurses, and I earnestly endeavoiu-ed to have a certain number of them included among the first government students sent to the United States for education soon after the establishment of civil government. In this effort I rather ignominiously failed. The prejudices of the Filipino people were then radically opposed to such a course, and my colleagues of the com- mission were not convinced that it would lead to useful practical results. To the Bureau of Education must be given credit for inaugurating the movement which has resulted in the firm establishment of the profession of nursing in the Philippine Islands as an honourable avocation for women. At an early date it employed an American trained nurse to give instruction, and inaugurated a preparatory course at its Normal School dormitory. The work at the out- set could not be made of a very practical nature, but after a number of bright and well-trained young women had become interested in it arrangements were perfected for giving them actual training at the government in- stitution then known as the Civil Hospital. Here strong EDUCATION 529 racial prejudices of the Filipinos were gradually over- come, and the student nurses soon showed themselves to be unexpectedly practical, faithful and efficient. Later when the great Philippine General Hospital was estabUshed it became possible for the Bureau of Health to open a school under the immediate control of the chief nurse, and to take over all the work of training nurses. Students at this school are supported at government expense while in training. Its opportunities and advan- tages are open to young men, as well as to young women, and may be extended to a number not exceeding one hundred six of each sex at a given time. The training of young women began sooner, and thus far has resulted more satisfactorily, than has that of young men, although many of the latter are now making good progress. The work is popular, and as there are more candidates than places only the more promising are admitted. They have shown that they possessed common-sense bj^ avoid- ing the traps set for them by Filipino politicians and newspaper reporters. Their tact and self-respect have brought them safely through many embarrassing, and a few cruelly trjdng, situations forced upon them by the unkindness or brutality of those whom they have sought to serve. Their gentleness and kindness have endeared them to their patients, and it is now a common thing for Americans to request the services of Filipina nurses. Their faithfulness and efficiency have won the confidence of patients and physicians aUke. Their courage has enabled them to triumph over the prejudices of their own people, and to perform many hard, disagreeable tasks, and meet some very real dangers, -without faltering. The gratefulness which they have shown for the oppor- tunity to help their people, no less than for the interest taken in them by Americans, has won them many friends. The training of Filipina nurses has passed far beyond the experimental stage ; it is a great success. 530 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT Instruction in the Philippine Nurses' Training School is now largely given by members of the university faculty and the graduates of this school must certainly be num- bered among the most highly educated women of the Philip- pines. More of them are sadly needed, not only in gov- ernment institutions, but in private hospitals, and es- pecially in the provincial towns, where a few of them are already engaging in district nursing with unqualified success. The country might well get on for the present with fewer lawyers, and fewer artists, if the number of nurses could be increased. Equally praiseworthy is the work of the students and graduates of the College of Medicine and Surgery, which is housed in a commodious and adequate building. Their theoretical instruction is of a very high character, and they have almost unrivalled facilities for practical clini- cal work in the Philippine General Hospital. Entrance requirements are high and the course of study is severe. A number of the best students do post-graduate work in the hospital, where they are employed as internes and assistants. As a result, the college is turning out grad- uates admirably qualified for the great work which awaits them among their own people. The other colleges of the university are, for the most part, doing their work efficiently and well, and as a rule their students are showing appreciation of the opportu- nities afforded them, and are utilizing them to good advantage. Important educational work is being carried on by various bureaus of the government. The Bureau of Lands has an excellent school for surveyors. The Bureau of Printing is in itself a great industrial school, and ninety-five per cent of its work is now done by Filipinos trained within its walls, while many others who have had practical instruction there have found profitable private employment. An excellent school is conducted in Bilibid Prison with EDUCATION 531 convicts as teachers. A very large proportion of the prisoners receive practical instruction in manual training and are fitted to earn honest livings when their sentences expire. Furthermore, they readily secure employment, as the men discharged from this institution have in many cases earned well-deserved reputations for honesty and industry. All the women confined at Bilibid are taught to make pillow lace. At the Bontoc Prison, the non-Christian tribe convicts of the islands are taught useful industries, and so satis- factoiy are the results that I have formed the habit of calling the institution my \"university.\" At the Iwahig agricultural penal colony convicts are taught modern agricultural methods under a system such that they gradually become owners of houses, land and agricultural implements and may in the end have their families with them so that they are well settled for life when their sentences expire, if they take advantage of the opportunities given them. The educational policy which the United States has adopted in dealing with the Filipinos is without a parallel in history'. I am glad to have assisted in its inauguration, and I am proud of its results, which will make themselves felt more and more as the years go by. Even now Eng- lish is far more widely spoken in the Philippine Islands than Spanish ever was, and this is a boon the magnitude of which cannot be appreciated by those who have not had brought home to them by experience the disadvan- tages incident to the existence of very numerous dialects among the inhabitants of one country. WTien it is remembered that in the present instance each of these dialects is very poor in hterature, and that its use is limited to a million or two of human beings at the most, the enormous value of instruction in English will be realized, to some extent at least. CHAPTER XX The Exploration of Non-Chkistian Territory At the time of their discovery the Philippine Islands were inhabited by a very large number of distinct tribes the civilization of which was directly comparable with that of the Negritos, the Igorots and the Moros as they exist to-day. Do not understand me to imply that the Negritos, the Igorots and the Moros have attained to the same stage of civilization. The Negritos belong to a distinct race. They are woolly-headed, nearly black, and of ahnost dwarfish stature. They seem to be incapable of any considerable progress and cannot be civilized. Intellectually they stand close to the bottom of the human series, being about on a par with the South African bushmen and the Austra- lian blacks. The Igorots are of Malayan origin. They are un- doubtedly the descendants of the earlier, if not the ear- liest, of the Malay invaders of the Philippines, and up to the time of the .\\merican occupation had retained their primitive characteristics. The Moros, or Mohammedan Malays of the southern Philippines, exemplify what may be considered the highest stage of civilization to which Malaj's have ever attained unaided. They are the descendants of the latest Malay invaders and were, at the time of the discovery of the islands, rapidly prosecuting an effective campaign for their mohammedanization. At the outset the Spaniards made extraordinary progress in subduing, with comparatively little bloodshed, many of these different peoples, but the Moros at first successfully 532 THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 533 resisted them, were not brought under anything approach- ing control until the day of steam gun-boats and modem firearms, and were still causing serious trouble when Spanish sovereignty ended. As time elapsed the political and military estabhsh- ments of Spam in the Philippines seem to have lost much of their virility. At all events the campaign for the control and advancement of even the non-j\\Iohammedan wild peoples was never pushed to a successful termination, and there to-day remains a very extensive territory, amounting to about one-half of the total land area, which is populated by non-Christian peoples so far as it is populated at all. Such peoples make up ap- proximately an eighth of the entire population. When civil government was established I was put in general executive control of matters pertaining to the non- Christian tribes. Incidentally, a word about that rather unsatisfactory term \"non-Christian.\" It has been found excessively difficult to find a single word which would satisfactorily designate the peoples, other than the civilized and Christianized peoples commonly known as Filipinos, which inhabit the Philippines. They cannot be called pagan because some of them are ]VIohammedan, while others seem to have no form of religious worship. They cannot be called wild, for some of them are quite as gentle, and as highly civilized, as are their Christian neighbours. The one characteristic which they have in common is their refusal to accept the Christian faith, and their adherence to their ancient refigious beliefs, or their lack of such beliefs as the case may be. I am therefore forced to employ the term \"non-Christian\" in designating them, although I fully recognize its awkwardness. While serving with the First Philippine Commission I was charged with the duty of writing up the non- Christian tribes for its report, and tried to exhaust all available sources of information. The result of my investi- gations was most unsatisfactory to me. I could neither VOL. H D 534 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT find out how many wild tribes there were, nor could I learn with any degree of accuracy the territory which the kno\\vn tribes occupied, much less obtain accurate information relative to their physical characteristics, their customs or their beliefs. The most satisfactory source of information was the work of Blumentritt, an Austrian ethnological writer ; but Blumentritt had never set foot in the Philippines, and I suspected at the outset what later proved to be the case, that his statements were very inaccurate. He recognized more than eighty tribes of which thirty-six were said by him to be found in northern Luzon. As it was obviously impossible to draft adequate legisla- tion for the control and civilization of numerous savage or barbarous peoples without reliable data on which to base it, and as such data were not available, I had to get them for myself, and undertook a series of explorations, carried out during the dry seasons so far as possible, in order to gather my information on the ground. I first visited Benguet in July and August, 1900. On my second northern trip I traversed the province of Benguet from south to north, arrived at Cervantes in Lepanto, and was about to leave for the territory of the Bontoc head-hunters when I received a telegraphic sum- mons to return to Manila for the inauguration of Governor Taft on July 4, 1901. The following year such time as could be spared from my duties at Manila was necessarily devoted to the search for a suitable island for the site of a proposed leper colony ; but in 1903 I was able to make a somewhat extended ex- ploring trip, traversing the country of the Tingians in Abra, passing through the mountains which separate that province from Lepanto, visiting the numerous settlements of the Lepanto Igorots and continuing my journey to Cayan, Bagnin, Sagada and Bontoc; and thence through various settlements of the Bontoc Igorots to Banaue in the territory of the Ifugaos. Entrance to the Quiangax 8cHOOL-HorsE. The Ifugao boys on either side of the stairway helped build this remarkable structure. Most of their companions in the work were older, but ail were of school age. THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 535 The latter portion of the trip was not unattended with excitement. A few weeks before a fairlj^ strong con- stabulary detachment, anned with carbines, had been driven to the top of a conical hill in the Ifugao country and besieged there until a runner made his way out at night and brought assistance. We felt that there was some uncertainty as to the reception which would be accorded us. The Bontoc Igorots who accompanied us did not feel that there was any uncertainty whatever as to what awaited them, but were more than anxious to go along with us, as they were spoiling for a fight with their ancient enemies. We had to use them for carriers to transport our bag- gage, and each carrier insisted on having an armed com- panion to lug his lance and shield. As a precautionary measure we took with us twenty-five Bontoc Igorot constabulary soldiers armed with carbines, while each of the five American members of the party carried a heavy six-shooter. We also had with us a dog which was supposed to be especially clever at seasonably discovering ambushes and giving warning. We were able to use horses more or less as far as the top of the Polis range, but the trail down its eastern slopes was impracticable for horses and dangerous for pedestrians. We shivered for a night on a chilly mountain crest, and the next day continued our journey to Banaue. When still several miles from the town, we were met by an old Ifugao chief with two companions. They marched boldly up to us and inquired whether we were planning to visit Banaue. On receiving an affirmative reply, the chief asked if our visit was friendly or hostile. I assured him that we were friends who had come to get acquainted with the Ifugaos. He said he was glad to hear this, but that after all it did not really matter. If we wished to be friends, they were willing to be friendly ; but if we wanted to fight, they would be glad to give 536 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT US a chance. As he and his companions were facing a column of eighty-seven armed men I rather admired his courage. He next presented me with what I now know to be an Ifugao gift of friendship, to wit, a white rooster and six eggs, after which\" he took from one of his companions a bottle filled with bubud,^ and having first taken a drink to show me that it was not poisoned, handed it to me. I did my duty, and we were friends. We then proceeded on our way to Banaue, being obliged to plunge down through the rice terraces to the bottom of a deep canon and then climb two almost perpendicular earthen walls before reaching the house of the chief. I was completely exhausted when I began this climb, and did not feel comfortable clinging like a tree frog to the face of a clay bank with nothing to support me except rather shallow holes which could be better negotiated by Ifugaos, possessed of prehensile toes, than by men wearing shoes. Seeing my predicament, an Ifugao climbed down from above, pulled my coat-tails up over my head and hung on to them, while another came up behind me, put his hands on my heels and carefully placed my toes in the holes prepared for their reception. Thus aided, I finally reached the top. The Ifugaos did not invite us to enter their houses, but allowed us to camp under them. I was assigned quarters under the house of the chief. It was tastefully ornamented, at the height of the floor, with a very striking frieze of alternating human skulls and carabao skulls. One of my reasons for coming to Banaue at this time was that I had heard that the people of seven other towns had recently formed a confederation and attacked it, losing about a hundred and fifty heads before they were driven off. I therefore thought that there might be a favourable opportunity to learn something of head-hunting, and to secure some photographs illustrating customs ■ A fermented alcoholic beverage made from rice. THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 537 which I hoped would become rare in the near future, as indeed they did. Trouble promptly arose between our Bontoc friends and the Ifugaos. The Bontocs wanted to purchase food. Some baskets of camotes were brought and thrown down before them and they were told that they were welcome to camotes, which were suitable food for Bontoc Igorots and pigs, but that if they wanted rice they would have to come out and get it. As twenty-five of them were armed with carbines and all the rest had lances, shields and head-axes, they were more than anxious to go, but this we could hardlj- permit ! So we put them in a stockade under guard, and subsisted them ourselves, a thing which neces- sarily rendered our stay brief, as provisions soon ran low. The Ifugaos of Banaue showed themselves most friendly, but warned us that a large hostile party was waiting to attack us at Kababuyan, a short distance down the trail. ]My mission to the Ifugao country was to estabUsh kindly relations with the people rather than kill them, so I did my best to get on good terms with the inhabitants of the more friendly settlements. The day before we left, people came in haste from a neighbouring village to advise us that one of their men had lost his head to the Ifugaos of Cambiilo, and begged us to join them in a punitive expedition, assuring us that there were numerous pigs and chickens at Cambiilo and that our combined forces would have no difficulty in whipping the people of that place, after wliich we could have a most enjoyable time plundering the town, while they would secure a goodly toll of heads wliich might be advantageously emploj-ed in further ornamenting their Banaue homes. They were greatly disgusted when we declined to join them, and said they would do the job anyhow, as no doubt they did. First, however, they insisted that we come with them to see that the story they had told us was true. We soon overtook a procession carrying a very much beheaded 538 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT man who was being borne out for burial on his shield, and were readily granted permission to attend his funeral. It was an interesting and weird affair. After it was over we hastened back to Banaue, in constant fear of breaking our necks by falling down the high, nearly perpendicular, walls of the rice terraces, on the tops of v/hich we had to walk. Most of us discarded our shoes, in order to mini- mize the danger of a fall. One member of the party, who insisted on wearing his, glissaded down a steep wall and had to be pulled out of the mud and water at the bottom. Fortunately he was not injured. Having succeeded beyond our expectations in establish- ing friendly relations with the Ifugaos of Banaue we took our departure, requesting them to tell their neighbours about us and promising to visit them again. I returned to Bontoc and made my way to Baguio in Benguet through the Agno River valley, stopping at numerous settlements of the Benguet Igorots on the way. It was not possible for me to make further explorations in the territory of the Luzon wild people until 1905. In this year I set out, accompanied by Mr. Samuel E. Kane, an American who spoke Ilocano exceptionally well, and Colonel Bias Villamor, a former Insurgent officer, who was more familiar with the territory which I desired to visit than any one else of whom I could learn. He had established friendly relations with some of its inhabitants during the insurrection. We visited several of the wilder settlements of the Tingians in Abra, then made a hard climb over Mount Pico de Loro and descended its eastern slopes to the Tingian village of Balbalasan in the Saltan River valley. Its people, while not really head-hunters, were often obUged to defend themselves against their Kalinga neighbours, and were consequently well armed. After a brief rest we continued our journey down the Saltan River, visiting settlements on the high hills in its immediate vicinity. THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 539 At Salecsec we had an extended conference with an old chief named Atumpa, a very acute man of wide ex- perience and sound judgment, who exercised great in- fluence in the territory through which we had just passed. Atumpa, satisfied as to our good intentions, consented to accompany us into the Kalinga countrJ^ A Kalinga chief named Saking, whom Villamor had known during the insurrection, met us here, and told us of a war trail into his territory which would greatly shorten our pro- posed journey, and make it possible for us to reach in one day the first of the previously unknown Kalinga settlements of the Mabaca River valley. Saking, observing that the people in the Saltan valley had cleaned off their old trails, and in some cases had built new ones for our convenience, went ahead of us to his own country in order to tr}^ to j^ersuade his people to do some trail work, leaving us to follow him. Our route lay over the top of a high peak called \"Dead Man's Mountain\" because a good many people who tried to climb it never came down, the true explanation of their failure to appear being no doubt that they perished from exposure during violent storms. While ascending this mountain I suffered an attack of partial paralysis of the legs, due, as I now have reason to beheve, to heart strain, but was able to continue the journey after a brief rest and the use of stimulants. A considerable part of our trip down the steep northern slopes of this mountain was made by utihzing a stream bed in lieu of a trail, and was in consequence very un- comfortable and somewhat dangerous, as the chance for broken bones was good. Fortunately, however, no one was badly hurt. At the first Kalinga village we found about a hundred and twenty fighting men armed with shields and head- axes, but Saking and his brother Bakidan at once came forward to greet us and we did not suspect mischief. I had brought with me from Manila a great bag of 540 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT newly coined pennies. They looked like gold, and we distributed them among the warriors, who were greatly dehghted and promptly proceeded to place them in the ends of the huge ear plugs which the men of this tribe are so fond of wearing. Every one seemed friendly enough at the outset, but soon a rather disturbing incident occurred. There were eight chiefs present. I noticed that they suddenly withdrew a short distance and squatted all together in a circle as if by word of command. After a brief but very animated discussion they rose simulta- neously, and six of them started down the trail at a run, while Bakidan and Saking came to us and somewhat anxiously suggested that it was time to be moving on. Our way lay through enormous runo grass which closed in over our heads, so that we were marching in a rather low tunnel through the vegetation. Bakidan went ahead of us, Saking brought up the rear, and both were evidently on the alert. Bakidan suggested that we keep our re- volvers handy, which we did. A short march brought us to Saking's place. Here a still larger body of fighting men awaited us, and there were no women in evidence except Saking's wife, who, at the direction of her husband, came forward, and under his instructions sought to shake hands with us. This was a new ceremony to the Kahngas, and she gave us her left hand. Standing in a conspicuous place in front of Saking's house were two baskets filled with flowers which were wet with blood. We surmised, rightlj^ as it later proved, that these baskets had contained human heads just before our arrival, and that we had interrupted a head- ' Canao is the word commonly used by the northern Luz6n wild men in designating a feast or ceremony. In Ahayao it is also used as an adjective to designate a place which may not be approached, being then equivalent to \"taboo.\" 0 3 a: z »^ < .2 ft. THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 541 One did not need to be an expert in the moods of wild men to see that the people of this place were feeling ugly, and after shaking hands with Saking's wife we promptly marched on. It was fortunate for us that we did so. We later learned that the conference of the eight chiefs which aroused our suspicion had been held to discuss our fate. Six of them were in favor of kilhng us immediatelj^, arguing that we were the first white men to penetrate their country ; that they might have to carry our baggage, which would be a lot of trouble ; and that if they allowed us to pass through others might follow us, whereas if they killed us they would have no further trouble with strangers. Saking was severely criticized for having told us the where- abouts of the war trail over which we had come, and was appointed a committee of one on extermination, with power to act. In fact, he was directed to take liis people and kill us, but he dechned to obey instructions, and the other chiefs had run down the trail ahead of us in order to gather a sufficient force to wipe our party out. Sak- ing's people were somewhat loath to act under the orders of any one else, and our sojourn among them was so brief that they did not have time definitely to make up their minds to attack us. We now rapidly completed our journey to Bakidan's place, where we were to spend the night. Here again a crowd of armed fighting men awaited us. It was momen- tarily augmented by the arrival of recruits from the villages through which we had just passed. Still unsuspicious of mischief, we turned our revolvers over to one of our Ilocano companions, a man named Lucio, who had served as Aguinaldo's mail-carrier during the latter days of the insurrection. We then walked into the middle of the crowd and sat down on pieces of our own luggage. Bakidan immediately brought me a small wicker basket of very dirty looking bananas. I was nauseated as a 542 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT result of severe exertion in climbing Dead Man's Moun- tain, and the bananas did not look appetizing, so I thanked him and put the basket on my lap. Instantly I felt strong tension rising in the crowd. We had brought along chief Atumpa and several friendly Kalingas from the Saltan Eiver valley. They seized their head-axes and stepped in beliind us, facing out. Bakidan instantly with- drew into his own house, and from a point where hardly any one except myself could see him made emphatic gestures, indicating that I was to eat. Little suspecting the significance of the act, but desirous of placating his outraged feelings if he felt that his hospitality had not been appreciated, I hastily peeled a banana and took a bite. To my amazement, there was an instant and ob- vious relaxation of tension in the crowd. The Kalinga warriors loosened their grip on their head-axes and began to walk about and talk. My own old men also assumed an air of indifference. Much puzzled, I made up my mind to look into this matter further, and later learned that when people from one Kalinga settlement visit those of another if the latter wish to be friendly it is customary for them to offer the visitors salt if they have it, bananas if salt is lacking, and water in the event that neither salt nor bananas are available. If the visitors wish to accept the friendship thus profTered, they promptly eat or drink, as the case may be ; otherwise it is understood that they have come looking for trouble. Bakidan had ceremonially proffered the friendship of himself and his people, and in my ignorance I had practi- cally declared war on the whole outfit ! When I learned these facts I asked Bakidan why they did not kill us at once. He said they were afraid. I expressed my sur- prise that they should be afraid of three unarmed men, and he explained that it was very bad etiquette in the Kalinga country for a person with a head-axe to go behind another, and that we had amazed every one when we walked into THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 543 the midst of that gathering of armed men and sat down with our backs to half of them. They instantly concluded that we had, concealed about our persons, some new and strange device with which we could annihilate a crowd, hence they were afraid ! Here, as at Saking's place, we had interrupted a head- cahao. The head had been smuggled out of sight just before our arrival. The canao was now renewed and continued all night, although the head was not again put in evidence. It is needless to say that we attended. We witnessed one of the weirdest sights I have ever seen. The following day was spent in distributing presents to the Kahnga head-men, in taking photographs, and in getting a Uttle much needed rest. As evening drew near Bakidan suggested that it was about time we formally made friends with each other. We were beginning to feel rather far away from home, and wanted all the friends we could get, so promptly acceded to his suggestion and repaired to his house at eight o'clock, the hom- he had in- dicated. The ceremony proved very simple. His wife fried some boiled rice in fat — dog fat as we afterward learned, but fortunately we did not know this at the moment ! We all squatted on the floor, Bakidan facing us, and the dish of fried rice was placed between us. He squeezed a mass of it into a ball and gave it to me. I ate it, and then rendered him a similar service. He ate in turn, and we were friends ! The same procedure was followed with each of my companions. In the midst of the ceremony there came a very unex- pected interruption. A KaUnga woman was standing near me holding a torch. She had been silent and had seemed timid. I chanced to stretch out my right hand palm up. To my surprise she uttered an exclamation which was almost a shriek, seized my wrist and began to point excitedly to the lines in my palm. The other Kahngas gathered about, evidently greatly interested. 544 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT Several of them showed the lines in the palms of their own hands, and an animated conversation ensued. I asked what it all meant, and was informed that I was going to become a man of great influence ! I had ah'eady modestly introduced myself as the ruler of all non-Christians, so found this reply unsatisfactory, but could get no other. It was fortunate indeed for us that we made friends with Bakidan. On the following day we continued our journey down the valley. Our baggage was carried by women, children and a few old and more or less decrepit warriors who obviously felt deeply insulted at being required to render such a menial service, and were decidedly resent- ful toward Bakidan for having ordered them to do it. Before we started Bakidan warned us that the KaUngas were queer people, and in consequence it would be well for us very quietly to go around certain of their settle- ments. Others we would visit. Their inhabitants would be sm'e to invite us to stay and enjoy their hospitaUty. He would second every such invitation. We were to pay no attention to his words, but were to note whether or not he sat down. If he did, we might accept the invi- tation. Otherwise we must plead an urgent engagement farther down the valley and move on. Things came out exactly as he had foretold. In several villages we heard noises decidedly suggestive of head canaos, and discreetly circled these places. We declined all invitations seconded by Bakidan when he did not seat himself, and rested comfortably for a time in several ^'illages where he did. Toward noon we walked straight into an ambush laid for us in the runo grass, discovering it only when Bakidan began to dehver a forceful oration in which he set forth the fact that he had a right to stroll down his own valley with a partj^ of friends without being annoyed by having his fellow tribesmen hide beside the trail and prepare to throw lances. Bakidan, who was himself a famous warrior, told these THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 545 men that they might kill us if they saw fit to do so, but must kill him first. Apparently rather ashamed of themselves, they came out on to the trail and slunk off to their town. Bakidan, greatly disgusted, suggested that we follow ithem and lunch in their village just to show that we were not afraid of them, and we did this. After lunch I photographed a number of our late opponents, and we then continued our journey, escorted by a Kahnga chief named Bogauit from Took-Took. This man had previously descended to the Cagayan valley, where he had seen white people, and hearing of our advent in the Kahnga country, and fearing that we might have trouble in getting carriers for our baggage, had come with his fighting men to help us out. The people of his village received us in a most friendly spirit, and after attending a bit of a canao organized in our honour, and doing our best to entertain the crowd with a few simple experiments in physics, and some sleight-of- hand tricks, we retired, as we supposed, for a peaceful night's rest. No such good fortune awaited us. We were aroused in the middle of the night by a fearful din only to find our hut surrounded by a great circle of armed men. The people who had attempted to ambush us earlier in the day had repented of their action in letting us pass through unharmed, had gathered a strong force of fighting men, had surrounded our house and were now vociferously demanding to be allowed to take our heads. Old Bakidan was apparenth' fighting a duel with their chief in the midst of the circle. The two men were dancing around each other with cat-like steps, occasionally coming to close quarters and clashing shields, then leaping apart, swinging their head-axes and obviously watching for an opportunity to strike home. Had either of them gained any decided advantage of position he would doubtless have used his head-axe, and this would have started a fight which could have had but one ending. 546 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT Owing to a mistake made when the ammunition for our trip was purchased, we had just twenty-two revolver cartridges amongst us, and in the darkness they would have been worth about as much as so many firecrackers. The roof of the house was dry as tinder ; a blazing brand thrown on it would promptly have forced us into the open. We should have been met by a flight of head-axes and lances, and this book would not have been written ! The majority of the crowd were determined to take our heads. The Took-Took people, greatly outnumbered, were evidently on the fence, and Bakidan was our only advocate. He still insisted that any one who wished to kill us must kill him first. His reputation stood him in good stead, and no one tackled the job. The uproar continued until nearly morning. Bdsi, a strong native liquor, was constantly passed. Indeed, every one but Bakidan had been drunk when we were first awakened. Finally food was handed around, and when the excited warriors stopped yelling in order to eat it the liquor had a chance to work, and most of them went to sleep. We might probably have then effected our escape for the time being, but it was utterly impossible for us to get out of the country without the assistance of the Kalingas, and we decided to see the thing out right there. In the morning the crowd was uglier than ever. As we crossed the little plaza they suddenly closed in on us with the obvious intention of doing for us, and we thought the end had come. At this critical moment a diversion was created in our favour by the wholly unexpected arrival of a letter brought in by a Kalinga runner. It had fol- lowed us all the way from Abra, and contained information about two pieces of baggage which were missing when we started. Its arrival greatly alarmed the hostiles, who interrogated me as to whether soldiers were coming. They had heard of soldiers, but had never seen them. I assured them that the arrival or non-arrival of soldiers ill ■J \" a 2 ' i i 3-3 1. M CT i5 ^ ^ S THE EXPLORATION OF NON-CHRISTIAN TERRITORY 547 would depend on the way they treated us, and to our utter amazement, they presently faded away. The Took-Took people again showed themselves friendly when their unwelcome visitors had departed, and made us bamboo rafts on which we descended the river. Our voyage was a decidedly adventurous one. Our rafts were repeatedly smashed by the swift current. As we approached each Kalinga village we were met by a reception committee carrying a bunch of bananas, fol- lowed at a short interval by a crowd of fighting men fully armed, and were thus given an opportunity to decide whether there should be peace or war. Needless to say, we voted for peace every time. I ate bananas vmtil it was difficult to find room for more ! We spent the night at the rancheria of a friendly, white-haired old chief who had been to Tuguegarao, the capital of Cagayan, and knew a few words of Spanish. The next day we reached the settlement of Chief Doget, who had a wonderful house of red narra, a wood which closely resembles mahogany. It was furnished with beds, chairs and tables obtained from the Spaniards. Here we were able to rest in peace. After sleeping the clock twice around, we continued our journey, and at dusk reached the Filipino town of Tuao, glad enough to get back to civilization and feehng that the kindly Providence which watches over fools, drunken men and children had had its eye on us. Without es- cort, and armed only with six-shooters rendered almost useless by lack of ammunition, we had completed the first trip ever made through the Kalinga country, and had done it without firing a shot and without losing a man. This trip marked for me the beginning of friendly re- lations with the Kalingas. They have never since been interrupted, and now, when I ride a fast American horse rapidly over the splendid trails which cross their country from south to north and from west to east, or meet at Lubuagan the fighting men who were once so anxious to 548 THE PHILIPPINES PAST AND PRESENT take my head but now make a long journey yearly in order to see me, I realize, as perhaps no one else does, how- very materially conditions in Kahnga have changed. It had been our intention, after spending a brief period in recuperation at Tuao, to proceed to Malaueg and con- tinue our journey through the absolutely unknown coun- try of the Apayaos, but we found it impossible to secure guides. The leading men of Malaueg, who came to Tuao to meet us, assured us that there were no trails known to them, which was untrue, and added that they would not under any circumstances consider trying to enter the territory of the fierce Apayao head-hunters. We accordingly proceeded to Tuguegarao, the capital of Cagayan, intending to descend the Cagayan River to Aparri, go overland to Abulug or Pamplona and there get guides and carriers. At Tuguegarao, however, we found assembled the pres- identes of all the Cagayan towns. Those from Abulug and Pamplona positively assured me that there were no trails thence into the Apayao country, and that guides and carriers would be absolutely unobtainable. I in- sisted that I would visit their towns and ask them to ac- company me, whereupon they actually wrung their hands and wept, complaining that the people of Apayao used bows and poisoned arrows. In disgust I told them that I would abandon the trip for that year, but the following year would go to Laoag in North Ilocos, cross the \" Cordillera Central \" and come out through the Apayao country, taking with me Ilocano guid"
