Cebu was the first province in the Visayas founded in 1565. Also, La Pampanga served as the archipelago’s capital from 1762 to 1754 during the British invasion of Manila.\n\nThe province of Nueva Ecija borders the northern part while Bataan and Zambales on the southwestern and western regions, respectively, and Bulacan on the eastern and southeastern parts. It opens up to Manila Bay as seen on the map of Pampanga.\n\nPampanga serves as the home to two Philippine Air Force bases namely Clark Air Base and Basa Air Base in Angeles City and Floridablanca, respectively. Angeles City is geographically within Pampanga province, but it has an independent government being a highly urbanized and first-class city.\n\nClark International Airport (formerly Diosdado Macapagal International Airport), which is found in Clark Freeport Zone, serves Pampanga. Clark International Airport is the 2nd international airport in Luzon.\n\nORIGIN OF PAMPANGA Located in Central Luzon, it was the Spaniards who gave Pampanga its name La Pampanga upon discovering natives living near the riverbanks of the largest river during that time, Indung Kapampangan River. Its name originates from the term pangpang or pampang which means riverbank. Nothing is more suitable than its name since Pampanga is a flat province that is crisscrossed by hundreds of small lakes flowing and leading to the Pampanga River.\n\nGEOGRAPHY Pampanga is composed of 20 municipalities and 3 cities (2 component cities and 1 independent, highly urbanized city). Here is a political map of Pampanga, Philippines.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_571\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]\n\nMap of Pampanga (by Municipality)[/caption]\n\nPhysically, Pampanga’s total land mass is 206,247 hectares.

Santo Tomas has the smallest land mass (21 km2).\n\nThe wet season begins in May and ends in October, and the rest is considered dry season.

Pampanga ang itinuturing na sentro ng kulinaryo dahil sa dami ng mga residente na magagaling magluto. Lungsod ng San Fernando ang kabisera ng lalawigan, na sikat sa pagsasadula ng pagpako sa krus ng Panginoong Hesukristo. Sikat din ang lugar na ito sa naggagandahang parol.\n\nAng pangalang Pampanga ay ibinigay ng mga Kastila sa lalawigan dahil natagpuan nila ang mga unang naninirahan dito sa tabi ng pampang. Ang lalawigan ay nabatid ng Kastilang si Martin de Goiti noong 1571. Ang lalaking capampangan ay kilala sa pagiging galante at magaling mamuno habang ang babae naman ay kilala sa pagiging mahusay magluto. Ang Pampanga ay isa sa mayayamang lalawigan sa Filipinas. Muling itinatag ito ng mga Kastila noong 11 Disyembre 1571 upang magkaroon ng kontrol ang gobyerno sa mga mamamayan nito. Hinati ang lalawigan sa mga bayan. Bawat bayan ay hinati sa apat na distrikto at ang iba naman ay hinati sa enkomiyenda. dahil sa labis na pang- na hinati ulit sa apat na distrikto at ang iba naman ay hinati sa encomienda. Dahil sa labis na pang-aabuso ng mga enkomendero ay ipinagbawal ng hari ng Espanya ang enkomiyenda noong 1574 ngunit ito ay naipatupad lamang hanggang matapos ang 1620. Ang ilang bahagi ng Bataan, Bulakan, Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Tarlac at Zambales ay dating nasasakupan ng Pampanga. https://fili7.weebly.com/kultura-sining-at-musika.html Ang Pampanga ay isang lalawigan ng Pilipinas na matatagpuan sa rehiyong Gitnang Luzon. Ito ay nakilala bilang probinsya ng mga Espanyol noong Disyember 11, 1571. Nagsilbi rin itong kabisera ng kapuluan nang dalawang taon mula 1762–1764 nang sinakop ng mga Ingles ang Maynila. Ang salitang pampang, kung saan nagmula ang pangalan ng lalawigan, ay nangangahulugang \"dalampasigan\". Ang pagtatatag nito noong 1571 ang naging dahilan upang maging kauna-unahang lalawigang Kastila sa Pilipinas. Ang Lungsod ng San Fernando ang kapital nito. \"La Pampanga\" ang ipinangalan ng mga Kastila sa mga\n\nkatutubong kanilang natuklasang naninirahan sa dalampasigan. Meron pang ibang probinsya na nabuo sa sobrang dami ng polpulasyon at ang iba naman ay tumira nalang sa mga barangay ng Pampanga. Noong 1860 ang Bamban, Capas, Conception, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac at Florida Blanca ay nahiwalay sa Pampanga at napasailalim sila sa Comandancia Militar de Tarlac. Noong 1817 naman ang dapat apat na lugar ay naibalik sa Pampanga at ang limang iba pa ay naging munisipalidad ng probinsya ng Trlac. Disyembre 8, 1941 ang mga Hapon ay binimba nila ang Clark Air Base at doon nagsimulang nasakop ang Pampanga. Sa panahon ng 1942 hanggang 1944 ay lumaban ang mga Kapampangan sa pamamagitan ng samahang hukbalahap at kapampangan gerilya ay napaalis ang mga Hapon.\n\nNahahati ang Pampanga sa 20 mga munisipalidad at 3 lungsod.\n\nMga lungsod: Lungsod ng Angeles Lungsod ng San Fernando Lungsod ng Mabalacat Mga bayan: Apalit Arayat Bacolor Candaba Floridablanca Guagua Lubao Macabebe Magalang\n\nMasantol Mexico Minalin Porac San Luis San Simon Santa Ana Santa Rita Santo Tomas Sasmuan San Isidro https://fili7.weebly.com/kasaysayan-ng-pampanga.html\n\nThe Remarkable Landmarks of Pampanga\n\nby Jhaypee Guia on October 19, 2012 Photo from wikipedia.orgThe Remarkable Landmarks of Pampanga Hizon-Singian House\n\nPampanga is a remarkable province filled with wonder and history. Over the centuries of its existence, Pampanga can be said to have a unique culture all its own. The many wondrous landmarks that follow are all testaments of Pampanga's long tradition of being a much-loved tourist destination.\n\nBuluyut Bridge\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nFormerly known as Puente Colgante, it was reconstructed in 1896 using iron and stone. It was replaced in 1928 by a reinforced concrete arch bridge designed by Sotero J. Baluyut for his Bachelor's thesis at the University of Iowa in 1909. The bridge served as the only link of Manila with the rest of Northern Luzon. It was restored by Mayor Rey B. Aquino in 2003. Camel Backbridge\n\nBacolor, Pampanga\n\nLocated at the Olea Creek in Sta. Ines, this was used as the principal link between the western and eastern sitios of the barrios. Under this bridge passed large bancas from the other parts of Pampanga and is said to be the landing place of Simon de Anda y Salazar when they retreated from the English invaders who established Bacolor as the seat of the Spanish government and the capital of the Philippines in 1762. Clark Historical Marker Trail\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nWith the myriad markers scattered throughout the freeport zone, the marker trail is a good and healthy way of learning about the history of Clark Field and its various structures. Crissot Monument\n\nBacolor, Pampanga\n\nA monument built in honor of Juan Crisostomo Soto, he was a distinguished Pampango poet, dramatist and newspaperman (1867-1918). Born in Sta. Ines, Bacolor, he is known as the Father of Pampango Literature. He learned his first letters from a town tutor, Cirilio Fernandez; pursued higher education under a noted teacher Vicente Quirino; wrote numerous lyrical poems, historical dramas, humorous plays, fiery editorials and philosophical essays; translated into Pampango the Spanish version of Romeo and Juliet and old European plays like the Lovers of Turuel Faust and Nero and the Gladiators; translated Rizal's Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo; joined the Philippine Revolution in 1896, and figured in\n\nseveral battles against the American forces in 1898. He wrote no less than fifty plays and sarsuwelas, the most common of which is Alang Dios or There Is No God (1901). The poetic joust crissotan was coined from his psuedonym Crissot (d. July 12, 1918). Dayrit - Cuyugan Residence\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nBuilt by the couple Joaquin Dayrit and Maria Paz Cuyugan in 1920, it is a perfect example of the architecture prevalent during the American colonial period, and is listed as a Heritage House in the registry of the National Historical Institute. Dayrit - Galang Residence\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nHome of Amando G. Dayrit, renowned journalist of pre-war fame, he is remembered for his fiery opinions in his Tribune column \"Good Morning, Judge.\" Death March Marker\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nThe site marks the endpoint of one of the most heinous war crimes committed by the Japanese in the country. The forcible transfer from Bataan of Filipino and American prisoners of war, known as the infamous Death March, ended in San Fernando in 1942. A marker has been built on the site to commemorate the day the prisoners ended their long and excruciating march and boarded box-carts that took them to their final destination in Capas, Tarlac. Flag Pole Memorial Marker (Stone #1)\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nTo the memory of the gallant men of the 26th Cavalry, Philippine Scouts and United States Army, commemorating their heroic actions in Lingayen, Luzon and Bataan, 1941-1942 (Officers Station at Fort Riley 1942).

Fort Stotsenberg Gate Posts\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nThese pillars were originally located on the right side of the Bong Highway from 1917 to 1919. They were relocated at the Consolidated Base Personnel Office (CBPO) and served as the on-base American Legion post, In 1948, these pillars were again relocated and still can be seen at the southern boundaries of the parade ground. Special crews and a giant crane were rented from Manila to do the job. A host of onlookers viewed the move and cheered as the last post was dropped very gently into its new post. The memorial marks the establishment of a small encampment in 1902 by the U.S. Cavalry due to the availability of abundant grass for their horses. The encampment was named Fort Stotsenberg in honor of Col. John M. Stotsenberg who was killed in action by Filipino forces under Gen. Mariano Llanera in Quingua, Bulacan in 1899. It was renamed Clark Air Field in 1917 in honor of Major. Harold M. Clark, U.S. Army aviator who was born in the United States, but was reared in the Philippines.\n\nFriendship Tree\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nThis tree can make the fiercest of enemies become good friends, so goes one story. Another story circulated among the service members of the US Air Force then stationed here alleges that if both you and your love interest touch this tree, you will get married, and several couples did. Henson-Hizon Residence\n\nBrgy. Sto. Rosario, Antonio Consunji St., City of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nBuilt by the couple Saturnino Henson and Maria Lacson in the late 19th century, what used to be one of the grandest houses houses in the area was partially ruined by lahar in 1995. It used to be a vacation home of the current owners, and occasionally as function hall for small group lectures and conferences. Remnants of the structure's former grandeur are evident in intricate fretwork on walls, thick metal wiring on window screens, calado design on ceiling panels, and sliding windows of colored glass and capiz shell. Vintage photographs, paintings, old prints and the Philippine flag adorn the greenish walls from the dining hall to the salon to the stairwell. Orange banquettes have been installed along one wall. A broken piano stands on a corner. This was the residence of local heroine Nicolasa Dayrit Panlilio, hence also called Casa Nicolasa. An example of the bahay na bato, it is listed as a Heritage House in the registry of the National Historical Institute. Hizon Residence\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nBuilt by the couple Teodoro Santos and Africa Ventura at the turn of the century, this Victorian-inspired ancestral residence was later acquired by Maria Hizon. Hizon-Singian House\n\nBrgy. Sto. Rosario, Antonio Consunji St., City of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nBuilt by the couple Capitan Anacleto Hizon and Victoria Singian de Miranda, it served as headquarters of Spanish General Antonio Ruiz Serralde during the Philippine Revolution, as a military hospital and barracks during the Japanese Occupation, and as headquarters to American General Walter Krueger during the liberation period. A perfect example of the bahay na bato, it is listed as a Heritage House in the registry of the National Historical Institute in 2003. Japanese Memorial Marker\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nFound behind the Lily Hill Plaza, this marker memorializes the spot where gallant Japanese soldiers made their last stand against the invading US Forces during World War II. Kamikaze East Airfield\n\nMabalacat, Pampanga\n\nIn the northernmost town of Mabalacat is a memorial marker to remember the first Japanese Kamikaze pilots called Shimpu Special Attack Corps under Lt. Yukio Seki who took off for their last mission as official \"human bombs\" on October 25, 1944. A garden shrine has been built by the local tourism office to symbolize the Philippine-Japan friendship ties. In Clark, Japanese forces staged the same air operations from the so-called west airfield by using kamikaze (divine winds) tactics against American and allied forces. Memorial & Kamikaze Peace Shrine\n\nA memorial and sign mark the site of the old runway, and it is frequently visited by tourists, especially Japanese. The memorial was built by ther Mabalacat Tourism Office: 'Not for the glorification of the Kamikaze but rather for the use of war history as a tool for the promotion of peace and friendship among nations. This shrine serves as a reminder that the Kamikaze phenomenon shall never happen again.' Lazatin Mansion\n\nBrgy. Sto. Rosario, Antonio Consunji St., City of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nBuilt by the couple Serafin Lazatin and Encarnacion Singian in 1925, this house is probably the most wellkept of the houses in San Fernando. The regal structure in white and light green has a wide, wellmanicured lawn where peacocks, pleasants and turkeys peck and strut - it looks like a scene from a movie. Visitors step on a glistening brown-and-black marble steps, lounge on a verandah with maroon tiles, before entering to marvel at the surfeit of a bric-a-brac delicately arranged in grouping from the foyer through the hallways to the antechambers. A perfect example of the architecture prevalent during the American colonial period. The house carries impressive reproductions of such items as a marble bathtub, crystal chandeliers, and furniture reminiscent of those popular in the American colonial era. This served as the residence of the Japanese general Masaharu Homma during the war. It is listed as a Heritage House in the registry of the National Historical Institute. M.A.R.S.

Among the attractions in the park are the monument of revolutionary general Maximino H. Hizon, the statues of Chief Justice Abad Santos, Governor Honorio Ventura, Sen. Benigno Aquino and the markers of the province of Pampanga and Zoilo S. Hilario. Maj. Harold M. Clark Memorial\n\nClark, Pampanga\n\nClark Air Base was renamed after Harold M. Clark, U.S. Army Signal Corps. Born in Minnesota, reared in Manila, Clark was commissioned a 2nd Lt. U.S. Cavalry in 1916.

Major Clark died on May 2, 1919 in a seaplane crash in the Milaflores Locks, Panama Canal Zone and was interred in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia. A stone marker was erected here by thirteenth U.S. Air Force July 4, 1984. Marcos Santos Residence\n\nMabalacat, Pampanga\n\nThe Marcos Santos residence is the exact location where Vic Admiral Takijro Ohnishi of the Japanese Imperial Navy organized the first Kamikaze group called the Shimpu Special Attack Corps on October 20, 1944. The first to volunteer were the 23 fliers of the 201st Air Group, 1st Air Fleet, Imperial Nippon Naval Air Force under Commander Asaichi Tamai, then stationed in Mabalacat. The Mabalacat Tourism Office supports the establishment of the Kamikaze Peace Memorial Shrine as an instrument to promote peace, friendship and undertanding among nations - that the Kamikaze phenonment shall never happen again. Monumento Fernandino\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nThe sculptural masterpiece pays tribute to the city's colorful history and cultural heritage.

Ocampo-Hizon Residence\n\nCity of San Fernando, Pampanga\n\nThe ancestral home of Fernando Ocampo, a pioneer of modern Filipino architecture. Ocampo was one of the founders of the UST School of Fine Arts and Architecture, including the founding of the Philippine\n\nArchitects Society which was later named Philippine Institute of Architects. His works include the restoration of the Manila Cathedral and Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, among others. He is a recipient of the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan Award from the City of Manila in 1964. Parade Ground\n\nClark, Pampanga ] Located in front of the former 13th Air Force building is the parade ground where a flag pole was constructed on September 16, 1906 at a cost of $220. Upon the signing of the RP-US Military Bases Agreement in 1979, the site became the only place where the American flag may be properly displayed. In 1984 at Maj. Gen.
