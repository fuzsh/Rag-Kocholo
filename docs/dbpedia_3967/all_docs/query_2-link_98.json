AT CHAPEL HILL 00041115934 FOR USE ONLY IN THE NORTH CAROLINA COLLECTION UNCPS 52962 Digitized by the Internet Archive in 2014 https://archive.org/details/nccatholicsseria2009cath from the bishop uring his pastoral visit to the United States in B April 2008, Our Holy Father Pope Benedict M XVI met with Catholic educators, including Dr. Michael Fedewa, Superintendent for Catholic Education and Formation, who represented the Diocese of Raleigh. Our Holy Father spoke these words: \"Education is integral to the mission of the Church to proclaim the Good News. First and foremost every Catholic educational institution is a place to encounter the living God who in Jesus Christ reveals His transforming love and truth.\" V7 Catholic Education Integral to the Mission of the Church At the celebration of Baptism for children, parents are reminded that they are the first and primary teachers of their children in the ways of faith. This is a privileged vocation. Rightfully, parents seek support in carrying out this awesome responsibility and, thus, they turn to their parishes and faith communities. Here, parents are supported as Catholic education and faith formation are made available on many levels and in various ways. We owe deep gratitude to our parents for the example and witness of their lives and to all who support them through a deep commitment to Catholic education and faith formation. This particular moment in the life of our Diocese, as Cathedral School and Cardinal Gibbons High School celebrate 100 years of providing Catholic Education, allows us the opportunity to focus specifically on the gift and role of our Catholic schools. What is unique about them? Catholic schools are not merely institutions which offer a program of academic excellence. On a daily basis, they provide the opportunity for students to pray together, to speak the name of Jesus, to see in their midst the crucifix and other religious signs reminding them of Gods presence, to hear the Good News proclaimed, to learn the teachings of the holy Catholic Church, to acquire a deep love and reverence for the Sacred Liturgy, and to participate in Chnstian service. Catholic schools strive to help students see all of their studies through the eyes of faith and grow in their conviction that Jesus Christ is the source of all Truth. On the occasion of this 100th anniversary of providing Catholic education in the Diocese of Raleigh, we extend sincere congratulations to all those associated with Cathedral School and Cardinal Gibbons High School both today and throughout the years; we express profound thanks to all the priests, religious, Catholic administrators and educators, and all the lay faithful who have devoted themselves to this great ministry. Our gratitude is also offered to the parents who allow our Catholic schools to assist them in the education and formation of their children. We thank you for your many sacrifices. Furthermore, we are indebted to our pastors and all those in our parishes who give of their resources to demonstrate a strong support for Catholic education. Young people often ask me, \"What is the best thing about being a bishop?\" I usually respond by speaking of my great joy in visiting our Catholic schools. I am deeply inspired by the strong Catholic identity which permeates the building. I am edified by the great commitment of our Catholic educators. I am energized by seeing the great ease with which our young people speak of their love for Jesus Christ and their desire to learn more about Him. I am in awe of the countless ways in which love for God is reflected in Christian service. Our children and young people truly love their Catholic schools and recognize what a precious gift they are to them and to the entire Diocese. I certainly agree! Thus, I renew my ongoing commitment to our Catholic schools and my pledge to make them available to as many students as possible. As Our Holy Father stated, \"Education is integral to the mission of the Church.\" May all those involved in this great ministry be renewed in their work. Please also join me in praying that our Catholic schools will continue to flourish and be places where our students \"encounter the living God who in Jesus Christ reveals His transforming love and truth.\" - Most Reverend Michael F.

Sister Marion McGillicuddy, S.U. - 65 Years Sister Marion McGillicud- dy graduated from high school in New York City at age 1 7 and entered the Sisters of St. Ursula. Founded in 1 606 in Dole, France, the Ursu- line Order was the first non-cloistered women's teaching order in the Church, and Sister Mari- on's field of ministry always has involved teach- ing. She has taught elementary school, high school, college and ESL. For several years she was Director of Education at Covenant House in New York City. Her final assignment was as a reading specialist at a public high school in Wappinger Falls School District, N.Y In 1 997 she was missioned to Rome, Italy, where she spent a year assisting religious women from the Third World with their university studies. Sister came to St. Mary's parish, Wilmington, N.C., in 1 998 where she began an ESL program for Latino newcomers. In 2001 , she moved to Transfiguration Parish in Wallace, N.C, where she continued teaching and doing advocacy ministry for Latinos in a local high school, at a chicken processing plant and at the convent in the evenings. In 2006, Sister returned to St. Mary to resume her ESL program. Sister Marion attributes her vocation to her faith-filled Irish parents, who kept God at the center of their lives. Gaelic studies have been a life-long avocation. She believes that vowed religious women represent a presence of God in society, where they serve in a wide variety of profes- sional careers and live a celibate lifestyle, becoming a leaven for society, especially in the struggle for justice. Sister Gerry Megel, O.P. - 60 Years Sister Gerry Megel, a member of the Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Mich., taught for many years - the origi- nal apostolate of her Congregation - and then began a series of minis- tries which reflect the universal call to address social justice. Sister founded and directed a shelter for families in crisis in Columbia, S.C. She then worked as a chaplain at Harper Hospital in Detroit, Ml, before returning to the south to minister at St. Paul the Apostle Parish in Greensboro, N.C. She later moved to Toronto, Canada, to help establish Romero House, a refugee center there. In 1 994 Sister Gerry became the Director of The Caring Place in Lebanon, Ky., a home for abused women and children. In 2002 she began service in the missions. In South Africa, she worked with other religious Sisters at a job skills program where young persons were given opportunities to learn a trade. Sister said that she liked getting programs started and happily moved on once they settled into a good routine. The start was often discouraging and risky; she said, but at each juncture, she believed that what she was doing was the will of God for her. Now retired, Sister lives with another Dominican Sister in Raleigh and serves with Catholic Parish Outreach. She is part of a team that prepares meals at Shepherd's Table, the soup kitchen in downtown Raleigh. Sister Gerry came from a devout Catholic family in Detroit where she was encouraged in her vocation. She believes that women continue to answer the call to serve the poor and disadvantaged and to speak against injustice. She views a conse- crated religious vocation as being a visible sign of the compassionate love of Jesus. Her life is sustained by prayer and the love of her Sisters, friends and family. NC Catholics 4 January/February 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org St. Raymond Penafort, priest Jan 7 | Solemnity of Our Lady of Prompt Succor 3 | The Baf Sister Carol Loughney, I.H.M - 50 Years Sister Carol, a member of the Sister Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of Scranton, Pa., identifies herself as a woman who loves the Church and has given her life in ministry. She has loved every min- istry of her 50 years as a teacher, school administrator, literacy teacher and now Pastoral Administrator at St. Bernadette Church in Butner. Starting with 1 5 people at Mass nine years ago, St. Ber- nadette now welcomes more than 200 parishioners each week. The spirit Sister brings to her ministries is open, hospitable, loving, generous and, especially, reconciling. Her greatest joy is working with people to be reconciled to God, themselves and the Church. She most wants people to have peace in their hearts and to be happy again. In all her ministries, Sister has been involved in parish life, preparing parishioners for the sacraments and visiting the sick. At St. Bernadette, she is delighted these ministries now draw members of the parish who prepare the parish plan, catechize children for First Sacraments, visit sick parishioners and assist with developing a new church building. Sister is now turning to the many hospi- tals and prisons in Butner to develop a Catholic presence there, in ecumenical collaboration with area churches. Sister recognizes that religious life has changed since she became a Sister. Sisters serve where there are great needs in the Church, finding community with parishioners as well as with strong bonds to the IHM Sisters. Her life is sustained by prayer and the love of friends, family and community. Sister Anne Heath, R.S.M. - 40 Years Sister Anne Heath is a member of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, a relatively new congregation formed to incorporate smaller communities of Mercy Sisters throughout North and South America. Sister was raised in a family that emphasized a life of ser- vice. She met the Mercy Sisters early in her life, and the Mercy Sisters were her teachers in high school. She recognized them as wom- en of integrity, compassion, joy and hospitality who made a fourth religious vow to serve the poor, the sick and those most in need. Sister served as a primary school teacher for 1 4 years. She earned a master's degree in Pastoral Studies at Fairfield College and served as director of faith forma- tion for the next 1 7 years, 1 4 as the founding director of faith formation at St Andrew Parish. Sister found that when parishioners approached her with a problem, other parts of their lives figured into the situation. She wanted her skills to be of greater service. Sister received her master's in social work from the Catholic University of America and is now a licensed clinical social worker in the Diocesan Office of Catholic Charities. She values the trust that adults, children and families put in her to hold their vulnerability while they work through critical areas in their lives. She is grateful to the Bishop's Annual Appeal that allows her to assist clients regardless of their ability to pay. Prayer, the love of people, the mission of mercy in the Church and the support of her family and the Mercy Sisters sustain Sister Anne. She is convinced that consecrated life will continue in the Church, serving through a more extended community of Sisters in parishes and in the missions. Sister Jeanne Morgan, S.S.J. - 50 Years Sister Jeanne Morgan is a Sister of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, Phila- delphia, Pa.. Her congregation was founded in 1 650 in Le Puy, France to be an apostolic presence in the world. Unlike the cloistered Sisters of that day, the Sisters of St. Joseph were called to go out into the city and meet the needs of the times: educa- tion, caring for prostitutes, and serving the \"dear neighbor\" through the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. In 1 847, the Sisters traveled from St. Louis to Philadelphia to care for young people and widows, and to establish hospitals and schools in a time of anti-Catholic sentiment. Sister taught in parochial schools for 1 5 years before branching into pastoral ministry as a Director of Religious Education, working with RCIA, adult faith formation, and spiritual guidance. Currently, Sister Jeanne is Pastoral Administrator at St. Elizabeth of Hungary in Raeford. St. Elizabeth of Hungary dedicated its new church in August 2008, and within weeks, the congregation grew by a third. She loves the involvement with the parishioners, helping them to see themselves differently in relationship to God and reconciling them with themselves and with the Church. Sister entered her Congregation when she was 1 8, inspired by the Sisters who had taught her in elementary and high schools. At each juncture in her life, she recalls that this is where God wants her and it is the best place for her to be. Her community welcomes new members and she foresees the day when religious communities band together for ministry. The root of all Sisters' vocation is the love of God, she says, supported through prayer and the strong support of her religious congregation and the good people she works with at St. Elizabeth of Hungary. fjpe Lord Jan 1 1 | St. Hilary, bishop and doctor of the church Jan 13 1 St Anthony, abbot Jan. .1 7 | St. Fabian, pope and martyr; St. Sebastian, martyr Jan. 20 | St. Agnes, virgin and martyr Jan. 2 1 1 mi local news mm Each month, NC Catholics will report on various initiatives and activities throughout the Diocese to incorporate the Jubilee Year of St. Paul into the spiritual formation of the faithful.

Father Paul Check to Speak on Courage and Encourage Apostolates \"I thought I had the homosexuality under control. I'd been a Catholic for five years, went to daily Mass, prayed the Rosary daily, went on one or two retreats a year and volunteered at my par- ish. Yet, after a series of crises occurred, I once again became involved in addictive, homosexual behavior. So what happened?\" These words begin the story of \"Mark,\" a member of Courage, a 28-year-old program designed to assist in- dividuals with same-sex attraction (SSA) in accordance with the teaching of the Catholic Church. Courage embraces Church teaching that SSA is not in itself sin- ful, but that homosexual acts are. The program aims to provide spiritual, moral and fraternal support to men and women who are attracted to members of the same sex, so that they can live chaste lives. The five primary objec- tives of the apostolate are chastity, prayer and devotion, fellowship, support, and serving as good examples to others. Courage has the endorsement of the Pontifical Council for the Family and currently has more than 1 1 0 chapters and coordinators worldwide. It has become a mainstream Catholic Apostolate, helping thousands of men and women find peace through fellowship, prayer and the sacramental life of the Church. In 2008, the Most Reverend Michael F. Burbidge announced the establishment of the Courage Apostolate in the Diocese of Raleigh and appointed the Reverend James Fukes, O.F.M. Conv., as its spiritual director. (Father Fukes primarily serves as pastor of St. Julia Par- ish in Siler City, N.C.) In addition to Courage, another apostolate, Encourage, is available for the pastoral and spiritual needs of parents, siblings, children and other relatives and friends of individuals who have SSA. On March 3 1 , Father Paul Check, a priest of the Diocese of Bridgeport and national director of Courage, will lead a day of reflection for priests and lay leaders in the Raleigh Diocese to educate them on SSA so they can support the apostolate. An evening session will be open to those seeking more information on the Courage and Encourage Apostolates. In a recent interview, Father Check talked about his experience in counseling those with SSA. \"The problem of same-sex attraction does not reduce well to a few words,\" he said. \"It is certainly no place for slogans or hastily formed conclusions. Most importantly, it calls for abundant and genuine charity, something that in my opinion tends to be conspicuous in its absence from much of the discussion of the topic.\" He works with both men and women, but said that the incidence of SSA is much higher among men. \"One \"God is able to make every grace abundant for you, so that in all things, always having all you need, you may have an abundance for every gOOd WOrk.\" (2 Corinthians 9:8) NC Catholics Q January/February 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org St. Vincent, deacon and martyr Jan. 22 | St. Francis de Sales, bishop and d I i thing we see over and over in the background of men with same-sex attraction is that they've suffered first because of a deficit or void in their relationship with their father, and that has caused an estrange- ment. The main problem is not the acting out of genital sex; that's a symptom. The main problem was a loss of something these men were very eager for — the 'shared delight' of a father-son relation- ship. They often suffer from what's called 'defensive detachment.' The boy knows something's wrong with the relationship with his dad, so to defend himself, he puts up an emotional wall. That desire for masculine love, acceptance and affirmation doesn't go away; it manifests itself in a distorted way when men seek homosexual relationships.\" NCC spoke with a Raleigh woman active in Encourage, who would agree with Father Check. Her son, whose father had been distant from him as a child, was 23 when he announced defiantly - by e-mail - that he was gay. \"I was devastated,\" she says. \"My son was sinning, alienating himself from me and from God, and I didn't know how to parent him. All I could say to him was 'I love you with all my heart. Stay close to God.'\" In her search for compas- sion and support, she learned about Courage/Encourage in 2004, and became an advocate for the establishment of a chapter in the Diocese of Raleigh. The perception that people with SSA are happy is a myth, she says: \"When my son is 'acting out' the gay lifestyle, his whole personality changes. He becomes distant, cruel and defensive. When he's not living it, he's just the opposite: compassionate and energetic.\" \"The problem of same-sex attraction is often vexing to those who struggle with it,\" Father Check concurs. \"Shame, loneliness and a sense of hopelessness are the enemies. Often people with SSA also struggle with sexual addiction, drug or alcohol abuse, depression, anxiety or other mental illness. This remains true even in the places where sexual promiscuity is widely tolerated. Men and women with SSA — perhaps up to 40 percent - may very likely have been the victims of sexual abuse as a child.\" For reasons like these, the Raleigh mother stresses, people with SSA need to feel safe. \"Many of them are very sensitive,\" she says. \"They are hurting spiritually, emotionally and mentally.\" That safe environment is one of the goals of Courage. \"Courage is not about changing people,\" she says. \"It's about helping them to a conversion of heart, to chastity and trust in the Lord.\" Through her attendance at Encourage, she sees hope. \"Encour- age works on me,\" she explains, \"not my son. We believe that as we grow, our children will grow as well. And I think my son will. I believe the Lord hears a mother's cry. In Encourage, we've seen a lot of rejoicing out of the tragedy that brought us together.\" \"Regrettably,\" Father Check says, \"many people think that all the Catholic Church offers to men and women with SSA is 'no.' Like all good mothers, the Church does say 'no' to the self-destructive and counterfeit pleasure of sin, out of a sense of love for God's children. Yet that 'no' is embedded in a larger 'yes,' a yes to Him who is Love, and who gave Himself to the Father and to us from the Cross. The Lord asked St. Paul to find strength in his weakness through the power of the Cross. The Courage apostolate expresses that same redemptive paradox to men and women with SSA and urges them to trust in what they see in the life of the Master and His apostle.\" For further information about Courage, Encour- age and Father Check's visit on March 3 1 , contact Father Fukes at St. Julia Parish, 210 Harold Hart Road, Siler City, N.C 27344, 91 9.742.5584. New African-Ancestry Ministry Director Appointed ►► The Most Reverend Michael F. Burbidge announced the appointment of Mrs. Lauren Green to the position of Diocesan director of African-Ancestry Ministry and Evangeliza- tion, effective Jan. 5. The appointment was made upon the recommendation of Rev. Msgr. Thomas P. Hadden, vicar for African-Ancestry, and the search commit- tee created to fill the position. A native of Baltimore, Green has a BA in chemistry from Randolph- Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Va. She has a MA in history from the University of Colorado and has done post-graduate work at the University of Arkansas. She and her husband, Kevin, have been involved in RCIA training since their time in Colorado. They moved to North Carolina in 1 997, when she began teaching history at St. Augustine's College in Raleigh. She then accepted a position assisting the adminis- trative effort in creating Catholic schools at St. Michael's Church in Cary and St. Mary Magdalene Church in Apex. Green, a parishioner at St. Michael, has been involved in youth ministry at the parish since 2000. Active in the African-Ancestry Ministry and Evangelization Chapter at St. Michael's, she became a member of the Diocesan African-Ancestry Ministry Board in 2002, taking over as chair of the board in May 2008. \"I sought this position because it was a natural step in my personal level of commitment to the ministry,\" Green said. \"I am interested in tak- ing the office to the next level. We do ministry very well. The challenge is to become as good at evangelization as we are at ministry.\" Msgr. Hadden Celebrates Golden Jubilee Rev. Msgr. Thomas P. Hadden celebrated his 50th Anniversary of priesthood with a Jubilee Mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral on Dec. 20, 2008. Msgr. Hadden was ordained in Rome in 1 958 as a priest of the Diocese of Raleigh upon his graduation from the North American College in Rome. Approximately 30 priests concelebrated the Liturgy in the presence of Most Reverend Michael F. Burbidge. Rev. Msgr. Gerald L. Lewis was the homilist. In his homily, Msgr. Lewis spoke of how Mary accepted the announcement that she was chosen to be the Mother of the Savior. He said, \"As we look forward to the greatest gift God can give us, we look back to another call more than 50 years ago.\" Msgr. Lewis spoke of the influence the Immaculate Heart of Mary Sisters and Dominican priests at Saint Monica's Parish in Raleigh had on young Thomas Paul and the call he accepted to serve God. Msgr. Lewis spoke of the challenges Msgr. Hadden faced as a seminarian, having to enroll at a preparatory seminary in Mississippi to study for the priesthood and how he was invited to become a seminar- ian of his home Diocese by Bishop Vincent S. Waters, the third Bishop of Raleigh. Msgr. Hadden faced another challenge, Msgr. Lewis said, when he \"became the first African-American pastor of an historic and predominately white parish in the South,\" St. Paul Church in New Bern He spoke of the \"slights\" Msgr. Hadden endured from the people in the community, as well as in the parish. \"Father Hadden continued his daily pastoring and because of his goodness he became accepted and loved,\" Msgr. Lewis said. \"Many who had vocally rejected him at his appointment became his ardent supporters and wept when eventually his transfer came.\" In his remarks, Bishop Burbidge expressed gratitude to Bishop Waters for inviting Thomas Paul Hadden to serve as a priest in the Diocese, noting, \"What a great gift the Bishop gave to us.\" Mf the church Jan. 24 | Ss. Timothy and Titus, bishops Jan. 26 | St. Angela Merici, virgin Jan. 27 St. Thomas Aquinas, priest and doctor of the church Jan. 28 | St. John Bosco, priest Jan 31 r Dear NCC: truthful choices of conscience? One recurrent theme in bioethical discussions is the idea that each of us possesses a basic awareness of the moral law. This distinctly human faculty, which Western culture has referred to as \"conscience,\" helps us to choose correctly when confronted with basic moral decisions. Even children, when taught about right and wrong, instinctively seem to recognize a law higher than themselves. Deep within his conscience man discovers that law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey Conscience has been aptly described as mans most secret core and his sanctuary. ear N This month with Father Tad Pacholczyk M r t- \\ A w f*- .1 Father Tad Pacholczyk - Rev. Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D. earned his doctorate in neurosci- ence from Yale and did post-doctoral work at Harvard. He is a priest of the diocese of Fall River, Mass., and serves as the director of education at the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia. (www.ncbcenter.org) As creatures of conscience, then, we are moved to pursue good and to avoid evil. Yet, in our fallen nature, we are also drawn, mysteriously, toward wrong and harmful choices. The dictates of conscience may become muted or drowned out by other voices around us. As we grow older, we may even acquire a certain finesse in justifying personal choices that are not good, choices strongly contrary to the law of our own being. The inner sanctuary of conscience is delicate and easily transgressed, requiring great attentiveness on our part if we are to remain faithful to it. I recall a powerful story about conscience involving a young couple who cohabitated for many years. Neither of them were thinking much about marriage and one day the fellow learned his girlfriend was pregnant. Being Catholic, he approached his priest. All three of them met one afternoon, had rather lengthy discussions and finally reached a decision together. They decided abortion was not an option. They talked about the possibility of marriage at some time in the near future. Later the same day the parents of the young woman came by the couple's house. They had been fairly open and accepting of this 'live-in' situation. Over dinner it came out that she was pregnant. Things changed as a result of this revelation. After the meal, the mother pulled her daughter aside saying, \"Look, you've got a life to live. You don't want to spend the rest of your life with this guy. C'mon, dear, you've got to get an abortion.\" The next day, the young man and the young woman ran into the priest. The fellow brought up the discussion with the mother and said they were reconsidering the abortion option. The priest replied, \"We reached a decision on that already.\" The young man quickly answered, \"What do you mean? If I make a decision today, 1 can change it tomorrow.\" The priest responded simply, \"For certain kinds of decisions, you can't change your mind. If you go back on your decision now, I won't know who you are anymore ...\" The young man was shaken by this answer, but when he reflected on it later, he understood the priest was right. Certain kinds of personal choices touch us at the very core of our being. Accepting or rejecting a temptation to serious wrongdoing like abortion involves our hearts in a far deeper way than many of the lesser decisions we have to make each day. NIC Catholics Q January/February 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org The Presentation of the Lord Feb. 2 | St. Blaise, bishop and martyr; St. Ansgar, bishop from the editor Learning to Know, Worship and Serve the Lord In the end, it is our moral choices that define who we are and what we become. By acting against an upright conscience, we violate and disfigure who we are - and become less human. That's why the priest told the young man that he would not know who he was anymore. I recall another true story about the gentle proddings of conscience that involved a mom with three children. When she found out she was pregnant yet again, she became fearful and began telling herself she couldn't support the burden of another child. She finally decided it would be necessary to have an abortion. She arrived at her decision just before going in for her next check- up. The doctor, unaware of her plans, began a routine ultrasound to find out how the pregnancy was progressing. She had brought along her three children, and they were busy playing together on the floor of the examination room. As the doctor ran the scanner over her belly her little son glanced up from his toy airplanes, pointed to the screen and said, \"Look, Mommy — a baby!\" She left the doctor's office that afternoon with a new awareness that she couldn't end the growing life within her. Through the eyes and heart of a child we are often reminded of what a pure and upright conscience ought to look like. To form our conscience as adults means to learn virtue, by repetitively and determinately choosing what is good, true and moral. Doing so brings order to our lives and engenders peace in our hearts. Ultimately, we discover how to be fully human only to the extent that we faithfully follow that delicate voice of a properly-formed conscience.

Fortunately, almost 20,000 of them learn to know, worship and serve the Lord through parish faith formation programs, where they are taught by nearly 3000 catechists, most of them volunteers. Sister Rose Adams, IHM, Diocesan Director of Evangelization and Catechesis, explained that the goal of these programs is to form and eventually transform the whole person of each participant. Religious education begins by impaning basic knowledge of the faith and the meaning of the liturgy and the sacraments. It provides moral formation and an understanding of how to pray. Fi- nally, the students learn to participate in the life and mission of the Church and to live as Catholics in the wider community. Equipped with the religious education they receive through the dedicated catechists in their parishes, children who attend public schools in turn become Catholic educators, by word and example, to their peers of other faiths. This is par- ticularly true in North Carolina, where the Catholic faith is still misunderstood or distrusted by many. In discussing faith formation, I would be remiss if I omitted home schooling families, who take it entirely upon themselves to impart the fullness of the faith to their children. And the truth is, no matter what school a Catholic child attends, \"It is particularly in the Christian family, enriched by the grace of the sacrament of matrimony that children should be taught to have a knowledge of God, to worship Him and to love their neighbor.\" (Vatican II Declaration on Christian Education, 1965, # 12) One more Catholic school story: It's about a non- Catholic boy, born in Raleigh, whose loving education by IHM Sisters resulted not only in his joining the Catholic Church but in discerning a call to the priest- hood. He was ordained in Rome 50 years ago and has served the Diocese faithfully and energetically even in \"retirement,\" ever since. Among his many activities, he still finds time to write a column for each issue of this magazine. NCC congratulates Msgr.

But what exactly do these words mean? ► Type: a person or event that, while retaining its own value, also points to something else. Its function is to prepare or prefigure what is to come. There are many \"types\" in Scripture. Mary is a type of the Church because in her person and in her role in God's plan she shows us all that the Church is and does, (lg 64) ► Model: someone or something that is to be imitated. Some Catholics reject Mary's assistance, seeing her perfection as an unattainable standard. Yet, it is precisely because Mary is a human creature like us that she is able to help us so much! Mary always leads us to her Son. She is the model of all virtues, and by her perfect faith and loving union with Christ she teaches us how to imitate Him and to seek His will in all things. Lumen Gentium (The Dogmatic Constitution of the Church) aims at leading all the faith- ful to reflect more fully on the Church's nature and universal mission. For Part I of our consid- eration of this important Vatican II document, we will focus on the mystery of the communion of saints, and specifically on the role of Mary. Mary, Mother of the People of God The day Lumen Gentium was promulgated, Pope Paul VI declared \"Mary, Mother of the Church\" as an official title for Our Lady. He hoped that the title - which actually had been used to refer to Mary since the 12th century - would promote greater devotion and recourse of the faithful to invoke the Blessed Virgins aid as our mother. During the month of May, which is dedicated to Our Lady, we pray in a special way for her protection and guidance of the Church and all her children. The Church is a mystery. It is a reality imbued with the hidden presence of God. It lies hidden within the very nature of the Church to be always open to new and ever greater exploration.\" These words, stated by Pope Paul VI in his opening ad- dress to the second session of Vatican II, capture the very heart of one of the central documents of the Council: The Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. This pivotal document, also known by its Latin name, Lumen Gentium, aims at leading all the faithful to reflect more fully on the Church's \"nature and universal mission.\" (lg d For Part I of our consideration of Lumen Gentium, we will focus on the mystery of the communion of saints, and specifically on the role of Mary The Catechism explains that there are three states of the Church: the visible members on earth, the souls being purified in purgatory and the souls in heaven enjoying the beatific vision, (ccc 954) It is the constant teaching of the Church that a unity exists among believers in Christ, characterized by a sharing of spiritual goods. This is the basis of seeking the intercession of the saints and taking them as models for living out ones own faith, for \"by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped.\" (lg 49) NC Catholics \"| Q Jaimaiy/Fdvuary 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org the Seven Founders of the Order of ! The Blessed Virgin Mary in Lumen Gentium In writing Lumen Gentium, the Council Fathers of Vatican II understood well that that \"Mary's role in the Church is in- separable from her union with Christ and flows directly from it.\" (CCC964, LG 57) There was considerable debate about whether Mary should be discussed in an entirely separate document, or whether she should be included in the document on the Church. The Holy Spirit guided the Council Fathers to decide to emphasize Marys role as a pre-eminent member of the Church. In placing the chapter on Mary in the document, the Council Fathers wished to communicate to the faithful that she is the Model of the Church and \"unites and mirrors within herself the central truths of the faith.\" (67) Mary, Mother of Christ Among the principal aims of Lumen Gentium was to \"de- scribe with diligence both the role of the Blessed Virgin in the mystery of the Incarnate Word and the Mystical Body.\" (54) In continuity with Church teaching over the ages, the document reaffirms the integral role, willed by God, of Mary as Mother of Christ. \"Embracing Gods salvific will with a full heart and impeded by no sin, she devoted herself totally as a handmaid of the Lord to the person and work of her Son, under Him and with Him, by the grace of almighty God, serving the mystery of redemption.\" (56) Mary and the work of redemption Lumen Gentium states that it pleased God not only to place Mary at Christ's side throughout His life as mother, but also that He willed for Mary to participate in Christ's work of redemption. This unique share in Christ's redemptive work climaxed at the foot of the Cross. At Calvary, Mary \"faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, grieving exceedingly with her only begotten \"She IS the Son, uniting herself with a maternal heart Model of the with His sacrifice, and lovingly consenting to Church and the immolation of this Victim which she her- \"unites and self had brought forth.\" (59) By uniting herself mirrors within with Christ's sacrifice and offering Christ and herself the her own sufferings in union with those of central truths her Son, Mary participated in the very act of of the faith.\" bringing supernatural life to souls. Mary, Mother of the Church \"Woman, behold thy son.\" (John 19 26) These words, spo- ken by Christ to Mary are significant for all members of the Church today. Before breathing His last, Jesus entrusted each of His children whom He was dying to redeem, represented by John, to the care of His mother. Mary was and is the mother of Christ in the order of nature, and the mother of all members of the People of God, in the order of grace, (cf. Rev 1217) \"Behold Thy Mother.\" (John 19:27) From His words on the cross, it is clear that Jesus wills for each of His children to not only esteem, but to have a special relationship to Mary as spiritual mother. By honoring Mary, the \"duties of redeemed mankind toward the Mother of God, who is mother of Christ and mother of men, particularly of the faithful\" are fulfilled. (54) - Sister Maria Faustina Showalter, O R, Sister John Mary Corbett, O R, Sister Maria Gemma Martek, O.R, and Sister Elizabeth Ann O'Reilly, O.R Do Catholics worship Mary? No. Although Mary is honored as the mother of Jesus, we adore and worship God alone. Latria adoration or worship - is owed to God because of His Divinity and infinite majesty. To the saints and angels, we offer dulia veneration and reverence - because of their relation to God and their participation in the beatific vision. To acknowledge Mary's unique and important role in salvation history as the Theotokos the Mother of God. We offer her the highest form of veneration: hyperdulia However, the line between our devotion to Mary and the worship of God remains distinct. Jesus loved, honored and obeyed His mother while on earth. As He was dying on the cross, He gave her to us as our own mother. Mary's motherhood of mankind \"in no way obscures or diminishes the unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its power\" (lg 60) Mary never takes the place of her Son, but brings us to Him in the quickest and surest way. All properly ordered devotion to Mary is always Christ-centered. IShe is Mother of God - Because Mary gave birth to the second person of the Blessed Trinity made flesh, she is truly the \"Mother of God.\" 2 She is Ever Virgin - Mary remained a virgin, before, during and after the birth of Jesus. 3 She is the Immaculate Conception - Mary was immaculately conceived in the womb of her mother. She was preserved from the stain of original sin from the very moment of her conception. This does not mean that Mary had no need of redemption, but rather that she was redeemed in a wholly unique fashion. 4 Mary was assumed into heaven - At the end of her life on earth, Mary was taken up into heaven, body and soul, where she continually intercedes with her Son for us. «, religious Feb. 1 7 | St. Peter Damian, bishop and doctor of the church Feb 21 | St. Polycarp, bishop and martyr Feb. 23 | Ash Wednesday Feb. 25 The truth about Mary saint of the month o live uretania Feast day: January 1 2 Meaning of name: Arcadia is a region in Greece, derived from the Greek word \"arktos,\" meaning bear. Claim to fame: At the beginning of the fourth century, Christian persecution prevailed in the Roman Empire. Instead of burning sacrifice to pagan gods to prove devotion to the state, St. Arcadius fled. In the countryside, he lived a peaceful existence praying and waiting for an end to the Chris- tian slaughter. However, when Roman soldiers investigated St. Arcadius' disappearance, they seized his relative to use as ran som, demanding St. Arcadius return. Informed of his relative's danger and not wanting him to suffer on his behalf, he went to the city of Mauritania and turned himself over to the Roman authorities. At his trial, the judge said he would pardon him on the condition he would sacrifice to the gods. St. Arcadius refused, saying, \"Jesus Christ is my life, and death is my gain. Invent what torments you please; but know that nothing shall make me a traitor to my God.\" The governor, in a rage, vowed he would make St. Arcadius beg for death. \"Take him, and let him see and desire death, without being able to obtain it.\" Instead of beheading — the punishment typical for Christians during this period - the judge punished St. Arcadius' faithful- ness to God with dismemberment. Why he is a saint: Understanding the severity of torture for crimes of Christianity, St. Arcadius refused to sacrifice his faith to uphold the state religion. He said, \"You who have been present at this bloody tragedy . . . learn that all torments seem as nothing to one who has an everlasting crown before his eyes ... He alone, for whom I suffer and die, is the true God ... To die for him is to live; to suffer for him is to enjoy the greatest delights.\" Best quote: As St. Arcadius felt each of his limbs sev- ered from his body, he responded continually, \"Lord, teach me your wisdom.\" St. Arcadius' torturers had forgotten to remove his tongue. San Arcadio de Mauritania Fecha liturgica: 1 2 de enero Significado del Nombre: Arcadia es una region de Grecia y el nombre deriva de la palabra griega arktos que significa soportar Es conocido por: A principios del cuarto siglo, la persecucion a los cristianos se imponia en el imperio Romano. En vez de ofrecer sacrificios a dioses paganos para demostrar su devocion al Estado el prefirio huir. En el campo, vivio una pacifica existencia orando y esperando el final de la matanza de cristianos. Sin embargo cuando los soldados romanos investi- garon la desaparicion de Arcadio, retuvieron a un pariente con rehen, exigiendo a Arcadio que regrese. Al saber del peligro que corria su pariente y no queriendo que sufra por su culpa, el se entrego a las autoridades romanas. Durante el juicio, el juez ofrecio perdonarlo a cambio de una sacrificio a los dioses. Arcadio rechazo esto diciendo \" Jesucristo es mi vida y la muerte es ganancia para mi. Pueden inventar todos los tormentos que deseen para mi, pero sepan que nada me hara traicionar a mi Dios\". El Gobernador, lleno de furia, le juro que lo haria rogar por su muerte. \"Llevenselo y hagan que desee la muerte, sin dejar que la obtenga\". En vez de decapitarlo, como a la mayoria de los cristianos en esa epoca, el juez castigo la fidelidad de Arcadio hacia Dios decretando que sus miembros sean despedazados. cPor que es un santo?: Sabiendo de la severidad de las torturas impuestas a los cristianos, Arcadio se nego a rechazar su fe por la religion del Estado. El dijo: \"listed que han presen- ciado esta sangrienta tragedia... .sepan que todos estos tormen- tos no significa nada para alguien que tiene una corona eterna frente a sus ojos... El, por quien sufro y muero, es el unico y verdadero Dios.Morir por el es vivir y sufrir por el es disfrutar de uno de los gozos mas grandes\" Frase mas recordada: Mientras Arcadio sentia como le iban cortando cada uno de sus miembros, el clamaba constan- temente \"Senor, ensehame tu sabiduria\". Los torturadotes de Arcadio olvidaron remover su lengua.

Why? The answer is simple: We have a history to make known. We are part of the story of America. It might be a good idea to buy and read a book of his- tory concerning black people in America. There is a rich history if we would unveil it. We, as a people, are still making history. We could approach this history from the Catholic perspective. Father Cyprian Davis, O.S.B., of St. Memrad Archabbey recently revised his book The Histoiy of Black Catholics in the United States. It is accepted as a master- piece. It is filled with history that lovers of the Church should read. He has written other books on black history as well, and many articles for various publications In his book, Fr. Cyprian highlights the courage of Archbishop Ritter of St Louis, Archbishop O'Boyle of Washington and our own Bishop Vincent S. Waters of Raleigh who, between 1947 and 1954, ended segregation in their dioceses. Recently another chapter in black Catholic history was written. Dr. Joseph Francis, president of Xavier University in New Orleans, is celebrating 40 years as the only black president of a Catholic institution of higher learning. This university was founded by St. Katherine Drexel. Catholics also took part in the crusade of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. The TV screens were filled with the pic- tures of priests and religious women in their habits on the march for freedom and equality for all. There also is a rich history in the broader spectrum of our nation and our state. There are the unsung heroes who put their lives in danger to end segregation in our na- tion and in our states. In the universi- ties of our state, there are now black ' professors and scholars in residence. Dr. John Hope Franklin at Duke University is a recognized historian of Ithe black presence in our country. He has recently written Mirror to America: The Autobiography oj John Hope Franklin. There is Dr. Maya Angelou, a poet who is the Artist in Residence at Wake Forest University. A visit to various bookstores, including Catholic stores, online or on foot can be rewarding. - Msgr. Thomas E Hadden Al comenzar el ano tenemos la es- peranza que muchas cosas van a cambiar para mejorar; confiamos en tener un nuevo presidente, un nuevo programa de gobierno, unos suefios para tener una reforma migratoria, tenemos retos tan grandes como el de cambiar la economla, reconciliar a los pueblos, restablecer la justicia, la paz y la dignidad de las personas, sanar al mundo de la miseria, del hambre, de la opresion y de la violencia. Pero el cambio no esta solo en las personas que dirigen los pueblos o administran los servicios de la sociedad, en los millonarios o en los que padecen la pobreza o sufren por la guerra y la discrimination sobre la tierra. El verdadero cambio se encuentra en cada ser humano que busca recuperar los valores, respetando la vida, armonizando la convivencia, comprometiendose con la solidaridad, Haciendo de la familia la primera Iglesia, la primera escuela y el mejor lugar. Como cristianos estamos invitados a hacer que nuestra esperanza brille como el sol, no para ignorar el mal, sino para fecundar las decisiones de nuestro obrar, para ilumi- nar nuestras decisiones y llevarnos a generar verdaderos cambios en el ser humano, la familia y la comunidad. No podemos sentarnos a esperar que una persona cam- bie los destinos del mundo, sino que tenemos que generar los cambios desde el interior de cada persona, haciendo que beneficien la vida, la convivencia y el futuro de todas las personas. No podemos acabar el mal por un decreto, por una ley o por la indiferencia. Solamente podemos hacerlo cuando cada ser humano renuncie desde su corazon, se comprometa en transformar la oscu- ridad de su pecado con la luz de la fe, la verdad y la justicia. Cristo es esa fuerza y es la esperanza de todo el mundo. Cuando El reine en el corazon de las personas, podra iluminar las institucio- nes y a los que gobiernan. Cristo es la fuerza de Dios que con su amor trans- forma la vida de los pecadores, sana el corazon de los enfermos y muere para reconciliar a todos. Por eso, no olvidemos en quien esta puesta nues- tra esperanza y cual es nuestra mision para ayudar a cambiar nuestra vida, nuestra familia, la comunidad, la Iglesia y por consiguiente al mundo. - Padre Fernando Torres How is an institution • like a person?

As both institutions celebrate their centennials this year, they also celebrate the men and women whose faith and character they have formed, and the vitality with which they continue to expand and enrich their ministries. They celebrate as well the special conviction that has always been at the center of Catholic education. Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness expressed it at his Silver Jubilee in 1943, when the world was at war. \"We stand for parochial education,\" he said, \"because we feel religious training is a vital part of instruction. A wider vision of God is necessary. Our very world troubles today, in which we see brother fighting brother, and nation against nation, are caused by a dethronement of thought. Religion forgotten, greed and selfishness hold sway.\" Si story Today, in a world where greed and selfishness are still rampant, Jason Curtis, the principal of CGHS, puts it this way: \"We want our graduates to know that God loves them and has called them to love others, and that this knowledge inspires them to use the gifts that God has given them in the service and leadership of their Church and community We want them to under- stand that they have a great responsibility to those around them, and that by using their gifts they are giving glory to God.\" The stories of Sacred Heart and Cardinal Gibbons are ex- amples of the broader story of Catholicism in North Carolina, and their themes are the same: perseverance, solidarity and hope in times of hardship. Alumna Ann Hall Marshall, who gradu- ated with three other students in 1938, says the most important lesson she learned in high school was this: \"You do the best with what you have.\" That spirit was still strong when Frank Prevo, Class of '57, attended high school. \"A lesson I have never forgot- ten, he says, \"is that one can accomplish much with little. 1 viv- idly remember the words of our principal, Sister M. Rose Imelda, OP, when the students mentioned it would really be nice if our school had a gymnasium and a football field. She said that we may not have a gymnasium, football field or facilities like other schools, but our textbooks are as good or better! We laughed, made do with what we had and never stopped daydreaming. Just look at us now!\" Certainly there have been times in the history of both schools when the only reason to continue was that it was important to the Church and important to the families in Raleigh who wanted their children to have a Catholic education. Marshall remembers 1934, when the high school graduated just one student, who almost missed the ceremony after being quarantined for measles. John Ruocchio graduated from CGHS in 1983 and remembers \"It was a very close environment. We were family.

We were a place where everyone mattered.\" Today, that attitude includes those outside the schools as well as \"family.\" CGHS senior Abigail Bouchon says CGHS helped foster her passion for volunteering. \"When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005,\" she says, \"1 didn't quite know what I could do to help; only that I wanted to help. It was the first time that I had felt like I could make a difference. A teacher at Gibbons recognized this desire in me and introduced me to a service event called the Box-a-Thon, where students live the life of a homeless teenager for 24 hours and raise money for disaster relief in New Orleans. The experience was incredible, and my initial desire to help others turned into a passion for volunteer- ing, fueled by Gibbons' active outreach program and the continual support of teachers. Now as a senior I'm leading the Box-a-Thon, and this year we had 42 student participants raise more than $15,000 for local charities.\" Encouragement to service starts in the early grades.

A veces se piensa de los catolicos que sus creencias no son biblicas, pero esto no es cierto! No hay ninguna doctrina catolica que no este por lo menos implicita en las Escrituras. A continuation les brindamos una breve sinopsis de la evidencia de las doctrinas catolicas en las Escrituras que son consideradas como extraidas de la Biblia. ► La Eucaristi'a es el Cuerpo y la Sangre de Cristo: 1 Corintios 10:16, 1 1:27-30; Mateo 26926- 28; Marcos 14:22-24; Lucas 22:1 9-20; Juan 6:47-63,66 ► La veneration a la Virgen Maria: Lucas 1 :28 41-43, 48; Juan 19:25-27; Apocalipsis 12:1-6 ► La intercesion de los Santos: Jeremias 1 5:1 ; 2 Macabeos 1 5:1 4; Mateo 22:30; Lucas 15:10; 1 Corintios 4:9; Hebreos 12:1; Apocalipsis 5:8, 6:9-10 ► Reliquias: Hechos 19:11-12 ► Poder de los Sacerdotes para perdonar los pecados: Mateo 16:19, 1 8:1 5-1 8; Juan 20:23 ► Infalibilidad Papal: Mateo 16:18-19; Lucas 22:31-32; Juan 21:15-17 ► Purgatorio: Salmos 66:1 2; Isaias 4:4, 6:5-7; Miqueas 7:8- 9; Malaqui'as 3:2-4; 2 Mace 1 2:39-42, 44-45; Mateo 5:25- 26, 1 2:32; Efesios 4:8-10, 1 Corintios 3:1 1-15; Apocalipsis 21:27 ► Angeles Guardianes: Salmos 34:7, 91:1 1; Mateo 18:10, Hechos 12:15, Hebreos 1:14 Quizas alguna vez hayan visto la comedia romantica Tienes un E-mail t Mail en ingles), en ella refleja la emotion de las personas al recibir correspondencia de sus seres queridos y con esta carta de Amor de Dios, jtodos recibimos un correo y debemos sentirnos emocionados al leerlo! La revelacion de Dios en la Escritura es como un \"manual de instruccion\" en nuestras vidas, pero en realidad, la Palabra escrita de Dios es similar a una carta de amor y no a un manual de instruccion. El Dei Verbum nos dice \"... en los libros sagrados, el Padre que esta en el cielo viene con amor a recibir a Sus hijos y habla con ellos.\" (dv 21) Pnmero que todo, hay ciertos hechos con relation a las Sagradas Escrituras que el Dei Verbum claramente expone y que sirve como los cimientos de nuestro entendimiento. Dios es el autor de la sagrada Escritura la cual es la Palabra de Dios por escrito bajo la inspiracion del Espiritu Santo. La palabra inspirada significa literalmente \"espirada por Dios\" porque El es el autor y las Escrituras tienen el carisma de la inspiracion. Dios inspiro a los autores de la Biblia y ellos no solo copiaron lo que el Espiritu Santo les dictaba, sino que Dios utilizo el maximo de sus facultades y poderes para que El actuase con ellos y por ellos; fue por medio de estos autores que consignaron a traves de la escritura todo lo que El queria por escrito.\" (dv id La inspiracion es algo misteriosa, pero entendemos como funciona si hacemos una analogia con la Incarnation: de la misma manera que la segunda Persona de la Trinidad asumio un caracter humano, Dios se ha expresado en \"la palabra del hombre\" a traves de la ayuda de autores humanos. (dv 13) La Sagrada Escritura nos ensena la verdad. La doctrina de inerrancia sigue logicamente la inspiracion de las Escrituras y puesto que Dios es el autor de las Escrituras, todo lo que lo autores afirman es confirmado por el Espiritu Santo. NC Catholics \"| 3 January /F ebruary 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org Comprension de la sagrada Escritura Dei Verbum explica como debemos comprender o interpretar el significado de las Escrituras, por ejemplo: Dei Verbum expone que debido a que los autores son mismos autenticos es importante entender la intencion de los mismos para capturar el significado del pasaje. Esto significa que cuando leemos la Biblia, debemos preguntarnos cual es el proposito del autor al escribir cierto pasaje: ^La intencion del autor fue la de narrar una historia, un cuento, una parabola o una profecia? ^El pasaje es una oracion o un poema? La verdad es expresada de diferentes maneras de acuerdo al tipo de texto. Muchas de las contradicciones aparentes en la Escritura se pueden resolver teniendo en cuenta que la intencion del autor no siempre fue que tomaramos el significado de forma literal. Sin embargo, la regla mas importante para comprender la Escritura dada por el Dei Verbum, \"debe leerse y ser interpretada bajo la luz del mismo Espiritu por la cual fue escrita.\" (dv id El Espiritu Santo quien inspire a los autores de la Biblia es el mismo Espiritu que guia a la Iglesia hacia la verdad. (Juan 14:25-26) Ninguna verdad de la revelacion puede contradecir a otras verdades de la revelacion. Una prueba de autenticidad de la revelacion es si es consistente con ambos, el contenido y la unidad de toda la Escritura, y la tradicion viva de la Iglesia. (dv 12) Muchos de los pasajes de la Escritura son malinterpretadas porque han sido sacadas de su contexto. La Biblia proviene de la tradicion viva de la Iglesia y no viceversa. Los sucesores de Pablo y de los Apostoles, el Papa y Obispos en union a El, autorizaron los libros de la Escritura. Todavia, la tarea de interpretar la Escritura hoy en dia es realizada por el Papa y por obispos en union a El en el Magisterio. jDebemos tomar una pausa por un momento y considerar este gran don! Dios no nos dejo solos para entender Sus palabras, El nos ha garantizado el correcto entendimiento de la Biblia por medio de la Iglesia. Sin esta autoridad que nos guie, podriamos estar expuestos a la interpretacion subjetiva de una sola persona. Jesucristo es el centre de las Escrituras: Finalmente, se debe decir una palabra o dos del Evangelio, el \"corazon de toda las Escrituras.\" (cic 215) Jesucristo es el centre de toda revelacion y Su Evangelio es el centre o el corazon de las Escrituras. Todo lo incluido en el Antiguo Testamento nos guia a Cristo, y todo lo que esta en el Nuevo Testamento hace referenda a El. San Agustin expreso: \"Dios. . . inteligentemente organizo que el Nuevo Testamento estuviese oculto en el Antiguo y el Antiguo se manifieste en el Nuevo.\" Hoy en dia, algunas personas cuestionan la fiabilidad de los Evangelios como documentos historicos. En la superficie, pareciera que los cuatro autores del Evangelio se contradicen y no pueden contarse como fuentes confiables. Sin embargo, es importante recordar que los autores del Evangelio no tuvieron la intencion de rendirnos \"cuentas\" de la vida de Cristo. Dei Verbum nos explica de la siguiente manera: \"Los autores cuando escribieron los cuatro Evangelios, seleccionaron ciertos elementos que han sido transmitidos por via oral 0 de forma escrita; otros sintetizaron 0 explicaron con perspective la situacion de las iglesias, manteniendo la predicacion, siempre diciendonos la verdad acerca de Jesus.\" (dv 19) - Hermana Maria Faustina Showalter, O R, Hermana John Mary Corbett, O.P., Hermana Maria Gemma Martek, O P, and Hermana Elizabeth Ann O'Reilly, O P 4 maneras de incorporar la sagrada nuestra vida diaria iDe cualquier manera en la que usted decida incorporar las Escrituras en su vida, jamas se arrepentira! Recuerde que El prometio lo siguiente \"el que busca encuentra\" asi que si quiere conocer mejor a Dios en Su Palabra, sera bendecido en abundancia. IReflexione en la lectura diaria de las Escrituras. La iglesia se ha encargado de presentar la Palabra de Dios a los feligreses durante la Liturgia de la Palabra entre las Misas dominicales y las Misas semanales. El Leccionario esta organizado en ciclos sistematicos entre textos biblicos del Antiguo y Nuevo Testamento los cuales cubren una vasta representacion de las Escrituras durante el curso de los anos. Si puede o no asistir a Misa, lea y reflexione las lecturas diarias, siguiendo el Misal Romano o buscando las lecturas en su Biblia. 2 Ore en la Liturgia de las Horas. La Liturgia de las Horas, es realizada a diario por el clero, los religiosos y los laicos del mundo entero. Las horas estan compuestas por salmos y lecturas breves de las Escrituras, mas oraciones de alabanza y peticiones. Puede obtener un breviario, el libro de oracion de la Liturgia de las Horas, en las librerias catolicas. 3Asista a un grupo de estudios biblicos. Pregunte en su parroquia sobre los grupos de estudio para conocer a Dios en la Escritura y estudiar Su Palabra con los demas. Pregunte en su libreria catolica mas cercana por material de estudio para aprender por su cuenta de no estar disponible ningiin grupo de estudio en su parroquia. 4 Lea la Biblia todos los dias. Dedique una parte de su tiempo para leer la Biblia y reflexionar acerca de lo que Dios quiere comunicarle; puede ser tan formal como un Lectio Divina, metodo de lectura y contemplacion de las Escrituras, o tan simple como leer un Salmo o un capitulo de los Evangelios a diario. Deje que el Espiritu Santo lo guie en su seleccion y lea con detenimiento, para que asi le llegue hasta el corazon. Jwerido lector de NCC Por: Padre Tad Pacholczyk Dear NCC: <LC6mo podemos tomar buenas decisiones de conciencia? La idea de que todos y cada uno de nosotros es capaz de un entendimiento basico de la ley moral es un concepto siempre presente en la argumentation bioetica. Esta capacidad distintiva del ser humano, que en la cultura occidental conocemos como \"conciencia\", nos ayuda a elegir correctamente cuando tenemos que tomar algunas decisiones morales basicas. Hasta los ninos parecen reconocer instintivamente esta ley superior cuando se les instruye sobre lo que esta bien y lo que esta mal. El hombre descubre en lo profundo de su conciencia esa ley que el no se ha impuesto a si mismo, pero que debe obedecer. La conciencia ha sido muy bien descrita como el nucleo mas secreto del ser humano y su sagrario. Como creaturas conscientes que somos, estamos orientados a aspirar al bien y evitar el mal. Pero debido a nuestra naturaleza quebrantada, misteriosamente nos atraen de igual manera las elecciones equivocadas y daninas. Es posible tambien que otras voces a nuestro alrededor nos induzcan a silenciar o acallar lo que nuestra conciencia nos dicta. Conforme avanzamos en edad puede suceder, inclusive, que logremos cierto grado de refinamiento y justifiquemos las elecciones personales que no son buenas, elecciones totalmente contrarias a la ley de nuestro propio ser. El sagrario interior de la conciencia es muy fragil y podemos facilmente transgredirlo, por lo que se requiere mucha atencion de nuestra parte si queremos permanecer fieles a el. Recuerdo el caso de una pareja que Padre Tad Pacholczyk - El Padre Tadeusz Pacholczyk hizo su doctorado en neurociencias en la Universidad de Yale y su trabajo post- doctoral en la Universidad de Harvard. Es Sacerdote para la Diocesis de Fall River, Massachusetts, y se desempefia como Director de Education en el Centro Nacional Catolico de Bioetica en Phila- delphia. The National Catholic Bioethics Center: www.ncbcenter.org Traduc- tion: Maria Elena Rodriguez habia estado vrviendo en union libre por muchos afios. Ninguno de los dos habia pensado seriamente en el matrimonio, pero un dia se dan cuenta de que ella esta embarazada. El joven, catolico, decidio hablar con el sacerdote. Los tres se reunieron una tarde, platicaron largamente y al final decidieron que el aborto no era una opcion. Hablaron tambien sobre la posibilidad de casarse en un futuro proximo. Mas tarde, ese mismo dia, los papas de la muchacha visitaron a la pareja. Eran unos padres flexibles y habian aceptado bien la situacion de que su hija viviera en union libre. Durante la cena la joven comento lo de su embarazo, y con esta revelacion las cosas cambiaron. Cuando terminaron de cenar la mama llevo a la hija aparte y le dijo: \"Mira, tienes todo un futuro por delante. No te conviene pasar el resto de tu vida con este muchacho. Querida, tienes que abortar\". A la mafiana siguiente, los dos jovenes regresaron a ver al sacerdote. El muchacho menciono la conversacion con la mama de la joven y dijo que estaban reconsiderando la opcion de abortar. \"Ya habiamos tornado una decision ayer\", dijo el sacerdote. \"^Y eso que importancia tiene?, -contesto el muchacho-, puedo decidir algo el dia de hoy y mafiana cambiar de opinion\". El sacerdote le respondio simplemente: \"Para cierto tipo de decisiones no se puede cambiar de opinion. Si te retractas de esa decision hoy manana ya no sabre quien eres...\". Esta respuesta desconcerto al muchacho, pero al reflexionar en ello mas tarde, comprendio que el sacerdote tenia razon. Cierto tipo de decisiones tocan hasta el mismo fondo de nuestro ser. Aceptar o rechazar la tentacion a actuar gravemente mal, como lo es el abortar, toca nuestro corazon mas profundamente que muchas otras elecciones NC Catholics 20 Januaiy/Febmary 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org La education catolica: Mision integral de la Iglesia diarias de menos peso. Al final, son nuestras decisiones morales las que determinan quienes somos y lo que llegamos a ser. Cuando nos comportarnos en contra de una conciencia recta estamos violando y desfigurando quienes somos y nos hacemos menos humanos. A eso se referia el sacerdote cuando le dijo al muchacho que ya no podria saber quien era. Otro caso real que recuerdo en relation a la suave voz de la conciencia es el de una madre de tres ninos que, al enterarse de que nuevamente esta embarazada, empieza a tener dudas y a pensar que no podra con la carga de otro hijo. Finalmente, cuando iba a su siguiente revision medica, decide abortar. El medico no estaba enterado de esos planes, por lo que initio con el ultrasonido de rutina para ver como iba progresando el embarazo. Los tres ninos, que tambien acompanaron a su mama al consultorio, estaban ocupados jugando en el piso. Cuando el doctor paso el escaner por el abdomen de la mama, el nino mas pequeno levanto la vista de los avioncitos de juguete para ver a la pantalla, y dijo: \"jMira mama, un bebe!\". Esa misma tarde, al salir de la consulta medica, ella ya estaba segura de que no podia terminar con aquella vida que crecia en su vientre. Muchas veces, es la mirada y el corazon de un nino lo que nos recuerda como es una conciencia pura y recta. Como adultos, formar la conciencia significa practicar la virtud eligiendo de manera repetitiva y terminante lo que es bueno, verdadero y moral. Esto trae orden a nuestra vida y genera paz en nuestro corazon. En ultima instancia, descubrimos como ser plenamente humanos solo en la medida en que seguimos fielmente la suave voz de una conciencia que se ha ido formando en la rectitud. En el mes de abril del afio pasado nuestro Santo Padre el Papa Benedicto XVI, durante su visita pastoral, se reunio con educadores catolicos, entre ellos el Dr. Michael Fedewa, Superintendente de Educacion y Formacion Catolica de la Diocesis. -La educacion forma parte de la mision integral de la Iglesia para proclamar la Buena Noticia y ademas toda institucion educativa catolica es un lugar para encontrar al Dios viviente quien revela en Jesucristo Su amor y su verdad -comento el Papa. La celebration del bautismo les recuerda a todos los padres que ellos son los maestros fundamentales de sus hijos en el camino a la fe, y debe considerarse como una vocation privilegiada. Los padres ademas buscan apoyo con esta gran responsabilidad como lo es la educacion en las parroquias y en las comu- nidades de fe, y es aqui donde los padres reciben el apoyo de la educacion catolica y de la formacion de fe que esta disponible en muchas maneras y niveles. Es por esta razon que les debemos expresar gratitud a nuestros padres por el ejemplo de sus vidas y a todos aquellos que los apoyaron en este gran compromiso de la educacion y de la formacion catolica. En este momento en particular en la vida de la diocesis, nuestras escuelas de Catedral y de Cardinal Gibbons celebran su centesimo aniver- sario impartiendo educacion catolica, permitie- ndonos la oportunidad de enfocamos en el don y en el papel de estas instituciones; pero ^Por que son tan especiales? Las escuelas catolicas no son meramente instituciones que ofrecen programas academicos de excelencia, tambien le brinda a los estudiantes un lugar donde pu- eden orar juntos a diarios, hablar de Jesus, estar rodeados de simbolos como el crucifijo u otros sfmbolos que les recuerde la presencia de Dios, escuchar la Buena Noticia, aprender las ense- nanzas de la iglesia catolica, aprender y rendirle reverencia a la Sagrada Liturgia y participar ante los ojos de la fe que nace por conviction que Jesucristo es la fuente de toda la verdad. Extendamos asi, nuestra mas sincera fe- licitation a todos los que forman parte de las escuelas catolicas de Catedral y de Cardinal Gibbons por todos estos aiios de labor y en la ocasiOn de su centesimo aniversario de edu- cation catolica en la Diocesis de Raleigh; tam- bien expresemos nuestro gran agradecimiento a todos los sacerdotes, religiosos, administradores, educadores y personal laico que con devotion han dado su tiempo en este gran ministerio. Tambien agradecemos a los padres y repre- sentantes que permiten que nuestras escuelas catolicas los ayuden en la educacion y for- macion de sus hijos. Estamos muy agradecidos por todos sus sacrificios. Ademas estamos muy agradecidos con nuestros parrocos y con todos los miembros de nuestras parroquias quienes brindan todos sus recursos para demostrar su gran apoyo por la educacion catolica. Los jovenes me preguntan a menudo \"iCual es la mejor parte de ser Obispo?\" y con frecuencia les respondo con alegria que la mejor parte de ser Obispo son las visitas que realizo a las escuelas catolicas. Siempre me siento muy inspirado por la fuerte identidad catolica que impregnan las instalaciones y me siento identificado por el gran compromiso de nuestros educadores catolicos. Es emocionante ver la gran facilidad que tienen estos jovenes para hablar de su amor por Jesucristo y el deseo de aprender mas de El. Estoy sorprendido de las incontables maneras que el amor por Dios se ve refle- jado en el servicio cristiano. Nuestros ninos y adultos realmente aman a sus escuelas catolicas y reconocen el valor que represen- tan para ellos y para la diocesis. jNo podria estar mas de acuerdo! Por esta razon, renue- vo mi compromiso por nuestras escuelas catolicas y mi juramento de brindarle esta oportunidad a cuanto estudiante sea posible. En las mismas palabras de nuestro Santo Pa- dre \"la educacion es parte integral de la mision de la Iglesia\" y todos los que conforman este gran ministerio sean renovados en esta gran la- bor. Por favor, unanse a mi en oration para que las escuelas catolicas continiien prosperando y sigan siendo el lugar donde nuestros estudiantes \"encuentren al Dios viviente quien revela en Jesucristo Su amor y Su verdad\" - Monsenor Michael F. Burbidge, Obispo de Raleigh Religious Education at the Movies? ►► At 9:30 on a Sunday morning, the parking lot outside Smithfield Cinemas is packed. A special preview showing of a new film? No. Students from St. Ann's Catholic Church in Clayton attend Sun- day Faith Formation classes here. St. Ann's religious education program serves students from pre-school to adults, but the parish doesn't have the facilities to house it. So classes were, until a year ago, held at Smith- field's Short Journey Center. \"We outgrew that space,\" says Blanche Ellison, Faith Formation Director at St. Ann, \"and with gas prices as high as they were, the travel was a burden to many of our families.\" When the dilemma surfaced at a parish council meeting, St. Ann parishioner John Shallcross stepped forward with a unique solution. Shallcross is owner of Smithfield Cinemas. He offered to open the facility from 9:15 a.m. to 1 0:30 a.m. on Sundays to accommodate the religious education classes. \"It really sets up well for the purpose,\" Shallcross says. \"There are 1 0 different auditoriums and convenient rest rooms.\" The adult group meets in the theater lobby. \"We meet the first three Sundays of each month,\" Ellison explains. \"On the fourth Sunday we have catechist formation at the church.\" Even without the novelty of its location, the program is impressive, covering every age level and educat- ing more than 500 students. \"I have amazing catechists and parent volunteers,\" Ellison says. \"It's thanks to their efforts and John's generosity that this is possible.\" Diocese Celebrates Our Lady of Guadalupe Feast Day On Dec. 1 2, Catholic churches throughout the Western Hemisphere celebrated the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. What began primarily as a religious feast day in Mexico is now celebrated in countries throughout Latin America and in the United States. In 1 945, Pope Pius XII proclaimed Our Lady of Guadalupe \"Queen of Mexico\" and \"Empress of the Americas,\" a position re-affirmed by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. In the Diocese of Raleigh, wind and rain failed to discour- age worshipers who gathered at more than 30 churches to celebrate the feast. At St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cary, the Hispanic community arrived at 4:30 a.m. for a procession and prayer, then filled the church to overflowing for Mass in Spanish celebrated by Father Michael Spurr, with the Rev. Monsignor Tim O'Connor concelebrating. A meal in the parish hall followed. The feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe commemorates the appearance of Mary to Juan Diego, a poor Mexican laborer, on Dec. 9, 1 531 . When Mary appeared, she identified herself as the Mother of the True God, Creator of all things, and asked Juan Diego to request the Bishop of Mexico to build a church on the site of the apparition. The Bishop at first hesitated, telling Juan Diego he would like to see a sign from the Virgin Mary. Three days later, she again appeared to Juan Diego, sending him to the top of the hill to gather an assortment of roses miraculously blooming in mid-De- cember. Juan Diego placed the flowers inside his tilma, a poor- quality cactus cloth, and went back to the Bishop. Standing before him, Juan Diego opened his gar- ment. As the roses fell to the floor, they revealed an image of the Holy Mother on the tilma. The Bishop was convinced, and built the first sanctuary in 1 533. The current Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe was built in Mexico City in 1 976. According to a Web site dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, an estimated 1 0 million people visit the site every year, making it the most popular Marian shrine in the world. Juan Diego was canonized a saint by Pope John Paul II in 2002, with his feast day celebrated Dec. 9.

NC Catholics 22 January/February 2009 | www.DioceseofRaleigh.org | www.NCCatholics.org Deaths of Three Diocesan Priests ►► Father Joseph J. Klaus, a retired priest of the Diocese of Raleigh, died Dec. 30, 2008. A native of New York, Father Klaus moved to North Carolina in order to do missionary work. He was or- dained in 1 954 by Bishop Vincent S. Waters. From 1955 until the late 1 970s, he served at various parishes in the Diocese, as well as ministering from the Di- ocesan motor and trailer chapels and serving as chaplain of St. Joseph of the Pines Hospital in Southern Pines. His last assignment, in 1 976, before retiring in 1 981 , was as pastor for the second time of St. Anne Church in Edenton. His funeral Mass was celebrated at St. Anne on Jan. 5 by the Most Reverend Michael F Burbidge, with Msgr. Gerald L Lewis as homilist. Father Klaus was buried in St. Anne Catholic Church Cemetery. ►► Father William D. Kowal, a priest of the Diocese of Raleigh, died Dec. 21, 2008, in Philadel- phia, Pa. after a brief final illness. Father Kowal was born July 4, 1 949, and ordained a priest on Dec. 1 4, 1 979. He served the Diocese as associate pastor at St. Michael the Archangel Parish, Cary; St. Paul Parish, New Bern; and Holy Trinity/Our Lady of the Atonement (now Holy Spirit) Parish in Kinston. Father Kowal's funeral Mass was celebrated on Dec. 27 at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Newton Grove, with the Most Reverend Michael F. Burbidge as principal celebrant. Msgr. Jerry M. Sherba, who was pastor in Kinston when Father Kowal served there, recalled him as a man of faith, noting his tender care for the sick and his perseverance in hope. In the later years of his life, Msgr. Sherba noted, Father Kowal discovered a \"vocation within his vocation,\" the ministry of prayer, and spent the last years of his life praying daily and fervently for the Diocese and its faithful, and for his brother priests. Father Kowal was buried in the Priests' Section of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church Cemetery in Newton Grove. ►► Father Edward P. Mahoney, 76, a priest of the Diocese of Raleigh, died Jan. 8 in Durhama lr.^y^<Y^f A native of New York City, Edward M y M Mahoney came to North Carolina ^a^k jfi^^ta in 1 965 to accept a position as i ■k^gjn Assistant Professor of Philosophy \\ 0^ y ! at Duke University.

Burbidge presided at Solemn Vespers held Sunday, January 1 1 , to celebrate the bestowal of Papal Honors by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI on The Reverend Monsignor David D. Brockman, VG, and Miss Kathleen Walsh. The appointments were announced in November, with Mon- signor Brockman being elevated to the title of Prelate of Honor and Miss Walsh, director of Catholic Charities in the Diocese of Raleigh, receiving the Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. \"Monsignor\" is a title of distinction given by the Pope to certain priests in the Roman Catholic Church in recognition of the priest's service to the Church. Candidates are nominated for the honor by their Bishop for consideration by the Holy Father. Everyone who holds the title of monsignor is a part of the \"papal family\" and is allowed to attend Cappella Pontificia, the time when the Holy Father celebrates Solemn Mass. They are also allowed to participate. The Holy Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice is the highest award of the Roman Catholic Church bestowed by the Holy Father to the Laity. The English translation is \"For Church and the Pope,\" and is also known as the \"Cross of Honor.\" Established in 1 888 by Leo XIII, it is currently given for distinguished service to the Church by lay people. The design of the medal is dictated by the Holy Father, who bestows the honor. The medal or lapel ribbon may be worn at any time by the bearer. \"We are so happy that our Holy Father and the Church have recognized what we know about Monsignor Brockman and Kathleen Walsh,\" Bishop Burbidge said. \"What lifts us up today is not their new titles or their medals, but rather the testimony of their lives, individuals faithful to their baptismal call and to the particular vocations the Lord has entrusted to them.\" ignited!

Vigil Mass celebrated by Bishop Michael F. Burbidge Bringing to light the truth of the teachings of the Catholic Church and igniting in our hearts a love for our Faith Hunger No More In a world that produces enough food to feed all people, hun- ger is truly a scandal. Yet it is pervasive, and it's not just the poor, the homeless, or society's castoffs whose bellies are empty. There are plenty of people working full time who are having trouble get- ting food on the table; plenty of kids on free school lunch programs who aren't eating between lunches; plenty of senior citizens in line by 9 am worried that the food might run out before they get to the pantry door; plenty of single moms working $6.55 an hour jobs and skipping meals themselves so their kids won't have to. On Feb. 27 - 28, the Franciscan Coalition for Justice and Peace, a ministry of the Catholic Community of St. Francis of Assisi in Raleigh, will assemble a cast of distinguished hunger activists to offer the community a deeper understanding of the root causes of hunger and what we, individually and collectively, can do to solve hunger at home and abroad. The aim of the conference is to address the current crisis in food security, which has become the lived reality of millions around the world. David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World and global leader in advocacy on behalf of the hungry, will headline the conference. In a recent address, Beckmann noted that there has been significant progress in fighting hunger and poverty, both at home and abroad, in recent years. \"But the current economic crisis, which affects us all, affects the poor and hungry most of all.\" Beckmann said. It is estimated that the number of hungry people in the world has grown by 75 million in the last few years. At the Raleigh conference, Beckmann will be flanked by distinguished hunger advocates facilitating six distinct workshops: The Global Hunger Crisis; Take Action on Local Hunger; Hunger Advocacy and Public Policy; Climate Change and Hunger; Stu- dent Activism; and The Human Face of Hunger - Documentary Perspectives. The conference, to be held at St. Francis of Assisi Parish (1 1401 Leesville Road, Raleigh, NC, 27613), will open on Friday night, Feb. 27, with an OxFam Hunger Banquet - an experiential component highlighting the disparity of access to food across the globe - followed by a special video presentation from documentary filmmaker Gerry Straub. Saturday will feature Beckmann's keynote address, followed by a prayer service led by the Most Reverend Michael F. Burbidge and a luncheon and special round table discussion with clergy leadership from all over North Carolina. There will be workshops in the afternoon. On both Friday and Saturday, the gathering will close with interfaith prayer services reflecting the resolve of our diverse faith communities to address this pressing issue.
