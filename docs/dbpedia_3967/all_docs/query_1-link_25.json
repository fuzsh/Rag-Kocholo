        "text": ". . . That recent studies indicate that when a child graduates from high school, he or she will have watched more than 15,000 hours of television, but have had only 11,000 hours of classroom education?\n\nThis is pretty disturbing when you consider that those twelve years are the formative years for acquiring core values and life skills. The shock is pretty mild, however, compared with the following finding: in that same twelve years of elementary and secondary education, there are only 624 Sundays (or weekdays) for religious education/Faith formation. That does not equate to 624 hours of religious education, because most classes are not a full hour; and what child goes to Faith Formation every week for twelve straight years? Irregular attendance (low priority?), sports, vacations, and other reasons probably reduce that total to 300 hours or less! So, most children are, therefore, being educated by: 15,000+ hours of television; 11,000 hours of classroom education, and 300 hours of religious education. There has been a steady erosion of actual formation in the Catholic Faith over the past 40 years, and the result. . .? Cursory viewing - even commercials - reveal how “dark” television has become; much of it openly satanic and dismissive of any kind of morality. It is the FAMILY that has primary responsibility for the spiritual formation of its own members, and life-long intentional learning of the Faith! Your home is identified in Catholic teaching as a “domestic church” – the most important place for prayer, learning, and practicing discipleship at all ages. It is absolutely vital that families take responsibility for the education, value formation, and life skills training of their children – in active cooperation with the schools and the Faith Formation programs of the Parish. One of the sacred promises that was made by parents and godparents when the child was baptized, is that we would make their spiritual formation a priority and use all available resources, including our own spirituality and commitment to life-long learning, AND faith formation programs provided by the Parish, to help them to grow and mature in the Catholic Faith. It is a sacred promise.\n\nPlease register your children for our Faith Formation Classes – at the Parish Office – AND become a committed “religious educator” for your own children in your own home. Volunteers are needed and welcome to help staff our very robust Religious Education Programs! Our Director of Religious Education, Genevieve Rivera, and Deacon Bill Polakowski have many resources to share with you! We have an outstanding Parish Library with books, CDs, and other resources available to our families, as well as Parish subscription to FORMED (see bulletin!), so that working together we can “grow” strong Catholic Youth in strong Catholic families!\n\nMake Faith Formation a priority for yourself and for your family – it has eternal consequences!\n\nThis week’s Question: “What is an altar stone?”\n\nThe Answer to Last Week’s Question: “What are the ‘Tears of Saint Lawrence’?” On August 10, 258, the deacon Lawrence was martyred by being bound to a gridiron and burned to death. It so happens that on the three nights following Lawrence’s Feast Day each year, the early morning sky is streaked with one the most spectacular meteorite showers of the year. Such celestial events were never without a deeper meaning to our ancestors in the Faith. In the Middle Ages, these “falling stars” were called “the Tears of St. Lawrence,” shed from Heaven for the cruelty of humanity.\n\n(If you would like to be as smart as the “Quiz Master” – pick up a copy of the Catholic Source Book – available in the Parish Office, for only $25.00!)"
