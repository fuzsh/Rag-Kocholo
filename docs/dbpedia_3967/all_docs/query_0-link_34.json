LONDON : BBADBUEY & EVANS, 11, BOUVEEIE STEEET. 1856. [The Author reserves to himself the right of translation.] LONDON : BLIADBURY AND EVANS, PRINTERS, W HIT KFRIARS. PREFACE. It was my first intention to publish a second edition of a work which I gave to the public six-and-thirty years ago, but, on mature consideration, I have come to the conclusion that a subject so multifarious as a general description of the Indian and Philippine Archipelagos would be most conveniently and compendiously treated by an alphabetic ^ arrangement. The result is the present work ; the fruit of seven years' additional local experience of India, and of a study of the subject con- ^ tinued with little interruption from the publication of the History of the Indian Archipelago, in 1820. Some of the articles are meagre from want ^ of materials, and others, without doubt, imperfect and unsatisfactory ^ from defective knowledge or skill in the writer ; but, upon the whole, the book will probably be found the most comprehensive and accessible which ^ has yet been published on the extensive region of which it treats, while it *| will, at all events, lay the foundation for a more perfect superstructure by those who may follow the Author in the same direction. o ! f < A DESCRIPTIVE DICTIONARY, ETC. ETC. ABACA ABAlTO-ABANGr ABACA. This is the Musa textilis of Botanists, a species of banana, a native of the Philippine and of some of the more northerly of the Molucca Islands. On account of its filaments it is extensively cultivated in the first of these, particularly in the provinces of Camarines, and Albay in the great island of Luzon, and in several of the Bisaya Islands, or range lying south and east of it. The name abaca belongs to the Tagala and Bisaya tongues, but is not the generic name of the banana in either of them. By the Spaniards of the Philippines the plant is known under the name of arbol de canamo, or the hemp tree, from which, no doubt, is derived our own commercial one for the filament \" Manilla hemp.\" The abaca, like other bananas, is propagated easily by the suckers which spring up at the roots of the old plant when it dies. A measure of 5000 square yards of land will grow 1000 abaca plants. It grows to the height of 13 or 14 feet exclusive of the leaves. The fruit is small, of a disagreeable taste, and not edible. When it is about to form, the plant is cut down, and the stem being cut open longitudinally, is found to contain a great quantity of filaments of various thickness, and usually a couple of yards in length. These are extracted, hackled after the manner of flax, and then sorted. Some of the finest are as slender as a hair of the head, and these are reserved for the manufacture of cloth, while the coarser are appropriated for cordage, from the smallest rope to a ship's cable. In the husbandry of the Philippines, the abaca is of more importance than cotton. \"When or how its culture came to be first introduced is not known. In his enumeration of the plants of the Philippines on their first discovery in 1521, Pigafetta does not include the abaca, although he mentions cotton and the esculent banana; but it is possible enough that so peculiar a production may have escaped his notice. Dampier, in his account of Mindano, where he resided for six months in 1686, not only mentions the textile banana, but gives an ample and accurate description of the mode of extracting the thread from the trunk. \" As the fruit of this tree,\" says he, \" is of great use for food, so is the body no less service- able to make clothes, but this I never knew till I came to this island. The ordinary people of Mindano do wear no other cloth.\" After this follows the account of the process of extracting the fibres, which is well worth perusal. The Dutch have of late years introduced the culture of the abaca into the northern or volcanic peninsula of Celebes, where it seems to be indigenous, and with a fair prospect of success. There is a large exportation of abaca in the forms of raw hemp and cloth, but especially of cordage, from Manilla. ABANGr. Pulo-abang, the name of two islets of the vast group, of various sizes, extending from the coast of the Malay peninsula to that of Sumatra at the eastern entrance of the Straits of Malacca. They lie about 30 miles to the north of the equator. ABANGr- ABANGr . The name of a mountain of Sumatra towards its western side, within the territory of Achin, and in north latitude 4° 20', computed to be 10,200 feet high above the level of the sea. — The word abang signifies \" elder brother,\" but also from the Javanese \"red.\" B ABRA 2 ACHIN ABRA ; or, at full length, Centro del Abra, one of the thirty-four provinces into which the government of the Philippines is divided, and one of the twenty of these contained in the main island of Luson. The name is taken from the river which runs through it. It extends between north latitude 16° 6' and 17° 50', and is divided from the neighbouring provinces by high ranges of mountains, to the north from Ilocos-norte ; to the east from Cagayan and Nueva Viscaya ; to the south from Pangasinan, and to the west from Ilocos-sur. The whole province is mountainous and rugged, a branch of the great Cordillera of Caraballos passing through the centre of it. It has, however, a few fertile valleys. In the mountains, metallic ores, gypsum, and coal are said to exist. Deep forests of tall trees cover most of the province, some of which yield strong and durable timber. Game abounds, the most remark- able of which are the buffalo, the hog, deer, and the common fowl. In 1849, the total population subject to the Spanish rule was 28,971, of which 42 only were Spanish, and 122 mestizo Chinese. Of these no more than 3763 were assessed to the poll-tax, which yielded only 37,633 reals of plate. The mountains of Abra are inhabited by the following wild and generally unconverted and unsubdued tribes — the Ibalaos, the Guimanes, the Busaos, the Igorrotes, and the Tinguianes. These are all distinct from each other in language and manners, and are supposed by some Spanish writers, although doubtless erroneously, to be various crosses of the brown and negro races. The first Catholic mission was established in Abra in 1698, twenty-eight years after the arrival of the Spaniards in Luzon, but it was not until 1720, or a century and a half after that event, that the conversion and subjugation of the inhabitants began in earnest ; and, as elsewhere in the Philippines, the merit of both works belongs chiefly to the priesthood. It was only in 1846 that Abra was erected into a distinct and independent province, previous to which it had formed a part of Ilocos-sur. ABRA. The river which gives name to the province just described. It has its source in the highest part of the western branch of the Cordillera of Caraballos, which terminates on the west coast in the promontory of Namagpacan. After passing through the province of Abra, it enters that of Ilocos-sur, receiving in its passage through both, several affluents. In the last-named province it divides into three branches, and thus disembogues on the western coast. In its course it irrigates much land, and is navigable for the light boats of the natives up to the elevated tracts. ACHIN. The name of an independent state, occupying a small part of the north- western end of Sumatra, being the nearest portion of the Archipelago to continental India and Western Asia. The native name is correctly Acheh, but this word, which means \" a wood-leech,\" does not, although naturalised, belong to any of the Malayan languages, but to the Telinga or Telugu of the Coromandel coast. The Portuguese, to whom the country was first known, corrupted the native term into Achem, and hence the Dutch Atsjin, and our own Achen, Acheen, and Achin, Europeans in- variably laying the accent on the last instead of the first syllable. The town of Achin, which, with the valley in which it is situated, is the chief seat of the Achinese population, lies in north latitude 5° 56', and east longitude 95° 26'. The boundaries of the state have oscillated with its power, but its nominal ones are Barus on the western coast, and Batubara on the eastern. Its real dominion is at present confined to the narrow valley just mentioned. When the most extensive, indeed, it never comprised more than a small portion of the great island in which it is situated. The valley of Achin is bounded by mountainous land ; and one mountain, called by Europeans \" Golden Mount,'' but by the natives Ya Murah (the generous or bountiful), rises to the height of 5000 feet, being visibJe at sea in clear weather at the distance of 92 miles. It bounds the valley to the north-east, its base reaching to within five or six miles of the town. The valley itself is narrow, and so low as to be partially inundated in the season of the rains. A small river runs through it, which falls into the sea by several mouths. The mountains are as usual in these latitudes covered with forests of tall trees, in which are found the usual wild animals of Sumatra. The roadstead of Achin, formed by the main land and several islands, is safe for shipping at all seasons, by changing their berths according to the winds. The town, now a poor place, is situated on both banks of the river, about two miles from the sea, and is accessible by the main branch for small native vessels. The Achinese are distinguished from the other Sumatrans by their taller persons and darker com- ACHIJST 3 ACHIN plexions, ascribed to a large intermixture with the natives of continental India. Although generally speaking the Malay language, their own is a peculiar tongue. The animals domesticated by them are the elepuant, the buffalo, the ox, and goat, with a few sheep brought from India, as their Sanscrit name, \" bin,\" implies. Their poultry are contined to the common fowl and duck. All the fruits common to the western Malayan countries are cultivated in abundance. That the soil, however, is not fertile, in so far as concerns the most important part of human food — corn — is sufficiently testified by the fact that it has at all times been an article of importation. The celebrated Dampier, who visited Achin in 1688, and whose account of it continues even now to be the most full and accurate we possess, observes that the Achinese had of late, encouraged by the example of the Indians, who in consequence of a great famine on the Coromandel coast had been largely imported as slaves, commenced the cultivation of rice, but that the consumption was chiefly furnished by importation. He quotes the prices of this grain as fluctuating between 12s. and 70s. a quarter, a range of prices affording sure evidence of a sterile soil and a rude agriculture and commerce. The population of Achin, confining this to the proper Achinese race, can only be guessed at. Mr. Logan, in his excellent account of Sumatra, makes the rate of popu- lation to the square mile no more than twenty, and estimating the area of the territory at 2260 miles, the whole population in round numbers not more than 45,200, which is probably its utmost amount. Achm being the nearest part of the Malayan Islands to the continent of Western- India, the distance from shore to shore at the narrowest point not exceeding 750 miles, and possessing a safe harbour, the probability is that it farmed for many ages one of the chief marts at which the maritime nations of Hindustan obtained pepper, fine spices, gold, tin, and other commodities, in exchange for their cotton fabrics and salt. Such a commerce existed on the first appearance of the Portuguese in the waters of the Archipelago, and still exists, although in greatly diminished amount. In their own annals the Achinese are stated to have been converted to the Mahommedan religion in the year of the Hegit a 601, corresponding to the year 1204 of our time, and this seems to have been the earliest conversion of any of the Malayan nations. There can be little doubt but that the Arabs and Persians with the Mahommedans of Hindustan who had been settled in that country for two centuries before this event, must have traded with the Achinese and other people of the Archipelago much earlier. On the arrival of the Portuguese, Achin was tributary to the conterminous Malay state of Pedir, and De Barros (decade 3, bk. v. c. 1), enumerates it only as one of the twenty -nine little kingdoms of the coast of Sumatra, exclusive of those of the interior of the island. Its rise to commercial importance is curious, and worth describing as an illustration of the manners and state of civilisa- tion of the Malayan race. The King of Pedir had appointed a favourite slave to the government of Achin, and in succession to him his son. The last was a man of talent and ambition, and the founder of the state as it existed in the 16th and 17th centuries. The slave's son assumed the title of Saleh Udin, the same which is familiar to us as Saladin in the history of the Crusades. His reign began in 1521, ten years subsequent to the conquest of Malacca by the Portuguese, and in the course of eighteen years he conquered Pedir and all the neighbouring states, and made Achin the chief emporium of the commerce of the western portion of the Archipelago, the country speedily attaining an amount of prosperity and power remarkable for so small a country and so rude a people. This seems to have lasted for at least a century and a half, but to have attained its greatest height in the reign of a prince w 7 ho took the name of Sekander muda, a title half-Arabic and half-Malay, which may be translated \" Alexander the Younger.\" This person ascended the throne in 1606, and after a reign of thirty -five years died in 1641, having in that year assisted the Dutch in the conquest of Malacca, against which he himself and his predecessors had fitted out many costly but fruitless expeditions. One of these, as described by Faria-y-Souza, may be quoted as an example of the resources of the state of Achin at the time. The fleet consisted of five hundred sail, a hundred of which were of greater size than any then constructed in Europe, and the warriors or mariners which it bore amounted to 60,000, commanded in person by the king. This great expe- dition, destined for the conquest of Malacca, was encountered and defeated by a Portuguese squadron, losing 50 vessels and 20,000 men in a combat which lasted from morning to midnight. But the Portuguese themselves were greatly disabled in this action with a native armament which a single stout steam sloop-of- war would, in our times, have more effectually defeated. B 2 ACHIN 4 ACHIN The Achinese prince in question was the correspondent of our King James the First, and his letter in reply to the peace-loving monarch's epistle is to be found in Purchas. Here is a sample: \"This great king sendeth this letter of salutation to James, King of Great Britain, viz. England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, to signify the great content he hath received from his Highness' letter, delivered by the hands of Arancaya puto, Thomas Best, his Majesty's embassadour, at the receipt whereof his eyes were surprised with a celestial brightness and his spirits ravished with a divine ray, — the opening whereof rendered a savour more fragrant than the most odoriferous flowers or sweetest perfumes in the world. For which cause I the great King of Sumatra do profess myself to be of one heart, of one mind, and of one flesh, with the most potent King James of England, and do earnestly desire the league begun may be continued to all posterity.\" The style of this letter shows that it was not Malay, and in fact, it was written in Arabic, as was the letter of King James to his brother of Achin. Capt. Best, the ambassador of King James, was honoured by the Achinese king with a title of nobility, viz. \" Orang-kaya-putih,\" which means \" white nobleman,\" and this is the title contained in the letter as Arancaya puto. In one of the narratives of Best's voyage and mission, the following description is given of the King of Achin in 1613 : \"The King of Achin is a proper gallant man of war re, of thirty-two years, of middle size, full of spirit, strong by sea and land, his country populous ; his elephants many, whereof we saw one hundred sixty, or one hun- dred eighty at a time. His gallies and frigates carry in them very good brasse ordnance, demi-cannon, culverine, sakar, minion, &c. &c. His building is stately and spacious, though not strong ; his court at Achen pleasant, having a goodly branch of the main river about and through his palace, which branch he cut and brought, six or eight miles off, in twenty days, while we continued at Achen. . . He (the king) desired the general (Captain Best) to commend him to the King of England, and to entreat him to send him two white women. For,\" said he, \" if I beget one of them with child, and it prove a sonne, I will make him King of Priaman, Passaman, and of the coast from whence you fetch your pepper; so that you shall not need to come any more to me, but to your own English king for these commodities.\" The pious and moral English monarch would hardly have approved of the project of bigamy contained in the last sentence of this extract, and more especially when coming from a confirmed tobacco-smoker, which the Indian prince was, even in this early period of the Asiatic history of the plant ; for the narrative tells us that \" hee all this while \" (during a festival of six hours' continuance) \" drinkes tobacco in a silver pipe, given by his women, which are in a close roome behind him.\" The English made their first appearance at Achin in 1602, with a squadron of four merchant-ships, under the command of Sir James Lancaster, who was furnished with a letter from Queen Elizabeth to the king. The reigning monarch had been a fisher- man, and by his talents and skill had raised himself to the command of the forces. On the demise of his sovereign and the accession to the throne of his grandson, he became his guardian, — put his ward to death, and ascended the vacant throne. The common enmity of the Queen of England and King of Achin to the Portuguese assured to Lancaster a most favourable reception. The Queen's letter is given, and is highly complimentary to her royal brother, the fisherman, while it is full of excellent sense. \" We for them \" (the East India Company) \" do promise, that in no time here- after you shall have cause to repent thereof, but rather to rejoice much, for their dealing shall be true, and their conversation sure, and we hope that they will give such good proofe thereof that this beginning shall be a perpetual confirmation of love betwixt our subjects on both parts, by carrying from us such things and merchandise, as you have need of there. So that your Highness shall be very well served, and better contented than you have heretofore been with the Portugals and Spaniards our enemies, who only and none else of these regions have frequented those your and the other kingdoms of the East ; not suffering that the other nations should do it, pretending themselves to be monarchs, and absolute lords of, all those kingdoms and provinces, as their own conquest and inheritance, as appeareth by their lofty titles in their writings. The contrary whereof hath very lately appeared unto us, and that your Highness and your royal family, fathers and grandfathers, have, by the grace of God and their valour, known, not only to defend your own kingdoms, but also to give war unto the Portugals in the lands which they possess, as namely, in Malacca, in the year of the human redemption 1575, under the conduct of your valiant captain, Ragamacota\" (Raja Makuta, two Sanscrit words, long naturalised in Malay, meaning \"prince' 1 and \"tiara\") \"with their great loss and the perpetual honour of your Highness' crown and kingdom. And now, if your Highness shall be pleased to accept into your ACEOT 5 ACHIN favour and grace, and under your royal protection and defence, those our subjects, that they may freely do their business now and continue yearly hereafter, this bearer who goeth chief of the fleet of four ships, hath order, with your Highness' license, to leave certain factors with a settled house of factory in your kingdom, until the going thither of another fleet which shall go thither on the return of this,- — which left factors shall learn the language and customs of your subjects, whereby the better and more lovingly to converse with them.\" A curious scene is enacted at the ambassador's audience of leave, which is thus related : \"And when the general took his leave, the king saith unto him, 'Have you the Psalms of David among youV The general answered, 'Yea, and we sing them daily.' 'Then,' said the king, 'I and the rest of these nobles about me will sing a psalm to God for your prosperity/ and so they did very solemnly. And after it was ended, the king said, 'I would have you sing another psalm, although in your own language.' So, there being in the company some twelve of us, we sang another psalm. And after the psalm ended, the general took his leave of the king, the king shewing him much kindness at his departure, desiring God to bless us in our journey, and to guide us safely into our own country, saying, that if hereafter your ships return to this port, you shall find as good usage as you have done.\" It is to be noticed that not only the intercourse of the English mission, but the correspondence of the two sovereigns, was carried on in the Arabic language by means of a Jew interpreter brought by Sir James Lancaster with him from England. Such was the first humble appearance of our nation in India, and such the condition of the kingdom of Achin in the first years of the seventeenth century. Two hundred and fifty years have wrought a wonderful change. The successor of Queen Elizabeth is mistress of India with its hundred and fifty millions of people, and the successors of the merchants for whom she besought protection are her delegates in its adminis- tration, while the reigning King of Achin is the son of a mestizo Arab, a subject of Queen Victoria, and called to the throne on account of the wealth acquired by his father under British protection in the small out-settlement, Penang. The rapid rise and fall of Achin deserve a few observations. Its territory was small, and its soil more sterile than fertile, so that it must have owed its prosperity almost wholly to commerce. Its published laws are liberal, but these, judging by the results, must also have been administered in a manner to insure a tolerable amount of security to life and property, and it seems certain that the Achinese government abstained from the common practice of Malayan states, that of monopolising in its own hands all foreign trade. The probability is, that the large number of Arabs and Indians settled among the Achinese contributed in some degree to liberalise their commercial policy. The whole foreign trade of the subdued neighbouring states came to centre in Achin, which must also have benefited largely by the violence of the Portuguese, which drove trade from Malacca. That the trade was large for the times, is at all events certain. In 1603, Sir James 'Lancaster informs us that he found in the roads from sixteen to eighteen ships of divers nations, some from Gujrat, some from Bengal, some from Calicut and other ports of Malabar, and some from Pegu and the eastern coast of the Malay peninsula. Eighty-five years later Dampier says, that the roads are \"seldom without ten or fifteen sail of ships of several nations,\" and that from ten to twelve Chinese junks came yearly to Achin. \" This town,\" says he, \"consists of 7000 or 8000 houses, and in it there are a great many merchant strangers, viz., English, Dutch, Danes, Portuguese, Chinese, Gusrats, &c. &c. The houses of this city are generally larger than those I saw at Mindano and better furnished with household goods. The city has no w r alls, nor so much as a ditch about it. It has a great number of mosques, generally square-built and covered with pantile, but neither high nor large. The queen has a large palace here, built hand- somely with stone, but I could not get into the inside of it.\" According to Dam pier's statement the town of Achin must have contained in 1688 forty-five or fifty thousand inhabitants, a number at least equal to the whole of the present population of the principality. Nearly all this has disappeared. No doubt the violence and injustice of the par- amount European governments, the Dutch and English, in their efforts to establish their respective monopolies, contributed largely to the decay of Achin; but the main cause has been the disorder and anarchy inherent in the government of an essentially barbarous people, whose fits of prosperity must be always inconstant and ephemeral. For a century and a half, the country was exhausted by wars and expeditions wholly disproportioned to the resources of so small a state. The extent of anarchy which prevailed is shown in a few words by the short duration of the reigns of its princes. ADANG 6 AGILA From the year 1621 to the present time no fewer than four-and- twenty princes have reigned, which gives an average duration for each reign of less than ten years. Of these, one half were either deposed or assassinated. Four of the Achinese sovereigns in succession, over a period of sixty years, were women, the puppets of an oligarchy of the nobles. ADANGr. A wild tribe of the island of Luzon, of the brown- complexioned race, with peculiar manners and a peculiar language, inhabiting the craggy recesses of the Cordillera of Caraballos, in about the latitude of 18° 30' north, and within the pro- vince of IlocoE-norte. The tribe is also known to the Spaniards under the different names of Adangino, Adane, Adanite, and Adangta. \"The blind love of all the Philippine islanders,\" say the authors of the Geographical Dictionary, \"for their savage independence, aided by the nature of the country in which the Adantas hold their miserable abode, has prevented religious zeal, the civiliser of the Philippines, from reaching them, and kept them long in their stupid ignorance, and physical and moral destitution.\" ADENARA. The name of one of the five small islands lying between Floris and Timur, and the nearest to the first of these. Its area is computed at 144 square geographical miles. AETA, and also ITA. This is the name by which the negro race of the Philip- pine Islands is most commonly known. They are a short, small, but well-made and active people, with the nose a little flattened, soft frizzled hair, a complexion less dark, and features more regular than those of the African negro. The Spanish expression is, \"less black and less ugly.\" From their diminutive stature, their average height not exceeding four feet eight inches, and resemblance to the Africans, the Spaniards call them negritos, or \" little negroes.\" The Aetas are described as being in the rudest state of social existence ; without other covering than a strip of bark to hide their nakedness; and without fixed dwellings, but wandering over the forest in quest of the wild roots, fruits, and game, on which they subsist. The bow is their only weapon, but they use it with much dexterity. With the brown-coin- plexioned race they live in a state of constant hostility. They are usually seen only in the sequestered recesses of the mountains, and have been found by the Spaniards far less amenable to civilisation than the wildest of the brown-complexioned race. According to the Spanish statements, the negritos are found only in the five islands of Luzon, Negros, Panay, Mindoro, and Miudano ; and in these, those subjected to the Spanish rule, or to some extent tamed, amount, for Luzon to 8309; for Negros to 3475 ; and for Panay to 4903, making the total number, in the three islands, 16,887 ; no account existing of those of Mindoro and Mindano. Throughout the whole Philippines, the total number of the negritos has been estimated not to exceed 25,000. No adequate specimens of the languages of the Philippine negroes has been published, but each tribe is supposed to have its own peculiar idiom, and ail of them to be different from, although in many cases mixed with, the languages of the brown-complexioned race. AGAR- AGAR. The Malay name for a species of marine alga, the Fucus sac- charinus of botanists ; growing on the rocky shores of many of the Malayan islands, and forming a considerable article of export to China by junks. It is esculent when boiled to a jelly, and is also used by the Chinese as a vegetable glue. AGILA, the Eagle- wood of commerce. Its name in Malay and Javanese is kalambak or kaiambah, but it is also known in these languages by that of gahru, or kayu-gahru, gahru-wood, a corruption of the Sanscrit Agharu. The perfumed wood thus named has been immemorially used as an incense throughout all the civilised countries of the East ; and at least from the first appearance of the Portu- guese in India, by the nations of Europe. In 1516, Barbosa (Ramusio, vol. i. p. 317) mentions it under the two names, of Aloe-wood and Agila; quoting the price of the first, which he characterises as \" fine black,\" at 1000 fanams the farasuola, and the last at 300 only. There can be no doubt but that the perfumed wood is the result of disease in the tree that yklds it, produced by the thickening of its sap into a gum or resin. In the mission to Siam and Cochin China in 1821 and 1822, I saw myself the wood in both states as it was freshly brought from the forest, and pre- paring for the market in the island of Kodud, on the coast of Camboja, between the latitudes of nine and ten degrees north. The tree yielding the genuine agila has not been ascertained by botanists, but it probably belongs to the natural order of Legumino^ae, in which it has been placed by the celebrated botanist Decandolle. AGNO-GRANDE 7 ALAS The perfumed wood is found in greatest perfection in the mountainous country to the east of the gulf of Siam, including Camboja and Cochin-China, between the 8th and 14th degrees of N. lat. It is found, however, although of inferior quality, as far north as Sylhet, in Bengal, and as far south as the Malay peninsula and Sumatra ; and in all this wide extent the tree, a tall forest one, is probably either the same or of the same natural family. Castanheda mentions its existence in Campar, on the eastern side of Sumatra, and opposite to Malacca. \" It (Campar),\" gays he, \" has nothing but forests which yield aloes-wood, called in India Calambuco (kalambak). The trees which produce it are large, and when they are old they are cut down and the aloes- wood taken from them, which is the heart of the tree, and the outer part is agila. Both these woods are of great price, but especially the Calambuco, which is rubbed in the hands, yielding an agreeable fragrance; the agila does so when burned.'* AGNO-GRANDE, one of the largest of the rivers of the island of Luzon. It has its source in the province of Abra, near its confines with that of Nueva Viseaya, and in the highest valley of the Cordillera of Caraballos, in lat. 16° 49', and long. 121° 50'. After receiving some twenty affluents, and pursuing a tortuous course through a mountainous country, it passes through the province of Pangasinan, and disembogues in the deep gulf of Lingayen, on the western coast. In its course the Agno-Grande expands into the formation of several lakes. The most remarkable of these is that of Ladiavin, in the district of San Carlos, which abounds in fish, especially in that called the dalag, a large article of trade in the Philippines. During the season of the rains, another lake of great extent is formed by the overflowing of the Agno-Grande at its confluence with three other streams in the low plain of Maugabol. When the water recedes, small lagoons remain, and in these also the fishery of the dalag is carried on ; while in other parts of the land which had been inundated grasses spring up, on which are fed many oxen for the market of Manilla. The banks of the Agno-Grande abound in useful timber, bamboos, and ratans, which are transported by it directly to the Spanish dock-yards. In the plain of Asingan the sands of the Agno-Grande are washed for gold, an employment which affords the natives occupation for several months of the year. The soapy juice of a tree called the gogo is used to precipitate the gold from the earth and clay, every hundred pounds' weight of which are said yield thirty grains weight of gold. AGUNG (GUNUNG); that is, in the Malay and Javanese languages, \" great or chief mountain.\" A mountain of the island of Bali, with an active volcano, reckoned by the Baron Melvil de Carnabee at 11,600 English feet above the level of the sea. — A mountain of the country of the Sundas, in Java, bears the same name, but seems hardly entitled to it, since it is but 7000 feet high, while some of those in its neighbourhood rise to 8000 and 9000 feet. AGUTAYA. A small island of the Philippines, in the Sea of Mindoro, foiming one of the group called the Cuyos, which belongs to the province of Calamianes. It lies in north latitude 11°, and east longitude 121° ; and is about 72 leagues distant from Manilla. It is about two leagues in length by one in breadth, with a rocky surface, of which very little is fit for cultivation. In 1849, the whole population was 2011. The inhabitants are remarkable for their industry, which chiefly consists in rearing the coco-nut, in fishing the tripang or holothurion, called in the Philippine lan- guages, balatd, for the Chinese market; in breeding oxen, and what is more remarkable, considering their climate, sheep. The different objects of their industry are exchanged by them in Manilla, and in the fertile island of Panay, for rice and other necessaries. ALABAT, an island lying in 7° north latitude, on the eastern coast of Luzon, within the deep bay of Lamon, and fronting the isthmus which divides the main body of that island from the peninsula of Camarines. It has an area of about eight square leagues, but on account of the barrenness of its soil, and the dangerous navi- gation of its coasts, it remains uninhabited. Spanish writers describe it as looking like a bit cut out of the main island. ALAS. Name of a village on the shore of the island of Sumbawa, fronting the island of Lomboc, and which gives name among European navigators to the Strait, that forms the safest passage for shipping, between the Indian Ocean and China Sea on one side, and the Pacific on the other. The name in Javanese, with the accent on the first syllable, means \" forest or wilderness,\" and alludes, no doubt, to the position of the village. ALBAY 8 ALBAY ALBAY, anciently called Ibalon, a province of Luzon, one of the twenty into which it is divided, and forming the south-eastern end of the island. To the south, it is divided from the island of Samar by the Straits of San Bernadino, and to the north by the province of Camarines Sur, the river TJgot being here the boundary. The portion of Albay on the main land of Luson extends in its greatest length 90 geographical miles from north to south, and in its greatest breadth from east to west 35 miles. Its area will be about 1265 geographical miles. But the province includes, besides, the considerable islands of Masbate and Ticao, with several smaller ones. The coast of the main land is broken, irregular, and of difficult approach. It is indented by three deep bays, those of Langonay and Albay on the eastern side, and that of Sorsogon on the western. The last forms the best harbour, and is the place where were, in former times, built and equipped the celebrated Acapulco galleons. Albay is generally a mountainous country, a portion of the great Cordillera which traverses Luzon, passing through it. Two of the mountains of this chain within its boundaries, Bulusan and Mayon or Albay, both active volcanoes, are of great eleva- tion, especially the last, which is visible far at sea and a landmark for mariners. The principal rivers are the Calaunan, which falls into the bay of Sorsogon ; the Langonay, which falls into the bay of the same name; and the Ugot already named. The mountains of Albay abound in building timber and fancy woods, ebony and sapan-wood. The most remarkable of the wild animals are the buffalo, the wild hog, several species of deer and monkeys, with the common fowl. The mountains are inhabited by the wild tribe called Igorrotes, a brown-complexioned people, and by the Aeta or negritos; but the civilised inhabitants, forming the bulk of the population, do not differ essentially from those of the rest of the island. Their language, called the Vicol, is peculiar. The province of Albay is eminently fertile in soil, and well watered. The inha- bitants are peaceable and industrious, but their industry has been too often disturbed by destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It produces rice, maiz, sesame, indigo, some cacao and coffee, the coco-nut palm, and the palm called by the natives the buri, the pith of which yields a sago, and the leaves a material for fine mats. It produces also some cotton and the abaca-yielding banana which is an important object of culture. The province is traversed by road3 which, although hilly, are passable for wheel-carriage. In 1735, the total population of the province of Albay was no more than 28,469 ; in 1799, it had increased to 80,203; and in 1810, to 118,533. But the volcanic eruption of Mount Mayon, or Albay, in 1814, having destroyed four out of its five towns, including the capital, it was found by a census taken in 1818, that the popula- tion had decreased to 92,065. Since that year it has sustained an extraordinary increase, for by the enumeration of 1849 it was found to amount to 219,740. This great increase, however, seems to have been produced chiefly by an exchange of territory with Camarines in 1846, by which it gained 41,369 inhabitants. In 1849, the number of marriages was 1046; of births. 4872; and of deaths, 2121. In 1847, the number of these, respectively, was 950, 6176, and 5621; the population of that year being 225,154. In 1850, the number of persons assessed to the poll-tax was 38,896, and the population being reckoned at 238,177, no fewer than one person in six was assessed. The total amount of poll-tax (tributo) in that year was 378,969 reals of plate, or 7958/. ; thus each contributor paid about 49 pence. ALBAY. Name of the chief town in the last province, latitude north 13° 24', and longitude east 124° 28'. Albay lies on the shore of the bay of the same name, on the left bank of a river also of the same name, and at the foot of the volcanic mountain of Mayon, and in a direction south-west of it. The old town was totally destroyed by a violent eruption of the mountain in 1814, and the present built at a short distance from it. Most of the houses are built of slight materials, but a few are of stone, as the government-house, the town-hall, the office of the wine and tobacco farms, and a church. It has a preparatory school, supported by funds furnished by the Commune. By a recent census, the total number of houses was found to be 3257, and the population 19,546. ALBAY. Name of a wide bay of the province above described, on its eastern coast. In its greatest extent from north to south it is three leagues and a half in breadth. To the north-east it is closed in by many islets, the largest of which are Datan, Bapurapu, and Pingan. In its centre there is very deep water, and towards the coasts rocks and shoals, but in some situations anchorage and shelter for vessels of small burden. ALBINO ALBINO. Persons born without the colouring matter of the skin, eyes, and hair, and thus far imperfect, are occasionally to be seen in every race and every nation and tribe of the Malayan and Philippine Archipelago, as they are of those of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. ALBOQUERQ,UE AFFONSO, or, as his name is more usually written, Alfonso Albuquerque, was the second son of Gonsalvo de Alboquerque, lord of Villaverde, and an illegitimate descendant of the royal family of Portugal. He was born in 1452. In 1503, only six years after the discovery of the passage to it by the Cape, he made his first voyage to India in the joint command of a fleet with his relative Francisco Alboquerque. Returning home in 1503, he was appointed to the command of a squadron bound for India, forming part of a fleet under the orders of Tristan da Cunha, who proceeding himself to India left Alboquerque to carry on a desultory and unprofitable warfare with the little Mahommedan states on the eastern coast of Africa, Tired by this kind of predatory war, he resolved on the conquest of the island of Ormus in the Persian Gulf, — took it, but was quickly driven out of it. In 1508, he acquired the government of India. In 1510, he attacked, and after a first unsuccessful attempt, succeeded in capturing Goa, which has ever since continued the capital of the Portuguese possessions in India. In 1511, he undertook and achieved the conquest of Malacca, the enterprise which connects his name with the present work. His last achievement was the conquest of Ormus, soon after which he fell sick, returned to India, when he found himself superseded, and died a few days after, in the 63rd year of his age. Alboquerque unquestionably possessed all the qualities of a great captain and conqueror, — intrepid courage, a strong will, ambition, enterprise, and an unscru- pulous conscience. His character seems much to have resembled that of Cortes, to whom he was in no respect inferior. His means, indeed, were better, but the enemy he had to deal with was far more civilised, and better armed than the Mexicans. Malacca was said to be defended by 30,000 men, having fire-arms and artillery, and the king in person led his forces. Alboquerque, at the head of his 800 Portuguese, and of 200 Indians of Malabar, armed only with swords and shields, stormed it in broad day, and although baffled in the first attack, took it in a second, after a desperate resistance. The Portuguese historians represent the capture of Malacca as his greatest achievement. \" Surely,\" says Castanheda, who had himself served in India, \"down to this day, since we began our Indian conquests, no enterprise has been undertaken so arduous, or in which so much artillery was brought against us.\" In the civil administration of the conquest thus bravely achieved, there is little evidence of wisdom, but much of violence, bigotry, and injustice. The only dis- coverable exception consists in the coining of money. With the exception of tin counters, for the small traffic of the market, the Malays had no coin, but, like the Burmese at present, estimated gold and silver by weight and assay. Alboquerque struck a gold and silver coinage, stamped with the arms of Portugal. He erected a fortress to secure his conquest, the materials of which were supplied by rifling the tombs of ancient kings. He built a church, which he dedicated to \" Our Lady of Annunciation,\" the chapel of which he ornamented with a carved cupola, taken from the same tombs, dragged to its new destination by the labour of elephants. There was in Malacca a wealthy Javanese, the chief, as is expressly stated, of 10,000 settlers of his countrymen. This person had assisted Alboquerque in the conquest, and was afterwards employed by him in civil office. Shortly before his departure for India, the conqeror caused this man, his son, his grandson, and his son-in-law, to be publicly executed. Their alleged crimes were peculation and extortion, but it is admitted that the execution was a mere measure of precaution against their wealth and influence. The wife of the chieftain offered a ransom amounting to 2800 pounds weight of gold for the life of her husband and children, engaging, at the same time, that they and their followers should quit Malacca and retire to Java. \"Alboquerque,\" says De Barros, \"replied that he was the minister of the justice of his king, Don Emanuel, who was not accustomed to sell justice for money, for justice was the most precious thing in the world;\" and the same writer adds, \"this was the first act of justice by our laws in the city, and the execution took place on the 27th day of December, 1511.\" The Mahommedan traders of Western Asia were the chief supports of the commerce of Malacca. But under the denomination of Moors, the Portuguese, under the auspices of Alboquerque, attacked and plundered their shipping, massacring their crews, in the same manner as they would have done ALFORAS 10 ALMAHERA those of the Moors of the Mediterranean. The only excuse for all this was the treachery of the king of Malacca towards a Portuguese squadron that had visited Malacca two years before his own attack. The result of tiie policy thus pursued was, that the Portuguese came quickly to be considered, as they well deserved to be, as mere corsairs, and the common enemy of all the trading nations of Asia. Malacca was blockaded, even during the stay of Alboquerque himself, and being a sterile territory, which was supplied with corn from Java, a frightful famine ensued, which carried off many of the garrison and thousands of the inhabitants. The conqueror, in short, seems to have laid the foundation of that policy which brought on the Portuguese the hostility of all the surrounding nations, — which led to many invasions during the 130 years of their rule, and finally contributed to its overthrow. It must, however, be admitted, that the state of society and manners in Europe in the 16th century was not such as to have admitted of any of its nations governing an Asiatic people with justice and moderation, which may be pleaded in extenuation of the conduct of Alboquerque and his countrymen. ALFORAS. This word, which has been variously corrupted, Alforias, Alfores, Alfours, Alforen, Arafuras, and Harafuras, and supposed to be the native name of a people inhabiting the interiors of the larger islands in the Molucca Sea, is not a native word at all, nor is it the generic name of any people whatsoever. It is a word of the Portuguese language, apparently derived from the Arabic article al, and the preposition fora, \" without.\" The Indian Portuguese applied it to all people beyond their own authority, or who were not subdued by them, and consequently to the wild races of the interior. It would seem to be equivalent to the \" Indios bravos \" of the Spaniards, as applied to the wild and unconquered tribes of America and the Philippines. ALLIGATOR, or CROCODILE ; in Malay buwaya, and in Javanese baya. This reptile is found in all the rivers of the Malay and Philippine Archipelagos, but the most ordinary species of it being equally of fresh and salt water, generally at the mouths of rivers, or in the sea in their neighbourhood. The Malays of the peninsula reckon three species of alligator, which they distinguish as the labu or \" gourd,\" the katak or \" frog,\" and the tambaga or \" copper \" alligator. The species found in Sumatra and Java is the same, — the Crocodilus biporcatus of naturalists. In the rivers of Borneo the same species exists, but in these there is also another, partaking of the character of the Biporcatus and the Gavial of the Ganges, formidable by its size and rapacity. The Crocodilus biporcatus is also found in the rivers of Celebes, and extends even to the Moluccas. No alligator, however, has been found in New Guinea, and it is certain this reptile does not exist in Australia. ALMAHERA, or GILOLO. The word Almahera is said to mean, in one of the local languages, \" mainland,\" referring to the great extent of the island of which it is the name, in comparison with the islets on its coast, constituting the true Moluccas. Gilolo, or, in the Dutch orthography, Djilolo, and correctly Jilolo, is the name of a bay, and, according to the early Portuguese writers, of a kingdom on the western side of the northern limb of the island. Almahera has, on a small scale, the same whimsical configuration as Celebes, consisting of four long peninsulas proceeding from a nucleus. The two largest of these run, one to the north, and one to the south ; and the two smaller, one to the north-east, and the other to the south-east. The equator passes through the island, and over its south peninsula. Its extreme northern point is in north latitude 2° 12', and its extreme southern is 50 miles across the equator. The area of Almahera has been computed at 5018 geographical square miles, so that it is less than one-tenth the size of Celebes, about half the size of Timur, and about equal in size to Ceram. Its surface is broken and mountainous, and several of its mountains and volcanoes often in a state of activity. The most remarkable of them is Kanore\", which rises to the height of 6500 English feet. The mountains are as usual covered with a tall forest, in which it is singular that the clove is not found, although a native of the small islands on its western coast, the true Moluccas. De Barros, who published his second decade, which contains his account of the Moluccas, 42 years after their discovery, expressly states this fact. The ascertained wild animals are hogs and deer; the latter so numerous that the natives kill them for jerked beef, which is their chief article of export. The native inhabitants are of the brown-complexioned race, speaking peculiar languages; but the coast is occupied by Malays, the original settlers having, most probably, been the Orang-lant, or Sea-Gipsies, whose wanderings extend, even at the present day, ovtr the whole Archipelago. The aborigines seem to be a rude but inoffensive people. ALUM 11 AMP A NAN De Couto, the Portuguese historian, says of them, that they were savages, without laws, and without kings or towns, dwelling in the forests. The low state of civilisation of the inhabitants of Almahera is probably to be attributed to the want of a sufficiency of water for perennial irrigation, and to the absence of the clove, which brought commerce and civilisation to the Molucca Islands on its coast. Through this civili- sation the princes of these mere islets have always been masters of Almahera, and at present the prince of Tidor is sovereign of the south-eastern limb, and the prince of Ternate of the rest of the island, both subject to the Dutch. Almahera has three great bays, formed by its peninsulas, all lying to the east, but no good harbours, which, however, are the less necessary in seas never troubled with storms. ALUM (in Malay and Javanese, tawas). This substance, the principal mordant employed by the dyers of the Archipelago, is not a product of the Eastern islands, but imported from China, and the origin of the native name, for such it seems to be, is unknown. AMBERGrRIS. This substance, supposed to be a product of the sperm whale, was probably not known to the inhabitants of the Archipelago as a perfume before they were made acquainted with it by the Arabs. This is inferred from its having no native name, and its being known only by its Arabic ones of Sahabiri and Ambar. It is stated to be cast up by the sea on the shores of some of the more easterly islands of the Archipelago, the only part frequented by the sperm whale. AMBLAU. Name of a small island in the Molucca Sea, lying between Boeroe and Amboyna, towards the southern coast of the former. It has an area of about 70 square geographical miles, and a population of 689 ; but its geological constitution and productions are not stated. South latitude 3° 15', east longitude 125° 15. AMBOYNA. This well-known island lies in the Molucca Sea, but is not one of the five islands strictly called the Moluccas, which are by four degrees further north. It is the largest of a group of five islands lying off the southern coast of the large island of Ceram, and towards its western end. Its native name is Ambun, said to be derived from that of its chief town, the island itself being called by its inhabitants Hitoe, or Hitu. Amboyna may be described as consisting of a main body and a narrow peninsula running parallel with it, the isthmus which joins them not exceeding a mile and a half in breadth. This peninsula is called Ley-timur, which is probably from the Malay lai-timur, meaning \" eastern sheet or leaf.\" Between the main body of the island and peninsula there runs a bay 14 miles in depth, divided into an outer and inner portion, both affording good shelter for shipping ; but the last, a good harbour, which cannot be used on account of the malaria proceeding from the marshes which surround it. The outer portion of the bay has such deep water as to afford no anchoring ground, except on a narrow bank which fronts the town, which is situated on the shore of the peninsula. The geological formation of Amboyna is plutonic, consisting of granite and serpentine; but there are a few calcareous hills of recent formation. The whole island is hilly, but none of its mountains rise to any considerable elevation. Most of the land is covered with forest, of which the trees differ generally from those of the western islands of the Archipelago. The only wild animals of considerable size are the hog and deer, — even the tribe of monkeys being absent, as they are in the other islands of the Molucca Sea. The proper native inhabitants are of the brown- complexioned race, short in stature but active. They appear, when first visited by Europeans, to have possessed a peculiar language, now superseded by Malay. The plants chiefly cultivated are the clove, maiz, yams, the usual fruits, and the sago-palm, which yields the main sustenance of the people. Rice, as an object of culture, is hardly known, and, indeed, from the hilly nature of the land and the uncertainty of the supply of water, the island is unsuited to, its production. The total population of Amboyna, as given in the Dutch returns, is 29,660. Of these 13,000 are computed to be in the town, a mixed population of strangers, while that of the country consists of the aboriginal inhabitants. The last have been converted to Christianity, and belong to the Dutch Lutheran church. They are regularly taught in public schools to read and write the Malay language in Roman characters, and are allowed to be the most moral, well- conducted, and peaceable people of the whole Archipelago. AMP AN AN. The name of a bay in the island of Loinboc, and on the strait which divides this island from Bali, one of the thoroughfares between the Indian and Pacific oceans. A village of the .saine .n^P^ feoij the shore of this bay in south latitude 8° 32' and east longitude 116 4 \"9Vana is tile principal place of trade in the AMUK 12 ANONA island. This village is distant from the chief town of Lomboc, called Mataram, three miles inland, by a good road, having throughout an avenue of Indian fig-trees. The wide bay of Ampanan is but an open roadstead, on the shore of which a heavy surge frequently rolls, cutting off all communication with shipping. Within it, however, and sixteen miles distant from the village, there is a land-locked harbour, called Labuhan-pring (Bamboo anchorage), where shipping can take shelter, but which, from the prevalence of malaria on its shore, arising from want of ventilation, cannot be used permanently. AMUK, The muck of the writers of Queen Anne's time, who introduced the word into our language. In Malay it means a furious and reckless onset, whether of many in battle, or of an individual in private. The word and the practice are not confined to the Malays, but extend to all the people and languages of the Archipelago that have attained a certain amount of civilisation. Running a-muck with private parties is often the result of a restless determination to exact revenge for some injury or insult; but it also results, not less frequently, from a monomania taking this particular form, and originating in disorders of the digestive organs. ANA ME AS. The name given by European mariners to a numerous cluster of islands in the China Sea in about the 3° of north latitude, and 130 miles from the eastern entrance of the Straits of Malacca. The name, which is unknown to the natives, may possibly be a corruption of the Malay numeral anamblas — sixteen ; but if this be so, the islands have not been correctly reckoned, for the natives estimate their number at no fewer than 50. The largest of them are, Jamajah, towards the western part of the group, said to be 30 miles in circumference, having an area of 56 square geographical miles ; and Siantan, towards its north-eastern, having two good harbours. These islands are mountainous, sterile, but covered with forest. Their own productions, or those of the sea and rocks which surround them, are sago-palms, agar- agar, coco-nuts, tripang, and fish, particularly the shark, which is killed for its fins, an article of trade for the Chinese market. These productions the natives convey in their own vessels, and dispose of in Singapore. The inhabitants are Malays of the class called Orang-lant, or \" Men of the Sea,\" and had at one time an evil reputation for piracy ; but since the establishment of Singapore they have become peaceful traders and fishermen. Nominally, at least, the Anambas islands are subject to the kings of J ehore. ANAL The Malay name for the termes, or white-ant. This destructive insect is found in every country of the Archipelago and Philippines, and being known by the same name in all their languages, a suspicion may arise that they have been disseminated by commerce and migration, especially when it is considered that the timber of ships is a favourite object of their depredation. A NAM. See Cochin- China. ANDMAN ISLANDS. These islands, situated in the midst of the Bay of Bengal, are no part of the Malayan Archipelago, and have no kind of affinity with it, except in being inhabited by a race of small squat negroes, bearing a likeness to those of the Malay peninsula. Their language, however, is not known to have any connection with that of the latter, nor does it contain a single word of Malay. ANJIEB. (Javanese, anar, new, or, to complete the sense, Desa afiar, that is, \" new village, or town.\") A small town, with a fortress, on the coast of Java, where the strait which divides it from Sumatra is at the narrowest. The town is in the country of the Sundas, and in the kingdom which was once Bantam. It is highly convenient for shipping to refresh at, from its lying on the main thoroughfare of the Archipelago. The anchorage, however, is a mere open road, much exposed during the westerly monsoon ; and therefore it is not a place of permanent trade, although the town furnishes abundant refreshments with wood and water. ANONA. This is the name applied in the Philippines to the Anona reticulata, or Custard apple, and which the Malays have abbreviated Nona. It is a plant of tropical America. The Anona squamosa, or sweet-sop of the West Indies, is called by the Malays, Srikaya, from the name of a kind of custard, and is probably a native plant. Both species are easily raised, but little esteemed. In the Philippines, however, there seems to be another species, called, in the languages of the country, Ate represented as a fruit of excellent flavour. ANTIMONY 13 ARCHIPELAGO ANTIMONY. This metal, until lately unknown to the natives of the East, as it was to Europeans until the fifteenth century, was found for the first time in Borneo, in 1823, on the north-western coast of that island. It exists in several places there, but mines of it have been worked only in Sarawak. The ore is, as usual, a sulphuret in a matrix of quartz, and at present furnishes the chief supply of Europe, being exported, from the emporium of Singapore, to the yearly amount of about 1500 tons. ANTIQUE. One of the three provinces into which the large and fertile island of Panay, one of the Philippines, is divided. It occupies the western portion of the island, and has a population of 84,570, of whom 15,343 are assessed to the poll-tax, contributing 153,420 reals of plate. ANTIQUE. Name of a town of the last-named province, and formerly its capital, having a population of 4219. It was founded in 1581, and has a church and a public school of primary instruction. AOR PULO. See Awae. APARRI. The name of a town and harbour in the island of Luzon and province of Cagayan, situated on the left bank of the river Aparri (the Tajo, or Philippine Tagus,) at its disemboguement into the sea at the northern end of the island. Latitude north, 18° 23' 15\", longitude 121° 33'. The town contains 1910 houses, all, with the exception of the public buildings, of frail native materials ; and the population amounts to 5990. The harbour is the only one at the northern end of the island, that portion of the Philippines in which tempests and hurricanes are most frequent. APAYO. Name of one of the wild tribes of Luzon, of the lank-haired race, inhabiting the mountains lying between the provinces of Cagayan and Ilocos. This tribe has made some progress in civilisation, for they have permanent dwellings of substantial houses, and cultivate roots and maiz. Their chief occupation seems to be the contraband trade in tobacco. APO. Name of a lake of great extent in the island of Mindano, the centre of which is represented to be in latitude 7° 47' north, and longitude 123° 52' east. It communicates with the lake of Nusingan, lying south-west of it, and discharging itself into the Lagune of Pauguil, a continuation of the Bay of Iligan. These lakes are in the territory of the Llanos, or Lanuns, and about the centre of the isthmus which divides Mindano into two quasi-peninsulas. ARABIA. This country has been familiarly known to the inhabitants of the Malayan islands for six centuries, the majority of them, embracing nearly all the civilised nations, having, within that time, adopted its religion and laws, and engrafted much of its language on their own. ARACHIS. The Arachis hypogsea, or ground pea, is known in the Malayan coun- tries under the several names of kachang-tanah, kachang-China, and kachang-Japun, meaning, ground, Chinese, and Japan pulse. The two last of these names would seem to imply, what is probable, that the plant is an exotic, and was introduced either from China or Japan, with both of which the inhabitants of the Archipelago had maintained a commercial intercourse before the arrival of Europeans in India. With the exception of the coco-palm, it is, of all the oil-yielding plants, the most extensively cultivated in the Archipelago. ARAYAT. The name of a volcanic mountain of the province of Pampanga, in the island of Luzon, with an extinct crater, and which rises solitary from an exten- sive plain. From its summit there issue seven different rapid torrents, one of which, about midway down, forms a lake, from which issues a fine cascade, the waters of which eventually fall into the \"little river\" of Pampanga. From the mountain there is a fine view of the town and bay of Manilla. ARAYAT. The name of a town on the southern side of the mountain just named, containing 1100 houses and 7765 inhabitants. The \"great river\" of Pampanga passes through it ; and within a quarter of an hour's walk of it is the spacious lake of Buracan, abounding in fish. The locality is considered by the Spaniards as one of the choicest of the Philippines. ARCHIPELAGO (ASIATIC). Comprehending under this name both the Malay and Philippine Archipelagos, the whole Archipelago extends from about the 20 th ARCHIPELAGO 14 ARCHIPELAGO degree of north to the 11th of south latitude, and from the 95th to the 150th of east longitude, thus embracing 31 degrees of latitude and 55 of longitude. The islets to the north of Luzon are its northern, Timur its southern, Sumatra its western, and New Guinea its eastern limit. It is bounded to the north by the China Sea, to the east and south by the Pacific, and to the west by the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. It forms by far the most extensive Archipelago in the world, for it contains three islands of the first magnitude, Borneo, Sumatra, and New Guinea; five if we include a peninsula of the second, Celebes, Luson, Java, Mindano, and the Malay Peninsula ; fourteen of the third, Banca, Sumbawa, Bouton, Floris, Timur, Ceram, Gilolo, Panay, Mindoro, Negros, Cebu, Leyte, Samar, and Palawan ; and ten of the fourth, Billiton, Bali, Lomboc, Sumba, Boeroe, Timur-laut, Taliabo, Bohol, and Masbate. Without reckoning other islands and islets, which some have computed at no fewer than six thousand, these thirty-two alone have an area of at least 700,000 square geographical miles, or above seven times the extent of Britain and Ireland ! Trie equator passes through nearly the centre of the Archipelago, thus leaving half of it in the northern and half in the southern hemisphere. By far the largest part of it lies within ten degrees of the equator, and this decides the character of the climate. The year throughout is one warm summer, the thermometer, at the level of the sea, varying from 80 a to 90°. The only distinction of seasons is into dry and wet, about two-thirds of the year belonging to the first and one-third to the last. The whole region is within the influence of the monsoons. To the north of the equator, the wind blows half the year to the north east, and the other half to the south- west ; while the monsoons of the southern hemisphere are the south-eastern and north-western. All those parts of the Archipelago which are within 10° of the equator are free from hurricanes, and they prevail in no part of it except the northern portion of the Philippine group. The geological formation of countries of such vast extent is, of course, very various. It may, however, be generally stated that a plutonic formation, consisting chiefly of granite, sienite, and porphyries, with a sedimentary one of sandstones and lime, characterise the countries north of the equator, and a volcanic, those to the south of it. The plutonic and sedimentary formations are found in the peninsula of Malacca, the greater part of Sumatra, all Borneo, the greater part of Celebes, and in all the smaller islands near them. A volcanic band, the most extensive in the world, runs west and east from about 100° to the 130° of east longitude; and then, taking a northerly direction, it reaches up to the 20° of north latitude. This embraces a part of Sumatra, the whole of Java, and the chain of islands east of it, as far as the islets lying west of Timur, — most of the islands in the Molucca Sea, a small part of Celebes, and much of the Philippines, from Mindanao to Luzon inclusive. The Archipelago may be described as eminently a mountainous region, the highest peaks existing in the volcanic band. In the volcanic portion of Sumatra, these rise to the height of 1 0,000 and 11,000 feet; while in the plutonic portion, they attain only from 5000 to 6000, or, in a few instances, to between 10,000 and 11,000. In Java, they range from 8000 to 12000 feet high, and in Lomboc there is one which reaches to 12,500. The highest mountain of the Malay peninsula reaches only to 4320 feet; of the plutonic portion of Celebes, to 8000, and of Timur, 6000. Borneo, alone, has one plutonic mountain which attains the height of 11,000 feet, the rest not exceeding 6000. The volcanos of the Archipelago, in more or less activity, exclusive of mountains with extinct craters, are very numerous. Sumatra has five; Java, fifteen ; Bali, Lomboc and Sumbawa, seven ; the islands of the Molucca Sea probably not fewer than ten ; Luzon, eight ; and Mindanao, at least two. The useful minerals of the Archipelago, so far as they have been ascertained and used, are gold, iron, tin, antimony, coal, sulphur, and the diamond. Gold exists in the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, Mindano, and Luzon. Iron ore, in sufficient abundance for use, does not exist in any part of the volcanic band ; but in all the secondary formations, and, perhaps, most abundantly in Borneo. Tin is found in the Malay peninsula and several of the adjacent islands, extending from the 13° of north to, at least, the 3° of south latitude, constituting by far the most extensive known formation of this metal. Ores of antimony have been discovered on the north- western coast of Borneo in two situations, and are worked to advantage in one. Fossil coal has been found in many situations, as in parts of Sumatra, the Malayan peninsula and its islands, in Java, and Luzon, but, as far as known, in the greatest abundance and of the best quality in Borneo, where fields have been found and worked on the north and south coasts, which very probably extend across the island. Sulphur is found about the craters of all the volcanos ; but is said to be most abundant in ARCHIPELAGO 15 ARCHIPELAGO those of Mindano, and Leyte in the Philippines. The diamond appears to be confined to the western and south-western sides of Borneo. In fertility of soil, it should be added, that the volcanic formation far excels the plutonic and sedimentary formations. Within it are to be fouud the majority of the population, and the people most advanced in civilisation, of which the most remark- able examples are the volcanic portion of Sumatra, Java, and the two islands immediately to the east of the latter, with the larger islands of the Philippine group. To elicit this fertility, nothing is wanting but an abundant perennial supply of water, and it is thus furnished in the islands now quoted. As to the vegetable kingdom, as a general rule, the land from the sea-shore to the mountain- tops, is covered with an ever-verdant primeval forest of tall trees ; naked rocks, brush-wood, grassy savannahs, and cultivated plains being, in most of the islands, the exceptions. The vegetation is of great variety, varying not only with the elevation of the land, but being often different even in islands in the same parallels. Thus the teak tree (Tectona grandis) is confined to some districts of Java, Sumbawa, and Mindano. The clove and nutmeg are confined to a few islands in the Molucca Sea ; while the durian {Durio zibethinus) and mangostin, the most prized fruits of the western portion of the Archipelago, do not exist in the Moluccas, nor in any of the Philippines, except Mindano, the most southerly of them. The zoology of the Archipelago is still more restricted to localities than its botany. The royal tiger is confined to the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, and Java. The only feline animal of considerable size in Borneo is a small leopard (Felix macrocelis). In Celebes, there is no feline animal at all, as far as it has been explored. In the Molucca Islands, feline animals are equally wanting ; and in the whole range of the Philippine group there is but one carnivorous animal, the musang of the Malays, or Paradoxurus musanga of naturalists, a large weazel, a fact which goes far to account for the extent to which the ox, the buffalo, the horse, and goat — all imported, — have multiplied and run wild. Of the canine family, there is but a single representative throughout the Archipelago, and it is confined to Sumatra and Java; the hyena, the wolf, jackal, fox, and common dog, having no existence ; the latter in the domestic state excepted. The elephant and tapir are confined to Sumatra and the Malay peninsula. Elephants, indeed, are found in a remote nook of Borneo ; but, most probably, the wild descendants of those kept by the princes of Brunai, who are ascertained to have done so, when the island was first visited by Europeans. The rhinoceros exists only in the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, and Java. In Sumatra there are two species of it ; and in Java, one, which is distinct from those of Sumatra. A wild ox (Bos sondaicus) exists in Java, Borneo, and the Malay peninsula ; but not in Sumatra or any other island of the Archipelago. In the peninsula, however, there is another species, which has not yet been described. Sumatra is the only island of the Archipelago that has an antelope (the Antilope Suma- trensis), or wild goat of the Malays. In Celebes, and there only, there is a quadruped par- taking of the characters of the ox and antelope, the Antilope dipressicomis of naturalists. There is but one bear in the Archipelago, an animal of small size, Ursus Malayanus, and it is confined to the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. The tribe of monkeys is numerous and various in the western islands of the Archipelago ; the species, however, frequently differing in the different islands, but they are wholly absent in the islands of the Molucca Sea, while they appear again in the Philippines. The wild hog alone is widely diffused throughout the Archipelago, from Sumatra to the Philippines inclusive. But even in this case, the species will probably be fouud to be different. There are two distinct species of the family in Java, one in Sumatra, and one in Borneo; and in Celebes and some of the islands of the Molucca Sea, besides one resembling the common hog, that singular animal the Babirusa, which in Malay signifies literally \"hog-deer.\" Marsupial quadrupeds, unknown in the western islands of the Archipelago and in the Philippines, are first time seen in Celebes, and from thence exist in several islands as far as New Guinea, in which there is an opossum and a tree-kangaroo. Birds, with the exception of those that are migratory, are nearly as limited in their geographical distribution as quadrupeds. Thus, for example, the birds of Java and of Sumatra, parted by a strait not exceeding fifteen miles broad, and with islands like stepping-stones in the channel, differ with few exceptions, and even when the species are the same, it is found that those of Sumatra have more brilliant plumage and are of greater size. This is the conclusion of Temminck, the greatest living ornithologist. Peacocks are only found in the Archipelago, in the Peninsula, Sumatra, and Java ; but in the two first, besides the one common to them with Java, which itself differs from the Indian species domesticated in Europe, there exists a small and beautiful double- 16 spurred one. The Gallus Bangkiva, the supposed original of our common poultry, is alone widely disseminated, being found in all the considerable islands, including those of the Philippine group. Java however has, besides this, a second species con- fined to itself, the Gallus furcatu3. The Cassowary, the suwari of the Malays, exists only, as far as known, in the island of Ceram, in the Molucca Sea. The birds of Celebes differ almost wholly from those of the great islands to the west of it. In Borneo first occur the Megapodes, or birds that, like reptiles, leave their eggs to be hatched by the heat of fermentation and the sun. They occur again in the Mindoro, one of the Philippines, and in New Guinea. The family of parrots, of a great many species, are spread over the whole of the Indian islands, from Sumatra to the Philippines and New Guinea, but the species often differ even in contiguous islands. In those of Celebes, for example, the predominant colour of the parrots (in Malay, nuri or loory) is green, but in the adjacent islands of the Molucca Sea it is a bright red or a crimson. The cockatoos exist only in New Guinea and the islets on its coast. The birds of paradise (manuk-dewata, birds of the gods) are confined to the same locality. Of the familiar birds of Europe and continental India, the only one usually met with, and it pervades the whole of the islands, is the common carrion crow. The house-sparrow, which is abundant in Siam, down to the thirteenth degree of north latitude, is found in the islands only in a few spots, introduced by Europeans. The seas of the Indian and Philippine islands, and their rivers and lakes, abound in fish and reptiles. Among the most remarkable of these are several species of alligator, several of tortoises, land and sea, including the esculent and that which yields the tortoise-shell; the pearl, and mother-of-pearl oyster; the tripang, or hulothurion, and several species of sharks, the fins of which are an object of trade. The ordinary esculent fish are numerous, the species often differing on the coasts of the different islands. Thus of 108 species found in the Sea of Celebes and described, (probably not more than one-eighth of those that exist,) 64 only are found on the coast of Java. In the markets of Celebes, it is said that not fewer than 300 different species are, at one time or another, offered for sale. A few of them are of excellent quality, equalling, if not surpassing, in delicacy and flavour those of the European seas. Some frequent the rivers in the spawning season like salmon ; and other sea-fish are multiplied in stews, a practice carried to a large extent in Java. The curing of ordinary fish and the pickling of prawns forms a considerable business on all the coasts, and cured fish is a considerable branch of trade between the coast and interior. The only sea mammal known west of Celebes is the Dugong, or Lamentine of naturalists, the first of these names being a corruption of the Malay Duyong. The spermaceti whale frequents only the southern portion of the Molucca Sea, where it is pursued by the Anglo-Saxon fishermen. The inhabitants of Solor, a volcanic island east of Floris, are the only people of the Archipelago that fish the whale. To the Malays and Javanese the animal is unknown, except by its mythic name borrowed from the Sanscrit, gajah- mina, \" the elephant fish.\" The phoci or seals are unknown in the Archipelago. Two distinct races of man are the original inhabitants of the Indian islands ; a brown-complexioned, lank-haired people, the Malayan ; and a black frizzle-haired one, the Negro. The first of these constitutes the great bulk of the inhabitants of most of the islands, and it is only among the nations composing it that any respectable amount of civilisation has been attained. It constitutes the entire population of Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and Celebes, and of several of the considerable islands of the Philippine group. The Malayan race is of a short squat form, with high cheek-bones, large mouth, and flattened nose ; the hair of the head long, lank, and strong, and with very little beard. With the exception of New Guinea and some of the islands on its coast which are wholly peopled by them, the Negro race is found only in a few localities among the brown-complexioned. They occur first in the mountains of the Malay peninsula, and next in the Philippine group, being here confined to the mountains of Luzon, Panay, Negros, Mindoro, and Mindano. Under the common name of Negros, several different races of black men with frizzled hair seem to exist. The negros of the peninsula are a small race, under five feet high, and those of the Philippines are shorter and slenderer than the brown race of the same islands, while the negroes of New Guinea are an athletic people, at least equal in stature to the Malay race. All these negros agree in having dark complexions, frizzled hair growing in distinct tufts, but not woolly, in flat noses and much obliquity of fascial angle. At the same time they differ widely from the African, the Madagascar, and the Australian negros, the hair of the head although frizzled t not being woolly, the skin being less black, and the lower portion of the face less protuberant. There is, of course, no common native name by which all these negros are kaown. The Malays ARCHIPELAGO 17 ARCHIPELAGO call them Orang puwa-puwa, the last of these words, which Europeans have cor- rupted into Papua, being an adjective meaning \" frizzled,\" and the first \" man.\" The brown-complexioned people of the Philippines call them Aeta, or Ita, a term the origin of which is unknown. The Spaniards call those of the Philippines negritos, or little negros, from their diminutive size in comparison with the negros of Africa. This, however, could not be applied to the whole race, for it would exclude the most numerous section, the negros of New Guinea. Sometimes they have been called Austral negros, but neither will this designation answer, since they equally exist in the northern as the southern hemisphere. Papua negros would probably be the best designation, since it would include both themselves and the negros of the Pacific Islands, without including Africans or Australians. The two broad distinctions of the man of the Asiatic islands, is into a brown race with lank, and a black one with frizzled, hair ; but in reality it will probably be found that there are five distinct races, — the Malay, the Negro-Malay, the Papuan or New Guinea Negro, the Negrito or Little Negro of the Malay Peninsula, and the Negrito of the Philippines ; for there is really nothing to show that these different negros belong to one and the same family of man. Among the tribes of the Archipelago, some have attained a considerable amount of civilisation, one far more advanced than that of any nation of America on its dis- covery ; others remain still in a savage condition. The civilisation of the more advanced nations is shown by the domestication of animals applicable for labour and food ; by a knowledge of the precious and useful metals, and especially of malleable iron ; by the culture of corns, pulses, and palms ; by the growth of textile materials, with the arts of spinning, weaving, and colouring fabrics made from them ; by the invention of letters, and by the possession of forms of polity calculated to afford a certain degree of security to life and property. The nations who have made this advancement, although in a very unequal degree, are five of Sumatra, two of Java, two of Celebes, and ten of the Philippines. Of these, by far the most distinguished, and those who have exercised the greatest influence on the rest, are the Malay and Javanese. The condition of the less advanced tribes is very various. Some wander in the forests in quest of a precarious subsistence, without fixed habitations, as some of those of Borneo, Sumatra, Luzon, and Mindano ; others, as some of the tribes of the same islands, and the negros of New Guinea, have fixed habitations, have domesticated hogs and poultry for food, but no animals for labour, and grow roots and corn : others again have, by the assistance of trade, although possessing no domestic animals for labour, and no knowledge of the art of making malleable iron, or having invented letters, attained a higher degree of civilisation than the last. The condition of several of the inhabitants of the islands of the Molucca Sea, on their discovery by Europeans, is an example of this last state. The total population of the Malay and Philippine Islands may be reckoned at twenty millions, of which seventeen are in the islands within the volcanic band ; namely, in Sumatra, which may have 2,000,000 ; in Java, which has about 10,000,000; in the Philippines, which have 4,000,000 ; and in Bali and Lomboc, which may have between them about 1,000,000. This, of course, is but a rough estimate, for, with the exception of the European possessions, no census has ever been attempted. The story of a people who have no history, and who indeed, are incapable of writing history, can only be gleaned from the records of the strangers who have settled among them, or by an examination of their own languages. The strangers who have from time to time settled in the Indian islands, or held intercourse with them for trade, have consisted of Hindus, Arabians, Persians, Chinese, and Europeans, chiefly Portuguese, Spaniards, Dutch, and English. Of these, the largest influence on the manners of the native inhabitants was unquestionably exercised by the Hindus. Their intercourse in a direct form was probably confined to the two islands of Sumatra and Java, but chiefly to the last of these, where they built splendid temples, the ruins of which remain, — where they introduced their calendar, and one of their epochs, and into the language of which they infused a considerable amount of their sacred tongue, the Sanscrit, with some portion of their literature and legends, a small admixture of the Telugu, a living vernacular language of Southern India. When or how the first intercourse of the Hindus with the Malayan countries com- menced, is unknown ; for of historical records the Hindus are nearly as destitute as the Malayan nations themselves. The Hindu records of Java will not, with any certainty, carry us back further than the year 1117 of the era of Salivana, corresponding with the year of Christ 1195, not quite a century before the celebrated Venetian traveller, Marco Polo, was passing through the Archipelago in a fleet of c ARCHIPELAGO 18 ARCHIPELAGO Chinese junks, under the auspices of a grandson of Jengiz Khan. The Sanscrit names of many places in the Archipelago attest the influence and power of the Hindus, although it is probable that some of these were bestowed, not directly by themselves, but by those they converted — the Malays and Javanese. Such names are by far the most frequent in Java, where they are often borrowed from the Hindu legends. Here we find such names as Madura, the Madura or Mathura of India ; Ayugya, its Ayudya or Aude ; Indrakila, bolt of Indra ; Indramaya, illusion of Indra ; Talaga, the name of a place, a corruption of Taraga, a reservoir ; J anggala, the thicket, the name of an ancient kingdom ; Pranaraga, the desire of life, the name of a province ; Jayaraga, desire of victory ; Wirasaba, hall of heroes, also names of provinces ; and Sumeru, Arjuna, and Brama, the names of mountains. In Sumatra, we have Indrapura, the city of Indra ; and Indragiri, the mount of Indra ; in Bali Swetyanagara, the city of well-being ; and Sukawati, city abounding in pleasure : and in Borneo, Sukadana, parrot's gift ; Kuti (Coti), little fortress ; and Darmapati, king's bounty. Even as far as Celebes, we have an example in Andagili, which is evidently, although much mutilated through the imperfect pronunciation of the inhabitants of that island, Indragiri, or the mountain of Indra. See Hindu and Hindustan. On the arrival of Europeans in the Archipelago in the first years of the sixteenth century, they found the Malays and Javanese along with Arabs and other Asiatic nations, with their descendants who used the Malay language, conducting the whole of its internal commerce, and they seem to have been so engaged for ages. The extent of their trade and navigation is indicated by the names which they bestowed on the places they visited, even up to New Guinea and the Philippines, in which last Malay was spoken as the medium of communication with all strangers. The Malay words Tanjung, promontory, Ujung, point, Pulo, island, Sungai and Ayar, river, Batu, rock, Lant, sea, and Tanah, land, with the Javanese words Nusa, island, Sela, rock, and Kali, river, are of frequent occurrence throughout the Archipelago, usually prefixed to the names of places. These terms are found in parts of the Archipelago where Malay and Javanese are not vernacular, conjoined with other words of these languages, or with Sanscrit or local ones. Thus we have in the islands east of Java, and extending to New Guinea, such names of places as the following — Pulo-buru (Boeroe), hunting island ; Pulo-wayang, shadow island ; Pulo Timur (Timor), castor island ; Nusa-lant, sea island ; Nusa-kumba, elephant's trunk island ; Nusa-ringgit, puppet island ; Pulo arau (Aroes), cassuarina islands ; Pulo- ubi (Pulo obi), yam island; Pulo-lata, creeping island; Pulo-gaj a, elephant island ; Pulo-putar, turning island ; Nusa-manuk, bird island ; Batu-china (a name of Gilolo), mark or signal rock ; Ayar-aji, king's creek ; Tanah-bugis, land of the Bugis, Celebes ; Tanah-keke, land of sorcerers, name of a small island off the south-western peninsula of Celebes ; Tanah-puwa-puwa, land of frizzle-haired people, New Guinea ; Pulo pandan, Pandanus islets in the Philippine group ; Pangasinan, salt or saline plain, a province of Luzon ; Pulo-nila, indigo or blue island, in the Molucca Sea ; Kuta- waringin, in Borneo, fortress of the Indian fig tree ; Mas-sela, golden rock, in Sumatra; and the name of the island of Solor, lying immediately east of Floris, from the Javanese sulur, the sucker as of a fig-tree, which spontaneously strikes root, and figuratively a proxy or representative. The ancients, it may be safely averred, were nearly as ignorant of the existence of the Indian Islands as they were of the islands and continent of America, and the European nations of the middle ages knew almost as little of them. The extent of the knowledge of the latter may be judged from the fact that it was a moot question with them whether Sumatra or Ceylon was the Taprobane of the ancients, although the one was distant from the other by a navigation of 1000 miles. Even the names of the principal islands had never reached them down to the moment of actual dis- covery. They had a vague notion that there existed some far countries beyond India that produced spices, gold, and tin, but this was in reality the extent of their knowledge of the Archipelago. The Arabians of the middle ages had a far earlier and better acquaintance with it, although the written records be very imperfect. They had navigated its seas, traded with it, and settled on it many centuries before the arrival of Europeans. The earliest account we possess of their intercourse is contained in the travels of the two Arabian merchants of the ninth century. The manuscript of the earliest of these is dated in the year 851, and of the latest in 903. The first of these dates carries us back 440 years before the visit to the Archipelago of Marco Polo, and 7 68 years before the actual discovery by the Portuguese. The two Arabian travellers make no mention of any trade with the ARCHIPELAGO 19 ARCHIPELAGO Indian islands conducted by their countrymen ; but as they give very authentic accounts of the Arabian trade with China, they must, of necessity, have passed through them, and at least touched at them for wood and water. . The earliest of the two travellers indeed indicates, although very obscurely, that the usual route was through the Straits of Malacca, the countries on each side of which were, probably, at the time in a barbarous state, for the ancient Singapore and Malacca had not yet been founded. The Arabian commerce with China, at the time, was conducted with the Persian Gulf, the trades of Bagdad, Basra, and Oman centering at the island of Kis, and afterwards at Ormus on the Persian side, towards the entrance of the Gulf, owing to the difficult navigation of its upper portion. The trade was in fact carried on both by Persians and Arabs, and this fact will account for the number of Persian words intermixed with Arabic that are found in the Malay language. Of the settlement of the Arabs in the Archipelago, the earliest date we possess is that of the conversion of the Achinese to the Mahommedan religion, which is recorded to have happened in the year of the Hegira 601, corresponding with 1204 of Christ, or 353 years subsequent to the voyage of the earliest of the Mahommedan travellers. The progress of conversion through the rest of the Archipelago was gradual and slow. The Malays of Malacca were not converted until 1276, the inhabitants of the Moluccas not until 1465, the Javanese not until 1478, and the people of Celebes not until 1495, the year before Vasco de Gama passed the Cape of Good Hope, and only fourteen years before the discovery of the Archipelago by the Portuguese. With the exception of a few of the more southerly islands of the Philippine group, the inhabitants of the rest continued unconverted down to the arrival of the Spaniards in 1521. The Arabs, unlike the Hindus, have imposed no names on places within the Archipelago, for their work was that of mere trade and propagandism. It is certain, however, that Arabian intercourse gave a great impetus to the civilisation of the inhabi- tants, and that Mahommedan merchants, of Arabian, Persian, and Indian origin, carried on trade in the waters of the Archipelago long before the arrival of the Portuguese. The Spaniards and Portuguese, in fact, seem to have been indebted to them for their first rough knowledge of the geography of the Archipelago — a knowledge, indeed, which they could not have acquired so early as they are found to have done, nor have acquired from any other source, since the native inhabitants could not supply it. Some examples are worth quoting : Ludovico Barthema, a native of Bologna, who states that he was at Cairo on his way to the East in 1503, and who, at all events, visited Malacca before its conquest by the Portuguese, describes it as situated on the mainland of Asia. He mentions Sumatra by its name, as it is now written, and is probably the first European that did so. He calls it an island and gives it an exaggerated circumference, and he refers to the strait which divides it from the continent, but underrates its breadth. He also names Borneo by its correct name of Burnai. This island he had visited, and he describes it as being by 200 miles larger than Sumatra. He also mentions Java, in a passage worth transcribing, from the curious account it renders of Mahommedan navigation. \" Here \" (in Borneo), says he, \" my companion freighted a small vessel for a hundred ducats. Being pro- visioned we took our course towards the fine island (bella isola) of Giuva, where we arrived in five days, sailing southward. The master of the vessel carried a compass with magnet after our manner, and had a chart marked lengthwise and across with lines.\" — Ramusio, vol. i. Barbosa, the most accurate and intelligent of all the early Portuguese travellers, gives not only the names of many places in the Archipelago, but describes also their productions. His narrative is dated 1516, but his travels evidently refer to a period some years previous to the conquest of Malacca and discovery of the Moluccas. He describes Malacca, which he had seen, with fidelity, and he names all the spice islands with their productions. His account of Sumatra is even surprisingly accurate, while he shows the source from which he derived it. \" Having passed/' says he, \" the above-mentioned island (Navacar, Nicobar), there is a very great one called Sumatra, which is in circuit 700 leagues, equal to 2500 miles, as reckoned by the Moors vvho have sailed all round it. It runs north-west and south-east, and the equinoctial line passes through the middle of it.\" He mentions, moreover, several of the neigh- bouring countries, and nearly by the same names by which they are still known to Europeans, these names being unknown to the inhabitants themselves, although still employed by foreign Mahommedan nations. In this manner he gives us Pegu, Verma (Burma), Ternasseri (Tenasserim), Siam and China. — Ramusio, vol. i. Pigafetta, the companion of Magellan, seems to have given to several of the C 2 ARECA 20 ARJUNA Philippine Islands the names by which they are still known, although still unknown to the native inhabitants, such as, Loson (Luson), Sebu (Qebu), Maingdano (Min- dano), Solo (Sulu), Palaoan (Palawan). The surviving companions of Magellan were certainly the first Europeans that discovered Borneo, which Pigafetta writes correctly, Burne*. \" The island,\" says he, \" is so large that it takes three months to sail round it in a prau,\" which it certainly would, since half the voyage must of necessity be performed against the monsoon. He gives their correct names to the five Molucca Islands, and to Amboyna, Buru, Buton, and Banda ; and passing through the Archipelago in returning to Spain, he names Timur, Eude, Bali, Madura, and Java, and in the last of these islands names such places as Magepaher (Majapait), Dabadama (Damak), Cipara (Japara), Tuban, Cressi (Garsik), and Ciruba'ia (Surabaya). Pigafetta's knowledge of such of the Philippines as he had not visited, must have been obtained from the Mahommedan merchants whom he met at Cebu ; and he states himself that his acquaintance with the Malayan islands was derived from the Ma- hommedan pilot furnished to the squadron by the King of Tidor. From all the facts now stated, there can be no question but that the Mahommedan merchants and navigators of the Archipelago were the parties who furnished the European nations with their earliest knowledge of its geography and history. The Portuguese first entered the waters of the Archipelago in the year 1509, twelve years after the arrival of Vasco de Gama in Calicut, and must be looked upon as the real European discoverers of countries of which even the very names were unknown to the Europeans of antiquity or the middle ages. \" The country and land of Malacha,\" says Barbosa, writing seven years only after the event, \"was discovered by Lopez de Sequiera, a Portuguese gentleman.\" In 1511, the Portu- guese reached Sumatra, conquered Malacca, and at length, in 1512, found their way to the Moluccas, the chief object of the long search of themselves and the Spaniards, and, in fact, the bait that led to the discovery of the New World. The great group of the Philippines was discovered by Magellan in 1521 ; but their occupation and conquest were not commenced until 1565. Down to Magellan's discovery, they had been unknown even by name to the western world, although the Malays and Javanese seem for ages to have traded with them, and even communicated to them a considerable portion of their languages. It is remarkable that even the Portuguese, after ten years' possession of Malacca, scarcely suspected the existence of countries that are hardly now five days' voyage from that place, and still nearer to the Moluccas. The Dutch, just freed from the yoke of Spain, made their first appearance in the Archipelago, under Houtman, in 1596, eighty-five eventful years after its discovery by the Portuguese. The English did not appear in it until 1602, six years later than the Dutch. Of these four nations, which have all obtained possessions, although of very unequal extent, by far the greatest benefit has been conferred on the native inhabitants by the Spaniards, who have converted the greater number of those they subdued to Christianity, and advanced the people thus converted in civilisation far beyond what they found them. The dominion of the Portuguese has been nearly extinguished for above two centuries, and has left little valuable trace behind it. All the four nations, for three long centuries, acting on a false and rapacious commercial theory, in so far as that theory is concerned, may safely be said to have marred instead of promoting the industry and civilisation of the native inhabitants; and it is only within the present century that a wiser and more generous policy, not fully carried out by some of the parties even now, has been adopted. ARECA. The Areca catechu, a slender graceful palm, is an object of extensive culture in all tropical India, and grows freely in all the islands, from Sumatra to the Philippines, in which it seems to have as many distinct names as there are languages. Thus in Malay it is called Pinang, in Javanese Jambi, in Bali Banda, in Bugis Rapo, and in Tagala and Bisaya Bongo. Judging by this, the probability is that the tree is indigenous in each country. With a tolerably attentive culture, and in a suitable soil, it bears in about six years, and yields about a hundred nuts. Thus prolific and easily reared, the produce is cheap. Like tea, coffee, and tobacco, the areca would seem to stimulate the nervous system, and hence, probably, its general use. In the fresh or green state it is an object of general domestic con- sumption, and in the dry, of large exportation to China and India. The most productive countries in this articl"
