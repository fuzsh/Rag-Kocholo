        "text": "San Andrés de Teixido is a strong contender for the title of Spain’s weirdest village with its strange rituals and annual festival of the dead.\n\nThis tiny sanctuary is perched on the dramatic cliff tops of northern Galicia amidst stunning scenery and wild landscapes.\n\nIts cliffs are amongst the highest in Europe at 600 metres above sea level, resulting in spectacular views over the surrounding coastline.\n\nDriving to this remote village is a treat with a route that takes in hair-pin bends, stunning vistas and fabulous viewpoints.\n\nWild horses roam the landscape looking unapproachable and undomesticated, a rare sight in modern Europe.\n\nWhat a thrill to watch these shaggy and entirely natural creatures grazing freely a few hundred metres from your car or camper van.\n\nThe Land that Time Forgot\n\nSan Andrés de Teixido is like a small jewel encircled by a brilliant azure blue sea with an otherworldly quality.\n\nLegend says that San Andrés (St Andrew in English), one of the nine Apostles, was stranded by the nearby cliffs after his boat overturned and capsized.\n\nIn the myth the boat became a small island, later called Barca de San Andrés, whilst the drowning saint was saved by God.\n\nSan Andrés landed on shore and his presence led to the founding of a shrine and pilgrimage site on this craggy promontory.\n\nThat is the start of the surreal story of San Andrés de Teixido which becomes weirder as you learn more.\n\nWe visited the village on impulse as a result of an intriguing but random reference in a local tourist guide.\n\nFinding information about San Andrés on the internet proved tricky so we decided to discover more about this remote community under our own steam.\n\nWe arrived at midday and found the village almost deserted, a bit like ‘the land that time forgot’.\n\nA few rows of washing wavered in the coastal breeze whilst a group of cows wandered freely through the village, apparently on a lunchtime jaunt.\n\nA solitary visitor was sitting outside the local bar looking up at a cow teetering perilously on a steep grassy slope trying to reach some delicious greenery on the other side of the hedge.\n\nSeeing its head unexpectedly poking through a bush next to the main footpath gave me a bit of shock when the beast mooed loudly.\n\nAs we wandered through the deathly quiet village, it became clear that San Andrés de Teixido is a surreal place.\n\nThere is something so eerily quiet and unreal that it’s reminiscent of The Village in the TV cult classic, “The Prisoner”.\n\nHalf of me expected a giant, white bubble to come rumbling along the street to prevent me escaping back to the outside world.\n\nThere are also echoes of the classic film The Wicker Man in which Edward Woodward undergoes a strange experience on an isolated Scottish island which culminates in a Pagan burning ceremony.\n\nAs we ventured into the old multi-coloured church with its blocks of white and black stones, I anticipated a God-like presence reaching down to carry me off into hell – or if lucky – heaven!\n\nBut things were about to get even weirder…\n\nPagans, Saints and Sinners\n\nThere’s definitely something of a Pagan feel to San Andrés de Teixido, reflected in its rituals, customs and locally crafted artisan goods.\n\nAs we walked through its silent streets a few locals looked out from dark shops selling weird relics and carvings in odd shapes.\n\nWhat could all of this mean?\n\nPerhaps it’s down to the fact that Teixido was a place of worship in pre-Roman times and many of its early customs were related to Pagan cults.\n\nWhen Christianity later took hold, farmers and fishermen in Galicia started to make pilgrimages to San Andrés de Teixido, and this practice continues today.\n\nMany of the old Pagan customs went on to co-exist with the new Christian rituals in the village.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the village is a place of powerful spirituality – and conveys a strong sense of foreboding.\n\nIt is said that San Andrés de Teixido is where ‘The Door Beyond the Celtic World’ lies which perhaps accounts for the powerful pagan vibes which I was getting during my visit.\n\nWe also discovered that San Andrés is noted for its famous love herb, which is consumed after Mass as a prelude to a good old-fashioned orgy.\n\nSadly we were unable to secure the herb and I was too afraid to ask the locals who spoke not Spanish but Gallego, the language of Galicia.\n\nGallego is impenetrable to an outsider with its multiple ‘x’s and archaic language so there was no chance of making sense of anything that seemed strange in this place.\n\nReincarnation as a Toad\n\nSan Andrés (St Andrew in English) was supposed to have many powers including curing diseases, protecting cattle and crops.\n\nThere’s a brilliant old saying in the village – ‘If you don’t visit San Andrés de Teixido when you’re alive, you’ll go dead’ (or in Spanish – ‘A San Andres de Teixido vai de morto o que no foi de vivo’).\n\nBottom line, a visit to the village can save your soul and, best of all, you could be reincarnated as a lizard, snake, bird or toad.\n\nAs a result all animals in the village are never harmed. Woe betide anyone who accidentally steps on an insect or kills a humble wasp!\n\nI spent quite some time weighing up the advantages of being saved as a toad or bird – and opted to come back as a Peregrine Falcon.\n\nAt least falcons have very few predators, and they’re kings of the food chain.\n\nBut there was another mystery I hadn’t solved – what were the odd figurines on sale in the village shops?\n\nThey looked like a set of relics or ‘memento mori’ made from a strange substance which I couldn’t identify.\n\nIt wasn’t till I got home that I discovered they were “sanandreses”, figurines made from unfermented bread and painted in a variety of colours.\n\nThe women who make them are known locally as “saint carvers” who model the figures and bake them in the oven of a wood stove.\n\nOnce complete, they are sold to visitors of the sanctuary.\n\nThese figurines always feature one of the following – a group with a boat; a sardine; a hand; a dove; a ladder; San Andrés; the cross; the medal of love; the crown; the anchor and small altarpieces.\n\nI hadn’t appreciated their significance at the time.\n\nWhat a shame that I was too puzzled to buy one of the figurines, although in retrospect HM Customs might have been baffled if I’d been searched on the journey back to the UK!\n\nPilgrimage and Sanctuary\n\nThe sanctuary of San Andrés de Teixido has been a centre of pilgrimage since the 12th Century.\n\nThis was cemented with the construction of the parish church which began in the 16th Century, continuing into the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe village has changed very little since with the exception of four-wheel drive cars and TV aerials.\n\nWalking into the small chapel I was staggered to see a richly decorated altar which could have graced a much larger church in a big city.\n\nThe chapel dates from 1789 and was designed by Miguel Lopez de la Peña – and boasts an amazing amount of expensive decoration in silver and precious materials.\n\nAgain, it was strangely quiet inside like somebody had left open the door to another world.\n\nIt wasn’t long before we spotted more strange relics in a corner of the church in the form of wax figures featuring hands, feet, heads, bodies, pigs and cattle.\n\nApparently these offerings are supposed to represent the miraculous intervention of the Apostle in healing people and animals.\n\nOn the altar there were many different kinds of items offered up to the saint including symbolic objects with archaic connections.\n\nThere were also many heartbreaking items related to missing and dead people placed by their friends and relatives in the hope of some kind of divine intervention.\n\nLocal custom dictates that pilgrims drink three pints of water from a special well near the church to honour the saint.\n\nTo be sure that your wishes are granted, you have to throw a piece of bread into the water. If it floats it means that your wishes will come true, but if it sinks then you have to try again the next year.\n\nWe skipped this ritual but in retrospect perhaps it’s something we should have tried to check out. The promise of being reincarnated as a toad isn’t something you encounter every day.\n\nThe Pilgrim’s Journey\n\nIt’s easy to imagine how remote San Andrés de Teixido must have been to the early pilgrims. This village was so hard to reach that it became known as ” San Andrés at the end of the world”.\n\nDespite the building of a new road, San Andrés is still remote by today’s standards. It’s on the road to nowhere, a place surrounded by cliffs, hills and vertiginious drops.\n\nIn earlier centuries, the pilgrims placed stones or “amilladoiros” at different points on their arduous route.\n\nIt was believed that on Judgment Day the stones would speak and give testimony to the fulfillment of their pilgrimage.\n\nPresumably this would secure them the favour of the saint or at least a place in heaven rather than everlasting purgatory.\n\nTo prove their piety, they also wore a special habit comprising a long white shirt, sometimes fitted at the waist, on their pilgrimage.\n\nIt also had the bonus of protecting them from the baking sun and weather in this exposed landscape.\n\nFestival of the Dead\n\nAs we explored the village, we learned more about San Andrés’ strong connection with death. It seems like a dark angel is hovering over every aspect of the town’s life.\n\nThe dead are greatly revered in San Andrés, so much so that the village holds an annual festival on 8 September when the dearly departed are invited along.\n\nSadly we were four months too early for this strange ceremony although I’d love to come back to see the procession in its full glory.\n\nPilgrims who have had a brush with death in the last year are also carried to the church in coffins, which must be a sight to behold.\n\nThe villagers bake their colourful dough figures to be eaten before mass whilst amulets (or santera) to the saint are sold to those looking for a special place in San Andrés’ affections.\n\nAll this spooky stuff was quite unnerving especially as we seemed to be the only visitors in the village and hadn’t seen another tourist for over an hour.\n\nThere’s no doubt that San Andrés de Teixido is a fascinating place but next time I’ll come back at festival time when there’s safety in numbers.\n\nWhat an amazing place and a stunning location – a hidden treasure.\n\nMeanwhile I’m off to muse about my afterlife as a Peregrine Falcon flying high over the Galician hills without a care in the world…\n\nTammy’s Top Travel Tips – San Andres de Teixido\n\nSan Andrés de Teixido is located on the northern coast of Galicia in northern Spain about 30 minutes drive from the picturesque town of Cedeira.\n\nThe main annual festival of the saint in San Andrés de Teixido is held on 8 September.\n\nOther special dates to visit the village are San Andrés Friday, Saturday and Sunday of Pentecost; June 24; August 16; the third Friday, Saturday and Sunday of September; and between 27-30 November.\n\nTake time to drive the dramatic route between Cedeira and San Andrés de Teixido. The roads are well surfaced and suitable for a car or average-sized camper van/motorhome.\n\nStop off at one of several viewpoints and pull-ins en route to San Andrés. There are numerous local hiking trails for keen walkers. It’s an ideal place for those doing the Camino Santiago walking route who are looking for a diversion.\n\nThere are awesome views of the Garita de Herbeira cliffs along the corniche road to San Andrés.\n\nThe village has a bar plus a small number of shops, and limited accommodation on its outskirts. There is a parking area on the edge of the village, a short walk from the centre.\n\nWildlife abounds in this verdant landscape with birds including Peregrine Falcons and Eagles commanding the skies whilst amphibians are to be found in ponds and lagoons.\n\nThere are very few good websites with information about San Andrés de Teixido in English, but a half day trip is highly recommended, if you’re staying in the A Coruna area.\n\nWhy not combine your trip to San Andrés de Teixido with an excursion to the charming town of Cedeira down the road."
