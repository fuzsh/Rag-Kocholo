You will be receiving engaging videos to your phone and inbox that will answer questions about the faith. You can watch the videos on your own time. Opportunities will also be offered for you to participate in parish discussions, as together, we draw deeper into the faith.\n\nUse Flocknote to sign up. Simply text STAABKLYN to 84576 or online at standrewtheapostle12.flocknote.com. Follow the prompts to enter your email address and cell phone number.\n\nFlocknote is a communications tool that will allow all of us to connect better. There are no sign-up fees and your information stays with the parish. By adding your cellphone number, brief texts can be sent for a variety of reasons – praying for others, the ENGAGE videos, reminders, etc. You will also be able to alert the parish of any needs or happy events. Communicating can help us become a closer parish community who looks forward to seeing each other in person at the Sunday Mass celebrations.\n\nIf you already receive emails from the parish, you will automatically receive the “ENGAGE” emails through Flocknote.\n\nCare for Creation Ministry\n\n“Consider that God, your Benefactor, is present in all creatures and in yourself. If you look at every step of the visible creation, in all you will meet God.”\n\nSt. Ignatius Loyola\n\nSt. Andrew’s Care for Creation Ministry, along with other parishioners, has created a Laudato Si’ Action Plan for the parish, outlining actions that we can take over the next seven years to respond to the “cry of the earth” and the “cry of the poor.” Please join us! Contact Tom Hinchen at hinchenthomas@gmail.com.\n\nAll are welcome to join! More information…"
