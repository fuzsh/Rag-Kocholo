        "text": "Colonial period of Goa, a small southwestern state of India colonized by Portugal for over 450 years, is often looked at as a period of pollution and impurity. This article seeks to understand the role of purity and pollution rituals in the religious conversions of the sixteenth century. We undertake to closely analyze the fictionalized instances of conversions in the select novels, and draw from references from historical documents. The article combines socio-literary and historical approaches to the subject to present a broader tapestry of the religious upheavals that took place in Goa mainly in the sixteenth century.\n\nOne of the strategies adopted by the Franciscan Juan de Albuquerque, the first bishop of India to live in Asia, when he landed in Goa in 1538, was to perform and intervene in public rituals, such as the sacredness of the cathedral, the baptisms of important local figures, the blessing of the Portuguese armies leaving for war, the enthronement of governors or viceroys and the practices of ecclesiastical justice. This article offers the mapping and reconstitution of these events based on a large array of primary and secondary sources. We argue that the models that conformed these ceremonies had a pattern that replicated in Asia the European rituals. In this study we will evaluate how those rituals conformed to the world that, for the Portuguese settled there, was new and different: Goa in the 40s-50s of the sixteenth century.\n\nThis paper explores the complex connections that the Society of Jesus had with conversos —– as members themselves in the Society, as prospective entrants, and as subjects of the Portuguese Estado da India. It investigates these connections with specific reference to the situation in Goa and Cochin during the first five decades of the Society’s presence in India, from the 1540s to the 1580s, and in relation to two important aspects of the missions in India: the Goan Inquisition and Jesuit ‘accommodation’. By looking at the origins of Jesuit attitudes to the converso question —– both inside and outside the Society —– and at Jesuit discussions of Jews who retained their religion in the diaspora as well as those Christian converts from Judaism in India, the article seeks to discern the wide range of opinions in the Society that provided the key elements and limits of missionary accommodation and Jesuit distinctiveness.\n\nAbstract: During the first half of the 17th century, the Goa Inquisition increased its focus on religious offences committed by the so-called Cristãos da Terra (local Christianized populations). Many of these perceived offences occurred in connection with rituals, practices and behaviours stemming from Asian cultural and religious settings, leading the inquisitors in Goa to assess a variety of external features and performances (“signs”) in order to determine the seriousness of the offence and the penalty to impose. While these actions were primarily labelled as “idolatry”, during the 1620s, inquisitorial personnel in Goa suddenly adopted a new designation—that of “gentilidade”—to refer to a type of offence that involved apostasy from Catholicism in favour of the “Law of the Gentiles.” In this paper, I will analyse the context that led to this epistemic change in labelling religious offences, while also comparing the extant Goa Inquisition trials and summaries with later catalogues of cases where offences first began to be designated as “gentilidade.” I will argue that during the 1620s such changes in classifying religious offences were the outcome of a debate that, even though it was external to the Goa Inquisition, incidentally questioned some of its procedures and prompted its inquisitors and prosecutor to repurpose an already existing term into a broad category denoting heresy and apostasy, thus reinforcing the legitimacy of the tribunal’s judicial practices."
