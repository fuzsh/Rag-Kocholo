        "text": "1. SAINT CARDINAL JOHN HENRY NEWMAN\n\n2. Newman was born on 21 February 1801 in the City of London, the eldest of a family of three sons and three daughters.\n\n3. His father, John Newman, was a banker with Ramsbottom, Newman and Company in Lombard Street.\n\n4. His mother, Jemima (née Fourdrinier), was descended from a notable family of Huguenot refugees in England, founded by the engraver, printer and stationer Paul Fourdrinier.\n\n5. Francis William Newman was a younger brother. His younger sister, Harriet Elizabeth, married Thomas Mozley, also prominent in the Oxford Movement. The family lived in Southampton St. (Southampton Place) in Bloomsbury and bought a country retreat in Ham, near Richmond, in the early 1800s Francis W. Newman\n\n6. At the age of seven Newman was sent to Great Ealing School conducted by George Nicholas. There George Huxley, father of Thomas Henry Huxley, taught mathematics, and the classics teacher was Walter Mayers. Thomas H Huxley\n\n7. Newman took no part in the casual school games. He was a great reader of the novels of Walter Scott, then in course of publication, and of Robert Southey. Aged 14, he read sceptical works by Thomas Paine, David Hume and perhaps Voltaire SCOTT SOUTHEY PAINE VOLTAIRE\n\n8. At the age of 15, during his last year at school, Newman converted to Evangelical Christianity\n\n9. In March 1816 - the bank Ramsbottom, Newman and Co. Bank crashed, though it paid its creditors and Newman’s father left to manage a brewery.\n\n10. Mayers, who had himself undergone a conversion in 1814, lent Newman books from the English Calvinist tradition\n\n11. Yet later he came to see Evangelicalism, with its emphasis on religious feeling and on the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith alone, as a Trojan horse for an undogmatic religious individualism that ignored the Church's role in the transmission of revealed truth, and that must lead inexorably to subjectivism and skepticism.\n\n12. Newman's name was entered at Lincoln's Inn. He was, however, sent shortly to Trinity College, Oxford, where he studied widely.\n\n13. His anxiety to do well in the final schools produced the opposite result; he broke down in the examination, under Thomas Vowler Short, and so graduated as a BA \"under the line\"\n\n14. Newman then took private pupils and read for a fellowship at Oriel College, then \"the acknowledged centre of Oxford intellectualism\". He was elected a fellow at Oriel on 12 April 1822\n\n15. ANGLICAN MINISTRY On 13 June 1824, Newman was made an Anglican deacon at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.\n\n16. Ten days later he preached his first sermon at Holy Trinity Church in Over Worton (near Banbury, Oxfordshire) while on a visit to his former teacher the Reverend Walter Mayers, who had been curate there since 1823.\n\n17. On Trinity Sunday, 29 May 1825, he was ordained a priest at Christ Church Cathedral by the Bishop of Oxford, Edward Legge.\n\n18. He became curate of St Clement's Church, Oxford. Here, for two years, he was engaged in parochial work and wrote articles on \"Apollonius of Tyana\", \"Cicero\" and \"Miracles\" for the Encyclopædia Metropolitana\n\n19. In 1825, Newman became vice-principal of St Alban Hall\n\n20. In 1826 Newman returned as a tutor to Oriel, along with Richard Hurrell Froude, the two formed a high ideal of the tutorial office as clerical and pastoral rather than secular, which led to tensions in the college.\n\n21. Newman assisted Whately in his popular work Elements of Logic (1826, initially for the Encyclopædia Metropolitana), and from him gained a definite idea of the Christian Church as institution: \"a Divine appointment, and as a substantive body, independent of the State, and endowed with rights, prerogatives and powers of its own\"\n\n22. In 1827 Newman was a preacher at Whitehall\n\n23. THE OXFORD MOVEMENT 1828 Newman was appointed vicar of St Mary's University Church,\n\n25. While local secretary of the Church Missionary Society, Newman circulated an anonymous letter suggesting a method by which Anglican clergy might practically oust Nonconformists from all control of the society.\n\n26. this resulted in his being dismissed from the post on 8 March 1830; and three months later Newman withdrew from the Bible Society, completing his move away from the low church group.\n\n27. In 1831–1832, Newman became the \"Select Preacher\" before the university. In 1832 his difference with Hawkins as to the \"substantially religious nature\" of a college tutorship became acute and prompted his resignation.\n\n28. MEDITERANEAN TRAVELS - In December 1832, Newman accompanied Archdeacon Robert Froude and his son Hurrell on a tour in southern Europe on account of the latter's health.\n\n29. On board the mail steamship Hermes they visited Gibraltar, Malta, the Ionian Islands and, subsequently, Sicily, Naples and Rome, where Newman made the acquaintance of Nicholas Wiseman.\n\n30. Newman started the Tracts for the Times, from which the Oxford movement was subsequently named \"Tractarian”.\n\n31. He also gave courses of lectures in a side chapel of St Mary's in defence of the via media (\"middle way\") of Anglicanism between Roman Catholicism and popular Protestantism.\n\n32. One plan that surfaced was to set up a religious community in Littlemore, outside the city of Oxford. Since accepting his post at St Mary's, Newman had a chapel (dedicated to Sts Nicholas and Mary) and school built in the parish's neglected area. - Newman's mother had laid the foundation stone in 1835, based on a half-acre plot and £100 given by Oriel College.\n\n33. Newman continued as a High Anglican controversialist until 1841, when he published Tract 90, which proved the last of the series.\n\n34. in 1842 Newman withdrew to Littlemore with a small band of followers, and lived in semi-monastic conditions. These included… John Dobree Dalgairns. William Lockhart Henry Manning, Ambrose St John in 1843, Frederick Oakeley Albany James Christie in 1845 Saint\n\n35. Newman was received into the Catholic Church on 9 October 1845 by Dominic Barberi, an Italian Passionist, at the college in Littlemore. As a consequence he suffered broken relationships with family and friends, and attitudes to him within his Oxford circle becoming polarised.\n\n36. ORATORIAN - In February 1846, Newman left Oxford for St. Mary's College, Oscott, where Nicholas Wiseman, then vicar-apostolic of the Midland district, resided;\n\n37. in October he went to Rome, where he was ordained priest by Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni and awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity by Pope Pius IX.\n\n38. At the close of 1847, Newman returned to England as an Oratorian and resided first at Maryvale (near Old Oscott, now the site of Maryvale Institute, a college of Theology, Philosophy and Religious Education);\n\n39. then at St Wilfrid's College, Cheadle; and later at St Anne's, Alcester Street, Birmingham. St. Wilfred St. Anne\n\n40. he settled at Edgbaston, where spacious premises were built for the community, and where (except for four years in Ireland) he lived a secluded life for nearly forty years\n\n41. Before the house at Edgbaston was occupied, Newman established the London Oratory, with Father Frederick William Faber as its superior.\n\n42. Lectures on the Present Position of Catholics in England Anti-Catholicism had been central to British culture since the 16th-century English Reformation. With the papal bull Universalis Ecclesiae Pope Pius IX re-established the Catholic diocesan hierarchy in England on 29 September 1850. New episcopal sees were created and Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman was to be the first catholic Archbishop of Westminster.\n\n43. Led by The Times and Punch, the British press saw this as being an attempt by the papacy to reclaim jurisdiction over England. This was dubbed the \"Papal Aggression\". The prime minister, John Russell, wrote a public letter to the Bishop of Durham and denounced this \"attempt to impose a foreign yoke upon our minds and consciences\". Russell's stirring up of anti-Catholicism led to a national outcry. This \"No Popery\" uproar led to violence with Catholic priests being pelted in the streets and Catholic churches being attacked\n\n44. Newman was keen for lay people to be at the forefront of any public apologetics, writing that Catholics should \"make the excuse of this persecution for getting up a great organization, going round the towns giving lectures, or making speeches\".\n\n45. In total there were nine lectures: Protestant view of the Catholic Church Tradition the sustaining power of the Protestant view Fable the basis of the Protestant view True testimony insufficient for the Protestant view Logical inconsistency of the Protestant view Prejudice the life of the Protestant view Assumed principles of the intellectual ground of the Protestant view Ignorance concerning Catholics the protection of the Protestant view Duties of Catholics towards the Protestant view which form the nine chapters of the published book They constituted \"an analysis of this [anti- Catholic] ideology, satirising it, demonstrating the false traditions on which it was based and advising Catholics how they should respond to it. They were the first of their kind in English literature.\n\n46. John Gillow, president of Ushaw College, perceived Newman's language as ascribing too much to the role of the laity. Gillow accused Newman of giving the impression that the church's infallibility resides in a partnership between the hierarchy and the faithful, rather than falling exclusively in the teaching office of the church, a concept described by Pope Pius IX as the \"ordinary magisterium\" of the church.\n\n47. ACHILLI TRIAL – Giacinto Achilli (1803– 1860), an ex-Dominican friar, in 1833 Achilli, wrote “Dealings with the inquisition: or, Papal Rome, her priests, and her Jesuits” ... (1851), he had been made Master of Sacred Theology at the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. - Newman denounced this ex priest recounting his scandals, but was taken to trial for libel, and lost the case, and was not permitted a re-trial.\n\n48. EDUCATOR - In 1854, at the request of the Irish Catholic bishops, Newman went to Dublin as rector of the newly established Catholic University of Ireland, now University College Dublin.\n\n49. - It was during this time that he founded the Literary and Historical Society. - After four years, he retired. He published a volume of lectures entitled The Idea of a University, which explained his philosophy of education\n\n50. Newman believed in a middle way between free thinking and moral authority—one that would respect the rights of knowledge as well as the rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English- speaking world were Protestant.\n\n51. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship;\n\n52. however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, it would have to be a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted\n\n53. a Catholic club was formed in 1888, it was renamed the Oxford University Newman Society The Oxford Oratory was eventually founded over 100 years later in 1993. In 1859, Newman established, in connection with the Birmingham Oratory, a school for the education of the sons of gentlemen.\n\n54. Newman published several books with the Burns and Oates company, effectively saving it from bankrupcy. There is even a story that Newman's novel Loss and Gain was written specifically to assist Burns who had converted to catholicism.\n\n55. Newman's personal coat of arms upon his elevation to the cardinalate. The Latin motto, Cor ad cor loquitur, translates as 'heart speaks unto heart'.\n\n56. Charles Kingsley, wrongly asserted that \"Father Newman informs us that truth for its own sake need not be, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue of the Roman clergy.\" -In answer to Kingsley, Newman published -in bi-monthly parts his Apologia Pro Vita Sua, a religious autobiography.\n\n57. In 1870, Newman published his Grammar of Assent, a closely reasoned work in which the case for religious belief is maintained\n\n58. The issue of infallibility promulgated by Vatican I - in a letter Newman affirmed that he had always believed in the doctrine, and had only feared the deterrent effect of its definition on conversions on account of acknowledged historical difficulties.\n\n59. Newman was elevated to the rank of cardinal in the consistory of 12 May 1879 by Pope Leo XIII, who assigned him the Deaconry of San Giorgio al Velabro. -While in Rome, Newman insisted on the lifelong consistency of his opposition to \"liberalism in religion\"; he argued it would lead to complete relativism\n\n60. After an illness, Newman returned to England and lived at the Birmingham Oratory until his death.\n\n61. From the latter half of 1886, Newman's health began to fail. He celebrated Mass for the last time on Christmas Day in 1889. - On 11 August 1890 he died of pneumonia at the Birmingham Oratory. - Eight days later his body was buried alongside Ambrose St. John in the cemetery at Rednal Hill, Birmingham, at the country house of the oratory.\n\n62. The pall over the coffin bore the motto that Newman adopted for use as a cardinal, Cor ad cor loquitur (\"Heart speaks to heart\"), which William Barry, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), traces to Francis de Sales and sees as revealing the secret of Newman's \"eloquence, unaffected, graceful, tender, and penetrating“.\n\n63. His longest poem, The Dream of Gerontius, attempts to represent the unseen world along the same lines as Dante.\n\n64. James Joyce had a lifelong admiration for Newman's writing style and in a letter to his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver remarked about Newman that \"nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church\".\n\n65. Newman lived in the world of his time, travelling by train as soon as engines were built and rail lines laid, and writing amusing letters about his adventures on railways and ships, and during his travels in Scotland and Ireland. He was an indefatigable walker, and as a young don at Oriel he often went out riding with Hurrell Froude and other friends\n\n66. James A. Froude described Newman thus -there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; -a clearness of intellectual perception, -a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it -a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose\n\n67. For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven. In friendship, two intimate friends gain a glimpse of the life that awaits them in God\n\n68. On Catholics, his influence was mainly in the direction of a broader spirit and of a recognition of the part played by development, in doctrine and in church government\n\n69. colleges have been named for him in Birmingham, UK; Melbourne, Australia; Edmonton, Canada; Thodupuzha, India, and Wichita, USA\n\n70. The cause of beatification - In 2001, Jack Sullivan, an American deacon from Marshfield in Massachusetts, attributed his recovery from a spinal cord disorder to the intercession of Newman. The miracle was accepted by the Holy See for Newman's beatification, which Pope Benedict XVI announced on 19 September 2010 during a visit to Britain\n\n71. Newman was canonised on 13 October 2019, by Pope Francis, in St. Peter's Square. The ceremony was attended by Charles III, then-Prince of Wales, representing the UK\n\n72. The Congregation of the Oratory and the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales opted to place Newman's optional memorial on 9 October, the date of his conversion to Catholicism. - The reason that 9 October was chosen is because \"it falls at the beginning of the University year; an area in which Newman had a particular interest.\n\n73. John Henry Newman is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 11 August. He is remembered in the Episcopal Church on 21 February\n\n74.
