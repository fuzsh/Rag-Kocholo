But the feast of the Child Jesus that ushers in the new year kicks off the fiesta frenzy in the country. The devotion to the Santo Niño is a unique Filipino expression of faith.\n\nThe Congregacion del Santissimo Nombre del Niño Jesus, founded in 1979 by Ben Farrales, which the United Nations providentially declared then as the International Year of the Child, is spreading the devotion to the Santo Niño.\n\nMel Chionglo, acclaimed filmmaker and this year’s chairman of the Congregacion board, joined by fiesta festivities chairman Jesse Nell and vice chair Ricky Miranda, emphasized that the underlying themes of faith, fun and fiesta are timeless.\n\nThe opening Mass is set Jan. 20, 5 p.m., to be celebrated by Cubao Bishop Honesto S. Ongtioco at the PNB Financial Center Chapel.\n\nThe theme for 2011 is “O, Niño Jesus Pag-asa sa Puso ng Bawat Pilipino” (O, Santo Niño, the Hope in the Heart of Every Filipino). Sub-themes will be introduced during the nine-day novena. Chionglo said a special altar will be put up at the grand lobby of the PNB Financial Center.\n\nThe Congregacion, whose founding chair is renowned fashion designer Ben Farrales, was joined by Willy Buhay, Dingdong Bautista, Dom Martin Gomez, Efren de José, Reynaldo Gutierrez, Mannie Punzalan, Sonny Viana, Leo Limpo and Bobby Valdomar in formally organizing the group. From a small group of devotees in the early ’70s who join with their own images the annual Santo Niño exhibition and procession in Malolos, Bulacan, organized by Fr. Miguel Paez, Ulay Tantoco and Dez Bautista, it has become a major church organization with over 40 members who swear to uphold its tenets.\n\nThey replicated the Malolos event by bringing the Santissimo Nombre del Niño Jesus to homes in Quezon City.\n\nCardinal Jaime Sin recognized it as an official church organization in Oct. 27, 1979. Every year on the same date, members renew their vows.\n\nChapel, fiesta\n\nNow, 32 years later, the Congregacion has its Santo Niño Violago Chapel, donated by Oscar and Bootsie Violago and located at E. Rodriguez Ave., Quezon City. The chapel has been recently refurbished by the Violagos.\n\nIts annual Fiesta del Santo Niño has become an anticipated and a consistently well-attended religious experience both for local and foreign tourists.\n\n“All of us involved in the Congregacion are humbled to have seen what faith, hope and charity through the Santo Niño mean,” Chionglo said.\n\nGrand procession\n\nA major highlight is the annual exhibit of Santo Niño images at Long Gallery of the PNB Financial Center. Those wishing to participate must register with the secretariat at PNB Exhibit Center, Jan. 17-19, 9 a.m.- 7 p.m. They can also get in touch with Daisy Reyes at tel. 5259126.\n\nThe celebration is capped with a long procession on Jan. 30. Some 300 well-decorated carozas will participate.\n\n“As far as I know it’s the only procession where the throng is welcomed by families and countless other believers who bring out their images of the Santo Niño, have them line the procession route, and show this single act of outpouring of gratitude and homage to the Child Jesus,” Chionglo said. “It is an amazing and inspiring sight.”\n\nThis year’s Hermanos Mayores are José Ferdinand and Patricia Rojas, Consuls Louie and Mellie Ablaza, Oscar and Bootsie Violago, William and Mila How, Renato and Vicky Magadia, Ed and Fe de Guia, Ricardo and Juliet Santos, Ma. Theresa Palado, Albert and Erlinda Rosal, David and Cora Yu, Dr. Joel Mendez and Vivien Raneses, Paulino Tan, Johnny and Carol Rogge, Mark Louie and Jennifer Palado-Santiago, Gloria Binay, Mario and Jennilyn Buela, Roberto Tapalla, Rodrigo Catamora Sr., Edward Teng, Marcosa Sanchez, Steve Chan, Alberto and Herminia Co, Flaviano Calonzo, Alfredo and Flor Go.\n\nOfficers of the Congregacion for 2011, aside from Farrales and Chionglo, are Jing Chua, president; Steve de Leon, vice-president; John Enriquez, secretary; Ricky Miranda, treasurer; Bob de Castro, Chito Ilagan, Venson Nobrera and Deo Pamilar, board members.\n\nages ago\n\nSF_Catholic says:\n\nwww.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/pages/Rolling-Rosary/2234611...\n\nM.

Apparitions of Our Lady in Lipa\n\nArchbishop Ramon Arguelles has recently formed a commission to investigate once again the events of the Carmel of Lipa (1948). Since the 1991 committee set up by the late Archbishop Mariano Gaviola did not conclude its work, it is only proper that such a study be re-opened. A definitive verdict would surely have positive pastoral consequences.\n\nWe could recall these words of Archbishop Gaviola in his letter of April 16, 1995 to Bishop Salvador Quizon, the Chairman of the committee: “In short, the Special Committee was supposed to focus their investigation only on reports about Lipa Carmel that took place AFTER the promulgation of the same Decree of 1952 (underscoring in the original). However, I also authorized the Committee to gather testimonies of personal witnesses to the Lipa Carmel events in 1948 and the early years thereafter. Far from wanting to impugn the findings of the Episcopal Commission, we simply wanted to know for ourselves what would the testimonies of witnesses under the present circumstance compared to what they might have said under the circumstances when they were investigated by the CBCP Episcopal Commission.”\n\n(SGD) + LUIS ANTONIO G.

Archbishop Pinto succeeded Archbishop Edward Joseph Adams, who ended his term as Papal Nuncio to the Philippines on May 7, 2011, and has been reassigned to Greece. Archbishop Pinto arrived in the Philippines on July 15, 2011, and was welcomed by His Eminence, Gaudencio B. Cardinal Rosales, outgoing CBCP President Nereo Odchimar, and other leaders of the Catholic Church.\n\nArchbishop Pinto, previously assigned to Chile since 2007, is the 15th Papal Representative and the 10th Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. He entered the Diplomatic Service of the Holy See on May 1, 1984, and has served successively in Papua New Guinea, Argentina, and the Vatican City State Secretariat. He also served as Apostolic Nuncio to Cape Verde, Senegal, Mali, and Guinea-Bissau, and was Apostolic Delegate to Mauritania.\n\nBorn on May 26, 1952, or 59 years ago in Bari, Italy, Archbishop Pinto was ordained a priest on April 1, 1978. He holds a doctorate in Canon Law and is fluent in Italian, French, English, and Spanish.\n\nUpon his arrival in the Philippines, Archbishop Pinto said he is happy to be in a country made up by people of profound faith, vowing to “work to bring this faith with me and work together with the Filipino people.” The Papal Nuncio or Papal Legate enjoys seniority of precedence over other Ambassadors in the Philippines; he is Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. In addition to his diplomatic duties, he also serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Diocesan Episcopate in the country.\n\nWe welcome His Excellency, Archbishop Giuseppe Pinto, as the new Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, and wish him all the best and success in all his endeavors.

It is a season of penance, reflection, and fasting which prepares us for Christ's Resurrection on Easter Sunday, through which we attain redemption.\n\nWhy we receive the ashes\n\nFollowing the example of the Nine vites, who did penance in sackcloth and ashes, our foreheads are marked with ashes to humble our hearts and reminds us that life passes away on Earth. We remember this when we are told\n\n\"Remember, Man is dust, and unto dust you shall return.\"\n\nAshes are a symbol of penance made sacramental by the blessing of the Church, and they help us develop a spirit of humility and sacrifice.\n\nThe distribution of ashes comes from a ceremony of ages past. Christians who had committed grave faults performed public penance. On Ash Wednesday, the Bishop blessed the hair shirts which they were to wear during the forty days of penance, and sprinkled over them ashes made from the palms from the previous year. Then, while the faithful recited the Seven Penitential Psalms, the penitents were turned out of the church because of their sins -- just as Adam, the first man, was turned out of Paradise because of his disobedience. The penitents did not enter the church again until Maundy Thursday after having won reconciliation by the toil of forty days' penance and sacramental absolution. Later, all Christians, whether public or secret penitents, came to receive ashes out of devotion. In earlier times, the distribution of ashes was followed by a penitential procession.\n\nThe Ashes\n\nThe ashes are made from the blessed palms used in the Palm Sunday celebration of the previous year. The ashes are christened with Holy Water and are scented by exposure to incense. While the ashes symbolize penance and contrition, they are also a reminder that God is gracious and merciful to those who call on Him with repentant hearts. His Divine mercy is of utmost importance during the season of Lent, and the Church calls on us to seek that mercy during the entire Lenten season with reflection, prayer and penance.\n\nages ago\n\nMARIAN Events says:\n\nMASS READINGS for June 24, 2012 (Solemnity of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist)\n\nBook of Isaiah 49:1-6.\n\nHear me, O islands, listen, O distant peoples.

He made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me.\n\nYou are my servant, he said to me, Israel, through whom I show my glory.\n\nThough I thought I had toiled in vain, and for nothing, uselessly, spent my strength, Yet my reward is with the LORD, my recompense is with my God.\n\nFor now the LORD has spoken who formed me as his servant from the womb, That Jacob may be brought back to him and Israel gathered to him; And I am made glorious in the sight of the LORD, and my God is now my strength!\n\nIt is too little, he says, for you to be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and restore the survivors of Israel; I will make you a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.\n\nCopyright © Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, USCCB\n\nPsalms 139(138):1b.2ab.3ab.13ab-14ab.14c-15abc.\n\nO LORD, you have probed me, you know me:\n\nYou know when I sit and when I stand;\n\nYou understand my thoughts from afar.\n\nMy journeys and my rest you scrutinize,\n\nWith all my ways you are familiar.\n\nTruly you have formed my inmost being;\n\nYou knit me in my mother's womb.\n\nI give you thanks that I am fearfully, wonderfully made;\n\nWonderful are your works.\n\nMy soul also you knew full well;\n\nNor was my frame unknown to you\n\nWhen I was made in secret,\n\nWhen I was fashioned in the depths of the earth.\n\nCopyright © Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, USCCB\n\nActs of the Apostles 13:22-26.\n\nThen he removed him and raised up David as their king; of him he testified, 'I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will carry out my every wish.'\n\nFrom this man's descendants God, according to his promise, has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus.\n\nJohn heralded his coming by proclaiming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel;\n\nand as John was completing his course, he would say, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. Behold, one is coming after me; I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.'\n\n\"My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those others among you who are God-fearing, to us this word of salvation has been sent.\n\nCopyright © Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, USCCB\n\nHoly Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 1:57-66.80.\n\nWhen the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son.\n\nHer neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.\n\nWhen they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father,\n\nbut his mother said in reply, \"No. He will be called John.\"\n\nBut they answered her, \"There is no one among your relatives who has this name.\"\n\nSo they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called.\n\nHe asked for a tablet and wrote, \"John is his name,\" and all were amazed.\n\nImmediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God.\n\nThen fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these matters were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea.\n\nAll who heard these things took them to heart, saying, \"What, then, will this child be?\" For surely the hand of the Lord was with him.\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.\n\nages ago"
