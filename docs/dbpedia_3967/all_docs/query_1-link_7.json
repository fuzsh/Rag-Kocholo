        "meta_description": "2 reviews and 12 photos of PARROQUIA SAN ANDRES APOSTOL \"Located one hour south of Guadalajara, Ajijic is known for its proximity to Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico. This Mexican town derived from Nahuatl, the native language of the area with its ideal climate attracts snowbirds and expats alike making Ajijic home to Mexico's largest expat population. One of the most attractive features are its painted facades through the cobbled streets in search of crafts or dining options which my partner, his family, our friends and I visited yesterday. Another highlight is the \"Wall of the Muertos\" by the artist Efrén González honoring those inhabitants--nationals or foreigners--who lived in Ajijic. Since Mexico is predominately a Catholic country, there are churches in every town. Across the street from the wall, some of us entered the church Parroquia San Andres Apostol honoring St. Andrew. The first stone was laid in 1749 and can be found at the entrance. It was quiet, simple, and beautiful found inside and out. The bell tower sounds several times a day and is lit up at night. Since the 1950s, this colorful, cobblestoned little town has been an appealing destination. It attracts people worldwide seeking art, food, culture, music, and spirituality.\"",
