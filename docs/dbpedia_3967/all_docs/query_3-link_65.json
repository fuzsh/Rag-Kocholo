        "text": "We love Scottish Festivals and old churches and only once a year could today’s events come together. The day started with the Scottish Festival in Payson. http://www.paysonscottishfestival.org/ The music, dancers, clans and games made everyone want to be Scottish for the day.\n\nThere's only one way we wanted to end a day like that, attending a mass at an older church. Maybe it’s not as old as the churches in Scotland, but the pews feel like it, none the less. We attended the 5pm mass at San Andreas Catholic Church ∙ 315 E 100 N ∙ Payson, UT 84651 ∙ Phone: (801) 465-4782 ∙ Website: http://www.parishesonline.com/scripts/hostedsites/Org.asp?ID=2090. I wanted to visit the church before Father Joseph S. Rooney, S.J., retires. Utah's Intermountain Catholic website has a wonderful article about Fr. Rooney: http://www.icatholic.org/article/red-rock-country-keeps-priest-in-his-golden-years-7711135\n\nSan Andreas Catholic Church is only 30 minutes away from my home. I've been to the social hall once, but never into the church. You will find ample parking in the back. From the parking lot there is easy (Please click the \"Read More\" to continue. Thank you.)\n\naccess to the foyer through the double doors. The social hall is located on the same level as the foyer, There are classrooms downstairs in the basement. In order to get to the church from the foyer, go up about 6 steps, there is also a handicap lift. Inside the church, I sensed has an oldness about it; not one of neglect, but of history. When we sat in the pews, they creaked just as much as the ones at our cathedral. The unique kneelers do not pivot down, they are to be slide out as needed. We spotted doors to the left and right of the altar that were made in the craftsman era. The altar is very simple and does not distract your eyes to its importance. The crucifix is just above the altar and the tabernacle is below. To the left of the entrance is the baptismal font. The sacristy is located through the old door to the right of the altar. Above each window is a crescent shaped stained glass and I've one pictured below. The music area is to the left of the altar. There was no music at the mass we attended, which was a change for us. Instead of a hour mass, it was only 45 minutes.\n\nAlthough I was not able to speak to Father Rooney, I do wish him rest, relaxation and God's blessings for the next chapter of his life. Thank you Lord for helping me reach today's goal. As unworthy as I am, experiencing them was a blessing for my mind, heart and soul."
