This document summarizes several cases related to corporations. It begins with discussing a case where the Supreme Court ruled that a dispute between the heads of two jeepney drivers' associations that intended to consolidate but had not completed the registration process with the SEC was not considered an intracorporate dispute under the jurisdiction of the SEC. It then briefly summarizes another case involving the jurisdiction of the SEC over intracorporate controversies. The document provides high-level information on several other corporation-related cases and legal principles but does not go into detail about the specific facts or rulings of each case.",
