        "text": "Viking heritage\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, immense stone cathedrals were constructed in many parts of Europe. In Norway, a similar technique was used for building in wood, although on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe churches’ wooden doors and finials are often beautifully carved. The decorations feature an intriguing combination of Christian motifs and what is often assumed to be pre-Christian Viking themes with animals and dragons.\n\nThe excellent wood building techniques and wood carving traditions of the Vikings, used in the construction of ships and houses, were further developed and are often seen in stave churches.\n\nThere are several types of stave churches, but what they all have in common are corner-posts (“staves”) and a framework of timber with wall planks standing on sills. These walls are known as stave walls, hence the name \"stave church\".\n\nThere is reason to believe that many stave churches were built on sacred Norse ground. In olden times, the old Norse religion did not have a house of worship, but was instead practiced outdoors in sacred groves, by an altar, or at a heathen hov. The hov was often the great room, or the hall of the richest farmer in the village.\n\nWhere to find the stave churches\n\nOnce present all over Norway, today only 28 small and big stave churches remain in more or less good condition.\n\nIf you want to experience the best-preserved stave church, head to Borgund stave church in Lærdal in Fjord Norway. But you can also see some beautiful examples of elaborate stave churches in Heddal in Telemark, the reconstructed stave church at Fantoft in Bergen, and at the UNESCO listed Urnes stave church in Luster, to name a few.\n\nA stave church from Gol was moved to the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History at Bygdøy in Oslo, where it has been restored to its presumed original form and can be seen today. You can also experience a small stave church, moved from Garmo, at the Maihaugen open air museum in Lillehammer.\n\nThese are not the only churches that have been moved over the years, however.\n\nThe end of stave churches\n\nStave churches weren't always as highly appreciated as they are today. By the beginning of the 19th century, most of the stave churches had disappeared. In 1851, a new law stipulated that all churches shall have enough space to accommodate 30% of the local population. Due to the rapid population growth, many of the last remaining stave churches became too small. New, warmer, and brighter churches were built, and they rapidly became more popular than the old stave churches, which were cold and dark.\n\nThis led to the demolition or sale of many stave churches between 1851 and 1890. The massive timber was often reused in other buildings. But luckily some people saw the value in these old stave churches and worked hard to preserve them.\n\nVang Church's protector\n\nOne of the churches that was saved was beautiful Vang Church, which is the world's most visited stave church. However, funnily enough, this Norwegian church isn't in Norway at all, but is now located in Poland!\n\nThe hero of this story is Johan Christian Clausen Dahl, a painter from Bergen who became Norway's first professor of art history. He was a central figure in the creation of what is now called Fortidsminneforeningen (The Historical Preservation Society), which played a huge part in the process of preserving Stave churches. He wrote a highly influential article on the uniqueness and origin of the stave churches, and their \"wildly fantastic shapes\", which helped save the last remaining churches. He also introduced the history of these unique buildings to a broader audience of European art historians.\n\nDahl ended up purchasing Vang church at an auction and was able to convince the King of Prussia to move the church to Berlin. It was taken down piece by piece and transported south by horse, sled, and ship. A year later, the king demanded that the church be rebuilt in Lower Silesia in Poland, in what is today the town of Karpacz.\n\nAlthough the church has lost some of its Norwegian heritage along the way, one thing is certain: if Dahl hadn't purchased it in his day, it would have been lost today."
