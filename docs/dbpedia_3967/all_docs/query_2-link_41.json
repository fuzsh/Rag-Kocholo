This investigation presents an analysis and classification of the patterns, making procedures and combinations of materials of the applied brocades of the wooden altarpieces of the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, Northern Spain. Further studies have focused on the use of other analytical techniques that have completed the previous results and more recently, are being examined patterns of applied brocades belonging to the altarpieces sited in the other two provinces of the Basque Country.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2The precursor techniques of the applied brocade, its construction procedure based on bibliography and analysed examples, and a review of the documentation on Spanish cases with a brief description of their historical background and location put into context the previous corpus of information.\n\nOrigin of applied brocade\n\nMaking procedure of applied brocade\n\n8In summary, the common layer structure -from bottom to top- of the applied brocade is the following: 1. Ground, 2. Imprimatura, 3. Adhesive, 4. Filling mass, 5. Tin leaf, 6. Mordant, 7. Gold leaf and 8. Opaque paint and/or glaze.\n\nApplied brocade in Spain\n\nDocumentary sources\n\n11An analysis of the existing documentation on the topic unveils the lack of extensive and global publications in Spain about applied brocade from a historical, stylistic, technical and material perspective.\n\nHistorical background\n\nExamples of applied brocade in Spain\n\n15At present 145 artworks in Spain present applied brocade decoration. In concrete, 78 (above a 50% of the total amount) correspond to altarpieces and the remaining to sculptures. Most of them, specifically 136 pieces (including those found in Madrid; autonomous community situated in the center of Spain), are located in the North of the Peninsula. According to this, the provinces that keep the highest number of artworks with applied brocade are Araba and Burgos with 20 cases each one, followed by Palencia with 18 cases and Bizkaia with 17 cases. These locations are spread throughout the Northern route used for the introduction of the technique in Spain that connected the Cantabrian Sea ports with Burgos. More than a 50% of the 145 artworks date from the sixteenth century, whereas the other 50% mainly date from the fifteenth century, in compliance with the period of use of applied brocade in Spain.\n\nState-of-the-art in Northern Spain\n\nMethodology\n\n20Documentary sources, most of them non-published internal reports kept in official institutions and art conservation studios, have been studied to get access to the wide variety of designs employed in the decorations of the altarpieces. Those belonging to the altarpieces of Gipuzkoa have been personally documented in situ.\n\nMaking procedures of applied brocade in Gipuzkoa\n\nGround\n\n21Grounds were predominantly calcium sulphate, the exception being applied brocades of the triptych of Errenteria where calcite, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), was used applied in multiple layers. In most cases, the calcium sulphate grounds consisted of a coarse and thick ground layer at the bottom (yeso grueso), predominantly anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulphate: CaSO4) and a fine and thin ground layer on the top (yeso fino), predominantly gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate: CaSO4·2H2O). In some samples, the two gesso layers were applied in several layers sealed with a protein layer (probably glue) and in some other cases they were applied in a single layer. Other grounds had only a single zone of calcium sulphate identified as anhydrite and as anhydrite with occasional gypsum.\n\n22The calcium sulphate was normally mixed with a protein-containing material (likely animal glue) and oil in different proportions. The upper layer of the ground was usually sealed with a protein layer (possibly glue). Calcium carbonate, calcite, mixed with a protein-containing material and oil with an oil sealing layer were found in the triptych of Errenteria that is documented to come from Central Europe. Calcium carbonate grounds were more common in Central Europe than in Southern Europe where prevailed calcium sulphate grounds. The data showed that the ground used for juxtaposed applied brocades was more varied in terms of materials and construction than those of isolated applied brocades.\n\nImprimatura\n\n23The imprimatura between the ground and the applied brocade differed depending on whether it was juxtaposed or isolated brocade. Juxtaposed applied brocades were applied on top of one, two, three and four paint layers. These layers were white, orange or earth coloured principally composed of lead white and earth pigments. The most usual binding medium was a mixture of oil and protein. Isolated brocades were very often applied over glazes of organic red or copper-based green bound in oil and protein. These glazes were on top of silver leaf applied over an orange coloured bole made up of earth pigments mixed with protein (probably glue).\n\nAdhesive\n\n24Juxtaposed applied brocades appeared adhered with a layer of a protein-based adhesive over the coloured imprimatura, as found in the altarpieces of San Juan Bautista, la Santísima Trinidad and Alzaga. Resin or gum was also found in the altarpiece of San Juan Bautista. A small number of samples from the triptychs of Errenteria and Zumaia did not show adhesive.\n\n25The most common practice was the application of isolated applied brocades without adhesive on top of a tacky red or green glaze over silver leaf applied on a layer of bole, as observed in the triptychs of Errenteria, Zumaia and the altarpiece of la Piedad. Nevertheless, in both the triptych of Zumaia and the altarpiece of Alzaga, adhesive was identified on top of the glaze. In Zumaia, calcium sulphate mixed with protein and oil was found, whilst in Alzaga the adhesive was made up of a protein-containing material (likely glue) with lead white. The adhesives located in the juxtaposed applied brocades were thinner than the adhesives identified in the isolated applied brocades.\n\nFilling mass\n\n26Twelve differrent combinations of materials were characterized: 1. Protein (Zumaia); 2. Beeswax (Errenteria); 3. Lipid and red lead (Alzaga); 4. Beeswax with red lead and sometimes fibres (la Piedad, Oñati); 5. Beeswax and lead white, vermilion, azurite and red iron oxide (Zumaia); 6. Beeswax and lead white, carbon black, red iron oxide, quartz, soda-lime glass, red lead and azurite (Zumaia) (Fig. 1 Filling mass); 7. Oil and protein with gypsum (San Juan Bautista, Oñati); 8. Oil and protein with anhydrite and lead white (Alzaga); 9. Oil and protein with lead white and red iron oxide (Zumaia); 10. Protein and oil with anhydrite (San Juan Bautista, Oñati); 11. Protein with red iron oxide and gypsum (bottom layer) and protein and oil with gypsum (top layer) (la Santísima Trinidad, Oñati); 12. Protein with red iron oxide and calcium sulphate (bottom layer) and oil and protein with calcium sulphate, red iron oxide and vermilion (top layer) (la Santísima Trinidad, Oñati) (Fig. 2. Filling mass).The predominant organic components were beeswax and a combination of oil and protein.\n\nCredits: Ainhoa Rodríguez-López.\n\n27Numerous filling masses contained, within the organic matrix, inorganic particles, such as: red lead, lead white, vermilion, azurite, red iron oxide, carbon black, quartz, soda-lime glass and calcium sulphate (both anhydrite and gypsum, but not mixed together). These were combined in a variety of mixtures with different organic phases resulting in a wide variety of filling mixtures as summarized above. The purpose of these pigments was to speed up the drying of these relatively thick masses and give them some colour.\n\n28Most filling masses consisted of one layer up to 150 µm. The exceptions are the double-layer fillings discovered in the applied brocades of the altarpiece of la Santísima Trinidad, where each layer was maximum 40 µm thick.\n\nMetallic leaves and mordant\n\n29The metallic leaves that covered the filling usually consisted (from bottom to top) of tin leaf, mordant and gold leaf. The tin leaf of the juxtaposed and isolated applied brocades of the triptych of Errenteria revealed a 55-135 µm thickness, surpassing with a big difference the 7-20 µm thickness of the tin leaf identified in the other five altarpieces. This outstanding variation may be due to a possible different type of tin used in Errenteria, which can differ in composition from the one employed in the other altarpieces, resulting in a very advanced state of deterioration. This difference can be explained by the possible Central European origin of the triptych of Errenteria.\n\n30Mordants were made up of one, two and three layers. Oil was the only material characterized in the one-layer mordants (triptychs of Errenteria and Zumaia and altarpieces of San Juan Bautista and Alzaga). Double-layered mordants showed two combinations: Oil in the bottom and protein in the top (triptych of Zumaia and altarpiece of la Piedad), and oil or oil and protein in the bottom and lead white with occasional earth pigments mixed with oil and protein in the top (triptych of Zumaia). Very few samples revealed a three-layer mordant made up of oil and protein in the bottom, lead white, earth pigments, quartz, vermilion and carbon black mixed with oil and protein in the middle, and oil in the top (triptych of Zumaia).\n\n31Matte gold leaf of <1-2 µm in thickness was observed covering the tin leaf. Some applied brocades from the triptych of Errenteria and the altarpieces of la Piedad and la Santísima Trinidad showed double-gold leaf.\n\nPaint and glaze\n\n32White, red, blue, green and black opaque paints and glazes were identified covering the flat areas to stand out the relief of the brocade designs. The opaque paints showed lead white, earth pigments, organic red, azurite, carbon black, soda-lime glass and vermilion mixed with a protein-based material, oil or oil and protein. The glazes showed organic red dye and copper-based green mixed with either protein or oil. Most juxtaposed applied brocades were decorated with opaque paints contrary to isolated applied brocades which almost always showed glazes to match the glazed background.\n\n33The final colour layer (either opaque or transparent) on top of the flat gilded areas was usually made up of one coloured layer. However, two coloured layers were identified in the triptych of Zumaia and the altarpieces of Alzaga and la Santísima Trinidad.\n\n34In the triptych of Zumaia and the altarpiece of Alzaga was identified the use of a double layer composed of an intense and opaque colour in the bottom (carbon black or vermilion) and a pale and sometimes thinner colour on the top (azurite -combined with carbon black beneath- or red glaze -combined with vermilion in the bottom-). The aim of this combination was the production of a visually intense colour.\n\n35The gold leaf of the applied brocades of the altarpiece of la Santísima Trinidad was completely covered with paint: white or blue opaque paint was used on top of the flat areas and red glaze on top of the raised threads that form the brocade pattern. This resulted in one continuous two-coloured layer. The edges of the robes (sleeves, neck and hems) were also decorated with a thin black line over the white and red glazed layer resulting in two layers that combined three different colours.\n\nDesigns of applied brocade in the Basque Country\n\n36The wide range of motifs in applied brocade emerged directly from the luxurious brocaded fabrics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Applied brocade motifs exist in two typologies: juxtaposed and isolated. A total of 27 juxtaposed brocade designs and 46 isolated brocade designs have been registered amongst the applied brocade decorations of the 16 altarpieces studied in the Basque Country. In some cases, the poor condition state of the examples found has resulted in failure to recognize the designs.\n\n37Juxtaposed applied brocade imitates fabrics with uniform decoration. To achieve this uniformity, the technique employs several pieces of brocade with the same design, typically in a square or rectangular pattern, which are then juxtaposed to create a continuous decoration. Plants are the most common design theme, in particular leaves, flowers and sometimes even fruit. These are combined to create simple or more complex compositions forming symmetrical patterns around a vertical axis (triptych of Zumaia and altarpieces of la Santísima Trinidad, Markina-Xemein, Arrieta, Lekeitio, Nuestra Señora de la Encina, Aspuru and Olano). Another pattern is the combination of plant and animal designs. The most complex compositions are grouped under the motif category known as candelieri-grutesco that consists of vegetable branches in zigzag with winding leaves, which create a network inside of which imaginary figures such as sea monsters are interwoven (triptych of Zumaia and altarpieces of Arrieta, Lekeitio and San Vicente de Arana). (Fig. 3. Candelierio-grutesco design).\n\nCredits: Ainhoa Rodríguez-López.\n\n38Juxtaposed brocades with geometric pattern are also common. Sometimes, plant designs are included in geometric decorations (altarpieces of Lekeitio, el Santo Cristo, Nuestra Señora de la Encina and Fontecha). Isolated applied brocade imitates embroidery appliqués. Thus, the brocade pieces are placed at random over the surface creating a spattered pattern of applied brocades, which repeat the same design or combine different ones. Many isolated applied brocades show a plant theme. There are simple patterns of leaves or flowers with variations in the number of petals or complex and intricate outlines with pomegranates and foliage (triptychs of Errenteria and Zumaia and altarpieces of la Piedad, San Juan Bautista, Markina-Xemein, Lekeitio, Nuestra Señora de la Encina, Delika and Fontecha) (Fig. 4. Plant design).\n\n39Stars also are used as a decorative element and have only been detected in the altarpieces of Delika and Olano, Araba. Sometimes, isolated applied brocades are partial motifs extracted from juxtaposed applied brocade pieces as is observed in the altarpieces of Nuestra Señora de la Encina and Delika, Araba.\n\nConclusion\n\n40A significant number of combinations of materials of the technique within Gipuzkoa have been characterized and classified. A group of 73 designs have been registered amongst 16 altarpieces of the 23 altarpieces with applied brocade located in the Basque Country. This catalogue of designs is being decisive toward the finding of repeated juxtaposed patterns, their possible dispersal and workshop connections within the central part of Northern Spain, particularly the Basque Country and Burgos. In general terms, both the materials and the designs agree with the specialized documentation.\n\n41The few thorough publications on the subject in Spain along with the revealing data provided by our latest studies, point out a following stage of research that includes a more detailed analysis of the technique in the already studied altarpieces and the remaining ones sited in Bizkaia and Araba. These two provinces, in addition to Burgos and Palencia, comprise the higher number of artworks with applied brocade. The analysis would imply a methodical study of the materials, layer structures and designs of the wide variety of applied brocades.\n\n42Considering the results obtained up to the present and summarized in this contribution, such a broad study would very possibly provide a broaden knowledge of the materials, layering and patterns employed throughout the period of use of applied brocade in the Basque Country. This would assist in the definition of more stylistic and technical connections that result in more accurate attributions and better understanding of the dispersal of the technique in the Basque provinces and very probably in the nearby areas of Northern Spain where applied brocade was profusely used."
