        "text": "The larger sibling of Primus 981.\n\nThey both use the same kind of quick lighter of Primus own patent\n\nHere's the quick starter after cleaning and just before the assembling.\n\nThe graphite is of course too long. It's just there for illustration. I cut it to the correct length during the reassembly.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see that there's a rolled fine brass mesh tucked up at the base of the lighter (where the tapered thread is). This is done to filter the air that's taken at the base of the lighter, but still inside the tank.\n\nThere's also a very fine mesh at the bottom of the fuel pick-up tube.\n\nWarming up. It only takes about half a minute when you're inside the house. The lighter itself actually makes the mantle incandescence quite a bit:\n\nAnd in full glory in the almost dark late summer night.\n\nHi Christer\n\nI think I just found me a 1081.\n\nThe control-wheel is a lot smaller than on your shiny fine lamp. Do you know what year they started the 1081 production?\n\nDid the 1081 alway come with a green top-hat?\n\nMy tophat is missing\n\nThe plant in the Picture is Humulus, right?\n\nClaus C\n\nIndeed it is a hop plant, Claus. They grow like weed, and make nice framing on the patio, or what you might call it.\n\nI don't know exactly when they started the productin of the 1081 and the others of that type. I would guess -38 or perhaps -37.\n\nI have never seen any with another wheel than the large one. Perhaps yours has been swapped at some occasion?\n\nI'm sure Nils will pop in and enlighten us on these questions.\n\nIt's a very nice model, so I'm sure you will be pleased with it.\n\nWith such kind words, how could I refuse.\n\nThis series of lamps (980, 981, 1080, 1081) first appeared in catalogues in 1938. I have never seen an actual lantern from before 1938, so I am pretty confident that it is the first year of manufacture. They carried on until the late 1940s, maybe even 1950. They all share the same basic design with a rather special vaporiser and inner top construction. This combines the advantages of the preston coil with the ability to access the jet and cleaning needle without disturbing the mantle. The 980 and 1080 did not have a quick starter and had the same wheel as the 991 and 1020. They used the same mechanism to move the cleaning needle rod. The 981 and 1081 had a combined valve and cleaning needle activation mechanism and the larger wheel.\n\nThese lanterns are very good but I can understand that Primus didn't continue with them. They must have been relatively expensive to produce.\n\nThanks.\n\nI just got a poor photo but to use but also paid a poor price and I just bought this out of mercy and curíosity. It might even be a older 981 - but I dont have the skills to judge that. Maybe you can?:\n\nClaus C\n\nIn that case I rather guess a 981. It's hard to tell, because the proportions are the same even if the size differs between the models.\n\nBut the preheater is still in the same size on both, and the flame tube extends longer into the cage on this lamp and the fitting for it into the tank is also a bit further inside the collar, atleast as it looks, which imply a 981.\n\nAnd if so... well that's just better, because that is an even nicer lantern!\n\nSmaller and very, very, silent. If you can spare some minutes, you can see (listen to) this old clip (with the sound turned on, of course).\n\nAnd the condition is perfect. You don't need to fuzz about to get it shiny.\n\nJust make it a user.\n\nStrange thing with the in-correct control wheel.\n\nSomeone must have adapted either the wheel to fit the thicker, flattened, 981/1081 spindle or vice versa.\n\nWell, since we now has started with the alcohol , I wonder if it not just simply is a 1381.\n\nThat way actually both the top and the wheel would be correct.\n\nAnd all the rest too...\n\nNot the most common lantern, so let us see it soon Claus!\n\nI believe you are right about the 1381, because the wheel dont look like it have been fettled, despite the poor photo + the other lamp I got from seller is not a primus and he didnt have any spareparts.\n\nWithin a week I will let you see the thing.\n\nCan you possibly tell if I am to use a 1020 tophood in replacement for the missing tophood or is that too big?\n\nClaus C\n\nA Little catch-up Christer and Nils. You are right as it was a pretty nice 1381 with no bulges and upperhood.\n\nIt is born in 1943 (AH) and has no fuel-meassure as Leos shiny nice lamp has.\n\nI will clean and put it in the right thread next time you see it.\n\nClaus C\n\nLooking forward to see it Claus!\n\nIf you can't find the correct upper part for the hood, try to get a scrappy Radius 119.\n\nThe top part of that one is the closest I can see in size and looks to the green enamelled one Primus used here.\n\nIt only look better with an all nickeled top."
