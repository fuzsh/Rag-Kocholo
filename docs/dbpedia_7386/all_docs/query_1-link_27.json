        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study is the first largest cohort study to show the characteristic annual incidence of HF by gender and age with simple graphic representation in both genders using the long‐term data of sample cohort of KNHIS. The increase in HF in Korea and foreign countries also has been reported in previous studies. 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 Youn et al. presented several temporal trends of hospitalized patients with HF in Korea including mean age, aetiologies, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes. 4 Lee et al. demonstrated increasing prevalence and distribution of comorbidities of HF in Korea. The prevalence of HF in females was also higher than in males among subjects aged 60 or older in that study. 14 The number of patients with HF showed an average annual increase rate of 4.5% from 2009 to 2013. In those aged 80 years or above, the reported annual increase rate is 9%, which is about twice that of the adult population. 16 Furthermore, with the rapid increasing trend of aging population, an increase in the prevalence of HF is also expected. Actually, the aging population rate in Korea is on a very steep rise, and the percentage of the population aged 60 years and above is predicted to increase from 13.7% in 2015 to 28.6% by 2050. 17 In addition, HF is one of the leading causes of death in Korea. 18\n\nAnalysing the difference in distribution by group and pattern over time and predicting outcomes in the event of a disease are very important. Because it is essential to identify and prepare for the vulnerable groups and to cope with the long‐term path of the disease in the future, analyzing the difference in distribution by group and pattern over time and predicting outcomes in the event of a disease are very important. Especially, large numbers of patients with poor prognosis, such as HF, can be extended to social problems under the burden of medical costs and various systems. 2\n\nIn this study, we showed that the prevalence of HF is gradually increasing over the decade from 2006 to 2015 and that a steeper increase in men was revealed. Interestingly, the incidence of heart failure also tended to increase in the overall and male groups, but decreased in the female group. Given that there is no gender difference in the age distribution of the total population, the gradual decline in the incidence of HF in women is unusual. Especially considering the population aging and the increasing trend of the total female population, it is difficult to explain the decrease in the incidence of HF in women.\n\nHowever, it has been also mentioned in a previous study using the National Health Information Database (NHID) data from 2002 to 2018, 19 and there have been some reports of a decrease in the incidence of HF overseas, 20 , 21 , 22 so it is necessary to pay attention to changes in Korea in the future. A large‐scaled Norwegian population study of HF reported decreased incidence in 2016 compared with 2013 (age‐standardized incidence rates were 4.43/1000 in 2013 and 4.23/1000 in 2016) with smaller incidence in female than male under the age of 80. 20 Ten‐year age‐ and sex‐specific temporal trends in incidence of HF in Västra Götaland, Sweden, revealed a decrease in overall incidence, but incidence of HF in the oldest age groups remains high. 21 A population‐based study of 4 million individuals in the United Kingdom showed decreased incidence of HF similarly for men and women, by 7% from 2002 to 2014. 22 In the very elderly (>85 years), the standardized incidence appears to have increased, which is a conclusion similar to our study.\n\nA review article on epidemiology of HF 23 introduced a data in Denmark from 1995 to 2012, based on a national sample of hospitalized patients, which showed similar trends of decline. 24 The decline was greater in women (43%) than in men (29%) in a data of the United States like our study. 25\n\nAnother unique pattern of our analysis was a noticeable difference of peak age between male and female. In women, the incidence is highest in those aged 70 or older, but in men, the highest incidence is seen between the ages of 50 and 70 in the graph. The similar pattern was observed in Australian epidemiologic data. Prevalence of HF in Australia between 2013 and 2018 showed more men in the age range from 55 to 84 years than women, and the total number of women with HF continued to increase with age, peaking only in the highest age bracket (≥85 years). 26\n\nHowever, these studies did not provide a detailed analysis of HF incidence by sex, age, and year at a time. In our study, the incidence of HF by gender, age, and year is presented intuitively at a glance using simple graphs, and it can help to understand the changing pattern over time and the difference between both genders. Only with simultaneous analysis by year, gender, and age can make us know the vulnerable target group and analyse the cause, so it is the newest and most important point of our study to display these trends of age and sex by period so that we can see it at a glance.\n\nFrom the graph of the rapidly increasing incidence of HF from 50s in women unlike men, we can only guess the possible correlation with hormonal changes after menopause and increased cardiovascular disease. It is difficult to explain exactly why the incidence of HF in women is gradually declining as opposed to men, even though both the total and the elderly population are increasing in both men and women. Of course, besides the fact that early detection and control of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and cardiovascular diseases are becoming increasingly possible due to regular health check‐up systems and easy accessibility to medical services, genetic and hormonal differences can also be considered, as well as differences of drug compliance, alcohol, and tobacco habits between both genders. However, there are no accurate data, and it seems necessary to analyse various epidemiological and clinical characteristics in both groups in the future. And this phenomenon can be different in each country due to differences in population distribution and trends, ethnicity, epidemiology, prevalence of other diseases affecting HF, smoking, drinking habits, sociocultural characteristics, and accessibility to medical services.\n\nTherefore, further long‐term data are warranted to elucidate the characteristic annual incidence of HF according to age, gender, and other epidemiologic factors in each country.\n\nStudy limitations\n\nThe most important limitation is that the diagnosis of HF was defined on the basis of KCD codes, which may be inaccurate compared with the diagnoses obtained from a medical chart, and underreporting or misclassification can be also possible. In South Korea, accurate diagnostic codes on medical records are essential for medical insurance claims; however, omission, underreporting, or misclassification of medical diagnosis can be possible, and it should be recognized in analysing the data. In addition, one of the major limitations is that there is no analysis of mortality rate or aetiology and comorbidities of HF. Moreover, if there was an analysis of the temporal trend of mortality rate, aetiology, and comorbidities, it would have been of great help in identifying the outcome or cause of HF by period.\n\nAnother limitation is that the individual laboratory results and the drug history of the patients could not be included in the data. So many indexes including ejection fraction in echocardiography or any laboratory data were not obtained, and more precise assessment could not be performed."
