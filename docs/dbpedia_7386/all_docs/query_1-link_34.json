        "text": "Preface to Building A New NATO: The Search for Peace and Security In an Unsettled World\n\nThis year's NATO Workshop--the eleventh in a series of annual meetings--was held in Os, Norway (near Bergen) on 15-19 June 1994. Its site at the Solstrand Fjord Hotel on the edge of beautiful Bjørnefjorden provided a perfect environment for informal, but thoughtful presentations and discussions on \"Building a New NATO\" by more than one hundred representatives of NATO countries and new \"Partner\" nations. The Workshop papers are presented in this volume. Since the authors participated in the Workshop on a personal basis, their views do not necessarily represent official positions of their governments.\n\nThis year's Workshop was the first in which Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General George Joulwan participated as Honorary General Chairman. When General Joulwan was absent, Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Northern Europe General Sir Garry Johnson helped preside over the Workshop sessions. Other military contributors included NATO Commanders-in-Chief for the Allied Forces of Southern and Central Europe; the Commander-in-Chief U.S. Army Europe; Chief of Staff of the U.K. Air Force; Chairman of the NATO Military Committee; and the Chiefs of Defense of Norway, Finland, and Italy. Among government and other leaders were Belgium's Vice Prime Minister (now the Secretary General of NATO), Defense Minister of Norway, Foreign Minister of Sweden, Defense Minister of Lithuania, Prime Minister of Latvia, the Deputy Secretary General of NATO, and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. Six of the participating countries, including Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Ukraine had never been represented in past NATO Workshops, while the Central European countries came for the first time in their new, active roles as contributors in the \"Partnership for Peace.\"\n\nThe Norwegian support for the Workshop was truly outstanding. Chief of Defense Admiral Torolf Rein welcomed us with warmth to the Workshop, and Defense Minister J. H. Kosmo hosted a wonderful dinner. Lt. Gen. Hjalmar Sunde, Chris Prebensen of the Defense Ministry, Rear Admiral H. Neegaard, Captain Arne Ness, and Major Per Engeset were very helpful with the planning and organization. We especially appreciate the strong support and participation of both the Commander North Norway, General Arne Solli (who has since become the Norwegian Chief of Defense), and the Commander South Norway, Vice Admiral Bjørnar Kibsgaard. The former Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, General Vigleik Eide, helped lead discussions on the Workshop wrap-up panel.\n\nRear Admiral Rino Paus of the Royal Norwegian Navy assembled a highly professional and dedicated support team led by Cdr. Jarl Lindhjem, Lt. Eivind Bøe, Slt. Morten Clementsen, and Slt. Jørn Furnes. They were assisted by Naval District West sailors Kjetil Alvheim, Sven Bech Sørensen, Jon Aude Erichsen, Raymond Fosse, Mattis Gutu, Roald Hauge, Christian Jønsson, Rune Karlsen, Christian Eide Lodgaard, and Hua B. Long. Other sailors served as drivers during the Workshop, including Terje Almenning, Jan Ståle Damås, Bjørn Tore Årevik, Asbjørn Lirhus, Terje Apelthun, Stig Magne Frøystein, and Kenneth Loftaas. The military police team was led by LtCdr. Åge Johansen, Lt. Torolf B. O. Eide, Slt. Jørn Furnes, Slt. Gunnar Dyngeland, PO. Atle Lessum, PO. Jan Erik Buer, PO. Helge Søfteland. Their group included Sailor Thor Henning Johnsen, as well as military policemen Jan Tore Fjelland, Harald Haugland, Thomas Jacobsen, Ståle Kvarven, Odd Harald Nyvoll, Raymond Åsheim, John Olav Einemo, Andreas Klavenes, Kjell Hovden, Robert Lundem, Kenneth Melbye, Andreas Høistad, Harald Eidsmo, Kjell Strømmen, Fredrik Skaug, Morten Spissøy, Ronny Monslaup, Kjetil Sandvik, Audun Giske, Stian Holmefjord, Johnny Bolstad, and Nils Petter Larsen. These Norwegian officers, sailors, and members of the military police provided Workshop administrative support, as well as transportation and security.\n\nAt the Solstrand Fjord Hotel, the perfect combination of a small resort hotel and a well-equipped center for high-level international conferences, we found professionalism, smiles, and the pleasant atmosphere of a private home. Mrs. Børrea Schau-Larsen, the owner, and Mr. Sukwant Dhindsa, the Assistant General Manager, arranged everything beautifully for our enjoyment: musicians from the Bergen Symphony Orchestra, a local youth choral group, a Norwegian folk dancing group; trips for spouses to the Sognefjord by a combination of bus, train, and boat and to the Rosendal Barony in the Hardangerfjord; as well as a boat trip with participants and spouses to Ole Bull's island of Lysøen.\n\nThe NATO Workshop series, now in its twelfth year, has been possible through the continued organizational and financial support of the following organizations:\n\nMany of these organizations are represented on our Board of Directors, which, together with sponsors and Workshop chairmen, provide the Workshop with direction and leadership:\n\nAmbassador Kent Brown; United States Ambassador to Georgia General Peter Carstens; Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Dr. Ing. Fausto Cereti; President and CEO, Alenia Lieutenant General Paul G. Cerjan; President, National Defense University Dr. J. Patrick Crecine; President, Georgia Institute of Technology General J.B. Davis (Ret.); Former Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Dr. Phil DePoy; President, NORC, University of Chicago General Robert J. Dixon (Ret.); Former Commander-in-Chief, Tactical Air Command Air Chief Marshal Sir David Evans, GCB, CBE, CBIM; British Aerospace Plc Lieutenant General R. J. Evraire; President, NATO Defence College (Rome, Italy) Vice Admiral Robert George; Canadian Military Representative to NATO Military Committee Major General Kenneth L. Hagemann; Director of Defense Nuclear Agency Dr. Robert Hermann; Vice President for Science and Technology, United Technologies Admiral James R. Hogg (Ret.); President, National Security Industrial Association Dr. Frank B. Horton III; Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) Lieutenant General Giuseppe Degli Innocenti: Italian Military Representative to NATO Military Committee Dr. Stuart Johnson; National Defense University General George Joulwan, USA: Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral Pierre Lacoste; Past President, Fondation pour les Etudes de Defense Nationale General Jose Lemos Ferreira; Past President of the Board, Aeroportos e Navegacao Aerea Mr. Albert Lubarsky; Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) Mr. Gordon Lynch; Vice President of Boeing Defense and Space Group in Europe General Jack N. Merritt; President, Association of the United States Army Lieutenant General Malcolm R. O'Neill; Director, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization Vice Admiral John T. Parker (Ret.); President, J. T. Parker Associates, Inc. Mr. John Quilty; Senior Vice President and Washington C3 General Manager, MITRE Corporation General John Shalikashvili, USA; Chairman of United States Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shaud (Ret.); Director, United States Air Force Aid Society Admiral William D. Smith (Ret.); Former United States Military Representative to NATO Military Committee Lieutenant General Jörn Söder; German Military Representative to NATO Military Committee Ambassador Walter Stadtler: U.S. Department of Defense Lieutenant General Hjalmar Sunde; Norwegian Military Representative to NATO Military Committee Mr. Malcolm R. Uffelman; Vice President, E-Systems Inc. Dr. W. F. van Eekelen; Secretary General, Western European Union Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent GBE KCB DSO; Chairman of the NATO Military Committee\n\nAmong these organizations and individuals, we greatly appreciate those who became sponsors this year: Gordon Lynch of the Boeing Company--one of the original sponsors of the Workshop series a decade ago; Börje Johanson and Egon Linderoth of Bofors, representing the first sponsoring organization from a Scandinavian country and the first from one of NATO's new \"Partner\" countries; John Largent of Hughes Europe s.a.n.v., whose advice was always helpful; Frank Parker (who had sponsored past NATO Workshops before joining ITT Defense Electronics) and Gary Lind also of ITT Defense Electronics; François Heisbourg of MATRA Defense Espace who shared his experience as the former Director of the International Institute of Strategic Studies; Richard Milburn, Harry Pearce, and Brigadier General Edward von Kospoth of the newly-combined Northrop-Grumman company; Olivetti, which, through its Secretary General and, in Norway, Mr. Jan Scheifloe and Mr. Christian Støldal of its Scanvest Olivetti organization, provided computer support and loaned us much needed notebook computers; Dr. Donald Kendall and Mr. C. A. von Stackelberg of Raytheon; and Mr. Angelo Dalle Molle, the founder of Centro Studi della Barbariga who has, for many years, encouraged us to think about new uses of military forces and capabilities in the post Cold War situation.\n\nOther important advisors and contributors were Dr. Ing. Fausto Cereti, the President and CEO of Alenia, Ing. Fabio Dani, and Mr. Guido Spina of Alenia. With Admiral Guido Venturoni, Chief of Defense of Italy, and Lieutenant General Giuseppe Degli Innocenti, they strengthened Italy's many Workshop contributions. At Deutsche Aerospace, Dr. Johann Schæffler, Executive Assistant to the President, helped coordinate our plans to hold the 1995 NATO Workshop in Dresden, Germany.\n\nRucj Uffelman, Hal Vorhies, and Brig. Gen. Robert Norman of E-Systems have been valued advisors. Their many years of participation brings long-term continuity to their sponsorship. Georgia Institute of Technology has a special role: Dr. Patrick Crecine, President of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who has been one of the Workshop leaders since our first meeting eleven years ago, with Professor Michael Salomone and Major General Gerald Carey of the Georgia Tech Research Institute are developing the Workshop's academic dimension.\n\nThe contributions of Lieutenant General Paul G. Cerjan, President of the National Defense University, together with Vice President Ambassador Howard Walker, Dr. Stuart Johnson, Colonel Robert Clark, Mr. Gary Glovinsky, Ms. Carol Steiner, and Ms. Taylor, were vital since NDU is both a university sponsor of the Workshop and a major \"internal think-tank\" of the U.S. Department of Defense. At the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, we appreciate the contributions of Colonel Katherine J. Ward, Vince Roske, and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Drifmeyer. C3I Principal Deputy Barry Horton has been coordinating much of the Pentagon participation and added to efforts of Albert Lubarsky in that area. With MITRE Corporation (where Vice President John Quilty has helped for many years), they have directed our attention to important command and control issues.\n\nDirector of Net Assessment Andrew Marshall played a key role as he has since the first Workshop more than a decade ago. Glenna Hughes of his office arranged for the necessary publication approvals and helped smooth the administration of our contract.\n\nAgain this year, Major General Kenneth Hagemann, Director of the Defense Nuclear Agency, sponsored and chaired one of the Workshop's most influential sessions: an address by SACEUR followed by a panel session with each of his CINCs. Rear Admiral Denny Wisely, the Agency's Director for Operations, was responsible for much of the planning and chaired a special panel that provided Russian, Georgian, Swiss, and U.S. views on Partnership for Peace. Other important DNA contributions came from both William Daitch and Major Michael Davis.\n\nLieutenant General Malcolm R. O'Neill, Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and Dr. J. David Martin, with help from General Jack Merritt, President of the Association of the U.S. Army, organized with Les Aspin, former U.S. Secretary of Defense, an outstanding session on problems of proliferation. We especially enjoyed working with Kitty Stepp at BMDO and Joan Casey in Les Aspin's office. Ambassador Henry Cooper, with years of high-level experience on these issues, was a valued advisor.\n\nAmbassador Kent Brown helped arrange for Georgian National Security Advisor Tedo Japaridze to attend this year. Vice Admiral Robert George, Canadian Military Representative to the NATO Military Committee, provided NATO and NACC officials with Canadian air transportation to last year's Workshop in Budapest and continues to assist the Workshop by permitting Manon Van der Horden, a member of his staff, to help us during the coming year. We enjoyed working with Lt. Col. Rick Froh in the office of the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee.\n\nA small, but extremely effective international staff worked smoothly with their Norwegian colleagues from Naval District West and the Solstrand Fjord Hotel to make the Workshop a very pleasant experience for everyone. This team included Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Drifmeyer of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and Major Thomas Petzold of SHAPE. Together, they led a very well-organized and effective group from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (Commander Tor Vestlie, Sergeant Major Hans Dirks, Sergeant Gerald Johnson) in addition to William Daitch of the Defense Nuclear Agency, and Mary Wu and Anne Baylon from the Center for Strategic Decision Research. The professionalism of this staff, whose members always worked past midnight in the days before the conference, was remarkable. In addition, Major Petzold's wife, Claudine, participated as a much appreciated volunteer. We owe her our thanks for her efforts and personal warmth. Minister Vernon Penner, International Affairs Advisor to SACEUR, assisted in a variety of unplanned ways in order to help adapt the Workshop to the changing international situation and many unexpected events. We especially appreciated working with Brigadier Harry Brown, Colonel Roger Rains, Major Mac Coleman, and others on the staff of General Joulwan. SACEUR's photographer Sergeant Jon Long provided a fine cover photograph for this volume.\n\nWe appreciated the advice and wisdom of two Vice Honorary General Chairmen, SHAPE Chief of Staff General Peter Carstens and General J.B. Davis (who was Honorary General Chairman of the Workshop until his recent retirement from the U.S. Air Force). Members of the Workshop executive committee (General Robert Dixon, Air Chief Marshal Sir David Evans of British Aerospace, Corporate Vice President Robert Hermann of United Technologies, and General Jack Merritt) were also helpful. Their many suggestions made the Workshop more valuable to all.\n\nAt Strategic Decisions Press, Anne Baylon's editing team of Carol Whitely and Alice Kleeman put the book in final form. Mary Wu, now a student at Stanford University Law School, and Franck Pignol also contributed. Charles Arkebauer at The Typemasters in Palo Alto, California performed the Linotronic typesetting work. Scribner Graphic Press of Menlo Park, California printed the book on its Heidelberg SORDZ and Heidelberg MOV presses. At Scribner, Mary Cotter, Mary Anne Fernando, and Kevin Cotter prepared the negatives, plates, and organized the printing and binding efforts.\n\nFor several years, a portion of this research was supported by Scientific Services Agreement number DAAL03-91-C-0034, Delivery Order No. 1298 with the Battelle Research Triangle Park Office. Dr. George Outterson and L.G. Franklin of Battelle as well as Hodges Throckmorton of the Army Research Office administered this contract with an efficiency of effort that helped make the NATO Workshop series increasingly valuable to its sponsoring organizations and its participants.\n\nFinally, we are grateful for the efforts of many others, too numerous to mention, who contributed their skill and their efforts to the NATO Workshop and the process of building a new NATO.\n\nMenlo Park, California\n\nNovember, 1994"
