        "text": "Nordic Narratives of Nature and the Environment is the first English language anthology that presents ecocritical research on northern European literatures and cultures. The contributors examine specifically Nordic narratives of nature and the environment, with a focus on the cultures and literatures of the modern northern European countries Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, including Sápmi, which is the land traditionally inhabited by the indigenous Sami people. Covering northern European literatures and cultures over a period of more than two centuries, this anthology provides substantial insights into both old and new narratives of nature and the environment as well as intertextual relations, the variety of cultural traditions, and current discourses connected to the Nordic environmental imagination. Case studies relating to works of literature, film, and other media shed new light on the role of culture, history and society in the formation of narratives of nature and the environment, and offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted overview of the most recent ecocritical research in Scandinavian studies.\n\nThis article examines the Norwegian climate fiction television series Okkupert [Occupied] (2015-), focusing on the ways in which it reveals the complicity of Nordic subjects in an ecological dystopia. I argue that in illuminating this complicity, the series reimagines the Norwegian national self-conception rooted in a discourse of Norway's exceptionalist relation to nature. I show how Norway's green (self-)image is expressed through what I call \"white ecology\"-an aesthetics of whiteness encoded in neoromantic mountainous winter landscapes widely associated with the North, but also in the figure of the Norwegian white male polar explorer. I argue in this article that Occupied challenges this white-ecological masculine discourse through \"dark ecology\" (Morton, 2007), embodied by Russia and expressed by the avoidance of spectacular landscape aesthetics as well as by the strategy of \"enmeshment\", facilitated by the medium of televisual long-form storytelling and the eco-noir aesthetics.\n\nHow can cultural works from the distant past-such as the Middle Ages-teach us ethical modes of behavior for today? One form of ecopoetics emerges through slow practice, making the reader collaborate in the measured process of co-creating the emotional impact of an imaginative text. Drawing on rich debates about slow cinema, this essay suggests how Chaucer's The Clerk's Tale-from his grand fourteenth-century poem, The Canterbury Tales-evokes a slow eco-aesthetics with ethical impact. The relative slowness of walking shapes how individuals respond to their environment. In turn, a deceleration of perception affects how travel comes to be written about, as seen in the tale of Patient Griselda. Introduced by Giovanni Boccaccio and adapted by such writers as Francesco Petrarch, Geoffrey Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan, she acts dynamically through her apparent silence and notorious patience. The environmental humanities offer paradigms for us to consider the strategies of slowness and patience. This essay shows how medieval pilgrimage literature evokes a slow aesthetic which is at the same time an ecocritical strategy. Slowness results in an enduring impact and heightened sensitivity to the ecological damage for which we all are culpable. Sloweness somatically inculcates key aspects of environmental awareness. Pilgrimage texts from the Middle Ages teach us slow ethical aesthetics, suggesting that the medieval moment-finally and a long time coming-is now. Resumen ¿Cómo puede la producción cultural del pasado más lejano, como la del medievo, enseñarnos modos éticos de comportamiento para hoy en día? Una de las formas de la ecopoética surge a través de la práctica lenta, haciendo que el lector colabore en el proceso medido de co-crear el impacto emotivo de un texto ficticio. Inspirado en los valiosos debates en torno al slow cinema (cinematografía lenta), este ensayo plantea cómo El cuento del erudito (The Clerk's Take) de Chaucer, de su gran poema del sigo XIV, Los cuentos de Canterbury, logra evocar una ecopoética lenta con un impacto ético. La relativa lentitud del caminar determina cómo responde el individuo a su medio ambiente. La desaceleración de la percepción, a su vez, afecta a la forma en la que se narra el viaje, como se ve en el cuento de la paciente Griselda. Introducida por primera vez por Giovanni Boccaccio y adaptada por escritores como Francesco Petrarca, Geoffrey Chaucer, y Christine de Pizan, ella actúa dinámicamente por medio de su aparente silencio y su notoria paciencia. Las humanidades ambientales nos ofrecen paradigmas para considerar las estrategias de la lentitud y la paciencia. Este ensayo muestra cómo la literatura del peregrinaje medieval evoca una estética lenta que es a la vez una estrategia ecocrítica. La lentitud resulta en un impacto duradero y una sensibilidad aguzada hacia el daño ecológico del que somos todos culpables. La lentitud corporal inculca aspectos clave de concienciación medioambiental. Los textos medievales sobre el peregrinaje nos enseñan la lenta estética ética, sugiriendo que el momento medieval, tan largamente esperado, por fin ha llegado.\n\nSince an ideal Urland served Germany to define its unique soul, Paris incarnated the revolutionary imprint of the French nation, Castile became the mystic and warlike metonymy of Spain, and the emergence of the new American nations saw in the Argentinian Pampas, the US West, or in the Colombian rainforest the founding keys for the development of their cultural identities, a variety of new conceptions of belonging and attachment to any particular place has proliferated. These new conceptions have challenged the nation-state scale by taking two divergent routes. On the one hand, localness has been valued, be it defined in terms of political regions, federal states, bioregions, towns, even neighbourhoods, with the purpose of preserving those spaces, identities and cultural realities that the administrative character of nation-states ignore. On the other hand, and at the same time frequently challenging supra-national institutions, globalness has also been valued; the sense of belonging to planet Earth as the common homeland for all humankind, for any localized political or environmental intervention has global consequences, and globalness is the proper land-scale for a global planetary identity. Literary landscapes cover all aspects of belonging and attachment to any particular place and meet the expectations of every case and scale: federal states, nation-states, bio-cultural-regions, planet Earth, and the whole universe, be it considered as a unique ecosystem or as a cyberspace. Literary landscapes adapt themselves to any spatial, ideological, political and cultural scope, and while being powerful tools to strengthening identities and mending social fabrics with cultural ties, they are also very useful to promote exclusion, master-servant relationships, or consign cultures to oblivion. Such malleability makes the critical reading of literary landscapes a serious task, for reading literary landscapes entails the great ethical and aesthetical responsibility of showing one´s own conception of inhabiting the world in dialogue with that of the text. This is specially true after the publication of the first global study of the perils of progress (The Limits to Growth, 1972), due to the amount of information about the ecological crisis that has reached the media since then, and the general feeling of earthliness that has been growing ever since. Under the light of such ecological consciousness, literary landscapes affirm or contest nationalist feelings of the nation-states, and may propose challenging literary and cultural cartographies for a sustainable future.\n\nTo date consideration of negative emotions in the context of cinema has been largely limited to the issue of why spectators would be drawn to films that target psychological responses such as fear and disgust. The aim here is to consider the phenomenon of negative emotion as a motivating factor in the context of, not spectatorship, but film production. The focus is on documentary filmmaking with a strong ethnographic dimension, the camera being used to record the circumstances and culture of an ethnic group to which the filmmaker does not belong. Get a Life by Michael Klint (in collaboration with Claus Bie) is presented as an instance of guilt-based filmmaking, the filmmaker having repeatedly foregrounded his own guilt as a decisive factor in the film’s making. A so-called “dogumentary” film based on filmmaker Lars von Trier’s “Documentarist Code,” Get a Life is shown to rely on moral notions that are consistent with the future-oriented and redemptive aspects of the phenomenon of guilt. The filmmaker’s rhetoric foregrounds the idea of “making a difference” for the Nigerian victims of a devastating flesh-eating disease (noma) and further purports to challenge the norms underwriting TV reporting on the “Third World.” Analysis of Get a Life, however, reveals it to be a failed work on moral grounds. The filmmakers’ self-importance, deficient selfunderstandings, and self-deceptions regarding the bases for their putative actions on behalf of others are identified as especially problematic. The relevant failings warrant attention at a time when filmmakers from privileged cultures increasingly pursue performative-style documentary filmmaking, fueled by purportedly moral intentions, in a variety of contexts in the Global South.\n\nLill-Ann Körber & Ebbe Volquardsen (eds.): The Postcolonial North Atlantic: Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands (= Berliner Beiträge zur Skandinavistik; 20) Berlin: Nordeuropa-Institut der Humboldt Universität 2014, 422 p., ISBN 978-3-932406-35-5, € 49,80.

The complex aftermaths of Denmark’s sovereignty over its North Atlantic territories and their ongoing nation building processes lie at the core of this book. Today, we are witnessing region building processes beyond bilateral links to Denmark. How do the countries position themselves, individually and collectively, vis-à-vis the European metropolitan centres, a larger transcontinental North Atlantic region, the »hot« Arctic, and global histories of colonialism and decolonisation? By examining the region from cultural, literary, historical, political, anthropological and linguistic perspectives, the articles in this book shed light on Nordic colonialism and its understanding as »exceptional«, and challenge and modify established notions of postcolonialism. Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are shown to be both the (former) subjects as well as the producers of cultural hierarchisations in an entangled world."
