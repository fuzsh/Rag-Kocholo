        "text": "Twelve-year-old Tor and his friends break into The Castle one night to take revenge on Tommy who didn’t invite them to the year’s coolest birthday pool party for their class.\n\nThe Castle is a luxury hotel and Tommy is the owner’s son. But what starts off as an innocent revenge suddenly develops into something far more dramatic. Because Tor spots a girl through the basement window who doesn’t look like a regular hotel guest.\n\nTor sneaks inside on subsequent nights and eventually discovers that there’s something funny going on at the Castle. Why is million-dollar art disappearing? Why does the girl have to stay in the basement? And where do they come from, all those members of staff?\n\nThe Castle is a novel about injustice, friendship and the stirrings of emotion between boy and girl."
