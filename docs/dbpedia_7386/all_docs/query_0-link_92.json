        "text": "No, coffee is not inherently harmful to healthy adults when consumed in moderate amounts (1-4 cups). Several studies support this, including a 2023 review by Stephen Safe published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences. However, excessive intake can raise blood pressure, cholesterol, cortisol levels, and anxiety.\n\nSo, is coffee bad for you? It might be if you are overly stressed, suffer from GERD symptoms such as acid reflux, are trying to conceive, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. The side effects of coffee in females include miscarriage, interactions with medications, high blood pressure, and an increased likelihood of developing rheumatoid arthritis, as indicated by a study from Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the University of Alabama.\n\nWhile drinking coffee first thing in the morning might cause heartburn and acid reflux in some people, it doesn't necessarily break a fast or cause bloating. It can, however, stain your teeth and clothes, and disrupt sleep. Myths about coffee stunting growth, causing kidney stones, or leading to weight gain have been debunked.\n\nIf you're concerned about the health effects of caffeine (which are listed below), consider a healthy alternative like Swiss Water Process decaf coffee. Our Powerbean Coffee uses specialty-grade beans and chemical-free methods for a superior antioxidant profile and flavor. This results in one of the healthiest decaf coffees with a distinct taste due to its unique geographic origins.\n\n1. Coffee And Blood Pressure\n\nCoffee raises blood pressure within the first few hours after consumption. Giuseppe Grosso at the University of Catania calls this the \"coffee paradox\": caffeine raises blood pressure, yet coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of hypertension. Blood pressure, the force of blood against vessel walls, can spike briefly after drinking a significant amount of coffee (think 3 or more cups at once). However, according to the American Heart Association, this effect seems primarily focused on people with severe hypertension. Those without hypertension or with grade 1 hypertension (mildly elevated blood pressure) may not experience this effect as strongly. So, how exactly does coffee affect blood pressure?\n\nA 1988 Australian study involving 5,147 participants, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, found that people who drank caffeinated coffee had about 4 points higher systolic blood pressure and 2 points higher diastolic blood pressure compared to those who didn't consume caffeine. However, this effect disappeared within 3 hours, suggesting regular coffee drinking doesn't necessarily lead to chronic high blood pressure.\n\nDoes this mean that drinking coffee causes high blood pressure? Not necessarily. While a single cup of coffee might cause a short-term increase in blood pressure, regular caffeine intake may not have a lasting negative effect. This aligns with a 2011 study by Arthur Eumann Mesas from the Autonomous University of Madrid, which showed that 200-300 mg of caffeine led to a temporary increase in blood pressure, but only in individuals with diagnosed hypertension.\n\nIt's always best to consult your doctor for personalized advice about coffee consumption, especially if you have high blood pressure. The Journal of the American Heart Association recommends that patients with severe hypertension limit coffee consumption to less than two cups per day to reduce the risk of CVD mortality.\n\n2. Coffee And Cholesterol\n\nCoffee consumption influences cholesterol levels, a structural component of cell membranes. While cholesterol is vital for building cells, hormones, some vitamins, and bile acids, high levels can lead to heart disease. So how does drinking coffee affect cholesterol? A 2012 study review from several epidemiological studies by Peking University published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that drinking coffee for 45 days increased total cholesterol and LDL (commonly known as \"bad\" cholesterol) levels, especially with unfiltered coffee. The study showed that those who had hyperlipidemia (an abnormally high level of fats in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides) were more sensitive to the cholesterol-raising effect of coffee.\n\nThat's in line with a 1995 study from the University of South Carolina published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology that found that for those who had very high blood pressure, drinking a lot of coffee, like two or more cups a day, seemed to make their chances of having high cholesterol problems go up. So is coffee bad for your cholesterol levels? While coffee doesn't have cholesterol, fat, or nicotine, drinking moderate and high amounts of caffeine (3–4 cups per day or more) is linked to high cholesterol levels, as shown in a 2023 study by Juliana Senftinger and Julius Nikorowitsch from University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that while high caffeine consumption was correlated with raised LDL-cholesterol levels, it was also related to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. What about different types of coffee, like espresso or cold brew? Is espresso bad for cholesterol? It depends on how much you drink. A 2022 study by Åsne Lirhus Svatun from UiT The Arctic University of Norway found that drinking 3-5 cups of espresso a day was linked to higher cholesterol levels in both men and women, while filtered coffee did not.\n\nThis suggests that the magnitude of the increase in LDL depends on the brewing method. This is confirmed by researchers from Wageningen Agricultural University who found that coffee beans contain the diterpenes cafestol and kahweol, which raise cholesterol levels. Since espresso extracts more diterpenes, such as cafestol and kahweol, than instant and drip-filtered coffee brews, it has a greater impact on cholesterol levels. This suggests that people at risk of high cholesterol may benefit from drinking paper-filtered coffee. This graph, sourced from a 1994 study published in the Journal of Lipid Research, shows which coffee types are best for cholesterol (and which to avoid) based on the amount of diterpenes per cup.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the content of cafestol and kahweol in different coffee brews based on the brewing method, as per 1997 study from Nestlé Research Centre in Switzerland:\n\nBrewing Method Cafestol Content (mg per cup) Kahweol Content (mg per cup) Scandinavian-style Boiled 7.2 7.2 Turkish-style 5.3 5.4 Espresso 1.0 1.0 Instant Negligible Negligible Drip-filtered Negligible Negligible\n\nSince cholesterol is a precursor to many steroid hormones, including cortisol, drinking coffee may contribute to increased cortisol concentrations due to its associated elevation of cholesterol, according to the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\n3. Coffee And Cortisol\n\nCoffee consumption can influence cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone associated with stress response, metabolism, and immune function. How does coffee affect cortisol? This is mainly due to caffeine. Caffeine can make your body release more cortisol and adrenaline (often referred to as the \"fight or flight\" response to stress or danger), even when you're not doing anything stressful, as shown in the 2004 book titled 'Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, and the Brain' by Astrid Nehlig.\n\nResearch on how caffeine impacts cortisol isn't completely clear-cut. Some studies show it directly increases cortisol, while others suggest it mainly amplifies cortisol levels when you're already stressed or exercising. For example, a 1994 clinical trial from Duke University Medical Center found that caffeine elevated epinephrine during work by 37% but did not affect cortisol levels.\n\nOn the other hand, a more recent 2007 randomized controlled trial published in the Metabolism Journal found that taking 200 mg of caffeine twice a day (equivalent to 2 cups of brewed coffee per day) did not increase cortisol levels over a 7-day period. Interestingly, a 2006 study by William R. Lovallo at the University of Oklahoma found that 750 mg of caffeine (equivalent to 6 cups of coffee) didn't directly increase cortisol when taken alone. But when combined with stress or exercise, it caused a significant rise in cortisol levels compared to when no caffeine was consumed, as shown in this graph.\n\nDoes this mean that coffee is bad for you when you're stressed? Not necessarily. Coffee may amplify the body's stress response when combined with other stressors like mental stress, anxiety, or physical exercise. If you're feeling particularly stressed, consider limiting your coffee intake for the time being.\n\n4. Coffee And Anxiety\n\nCoffee can exacerbate anxiety, a feeling of unease, worry, or fear. Anxiety is defined as a persistent feeling of apprehension, tension, or uneasiness that stems from the anticipation of danger. So, what is the connection between drinking coffee and anxiety? In a 2024 meta-analysis by Chen Liu from Xuzhou Medical University, which included 546 participants, it was found that caffeine intake was significantly associated with increased risk of anxiety in healthy people without psychiatric disorders. This was especially true when intake exceeded 400 mg (more than 4 cups of coffee), the borderline of FDA recommended daily coffee intake. Liu explains that the anxiogenic effect of caffeine can influence an individual's susceptibility to caffeine-induced anxiety.\n\nDoes this mean that coffee is bad if you have anxiety? Well, yes and no. A 2015 Cardiff University study by Gareth Richards and Andrew Smith found that coffee increased anxiety among secondary school students. However, they also observed that lower caffeine doses reduced anxiety, suggesting that excessive intake or individual caffeine sensitivity may worsen anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a 2023 study by Nadir M Makki from Taibah University found no significant association between the severity of anxiety, stress, and daily caffeine (more than 300-400mg) consumption among university students.\n\nBut what if coffee gives me anxiety? How can I get rid of it after drinking coffee? To manage the effects, try these tips:\n\nGradually decrease your daily caffeine intake.\n\nDrink more water to dilute caffeine.\n\nPractice deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.\n\nSimply wait it out as the effects are temporary.\n\nHow long does coffee anxiety last? The physiological effects of coffee anxiety, such as increased skin conductance (related to sweating), skin temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, can peak within 10-30 minutes of consumption, according to a 1997 Clinical Trial by experts from Unilever Research. These effects may start to subside within 30-60 minutes. However, the feeling of anxiety and stress itself can last hours later, varying depending on the individual and the amount of caffeine consumed. Additionally, caffeine can be a contributing factor to acid reflux in some cases.\n\n5. Coffee And Acid Reflux\n\nCoffee consumption can influence acid reflux in coffee-sensitive individuals. Acid reflux is a condition characterized by the backward flow of stomach acid into the esophagus, causing heartburn and discomfort. So how does coffee affect acid reflux? Though it's commonly recommended to limit coffee intake for acid reflux management, the research supporting this link is inconclusive and debated.\n\nAmerican Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) advises to reduce coffee if you experience acid reflux as coffee has the effect of relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter and can allow stomach acid to reflux or flow backward into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and discomfort. However, a recent systematic review shows that the data are particularly conflicting, with multiple studies finding no evidence that coffee can cause, exacerbate, or reduce reflux-like symptoms.\n\nFor example, a 2021 meta-analysis by Neda Heidarzadeh-Esfahani from Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences found that from a total of nine studies examined, common acid reflux triggering drinks, including tea and coffee, did not increase the risk of acid reflux symptoms.\n\nOn the other hand, a small, randomized study by Barbara Polese from the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery at the University of Naples published in Nutrients Journal in 2022 demonstrated significant symptom reduction and reduced antacid use when coffee-sensitive individuals switched to a coffee with less caffeine. This suggests decaf coffee, with its minimal caffeine content, may be a good option for those with acid reflux.\n\nConversely, a large study by Raaj S Mehta from Harvard Medical School found a 34% increased risk of reflux symptoms with higher coffee intake, detailed in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2020. And that switching two daily servings of coffee with water can lower this risk. Yet, 2019 research from Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital reported no link between coffee and acid reflux after controlling for various factors.\n\n6. Coffee And GERD\n\nCoffee consumption affects GERD. GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a chronic condition characterized by persistent heartburn, acid reflux, and other uncomfortable digestive symptoms, which can worsens with coffee's acidity and caffeine. So, is drinking coffee bad for GERD? The evidence on whether coffee exacerbates GERD symptoms is inconclusive, with conflicting findings from several studies, as shown in this table.\n\nReference Finding Atta et al. (2019) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Kariri et al. (2020) Positive relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Nandurkar et al. (2004) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Bhatia et al. (2011) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Kubo et al. (2014) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Asl et al. (2015) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Eslami et al. (2017) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Alkhathami et al. (2017) Positive relationship between drinking coffee and GERD Friedenberg et al. (2010) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD López-Colombo et al. (2017) No significant relationship between drinking coffee and GERD\n\nWhat is the best coffee alternative for GERD? Some options include herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint, chicory root coffee, matcha green tea, or roasted grain beverages like barley or dandelion coffee. Malte Rubach from the German Research Center for Food Chemistry says there's ongoing research to find coffee alternatives for GERD that are gentler on the stomach, but the efficacy of coffees marketed as stomach-friendly is still uncertain. GERD disrupts digestion, causing stomach acid to interfere with nutrient absorption, like iron, in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\n7. Coffee And Iron Absorption\n\nCoffee consumption adversely affects iron absorption. Iron is a crucial mineral essential for transporting oxygen, producing energy, and supporting our immune system. If iron levels become too low, it can lead to iron deficiency anemia, causing fatigue, weakness, and other health issues. So how much does coffee interfere with iron absorption?\n\nA 2024 study by Najran University Hospital published in Biological Trace Element Research looked at how drinking coffee affects the iron levels in adults in Saudi Arabia. They found that among those who occasionally drink coffee, 54.9% had higher iron absorption, while among regular coffee drinkers, it was 45.1%.\n\nWhat about more serious problems? Can coffee cause iron deficiency? Researchers from Chonnam National University Medical School in Korea looked at how drinking coffee and green tea relates to iron levels in Korean adults. They found that men who drank less than one coffee per day had a serum ferritin level (a measure of stored iron) of about 100.7 ng/mL, while those who drank three or more coffees per day had levels around 92.2 ng/mL. Similarly, women who drank less than one coffee per day had levels around 35.6 ng/mL, compared to 28.9 ng/mL for those who drank three or more coffees per day, suggesting that regular coffee consumption may be associated with iron deficiency anemia in Korean adults.\n\nBut what if I take iron supplements? Can I drink coffee with iron pills? While you technically can drink coffee with iron pills, it's not recommended. For best results, iron supplements should be taken on an empty stomach, away from meals or coffee, according to a 2023 study by Hanna K von Siebenthal from ETH Zurich. The study measured fractional iron absorption (the proportion of ingested iron that is absorbed and utilized by the body). They found that drinking coffee decreased fractional iron absorption from iron pills (100 mg iron doses) by 54%, while drinking coffee along with breakfast further decreased absorption by 66%, even with 90 mg of ascorbic acid supplementation (note that ascorbic acid, or Vitamin C, generally helps with iron absorption).\n\nThis table provides a comparison of how does coffee affect iron absorption, comparing to different conditions and times of the day.\n\nTime of Measurement Median Iron Absorption (%) Significant Findings Morning (Baseline) 20.6 Reference absorption rate With 80 mg Vitamin C 26.7 Increased absorption compared to baseline With 500 mg Vitamin C 30.5 Highest absorption observed, significantly higher than baseline With Coffee (150 mL) 9.5 Significantly lower absorption compared to baseline With Breakfast 6.9 Lowest absorption, significantly lower than coffee Afternoon 12.9 Lower absorption than morning dose, difference nearly significant\n\nAnother older study from 1983 by Morck et al. showed that drinking coffee with meals significantly reduces iron absorption from plant-based foods – a 39% decrease when coffee follows a meal. These findings suggest that regular coffee drinkers, especially women, may need to be vigilant about iron intake and consider timing coffee consumption carefully in relation to iron-rich meals or supplements. This is particularly important during pregnancy, when iron needs are significantly increased.\n\n8. Coffee And Pregnancy\n\nDrinking too much coffee during pregnancy can be harmful, increasing the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weight, according to the National Health Service (NHS). Pregnancy is a critical period of fetal development, and it's important to understand how coffee might affect it. Caffeine from coffee quickly enters the bloodstream, reaching the fetus without being broken down. This could potentially restrict blood flow, slowing the fetus's growth (American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology).\n\nAdvice on safe caffeine consumption during pregnancy can be confusing. A 2017 study by Daniele Wikoff (Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal) suggests a maximum of 300mg daily (about three cups of coffee), while the NHS recommends a more conservative 200mg limit, as shown in this graph.\n\nHowever, some observational studies advise avoiding caffeine entirely. For example, a 2021 review by Jack E. James in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine suggests that even moderate coffee intake, equivalent to about 1-3 cups containing caffeine below 300 mg, may elevate the risk of pregnancy complications such as such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and childhood leukemia.\n\nThis aligns with a 2008 study by Xiaoping Weng from Kaiser Permanente, which found that women drinking 1-2 cups of coffee (equivalent of up to 200 mg of caffeine) daily, the risk of miscarriage was 15%, while for those consuming over two cups of brewed coffee (200 mg) daily, the risk rose to 25%. So when should a pregnant woman stop drinking coffee? Xiaoping Weng statses that \"by definition, no miscarriage occurs after 20 weeks of gestation\" so the first 20 weeks (5 months) as the most critical period.\n\nRegarding when is safe to start drinking coffee again, a 2007 study by Bodil Hammer Bech from the University of Aarhus found that reducing caffeine intake during the second half of pregnancy did not significantly affect birth weight or pregnancy length. This implies that moderate coffee consumption during this period may be safe. However, Dr. Weng advises that the decision of whether to avoid coffee (or when to stop) should be individualized, as effects can vary. Even during lactation after you give birth, consulting your doctor for personalized advice is vital.\n\n9. Coffee And Breastfeeding\n\nCoffee consumption can have impacts on breastfeeding. Breastfeeding, the process of feeding a baby directly from the mother's breasts, provides vital nutrients, antibodies, and bonding opportunities. Since caffeine consumed by the mother passes into breastmilk, it's important to understand the potential effects on the infant. Infants metabolize caffeine much more slowly than adults (approximately 100 hours, according to Jacob V. Aranda from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University). This means even moderate amounts consumed by the mother can have a significant effect.\n\nHow does coffee affect a breastfed baby? The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development notes that high caffeine intake by the mother (roughly 10 or more cups of coffee daily) can lead to increased agitation, difficulty sleeping, and changes in behavior. However, it also noted that drinking 5 cups of coffee daily had no stimulating effect on breastfed infants 3 weeks of age and older.\n\nSo how much coffee is ok for breastfeeding mother? The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) suggests that both single doses and habitual daily intakes of up to 200 mg of caffeine (equivalent to 1-2 cups of coffee) do not raise safety concerns for breastfed infants.\n\nWhen Should You Avoid Drinking Coffee?\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee before going to bed when trying to improve sleep quality, and before a stressful event, as it can increase anxiety and disrupt rest. Additionally, it's wise to skip coffee when trying to conceive, first thing in the morning, after consuming alcohol, when taking certain medications, or when trying to reduce caffeine intake.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee before bedtime as it can significantly disrupt sleep, even if consumed 6 hours before. A study at the Henry Ford Hospital and Wayne State College of Medicine by Christopher Drake and colleagues in 2013 found that 400 mg of caffeine taken 0, 3, or 6 hours before sleep notably disturbed sleep quality and duration.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee when trying to improve sleep quality because it can be counterproductive, as it disrupts normal sleep patterns. A systematic review by Clark and Landolt in Sleep Medicine Reviews Journal (2017) showed that caffeine typically prolonged sleep latency and reduced total sleep time and efficiency. Their research at the University of Zürich found dose- and timing-related effects, with caffeine reducing slow-wave sleep and increasing wakefulness, particularly affecting older adults' sleep more than younger individuals.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee before a stressful event as it can exacerbate the body's response to stress, especially in individuals unaccustomed to caffeine. A 2008 study from the University of Alberta found that drinking a regular cup of coffee, with around 140 mg of caffeine, raised heart rate by 6 beats per minute and mental alertness by 67.3%, even in those not used to caffeine. In women new to caffeine, systolic blood pressure rose by 10.3 mm Hg, showing how coffee can affect heart and alertness, especially during stressful times.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee when trying to conceive because it can be detrimental, especially at high consumption levels. Johns Hopkins University's research in the American Journal of Epidemiology revealed that non-smoking women consuming over 301 mg of caffeine daily had double the odds of delayed conception, with significantly reduced fecundability ratios, indicating caffeine's detrimental effect on fertility.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee first thing in the morning if you're prone to morning anxiety. A study involving elite judoists by Souissi and colleagues from the University of Sfax showed that caffeine ingestion in the morning increased anxiety despite improving reaction time and physical performance.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee after consuming alcohol as it can mask the depressant effects of alcohol, leading to increased consumption and risk. A 2011 study in the Journal of Caffeine and Adenosine Research by Sergi Ferré and Mary Claire O'Brien suggests that caffeine counters alcohol's sedative effects, potentially leading to increased alcohol consumption, particularly among young people, and more severe consequences.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee when taking certain medications, as it can interfere with their effectiveness, particularly in cases where alertness and cognitive function are critical. A University of Wyoming study revealed that caffeine's effects were heightened when participants anticipated stronger stimulants like Adderall, suggesting that coffee could enhance the effects of certain drugs. The 2022 trial found that caffeine intake led to increased anxiety and stimulation, potentially impacting prescribed medication regimens.\n\nYou should avoid drinking coffee when trying to reduce caffeine intake, as it counteracts the effort to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The University of Auckland study in 2020 identified 2,682 strategies for reducing caffeine, emphasizing substance substitution and avoidance as key techniques. This research indicates that continued coffee consumption can lead to sleep issues, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms like headaches and fatigue, making reduction efforts less effective.\n\nHow Does Coffee Affect Your Body Parts and Organs?\n\nCoffee can stain teeth and increase the risk of dental decay, while its acidity can irritate the stomach lining and potentially exacerbate gastrointestinal issues like heartburn. However, coffee's moderate consumption is not directly associated with negative impacts on joints, bones, or the bladder, although excessive intake may irritate the gut and exacerbate existing digestive problems.\n\nIs Drinking Coffee Bad for Your Teeth?\n\nYes, excessive coffee consumption can negatively impact dental health. A 2018 study published in the Scientific Reports journal by In-Seok Song from Korea University Anam Hospital and The Catholic University of Korea found a negative association between coffee intake and the number of remaining teeth. Daily coffee drinkers were more likely to have fewer than 20 remaining teeth, with a 69% higher risk compared to those who drank coffee less frequently. This research indicates that high coffee consumption may be a contributing factor in tooth loss among Korean adults.\n\nIs Drinking Coffee Bad for Your Stomach?\n\nNo, drinking coffee is not inherently bad for your stomach in the context of ulcers. A large-scale 2013 study from the Kameda Medical Center in Japan, involving 8,013 participants, found no significant association between coffee consumption and gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, or reflux diseases. This study, published in PLoS One, challenges the common assumption that coffee aggravates upper gastrointestinal diseases. A meta-analysis included in the research further supported the lack of a detrimental relationship between coffee intake and peptic ulcer disease.\n\nIs Drinking Coffee Bad for Your Joints?\n\nYes, drinking decaffeinated coffee may increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in certain individuals. The Iowa Women's Health Study, initiated in 1986, followed 31,336 women and found that consuming more than four cups of decaffeinated coffee per day was associated with a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, with a relative risk of 2.58. The study, led by Ted R Mikuls from the University of Alabama and published in Arthritis Rheumatology in 2002, contrasted decaffeinated coffee with tea, noting that high tea consumption appeared to reduce RA risk.\n\nIs Drinking Coffee Bad for Your Bladder?\n\nYes, coffee can be bad for your bladder, particularly for male smokers who consume high amounts. This is supported by a 1991 study by Clavel and Cordier, which found a dose-dependent increase in bladder cancer risk with coffee consumption in men. Additionally, the BLEND international study, pooling data from over half a million participants, revealed that male smokers consuming more than four cups a day had a significantly higher risk. This research, including analysis from Maastricht University, highlights the potential dangers of excessive coffee intake on bladder health in this specific demographic.\n\nWhat Are the Facts and Myths About Coffee?\n\nFacts and myths about coffee include verified information and widespread misconceptions surrounding its consumption. Supported by research from Loughborough University and the University of Zürich, facts include coffee's ability to stain teeth, its diuretic effect leading to increased urination, and its potential to stimulate bowel movements and disrupt sleep due to caffeine content. Myths, however, claim coffee can stunt growth, cause kidney stones, lead to weight gain, make you bloated, interfere with intermittent fasting, and help with hangovers. These claims lack scientific backing.\n\nDoes Coffee Stunt Your Growth?\n\nNo, there is no conclusive evidence that coffee stunts growth in children or adolescents, according to a 2020 systematic review in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Concerns about coffee and growth likely stem from its potential to slightly affect calcium absorption, but this effect is minimal and can be offset by a balanced diet rich in calcium.\n\nDoes Coffee Cause Kidney Stones?\n\nNo, drinking coffee does not cause kidney stones. A 2022 study from Sichuan University found that drinking coffee (which contains caffeine) may lower kidney stone risk by 5.32% with increased caffeine intake, suggesting higher coffee consumption reduces the chance of kidney stones.\n\nDoes Coffee Make You Gain Weight?\n\nNo, drinking black unsweetened coffee does not make you gain weight, according to a 2023 study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Research suggests that increasing unsweetened caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee intake is linked to reduced long-term weight gain (-0.12 kg per additional cup daily). However, adding sugar to coffee can lead to slight weight gain (+0.09 kg over four years), potentially counteracting coffee's weight management benefits.\n\nDoes Coffee Make You Bloated?\n\nNo, drinking coffee does not directly cause bloating, constipation, or nausea. However, a 2021 study by Glareh Koochakpoor at Tehran University of Medical Sciences showed that weekly coffee drinkers had a 44% higher chance of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), and those consuming high levels of caffeine (106.5 mg/day or more) had a 47% increased risk, especially in women and overweight individuals.\n\nDoes Coffee Break a Fast?\n\nNo, drinking black coffee on an empty stomach usually doesn't break a fast for healthy individuals, explains Anna Gavrieli, a nutritionist at Studio Diatrofis. In fact, she suggests it may even complement certain fasting methods like water fasting, extended fasting, or intermittent fasting. Her findings were published in a 2013 Randomized Controlled Trial titled \"Effect of different amounts of coffee on dietary intake and appetite of normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals\", where she noted potential benefits such as appetite suppression, improved insulin sensitivity, and weight loss.\n\nDoes Coffee Cause Diuresis?\n\nYes, coffee is a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production. This diuretic effect of coffee is most noticeable with high caffeine intake (5 or more cups at once), but regular coffee drinkers may develop a tolerance, which reduces its impact over time.\n\nDoes Coffee Help with Hangovers?\n\nNo, coffee does not effectively remove hangover symptoms. While many people drink coffee when they have a hangover, there is no evidence that it can cause, treat, or worsen headaches resulting from excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nHow Much Coffee Is Good for You?\n\nDrinking three to four cups of coffee daily offers significant health benefits, particularly in reducing the risk of neurological disorders, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, and even certain cancers, as found in a comprehensive 2017 BMJ umbrella review. The health benefits of coffee, highlighted by Robin Poole's research, include a lowered risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, with specialty coffee providing greater antioxidant activity than commercial coffee brands.\n\nHow Much Caffeine Should You Have in a Day?\n\nYou should have no more than 400 mg of caffeine (4-5 cups of coffee) if you're a healthy adult. According to current medical guidelines from the USDA, ESFA, and Health Canada, this amount of caffeine in coffee is generally not associated with adverse effects. However, individual caffeine sensitivity can vary based on other health factors, such as genetics, medication interactions, and pre-existing conditions. Switching to decaf can help manage caffeine intake while still allowing the enjoyment of coffee.\n\nIs Decaf Coffee Bad For You?\n\nNo, decaf coffee can actually be a healthy choice. It offers many of the benefits of decaf coffee, including antioxidants and a reduced risk of certain diseases, without the potential negative effects of high caffeine intake. About 10% of American adults (approximately 26 million people) enjoy decaffeinated coffee daily, demonstrating its appeal. Additionally, decaf coffee is a good option for pregnant individuals or those who want to avoid caffeine late at night.\n\nSo, how much decaf coffee is safe? A 2019 meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies (with a total of 10,103,115 participants) conducted by Q Li of Zhengzhou University suggests that consuming up to 3 cups of decaf coffee per day may help reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Please note that while decaf is generally considered safe, those with specific health concerns should always consult with their doctor before making changes to their diet.\n\nWhat Is the Healthiest Decaf Coffee?"
