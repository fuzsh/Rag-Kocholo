The aim of this study is to investigate long-term treatment patterns and adherence to LLD following hospitalization for a CHD event. Methods Patients admitted to two Norwegian hospitals with a CHD event from 2011-2014 (N=1094) attended clinical examination and completed a questionnaire, median 16 months later. Clinical data were linked to pharmacy dispensing data from 2010-2020. The proportions using high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40/80 mg or rosuvastatin 20/40 mg) and non-statin LLD after the CHD event were assessed. Adherence was evaluated by proportion of days covered (PDC) and gaps in treatment. Results Median age at hospitalization was 63 (IQR 12) years, 21% were female. Altogether, 1054 patients (96%) were discharged with a statin prescription, while treatment was dispensed in 85% within the following 90 days. During median 8 (SD 2.5) years follow-up, the proportion using high-intensity statin therapy ranged 62-68%, whereas the use of ezetimibe increased from 4-26 %. PDC <0.8 was found in 22% of statin users and 26% of ezetimibe users. The proportions with a treatment gap exceeding 180 days were 22% for statins and 28% for ezetimibe. Smoking at hospitalization and negative affectivity were significantly associated with reduced statin adherence, regardless of adherence measure. Conclusions In this long-term follow-up of patients with CHD, less than 70% used high-intensity statin therapy with only small changes over time, and only 25% used additional treatment with ezetimibe. We identified factors associated with reduced statin adherence that may be target for interventions.\n\nShow summary\n\nAims Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The AF is associated with severe mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs, and guidelines recommend screening people at risk. However, screening methods and organization still need to be clarified. The current study aimed to assess the feasibility of a fully digital self-screening procedure and to assess the prevalence of undetected AF using a continuous patch electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system. Methods and results Individuals ≥65 years old with at least one additional risk factor for stroke from the general population of Norway were invited to a fully digital continuous self-screening for AF using a patch ECG device (ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor). Participants self-reported clinical characteristics and usability online, and all participants received digital feedback of their results. A total of 2118 individuals with a mean CHA2DS2-VASc risk score of 2.6 (0.9) were enrolled in the study [74% women; mean age 70.1 years (4.2)]. Of these, 1849 (87.3%) participants completed the ECG self-screening test, while 215 (10.2%) did not try to start the test and 54 (2.5%) failed to start the test. The system usability score was 84.5. The mean ECG monitoring time was 153 h (87). Atrial fibrillation was detected in 41 (2.2%) individuals. Conclusion This fully digitalized self-screening procedure for AF demonstrated excellent feasibility. The number needed to screen was 45 to detect one unrecognized case of AF in subjects at risk for stroke. Randomized studies with long-term follow-up are needed to assess whether self-screening for AF can reduce the incidence of AF-related complications\n\nShow summary\n\nObjective Compare survival in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a pharmacoinvasive (PI) or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) strategy based on estimated time to PCI. Design Prospective observational cohort study. Consecutive STEMI patients were registered on admission to our PCI centre and classified in a PI or pPCI group, based on the reperfusion strategy chosen in the prehospital or local hospital location. Time and cause of death was provided by the Norwegian Cause of Death registry. Mortality at 30 days, Kaplan-Meier survival and incidence of cardiovascular (CV) death was estimated. Adjusted effect of PI versus pPCI strategy on survival was estimated using logistic and Cox regression and propensity score weighting. Setting Single-centre registry in Norway during 2005–2011, within a regional STEMI network allocating patients to a PI strategy if estimated time to PCI >120 min. Primary outcomes 30-day mortality and survival during follow-up. Secondary outcome Incidence of CV death during follow-up. Results 4061 STEMI patients <80 years were included, 527 (13%) treated with a PI strategy and 3534 (87%) with a pPCI strategy. Median symptom-to-needle time was 110 min (25–75th percentile 75–163) in the PI group vs symptom-to-balloon 230 min (149–435) in the pPCI group. 30-day mortality was 3.2% and 5.0% in the PI and pPCI groups (ORadjusted0.58 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.13)) and 8-year survival was 85.9% (95% CI 80.9% to 89.6%) and 79.3% (95% CI 76.9% to 81.6%), respectively (HRadjusted 0.72 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.99)). Unadjusted incidence of 8-year CV death was 7.0% (95% CI 4.4% to 10.4%) in the PI group vs 12.4% (95% CI 9.9% to 15.2%) in the pPCI group. Adjusted long-term CV death was also lower in the PI group. Conclusion STEMI patients treated with a PI strategy experienced better survival compared with a pPCI strategy, also when adjusting for baseline characteristics. This supports using a PI strategy for eligible STEMI patients when pPCI cannot be performed within 120 min.\n\nShow summary\n\nAims: Hospital admissions of patients with chest pain considered as low risk for acute coronary syndrome contribute to increased costs and crowding in the emergency departments. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of assessing these patients in a primary care emergency setting, using the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1-h algorithm for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, compared to routine hospital management. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. For the primary care estimates, costs and health care expenditure from the observational OUT-ACS (One-hoUr Troponin in a low-prevalence population of Acute Coronary Syndrome) study were compared with anonymous extracted administrative data on low-risk patients at a large general hospital in Norway. Patients discharged home after the hs-cTnT assessment were defined as low risk in the primary care cohort. In the hospital setting, the low-risk group comprised patients discharged with a non-specific chest pain diagnosis (ICD-10 codes R07.4 and Z03.5). Loss of health related to a potential increase in acute myocardial infarctions the following 30-days was estimated. The primary outcome measure was the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of applying the ESC 0/1-h algorithm in primary care. The secondary outcomes were health care costs and length of stay in the two settings. Results: Differences in costs comprise personnel and laboratory costs of applying the algorithm at primary care level (€192) and expenses related to ambulance transports and complete hospital costs for low-risk patients admitted to hospital (€1986). Additional diagnostic procedures were performed in 31.9% (181/567) of the low-risk hospital cohort. The estimated reduction in health care cost when using the 0/1-h algorithm outside of hospital was €1794 per low-risk patient, with a mean decrease in length of stay of 18.9 h. These numbers result in an average per-person QALY gain of 0.0005. Increased QALY and decreased costs indicate that the primary care approach is clearly cost-effective. Conclusion: Using the ESC 0/1-h algorithm in low-risk patients in emergency primary care appears to be cost-effective compared to standard hospital management, with an extensive reduction in costs and length of stay per patient.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground. Heart rhythm disorders, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), are increasing global health challenges. Conventional diagnostic tools for assessment of rhythm disorders suffer from limited availability, limited test duration time, and usability challenges. There is also a need for out-of-hospital investigation of arrhythmias. Therefore, the Norwegian ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor has been developed to simplify the assessment of heart rhythm disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and usability of the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor compared to conventional Holter monitors. Methods. Parallel tests with ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor and a Holter monitor were performed in 151 consecutive patients referred for out-of-hospital long-term ECG recording at Sorlandet Hospital Arendal, Norway. All ECG data were automatically analysed by both systems and evaluated by hospital physicians. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire scoring usability parameters after the test. Results. A total of 150 patients (62% men, age 54 (±17) years) completed the study. The ECG quality from both monitors was considered satisfactory for rhythm analysis in all patients. AF was identified in 9 (6%) patients during the period with parallel tests. The diagnostic accuracy for automatic AF detection was 95% (95% CI 91–98) for the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor and 81% (95% CI 74–87) for the Holter system. The proportion of false-positive AF was 4% in tests analysed by the ECG247 algorithm and 16% in tests analysed by the Holter algorithm. Other arrhythmias were absent/rare. The system usability score was significantly better for ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor compared to traditional Holter technology (score 87.4 vs. 67.5, ). Conclusions. The ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor showed at least comparable diagnostic accuracy for AF and improved usability compared to conventional Holter technology. ECG247 allows for prolonged monitoring and may improve detection of AF.

The protocol was developed for a specific invasive cardiac procedure performed transvenously with local anaesthesia: cardiac implantable electronic device lead extraction. The music listening intervention presented in the protocol aims to optimise stress and pain management for patients through patient involvement, communication, individualised music listening and relaxation techniques. The Music Therapist remains present throughout the peri-operative phase (in the operating theatre during the operation). The music is chosen from a limited set of prepared playlists through a process involving assessment and patient preference. Biological, psychological and social components are integrated into the protocol, which is also informed by the theory of music therapy as procedural support, the neuromatrix theory of pain and receptive music therapy techniques. The protocol was developed to be standardised for implementation into the existing medical procedure, yet flexible enough to meet individual patient needs. It is the cornerstone of the research protocol of an ongoing randomised controlled trial at the Department of Cardiology at Oslo University Hospital Ulleval. Results of the randomised controlled trial, focussing on quantitative efficacy outcomes, are expected in 2020.\n\nShow summary\n\nObjectives To describe the prevalence and trajectory of family caregivers’ post-traumatic stress symptoms during the first year after a patient’s admission to the intensive care unit and identify associations between family caregivers’ background characteristics, hope and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Research methodology/designs Family caregivers of intensive care unit patients (n = 211) completed questionnaires at patient admission to the intensive care unit and thereafter at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Mixed-model analyses were performed. Setting Four intensive care units in a university hospital in Norway. Main outcome measures Impact of Event Scale—Revised and Herth Hope Index. Results On admission, 54% of family caregivers reported high post-traumatic stress symptom levels, which decreased during the first six months after patient discharge. Lower levels of hope, being younger, having more comorbidities and being on sick leave were associated with higher post-traumatic stress symptom levels. Being the parent of the patient was associated with decreased post-traumatic stress symptom levels. Conclusions Family caregivers of intensive care unit patients report high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Higher levels of hope were associated with fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms.

Methods: Using nationwide registries (Norwegian Patient Registry and Norwegian Prescription Database), we identified AF patients with a first prescription of oral anticoagulants between January 2013 and June 2015. Patients were followed until discontinuation or switching of oral anticoagulants, death, or end of follow-up. The primary endpoint was major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding. Results: In total 32 675 AF patients were identified (58% men, median age 74 years): 11 427 patients used warfarin, 7925 dabigatran, 6817 rivaroxaban, and 6506 apixaban. After a median follow-up of 173 days (25th, 75th percentile 84, 340), 2081 (6.37%) patients experienced a first major or CRNM bleeding. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for baseline characteristics, use of apixaban [hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.80, P < 0.001] and dabigatran (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.84, P < 0.001) were associated with a lower risk of major or CRNM bleeding compared with warfarin whereas use of rivaroxaban was not (HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.94–1.17, P = 0.400). Use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban were associated with higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas use of apixaban and dabigatran were associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding, compared with warfarin. Conclusion: In this nationwide cohort study in AF patients, apixaban and dabigatran were associated with a lower risk of major or CRNM bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with rivaroxaban and dabigatran compared with warfarin.\n\nShow summary\n\nAim: We aimed to study in-hospital mortality and long-term survival in elderly compared to younger patients with STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the era of primary angioplasty. Methods and results: This was a prospective cohort study. All consecutive STEMI-patients admitted to our hospital between September 2005–December 2011 were included in a local registry. Predefined variables were registered during hospital admission. Vital status was obtained from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry with censoring date 31 December 2011. Adjusted effects of age ⩾80 years on in-hospital- and long-term mortality were determined using propensity score analysis. Of 4525 registered STEMI patients, 600 (13%) were octogenarians or older. In-hospital mortality was 17% in patients ⩾80 years and 4% in patients <80 years. In invasively treated patients (83% of patients ⩾80 years; 98% of patients <80 years), in-hospital mortality was 13% and 3.4%, respectively. Median follow-up time was 2.5 years. Three-year cumulative survival was 52% in patients ⩾80 years vs 89% in patients <80 years. In invasively treated patients ⩾80 years, three-year survival was 58%. The adjusted odds ratio of in-hospital mortality was 2.61 (1.94–3.52) and adjusted incidence rate ratio of long-term mortality was 4.07 (3.43–4.84) in very elderly compared to younger patients. Conclusion: Short-term prognosis was acceptable in very elderly STEMI patients, especially in the invasively treated subgroup. However, only 52% of STEMI patients ⩾80 years were alive after three years of follow-up. Very elderly patients had 2.6 times higher risk of in-hospital mortality and 4.1 times the risk of not surviving during long-term followup compared to patients <80 years, after adjustment for confounding factors and selection bias.\n\nShow summary\n\nBACKGROUND: Adaptation of guidelines for use at the national or local level can facilitate their implementation. We developed and evaluated an adaptation process in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, aiming for efficiency and transparency. This article is the first in a series describing our adaptation of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for a Norwegian setting. METHODS: Informed by the ADAPTE framework, we developed a five-step adaptation process customized to guidelines developed using GRADE: (1) planning, (2) initial assessment of the recommendations, (3) modification, (4) publication, and (5) evaluation. We developed a taxonomy for describing how and why recommendations from the parent guideline were modified and applied a mixed-methods case study design for evaluation of the process. RESULTS: We published the adapted guideline in November 2013 in a novel multilayered format. The taxonomy for adaptation facilitated transparency of the modification process for both the guideline developers and the end users. We excluded 30 and modified 131 of the 333 original recommendations according to the taxonomy and developed eight new recommendations. Unforeseen obstacles related to acquiring a licensing agreement and procuring a publisher resulted in a 9-month delay. We propose modifications of the adaptation process to overcome these obstacles in the future. CONCLUSIONS: This case study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel guideline adaptation process. Replication is needed to further validate the usefulness of the process in increasing the organizational and methodologic efficiency of guideline adaptation.\n\nShow summary\n\nBACKGROUND: The Antithrombotic Therapy and the Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th Edition: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (AT9) represent trustworthy international guidelines for antithrombotic treatment and thromboprophylaxis. We describe major changes to the format and content resulting from applying new strategies for guideline adaptation and dissemination. METHODS: A Norwegian guideline panel of 46 experts completed a structured and systematic adaptation process, updated the recommendations based on new evidence, and rewrote the recommendations in an electronic multilayered presentation format. We published the adapted guideline using the web-based Making GRADE the Irresistible Choice Guideline Authoring and Publication Platform. RESULTS: We applied a novel presentation format to 333 recommendations from 11 of the 15 management chapters in AT9 and condensed and restructured them into 249 recommendations in a multilayered format. We added additional relevant information, such as 29 best-practice statements about new oral anticoagulants and practical information sections for 121 recommendations. Common reasons for modifications included feasibility of the recommendations in a national context, disagreement with applied baseline risk estimates, and reevaluation of the balance between the benefits and harms of interventions in relation to assumed typical patient preferences and values. The adapted guideline was published and disseminated online in November 2013. CONCLUSIONS: New strategies for adapting, updating, and disseminating trustworthy guidelines proved feasible and will provide Norwegian health-care professionals and patients with up-to-date guidance tailored to national circumstances.\n\nShow summary\n\nOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare a strategy of immediate transfer for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with an ischemia-guided approach after thrombolysis in patients with very long transfer distances to PCI. BACKGROUND: Thrombolysis remains the treatment of choice in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when primary PCI cannot be performed within 90 to 120 min. The optimal treatment after thrombolysis is still unclear. METHODS: A total of 266 patients with acute STEMI living in rural areas with more than 90-min transfer delays to PCI were treated with tenecteplase, aspirin, enoxaparin, and clopidogrel and randomized to immediate transfer for PCI or to standard management in the local hospitals with early transfer, only if indicated for rescue or clinical deterioration. The primary outcome was a composite of death, reinfarction, stroke, or new ischemia at 12 months, and analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: The primary end point was reached in 28 patients (21%) in the early invasive group compared with 36 (27%) in the conservative group (hazard ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 1.18, p = 0.19). The composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke at 12 months was significantly reduced in the early invasive compared with the conservative group (6% vs. 16%, hazard ratio: 0.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.16 to 0.81, p = 0.01). No significant differences in bleeding or infarct size were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate transfer for PCI did not improve the primary outcome significantly, but reduced the rate of death, reinfarction, or stroke at 12 months in patients with STEMI, treated with thrombolysis and clopidogrel in areas with long transfer distances.

Thereafter, the supernatant containing fibrin degradation products was removed and incubated with HNE. D-dimer levels were measured by two rapid semiquantitative tests, a latex agglutination test and the Nycocard immunofiltration test, and a quantitative ELISA-method. With increasing incubation time, D-dimer levels as measured by the latex and Nycocard tests rapidly decreased and subsequently became undetectable, while the ELISA D-dimer values remained essentially unchanged. By using SDS-electrophoresis and immunoblotting, the degradation of plasmic derivatives of cross-linked fibrin by HNE was visualised. We conclude that in a purified system, D-dimers formed during plasmin mediated lysis of cross linked fibrin are further degraded by HNE. Such HNE degradation reduces the D-dimer concentration as measured by rapid semiquantitive tests, and may be partly responsible for discrepant results when using different D-dimer assays.\n\nShow summary\n\nThe recent proposal of lowering the decision level of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (Eur.Heart J,2000;21:1502-13) has made it more important to know the incidence of increased cTnT due to other diseases than acute coronary syndromes (ACS). On this purpose we selected from the hospital databases 3461 in-hospital patients in whom cTnT had been determined in year 2000, along with the respective cTnT results and the diagnoses given these patients on discharge. Only one diagnosis was used on each patient. These diagnoses were selected on the basis of their ICD-10 codes in a priority order favouring those diseases that are known most often to cause increased cTnT, starting with the codes for acute myocardial infarct. In the group of patients (no 2319) with cTnT < 0.03 mg/L, 4.6% were considered having ACS. In the group with cTnT ³ 0.03 (no 1142), cTnT ³ 0.10 (no 688), or cTnT ³ 0.20, the percentages were 35%, 52% and 60%, respectively. Forty four percent of patients with cTnT ³ 0.03, 35% with cTnT ³ 0.10, and 30% with cTnT ³ 0.20 mg/L had other heart diseases, particularly congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation unspecified (stable) angina pectoris or precordial pain of unknown cause. Of the remaining patients with no heart diagnoses, those with renal diseases, sepsis, pulmonary embolism and several other respiratory diagnoses had more often cTnT above 0.03 than others. Most of the 22 patients with myocardial infarction and cTnT less than 0.03 had been referred from other hospitals several days after onset of symptoms for angiography. In conclusion, although cTnT is heart specific, it is not specific for ACS. A lowering of the decision level will markedly increase the incidence of patients with increased cTnT due to other reasons than ACS."
