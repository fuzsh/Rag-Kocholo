From the creator of Let the Right One In.\n\nOn a day of unusual heat, three different families have discovered a strange secret–their loved ones, recently dead, have returned. And they don’t know what to do–these are not mindless zombies but something entirely different. But what exactly? Co-written by director Thea Hvistendahl and author John Ajvide Lindqvist, whose Let the Right One In reinvented the vampire story, and with acclaimed actress Renate Reinsve (The Worst Person in the World), Handling the Dead is a haunting story of grief and endurance."
