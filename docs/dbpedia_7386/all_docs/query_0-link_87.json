        "text": "Stage 6: København - København, 142km\n\nGPM:\n\nHundeskoven (Geels Bakke)(575m @ 3,7%)\n\nIt has probably come to your attention that when I do race routes I like to pay a bit of tribute to the history of the sport - honouring hometowns of legendary riders or pioneering achievers, stopping off at velodromes and locations that have hosted historic races, and so on. You know, things like the Sachsenring stage of my tour of the former DDR, Nürburgring, the Montello circuit in my Giro Rosa, the stage starts and finishes in hometowns of legends, the TT stage in Pamplona in one of my Vueltas and in Yffiniac in one of my Tours, the stages in all the 1909 Giro host towns in my Race Design Challenge Giro, the Brno circuit in my Course de la Paix, and so on. Old championship courses and finish lines are perhaps third in my race design tropes, after rider hometowns and, of course, Nordic ski stations.\n\nHere, there is no Nordic skiing to honour, but I’ve managed to combine the other two. And perhaps not in a way that might have been expected.\n\nNow, obviously Copenhagen was going to find its way onto the route. It’s the capital city of Denmark, and its centre for culture, history and everything else. There’s far from enough room or time for me to elucidate all of its cultural sites or its famous sons and daughters. It is one of the jewels of the Nordic world and a worthy city break of its own (especially if, like me, you drink coffee like it’s going out of fashion). Closing the city centre of Copenhagen for an entire day would obviously be difficult, but not impossible; some one-day races have managed to get major cities to host, though typically appended to men’s races, such as the Champs Elysées version of La Course, or the insulting and pathetic RideLondon crit that the women get to do in lieu of a proper race, which is my biggest criticism of the British cycling revolution - the Tour of Yorkshire and the Women’s Tour have been great, promoting the women’s race and giving them TV time, but the organisers of the London legacy event have dropped the ball big time, palming the women off with an hour around a city park while Joe Public gets to do the proper course. Stage races have managed it on occasion though - the Women’s Tour had a London city centre crit in 2017, which in what can only be described as “not much of a shock” a bunch sprint ensued, and Christine Majerus and Hannah Barnes failed in their somewhat obviously doomed bid to take over a minute’s worth out of Kasia Niewiadoma’s advantage in the GC; the Giro Rosa, or Donne as it was back then, started with a Grand Départ in Rome in 2011, and had an ITT in the city in 2012; the Emakumeen Bira had a stage in Bilbao in 2007; the Giro della Campania - a .NE race! - had a stage finish in Naples, and the Giro Rosa had two stages in Ljubljana in 2015. But while this is technically a Copenhagen to Copenhagen stage, it isn’t quiet.\n\nThe first 40km of this stage, in fact, are an out and back around some of the Copenhagen suburbs, so leaving the centre only to return a bit later. We take in two suburbs in particular. Firstly, Kastrup, famous for the national aquarium and as the part of town which contains national - and international - transport hub Copenhagen Airport - though we don’t go too near the airport itself. And also we’ll be gone from there by the time any TV coverage (I beseech DR to broadcast this - when I visited Copenhagen in late 2016, I went into a bike shop near the Rundetaarn to find that Dideriksen’s victory in Doha was being broadcast on a loop there, and customers in the shop were still stopping to watch even weeks after the event) begins so it won’t matter. And secondly, Frederiksberg, a slightly unusual municipality in that it is independent of Copenhagen municipality, but has been swallowed by it while retaining its independence, so it’s an enclave within Copenhagen, rather like an urban municipality version of Lesotho. It nevertheless houses a number of Copenhagen’s attractions, such as the zoo, which has a yin-yang shaped panda enclosure but has sparked controversy in the past after publicly killing a healthy giraffe to limit inbreeding, then feeding its remains to the zoo’s lions. Frederiksberg was initially set up as a separate farming community which burnt down in the late 17th century, being rebuilt as a merchant community around a new palace built by Frederik IV, hence the name Frederiksberg.\n\nThe city rapidly expanded in the mid-19th century after a repeal of an old parliamentary restriction on constructions outside Copenhagen’s city walls, perhaps recognising that the city was no longer in the same level of danger that it had been in previous centuries. Frederiksberg was one of the main beneficiaries of this, especially as the city metro and public transport systems expanded, meaning it became an affluent middle class neighbourhood, although there are some other sectors of general high rise living - most notably Domus Vista, a 30-storey, 100m behemoth apartment block. It is also the traditional finish of the men’s Danmark Rundt, where a sprint finish usually ensues on Frederikesberg Alle - winners of which have included Jaan Kirsipuu (2000, 2001, 2003), former lanterns rouge Jimmy Casper (2004), André Greipel (2005), Mark Cavendish (2007, 2012, 2013), Theo Bos (2011) and Michael Mørkøv (2015). The only exception in recent years has been 2017, when the race started rather than finished in the city.\n\nChildren of Frederiksberg number many, for obvious reasons, and include children’s writer and translator Erik Christian Haugaard, responsible for bringing many of Hans Christian Andersen’s tales to a wider audience, Carl Theodor Dreyer, the legendary film director, Sofie Gråbøl, the actress whose career exploded beyond Scandinavia with the international success of Forbrydelsen (mentioned in an earlier stage thanks to Gråbøl’s co-star Søren Malling) leading to roles in shows such as Fortitude; footballers Finn (father) and Michael (son) Laudrup (but not Michael’s brother Brian, who was born in Vienna after Finn was transferred there in 1968) - with the younger Laudrups being essential to Denmark’s shock Euro 1992 victory, and Per Lyngemark, part of the 1968 gold medal winning Team Pursuit (which the aforementioned Ole Ritter could not participate in, as a professional, despite being on hand as he had just set his Hour Record).\n\nBut despite all of the history and tradition etc. etc., there is a much more simple reason why these two cities are on the route: their residents deserve the right to cheer their local heroes. Amalie Dideriksen is from Kastrup, and Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig is from Frederiksberg.\n\n(Yes, that picture’s from Doha, so Julie is there too, but since we started in her hometown, and it’s not achievable within a single stage’s distance from Copenhagen, it’s ok, since her local fanbase will have already had the chance to cheer her on)\n\nSo, once we’ve done our loop around the suburbs we arrive back in the middle of Copenhagen. Is it a good time for the Scott Walker song? Of course it is! It’s always a good time for Scott Walker. What a legend, may he rest in peace. Anyway, we have a whistle-stop tour of the Danish capital’s sights, arriving back in town via the Central Train Station, and passing arguably Denmark’s most famous landmark of all, the Tivoli Gardens.\n\nOf course, Legoland can claim the throne, so it’s a debatable one. And there is another, much less active, landmark which we pass later which is also a contender. We go past City Hall, the National Museum of Denmark, Christiansborg Slot - the seat of the Danish Parliament and the Danish Supreme Court, as well as being partially used by the Royal House - a dramatic synthesis of the executive, legislative and judicial branches seldom seen in the west. It was the main residence of the Danish kings and queens until the end of the 18th Century, then from the mid-19th as parliament. It has been burnt down and rebuilt twice, most recently in 1884. In addition to housing both government and royal family, it is also partially open to the public as well - not something security would permit in a lot of countries, I’d wager!!! Holmens Kirke is our next landmark, before an intermediate sprint at Kongens Nytorv, or “The King’s New Square”, a colossal transport interchange and central square that serves as a meeting place for old and new.\n\nCharlottenborg Slot is located on this square, and then there is a long - cobbled - straight, which goes past Amalienborg Palace, Christian VIII’s residence, which also shows the Opera House in the background. The palace was, of course, previously just called “Royal Palace” before being renamed in honour of Amalie Dideriksen’s rainbow jersey victory. We then follow the coastal road encircling the old fortifications of Kastellet København, whereupon we meet Hans Christian Andersen’s most famous creation, Den Lille Havfrue, translated as The Little Mermaid. Andersen’s fairytale reached international renown and a statue of the Havfrue was commissioned in the early 20th Century, and despite an unimposing size and stature - being at ground level and just off the waterside on the Langelinie promenade and being just 125cm in height - it has grown to become the emblem of Copenhagen and of Denmark in general, in much the same way as the small and unimposing Manneken Pis is the enduring image of Brussels. Den Lille Havfrue has been defaced, damaged, repainted, vandalised and even decapitated, but remains iconic to the last.\n\nThe cultural part of the stage thusly dispensed with, we head north into the suburb of Hellerup, home of the Tuborg brewery, and Gentofte with its famous lake. After heading through Lyngby you probably guessed it: we’re headed to the 2011 World Championships circuit.\n\n“Why would you do this, Libertine?” I hear you ask. “Those 2011 World Championships were absolutely horrible, and exhibit A in the case for the prosecution by those idiots still bringing the case that “women’s cycling is boring!” Why would you give them the ammunition?”\n\nThat is, in fact, a good question.\n\nCopenhagen has hosted the World Championships a number of times, in fact, going all the way back to 1921 and the first ever UCI Road World Championships. Six times, the championships have been held in the city, but only once did the women get to contest a race there, as the previous five predated the inception of the women’s World Championships Road Race. Likewise, the city hosted the UCI Track World Championships on 9 occasions, but all before the women were allowed to compete; since they have been able to enter, Denmark has twice hosted the Worlds, but this has been after the national centre has moved to Ballerup, half an hour west of the city. So this is the only route we have any women’s event historical data to go off. And yes, that historical data is one race, which was horrible. So horrible as to, despite a sample size of 1, be statistically significant. I was greatly upset by this race; not because of anything that was realistically the fault of the athletes, but simply that after all was said and done, the one time the women got to show their faces on worldwide TV and, with it being the Worlds and all, people who wouldn’t go out of their way to watch women’s races were watching… the spectacle was absolutely awful. The course was un-selective, the weather didn’t play ball to create any wildcard element, and to say racing was tepid is to be kind, as for the first half of the race we didn’t even get any speculative moves; just a group ride.\n\nThings did, eventually, get better (Clara Hughes did at least take up the completely thankless task of trying to hold off the péloton on a completely flat circuit, hoping to ‘do an Ottenbros’), but due to some pretty poor showings by the organisers (placing the feed zone on the most potentially selective climb of the course was the most egregious sin) there really was no outcome other than a sprint that was likely; Lucinda Brand was literally the only DNF from an established nation, and 95 people fought out a slightly uphill sprint which was won by defending champion Giorgia Bronzini, marking Marianne Vos’ incredible fifth straight silver medal at the Worlds. The slightly uphill nature of the sprint helped them out ahead of German veteran Ina-Yoko Teutenberg, who took bronze ahead of Nicole Cooke, whose words on this race have been very interesting in the long run - the women being left to their own devices, no training plan, no tactical advice, no nothing; only for either on the eve of the race or the morning of the race (I forget the details) an edict to come from on high that they were riding for Armitstead (who at that point was very much BC’s golden girl, as they’d had their fill of Cooke and to a lesser extent Pooley by that time), contrary to the plans they already had; an impromptu post-race meeting was then enforced upon the women by the coaches, in Nicole Cooke’s bedroom, where the former World - and reigning Olympic - champion was blamed in no uncertain terms for the fact no medals were had - despite, at that point in her career and on that particular course, it being unlikely that the still pretty inexperienced Armitstead would have done any better than Cooke eventually managed.\n\nNow, however, eight years have passed. A lot of those riders are now retired, and those that aren’t, bar only a small number, are very different riders from the ones they were back then, whether significantly better for the years of experience (Amialiusik, Moolman-Pasio, Fahlin, Longo Borghini) or significantly worse for being past peak years (Zabelinskaya, Vysotska, Worrack, Neben). A few are still stars - Vos, van Vleuten, Deignan/Armitstead - but they are in the minority. Bronzini’s retired, recently, but several others there are long gone - Teutenberg, Martisova and Nøstvold retired in 2013, Cooke, Arndt, Iturriagaechevarria and Henrion in 2012, Whitelaw in 2011, Bubnenkova, de Vocht and Verbeke in 2014, Johansson, Stevens and Olds in 2016, and Pooley in both 2014 AND 2016.\n\nPerhaps more interesting to look at, therefore, is the Junior Women’s Road Race. Not only was it a much less crappy race, thanks to a few counter attacks and, due to inexperience (and potentially tactical naïveté, always a possibility at this level) and/or being unused to trickier races, it broke up a bit more. Thalita de Jong was a solo break of the day, and people like Drexel and Confalonieri got into counter moves. You had people like Rossella Ratto trying to go away solo 60km from home on an almost pan-flat course (Rossella, I’m a big mark for you, but let’s be honest, that was never in a million years going to work), Mieke Kröger countering to join her, then them having trouble cooperating because Ratto is a good climber and Kröger goes uphill like water, but Kröger is a great time triallist and Ratto is not competitive against her as a flat engine. I’m not going to say it was a good race, but the catch was made late, and you had the problem that neither Kröger NOR Ratto really fancied a sprint, but the bunch didn’t have many expendable domestiques, meaning it was a bit more tense as to whether they’d be caught or not, before that final slight uphill killed their momentum and we saw a sprint which was won by Lucy Garner for the British team in a very authoritative sprint, ahead of Jessy Druyts, the 2nd of the Druyts siblings at Topsport (younger than Kelly, older than Demmy and Lenny), and home favourite Christina Siggaard.\n\nThis race is perhaps a better guide to what we can expect, as there are a number of riders who are in the modern péloton to act as frames of reference, seeing as, you know, 8 years on, these junior riders are the bulk of the current crowd. Garner is now with Hitec after a few years blighted with injury at Wiggle, so she would likely be here, the Norwegian team very likely to want to be a part of a Scandinavian stage race; Siggaard is with Virtu and almost a lock. Christina Perchtold in 5th was with Bigla for a year and is now racing in Belgium; the startlist also included Sheyla Gutiérrez, Rossella Ratto, Ingrid Drexel, Gabrielle Pilote-Fortin, Anouska Koster, Katarzyna Niewiadoma, Maria Giulia Confalonieri, Loudes Oyarbide, Thalita de Jong, Ksenia Dobrynina, Alexis Ryan, Mieke Kröger, Hannah Barnes, Elinor Barker, Dalia Muccioli, Thi That Nguyen and Georgia Williams.\n\nRoute of the circuit for the 2011 World Championships. We do 6 laps of this 14km loop\n\nAs well as the map there, we have this 3d video to display the course as it appears. Though of course, if you’re a glutton for punishment and you like watching relentless flat races you could try and watch the videos I’ve posted in full. The highlights of the women’s elite race are mercifully short, but the junior race shows an hour of racing, which tells you how much more entertaining a race it was. Now: was that the fault of the race organisers? Only partially. Let’s face it: Copenhagen is a pretty flat place. Denmark in general is a fairly flat place, and this course of mine is about as hilly a Danish race as you could make without being completely unbalanced (there are other hilly stages you could make around, say, Aabenraa, or on Bornholm, but I already have two HTFs and a Vejle stage, let’s be realistic about this, a Danish race should be predominantly flat to be a realistically representative Tour of Denmark), and it’s not like the parcours presented by the Copenhagen 2011 bid team was totally flat; this is the profile.\n\nHowever, they didn’t help themselves. Placing the feed zone in the middle of one of those climbs was a colossal error that helped negate what few options there were for non-sprinters, as well as the fact that there were a group of minor obstacles bunched together at one end of the circuit - but then a long and mostly very straight run back to the final start/finish that was on wide open roads and made it easy for the chase negated the possibilities for an attack to stick; the final uphill was interesting enough to make it a challenging sprint, but not enough to tempt any puncheurs to give it a go. After all, Geels Bakke, the climb from the intersection of Skodsborgvej and Kongevejen to the finishing line, is just under 600m at 3,7% - nothing like long enough to make this one of those Vuelta/Volta a Portugal drag sprints into hilltop towns but not on a punchy climb (think the stage Matthews won in 2014 in Arcos de la Frontera), but not steep enough to create something that’s unclear between types of sprinter and puncher (think the Tour stage Sagan won in 2012 in Boulogne-sur-Mer). The below image makes it look pretty steep, but the camera angle rather exaggerates it, a bit like the slightly angled cam which made Monte Crostis look like riders would be cambered down vertical drops to oblivion in the wake of Wouter Weylandt’s fatal accident.\n\nThe other “real” climb on the circuit is Søllerød Slotsvej, which is 370m at 6,5%. Again, we are a long way from something that will be decisive - I’ve already said I think time gaps will be minimal on Rebild Bakke, and that is similar to this but three times as long - but it’s at least a platform from which to attack. I expect this stage will be a sprint, but it really will depend on what the GC looks like. Especially as we have a few factors to take into consideration that they did not have in 2011.\n\nFirstly, this is not a one-day race; what matters is not simply to come first, but to complete the course in the fastest possible time. So you may have riders who do not have to win but need to win by a fixed amount of time. Therefore you will also have riders who do not care about losing, because they are irrelevant to the GC. They can take the form of either riders who simply want to get to the end so won’t contribute to chases, making attacks potentially more likely to be decisive than in a one-day race when everybody has something to gain and something to lose, but also, if their team has nothing from the race at this point, they could be potential wildcards or agitants - attacking for the stage, or doing deals with potential GC candidates to take stage wins in return for GC victory assistance, and so on.\n\nSecondly, I am not putting the feed zone at the top of the climb. Well, I am, but the riders only see it once, with over 70km to go. Apart from that, it’s free for all. Mountain points will be given out on the fourth passage of the finishing line (so after three circuits of six); intermediate sprints - and importantly, the bonus seconds that they provide - will be given out at the third and fifth, so after two and four laps. If the race is as tight as I hope it is, this could be vital. I anticipate the single GPM points will not be decisive given there were 16 summits in the Vejle stage, but you never know.\n\nThirdly, the 142km distance is actually slightly longer than the World Championships road race in 2011. As the women’s péloton becomes increasingly professional, we are seeing ever more lengthy races, to the point where, as the men see a tendency toward shorter races, we may actually see parity at some point in the not too distant future (whether that be desirable, such as in athletics, or whether that not be the case because of length of competition being preferred as a factor rather than distance covered, like in XC skiing, is a decision for that future). At that point, the maximum distance average in a stage race was 100km; now it is 130km, which is much fairer as a comparison point to the 180km average for the men (and even then, it can sometimes be broken, the Tour of Yorkshire just consisted of two stages which were 132km each). Races like de Ronde are creeping up towards 160km now. However, 140km in a standalone race vs. 140km on the final day of a six day stage race is likely to be very different from a fatigue point of view.\n\nFourthly: as Óscar Freire once said, “in order to win, first you must be prepared to lose”. I’m sure he got it from somewhere. Sun Tzu or somebody like that. In the World Championships, more people are afraid to lose. In a smaller race, there is less to lose, so less fear of losing. Which will hopefully produce less conservative racing. The women tend to be more aggressive than their male counterparts anyway - helped immensely by the limited number of domestiques available with six-to-a-team being the standard modus operandi as opposed to eight, and the greater disparity between the best and worst rider in any given péloton meaning it’s harder to pull back elite talents when they attack - and when other elite talents attack, the elite talents left behind have to get involved in the chase much more readily. There really aren’t any Banesto / USPS / Sky GC trains in women’s cycling, and realistically there aren’t really many that you would consider viable Saeco / Fassa Bortolo / HTC sprint trains either. Even when Rabobank were going 1-2-3 in the Giro Rosa, or bogarting every jersey so that they had six different jerseys across six different riders in the Emakumeen Bira, they weren’t doing it with a train template (no, not even when they roadblocked Mara Abbott on Madonna del Ghisallo. Though, even you Mara apologists, please don’t kid yourself that Mara was going to overturn her two minute deficit to win the Giro that day. If there’s one thing that video showed us, it was that PFP was easily strong enough to answer the attacks; she was only behind Marianne on time bonuses and, should Mara have dropped Marianne, was having no problem answering the attacks, so even if Mara had won 1’54” back on Vos, she needed 1’39” on Pauline too to prevent Rabo still winning, and that looked like an impossible task on the last 6km of a climb - that includes nearly 2km of flat near the summit where Ferrand-Prévot is a stronger rider than Abbott. In retrospect, now she’s had injury upon injury and looks far from the rider she could once have become, I wonder if she regrets being a good footsoldier that day and not going out there and winning the Giro like a 2004 Cunego or something, because I’m willing to bet, especially if she could have put Pooley between her and Marianne so she only needed 10”, she could have dropped Vos and won the maglia rosa that day). Being a dominant team in women’s cycling manifests itself much more like the Quick Step template in the Classics, where you have multiple capable winners for the rivals to juggle who they want to contend with.\n\nSo, there we have it. A six-stage Danmark Rundt for Kvinder which isn’t a crit before the men’s race arrives like the 2016 proposal, but is a standalone, real race like the Women’s Tour or the Giro Rosa that ensures the women can be treated on their merits and not as a warm-up act for the men. It includes sterrato, short bergs, hilltop finishes, sprints, time trials, and a nod to cycling history. Now is the time to capitalise, Danish Cycling. You have a World Champion who has the prime of her career potentially still ahead of her. You have a gutsy, exciting and talented youngster who has charisma to burn and could potentially catalyse a lot of interest in the women’s game with her infectious charm and exciting style. You have at least one more of the most talented prospects in the younger game. You have somebody who can compete in the sprints, you have somebody who can compete on the hills, you have somebody who can compete in the TTs. You have a team which houses one of the standout talents of women’s cycling this season and the reigning U23 World Tour champion. There’s so much potential for a women’s Tour of Denmark to succeed that there’s almost no excuse not to do it.\n\n2017 Danish national road race front group - you can see Dideriksen in the rainbows hidden in the centre, behind/alongside Cille in the Cervélo kit.\n\nWe’re now moving away from Ardennes season, but it’s brought me back to a race that I’ve had, off and on, some designs on for literally years. And seeing as the forum keeps killing me for an hour at a time to stop me from looking at it, I’ve at least got some time to write up a detailed post on my race design.\n\nIt’s always somewhat surprised me that, despite its prominence in the sport and its proximity to very strong and traditional cycling terrain, that there really isn’t a proper, high level one-day race in Luxembourg. It’s a country with a lot of cycling history, but perhaps true to its size and relative lack of prominence, it is apt that while Belgium’s biggest one-dayers are monuments, and the Netherlands’ biggest one-day race is the Amstel Gold Race, with its stellar winners’ list and place of prestige in the calendar starting Ardennes week, Luxembourg’s biggest one day race is probably the GP François Faber, which is generally contested by juniors and espoirs. And even then, until the mid-90s it was a stage race as, for some reason, despite the fact that Luxembourg can readily be lapped within a stage’s distance, it seems that stage racing continues to hold sway in the Grand Duchy; it had some pretty useful winners back in the day - Nicolas Frantz, Etienne de Wilde, Lucien Didier, Kai Hundertmarck, Dariusz Baranowski, Kim Kirchen - but more recently it has regressed back to being a locals’ plaything (though Bob Jungels, the 2011 winner, is doing OK for himself!).\n\nThere is also the GP OST Manufaktur, and its predecessors GP Ost Fenster and GP des Artisans de Manternach, a March one-day race at the .NE level which nonetheless attracts a fairly interesting international field. Its first winner, back in 1985, was Bjarne Riis, who also won it a month after winning the Tour de France, as the race at that point was at the peak of its relevance (that is to say, riders most people have heard of were on the podium - Kim Kirchen won in ’98 and ’99, and Cyril Dessel in 2000), while it was also one of the races that the Ostbloc riders would take over periodically, most notably the 1989 edition in which the DDR team did a 1-2 with Thomas Barth and Uwe Ampler. From 2001 to 2007 there was also the GP Demo-Cars, with the most famous winner being former Bouygues Télécom and Skil-Shimano domestiques Matthieu Sprick, but apart from that it’s all about stage races - from the junior GP Général Patton (stellar winner’s list including Émile Daems, Kim Kirchen, Mickaël Cherel, Simon Špilak, Sebastian Lander, Jan Hirt and Remco Evenepoel (as well as his father Patrick)), through the espoir/pro-am Flèche du Sud (winners including Charly Gaul, Johny Schleck, Acácio da Silva, Hartmut Bölts, Alex Zülle, Kim Kirchen, Bradley Wiggins, Andy Schleck, Geraint Thomas, Marcel Wyss, Bob Jungels, Michael Valgren and Mark Padun) through to, of course, the most famous race, the Tour of Luxembourg, which has run almost uninterrupted since the 1930s (only taking 1940 and 1944 out due to some large sociopolitical event in Europe at the time).\n\nThe Tour of Luxembourg has now more or less settled on its format, and its most famous and distinctive feature is its prologue, which includes the painful but short cobbled ascent of Montée du Grund. Aside from that, however, in recent years the race hasn’t been especially hilly, which has enabled non-climber types like Greg van Avermaet, Matti Breschel and Paul Martens to take the GC. Nevertheless, there have been hillier editions in the past, often when that suited the local riders (2009, when Fränk Schleck won, springs to mind), plus a great many legends of the sport have triumphed in the Grand Duchy’s race - Briek Schotte in 1946; Louison Bobet in 1955; Charly Gaul in 1956, 1959 and 1961; Jos Planckaert in 1962, Freddy Maertens in 1974, Bernard Hinault in 1982, Steven Rooks in 1986, Frank Vandenbroucke in 1997, and perhaps most noteworthy is the 1998 edition which was won by Lance Armstrong - El Texano had just returned from his cancer, and had tried to race the Ruta del Sol and Paris-Nice but been unable to; he returned to the States for a couple of months and came back on a rampage of victories, and the first stage - and subsequent GC - of the Tour of Luxembourg was the start of his reign of terror. It’s also one of the last results of his that still stands.\n\nBut I digress. There has never truly been a Luxembourgish one day race to rival the big races from the neighbouring regions, despite the fact that geographically-speaking Luxembourg would fit perfectly into Ardennes week. Luxembourg gave the world the first overseas rider to win a Grand Tour when François Faber won the 1909 Tour de France (although Faber was a Frenchman in all but licence). It punches well above its weight historically in the sport, having given the world four Grand Tour winners (François Faber, Nicolas Frantz, Charly Gaul and Andy Schleck) as well as one of the more celebrated historic women’s cycling pioneers in Elsy Jacobs. There’s even a small plaque commemorating the great cyclists of Luxembourg - and it’s full, so poor Andy is going to get omitted from that, after not even getting to celebrate his Tour win in Paris either.\n\nIt has featured on the Tour de France route a number of times - although nearby Longwy and Metz were staples of the pre-war Tour, it tended to stay within French boundaries, until after WWII. Luxembourg first appeared on the race route in 1947, in a stage won by the Italian Aldo Ronconi, and has since reappeared in 1953 (stage passed through without stopping, won by Fritz Schär in Liège), 1962 (likewise, Rudi Altig winning in Spa), 1967 (again - Roger Pingeon winning in Jambes), 1969 (Charly Grosskost winning in Esch-sur-Alzette), 1980 (passing through, Henk Lubberding winning in Liège), before hosting the Grand Départ in 1989 with multiple stages - a prologue won by Erik Breukink, a semitappe won by Acácio da Silva, a TTT won by Super-U, and then a flat stage into Belgium won by Raúl Alcalá. In 1992, however, came the most famous day of bike racing that the Grand Duchy has ever seen, as we truly saw something special that day - arguably the most dominant time trial victory in the history of cycling (and yes, I include Cancellara in Mendrisio in that) as Miguel Indurain outperformed all comers by a full 3 minutes. Delgado, in 10th, was almost 5 minutes down on Miguelón. And while Luxembourg hosted the Grand Départ again in 2002, with a road stage won by Rubens Bertogliati and a prologue won by Lance Armstrong, no matter how hard Lance may try, “Luxembourg Time Trial” just means Indurain ’92. It just does. Esch-sur-Alzette hosted a sprint in 2006, but since then has been dormant, with just the Mondorf-les-Bains stage start in 2017 to call on.\n\nHowever, it’s a beautiful city and indeed country, which gives beaucoup opportunities for an entertaining race, so let’s showcase that in a way that the current Tour of Luxembourg sadly never seems to. And what Luxembourg really needs, from a cycling perspective, is a hilly classic. Not only is this the type of terrain in which the Grand Duchy truly excels, as it has an embarrassment of riches in the short-to-medium-and-steep climbs department, but it also sourced much of its greatest cycling glory in the field of the hilly classics. Other than Andy Schleck’s 2010 Tour win - which of course he couldn’t even celebrate when he was officially the defending champion - almost all of the recent glories of Luxembourg in pro cycling have come in these races, often just across the border in the Ardennes. Whether it be Kim Kirchen cresting the Mur de Huy in 2008, Fränk Schleck defying the commentators’ expectations to win Amstel Gold in 2006 (check out the comment at 23:35), or Andy’s epic solo to win Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 2009, that generation of Luxembourgers made the hilly classics their own. There were other champions, of course - Marcel Ernzer won La Doyenne in 1954 - but for the most part that golden generation holds its own. Fränk also won the Giro dell’Emilia, another hilly Classic, while there are podiums and near misses all across the hilly season for all three - all of whom are part of that long-standing Lëtzebuergesch tradition of dynasties of cyclist - the Schlecks, Kirchen, and Laurent Didier are all third generation cyclists, while there are other sets of brothers and similar - most notably the Majerus brothers, Jean and Jacques, who are not to be confused with Jean Majérus (note acute), an earlier rider - and neither of whom are related to Christine Majerus, the current women’s national champion. Either way, it is perhaps under the inspiration of that three-strong golden Lëtzebuergesch generation that current Luxembourg cycling beau, Bob Jungels, moved despite his strong build suggesting a time trial + functional climbing base, toward the hilly classics, culminating in his crowning glory, the 2018 Liège-Bastogne-Liège victory, the last man to win at the finish on the ramp in Ans.\n\nWith this in mind, I’ve designed a sort of out-and-back challenge of a hilly classic, which could be called Luxembourg-Clervaux-Luxembourg if patterned after La Doyenne, however I prefer to call it La Flèche Luxembourgeoise, or also in the local parlance, a Mosel-Franconian dialect which is in the process of breaking away from the German language, Lëtzebuerger Pfeil. One reason for this was that, it’s 2019 so I’ve also drawn a women’s race alongside it, and that doesn’t go as far as Clervaux in order to ensure we have room within the distance to include all the relevant obstacles, but the main reason was simply that La Flèche Luxembourgeoise just sounds better.\n\nThe men’s race is 233km in length (the profile says 240, but that was due to a couple of tracking errors in the initial rolling phase from Sandweiler to Vianden, which I have since corrected on the map version but couldn’t be bothered to rewrite all of the climbs in from the start again, since the actual meat and drink of the profile does not change at all), and takes in 14 classified climbs, while the women’s race is 148km and takes in 9. This makes it immediately one of the hardest races on the women’s calendar, but not quite so long as the World Championships or de Ronde van Vlaanderen; simultaneously it’s a long and very difficult men’s race - but not monument-length. I’m not sure where it should go in the calendar - possibly on the Wednesday after Liège-Bastogne-Liège to offer a final chance to make something of the calendar for those hilly specialists who’ve had a bad Ardennes campaign, looking to take advantage after those who’ve gone all out for Huy and Liège are resting; it would also be ideal for the women as it could survive well even without WWT status in that calendar spot as much of the péloton will already be there, and you could race it before travelling to the US for California, and/or train in the area and enter it between Liège and the GP Elsy Jacobs which takes place in Luxembourg a week or two after the Ardennes anyway.\n\nLa Flèche Luxembourgeoise / Lëtzebuerger Pfeil (Hommes: Sandweiler - Luxembourg-Ville, 233km)\n\nLa Flèche Luxembourgeoise / Lëtzebuerger Pfeil (Femmes: Sandweiler - Luxembourg-Ville, 148km)\n\nSlightly frustrated that by auto-inserting the climbs it puts categorisation on them seeing as this is a one-day race, but it does at least give a bit of an idea of difficulty I guess. I put all the climbs in in the men’s race and drew them up for profiles, then it automatically assigned them categorisations when I tried to get cronoescalada to insert the same climbs into the profile for the women’s race, to save me inserting them all one by one again.\n\nThe départ is from the town of Sandweiler, which is the town hosting Luxembourg Airport, the international route into the country if you’re not coming from one of the three countries that border the micro state. The neutral zone sees us get to the other side of the airport, the aim being to minimise disruption - although the 1992 ITT that Indurain so comprehensively dominated did pass by the airport, dropping onto the lower plateau from Senningerberg. The town is also known for its German military cemetery.\n\nThe first part of the race is rolling, passing through Junglinster, home to Radio Luxembourg’s long wave transmitters, and Diekirch, one of Luxembourg’s most important towns, hosting the Lëtzebuergesch National Museum of Military History, focusing on the Battle of the Bulge, and the hometown of national statesman extraordinaire Paul Eyschen. We head toward the German border, via an uncategorised climb at Reisdorf, and then skirt along the German-Luxembourgish border along the River Our, until we reach the picture perfect town of Vianden, one of Luxembourg’s most scenic locations and one of its premier tourist attractions.\n\nIt is here that the men and women will split. The men turn uphill in Vianden for a long loop that brings them back around to Stolzembourg, while the women will continue in the Our valley directly to that village. From here, I’ll deal with each obstacle individually.\n\n1: Niklosbierg (aka Mont-Saint-Nicolas) (distance remaining: 174km)\n\n4,6km @ 6% is a nice warmup climb. It also has the best scenery of almost any of the climbs, what with being through Vianden and up onto the higher plateau from there. It also includes a stretch of cobbles in Vianden itself. As mentioned, the women don’t take this climb, but for the men it is the first climb of the day. It is followed by a period of rolling terrain on the highlands between the Mosel and Our valleys, taking us to the town of Clervaux, another chocolate box town.\n\n2: Côte de Marnach (distance remaining: 143km)\n\nClervaux is the turn-around point for the race, after which we have this, the least imposing of all the climbs in the race, around 4km at 4%. From here we descend back into the Our valley, and head south to the point at which we reconvene between the men’s and women’s races, in the village of Stolzembourg.\n\n3: Côte de Putscheid (distance remaining men: 120km / women: 86km)\n\nThis one’s a pretty brutal Ardennes ascent - 2,4km at 10,1% and a maximum 50m at 15,5% - the women will take this one on directly off a cold open, as it’s the first climb of the day, so it could produce some action just in the Boonenberg style, as a few may discover the legs really aren’t there. Lots of ramps of 14%, and then a tough up-and-down stretch around Putscheid and Hoscheid, before descending to the banks of the Sûre, for arguably Luxembourg’s most famous climb outside of the Montée du Grund.\n\n4: Côte de Bourscheid (distance remaining men: 103km / women: 70km)\n\nMax gradients approach 20% in this one, a classic of cycling in this part of the world, which you can see motorbike footage of here. There is an incredibly scenic castle on the shoulder of the hill, and this lends it an iconic look as well as its 3,3km at 7,4% including some severe ramps. The men will take on the climb twice, whereas the women climb it just once; the men will subsequently turn left in Bourscheid village to pass the castle, whereas the women will continue along the 348 to descend into Ettelbruck.\n\n5: Côte de Lipperscheid (Leweck) (distance remaining: 95km)\n\n2,6km @ 6,8%, this climb rises from a meandering in the river to finish at Sporthotel Leweck, with a short stretch of highway to Maarkebaach before descending back down to Goebelsmuhle to take on the second loop of the Côte de Bourscheid.\n\n6: Côte de Bourscheid (distance remaining: 84km)\n\nSecond climb of Bourscheid for the men, this time continuing on the 348 and descending into Ettelbruck, bringing the men’s and women’s races back onto the same course once more, with the feed zone then ensuing in the town, with a population of around 7500.\n\n7: Côte de Karelshaff (distance remaining men: 70km women: 57km)\n\nA relatively modest climb which serves as a transition between the larger climbs in central Luxembourg and the collection of smaller climbs that make up the run-in to the finish, the Côte de Karelshaff wears its steepest gradients - ramps of 12% - at the bottom, before easing up to around 2km at 7%, and then like so many of the climbs of the Low Countries, which Luxembourg gets included in for cultural/political reasons, because it really isn’t all that flat, it eases up toward the top.\n\nAfter the descent from this, we have an uncategorised uphill roll into Colmar-Berg, which is home to the Grand Ducal Castle, the Grand Duke’s day-to-day residence, as well as a motor vehicle testing ground. We then roll toward Mersch, just as we reach its outer suburbs, however, we turn uphill once more.\n\n8: Beringerberg (distance remaining men: 55km women: 41km)\n\nThis one’s really quite nasty. The road from Beringen to Beringerberg is difficult enough, but I’ve also, in the interest of trying to encourage some more aggressive racing and also to encourage the key riders to get to the front because placement will be important, incorporated a little sting in the tail, including the Rue Wenzel Stichstraße that takes a more direct route to the summit than the main road - a 400m ramp at 17% (!) within a first kilometre that averages 12%. It’s also very narrow, which has a bit of the northern Classics about it, as the riders will want to ensure they’re not caught out. It’s kind of a scaled-up Keutenberg, this one, with the last 2km being only around 3-4% but the fact that the toughest ramps then lead on to a lengthy false flat could catch a few people out. People won’t be hitting for home here, but still, it’ll possibly eliminate a few people from contention if they’re in the wrong place at the wrong time, or they get it wrong and burn out.\n\nAfter the Beringerberg, we double back on ourself through Angelsberg and into Mersch, which traditionally hosts the start of the final stage of the Tour de Luxembourg. We also have the last flat of the race, around 10km of flat that take us through Lorentzweiler and into Steinsel, where… se armó un zapatiesto.\n\n9: Côte des Sources (distance remaining: 38km)\n\n1,4km @ 10,5%, with a brutal ramp of 500m at 14%, this is the last of the climbs which is only taken on by the men, because the men have an extra small loop of around 13-14km around Lorentzweiler (hence the differences above) which includes this climb out of Heisdorf, whereas the women go straight to climb #10. Much as with Beringerberg, we could take the main 124 highway up to the hilltop, but instead we take a steeper alternative on the Rue des Sources. We then head via Asselscheuer and Rashaff to the descent back into Lorentzweiler, then on to the climb where, I believe, all hell will break loose and we will see the attempts to win the race begin in earnest.\n\n10: Mur de Steinsel (Montée Haute) (distance remaining: 26km)\n\nIf you’ve never seen Montée Haute de Steinsel before, you’re in for a treat. The full climb is , basically a slightly tougher Mur de Huy, but it opens up with 300m at 17% - creating some entertainment courtesy of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peqv6b8BUVI]this approach from An American In Luxembourg.\n\nFinishing with 26km remaining (so the steepest part is with 27km to go), this should be the moment that the race really takes off. It’s the biggest remaining climb - the ones that follow this are either less steep or shorter or both - and coming off the back of Beringerberg and Côte des Sources, both of which will have made placement important and so hopefully got rid of a few domestiques by ensuring the strongest riders have to be at the front to fend for themselves and we can’t get that pack racing that has plagued the Ardennes in recent years to the same extent, it should mean that anybody dropped here has nary a chance to catch back on, because I’ve taken good care to minimise any flat terrain from here on in. There’s 3km of downhill false flat at the end of the climb, then a proper descent, then another 3km of downhill false flat, but that’s the best the riders are going to get. The race should well and truly be on by now.\n\n11: Côte de Biirgerkreiz (distance remaining: 16km)\n\n1,5km at 8,7%, with the last 500m averaging over 10%, Biirgerkreiz is another option for attacking from - it’s the longest remaining climb and the last one over a kilometre in length. It is, however, almost completely ramrod straight, like a scaled down Cumbres Verdes, so getting out of sight of the chasing bunch will be hard. The road is also a fairly major one, so it’s not like you can compensate by making placement key like on Beringerberg. However, with just 16km remaining at the summit, the riders can almost taste Luxembourg-Ville by now, and there will surely be some action enticed here with the reduced groups at the head of the field.\n\n12: Limpertsberg (distance remaining: 12km)\n\nAlso known as the Pabeierbierg, this is a classic of the Tour of Luxembourg, often being included in the final stages of the race. They enter that climb at 47:20 in this race coverage, so you can see it in full. 825m in length, averaging 9,1% and with a maximum of 14%, it often provides a focal point for a short closing circuit in the national Tour, sometimes even an HTF (as it does in the video provided) and should create a potential interesting battle if we have small groups at this stage. It isn’t the summit for us, although the characteristics of the race from there on in are similar - the Tour of Luxembourg passes it for the first time with 12km remaining and then heads around the suburbs of the city. We descend back down to the banks of the Mosel, to take on the penultimate ascent.\n\n13: Rue du Trêves (distance remaining: 6km)\n\n1,4km @ 5,3%, with a middle 600m at 8%, this climb is also, save for that one hairpin shown above, completely straight, once more enticing some moves earlier on as you’ll want enough breathing room to be able to be out of sight by now. It’s a bit of a Cauberg-alike, getting a bit steeper, then evening out toward the top. With 6km remaining at the summit, things are getting tough here. The Ardennes specialist types surely don’t want to leave it too late and really should have gone on Montée Haute or Biirgerkreiz. Surely a more cobbled type specialist like van Avermaet should have been dropped by now, but what of the likes of Gilbert and Kwiatkowski, who are equally adept over all terrains?\n\nI mean, among the women it matters less, as often the Ronde selects people on the basis of their climbing in a different way to the Ardennes, but still resulting in similar names being up front - the likes of van Vleuten and van der Breggen are of course all-terrain vehicles, but more waifish climbers like Ludwig and Niewiadoma would appear to be more built for the Ardennes, but can compete in the Ronde with great effect. But still - if those riders wish to make this race theirs, they would be well advised to use this climb, because there’s only one remaining, and it’s the one that suits the northern classics men and women best.\n\n14: Montée du Grund (distance remaining: 1km)\n\nOf course we were going to this well, the most famous cycling climb in the Grand Duchy. According to Cronoescalada it’s 400m @ 14%, all of which is, of course, to anybody who has seen the classic Tour of Luxembourg prologue, great - a narrow cobbled ascent which will provide the final battlegrounds for any groups that may remain, if somebody hasn’t done any solo moves to this point at the head of the race. Here you can get a feel for it as undertaken by an amateur cyclist - the first part in a classic Murallas de Ávila style, but steeper, then through the narrow but high-sided gate and into the second sector, then the final part, hemmed in by buildings which will make the fans seem ever louder, with their voices echoing off the houses. Team cars might have to be restricted from this section, but since the summit of the climb is only 1100m from the finish, that shouldn’t be too much of a hardship - one suspects that we’ll have a fairly high attrition rate on this course anyway, and the moto support can follow for this short section leading into the finish, with the team cars instead continuing along the Boulevard de la Petrusses, while the cyclists and motos move on to the Rue de Prague and subsequently Montée du Grund.\n\nThe riders then pass through the city to return to major roads between Cathédral Nôtre-Dame and the Monument du Souvenir. Effectively, if you look at the map of the Tour de Luxembourg prologue, we arrive on the map on the lower right on Boulevard d’Avranches; we then turn right onto Rue de Prague, which is the road with the hairpin on it. We then follow the route of the prologue all the way until the final right-hander, where we stay straight on, turn right onto Rue Nôtre Dame, then ride through where the prologue begins and onto Boulevard Roosevelt. This means a technical-is sector from 1100m to 700m from the line, then 350m on Boulevard Roosevelt, before a final 90º right-hander opposite Pont Adolphe and a 350m straight sprint on Boulevard Royal.\n\nFinishing straight\n\nSo the final stages of the race include a very technical opening to the final kilometre, after a short and sharp cobbled burst. It’s not quite as out there as it may seem, it seems to me not dissimilar to the finish of Strade Bianche, and also of the Giro di Lombardia when it finished in Bergamo in 2014, that fairly poorly-raced edition which was won by Dan Martin by sheer virtue of being the only man not to have staked all of his energy on an expected sprint, and who dared to make a move before the final 200m. Only the wide open final 700m should hopefully enable a very safe finish once we’ve got out of the inner city spread. It would have been nice to finish on Boulevard Roosevelt, but I felt it better for safety purposes to move the finish to Boulevard Royal so we didn’t have the risk of a 15-20 man sprint (if everything goes terribly wrong) after a technical and narrow section through the pedestrianised sections of the city centre; I know that Tirreno-Adriatico has got away with a few things like that, but never from an established, specific finish like you would have in a one-day race.\n\nAnd there you have it - a worthy classic, I hope you’ll agree; 14 categorised climbs for men, 9 for women, a 230km distance which is sub-monument but surely sufficient for a classic, some beautiful scenery to take in, an out-and-back that covers the country’s natural beauty and popular and established cycling spots as well as introducing some new ones, and ending in the capital city with an iconic ascent; options to make the race from afar, or if not afar then at least decently far enough from the finish to give us at least an hour’s good racing, and also a race where the route and distance would enable you to put on both the men’s and women’s races on the same day, and televise both in depth,\n\nThis could be a one-day instant classic, in much the same way as Strade Bianche was an instant classic - a race which doesn’t have history but the route, how it’s been incorporated into the calendar and the kind of racing produced, has meant it has been taken to heart by fans and riders alike. With the classic Ardennes classics having attracted a lot of criticism for negative racing in recent years and leading to a number of route tweaks, some better (moving finish away from Cauberg in Amstel Gold), some worse (before that, the addition of the 2012 World Championships circuit moving all other decisive climbs further away from the finish in favour of the terrible Bemelerberg), the route here not incentivising leaving things to the last minute should hopefully result in better racing than the average Ardennes week race, at least for the men (AGR this year was a bit of an anomaly of course). And this could be a one day race that Luxembourg could truly be proud of.\n\nBefore I set off on my next stage race, one more bit of one-day work. I’ve realised that the average length of these write-ups has been tending upwards literally for years until reaching such a point as to affect the thread’s viability, but this is probably quite a good one to keep brief, since it isn’t a new race at all, but instead one of the original categories I suggested for the thread back when the search function on the site was less intuitive, but I was able to operate a working library for the thread. That category turned out, after a brief flurry of attention early in the thread’s existence, to be one of the least popular styles with race designers, probably because of the limited freedom offered for creativity. That idea was ‘fictional versions of existing one-day races’. Lombardia and the Ronde van Vlaanderen got a few designs, I had a go at Paris-Bruxelles, and a couple of people revisited La Flèche Wallonne, but little else, and since the forums’ upgrade I think this has been even more uncommon.\n\nHowever, I have a race that I feel we can do something with, a race that I can improve with a bit of design work, and a race that is somewhat near and dear to me - Eschborn-Frankfurt, or the Frankfurt Maitagrennen.\n\nThe Rund um den Henninger Turm, as it was originally called, was incepted in the early 1960s, and has grown to become Germany’s most pre-eminent one day race, holding that role even while Cyclassics became a WT race in the late 2000s; Frankfurt was originally the German round of the World Cup in the 90s, but the role passed to Hamburg after a couple of years because of the fact that the organisers of the Frankfurt Maitagrennen refused to move it from 1. May, a national holiday in Germany, but of course meaning the race could happen on any day of the week rather than allowing for a more fixed calendar. The route took in a collection of the climbs in the Taunus range to the northwest of the city, with a closing circuit including the climb of Hainer Weg, a slight uphill - not a categorization-worthy climb but a slight uphill that could make it less than a straightforward sprinters’ finish, somewhat like the finish of the Tour de Vendée, and a finish outside the Henninger Turm, a famous landmark of south Frankfurt, an outsized grain silo that predated much of the skyscraper developments that give Frankfurt its current, slightly sarcastic, nickname of ‘Mainhattan’.\n\nThe list of winners of the race is pretty stellar, from Armand Desmet winning the first one it has generally been the preserve of good-but-not-legendary Classics specialists, with the occasional foray into outright legends - Stablinski in 1965, Altig in 1970, Merckx in 1971, Godefroot in 1974, Maertens in 1976, Knetemann in 1977 and Baronchelli in 1980 are archetypal of this era. Ludo Peeters and Phil Anderson both won the race back to back in the 80s, and in the early 90s people like Johan Bruyneel, Rolf Sorensen, Michele Bartoli and Olaf Ludwig won the race, before Erik Zabel took the first of his three wins. For a decade the race alternated between reduced sprints and small groups won by strong-climbing puncheurs - Rebellin, Garzelli and local boy Patrik Sinkewitz also won during this era - before Henninger withdrew its sponsorship and the race was restyled “Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop”, for a year, and then “Rund um den Finanzplatz Eschborn-Frankfurt”. In 2010 the finish was moved from the site of the old Henninger Turm, and placed outside the Alte Oper. Fabian Wegmann won a sprint of a group of 20 by sneaking into a chicane on the route 500m out with a cheeky move that meant a lot of the sprinters got boxed in and couldn’t get around him on the slightly leftward-curving finishing “straight”. In 2011, however, John Degenkolb won a sprint of 70 riders as HTC pledged not to repeat their tactical mistakes of the previous year.\n\nThis led to the organisers amending the route slightly, adding an extra ascent of the Mammolshainer Berg, the race’s signature ascent, a 2,7km ascent averaging 7% on its way into the suburban outlying town of Königstein im Taunus, known primarily for a short, steep cut-through called Mammolshainer Stich, which includes gradients verified at over 21%, and with some estimates suggesting a max of 26%. The fact you can see all the way from the Taunus hills into the Main/Rhein basin and pick out the skyscrapers of the city from distance just makes it a more iconic shot.\n\nAt first it worked - in 2012, Tony Martin attempted a long solo, and a chasing trio of Firsanov, Moser and Oss were able to get across to him before Moser won; 2013’s was an exciting finish as Moser tried unsuccessfully - but only just - to defend his crown as he was outsprinted by Simon Špilak, the last survivors of a group also including Domenico Pozzovivo which were caught literally on the line - with 200m to go you still didn’t know if Andre Greipel or Domenico Pozzovivo would finish first - remarkable. In 2014, the sprinters had worked it out, and Kristoff won a sprint of 40. 2015’s race was cancelled due to a terrorist threat, as the Polizei searched and arrested a couple living in Oberursel, at the base of the Großer Feldberg climb, seizing weapons including a pipe bomb and an automated rifle; they had been spotted exploring a forest along the race route, and had rumoured connections to al-Qaeda; while Oberursel is the terminus of the U3 U-Bahn route in Frankfurt and hiking from Hohemark into the mountains is a popular pastime for the urban population there, in the wake of the Boston Marathon Bombing, the police took no risks, and the race was cancelled.\n\nSince then, however, the sprinters have held sway. 56 riders contested the finish in 2016, and then ASO took over the race. Kristoff continued his dominance, taking his record fourth win in 2018, this time from a group of under 30 as it moves more toward the 2010 kind of time - however, nearly 80 riders contested the bunch kick in 2019 as Pascal Ackermann took the win, so it’s about time the race got another revamp to try to vary the finishes, as it has now been five sprint editions in a row. The organisers have periodically tried to toughen up the race, but the pan-flat finishes in Frankfurt itself rather than in the Sachsenhausen district south of the river, and the wide open roads in the run-in from Kronberg to the centre of Frankfurt, which favour the bunch, have meant that with several teams now interested in controlling it for their sprinters, and a number of riders no longer believing their breakaways will be successful, the style of the racing has become less varied. The old Henninger Turm, the icon of the race, was pulled down in 2013, and while a housing development built on its spot has attempted to ape its design, it’s just not quite the same, and if anything the race being an honourable but not quite right facsimile of what it used to be makes the history of 80 Hainer Weg just that little bit more apposite. This was once one of the most unpredictable races of the year - and it’s also the race that made me a cycling fan, as I used to live on the race route and it was following a chance experience of catching this race live that I caught the cycling bug. I started the thread for it several years running on the boards, but that flexible date has also made it a harder one to follow repeatedly. Anyway, you can see how the organisers have tried to vary things to keep the differences in the race:\n\n2009 race - Großer Feldberg, Ruppertshain, Bittalhöhe, Mammolshain\n\n2010 race - Großer Feldberg, Ruppertshain, Mammolshain, Bittalhöhe, Mammolshain\n\n2013 race - Großer Feldberg, Ruppertshain, Mammolshain, Mammolshain, Mammolshain, Mammolshain\n\n2018 race - Großer Feldberg, Ruppertshain, Mammolshain, Bittalhöhe, Ruppertshain, Mammolshain, Bittalhöhe, Ruppertshain, Mammolshain, Mammolshain\n\nAs you can see - the organisers are definitely trying to make this as selective as they can (though 2019’s edition removed one ascent each of Bittalhöhe and Ruppertshain from the previous year’s version). But those laps around the centre of Frankfurt at the end, and those wide roads from Kronberg through Eschborn to Rodelheim and Bockenheim just serve to make it hard for any break that isn’t large enough and cohesive enough to stand any chance of making it. But there are a couple of unexplored options. Here’s my take.\n\nThe start of the race - from Eschborn into Frankfurt and then heading northward via a small rise at University Campus Riedberg into Oberursel - is no different from the ‘classic’ version of the route. What I have done, however, is instead of going over Großer Feldberg once and then having the loop to the southwest of it - either Mammolshain, Bittalhöhe and Ruppertshain or just Mammolshain - is to extend the loop; the Bittalhöhe route is the road which runs from Königstein im Taunus to Glashütten, so in effect by heading east to Oberursel and then taking a second time up the Großer Feldberg, I am taking a climb ASO records as 2,3km @ 6,2%, and replacing it with a second time up to the mighty king of the Taunus.\n\nAccording to La Flamme Rouge, Großer Feldberg is 13,8km @ 4,6% so while it’s not the most challenging climb in the world, given how sustained it is in length, getting over two ascents of it will be more of a challenge for the sprinters of the world, and mean that they earn their right to contest the win far more.\n\nThe second time up the Großer Feldberg comes at 88km to go - so we’re a long way out - but it’s enough that with the Ruppertshain and its steep slopes breaking up the descent, a lot of the sprinters should be quite poorly placed or not satisfactorily recovered by the time we get our second double ascent of the Mammolshain.\n\nI know what you’re thinking: “this is an awful lot of hype for what amounts to just an extra loop of a climb we already know, Libertine. And if I’m looking at that profile of yours correctly, you’ve not just kept the run-in through Eschborn, Rodelheim and Bockenheim but if anything, it’s further from Mammolshain to the finishing line, so how is this going to improve racing?”\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nFirstly, I have moved the finish from Alte Oper to Hanauer Landstraße, in the east of the city. Although there are tramlines, these do not need to get in the way as a) we barely need to cross them, and b) there is only one line that runs down this way, the Straßenbahn #11 from Fechenheim to Höchst, and even then there’s only 6 stops that would be disrupted, max, because the rest of the stops can be shared with either Straßenbahn #12 from Fechenheim to Schwanheim (but looping north of Ostbahnhof, into Bornheim) or Straßenbahn #14 from Bornheim to Louisa, on the way to Neu-Isenburg. Where we do need to cross the tram tracks, this can be done by medium of a temporary covering, like the guttering in the Briançon Citadel, as the disruption will be minimal. Hanauer Landstraße has always got two lanes minimum of width either side of the Straßenbahn, and further down the Straßenbahn lines are segregated from the main body of the road anyway. At the point where I’ve put the finish, the road itself is three lanes wide on our side of the tracks.\n\nFinishing straight on left - this is about 300m from home\n\nThe other innovation is a circuit to the east of the city which is about 18km in length. This was borne out of my attempt to make a World Championships circuit in Frankfurt, and to show how a “sprinter’s worlds” should be done. The Frankfurt circuit takes in the peripheral city district of Enkheim, the terminus of the U7 Underground train (when the riders first arrive in Frankfurt, they arrive in Rodelheim, meet the U6 at Hausen near where I used to live, then this meets the U7 at Industriehof, so we basically trace this U-Bahn line across the city as it goes through Bockenheim, Westend, the Alte Oper - where the current race finishes - and across almost to Ostbahnhof before heading up to Enkheim), and then up to Bergen-Enkheim, past the new location of Batschkapp, Frankfurt’s legendary rock club which for many years (and in all of my memories) was holed up in a former textile warehouse in the north of the city in Weißer Stein, but has had to move in recent years, and serves as the counterpoint to, on the other side of the Autobahn on the way to Fechenheim, home of moon13, formerly Cocoon (and before that, Omen), the home of Frankfurt’s techno scene and the local residence club of legendary techno DJ Sven Väth. The name of Bergen-Enkheim gives it away: this is a hill. And not an inconsiderable one either. I mean, in the grand scheme of things it’s a pretty small hill. But if we’ve got a group of 40 or so as we have had in recent years in the run-in in Frankfurt, it is nice to at least throw a bit of a curveball in there, so that the attackers have more of a chance to make something happen. There are a few roads that climb up from Enkheim into Bergen-Enkheim. I have chosen Röhrborngasse - 750m averaging 9,3%, with a maximum of 20%. It even has its own website. It has been used in the Hessen-Rundfahrt, but that race is long since departed, and the amateur championships of West Germany also included it in a circuit in 1975.\n\nWith only 11,5km remaining at the summit, however, this is a chance for the puncheur to make hay while the sun shines, and it’s something that the sprinters will need to think about - not toasting too many people pulling breaks back before it, as they have to think about leaving enough in their own tanks to get over these 800m - and tactical placing will be important, as will managing any attackers. Looking at the groups that have contested the sprint in the last three seasons, there are people like Jan Bakelants, Oliver Naesen, Edoardo Zardini, Enrico Battaglin, Dylan Teuns, Rein Taaramäe, Maciej Paterski, Silvan Dillier, Emanuel Buchmann and Simon Špilak who may see a climb like this as their chance - however being only 750m in length means it’s not a guaranteed difference-maker that suddenly turns this into an Ardennes race.\n\nThere’s then a second climb on the run-in, but this is not one that is likely to cause any great difficulty - after a gradual downhill on Vilbeler Landstraße and Wilhelmshöher Straße, a right turn followed by a technical left-right chicane takes us onto Hofhausstraße, in Stadtteil Seckbach. This is 1100m at 5,3%, but it’s wide open and only has a couple of corners and no real steep gradients, so sprinters needn’t be afraid of it; however, it is very liable to prove an obstacle to their getting back onto anybody who has attacked on Röhrborngasse. Luckily for them, then, at the end of this, we head onto the B521 dual carriageway, which takes us into Frankfurt-Nordend on a straight road, so they may be able to get a visual on the fugitives briefly. We then head along Dortelweiler Straße and Im Prüfling into Bornheim, where we cross over the tramlines and go left-right onto Berger Straße, famous for its market and its cafes. This is the last real chance for the break to escape, as it’s fairly narrow, but then they turn left at the bottom of the road, 2,2km from the line, and it’s onto the wide open Habsburger Allee.\n\nFrom here, it’s just a couple of easy rights, and then a couple of sweeping lefts in short succession at Ostbahnhof itself (just in front of the Europäische Zentralbank, in fact) before returning to Hanauer Landstraße for the final 650m of run-in to the line. So yes, this could still be a sprint, but while the earlier climbs will tell us who will fight it out in the final 20km of the race, there is still the opening up of opportunities for riders of varying types. After all, you might be able to get rid of a few helpers for the sprinters by racing hard on Mammolshain, especially if some of those sprinters are suffering on Großer Feldberg; and if those sprinters that remain have very few helpers, it will be easier to get away from them on Röhrborngasse, and then they’ll have to do their own work in the run-in.\n\nI think that that 18km circuit would make a good ‘sprinters’ worlds’ along similar lines to Geelong. There’s one climb which is steep enough to create separation but not long enough to be automatically decisive, and there’s another climb shortly after to try to prevent a chase getting organised too quickly - but then there’s a flat run-in with the final 2km being on wide open roads which will suit a chase. Doing repeated laps of this circuit, with the first few kilometres also being flat, will likely favour the bunch, but the bunch will become increasingly thinned out, which was why I thought of World Championship races like Geelong as a template. However, doing it just once at the end of a one-day race which has included varying types of climbing… this could be very interesting indeed.\n\nOK, next project. I've had a couple of goes at the Deutschland Tour before, one was a three week race, but I think it's fair to say that given there are only a couple of selective areas for real HC and cat.1 mountains, repeated three week races would be too excessive as the key mountains would get too repetitive; sure, I know another country which hosts a three week race has its mountains concentrated into two specific geographic areas (i.e. France), but the range of mountains that they have in France in those two ranges is just more extensive even if the Tour itself doesn't always use them. We've seen a few three week Deutschland Tours on the forum - most recently by rghysens last autumn - but while Germany does have the Alps, but it only touches the edges of them in its southern borderlands, and most of the German climbs in the Alps are either low and gradual passes, or they are one-way goat tracks at the kind of percentages that Javier Guillén can only dream of. The Schwarzwald is similar to the Vosges, offering a number of good potential mountain stages, but the rest of the mountain ranges in Germany are mainly lower and medium levels, so while you can make some really great stages there, a cohesive three week GT is a bit harder. But since the real race is being brought back under ASO's auspices, albeit in a reduced format, and Germany is a large country with cycling history and no real national tour of its own (it has run inconsistently of course), I've always been drawn to it for its possibilities, many of which either haven't been explored or haven't been explored for a long time in real life (we have had quite a few attempts to rectify that on these boards of course!!!), and because of my own personal history there.\n\nMy second attempt at the Deutschlandtour was a two week race; I think this is more fair. The country is too large to reasonably provide a tour of the country with a one week race like the real Deutschlandtour was, at least in the iteration that I am most familiar with. I have decided therefore that I will settle on a two week race because I think this should be a usable format for races - at the .HC kind of level as a means to develop GT racers and also to offer possibilities for the kind of racer for whom their recovery is one of their greatest strengths - e.g. Steven Kruijswijk or Ryder Hesjedal - beyond the Grand Tours. And obviously this does not require a complete rewrite of history like my most recent Friedensfahrt; while I do use some East German terrain here, I am keenly aware that having done three Peace Races and a DDR-Rundfahrt, I have not wrung the former DDR dry but have already been through the Steiler Wand von Meerane, the Teufelstein, the Hallescher Katzenköpfe and Täve Schur sitting up for Bernhard Eckstein enough that they're kind of taken as read. On the other hand, there is still a lot left for me to explore in the former BRD. Like with my Vueltas, therefore, I have decided to lay some ground rules.\n\n- Because Germany does have certain areas that are too tempting to use, I can only use a limited number of the following:\n\n- Lüneburger Heide cobbles\n\n- Hölle des Ostens cobbles\n\n- Berchtesgadener Land\n\n- Aue / Fichtelgebirge\n\n- The race must start and finish in large cities; the previous attempt ran from Dresden to Heidelberg. This one will start in Berlin - it's difficult to have a traditional parade stage in Berlin, without having a large transfer, because Berlin is in the northern third of Germany which is on the same lowlands that make up the Netherlands, Flanders, Denmark and the majority of Poland, and therefore the only way to have a stage race that finished with stage 15 in Berlin and not have a large transfer would be to have a cobbled stage or an ITT, unless they wanted to go with a mountaintop finish on Brocken which is not particularly selective. I may well do an edition which finishes in Berlin at some point - I have a lot of ideas because despite having done two Deutschlandtours and with all those East German races under my belt, a) my ideas and knowledge have improved greatly since that first 21-stage race which included a king of the cobblestones jersey (and hunting out points to give for that also affected the race), and b) West Germany, apart from the Niedersachsen flatlands and that central area around eastern Baden-Württemberg and west-central Bavaria, is absolutely chocked full of potential, mostly of the Ardennes type or medium-mountain type ranges, not too much in the way of the super steep Basque type climbs but still enough that plenty of opportunities are there to be had for race design, and the fact that I have no fixed start/finish here means that the pacing can be moved around too.\n\n- Only one stage host (well, two: one finish and a subsequent start) can be abroad. This would usually be in Austria, seeing as the real life Deutschlandtour used to go overseas for its queen stages in its latter years - 2005 and 2007 on the Rettenbachferner, 2006 in Seefeld, 2004 in Sankt Anton am Arlberg and 2008 at Hochfügen. However, it is also possible to find interesting potential stage hosts in France (Vosges mountains), Belgium and Luxembourg (Ardennes type stages, though Germany offers a multitude of possibilities for these anyway) and the Czech Republic (medium mountains somewhere like Krúpka or Dlouha Louká) are also possibilities which have been used by other users when designing German stage races. And my last Deutschlandtour featured one such overseas stage finish, a mountain stage in another Germanophone country, this being the Liechtensteiner ski resort of Malbun.\n\nA feature of German cycling over the years has been length. Long stages, long TTs, and long, drawn-out climbs. The race has tried to get off the ground at various times in history; the 1920s-30s version, in Weimar Germany, was at its longest 16 stages long with all but one stage over 200km in length. In the late 1930s, the Nazis revived it, extending it to three weeks by 1939, but then of course WWII intervened. Although cycling was far more popular in the DDR than the BRD, it was the latter that first reintroduced a national tour, starting with a 6 stage race in 1947 to the DDR's 1949, and this swiftly grew to two weeks in duration, still averaging well over 200km a stage, and wavering between 12 and 17 stages.\n\nAt this stage, the Deutschland Tour could have been what the Vuelta is now; both races were growing and shrinking in the 1950s, and having periods of not running. The Deutschland Tour went on hiatus from 1953-4, returned in 1955, then disappeared for four seasons before returning as a one-week race in 1960, with interest spurred on by Rudi Altig. After a few editions it disappeared again with German cycling sitting in the doldrums (even in the east, the mid to late 1960s were a barren time, but in the 70s things looked up again in the DDR before they went through a golden generation in the 80s) until another German star, Dietrich Thurau, led to another attempt to resurrect the event in the late 1970s. With stars like Thurau, Gerrie Knetemann, Fedor van Hertog, Francesco Moser, Jan Raas, Marino Lejarreta, Giuseppe Saronni Faustino Rupérez and Fons de Wolf in tow, this was a high potential reboot, but swiftly the fields fell away and the race was mothballed again until the late 90s when the version most of us will be familiar with was established, again in the wake of the success of a particular German star, this time Jan Ullrich; this came after the reunification of Germany, meaning that the DDR love of cycling was able to enthuse the entire nation, which was revelling in positivity following the Wiedervereinigung, and stars born in the DDR such as Erik Zabel, Jan Ullrich, Jens Voigt and Andreas Klöden could be fêted across the whole nation, wowing the fans with their exploits across all of Europe, not just in the relative isolation of amateur-but-not-truly-amateur cycling in the Communist bloc.\n\n1980 Deutschlandtour\n\nThat first edition of that particular reboot in 1999 also began, like I do here, in Berlin; it seemed a symbolic place to start, heading down to Leipzig in stage 1, before leaving the former DDR on stage 2 and spending the rest of the race distance in the former BRD. An odd choice, you may have thought, but you must also remember that at this point the Friedensfahrt was still running - and in 1999 it in fact saw its first ever excursion into the former West Germany, with a stage to Hof, a Bavarian former border town (and for those of you who've read The Race Against the Stasi, it was from here that Dieter Wiedemann's penfriend and later wife who set into motion his defection accessed the former East). 2000's edition also featured just one stage - the last - in the former East, with the Peace Race starting in Hanover and moving eastward from there. This format continued - 2001 featuring one day's racing in Thüringen (and most of a second), but in 2002, the former East Germany was frozen out entirely. By 2003, though, the Deutschlandtour was rising in stature, and the Peace Race was an empty shell of a race, so it didn't matter that it was travelling through Eastern terrain - the Deutschlandtour was the biggest game in town. Dresden held the depart in 2003, as it did in my first two week version, Erik Zabel winning a stage to Altenburg which included the famous Steiler Wand, and 2004 saw Leipzig take the finish, after a MTF at Fichtelberg on the penultimate day (little was to be had by way of time gaps). 2005 saw one stage out of 8, but the final three editions saw no racing in the former DDR at all - a sad indictment given all of the cycling history there. The race had been wavering for a few years after the impact of Operación Puerto robbing the nation of Jan Ullrich, followed swiftly by the T-Mobile team's withdrawal in the wake of the Freiburg scandal and the revelations of Patrik Sinkewitz, before the scandals rocking the Gerolsteiner team, the penultimate remaining German World Tour squad, at the 2008 Tour de France, with team leader Stefan Schumacher and GC surprise Bernhard Kohl both suspended, was the final straw, and we lost the race again for a decade.\n\nLinus Gerdemann, the last winner of a classic style Deutschlandtour (after all, four stages can barely be described as a Tour OF a country the size of Germany). For many years touted as a great promise but in the end he and most of his generation were to serve only as placeholders until the next generation came along, as Germany reverted to the TTers and sprinters that it always had specialised in, especially in the East)\n\nNow: I'm going to bring back the Deutschlandtour properly, over the two week duration that was envisaged for it all those moons ago in the days of Weimar, and utilizing enough of the terrain for it to be a proper Deutschland Tour - while still not using so much of it that there isn't the possibility for future editions that aren't repetitious. I have cannibalized a couple of my other ideas in this race, and left out a few of the most well-trodden paths. There are a number of long stages, but to counter them, I have decided to throw a bit of a sop to the way cycling actually is at time of writing with a shorter one or two too.\n\nStage 1: Berlin - Berlin, 10,2km (EZF)\n\nI'm certainly not the first person to start a German race with a time trial in Berlin. Rghysens has two Deutschland Tours starting there - one 9-day and one 21-stage event; lemon cheese cake did a two week Deutschland Tour which started with a Berlin TT too; while Bavarianrider, in the first attempt in this thread to do a GT-length German race, in an audacious route which included a Nebelhorn MTT and several 50-60km tests against the clock, also premiered this option to us. So I'm hardly being original, shall we say.\n\nThe length of my ITT is almost exactly the same as rghysens' similar chrono, but with a different route. The start and finish will be on Paul-Löbe-Allee, between the Paul-Löbe-Haus, named after the Weimar era politician instrumental in regenerating the SPD in the post-war environment, and the Reichstag building. The riders will exit the start ramp and turn right, past the Bundeskanzleramt, and cross the Spree into Alt-Moabit - for once we're using the western side of Berlin in one of my races, so not restricting the finish to Alexanderplatz and Karl-Marx-Allee. After this they turn left onto Paulstraße, across Lutherbrücke and into Tiergarten, where they proceed tro circumnavigate the iconic Siegessäule, designed to commemorate Prussian victory over Denmark, but delayed in the building process until such time as it could also commemorate victories over Austria and France in the intervening period. Originally placed at Platz der Republik, it was relocated by the Nazis, along with access tunnels built by Albert Speer in line with their envisaged (grotesque) new city centre plans, which made it seem less relevant in the immediate aftermath of the war, but on the other hand did spare it from destruction.\n\nAfter this, it's a straight run down Straße des 17. Junis, an unconventional naming practice for the former Charlottenburger Chaussee - it was named by the West Germans, provocatively in honour of those who lost their lives in the East German uprising of June 17th 1953; it links the Siegessäule with Germany's most iconic architectural structure, the Brandenburg Gate. We turn right in front of the famous Gate, and then left almost immediately, running alongside the Holocaust Memorial before turning left and right again to join the continuation of Straße des 17. Junis into the former East Berlin, along Unter den Linden, another wide open two-pronged thoroughfare which is one of the city's most iconic, if not its most iconic outright, street.\n\nFeaturing a number of major sights, such as the Russian (former Soviet) Embassy, an imposing building given pride of place on the most important road in Soviet-Occupied Berlin, the State Library, the Berliner Staatsoper, the Historisches Museum (formerly the arsenal, and the oldest extant building to have survived) and the Kronprinzenpalais, this is a real sightseeing excursion, with us riding onto the tip of Karl-Liebknecht-Straße, the continuation of Unter den Linden which runs as far as Alexanderplatz; we don't quite go that far, instead doing a loop which takes in the Museumsinsel - on the picture below, we arrive in the bottom left riding past the front of Berliner Dom, in the foreground, around the back of the Altes Museum and then left, then right back onto Unter den Linden which you can see in the upper left.\n\nFrom there, we retrace our steps along Unter den Linden, riding back on the opposite side of the thoroughfare, turning right on Wilhelmstraße, left to the bottom corner of the Reichstagsgebäude, left past the comparatively low-key Sinti und Roma Denkmal and then right at the Brandenburg Gate once more to retrace our steps on Straße des 17. Junis; however after passing the Sowjetisches Ehrendenkmal Tiergarten (not to be confused with the larger, more dramatic Ehrendenkmal in Treptower Park, in former East Berlin) we turn right to return to Paul-Löbe-Allee. Slightly too long to be a prologue, this is nevertheless a flat and fast ITT that should give us some small time gaps. We aren't going for the usual \"three week German Tour = first week of flat stages in the north\" approach here (not least because we only have two weeks to fill, but it's a different shaped route to normal anyway), so it isn't going to be a disaster of a TT rider taking the Trikot and then sprinters failing to dethrone them for a few days; but I do need to create some kind of time gaps early on to give people something to fight for in the early stages.\n\nA bit like the Giro, Berlin was not a focal point of early attempts at tours of Germany, which instead operated an east to west approach (starting in Breslau, present day Wrocław, Poland, and ending in Aachen on the western tip of the country) in 1911's first attempt, and was based around Cologne in the second attempt in 1922. 1927's Großer Opelpreis von Deutschland was the first time Berlin saw a national Tour (Rund um Berlin had of course been running since the 1890s and Berlin-Cottbus-Berlin since 1909) and the Opel sponsorship saw the focal point being Frankfurt am Main. In 1930, Berlin hosted start and finish, but a year later this was moved to Rüsselsheim, the Opel factory on the outskirts of Frankfurt. It was only with the Nazis' version of the race in the late 30s that Berlin came to be the traditional start and finish; however, for obvious reasons the city did not feature in the various Deutschlandrundfahrt/Deutschlandtour resurrections during the Cold War era; the issue of travelling to the city would mean significant - and troublesome - transfers mid-stage and it became a magnet for protesters - Wall City Rock! - notwithstanding that of course its Sonderstatus meant that it wasn't really a viable capital of West Germany either. In the post-Wende reincarnation of the Deutschland Tour, it served as a ceremonial départ for the first edition, which finished in Bonn, which of course had lost its role as the Bundesrepublik's capital when the position returned to Berlin; the route was reversed in 2000 and Erik Zabel won symbolically in the city for the T-Mobile team, linking East and West Germany in more ways than one. But since then, nada.\n\nWatermarked, but the only photo I can find of the precise victory I mention\n\nOf course, there is a parallel history, in that while the Deutschlandtour may have run sporadically, and in line with periods of BRD success, the DDR-Rundfahrt was a constant, with the East Germans having been huge fans of cycling. East Berlin featured regularly, all the way back to the Ostzonen-Rundfahrt in 1949. Every edition until 1959, when the finish was moved to Potsdam, finished on Karl-Marx-Allee (originally Stalin-Allee). In the mid-60s, the organizers moved away from finishing in Berlin - after all the Berliners already got the finish of Berlin-Cottbus-Berlin, Berlin-Angermünde-Berlin, the Rund um Berlin and at least one Friedensfahrt stage a year. Nevertheless winners in the city include Bernhard Eckstein and Michael Milde in the national stage race, and Lothar Meister I (there were two unrelated Lothar Meisters plying their trade in the 40s and 50s in DDR cycling), Egon Adler, Yuri Melikhov, Erich Hagen (including winning the race outright on the final day after teammate Egon Adler crashed and the Belgian team attacked to try to win the race off him), Jan Smolík, Alexey Petrov, Hans-Joachim Hartnick, Bernd Drogan, Olaf Ludwig, Piotr Ugrumov, Uwe Raab and Jan Svorada in the Peace Race.\n\nThe West Germans had better chance to show off in the dying embers of the Cold War though; in 1987, after Uwe Ampler won his first Friedensfahrt in the edition which featured that Harrachov ITT, the West Germans could boast that they had the biggest game in town in town - the Tour de France featured its Grand Départ in West Berlin, with Jelle Nijdam winning a prologue, before a short road stage won by Nico Verhoeven and then a TTT the same afternoon won by the Carrera Jeans team of eventual race winner Stephen Roche. The road stage was particularly notable as Lech Piasecki, second in the prologue, inherited the maillot jaune after getting into a late escape, and became the first Ostbloc rider to do so, having been traded to the west in exchange for new bicycles and tech by the Poles after his dominant 1985 season, and meaning he became the first - and only - man to ever wear the yellow jersey in both East and West Berlin.\n\nStage 2: Cottbus - Bastei, 212km\n\nGPM:\n\nLoschwitzer Berg (cat.3) 2,2km @ 7,2%\n\nBorsberg (cat.3) 3,0km @ 7,3%\n\nPfaffenberg (cat.3) 2,3km @ 8,6%\n\nTiefer Grund (cat.3) 3,0km @ 4,8%\n\nHockstein (cat.3) 2,1km @ 5,4%\n\nAfter a transfer southeastwards to the bottom corner of Brandenburg, we are on familiar cycling terrain here. Cottbus passed into legend as the turn-around point in the middle of the iconic Berlin-Cottbus-Berlin one day race, a sort of Eastern Milano-Sanremo which ran since the 1920s and featured among its winners the likes of Erich Schulz, Lothar Meister II, Rainer Marks, Andreas Petermann, Olaf Ludwig, Uwe Raab, and record victor Martin Götze, a one-day specialist who won the race on three occasions, including the final edition in 1989. It was also one of the races won by Wolfgang Lötzsch when he was allowed to return to competition in the mid 1980s; he had been formally barred from competition since 1979 and informally barred for several years prior to that, due to a combination of his reluctance to become a member of the SED and his apparent contacts with the west (he was a cousin of Dieter Wiedemann, who defected several years prior); with his ostracization being so complete that when he won the Olympic trials other riders were forbidden from standing on the podium with him. His blacklisting also included being thrown out of all of the state sports programs and even a prison sentence, but upon his return to competition in 1983 he - in front of a huge televised audience - broke away over 100km from home and soloed in to win the Rund um Berlin by over eight minutes, and then went on to several major victories. Support for Wolfgang Lötzsch was an informal way of voicing opposition, and he became a major cause célèbre in East German sport. A documentary was made about his fight, part of which is available here, and he remains even more of a \"what if?\" story in cycling history than the other legends of behind the curtain.\n\nSportfreunde Lötzsch\n\nCottbus is also the informal centre of Lower Sorbian culture, for it was the Sorbs who first settled this area back in the 10th Century. Its name among the remaining Sorbs is Chóśebuz, although it is worth noting that Lower Sorbian is very moribund and very few Sorbian-speakers remain in Cottbus itself, although there are around 7.000 speakers of the language remaining in the towns and villages surrounding it; neighbouring Upper Sorbian is more vibrant, with around 13.000 native-speakers and 60.000 overall speakers, and Bautzen is a much more proactive host of Sorbian culture despite being a much smaller city - or perhaps because of it. There is, however, bilingual signage in Cottbus and protected status for the local minority language, although it is seldom heard.\n\nThe city has had very little involvement in the Deutschland Tour; due to the lengthy stages of the pre-war era and its proximity to Berlin (notwithstanding that Germany spread further eastward in those days) it only featured once before the partition, that being a stage in 1939 won by the Dutch future track world champion Gerrit Schulte, and never in the rebirth of the race following reunification. It did feature commonly in the DDR-Rundfahrt, particularly in the early 1970s when it would host multiple stages in and around the city, and was introduced to the Friedensfahrt in 1955, with Czech legend Jan Vesely winning the stage. The last 'golden age' Peace Race, 1989's edition, featured a finish in the city, won by Uwe Raab, but by then perestroika was in full effect; Cottbus remained loyal, hosting the race a couple of times as it gasped for breath in its dying days - Steffen Wesemann winning a stage there in 1996, and an ITT in 1999, with Olaf Pollack also winning a road stage the same year. Cycling hasn't seen the city since 2009, however, when it hosted the German national championships, with a lot of local knowledge coming in handy when young Cottbusser Martin Reimer took the road race, Bert Grabsch - in the rainbow jersey - narrowly defeated a young local boy called Tony Martin in the ITT, and another local rider, Trixi Worrack, won the women's ITT too.\n\nYes, that's right - strangely despite its focal nature in one of the biggest bike races of the Ostbloc, Cottbus had a peripheral status as a base for cyclists in the DDR, and only towards the tail end of the Republic produced any significant talents - two-time world champion in the 1km TT Jens Glücklich is perhaps the most notable - but since then, it has emerged as a hotbed of talent. Eldest among the post-Wende cycling talents is Trixi Worrack, a former World Champion many times in the TTT and one of the most respected workers in the women's péloton, having bounced around top level teams for 15 years despite even having had to have a kidney removed following a particularly nasty accident. Then there's Daniel Musiol, winner of the KOM at the last Deutschlandtour until its ASO-led reboot; former points race world champion Stephanie Gaumnitz (née Pohl); surprise national champion and short-lived durable sprinter/classics prospect Martin Reimer; World and Olympic bronze medallist paracyclist Jana Majunke; super sprint prospect and splendidly-named talent Willi Willwohl, forced to retire before his career could ever get going through health problems; and Tour de l'Avenir and Olympia's Tour stage winner, Max Kanter, who has started a pro career with Sunweb this season.\n\nThe first part of the stage is a perfectly flat southwestward roll along the border between the Spreewald and the Lausitzer Seenland, a scenic area of artificial lakes created out of the former lignite quarries that powered the DDR and helped give it its unique, drab, grey-brown hue in our mind's eyes. We stop off in Senftenberg, which I dealt with in my Lausitz-Rundfahrt back in the early days of the thread (I should probably give that another go some time), and then Elsterwerda, home of surprise 1983 Peace Race winner Falk Boden. Boden was rather usurped in importance in DDR cycling throughout the rest of the 1980s by his more illustrious compatriots Olaf Ludwig, Uwe Ampler, Uwe Raab, and also slightly less celebrated names like Olaf Jentzsch and Jan Schur - however he turned pro with PDM like them, and in 1991 became the first national champion of a united Germany. I already dealt with Elsterwerda, and with Boden himself, in my Friedensfahrt recently, so I shan't go into further depth here.\n\nAt around the halfway point in the stage we turn back to the southeast, and this takes place in the city of Meißen. A modestly-sized city of just under 30.000 inhabitants, Meißen is famous for two things: firstly, porcelain; and secondly, the German language. Bear with me here: when Martin Luther was translating the bible into the vernacular, he needed a comparatively neutral dialect, as the varieties of the German language throughout the country were wildly differing. Luther himself being from Thüringen, he had a fairly central dialect which had higher mutual intelligibility with a larger number of dialects than had he spoken, say, broad Boarisch or Plattdüütsch. \"Meißnisch\" is the name of the particular dialect within the Thüringen-Obersachsen area, named after the city, and so in time, the dialect of Meißen became the basis of the modern German standard language. This even has a crazy reflection in \"Missingsch\", a bastardized version of the standard language with various Low German inflections, words and pronunciations which has displaced actual Low German in parts of Niedersachsen. There are some nice short climbs - some of which cobbled - in the city, but here it's just the feedzone, we're leaving that for the time being.\n\nInstead, we head on to Dresden, for our second intermediate sprint (I have decided to incentivise moves by having no fewer than three bonus sprints with 3, 2 and 1 bonus seconds) in the picturesque rebuilt old city. Dresden is of course where I started my last Deutschlandtour, and apart from the FIS instituting a round of the XC Skiing World Cup since then (with an awful \"sprint + team sprint\" calendar) little has changed in the city. The sprint is on Altmarkt at the heart of the city. We then head to the course of the cross-country skiing and cross the Elbe at the Schillerdenkmal into Loschwitz, a village which has been swallowed by Neu-Dresden. And then, the climbing begins, and the classics specialists can come to the fore.\n\nThat's right, it's a 2,2km, 7,2% monstrosity which is mostly cobbled. The start is on Calberlastraße, which you can see there, which has mis-shapen, mis-aligned and otherwise just horrible cobbles. This gives way to better-aligned, more 'normal' cobbles on Robert-Diez-Straße, but that just means the gradient ramps up - this is the profile of the overall climb, but as you can see - 300m at 15%+ in the middle which is the end of the cobbles. This section is on streetview if you want to take a look. I used this back in my second Peace Race all the way back in 2014, as a penultimate climb of the day; here it is the first - and the first to give out points at all, which could be interesting. It is 70km from home, too, so the pace shouldn't be too brutal. After this we continue on the plateau a bit before descending back to the banks of the Elbe, before climbing the Borsberg, another cobbled killer, which consists of 1km at 12% on cobbles - including ramps of up to 17% - before 2km at 4,5% on tarmac, but woefully inconsistent and including ramps up to 21%. This climb famously hosted a \"MTT\" in the Peace Race which was won by Anatoly Starkov, just ahead of Ryzard Szurkowski who had won the morning flat TT, so Szurkowski was awarded the overall stage win for the day. I used it in the TT for stage 1 of my last Deutschland Tour. With 57km remaining it won't decide who wins but it might "
