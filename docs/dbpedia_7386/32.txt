Poiree said that she had taken the decision to call it quits after consulting with team trainer Odd Lirhus and team physician Lars Kolsrud.

The decision does not come as a huge surprise as the wife of current men's biathlon champion Raphael Poiree, exhausted following a bout mononucleosis, had already announced her forfeit for the world cup finals in Siberia, due to start on the 17th March.

37th in the world championship sprint, the current world cup champion chose not take part in the pursuit race or the 15 km events at Hochfilzen.

"There is no point in sitting down and crying. I would rather look forward to the Torino Olympics and I will be in top form there," Poiree told the press.

In the Norway relay team, the current world champions, she will be replaced by her cousin Ann Kristin Flatland.

The quartet is completed by Linda Tjoernhom, Gro Istad-Kristiansen and Tora Berger.

The Norwegian team will defend their 4 x 6 km world championships crown at Hochfilzen on Friday at 14:15cet - live on eurosport.com!
