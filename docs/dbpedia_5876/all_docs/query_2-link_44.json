        "text": "Michael Connelly\n\nFind books by Michael Connelly (click here)\n\nFind eBooks by Michael Connelly (click here)\n\nFind eAudiobooks by Michael Connelly (click here)\n\nMichael Connelly‘s cunningly plotted mysteries blend realistic police procedurals with the forlorn heroism of classic hardboiled fiction. Protagonist Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch — named for a Renaissance painter of hellish scenes — is burdened by his own painful origins. Connelly portrays Bosch as a maverick hero whose vision of justice means that “everybody counts or nobody counts.” Thriller and suspense fans will find that Connelly‘s plots hit the ground running: full of shocking twists, climactic build-up, and often violent confrontations, Connelly ultimately allows characters to carve meaning out of darkness — if they live. Start with: The Black Echo.\n\nGenre:Mysteries; Police procedurals\n\nCharacter:Brooding; Courageous\n\nStoryline:Intricately plotted\n\nPace:Fast-paced\n\nTone:Atmospheric; Bleak; Suspenseful\n\nWriting Style:Gritty\n\nIf you like Michael Connelly, then here is a list of similar authors\n\n(To go to the full list in NoveList Plus, click here)\n\n1. Barre, Richard\n\nReason: Connelly and Richard Barre both evoke urban settings where world-weary protagonists wrestle personal demons while chasing down un-righted wrongs and cracking unsolved cases. Is Barre’s take less optimistic–or simply more realistic–than Connelly’s? Readers will have to decide for themselves. — Kim Burton\n\n2. Rankin, Ian\n\nReason: Connelly and Rankin produce gripping stories of investigators whose tenacious, hard-living, hard-working qualities are matched only by their resistance to authority. Their fiercely independent heroes whose obsession with justice comes at great personal cost feature in police Mysteries with complex plots, psychological depth, harsh realism and a touch of wistful poetry. — Katherine Johnson\n\n3. Turow, Scott\n\nReason: Connelly’s fans might like Scott Turow’s novels for their vivid characterizations, complex and provocative plots, investigative details, and realistic dialog, though Turow’s are generally lighter in tone. — Ellen Guerci\n\n4. Child, Lee\n\nReason: Child’s Jack Reacher, with his military background, keen intelligence, and obscure past, is a hero similar to Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch, despite the fact that he lives entirely off the grid and works outside the law. Child’s intelligent writing an complex plots will also appeal, as will Reacher’s strong moral code. — Shauna Griffin\n\n5. Sandford, John\n\nReason: John Sandford rivals Connelly for grim tone and depressing circumstances. Any of Sandford’s Suspense and Mystery novels should appeal to Connelly fans for their grit, violence, and fast pace. — Krista Biggs\n\n6. Pelecanos, George P.\n\nReason: Fans of Michael Connelly’s gritty and intricate mysteries will want to try the hard-boiled fiction of George P. Pelecanos. Both authors feature detectives who are doggedly thorough and relentless in their pursuit of fairness. — Victoria Caplinger\n\n7. Kellerman, Jonathan\n\nReason: Both Kellerman and Connelly set their gritty and suspenseful crime series in a darkly drawn and atmospheric Los Angeles. Investigative techniques, vividly-drawn characters, complex and twisted story lines, and building suspense characterize both series. — Joyce Saricks\n\n8. Larsson, Stieg\n\nReason: Although Stieg Larsson’s intricately plotted, character-driven mysteries are set in Sweden, fans of American crime novelist Michael Connelly will appreciate Larsson’s flawed but heroic characters and suspenseful, twist-filled stories. — NoveList Contributor\n\n9. Eccles, Marjorie\n\nReason: Michael Connelly writes well plotted, gritty, fast-paced mysteries. Readers who enjoy his novels might try Marjorie Eccles, whose mysteries, though historical, share the same dark, atmospheric feel and fast pace. — Nanci Milone Hill\n\nSeries by Michael Connelly"
