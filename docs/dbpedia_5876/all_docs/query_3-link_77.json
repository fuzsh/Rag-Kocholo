The story follows the life of a young American woman, Emily, who moves to Japan to teach English and escape her troubled past. However, she soon finds herself drawn into the world of Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, when she begins a relationship with a charming and enigmatic gangster, Kenji. As Emily becomes more entangled in Kenji's world, she discovers that his boss, the feared and powerful Kizaki, has a dangerous obsession with her.
