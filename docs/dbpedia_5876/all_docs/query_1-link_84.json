        "text": "Ask any enthusiast of American crime novels about favorite authors and sooner or later the name Michael Connelly will pop up.\n\nConnelly whose 20th book, The Brass Verdict, was released Tuesday makes his first trip to Columbus Monday to appear on the Thurber House \"Evenings With Authors\" series.\n\nNo doubt he'll give fans insight into the book's protagonists, half bothers Harry Bosch, the flawed detective who stars in most of Connelly's novels, and Mickey Haller, the Los Angeles attorney who does business from his Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFrom his years spent as a journalist working the crime beat for the Los Angeles Times, Connelly had plenty of background and contacts to draw on for Bosch. Then, when it came time to research the life of an attorney, a seat at Dodger Stadium proved fortuitous. Connelly found himself next to David Ogden, a Los Angeles County lawyer who practiced out of his car. The Lincoln Lawyer was born.\n\nConnelly's next books are In the Shadow of the Master, an anthology of Edgar Allan Poe stories accompanied by essays by contemporary mystery writers (Dec. 23) and the novel The Scarecrow, starring journalist Jack McEvoy (May 26).\n\nThe author, 52, recently spoke to The Dispatch.\n\nQ: Is The Brass Verdict the first of more novels that will feature both Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch?\n\nA: Most likely. I don't have anything planned but obviously (The Brass Verdict) has set the stage for them to continue this awkward relationship On the pages where they're together, those were the pages I liked to write the most.\n\nQ: Both Harry and Mickey age in your novels. How's that working out?\n\nA: The Harry Bosch stuff is aged in real time. Maybe it was a foolish move, but at the time I didn't know I'd be writing about him for years. All the books are set in the year when they're published. That's one of things I do so I have to live with it There's at least 15 years difference in their ages. Harry was born in 1950. It says so in the book, so I have to live with that. He's 58 now. In The Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller was about 5 or 6 when his father diedabout 1971-72.\n\nQ: Will you ever kill off Harry?\n\nA: I don't think I'll kill him off. I deal in metaphors as a writer and I've given him a tortured past. I kind of feel he's going for the light at the end of the tunnel. You might see him in a limited role, but I want something good to happen for him.\n\nQ: Do you have plans to start another mystery or crime series, maybe with a new protagonist?\n\nA: Sort of I have little seeds planted in a lot of books that would allow me to go to different areas: the new partner in the last Bosch book (The Overlook), and Harry has a daughter. I'm going to write a book next year that focuses on his relationship with his daughter. She could take over.\n\nQ: You've written about how you came to read To Kill a Mockingbird as a 12-year-old. Can you describe your enthusiasm for that book?\n\nA: I know it's considered the great American novel as it rightly should be. But it also hits all the points that you should have in a great legal thriller: the protagonist-lawyer doing what he thinks is right, going up river against what others think is the right thing. When a character is willing to risk all that for an ideal, that creates a certain momentum in a story that I think tips it into the area of a thriller. We all think that thrillers are synonymous with fast-moving momentum and there's that sort of momentum in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nQ: For fans of your books who haven't read it, the red Mickey Haller/Hieronymus Bosch mini book provides revelatory background on each character. Where can readers get copies?\n\nA: We've been calling that the duo bio. Otto Penzler, the owner of the Mysterious Bookshop in New York published thatIt came out of people asking so many detailed questions about the characters. Most people, even though they like the momentum of these books, have a lot of questions about the characters who they are and where they came from A nicer version of the book will be published and we'll give away 1,500 of them from my Web site. (www.michaelconnelly.com)\n\nQ: In the Shadow of the Master, which you compiled and edited, combines Edgar Allan Poe stories with essays by contemporary crime or mystery writers. Is Poe the great American crime writer and why has he been such an inspiration to those who followed?\n\nA: He's credited as the father of the genre. Some people debate if he actually wrote the first mystery story, but he certainly put it on the map. You can see the derivatives in almost everything on television, in the movies. The Mystery Writers of America, by taking him as their figurehead, have also helped keep that idea alive.\n\nQ: The essay writers include Stephen King, Sue Grafton, Lisa Scottoline, Joseph Wambaugh, Sara Paretsky and more. How did you select them?\n\nA: There was a three tier criteria: a. the writer was a winner of an Edgar Award, b.) the writer was a best-selling author, or c.) the writer was an accredited master of the short story. I think everyone in it is at least two of those three.)\n\nThe most difficult part was asking people. I would say the most famous is Stephen KingI knew when I got him, everybody else would want to be in the book.\n\nQ: The group is almost a who's who of great mystery or crime writers.\n\nA: Yes, there's quite a few on there, especially Joseph Wambaugh, who's kind of like my mentor who I never knew until later. When I was deciding to be a writer, I discovered Wambaugh. Wambaugh and Raymond Chandler were the two major writers I was reading the cop novel and the crime novel.\n\nQ: Do you have a favorite Poe story?\n\nA: Well, I wrote about The House of Usher. I had read it when I was younger and reread it when I was doing researchThe idea is how important metaphor is and the use of it in that book, which I totally didn't get when I was 13, but I totally get it now.\n\nQ: Does the American literary community value the crime novel to the degree it should?\n\nA: I don't have a complaint about how the crime novel is viewed. It's largely responsible for keeping book publishing in business. I think it garners professional respect from the business angle. I think more and more, and this is a sad state of affairs it's harder and harder to write a story or a book about American society that doesn't have crime in it. In contemporary publishing, people are seeing that the crime novel does have the ability to reflect what's happening in our society.\n\nAnd it's almost routine that if you're writing crime novels, you're writing faster. The crime novel is poised to make comments on what's happening right now in society."
