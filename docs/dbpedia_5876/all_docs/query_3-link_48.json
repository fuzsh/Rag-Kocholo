        "text": "Disputes between authors and publishers are not uncommon, especially when it comes to marketing and publicity efforts. But rarely does an author make a preemptive move, and pull his book before a publisher has a chance to publish it. Which is why thriller author Steve Hamilton's move to end his relationship with longtime publisher St. Martin's Press has highlighted a growing issue in the business: Are traditional publishers doing enough to support established authors?\n\nOn Tuesday it emerged that St. Martin's imprint Minotaur Books was canceling Hamilton's October-slated novel, The Second Life of Nick Mason. The sudden move, for a book with strong word-of-mouth, seemed odd. St. Martin's issued a terse statement saying only that, \"after many years\" of publishing Hamilton, it \"had a parting of ways\" with the author.\n\nHamilton and his agent, Shane Salerno, said the publisher's comment was deeply misleading and, contrary to what SMP implied, it was Hamilton who chose to end the relationship. The reason? A lackluster plan from SMP to promote The Second Life of Nick Mason.\n\nA two time Edgar-winner, Hamilton, who has been at SMP for 17 years, said the publisher's statement \"wasn’t right factually, and it wasn’t right in principle, not after such a long relationship.\" He added: \"This was my decision and mine alone. And any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Second Life of Nick Mason, which follows an ex-con unwillingly plunged back into the underworld of Chicago crime after he's sprung from prison, had received a starred review from Publishers Weekly. (Now that the book has been shelved, that review will not be running.) The book also received blurbs from, among others, Michael Connelly, Lee Child and Don Winslow. Additionally, SMP had said that it was planning a 75,000-copy first announced printing. It also claimed, in galleys, to be committed to a number of major marketing efforts, such as a national author tour for Hamilton, and a national ad campaign for the book.\n\nHamilton, however, said none of those claims are true. \"There was no national campaign,\" he wrote via email. \"None at all.\" Staying with his publisher, given what they were doing, was unthinkable, he added. \"The catastrophe that would have transpired for a book with extraordinary advance reviews would have been unfair to me, to my book, and to every bookseller.\"\n\nWhen asked about the statements made about the supposed marketing plans for the book, SMP again declined to comment. However, it is an open secret in the publishing industry that claims made on galleys and other material for the trade--about everything from first printings to marketing budgets and efforts--can be gross exaggerations. This fact has begun to spread beyond the confines of the industry, though, as more authors and industry experts take to the Internet with posts about the realities of what Big Five publishers actually do for most authors on the marketing front.\n\nFor Hamilton, the focus now is on getting a new publisher. His exit from SMP was negotiated by attorney Richard B. Heller of Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz (who also worked on Janet Evanovich's 2010 departure from the house). Having paid SMP a sum to cover his advances on four books, along with delivery and acceptance fees on the first book, Hamilton and his agent are now fielding offers on print rights for The Second Life of Nick Mason, as well as film rights.\n\n\"In the end, I just want to work with a publisher who’s passionate about my work, and who has a real plan for reaching the widest possible audience,\" Hamitlon said. \"That’s all I’ve ever wanted. But I didn't feel like any of that was in place at St. Martin’s Press, or that it ever would be.\"\n\nand four days later this:\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Prize-winning crime writer Steve Hamilton has a new publisher just days after leaving St. Martin's Press over what he cited as lack of support.\n\nHamilton has a four-book deal with G.P. Putnam's Sons, the publisher told The Associated Press on Thursday. Hamilton's \"The Second Life of Nick Mason,\" originally scheduled for release this fall by the St. Martin's imprint Minotaur, will come out in the middle of 2016.\n\nEarlier this week, Hamilton had startled the book world by breaking with St. Martin's, his longtime publisher, and openly criticizing it for not properly backing \"The Second Life of Nick Mason,\" the debut of a series featuring an ex-convict trying to break from his criminal past. Authors have long complained about lack of attention from their publishers, but it's rare for one to leave at the start of a multi-book deal and so soon before a novel's release.\n\nMore than 10 publishers \"aggressively\" pursued a contract with Hamilton, according to his literary agent, Shane Salerno.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed by the response to my decision to leave St. Martin's and grateful to have had so many passionate publishers pursuing my work,\" Hamilton said in a statement issued by Putnam, which is part of Penguin Group USA.\n\nThe Nick Mason novel was supposed to have been the first of a four-book deal reached last year with St. Martin's. In a highly unusual step, Salerno said he paid nearly $250,000 to get the author out of his contract (authors traditionally absorb the cost). Salerno added that the deal with Putnam was for substantially more than the near-seven figures Hamilton was to have received from St. Martin's.\n\nSalerno, who besides being a literary agent is a screenwriter, filmmaker and author who in 2013 released a widely publicized documentary and book about J.D. Salinger, said Hamilton did not have the money on hand to buy out the contract himself. He added that he wanted Hamilton \"to be completely free of St. Martin's\" and able to find an enthusiastic publisher \"who would support his work.\"\n\nSt. Martin's issued a statement this week saying that \"After many years of publishing Steve Hamilton, unfortunately SMP has had a parting of the ways and will not be moving forward with the publication of 'The Second Life of Nick Mason.' We wish Steve all the best with his new series and his future endeavors.\"\n\nSt. Martin's spokeswoman Tracey Guest said Thursday that the publisher had no additional comment.\n\nHamilton, 54, is a respected and popular author known for his 10 Alex McKnight books. In 1999, his McKnight book \"A Cold Day In Paradise\" won an Edgar Award, presented by the Mystery Writers of America, for best first novel. Hamilton's \"The Lock Artist\" won the Edgar in 2011 for the best book overall.\n\nHamilton's contract with Putnam calls for two McKnight novels and two Nick Mason novels. \"The Second Life of Nick Mason\" has received early blurbs from Harlan Coben, Don Winslow and Michael Connelly and was listed by Publishers Weekly as one of the fall's most anticipated books.\n\n\"With two Edgars to his name and story-telling chops to beat the band, we're convinced readers will love his new character Nick Mason, and our whole team's aim and focus will be to bring him to a much larger audience,\" Putnam president Ivan Held, who along with editor Sara Minnich acquired the book for the publisher, said in a statement."
