        "text": "Click on the banner to follow the tour\n\nPrice of Justice\n\nby Alan Brenham\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBLURB:\n\nHis focus is on solving the murders—until the unthinkable happens…\n\nRecently widowed, Austin Police Detective Jason Scarsdale works to solve the murders of two pedophiles, while trying to be both mother and father to his five-year-old daughter. During his investigation, Scarsdale is forced to navigate between the crosshairs of two police commanders out to get him. Drawn to Austin Police Crime Analyst, Dani Mueller, who has also suffered tragedy, Scarsdale fights both his attraction and his suspicions that something just isn’t right…\n\nShe is hiding a secret, one that could not only cost her a job—it could end her life…\n\nDani hides a deadly past. After her daughter was brutally murdered, Dani exacted her revenge then changed her name and fled to Austin. But if her secret ever gets out, she knows there is no place she can hide from the murderer’s vicious family.\n\nPulled into a web of malice and deceit, Scarsdale and Dani discover the value of breaking the rules. Then just when they thought things couldn’t get worse…they do.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy Review:\n\nIs there such a thing as second chances? Only if you’re willing to make the decision to go for it. This is a really good crime/mystery/thriller that is heart-wrenching in places. Dani’s daughter not only died but was murdered in the most heinous way (not graphically spelled out but you get the gist of what happened to her), which is enough to send any mom over the edge. Dani has stepped over the line and is trying to figure out how to turn around and step back. Jason is a single parent who also knows about loss, as his wife was killed in a car accident only a short while before. Jason and Dani meet through work – he’s a detective and she’s an analyst. Jason is trying to find a pedophile and needs Dani’s help to figure out who it might be.\n\nI really enjoyed the plot and the story. It is very gritty, real – you get a really good sense of Jason’s emotional turmoil. He is definitely going through a lot. There is nothing graphic in this story but you do get a good sense of what has taken place. Dani is really a complex character, she reacted to a dark situation and now not only has to deal with the consequences but it now threatens her life. I absolutely loved Shannon. I really enjoyed this, it kept me interested and intrigued as to where it was going to go. Definitely some interesting twists.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nExcerpt:\n\nScarsdale trudged into the courthouse, flashing his badge so he could bypass security. He stopped at the rear of a throng of people maneuvering to get an elevator. He checked to see where the four elevators were—one was stopped on floor three, another just arrived at the fifth floor and two seemed stuck on Eight. People elbowed their way closer to the doors—even he got jostled. A distinct odor of alcohol, mixed with cheap perfume and a trace of marihuana, made him sneeze a couple of times.\n\nLooking around, Scarsdale didn’t recognize anyone connected with his dreaded hearing. He leaned against the wall and let his thoughts drift. The events of the past five years flashed through his mind. The wedding Marcy refused to attend. Then Charity’s funeral—the second time Marcy had seen Shannon since she was born—gushing over her granddaughter, telling Shannon how much she missed her. Scarsdale stopped outside the big wooden courtroom doors. He stared at the brass door handles. What will the judge decide?\n\nHis heart hammered against his chest. Taking a couple of deep breaths and swallowing hard, he pulled the courtroom doors open.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn Author’s Journey Through Reading to Writing\n\n1. When did you start to read?\n\nWhenever my maternal grandfather came for a visit, he read a lot of stories to me when I was little. Having enjoyed it so much, I couldn’t wait to be able to read on my own. The first on-my-own venture into reading came when I was in elementary school, reading beginner books (other than my older brother’s comic books).\n\n2. What was the first book you remember reading? What was the first book that had a real “wow” factor for you?\n\nAccording to my mother, when I was a child, I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. But the very first book I remember reading (it was a long time ago) was a science book in school – third or fourth grade, I think.\n\nFor me, a book with a real “wow” factor would be a book I couldn’t put down – one that when I did finish it, I had to re-read it right away. The first book with a “wow” factor that I recall, would have been Tom Clancy’s Red Tide Rising.\n\n3. What attracted you to or got you started reading?\n\nMy grandfather would read stories to me when he came to visit. I’m not sure if the stories were so fascinating or it was the way he told them that made me get started reading. After that, it was like the Lay’s Potato Chip commercial – I couldn’t stop with reading just one.\n\n4. What genres (topics) have you read? Was there a progression to the genres you’ve read over the years? Did you start in one genre and then discover others the older you got?\n\nI’ve read about every genre I could find over the years: military, thriller, mystery, horror, fantasy, scifi, even a romance book or two. My first genre interest was military – Tom Clancy; this changed to mysteries after my older brother joined the Galveston, Tx, police – Joseph Wambaugh, and maybe a Michael Connelly book. After law school, my genre interest broadened to scifi, horror and fantasy.\n\n5. Who are your favorite authors today? What types of books do you like to read today?\n\nMy favorite authors are many: Michael Connelly, John Sandford, Michael McGarrity, John Grisham, Andrea Kane, John Lescroart, and Jeffery Deaver. I mainly read crime mysteries and legal thrillers although I will not hesitate to turn pages in a good Star-Trek type of scifi or horror book with vampires and werewolves.\n\n6. What do you like in a story? What does it have to have for you to grab it?\n\nI like stories with imperfect protagonists facing daunting challenges. I want to read about them making wrong choices and having to “right the ship” against antagonist characters or events that turn their life upside down – kind of a “let’s see how you’re going to get out his mess”.\n\n7. What got you started with writing? And how long have you been writing?\n\nI’d like to say writing book reports in high school got me started but I hated doing them. Probably my start came writing police offense reports in the 70’s – I was basically telling a story – a non-fictional one – about a character(s) who suffered loss of some kind, a theft or something much worse. Now, I’ve been writing crime fiction for the past four years.\n\n8. What do you like to write about?\n\nSince I’ve been involved in investigating, prosecuting, and, later defending criminal cases, writing about them seems a logical (and enjoyable) evolution. My wife is after me to broaden my genre-writing to include crime fiction with a scifi and/or fantasy tilt.\n\n9. What are you currently working on?\n\nI’ve finished the first draft of Rampage, the sequel to Price of Justice. For Detective Scarsdale, it’s a story about overcoming temptation and a serious threat to his job security. No character is safe.\n\n10. What inspired the plot for your current novel?\n\nWe all deal with temptation in one form or another. A lot of cases I worked both as an officer and as an attorney dealt with temptation, retaliation and violent responses to it. A couple officers in the department where I worked fell prey to it and lost their jobs. So I created a plotline that incorporated these transgressions.\n\n11. Anything else you’d like to share?\n\nI want to learn more about the writing craft so I plan on attending the DFW Writers Conference in July to network with other authors and meet agents.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAUTHOR Bio and Links:\n\nAlan Brenham is the pseudonym of Alan Behr, an American author and attorney.
