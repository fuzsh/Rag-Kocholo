        "text": "Lest\n\nreaders think that Joseph Wambaugh has gone ornithologist on them,\n\nHollywood Crows are not winged creatures flying through the fabled\n\nentertainment community of Los Angeles. Crows is an acronym for\n\n“community relations officers” of the Los Angeles\n\nPolice Department, ombudsmen and liaisons in the community. Given\n\nits sordid history, no other law enforcement agency in America\n\nneeds the efforts of this group more than the LAPD.\n\nWambaugh has chronicled the lives of police officers for the past\n\nfour decades. His first book, THE NEW CENTURIONS, was both\n\ncritically acclaimed and a bestseller. His early novels were\n\npublished while he continued to serve as a Los Angeles police\n\ndetective. The combination of successful author and working cop led\n\nto some unusual circumstances that one might expect in crazy\n\nCalifornia. \"I would have guys in handcuffs asking me for\n\nautographs,\" he was said to have remarked.\n\nThe modern police officers portrayed skillfully in novels by\n\nauthors such as Michael Connelly and George Pelecanos, and on the\n\nsmall screen in countless variations of “Law &\n\nOrder” and in HBO’s critically acclaimed “The\n\nWire,” can trace their beginnings back to Wambaugh.\n\nHe was one of the first writers to recognize that police officers\n\nhave personal lives and often face pressure similar to most\n\nmiddle-class Americans. But these difficulties are often\n\nexacerbated by the fact that they confront crime and danger on the\n\njob. Wambaugh’s books humanize police officers and their work\n\nwith humor and grace; his popularity has changed crime fiction and\n\ngiven it a legitimacy that it lacked previously.\n\nHOLLYWOOD CROWS, Wambaugh’s latest work of fiction, follows\n\nhis traditional plot structure of introducing readers to both\n\nhard-working police officers who truly care about their job and\n\nunthinking bureaucratic officers who seem incapable of working\n\nintelligently or innovatively at any level. It is clear that\n\nWambaugh longs for a different era in police life, when officers\n\nhad more independence to perform their jobs. At the same time,\n\nhowever, he recognizes that many of the changes in police work are\n\nthe result of lapses in judgment and professional malfeasance by\n\npolice departments.\n\nOf course Wambaugh’s novels would be incomplete without the\n\nother side of the law enforcement equation: the law breaker. One of\n\nthe genuine endearing qualities of his wrongdoers is that they are\n\nnot evil, mean geniuses plotting to destroy mankind. Instead they\n\nare generally inept crooks who often end up caught because of their\n\nown stupidity rather than through expert police work. That is the\n\nway it generally happens in the real world --- most bad guys catch\n\nthemselves. If they were smart, they would have jobs with major\n\ncorporations where they could steal far more than they can on the\n\nstreet.\n\nHOLLYWOOD CROWS introduces readers to surfer cops, appropriately\n\nnicknamed Flotsam and Jetsam, and to female officers Cat Song and\n\nRonnie Sinclair. The obligatory hardened veteran officer, Bix\n\nRamstead, represents the contrast between modern police officers\n\nand those who served in a different era, when police work was the\n\njob of white males. Throughout the novel, audiences are reminded of\n\nthe difference between the modern police department and police work\n\nexemplified by Jack Webb in “Dragnet.” As Wambaugh\n\ndetails the daily experiences of the contemporary officer, he lets\n\nreaders decide if society has benefited from the modernization of\n\nits law enforcement community.\n\nHOLLYWOOD CROWS reinforces a point that police officers in both\n\nfiction and real life know all too well --- domestic quarrels can\n\nbe the most dangerous aspect of police work. The ongoing divorce of\n\nstrip club operator Ali Aziz and his beautiful wife Margot will\n\nentrap and ensnare several in devious criminal activity. Many years\n\nago a wise judge once told me that he preferred hearing criminal\n\ntrials to divorce matters because “you meet a better class of\n\npeople in criminal cases.” That observation is reflected in\n\nthe distasteful details of the domestic battle between Ali and\n\nMargot. The couple has gone to war over custody of their son, and\n\nboth combatants will do just about anything to win that struggle.\n\nMargot will use beauty, sexuality and her ability to manipulate\n\nmen, while Ali will turn to his many connections with the criminal\n\nelement of Los Angeles.\n\nWhile domestic strife is the major storyline in HOLLYWOOD CROWS,\n\nWambaugh has numerous additional plot threads throughout the novel.\n\nSome center on the personal lives of the officers --- including\n\nthat of Nathan “Hollywood Nate” Weiss --- and their\n\ninteraction with a community that has come to Los Angeles from\n\nevery corner of the world. Others view the ongoing struggle of many\n\nmembers of an urban society to simply exist in a frantic and often\n\nunsympathetic social atmosphere. How the new multicultural police\n\nforce interacts with those citizens in disputes that run from minor\n\nquarrels to major crimes serves as a backdrop of the book."
