I am consulted on shooting locations and often decide where we will shoot the scene. Before each season the show runner (boss) Eric Overmyer and I have sat down and decided which books to draw from and then we have hammered out an outline for the whole season. So I think the only way I could have more influence and input is if I were to play Harry Bosch!"
