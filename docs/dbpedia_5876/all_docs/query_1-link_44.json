        "text": "Many years ago, in a magazine interview, Richard Price (now the author of nine novels, including “Clockers” and “Lush Life”) was asked why he devoted so much of his considerable literary talent to crime fiction and film scripts featuring criminals. He responded by saying that when you circle around a murder long enough you get to know a city. I cut that line out of the magazine and taped it above my computer screen. For several years, it presided over what I wrote in my own novels. With that answer, I believed that Price had crystallized what many writers knew and attempted to practice. That is, he considered the crime novel something more than a puzzle and an entertainment; he saw it as societal reflection, documentation and investigation.\n\nToday, perhaps more so than when Price first answered that question, this supposition holds true. With controversial deaths at the hands of the police drawing attention and protest from coast to coast, with cops being ambushed on the streets and with law officers turning their backs to elected officials at the subsequent funerals, the issue of how we police ourselves and the consequences of departmental procedures draw great scrutiny and debate everywhere, including the pages of crime fiction.\n\nAnd Richard Price is still circling.\n\nWritten under the pen name Harry Brandt, his new novel, “The Whites,” is as much an entertaining story as it is an examination of the job of policing. It’s a job that’s difficult to do right. It’s even more difficult to do safely — especially when you try to prevent it from slowly hollowing out the holder of the badge. The novel posits a simple axiom: Those who go into darkness as a matter of course and duty bring some measure of darkness back into themselves. How to keep it from spreading like a cancer, eating at your humanity, is the police officer’s eternal struggle.\n\nIt’s this struggle that Brandt places at the heart of his storytelling. Another great so-called crime novelist, Joseph Wambaugh, has said that the best crime novels aren’t about how cops work cases, they’re about how cases work cops. This holds true, with fervor, in “The Whites.”"
