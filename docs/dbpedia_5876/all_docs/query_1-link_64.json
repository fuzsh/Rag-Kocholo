        "text": "A fan of crime novels, the former police commissioner and the author, with Peter Knobler, of a new memoir, “The Profession,” loves Michael Connelly’s hero Harry Bosch — but adds, “I don’t have a favorite villain.”\n\nWhat books are on your night stand?\n\nAt any given time I’m reading three or four books: one on my night stand, one in the living room and one on my Kindle for travel. Usually a history, a mystery, a biography, a book on leadership and one on current political issues. I also have books I want to read stacked in my den.\n\nMy interests gravitate toward in-depth stories about World War I, World War II and the Civil War, and it should come as no surprise that as a lifelong member of the policing profession I am interested not only in the military but in leadership tactics and strategies.\n\nRight now I have Walter Isaacson’s “The Code Breaker”; Ian Toll’s “Twilight of the Gods: War in the Western Pacific 1944-1945”; “Hitler: Downfall 1939-1945,” the last volume of a biography by Volker Ullrich; Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land”; Erik Larson’s “The Splendid and the Vile”; Michael Connelly’s “The Law of Innocence”; Jon Meacham’s “His Truth Is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope”; Elijah Cummings’s “We’re Better Than This”; Isabel Wilkerson’s “Caste”; and Brené Brown’s “Dare to Lead.” I read everything I can find by and about Winston Churchill, going back to “The Gathering Storm,” published in 1948, the first of his six-volume history of the run-up to World War II. Any book about Churchill will wind up next to my bed.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\n“1939: A People’s History,” by Frederick Taylor. The intimacy of its day-by-day investigation of what led up to World War II gave me an entirely new perspective on how the war came about.\n\nAre there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?\n\n“For Whom the Bell Tolls.” I had never read any Hemingway, and knew very little about the Spanish Civil War. One night, before the PBS series aired, I was watching television and there were Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper in the movie. The next day I was in a bookstore and picked it up. What a complicated man he was. I also recently read John Steinbeck’s short novel “The Moon Is Down,” about the military occupation of Norway in World War II.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
