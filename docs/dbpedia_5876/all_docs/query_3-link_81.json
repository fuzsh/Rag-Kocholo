        "text": "When Worlds Collide: Jonathan Stride, Meet Cab Bolton: Guest Post by Brian Freeman\n\nBRIAN FREEMAN:\n\nWhen Worlds Collide: Jonathan Stride, Meet Cab Bolton\n\nFans of my Florida detective Cab Bolton have been asking for some time when they would meet Cab again in one of my books. So when I wrote those words in my new thriller ALTER EGO – “Jonathan Stride, meet Cab Bolton” – I got a shiver of excitement down my back. Yes, ALTER EGO is not only the tenth novel to feature Duluth police lieutenant Jonathan Stride, it’s also the third novel to feature Cab Bolton.\n\nReaders love the idea of fictional characters crossing over from one world into another. Agatha Christie reported that readers were always urging her to write a book where Hercule Poirot met Jane Marple. I noticed that as soon as Cab made his first appearance, readers at library events and book clubs began asking if Cab and Stride would ever come together.\n\nBut writers don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm that readers have for crossovers. (Christie said Poirot and Marple would have hated each other if they’d met.) Before starting ALTER EGO, I thought long and hard about the creative challenges of two of my series detectives meeting in one book.\n\nThe Series That Almost Wasn’t\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, I wrote five novels featuring Jonathan Stride, starting with my Macavity-winning debut novel IMMORAL and continuing to THE BURYING PLACE, which was a finalist for Best Hardcover Novel in the ITW Thriller Awards. I felt like I’d put Stride through such hell over the course of five books that he needed a vacation.\n\nSo I wrote what I intended to be a stand-alone – one of my most popular books, a novel called THE BONE HOUSE. It was set both in Florida and in the remote Wisconsin region known as Door County. The heroes of the book were a married couple named Mark and Hillary Bradley, but the novel also introduced a supporting character – a quirky Florida detective named Cab Bolton. Cab was six-foot-six, with spiky blond hair and a wealthy Hollywood pedigree thanks to his actress mother. His ironic sense of humor made him a lot of fun to write.\n\nI never intended this book to launch a Cab Bolton series, but I began getting notes from readers almost immediately after THE BONE HOUSE to ask when I’d be doing another Cab novel. And I admit, I liked the idea of writing another story featuring this distinctive hero. It took me a few years, but eventually, I released SEASON OF FEAR, set entirely in Florida, with Cab as the star.\n\nNow I had two series, with Jonathan Stride and Cab Bolton.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Crossovers\n\nFor writers, the advantage of multiple series is that it gives us the opportunity to go in new creative directions. Stride and Cab are so different as heroes that I can tell stories with one that I could never tell with the other. Cab is a more glamorous figure than Stride, and he travels in wealthier circles. His emotional baggage is very different. And he has a much more casual outlook on life than the intense, determined Lieutenant Stride.\n\nCab also gives me the opportunity to explore new settings. Most of my books have been set in the bitter winters of the Midwest, but Cab took me to the heat and storms of central Florida. And giving readers a “you are there” feel in my settings is a vital part of my thrillers.\n\nHowever, the differences between the two series also argue against bringing the two characters together. If they are such different men, living in different worlds, you run the risk of having a crossover feel artificial. So when readers asked me about Stride meeting Cab, I usually responded – probably not. But I also knew that if there was one character who might somehow bring the two series together, it was Stride’s partner, my sexy, snarky Chinese detective, Maggie Bei. Maggie, I said, would get along just fine with Cab.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened.\n\nALTER EGO\n\nThe plot for ALTER EGO actually started in my mind as a novel for Cab. It features a Hollywood actor with a dark side, and given Cab’s Hollywood connections, it seemed like a natural book for him.\n\nBut as I thought about the next steps for Stride, I realized that I could do a lot with the idea of a Hollywood actor playing Stride in the movies (ahem, film agents). I turned this actor into Stride’s “alter ego,” and that’s how the dark plotline began to take shape.\n\nHowever, Cab still lingered in my mind. If there were one book where the two heroes might meet, this was it. And I thought about Maggie acting as a creative bridge to bring Cab into Stride’s world.\n\nSo when a murder investigation takes Maggie to Florida, she finds herself talking to the detective who handled a case with ties to the crime in Duluth – in this case, a tall, glamorous man named Cab Bolton. Soon enough, Maggie and Cab are romantically involved – and they’re heading back to Minnesota for a rendezvous with Stride.\n\nNever Say Never\n\nStride and Cab have met now, and the dynamics of ALTER EGO advance the characters in both series in profound ways. After saying for years that I thought Stride and Cab would never get together, I’m glad they did. Their differences as men are actually what make ALTER EGO work.\n\nOf course, now I have a third series for readers, too: my San Francisco-based series featuring Homicide Inspector Frost Easton that includes THE NIGHT BIRD and THE VOICE INSIDE (with the third book, THE CROOKED STREET, arriving next January). I know the questions I’m going to get.\n\nWill Frost ever meet Stride?\n\nWill Cab ever meet Frost?\n\nOr will the three of them ever find themselves together in one book?\n\nMy first thought is to say – probably not. Then again, I’ve said that before, and look what happened in ALTER EGO. So I’ve learned to never say never.\n\nBrian Freeman released two new thrillers in 2018, THE VOICE INSIDE (featuring Frost Easton) and ALTER EGO (featuring both Jonathan Stride and Cab Bolton). His stand-alone novel SPILLED BLOOD won the award for Best Hardcover Novel in the ITW Thriller Awards.

Natalie and Doug have to face, in no particular order (except that this actually follows the plot of the book)—\n\n• Getting lost\n\n• Dehydration\n\n• Starvation (or at least real bad hunger)\n\n• Injuries suffered after trying to accomplish near impossible physical feats\n\n• An encounter with a survivalist madman\n\nIn addition to offering stunning beauty, peace, quiet, and nature, the wilderness can be a scary place. It’s the setting for a lot of great fiction; Heart of Darkness and Deliverance were just two of the works that influenced me.\n\nAlthough it took only a few months to pen my feverish first draft, Wicked River was actually a story over two decades in the making.\n\nIt began when my husband and I set off on our own backcountry honeymoon in the Adirondacks, only to emerge after one day instead of the intended three weeks.\n\nThe reason we had to leave early is less important than the question that kept nagging at me as my new marriage was built, welded, and soldered.\n\nWhat if we hadn’t turned back when we did?\n\nSomething draws us—human us, personkind—to the wilderness. “I went to the woods to live deliberately,” wrote Thoreau. It’s the perfect set of circumstances in which to celebrate and cultivate a new marriage—an event that deserves thought, reflection, and consideration if ever there was one.\n\nBut there’s a darker level to this as well, and it’s one that may especially resonate with mystery readers. The wilderness, whether we are newly married or not, impresses upon us the essential isolation of the human condition. Nature is bigger than any of us, and in many ways we are at its mercy. The civilized lives we have concocted conceal this fact. Our air is conditioned, made temperate. Food exists in a sealed contraption that preserves it; clean water runs from a spout. Closets offer an array of clothes that provide, depending on what we wish, warmth from the wind or protection from the searing sun. In our daily lives, we can nearly forget that we have the same base needs as any winter-skinny deer.\n\nNature whittles away at us, if it so chooses, until not even a close companion can reach us anymore. Even marriage, an institution that belies our central state of solitude much as the refrigerator masquerades the perishability of our food, can shrivel in the face of the worst that nature doles out.\n\nThat is what Natalie and Doug, the couple in Wicked River, discover. It’s the realization that my husband and I managed to escape by leaving early, but which haunts me to this day.\n\nWould our bond have grown stronger if we’d faced a truly dire situation instead of the hoards of cannibalistic black flies that basically annoyed us out of the woods? Or might we not have lasted; could one of us—or both—have simply perished, unable to do what needed to be done to survive?\n\nNatalie and Doug don’t just survive—they triumph in the woods. As for me, I can only hope that my husband and I would’ve met such challenges then, and would meet them today if necessary. That the cosseted, refrigerated, heated and cooled lives we’ve gotten to live are something to be grateful for, but not all that has allowed us to last.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable question.\n\nAnd not one, thankfully, most of us will ever have to answer.\n\nIn case you go on a camping trip, here are a few tips to keep you from that wicked river:\n\n• Do bring a backup water purification solution, and a backup for the backup—even if you have to leave something less crucial behind to make weight.\n\n• Don’t expect to go from sitting at a desk to walking ten miles. Condition in advance and take time to build up your strength and skills.\n\n• Do feel free to travel at a reasonable pace, even if you’re with companions who move faster. Everybody hikes their own trail and paddles their own river.\n\n• Don’t recriminate in the event of a mishap. Come up with a workaround and enact it.\n\n• Do lay out a plan for your whole trip, and at the same time, do be flexible with the plan as needed.\n\n• Don’t forget to listen to the silence, to look up at the stars. They’ll make up for a whole lot of blisters.\n\nAnd remember to bring a good book.\n\nJenny Milchman is the author of the Mary Higgins Clark award-winning Cover of Snow, plus two other acclaimed novels set in the same fictional Adirondack town.

Have been for years. At least that’s the joke in my family. Because my work as a documentary producer requires a lot of travel, some of it internationally, I’m often leaving home for days or weeks at a time. It’s months before the shows I work on appear on TV and, apparently, I forget to tell family and friends when to watch for them. So, some of my loved ones have taken to openly questioning whether I’m hiding something – like, secretly working for some spy organization as an undercover operative. And though it’s a joke, oddly enough it was almost true.\n\nWhen I was in college I majored in International Studies, a politics degree that focused on world relations. Aside from studying economics, world history, and religion, I took several classes on Intelligence aka spy stuff. I loved the classes and for a nanosecond I considered filling out the 80-page application to join the CIA.\n\nA man from CIA spoke to my class one day on what to expect if we applied (hint: if you want to work in covert operations, don’t tell your interviewer you want to work in covert operations because that will disqualify you). I listened carefully, fantasizing about the romance involved in James Bond -esque adventures. And when he was done, I took the application and left the lecture wondering if I could work as a spy. Maybe not out in the field, Carrie Mathison style, but as a handler back in DC. I walked across the quad thinking about what that life would look like, and it sounded cool - tough and important.\n\nBut then I wondered what it would feel like to hide so much of myself from people I loved. Not just what I did at work, but where I worked, what I knew about the world. I wondered what it would feel like to be facing that kind of stress every day, with danger and bad guys a constant companion. By the time I reached my apartment, I knew being a super-spy wasn’t for me.\n\nInstead I went to work as a journalist and then a television producer.\n\nI suppose it was the road not taken that attracted me to the idea of writing about a pair of accidental spies – a husband and wife team of college professors – caught between an offshoot of Interpol and an international crime ring.\n\nThe wife, Dr. Hollis Larson, is an International Studies professor (see Mom, I’m using my college degree!) and the husband, Dr. Finn Larson, teaches World Literature but also has a PhD in Art History. They’re both smart – the sort of people used to researching their way through a problem – thrown into a world where the danger isn’t theoretical.\n\nWhen I originally began thinking about the series, I knew I wanted each book to be set in a different country, with my characters having to use their knowledge to help them navigate foreign climes and improvising when it fell short. But I planned on them being tourists stumbling across bodies the way I’d written my other mysteries. It was when I changed tactics and had them working as temporary operatives on what was supposed to be a simple mission, that the intrigue became apparent. As Hollis and Finn are drawn into secretive organizations where the line between good guys and bad can seem awfully thin, it made both their reasons for world travel and the threats they faced seem more real, and much more exciting to write (and hopefully to read).\n\nAs I wrote, I felt like I was back in the quad at my university, quietly contemplating work as a spy and a life filled with sinister characters and terrifying possibilities. But instead of tossing my CIA application, but this time I said yes.\n\n***\n\nClare O’Donohue always knew she wanted to be a writer. She wrote her first mystery mini-novel (60 pages) at the age of 15 and in college, worked as a newspaper reporter and writing teacher before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her first job in television, HGTV’s Simply Quilts. Since then, Clare has worked on shows for The History Channel, truTV, Food Network, A&E, Discovery, TLC and others. Her work has taken her all over the United States and abroad where she’s met a diverse spectrum of people from CEOs to prison inmates, Malaysian orphans to famous athletes. Clare published her first novel, The Lovers Knot, in 2008. It opened a world to other authors, readers, bloggers and more.
