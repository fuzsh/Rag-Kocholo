        "text": "by Debbie Burke\n\n@burke_writer\n\nWhew!\n\nI just typed “The End” on the draft of Fruit of the Poisonous Tree, the ninth book in my Tawny Lindholm Thriller series.\n\nBut “The End” doesn’t mean THE END. Far from it.\n\nNow the fun begins.\n\nPrint out the manuscript.\n\nPro Tip: print the hard copy in a different font than the one used onscreen. Errors and typos pop out more visibly.\n\nGrab the red pen and let it bleed all over the pages. Look for inconsistencies, plot holes, chronology problems, dangling subplots, name or description changes (blue eyes to brown, blond hair to auburn), etc.\n\nOops. I changed one character’s name from “Fram” to “Framson” and hit “replace all.” But I forgot to put a space on either side of the name. Therefore, every time the letters “fram” appeared, it was changed to “Framson.” The same petite frame now read The same petite Framson.\n\nOnce you transfer corrections from the hard copy into the digital copy, it’s time to send to beta readers. Their fresh eyes are invaluable because the author is too close to the story and can’t judge it objectively.\n\nHow can you help beta readers help you?\n\nChoose beta readers carefully.\n\nThey don’t necessarily need to be other writers, but they do need to be avid readers. Their function is to assess your book as if they plucked it off the bookstore shelf.\n\nFind people who read in your genre. You probably shouldn’t choose a fan of blood-and-guts action thrillers to beta read a picture book for young readers.\n\nBut don’t eliminate a possible beta simply because they don’t often read your genre. A viewpoint from a different perspective frequently gives additional dimension your story wouldn’t otherwise have.\n\nFind people you can depend on to read in a timely manner. If you have a deadline, let them know it.\n\nFind appropriate experts.\n\nDo your books have legal, medical, law enforcement, professional, technical, and/or historical elements?\n\nAre you writing about a society, nationality, culture, ethnicity, religion, or other group that you’re not familiar with?\n\nIf so, ask for an expert’s help to make your depictions authentic.\n\nExperts are often busy professionals in their field and may not have time to read the entire book. You can send them select passages that you’d like them to review.\n\nFor instance, in Deep Fake Double Down, I wanted short, understandable descriptions about how to create and detect deep fakes, but not too many details to bog the story down. I sent several short excerpts to the expert (say that three times fast). He made suggestions and corrected out-of-date information. The review only took him an hour (including our phone conversation) and my story had accurate details.\n\nAsk specific questions.\n\nDo character actions seem plausible and realistic?\n\nIs the plot interesting? Can you follow it?\n\nDoes the writing flow smoothly?\n\nWere you confused? Please note where.\n\nDid you lose interest in places? Please note where.\n\nAre there dangling threads that need to be wrapped up?\n\nPlease note anything that bothered you.\n\nIf you are concerned about particular issues, let betas know so they’re on the lookout.\n\n5. Series writers need to consider additional factors when asking for feedback from beta readers.\n\nAre your books a series? Or are they serials?\n\nGenerally, a series (Sherlock Holmes, Sue Grafton’s Alphabet Series) features continuing characters in a common location, during a similar time frame, often with consistent themes. Each book stands alone with a self-contained plot arc of beginning, middle, end. A reader does not necessarily have to read the books in order.\n\nPublishDrive.com defines serials as:\n\n“…literary works published in sequential installments rather than as complete, standalone books. A serial is a continuing narrative that must be read in the proper sequence to understand the plot.”\n\nSerial examples are The Hunger Games trilogy, Harry Potter (seven books), and Breaking Bad on TV.\n\nSerials can be:\n\nDuology (2 books)\n\nTrilogy (3)\n\nTetralogy (4)\n\nPentalogy (5)\n\nHexology (6)\n\nHeptology (7)\n\nOctology (8)\n\nEnnealogy (9)\n\nDecology (10)\n\nFor this post, I only talk about series, not serials.\n\nGenerally, readers prefer to read series books in order even though that’s not necessary.\n\nWith each book, series writers need to establish the ongoing characters and their relationships to each other, the world where the story takes place, and the time frame.\n\nMy Tawny Lindholm Thriller series features investigator Tawny Lindholm and attorney Tillman Rosenbaum. All books (except one) take place in Montana. A common theme is justice will be done (although not necessarily in the courtroom!). Each is written as a standalone.\n\nIn the first book, Instrument of the Devil, Tawny is a 50-year-old recent widow who unwittingly becomes entangled in a terrorist plot to destroy the electric grid. Tillman is the attorney who keeps her from going to prison, then hires her to be his investigator.\n\nAlthough their relationship arc changes and evolves through the series, the plot of each book is separate and self-contained.\n\nFor series authors, the balancing act is always how much review is needed to orient new readers vs. too much rehashing from past books that bores ongoing readers.\n\nMy regular betas know the series history. But with each new book, I seek out at least one fresh reader who hasn’t read prior books. For that person, I ask specific questions like:\n\nAre relationships among characters clear and understandable?\n\nCan you follow the plot easily?\n\nWhen events from past books are referred to, can you still follow the current story?\n\nAre past references confusing or unclear?\n\nDo you want more information or clarification?\n\nWhat about spoiler alerts in a series? Over a number of books, continuing characters often undergo changes in marital/relationship status, children, mental or physical abilities, and even death. They can move to a different location. They shift jobs or functions.\n\nThe overall theme may even evolve. One great example is Sue Coletta’s Mayhem series. Hero Shawnee spends several books under attack from serial killer, Mr. Mayhem. Then (spoiler alert) they become unlikely allies as eco-warriors against common enemies that threaten wildlife.\n\nSome spoilers are inevitable. The most obvious is the hero survives the life-or-death catastrophe from the prior book. Otherwise, s/he wouldn’t be around for succeeding stories.\n\nWhere does a series author draw the line about giving away secrets?\n\nIn Fruit of the Poisonous Tree, I wrangled with a difficult spoiler and even asked for advice from TKZ readers.\n\nThe surprise ending from the third book, Eyes in the Sky, comes back to haunt the ongoing characters in the ninth book. I had to weigh whether it was more important to preserve the surprise from Eyes or tell a current story built around that in Fruit. Ultimately, I gave up worrying about revealing it and wrote the new story that demanded to be told.\n\nFruit of the Poisonous Tree is now out to beta readers, and I’m interested in their reactions to this spoiler.\n\n~~~\n\nBeta readers are important friends for writers to have. To thank them, I always acknowledge them in the published book, give them a signed copy, and, if possible, take them out for lunch or dinner, or send them a small gift.\n\nMake your beta reader’s job as easy and painless as possible. The resulting rewards are well worth it!\n\n~~~\n\nTKZers: Have you used beta readers? Any ideas for other questions to ask them?\n\nHave you been a beta reader? Did the author include questions or concerns for you to watch for? Did that help?\n\n~~~\n\nDeep Fake Double Down was chosen as a Top Pick for the Silver Falchion award, sponsored by Killer Nashville, and was the Mystery Finalist for the BookLife Prize.\n\nAvailable at major online booksellers.\n\nVisit debbieburkewriter.com for more information and release dates for Fruit of the Poisonous Tree.\n\nBy Debbie Burke\n\n@burke_writer\n\nToday I’m seeking advice from authors who write series fiction as well as people who enjoy reading series books.\n\nHere’s the situation: I have an idea for the ninth book in the Tawny Lindholm Thriller series, but this new plot would reveal several surprise twists from prior books. These are major league spoilers.\n\nIdeally, readers begin a series with #1 and read the books in order. They watch continuing characters grow and change with each succeeding book.\n\nBut as authors we can’t count on the series being read in order and must keep that in mind as we write.\n\nHere’s some conventional wisdom about series writing:\n\nTreat each book as a standalone.\n\nIf there are references to events that happen in earlier books, skirt around them to avoid giving away surprises.\n\nInclude only enough backstory from earlier books so the reader isn’t confused.\n\nNo spoilers.\n\nSeries contain one unavoidable spoiler: in each book, the lead character grapples with danger that is sure to kill them. But there are more books in the series so the lead must survive. As long as you keep readers up past their bedtime, they don’t mind that spoiler.\n\nWith a series, relationship arcs develop over multiple books.\n\nIn book #1, let’s say two characters dislike each other but must work together to overcome obstacles.\n\nIn book #2, their relationship has changed after being in the trenches together. Changes might be:\n\nThey’re now allies and friends.\n\nOne emerges as the lead while the other becomes the subordinate.\n\nCharacters alternate positions. A secondary character in one book becomes the lead in another.\n\nThey continue to clash with each other in a running conflict.\n\nThey become lovers.\n\nIn book #3, the plot pushes them closer together with more shared adventures and lessons learned. The relationship grows deeper. More variations are possible:\n\nOne is killed off, leading to new problems for the survivor.\n\nThey are no longer personally connected but must still interact (e.g. on the job, as family members, sharing a child, etc.).\n\nOne finds a new interest, which leads to conflict with the other.\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nLike real life, interpersonal relationships in fiction are complicated by death, distance, illness, injury, divorce, children, new romances, blended families, and more.\n\nA while back, I received an email from a someone who had read the first book in my series, Instrument of the Devil. In that story, Tawny Lindholm is the lead character who’s targeted by a terrorist. Soon she’s in insurmountable legal trouble and facing prison. In the last quarter of the book, a brilliant, arrogant attorney named Tillman Rosenbaum shows up to represent her. She desperately needs his help but can’t stand him.\n\nInitially, Tillman was supposed to be a walk-on character, a one-off. However, he was so much fun to write that I couldn’t get rid of him. He demanded the role of male lead and I had no choice but to give it to him.\n\nAt the end of IOTD, Tillman gets Tawny out of legal trouble but she’s broke and desperate. He offers her a job which, despite her dislike for him, she reluctantly accepts.\n\nIn book #2, Stalking Midas, Tawny constantly worries Tillman is going to fire her because the job is over her head. She gradually learns reasons behind her boss’s harsh facade and recognizes why he’s so cynical. Tillman, who doesn’t trust anyone, discovers Tawny can be trusted and she becomes indispensable.\n\nSpoiler alert: by the end, they break their own two cardinal rules:\n\nDon’t dip your pen in the company inkwell.\n\nDon’t sleep with the guy who signs your paycheck.\n\nDespite ups and downs, their relationship grows. Responding to the email from the new reader, I mentioned in passing that their wedding occurs in book #5. The incredulous reader wrote back, “Tawny marries Tillman????”\n\nOops. Let that cat out of the bag. Fortunately, the reader continued with the series.\n\nHere’s my dilemma today: the potential plot for book #9 would require revealing crimes and the killer’s identity from book #3, Eyes in the Sky.\n\nAt this point, I haven’t written one word of #9. The new plot vaguely swirls in my imagination but it’s far from pinned down.\n\nThat’s why I figured now was a good time to ask for help from the intelligent, thoughtful community at TKZ.\n\nIf you write series fiction, have you ever given away spoilers from earlier books?\n\nDo you think that helps or hinders the series?\n\nDid you receive feedback from readers about spilling secrets? What did they think?\n\nDid it affect their reaction to subsequent books in the series?\n\nWere they disappointed?\n\nIf you’re a reader of series fiction, how important is it to you to be surprised?\n\nDo you read series out of order?\n\nDid spoilers from earlier books diminish your reading experience of a new one?\n\nI’m interested in your thoughts, pro and con. Thanks for being my focus group!\n\n~~~\n\nSpoiler alert: the two main characters in the Tawny Lindholm Thriller series survive at the end of each book…so far!\n\nAmazon sales link\n\nBy Sue Coletta\n\nLately, I’ve been consumed with creating a series bible for my Grafton County Series. So, I thought I’d share some tips to help you avoid making the same mistakes. Mistakes like thinking highlighted notes on my Kindle were enough to jog the ol’ memory bank. Mistakes like scribbling notes on scrap paper or a whiteboard. Mistakes like tabbing umpteen pages in the previous paperbacks.\n\nYep. I’ve done all of the above and more. Hence why I’ve had to reread every book in the series. It’s been months since I’ve written in the Grafton County Series. When I set out to plan my WIP, I’d forgotten a lot of details. In my defense, I did write a true crime book, another Mayhem Series thriller, and new true crime proposal in between.\n\nThough it’s fun to spend time with my characters, it’s also a ton of added work, work that could’ve been avoided if I had a series bible in place. Don’t be like me. Even if you’re writing book one, start your series bible now.\n\nFormat\n\nWe first need to decide on a format for our series bible. Some writers use Scrivener. Others prefer Evernote or a Word.doc. The most popular choice is to print the series bible and organize in a three-ring binder. Pick the format that works best for you.\n\nOrganize by Color\n\nChoose one color for each book in the series. Every detail you list in the series bible should correspond to the book’s color.\n\nExample…\n\nBook 1: Blue\n\nBook 2: Red\n\nBook 3: Purple\n\nBook 4: Green\n\nBy color-coding, if you need a detail from the series bible while writing, one glance will tell you when the fact occurred.\n\nDetails to Include\n\nDescription of main characters\n\nDescription of secondary characters\n\nDescription of villains, including monikers (if applicable)\n\nVictims\n\nCharacters’ profession\n\nKillers MO (if applicable)\n\nPets, including deceased pets (if applicable)\n\nTattoos/piercings (if applicable)\n\nScars, emotional and physical\n\nJewelry\n\nMarital status/relationships\n\nImportant dates\n\nFamily ties\n\nThemes\n\nSetting\n\nBackstory\n\nHousing\n\nAccent (if any)\n\nDécor\n\nCherished treasures\n\nTimelines\n\nFuture scene ideas\n\nMost of the above list is self-explanatory, but I do want to point out a few things.\n\nCharacter Description\n\nAn important part of the series bible is character description. Savvy readers will notice if your MC has a small ankle tattoo from her college days in book one, then claims s/he’d never be stupid enough to get one in book five or six.\n\nIn this section be sure to include the basics: hair & eye color, height & weight (approximate, if you’ve never detailed this attribute), style of dress, skin tone/complexion, tattoos & piercings (if applicable), favorite perfume/cologne, injuries and physical scars.\n\nWhen I listed Sage’s injuries/physical scars, I couldn’t believe what I’d done to this poor woman. Here’s a small sample from my story bible.\n\nthick neck scar that tugs at the skin\n\nwhite lines zigzagging across her right forearm\n\nlost unborn child from rape\n\nscar from incised wound on right wrist\n\norbital floor fracture (broken eye socket)\n\nfractured cheekbone\n\nbroken nose\n\nfaint scar from stitches on left wrist\n\nfaint scar from stitches on upper lip\n\nfaint scar from stitches on right cheek\n\nfaint scar from stitches on forehead\n\nAnd that’s only the first two books!\n\nEmotional Turmoil\n\nSince I write psychological thrillers, it’s vitally important for me to track each character’s emotional toll. Past experiences define and shape our characters into the people they are today. An emotional sketch of each character allows us to find triggers and/or weaknesses to exploit in future books. *evil grin*\n\nIncidentally, I do the same for pets. For example, Sage and Niko have two dogs, Colt and Ruger. These dogs have lived through harrowing experiences, and they’ve developed certain habits that stem from those experiences. Animals feel things as deeply as we do. If the pets emerge unscathed, the characterization won’t ring true.\n\nDetails\n\nTiny details matter. For example: When Sage gets nervous, she plays with a Gemini pendant, sliding it back and forth across the necklace. Now, the pendant is turquoise and silver, but for some reason, I wrote “gold” chain in book one. Because this necklace holds sentimental value, Sage would never switch the pendant to a different chain. This minor detail has never been a problem for me. Rarely, if ever, do I mention the color of the chain. Too much description slows the pace.\n\nBut what if I decide to kill her some day? Or fake her death? That necklace could become a key piece of evidence. See what I’m sayin’? Even if we never intend to use the minor detail when we list it, we still should include it in the series bible in case we change our mind.\n\nSmell\n\nThe nose knows! In my Grafton County Series, the medical examiner practically bathes in Aramis cologne. Anyone within fifteen feet knows he’s entered the crime scene before they ever spot him. It’s become a running joke. I could never forget that detail, but I still include it in the series bible under his name just in case.\n\nWhat did slip my mind was Sage’s perfume. This might not sound like a big deal, but for this series, it’s an important detail. During tender moments, Sage’s husband Niko breathes her in. The soft aroma of Shalimar mushrooms across his face, with notes of lemon, iris, jasmine, rose, patchouli, sandalwood, and vanilla. He loves that about her. If I didn’t include this detail in the series bible, future books wouldn’t ring true.\n\nSide tip: If you’re struggling for a scent, ask your husband/wife or significant other. We all have a scent that’s uniquely ours. Maybe they love your shampoo, skin cream, body wash, after-shave, or scented deodorant. Once you find the answer, transfer that scent to your lead or secondary character. Or show your character cooking, baking, or eating. Food is an easy way to include one of the most under-appreciated senses in fiction: smell. If the character is eating, be sure to include taste, too. Bonus!\n\nDécor\n\nDoes your character have a favorite chair? List it in the series bible.\n\nDoes your character hate the hard sofa? Jot down why in the series bible.\n\nDid you focus in on an antique timepiece or cuckoo clock in a past book? Describe it in the series bible.\n\nWhat about a wall safe or gun cabinet? Be sure to include the combination in the series bible.\n\nExample: After a hard day at work, Niko collapses in his Lay-Z-Boy. I’ve never described the recliner in detail. Never had a reason to. Instead, I simply wrote “Lay-Z-Boy” under Niko’s name in the series bible.\n\nHe also has a favorite coffee mug, with #1 Dad inscribed on a gold shield. If Sage poured his coffee into a different mug, fans of the series would wonder where it went.\n\nMinor details can impact series characters in an emotional, conflict-driven way.\n\nWhat if Sage came home to find Niko’s mug shattered on the kitchen floor? Better yet, what if she found it on the bedroom floor? I’ve made it a point to mention this mug in every book. It’s a Grafton County series staple. One glimpse of the shattered mug, and Sage would leap to the conclusion that someone’s been in the house. In reality Colt or Ruger might have knocked it off the counter or bureau. How it wound up on the floor isn’t important (yet). What is important is that I’ve created conflict just by showing the shattered mug.\n\nFuture Scenes\n\nA funny thing happens while creating a story bible. Scene ideas flood the creative mind. While working on my series bible, not only have I finished planning my next Grafton County Series thriller, but I gained at least one new premise for a future book, as well. I even stormed through writing the first few chapters of my WIP. And that may be the best reason of all to create a series bible—to get the creative juices pumping in the right direction.\n\nCan’t think of a plot for your next WIP? Review the story bible. It’s a lot easier than re-reading the entire series. Trust me on that. 🙂\n\nNeed tips for writing a series? Check out the group TKZ post.\n\nDo you use a series bible? If you do, any tips to share? If not, what’s your process to ensure consistency throughout the series?\n\nHis name is Paradox and he poses his victims in RED cocktail dresses, RED roses in place of eyes. He will kill again if his riddles aren’t solved within 24 hours.\n\nCan Niko and Sage stop him before the clock runs out?\n\nLook Inside SCATHED: https://books2read.com/SCATHED\n\nby James Scott Bell\n\n@jamesscottbell\n\nMany pulp writers of old made good bank with a hit series character.\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan.\n\nErle Stanley Gardner gave us Perry Mason.\n\nDashiell Hammett penned the Continental Op.\n\nThe ladies were represented as well. An obvious pen name “Lars Anderson” wrote a series featuring college-educated Ellen Patrick, who fought corruption in 1930s Los Angeles as “the Domino Lady.” The pulp magazine she appeared in was Saucy Romantic Adventures, and wouldn’t you like to have a few original copies of that?\n\nSherlock Holmes is perhaps the most famous example of the hit series character. So popular was Holmes that his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, couldn’t get out from under him. At one point Doyle killed off his detective, but the public demanded he be brought back. His resurrection was by way of the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. When it was first published in The Strand magazine, the circulation of that periodical went up by about thirty thousand.\n\nIn other words, Doyle, though feeling a bit trapped, took that feeling all the way to the bank.\n\nWhat Makes a Great Series Character?\n\nI see five qualities in the best series characters. If you can pack these in from the start, your task is half done. Here they are:\n\nA point of uniqueness, a quirk or style that sets them apart from everybody else\n\nWhat is unique about Sherlock Holmes? He’s moody and excitable. Among the very staid English, that was different.\n\nJack Reacher? Come on. The guy doesn’t own a phone or clothes. He travels around with only a toothbrush. Funny how every place he goes he runs into massive trouble and very bad people.\n\nA skill at which they are really, really good\n\nKatniss Everdeen is killer with the bow and arrow.\n\nHarry Potter is one of the great wizards (though he has a lot to learn).\n\nA bit of the rebel\n\nThe series hero should rub up against authority, even if it’s in a quiet way, like Miss Marple muttering “Oh, dear” at the local constabulary. Hercule Poirot is a needle in the side of Inspector Japp.\n\nA vulnerable spot or character flaw\n\nRobert E. Howard’s Conan the Cimmerian has a vicious temper that sometimes gets the better of him.\n\nSherlock Holmes has a drug habit.\n\nStephanie Plum keeps bouncing between two lovers, who complicate her life.\n\nA likable quality\n\nRaymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe has some of the greatest quips in the history of crime fiction. We like them because Marlowe is also vulnerable—to getting beat up, drugged, or otherwise manhandled by forces larger than himself (like Moose Malloy).\n\nWit is one of the great likability factors.\n\nAnother is caring for others besides oneself. Stephanie Plum has a crazy family to care for, not to mention her sometime partner Lula.\n\nWill the Character Grow?\n\nOne decision you should make early on is how much character growth there will be. While you’ll hear a lot about the necessity for character arcs, they aren’t always necessary.\n\nFor example, Jack Reacher doesn’t change. I once heard Lee Child talking about this on a panel, and he said, “Arcs? We don’t need no stinkin’ arcs.”\n\nAhem.\n\nMichael Connelly, on the other hand, has brought tremendous change to his series character, Harry Bosch. He decided, too, that he would age Bosch right along with the books, a decision he has come to ruefully regret. Bosch is getting up there!\n\nAt the very least, your character ought to grow stronger with each adventure. Why? Because without that there is no tension or conflict in the story. Each new tale must challenge the character in some way that threatens him with death (physical, professional, or psychological).\n\nTest Marketing\n\nSelf-publishing today provides the writer with a way to “test drive” a potential series character. You can do that in a number of ways.\n\nYou can write a story and send it to several beta readers. These are people you know and trust to give you honest feedback.\n\nYou can publish in a free venue, like Wattpad, and collect the feedback that way.\n\nThere’s always the option of going to Kindle Direct Publishing, and using Kindle Select exclusivity so you can promote the story for free. Promote the heck out of it. Read the reviews.\n\nThe pulp writers of old weren’t shy about testing a character and then moving on if that character didn’t create enough buzz. Their big problem was the lag time between sending in a story and waiting months for it to appear.\n\nToday, you don’t have to wait.\n\nWho are some of your favorite series characters? What do you think is the key to their popularity?\n\nby James Scott Bell\n\n@jamesscottbell\n\nI’m happy to announce the release of my new Mike Romeo thriller, Romeo’s Hammer. It begins on a posh beach at Malibu, and ends just up the coast at Paradise Cove. In between a lot of stuff happens. (This is called a plot summary).\n\nToday, I thought I’d say a little bit about how I came up with Romeo as my series hero.\n\nI’d long wanted to write about a lone-wolf, hard-boiled seeker of justice. I’ve always loved this famous Raymond Chandler quote about the classic PI:\n\nDown these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor—by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world.\n\nHe will take no man’s money dishonestly and no man’s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him.\n\nThe story is this man’s adventure in search of a hidden truth, and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure. If there were enough like him, the world would be a very safe place to live in, without becoming too dull to be worth living in.\n\nBut I did not want to do another PI character. I love ’em, but we have enough of them. So I conceived a backstory that would cause a man to be on the run and off the grid. With a changed name. And who spent a number of years as a cage fighter.\n\nWhat else could I add to make him more interesting for me? I decided to include my love of philosophy. I was nearly a philosophy major in college. But freshman year I was in a big philosophy class, with the smaller classroom discussions taught by a TA. This guy wore sandals and smoked Camels (you could smoke in the classrooms back then). He would take out a fresh cig as he spoke, hold it between two fingers, then strike a match, all while talking. He’d get a faraway look in his eyes as he went off on a metaphysical tangent. We students would watch the match burn down, waiting until it hit his fingers, which it inevitably did, and he’d shake the match vigorously to put it out—still talking! He’d drop the dead match on the floor and begin the process all over again. It always took him 2 – 4 matches to light up.\n\nAnd I thought, if that’s what I might become as a philosophy major, maybe I ought to try something else.\n\nBut I digress. I’ve always loved philosophy and theology and thinking about deep things, especially in times of crisis. Give me Epictetus when things aren’t going my way, or Pascal when reflecting on ultimate truth. I wanted my series hero to be like that. So I made him a genius, a kid who was accepted to Yale at age fourteen. But then bad things happened … and we begin with Mike Romeo in Romeo’s Rules, in the present, with a tattoo on his forearm: Vincit Omnia Veritas. Truth Conquers All Things.\n\nPlus, he likes flowers.\n\nMost of all, though, he has that code Chandler wrote about. And at some point it struck me that I had a model for him in the back of my mind all along.\n\nI was a mere pup when the TV series Have Gun, Will Travel was popular. But the character, Paladin (played by Richard Boone) was cool. (A paladin was a knight known for heroic deeds and the code of chivalry).\n\nPaladin lived in the luxurious Carleton Hotel in San Francisco. There he ate the finest foods, sipped the finest brandy, and escorted the finest women to the opera. He could speak on virtually any subject.\n\nBut he was also a gun for hire. He’d go out on jobs, donning his all-black duds and six guns. His holster had a chess knight on it. Ditto his card.\n\nThe great thing about this western, unlike, say, Gunsmoke, was that Paladin very rarely shot anyone! Instead, he used his wits to outfox bad guys, or get good guys to do the right thing.\n\nMost of all he lived by his code. One part of that code, which Mike Romeo shares, is that if someone is being bullied, justice demands the paladin step in and stop it. Here’s a clip from an episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. Paladin has just arrived in a town to meet his employer for the first time.\n\nThat’s Paladin. And that’s the sort of hero I had in mind when I conceived Mike Romeo.\n\nWhich makes writing the series fun for me. Maybe that’s the biggest key of all. You can put your hero through all sorts of tests. You can have him suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But if he’s not someone you’d like to hang out with, the series can turn into a slog.\n\nFortunately, Mike Romeo is bringing me joy.\n\nThe Romeo’s Hammer is available here:\n\nAMAZON\n\nAMAZON INTERNATIONAL STORES\n\nSo….let’s talk series characters. Do you have one? How did you come up with him or her?\n\nOR\n\nWho is your favorite series hero, and why?\n\nby James Scott Bell\n\n@jamesscottbell\n\nA post and an announcement today. First the post.\n\nA few years ago I was at the Men of Mystery conference in SoCal, a one-day gathering of mystery writers and readers. The keynoter was Michael Connelly, and something he said hit home.\n\nHe was talking about advice he got early on from Joseph Wambaugh. Wambaugh, the L.A. cop turned bestselling author, told Connelly that the really interesting thing is not how the cop works on the case; it’s how the case works on the cop.\n\nConnelly took that to heart as he began his Harry Bosch series, and the development of Bosch over the last nearly quarter century is nothing short of astonishing. We are seeing, right before our eyes, the production of greatest detective series ever written. I love me some Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. William Goldman once opined in the New York Times that the books by Ross Macdonald were “the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American.”\n\nBut in my view Michael Connelly has taken over that distinction.\n\nFirst off, his plots are always gripping. The complex mysteries come together slowly, piece by piece, as Harry does his detective work. The procedural aspects are highly detailed yet never dull.\n\nBut it’s how the cases work on Harry that takes us deeper. In each book there is something that gets to Harry Bosch and grips his soul. For example, in Lost Light, Harry (retired and working privately) sets out to solve a cold case he worked years earlier. He recalls the position of the victim’s body:\n\nBut it was her hands that I would remember the most. Somehow when her lifeless body was dropped to the tile, her hands fell together. Off to the left side of her body, they were directed upward from her head, as if she were reaching out to someone, almost beseechingly, begging for something. They look like hands from a Renaissance painting, like the hands of the damned reaching heavenward for forgiveness. In my life I have worked almost a thousand homicides and no positioning of a fallen body ever gave me such pause.\n\nPerhaps I saw too much in the vagaries of how she had fallen. But every case is a battle in a war that never ends. Believe me, you need something to carry with you every time you go into the fight. Something to hold on to, an edge that drives you or pulls you. And it was her hands that did it for me. I could not forget her hands. I believe they were reaching to me. I still do.\n\nSo the lesson for today is this: Don’t make your novel just about how a lead character works on the plot, but how the plot works on the lead character. For where does originality come from? Not just in the twists and turns of plot. It also comes from the twists and turns inside a human being navigating a life-and-death struggle.\n\nIf you want to see how a master does it, I commend to you the novels of Michael Connelly.\n\nAnd now my announcement. I have just released my second Mike Romeo thriller, Romeo’s Way. It begins this way:\n\nIT WAS THE first Tuesday in March, the sun taking its sweet time fighting off the cloud cover and recent rains, when I saw the kid who wanted to die.\n\nIt can be ordered here:\n\nAMAZON\n\nKOBO\n\nNOOK.\n\nIt’s also available in a PRINT VERSION.\n\nTo sum up: There are popular series where the character stays basically the same. Some of these are highly entertaining. I enjoy reading them. But when they’re done, I pretty much forget them.\n\nHarry Bosch is unforgettable.\n\nThat’s a high bar indeed. But as Brother Brooks put it recently, “The higher the bar, the sweeter the leap.”\n\nSo what about you? For those of you who are working on a series, do you give equal thought to the inner journey as well as the outer plot line?"
