        "text": "$20\n\nJoseph Wambaugh is back! The first master of the LAPD crime novel, Wambaugh has clearly inspired scores of young great crime fiction writers, such as Michael Connelly and others. His early works, \"The New Centurions\" and \"The Onion Field\" were groundbreaking in their gritty portrayal of race, politics and dramaâ€”within the LAPD, and on the streets of LA itself. HIs new book, \"Hollywood Station,\" is Wambaugh's first in ten years, and he comes back to the LAPD. His new book shows the stark contrast between the LAPD and the streets of LA since the days of \"The Onion Field\" and \"The New Centurions,\" and Los Angeles seems almost surrealistically menacing. James Ellory, author of great crime novels such as \"The Black Dahlia\" and \"L.A. Confidential,\" writes great noir stories that feature LA cops at their best, and at their most corrupt.\n\nOfficial Website: http://writersblocpresents.com/events/events.htm"
