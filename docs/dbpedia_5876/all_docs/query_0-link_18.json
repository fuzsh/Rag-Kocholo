        "text": "Michael Connelly won the Edgar Award, Best First Novel, for THE BLACK ECHO, number one in the Hieronymous Bosch series, plus the Anthony Award, Best Novel of 1998, for BLOOD WORK, a Terry Caleb mystery. Michael is also the winner of the Macavity, the Nero, the Maltese Falcon in Japan, the .38 Caliber in France, and the Grand Prix, also in France. I wanted to interview him not only because he is a big award winner but because he is the quintessential mystery writer. His work sells extremely well and hes known, not only in Europe and Japan, but also the Netherlands and Korea. In no time, his books are scooped up and optioned by a powerful star or studio in Hollywood. Even Clint Eastwood had to get in on it and presently has the rights to BLOOD WORK.\n\nMichaels glory is hard-earned. He has a background in journalism and worked the crime beat in Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, covering everything from cocaine wars to airline crashes. Michael landed a position as crime reporter for the Los Angeles Times and hes been in the city of lost angels ever since.\n\nFor those of you who are book collectors or just diehard Michael Connelly fans, B.E. Trice Publishing is now offering a limited edition of Michaels next book, A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT, which will be available in late November. You can also purchase a deluxe edition that is leather bound.\n\nWhatever you do, dont miss Michaels television series, LEVEL 9, an exciting new show about a unique task force that fights cyber crime, which premiered on UPN Friday, October 27 at 9:00PM/8PM Central. The producers and writers of LEVEL 9, Michael is both, have a concept for this series that is not only reality-based but also a vision of the future. A mix of FBI, Secret Service and computer hacker personalities versus never-seen-before techno-villains makes for unending digital possibilities.\n\nInterviewing Michael was a real pleasure and Id like to do it again because I have so many more questions."
