        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nJust a handful of tickets remain for the upcoming conversation between crime novelist Michael Connelly and his collaborator Rick Jackson at Danville’s Village Theatre this spring.\n\nConnelly’s prolific career as a writer of detective and crime fiction kicked off with his first novel “The Black Echo” in 1992, following more than a decade as a crime reporter, introducing himself to the world of fiction and several of his recurring characters to readers. He retired from journalism in 1995, and has been a full-time novelist ever since\n\nSince then, several of Connelly’s works have been showcased in film and television, including the 2002 film adaptation of “Blood Work” starring Clint Eastwood and the 2014 Amazon Prime series “Bosch,” one of many projects in which Connelly has served as a producer.\n\nMost recently, Connelly’s work was adapted into the 2022 Netflix series “The Lincoln Lawyer,” which was also adapted for a film starring Matthew McConaughey in 2011. His latest novel “The Waiting” – the 39th book of his career – is set to be released this November.\n\nJackson, a former detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, has been a longtime collaborator of Connelly’s and an inspiration for his work – as well as being fictionalized as one of Connelly’s numerous recurring characters starting with the 2005 novel “The Closers.”\n\nAttendees at Connelly and Jackson’s upcoming appearance in Danville are set to receive free copies of either the 2023 novel “Resurrection Walk” or the 2022 novel “Desert Star” – the two latest novels by Connelly – with a book signing following the discussion that evening.\n\nTickets for the event – a benefit for the Eugene O’Neill Foundation – have been selling rapidly, with just 21 seats remaining for the event as of Monday afternoon."
