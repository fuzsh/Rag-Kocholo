        "text": "If Matthew McConaughey reflects on his remarkable mid-life return to fame and glory – the so-called “McConaissance” – he should thank the author Michael Connelly along with his agent, deity and bongo drums vendor. It was Connelly who created the character of the so-called “Lincoln lawyer” Mickey Haller in his eponymous 2005 novel, a Los Angeles defence attorney who acquired his nickname after his propensity to conduct his legal business from the back seat of a chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car.\n\nMcConaughey assumed the role in Brad Furman’s 2011 film, and it revitalised his career. After years of being lost to mediocre rom-coms, McConaughey was charismatic and dynamic as a man whose wheeler-dealing never obscured either his street smarts or his moral calling.\n\nNow, Haller has returned in a new Netflix series, co-created by David E Kelley (Anatomy of a Scandal) and The Good Wife’s Ted Humphrey and adapted from Connelly’s second Haller novel, The Brass Verdict. The Mexican-American actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo assumes the lead role from McConaughey, and it co-stars Neve Campbell and Becki Newton as Haller’s ex-wives and legal sparring partners. Pacy, witty and gripping, it’s both another of Kelley’s many successful legal-themed dramas (which include The Practice, Boston Legal and Goliath) and a fitting continuation of the Haller saga, which should both satisfy the character’s die-hard fans and thrill neophyte viewers. It's currently in Netflix UK's top 10.\n\nIts creator, meanwhile, is one of the bestselling crime and thriller novelists alive today, having published 37 books in 30 years and sold an estimated 80 million. The new Lincoln Lawyer series will no doubt shift millions more. And when I speak to the gravel-voiced and impeccably courteous 65-year-old Connelly over Zoom from his Los Angeles home, as he wolfs down the remainder of his breakfast, he professes himself pleased with both the McConaughey and Garcia-Rulfo iterations of the character, even if the latter is more authentic casting, given Haller’s Mexican-American origins in the books. Although Connelly has no formal say over casting, his opinions, especially when it comes to the leads, are keenly sought by producers and directors.\n\n“I saw the film Tropic Thunder, in which McConaughey plays a sleazy agent, and I whispered to my wife ‘He’d be a good Mickey Haller’. You can see him grinding, and thinking two or three moves ahead. And LA’s such a hotchpotch that it didn’t seem unusual to have a lawyer with a Texas drawl. But when Netflix came on board with the new series, they said from the start ‘We only want to look at Mexican-American actors for Haller, are you OK with that?’ And I said ‘Of course I’m OK with that!”\n\nThe show’s origins have been, like so many things in Hollywood, both protracted and nearly wiped out entirely by the pandemic. As Connelly says, “When the first book came out 15 years ago, David Kelley contacted me and said that he wanted to turn it into a TV show. Unfortunately his call came a week after Lakeshore Entertainment’s, the company who eventually made it into a movie. Even back then, I knew who Kelley was, and I thought ‘too bad’. But then the movie was made, and I was very happy with it.”\n\nIn an extremely savvy move, Connelly paid $3 million in 2011 to buy back the rights to the Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch characters, believing – correctly – that they deserved a greater lease of life. As his entertainment attorney Diane Golden took Publisher’s Weekly in 2021, “I can’t tell you how unusual that is. In Hollywood, everyone’s looking for someone else to write a check. Michael bet on himself, and it paid off.” As the writer says today, “After I bought back the rights, my agent got a call from Kelley’s business partner, and we agreed a deal, 15 years after he first approached me. We were going to make it for CBS, and David wrote a script, and then the Friday before we were due to shoot, the whole thing was cancelled, citing Covid.”\n\nIt seemed like terminal bad luck, as it was for so many shows left in Covid-induced limbo, but thankfully Netflix stepped in. Their generous budget and offer of creative freedom took the show in a very different direction to what Connelly, Kelley and Humphrey had been anticipating.\n\n“Going from a network show to a Netflix show was a big change. But my response was ‘Yay’, because Netflix are in the business of expanding things, not tearing things down to satisfy advertisers. For CBS, we were expecting to make 22 episodes, with every episode a case-of-the-week storyline. It would have lost a lot of the reality of the books – and I’ve always prided myself on writing an honest and accurate look at how the legal system works, or doesn’t work. So going with Netflix gave us the opportunity to return to that reality, and I really embraced that. It was a little bit of a tortuous path, but ultimately very worth it. I’m very happy with what we got.”\n\nConnelly has limitless praise for the “mad genius” Kelley and Humphrey, himself a former lawyer, but confesses that he has had less happy experiences with adaptations in the past. “The gamble that you take when you go into Hollywood with your stories is that you engage with people who think that they know how to do it, or even how to do it better. They don’t have a lot of loyalty to the books, and you can work with people who think they’re better. Sometimes they can; usually they can’t.”\n\nHowever, Kelley and Humphrey involved him heavily in the writers’ room, which he enjoyed being a part of. “There was no sense of them saying ‘Run along and be a good little novelist, we’ll handle it from here’. They wanted to involve me, saying ‘you created these characters, you know them better than anybody – plus we think that you probably know some people who inspired these stories’. So they amassed a solid writing team that included lawyers-turned-writers, and it worked out great.”\n\nThe central character of Haller is a difficult one for any actor or screenwriter to nail dramatically. On the one hand, he’s a colourful figure with a rackety romantic past (although he is shown to have a good relationship with both of his lawyer ex-wives, who are portrayed as independent figures with agency of their own) and a painkiller addiction. And yet, as he says in the first episode, “When I am right, there is no better criminal defence attorney in Los Angeles.”\n\nConnelly’s major inspiration for Haller is surprising but makes sense in context. “Some people may think I have no right to say this, but I always looked at Mickey Haller as an extension of Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird. Atticus has to make the decision to do the right thing, knowing that it will cost him and the people around him who love him. That’s a heroic decision, and that is what I wanted to have happen with Mickey Haller, in both the books and the show. Ultimately, Mickey has to make a very difficult decision to do the right thing, knowing it will cost him dearly too, and that’s inspirational to me.”\n\nConnelly has also been closely involved with the Amazon series Bosch, based on his series of novels about Haller’s half-brother, the LA detective Harry Bosch. When asked what he sees as the similarities and differences between his two characters, Connelly replies: “It’s easy for a cop like Bosch to be moral, but it’s harder for a defence attorney like Mickey, because doing ‘the right thing’ might not be the best thing for his client, or for him. When it comes to the shows, we’ve got Bosch as the embodiment of the system – he carries a gun, he carries authority – but Mickey’s an underdog.”\n\nConnelly himself grew up in Philadelphia and did not visit Los Angeles until he was 30. His first job there was as a crime reporter on the Los Angeles Times, where he worked for five years until he published his debut novel, The Black Echo, in 1992, which introduced the Harry Bosch character. It was an immediate success. He described a life far from the luxury that he enjoys today to Publisher’s Weekly last year: “When you don’t have a lot of money and live in L.A., chances are you live near a freeway. I played jazz to obliterate the noise, then moved into the closet because there were no windows in there.”\n\nToday, Bosch is perhaps his most enduring creation, both in his standalone books and when paired with the character of the female LAPD detective Renée Ballard, as he is in Connelly’s most recent novel The Dark Hours. The fourth instalment in the Ballard and Bosch series, it focuses on an unsolved New Year’s Eve murder, and has allowed Connelly once again to pay homage to the real-life detective Mitzi Roberts, who is a long-standing friend of his and who has been invaluable for his understanding of what it is like to be a woman in the LAPD. As he has said, “She’s given me gold. Women in her situation have to constantly prove themselves when men don’t, and I want to get that right in my books.”\n\nThe author today cites his major literary influences as Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald and Joseph Wambaugh. (“All three of them Southern California, LA writers.”) Chandler is perhaps his greatest hero, and the Lincoln Lawyer series threw up an amusing piece of serendipity. “We have a cameo by Elliott Gould in the fifth episode as Mickey’s mentor David ‘Legal’ Siegel, and I discovered Chandler through the Robert Altman adaptation of The Long Goodbye, which stars Gould as Philip Marlowe. It was a very cool day to be on the set when Elliott came in to be a mentor to the character I created, because it mirrored the way Chandler, and Marlowe, mentored me as a writer.”\n\nDespite his enormous success, Connelly is still riddled with the doubts and uncertainties that every novelist faces, no matter how acclaimed they are. Adaptation does not help with this. “When I have to return to my books for their television versions – in some cases, written over 25 years ago – you get into this difficult position of seeing things you could have done better and the mistakes you’ve made. But there’s always a point at the beginning of a project when I say ‘Look, I used to be a reporter, and I’ve been judged by book critics for 30 years. I can handle anything you want to say. If something doesn’t work in a book that needs to be fixed for a TV series, we can handle it’.”\n\nHe still looks back on his career with a mixture of pride and surprise. “There was no email or internet when I started out, and I’m still thrilled to have a life writing. When you start out, you just want to get published. I was asking whether I could make enough money not to have to work as a newspaper reporter for two or three years. The idea of being able to do this as a career, and that I would have the kind of life and success that I have now, is marvellous – and it’s what I’m proudest of. I never thought that I’d be in this kind of situation.”\n\nHe is a prolific writer, and told Publisher’s Weekly last year that “Ideas come to me in dreams and wake me up. Sometimes, I’ll get up in the middle of the night and write them down. I always have a laptop next to my bed…it helps that I don’t need a lot of sleep.” He is relentlessly hard-working, gathering everyone from retired private detectives to serving police officers as researchers, and ensures that all of his novels have the authentic tang of verisimilitude to them; you can practically smell the sweat, blood and day-old aftershave that emanate from his characters.\n\nYet Connelly shows no signs of slowing down. He still wonders if there’s one more iconic new creation, another Mickey Haller or Harry Bosch, left in him. “I’ve relied too much on series books. I wish that I’d written more standalone books or invented new characters. I hope that I still have time to do that, but you fall in love with your characters, and you have so much more to say about them. So do you go off and do something new, or do you stick with your characters? It’s always a dilemma. And now that I’m closer to the end of my writing days than the beginning, I keep wondering ‘Can I come up with one more character?’”\n\nIf he does, he’s intrigued by their having a scientific background. “A long time ago – 20 years ago – I wrote about a book about a scientist called Chasing the Dime, and that’s my only standalone novel. But I love the idea of scientists, and their logic, and taking them out of the lab and solving something in their lives. I have people like that in my family, so it’s something that I’m tempted to go back into, and find something new.”\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer is streaming on Netflix now; The Dark Hours is out now in paperback"
