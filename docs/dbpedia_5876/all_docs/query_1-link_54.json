        "text": "Call for Papers The Captivating Criminality Network is delighted to announce its sixth conference, which will be held in Italy. Building upon and developing ideas and themes from the previous five successful conferences, Metamorphoses of Crime: Facts and Fictions will examine the ways in which Crime Fiction as a genre incorporates elements of real-life cases and, in turn, influences society by conveying thought-provoking ideas of deviance, criminal activity, investigation and punishment. Since its inception, the genre has drawn inspiration from sensational crime reports. In early nineteenth-century Britain, for example, Newgate novels largely drew on the biographies of famous bandits, while penny dreadfuls popularized the exploits of criminals and detectives to appeal the taste for horror and transgression of their target audience. In similar ways, notorious cases widely reported in the mid-Victorian press, such as the Road Murder (1860) or the Madeleine Smith trial (1857), exerted a significant influence on the imagination of mid-to late-Victorian novelists, including early practitioners of the sensation genre who laid the premises for the creation of detective fiction. In other cases, criminal actions were triggered by literary texts or turned into appealing fictions by journalists. Suffice it to consider the sensation created by Jack the Ripper's murders in late-Victorian Britain or the twentieth-century recent cases of murders committed by imitators of criminals and serial killers featured in novels like A ClockWork Orange (1962), The Collector (1963), Rage (1977), and American Psycho (1991). In more recent times, the interaction between reality and other media (TV series, films, computer games, websites, chats, etc.) has raised the question of how crime continues to glamorize perturbing, blood-chilling stories of law-breaking and law-enforcement. In addition to exploring these complex relations between facts and fictions, the conference will focus on the metamorphoses of crime across media, as well as cultural and critical boundaries. Speakers are invited to explore the crossing of forms and themes, and to ascertain the extent to which canonized definitions suit the extreme volatility of a genre that challenges categorization. From an ideological viewpoint, moreover, crime fiction has proved to be highly metamorphic, as it has been variously used to challenge, reinforce or simply interrogate ideas of 'law and order'. The enduring appeal of the genre is also due to its openness to historical and cultural movements-such as feminism, gender studies, queer politics, postmodernism-as well as to concepts drawn from specific fields of knowledge, such as sociology and psychology. Similarly relevant to the 'metamorphoses of crime' are cultural exchanges among remote areas of the world, which add new perspectives to the genre's representation of customs and ethnical issues. Scholars, practitioners and fans of crime writing are invited to participate in this conference that will address these key elements of crime fiction and real crime, from the early modern to the present day. Topics may include, but are not restricted to: • True Crime, Fictional Crime\n\nWelcome to the second issue of \"The Australian Journal of Crime Fiction\": a project designed to deliver exciting and innovative scholarship on crime fiction in Australia and around the world. As Alistair Rolls and Marguerite Johnson note, within this issue: “Crime Fiction is now a more than respectable area of scholarly endeavour” (2015). This journal highlights the diversity of these scholarly endeavours. We begin with the work of Carolyn Beasley, Craig McIntosh and Jason Bainbridge: '\"Social consequences be damned, it was money for jam\": The Kennett Era, Shane Maloney and the Writer as Vernacular Theorist'. This work highlights Victorian politics in the 1990s and how this political environment provided a platform for crime fiction writer Shane Maloney. Focusing on the last two volumes of the Murray Whelan series, \"Something Fishy\" (2002) and \"Sucked In\" (2007) the paper identifies the ways in which Maloney engages with both the main tenets of Premier Jeff Kennett’s leadership style and the effects of Kennett’s political and social policies on the wider community. By placing Maloney’s work in the broader contexts of Australian crime fiction, the literature of protest and the politics of the Kennett era, this research suggests such works are as capable of critical reflection and insight as more traditional, or culturally legitimate, forms of theorising through the location of vernacular theory in these texts. Ideas of a killer’s code are taken up by Jason Bainbridge with his article: 'Seduction of the Serial Killer: Representing Justice with Lecter, \"Dexter\" and the \"Death Note\"’. Exploring ideas that circulate around the serial killer and how, since Jack the Ripper, the “serial killer has been the monster at the heart of modernity, [a monster that] society has sought to control and understand,” Bainbridge goes on to explore the evolution of this type of murderer and how the serial killer has become increasingly represented as sympathetic, almost seductive. This is demonstrated through an analysis of the serial killer in popular culture, killers almost as well known as Jack the Ripper, such as \"Hannibal\" (2001), \"Dexter\" (2006-2013) and the central figure in Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata’s 2003 manga \"Death Note\". The central theme is an argument that the serial killer maintains a position emblematic of the contradictions in modernity and speaks to ongoing tensions between law and justice. Our third article: ‘Getting under the Skin to Read the Signs: The Call of Classical Myths and Mysteries in Leigh Redhead’s \"Peepshow\"’, comes from Alistair Rolls and Marguerite Johnson. Rolls and Johnson contribute to the debate on the origins of modern crime fiction through an outline of the interconnection of ancient myth and the contemporary crime story. This is achieved through a clever case study of Leigh Redhead’s \"Peepshow\" (2004) that posits Redhead as “at all times a consummate, and self-conscious, performer of Crime Fiction.” In keeping with the genre of gritty, detective novels, \"Peepshow\" is a “realistic, colloquial read, complete with lots of sleaze, sex, drugs and thugs.” Yet, as this article demonstrates, the work offers a series of classical references and allusions, some overt and clearly intentional, others potentially more a product of the reader’s imagination or the author’s unconscious. In this way this article asks questions as diverse as: Why crime fiction?; and What’s on the page for the Classically-educated reader? Phryne Fisher and other Fantasies: The Female Detective in History In addition, this issue of \"The Australian Journal of Crime Fiction\", presents two papers, which resulted from the inaugural Historical Novel Society Australasia conference held this year in Sydney. Supported by Swinburne University, this conference saw a panel of academics (Wendy J. Dunn, Kelly Gardiner, Rachel Franks, Rachel Le Rossignol and Diane Murray) discuss the honorable Miss Phryne Fisher and the female detective in history. During a lively panel discussion, expertly chaired by Diane Murray, Rachel Le Rossignol established that the female detective in history was well and truly rooted in reality whilst Rachel Franks and Kelly Gardiner offered a first taste of papers now published in this journal. Rachel Franks’ paper, co-written with Toni Johnson-Woods, entitled: ‘Phryne Fisher: Feminism and Modernism in Historical Crime Fiction’, sets out the history of the unforgettable and delightful Miss Fisher, from the time this liberated, sensual, slender, stunningly dressed woman – red woollen coat with an astrakhan collar, Russian leather boots and gloves – first stepped into Kerry Greenwood’s imagination, becoming a vivid construction of the written word in twenty novels, to her later rebirth in the media of television. Franks and Johnson-Woods reveal Miss Fisher as \"quintessentially Australian\". Perhaps this is not surprising when you consider that Miss Fisher birthed into her author’s mind on a Melbourne tram. Kelly Gardiner sets out another type of overview – how Greenwood’s construction of Miss Fisher can be identified as fulfilling one of the vital archetypes in crime and mystery writing: ‘The Female Gentleman’. ‘The Female Gentleman’ breaks through the glass ceiling of a male-dominated world, with Gardiner proving: “that female sleuths could be rational and effective – and equal in intellect to their male counterparts. Her most adventurous, effective, ironic, and impeccably dressed descendant is, of course, Phryne Fisher. She smokes, drives, enchants, rescues damsels in distress (and herself), follows her own code of honour, and banters with artists as well as sportsmen and police officers”. The Honourable Miss Fisher is an unforgettable, indomitable character, loved by readers since 1989. As these two essays demonstrate, she also a subject we can learn much from through academic study. In Conversation The articles outlined above are supplemented by several interviews. Angela Savage talks to Nick Temelkovski about the themes and research in her novel \"The Dying Beach\". Carolyn Beasley interviews the increasingly popular Lenny Bartulin. And Amanda Frost catches up with David Whish Wilson, writer of the Frank Swann series and Elizabeth Heiter creator of the Profiler series, featuring protagonist Evelyn Baine. So – via a significant politician, serial killers, strippers, a dashingly dressed Lady Detective/Female Gentleman and several popular crime fiction writers – this issue of \"The Australian Journal of Crime Fiction\" demonstrates the diversity of scholarship in this continually expanding, and always fascinating, field of fiction. Rachel Franks and Wendy J. Dunn\n\nAs Andrew Pepper has observed, crime fiction is one of the most significant popular means of exploring the contradictions that emerge from the modern, capitalist nation state. Pepper argues that traditional crime fiction is a genre which developed as a result of the fact that the State assumed control of the justice system. The genre produces, however, \"a contradictory account of the state, as both necessary for the creation and maintenance of collective life and central to the reproduction of entrenched socioeconomic equalities\" (2). Pepper draws on traditional crime fiction, centred, as he puts it, on \"a figure appointed by the state or an auxiliary\" (1), in other words, a detective. Such fiction is largely concerned with the detection and bringing to justice of aberrant, criminal individuals, with the State (and/or its auxiliaries) acting as the guarantor of that justice, albeit in often contradictory and flawed ways. When it comes to fictions of organized crime, however, a different paradigm and a different framing of the relationship between crime and the State emerges. Charles Tilly argues that the form of the nation state itself, specifically the monopoly on violence and its war-making tendency, is rooted in a kind of \"protec-tion racket\" where the state \"creates a threat and charges for its reduction\" (171). He goes on to explore how producing and controlling violence \"favoured monopoly\" (175)-to this we might add the protection and control of trade and the protection of rents. The idea of the nation state, not as the guarantor of justice, but as a structure larger than any single individual, which extorts, coerces and charges rents-a structure that replicates many features of organized crime groups-explains the central focus of this collection: the responsibility or otherwise of the State for organized crime and the ways in which cultural representations engage with this unpalatable reality. The articles in this collection analyse a range of fictional and semi-fictional cultural forms-novels, TV series, films, and popular music-which deal with organized crime, widely understood. All are concerned, in one way or another, with untangling the complex interconnection between criminal organisations and the State. While often posited as aberrations external to the State, a major theme of the articles is that these organisations often work in concert with it. In fact, in many of the settings explored here, the State itself appears as a criminal actor. The contradiction, or dilemma, lies in the fact that even in this constellation of entanglement or collusion, the State remains the only entity with the potential to control organized crime."
