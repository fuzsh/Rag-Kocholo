        "text": "From my list on killers.\n\nBy Rod Sadler Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe one thing you’ll find in common about the books I recommend and the books I write is the attention to detail. As a retired police officer, I know that it was often the smallest of details that helped solve a crime. In my books, you’ll find an inordinate amount of information that was never known to the public, and I think that’s what truly holds a reader’s interest. Killing Women is the true story of serial killer Don Miller, and you’ll be abhorred at what he did to his victims. Are you ready for his release in 2031?\n\nRod's book list on killers\n\nWhy did Rod love this book?\n\nAs a high school senior planning a career in law enforcement, I was mesmerized by Joseph Wambaugh’s account of the kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers in 1963, and the murder of one of them. Wambaugh unsympathetically details the stories of the two men convicted in the case, while at the same time humanizing the officer who survived and suffered from humiliation and guilt again and again throughout seven years of court proceedings against the men who kidnapped him and murdered his partner. The courtroom dialogue is verbatim, and to me, that leads to a feeling that the reader is actually there watching the proceedings. Wambaugh is a superb writer, and I consider this book is another must-read.\n\nBy Joseph Wambaugh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Onion Field as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A fascinating account of a double tragedy: one physical, the other psychological.”—Truman Capote\n\nThis is the frighteningly true story of two young cops and two young robbers whose separate destinies fatally cross one March night in a bizarre execution in a deserted Los Angeles field.\n\n“A complex story of tragic proportions . . . more ambitious than In Cold Blood and equally compelling!”—The New York Times\n\n“Once the action begins it is difficult to put the book down. . . . Wambaugh’s compelling account of this true story is destined for the bestseller lists.”—Library Journal\n\nPreview\n\nFrom Susan's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Susan Fleet Author\n\nWhy did Susan love this book?\n\nFor me, fascinating characters are the best part of a crime novel, and I love Maggie. She may be a dog, but she's smart and quite willing to tell you exactly what she's thinking.\n\nInjured while working as a bomb sniffer dog in Afghanistan, Maggie has now recovered, and she adores her new handler, LAPD K9 Specialist Scott James. She loves helping him capture bad guys, in this case, an obsessive-compulsive egomaniac who builds bombs in his house and sells them to terrorists.\n\nMr. Rollins has strict rules, and he will kill anyone who doesn't obey them, including Maggie and her beloved handler. Don't miss the thrilling showdown between Mr. Rollins and Maggie.\n\nBy Robert Crais,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Promise as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'One of the most entertaining thrillers of the year... THE PROMISE is filled with suspense, surprises and ably-drawn characters. ... putting him in the company of such greats as James Lee Burke, Sue Grafton, Stephen King and Elmore Leonard. THE PROMISE shows once again why he belongs there' WASHINGTON POST\n\nLoyalty, commitment, the fight against injustice - these are the things that have always driven Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. If they make a promise, they keep it. Even if it could get them killed.\n\nWhen Elvis Cole is hired to locate a woman who may have disappeared with a…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom Diane's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Diane Charney Author\n\nWhy did Diane love this book?\n\nI invented a category called Best Offbeat Memoirs because I’d written one.\n\nFearless about showing her flaws, Patchett was saved from illiteracy by a determined nun. If not for her dazzling self-discipline she might have remained a crackerjack waitress. When nobody showed up at a book signing, she looked around to observe what makes an independent bookstore tick.\n\nWhen book banners certain that first-year students at Clemson University would be turned into sex fiends, homosexuals, and drug addicts if they read her assigned book (sound familiar?) she gave the “kick-ass” speech printed here. Her three proud fathers adored her. Patchett’s no-nonsense but caring nature and sense of humor are the narrative thread that holds these diverse pieces together, making this a book to treasure.\n\nBy Ann Patchett,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'So compellingly personal you feel you're looking over her shoulder as she sits down to write' New York Times 'Electrically entertaining ... Funny, generous, spirited and kind' The Times This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage is an irresistible blend of literature and memoir revealing the big experiences and little moments that shaped Ann Patchett as a daughter, wife, friend and writer. Here, Ann Patchett shares entertaining and moving stories about her tumultuous childhood, her painful early divorce, the excitement of selling her first book, driving a Winnebago from Montana to Yellowstone Park, her joyous discovery of opera, scaling…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on crime thrillers that offer more than just thrills.\n\nBy Michael Prescott Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nEver since taking a college course in film noir, I've been in love with the cigarette-smoking, fedora-wearing, wisecracking tough guys (and gals) who inhabit the darkest corners of the modern world’s back alleys. The protagonist of Tears for the Dead, Bonnie Parker – named for the distaff half of Bonnie and Clyde – is my modest way of paying homage to this tradition, and incidentally having a lot of fun in the process.\n\nMichael's book list on crime thrillers that offer more than just thrills\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nGerald Petievich must have used a crystal ball when writingEarth Angels in 1989, because only nine years later, all the basic elements of the story would hit the headlines, as rogue elements within the LAPD were exposed in a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy known as the Rampart scandal. The book’s eerie prescience is only one reason it’s a modern classic. Its depiction of police procedure is almost unmatched in accuracy and detail, and it perfectly captures the dark, gritty side of Los Angeles, far away from the bright lights of movie premieres. If I ever need to remind myself why I left L.A. after twelve years, I only need to revisit Petievich’s open-eyed exposé of official corruption, casual lawlessness, and random violence.\n\nBy Gerald Petievich,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Earth Angels as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDetective Sergeant Jose Stepanovich and his elite tactical team were the toughest cops in the Los Angeles police force, handed the toughest jobs, like going up against the city's most vicious criminal element - the street gangs of East L.A. But somewhere along the lines the cops broke a few rules, turning a job into a personal vendetta, and suddenly it wasn't only the gangs they were fighting. It was the community, the media, and their own brass, who decided they were expendable. Hard-boiled Detective Stepanovich - returning to the barrio where he grew up to battle the criminals he…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on making your inner sleuth swoon.\n\nBy Jody Holford Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a romance, romantic comedy, and cozy mystery writer, I not only have a passion for the swoon-worthy moments when I’m creating them but crave them as a reader. There are so many great books out there but chemistry, particularly between a main character and her love interest, is what really makes me want more of a series. It’s not always easy to create that sigh-worthy-make-you-smile element of romance and love in a book that is geared toward solving a murder so I really appreciate when it’s done well. It’s not only enjoyable for me as a reader but a great example for me as a writer.\n\nJody's book list on making your inner sleuth swoon\n\nWhy did Jody love this book?\n\nThis book is adorable and hilarious. My favorite cozies have a heavy punch of romance and sparks in them and this one definitely fits the bill. Maddie lands herself in all the wrong places, at all the wrong times, with all the wrong people. Watching her back, and the rest of her, is an LAPD detective who doesn’t want to fall for her charms but, like readers, absolutely can’t help himself.\n\nBy Gemma Halliday,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Spying in High Heels as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 Amazon, New York Times & USA Today Bestselling series!

Delaware is a psychologist-detective based in Los Angeles, who works very closely with his good friend, Milo Sturgis, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. This story has them both looking back in time to a murder that Milo failed to solve. Between them they scour the “City of the Angels” and get to grips with this old case that never quite went away.\n\nBy Jonathan Kellerman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Murder Book as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTwisting, brutal and terrifying but ultimately redemptive, THE MURDER BOOK by New York Times No. 1 bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman, author of KILLER and BREAKDOWN, is recommended for fans of David Baldacci and Harland Coben.\n\n'Optimism is a feature of The Murder Book although the premise is macabre . . .

That’s why I brand myself as a writer of Victorian Whodunits with a touch of humor. I’ve spent decades learning about 1800s America. I began sharing that knowledge by performing in costume as real women of history. But I couldn’t be on stage all the time so I began writing the books I want to read, books that entertain while sticking to the basic facts of history and giving the flavor of an earlier time. I seek that great marriage of words that brings readers to a new understanding. As Albert Einstein said, “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”\n\nFedora's book list on that bring a touch of humor to the Old West\n\nWhy did Fedora love this book?\n\nThis book is laugh-out-loud funny. The rich socialite heroine is quite intelligent in some things and ridiculously stupid in others. The whole book is absolutely unbelievable, but utterly delightful – and way beyond society's terms of approval for women in 1907 Los Angeles. Sometimes a book doesn’t have to be anything but a joy to read. This one delivers.\n\nBy Jennifer Kincheloe,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Secret Life of Anna Blanc as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt's 1907 Los Angeles. Mischievous socialite Anna Blanc is the kind of young woman who devours purloined crime novels—but must disguise them behind covers of more domestically-appropriate reading. She could match wits with Sherlock Holmes, but in her world women are not allowed to hunt criminals.\n\nDetermined to break free of the era's rigid social roles, Anna buys off the chaperone assigned by her domineering father and, using an alias, takes a job as a police matron with the Los Angeles Police Department. There she discovers a string of brothel murders, which the cops are unwilling to investigate. Seizing her…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Nikki love this book?\n\nThis is a sci-fi thriller with amazing concepts and a page-turning story! Meet Hap Thompson – his job is to take on other people’s memories. He carries bad memories for a few hours and gets paid for the privilege. When he gets landed with a bad memory by someone who won’t take it back, he finds himself on the run. Then, people start disappearing… This is a fab read – refreshing different with some sci-fi elements, but still a thriller by nature. Michael Marshall Smith’s writing is both dark, humorous, and inventive. I wouldn’t say it’s a perfect novel but for the ideas about memory and forgetting, it delivers a lot.\n\nBy Michael Marshall Smith,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked One of Us as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA mesmerising SF thriller from a master of the genre.

Wambaugh was also a detective sergeant but with the LAPD. He paved the way for other cops, like me, who want to write books.\n\nAll of Wambaugh’s books are wonderful reads, but this is one I remember most because I read it as a teenager, and it blew me away. It delves into some of the tougher aspects of being a cop, though, and the negative side of police culture.\n\nBy Joseph Wambaugh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The New Centurions as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMeet the Los Angeles blues—a new breed of cop. From the baby-faced rookies to hashmark heroes, they are besieged men, dealing daily with a world coming apart. Hunting killers, quelling gang wars, fighting corruption, they risk death every day . . . every night.\n\nJoseph Wambaugh was a damn good cop and LAPD detective. For fifteen years he prowled the streets, solved murders, took his lumps. Now he’s the hard-hitting, tough-talking bestselling writer who tells the brutal, true stories of the men who risk their lives every time a siren screams.\n\nPraise for The New Centurions\n\n“As explosive as a…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did M.W. love this book?\n\nAlthough many fans consider Crais’s preceding book, L.A. Requiem, to be his masterpiece, I’ve chosen this because it perfectly encapsulates the relationship between flamboyant Elvis Cole and his partner, the enigmatic Joe Pike.\n\nPike is the ultimate sidekick. He’s taciturn, monosyllabic, and extremely complex. Dangerous as hell and completely loyal to Cole and anyone in Cole’s life; he’s taken bullets, knives—a whole bunch of weapons during the nineteen-book series.\n\nIn The Last Detective, the son of Cole’s girlfriend gets kidnapped and the evidence points to Cole’s service in Vietnam. Cole’s first call isn’t to the LAPD, it’s to Joe Pike. His message: ‘Joe, I’m scared.’ Pike drops everything and together they start hunting...\n\nPike is the third sidekick on my list to get his own series.\n\nBy Robert Crais,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Last Detective as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'THE LAST DETECTIVE is literally a thrill-a-minute read. Crais is on top form, which, believe me, is about as good as it gets. Don't miss it' INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY\n\n'The narrative is taut, the menace palpable, the suspense unbearable' DAILY TELEGRAPH\n\nElvis Cole has got a problem to solve - and this time it's personal.\n\nElvis Cole's girlfriend, Lucy, is out of town, and she has left her young son Ben in Elvis's care.
