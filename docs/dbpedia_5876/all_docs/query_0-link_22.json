        "text": "LIKE A ghost returning to the scene of the crime, Joseph Wambaugh was back on the streets of Hollywood. Nearly 40 years ago he had patrolled the fabled, sleazy boulevards as a Juvenile cop with the Los Angeles Police Department — long before he became a master of the modern police novel. Now he was back in town, researching new material for his first book about the LAPD in many years, and it was an uneasy homecoming.\n\n“I felt that I knew this place better than most, but there had been so many changes since I last wrote about Los Angeles,” the author said. “It felt weird to be back. I had to find out what was different here.”\n\nAs he cruised the neighborhood and interviewed dozens of cops, Wambaugh learned two things in a hurry: Hollywood and the LAPD have changed enormously since he began writing books such as “The New Centurions” and “The Onion Field” in the early 1970s. But the basic psychological makeup of the officers who patrol the streets was the same. Both of these elements form the main focus of his just-published novel, “Hollywood Station” (Little, Brown), a fast-paced, often surreal chronicle of contemporary police life in Los Angeles. The book is packed with scenes from the dark side of Sunset Boulevard and stark portraits of officers who patrol the streets filled with tourists, small merchants, runaways, hookers, pimps, petty criminals, druggies and vagrants.\n\nIn “Hollywood Station,” cops are struggling just to be cops. They chafe under the weight of the 2001 federal consent decree imposed on the LAPD in the wake of a department scandal. They have contempt for racial diversity guidelines that, they say, compel them to invent the names of white people interviewed in Hispanic and Asian areas. They speak cynically about the persistent threat of civil rights lawsuits making it impossible to do their jobs.\n\nCritics would counter that the department is paying the price for years of corruption and racial insensitivity. But amid this greatly changed policing landscape, the author found some psychological continuity.\n\n“The basic police personality has not changed,” Wambaugh said. “Firefighters are team players; they live to save people, to help people. But cops are not team players. They’re individualists. They’re in-your-face people. They go out every night not knowing if they’re going to save people, or hurt somebody or kill somebody. And they never wear their emotions on their sleeves. They keep it all inside. When they get home, it takes a toll on them, with divorce and suicides.”\n\nThe world of emotionally burned-out cops has been a recurring theme in Wambaugh’s fiction. But “Hollywood Station” shows a deepening sense of character and motivation; after 35 years of writing, his appreciation for the frustration that officers grapple with, especially as they age, has matured.\n\nAt 69, he still looks the part of a tough L.A. police officer. A trim, physically fit man with graying hair, he speaks in clipped, no-nonsense tones about daily life on the police force and his later years as a writer. On a recent sunny afternoon, as he relaxed on the patio of his San Diego home, his sunglasses and dark blue LAPD T-shirt made him look like a senior detective enjoying a day off.\n\nWidely regarded as the first writer to probe the inner lives of police officers in modern fiction and nonfiction, Wambaugh also is credited with influencing a spate of television shows including “Homicide: Life on the Street,” “Law & Order,” “NYPD Blue” and “Hill Street Blues” that have portrayed the complex psychology of cops on the beat. And “Hollywood Station” itself might be headed for the TV screen. Producer David E. Kelley — creator of “Boston Legal,” “The Practice” and other shows — recently optioned the book for a series. He and the author soon will begin writing a pilot script, aiming to re-create the raucous, outspoken cast of characters who drive the gritty, 338-page novel.\n\nWambaugh’s 17th book posed a special challenge: His goal was not just to describe the new Hollywood from a police officer’s viewpoint. He wanted to explain it in the context of the L.A. psyche.\n\n“There’s an old saying among LAPD members whenever something bizarre or surreal comes up from the streets of Hollywood,” Wambaugh noted. “They’ll say, ‘It’s Hollywood, it’s the heart of Los Angeles,’ just like they said ‘It’s Chinatown’ in the film. Hollywood, for an author, can become a dark mirror of the entire city.”\n\nIn returning to Los Angeles as a subject, he was also determined to show that he can still deliver the goods. Since he began writing in the late 1960s, the police procedural novel has exploded in popularity as an international genre.\n\nIn America, Michael\n\nConnelly, Jonathan and Faye Kellerman, James Ellroy, Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson and Ridley Pearson have become brand names.\n\nAlthough Wambaugh’s recent books have sold well and were well-received by critics, they have roamed topically far afield, focusing on criminal intrigue in the world of yachting and border patrols, and have included nonfiction titles about a Southern California arsonist and a rapist in the English midlands.\n\nThe idea of revisiting the LAPD, he said, came in part from Ellroy. “He kept saying to me, ‘You lived through this, and you’ve never ceased being an L.A. cop,’ which is true,” the author recalled. “I mean, I hang out with cops all the time, and I read everything about them. I look at the L.A. Times every day to see if there’s anything going on with the LAPD. Everybody who knows me knows I’ve never stopped.”\n\nBut reconnecting with this world was easier said than done. Wambaugh retired from the LAPD as a detective in the Hollenbeck Division in 1974, after the burgeoning celebrity generated by his first novels made it impossible to continue with his day job. From the patio of the Point Loma home he shares with Dee, his wife of 51 years, he began plotting his return to Hollywood.\n\nAlong the way, Wambaugh painted a cop’s-eye profile of Hollywood in flux: Although the area had long been a magnet for tourists, runaways and petty criminals, it was now plagued by gang violence. Redevelopment, however highly touted, had not fundamentally altered the area’s seedy feeling. As new immigrant groups were arriving, blacks were leaving.\n\nThe author used material wherever he found it. Some stories came from officers in San Diego but were transplanted into a Hollywood setting. Many characters were composites. By the end, Wambaugh wrote a book in which the most engaging people were veteran women police officers. He did not set out to do this, but he was hardly surprised when they stood out so dramatically in the mix.\n\n“The fact is that police work, especially in the investigative stages, is mostly about talk,” he said. “You have to be able to persuade people to talk to you. And women are more persuasive that way. They’re not afraid to talk, to reveal their true feeling or emotions — and that makes the person reporting a crime, or suspect or a victim, more ready to unload.”\n\nA little more than 15 years ago, Wambaugh declared in a Los Angeles Times interview that it was no longer outrageous to think a woman could be chief of the LAPD. He still believes this, and it shows that after so many years, Wambaugh still has a penchant for getting under the skin of department hard-liners.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, the son of a Catholic cop, his family moved to Southern California in 1951. He joined the Marines at 17, and became an LAPD officer in 1960. Unlike many of his colleagues, he hungered for a college education and got bachelor’s and master’s degrees in English by taking night courses at California State University, Los Angeles. After several failed stabs at short stories, he published his first novel in 1971.\n\n“The New Centurions” followed a group of recruits from the academy to the Watts riots, and it sparked anger among the brass. The debut was a shocker because it portrayed the lusty, profane side of a force previously personified by the stick-figure characters on “Dragnet.” He quickly followed with other best sellers, including “The Choirboys,” “The Black Marble” and “The Blue Knight.”\n\nFor all his success, however, Wambaugh has a sensitive ego when it comes to his legacy. Ever since he began writing, he said, he has been on the outs with a series of LAPD chiefs. Only the current chief, William J. Bratton, he said, has given Wambaugh the respect he believes he has earned by now as a writer and symbol of the department.\n\n“He (Bratton) invited me to an event at the academy and I talked and signed books all evening.”"
