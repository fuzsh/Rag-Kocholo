Emeagwali worked as a research scientist at a number of institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, the University of Wyoming, University of Michigan, and University of Minnesota from 1978 until 1996. In 1986 her research uncovered a bacteria that produced a certain enzyme. This was important because it was thought that the enzyme could be produced only by higher organisms. The discovery led to bacteria being considered a complex organism. Emeagwali also found a way to stop or slow down the growth of cancer cells. This finding opened a new path for cancer treatment.
