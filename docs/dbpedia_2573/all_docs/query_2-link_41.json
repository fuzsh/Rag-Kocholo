        "text": "Personal Statement\n\nDuring Dr. Dale Brown's private practice career, he delivered approximately 7,000 babies. Also during that time, he was one of the first five physicians in the world to deliver a baby from a mother who had received a heart transplant. In the early 1980's he participated with the pediatricians at Texas Children's Hospital in studies dealing with lung maturity, which today are routine practices. During his private practice years, Dr. Brown became known to have expertise in dermato vulvar pathology and has maintained that expertise throughout many years. He has been a co-author of publications dealing with benign diseases of the vulva and vagina. He is the author of the book, Benign Disease of the Vulva and Vagina. For over twenty-five years, he has been a member of the Newborn and Perinatal Obstetrics Committee both at Texas Children's Hospital and the Morbidity and Mortality Committee of the Neonatal ICU at Texas Children's Hospital. After terminating his obstetrical practice, Dr. Brown directed his Gyn practice to pelvic reconstructive surgery and that of the vulvology expertise. He has maintained that position until this time.\n\nDr. Brown, while being the interim chairman of the Department of OB/Gyn at Baylor , considered it a privilege to have been a leader of an exceptional group of physicians who are extremely dedicated, professional, and who exhibit comradeship in their pursuit of the mission of educational, clinical and research attributes of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. As we move to the arch of the future, the horizon is limitless for the advances in opportunities that may persist at the Maternity Center at Texas Children's Hospital.Dr. Brown did hold the postion as the first Obstetrician in Chief at Texas Children's Hospital.\n\nEducation\n\n,\n\n,\n\nOrganizations\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n* Texas Children’s Hospital physicians’ licenses and credentials are reviewed prior to practicing at any of our facilities.
