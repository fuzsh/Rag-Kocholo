        "text": "WWJ Newsradio 950 celebrates Black History Month by recognizing local, young African American professionals and their heroes.\n\nDETROIT (WWJ) - He uses non-violent techniques to prevent violence and he's become a master at it.\n\nCommander Dale Brown founded Detroit Threat Management -- a private security firm and bodyguard training school -- 19 years ago. His teams have protected the lives of many over the years, through their paid security work and their free bodyguard protection program, to those most vulnerable.\n\n\"And we help people in all communities. Let me be clear, 50% of the domestic violence victims that are sent to us by courts, domestic violence shelters, and now prosecutor's offices, these are people they think are going to be killed. Since there is no police organization that keeps people from being killed, specifically, we are tasked and we do it as a volunteer component of our bodyguard program for my self-defense school that I created,\" says Brown.\n\nHis inspiration in Black History was a monumental event in the nation's capital: the Million Man March.\n\n\"I took five of my students with me and we went to the Million Man March and it was the greatest experience ever. It showed millions of Black men coming together and having a peaceful, great time enjoying each other's company in a very positive environment,\" says Brown."
