        "text": "Cyntoia Brown will be released from prison on Wednesday, Aug. 7.\n\nIn January, then-Governor Bill Haslam granted clemency to the 31-year-old, who has spent nearly half her life behind bars.\n\nHaslam's move came one month after the Tennessee Supreme Court said Brown had to serve 51 years in prison before being eligible for release.\n\nBrown's bid for clemency captured the attention of celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and Rihanna.\n\nA jury found Brown guilty of killing Johnny Allen after going home with him when she was 16.\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Get the latest updates on Cyntoia Brown\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS: Bill Haslam met Cyntoia Brown in prison. He left feeling 'even better' about granting her clemency.\n\nBrown's advocates say she was forced into prostitution in fear of her life from an abusive boyfriend and was wronged by the legal system. Prosecutors say Brown killed the man to rob him.\n\nHere is a timeline of events:\n\nThe Cyntoia Brown story\n\nAUGUST 2004\n\nNashville real estate agent Johnny Allen is found naked with a gunshot wound to the back of his head in his Mossdale Drive home. Brown, 16, told police he picked her up at a Sonic Drive-in. Brown said she was a teen prostitute and shot Allen, 43, because she thought he was reaching for a gun under his bed.\n\nAUGUST 2006\n\nA jury convicts Brown of first-degree murder and robbery.\n\nOCTOBER 2006\n\nBrown is sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. State officials said the law dictated that she serve at least 51 years before becoming eligible for release. Prosecutors pushed for more time because of aggravated robbery and other factors in the crime.\n\nMARCH 2011\n\nPBS documentary \"Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story\" airs nationally, bringing new attention to Brown's case.\n\nJUNE 2012\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court rules that mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles violate Eighth Amendment prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nNOVEMBER 2012\n\nDefense attorneys push for a new trial and introduce new evidence about Brown having had fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nNOVEMBER 2017\n\nSuperstar musician Rihanna again brings attention to Brown's case with the #FREECYNTOIABROWN Instagram post.\n\nMAY 2018\n\nThe state board of parole gives Gov. Bill Haslam a split recommendation on Brown's application for clemency.\n\nTwo members vote to recommend that the governor grant clemency, allowing for her release from prison. Two vote to recommend that Haslam deny her clemency bid, meaning she would continue to serve a life sentence. Two others recommend the governor reduce Brown's sentence so she could be released after 25 years.\n\nJUNE 2018\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals hears arguments on whether Brown's life sentence is constitutional. During the hearing, Brown's lawyers said state sentencing laws conflicted, making it unclear if Brown would be required to serve 51 years or life without parole. The panel of judges agreed Tennessee's sentencing laws were confusing and contradictory.\n\nJULY 2018\n\nHaslam receives a copy of the parole board's report, which is thousands of pages long. His legal team begins its review of the case.\n\nAUGUST 2018\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals asks the Tennessee Supreme Court to clarify the state's seemingly contradictory sentencing laws.\n\nDECEMBER 2018\n\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court issues a unanimous decision that says defendants convicted of first-degree murder on or after July 1, 1995, and sentenced to life in prison become eligible for release after serving a minimum of 51 years in prison. Its answer will inform the deliberations at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nHaslam says his team is still considering Brown's clemency petition and that he expects to announce a decision before leaving office in January.\n\nJANUARY 2019\n\nHaslam grants Brown's request for clemency, making her eligible for release later this year.\n\nAUGUST 2019\n\nBrown is released from the Tennessee Prison for Women about 3:20 a.m on August 7.\n\n\"I'm rejoicing,\" her attorney Charles Bone said. \"We are confident she'll be as successful as a free woman as she had been as an incarcerated woman, but it is a totally different journey.\"\n\nShe will be on parole for 10 years.\n\nConditions of her parole include her compliance with an approved release plan, that she maintain employment or educational enrollment and that she participate in regular counseling sessions, TDOC spokeswoman Dorinda Carter said. She's also required to perform at least 50 hours of community service, including working with at-risk youth"
