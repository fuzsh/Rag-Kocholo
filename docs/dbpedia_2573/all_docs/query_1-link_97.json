However, a number of characteristics require a contingent approach to these investigations. This book describes the process of conducting private internal investigations by fraud examiners and presents a number of reports from the United States, Sweden and Norway. It evaluates a number of internal investigation reports to reflect on the practice of fraud examinations. Empirical studies provide a basis to reflect theoretically on practice improvements for fraud examiners. Rather than presenting normative recommendations based on ideal or stereotypical situations so often found in existing books, this book develops guidelines based on empirical study of current practice. Internal investigations should uncover the truth about misconduct or crime without damaging the reputation of innocent employees. Typical elements of an inquiry include collection and examination of written and recorded evidence, interviews with suspects and witnesses, data in computer systems, and network forensics. Internal inquiries may take many forms depending upon the nature of the conduct at issue and the scope of the investigation. There should be recognition at the outset of any investigation that certain materials prepared during the course of the investigation may eventually be subject to disclosure to law enforcement authorities or other third parties. The entire investigation should be conducted with an eye towards preparing a final report. As evidenced in this book, private fraud examiners take on complicated roles in private internal investigations and often fail in their struggle to reconstruct the past in objective ways characterized by integrity and accountability.

Signal detection theory may shed some light on why some fraud examiners discover and disclose more facts than other examiners. Signal detection theory holds that the detection of a stimulus depends on both the intensity of the stimulus and the physical and psychological state of the individual. A detectorâs ability to detect â or likelihood of detecting â some stimulus is affected by the intensity of the stimulus (e.g. how loud a whistleblowing is) and the detectorâs physical and psychological state (e.g. how alert the person is). Perceptual sensitivity depends upon the perceptual ability of the observer to detect a signal or target or to discriminate signal from non-signal events (Szalma and Hancock, 2013). Furthermore, detecting persons may have varying ability to discern between information-bearing recognition (called pattern) and random patterns that distract from information (called noise). Under signal detection theory, some researchers found that people more frequently and incorrectly identify negative task-related words as having been presented originally than positive words, even when they were not present. Liu et al. (2014) found that people have lax decision criteria for negative words. In a different study, Huff and Bodner (2013) applied the signal detection approach to determine whether changes in correct and false recognition following item-specific versus relational encoding were driven by a decrease in the encoding of memory information or an increase in monitoring at test. According to the theory, there are a number of determinants of how a person will detect a signal. In addition to signal intensity, signal alertness and pattern recognition, there are factors such as personal competence (including knowledge, skills and attitude), experience and expectations. These factors determine the threshold level. Low signal intensity, low signal alertness and limited pattern recognition combined with low competence, lack of experience and lack of expectations\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nwill lead to a high threshold level, meaning that the individual will not detect white-collar crime. The competence of private investigators is a concern. For several decades the public police have striven to achieve professional status, arguing that their work is a skilled activity requiring long and in-depth training. Private policing, which is not regulated by statute in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States or Norway, directly challenges this premise. People are not required to undergo any form of training in order to set up as fraud examiners (Gill and Hart, 1997). In his book on signal detection theory, Wickens (2001) asks us to consider what happens when a person must decide whether or not an event has occurred, using information that is insufficient to completely determine the correct answer. Without sufficient information, some errors are inevitably made. The typical signal detection situation is perceptual. The person, usually known as the observer, is presented with a noisy stimulus, and the person must decide if that stimulus contains a weak signal. Fraud investigation is like any other investigation concerned with past events. However, a number of characteristics require a contingent approach to whitecollar crime investigations, as we limit our case studies to white-collar offenders. Ever since Edwin Sutherland (1939) coined the term white-collar crime, researchers in the field have emphasized the value of preventing and detecting fraud by executives and other members of the elite in society (Piquero and Benson, 2004). The typical profile of a white-collar criminal includes attributes such as high social status, considerable influence and access to resources (Blickle et al., 2006; Dearden, 2016; FÃ¼ss and Hecker, 2008). White-collar crime is committed in the course of an occupation where the offender can carry out and conceal the offense among legal activities in an organizational context (Arnulf and Gottschalk, 2013). The white-collar offender is a person of respectability and high social status who commits financial crime in the course of his or her occupation (Leasure and Zhang, 2017). Fraud investigation endeavors to find out what happened in the past. A negative event or a sequence of negative events can be at the core of an investigation. If there is no certainty about events, or signals about aspects of events are not detected, then an investigation can become a failure. An investigation can be concerned with events that did occur or events that did not occur. Information is collected and knowledge is applied to reconstruct the past. Fraud investigators need to have both a theoretical and empirical understanding of white-collar crime. The theory of convenience is introduced in this book to explain what white-collar offenders do. Convenience is a phenomenon that can be observed in many aspects of human life. For example, convenience stores and convenience shopping are associated with easy access to goods and services. A theory of convenience can be applied to a number of areas where people prefer alternatives that are associated with savings in time and effort, and also with avoidance of pain and problems. For example, a convenience theory of cheating suggests that cheating is a preferred alternative in certain situations.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nIn this book we focus on convenience theory as convenience relates to whitecollar misconduct and crime. Convenience theory attempts to integrate various theoretical explanations for the occurrence of white-collar misconduct and crime; it suggests that organizational opportunity to commit and conceal financial crime is at the core of deviant behavior to avoid threats and exploit possibilities. This book presents an empirical test of convenience theory by content analysis of investigation reports by fraud examiners. Empirical evidence suggests that convenience orientation was indeed present among suspected offenders. This book is concerned with offenders rather than criminals. To offend is to cause displeasure, anger, resentment or wounded feelings. It is to be displeasing or disagreeable. It can also be to violate a moral, a guideline, a rule or a law. Convenience theory was introduced to integrate a number of theoretical approaches to explain and understand white-collar crime that was first defined by Sutherland (1939). Convenience theory applies the concept of convenience in terms of savings in time and effort (Farquhar and Rowley, 2009), as well as avoidance of pain and obstacles (Higgins, 1997). A convenient individual is not necessarily either bad or lazy. On the contrary, the person can be seen as smart and rational (SundstrÃ¶m and Radon, 2015). Convenience theory suggests that white-collar crime is committed if crime is a convenient alternative compared to other alternatives in times of crisis and/or possibilities. Convenience can be found in three dimensions (Gottschalk, 2017). In the economical dimension, the motive is avoidance of crisis or exploration and exploitation of possibilities. In the organizational dimension, there is opportunity to commit and conceal financial crime. In the behavioral dimension, individuals demonstrate a readiness for deviant behaviors. This book presents a study in search of empirical evidence of convenience theory by content analysis of reports of investigations by fraud examiners. Fraud examiners from large accounting, auditing, consulting and law firms are typically hired by private and public organizations when there is suspicion of misconduct and crime (Schneider, 2006). The client organization receives a report of investigation where fraud examiners describe their procedures and findings (Brooks and Button, 2011). From a resource-matching perspective, convenience directly relates to the amount of time and effort (resources) that must be dedicated to accomplishing a task. However, convenience involves more than a simple examination of ease of use perceptions that also addresses the amount of effort in an interaction. Ease of use is the degree to which an alternative action is free of effort. Convenience addresses the time and effort exerted before, during and after an action or avoidance of action (Collier and Kimes, 2013). Fraud investigation is often carried out by examiners from global auditing firms and local law firms. They document their work and their findings in reports of investigations. Reports are the property of the client organization and are seldom disclosed to the public; they are also often not disclosed to the police (Gottschalk and Tcherni-Buzzeo, 2017). We were able to find a number of reports in the\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnited States and in Scandinavia for this book. These reports represent our case studies in the book. Chapter 1 starts by presenting perspectives introduced by Edwin Sutherland on white-collar crime. Then different perspectives on white-collar crime are discussed, such as offense and offender characteristics, occupational and corporate crime differences, and the special sensitivity hypothesis. Several convicted white-collar criminals have written their autobiographies, and an example is presented in this chapter. Chapter 2 presents the theory of convenience as a way of understanding white-collar crime occurrences. The financial motive can be based on both threats and possibilities. The organizational opportunity is concerned with both execution and concealment of crime. The deviant behavior is concerned with the willingness to be a white-collar offender. Chapter 3 develops convenience theory into research propositions that can further guide both theoretical and empirical understanding of white-collar crime. A number of well-known perspectives from criminology, management, sociology, psychology and other fields are integrated into the convenience hypothesis. Chapter 4 introduces crime signal detection theory, where crime signal detection rests on four pillars. First, the intensity of the signal is important for the potential receiver of the signal. Next, the receiverâs awareness can determine whether or not the receiver notices a signal. Third, the ability of the receiver to carry out pattern recognition will determine to what extent the receiver is able to allocate a new piece of information in a relevant spot in the investigation puzzle. Finally, the extent of personal experience with signals will influence to what extent the receiver is able to reflect on and interpret the new signal as well as have an understanding of the context in which the signal emerged. Chapter 5 introduces reports of investigations by fraud examiners. Financial crime specialists and certified fraud examiners carry out fraud investigations in client organizations. A comparison of police versus internal investigations is presented. Chapter 6 presents a sample of 60 investigation reports from Norway. Seven of these investigation reports are presented in detail as they led to imprisonment of white-collar criminals. In addition, the case of fraud by the CEO in a nongovernment organization (NGO) is presented. Chapter 7 presents more investigations in Norway, in addition to a case in Sweden and a case in Denmark. Chapter 8 is devoted to fraud investigations in the United States where internal investigations were carried out and reports possible to find for research. The case studies are all concerned with white-collar offenders who were sentenced to prison. Chapter 9 is also devoted to fraud investigations in the United States where internal investigations were carried out and reports possible to find for research. However, none of the suspects were prosecuted in these cases. One important purpose of the case studies is for the reader to reflect on signal detection, looking both at signals of crime and signals of innocence.\n\n1 WHITE-COLLAR CRIME RESEARCH\n\nEver since Sutherland (1939) coined the term white-collar crime, there has been extensive research and debate about what to include and what to exclude from this offense category (e.g. Piquero and Benson, 2004; Pontell et al., 2014; Stadler et al., 2013). In accordance with Sutherlandâs original work, convenience theory emphasizes the position and trust enjoyed by the offender in an occupational setting. Therefore, the organizational dimension is the core of convenience theory where the offender has access to resources to commit and conceal financial crime. The typical profile of a white-collar criminal includes the following attributes (Piquero and Benson, 2004; Pontell et al., 2014; Stadler et al., 2013): â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢\n\nThe person has high social status and considerable influence, enjoying respect and trust, and belongs to the elite in society. The elite generally have more knowledge, money and prestige and occupy higher positions than other individuals in the population occupy. Privileges and authority by the elite are often not visible or transparent, but known to everybody. Elite members are active in business, public administration, politics, congregations and many other sectors in society. The elite are a minority that behaves as an authority towards others in the majority. The person is often wealthy and does not really need crime income to live a good life. The person is typically well educated and connected to important networks of partners and friends. The person exploits his or her position to commit financial crime. The person does not look at themselves as a criminal, but rather as a community builder who applies personal rules to their own behavior.\n\n6\n\nâ¢ â¢\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nThe person may be in a position that makes the police reluctant to initiate a crime investigation. The person has access to resources that enable the involvement of top defense attorneys and can behave in court in a manner that creates sympathy among the public, partly because the defendant belongs to the upper class, like the judge, the prosecutor and the attorney.\n\nHowever, one of the theoretical challenges facing scholars in this growing field of research is to develop an accepted definition of white-collar crime. While the main characteristics are the foundation, such as economic crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of an occupation, other aspects lack precision (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017).\n\nEdwin Sutherland Edwin Sutherland is one of the most cited criminologists in the history of the criminology research field. Sutherlandâs work has inspired and motivated a large number of scholars in the field associated with his work. His ideas influence, challenge and incentivize researchers. Sutherlandâs research on white-collar crime is based on his own differential association theory. This learning theory of deviance focuses on how individuals learn to become criminals. Differential association theory assumes that criminal behavior is learned in interaction with other persons. Sutherlandâs (1939, 1949) concept of white-collar crime has been influential for various reasons. First, there is Sutherlandâs engagement with criminologyâs neglect of the kinds of crime committed by powerful and influential members of the elite in society. Next, there is the extent of damage caused by whitecollar crime. Sutherland emphasized the disproportionate extent of harm caused by the crime of the wealthy in comparison to the much researched and popular focus on crime by the poor and the equally disproportionate level of social control responses. Third, there is the focus on organizational offenders, where crime occurs in the course of their occupations. A white-collar criminal is a person who, through the course of their occupation, utilizes their respectability and high social status to perpetrate an offense. Fourth, the construction of the corporation as an offender indicates that organizations can also be held accountable for misconduct and crime. Finally, there is the ability to theorize the deviant behaviors of elite members. Many researchers have been inspired by Sutherlandâs groundbreaking criticism of mainstream criminology as neglecting the crime of the upper class and focusing attention on the crime of the poor. This was a major insight that began a dramatic shift and broadening in the subject matter of criminology that continues today. Sutherlandâs long-lasting influence on criminological, sociological and more recently also on management thinking is observable across the globe, but in particular in the United States and Europe. Sutherland exposed crime by people who were thought of as almost superior, people who apparently did not need to offend as a means of survival. Businesspersons and professionals frequently commit serious\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\n7\n\nwrongdoing and harm with little fear of facing criminal justice scrutiny. It may be true that poverty and powerlessness are a cause of one kind of crime while excessive power can be a cause of another kind of crime. Sutherland exemplified the corporation as an offender in the case of war crime, when corporations profit massively by abusing the state of national emergency during times of war. Corporate form and its characteristics as a profit-maximizing entity shape war profiteering. It is powerful organizations that may commit environmental crime, war profiteering, state-corporate crime and human rights violations. While Sutherlandâs concept of white-collar crime has enlightened sociologists, criminologists and management researchers, the concept may have confused attorneys, judges and lawmakers. In most jurisdictions there is no offense labeled white-collar crime. There are offenses such as corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion, fraud and insider trading, but no white-collar crime offense. Sutherlandâs contribution to the challenge of concepts such as law and crime can be considered one of the strengths of his work as he showed that laws and legal distinctions are politically and socially produced in very specific ways. For lawmakers there is nothing intrinsic to the character of white-collar offenses that makes them somehow different from other types of offense. One reason for this confusion is that white-collar crime in Sutherlandâs research is both a crime committed by a specific type of person and a specific type of crime. Later research has indicated, as applied in this book, that white-collar crime is not a specific type of crime, it is only a crime committed by a specific type of person. However, white-collar crime may indeed emerge some time in the future as a kind of crime suitable for law enforcement, as Sutherland envisaged in his offender-based approach to crime, focusing on characteristics of the individual offender to determine the categorization of the type of crime. Sutherlandâs broader engagement with criminological and sociological theory in general, such as his theory of differential association and social learning, has been and remains influential. One aspect of the theory of differential association â social disorganization â has had a significant influence on later researchers. Sutherlandâs work is the foundation of all teaching, research and policing of white-collar crime today.\n\nOffense characteristics White-collar crime is illegal acts that violate responsibility or public trust for personal or organizational gain. It is an act or a series of acts committed by non-physical means and by concealment to obtain money or property or to obtain business or personal advantage (Leasure and Zhang, 2017). White-collar crime is a unique area of criminology due to its atypical association with societal influence compared to other types of criminal offenses. White-collar crime is defined by its relationship to status, opportunity and access. This is the offender-based perspective. In contrast, offense-based approaches to white-collar crime emphasize the actions and nature of the illegal act as the defining agent.\n\n8\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nIn their comparison of the two approaches, Benson and Simpson (2015) discuss how offender-based definitions emphasize societal characteristics such as high social status, power and respectability of the actor. Because status is not included in the definition of offense-based approaches and status is free to vary independently from the definition in most legislation, an offense-based approach allows measures of status to become external explanatory variables. Benson and Simpson (2015) approach white-collar crime utilizing the opportunity perspective. They stress the idea that individuals with more opportunities to offend, with access to resources to offend and who hold organizational positions of power are more likely to commit white-collar crime. Opportunities for crime are shaped and distributed according to the nature of economic and productive activities of various business and government sectors within society. Benson and Simpson (2015) do not limit their opportunity perspective to activities in organizations. However, they emphasize that opportunities are normally greater in an organizational context. Convenience theory, however, assumes that crime committed in an organizational context is to be called white-collar crime. This is in line with Sutherlandâs (1939, 1949) original work, where he emphasized profession and position as key characteristics of offenders.\n\nOffender characteristics The white-collar offender is a person of respectability and high social status who commits financial crime in the course of his or her occupation (Leasure and Zhang, 2017). In the offender-based perspective, white-collar criminals tend to possess many characteristics consistent with expectations of high status in society. There is both attained status and ascribed status among white-collar offenders. Attained status refers to status that is accrued over time and with some degree of effort, such as education and income. Ascribed status refers to status that does not require any specific action or merit but rather is based on more physically observable characteristics, such as race, age and gender. The main offender characteristics remain privilege and upper class. Early perception studies suggest that the public think that white-collar crime is not as serious as other forms of crime. Most people think that street criminals should receive harsher punishments. One explanation for this view is self-interest (Dearden, 2017: 311): Closely tied to rational choice, self-interest suggests that people have views that selfishly affect themselves. Significant scholarly research has been devoted to self-interest-based views. In laboratory conditions, people often favor redistribution taxes when they would benefit from such a tax. This self-interest extends into non-experimental settings as well. For example, smokers often view increasing smoking taxes less favorably than non-smokers do. In this line of thinking, people may be more concerned about burglary and physical violence that may hurt them. They may be less concerned about white-collar crime\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\n9\n\nthat does not affect them directly. Maybe those who are financially concerned with their own economic well-being will be more concerned with white-collar crime (Dearden, 2017). White-collar perpetrators have social power associated with different occupational activities across society. Power and authority in the hands of individuals enable white-collar crime. The power essentially comes from the positions individuals legitimately occupy.\n\nGender perspectives Research has suggested a relationship between gender and tax compliance, with men being more likely to commit tax offenses than women. Research on tax evasion has both an offender-based perspective and an offense-based perspective. Wealthy individuals have more opportunities to avoid tax compliance and to benefit more heavily from it. In addition, lack of tax compliance can be organized in a professional setting, where the business enterprise manipulates accounting for the purpose of tax evasion. Status affects the ability of individuals to avoid detection or sanctions for non-compliance and the opportunity to commit a variety of tax offenses are status based. Tax compliance can be the result of interaction between authority and expectations, where both authority and expectations are based on individual status. The offense-based approach to defining white-collar crime is also fitting when examining tax offenses. The actions of being non-compliant dictate that the offense itself is considered a crime. A special kind of tax offense is bank deposits in tax havens. As documented by Andersen et al. (2017: 2), banks help politicians and others transform petroleum rents and other assets into hidden wealth by bank deposits in tax havens: Political elites abuse public office to extract rents. Even moderate levels of political rents may have socially undesirable effects, through the adverse selection of political candidates and by distorting political incentives. In countries without strong democratic governance, political rents can be substantial and the economic and political consequences severe. When white-collar offenders are brought to justice, Supernor (2017: 148) found that âa lot more women were given community service than menâ because âwomen are considered homemakers for families, and the court systems do not want to punish a woman in a way that would take her away from her familyâ.\n\nOccupational and business crime A distinction in white-collar offenses can be made between occupational crime and business crime. Occupational crime is committed by persons in an organizational setting for purely personal gain and to the detriment of the organization. Business\n\n10\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\ncrime is committed by or on behalf of the organization for profit or enhancement (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). Of course, in business crime organizations cannot commit illegal acts independently of human agents. Occupational crime is typically committed under conditions of low levels of socialization and weak accountability. Employees may be unfamiliar with organizational goals, or simply ignore them, while at the same time making efforts to achieve personal goals due to weak restraints by the accountability system. The presence of occupational crime may be symptomatic of larger failures in an organizationâs system since an organization without committed and accountable employees suggests a higher likelihood of failing in the end. Occupational crime tends to be committed by privileged individuals who feel no attachment to the organization and who do so for purely personal gain (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). Business crime, on the other hand, is typically committed under conditions of high levels of socialization and strong accountability. Employees identify with not only the organization but also its goals. The pursuit of organizational goals over individual goals does not imply the absence of crime. Rather, achievement of organizational goals becomes so important that if it cannot be done in legal ways, dedicated employees do it in illegal ways (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). Both occupational and business crime are committed within the organizational context. Corporate crime is committed for business advantage. Examples of corporate crime include cartels and corruption. Illegal price fixing and market sharing occur in cartels to enable participants in cartels to achieve more profits. Bribes are offered to potential customers, allies and public officials to enable contracts and licenses (Leasure and Zhang, 2017).\n\nConvicted white-collar criminals It is often argued that convicted white-collar criminals have a hard time in prison. They have to leave all their privileges and opportunities behind to join a community dominated by street crime inmates. The argument is formulated in the special sensitivity hypothesis, which suggests a relatively tougher everyday life for white-collar crime inmates compared to street crime inmates. However, empirical studies of white-collar inmates do not support the special sensitivity hypothesis. Rather, empirical studies support the special resilience hypothesis, which suggests that white-collar offenders are able to adapt to prison life more successfully than other inmates. In this section we argue that the theory of convenience can provide support for the special resilience hypothesis. If a white-collar criminal should end up in jail, defense attorneys work hard to make prison life as easy as possible for the client. Attorneys argue that it is much worse for a member of the elite to end up in prison than for other people. After a short while, the white-collar offender typically gets most of his freedom back in an imprisonment setting to avoid too much damage (Gottschalk, 2014). However, research indicates that it is easier for a white-collar criminal than for a\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\n11\n\nstreet criminal to spend time in prison. White-collar offenders tend to find new friends more readily and are able to sleep all night, while most other inmates may have trouble sleeping and making friends in prison (Dhami, 2007; Stadler et al., 2013). Stadler and Benson (2012: 494) argue that the feeling of innocence is a characteristic of many white-collar criminals: Indeed, a distinguishing feature of the psychological makeup of white-collar offenders is thought to be their ability to neutralize the moral bind of the law and rationalize their criminal behavior. Stadler and Benson (2012) base their argument on an empirical study that they conducted among prison inmates. Almost without exception, white-collar inmates denied responsibility for crime. They applied techniques of neutralization (Sykes and Matza, 1957). Other inmates felt to a much larger extent responsibility for crime. That the feeling of innocence is a characteristic of white-collar criminals was also confirmed in a study by Dhami (2007), who interviewed inmates in a prison in the UK. Evidence of neutralization by denial of responsibility can be found in autobiographies by white-collar criminals such as Bogen (2008), Eriksen (2010), Fosse and Magnusson (2004), and Kerik (2015). Bernard B. Kerik was a former police commissioner in New York who served three years in prison. He seems to deny responsibility, to condemn his condemners and to suggest normality of action. Evidence of neutralization can also be found in autobiographies by people who were accused of misconduct but never prosecuted or convicted. An example is ex-Lehman CFO Erin Callan, who presents herself as a victim rather than as an offender (Montella, 2016). In this article we argue that there is lack of evidence for the special sensitivity hypothesis for white-collar inmates. The autobiography by Kerik (2015) is used for our case study of lack of evidence. Rather, there is support for the special resilience hypothesis that we discuss in terms of convenience theory (Gottschalk, 2016c, 2017).\n\nSpecial sensitivity hypothesis The idea that white-collar criminals are especially sensitive to imprisonment is based on the premise that they are of higher status than street criminals. They belong to the elite in society and their fall from grace is much greater, since the higher people fly, the further they fall. White-collar offenders have greater investment in the prevailing social order and have more to lose. Stadler et al. (2013) argue that a belief is commonly held by those in the criminal justice system that white-collar offenders are ill equipped to adjust to the rigors of prison life. According to the special sensitivity hypothesis, the claim is made that white-collar offenders experience the pains of imprisonment to a greater degree than traditional street offenders.\n\n12\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nUpon incarceration, they lose their direct influence and authority over people in business and private life, they lose their direct access to resources that enable them to do almost whatever they like, and they lose their self-identity characterized by position, trust and profession. They enter a world that is foreign to them. They leave a hierarchy in society where they held positions at the top and join a hierarchy in prison where they are far from the top. Those with physical prowess and criminal connections â such as members of global biker gangs â rule prison life. White-collar offenders find few of the equals with whom they have socialized most of their lives so far. The majority in most prisons is populated by poor and minority group members. In Northern European prisons, for example, the majority consists of refugees and immigrants who ended up on the wrong side of the law. Stadler et al. (2013) argue that the special sensitivity of white-collar offenders has been cited as a reason for the supposed leniency with which they have been punished traditionally. Their argument is based on a study by Mann et al. (1979), who found that American judges handed down lighter sentences to white-collar criminals because of an a priori assumption that they would not cope well with the prison environment. Judges apparently assumed that white-collar offenders were not socialized into the ways of the majority of the prison population simply because they come from the upper echelon of society. It was therefore assumed that the experience from arrest to imprisonment would be especially traumatic for white-collar criminals compared to street criminals. The special sensitivity hypothesis assumes that the transition from a life of freedom and privilege to one of strict regulation and material deprivation is likely to be particularly shocking to newly incarcerated white-collar inmates. The hypothesis implies that white-collar offenders have more to lose than other offenders by going to prison. The hypothesis considers as extra burden the stigmatization experienced as a result of prestigious job loss, media coverage of the court case, asset recovery by the government, family breakup, reputation damage within the community, withdrawn professional licenses and dismissal from the elite. The hypothesis suggests that these circumstances far exceed what street criminals have to go through after detection and conviction (Logan, 2015). The idea that white-collar offenders are especially sensitive to the pains of imprisonment was developed with high-status offenders in mind. The idea stems from the fact that they differ substantially from other offenders with respect to their social and other background characteristics, as well as their experience with the criminal justice system (Logan, 2015: 11): In light of these differences, members of the criminal justice community â namely judges â have argued that indoctrination to prison life is particularly shocking for newly incarcerated white-collar offenders. Similarly, these individuals maintain that typical street offenders, who often come from more disadvantaged backgrounds, are far less susceptible to the pains of imprisonment.\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\n13\n\nStadler et al. (2013: 1092) formulate the idea in a similar way, where the special sensitivity hypothesis is based on the undeniable fact that white-collar offenders are different from street offenders with regard to their backgrounds: Because they would be transitioning from a life of freedom and privilege to a life with little or no liberty and possessions, incarceration is assumed to be especially shocking for white-collar offenders. In contrast, street offenders typically live more deprived lives and would therefore experience less of a culture shock upon incarceration. Mann et al. (1979: 487) interviewed judges to explore their reasons and motivations for the special sensitivity hypothesis and got answers like the two following responses: A white-collar criminal has more of a fear of going to jail than this syndrome we find in the street crime. And I am not saying that if you cut everyone they donât bleed red blood. A person who commits a robbery or an assault, they donât want to go to jail either. But the white-collar criminal has more to lose by going to jail; reputation in community, business as well as social community, decent living conditions, just the whole business of being put in a prison with a number on his back demeans this tremendous ego that is always involved in people who are high achievers. It can be a major disruption for the family, for the individual. It may undermine his whole career. I can probably better understand the whitecollar defendant. He is more like me and that probably â I guess I do believe that white-collar defendants are more sensitive to and more affected by the prison experience. Defense attorneys are active supporters of the special sensitivity hypothesis. Their support comes as no surprise, since the magnitude of billable hours involved in white-collar defense far exceeds what is feasible in street crime defense. Often, attorneys are hired to contribute symbolic defense and information control, in addition to substance defense. They continue to work for their clients after conviction (Gottschalk, 2014). Stadler et al. (2013: 1094) found that Almost without exception, defense attorneys argue that merely convicting a white-collar offender results in enough suffering. Prison, it is argued, would be an especially difficult hardship for these individuals because of their social background. The special sensitivity hypothesis may seem particularly relevant in prison settings that are poorly managed and marked by high levels of inmate violence and other forms of victimization. In such environments, white-collar inmates can prove attractive targets and be neglected by lack of guardianship (Stadler et al., 2013).\n\n14\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nSensitivity testing The special sensitivity hypothesis has been tested by Dhami (2007) in the United Kingdom and by Stadler et al. (2013) and Logan (2015) in the United States. None of these three empirical studies found any support for the hypothesis that white-collar offenders have a special sensitivity to imprisonment. Dhami (2007) explored how white-collar prisoners perceived the reactions of the judiciary, media, significant others, prison staff and other inmates towards them and how these offenders perceived their own offending behavior. The study in the United Kingdom indicates that it may be easier for a white-collar criminal than a street criminal to spend time in prison. Interviews with 14 white-collar offenders revealed that they perceived the reaction from the criminal justice system and the media as negative, but the reaction of others, including other inmates, as positive. Stadler et al. (2013: 1101) found no support for the suggestion that white-collar offenders experience more pain and cope less well within the society of captives: Based on a sample of 366 federal prison inmates, we assessed the special sensitivity hypothesis. The analysis revealed that white-collar inmates are not more likely to experience negative prison adjustment. In some regards, white-collar inmates had fewer institutional problems and were more likely to cope with prison life successfully. Results thus call into question the merits of the special sensitivity hypothesis and are consistent with the view expressed earlier by Michael Benson and Francis Cullen that white-collar offenders may possess attributes and resources sufficient for their successful adaptation to life in prison. Stadler et al. (2013) measured inmate adjustment to prison by statements such as: (i) experience difficulties in prison; (ii) trouble sleeping; (iii) evidence of need for safety in prison; (iv) problems with current or former cellmate; and (v) having no friends in prison. Response analysis indicates that white-collar offenders in the United States are not more likely to experience prison adjustment problems than non-white-collar offenders. For two of the five measures, white-collar inmates were significantly less likely to experience problems. Fewer white-collar offenders experienced general prison difficulties compared to the general inmate group, and a larger percentage of white-collar offenders made friends in the prison. Fewer white-collar offenders experienced problems with former or current cellmates. White-collar offenders seemed less in need of safety in prison. Logan (2015) used nationally representative prison data based on inmatesâ self-reports in the United States and studied four domains of prison life: â¢\n\nâ¢\n\nVictimization: Were inmates injured in a fight, assault or incident in which someone tried to hurt them? No difference was found between white-collar and non-white-collar inmates with respect to experiencing victimization in prison. Prison conduct: Had inmates violated prison rules and been subject to disciplinary action? Compared to other inmates, white-collar criminals showed\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nâ¢\n\nâ¢\n\n15\n\nsignificantly less substance abuse-related misconduct. White-collar offenders were significantly less likely than other inmates to be written up for carrying weapons. White-collar offenders were less likely than other inmates to be involved in verbal or physical altercations with prison staff. Psychological adjustment: Did inmates have feelings of negative affect, receive treatment for mental health disorders and experience symptoms of mental health disorder? White-collar offenders were no more likely than other inmates to develop feelings of negative affect while incarcerated. White-collar offenders were no more likely to be in need of mental disorder treatment. Participation in prison programs: Did inmates participate in employment counseling and life skills and community adjustment classes? White-collar offenders were more likely than other inmates to score higher on the program participation scale.\n\nAs an alternative to the special sensitivity hypothesis, Logan (2015) introduced the special resilience hypothesis. Resilience is the ability to cope with change. White-collar criminals may in fact fare better in prison than other inmates. Whitecollar offenders often have greater amounts of personal and social capital, including higher levels of education and closer ties to family than other offenders. They are more likely to adopt non-criminal identities. White-collar inmates may have greater emotional and psychological resources than other inmates. Such factors can be linked to reduced stress in prison.\n\nThe Kerik case Some white-collar criminals write their autobiographies in prison or afterwards. Examples include Bogen (2008), Eriksen (2010), Fosse and Magnusson (2004), and Kerik (2015). Bernard B. Kerik was a former police commissioner in New York, who served three years in prison. His book entitled âFrom Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #84888-054â is an interesting object for content analysis concerning the special sensitivity hypothesis versus the special resilience hypothesis. Content analysis can be defined as any methodology or procedure that works to identify specific characteristics within texts attempting to make valid inferences (Krippendorff, 1980; Patrucco et al., 2017). Content analysis assumes that language reflects both how people understand their surroundings and their cognitive processes. Therefore, content analysis makes it possible to determine how a white-collar offender understands personal experiences as an inmate (McClelland et al., 2010). Chapter 18 in Kerikâs (2015: 249) book seems to be the most interesting and relevant part for our study. It is entitled âFrom the Insideâ and starts with the following paragraph: If you think that a federal prison camp is some kind of resort, think again. There will be no need to bring your golf clubs or swim trunks, just plenty\n\n16\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\nof hand sanitizer and a big wad of cash if you want to avoid catching a flesheating MRS disease and you want to remain in contact with the outside world via telephone or email. The place will invariably be a disgusting shithole. However, chapter 18 is not that interesting after all. Kerik uses the chapter to tell the nation how the prison system can be improved based on his experience. Everyone knows that you cannot generalize from a single observation. Therefore, we needed to search other places in the book for evidence of the special sensitivity hypothesis versus the special resilience hypothesis. Former New York City police commissioner Bernard B. Kerik (born 1955) pleaded guilty to eight financial crime charges including tax evasion and corruption. He was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison and three years of supervised release. He arrived at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland on May 17, 2010. It is hard to find evidence of the special sensitivity hypothesis. Evidence of the special resilience hypothesis, on the other hand, is easy to find. This is a typical example (Kerik, 2015: 33): I often stayed up until midnight or 1:00 a.m. reading and writing in my bunk. Like a lot of guys, I slept with earplugs in, just trying to shut it all out. I walked or ran most days around the grass and gravel track outside, summer and winter. Five times around was a mile (â¦) About a year and a half into my sentence I met a new inmate, Joe Burchfield from Rhode Island. Joe and I used to walk the track together. A former city councilman, heâd been arrested and charged with bribery. Out of all the men I met at Cumberland, he turned out to be one of the best. One possible trace of the special sensitivity hypothesis can be found in the following paragraph (Kerik, 2015: 29): No matter what you have been incarcerated for, or how long your sentence, the one thing that is certain is that you will immediately be cut off from the outside world, including from those you love and anyone or anything that depended on you. No matter what problem or emergency might arise, no matter how devastating a circumstance might be for your family and children, the only thing you can do from prison is watch their suffering from afar and pray for them to get through it on their own. Kerikâs (2015) autobiography is an interesting book about his stunning fall from grace that brought him painfully through the criminal justice system and landed him in prison for several years. Overall, the book is evidence of the special resilience hypothesis rather than the special sensitivity hypothesis for white-collar offenders.\n\nWhite-collar crime research\n\n17\n\nConvenience theory Convenience theory suggests that white-collar criminals have a strong convenience orientation (Gottschalk, 2016a, b, c, d, 2017). The theory of convenience attempts to integrate various theoretical explanations for the occurrence of white-collar crime from sociology, psychology, management, organizational behavior, criminology and other related fields to shed light on different perspectives of convenience. Convenience is a relative concept concerned with the efficiency in time and effort as well as reduction in pain and solution to problems (Engdahl, 2015; Gottschalk, 2017). Convenience orientation refers to a personâs general preference for maneuvers characterized by avoidance of pain and savings in time and effort. A convenience-oriented person is one who seeks to accomplish a task in the shortest time with the least expenditure of human energy. A convenient individual is not necessarily bad nor lazy. On the contrary, the person can be seen as smart and rational in spending time and effort where it matters most for the individual or the organization (SundstrÃ¶m and Radon, 2015). Inmates with a strong convenience orientation favor actions and behaviors with inherent characteristics of saving time and effort. They have a desire to spend as little time as possible on challenging issues and situations that may occur in prison. They have an attitude that the less effort needed the better, and they think that it will be a waste of time to spend a long time on a problem. They prefer to avoid the problem rather than handle it. They want to avoid discomfort and pain. They want to survive prison life in the best possible way. Convenience motivates the choice of action and behavior. An important element is avoiding more problematic, stressful and challenging situations. Convenience can be both an absolute construct and a relative construct. As an absolute construct, it is attractive to commit financial crime as such. As a relative construct, it is more convenient to commit crime than to carry out alternative actions to solve a problem or gain benefits from an opportunity. Convenience is an advantage in favor of a specific action to the detriment of alternative actions. Blickle et al. (2006) found that if the rationally expected utility of an action by a white-collar offender clearly outweighs the expected disadvantages resulting from the action, thereby leaving some net material advantage, then the offender will commit the offense in question. In conclusion, the special sensitivity hypothesis often argued by white-collar defense lawyers and members of the elite finds little support in empirical studies of white-collar inmates versus street crime inmates. Instead, the special resilience hypothesis finds support, where white-collar inmates have the ability to adapt to prison life without much pain. The theory of convenience provides a basis for the special resilience hypothesis, because white-collar offenders tend to have a strong convenience orientation to avoid pain and waste of energy.\n\n2 THEORY OF CONVENIENCE\n\nAs suggested by Gottschalk (2017), white-collar crime can be a convenient option to avoid threats and exploit opportunities. Convenience is a concept that was theoretically mainly associated with efficiency in timesaving. Today, convenience is associated with a number of other characteristics, such as reduced effort and reduced pain. Convenience is associated with terms such as fast, easy and safe. Convenience says something about attractiveness and accessibility (SundstrÃ¶m and Radon, 2015). Convenience is characterized by some comfortable practicality. It is simple and not necessarily bad or illegal. For example, ship-owners can register their boats under flags of convenience, which is sailing under a false flag to reap economic benefits that might otherwise not be achievable. Convenience can be âtricking outâ without traces of obvious crime, lying in the gray zone and exploiting the system for organizational or personal gain and pleasure. Convenience can be causing enrichment in an easy and comfortable manner without losing face or reputation (as long as the offender is not revealed). In academic research, some researchers use convenience samples â that is, readily available respondents â for their empirical studies. The selection is not random and cannot be said to be representative of the population. It is unacceptable to generalize research results based on such samples. Another example is the convenience store â the grocery shop or a gas station â where consumer goods are easily available and accessible but prices are higher and the selection is more limited (Sari et al., 2017). Convenience orientation is the value that individuals and organizations place on actions with inherent characteristics of saving time and effort. Convenience orientation is a value-like construct that influences behavior and decision-making. Mai and Olsen (2016) measured convenience orientation in terms of a desire to spend as little time as possible on the task and the attitude that the less effort needed the better and that it is a waste of time to spend a long time on the task. Convenience\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n19\n\norientation towards illegal actions increases as negative attitudes towards legal actions increase. The basic elements of convenience orientation are the executive attitudes to the saving of time, effort and discomfort in the planning, action and achievement of goals. Generally, convenience orientation is the degree to which an executive is inclined to save time and effort to reach goals. Convenience orientation refers to a personâs general preference for convenient maneuvers. A convenience-oriented person is one who seeks to accomplish a task in the shortest possible time with the least expenditure of human energy (Berry et al., 2002). The actual convenience is not necessarily important in convenience theory. Rather, the perceived, expected and assumed convenience influences choice of action. Berry et al. (2002) make this distinction explicit by conceptualizing convenience as individualsâ time and effort perceptions related to an action. Whitecollar criminals probably vary in their perceived convenience of their actions. Low expected convenience could be one of the reasons why not more members of the elite commit white-collar offenses.\n\nTheory development Theory is a necessary part of research in organization sciences (Ashkanasy, 2016), and convenience theory emphasizes the organizational opportunity to commit and conceal white-collar crime. Theory is a systematic, interrelated set of concepts that explain a body of data. In convenience theory, three main concepts explain the occurrence of white-collar crime: financial motive, organizational opportunity and personal willingness. These concepts are all interrelated as organizational opportunity interacts with financial motive and personal willingness. Interactions between motive, opportunity and willingness determine the extent of convenience perceived by a potential white-collar crime offender. Theory is a way of imposing conceptual order on the empirical complexity of the phenomenal world. Convenience theory offers a conceptual order on financial crime by members in the elite in society who certainly do not need to commit crime for their survival. Theory offers a statement of relations between concepts within a set of boundary assumptions and constraints. Convenience theory makes assumptions about human behavior, such as individualsâ motives and desires as well as individualsâ behaviors in organizational contexts. A theory reflects the magnitude of a disciplineâs knowledge base. Convenience theory reflects and builds on a knowledge base from criminology, psychology, management, strategy and many other disciplines. Theory does more than abstract and organize knowledge. It also signals the values upon which that knowledge is built (Suddaby, 2014). In white-collar crime research, a number of values are at stake. For example, not all are equal before the law. Some are simply too powerful to jail (Pontell et al., 2014). Ever since Sutherland (1939) coined the term white-collar crime, researchers in the field have emphasized the value of preventing and detecting elite crime. Therefore, an important value signaled by convenience theory is that white-collar crime is just as\n\n20\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nbad as â and maybe even much worse than â traditional street crime including rape, murder and theft, since offendersâ motive is found in their choice of convenience with no regard to harm and victims. This signal from white-collar crime research is still controversial today. It seems that many consider white-collar criminals as individuals who were unlucky, who made a mistake that was not intentional, who made a short cut in a stressed job situation and who should not be considered crooks. According to Leap (2007), white-collar crime imposes a degree of physical and emotional trauma on its victims that far exceeds the trauma inflicted by street criminals. Developing theory is neither easy nor ever completed. Theory development is defined by Weick (1989) as disciplined imagination, where theory is an ordered set of assertions about a generic behavior or structure assumed to hold throughout a significantly broad range of specific instances. The generic behavior in whitecollar crime can be found in the abuse of power, influence and trust by offenders, and the generic structure is visible in the organizational context among convicted offenders. There are a number of interactions between dimensions in the theory of crime convenience. For example, opportunity enhances temptation (Steffensmeier and Allan, 1996: 478): âAn illegitimate enterprise, being able tends to make one more willing, just as being willing increases the prospects for being ableâ. Thus, the organizational dimension of opportunity influences the desire for financial gain in the economic dimension. Opportunity also influences the behavioral willingness, while the behavioral willingness in turn influences abilities in terms of organizational opportunities.\n\nFinancial motive Threat of bankruptcy or threat of other kinds of financial loss is a frequent economical motive for white-collar crime. According to Piquero (2012), the fear of falling is strong among members of the elite. Kouchaki and Desai (2015: 362) found that the threat of falling may lead to unethical behavior: âPerceived threat engenders self-protective defenses that cause people to focus narrowly on their own needs, which interfere with adherence to moral principles and encourage unethical actsâ. They also suggest (Kouchaki and Desai, 2015) that people experiencing anxiety, nervousness and worry are likely to behave selfishly and engage in self-interested unethical acts in an effort to restore the threatened self. Individuals experiencing threats tend to focus inward and acquire resources as a means of compensating for threats. In threatening situations, the brain tends to shift into a state that facilitates mobilization of defense mechanisms. Threats are typically characterized by the salience of risk of loss. Threats tend to bring about socially undesirable actions geared towards self-protection. To cope with threat, people rely on a variety of potential mechanisms to shield themselves from negative experiences and unpleasant feelings and, ultimately, to protect their self-esteem.\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n21\n\nThreats can create moral panic. Moral panic is used to characterize reactions that do not accurately reflect the actual danger of a threat. During a moral panic, sensitization processes generate an escalation in the individual disturbance (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). Chattopadhyay et al. (2001) studied organizational actions in response to threats. They found that threats are associated with urgency, difficulty and high stakes. Threats involve a negative situation in which loss is likely and over which one has relatively little control. A possibility implies a positive situation in which gain is likely and over which one has a fair amount of control, which is at the same time characterized by urgency, difficulty, and high stakes (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001). When an organization develops and maintains a strong systematic socialization program, employees identify with not only the organization but also its goals. When personal promotion or dismissal, as well as bonuses and benefits, are connected to achievement of goals, then employees identify even more strongly with organizational goals. When the socialization process is coupled with strong accountability systems, employees are regulated to achieve organizational goals. The pursuit of goals does not at all imply the absence of crime. The bottom-line focus within an organizational context might increase the frequency of financial crime on behalf of the organization for profit or enhancement. A strong emphasis on goal attainment might indeed lead organizational members to engage in illegal acts (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). Kang and Thosuwanchot (2017: 501) tell the following story: Philip R. Bennett joined Refco Inc. in 1981, becoming the chief financial officer (CFO) in 1983 and heading it as the chief executive officer (CEO) since 1998 following the retirement of Thomas Dittmer, the stepson of the companyâs founder. Bennett was asked to leave the company when federal prosecutors accused him of a âmassive securities fraud, charging him with a scheme to hide a debt of as much as $545 million that he allegedly tried to keep secret from investorsâ. In 2008, Bennett pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Having been in Refco Inc. for more than 24 years and coupled with the helming of two high-ranking positions â CFO and ultimately CEO and chairman â Bennettâs identification with the goals of Refco Inc. can be considered to be high. In other words, having spent sufficient time in a position of power in Refco Inc. with the ability to influence the companyâs direction, Bennett was highly socialized into the goals of the company. One of Refco Incâs key goals was to go public to raise funds. The company engaged reputable institutions (i.e. Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America Corp.) to underwrite its IPO in 2005. However, Bennett committed illegal acts to make Refco Inc. more attractive as an investment option in the public listing.\n\n22\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nOrganizational opportunity Persons at the pinnacle of a corporate hierarchy (or just about any hierarchy, for that matter) who have considerable authority are not often challenged, insist upon results and are accustomed to getting their way. Therefore, various forms of dishonest and illegal behavior that elite members engage in seem to be convenient for the offenders. They believe they can ignore various reservations they would have if they were lower down in the power structure and if they were expected to demonstrate leadership and achieve ethical results. Greed, self-importance, immunity from criticism, fondness for getting oneâs way and fear of falling all contribute to the convenience of white-collar crime in the organizational setting. An offender is in a position to point to the importance of oneâs place in the organizational hierarchy, oneâs ability to cover oneâs tracks, blame others or insist on deniability, and the pressure to achieve results. White-collar criminals tend to engage in various rhetorical strategies to make it sound to their subordinates as though they have done nothing wrong. Organizational dynamics is an interesting perspective on white-collar crime. Organizational dynamics can cause a downward spiral, leading to misconduct and crime. In the downward spiral, the tendency to commit white-collar crime increases. It becomes more convenient to commit crime than pursue alternative actions when crises or opportunities emerge. Convenience theory suggests that white-collar crime can be an attractive option for executives and others in the elite. In this section, negative organizational dynamics is explained by institutional theory, social disorganization theory, slippery slope theory, neutralization theory and differential association theory. As argued by Ashkanasy et al. (2017), organizations are intrinsically human entities. Processes that drive human thought and behavior also drive organizations. If deviant behavior is preferred by some and accepted by others, then deviance may drive an organization. When a leader implicitly or explicitly defines misconduct and crime as acceptable, followers will tend to do the same. In the organizational setting, there is no organizational or corporate crime that is not driven by human thought and behavior. The opportunity perspective is thus more than just an organization lacking control over its members. There are dynamics among members, where some prefer convenient solutions to problems and challenges even when the solutions imply breaking the law. The organization is a community of practice where individuals merge into groups and departments to complete tasks and reach goals in ways that establish themselves over time through dynamic interactions among organizational members. In their article on organizational dynamics as a way to understand the causes and effects of top management fraud, Zahra et al. (2007: 128) emphasize organizationlevel pressures: âWithout stockholder monitoring, some executives may act opportunistically and enrich themselves while foregoing stockholder-desired, longterm value creating activities for their firmsâ.\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n23\n\nOrganizational dynamics Organizational dynamics may over time create a culture for misconduct and crime (Zahra et al., 2007: 129): Over time, some organizations can develop deviant cultures in which wrongdoing is rationalized and institutionalized. These organizations are often led by leaders who tolerate unethical behavior and conceal corrupt practices. These leaders might also encourage gamesmanship and political maneuvering as a means of getting ahead. As argued by Uhl-Bien and Carsten (2007: 189), it is difficult to be ethical when the boss is not: The eye-opening results of the Milgram studies of authority in the early 1960s show the pervasiveness of this dynamic. These studies, which have received widespread attention from both social scientists and the general public, demonstrate that individuals are willing to inflict negative, even harmful, treatment on others simply at the request of an authority figure. Milgram found that when individuals see another as an authority figure (in position of power) and / or having expertise the individual does not have, they will blindly obey commands â even those that lead to blatant negative consequences. In his discussion of the dynamics of white-collar crime, Leap (2007: 42) also emphasizes organizational culture: Corrupt organizational cultures have been cited as a root cause for major corporate scandals. Among the most significant causes of this corruption are executives and managers who fail to serve as ethical role models and set a bad example for others. When the CEO and other top executives engage in fraud or the misappropriation of assets, some lower-level managers and employees will take notice and follow suit. Institutional collapse is one kind of organizational dynamic that makes it possible for white-collar crime to occur more frequently. According to institutional theory, the organizational context, behaviors and processes may support white-collar crime. Organizational behaviors reflect a culture that evolves over time and becomes legitimized within an organization (Itzkovich and Heilbrunn, 2016). Corruption and other kinds of financial crime become entrenched by the legitimizing process (Pillay and Kluvers, 2014; Rostami et al., 2015). While the theory of institutional collapse is concerned with breakdown caused in interaction with external forces (Shadnam and Lawrence, 2011), the theory of social disorganization is concerned with collapse caused only by internal forces.\n\n24\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nSocial disorganization leads to the breakdown of conventional social norms. The gradual erosion of conventional relationships weakens the organization and makes it unable to satisfy the needs of its members. The organization gradually loses the ability to control the behavior of its members. There is no functional authority over potential white-collar criminals in the organization (Wood and Alleyne, 2010). As a consequence of social disorganization, organizational opportunity to commit white-collar crime increases (Hoffmann, 2002; Swart and Kinnie, 2003). Slippery slope theory is a third theoretical perspective on organizational dynamics as enabler of white-collar crime. Slippery slope means that a person âslidesâ over time from legal to illegal activities. Arjoon (2008: 78) explains slippery slope in the following way: As commonsense experience tells us, it is the small infractions that can lead to the larger ones. An organization that overlooks the small infractions of its employees creates a culture of acceptance that may lead to its own demise. This phenomenon is captured by the metaphor of the slippery slope. Many unethical acts occur without the conscience awareness of the person who engaged in the misconduct. Specifically, unethical behavior is most likely to follow the path of a slippery slope, defined as a gradual decline in which no one event makes one aware that he or she is acting unethically. The majority of unethical behaviors are unintentional and ordinary, thus affecting everyone and providing support for unethical behavior when people unconsciously lower the bar over time through small changes in their ethical behavior. Welsh et al. (2014) argue that many recent scandals can be described as resulting from a slippery slope in which a series of small infractions gradually increase over time. Committing small indiscretions over time may gradually lead people to commit larger unethical acts they would otherwise have judged to be impermissible. The slippery slope theory is in contrast to individual theories such as the standard economic model of rational choice theory as described in the economic dimension. Moral behavior is shaped by psychological and organizational processes, where individuals are motivated to view themselves in a positive manner that corresponds with their moral values. Individuals tend to rationalize minor unethical acts so that they may derive some benefit without being forced to negatively update their self-concept. For example, a minor transgression such as taking a pen home from the office may seem permissible, whereas taking money out of the company cash drawer may more clearly be thought of as stealing (Welsh et al., 2014). A fourth theoretical perspective on organizational dynamics as enabler of white-collar crime is neutralization theory (Sykes and Matza, 1957). For example, in religious organizations there is evidence that misconduct and crime can be rationalized by higher loyalties. When the Catholic Church in Norway was caught\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n25\n\nwith a long list of individuals who were not members of the church, they refused to pay back subsidies to the government. TjÃ¸rholm (2016: 12), a professor of religion at a university in Norway, argued that in some situations the Catholic Church seems to decouple itself from the common moral and social obligations: The indictment against Oslo Catholic diocese was recently announced. The chief financial officer is accused of serious fraud, with a maximum possible sentence of six years. For the Oslo Catholic diocese, the allegation means a fine of one million Norwegian kroner. Bishop Bernt Eidsvig avoided indictment because there is insufficient evidence of guilt. Leadership of the Oslo Catholic diocese undoubtedly adopted reprehensible methods when it registered members as the basis for attracting state subsidies. A fifth and final perspective is dynamics created by differential association. The essence of differential association is that criminal behavior is learned, and the main part of this learning comes from within important personal groups. Exposure to the attitudes of members of the organization that either favor or reject legal codes influences the attitudes of the individual. The individual will go on to commit crime if they are more exposed to attitudes that favor law violation than to attitudes that favor abiding by the law (Hoffmann, 2002; Wood and Alleyne, 2010). Negative organizational dynamics can be explained by institutional theory, social disorganization theory, slippery slope theory, neutralization theory, differential association theory and other theories. Institutional collapse causes a negative spiral, social disorganization causes loss of overview, slippery slope causes ignorance, neutralization causes rationalization, while differential association causes crime identity. Dynamics are created by feedback loops that reinforce deviant behaviors. Based on this section, there are several avenues for future research. An attractive avenue would be to conduct a longitudinal study of a business or public organization in terms of organizational deterioration caused by negative organizational dynamics. Such a case study could illustrate impacts on white-collar crime occurrence from various theoretical perspectives. Another avenue for future research could be to build a model of influencing factors on white-collar crime magnitude in causal relationships and feedback loops that represent negative organizational dynamics. A third avenue could be a cross-sectional analysis of a sample of companies where CEOs have been convicted of white-collar crime. This section has illustrated that organizational dynamics can be an interesting perspective on white-collar crime. White-collar crime was described in terms of convenience theory, where crime is a convenient option when there is a financial motive, an organizational opportunity and behavioral willingness. Negative organizational dynamics can strengthen the financial motive and increase behavioral willingness, as well as adding organizational opportunity. For example, the willingness in the behavioral dimension of convenience theory increases as individuals notice that misconduct and crime are no longer considered an abuse of position and power.\n\n26\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nManagement control âThatâs how they taught us to do itâ. This is a phrase illustrating learned deviance and inadequate deterrence. Leasure and Zhang (2017) studied reports of Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley engagement in widespread fraudulent sales practices in the retail banking industry. They found that the underlying deviance had been taught by senior management and that new employees were taught these fraudulent practices. Furthermore, they found that ethics and compliance practices and policies were largely ineffective in curtailing such conduct. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million for fraudulently opening accounts. Wells Fargo opened as many as two million fake accounts in an effort to meet wildly unrealistic sales goals. Within the opportunity perspective on white-collar crime, we find routine activity theory that focuses on situations of crime. The premise of routine activity theory is that crime is relatively unaffected by social causes such as poverty, inequality and unemployment. The theory stipulates three necessary conditions for crime: a likely offender, a suitable target and the absence of a capable guardian, coming together in time and space (Felson and Boba, 2017). The existence or absence of a likely guardian represents an inhibitor or facilitator for crime. The premise of routine activity theory is that crime is to a minor extent affected by social causes such as poverty, inequality and unemployment. Motivated offenders are individuals who are not only capable of committing criminal activity but willing to do so. Suitable targets can be some things that are seen by offenders as particularly attractive. When introducing routine activity theory, Cohen and Felson (1979) concentrated upon the circumstances in which offenders carry out predatory criminal acts. Most criminal acts require convergence in space and time of (1) likely offenders, (2) suitable targets, and (3) the absence of capable guardians against crime. The lack of any of these elements is sufficient to prevent the successful completion of a crime. Though guardianship is implicit in everyday life, it is usually invisible in the absence of violations and is therefore easy to overlook. Guardians are not only protective tools, weapons and skills but also mental models in the minds of potential offenders that stimulate self-control to avoid criminal acts. When compared to convenience theory, routine activity theoryâs three conditions do not cover all three dimensions. The likely offenders can be found in the behavioral dimension, while both suitable targets and the absence of capable guardians can be found in the organizational dimension. While routine activity theory defines conditions for crime to occur, convenience theory defines situations where crime occurs. White-collar crime only occurs when there is a financial motive in the economical dimension. Those who are similar to the typical white-collar offender may be less likely to be concerned with white-collar offending than those who are not similar to the typical offender. Dearden (2017) found that it was reasonable to assume that for individuals who see themselves as in some way similar to white-collar criminals, their in-group status may mitigate their perceptions of white-collar crime. Similarity makes people accept each other.\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n27\n\nWhen white-collar offenders commit occupational crime they may be attracted by the strong sense of superiority coming from having beaten the system without detection. They may blame the lack of controls for their own wrongdoings. They feel no attachment to the organization and no obligation to the employer. Rather, they enjoy the lack of socialization and lack of accountability that enables them to explore and exploit the organization for personal gain. Their deviance passes unnoticed by others, and their behavior is accepted by others (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017).\n\nEntrepreneurs in white-collar crime Entrepreneurs are often seen as important economic agents, driving forward employment, opportunities and economic development. Entrepreneurship is associated with innovation, adaptation, change and dynamism, hard work, willpower, and overcoming challenges and struggles. According to Welter et al. (2017), entrepreneurship is a broadly available social technology for creating organizations that may pursue a myriad of goals. They argue that entrepreneurship research can and should be a window into and a tool for shaping social and economic equity. In this line of reasoning, financial crime by white-collar criminals is an alternative tool for pursuing a large spectrum of social and economic goals. A typical example is corruption, where entrepreneurs on behalf of the organization bribe vendors, public officials and others to achieve goals. Another example is embezzlement, where entrepreneurs abuse their positions in organizations to enrich themselves. Tonoyan et al. (2010) explored the determinants of corruption in transition economies and looked at the EastâWest gap in corruption in Europe. They found that viewing illegal business activities as a widespread business practice provides the rationale for entrepreneurs to justify their own corrupt activities. Moreover, closed social networks with family, friends and national bureaucrats reduce the opportunism of the contracting party of the corrupt deal, thus providing a breeding ground for corruption. Eddleston and Kidwell (2012) studied deviant behavior in family firms that violates organizational norms. Examples are theft, embezzlement and corruption. Given that only 30 percent of family firms make it to the second generation, understanding how parents encourage children to act in deviant ways in the firm seems important. Rather than focusing on the childâs personality as the cause of deviance, the study shows the importance of examining family relationships. Entrepreneurs in white-collar crime demonstrate deviant behavior. Similar to moral entrepreneurs as discussed by Ryan (1994), white-collar crime requires both âtechniciansâ, who develop techniques of business-level enforcement of rules, and âinterpretersâ, who legitimate the work of technicians by providing expansive readings of applicable legal limitations. Entrepreneurs in white-collar crime are different from criminal entrepreneurs when criminal entrepreneurs are defined as entrepreneurs who are mainly on the\n\n28\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nwrong side of the law in their business endeavors. Entrepreneurs in white-collar crime demonstrate deviant behavior to benefit the organization, often labeled corporate crime, or to benefit the individual, often labeled occupational crime (Kang and Thosuwanchot, 2017). McElwee and Smith (2015) argue that illegal and criminal entrepreneurship is particularly context specific when it operates in the shadow economy. The shadow economy comprises those economic activities and the income derived from them that circumvent or otherwise avoid government regulation, taxation or observation (Schneider and Williams, 2013). In the following, four case studies of convicted offenders illustrate entrepreneurs in white-collar crime based on convenience theory. Table 2.1 lists the four cases. The two first cases are presented extensively since there are internal investigations reports publicly available. Are Blomhoff was educated as a priest and became chief executive officer (CEO) at the religiously based social foundation Betanien in Bergen, Norway. The foundation operates several nursing homes, kindergartens and health institutions associated with the Methodist Church. When he was 52 years old, CEO Blomhoff was in charge of developing a nursing home in Spain for older Norwegians. He got money transferred from Spain to Norway for the project. He had exclusive responsibility for all money transfers to Spain. He embezzled some of the transferred TABLE 2.1 White-collar criminals convicted of convenient embezzlement in Norway\n\nWhite-collar criminal\n\nWhite-collar crime\n\nEconomical dimension (motive)\n\nOrganizational dimension (opportunity)\n\nExclusive responsibility for money transfers between mother company and subsidiary Exclusive Lars Brorson Embezzlement Greed for responsibility for CFO Hadeland Broadband expensive money transfers 40 years old 4.5 years prison property and between Norway consumer and Spain goods Divorced and Exclusive Marius Schatvet Embezzlement wanted to keep responsibility for CFO Aschehoug money transfers house and 50 years old Publishing in chain of cabin 3 years prison bookstores Exclusive Kjell Staddeland Embezzlement Greed for responsibility for CEO Ugland Shipping living in the money transfers 50 years old 3.5 years prison best house in joint venture with parking space for 5 cars Are Blomhoff CEO Priest 52 years old\n\nGreed for Embezzlement Betanien Foundation private 3 years prison apartment and expensive parties\n\nBehavioral dimension (deviance) Different behavior in Spain and Norway\n\nBlamed lack of control mechanisms for his fraud Dissatisfied with his salary level (owner made much more than him) Dissatisfied with his salary level (owner made much more than him)\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n29\n\nmoney to buy himself an apartment in Spain and to arrange expensive parties with prostitutes in Spain. Lars Brorson was chief financial officer (CFO) at Hadeland Broadband, a subsidiary of Hadeland Energy. He came from a position at Hadeland Energy and had for a long time been in charge of financial transactions between Hadeland Energy and Hadeland Broadband. According to investigators from PwC (2014), Brorson sent a total of 18 million Norwegian kroner (about US$3 million) to his own accounts from Hadeland Broadbandâs overdraft account. Half of the amount was transferred in 2012, divided into 42 payments. Between 2011 and 2014, 66 such transactions were recorded. Marius Schatvet was chief financial officer at the publishing house Aschehoug. When he was working alone on the entrepreneurial task of refinancing the publishing houseâs involvement in a chain of bookstores, he was able to transfer some of the money to his own account without anybody noticing. He did this for many years. Unfortunately for him, he finally typed in his own bank account number with a wrong digit, thereby attracting attention. An employee in the accounting department noticed the transaction and blew the whistle on CFO Schatvet. Schatvet was sentenced to three years in prison (Silvola et al., 2014). Kjell Rune Staddeland was chief executive officer at Ugland Shipping. The Ugland family had owned the company for generations and was rich. Staddeland made the family even richer, while at the same time receiving a modest CEO compensation. When he was handling an entrepreneurial joint venture agreement for the company on his own, he found a way to embezzle. After a while, however, he regretted his crime and told the owner, who reported Staddeland to the police (Berglihn and Fosse, 2013). Agency theory suggests that problems occur between principal and agent when there are (i) conflicting preferences, (ii) different knowledge and information, and (iii) different attitudes to risk (Bosse and Phillips, 2016). In their entrepreneurial activities, the sample of four convicted executives abused their powers. Mr. Blomhoff at Betanien was charged with the entrepreneurial task of establishing a nursing home in Spain. Mr. Brorson at Hadeland was charged with the entrepreneurial task of running broadband development while interacting with the energy company. Mr. Schatvet at Aschehoug was to reorganize the publishing houseâs involvement in a chain of bookstores, while Mr. Staddeland at Ugland was to reshape a joint venture. In all four cases they were alone in their endeavors. In all four cases the executives enriched themselves by committing white-collar crime and concealing their illegal transactions among legal transactions. Obviously, the first problem in the agency relationship occurred because no principal appreciates embezzlement by agents. The second problem in principalâ agent theory is the dominating one in the cases, where the principal has little or no means to control what the agent is doing. The third and final problem in agency theory seems less relevant, as the action of embezzlement does not really involve different principal and agent attitudes to risk.\n\n30\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nWhite-collar crime is a convenient alternative for privileged individuals who want to enrich themselves. Their occupational positions enable them to commit offenses and conceal them among legal activities. This is especially the case when the offender has sole responsibility for a task involving substantial amounts of money, as illustrated by the four accounts above. One simple learning point from this section is that nobody â not even chair persons, chief executives or presidents â should ever have sole responsibility for tasks involving money on behalf of the organization.\n\nBehavioral willingness Deviant behavior can be learned from others. In executive successions, cultural transmission tends to occur â for example, from a retiring chief executive officer (CEO) to an emerging CEO. Cultural transmission can explain why individuals who were reluctant to engage in deviant behavior may engage in misconduct and crime. Cultural transmission models may explain the passing on of misconduct behavior with regard to white-collar crime. Generally, such models explain transfer of cultural norms, values and belief systems that are transmitted between individuals or groups within and across generations. Transmission of criminal behavior across generations of executives occurs via a learning process with predecessors as well as in delinquent associations and peers. The principles of cultural transmission and differential association can be applied to corporate offending. The concept of deviance is here an attribute of individuals, where we focus on negative forms of deviance in relation to white-collar crime within organizational contexts. Deviance is non-conformance to a norm that refers to any type of behavior that fails to meet normative standards and may evoke a collective response of a negative type. Negative deviance is intentional behavior that departs from the norms of a referent group in bad ways (Mertens et al., 2016). Deviance is here both behavior and outcome, as behavior leads to crime. It is a departure from organizational norms in legal organizations, where organizational norms are informal or formal rules that regulate bandwidths and boundaries for behavior (Mertens et al., 2016). Craig and Piquero (2017) studied two personality traits that sometimes predict offending intentions. Low self-control and desire-for-control are two personality traits that can have multiple effects on white-collar offending. Findings suggest that while low self-control was predictive of intentions to offend, the impact of desire-for-control varied based on the respondentâs level of self-control. In contrast to prior studies, desire-for-control reduced offending intentions, but only among those with high self-control. Self-control reflects an individualâs capacity and motivation to override desires and urges in order to act in accordance with oneâs norms and goals, such as maintaining positive relationships with others. Soltes (2016: 54) suggests that âpeople with lower self-control have greater difficulty resisting temptation and restraining reckless behavior, and eventually some of this rash and opportunistic behavior is likely to end up as criminal conductâ.\n\nTheory of convenience\n\n31\n\nLiang et al. (2016) argue that effective human functioning requires the capacity to transcend primal desires and habitual behaviors in order to behave in a socially appropriate manner. When self-control fails, individuals disregard the long-term implications of their behaviors and succumb to their desires, such as cheating and bribing. Liang et al. (2016: 1388) suggest that self-control is determined by two forces: The first is a primitive impulsive system wherein desire arises and drives behaviors, and the second is a higher-order reflective system wherein the desires and action tendencies that arise in the first primitive impulsive system are monitored and restrained. White-collar offenders rationalize their own misconduct â misconduct through which they sought fast, desirable results by violating the rules but expected to get away with it. Behavioral willingness can be high when the subjective detection risk is low. Detection risk is a combination of likelihood of detection and consequences after detection. Subjective detection risk varies among individuals. Subjective detection risk is influenced by a number of factors. Attitudes towards police performance or effectiveness comprise one such factor. When whitecollar offenders believe that the police are unable to solve crime, then the risk of criminal behavior is low. The police do not operate in a vacuum. They rely on community members to report crime, serve as witnesses in court and act as capable guardians over person and property. Police effectiveness is also based on the level of support that the community provides. Policing practice reveals that businesses that have suffered from financial crime have lower trust, confidence and satisfaction with law enforcement (Dowler and Sparks, 2008; Telep and Weisburd, 2012). Hence, the legitimacy of the police is often rooted in the level of corporate support they receive. For this reason, confidence in the police may actually impact levels of white-collar crime within private and public organizations. On the other hand, collective efficacy in law enforcement may increase subjective detection risk. Collective efficacy holds that organizational members and stakeholders work collectively towards a common objective, such as crime control and order maintenance. The fundamental component of collective efficacy is the notion of social trust among all actors towards a common goal (Sampson et al., 1997). All members of the relevant communities work together to control crime through mutual trust. However, when trust or confidence in the police is either lacking or non-existent, the possibility of reducing actual levels of crime will be diminished. Some white-collar criminals suffer from personality disorders such as psychopathy. Psychopathy can be characterized by fearlessness, antisocial behavior combined with high social attention seeking, immunity to stress, egoism and self-centered impulsivity (Blickle and SchÃ¼tte, 2017).\n\n32\n\nTheory of convenience\n\nThe behavioral willingness to commit white-collar crime can be reversed when fraud is detected. Especially in cases of personality disorder, a possible outcome is detection suicide. Brody and Perri (2016: 786) tell the following story: To outsiders, Darrin Campbell was the picture of an unassuming prosperous executive. However, records show that Campbell was at the center of a securities fraud scandal that accompanied the collapse of Tampa-based Anchor Glass Container Corporation, then the third-largest manufacturer of glass containers in the USA. Shareholders accused him and other executives of failing to disclose financial weaknesses before a public stock offering, leading to lawsuits and a multimillion-dollar settlement. As part of the settlement, Campbell did not have to admit wrongdoing. Yet, after this incident, there were speculations that perhaps Campbell and his family were having financial problems. Campbell can be seen purch"
