The hearing was convened, pursuant to notice, at 9:06 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. William V. Roth, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding. Also present: Senators Chafee, Grassley, Hatch, Murkowski, Nickles, Gramm, Lott, Mack, Moynihan, Baucus, Breaux, Conrad, Moseley-Braun, Bryan, and Kerrey. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM V. ROTH, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE The Chairman. The committee will please be in order. Let me start out by pointing out that I have discussed with Senator Moynihan, the Ranking Member, that opening statements will be limited to 7 minutes for himself and for me, and we would ask each of the other members to limit theirs to 3 minutes. When it comes to the questioning of witnesses, Senator Moynihan and myself will enjoy equal time, and all other members will be asked to limit each round, if there is more than one round, to 5 minutes. This morning we continue our oversight hearings concerning the practices and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service. Last fall was a milestone in establishing the rights and expectations of the American taxpayer in dealing with the IRS. Our hearings in September disclosed abuses against taxpayers and employees alike and prompted the agency to initiate investigations and new policies that are already beginning to change the way IRS does business. I am pleased with Commissioner Charles Rossotti's leadership and the commitment he has made to strike at the heart of the problems we have uncovered, the use of goals and statistics, the reckless disregard of taxpayer rights, harassment, retaliation against employees, and inefficiencies in management and service. I support Commissioner Rossotti and his efforts. We realize that one of the most important ways we can continue to support his efforts at reform is through oversight. I am pleased that our investigation and related efforts have already prompted action from the IRS to take the steps they announced yesterday to improve the Criminal Investigation Division. History is filled with examples where one or two Congressional hearings led to promised reform, but when the lights were turned off and Congressional interest waned, the reform efforts too often died and the agency returned to business as usual. The taxpayer and the employees of the IRS deserve our vigilance. The IRS is full of talented, hardworking employees. They suffer under this current system and they need to see how serious we are. Many thought our September hearing were a one-time event, and they now know differently. I applaud their courage and determination to speak with us, to work with us, and to testify before this committee. Without them, there would be nothing here but an empty room. Certainly, Congress' efforts must go beyond oversight. We have heard compelling testimony about the complexity of the Tax Code. I will say now that in the near future we will turn our attention to that. Seventeen thousand pages of rules and regulations, 5.5 million words, yield a Tax Code that has become a mine field for most Americans, and even too complex to be efficiently and consistently administered by the Internal Revenue Service. It needs to be simplified. This, too, is our responsibility. Over the next 4 days, however, we will be taking another step in our important and ongoing oversight efforts. We will hear of disparate treatment between high-level executives and other employees within the service, how they are treated differently even when they have committed the same offense. Such inequities for the benefit of executive-level employees send the wrong message to the average worker and destroy morale throughout the agency. We will focus on a number of serious issues which weigh heavily on the integrity of the IRS. We will hear how investigative techniques to deal with violent and dangerous criminals are used against taxpayers who are neither violent nor dangerous. We will hear from taxpayers who have experienced armed raids of their homes and businesses, raids that were conducted on the flimsiest of evidence which later proved to be unwarranted and the taxpayer exonerated of any wrongdoing. We will examine the sensitive issue of racism and discrimination, an issue that has come up from the moment we first started our oversight. We will hear that the IRS internal oversight is so bad that the agency is unable to track what its employees are doing, and we will also examine significant compliance problems. Without a doubt, we have a full agenda over the next 4 days. Our goal is to put a spotlight on those areas of the IRS which demonstrate a need for immediate change, to continue our work with Commissioner Rossotti and the employees of the Internal Revenue Service who have waited for far too long for real reform. With these hearings we continue to send a message to the agency and to the taxpayer that we are serious about changing the IRS, it is not beyond the control of Congress, it is subject to the will of the people it is here to serve. At this time I would call on Senator Baucus. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MAX BAUCUS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Baucus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I heard your request that members keep their remarks to, I think it was, 3 minutes. I might say that I will not be here very much during the day. The ICET conference is going on and I will not be able to ask very many questions of the panelists. So, with your indulgence, I have a few more than three minutes in my opening statement. The Chairman. Please proceed. Senator Baucus. Mr. Chairman, one of the earliest controversies facing the newly independent United States of America involved the taxing power of the Federal Government. After all, unjust taxes were the chief causes of the war for independence. But our founding fathers had fresh memories of raising an army and running and embattled government mostly on borrowed funds. They knew they would need revenue to provide for the common good. So, in an act passed by the very first Congress, we gave the central government the power to collect tariffs and taxes, so long as they were fair and uniform. During the past couple of months in every household across the country, Americans went through an annual rite. They sat down at the kitchen table, pulled all of their financial records together, and figured out what they owed the government. Nobody likes doing their taxes and they probably dislike paying them even more. Yet the vast majority do it, and they do it honestly. Americans realize they have a bargain with their country which is their duty to uphold: they pay their taxes so that their money, when pooled together with the money contributed by all their friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens, is used wisely for the common good. Americans expect their money to defend their families from hostile nations, to educate their children, to provide for a clean and healthful environment, to improve their highways, to help keep them healthy, to help provide for them in their old age and to give a helping hand to those going through hard times. In short, Americans expect their money to be used to pay for all of the things that help make this Nation great. In return, though, the American people want their government to do two things. First, the American people want their government to treat them with respect and dignity as the revenue is collected. They expect to have their privacy respected and to be treated fairly. Second, Americans expect that everyone else who enjoys the benefits that taxes pay for will shoulder their share of the burden as well, that their neighbor down the street is not hiding part of his income and thus avoiding paying his fair share of the tax, that everyone is filing returns and the amounts claimed on those returns are accurate and true. Mr. Chairman, I truly believe the American people have the right to have both of these expectations met. I believe we here in the Senate shoulder a great deal of the responsibility for making sure of it. We were placed on this committee because, presumably, we understand the need for revenue to keep this country moving. We also understand the grave responsibility that goes along with the power to tax. After all, John Marshall said, ``The power to tax involves the power to destroy.'' It is our duty as members of this committee to make sure this country does not use its power in that fashion. How do we do that? We must stay above partisan politics and petty squabbles. We must make sure our laws reflect good public policy and that the Tax Code is used for the benefit of the American people. That is why I have watched the process we have gone through in anticipation of these hearings with a measure of personal regret and disappointment. I do not believe these hearings are balanced. I believe they fail to rise above party politics. I do not believe they will ultimately benefit the American people. Mr. Chairman, if you look at ``Webster's New World Dictionary,'' under the word oversight you will find it described as ``vigilant supervision.'' As members of the Senate Finance Committee, we must be vigilant that individual taxpayers are being treated right by the Internal Revenue Service. However, it is every bit as important that we are vigilant to make sure that taxpayers are treated fairly. Let me make it clear, I do not object to investigating the IRS to make sure it is operating correctly and treating taxpayers right. We must, and we should, do so. That is part of our responsibility. But I also believe we have a responsibility to look at the whole picture, not just place a spotlight on the issues that give political advantage to one party or another. How can we spend 4 days talking about a handful of cases that the IRS might or might not have mishandled yet not spend a single minute talking about how some Americans are flouting the tax laws? Our entire system of collecting revenue would unravel if taxpayers stopped paying their fair share because they believed everyone else is cheating. Estimates of tax avoidance are soaring, with many believing the numbers could reach $100 billion per year. How can we ignore this issue or ignore the dangers that IRS employees face every day as they try to do the job we have hired them to do? Mr. Chairman, we have a new Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Charles Rossotti. He is an honorable man and a good public servant. We have given him a mighty challenge, to reform an agency that has resisted reform in the past. He has asked us for a few simple tools to make the IRS work better: changes in personnel rules so he can put a good working team in place; the ability to reorganize the agency so he can eliminate layers of duplication. Most of these provisions are included in the IRS restructuring bill that the House passed 6 months ago by a vote of 426 to 4. That bill still awaits action by the full Senate. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to spend our time on these hearings I wish that they could be balanced. But since that apparently is not possible, I urge you to move quickly to pass a good IRS restructuring bill through this Senate. Passing a solid restructuring bill will do more to get the IRS on track than 100 of these hearings where we sit, posture, pontificate, and play politics. It is our responsibility as members of this committee, and more importantly it is our responsibility to the American people. Thank you. The Chairman. Well, thank you, Senator Baucus. I would point out that we expect the legislation to come up, hopefully, next week. To expedite its consideration, I am hopeful that we are able to reach some kind of unanimous agreement. I do want to point out that, insofar as these hearings are concerned, many of the examples that are cited happened under Republican administrations as well as Democratic, so there is no partisanship in our pursuit of the facts. I would point out that these hearings will deal, in part, with the problem of compliance. But I think the important thing is to get on with the job. [The prepared statement Senator Baucus appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Senator Grassley? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I would caution all my colleagues to forget about points of partisanship or forget about the issue of balance. We heard those same statements made the first day of our hearings last September, and, after that first 24 hours, the things that were laid out were so bad to demonstrate how things are so wrong in the department, that for those hearings and the hearings last February there was never a charge of partisanship after that first day. I think that we also want to remember that when it comes to the IRS trying to bring changes on their own, that through the evolution of the legislation, the Kerrey-Grassley legislation last year, there were always points being made by the IRS that we are going to change this, we are going to change that, we are going to fine tune that, and everything else, always the IRS coming on as a Johnny-come-lately to make change. Just yesterday they announced a seven-point program to improve oversight of the IRS Criminal Investigative Division. Why is the IRS only willing to make change at a point where Congress is exposing some very bad wrongdoing? So I want to begin by saying thank you to the witnesses who will testify before this committee today. I know that for all IRS employees or any government employee there is great peer pressure to go along, to get along with those in the organization. Anybody who wants to say that anything is wrong is kind of treated like a skunk at a Sunday picnic. It takes courage and conviction to sit before us, before the glare of television cameras and before the watching eyes of the IRS and tell your stories. Such courage is rare. Such courage must be encouraged and it must be commended. Such conviction is admirable, for it is the sort of conviction, the conviction to stand up against abuses, to stand up for what is right, that is the backbone of freedom and fairness. Freedom and fairness is what America is all about. This week we will hear testimony about horrors caused by IRS agents that happened at the IRS. This does not mean that all IRS employees are bad. To the contrary, these hearings would not happen without the assistance of good, hardworking IRS employees. These hearings are part of a bigger process, a bigger duty of Congress. One of Congress' most important duties is the oversight of Federal Government. I am not a newcomer to Congressional oversight because it has been a centerpiece of my career. These hearings will demonstrate the importance, the necessity, of Congressional oversight. At this moment, these hearings are about these people and the horrendous acts that have taken place. But in the bigger picture they are proof that more oversight and more diligent oversight is vital. Hopefully these hearings indicate that Congress is willing to step up to the plate and do its part and its constitutional responsibility of continuing IRS oversight, as well as other government agencies. The IRS restructuring legislation recently reported out of committee has strong oversight provisions in it. It is imperative for any legislation to be effective that the Senate continue its diligent oversight. So I commend Senator Roth, and particularly his staffer Eric Thornton, for their work on these hearings. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley. We, next, have Senator Kerrey. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. J. ROBERT KERREY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA Senator Kerrey. Mr. Chairman, first, I cannot even say hello in 3 minutes, so I would like to ask unanimous consent that my statement be a part of the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Kerrey appears in the appendix.] Senator Kerrey. To begin with, throughout this you and I have had some disagreements, but I want to continually and consistently congratulate you and thank you for holding these hearings. I think it is very important. I hope, as Senator Baucus said, we are able to get some hearings on the compliance issue. A week ago Sunday there was an article in the New York Times, a long one, in the Business Section talking about a company, I believe that was in Montana, actually, the Columbia River Aluminum Company, that not only ripped their employees off for $100 million, but parked all their income in the Bahamas so they would not have to pay any taxes. There is an awful lot of that that goes on. I am no apologist for the IRS. Congressman Portman and I, and Senator Shelby before that, launched this effort over 2 years ago. Indeed, the three points that I intend to make during this hearing is that most of the problems we are going to hear about are addressed in the legislation. If they are not, then we ought to get it in the law so when it comes up on the floor we are able to change the law to take care of the various problems that we are identifying, and that there is an urgency to do so, that there is an urgency for us to get that law changed. The second point I intend to make during the hearings is that during our restructuring process from the public we heard over and over and over from citizens that, because the IRS has 535 members of its board of directors called the Congress, the IRS is not Sears and Roebuck, it is created by law, they believe that Congress is the problem and they do not have to look much further than a piece of legislation we passed last week, the Coverdale Education IRA bill. That is the 64th tax law change since 1986. Now, who is going to have to administer that? I mean, just look at the detail of that tax law. It allows tax-free withdrawals, but taxpayers are going to have to keep receipts, detailed receipts. We tell the IRS to go out and audit. We are going to tell the IRS to go out and make sure the taxpayers have those receipts. If you look at the detail in the law and the requirements upon the IRS, you can imagine all sorts of additional problems that will be created as a result. So I say that with great respect and I look forward to the Chairman's hearings on tax simplification. There is tax simplification analysis required. The IRS Commissioner, under the legislation passed by this commission, would be at the table when tax laws are written so they could comment on behalf of taxpayers, who spend, some estimate, up to $200 billion a year just complying with the Code. But I intend to make the point that much of the problem that we hear about occurs as a consequence of laws that the Congress passes. So I am hopeful, Mr. Chairman, that we are able to get some additional hearings on tax compliance. A significant number of Americans believe that they pay higher taxes as a result of somebody else paying lower because they have lawyers, accountants, and all sorts of people hired to figure out how they can avoid paying their fair share. I hope as well that we can get quickly to the simplicity issue because I think it is an overriding issue in terms of our ability to be able to say to the American taxpayer, we are not only going to give the IRS Commissioner authority to run the agency, but we are going to reduce the complexity and the cost to you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kerrey. As I already mentioned, these hearings will deal, in part, with compliance. I agree as to the importance of that matter. I would, next, call on my good friend Senator Breaux. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BREAUX, A U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA Senator Breaux. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, once again, for putting together these hearings. I was talking to someone from Louisiana this weekend and they said, well, what are you folks going to be doing this week in the Senate? I said, well, we are going to start off with some more hearings on the Internal Revenue Service and the problems within the service. His question back to me, which I think was somewhat appropriate, was when are you fellows going to quit talking about it and do something about it? I think that is a valid point. We could probably do this for the rest of the year and still hear the problems, but at some point we have to put the problems aside and say, all right, we know what the problems are, what are we going to do to correct the problems? I think that we have a vehicle that goes a long ways towards doing that. We have passed it out of this committee. It has already passed the House of Representatives. It is now waiting to be taken up in the Senate. So the question back for my constituent, when are you going to quit talking about it and start doing something about it, I think is a very legitimate and valid question. We have to do something about it more than just continue to talk about it, because we could do that for a long time. The second point, however, is all of us know at least various versions of the two greatest lies ever told, one of which is, I am from the Federal Government and I am here to help you. Most people in our country do not believe that the Federal Government is there to help them, and in many cases do not believe the Federal Government is even on their side. We will hear today from a witness from my State of Louisiana, Ray Mayo, who has a very impressive tale to tell as a lawyer representing people before the Internal Revenue Service. Senator Kerrey talked about the complexity of the law and how much we make it complex, and he is right on target on that. But I think even more important than the fact that everybody has a difficult time interpreting the law is the attitude of Federal agents that go to the point of actually threatening people who practice before the IRS and represent clients. That is a far more serious problem, in my view, than carrying out the intricacies of the Federal Code. We cannot tolerate, in a free society, any government agencies or government employees that threaten individual American citizens for trying to follow the law. That, more than anything else, is what disturbs me the greatest about what we are fighting through these hearings. His story is very frightening in a free society, to think that because we do not like you representing your clients, well, we are just going to go out and audit you, and then carry out that threat with actual audits that continue ad infinitum. That is wrong. That is the most serious type of concern that I think we need to be following and following up on, but eventually we have got to do something about it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Breaux. Senator Murkowski. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK H. MURKOWSKI, A U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Murkowski. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate and join with my colleagues in commending you for initiating this series of hearings this morning. The information that was developed by this committee last September, and I think earlier this year, really provided the foundation for the IRS reform legislation which was reported unanimously from this committee and which will be considered on the Senate floor next week. So, as we reflect on where we have been, at least up until now, Mr. Chairman, we have been working in a bipartisan manner and our action has been unanimous. I think that this latest series of hearings examining the workings of the Criminal Investigation Division, the CID, at the IRS, I believe it is not a coincidence that just yesterday, as has been pointed out by you and others, there was the announcement of a seven-point plan to improve its Criminal Investigation Division. The IRS had plenty of time to initiate this. It is coincidental. I commend them, but it is rather interesting to see the sequence of timing here, just before our committee hearing they announce the seven-point plan. I do not think this is surprising. It is a reality that far too often Federal agencies tend to act as if they are a law unto themselves, believing they are accountable to no one. I can think of several Federal agencies that would fit into that, the Forest Service, for one, under its current management. It is only when Congress exercises its constitutional obligation of oversight to the people, only then do the agencies begin to reconsider how they are doing business because they know they are being examined, as they should be, as a consequence of our oversight. So it is my hope that, as the Congress passes the IRS reform bill, we will not end this oversight process, that we can change laws, but we must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure that the people within the IRS are held accountable in how the law is enforced. This is the one key purpose of our oversight. I would remind my colleagues, particularly relative to what we have accomplished here, is when we sat down we agreed that there was no accountability in the IRS. We agreed that the system was designed to avoid accountability. If we have any obligation in an oversight capacity, it is to ensure that there is accountability in the IRS. So I have read through the testimony that has been submitted. I want to express my concerns about one aspect of the testimony that we will hear. I understand that one of the witnesses will testify about the harassment and intimidation he faced because he as an attorney who represented a taxpayer. I think that has already been mentioned this morning. But if the IRS uses threat of criminal or civil proceedings to punish taxpayers, and particularly a taxpayer's legal advocate, I think we have an extraordinarily serious problem. Our system of justice is based on the belief that a citizen has a right to counsel who will represent his client without hesitation. If counsel believes that representing a client before the IRS carries with it the threat of personal audit or an IRS criminal investigation of counsel, then the scales of justice are fundamentally undermined. No legal system can survive if legal counsel fears personal retaliatory threat from the government merely for representing the interests of a client. I think this is a very serious issue and I hope that the committee will closely examine this matter, and other testimony before us. I was disappointed in the comments from my good friend, the Senator from Montana, relative to the partisanship of this. I think the issue is accountability. If we do not get accountability out of this process we are wasting everybody's time, Mr. Chairman. Again, I commend you for your diligence and commitment to proceed in this, and the American public is yearning for reform of the IRS, make no mistake about it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Murkowski. Now it is my pleasure to call on Senator Nickles. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DON NICKLES, A U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. For our colleagues that said they want to see some action, I talked to the Majority Leader yesterday, I think we are going to have the reform bill on the floor next week, so we are going to see some action. Also, this committee is directly responsible for cleaning up a lot of the IRS abuses, and done in a bipartisan way. No one can say that the bill that we put together is partisan. It was not partisan. I will just give you a couple of examples. Some people were saying, well, let us just pass the House bill. We can pass that unanimously and it can be signed into law by the bill. But we are adding a provision that came out in Oklahoma, and also the hearings here, that a taxpayer would be given the opportunity for a court hearing before liens, levies, or seizures of his assets. That is a very important provision. It was not in the House bill, but is in the Senate bill. We are putting in a provision that IRS can only seize a taxpayer's business or home as a last resort. We are putting in a provision that says that penalties and interest would not accrue to the deficiency if the IRS does not notify the taxpayer within a year. I could go on with several. I have got about a dozen things that we added that was not in the House bill, is in the Senate bill, that are very, very positive in protecting taxpayers. So, we are going to see some action as a direct result of the hearings that we had in this committee. So, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for doing it. I want to thank you for your persistence, because a lot of people were saying, let us just pass what the House did. We are going to come up with a bill that is much better than the House bill. We are going to put in some provisions for innocent spouses, for example. One other thing, Mr. Chairman, I will just mention. We had hearings in Oklahoma. Every once in a while I think IRS is getting it because I hear, oh, yes, they are going to come up with some reforms, and that is good. We had a hearing, Mr. Chairman, of a woman who was a pet groomer and 10 years ago realized she owed $4,000, was willing to work it out and make payments on a monthly basis and pay it off in two or 3 years, and the IRS said no. They accumulated interest and penalties up to $30,000. We exposed this in the hearing in Oklahoma. As a result of that, she has made offers to the IRS. Supposedly IRS said, well, we accept your offer. They will take the $4,000 and settle the case. She presented a certified check to the IRS for $4,000, which they said by letter they would accept, and then they said, no, we cannot do that because of interest. Interest on $4,000--she paid 2 days after they accepted it--was $1.37. They still have a lien on this woman's home, who is a pet groomer, from a case that goes back 10 years. What was the dispute now? The interest of the $4,000 over 2 days, and the lien still exists. So I am not sure the IRS gets it yet. In the bill that we will take up next week we say that liens will not be allowed if the original tax debt was less than $5,000, and would have solved that case. The IRS will be required to adopt liberal acceptance policies for offers and compromise. Clearly, you have a case where an agent was not willing to do that, for a couple of bucks. It is ridiculous, the harassment, the anguish that taxpayers go through because sometimes people do not show common sense. We also put in a provision to fire employees that abuse their power. We found cases in Oklahoma and Arkansas where power was clearly abused and, to date, no one has been disciplined; a couple of people have been transferred, one person retired early. So, Mr. Chairman, I think your hearings have resulted in good legislation. As the hearings go on, the legislation is improving. I think we have improved the House bill considerably, and I compliment you for it. I also compliment you for the hearings this week as well. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Nickles. It is now my pleasure to call upon my distinguished colleague, the Ranking Member, scholar in residence, Senator Moynihan. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW YORK Senator Moynihan. A 10:00 scholar, Mr. Chairman. Forgive me. I was informed the schedule had been changed, and I am here a bit late, so I will not take but a moment to thank you again for resuming these hearings. These are the first such in a century and a half. The Internal Revenue Service was established in 1862, which was the first time the Federal Government enacted an income tax, and it has grown very considerably and with very little oversight from this committee. Now it is receiving just that, and I think it is all to the good. We have seen in the first instance the appointment of Charles Rossotti, who was appointed as Commissioner, unanimously approved in this committee and unanimously approved by the Senate. We are already seeing the energy in which he is proceeding. In one specific, he has asked Charles Bowsher, the former head of the General Accounting Office with a great range of interests and ability in the area of public administration, to perform an independent review of the IRS Inspection Service. I think we shall learn a good deal from that, and I look forward to it. I look forward to these hearings, and ask that my statement be placed in the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Moynihan appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Next, we have Senator Bryan. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT H. BRYAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA Senator Bryan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for calling this hearing this morning. The abuse of taxpayers is inexcusable. Once the facts of these cases can be demonstrated, I will eagerly join with you, Mr. Chairman, and the rest of our colleagues in demanding that Commissioner Rossotti take immediate and decisive action to eliminate any injustices that we discover this week. Taxpayers have the right to be treated with courtesy, they have the right to be treated fairly and honestly by the IRS, and no taxpayer should be subject to or fearful of some kind of arbitrary star chamber treatment at the hands of the IRS. Any Federal employee or organization that abuses the public trust should be dealt with harshly, and the IRS is clearly no exception. We need to pass legislation to address the many problems in the agency that our hearings last fall and the hearings this week will indicate. We need to pass the IRS reform bill that we reported out earlier this year sooner rather than later. Commissioner Rossotti has already proven himself able and ready to meet the many challenges at the IRS, and we need to give him the tools to achieve the real results. While the outrages we will hear of this week certainly deserve our immediate response, I think it is important to retain some perspective. Millions of Americans pay their taxes every year. Yes, April 15th is a painful experience for each of us, but the vast majority of Americans pay their taxes each year. Protecting these honest, hardworking taxpayers needs to be our highest priority. One of the biggest grievances that I hear about our tax system is that many people feel that not everyone is paying his or her fair share. Most Americans file a relatively simple, straightforward 1040 form with a few simple deductions, maybe some modest capital gains. But there is a growing suspicion among typical taxpayers that somehow someone else is getting better treatment, taking advantage of complicated special tax loopholes that relieve that person or that entity of his, her, or its proper share of the tax burden through tax shelters, corporate loopholes, and the like. Even worse, in my opinion, Mr. Chairman, are those who cheat the government, the tax evaders. The general public knows that if individuals do not pay their taxes, that the burden is shifted to them and it means that they will pay higher taxes. Some estimates show that Federal revenues lost to noncompliance may approach $100 billion a year, a staggering sum. Pols show a very real suspicion that not everyone is paying their fair share. On average, Americans believe that one-third cheat on their taxes. Noncompliance is a serious problem, one that hits every honest taxpayer in the pocketbook each and every April 15th. I would hope, Mr. Chairman, in the interest of providing balance to these proceedings, that we might have some hearings addressed to the tax cheat and the tax evader as well. I look forward to working with you in the hearings this week, and in the future week, in moving the IRS reform legislation to enactment in this Congress. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Bryan. Senator Mack? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CONNIE MACK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Mack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a prepared statement which I will ask to be put in the record, and just make this observation. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Mack appears in the appendix.] Senator Mack. Senator Moynihan said a few moments ago that there has been very little oversight of the IRS. I would say it has not just been this committee, it has been the Commissioner, it has been the Treasury. Virtually everyone has kind of looked the other way when it has come to the IRS. So my point here is, while I understand the frustration some members may feel with getting on with it, the reality is, we have just begun to focus. So I would encourage you to continue to have oversight hearings. In fact, the Majority Leader is fond of saying that one of the things that we have not done well is oversight. I think you are to be commended for the effort that you are making. Those who are anxious to get on with it will have the opportunity next week, as I believe the legislation will move to the floor. So I commend you for oversight and would encourage you to continue it. The last point that I would make is, fortunately we have what I would consider brave taxpayers, practitioners, and others who are willing to come forward and speak the truth about abuses that they have seen, regardless of the fear that they have about being intimidated by those who want to see that the status quo is maintained. So again, I commend you for these hearings and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Mack. And finally we have Senator Conrad. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. KENT CONRAD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Conrad. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just would indicate that I have a prepared statement as well that I would ask to be made part of the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Conrad appears in the appendix.] Senator Conrad. Instead of going through that, Mr. Chairman, I would just make some observations as well. First of all, I agree with what Senator Mack has said. We do have an obligation of oversight and there has been too little of it, not just with respect to the Internal Revenue Service, but I think that is a general indictment of those of us in Congress who focus more on getting the budgets done every year, the appropriations bills done every year, and new legislation. Part of our responsibility is oversight, and there has clearly been a failure of oversight of this agency. I think one thing we need to say loud and clear and up front, is that abusive treatment of taxpayers is totally unacceptable. Anybody in any agency who abuses taxpayers ought to be punished. That is just unacceptable. If we do not treat the taxpayers with respect, that breeds disrespect for the system, so that is something we cannot tolerate. I think it is also important to acknowledge that there are many in the Internal Revenue Service who are honest, who are capable, and who do not disrespect taxpayers. Those people should not be sullied or marred by the few who have abused the system, who have acted unfairly, inappropriately, and even at times illegally. Mr. Chairman, I would also want to add my voice to that of Senator Bryan. As a former tax commissioner myself at the State level and a former chairman of the Multi-State Tax Commission, I know there are a small percentage of taxpayers who also abuse the system and abuse everyone else who is in the system. That also should not be tolerated. It is not fair to the vast majority of taxpayers who do pay what they legitimately owe to have more of a burden put on their shoulders because of the small percentage of people who think they are above the law and beyond the law and have no obligation to pay what they legitimately owe. The word should go out from this committee, just as we say it is intolerable that IRS agents abuse taxpayers, it is also intolerable that some who are supposed to be taxpayer are abusing other taxpayers by failing to pay what they owe. Mr. Chairman, finally, I would say I also agree that the legislation that came out of this committee to reform the IRS is far superior to what came out of the House. You are to be commended for a much better bill than what came out of the House. And it is important that we pass that legislation on the floor of the Senate. I know that is not your responsibility, but I would address my remarks to the Majority Leader, who does control the schedule, and urge him to take up the IRS reform bill at his earliest possible opportunity. I know the Majority Leader has many competing demands for floor time, but I would hope we would move that IRS reform bill at our earliest opportunity. I would just alert the Majority Leader that Senator Nickles indicated that you may intend to bring that bill to the floor next week, and I think that would be an excellent move following these hearings. So again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for conducting these oversight hearings. I think it is important and I think we have got an obligation to do it. I again commend you for the excellent bill you helped produce in this committee. The Chairman. Just let me repeat what I have said before, that you are living proof that you can be a tax collector and still elected to office. So, I congratulate you. [Laughter.] It is now my pleasure to call on the Majority Leader, Senator Lott. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, A U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI Senator Lott. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know that several Senators have already had statements to make, and I do not want to give one at this point. I am very interested in hearing the witnesses and the other witnesses we will have this week. I want to commend you and the Ranking Member for going forward with these hearings. I want to assure the Senators on the committee and the full Senate that it is my intent that the IRS reform bill come up next week. I believe that we should be able to begin, if the Chairman is ready, Monday. We do have a number of other important issues that we will be trying to get done before that and immediately afterward. I hope that we can do it within a reasonable period of days, but it is our intent for it to be first up next week. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the leadership you have provided on this issue. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Lott. Before I recognize the first panel I would like to welcome Jennifer Long, who was a witness at our hearings in September. We appreciate her being here today. We now come to welcoming the members of our first panel, employees of the Department of the Treasury. As I said earlier, there could be no hearings if it were not for the willingness of employees to come to us and testify about their concern. Senator Conrad, I just want to once again echo what you said and what I said in my opening remarks about the employees of the IRS because I do think it is critically important that everyone understand that the vast majority of employees of the IRS are intelligent, hardworking, and doing the best they can, sometimes under very adverse, difficult circumstances. But these employees that are on the first panel, I think, will provide the committee with information and insight about the problems within the IRS involving investigation of employee misconduct. They will also address what appears to be a lack of internal disciplinary action taken against employees when allegations of wrongdoing are substantiated. Our witnesses include Mr. Richard Calahan, who is the Deputy Inspector General, Office of the IG at the Department of the Treasury; Mr. Harry Patsalides, who is the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigation at the Department of Treasury; and Ms. Yvonne D. DesJardins, who is the Chief of the Employee and Labor Relations Section, Personnel Branch, of the Internal Revenue Service. I will now ask the witnesses to stand and raise their right hand. [Whereupon, the three witnesses were duly sworn.] The Chairman. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Mr. Calahan, would you please begin. Mr. Calahan. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, we are pleased that you asked us to appear before you today to discuss our investigative work at the Internal Revenue Service. It is my pleasure to introduce to you Harry Patsalides, the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, who has overseen our IRS investigations. He will discuss some of our recent investigative work. Harry? The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Patsalides? STATEMENT OF HARRY PATSALIDES, DEPUTY ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR INVESTIGATION, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I appear before you today to discuss our investigative work at the Internal Revenue Service. As the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, I have overseen our office's investigations of the IRS and will discuss some of our recent efforts. The hearings held before this committee last September produced several groups of allegations which were referred for investigation to the Treasury Office of Inspector General. In addition, telephone calls to the OIG hotline more than doubled in response to those hearings. This provided a serious challenge to our investigative resources, as the OIG Office of Investigations has the responsibility for investigating all employees at the eight non-law enforcement bureaus, as well as senior level officials and all employees in the Offices of Inspection, Internal Affairs, and Chief Counsel at each of the four law enforcement bureaus. Our staffing was insufficient to conduct a number of significant cases that warranted investigation. Because of this, many issues had to be returned to the bureaus for action, since we lacked the resources to conduct the necessary investigations. Our efforts were focused on four significant investigations involving misconduct by IRS officials. All of the allegations were investigated. Due to limited resources, we could only fully staff one of the investigations. We requested IRS Inspection to conduct two investigations, with OIG review. The fourth investigation was conducted by the OIG, but assistance was needed from three IRS inspectors and two Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents. The four investigations pertained to a series of complaints involving: (1) IRS mismanagement and mistreatment of taxpayers; (2) the use of collection statistics by IRS Collection Division managers to determine employee and group performance ratings; (3) the establishment of an IRS national policy regarding the use of collection statistics; and (4) reprisals against IRS employees who testified before this committee. Because of its large scope, we referred the allegations regarding the questionable use of collection statistics to the IRS Chief Inspector's Office. Subsequently, we reviewed their work with the assistance of experienced investigators on detail to us from other Treasury law enforcement bureaus of ATF, the Secret Service, and the Customs Service. We appreciate the support provided by the department and those bureaus in this endeavor. Senator Nickles, in the February 5th Finance Committee hearing, requested that we investigate a group of allegations he received regarding the Internal Revenue Service. We obtained the assistance of investigators from ATF and the IRS Inspections to work under OIG supervision on these allegations. On October 23, 1997, our office initiated an investigation regarding the allegations raised to the Senate Finance Committee by IRS employee Jennifer Long. During the investigation of the allegations raised by Ms. Long, additional issues were identified which have led to possibly six new cases being opened by our office. As a result of the investigation of Long's allegations, we noted several areas of significant concern. IRS management appears to treat managers differently than employees when it pertains to disciplinary action. We were advised that IRS managers are allowed to voluntarily step down from their management position rather than being involuntarily removed. IRS management stated this was done to avoid the cost of a potential lawsuit. An inspection manager stated that, ``IRS managers are punished less severely than IRS employees.'' It was this manager's opinion that, since most managers have worked well for years with little or no prior problems, that their transgressions have been viewed with less severity. We are also concerned that if an employee files a grievance, an EEO complaint, or a lawsuit against an IRS manager and the employee wins the settlement, usually no disciplinary action is taken against the manager for allegedly violating the rights of the employee. This lack of disciplinary action may send a message to managers that they are free to harass an employee without being personally accountable. This also sends a message to employees that they cannot bring action against a manager who harasses or retaliates against them because only the agency is held accountable. Employees may fear retaliation by management for reporting complaints to Inspection. Long alleged that Inspection advises IRS management of allegations provided to them and who provided the information. There appears to be disagreement among Inspection employees regarding whether or not complainants' names are provided to management. Several of the Inspection employees interviewed said the complainants' names are provided to management, while others indicated the names are not provided. When employees bring a complaint to Inspection they are routinely not advised whether the information will be investigated by Inspection or referred to IRS management. When management decides to address the complaint it does not advise Inspection of their action taken regarding the issue. If the complaint to Inspection concerns a manager and is subsequently referred to management, the manager may unnecessarily be advised of the complaint and the complainant's name. Once management is alerted to the complaint, the employee may fear retaliation for lodging the complaint. Before concluding my oral statement I would also like to mention one of the most significant problems that our office has with the current oversight arrangement. With regard to accessing tax information, our office does not have the same level of access to IRS information that is afforded to the Office of Chief Inspector. While for the most part we have been able to obtain the needed information, we have had instances where access was refused or delayed and we had to expend unnecessary time and effort to resolve the matter or find alternatives to accomplish our objectives. Legislative impediments center around two provisions in the 1988 Inspector General Act amendments. First, the OIG is required to provide notice to the IRS of its intent to access returns or return information. Second, with reference to Chapter 75 of the Internal Revenue Code, the OIG may report to the Attorney General only offenses under Section 7214 without first obtaining the consent of the IRS Commissioner. This provision restricts the authority of the Treasury OIG to refer violations of the Internal Revenue Code such as Section 7213 pertaining to unauthorized disclosures of returns or return information to the Department of Justice. Both of these provisions have affected our work. One, is a process totally inconsistent with independent investigative procedure because it requires OIG investigators to needlessly notify others of the direction of their investigation. The requirement for obtaining IRS Commissioner consent on referrals to the Department of Justice creates the possibility for conflicts of interest and precludes an objective review of the prosecutive potential. In conclusion, while performing our normally extensive investigative responsibilities at the IRS, we were tasked, in response to this committee's September hearing, to intensify our investigative efforts in specific areas. Through the extraordinary efforts of our entire staff, we met this additional challenge and maintained our normal duties and responsibilities in an effective and timely manner. I can state to this committee that I am proud of the performance of our staff. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I will be happy to address any questions that you may have. The Chairman. Well, thank you, Mr. Patsalides. [The prepared statement of Mr. Patsalides appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. We will hear from the final member of the panel first, then we will address questions to all of you. It is now my pleasure to call upon Ms. DesJardins. STATEMENT OF YVONNE D. DesJARDINS, CHIEF, EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS SECTION, PERSONNEL BRANCH, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC Ms. DesJardins. Mr. Chairman and honorable members of this committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to share with you some of my experiences since working at the Internal Revenue Service. During the period March 1991 through October 1996, I was an employee of the Internal Revenue Service. Since October 1996, I have been employed with the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, where I currently serve as the Chief of the Employee and Labor Relations Section of the Personnel Branch. During my tenure with the IRS I have worked in both supervisory and non-supervisory personnel positions and have had responsibility for providing advisory services to IRS managers regarding employee performance and conduct issues, up to and including the executive level. During this time, I have observed how higher graded employees of the organization are not held to the same standards as employees of lesser grades, particularly when misconduct occurs. My statement should not come as a surprise, particularly when one recalls the comprehensive investigation in 1988 into alleged ethics and integrity violations by IRS senior officials which culminated in hearings referred to as the Bernard hearings, and reported to the 102nd Congress in House Report 1021065 entitled ``IRS Programs to Combat Senior Level Misconduct: Getting Stronger, But Still A Long Way to Go.'' This report identified serious problems with the manner in which IRS failed to properly handle misconduct of senior level officials, particularly with respect to appropriate disciplinary actions. The report concluded that the IRS culture needed to be changed to demonstrate that misconduct by anyone, including senior level officials, would not be tolerated and that employees could report misconduct without fear or reprisal or retaliation against whistleblowers. As a result of this report, the IRS implemented an aggressive ethics program which required every IRS employee to participate in training, and included ethics publications and extensive internal communications efforts. Unfortunately, ethics is something that a person cannot be taught with brief classroom training. Therefore, I am here today to report that ethics in the IRS still has a long way to go in order to persuade taxpayers and the IRS work force that fair, equitable, and consistent treatment of all is paramount to the IRS. I can only speak from my personal experiences and observations since working for the IRS. Unfortunately, a good portion of what I have observed leaves much to be desired when it comes to consistent treatment of individuals regarding discipline and in the manner in which the IRS deals with whistleblowers. The whistleblowers are ostracized and careers destroyed, and those senior officials who engaged in the misconduct which was reported and substantiated are not only protected from receiving any disciplinary actions, but are oftentimes rewarded during the same year the misconduct occurs. Again, I speak from personal experience. During the period May 1994 to October 1996, I handled the many reports of misconduct that were made against any senior IRS officials grade 15 and above. These reports were in the form of investigations, telephonic hotline complaints, and written complaints. For approximately a 2-year period I had program responsibility for these matters and recommendations were made to the Deputy Commissioner of IRS. While a good portion of these complaints were made by disgruntled employees and resulted in either closing without action or possibly a counseling of the individual, there were instances of serious misconduct which ultimately required disciplinary action against a senior official. In some instances, actions were taken. However, in many instances they were not. In those instances where no action was taken it appeared that those individuals were being protected by the organization by either being reassigned, with payment of relocation expenses, or until they either retired or sufficient time had elapsed to make the matter moot. As an example, I recall one instance of an executive who was investigated by the Office of Inspector General, Department of the Treasury, for travel fraud. The allegations were substantiated, yet no action against this person was forthcoming. Rather, the report remained in the Deputy Commissioner's Office for an extended period of time with no action taken. Another example involved a senior IRS official who had a reputation for abusing and mistreating subordinates, regardless of where this person worked in the organization. The OIG investigated this individual and the results of the investigation supported a serious disciplinary action. Again, however, the case remained in the Deputy Commissioner's Office for well over one year with no action taken. A third case involved another travel fraud issue by an executive. This particular case was closed with a minor action, although it was substantiated that the individual provided false statements not only during the course of the investigation, but to the Commissioner as well when required to petition for a waiver of the funds in question. Another case involved sexual harassment by a senior official. Although a disciplinary action was recommended, it remained on the Deputy Commissioner's desk for over 2 years, at which time the executive retired and the case was closed. The disciplinary action was never issued to the executive. In a more recent action for which I was personally involved as the whistleblower, senior officials were not disciplined even though the allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse were substantiated by the OIG and reported to the Office of Special Counsel. These allegations involved serious misconduct by certain IRS officials with responsibility for carrying out the personnel programs of the IRS. These actions, which included the processing of illegal performance appraisals and awards, would have had a detrimental effect on any reduction in force that the IRS would have had to run, yet no actions were taken even though the misconduct was reported, investigated by the OIG, and substantiated well in advance of IRS plans to run a reduction in force. A subordinate manager was directed to provide a false report regarding this matter. Additionally, time and attendance fraud was brought to the attention of this same official, and I and others were directed to not report the matter to Inspection merely because this person was new in the position and did not want to confront the matter because of who the individuals committing the fraud were and the potential political problems which would have resulted with the confrontation. Even though this matter was raised numerous times, no action was ever taken. Again, this issue was reported to the OSC and substantiated by the OIG during its investigation. To date, the person responsible for this misconduct remains in this position of trust and is authorized to carry out the personnel program for the IRS. The egregious misconduct, as well as misconduct by other officials, was substantiated by the OIG during its investigation and interview of approximately 20 witnesses, yet was ultimately viewed by the Deputy Commissioner of the IRS as a minor infraction of rules and no disciplinary action was taken. In the meantime, because I challenged this misconduct and ultimately reported it to the OSC in October 1994, I have suffered retaliation and continue to suffer retaliation as a result of my whistleblowing activities and participation in the OIG investigation. Additionally, I have expended an outrageous amount of personal funds for legal expenses, yet no relief is forthcoming. When I attempted to seek employment outside of the IRS, my efforts were stopped by my present organization through false and misleading information, as well as disclosure of my protected activities during the background check. I have been told that my first- and second-line managers no longer have trust and confidence in me, and my attorney was told by the executive for whom I work that I am a liar and a manipulator, a statement which he now denies. There are other examples that can be cited, but it became clear to me and others that senior level officials were consistently protected by their fellow executives. Many of the professional personnelists who were charged with the responsibility of handling these cases often joked and commented that a trained personnelist was not necessary in order to put a ``Close Without Action'' letter on the cases. It was often commented that the skills of an Employee Relations Specialist were considered to be a detriment rather than an asset, particularly when we attempted to ensure consistency of penalties in our actions. The executives of the IRS are close to each other, frequently socializing with each other, and often developing lifelong friendships. Because of this, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for one executive to recommend and take an action against another. I observed that in most instances warranting disciplinary action, more effort went into how to clear the person rather than what needed to be done to ensure the misconduct did not recur. Exceptions were made and preferential treatment was granted. Excuses were readily accepted and misconduct was often reduced to being minor. In several instances it became clear that the IRS applied different standards to the higher graded individuals, which oftentimes resulted in one set of rules for executives and another for the remainder of the work force. Unfortunately, it is an indication of how misconduct by senior officials is viewed. There is always justification and good reason for their actions, even if a double standard has to be applied. My purpose in appearing today is to assist you in determining the best course of action in addressing the manner in which senior level misconduct is investigated and dealt with in the IRS. My appearance today is certainly at great personal risk, however, it is something that I believe is necessary. I sincerely believe that much needs to be done in order to raise the level of ethics and integrity in order to increase the public trust of the IRS. Until the IRS is sincerely willing to deal with misconduct and not retaliate against those people who report it, a healing process cannot begin. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. DesJardins appears in the appendix.] The Chairman. Well, I want to thank both of you, Ms. DesJardins, and Mr. Patsalides, for being here today. I know it takes a great deal of courage to appear here, that there is considerable risk. I want to thank you for discharging your responsibility. Ms. DesJardins, you were responsible for receiving the reports of investigation conducted on various IRS managers and providing them to the Deputy Commissioner for action. Could you explain further how this process worked and what was supposed to be done? Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir. The cases would come in to the Deputy Commissioner's Office and they, in turn, would then be brought to my office, where I would log the inventory and complete a case analysis and refer the cases out for action to the appropriate regional commissioner or chief officer who had responsibility for the investigation. They, in turn, would conduct further inquiry. They would make recommendations to the Deputy Commissioner. The recommendations would come back to me. I would prepare another case analysis and finalize it and make a recommendation to the Deputy Commissioner as to whether or not the proposed action would be acceptable. The Chairman. Now, are misconduct reports on senior IRS executives being shelved at the Deputy Commissioner's level? Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir, in some instances. The Chairman. How often is this a practice, could you comment on that? Ms. DesJardins. My observation was that, in those instances where there was serious misconduct which would support a disciplinary action against an individual, they tended to be shelved and no decisions were made in terms of recommendations or what actions would be taken. The Chairman. So it was not an exception, but more often a practice. Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir. The Chairman. Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. The Chairman. As you are aware, we have reviewed a number of investigation files from your office and the IRS Chief Inspector's Office. I would like to ask you about a couple of them that concern me. Let me give you information from one IRS Inspection Office report completed in 1995. It appears that a manager in the Criminal Investigation Division who was responsible for overseeing undercover operations in his region managed to steal 20 government-owned vehicles for his personal gain. Also, this person's supervisors were aware of his misuse of government credit cards, yet failed to notify Inspection of his misconduct. How could such a thing like that happen? What happened to the individual, was he prosecuted? Senator Moynihan. Mr. Chairman, did you say 20 automobiles? The Chairman. Twenty. Senator Moynihan. Twenty. Senator Gramm. Did he have a used car business or what? The Chairman. Mr. Patsalides? Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Chairman, the person was prosecuted by a method called deferred prosecution, which is not very often used. He had to repay $20,000 and he was put on 2 years' probation. After that 2-year probation, the case is dismissed. The records show that the case was dismissed. The Chairman. Is he still with the IRS? Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, he has left the IRS. The Chairman. How long was he there after that? Mr. Patsalides. I am not sure, sir, but I believe he retired during this process. The Chairman. So he was ordered to pay $20,000 restitution, but he stole, what, 20 government-owned vehicles. Mr. Patsalides. Basically, the investigation disclosed that the CID's office failed to account for all seized vehicles in the possession of that IRS office and to verify that their use was for undercover operations. So, there was a lack of internal controls there. The Chairman. Now, let me ask you this. Has your agency had any involvement in auditing or investigating the IRS undercover operations? Mr. Patsalides. No, sir, we have not. I checked with the Office of the Chief Inspector and their last national audit of this area was conducted in November 1995. The Chairman. In 1995. Now, I understand that the former IRS National Director of EEO and Diversity was investigated by the Inspections Office for allegations against him involving sexual harassment. According to the report, the allegations were substantiated and involved several victims. I have a few questions I would like to ask. Was that individual the top EEO manager in the IRS? Mr. Patsalides. Yes. The Chairman. What happened to that individual? Mr. Patsalides. He received a letter of official reprimand and was reassigned without a demotion. The Chairman. Did this individual have any previous complaints of harassment alleged against him? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he did. The Chairman. What happened to these complaints? Mr. Patsalides. The first complaint that was made was at the point where this gentlemen was entering the Executive Development Program and his manager did not want to address that complaint because he did not want to in any way, I guess, detract from this person's management development. The Chairman. So in spite of concerns about alleged misconduct by this individual, is it correct that he was transferred to the IRS national office as the National Director of EEO? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. The Chairman. Now, I have a 1996 report from the IRS Inspection Office where an IRS revenue officer was arrested by a State trooper for drunk driving and the IRS employee threatened to audit the State trooper unless he allowed the IRS employee to go. Now, it seems to me that the State trooper was just doing his job. But when the trooper was interviewed he stated he was extremely concerned and afraid of what the IRS employee could do to him in terms of causing him economic hardship. What happened to that IRS revenue officer; where is he today? Mr. Patsalides. He is still employed. He entered into what they called a last chance settlement agreement where he agreed to enter a rehabilitation program for his alcohol abuse, and also agreed that if he had any future violations related to that, that he would be fired without appeal. The Chairman. So he is still dealing with taxpayers today. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he is. The Chairman. The next case I would like to ask you about involves a distinguished tax practitioner who has provided testimony before this committee's hearings. The practitioner received an anonymous written threat that was received prior to our September hearings when the practitioner testified which he believes was sent by an IRS revenue officer. In fact, I have the letter that contained the threat in front of me. The following statement was typed on the top of a newspaper article that involved the IRS arresting a tax mediator. The statement is, ``You and your clients are next. If you don't think it can happen, call David Kay and numerous attorneys in Los Angeles. You are currently under investigation and I am waiting for the day your name is in the paper.'' Now, when the IRS Inspection Office investigated the matter they clearly determined that the letter had been typed on a typewriter within the revenue officer's immediate office. What happened to that IRS employee who made the threat; is he dealing with taxpayers today? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, he is. He is still there. The Chairman. Can you say what happened to him? Mr. Patsalides. The investigation was not able to completely substantiate that he was the one that typed this note, even though the forensic lab identified that the letter came from that particular office, was postmarked at that office, and the typewriter ribbon was obtained and indicated that the letter was typed in that office. We feel, and the report did not show that, but potentially some additional investigative work regarding that situation, some additional interviews of the employees, review of their case loads to see if there was any other involvement with that practitioner, plus a statement analysis might still be of help in identifying and pinpointing who might have sent that letter. The Chairman. In other words, you feel that they called off the investigation too early. Mr. Patsalides. Potentially, yes, sir. I do not have the full case file, so I do not know the extent of their full investigation. However, in reviewing it there is no indication that they did these other things that I just mentioned. I believe that they might be able to help identify who the person was. The Chairman. That concludes my first round of questions. Senator Moynihan? Senator Moynihan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am trying to make some sense of the organizational structure here. I suppose that the fact of the Section 6103 confidentiality of taxpayer returns makes for a culture of compartmentalization in the IRS that is different from other places. I do not know that, but I feel that. You seem to indicate some agreement. I would ask you, Mr. Patsalides, why do we mention no names here? That fellow who robbed us of 20 automobiles, that was a crime, was it not? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Moynihan. Well, what is his name? The names of criminals are not confidential records, are they? I just find this unusual. Mr. Patsalides. I am sure they are listed in the public records. Senator Moynihan. What is his name? Mr. Patsalides. But I believe I would have to check with my counsel. Senator Moynihan. Have you got a counsel around? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. But I believe there are some privacy issues there and it is not normally our process to disclose those kinds of issues publicly. Senator Moynihan. Counsel, come forth. [Pause.] Mr. Patsalides. Sir, with the records that we had, we were unable to determine if this is a matter of public record. All we had were the investigative files. If, in fact, it is a matter of public record we would be very pleased to provide the Senator with that name. Senator Moynihan. No. I am not sort of pressing you to know who the name of this man is, or where that Woodstock typewriter came from and who was using it, and so forth. One is impressed by how tightened up your procedures are with respect to names and individuals. I think it rises out of the confidentiality of tax returns. Mr. Calahan, do you have any sense of that? Or tell me if I am wrong. I am not infrequently wrong. Mr. Calahan. Well, it arises also out of the process of conducting investigations. That entire process is on a need-to- know basis. We are very careful. Senator Moynihan. Well, should the public not have a need to know? Mr. Calahan. Not until it is completed. Senator Moynihan. Not until it is complete. Mr. Calahan. Yes, sir. And as I said, if it is a public record, we would be happy to provide that information to you. Senator Moynihan. I do not need the information. Mr. Calahan. But we are taught to be very close-held regarding this kind of information. Senator Moynihan. Closely held. Mr. Calahan. Yes, sir. Mr. Patsalides. I would just like to add that our office takes the Privacy Act very seriously and we are very careful in terms of how we exercise our work in accordance with its provisions. Senator Moynihan. Sure. Sure. I understand and appreciate that. We have comparable agencies in the government who are equally buttoned up, not internally, but from external inquiry, which may be part of the problem that the Chairman has identified here. I certainly would like to know more about this matter of David Kay and that typewriter. That is unacceptable, ``You and your clients are next.'' Now, if that came from an IRS employee, that is abuse of power. You would be the first to agree, would you not, Mr. Patsalides, Mr. Calahan? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Mr. Calahan. We would. We would. Mr. Patsalides. I would and I can assure you that, after we get back to the office, we intend to meet with the Office of the Chief Inspector and discuss this case and see if there is any additional work that can be done. Senator Moynihan. All right. If a prothonotary warbler shows up in the evidence, we know we have a large issue that may go beyond the confines of the U.S. borders. I am referring to those inquiries about Woodstock typewriter and the sighting of the prothonotary warbler. You youth know so little about our history. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. [Laughter.] Senator Moynihan. But do look into that, will you not? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Moynihan. This is something that we will not have, nor would you. Mr. Patsalides. I agree. No, sir, we would not have that. Senator Moynihan. Of course you would not. So, Mr. Chairman, can we hope that we will learn more about that? The Chairman. Absolutely. Mr. Patsalides. Senator, we will take that as a request from you at this point. Senator Moynihan. Perhaps you would take it as a request from the committee, sir. Is that all right, Mr. Chairman? The Chairman. That is fine. Senator Moynihan. Thank you. And thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Ms. DesJardins. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Moynihan. Senator Grassley? Senator Grassley. I think as we listen to the testimony that we have before us that we can both be pleased that things like this are coming out, but I think we obviously have to be outraged at the same time. I am pleased that these allegations are finally coming to light, but obviously we cannot stand this sort of activity in our government. People want to be proud of their government. People want to have trust in their government. It seems to me that the agency that deals with more American citizens than all other government agencies put together, which happens to be the IRS, is the one that can set a standard for all other bureaucracies, and ought to set that standard. Obviously, as a result of just this first panel, anyone watching would be very outraged at what is going on and wonder whether or not we are a government of the people, whether or not we are really a participatory democracy, whether the rule of law is followed in a bureaucracy like it is expected to be followed by the citizenry. You never get used to these sorts of allegations. You never get desensitized to these sorts of happenings. I would like to tell you what it would be like to be a U.S. Senator and trying to justify this sort of thing at the grass roots meetings of the State of Iowa. Or for instance, if any of us in the Senate did exactly these same things or we conducted the employment in our office these ways, we would not be tolerated for a minute. We would be out so fast on our ears that we would not know what happened to us. So that is why it is very important that we have a standard that we can all be very proud of. Ms. DesJardins, you discussed many cases where wrongdoing was found but no disciplinary action was taken. Could you, and if you could, would you be willing to, after these hearings give us more specifics so that we, either as a committee, or myself as an individual member of the committee, can pass these on to Commissioner Rossotti? Because I think the new Commissioner shows a willingness to get to the bottom of all these things right away, overcome these problems, and reestablish the credibility of the IRS. I would like to make sure that action is taken on these, if it is warranted. Ms. DesJardins. Yes, sir. I would be happy to do that. Senator Grassley. All right. Thank you very much. You state in your written testimony, Mr. Patsalides, that you have these limited resources that are a challenge to your office. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Grassley. Is that something that you would find within the bureaucracy of the IRS, difficulty fighting for the amount of resources you need, regardless of the amount of money that the IRS gets, or is this something that you think relates to the fact that Congress just is not giving enough money in the first place? Mr. Patsalides. The Treasury Office of Inspector General is independent of IRS and is dependent on funding from the Congress. Senator Grassley. All right. Then take out the word IRS and put in place of it the Treasury Department officials. Is this a battle that you have within the bureaucracy, getting resources? Are you always told, well, Congress just does not give us enough money? Mr. Patsalides. Mr. Calahan, do you want to answer that? Senator Grassley. It is all right with me if you answer. Mr. Calahan. Thank you, Senator. The amount of resources we have is obviously a function of the budget process. That goes through several levels of review, the department, the OMB, and the Congress. Mr. Patsalides. Senator Grassley, from my standpoint in the Office of Investigations, all our investigations are done professionally and with high quality. I demand that of our investigators. The problem is, we have too many significant allegations and not enough staff to investigate all those allegations. We will never have enough staff to investigate all of the allegations, but the more significant ones, the ones we feel we should be involved with, we cannot even do, therefore, we are forced to refer many of these allegations back to IRS management for resolution. When we do, we do request that they respond back to us with the results of their review, but we are unable to do those ourselves independently of IRS. Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I guess my time is up. The Chairman. That is right. Senator Grassley. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Grassley. We will now call on Senator Kerrey, please. Senator Kerrey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Patsalides, you described, and then later identified, two significant issues. One, is your authority and the other is the problems that are associated with alleged inadequate or disparate discipline. You have identified it as a problem, as well as alleged sexual harassment and racial discrimination as issues that are not being addressed. What I would like to direct your attention to--in fact, all of the witnesses attention to--is the legislation as passed by the House and as passed by this committee dealing, first of all, with the Inspector General, second dealing with a new board that will have significant authority and responsibilities, and last, dealing with new powers and authorities granted to the Commissioner. I have got to say at the beginning, my own view is that, unless and until just sort of common sense judgments are made-- I appreciate you are going to get back to the committee on what happens if somebody sends a letter out threatening action against an individual, a taxpayer or somebody helping the taxpayer comply with the law, but I have got to say, you should not have to--you say, oh, yes, Senator, we are going to go back to the office and we are going to check on that one. I do not know what additional authority you need. It troubles me. I just will take this right up the food chain to Mr. Rossotti. It seems to me that we have got to take immediate action when something like that happens and people have to know, as we do in other areas of the law, that you are going to pay a penalty for doing it, otherwise it continues. I mean, that is the problem with lax enforcement of any law, is it encourages other people to say, well, there is no punishment, there is no penalty, why worry about it? I would like for you to comment, rather, on the specific provisions. You are saying you have identified a number of things. The IRS does not refer complaints about high-level employees, the IRS has been slow in taking administrative action, the IG views some adjudicative actions taken by the IRS against high-level employees as weak decisions, and so on. In the legislation, both the House and Senate legislation, we significantly change the power and authorities of the Inspector General. We shift over to Treasury, first of all, and make the IG independent. I wonder if you would comment on the legislation itself. I presume you have reviewed the legislation, both that as passed by the House and strengthened by this committee, and I wonder if you would comment as to whether or not the proposed change in the law that this committee is looking at will solve the problems you are identifying. If not, what additional suggestions would you make to this committee when we take it up on the floor? Mr. Patsalides. I would make a personal observation. The proposed legislation that I viewed calls for two independent Office of Inspector Generals within the Treasury Department. I believe that that is not necessary. I believe that one Office of Inspector General within the Treasury Department, one independent IG overseeing all the bureaus including IRS, is more workable. The problem is that if that was proposed, we would need the sufficient resources to be able to oversee the operations of IRS. Senator Kerrey. Under the bill that was passed out by this committee, the Treasury IG has all the current responsibilities, but in addition it would assume all the duties and responsibility currently delegated at the IRS Office of Chief Inspector. Is that adequate? Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, I believe so. I am not familiar with that. Senator Kerrey. Well, I would appreciate it if you would review that because we are about to change the law. One of the things that is awfully difficult in solving problems, is if we do not connect the problem with the law, again, I emphasize the IRS is not Sears and Roebuck. We are not talking about a private sector entity here, we are talking about an agency that grows from the law. We have to pay attention to how we write that law and pay attention to the circumstances that you are identifying here and try to change it by changing the law. Again, in parentheses, some of the stuff the law cannot provide for. I should not need a law that says that somebody gets terminated if they write a letter out threatening a citizen as a consequence of something he said publicly. I mean, if we have to have a law for that, we have got trouble. I should not have to have you go back and check it out and see what you are going to do about it. Mr. Patsalides. The other situation was brought to our attention as a result of this meeting. Senator Kerrey. I appreciate that. But there are a lot of things---- Mr. Patsalides. We do not have that kind of oversight over IRS when they do their investigations. That is one of the problems right now, they do their own investigations. We do not have sufficient resources to oversee everything they do. Senator Kerrey. I appreciate that. I do not think you have a sufficient amount of authority, I think you need to be independent, I think you need to be in Treasury, I think the issue of resources is important. What I am saying is, even without resources judgments have to be made about what people are doing, whether they are right or wrong. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Kerrey. It seems to me that if I have got evidence that somebody has sent a letter out threatening a taxpayer or somebody that is helping them prepare their taxes, I do not need a law to tell me that is wrong and they ought to be terminated. I mean, if you need a law for that, it seems to me that we are never going to get where we want to go. Mr. Patsalides. I agree, sir. Senator Kerrey. If you have got to go back and check that all out and come back to us---- Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Kerrey. If somebody steals 20 cars, somebody sexually harasses employees, should not be promoted to be in charge of EEO for the whole agency. Mr. Patsalides. We certainly agree. Senator Kerrey. So why does it happen? Why do you get to this point where you are coming here and saying sort of lamely that we will go back and check it out? Mr. Calahan. Senator, could I make a clarifying point? Our office typically investigates grade 15s and up, higher level employees. Senator Kerrey. Yes. Mr. Calahan. I believe that the employee involved in this matter was not at that level, and so I do not think we became aware of that issue until it was brought to our attention. Senator Kerrey. Well, I appreciate that. My red light is on and I will take up some of the personal items in the second round. But I hope you will review the legislation and tell us whether or not the problems you are identifying will be solved by the bill that was reported out by this committee. I think it does, by the way. As I hear your testimony, I think in both cases the problems are going to be solved. But please pay attention to the law, because I think it matters a great deal. Mr. Calahan. We would really be happy to provide you comments on the new bill. Senator Kerrey. Thank you. The Chairman. Mr. Kerrey's time is up. Mr. Breaux has to leave to make a speech. I would just make one observation. Obviously, what we write into the law in addressing these problems are of critical importance. I would also note that I think they make clear the importance of management changes as well. It is not just a matter of revising the law, but assuring that there are people who will faithfully pursue the law as it is written. With that, I would like to call on Senator Nickles. Senator Nickles. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Again, these hearings are kind of shocking. Correct me if I am wrong. I did not catch all these stories. But one individual was responsible for stealing 20 cars and he is still an IRS employee; did I hear that correctly? Mr. Patsalides. No, sir. He is no longer an IRS employee. Senator Nickles. Was he fired or did he retire? Mr. Patsalides. I believe he retired or left, resigned, before termination. Senator Nickles. Any criminal penalties whatsoever? Mr. Patsalides. That was the issue where the person received a deferred prosecution and was placed on two years' probation and had to repay the government the $20,000. Senator Nickles. Twenty thousand dollars. Most cars, that is pretty light. His restitution was $20,000 and he stole 20 cars? Mr. Patsalides. The person may not have stolen all 20 cars. It was documented that he misappropriated at least two or three of the vehicles. But, because of the inadequate controls of that office, they could not determine the disposition of the other vehicles under his control. Senator Nickles. That is pathetic. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir, it is. Senator Nickles. An 18-year-old steals a car in Washington, DC could go to jail for years. And I do not want to paint all of our IRS employees with the same brush that implies that, but that is criminal conduct. To get off with 2 years' probation and to pay $20,000 restitution when you may have 20 cars that were stolen, is just a pat on the back. That is embarrassing. Mr. Patsalides. Those issues were handled in the courts and not by the agency, either IRS or the Treasury OIG. They were adjudicated by the Department of Justice, and that was the end result. Senator Nickles. By the U.S. Attorney. Mr. Patsalides. Yes, sir. Senator Nickles. Or Assistant "
