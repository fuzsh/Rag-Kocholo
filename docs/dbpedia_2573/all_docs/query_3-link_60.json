        "text": "The bipartisan Local Government Commission (LGC) on Tuesday afternoon approved $186 million in limited obligation bonds (LOBs) for Cabarrus County to pay for costs of multiple general government projects, including the new courthouse, R. Brown McAllister Elementary School and EMS headquarters, through bond anticipation notes (BANs).\n\nProceeds of the fixed-rate bonds will pay off BANs previously issued at a variable rate and pay for additional project costs. BANs are short-term securities issued to pay for upcoming projects in advance of a larger future bond issue.\n\nThe commission approved the $186 million in LOBs in a 7-1 vote, though several members of the LGC, which provides financial oversight for all municipalities across the state, expressed concerns with the county continuing to finance large-scale projects with LOBs rather than general obligation bonds (GOBs), which require voter referendums.\n\nState Treasurer Dale Folwell, chair of the LGC and the lone no vote, was still concerned that the commission did not take up the motion to approve the LOBs during its July meeting.\n\n“I’ve never had something fail for a lack of a motion as it did in our last meeting,” Folwell said. His “no” vote is not a protest vote but “to send a signal ... that the people in Cabarrus County need to know that the folks of the LGC are listening.”\n\nFolwell encouraged the county to listen to the LGC and heed their advice to consider switching to GOBs. “I hope that you’ll take their advice and try to do things in a less complicated, simper way in Cabarrus County as you go forward,” Folwell said.\n\nCounty criticized\n\nState Auditor Jessica Holmes was also critical of how the county has been financing large projects. Although she voted in support of LOBs, “I am still not convinced that using limited obligation bonds in this instance is the best policy as opposed to general obligation bonds,” she said.\n\n“I do not believe this (LOBs) is the most transparent of means, nor is it good government in terms of the lack of engagement process that would be required to put a bond on the ballet,” Holmes added.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSeveral Cabarrus residents have supported GOBs, which require bond referendums, so the public has more influence when it comes to key projects.\n\nDuring the previous LGC meeting on July 9, the commission did not approve either the $186 million in LOBs or $42 million to purchase the ACN building in Concord, which will be used as a new human services facility. This led to a heated Board of Commissioners meeting on July 16, where Commissioner Chris Measmer said it was “embarrassing for me as a Cabarrus County representative” that the commission denied both projects.\n\nDuring the July 9 meeting, the LGC noted that most other municipalities don’t rely exclusively on LOB draw programs featuring BANs. Other large counties and municipalities may use draw programs, but they do so with general obligation bonds (GOBs) that have already received public approval through bond referendums.\n\nMarshall offended by Pittman\n\nSecretary of State Elaine Marshall told Commissioner Chair Steve Morris she was offended at being called a “crook” during the July 16 Cabarrus County Board of Commissioners’ meeting.\n\n“Disparaging the members of this council who try to do their work don’t deserve that kind of treatment,” Marshall said.\n\nDuring the July 16 meeting, Larry Pittman, a former Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives who is running for a seat on the county commission in November, said he considered Marshall to be “one of the most corrupt people in our state government,” during a public hearing, though he did not offer any specifics. Neither Pittman nor anyone else specifically referred to Marshall as a “crook.”\n\nMorris apologized to Marshall on behalf of “certain residents of Cabarrus County.” Morris told the LGC that he found the comments and dialogue during the July 16 meeting “insulting to the integrity of not only the members of this board but of Cabarrus County and certainly myself included.”\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nChristopher Miller\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
