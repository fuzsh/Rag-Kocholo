        "meta_description": "Roger Dale Brown's art education has consisted of countless hours studying historical artists such as John Carlson, Arthur Streeton, Isaac Levitan and John Singer Sargent and concentrated his study with master teachers over the years. Roger has developed his own style which draws deeply from the Impressionist view that painting from life is essential. This determination and dedication has culminated in his receiving Master Status with three top painting organizations in one year. The organization's who recognized him are Oil Painters of America, American Impressionist Society, and American Society of Marine Artists.Â Roger's oil paintings hand in the permanent collections of Tennessee State Museum and other museums throughout the United States and are held in several prominent galleries around the country. Roger has been published by International Artist Magazine, American Artist Magazine, American Art Collector Magazine, Plein-Air Magazine and the Artist Magazine.",
