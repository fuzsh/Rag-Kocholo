        "text": "Victim(s) Convicted Location Disappeared Conviction date Description William Harrison John, Richard and Joan Perry Chipping Campden, England August 16, 1660 Spring 1661 A wealthy 70-year-old man last seen walking to Charingworth. After his hat, coat and neckband were found on the side of the road with a sharp cut and sprinkled in blood, his servant John Perry claimed that Perry's own brother and mother had murdered Harrison to rob him, and subsequently dumped the body in a pond. The pond was drained but no body was found. The Perrys then alternated between pleading guilt and innocence, until they were all found guilty and hanged. However, Harrison reappeared in 1662, claiming to have been abducted by Barbary pirates. It has been said that this case was the source of a mistaken view that without a body there could be no trial for murder in England.[40] William Moore William Kidd Indian Ocean October 30, 1697 May 23, 1701 Privateer's gunner murdered at sea after making a disrespectful remark to Kidd, his captain. John Davidson Thomas Davidson Hanwell, London, England December 1933 September 1934 The eight-year-old son of the convict, who confessed to drowning him and burning his body on a rubbish tip.

Three accused were acquitted at trial while the others were variously sentenced to death or imprisonment. Gay Gibson James Camb Atlantic Ocean, west coast of Africa October 18, 1947 March 22, 1948 An actress who was on an ocean liner, the MV Durban Castle, when her dead body was pushed through the porthole of her cabin. According to James Camb, the man convicted of killing her, she died during consensual sex and in a panic he pushed her body through the porthole. He always denied killing her. William, Donald and Amy McSwann; Archibald and Rosalie Henderson; Olive Durand-Deacon John George Haigh London September 9, 1944 – February 19, 1949 August 10, 1949 Victims of con artist and serial killer John George Haigh, who dissolved the bodies in acid under the belief that he couldn't be prosecuted for murder without a corpse; the resulting liquified remains were disposed of in a manhole. There was ample documentary evidence tying him to his victims, however, and a search found remains of human fat, three gallstones and a couple of dentures in the vat he had used to dissolve the body of his last victim. Stanislaw Sykut Michail Onufrejczyk Llandeilo, Wales December 14, 1953 August 1954 Partner of the convict in the management of a farm rehabilitated by the Polish Resettlement Corps after World War II. Onufrejczyk, who had been previously denounced by Sykut for violence and was about to lose the farm as a result of legal action, offered wildly varying stories to explain his partner's sudden disappearance. He was convicted largely because of the finding of over 2000 blood stains in the passage leading from the farm's kitchen to the backyard, which Onufrejczyk claimed to be from rabbits he had skinned, but which were confirmed by tests to be human blood. Police believed that Onufrejczyk dismembered Sykut's body in the kitchen and fed the parts to the pigs. The ruling was cited as a precedent in later murder without a body cases in England and Wales.[43] Malika Maria de Fernandez Peter Reyn-Bardt Wilmslow, England June 1961 December 1983 The estranged wife of the convict. When the bog body later known as the Lindow Woman was found in a bog behind his home in 1983, police questioned Reyn-Bardt, whose wife had been missing for over two decades. Reyn-Bardt, also believing that the partial body was that of his wife, admitted to have murdered her when she blackmailed him under threat of revealing his homosexuality. Afterward, he dismembered the body and buried the pieces in a trench leading to the bog. Carbon 14 dating later showed that the body was nearly 1,800 years old. While Malika's own body was not found, the detailed confession was enough to pronounce her husband guilty.[44] John Smith William Taylor Thorburn Cardiff, Wales June 17, 1964 May 4, 1966 Thorburn was convicted of the killing of 52-year-old John Smith after pleading guilty and stating that he had killed him for having an affair with his wife.

Initially, police investigated the possibility that Causley murdered his wife, but closed the investigation when sufficient evidence was not forthcoming. Years later, when Causley was discovered to have faked his own death in an attempted life insurance scheme, police reopened the investigation, which led to Causley's first conviction.[57] Packman's disappearance became the subject of the 2016 television series The Investigator: A British Crime Story.[58] Helen McCourt Ian Simms Billinge, Merseyside, England February 9, 1988 March 1989 A 22-year-old woman last seen walking towards the pub owned by the convict, who had previously made rejected advances on her, and had also banned her from the pub after she had an argument with another patron.
