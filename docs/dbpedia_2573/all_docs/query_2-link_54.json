        "text": "Former LSU basketball coach Dale Brown had some bitter battles with Kentucky during his legendary 25-year career that included two Final Four berths but probably respects UK basketball as much as any coach who competed against UK.\n\nâI liked Sam Bowie a great deal,â said Brown, who won 448 games at LSU and made 10 straight NCAA Tournaments from 1984-93. âBut they had so many great players, and we were so far behind them when I first started.Â The average loss at Kentucky for LSU was like 25 or 26 points when I took over.â\n\nHe said former UK All-American Kyle Macy was always a âthorn in our sideâ but still vividly remembers a game UK won because a foul was not called on Bowie.\n\nâWe had won 17 league games in a row and had one game left at Kentucky. We called a timeout to set up a shot for Howard Carter on the last play to win the game,â the former LSU coach recalled. âHoward went up for a shot, and he could really shoot, and Sam Bowie came over and fouled him and the ref did not blow the whistle.â\n\nYears later Brown was at an event with Bowie when the coach asked Bowie if he did indeed foul Carter.\n\nâHe said, âYes I fouled him twice. I hit him in the head and then on the arm. I thought for sure the foul would be called.â But Sam was a sweetheart and gentleman so you couldnât be mad at him.â\n\nBrown admits his favorite Kentucky was Kenny âSkyâ Walker.\n\nâHe always played his heart out. We had a great game with them for the right to go to the Final Four (in 1986) after they beat us three times during the season,â Brown said. âWe beat them and I saw he had tears in his eyes after the game, so I gave him a big hug because he played great. Kentucky probably would have won the national championship that year if we had not beat them.â"
