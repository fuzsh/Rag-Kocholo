        "text": "Dale Brown was born on December 24, 1954, in Baltimore, Maryland. Her mother was a teacher, and her father worked for Afro-American magazine. Dale completed high school in 1972 and went on to attend Coppin State College in Baltimore. She earned a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1972. In 1981 Dale completed a doctorate in microbiology from Georgetown University School of Medicine. The same year she married Philip Emeagwali.\n\nEmeagwali worked as a research scientist at a number of institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, the University of Wyoming, University of Michigan, and University of Minnesota from 1978 until 1996. In 1986 her research uncovered a bacteria that produced a certain enzyme. This was important because it was thought that the enzyme could be produced only by higher organisms. The discovery led to bacteria being considered a complex organism. Emeagwali also found a way to stop or slow down the growth of cancer cells. This finding opened a new path for cancer treatment.\n\nIn 1996 Emeagwali was awarded the Scientist of the Year Award from the United State’s National Technical Association. The award recognizes scientists whose discoveries have helped humankind."
