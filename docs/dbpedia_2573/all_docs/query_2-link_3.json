        "text": "Retired basketball coach Dale Brown has been serving up grand slam programs to audiences throughout the world. As a professional speaker, he works with organizations that want to achieve success and inspire a winning attitude towards work and towards life. Dale Brown is recognized as one of the most accomplished and gifted speakers in the world and his gift for motivating both teams and individuals is legendary. As a basketball coach at Louisiana State University for 25 years (1972-1997), he appeared in 15 straight national tournaments and is the second winningest coach in SEC history behind Kentucky's Adolph Rupp. He led teams to 17 consecutive non-losing seasons. Only three coaches have won more conference championships than Coach Brown and he has won conference championships in three different decades. He has led his teams to two Final Fours and four Elite Eights. He was named SEC Coach of the Year or runner-up nine times and was twice named National Basketball Coach of the Year.\n\nSince Coach Brown's retirement from LSU in 1997, he has become a successful author, traveled the world as a speaker and is the creator of a syndicated radio program, Motivational Moments on NPR. He has also served as a college basketball analyst for ESPN and ABC. He is currently CEO of Dale Brown Enterprises and the Dale Brown Foundation. His speeches before hundreds of corporations have earned him the title of \"America's Greatest Motivator\" and he has been rated by many as \"The best in his field.\" He is a fiery competitor and he knows the exhilaration that comes from winning. His philosophy is based upon winning, leadership, conviction and personal growth, whether it is a small company, a giant corporation, a group of athletes or a single individual.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Brown appeared on the ABC show Shaq's Big Challenge to offer words of encouragement to Shaquille O'Neal about helping obese children. He also was an advisor to Matthew McConaughey, who played the role of a coach in the movie We Are Marshall.\n\nDuring Brown's era basketball rose to a level that no one could have ever possibly imagined. LSU holds the record for the second, third, and fourth largest paid attendance for a regular season game in college basketball history."
