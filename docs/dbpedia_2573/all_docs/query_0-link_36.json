        "text": "An investor needs to know their investment objectives and understand the risks that come with a precious metals investment. Precious metals are commodities, and like other commodities, their price can fluctuate dramatically. While there may be room in a diversified portfolio for precious metals, investors should consider several factors to determine if precious metals fit their investment objectives.\n\nThe stress of financial fraud can be life altering, especially for those in their retirement years. Losing money in an online investment fraud or financial scheme can severely affect your physical, mental, and social health. To avoid online scams, it is important to keep track of the internet services, subscriptions, and passwords you are using. This investor advisory explains how you can take a proactive role in staying more secure online.\n\nYour financial firm may request that you give them the name and contact information of a “trusted contact.” While it is not mandatory that you do so, state securities regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and FINRA encourage you to consider providing the name of someone you trust as a contact on your accounts.\n\nDating apps and social media platforms have become popular ways to meet new people, but be cautious if someone turns an online romance into an opportunity to solicit an investment or asks to borrow money. Scammers are increasingly posing as potential romantic partners to lure people into fraudulent investment schemes. This advisory discusses common tactics used in investment-related romance scams and what you can do to protect yourself.\n\nOne of the best ways to build wealth is by saving and investing over a long period of time. The earlier you start, the easier it is for your money to grow. Opening your first investment account is a key step in beginning your investment journey. Here are some important investment tips from the North Dakota Securities Department to consider when opening any investment account.\n\nWith advances in technology including more enhanced digital experiences that blur the line between the physical and digital worlds, the future has arrived in the form of the “metaverse.” A series of virtual worlds, the metaverse is the latest technology that offers new ways to interact and collaborate, and with that, new ways to perpetrate financial scams and investment fraud. This alert highlights some current metaverse investment scams and provides tips for investors to protect themselves.\n\nWith stock market volatility dominating Main Street news headlines since early 2020, interest in investing has seen a dramatic increase. According to Bloomberg News, downloads of investment apps rose by 20% in 2021 from the year prior while actual time spent on these apps jumped by 90%. Most Millennials and Gen Z-ers are using social media sources for information about investing rather than relying on more traditional sources of investing information such as brokerage or investment advisory firms, or regulatory agencies.\n\nInfluencers have taken notice, and social media has become more saturated with financial content than ever before, leading to the rise of the financial influencer, or “finfluencer.” Viral videos claiming that an investment opportunity will “go to the moon this year!” have proliferated, as have social media postings promoting easy plans for paying off your house, car, or student loan debt using language such as “Five easy tricks to financial freedom.”\n\nThis investor advisory explains what financial influencers are, how they are compensated, what you should keep in mind when you are exposed to financial influencers’ content, red flags to watch out for, and resources available to you.\n\nWith interest rates on the rise, more investors may be considering an investment in bonds or bond funds, and in researching alternatives or talking to a financial adviser, may have come across bond credit ratings. Credit ratings usually appear in the form of alphabetical letter grades (for example, ‘AAA’ and ‘BBB’) and are an estimate of the relative level of credit risk of a bond, company or government. Credit ratings are issued by third parties and are not an assessment by the issuer of the bond or by securities regulators.\n\nCredit ratings can be useful when evaluating an investment. But when considering credit ratings, you should understand their limitations. You should not base your investment decision solely on a credit rating or treat a credit rating as if it were investment advice.\n\nDon't get swept away by a romance scam.\n\nDating apps and social media platforms may be a popular way to meet new people, but be cautious if someone turns an online romance into an opportunity to solicit an investment or asks to borrow money. Scammers are increasingly posing as potential romantic partners to lure people into fraudulent investment schemes. This alert discusses common tactics fraudsters use in investment-related romance scams and gives you steps to take to protect yourself from these schemes.\n\nIn our digitally connected world, some investors turn to online chatrooms and social media platforms for information about investing or specific investment opportunities. And with today’s trading technology, it’s easy to go from zero to invested in a matter of minutes. Phone apps can turn inexperienced investors into day traders, and online investment chat forums make it easy to use these sources for investment advice rather than relying on the services of a registered investment professional. While ever-evolving financial technology innovation makes investing more accessible to greater numbers of people, investors must understand the risks created when financial innovation and social media intersect.\n\nThe relationship you have with your investment professional is a key element to meeting your long-term financial goals.\n\nIf your stockbroker or investment adviser representative leaves his or her employer, you should make sure that you understand how and why it happened. It could be as simple as a move to another city or retirement, but there could be other reasons too. It is critical to find out what happened before deciding who will help you with your investments going forward. After all, it’s your money and your financial future.\n\nMutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) offer investors a cost-efficient way to invest in professionally managed portfolios of securities. While it is often tempting to make a purchase based on a fund’s historical performance, informed investors know that past performance is no guarantee of future performance, and that they must review a fund’s prospectus, shareholder reports and portfolio holdings to see if the fund’s risk/return profile aligns with theirs. An informed investor will pay particular attention to a fund’s expense ratio, which, over time, can eat into a fund’s earnings significantly.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (May 8, 2020) – The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) today announced the availability of a new publication designed to improve the quality of franchise disclosures.\n\nThe 366-page Franchise Disclosure Document Handbook: A Resource Guide for Preparing a Franchise Disclosure Document is a compilation of the various rules, commentaries, and guidance from the Federal Trade Commission and NASAA governing the preparation of Franchise Disclosure Documents.\n\nEMERGENCY NOTICE No. 2020-03 | April 2, 2020\n\nTemporary Relief from Notary Attestation for Registrants and Other Filers Affected by the COVID-19 Outbreak Granted by the Commissioner under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-03(2)\n\nThe North Dakota Securities Commissioner understands that registrants and other filers may not be able to obtain notary attestation at this time.\n\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, a series of legislative provisions intended to facilitate capital formation in the United States, was signed into law in 2012. This legislation included the CROWDFUND Act, which made significant changes to current federal and state securities laws. The CROWDFUND Act allows entrepreneurs to raise capital by offering to sell interests in their businesses over the Internet. Under the CROWDFUND Act, a small business is allowed to raise $1 million in a 12-month period by selling its securities to investors without registering that offering with federal or state securities regulators. However, the Act places limitations on how and to whom a small business can sell its securities. In May 2106, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules to implement this new exemption to allow securities sales through crowdfunding.\n\nThe Internet has become an inexpensive and easy way for individuals and businesses to raise money. In 2012, Congress passed the JOBS Act, which directed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to formulate rules to exempt equity crowdfunding from the securities registration laws. These rules went into effect in May, 2016 and removed restrictions on start-up companies that use the internet to find investors.\n\nA pension is a type of retirement plan, usually tax-exempt, in which an employee makes contributions toward a pool of funds set aside for an employee’s future benefit. The pool of funds is invested on the employee’s behalf, allowing the employee to receive benefits upon retirement.\n\nAre you earning a pension from your employer and need cash fast?\n\nAre you an investor looking for new ways to grow your investment dollars?\n\nIf you answer yes to either question, you may be the target of a new wrinkle on an old type of scam.\n\nVictims of investment scams are wise to use caution if approached by companies promising to help them recover their lost investment funds and bring the perpetrators to \"justice.\" A third-party asset recovery company is a company that charges a fee to assist individuals in recovering money lost in scams. The company claims to gather information on the scam and assist the individual in recovering lost investment dollars. Many of these self-proclaimed recovery companies are not law firms, although they may advertise that they can provide legal assistance. Typically, the targeted investors have lost thousands of dollars, perhaps even their entire life's savings, to fraudulent investment schemes.\n\nAt first glance, marijuana, binary options, and digital currency appear to have no real connection to one another. But what they all have in common is their recent emergence as three investments that both sellers and buyers hope will become the \"next big thing.\" Before you consider investing, make sure you understand what these products are, their benefits, and their risks.\n\nFinancial professional titles and licenses are not the same. A financial professional may use various titles whether or not he or she is registered or licensed with a regulatory authority. Financial professionals that are registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser have obtained registrations and licenses granted by federal or state regulatory authorities. Working with a financial professional who is registered with or licensed by federal or state authorities affords you certain legal protections.\n\nWith energy demands and a desire for energy independence increasing globally, investments in traditional and alternative energy resources are being promoted more often and are becoming attractive to more investors. Some examples include: wind turbines, solar panels, biodiesel, ethanol, coal, oil, gas, hydrogen, wave, geothermal, oil sands, and liquefied natural gas. Many of these investments are highly risky and are usually not appropriate for all investors. It is not unusual for unscrupulous promoters to follow the headlines and take advantage of unsuspecting investors by engaging in fraudulent practices.\n\nPromoters sometimes prey on investors interested in socially responsible products by labeling them as “green energy” investment opportunities. The phrase “green energy” implies that the products are ecologically friendly when in fact the promoters may be operating a fraudulent shell company and not producing anything.\n\nWhether you are just starting a retirement fund or need additional help with growing and managing your money, you may benefit from selecting an investment services professional. Finding a person who is knowledgeable, affordable, and trustworthy may be a challenging process. This advisory provides basic information on three types of financial services professionals and their obligations to you as a client: broker-dealer agents, investment adviser representatives, and financial planners. An individual professional can hold any of these three credentials or titles, among others.\n\nThe Internet has become an inexpensive and easy way for individuals and businesses to raise money for their activities. Congress recently passed the JOBS Act, which directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create rules exempting crowdfunding from the securities registration laws. Once implemented these rules will remove restrictions on start-up companies seeking investors over the Internet. Investors should be on the lookout for unscrupulous issuers and intermediaries who may attempt to engage in crowdfunding before the rules are written or misuse crowdfunding to steal from investors through false and misleading representations.\n\nHistorically speaking, the value of gold-related investments fluctuates even more than the stock market. Gold often moves in reverse of stocks and bonds, so when stocks are down, gold seems like a very tempting investment. Before jumping onto the gold bandwagon, there are a few things you might want to consider.\n\nSocial Networking in the Internet age allows people to connect to one another more quickly and easily than ever before. Investment promoters increasingly are logging on to find investors...and their money.\n\nBefore investing through a social network, ask yourself these questions: Have I verified that the promoter is legitimate? Do I understand the risks of the investment?"
