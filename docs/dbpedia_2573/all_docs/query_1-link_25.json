Brokers and advisors can only charge reasonable fees, and they are prohibited from giving misleading information.\n\nWhile compliance with the full extent of the rule’s warranty and disclosure requirements has been delayed until July of 2019, any recommendation to roll 401(k) assets into an IRA is considered a fiduciary act, and must be done in an investor’s best interest.\n\n(http://www.benefitspro.com)\n\nFSI Says Its Lobbying Efforts Are Helping Shape Fiduciary Rule\n\nFinancial Advisor; January 30, 2018\n\nThe Financial Services Institute’s proposal for streamlined, simplified conflict of interest disclosure appears to be making its way into the SEC's best interest proposal.\n\n“Earlier this year we had meetings with [SEC] Chairman Jay Clayton and [SEC Director of the Division of Trading and Markets] Brett Redfearn and we are ... hearing that many of our themes that we’ve hit on in our advocacy” are starting to find their way into the proposal, FSI President Dale Brown told reporters at the FSI One Voice Conference in Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nFSI represents independent broker-dealers and their affiliated advisors.\n\nAccording to Brown, provisions in an early draft of the proposal include:\n\nShort-form disclosure of conflicts of interest and compensation methods at the outset of engagement with clients.\n\nAn SEC template that all firms and practitioners could use for disclosure.\n\nA clearly articulated, single, best interest of care."
