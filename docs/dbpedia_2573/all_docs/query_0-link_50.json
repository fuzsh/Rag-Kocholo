These efforts culminated in the January 6 Capitol attack by Trump supporters, which was widely described as an attempted coup d'état.[20][21][22][23] One week later, Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection but was acquitted by the Senate by a vote of 57–43 in favour of conviction, 10 votes short of the 67 votes (two-thirds of the Senate) required to convict him.\n\nTrump and his allies used the \"big lie\" propaganda technique to promote numerous false claims and conspiracy theories asserting that the election was stolen by means of rigged voting machines, electoral fraud and an international communist conspiracy.[b] Trump pressed Department of Justice leaders to challenge the election results and publicly state the election was corrupt.[33][34][35] However, the attorney general, the director of National Intelligence, and the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency – as well as some Trump campaign staff – dismissed these claims. State and federal judges, election officials, and state governors also determined that the claims were baseless.[36][37][38][39]\n\nTrump loyalists, including Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and several Republican lawmakers from the House Freedom Caucus, attempted to keep Trump in power. At the state level, their tactics targeted state legislatures with the intent of changing the results or delaying the electoral vote certification at the Capitol.[40] At the national level, they promoted the idea that Vice President Mike Pence could refuse to certify the election results on January 6, 2021. Consequently, hundreds of elected Republicans, including members of Congress and governors, have refused to acknowledge Biden's victory;[41] a few have since decided to acknowledge it.[42][43]\n\nTrump's legal team sought a path to bring a case before the Supreme Court, but none of the 63 lawsuits they filed were successful.[44][45][46][47] They especially pinned their hopes on Texas v. Pennsylvania, but on December 11, 2020, the Supreme Court declined to hear that case.[48] After that, Trump reportedly considered multiple ways to remain in power, including military intervention, seizing voting machines, and another appeal to the Supreme Court.[49][50][51]\n\nIn June 2022, the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack said it had enough evidence to recommend that the Department of Justice indict Trump,[52] and on December 19, the committee formally made the criminal referral to the Justice Department.[53] On August 1, 2023, Trump was indicted by a D.C. grand jury for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights;[54] he pleaded not guilty to all four charges.[55] On August 14, Trump and 18 co-defendants, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro, and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, were indicted in Fulton County, Georgia for their efforts to overturn the election results in that state.[56][57] Ten leaders of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups have been convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the Capitol attack.[58]\n\nTrump continues to insist that the election was stolen,[59] telling a group of historians in mid-2021 that the election was \"rigged and lost\",[60] and publicly stating in August 2022 that he should be declared the president or a new election should be held \"immediately\".[61] As late as 2022, Trump supporters continued their attempts to overturn the election results, pushing for state legislature resolutions and new lawsuits, raising concerns among legal experts that public confidence in democracy is being undermined to lay the groundwork for baselessly challenging future elections.[62]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nTrump's 2012 accusations of electoral fraud\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, in which incumbent president Barack Obama won re-election against Mitt Romney, Donald Trump tweeted that \"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy\", that the election was a \"total sham\", and that the United States was \"not a democracy\".[63]\n\nUncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in 2016\n\n[edit]\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the election is \"rigged\" against him, and in the final debate he cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of the election should he lose, saying \"I'll keep you in suspense\".[64] His comment touched off a media and political uproar, in which he was accused of \"threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy\" and \"rais(ing) the prospect that millions of his supporters may not accept the results on Nov. 8 if he loses\".[65] Rick Hasen of University of California, Irvine School of Law, an election-law expert, described Trump's comments as \"appalling and unprecedented\" and feared there could be \"violence in the streets from his supporters if Trump loses.\"[66] The next day Trump said, \"Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.\" He also stated that he would \"totally\" accept the election results \"if I win.\"[67]\n\nUncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in 2020\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him.[68][69][70] In July 2020, Trump declined to state whether he would accept the results, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that \"I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.\"[71][72][73] Trump also proposed delaying the presidential election due to COVID-19, until Americans could vote \"properly, securely and safely\".[74][c]\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed that \"the only way\" he could lose would be if the election was \"rigged\" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[75][76] Trump also criticized mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contained high rates of fraud.[77][78][79] At one point, Trump said: \"We'll see what happens...Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"[80] Trump's statements have been described as a threat \"to upend the constitutional order\".[81] In September 2020, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher A. Wray, a Trump appointee, testified under oath that the FBI has \"not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise\".[82]\n\nA number of congressional Republicans insisted that they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power, but they declined to criticize Trump for his comments.[83] On September 24, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power;[84] however, on October 8 Republican senator Mike Lee tweeted \"We're not a democracy\" and \"Democracy isn't the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity [sic] are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.\"[85] Trump also stated that he expected the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in the event of an election dispute, reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[86]\n\nRefusal to accept 2020 electoral loss\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the months between the election and Inauguration Day (January 20), Trump engaged in multiple efforts to overturn the results. He filed numerous lawsuits, urged local and state authorities to overturn the results in their jurisdiction, pressed the Justice Department to verify unsupported claims of election fraud, and worked with congressional allies to get the results overturned in Congress on January 6.[88]\n\nAt 2 am on Wednesday, November 4, 2020, with the election result still in doubt, Trump held a press conference at the White House in which he stated: \"This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\"[89] At 9 am on Thursday, November 5, 2020, Trump tweeted \"STOP THE COUNT!\"[90] However, at that time Biden was already leading in enough states such that stopping the count would have resulted in a Biden victory.[90][91] After all major news organizations declared Biden the President-elect on November 7,[92] Trump refused to accept his loss, declaring \"this election is far from over\" and alleging election fraud without providing evidence.[93] Privately, according to reporting by Maggie Haberman, he told one aide \"I'm just not going to leave\", and he told another aide, \"We're never leaving. How can you leave when you won an election?\".[94]\n\nHe indicated that he would continue legal challenges in key states,[93] but all of the challenges were dismissed by the courts.[95][96][97] His legal team, led by Rudy Giuliani, made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines and polling place fraud to claim that the election had been stolen from Trump.[27][30][31][d] Trump blocked government officials from cooperating in the presidential transition to Joe Biden.[99] Attorney General William Barr authorized the Justice Department to initiate investigations \"if there are clear and apparently credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state\".[100]\n\nTrump and his allies encouraged state officials to throw out legally cast ballots, challenge vote-certification processes, and overturn certified election results.[101][102][103] In an early January 2021 phone call, he pressed the Georgia secretary of state to \"find\" the 11,780 votes needed to secure his victory in the state.[104] He repeatedly urged Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to convene a special session of the legislature to overturn Biden's certified victory in the state, and he made a similar plea to the Pennsylvania Speaker of the House.[19][105][106][107] On a conference call, he asked 300 Republican state legislators to seek ways to reverse certified election results in their states.[108] Republican officials in seven states, directed by Trump's personal attorney, created fraudulent electoral certificates of ascertainment to falsely assert Trump had been reelected.[109][110][111]\n\nBy December 30, 2020, multiple Republican members of the House and Senate indicated they would try to force both chambers to debate whether to certify the Electoral College results.[112][113][114] Mike Pence, who as vice president would preside over the proceedings, signaled his endorsement of the effort, stating on January 4, \"I promise you, come this Wednesday, we will have our day in Congress\". Additionally, Trump and some supporters promoted a false \"Pence card\" theory that, even if Congress were to certify the results, the vice president had the authority to reject them.[115][116][117]\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that he really won the 2020 election. He reportedly dislikes the term \"former president\", and his official statements refer to him as \"the 45th President\" or simply as \"45\", as on his new website, www.45office.com.[118] During his public speeches, he insists that massive election fraud caused his loss, saying, \"This was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century\"[119] and \"We won the election twice [2016 and 2020] and it's possible we'll have to win it a third time [2024].\"[120]\n\nIn a September 2023 interview with Kristen Welker for NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said, regarding the attorneys who told him he lost the election, that he \"didn't respect them as lawyers\" but \"did respect others\" who told him he won. He said that, ultimately, his effort to overturn the election results \"was my decision.\" He maintained: \"I say I won the election.\"[121]\n\nStop the Steal\n\n[edit]\n\nStop the Steal is a far-right and conservative campaign and protest movement in the United States promoting the conspiracy theory[122] that falsely[123] posits that widespread electoral fraud occurred during the 2020 presidential election to deny incumbent president Donald Trump victory over former vice president Joe Biden. Trump and his supporters have asserted, without evidence,[124][125] that he is the winner of the election, and that large-scale voter and vote counting fraud took place in several swing states.[125] The Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Decision Desk HQ, NBC News, The New York Times, and Fox News projected Biden as the president-elect, having surpassed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to claim victory.[6][126] A New York Times survey of state election officials found no evidence of significant voting fraud, nor did the Justice Department, and dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his proxies to challenge voting results in several states failed.[37][127][128][129]\n\n\"Stop the Steal\" was created by Republican political operative Roger Stone in 2016,[130] in anticipation of potential future election losses that could be portrayed as stolen by alleged fraud. A Facebook group with that name was created during the 2020 counting of votes by pro-Trump group \"Women for America First\" co-founder and Tea Party movement activist Amy Kremer.[131] Facebook removed the group on November 5, describing it as \"organized around the delegitimization of the election process\".[131][132] It was reported to have been adding 1,000 new members every 10 seconds[133] with 360,000 followers before Facebook shut it down.[134][135] Some \"Stop the Steal\" Facebook groups had discussed extreme violence, incitement to violence and other threats.[136][137] CounterAction, a social media analytics firm, provided ProPublica and the Washington Post an audit of Facebook groups and posts which identified 650,000 election delegitimization posts leading up to January 6.[138][139] On January 11, 2021, Facebook announced that it would remove content containing the phrase \"stop the steal\" from Facebook and Instagram. On January 12, Twitter announced that it had suspended 70,000 accounts that it said \"share harmful QAnon-associated content at scale\".[141][relevant? – discuss]\n\nSeveral \"Stop the Steal\" groups were founded by right-wing extremists[125] after Trump published tweets on Twitter encouraging his supporters to \"Stop the Count\".[142] Many unorganized \"Stop the Steal\" groups protested in various U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C.;[143] Detroit, Michigan;[144] Lansing, Michigan;[145] Las Vegas, Nevada;[146][147] Madison, Wisconsin;[148] Atlanta, Georgia;[149] and Columbus, Ohio.[150] Several of these protests included members of extremist groups such as Three Percenters, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, which CNN reported was an illustration of \"the thinning of a line between the mainstream right and far-right extremists\".[151]\n\nIn Michigan on December 7, 2020, \"Stop the Steal\" protestors gathered outside the private home of Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to shout obscenities and chant threatening speech into bullhorns. Biden's Michigan win by 154,000 votes had been officially certified by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers in November.[152]\n\nOn December 12, 2020, post-election protests were held in Washington, D.C., in which at least nine people were transported from the protest by D.C. Fire and emergency medical service workers for hospital treatment. Among the injured were four people who suffered stab wounds and were said to be in critical condition. Two police officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and two others suffered minor injuries. An additional 33 people were arrested, including one for assault with a dangerous weapon. Earlier in the day large groups of protesters and counter-protestors assembled outside the Supreme Court and Freedom Plaza.[153]\n\nBy March 2021, organizations linked to the Stop the Steal movement, including the Proud Boys and the boogaloo movement, had largely shifted their efforts to spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines as a way of undermining government credibility.[154][155]\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the U.S. District Court of Minnesota charged self-proclaimed Boogaloo Bois member Michael Paul Dahlager with illegal possession of a machine gun. Dahlager had travelled to the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul for a December 12, 2020, \"Stop the Steal\" rally where he scouted law enforcement positions and numbers. Dahlager had discussed with confidential informants his willingness to kill law enforcement members and incite violent uprisings against the government.[156][157] Dahlager had allegedly planned to carry out an attack in early 2021 on the state's capitol building, but abandoned it after he believed that informants were among his inner circle. Dahlager pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges in July 2021.[158]\n\nIn the days after the election, Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, exchanged 29 text messages with Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to pursue efforts to overturn the election. Thomas asserted \"The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History\" and recited a message circulating in right-wing media that the \"Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators\" were being arrested \"to face military tribunals for sedition\" at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Thomas wrote, \"Do not concede. It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.\" In March 2022, Thomas acknowledged she had attended the January 6 Stop the Steal rally but there was no evidence she had been involved in its organization.[159][160][161]\n\nConspiracy theories\n\n[edit]\n\nMultiple conspiracy theories were promoted, such as the claim that billionaire liberal donor George Soros \"stole the election\".[162] Another is Italygate, a QAnon-adjacent[163][164] theory originating from a fake news website, which claimed that the election was rigged in Biden's favor by the U.S. Embassy in Rome, using satellites and military technology to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. There is no evidence to support this.[163][165] Republican congressman Scott Perry texted White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows a link to a YouTube video making the allegation.[163][166] The New York Times later reported that, during Trump's last weeks in office, Meadows emailed the video to the Department of Justice, seeking an investigation.[167]\n\nThese conspiracy theories had multiple origins. They were promoted by Trump and other individuals, and were heavily pushed and expanded on by far-right news organizations such as One America News Network (OANN), Newsmax, and The Gateway Pundit, as well as by Sean Hannity and some other Fox News commentators.[168][169] RT, a Russian state media outlet, also promoted the Trump campaign's false claims of electoral fraud.[170] Attempts by Facebook and other mainstream social networks to restrict groups that spread false election claims led to a surge in the popularity of Parler, a right-leaning alternative social networking site that has attracted supporters of Stop the Steal.[171][172] Parler subsequently went offline after Amazon Web Services withdrew support for the app on January 9.[173]\n\nAs of June 2021, Trump continued to echo the conspiracy theory that the election was \"stolen\"; particularly focusing on the efforts of Arizona Senate Republicans to audit the results of the election in Maricopa County and on a lawsuit disputing the results of the election in Georgia. The efforts of Arizona Republicans to audit the results have drawn the attention and support of some Republican politicians, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, and the former president. Trump had reportedly told associates he could be \"reinstated\" as president by August 2021; however, there is no constitutional mechanism to reinstate a president after the results of an election have been certified by Congress.[174][175] However, several Trump allies denied reports that Trump would be reinstated as president in August, including Lara Trump, Jenna Ellis, Jason Miller, Corey Lewandowski, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.[176]\n\nThe Gateway Pundit published an August 2021 article reporting analysis conducted by Seth Keshel, a former Army intelligence officer, purporting to prove election fraud and that Trump actually won seven states carried by Biden. The analysis was false. Keshel was among a group of military-intelligence veterans including former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn who played central roles in spreading false information about the election.[177][178][179]\n\nNovember 2020\n\n[edit]\n\nOn at least one occasion in November 2020, Trump privately acknowledged that he lost the election. Alyssa Farah Griffin, a White House aide to Trump, recalls him exclaiming \"Can you believe I lost to this guy?\" while watching Biden on television.[180] This, however, was not Trump's public position.\n\nOn November 12, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs called the election \"the most secure in American history\", leading Trump to fire him[181] and Trump attorney Joseph diGenova to call for his execution.[182][183][184]\n\nEmily Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, delayed the start of the presidential transition until sixteen days after most media outlets had projected Biden to be the winner.[185][186]\n\n\"Fake\" electors\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Trump fake electors plot\n\nOn November 3, Gregory Jacob wrote to Marc Short that it would be undesirable for the public to perceive Vice President Pence as if he had prejudged \"questions concerning disputed electoral votes\".[187]\n\nOn November 4, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows received a text message calling for an \"aggressive strategy\" of having the Republican-led legislatures of three uncalled states \"just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the [Supreme Court]\". This was reportedly sent by Trump's secretary of energy, Rick Perry.[188]\n\nOn November 5, Donald Trump Jr. sent a text message to Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term. Excerpts from the message are:\n\nIt's very simple. We have multiple paths. We control them all. We have operational control. Total leverage. Moral high ground. POTUS must start second term now. Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states. Once again Trump wins. We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021.\n\nBiden had not yet been declared the winner at the time of the text.[189] Trump Jr. testified to the House select committee on May 3, 2022, that he had not written the message and did not recall who had, but that the idea had \"sounded plausible\" and was \"the most sophisticated\" plan he'd heard, although it concerned \"things I don't necessarily, you know, know too much about\".[190]\n\nOn November 9, Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, emailed 29 Arizona lawmakers, including Russell Bowers and Shawnna Bolick, encouraging them to pick \"a clean slate of Electors\" and telling them that the responsibility was \"yours and yours alone\".[191]\n\nOn November 18, James R. Troupis, a lawyer for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, received a memo from Boston attorney Kenneth Chesebro outlining a plan to create and submit alternate slates of electors in contested states.[192] [193]\n\nAnother memo three weeks later went to Wisconsin and several other contested states. The memos are evidence that within weeks of the election, the Trump campaign was focusing on January 6, 2021, as the \"hard deadline\" for determining the outcome of the election.[194]\n\nThe White House Counsel's Office reportedly reviewed the plans to use alternate electors and deemed them not to be legally sound.[195]\n\nLame duck firings and hirings\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter vote counts showed a Biden victory, Trump engaged in what has been called a \"post-election purge\", firing or forcing out at least a dozen officials and replacing them with loyalists.[196] Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was fired by tweet on November 9.[197][198] Undersecretary for Defense Joseph D. Kernan and Acting Undersecretary for Policy James H. Anderson resigned in protest or were forced out.[196] The White House sought to learn the names of political appointees who had applauded Anderson upon his departure, so they could be fired.[199] The DOD chief of staff, Jen Stewart, was replaced by a former staffer to Representative Devin Nunes.[196] On November 30, Christopher P. Maier, the head of the Pentagon's Defeat ISIS Task Force, was ousted and the task force was disbanded; a White House official told him that the United States had won the war against the Islamic State, so the task force was no longer needed.[200]\n\nTrump's allegations of election fraud in battleground states were refuted by judges, state election officials, and his own administration's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).[95] After CISA director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's voting-fraud allegations, Trump fired him on November 17.[201][202] Three other Department of Homeland Security officials – Matthew Travis, CISA's deputy director. Bryan Ware, CISA's assistant director for cybersecurity, and Valerie Boyd, the DHS's assistant secretary of international affairs – were also forced out.[196]\n\nBonnie Glick, the deputy administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, was abruptly fired on November 6; she had prepared a transition manual for the next administration. She was due to become acting administrator of the department on November 7. Firing her left the position of acting administrator vacant, so that Trump loyalist John Barsa could become acting deputy administrator.[203][204]\n\nCareer climate scientist Michael Kuperberg, who for the past five years has produced the annual National Climate Assessment issued by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was demoted on November 9 and returned to his previous position at the Department of Energy. Several media outlets reported that David Legates, a deputy assistant secretary at NOAA who claims that global warming is harmless, would be appointed to oversee the congressionally mandated report in place of Kuperberg, based on information obtained from \"people close to the Administration\", including Myron Ebell, the head of President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency transition team and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.[205] As of May 18, 2021, the Biden administration reappointed Kuperberg as executive director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program.[206]\n\nOn November 5, Neil Chatterjee was removed from his post as chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.[196]\n\nOn November 11, Lisa Gordon-Hagerty resigned from her posts as Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security and administrator of the quasi-independent National Nuclear Security Administration, reportedly due to longstanding tensions and disagreements with Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.[207]\n\nIn October 2020, Trump signed an executive order that created a new category of federal employee, Schedule F, which included all career civil servants whose job includes \"policymaking\". Such employees would no longer be covered by civil service protections against arbitrary dismissal, but would be subject to the same rules as political appointees. The new description could be applied to thousands of nonpartisan experts, such as scientists who give advice to the political appointees who run their departments.[208] Heads of all federal agencies were ordered to report by January 19, 2021, a list of positions that could be reclassified as Schedule F. The Office of Management and Budget submitted a list in November that included 88 percent of the office's workforce.[209] Federal employee organizations and Congressional Democrats sought to overturn the order via lawsuits or bills. House Democrats warned in a letter that \"The executive order could precipitate a mass exodus from the federal government at the end of every presidential administration, leaving federal agencies without deep institutional knowledge, expertise, experience, and the ability to develop and implement long-term policy strategies\".[210] Observers predicted that Trump could use the new rule to implement a \"massive government purge on his way out the door\".[211]\n\nMeanwhile, administration officials had ordered the Budget Office to begin work on a 2022 budget proposal that they would submit to Congress in February, ignoring the fact that Biden would have already taken over by that point.[212]\n\nLawsuits\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 2020 United States presidential election, the campaign for incumbent president Donald Trump filed a number of lawsuits contesting election processes, vote-counting, and the vote-certification process in multiple states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.[213] Many such cases were quickly dismissed,[97] and lawyers and other observers noted that the lawsuits were unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the election.[214][215][216] By November 19, more than two dozen of the legal challenges filed since Election Day had failed.[102]\n\nOn November 21, U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann, a Republican, dismissed the case before him with prejudice, ruling:\n\nIn this action, the Trump Campaign and the Individual Plaintiffs ... seek to discard millions of votes legally cast by Pennsylvanians from all corners – from Greene County to Pike County, and everywhere in between. In other words, Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise almost seven million voters. This Court has been unable to find any case in which a plaintiff has sought such a drastic remedy in the contest of an election, in terms of the sheer volume of votes asked to be invalidated. One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens.\n\nThat has not happened. Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence. In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state. Our people, laws, and institutions demand more.[217][218]\n\nMichigan officials pressured to not certify\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to November 17, the four-member board of canvassers of Wayne County, Michigan, was deadlocked on election-result certification along party lines with the two Republican members refusing to certify, but on November 17 the board voted unanimously to certify its results.[219] Trump and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called the two Republican members of the board that day to pressure them to not sign the official statement of votes; the next day the two Republicans sought but failed to rescind their votes for certification, signing affidavits stating that they had voted for certification only because the two Democratic members had promised a full audit of the county's votes.[220][221] The two denied Trump's call had influenced their reversal.[222] A recording of the phone call surfaced in December 2023, on which McDaniel can be heard telling the two Republicans, \"We will get you attorneys,\" to which Trump added, \"We'll take care of that.\" Trump can also be heard to say, \"We've got to fight for our country. We can't let these people take our country away from us.\"[223]\n\nTrump issued an invitation to Michigan lawmakers to travel to Washington.[224] Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and State Representative Jim Lilly were photographed in the lobby of the D.C. Trump Tower, where they were drinking $500-a-bottle champagne and were not wearing masks.[225] After the meeting, Chatfield and Shirkey released a joint statement indicating that they would \"follow the law\" and would not attempt to have the legislature intervene in selecting electoral votes.[226] Chatfield later floated the possibility of a \"constitutional crisis\" in Michigan, while Shirkey suggested that certification be delayed; however, neither took any concrete action to invalidate Biden's victory.[227][228] On November 21, Ronna McDaniel and Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox publicly called upon the Michigan State Board of Canvassers to not proceed with the planned certification of election results.[229] On November 23, the State Board of Canvassers certified the election.[230]\n\nAttempt to seize voting machines in Michigan\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in November 2020, the Trump campaign attempted to get local law enforcement agencies to seize voting machines for the Trump operation to review. In one Michigan county, Trump advisors including Rudy Giuliani phoned the county prosecutor on or about November 20, 2020. They asked him to obtain the county's voting machines and turn them over to the Trump team. He refused, but a judge later ordered the machines to be made available to Trump representatives. They later produced a \"forensic report\" claiming evidence of fraud; election experts have said the conclusion was false and the report \"critically flawed\".[231]\n\nAt least one person was indicted for trying to illegally access voting machines after the election.[232]\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State pressured to disqualify ballots\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia produced an initial count wherein Biden defeated Trump by around 14,000 votes, triggering an automatic recount due to the small margin. On November 13, 2020, while the recount was ongoing, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina privately called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to discuss Georgia's vote counting.[101][233] Raffensperger, a Republican, told The Washington Post that Graham had asked whether Raffensperger could disqualify all mail-in ballots in counties that had more signature errors.[101] Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official and staffer to Raffensperger, was present for the call, and Sterling confirmed that Graham had asked that question.[234]\n\nRaffensperger viewed Graham's question as a suggestion to throw out legally cast ballots, although Graham denied suggesting that. Graham acknowledged calling Raffensperger to find out how to \"protect the integrity of mail-in voting\" and \"how does signature verification work?\", but declared that if Raffensperger \"feels threatened by that conversation, he's got a problem\".[101] Graham stated that he was investigating in his own capacity as a senator, although he is the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Graham also claimed that he had spoken to the Secretaries of State in Arizona and Nevada. The Secretaries, however, denied this, and Graham then contradicted himself, stating that he had talked to the Governor of Arizona but no official in Nevada.[235]\n\nWisconsin recount-obstruction\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Andrew Iverson, head of Trump's Wisconsin campaign, told other campaign operatives in a strategy session: \"Here's the deal: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need. Just be on standby if there's any stunts we need to pull.\"[e][236]\n\nThe Trump campaign requested a recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties, both Democratic strongholds. On November 20, 2020, Wisconsin election officials reported that Trump campaign observers were attempting to obstruct the recount. According to officials, observers were \"constantly interrupting vote-counters with questions and comments\". At one table, a Republican representative was objecting to every ballot that was pulled for recount. At other tables, there were two Republican observers when only one was allowed; it was also reported that some Republicans had been posing as independents.[237] Completed by November 29, the recounts ended up increasing Biden's lead by 87 votes.[238]\n\nPartisan hearings with Republican legislatures\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 25, 2020, one day after Pennsylvania certified its election results, a Republican state senator requested a hearing of the State Senate Majority Policy Committee to discuss election issues. The event, described as an \"informational meeting\", was held at a hotel in Gettysburg and featured Rudy Giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud. Trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone, repeating his false claim that he had actually won in Pennsylvania and other swing states, and saying \"We have to turn the election over\".[239]\n\nIn Arizona, a state won by Biden, Republican members of the Arizona Senate promoted Trump's false claims of election fraud. In mid-December 2020, Eddie Farnsworth, Chairman of the State Senate Judiciary Committee, claimed that \"tampering\" or \"fraud\" might have marred the election, despite the testimony given by election officials, attorneys, and the Arizona Attorney General Election Integrity Unit at a six-hour hearing, all of whom testified that there was no evidence for such claims.[240] Hearings held in the Michigan Legislature similarly presented no evidence of any fraud or other wrongdoing.[241]\n\nConspiracy allegations\n\n[edit]\n\nDays before the 2020 presidential election, Dennis Montgomery, a software designer with a history of making dubious claims, asserted that a program called Scorecard, running on a government supercomputer called Hammer, would be used to switch votes from Trump to Biden on voting machines. Trump legal team attorney Sidney Powell promoted the conspiracy theory on Lou Dobbs Tonight on November 6,[242][243] and again two days later on Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business program, claiming to have \"evidence that that is exactly what happened\".[243] She also asserted that the CIA ignored warnings about the software, and urged Trump to fire director Gina Haspel.[244] Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), characterized the supercomputer claim as \"nonsense\" and a \"hoax\". CISA described the 2020 election as \"the most secure in American history\", with \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised\".[243][245] A few days later, Trump fired Krebs by tweet, claiming that Krebs' analysis was \"highly inaccurate\".[246]\n\nOn November 13, 2020, the Trump campaign's deputy director of communications, Zach Parkinson, asked his staff to review the claims regarding the voting machines; the staff concluded these claims were baseless.[39]\n\nDuring a November 19, 2020, press conference, Powell alleged without evidence that an international Communist plot had been engineered by Venezuela, Cuba, China, Hugo Chávez (who died in 2013), George Soros, the Clinton Foundation, and antifa to rig the 2020 elections.[247][30][248] She also alleged that Dominion Voting Systems \"can set and run an algorithm that probably ran all over the country to take a certain percentage of votes from President Trump and flip them to President Biden\".[28] The source for many of these claims appeared to be the far-right news organization One America News Network (OANN). She also repeated a conspiracy theory[169] spread by Texan Congressman Louie Gohmert, OANN and others:[249] that accurate voting results had been transmitted to the German office of the Spanish electronic voting firm Scytl, where they were tabulated to reveal a landslide victory for Trump nationwide (which included implausible Trump victories in Democratic strongholds such as California, Colorado, Maine statewide, Minnesota, and New Mexico), after which a company server was supposedly seized in a raid by the United States Army. The U.S. Army and Scytl refuted those claims:[250] Scytl has not had any offices in Germany since September 2019, and it does not tabulate any U.S. votes.[251][252] In a March 2021 report, the Justice and Homeland Security Departments flatly rejected accusations of voting fraud conducted by foreign nations.[253] Rudy Giuliani also spoke at this press conference. In a private text message, Rupert Murdoch described the Powell–Giuliani presentation as \"really crazy stuff, and damaging\".[254]\n\nIn a subsequent interview with Newsmax on November 21, 2020,[255] Powell accused Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, of being \"in on the Dominion scam\" and suggested financial impropriety.[256] Powell additionally alleged that fraud had prevented Doug Collins from winning a top-two position in the November 2020 nonpartisan blanket primary against incumbent Kelly Loeffler in the Senate race in Georgia.[257] She also claimed that the Democratic Party had used rigged Dominion machines to defeat Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary and that Sanders had learned of this but had \"sold out\".[258] She stated that she would \"blow up\" Georgia with a \"biblical\" court filing.[259] Powell suggested that candidates \"paid to have the system rigged to work for them\".[260] On the basis of these claims, Powell called for Republican-controlled state legislatures in swing states to disregard the election results and appoint a slate of \"loyal\" electors who would vote to re-elect Trump,[261] based on authority supposedly resting in Article Two of the Constitution.[262] The Washington Post reported that on December 5 Trump asked Kemp to convene a special session of the Georgia legislature for that purpose, but Kemp declined.[105] Trump also pressured Pennsylvania Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler to overturn the result and use electors loyal to Trump, but Cutler declined, saying that the legislature had no power to overturn the state's chosen slate of electors.[19]\n\nConservative television outlets amplified baseless allegations of voting machine fraud. Fox News host Lou Dobbs had been outspoken during his program supporting the allegations, but on December 18 his program aired a video segment debunking the allegations, although Dobbs himself did not comment. Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo had also been outspoken in supporting the allegations, and both their programs aired the same video segment debunking the allegations over the following two days.[263]\n\nSmartmatic, a company accused of conspiring with Dominion, demanded a retraction from Fox News. Smartmatic wanted corrections to be \"published on multiple occasions\" during prime time to \"match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications\". They also threatened legal action.[263][264][265] On February 4, 2021, Smartmatic filed a lawsuit against Dobbs, Bartiromo, Pirro, and Fox News itself, as well as against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, seeking $2.7 billion in total damages.[266]\n\nIn December 2020, Dominion sent a similar letter to Sidney Powell, demanding that she retract her allegations and retain all relevant records; the Trump legal team later instructed dozens of staffers to preserve all documents for any future litigation.[267][268] The company filed $1.3 billion defamation suits against Powell in January 2021.[269] While fighting the lawsuit in March 2021, Powell's attorneys claimed that her speech was protected because she was sharing her \"opinion\" and that, because she was serving as an attorney for the Trump campaign, it was her role to make accusations against Dominion. Dominion had complained that Powell's comments were \"wild\", \"outlandish\", and \"impossible\". Powell's attorneys seemed to concede that Powell had been obviously lying, saying that \"reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact\" and therefore that she had not defamed Dominion.[270]\n\nIn internal Fox News communications, several prominent network hosts and senior executives—including chairman Rupert Murdoch and CEO Suzanne Scott—discussed their knowledge that the election fraud allegations they were reporting were false. The communications showed the network was concerned that not reporting the falsehoods would alienate viewers and cause them to switch to rival conservative networks, impacting corporate profitability.[271] In a deposition in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, Murdoch said: \"I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it [the false allegations], in hindsight\".[272] The communications and deposition were reported in February 2023.\n\nThreats of violence by Trump supporters\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Biden won the election, angry Trump supporters threatened election officials, election officials' family members, and elections staff in at least eight states via emails, telephone calls and letters; some of the menacing and vitriolic communications included death threats. Officials terrorized by the threats included officials in the swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as a few less competitive states.[273] Some officials had to seek police protection[273][274] or move from their homes due to the threats.[273] The director of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, described the threats as frightening and said, \"These threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism. More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.\" Prominent Republicans ignored or said little about the threats of violence.[273]\n\nOn November 15, the Georgia Secretary of State reported that he and his wife were receiving death threats.[101] On November 30, Trump attorney Joseph diGenova said the recently fired head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs, should be \"taken out and shot\" for disputing the president's claims about election fraud.[182] On December 1, Republican Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling publicly condemned Trump and Georgia Senators Perdue and Loeffler for making unsubstantiated claims and for failing to condemn the threats of violence against election workers, including those made against a young, low-level Dominion employee and his family.[275] After Democratic Georgia State Senator Elena Parent spoke out against the false claims of voter fraud, she was targeted by online vitriol, threatened with death and sexual violence, and had her home address widely circulated online. Parent attributed the onslaught to Trump, saying, \"He has created a cult-like following and is exposing people like me across the country to danger because of his unfounded rhetoric on the election\".[274]\n\nIn early December, an \"enemies list\" circulated on the web falsely accusing various government officials and voting systems executives of rigging the election, providing their home addresses, and superimposing red targets on their photos.[276]\n\nThe Arizona Republican Party twice tweeted that supporters should be willing to \"die for something\" or \"give my life for this fight\". Ann Jacobs, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said she had received constant threats, including a message mentioning her children, and photos of her house had been posted on the web.[277]\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence asked a federal judge to dismiss a suit naming him as the defendant; filed by Texas Republican congressman Louis Gohmert and others, the ultimately unsuccessful suit asserted that the vice president had the sole constitutional authority to conduct the congressional certification of Electoral College results without restriction.[278] Attorney Lin Wood, a conspiracy theorist and QAnon promoter who had worked with Trump attorney Sidney Powell to file baseless lawsuits alleging election fraud, tweeted that day that Pence and other prominent Republican officials should be arrested for treason and that Pence should \"face execution by firing squad\".[279] Two weeks earlier, Wood had tweeted that people should stock up on survival goods, including \"2nd Amendment supplies\". Emerald Robinson, a White House correspondent for pro-Trump One America News, tweeted \"Folks, when [Lin Wood] tells people to prep, I listen\".[280]\n\nAfter Trump urged his supporters to protest in Washington as Congress convened to certify the election results, some posters in far-right online forums interpreted it as a call to action, with one asserting, \"We've got marching orders\", while others made references to possible violence and to bringing firearms to the protest. In a discussion of how to evade police blockades and the District of Columbia's gun laws, one poster remarked, \"We The People, Will not tolerate a Steal. No retreat, No Surrender. Restore to my President what you stole or reap the consequences!!!\".[281][282]\n\nDecember 2020\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 1, 2020, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said U.S. attorneys and FBI agents had investigated complaints and allegations of fraud, but found none of significance.[37][88][283][284] On December 3, 2020, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said no evidence had yet been found of foreign interference.[285][286]\n\nFormer Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who had received a presidential pardon shortly after the election, on December 1 publicly called on the president to suspend the Constitution, silence the press, and hold a new election under military supervision.[287]\n\nTrump's attempt to pressure state officials\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 5, Trump placed a call to Georgia governor Brian Kemp in which he urged the governor to call a special session of the state legislature to override the election results and appoint electors who would support Trump.[105] He also called the Pennsylvania speaker of the house with similar objectives, and had earlier invited Michigan Republican state officials to the White House to discuss election results in that state.[105][288] The Georgia and Pennsylvania contacts were made after Biden's victories had been certified in those states; Biden's Michigan victory was certified three days after the Trump White House meeting.[106][107][289]\n\nAfter Georgia had twice recounted and twice certified its results, Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger received death threats. He was pressured to resign by others in his party, including the state's two senators.[290][291] On December 23, Trump called the investigations chief in the Georgia Secretary of State's office, who was then investigating allegations of mail ballot fraud, and urged the official to \"find the fraud\" (a misquote that was amended by The Washington Post in March 2021 to \"[you would] find things that are gonna be unbelievable\");[292] the investigation ultimately concluded that the allegations had no merit.[293] Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued the state and three others, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate the states' voting results, alleging that they had violated the Constitution, citing a litany of complaints that had already been rejected by other courts.[294][295] Trump and seventeen Republican state attorneys general filed motions to support the case, the merits of which were sharply criticized by legal experts and politicians.[296][297] The day the suit was filed, Trump warned Georgia attorney general Chris Carr to not rally other Republican officials in opposition to the suit.[298]\n\nOn December 4, 2020, 64 Republican members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly signed a letter urging the state's congressional delegation to reject Biden's electoral votes. Kim Ward, the Republican majority leader of the Pennsylvania senate, said that Trump had called her to say there had been fraud in the election, but she had not seen the letter before it had been released. She stated that Republican leaders were expected to support Trump's claims and if she had announced opposition to the letter, \"I'd get my house bombed tonight\".[299][300]\n\nOn December 10, 2020, after several lawsuits had been dismissed, Trump tweeted, \"This is going to escalate dramatically. This is a very dangerous moment in our history. ... The fact that our country is being stolen. A coup is taking place in front of our eyes, and the public can't take this anymore.\"[301]\n\nSupreme Court petitions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Texas v. Pennsylvania\n\nBefore and after the election, Trump said he expected the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court, where conservative justices held a 6–3 majority, with three of the justices having been appointed by Trump.[302][127]\n\nOn November 21, a group of Republican legislators in Pennsylvania petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court in appeal of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision against the legislators, who had asked to nullify mailed ballots after they had been cast, or to direct the legislature to select Pennsylvania's electors. The high court denied the request in a one-sentence, unsigned order on December 8. By the time of the high court's decision, the Pennsylvania election results had been certified in Biden's favor. Lawyers for Pennsylvania argued to the high court that the legislators' request was \"an affront to constitutional democracy\" and that \"Petitioners ask this court to undertake one of the most dramatic, disruptive invocations of judicial power in the history of the Republic; no court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor's certification of presidential election results\".[46][106]\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued the states of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where certified results showed Joe Biden had won,[303] alleging a variety of unconstitutional actions in their presidential balloting, arguments that had already been rejected in other courts. Paxton asked the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate those states' 62 electoral votes, allowing Trump to be declared the winner of a second presidential term.[46] This case, Texas v. Pennsylvania, was hailed by Trump as \"the big one\".[48] Seventeen Republican state attorneys general filed amicus briefs to support the case and 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed onto it.[304] On December 11, the Supreme Court said it would not hear the case. In denying the plaintiff's motion to invalidate those votes, it said that \"the state of Texas' motion\" had \"lack of standing\".[303][305][306] Ted Cruz, who had previously argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, agreed to Trump's request to argue the Paxton suit should it come before the Court.[307][308]\n\nIn late December attorneys Chesebro and Troupis asked the Supreme Court to review whether competing slates of electors from seven contested states could be considered by Congress on January 6. The Supreme Court declined their request for an opinion.[194]\n\nOn December 31, lawyer Kenneth Chesebro emailed other members of Trump's legal team, saying that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was \"key\" and proposing that they \"frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue\" an order to undermine Georgia's election results. Trump lawyer John Eastman responded in agreement.[309]\n\nConsideration of special counsel and martial law\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter legal efforts by Trump and his proxies had failed in numerous state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court,[310] some right-wing activists and Trump allies – including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L. Lin Wood – suggested that Trump could suspend the Constitution, declare martial law and \"rerun\" the election.[311][312] Many retired military officers, attorneys, and other commentators expressed horror at such a notion.[313][f] Trump held an Oval Office meeting on December 18 with Rudy Giuliani, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Powell, and Flynn. At the meeting, Trump entertained the idea of naming Powell, who has promoted election conspiracy theories and falsehoods, as special counsel to investigate election matters, though most advisors in attendance strongly opposed the idea. Two executive orders were drafted to appoint a special counsel and confiscate voting machines, which Trump falsely claimed were rigged against him. One order called for the Pentagon to seize machines, while the other tasked the Department of Homeland Security. At Trump's direction, Giuliani called Ken Cuccinelli, the second in command at DHS, on December 17 to ask if the department could seize the machines, but Cuccinelli said it did not have the authority. On Giuliani's advice, Trump had rejected a recommendation from Flynn and Powell to have the Pentagon seize the machines, and Bill Barr flatly rejected the president's suggestion that the Justice Department do it.[318][51][319][320] Flynn reportedly discussed his idea to declare martial law, although others also resisted that idea, and Trump's opinion on the matter was unclear. That same day, Flynn appeared on Newsmax TV to suggest that Trump had the power to deploy the military to \"rerun\" the election in the swing states that Trump had lost.[310] Trump dismissed reports about a discussion of martial law as \"fake news\", but it remained unclear whether he had endorsed the notion.[321]\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke martial law to invalidate the results of the election would be illegal and unconstitutional.[322][323] In late December 2020, legal scholars Claire O. Finkelstein and Richard Painter wrote that while it was very unlikely that Trump would actually \"attempt to spark a military coup\", Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen should be prepared to direct federal law enforcement \"to arrest anyone, including if necessary the president, who ... conspired to carry out this illegal plan\". Likening a hypothetical invocation of martial law to overturn the election to the 1861 firing on Fort Sumter, Finkelstein and Painter wrote that any such plan would constitute seditious conspiracy and possibly other crimes, and that any military officers or enlisted personnel ordered to assist in such a plan would be required, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to disregard such an illegal order.[322]\n\nOn December 18, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and General James McConville, the Army chief of staff, issued a joint statement saying, \"There is no role for the US military in determining the outcome of an American election\".[324] On January 3, all ten living former secretaries of defense – Ashton Carter, Dick Cheney, William Cohen, Mark Esper, Robert Gates, Chuck Hagel, James Mattis, Leon Panetta, William Perry and Donald Rumsfeld – published an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, noting that \"efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory\", and noting that \"civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic\". The former defense secretaries wrote that \"acting defense secretary Christopher C. Miller and his subordinates – political appointees, officers and civil servants – are each bound by oath, law and precedent to facilitate the entry into office of the incoming administration, and to do so wholeheartedly. They must also refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team.\"[325]\n\nElizabeth Neumann, an adviser at Defending Democracy Together and a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under Trump, stated that \"In the conspiratorial conservative base supporting Trump, there are calls for using the Insurrection Act to declare martial law. When they hear that the president is actually considering this, there are violent extremist groups that look at this as a dog whistle, an excuse to go out and create ... violence.\"[321]\n\nPlanning for Congress to overturn the election on January 6\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 21, Congressman Mo Brooks, who had been the first member of Congress to announce he would object to the January 6, 2021 certification of the Electoral College results,[326][327] organized three White House meetings between Trump, Republican lawmakers, and others. Attendees included Trump, Vice President Pence, representatives Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and members of the Trump legal team. The purpose of the meetings was to strategize about how Congress could overturn the election results on January 6. Brooks confirmed after one such meeting that it had been \"a back-and-forth concerning the planning and strategy for January the 6th.\".[328]\n\nTalking Points Memo reported in December 2022 that it had obtained the 2,319 text messages Meadows had provided to the January 6 committee, including 450 showing Meadows communicating with 34 Republican members of Congress about plans to overturn the election.[329]\n\nPressure on Pence\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the run-up to election certification on January 6, attempts to uncover significant election fraud bore no fruit and related legal challenges were rejected by the courts. Hence, those seeking to overturn the election focused attention increasingly on then-vice-president Mike Pence. The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the President of the Senate, which was Pence for the January 6 certification of the presidential election, to supervise the counting of electoral ballots at a joint session of the Congress.[330] The Trump team developed multiple theories about how the Vice President might act on January 6 to aid the overturning of election results; and repeatedly encouraged him to act accordingly.[citation needed]\n\n\"Pence Card\" conspiracy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Eastman memos and Trump fake electors plot\n\nBeginning in late December, false legal theories went viral on pro-Trump social media suggesting that Vice President Pence could invoke a \"Pence Card\", a supposed legal loophole that would enable him, in his capacity as president of the Senate, to reject electoral votes for Biden from contested swing states on the grounds that they had been cast by fraudulently appointed electors.[331][332] These theories originated from Ivan Raiklin, an attorney and former Green Beret who was among a small group of military-intelligence veterans associated with Michael Flynn who were instrumental in spreading false information alleging the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump.[179][108][333] The theory stems from a misreading of 3 U.S.C. § 12, which directs the vice president to request electoral vote certificates from any state that has not yet sent these votes to the National Archives by the fourth Wednesday in December. Under the theory, Pence had unilateral authority to declare that state certificates from contested states had not in fact been received, and that new certificates (presumably supporting President Trump) should be issued.[334][335] Trump retweeted a post of Raiklin's calling for the invocation of the Pence Card on December 23,[108] the day specified in statute, but Pence took no action consistent with the theory. In late December, Pence called former vice president Dan Quayle for advice, and Quayle told him (according to reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa): \"Mike, you have no flexibility on this. None. Zero. ... I do know the position you're in. I also know what the law is. ... You have no power.\"[336] Although the fourth Wednesday had passed, Trump still believed that Pence had the authority to reject electoral votes, and kept asking him to do so; however, over lunch on January 5, Pence informed Trump that he did not believe he had any such authority.[337][338]\n\nAttorney John Eastman incorrectly told Pence in a January 5 Oval Office meeting that Pence had the constitutional authority to block the certification, which Trump reportedly urged Pence to consider.[339][340] Eastman also sent to Republican senator Mike Lee a six-point plan of action for Pence to set aside electors in seven states, which Lee rejected.[340] By January 5, Trump was continuing to assert that Pence had unilateral power to throw out states' official electoral certificates on grounds of fraud.[116] During the Capitol attack, numerous rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\", and the phrase trended on Twitter until Twitter banned it.[341] In March, when ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he was worried about Pence while the crowd was chanting, Trump defended the crowd, saying they were \"very angry\" and that it was \"common sense\" that they would want to stop Congress from certifying the election result. Of Pence, Trump said, \"I thought he was well protected and I had heard that he was in good shape\".[342][g]\n\nDozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence on January 5 asking him to delay for ten days the final certification of electors scheduled for the following day, to allow them an opportunity to open special legislative sessions to decertify their electors and submit a new slate of electors. This came three days after Trump, Giuliani, and Eastman held a conference call with 300 legislators to present them purported evidence of election fraud.[108] Ted Cruz, a decades-long friend of Eastman, proposed a complementary plan in the Senate, garnering the support of ten other senators.[307]\n\nIn January 2022, as Congress began debating whether to amend the 1887 Electoral Count Act to make it clearer that the vice-president has no power to overturn an election,[343] Trump released a statement asserting, falsely, that Pence did have such power: \"Unfortunately, he didn't exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!\" and \"they now want to take that right away\".[344] Pence responded several days later while addressing the Federalist Society: \"President Trump is wrong. ... Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election.\"[345]\n\nDecember timeline\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Eastman, author of the Eastman memos, began working with the Trump team in November 2020.[346] Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the \"Green Bay Sweep\" plan was developed over weeks prior to January 6, 2021.[347]\n\nOn December 13, Trump allies in the House were developing a plan involving Pence \"to use Congress's tallying of electoral results on Jan. 6 to tip the election to President Trump\".[348] Kenneth Chesebro emailed Rudy Giuliani and others pointing out that, if Pence were to recuse himself, Republican senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa would be in charge of certifying the election, and if Grassley were to delay doing so, this would give Trump more time for court battles. Chesebro's subject line called this the \"'President of the Senate' strategy\".[349]\n\nOn December 21, Trump's legal advisors, Pence, and multiple members of Congress at a White House meeting discussed ways to challenge the January 6 certification process and results.[350]\n\nOn December 23, Trump re-tweeted the Ivan Raiklin \"Operation Pence Card\" memo while stating \"America @VP @Mike_Pence MUST do this, tomorrow To defend our Constitution from our enemies ... Let him know!\".[351]\n\nOn December 24, a Trump aide contacted John Eastman to request documentation of his legal theories concerning the certification process including the role of the vice president, resulting in the Eastman memos.[346]\n\nOn December 27, a lawsuit seeking to force action by Pence during the January 6 certification, Gohmert v. Pence (see below), was filed in a Texas court.\n\nOn December 31, then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows e-mailed a memo prepared by Jenna Ellis, a legal advisor to the Trump campaign, to one of Pence's top aides.[352] The memo claimed that the Vice President should not open electoral ballots from six states \"that have electoral delegates in dispute\", and should defer the eventual count of electoral delegates until January 15.[353]\n\nPressure on Justice Department\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 14, two weeks after Barr stated there was no evidence of significant election fraud, Trump announced that Barr would be leaving as attorney general by Christmas.[354][355] Before Trump's announcement, he enlisted Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other aides to pressure deputy attorney Jeffrey Rosen, who would replace Barr on December 23, and other Justice Department officials to challenge the election results. Meadows and a top Trump aide emailed allegations of voting anomalies in three states to Rosen and other officials. Meadows also sought to have Rosen investigate a conspiracy theory, promoted by a Giuliani ally, that satellites and military technology had been used in Italy to remotely change votes from Trump to Biden. Trump also enlisted a private attorney, Kurt Olsen, to seek a meeting with Rosen to propose a legal challenge he had drafted; it was similar to a challenge initiated by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and supported by dozens of Republican members of Congress and state attorneys general, that attempted unsuccessfully to have the Supreme Court reject election results in four states. Trump also spoke to Rosen about Olsen's proposal. Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue resisted the efforts, exchanging emails mocking them, in one case, as \"pure insanity\".[33][356][357] Rosen later testified to Congress, \"During my tenure, no special prosecutors were appointed, whether for election fraud or otherwise; no public statements were made questioning the election; no letters were sent to State officials seeking to overturn the election results; [and] no DOJ court actions or filings were submitted seeking to overturn election results\".[358]\n\nIn late December, Trump reportedly phoned Rosen \"nearly every day\" to tell him about claims of voter fraud or improper vote counts.[358] Donoghue took notes of a December 27, 2020, phone call between him, Rosen and Trump in which he characterized the president saying, \"Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen\".[34][35] The next day Jeffrey Clark, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division, approached Rosen and Donoghue with a draft letter and requested them to sign it. The letter was addressed to officials in the state of Georgia, saying that the Justice Department had evidence that raised \"significant concerns\" about the outcome of the presidential election, contrary to what Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier, and suggesting that the Georgia legislature \"call itself into special session for [t]he limited purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors\". Both Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign the letter, and it was never sent.[359]\n\nThe Associated Press reported in December that Heidi Stirrup, an ally of Trump advisor Stephen Miller, who months earlier had been quietly installed at the Justice Department as the White House's \"eyes and ears\", had in recent days been banned from the building after it was learned she pressured officials for sensitive information about potential election fraud and other matters she could relay to the White House. Stirrup had also circumvented Justice Department management to extend job offers to political allies for senior Department positions and interfered with the hiring of career officials.[360]\n\nPressure on Defense Department\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, Michael Flynn called senior Trump intelligence official Ezra Cohen and told him to take extreme actions, including seizing ballots, to prevent the election results from favoring the Democrat. Cohen didn't entertain Flynn's orders, responding, \"Sir, the election is over. It's time to move on.\" Flynn replied, \"You're a quitter! This is not over! Don't be a quitter!\".[361][362]\n\nTrump attorney Sidney Powell called Cohen shortly thereafter and attempted to enlist his help with a far-fetched claim involving then-CIA Director Gina Haspel. According to Karl's book, Powell told Cohen that \"Haspel has been hurt and taken into custody in Germany. You need to launch a special operations mission to get her.\" The claim, a conspiracy theory, had been circulating among Powell's QAnon following for some time.[362] The conspiracy theory falsely claimed that Haspel had been injured while on a secret CIA operation to seize an election-related computer server that belonged to a company named Scytl. Powell alleged to Cohen that the server contained evidence of \"hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of votes had been switched using rigged voting machines\". Powell was under the impression that Haspel had been engaged in this operation with the aim of destroying the nonexistent evidence on that nonexistent server. According to the book, Cohen thought Powell sounded \"out of her mind\" and he quickly reported the call to the acting defense secretary.[361]\n\nA December 18, 2020, memo proposed that the Trump administration seek evidence that there had been foreign interference in favor of Biden. The memo laid out a plan for Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller to use National Security Agency and Defense Department powers to seize phone and email records. One of Trump's informal advisers, Michael Pillsbury, described this as \"amateur hour\" perpetrated by people with no existing connection to Trump who were raising topics that the government had already \"said there was no evidence for\".[363] In May 2021, Miller testified to the January 6 House committee that he had feared Trump might \"invoke the Insurrection Act to politicize the military in an antidemocratic manner\".[364]\n\nPlan to seize voting machines\n\n[edit]\n\nThe then-President's team also developed plans to have federal authorities seize voting machines from states where the election had been closely contested but won by Biden. News reports indicate that, at various points in the planning, the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard were considered as entities that would conduct the seizures. Several versions of a draft Executive Order that would authorize the seizures were prepared. Then-President Trump was reported to have reviewed the draft Executive Order authorizing seizure by the National Guard but, based on advice by (among others) Patrick Cipollone and Rudy Giuliani, he did not sign and issue it.[320][365]\n\nIn June 2022, an email dated November 21, 2020 surfaced, sent by British biopharmaceuticals executive Andrew Whitney, who in August 2020 pitched to Trump in the Oval Office the toxic botanical extract oleandrin as a cure for COVID-19. The email included a draft \"authorizing letter\" to be presented by the president allowing three armed private companies to seize all voting machines and related materials, with assistance from U.S. Marshals. The email was sent to Doug Logan, the president of Cyber Ninjas, which later conducted the 2021 Maricopa County presidential ballot audit that sought but failed to find election fraud in that county, and to cybersecurity expert Jim Penrose, who had worked with Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn and Patrick M. Byrne, who were seeking access to voting machines in an attempt to find proof of election fraud.[366][367]\n\nEllis memos\n\n[edit]\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent a memo drafted by Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to a top Pence aide containing a detailed plan to overturn the election results. The plan entailed Pence returning the electoral results to six battleground states on January 6, with a deadline of January 15 for the states to return them. If any state did not return their electoral slate by that date, neither Trump nor Biden would hold a majority, so the election would be thrown to the House for a vote to determine the winner. Per the Constitution, in such a scenario the vote would be conducted on the basis of party control of state legislatures, with Republicans holding 26 of 50, presumably giving Trump the victory.[352]\n\nEllis drafted a second memo dated January 5 which she shared with Trump personal attorney, Jay Sekulow. The memo argued that certain provisions of the Electoral Count Act that restricted Pence's authority to accept or reject selected electors were unconstitutional. She proposed that when Pence reached Arizona in the alphabetical order during the certification, he could declare the state's results as disputed and send all the electoral slates back to the states for \"the final ascertainment of electors to be completed before continuing\". Sekulow did not agree that Pence had such authority.[353]\n\nPlan to obtain National Security Agency data\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2022, The Washington Post obtained a memo of unknown provenance dated December 18, 2020, that had circulated among Trump allies and was shared with some Republican senators. The memo called for Trump to direct acting defense secretary Christopher Miller to obtain \"NSA unprocessed raw signals data\" in an effort to prove foreign interference in the election. The proposal called for Miller to direct three men named in the document to acquire the data. At least two Republican senators received the memo after a January 4 meeting at the Trump International Hotel attended by at least three senators and others, which had been arranged by Mike Lindell. The meeting centered around voting machines and alleged interference by China, Venezuela and other countries. The three men involved were not close to Trump and their names had not been previously reported in efforts to subvert the election. Miller said he was not aware of the memo and Trump did not act on it.[363]\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nOn New Year's Day, White House director of personnel John McEntee sent a series of bullet points via text message to Pence's chief of staff to incorrectly assert that Thomas Jefferson \"Used His Position as VP to Win\" the 1801 election, which McEntee claimed \"proves that the VP has, at a minimum, a substantial discretion to address issues with the electoral process\". Jonathan Karl, the ABC News chief White House correspondent for the duration of the Trump administration, wrote a November 2021 profile of McEntee, characterizing him as particularly powerful because \"Trump knew he was the one person willing to do anything Trump wanted\".[368][369]\n\nTrump reportedly reached out to Steve Bannon for advice on his quest to overturn the election results.[370] In early January, Bannon, John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani were operating what they called a \"war room\" or \"command center\" at the Willard Hotel near the White House with the goal of overturning the election results. Christina Bobb of the pro-Trump One America News was also a participant.[108] Further related details of the effort to deny and overturn the election were also reported.[371][372][373][374]\n\nJustice Department officials pressured Atlanta's top federal prosecutor, B. J. Pak, to say there had been widespread voter fraud in Georgia, warning him that he would be fired if he did not.[375] The White House forced Pak to resign on January 4, 2021.[376]\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a joint session of Congress presided over by Vice President Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took place to count the electoral votes. Normally a ceremonial formality, the session was interrupted by a mob that attacked the Capitol.[377][378] Trump had held a simultaneous rally on the Ellipse where he encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol building.[citation needed]\n\nFive lawyers who represented Trump resigned at the end of January 2021 after claiming he coerced them to repeat false claims of voter fraud.[379]\n\nGohmert v. Pence\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 27, 2020, Republican representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for Arizona filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Vice President Mike Pence, seeking to force him to decide the election outcome.[380][381] Gohmert argued that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 was unconstitutional, that the Constitution gave Vice President Pence the \"sole\" power to decide the election outcome, and that Pence had the power to \"count elector votes certified by a state's executive\", select \"a competing slate of duly qualified electors\", or \"ignore all electors from a certain state\".[380][382][383] Pence, represented by the Justice Department, moved to dismiss the case, since Congress, and not the vice president, was a more suitable defendant. The Justice Department also argued that \"the Vice President – the only defendant in this case – is ironically the very person whose power [plaintiffs] seek to promote. A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction.\"[384][385] Lawyers for Congress also supported Pence's position.[385]\n\nOn January 1, 2021, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle dismissed the suit saying that due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction relating to the constitutional status of the Electoral Count Act.[381][385][386] On appeal, the next day, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed Gohmert's appeal in a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel.[387]\n\nCalls with state officials\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Trump–Raffensperger phone call\n\nOn January 2, 2021, Trump, Giuliani, Eastman and others held a conference call with 300 legislators of key states to provide them purported evidence of election fraud to justify calling special sessions of their legislatures in an attempt to decertify their electors. Three days later, dozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence to ask he delay the January 6 final certification of electors for ten days to allow legislators the opportunity to reconsider their states' certifications.[108]\n\nThat same day, Trump held a one-hour phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.[388][389] Trump was joined by Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, trade adviser Peter Navarro, Justice Department official John Lott Jr., law professor John Eastman, and attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Cleta Mitchell and Kurt Hilbert. Raffensperger was joined by his general counsel Ryan Germany.[390] Raffensperger recorded the call, reportedly doing so while recalling his November 13 call with Trump ally and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, after which Graham made public statements about the discussion that were at odds with Raffensperger's recollection.[391]\n\nIn the call with Raffensperger, Trump repeatedly referred to disproven claims of election fraud and urged Raffensperger to overturn the election, saying, \"I just want to find 11,780 votes\".[104] Raffensperger refused, noting that Georgia had certified its results after counting the votes three times,[392] and said at one point in the conversation, \"Well, Mr. President, the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong\".[392][393] Trump issued a vague threat suggesting that Raffensperger and his general counsel Ryan Germany might be subject to criminal liability.[394] After the Georgia call, Trump and his team spoke on Zoom with officials in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.[395]\n\nRaffensperger told his advisers that he did not wish a recording or a transcript to be made public unless Trump made false claims about the conversation or attacked Georgia officials. On the morning of January 3, Trump tweeted that Raffensperger \"was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions\" about various election-related conspiracy theories endorsed by Trump. Raffensperger replied by tweet, \"Respectfully, President Trump: what you're saying is not true. The truth will come out.\"[396] Later that day, The Washington Post reported on the call and published the full audio and transcript[390][397] (the Associated Press also obtained the recording that day).[392]\n\nTwo months later, it was revealed that Trump had also called Raffensperger's chief investigator, Frances Watson, on December 23. He spoke to her for six minutes, during which he told her: \"When the right answer comes out, you'll be praised\".[398][399]\n\nLegal experts stated that Trump's attempt to pressure Raffensperger could have violated election law,[392] including federal and state laws against soliciting election fraud or interference in elections.[395][400] Election-law scholar Edward B. Foley called Trump's conduct \"inappropriate and contemptible\" while the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington called Trump's attempt \"to rig a presidential election ... a low point in American history and unquestionably impeachable conduct\".[401]\n\nDemocrats condemned Trump's conduct.[392] Vice President-elect Harris, as well as Representative Adam Schiff,[402] (the chief prosecutor at Trump's first impeachment trial) said that Trump's attempt to pressure Raffensperger was an abuse of power.[392][403] Senator Dick Durbin as well as Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice requested a criminal investigation,[404] while others called Trump's conduct an impeachable offense.[405] More than 90 House Democrats supported a formal censure resolution, introduced by Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia, to \"censure and condemn\" Trump for having \"misused the power of his office by threatening an elected official with vague criminal consequences if he failed to pursue the president's false claims\" and for attempting \"to willfully deprive the citizens of Georgia of a fair and impartial election process in direct contravention\" of state and federal law.[406][407] In February 2021, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened a criminal investigation into the phone call along with the phone call made by Lindsey Graham.[408] In January 2022, a panel of Fulton County judges agreed to Willis's request to impanel a special grand jury to compel testimony from individuals who had refused to cooperate.[409]\n\nSeveral House and Senate Republicans also condemned Trump's conduct,[392][410] although no Republican described the conduct as criminal or an impeachable offense as of January 4.[410][needs update] Republican senator Pat Toomey, who was not seeking reelection in 2022, called it a \"new low in this whole futile and sorry episode\", and commended \"Republican election officials across the country who have discharged their duties with integrity over the past two months while weathering relentless pressure, disinformation, and attacks from the president and his campaign\".[410] Other congressional Republicans ignored or sought to defend Trump's Georgia call, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy[407] and Georgia Senator David Perdue, who told Fox News in an interview that he thought releasing the tape of the call was \"disgusting\".[411]\n\nJustice Department pressured and efforts made to replace acting attorney general\n\n[edit]\n\nThe day after Attorney General William Barr said he intended to resign, Trump began to pressure his planned replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, to help him fight the election results. In particular, Trump asked Rosen to file legal briefs supporting lawsuits against the election results; to announce Justice Department investigations of alleged serious election fraud; and to appoint special prosecutors to investigate Trump's unfounded allegations of voter fraud and accusations against Dominion Voting Systems.[412] Rosen refused, as did his deputy, Richard Donoghue, as the Justice Department had already determined and announced that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.[37] However, Trump continued to pressure them.[412]\n\nDespite these disagreements, Rosen became acting U.S. Attorney General on December 24 as originally planned. Trump continued to pressure Rosen, asking him to go to the Supreme Court directly to invalidate the election results, but Rosen – along with his predecessor Barr and former acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall – said such a case would have no basis and refused to file it.[413][414]\n\nMeanwhile, assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, acting head of the Civil Division, proposed himself as Rosen's replacement, suggesting to Trump that he would support the president's efforts to overturn the election results. Clark told Rosen and other top Justice Department officials that the Department should announce it was investigating serious election fraud issues. Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials claiming the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\" and urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors\".[415] Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue rejected the suggestion, as the Department had previously determined and announced that there was no significant fraud.[416] On January 3, Clark revealed to Rosen that Trump intended to appoint him in Rosen's place. Rosen, Donoghue, and head of the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel made a pact to resign if Rosen was removed. Confronted with the threat of mass resignations, the president backed away from the plan.[412][417] In early August 2021, Rosen and Donoghue told the Justice Department inspector general and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Clark attempted to help Trump subvert the election.[418][419] Rosen also told the Committee that Trump opened a January 3 Oval Office meeting with Rosen, Donoghue and Clark by saying, \"One thing we know is you, Rosen, aren't going to do anything to overturn the election\".[420]\n\nDuring the closing weeks of the Trump presidency, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent multiple emails to Rosen, asking him to investigate conspiracy theories, including that satellites had been used from Italy to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. Rosen did not open the investigation.[421]\n\nPreparations by chief of staff\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the days leading up to January 6, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent messages in support of preparing alternate Republican electors to replace those in some states in which Biden might win. He also claimed in an email that the National Guard would be ready to \"protect pro Trump people\".[422]\n\nAdditionally, a PowerPoint presentation on how the election could be overturned was sent by email to Meadows on January 5. The presentation, circulated by retired Army Colonel Phil Waldron[423] and apparently inspired by the ideas of Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, alleged foreign interference in the election and recommended that the president declare a national emergency to delay the certification, that Pence provide alternate electors, and that the military count votes. When Meadows was subpoenaed in September 2021 by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, he provided the document to the Committee and stated that he had not acted on the plan it described.[424][425] Of the broader context, U.S. Representative Ro Khanna said on December 15: \"There were 20, 30 people who knew about it and were close to going through with it\".[426]\n\nMore pressure on Pence\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early January 2021, Trump and his supporters continued to pressure Pence into aiding their attempts to overturn election results during the January 6 certification. In early January, Trump criticized Pence for being \"too honest\" and warned him that people would \"hate\" him and believe he was \"stupid\".[427]\n\nOn January 1, Trump aide John McEntee sent a memo to Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, titled \"Jefferson used his position as VP to win\", suggesting that Pence could emulate Thomas Jefferson by taking the actions encouraged by Trump and his supporters.[352]\n\nOn January 2 in an appearance on Fox News, Trump aide Peter Navarro claimed that Pence had authority to delay election certification and to require an audit of the states' election results.[428] Navarro, a promoter of the Green Bay Sweep, was intimately involved with the election-overturn effort. His remarks elicited a public response from the Vice President's office.[429]\n\nOn January 3, Eastman memos author John Eastman briefed Marc Short and vice-presidential counsel Greg Jacob on the arguments he had been presenting to Trump about the Vice President's certification role.[346]\n\nOn January 4, Trump tweeted, \"the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors\".[430]\n\nLater that day, Trump told an audience of thousands at a January 4 rally in Georgia, \"I hope Mike Pence comes through for us ... Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much\".[430]\n\nOn January 4 and 5, Trump met with Pence at the White House several times, attempting to persuade Pence to act as recommended by the Eastman memos; Eastman was present for at least one of the meetings.[431][338]\n\nAlso, on January 5 – following a January 2 call between Trump, Giuliani, Eastman, and about 300 state legislators – several dozen of those legislators from five key states wrote to Pence and requested a 10-day delay of certification to allow reconsideration of the electoral results previously certified by those state legislatures.[108]\n\nAlso on January 5, Eastman communicated with Jacob.[346] That day, Jacob wrote a memo to Pence stating that Eastman's plan would violate multiple provisions of the Electoral Count Act and would assuredly be blocked in court, or if not considered by a court, would create an unprecedented political crisis and \"the vice president would likely find himself in an isolated standoff against both houses of Congress...with no neutral arbiter available to break the impasse\".[432]\n\nOn January 5 or the early morning of January 6, after hearing from Pence and that he did not agree that the Vice President's power extended to actions that would change election results, Trump issued a statement falsely claiming that Pence was \"in total agreement\" with his contention that \"the vice president has the power to act\".[338]\n\nOn January 6 in the morning, Trump called Pence and again attempted to secure his cooperation. Trump reportedly told Pence, \"You can either go down in history as a patriot or you can go down in history as a pussy\".[431]\n\nOn January 6 at the rally preceding the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Trump said, \"If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election\", \"Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country\", and \"All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president ...\".[433]\n\nOther speakers at the January 6 rally, notably Giuliani and Eastman, also highlighted the actions being requested of Pence.[434] After the rally, during the 2021 United States Capitol attack, rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and displayed gallows complete with a hanging noose.\n\nDuring the Capitol attack on January 6, Eastman emailed Jacob, who was with Pence in the Capitol, saying that the siege was occurring \"because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary\".[371]\n\nAlso, during the January 6 Capitol attack and resulting interruption of the certification process, Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution\".[431]\n\nThe certification process was interrupted for about 5 hours and 53 minutes (from 2:13 p.m. to 8:06 p.m.).\n\nIn a meeting arranged by Senior presidential advisor Jared Kushner, Trump and Pence met each other on January 11 for the purpose of reconciliation.[435]\n\nJanuary 6 joint session\n\n[edit]\n\nSenate efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2020, several Republican members of the House, led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama,[36][436] as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri,[437] declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January 6, 2021, joint session.[36][377][436] The objections would then trigger votes from both houses.[377] At least 140 House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes, despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election, and the allegations' rejections by courts, election officials, the Electoral College and others,[36] and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had \"just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered\".[115]\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who on December 15 had acknowledged Biden's victory the day after the Electoral College vote, privately urged his Republican Senate colleagues not to join efforts by some House Republicans to challenge the vote count,[36] but he was unable to persuade Hawley not to lodge an objection.[438] Hawley used his objection stance in fundraising emails.[439][440] Eleven Republican senators and senators-elect Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Steve Daines, John Kennedy, Marsha Blackburn, Mike Braun, Cynthia Lummis, Roger Marshall, Bill Hagerty, and Tommy Tuberville – one-quarter of Senate Republicans – announced that they would join Hawley's challenge. However, many senators acknowledged that it would not succeed. On January 2, 2021, Vice President Pence had expressed support for the attempt to overturn Biden's victory. Neither Pence nor the 11 senators planning to object made any specific allegation of fraud; rather, they vaguely suggested that some wrongdoing might have taken place.[115] Other Senate Republicans were noncommittal or opposed to the attempt by the 11 Republican senators to subvert the election results.[438]\n\nObjections to the electoral votes had virtually no chance of success, as Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives[36] and, although the Senate had a Republican majority, there was no majority for overturning the election results.[438] Trevor Potter, a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and the president of the Campaign "
