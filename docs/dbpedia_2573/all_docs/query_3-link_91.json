        "text": "Washington state's longtime attorney general and a former sheriff known for his work hunting down the Green River Killer are vying to become the next governor of a Democratic stronghold that hasn’t had an open race for the state's top job in more than a decade.\n\nDemocrat Bob Ferguson, who has served as attorney general since 2013, will face former U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert in Tuesday’s primary election, in a race that has featured weeks of intense sparring between the two front-runners in a field of more than two dozen candidates.\n\nFerguson has framed Reichert, a Republican, as a two-faced candidate whose more moderate rhetoric during this campaign does not align with statements he has made in private or his actions in Congress. Meanwhile, Reichert has painted Ferguson as a candidate who wouldn’t change anything about the state, while providing a continuation of \"one-party rule.\"\n\nIn a state with a reputation as solid Democratic territory that hasn’t had a Republican governor in nearly 40 years, any conservative candidate faces an uphill battle. But polling shows Reichert not far behind Ferguson and the race is considered competitive.\n\nUnder Washington’s primary system, the top two vote-getters in each of Tuesday’s races advance to the November election, regardless of party. Experts predict a Ferguson and Reichert matchup in November.\n\nWashington county-by-county 2024 primary election results\n\nMilitary veteran Semi Bird also is a key figure in the race after being endorsed by the Washington State Republican Party. But he has become a polarizing figure amid accusations of mischaracterizing his military service, as well as a guilty plea to bank larceny in 1993 for putting his father's name and social security number on a credit application. Bird said he has not been convicted of a crime since then and regrets what he did.\n\nDemocrat Mark Mullet, a state senator from Issaquah, also has garnered attention as a moderate candidate who would bring the perspective of a small business owner.\n\nThe success of a Republican candidate in the governor's race will depend on their ability to build crossover appeal to independent voters and moderate Democratic voters, said Sandeep Kaushik, a Democratic political consultant with Sound View Strategies.\n\n\"The only way a Republican can win a statewide race in Washington state is if they convince voters in the middle of the state, who lean blue, that they’re a different kind of Republican and willing to meet those voters halfway, willing to break with MAGA, break with the Republican Party,\" he said. \"Reichert has done none of that, so far as I can see.\"\n\nThe campaign between Ferguson and Reichert has consistently focused on abortion. Ferguson’s team often references Reichert’s history of voting for a nationwide ban on abortion starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy as evidence of him being \"wildly out of touch with the majority of Washingtonians.\"\n\nAbortion has long been legal in Washington until viability, a determination left up to the judgment of a health care provider, and after that in cases where the pregnant individual's health or life is threatened.\n\nReichert has pushed back on Ferguson’s characterization and said his only plan for the state’s abortion law if elected governor is to enforce and support it. He accused Ferguson of trying to scare women into not voting for him.\n\nReichert said as governor he would prioritize public safety, referencing his 33 years, including two terms as sheriff, at the King County Sheriff’s Office and the dozens of sheriffs who have endorsed him.\n\nHe was the first King County detective assigned to the case of the Green River Killer, named for the waterway where the first bodies were found in 1982. Gary Ridgway, who killed 49 women, was arrested and convicted in 2003 during Reichert’s second term as sheriff.\n\nReichert said he also would focus on curbing homelessness, as the Seattle area has one of the nation’s highest rates of homelessness. He suggested moving people from the streets to state-owned land, including McNeil Island, where a facility for sexual predators is located.\n\n\"You tell me which one is more ridiculous: Living under a freeway in tents or maybe making a nice, warm, comfortable place on McNeil Island or Evergreen College,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nFerguson was endorsed by state Democratic leaders, including U.S. Senate Pro Tempore Patty Murray and Gov. Jay Inslee, the longest serving governor in office in the country, is not seeking a fourth term. Ferguson points to his record as attorney general, including reaching multi-million dollar settlements with major opioid entities and standing up to former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Republican state Rep. J.T. Wilcox said people in Washington state may be looking for a major leadership change after three terms of Inslee.\n\n\"Presidents usually leave office not at a high point, but at a point when people are sort of ready for them to be gone,\" Wilcox said. \"I think that that may have happened a little bit with Gov. Inslee. Twelve years, people feel like, ‘OK we’ve had all this, I’m getting tired of all the same rhetoric, maybe it is time for a change.’\"\n\nWashington is a vote-by-mail state and many voters have already cast their ballots before Election Day.\n\nLive primary election results for Washington state\n\nGet election results for other races in the 2024 primary election in Washington.\n\nMORE FOX 13 SEATTLE NEWS\n\nPierce County deputies disrupt international cockfighting ring in Buckley, WA\n\nMan pleads not guilty in deadly shooting of Kent 13-year-old\n\nFired Seattle cop files $20M tort complaint against city\n\nDestructive fire in Graham possibly started from fireworks\n\nPioneer Fire now a quarter-mile from Stehekin, Level 3 Evacuations in place\n\nCARES programs help take strain off WA emergency departments\n\nWorkers at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo prepare for strike"
