        "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Of the 56 people Gov. John Bel Edwards has pardoned since October, 41 were convicted of murder.\n\nFour of those are Southwest Louisiana cases - three out of Calcasieu and one out of Jeff Davis Parish.\n\nIn Calcasieu, David Wade Foy, 70, was convicted of murder in the 1970s; Herbert James Fuselier, 55, was convicted of second-degree murder in 1990; and Darryl Sterling, 62, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1992.\n\nNeal Spencer, 53, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Jeff Davis Parish in 1991.\n\nDAVID WADE FOY\n\nDavid Wade Foy, 70, convicted of murder, currently has a projected good-time release of Oct. 8, 2027.\n\nFoy was an inmate of the Louisiana Correctional Institute when he escaped from a work crew near Lake Charles on Sept. 9, 1972. He went into a residence and changed clothes, but fled, leaving his prison clothes behind, when an occupant of the residence returned.\n\nA short time later, Sylvester Keller, the operator of Pat’s Garage, was found dead and his car missing. Foy was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death.\n\nThe death sentence, though, was vacated by the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal, and he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe life sentence was then commuted to 99 years in prison, with eligibility to seek parole. He currently has a projected good-time release date of Oct. 8, 2027, and a full-term release date of July 7, 2077.\n\nHERBERT JAMES FUSELIER\n\nHerbert James Fuselier, 55, was convicted in October 1990 of second-degree murder in the shooting death of 60-year-old Lake Charles man George Ruckstuhl.\n\nFuselier, then 22, was sentenced to life in prison without benefit of parole.\n\nAccording to American Press reporting from 1990, Fuselier shot Ruckstuhl in the head with a 9mm on March 13, 1990, while Ruckstuhl was watching TV in the bedroom of his home on Locke Lane. Fuselier then dragged his body to a greenhouse, where it was found the following evening.\n\nFuselier claimed Ruckstuhl had raped him more than three years prior after picking him up as a runaway. Fuselier’s defense claimed he had PTSD from the alleged rape. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but jurors rejected that charge.\n\nFuselier is currently being held at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.\n\nNEAL SPENCER\n\nNeal Spencer, Jr., of Beaumont, was 20 years old when he was convicted of stabbing 15-year-old McQuinn Walker to death in Jennings on Thursday, June 6, 1991.\n\nSpencer was originally charged with first-degree murder on July 10, 1991, but he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree murder on August 5, 1991. He was sentenced that same day to life without the possibility of parole.\n\nSpencer, now 53, is currently held at Grant Parish Detention Center.\n\nDARRELL (DARRYL?) STERLING\n\nDarryl Sterling, 62, of Lake Charles, pleaded guilty in January of 1992 to second-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old James Batiste, whose stabbed and beaten body was found in a south Lake Charles drainage ditch on May 8, 1991.\n\nThe murder was believed to be drug-related, according to American Press archives.\n\nSterling was sentenced to life without the possibility of probation, parole or suspension of sentence, the mandatory sentencing for second-degree murder, but had his sentence commuted to 99 years and was immediately eligible to seek parole.\n\nSterling is currently being held at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola."
