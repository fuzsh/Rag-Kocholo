        "text": "Wood Technologies International announced that President Dale Brown has been appointed CEO of the company, succeeding Craig Tompkins who now serves as a Strategic Advisor to the Board of Directors of Wood Technologies.\n\n“We are proud to have Dale step into this role after eight years of leadership at the company,” comments Rob Sivitilli, Chairman of the Board of Wood Technologies. “We thank Craig for his efforts at leading the effective integration efforts after the merger of USNR and Wood Fiber Group and for helping drive two subsequent complementary acquisitions, all which built Wood Technologies into an industry leader today.”\n\nBrown has had a 37-year tenure with Wood Technologies and predecessor company USNR, starting his career there in 1986 as an accounting data entry clerk, working his way up through various roles in USNR’s accounting, sales and executive operations departments. His past positions include Chief Accountant, Controller, Vice President, Senior Vice President, and CEO of USNR in 2018. Brown was named President of Wood Technologies upon the USNR/Wood Fiber Group merger in 2021.\n\nTompkins helped spearhead the merger of Wood Technologies’ predecessor companies USNR and Wood Fiber Group in November 2021. Tompkins also helped lead and integrate Wood Technologies’ July 2022 acquisitions of Timber Automation and The Knife Source.\n\n“I am immensely proud of my time at Wood Technologies, where I got to work with fantastic people— including Dale—over the past eight years,” Tompkins says. “With Dale at the helm, I can walk away confident that the company is in great hands and that it will achieve even greater success.”"
