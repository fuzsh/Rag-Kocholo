        "text": "For other people named Dale Brown, see Dale Brown (disambiguation).\n\nAmerican writer\n\nDale Brown (born November 2, 1956) is an American writer and aviator known for aviation techno-thriller novels.[1] At least thirteen[2] of his novels have been New York Times Best Sellers.[3][4]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown was born in Buffalo, New York, and was one of six children. At 15, he began flying instruction, eventually earning a private pilot's license.[5] He graduated in 1978 from Penn State University with a degree in Western European history.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMilitary\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown joined the Air Force ROTC while in college.[5] He received a commission in the United States Air Force in 1978. He was a navigator-bombardier (now known as a weapon systems officer (WSO)) in the B-52G Stratofortress long-range heavy bomber and the FB-111A Aardvark medium range fighter-bomber.\n\nBrown received several military decorations and awards, including the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Combat Crew Award, and the Marksmanship ribbon. He rose to the rank of Captain and has 2,500 hours of flight time in B-52s.[5]\n\nHe left the Air Force in 1986, having never seen combat.[6] He is a Life Member of the Air Force Association and the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown's first paid writing was a review of Fort Apocalypse for Compute!'s Gazette. In 1986, while still in the Air Force at Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, he wrote his first book, Flight of the Old Dog.[5] His novels have been published in 11 languages and distributed to over 70 countries. He published 11 bestsellers in 11 years.[7]\n\nBrown has been represented by literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group.[citation needed]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown tends to stay with the same characters over a long period of time. Many of the characters introduced in Flight of the Old Dog are still around for the latest, although a few have been killed in previous books. Most of his books occur in the same timeline, with a few exceptions.\n\nSilver Tower, published after Flight of the Old Dog, a mostly independent novel with no character references, is first linked by mention of the SkyBolt module in Battle Born. However, the novel is merged into the Patrick McLanahan saga when some of its main characters and the fictional military space station Armstrong appear in Strike Force.\n\nChains of Command, which features Rebecca Furness and Darren Mace, was actually a separate series, but later, the characters reappeared in Battle Born and were merged into the Dreamland and McLanahan series.\n\nHammerheads focuses on Admiral Ian Hardcastle, who later reappeared in Storming Heaven. However, the book can be part of the overall Patrick McLanahan continuity because of his and General Elliott's appearances, plus the book taking place over two years since the events of Flight of the Old Dog (which is referred to in passing).\n\nThe Dreamland series coauthored with Jim DeFelice covers the gaps between the Patrick McLanahan series novels. While most of the old characters are only mentioned in passing, some of the technology depicted in the series was later merged into the main series, starting with Air Battle Force.\n\nHenri Cazaux, the main villain of Storming Heaven, was referred to in The Tin Man. His own right-hand man, Gregory Townsend, would be the book's main antagonist.\n\nPatrick McLanahan series\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown's novels mostly center on a character named Patrick McLanahan, whose exploits as a US Air Force officer date back over 25 years.\n\nFlight of the Old Dog (1987) - A Soviet anti-ballistic missile laser destroys US strategic assets while the Kremlin argues the system's legality before the UN. USAF Lieutenant General Bradley Elliott recruits a team of officers to work on a modified B-52 bomber, called the Old Dog. A raid on Dreamland, itself coupled by the discovery of a B-1 Lancer strike team on the Soviet laser, forces the Old Dog crew to take the mission on themselves. In a heroic act, crewmember David Luger risks his life to save the bomber from destruction.\n\nSky Masters (1991) - The pullout of US forces from the Philippines in 1994 sparks Chinese plans to occupy the Spratly Islands and Mindanao with the connivance of a Filipino Communist vice-president who declares a coup. McLanahan and the heavy bombers of the US Air Battle Force lead the American counterattack over Davao City. The novel also has a small cameo appearance by Day of the Cheetah antagonist Kenneth Francis James.\n\nNight of the Hawk (1992) - A simple defector extraction raid in Lithuania in late 1992 uncovers evidence that a member of the Old Dog crew, David Luger, survived the events of Flight of the Old Dog and was brainwashed to work on a new stealth bomber at a secret facility in Vilnius. Amidst the political upheaval in the country, General Elliott, McLanahan, and John Ormack join a US Marine contingent in assaulting the facility and rescuing Luger.\n\nDay of the Cheetah (1989) - In 1996, Kenneth Francis James - a Soviet deep-cover agent posing as a USAF officer - steals the new Dreamstar thought-controlled fighter. McLanahan and the High-Technology Aerospace Weapons Center scramble to recover it from James, or destroy it if necessary.\n\nShadows of Steel (1996) - In May 1997, the US initiates covert operations to stop Iran's new carrier task force from controlling the Persian Gulf sea lanes. Now running a diner in Sacramento after the fiasco depicted in Day of the Cheetah, Patrick McLanahan is recalled to active duty to fly a B-2 Spirit mission over Iran.\n\nFatal Terrain (1997) - Set a month after the ending of Shadows of Steel, Taiwan's declaration of independence forces China to go to war. The Old Dog crew is brought back to save the world from Chinese domination, but not everyone could come home alive.\n\nThe Tin Man (1998) - A few months after the events of Fatal Terrain, Patrick McLanahan faces a new enemy, right in his home turf in Sacramento, California. The novel also introduces his brother, Sacramento police officer Paul McLanahan.\n\nBattle Born (1999) - In 2000, McLanahan is assigned to turn a group of Nevada Air Guard B-1 pilots into America's premier tactical air strike force. A new threat created by a sudden reunification of the Korean peninsula hastens the training.\n\nWarrior Class (2001) - Set in 2001, Russian billionaire Pavel Kazakov builds a huge pipeline through the Balkans with the support of the Russian Army and everybody gets rich. To make the scheme viable, he also finances the deployment of a secret stealth fighter-bomber originally developed by the same company that employed Dave Luger. However, a new US president and his brand of leadership tie McLanahan's hands from doing anything about Kazakov.\n\nWings of Fire (2002) - When Libya plots to invade and control Egypt, McLanahan and his advanced force, the Night Stalkers, are sent in to stop the chaos. However, the consequences are personal for his family.\n\nAir Battle Force (2003) - The US deploys a new aerial strike force into Turkmenistan to fight a ragtag Taliban army and later a Russian invasion. The humiliation forces Russian General Anatoly Gryzlov to launch a coup, especially after McLanahan's forces level the Russian Air Force's strategic bomber base in Engels.\n\nPlan of Attack (2004) - Out of revenge for what happened in Air Battle Force, General Gryzlov orders a nuclear bomber strike against the United States, eliminating nearly all of its land-based strategic forces. Demoted to brigadier general and reassigned off the Air Battle Force after defying one order too many in Turkmenistan, McLanahan tries to convince the Air Force leadership about the threat. When the Russians attack, he and the rest of the Dreamland crew take matters into their own hands to save what is left of America.\n\nStrike Force (2007) - Three years after the events of Plan of Attack, now-Lieutenant General McLanahan uses new XR-A9 Black Stallion spaceplanes to intervene during a new crisis in Iran, where Shadows of Steel antagonist General Hesarak al-Buzhazi has launched a rebellion against the fundamentalist regime.\n\nShadow Command (2008) - Set in 2009, the novel pits McLanahan and his team against a new US president, Joseph Gardner, who connives with Russia to take him down.\n\nRogue Forces (2009) - Reverting to the private sector, Patrick McLanahan and former US President Kevin Martindale operate their own Private military company (PMC), Scion Aviation International. Their latest contract: stabilizing Iraq as US forces withdraw from the country. However, Kurdish raids into Turkey force Ankara to unleash its arsenal of former US aircraft against the rebels and McLanahan's team is caught in the crossfire.\n\nExecutive Intent (2010) - The US deploys a new orbital bombardment system, the Thor's Hammer, with a Pakistani ballistic-missile battery hijacked by terrorists firing on Indian cities as the first target. However, some of the missiles destroys a chemical weapon, of which the chemicals injure civilians, which prompts Pakistan and nearby countries to help grant Indian Ocean access to China and Russia. McLanahan must join forces with Brigadier-General Kai Raydon to prevent war. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Kenneth Phoenix begins challenging President Gardner's leadership.\n\nA Time For Patriots (2011) - An economic collapse in late 2012 triggers destabilization efforts in the entire country.

Meanwhile, back in the US, Colonel Norman Weir, an officer on the USAF promotions board, reviews McLanahan's service record as a candidate for lieutenant colonel and recommends his discharge. However, the US president orders Weir to destroy the discharge form, saying that McLanahan has proven himself as an officer (without elaborating further). The story was Brown's contribution to Stephen Coonts' Combat war stories anthology. It has peripheral references to Hammerheads and Sky Masters (although a canonical error).\n\nDreamland series\n\n[edit]\n\nBrown and Jim DeFelice have created more than a dozen Dale Brown's Dreamland books.\n\nDreamland (2001)\n\nNerve Center (2002)\n\nRazor's Edge (2002)\n\nPiranha (2003)\n\nStrike Zone (2004)\n\nArmageddon (2004)\n\nSatan's Tail (2005)\n\nEnd Game (2006)\n\nRetribution (2007)\n\nRevolution (2008)\n\nWhiplash (2009)\n\nBlack Wolf (2010)\n\nRaven Strike (2011)\n\nCollateral Damage (2012)\n\nDrone Strike (2014)\n\nTarget Utopia (2015)\n\nPuppet Master (2016)\n\nAct of Revenge (2018)\n\nNick Flynn series\n\n[edit]\n\nArctic Storm Rising (2021)\n\nCountdown to Midnight (2022)\n\nWeapons of Opportunity (2023)\n\nThe Devil’s Fortress (2024)\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, Brown resided in Folsom, California,[5] near Sacramento, California.\n\nHe enjoys flying his plane, a Cessna P337 Skymaster. He is a squadron commander and mission pilot in the Civil Air Patrol.[8] On the ground, he enjoys tennis, motorcycling, skiing, scuba diving, and ice hockey.\n\nBrown is married. His wife Diane is a retired Sacramento police lieutenant and (like her husband) is also a pilot.[9] They have a son, Hunter, and they reside near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.[9]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2004, Brown pleaded guilty to charges of tax fraud. He was charged with creating companies in the West Indies for the purposes of receiving tax deductions from fictitious expenses. The fictitious expenses amounted to more than $440,000, which Brown claimed on his 1998 income tax filing. He then used the tax deductions to remodel his home in Incline Village, Nevada.[10]\n\nBrown was sentenced to 6 months house arrest and were suspended after 5 months. He was sentenced to 5 years probation and were suspended after 3 years. His voting privileges will be restored in 2026.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
