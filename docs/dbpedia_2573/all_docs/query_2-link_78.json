        "meta_description": "“When a subject intrigues me, I not only attempt to paint it visually but also spiritually. This is what separates an artist from a painter. The artist strives for the viewer to understand how the subject made him feel. Knowledge gives us the tools to paint and our spirit makes us an artist. When the viewer senses my emotions in a painting, then I have succeeded.” ROGER DALE BROWN, OPAM, AISM, ASMA,ARCLM, PAPA Roger Dale Brown grew up in Tennessee, exploring the woods, creeks and fields around his Nashville home, a passionate observer of every aspect of nature since early childhood. He has made it his life’s work to connect deeply to places around the world, incorporating knowledge of their nature, history, architecture and culture in his creative process, and reflecting that knowledge in his painting and writing.Roger’s art education has consisted of countless hours studying historical artists such as John Carlson, Arthur Streeton, Isaac Levitan and John Singer Sargent and concentrated his study with master teachers over the years. Roger has developed his own style, which draws deeply from the Impressionist view that painting from life is essential. This determination and dedication has culminated in his receiving Master Status with three top painting organizations in one year. The organizations who recognized him are Oil Painters of America, American Impressionist Society, and American Society of Marine Artist.Roger has a deep commitment to passing on his knowledge of the artistic process to his students. His self-directed education has given Roger a unique ability to recognize a student’s struggles and an ability to guide the learning process in clear and understandable ways. A celebrated teacher, he has led close to 100 workshops from Maine to Montana in the United States, and abroad in Ecuador, Italy and Scotland. His teaching includes live demonstrations as well as on-location, figurative, studio and still-life classes.Roger has been honored to serve as juror for art and plein air competitions for Oil Painters of America, the American Impressionist Society and others across the country. When not traveling to paint or teach, he lives with his artist wife and two dogs in Franklin, Tennessee, and teaches in his home studio.“To capture the essence of a scene and make viewers feel they can step into a different day and understand its mood and beauty is my goal.”Among his many awards, Roger has received Best of Show in the Barnes and Farms National Juried Art Show, Museum Purchase Award at the Easton Plein Air Competition, Award of Excellence in the Master Category at the American Impressionist National Show, as well as the Gold Medal Award from the Hudson Valley Art Association. His work has also been accepted in national juried exhibitions with both Oil Painters of America and the American Impressionist Society where he received Artist Choice Award. He was also a finalist in the Art Renewal Center Salon. In addition, Roger has been published by International Artist Magazine, American Artist Magazine, American Art Collector Magazine, Plein-Air Magazine and the Artist Magazine.Roger’s oil paintings hang in the permanent collections of Tennessee State Museum and other museums throughout the United States and are held in several prominent galleries around the country. He was given Associate Living Master Status with the Art Renewal Center in 2015, and was awarded Signature Member of the American Society of Marine Artists in 2017 and received Fellow status in 2019. In 2018 Roger was awarded Master Status with Oil Painters of America and the American Impressionist Society in 2018. His latest honor, in 2020, Roger was asked to join the prominent plein air organization, PAPA (Plein Air Painters of America). Website: www.rogerdalebrown.com",
