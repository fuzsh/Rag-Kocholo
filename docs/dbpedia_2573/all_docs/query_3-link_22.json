        "text": "Blackburn magistrates heard the devices had been confiscated for further examination but Dale Brown had admitted to police he had been using them to view indecent images of children.\n\nBrown, 31, of Amersham Grove, Burnley, pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching a sexual harm prevention order. He was committed on bail to Burnley Crown Court to be sentenced on November 26.\n\nTracy Yates, prosecuting, said officers carried out a compliance visit and examined the two devices. The MacBook had no browsing history as far back as June and the Samsung showed no history although it was clearly in regular use."
