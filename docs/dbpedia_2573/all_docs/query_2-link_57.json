        "text": "Physician Bio:\n\nDr. Dale Brown is a fellowship-trained and board-certified ophthalmologist, sub-specializing in medical and surgical treatment of conditions affecting the retina and vitreous. Dr. Brown has a personal interest in retinal and vitreous diseases, including research on retinal microaneurysms treatment, which he presented at the national Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) meeting.\n\nHis connections to Alabama are strong, as he and his wife were both born and raised in areas right outside of Birmingham. They have three children â€“ two boys and a girl. He and his family are actively involved in their church.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being an eye doctor/surgeon? Due to the chronic retina diseases we treat, I enjoy the relationships I have with patients while treating them through multiple visits.\n\nIf you were not in medicine, what career would you pursue? Country Music"
