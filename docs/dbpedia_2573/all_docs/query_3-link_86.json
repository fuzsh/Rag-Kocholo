        "text": "Summary of Case:\n\n\"Daniel Brown aka Danny Brown was wrongly convicted of the 1981 rape and murder of a Toledo, Ohio woman he had been dating for several months. Danny Brown conviction was based on the eyewitness identification of the victim's shaken six-year old son, who only briefly saw the attacker. The trial judge characterized the boy's testimony as riddled with \"glaring inconsistencies.\" (CM website). DNA testing excluded Daniel Brown as the attacker and identified the actual killer as a man serving a life sentence for a similar 1982 rape/murder. Daniel Brown was released on April 9, 2001.\""
