Governments sometimes impose economic sanctions on political adversaries to influence their behavior. State leaders sometimes limit economic ties with enemies, or potential enemies, because they worry that trade and investment ties will make those rivals stronger militarily. And the possibility that political conflict today could escalate to military violence tomorrow makes trade in the presence of conflict a potentially risky undertaking. Many well-known empirical cases demonstrate clearly the negative effects political conflict can have on commerce. During the Cold War, Western countries, led by the United States, placed strict limits on trade with the Eastern Bloc. Trade between India and Pakistan declined drastically in the years after partition. United States technological exports to China are more regulated and controversial than similar exports to U.S. allies.1 Political conflict across the Middle East has been a barrier to commercial integration in that region for decades. And numerous recent quantitative studies have found that international political conflict, measured in a variety of ways, harms trade.2 In short, it appears that trade, at least some of the time, tends to follow the flag. But the effect of conflict on commerce is hardly universal. Rather, economic relations can blossom, and sometimes flourish, even in the face of intense political and military rivalry. On the eve of the First World War, for example, Great Britain and Germany had an extensive commercial relationship (Papayoanou ). During the Cold War, West Germany sought enhanced, rather than reduced, levels of trade with rivals in Eastern Europe (Davis ); South Korea pursues similar policies toward North Korea today. Economic integration between Singapore\n\nintroduction\n\nand Malaysia is substantial despite the sometimes icy relationship shared by the two states. And economic ties between China and Taiwan flourish despite intense political rivalry. Indeed, economic integration across the Taiwan Strait actually accelerated even as political relations grew considerably worse after the mids. Why is it that political conflict sometimes undermines commercial relations between countries but that, at other times, economic ties can come to flourish despite even intense political hostility? The question is important. Economic flows between countries can have a large impact on the well-being of those countries’ inhabitants. In the China-Taiwan case, for example, inflows of foreign investment and access to foreign markets have become central to China’s rapid economic development (Lardy ), and Taiwan has been a major supplier of overseas capital for the Mainland. Had conflict interfered more with cross-Strait economic integration, the development paths of both economies over the past twenty years could well have been significantly different. Furthermore, many argue that economic integration reduces the likelihood of military conflict (e.g. Russett and Oneal ).To the extent that economic integration does make military violence less likely, it is important to understand how economic ties can come to thrive in the shadow of political conflict to begin with.\n\n. Conflict and Economic Integration in Three Contemporary Military Rivalries Consider, briefly, the relationship between political conflict and economic integration in three contemporary cases characterized by political tensions and military rivalry: India and Pakistan; North and South Korea; and Mainland China and Taiwan. At the heart of all three rivalries is a dispute relating to territorial sovereignty: the status of Kashmir in India-Pakistan relations; the terms of reunification in the relationship between the two Koreas; and the sovereign status of Taiwan in the relationship across the Taiwan Strait. In all three cases, conflict is serious and persistent, and has at times become militarized. Political conflict has influenced the nature of economic interactions in each relationship. But the effects of conflict have varied greatly across the cases. The relationship between India and Pakistan epitomizes the detrimental effect international political conflict can have on cross-border economic flows. At the time of partition, when British India was divided into the two new states, trade between India and Pakistan was substantial. Roughly  percent of Pakistan’s total imports came from India, for example. Yet bilateral trade declined drastically in the turbulent years that followed partition and has typically represented less than\n\nintroduction\n\n percent of both countries’ total trade since the s. Over the years leaders from both sides have been quite willing to politicize economic flows between the two countries. Officials in Pakistan, for example, have repeatedly linked a normalized trading relationship with India to a resolution of the Kashmir dispute. At times of heightened crisis, moreover, both governments have had a tendency to undermine bilateral linkages as a means to punish the other side or to demonstrate resolve. For example, both sides severed bilateral trade ties when war erupted in . Likewise, when tensions rose in , both sides severed transportation links between the two countries. In short, political frictions between India and Pakistan have had a profound and lasting impact on their bilateral economic relations. On the surface, the relationship between the two Koreas appears quite similar to the India-Pakistan case. Here too economic linkages remain sparse against a backdrop of intense political rivalry. Until the late s South Korea banned all trade with the North, and even in recent years bilateral flows represent a fraction of a percent of South Korea’s total trade. Though inexpensive labor, combined with shared culture and language, should make North Korea an ideal destination for South Korean investments, these too remain limited. The North remains one of the most autarkic countries in the world. Pyongyang’s unwillingness to commit strongly and credibly to deep economic reforms, along with its tendency to allow political and security concerns to drive its economic interactions with the South, mean that investment in North Korea is fraught with uncertainty and risk. But a closer inspection reveals some cracks in the ice. In particular, South Korea’s economic policies toward the North have changed dramatically in recent years. After authorizing bilateral trade in the late s, and loosening investment restrictions to some extent in the mid-s, Seoul in  adopted a new policy—called the Sunshine Policy—that actively encouraged economic linkages with the North. Under the policy, South Korea refrains from using economic instruments to punish North Korean behavior; this effort to keep politics and economics on separate tracks remained in effect even during the recent standoff involving the North’s nuclear weapons program. Seoul’s engagement policy has achieved some successes: trade, though still limited, has nearly doubled. Thousands of South Korean tourists visit Mount Kumgang in North Korea each year. And over twenty South Korean firms have set up operations in an industrial park in North Korea, which was constructed using South Korean funds. Economic ties remain weak, but there are some signs that things may be changing. Things have certainly changed dramatically on the south side of the border. Like the other two cases, the relationship across the Taiwan Strait is characterized by intense political conflict and military rivalry. Chinese missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in  and Beijing’s steady buildup of offensive military\n\nintroduction\n\ncapabilities directed at Taiwan since the early s provide continuing evidence that cross-Strait political conflict is serious. As in the other two cases, bilateral political conflict has had an impact on the bilateral economic relationship. Largely because relations with the Mainland have been tense, Taiwanese leaders have tried to limit the extent of cross-Strait economic integration; they worry in part that the Taiwanese economy might become too dependent on the Mainland’s, and hence vulnerable to explicit or implicit sanctioning threats.Taiwanese officials also express concern that high-tech investments in China by Taiwanese firms may tilt the military balance in Beijing’s favor. Despite these concerns, cross-Strait commercial relations have grown rapidly; Taiwanese economic policy toward the Mainland has in fact varied considerably since the late s. Broadly speaking, the scope of Taiwanese restrictions on cross-Strait trade and investment flows has decreased over time. And since the late s, Taiwanese investors have flocked to a booming Chinese economy that is increasingly integrated into global markets and that has welcomed these investors with open arms. Mainland China is, by far, the largest recipient of Taiwan’s foreign direct investment, and in recent years China surpassed the United States to become Taiwan’s largest trade partner. Taiwanese companies continued to pour investments into the Mainland market even as bilateral tensions rose substantially in the run-up to and aftermath of the  Taiwanese presidential election. Taiwanese businesses, evidently, are confident that their Mainland investments will remain secure and profitable even during times when bilateral political relations sour considerably. These three cases illustrate the basic question that motivates this book: Why does international political conflict sometimes suffocate international economic flows, as in the case of India-Pakistan relations, but not at other times? In the case of China and Taiwan, economic ties have come to flourish despite a hostile political landscape. When tensions grow in India-Pakistan relations, both sides sometimes signal their resolve by taking steps—like severing transport links—that harm bilateral economic ties. But during times of turbulence in the cross-Strait case, Chinese leaders appear to bend over backwards to emphasize their commitment to protect the rights and interests of Taiwanese investors. To an increasing extent, it seems, the political and economic relationships across the Taiwan Strait operate in separate spheres. This book explores how such a state of affairs can arise.\n\n. Existing Approaches The relationship between international political conflict and economic interdependence has long attracted substantial scholarly interest, and remains the subject\n\nintroduction\n\nof vigorous debate. Much of the recent literature focuses more specifically on the relationship between trade and military conflict, in particular the extent to which increased trade between countries reduces the likelihood of military conflict. At the forefront of recent interest in the subject has been a series of works by Oneal and Russett, who make the liberal case that trade (in addition to democracy and international organizations) has a pacific effect (Oneal and Russett ; a; ; Russett and Oneal ). Nonetheless, the liberal hypothesis remains controversial on both theoretical and empirical grounds (e.g. Barbieri ; ; Gartzke ).3 In Chapter , I consider the impact of economic interdependence on military conflict and examine whether the growing economic relationship across the Taiwan Strait reduces the danger of war there. But the primary purpose of this study is to treat economic interdependence as the dependent variable—to consider, that is, how and when conflict influences international economic ties. Studies considering this reverse relationship again tend to focus primarily on trade and military conflict in particular. Recent studies have shown, for example, that militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) have a negative impact on trade (Keshk et al. ; Oneal et al. ), though Morrow and others () find that MIDs have an insignificant impact on trade flows in a study limited to the great powers. Morrow () suggests that this result might arise because forward-looking economic actors anticipate potential disputes and thus limit exposure prior to the fact; Li and Sacko () find empirical support for this proposition, showing that unexpected military disputes have a negative effect on trade while expected ones do not. More-recent studies have used simultaneous models to assess the direction of causality between militarized disputes and trade. Keshk and others () apply such a model to a large sample and find that, while military disputes have a negative impact on commerce, trade has no significant effect on the likelihood of a militarized dispute.4 Other studies suggest that wars, and especially major-power wars, also have a negative impact on trade (Anderton and Carter ; Glick and Taylor ), though this effect does not appear to be universal: Levy and Barbieri (; Barbieri and Levy ) demonstrate that wartime trade sometimes thrives, suggesting that war’s impact on trade is likely contingent on a host of other factors. But it is also clear that conflict does not have to be militarized to affect trade. Pollins (a; b), for example, has used events data to show that pairs of countries with relatively cooperative political interactions tend to trade more with each other than pairs of countries with more hostile interactions. Other studies show that states with conflicting interests or goals—operationalized in a variety of ways—trade less with each other, on balance, than states whose goals are not in conflict. Simmons (), for example, finds that territorial disputes have a\n\nintroduction\n\nnegative impact on trade, and Long (a) finds that strategic rivalry also has a negative effect. Some studies suggest that allies trade more with each other than with other states, though the findings here are mixed.5 Other studies investigate the impact of conflict using more general proxies for state interests. For example, Dixon and Moon () find that the United States trades more with countries that vote as it does in the United Nations General Assembly than with states that do not. Morrow and others () show that countries with similar alliance portfolios—taken as a broad indicator of national security interests—trade more with each other than do countries with dissimilar portfolios. The existing literature on the effects of conflict on economic interdependence has several shortcomings, which this study seeks to address. First, there has been little effort to explain variation in the relationship between conflict and commerce. Most existing studies have simply asked whether conflict affects trade, and if so, by how much.6 But growing economic integration across the Taiwan Strait, despite very intense political conflict, suggests that it is equally important to consider when conflict affects trade. The primary purpose of this study is to develop and test hypotheses in this regard. Second, as also suggested by Barbieri and Schneider (), existing studies have not gone far enough in linking the relationship between conflict and trade to the expansive literature on the domestic determinants of trade policy. This is a curious omission given the similarity of the dependent variable in the two literatures. The role of protectionism, for example, should at a minimum be controlled for in quantitative analyses, and may in fact intervene in the relationship between conflict and trade in important ways. This project explicitly links the study of conflict and trade to the vast literature on the domestic determinants of foreign economic policy (e.g. Frieden ; Rogowski ; Simmons ; Hiscox ). Finally, the literature on conflict and trade is dominated by large-sample quantitative analyses, with less attention paid to the detailed study of particular cases. This may indeed be why so little attention has been paid to the puzzle laid out above. Quantitative analysis is an important component of hypothesis testing, and is utilized in Chapter  of this study. But detailed case studies can help identify causal processes that are difficult to capture in very large-sample analyses, which is particularly pertinent in a study like this where the relevant question is not whether conflict affects trade but, rather, when it does.\n\n. Defining Conflict As the previous section should make clear, conflict can be thought of in different ways. For the purposes of this project, I choose to define conflict broadly, as the extent to which the political goals or interests of two countries diverge. Conflict\n\nintroduction\n\ndefined in this way can be thought of as a continuum. At one end, conflict is low between states that share a range of interests to which they are deeply committed. Here we might think of cases like the United States and the United Kingdom, or the United States and Canada. This is not to suggest that there is no conflict in such relationships but rather that conflicting interests are generally minor compared to shared interests. At the opposite end of the continuum, conflict is high between states that share few interests, and where each state pursues goals that cannot be attained without undermining the objectives of the other state. The three case studies considered in this book—China-Taiwan, India-Pakistan, and North Korea–South Korea—all involve conflict that lies at this end of the continuum, as I will explain more fully in later chapters. In Chapter , I discuss this measure of conflict in more detail, considering some of its benefits and drawbacks.\n\n. The Argument in Brief The primary hypothesis advanced in this study is that the effect of conflict on economic interdependence is contingent on the nature of domestic ruling coalitions within the states enmeshed in conflict. I begin my argument by drawing from the existing literature to specify two broad causal mechanisms through which conflict might affect international economic ties. First, economic ties between countries can have security-related consequences (Gowa ). Trade, for example, can supply an enemy with important military technologies, or it can make a country vulnerable to sanctioning threats. As such, state leaders sometimes place restrictions on foreign economic ties in the presence of conflict. Second, conflict makes international economic exchange more risky for the firms engaged in such exchange: states with conflicting interests sometimes engage in costly competitions (like war, in extreme cases) that can be disrupting to economic flows. The added risk leads to reduced levels of economic integration in the presence of conflict (Morrow ). I hypothesize that conflict’s effects on international economic flows are more muted when the leaders of the countries in question are politically accountable to internationalist economic interests—those that support and gain from integration into the world economy. There are two reasons for this. First, leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests confront a tradeoff when considering restrictions on commerce, which leaders less accountable to such interests do not face. Suppose a leader who is politically accountable to internationalist economic interests recognizes that commercial ties with a strategic competitor undermine her ability to achieve her goals that are in conflict with that second state. Imagine, for example, that her country’s exports include products with military applications that can improve the military capabilities of\n\nintroduction\n\nthe second state. Imposing restrictions on commerce with the second state may help the leader attain her international goals, but doing so may also undermine her domestic political support—since restrictions on foreign commerce inflict losses on her political supporters. A leader who is not accountable to internationalist economic interests, when facing the same international situation, would be less concerned by the domestic political implications of imposing commercial restrictions. Since she does not draw support from the potential losers resulting from foreign commercial restrictions, she need not in this instance worry about a trade-off between pursuing her international goals and maintaining political support domestically.The trade-off faced by leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests suggests that they are less likely than other leaders to impose restrictions on foreign economic ties in the shadow of conflict. Second, for similar reasons, when leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests wish to signal resolve to strategic competitors, they try to do so in ways that are not detrimental to foreign commerce. In demonstrating commitment to an international goal, leaders have a variety of means at their disposal. Some, such as sanctions, embargos, border-closings, and the like, are damaging to foreign economic ties. Others, like military buildups and exercises, recalling diplomats, and so forth, are less directly detrimental to international commerce. Though they do not always possess the flexibility to do so, leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests generally prefer to signal resolve in ways not detrimental to cross-border commerce. An action detrimental to foreign commerce is reserved as a last resort, when the stakes are very high, as a signal that is both very costly and very informative. Other leaders, who are less constrained politically, may choose to signal resolve in a way that is damaging to cross-border commerce in a much broader range of disputes—even when the stakes are low—because such signals are less costly. Independent economic agents factor this into the risk associated with commerce in the shadow of conflict. That is, the risk of commercial disruptions is lower when conflict is between internationalist regimes than when conflict is between non-internationalist regimes.\n\n. Plan for This Study The next chapter lays out my core theoretical argument. After expanding on the definition of conflict sketched out earlier, the chapter considers in more detail why conflict might be expected to affect cross-border economic flows. I then develop this study’s primary hypothesis, that the effects of conflict on commerce are conditioned by the nature of governing coalitions in the countries involved, in particular the extent to which internationalist economic interests exercise political power within such coalitions.\n\nintroduction\n\nChapters – then present an extensive case study of the political and economic relationship across the Taiwan Strait. Chapter  describes in more detail the nature of political conflict across the Taiwan Strait and discusses recent economic trends in the relationship. I argue that this case, in some respects, resembles a “least likely” test case for my hypotheses, and as such some generalization is possible. Chapter  examines evolving Taiwanese economic policies toward Mainland China since the late s.These policies have generally become more liberal over time, with some important exceptions. This is somewhat puzzling, since there is good reason to believe that cross-Strait economic integration may have negative security implications for Taiwan. Though numerous factors have shaped Taiwanese policies, I show evidence that policy shifts can be explained in part by changes in the political strength of internationalist economic interests in Taiwan. Chapter  considers Mainland China’s policy toward Taiwan. Given intense cross-Strait political conflict, how has the People’s Republic of China (PRC) been able to make credible its promises to protect the interests of Taiwanese investors? Crucially, while Beijing often tries to signal its resolve on the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty, it generally has aimed to do so in a way that does not affect the cross-Strait economic relationship. The PRC is governed by an increasingly internationalist coalition; signaling in a way that damages cross-Strait economic ties would be extremely costly. Beijing’s signaling behavior on the issue of Taiwan’s sovereignty, then, is broadly consistent with the theoretical argument developed in Chapter . Nonetheless, I also emphasize in Chapter  that the PRC’s cross-Strait economic policies are not simply a consequence of domestic political constraints faced by Chinese leaders. Rather, a realist logic also governs Beijing’s behavior: PRC officials seek to reassure Taiwanese investors—even during times of intense cross-Strait conflict—in part because they hope that growing economic ties will reinforce Beijing’s influence over Taiwan. Examining the PRC’s policies toward one class of Taiwanese investors—those sympathetic to Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party—offers an opportunity to sort out the relative importance of the realist logic and the political constraints logic in driving the PRC’s signaling behavior toward Taiwan. It appears that both causal logics are salient, and the chapter concludes with a reassessment of my core theoretical argument in light of the cross-Strait case. Chapter  then examines the implications of burgeoning cross-Strait economic ties for the political relationship between Mainland China and Taiwan (does economic interdependence make a cross-Strait military confrontation less likely?) and for the “economic interdependence promotes peace” hypothesis more generally. My approach here is to begin by identifying the precise causal mechanisms, drawn from the extant literature, through which growing economic ties could lead to peace. I then explore whether these different causal processes are operating across\n\n\n\nintroduction\n\nthe Taiwan Strait, while considering simultaneously the broader implications the cross-Strait experience might have for theories of commercial liberalism. Chapter  considers how well the theoretical argument developed in Chapter  generalizes beyond the Taiwan Strait. The chapter begins with a quantitative analysis of trade flows among seventy-six countries over the years –. The findings are encouraging, though I emphasize that considerable qualification is necessary due to difficulty in measuring key concepts in a large-sample framework. The chapter then considers the two other cases introduced earlier: India-Pakistan relations and the relationship on the Korean Peninsula. The IndiaPakistan relationship represents an interesting contrast to the cross-Strait case; here, internationalist economic interests have been more marginalized politically in the two countries, and conflict, in turn, has had a more substantial impact on bilateral economic exchange. The relationship between North and South Korea is more of a mixed dyad, where internationalist economic interests appear completely marginalized in the North, and more influential in the South. Economic integration remains limited in this case, but South Korea has promoted increased exchange in recent years. Taken together, the two cases offer further support for my primary hypothesis. Finally, Chapter  provides a brief summary of my main findings in this study and offers some suggestions for future research.\n\n2\n\nInternational Conflict, Domestic Politics, and Economic Interdependence Theory and Hypotheses\n\nUnder what conditions can economic ties flourish despite conflict between countries? Existing literature suggests two reasons why international political conflict might be expected to have a negative impact on commerce—this study’s dependent variable—in the first place: conflict makes governments more attentive to the security externalities that economic integration potentially entails, and conflict increases the risks faced by economic agents considering international commercial and financial ventures. These processes that dampen economic ties between rival states, however, are not constant; they may be stronger or weaker in different circumstances. This chapter introduces the central argument of the book: conflict between countries ruled by leaders who are relatively accountable to internationalist (pro-trade) economic actors is less likely to interfere with bilateral economic relations than it is in other cases. The chapter begins by expanding on the definition of conflict presented in Chapter , emphasizing that it is useful to distinguish between conflict and violence or other costly contests. Section  considers why conflict might be expected to harm international economic flows to begin with.Then, Section  develops the core hypothesis, that conflict’s effects on commerce are contingent on leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests. Section  concludes.\n\n. Conceptualizing International Political Conflict In the Introduction (Chapter ) I defined conflict broadly, as the extent to which the political goals or interests of two countries diverge. In thinking of conflict in\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nthis way, I am following Gartzke () in distinguishing it from the costly contests (like war, in extreme cases) that states sometimes pursue to resolve their points of conflict. This may seem like a strange or academic distinction, but the difference between conflict generally and violence in particular is critical to understanding why states that are adversaries might have deep economic ties. More specifically, not all serious conflicts escalate to shooting wars; many states that are adversaries go through long “cold wars” without ever getting to violence. However, it is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to know in advance whether or not any one particular conflict will turn violent (Gartzke ). The possibility of war is therefore in the minds of leaders and businesses considering trading in the shadow of conflict (this is detailed more fully later). Certainly violence itself is likely to have a direct impact on commercial exchange, but what about conflict without violence? There is good reason to believe that even the possibility of violence—arising from serious conflicts of interest—might also affect trade,1 and this impact may vary substantially across cases. Consider the relationship across the Taiwan Strait. The core puzzle in this case, as outlined in the previous chapter, is that economic ties between Mainland China and Taiwan flourish despite intense political tension over the issue of Taiwan’s sovereign status. The issue is important in both Beijing and Taipei, so important that leaders in Beijing have repeatedly vowed to fight a costly war to prevent the legal independence of Taiwan. The situation, in short, is potentially explosive; that commerce between the two sides thrives nonetheless—despite the catastrophic consequences war would entail—demands explanation. Conceptualizing conflict as the extent to which states’ core interests diverge allows for an examination of this puzzle in a way that a focus on costly contests, such as militarized disputes or war, does not, because the relationship in the Taiwan Strait has been free of military violence for decades. Moreover, a focus on militarized disputes, or war, also has the disadvantage of limiting the scope of inquiry to only the most serious conflicts. By thinking of conflict as a continuum, however, it is possible to investigate more fully how the severity of conflict affects commerce. As I explain later, even when states bargain over issues that have little or no chance of escalating to military violence the potential for some commercial disruption exists. While the disruption might be small relative to the disruption likely to occur in disputes that could escalate to war, it is nonetheless interesting and worth considering. On a conceptual level, in short, it makes sense to treat conflict as a continuum and to define it as the extent to which the goals of two countries diverge. In this approach, all international relations are likely to involve at least some conflict, but the severity of conflict should vary greatly across relationships.\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nThe primary drawback to an interest-based, rather than an observed outcomebased, definition of conflict centers on issues of operationalization. While such an approach is useful analytically, it is not straightforward to measure conflicting state interests systematically. I thus devote considerable space in the following chapter to examining the nature and evolution of conflict in the relationship across the Taiwan Strait. Later, in the quantitative tests introduced in Chapter , I test my hypotheses using different variables that act as proxies for conflicting interests. The use of multiple measures allows for an investigation into how sensitive findings are to one particular measure of conflict.\n\n. Why Might International Political Conflict Affect International Economic Relations? This section considers why international political conflict might be expected to have an impact on international economic relations; the remainder of the chapter then considers more specifically when these effects are likely to emerge. Political conflict can harm economic ties between countries for at least two overarching reasons. First, economic integration sometimes generates political, that is to say, security, externalities (Gowa ). In other words, trade or investment flows can make it harder for a country to achieve political objectives that conflict with those of another country; in these instances, leaders can be expected to impose restrictions on those flows. Second, when states with conflicting political goals compete over those objectives, the actions that they take (such as war or economic sanctions) can be detrimental to their economic ties. Commerce in conflictual dyads will thus tend to be lower because of the higher risk premium associated with market-based exchange (Morrow ). The Political Externalities of Economic Integration Though generally welfare-enhancing to states economically, commercial and financial integration at times generates externalities that affect the ability of states to achieve their political objectives vis-à-vis other countries (Gowa ). Externalities are simply costs or benefits from a transaction that fall on third parties and that are not taken into account by those engaging in the transaction (Parkin ). For example, a firm, pursuing higher returns, may generate more pollution than is socially desirable, since most of the costs of pollution are not incorporated into the price of the firm’s products. Likewise, a firm may discount the negative political or security consequences of its behavior, since the costs of reduced security are borne by the citizens of the home country generally rather than by the firm in particular, and as such are not factored into the price of the firm’s products. Cross-border\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\neconomic flows can generate several distinct types of security externalities; moreover, countries for which these externalities are negative can sometimes benefit by imposing restrictions on the economic ties giving rise to the diseconomies, just as they may benefit by imposing restrictions on activities that generate pollution. Next I discuss several different types of political externalities that can arise from economic integration. Trade in strategic goods can improve an adversary’s military capabilities. Perhaps the most straightforward type of political externality concerns trade in goods with direct military applications—which I will refer to here simply as strategic goods. Clearly, exports of strategic goods can improve an adversary’s military capabilities, and foreign investments in strategic industries can have similar effects. Policymakers, in turn, might block exports of strategic goods, or investments in strategic industries, that they believe are facilitating an adversary’s military development. The conditions under which it would be worthwhile for them to do so, however, appear to be rather strict. In many dyadic relationships, bilateral economic exchange will not generate this particular type of political externality. The externality will arise only if producers in country A wish to export to country B some strategic good that is produced at higher prices (or not at all) in B, or if capital owners in A wish to invest in a strategic industry in B. For example, A might be an oil producer and B an oil importer; or A might invest in high-technology industries in B that enable B to upgrade its weapons systems. Moreover, even if the externality is present, A’s ability—by blocking the relevant bilateral economic exchanges—to have a meaningful impact on B’s military capabilities hinges on the substitution elasticity of the goods or investments in question.2 That is, if B can find relatively cheap substitutes for these goods or investments from A, then A’s efforts to block bilateral exchange will have little effect. For example, if B can obtain a strategic good, currently exported by country A, from some third country C at only marginally worse terms, then A obtains only marginal security benefits by restricting exports of the good—unless it is able to cooperate with C in limiting exports of the good to B.3 Nonetheless, states sometimes do impose restrictions on sensitive exports or foreign investments because policymakers worry about enemies gaining easier access to strategic materials. The U.S. effort to limit the export of sensitive technologies to the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War is perhaps the most well-known example. Yet this example also illustrates the strict conditions under which this sort of dynamic holds. Technological advantages held by the United States meant that unregulated trade with the Eastern Bloc would entail security externalities, as such trade would make it easier for the Soviet Union to upgrade\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nits military technologies. Accordingly, the United States passed laws, including the  Export Control Act and the  Battle Act, which were designed to limit strategic exports to the Soviet Bloc (McDaniel , –). Yet imposing controls on exports made little sense unless other advanced economies also limited exports to the Eastern Bloc. The United States thus tried to coordinate with other developed economies in limiting exports to the Soviet Bloc, leading to the establishment of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) in  (McDaniel , ). In the early s, COCOM members cooperated in a wide-ranging economic boycott of the Eastern Bloc; under pressure from other members, however, the United States after  acquiesced to a more limited role, focusing on strategic exports (Mastanduno ). COCOM’s effectiveness varied over the course of the Cold War (Mastanduno ), in part because of disagreements among members concerning the scope of exports that should be subject to restrictions. Throughout COCOM’s existence, exports originating from nonmember advanced economies (generally neutral countries like Sweden or Switzerland) were a continual problem, which grew more substantial as the number of countries with the capacity to export high-technology products increased (McDaniel ; Bertsch and Elliott-Gower ). Thus, even in a case involving the world’s largest economy, where unregulated trade in high-technology products would generate certain security-related externalities, the United States found it difficult to eliminate those externalities: restrictions on bilateral trade with the Soviet Bloc would have only marginal effects, since substitutes from other advanced economies were widely, and increasingly, available, and coordination between the United States and other potential exporters proved difficult. Economic exchange can increase the wealth of potential adversaries. It is not only through trade (or investments) in strategic goods that economic integration can improve the relative military capabilities of an adversary. More broadly, the income gains that economic exchange produces are themselves fungible, and hence can be converted to military strength (Gowa ; Gowa and Mansfield ). Leaders in country A may simply worry that economic exchange with country B will yield greater economic benefits (such as faster growth) in B than in A. For example, if A is a developed economy and B is not, trade might enable B to catch up economically to A faster than it otherwise would. If relations with B are hostile, then A’s leaders will be especially concerned about these sorts of “relative gains,” since the increased economic benefit could potentially be translated into increased military capabilities in the long run (Grieco ).4 As with the externalities arising from trade in strategic goods, however, in most circumstances A is unlikely to be capable of independently reversing externalities associated with relative gains. That is, if other countries are willing to trade with B on terms similar to A’s, then A would\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nneed to obtain their cooperation (in restricting trade with B) in order to effect any meaningful change in B’s development trajectory.5 Economic exchange can generate dependencies. A third type of political externality that can arise from economic exchange centers on the dependencies that economic integration sometimes generates. Economic integration opens the possibility for economic coercion: a state that comes to depend heavily on economic ties with a second state is potentially vulnerable to economic sanctions imposed by that second state. To avoid being the target of economic coercion, and having to make political concessions to avert economic sanctions, states can sometimes benefit by preventing economic ties with adversaries from developing in the first place. On the surface, implementing restrictions to slow bilateral economic exchange in order to prevent sanctions against that exchange seems self-defeating and pointless: why deny yourself the gains of trade because your opponent may in the future threaten to deny those same gains? But further consideration reveals the fundamental importance, not of expected gains from economic interaction with a second country but rather, of () the marginal gains of that exchange versus the next best option, and () the specificity of the assets engaged in that exchange. If country A’s return on some transaction with country B is only slightly better than the next best use of the assets employed in that transaction, then the costs of stopping the transaction with B before it occurs (and thereby driving the assets to pursue their second best use) are low. Completing the transaction, however, may entail investing assets that are specific to the bilateral relationship, meaning they hold value only in the context of the relationship and cannot be easily transferred to other countries (see Lake , –; Rector, ). If B can make a credible sanctioning threat against those assets, the value of the concessions A must deliver could easily exceed the costs it would have incurred from stopping the relationally specific assets from being deployed in the first place. The logic is most obvious for foreign direct investments with relatively longterm time horizons. These sorts of investments are clearly vulnerable to opportunism by the host country because of the sunk costs that they entail: once a company from country A builds a factory in some foreign country B, it cannot move it elsewhere.6 If government officials in A believe that B might use the factory as a hostage in bargaining with A—threatening to expropriate it if A fails to give ground on some issue—then country A would be better off prohibiting investments in B, especially if the marginal costs of investing elsewhere are small. This sort of logic also applies to commercial relations, since trade involves specialization. For example, if country A’s economy specializes heavily in industries dependent on exports to B, then a severing of bilateral trade could entail substantial adjustment costs for A.7 Again, if a state anticipates this sort of scenario, and\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nexpects that its trading partner is likely to act opportunistically after trade relations have been established, then it may choose to prevent commercial integration from proceeding in the first place. This dynamic is more likely to arise in the presence of an asymmetric distribution of relationship-specific assets within a particular dyad, as such asymmetry yields the less dependent state disproportionate bargaining power (Hirschman ; Keohane and Nye ; McLaren ). A small country dependent on the market of a large country, for example, is vulnerable to economic sanctions in a way that the large country is not (e.g. Hirschman ; Drezner ). In this type of situation, the negative political externalities associated with trade may drive the smaller country to diversify its foreign commercial relations away from the larger country—especially if leaders in the smaller country believe that the larger country will use its leverage (as might be the case, for example, if the two countries have seriously conflicting interests).8 Economic exchange can influence the power of different domestic political groups. Finally, trade can change the balance of power among competing domestic political coalitions.Trade makes the holders of a country’s relatively abundant factors of production richer, and holders of its relatively scarce factors poorer; over time, groups that become wealthier are likely to become more powerful in domestic politics as well (Rogowski ). Furthermore, trade can spur the formation of groups that have a vested interest in liberal trade policies. Just as industries benefiting from a country’s existing protectionist trade barriers tend to organize and lobby against reductions in those barriers, so too actors benefiting from a country’s existing trade openness are likely to organize and oppose policies that might put trade openness at risk. These political externalities can exert a substantial impact on a government’s trade policy under any circumstances. For example, a leader who depends on the support of protectionist economic interests may oppose liberal trade policies simply because trade would have the effect of undercutting his supporters and making his opponents stronger. The process could also work in reverse: a leader supported by actors benefiting from trade might push for deeper trade openness, thereby solidifying her own political standing.9 When international political conflict is present, trade’s impact on the political strength of different domestic groups can become an especially salient concern for leaders, potentially resulting in trade restrictions that leaders would not consider in the absence of conflict. The reasoning is fairly straightforward. Suppose leaders in country A have goals that conflict seriously with the goals of country B, but not with the goals of country C. To the extent that commercial interests are motivated primarily by profits, and not by the goals at the root of the political conflict, economic links with country B are problematic for A’s leaders in a way that economic ties with C are not. Economic interests in A that benefit from trade between A and\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nB would have reason to pressure leaders in A to adopt less confrontational policies toward B, since tense bilateral political relations could be destabilizing to bilateral commercial flows. In other words, the deeper the economic relationship between A and B, the more domestic political pressure leaders in A would be under (from actors in A benefiting from the bilateral economic relationship) to modify their goals that are in conflict with B’s goals. Trade between A and C would not lead to similar pressures because the goals of those two states do not diverge. A leader committed to the goals at the heart of the rivalry between A and B might thus try to limit commercial integration between A and B, hoping in the process to prevent new vested interests opposed to those goals from emerging in A. Here again asymmetry is likely to be important. If country A depends much more heavily on bilateral trade than does country B, then the actors with a vested interest in that trade will probably exert much more political influence in A than they do in B. In this type of scenario, leaders in A should be especially concerned about the political consequences of bilateral trade: here, trade increases pressures within A for a resolution to the bilateral political dispute without generating any corresponding pressures in B. In other words, leaders in A will face increased pressure to back down, while leaders in B will be free to remain resolved. Indeed, this is an effect that B might even try to cultivate by promoting trade with A (Hirschman ; Skalnes ; Abdelal and Kirshner /; Kahler and Kastner ). Summary. Though states generally benefit economically from international trade and investment flows, foreign economic ties can also generate a variety of political externalities that can influence the ability of states to achieve goals that are in conflict with other countries. In countries for which such political externalities are negative, leaders are faced with a tradeoff between the economic costs of restricting commerce on the one hand and the political consequences of permitting it on the other.The more substantial those negative consequences become, the more likely leaders are to opt for restrictions. As the discussion to this point should make clear, however, the extent to which trade generates political externalities varies considerably across dyads. In some dyads, commerce might have very few security-related externalities: for example, when two adversaries share a trading relationship that is limited, symmetrical, and that does not involve the trading of strategic goods, it is unlikely that their commercial relationship will have an impact on their political relationship in a meaningful way. In other cases, trade might have both positive and negative political externalities for a particular country. I return to these issues in Section . Next, however, I consider a second causal mechanism through which conflict affects international economic relations.\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nInternational Conflict and Risk In addition to making governments more attentive to the political externalities of international economic exchange, international political conflict can also distort economic flows by increasing the risks faced by the firms undertaking international trade and investments. Simply put, interstate competition over conflicting goals can harm commerce. In extreme cases, of course, states with competing objectives sometimes fight destructive wars. But even in conflicts that do not escalate into military confrontations, states sometimes adopt other policies, like economic sanctions or border closings, that can be devastating to bilateral economic ties. Firms thus face greater risks when trading or investing in the presence of conflict, and these increased risks can distort international economic flows (e.g. Morrow ). In the remainder of this section, I consider in more detail why conflict may result in costly competitions that can harm commerce. When a state’s preferences over some issue conflict with those of another state, it is often uncertain how committed the other state is to its position on the issue. Consider as an example the main case study in this book, the relationship across the Taiwan Strait. Here (as is discussed in more detail in Chapter ) the core issue of contention between the current Taiwanese leadership and the current leadership in Beijing is Taiwan’s sovereign status. PRC officials aim, at a minimum, to keep Taiwan from formalizing its de facto independent status, and from taking steps that effectively preclude unification as a viable future scenario. On the other side, recent Taiwanese presidents have at times taken steps to further consolidate Taiwan’s sovereign status. Former President Chen Shui-bian, for example, sought—ultimately unsuccessfully—to construct a new constitution for Taiwan. Though Mainland leaders have warned against steps they see as moving the island in the direction of formal independence, it is hard for Taiwanese officials to predict how the PRC would respond to such steps. PRC leaders might hint at a military response, but such a course of action would obviously be very costly; in any given instance it is hard for Taiwanese leaders to know whether such threats are real or bluff. This example highlights a central point of the crisis-bargaining literature: when two states have conflicting interests, each side is often uncertain over the true level of the other side’s resolve; that is, it is uncertain of the costs the other side is willing to pay in order to achieve a favorable outcome. This uncertainty gives states that are in reality unresolved an incentive to nonetheless act resolute—to bluff (Fearon ). Even states that are highly resolved, however, would prefer not to have to carry out the threats they are resolved to carry out, since doing so is costly. Far better would be for their adversaries to recognize this resolve and back down first. Thus, states that are truly resolved have every incentive to distinguish themselves\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nfrom states that are bluffing, and one way to do this is to communicate—or “signal”—a willingness to accept costs in order to achieve a favorable outcome.10 By sending costly signals, states convey information more credibly: since states that lack resolve are by definition unwilling to pay costs to achieve a favorable bargaining outcome, the demonstration of a willingness to pay some costs increases the likelihood that a state will be perceived as resolute. Unfortunately for actors engaged in international commerce, the signals states choose to send can harm international economic flows: states sometimes impose economic sanctions, close borders, or enact embargoes in order to signal commitment to issues that are important to them.11 Indeed, commercial integration between countries effectively expands the “menu” of signaling options available to states by making it possible to demonstrate resolve by harming trade (Gartzke ; Gartzke et al. ; Morrow ; ; Stein ). Of course, signals of resolve can still fail: some uncertainty will always remain (Schultz ), and thus wars—which are likely to be especially disruptive to commerce—can erupt when two highly resolved states fail to convince each other of their respective levels of commitment. That such dynamics might occur in the presence of conflict should lead private economic actors to place a risk premium on commerce in the shadow of conflict. At the margins, they should limit their exposure, especially when relationship-specific investments are under consideration.12 Conflict can have a negative impact on trade even when there is little potential for escalation to war or comprehensive trade sanctions, as states sometimes signal in ways that can harm trade even when they are bargaining over relatively lowlevel disputes. For example, after the  spy plane incident between the United States and China, Beijing signaled its displeasure with U.S. reconnaissance policy—and Washington’s handling of the incident—by suggesting it might purchase more Airbus planes and fewer Boeing planes in the future.13 At a still lower level of conflict, countries sometimes adopt more restrictive entry and visa requirements to demonstrate dissatisfaction with entry requirements in other countries (and, conversely, sometimes relax visa requirements when relations with other countries improve).14 The added costs associated with such restrictions could discourage commerce at the margins. Of course, the trade disruption that is likely to arise in minor disputes would be small compared to the disruption that could occur in serious disputes with the potential to escalate into war. In summary, we have seen two causal pathways through which international political conflict can have a detrimental effect on international economic flows. In the first case, leaders restrict commerce because they believe economic integration potentially entails security externalities. In the second case, firms anticipate the possibility that leaders will choose to signal resolve in a way that damages commerce—such as by imposing sanctions or, in an extreme case, going to war.\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nSince the general effect of conflict on commerce should be negative (once other factors are controlled for), my initial baseline hypothesis is as follows: H1: Holding all else equal, higher levels of political conflict between countries are associated with lower levels of economic exchange between those countries. The corresponding null hypothesis is: H0: Political conflict between countries has no effect on those countries’ economic relations.\n\n. When Does International Political Conflict Affect Economic Exchange? We know from prior studies that the effects of conflict on commerce appear to vary substantially across cases. In this section I argue that there is good reason to believe that conflict’s effects are contingent, in part, on the nature of the governing coalitions within the countries enmeshed in conflict. In particular, the economic consequences of conflict are likely to be more limited to the extent that leaders are accountable to internationalist economic interests. Leaders, of course, do not make foreign economic policy in a vacuum: the benefit that leaders derive from foreign economic policies depends on the policy preferences of their core constituents. It is clear, moreover, that international economic integration affects different groups within a particular society differently, and as such foreign trade and investment policies can be deeply contentious. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem predicts, for example, that the owners of relatively abundant factors of production will see their returns increase with trade liberalization, while owners of relatively scarce factors will see their returns decline with liberalization (Stolper and Samuelson ; Rogowski ; Frieden and Rogowski ). In this regard, a leader who depends heavily on labor for support may come to have drastically different trade policy preferences from a rival politician who draws more heavily from landowners or business for support. Conversely, to the extent that factors of production cannot easily be shifted across industries, trade policy preferences are more likely to vary by industry rather than by class: both capital holders and workers in internationally competitive industries will tend to support trade liberalization, while the reverse will tend to be true in industries that are not competitive internationally (Frieden ; Hiscox ; ; Solingen , ).15 In short, international economic policies typically generate substantial domestic political conflict, and the actors who benefit from liberalization in foreign economic policies are likely to vary substantially across countries and also across time within countries—depending on variables such as\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nthe relative abundance of different factors of production, the mobility of those factors across industries, and the opportunity costs of closure (Frieden and Rogowski ). For my purposes here, I will refer to those actors who stand to benefit from liberal foreign economic policies as “internationalist economic interests” (e.g. Papayoanou ). When devising foreign economic policies, leaders must surely consider the extent to which their policy decisions deviate from the interests of the coalitions that back them. By adopting policies at odds with core supporters, leaders run the risk of losing those supporters to defection (to alternative coalitions) or of being replaced by rivals more attentive to coalition interests. Thus, we might expect that leaders who draw support from internationalist economic interests prefer not to adopt policies that place the country’s foreign economic ties in jeopardy, as doing so could alienate key supporters. In contrast, leaders who tend to draw support from more protectionist interests need not worry about angering supporters when implementing restrictions on foreign economic exchange; if anything, they may broaden support among core constituencies by doing so. In short, leaders should expect to pay higher political costs for pursuing policies detrimental to foreign economic exchange to the extent that they are backed by internationalist economic interests. That leaders who draw support from internationalist economic interests would be expected to pursue more open foreign economic policies is straightforward. Solingen () provides evidence showing that internationalizing coalitions do indeed tend to adopt more open trade policies. However, there is also reason to expect that an interactive effect between conflict and leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests exists. That is, the independent effects of international conflict on states’ international economic ties should hinge, in part, on the extent to which leaders in those countries are accountable to internationalist economic interests. This intervening variable—leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests—should have an impact on both causal mechanisms described in the previous section, for the following reasons. Consider first the case of security externalities. Imagine two countries, A and B, which have conflicting interests. The leader of state A recognizes that economic integration with B entails political externalities that are positive for B and negative for A. Suppose, for example, that absent political interference, A would export high-technology products to B and that those products would allow B to improve its military capabilities vis-à-vis A. Under certain conditions,16 A’s bargaining power relative to B improves if it restricts those high-tech exports, since such restrictions would have a negative impact on B’s military capabilities. If the leader of state A depends on the political support of actors who benefit from trade, how-\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\never, then at the margins she will pay higher domestic political costs for imposing trade restrictions than were she not accountable to such interests. In other words, such a leader faces a tradeoff between maximizing A’s bargaining power vis-à-vis B and solidifying her own domestic political standing, a tradeoff that leaders not accountable to actors benefiting from trade do not face. She might still choose to impose the restrictions, but at the margins she is less likely to, given her own domestic political incentives; that likelihood decreases to the extent that she owes her political position to the support of internationalist economic interests. With the second causal mechanism, the risks of trade in the presence of conflict, risk might also be lowered when internationalist economic interests hold strong political clout in the states involved. When states send signals to convey resolve, they in fact have a portfolio of methods from which to choose. Some of these methods directly and negatively affect bilateral economic relations (such as an economic sanction), while others do not (such as military exercises).17 Because leaders who depend on the support of internationalist economic interests pay higher political costs (relative to other leaders) for taking actions detrimental to foreign commerce, these leaders will rank the costliness of various signals differently from how leaders not supported by internationalist interests would rank them. Specifically, leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests should view signals that are detrimental to commerce, like economic sanctions, as being more costly than would other leaders. Consider again two states, A and B, enmeshed in a conflictual relationship in which, over time, a number of disputes arise. Assume further that A’s leader is highly committed to some of these issues, and only moderately committed to others. In other words, A would be willing to bear high costs to obtain a favorable settlement with regard to the first set of issues, and only moderate costs to obtain a favorable settlement with regard to the second set of issues. If, on the one hand, economic sanctions (or some other signal that hurts economic ties) were relatively cheap—as would be the case if A’s leader is not accountable to internationalist economic interests—then A would be willing to signal commitment using economic sanctions for the entire range of issues. That is, economic sanctions would always be on A’s menu of possible signals through which to indicate commitment. If, on the other hand, A’s leader depended on the political support of internationalist interests, then signaling through the use of economic sanctions would be relatively costly. Here, sanctions would be off the menu for the second range of issues—those to which A was only moderately committed—because the costs of sending a signal in this way would exceed the expected gains of achieving a favorable bargain for A. In other words, economic sanctions (or other types of signals that damage commerce directly) will be on the menu of signaling options\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n80%\n\nTrade between A and B\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nLow conflict High conflict (Level of conflict between A and B)\n\n.  .

At the margins, then, private commercial actors should feel less threatened in the presence of conflict when leaders are accountable to internationalist economic interests than they otherwise would feel. They know that in these instances, leaders will only signal resolve in a way that hurts international commerce when the stakes are relatively high. Conversely, for leaders who do not depend on the support of free trade interests, these types of economically damaging signals are on the table in a much broader range of possible disputes that might arise in the context of a conflictual relationship. My second hypothesis is thus as follows: H2: All else equal, the negative effects of international conflict on international economic integration are less severe to the extent that leaders in the countries enmeshed in conflict are accountable to internationalist economic interests. To restate, the relationship posited by H2 is an interactive one. Clearly, levels of trade should be higher when countries are governed by leaders accountable to internationalist economic interests, ceteris paribus. But H2 also posits that international conflict should have a smaller independent effect on trade when such leaders are in power. Figure  provides a simple graphical illustration of H2’s expectations. Here, line P represents trade between two countries (A and B) governed by leaders relatively accountable to internationalist economic interests.\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nH2 suggests that trade between the two countries should not be highly sensitive to the level of conflict between A and B; hence, the slope of line P is not strongly negative­. Line Q represents trade between two countries whose leaders are not highly accountable to internationalist economic interests. Since leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests should have an independent effect on trade between A and B, line Q is lower than line P across all levels of conflict. But H2 also predicts that conflict should have a greater independent effect on trade between A and B when leaders are not accountable to internationalist economic interests. The slope of line Q is thus more sharply negative than the slope of line P. Measuring Leadership Accountability to Internationalist Economic Interests As is the case with conflict, operationalizing leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests is hardly a straightforward task. Identifying which actors support, and which oppose, liberal foreign economic policies is itself a difficult undertaking yet represents only an initial step in understanding leadership accountability to such interests. As Solingen (, ) writes, “The institutional context in which coalitions operate plays an important role in defining a coalition’s political wherewithal . . . and the very fate of liberalization.” On a broad level, democracy may increase—on average—leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests, to the extent that median interests tend to be internationalist in orientation (Papayoanou ; ).18 But leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests is likely to vary greatly even among democracies. Small district size in parliamentary systems, for example, can give regionally concentrated protectionist interests disproportionate political power (Rogowski ).19 Highly popular leaders, or leaders who won landslide victories in elections, meanwhile, might simply feel less beholden to any specific component of their winning coalitions. And because the economic costs of closure are much higher in countries with small internal markets than in countries with large markets, internationalist economic interests are likely to be more marginalized in the latter than in the former. Meanwhile, just as democracy does not guarantee that internationalist economic interests will wield substantial political clout, authoritarian political systems do not necessarily leave such interests marginalized. Rather, the influence of internationalist economic interests in nondemocratic systems should hinge on the composition of a particular country’s “selectorate,” the actors to whom top leaders are accountable (Shirk ; Roeder ). Shirk () argues that in China, for instance, key components of the selectorate—such as provincial officials—had an increasing stake in access to global markets over the course of the s. In other\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nsystems, such as some military juntas, leaders may have little or no accountability to internationalist economic interests. In the empirical chapters that follow, I measure leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests in two ways. First, in the case studies, I proceed by examining the political institutions and processes in the countries involved. I identify internationalist economic interests based on observed policy positions (for example, which actors lobby openly for liberalization) and deduced preferences based on theory (Frieden ; Frieden and Rogowski ), and then assess how much influence such interests are able to exert in the political arena. Second, I draw inference based on countries’ overall trade policy orientations, particularly in the quantitative analysis. My primary task in this book is to better understand when conflict between countries A and B will have an impact on economic­ relations­ between A and B. Obviously, it would be a tautology to measure the strength of internationalist economic interests based on economic exchange between A and B. But it is possible to draw some inference regarding the political clout of internationalist economic interests in A by examining A’s overall foreign economic policies, not simply those directed at B in particular.That is, internationalist­ economic interests are likely to be stronger in countries that pursue, on balance, open foreign economic policies than they are in countries that pursue, on balance­, relatively closed foreign economic policies. Of course, such an approach carries with it risks as well: for example, leaders who are relatively autonomous from competing economic interest groups might still pursue open trade policies. I return to these issues when describing the quantitative research design in Chapter . Objections and Extensions One potential objection to this line of analysis concerns endogeneity. More specifically, the work of Solingen (; ) suggests that conflict in a particular region is endogenous to the types of domestic coalitions governing countries in that region. Regions where countries are governed by strongly internationalizing coalitions are likely to be zones of stable peace. Internationalizing coalitions, for example, tend to avoid the sorts of destabilizing behaviors—such as mythmaking and bloated defense budgets—that are more common among statist/nationalist coalitions. Likewise, McDonald () demonstrates quantitatively that countries with more open trade policies have a lower incidence of military conflict. These studies raise an important question: is it possible for conflict to persist even as leaders become more accountable to internationalist economic interests? There can be little doubt that the relationships examined in this book are most likely characterized by substantial “feedback loops.” Indeed, the possibility that\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\nincreased economic flows reduce the likelihood of military violence (Russett and Oneal ) is in part what motivates this project. If trade does indeed facilitate peace, it is important to understand how economic ties can develop in the first place in dyads with a potential to engage in military conflict; H2 has the potential to offer some leverage in this regard. But it is almost certainly the case that as internationalist economic interests become more powerful in domestic political systems, they often aim not simply to limit the impact of conflict on foreign economic policy but also to restructure those foreign policy goals that lie at the heart of conflict. Chapter  addresses this issue head-on by examining whether growing economic linkages across the Taiwan Strait influence, or are likely to influence in the future, the probability of cross-Strait military conflict. The chapter considers at length the possibility that economic ties can come to have a transformative impact on the foreign policy goals that drive cross-Strait political conflict. I also address this issue in the empirical chapters that follow by effectively holding the level of conflict constant—at least to some degree. In the cross-Strait case the conflicting goals at the center of the bilateral rivalry remained in place (and perhaps intensified during the presidencies of Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian) even as leadership accountability to internationalist economic interests on both sides fluctuated (and generally increased) in recent decades. Levels of conflict could, of course, decline in the future if internationalist interests become even more entrenched in the two polities (and such a process might even be starting to unfold under new Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou). A separate issue concerns leaders who are not especially accountable to internationalist economic interests but who nonetheless pursue strongly internationalist foreign economic policies. For example, a leadership that is relatively insulated from societal pressures—perhaps operating in an autocratic setting—may yet be strongly committed to economic development, and might conclude that an internationalizing strategy is the best path to economic growth.20 Are the independent effects of conflict on commerce likely to be mitigated when such leaders are in power, even though they are not necessarily accountable to internationalist economic interests?21 The answer, I suspect, is yes, though I also believe that the effect is likely to be less dramatic. Such leaders, like those directly accountable to internationalist economic interests, will also face difficult tradeoffs that might lead them to try to separate international political and economic arenas, even though doing so could be counterproductive to their foreign political goals (such as a reluctance to limit trade in the presence of security externalities). But precisely because they enjoy more political autonomy domestically, they may be able more easily to set aside temporarily their development objectives when core international political objectives are challenged, in a way or to an extent that would be\n\n\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\nmore difficult for a leader who is directly accountable to the interests that would be harmed by such a course of action. Finally, it is important to emphasize that factors other than the domestic political influence of internationalist economic interests are also likely to condition the effect of international political conflict on cross-border economic flows. The discussion in the previous section suggests, for example, that conflict is likely to affect some types of economic exchange more than others. In particular, conflict should have a bigger impact on economic exchange that requires the deployment of relationship-specific assets. Since such assets (think of a large-scale factory) would be difficult or impossible to redeploy if conflict were to escalate, firms should be reluctant to undertake them at all in the presence of conflict. Likewise, Section  suggested that there could be substantial variation across cases in the political externalities arising from commerce. These externalities sometimes tend to reinforce each other, and sometimes tend to cancel each other out. Consider, for example, a country A that benefits disproportionately from trade with country B, but at the same time depends more on bilateral economic relations than does B. The disproportionate gains that A reaps from the exchange enable A to invest more in its military, relative to B, than would otherwise be possible; in this regard, trade yields positive security externalities for A and negative externalities for B. At the same time, however, A’s asymmetric dependence on the bilateral relationship makes A more vulnerable to economic coercion than B, a negative political externality for A and a positive one for B. In this scenario, even if conflict between the two countries becomes severe, neither has obvious reason to place limits on bilateral economic exchange since it is unclear whether security externalities on balance benefit A or B. Alternatively, if it were B, instead of A, that depended more on the bilateral economic relationship, the security externalities of economic exchange would uniformly benefit A and harm B. In this case, B would have more reason to impose restrictions on bilateral economic ties if political conflict between the two countries gave B reason to worry about trade’s security externalities. In sum, the precise nature of trade’s security externalities could influence the extent to which national leaders seek to impose restrictions on trade in the presence of conflict. The empirical chapters that follow are sensitive to the reality that variables other than the one emphasized in H2 could influence the extent to which conflict affects trade in a particular case. When other factors appear salient, I am up-front about it. But the focus, of course, is on testing H2 and evaluating the extent to which the theoretical argument fleshed out above helps to make sense of trends in PRC-Taiwan relations.\n\ninternational conflict, domestic politics\n\n\n\n. Summary Chapter  developed a straightforward research question: How are we to explain the substantial variation that appears to exist in the effects of international political conflict on international economic ties? To address that question, this chapter began by developing a broad framework that seeks to explain how conflict affects bilateral economic relations. That discussion culminated in a baseline hypothesis (H1): the effect of conflict on commerce, all else being equal, will tend to be negative. Two causal mechanisms, drawn from the existing literature, give rise to this hypothesized effect. First, state leaders worry about the possible security externalities of economic interdependence in the shadow of conflict, which may in turn lead them to adopt policy restrictions on bilateral exchange. Second, private actors demand higher risk premiums for bilateral economic transactions when conflict is present. The remainder of the chapter considered the sources of variation in conflict’s effects on economic exchange. In developing an explanation for this variation, I focused on the domestic political determinants of conflict’s impact on economic exchange. Though a substantial (and growing) literature considers the domestic political variables that affect countries’ foreign economic policies, existing studies have largely ignored interactions between these domestic political variables and international conflict. But there are good reasons to believe that such interaction should be present; my argument along these lines culminated in the following hypothesis (H2): the effects of conflict on economic exchange will be less severe when leaders are accountable to internationalist economic interests. The chapters that follow evaluate this hypothesis, first in the context of PRC-Taiwan relations and then more generally in Chapter .\n\n3\n\nMainland China–Taiwan Relations as a Case Study\n\n. Introduction The relationship across the Taiwan Strait in many ways epitomizes the puzzle outlined in Chapter . Political relations between Beijing and Taipei are, and have been, deeply strained. As one scholar has written, the issue at the heart of the rivalry—Taiwan’s sovereign status—remains “the only issue in the world today that could realistically lead to war between two major powers.”1 Yet despite persistent and severe conflict in bilateral political relations, economic relations across the Taiwan Strait flourish. Trade flows have grown rapidly over the past twenty years, and Mainland China has recently displaced the United States as Taiwan’s primary trading partner. The Mainland is also the primary destination for Taiwan’s outward foreign direct investment by a large margin. This “perplexing duality” of economic integration and political standoff represents a “paradox for the student of international relations” that demands explanation.2 This chapter and the next three consider this intriguing case in the context of the theoretical arguments and hypotheses laid out in Chapter . The case study is not a formal scientific test: in a single case study like this, it is typically difficult to control fully for different, alternative explanations; some of the variables discussed abstractly in the previous chapter are difficult to operationalize or observe in practice; and as with any case study, questions of generalizability cannot be dismissed in a cavalier fashion. Despite these caveats, however, this case study is not simply a descriptive exercise. Rather, it aims to assess the extent to which the arguments made in Chapter  can help to explain trends and events in the relationship across the Taiwan Strait. In that regard, the case is potentially very useful. Given\n\nmainland china–taiwan relations as a case study\n\n\n\nthe severity of political conflict between Beijing and Taipei, relations across the Taiwan Strait approximate a “least likely” case, meaning that the processes mediating conflict’s effects on commerce in this case may be present in other dyads characterized by conflict. In the next section I describe in more detail the nature of political conflict in Mainland China–Taiwan relations. The discussion is necessarily cursory, as entire volumes have been written on the issue of political conflict itself across the Taiwan Strait (e.g. Tucker ; Sheng ; Zhao c). Here I simply provide a brief historical overview of cross-Strait political relations and discuss the core issues that generate cross-Strait political conflict. Section  then presents trends in the cross-Strait economic relationship. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the methodological issues surrounding this case study.\n\n. A Brief Summary of Political Conflict Across the Taiwan Strait The issue of Taiwan’s sovereign status has been at the heart of the cross-Strait rivalry ever since the Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang, or KMT) retreated to Taiwan in  after being defeated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Chinese Civil War. Even after retreating to Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist regime (which continued to use the name The Republic of China, or ROC) still claimed to be the legitimate government of all China. Authorities in the newly established People’s Republic of China (PRC), meanwhile, aimed to “liberate” Taiwan, and bring the island under Beijing’s authority.3 Though Beijing’s hopes for a quick resolution were foiled when the Truman administration placed the United States Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait following the outbreak of the Korean War, the eventual establishment of PRC sovereignty over Taiwan remained an important foreign policy objective. Cross-Strait relations, in turn, were characterized by repeated crises during the s and s.4 During the s, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly asked for United States support in a military offensive against the PRC (Gu , ). And while Beijing began as early as the s to emphasize “peaceful liberation” in its policy toward Taiwan,5 Mainland officials in  and  devised contingency plans—never acted on, of course—to seize the island militarily (Gu , –). The KMT leadership’s claim as the legitimate government of all China remained largely unchanged through the s, even following the ROC’s loss of the Chinese seat in the United Nations in  and the severing of diplomatic relations with the United States in . However, Mainland China’s policies toward Taiwan began to change in the late s, and this shift—to an emphasis on “peaceful reunification” rather than confrontation—would lead to some improvement in cross-Strait relations during the s. Beijing’s changed stance\n\n\n\nmainland china–taiwan relations as a case study\n\non Taiwan became apparent in the “Message to Taiwan Compatriots” announced in , in which the Mainland called for negotiations to resolve the Taiwan issue and promised “to respect the current situation in Taiwan and the views of Taiwanese in all walks of life.” The statement also called for the establishment of economic linkages across the Taiwan Strait. In , Marshall Ye Jianying expanded on these themes as he announced a “Nine Points” plan for peaceful reunification; the plan promised a high level of political autonomy for Taiwan—including keeping its own army—if it were to reunify with the Mainland.6 This proposal, that Taiwan would maintain a high level of autonomy within a unified China, became known as “one country, two systems.” China’s  state constitution formally authorized the formation of such a “special administrative region.”7 Though the one country, two systems formula was dismissed by an ROC government that continued to reject official contact with the PRC,8 Taiwanese policy toward the Mainland nonetheless exhibited some moderation of its own during the s. For example, beginning in  the Taiwanese government began to refer to Beijing as Zhonggong dangju (Chinese communist authorities) rather than Gongfei (Communist bandits); the ROC government also stopped using slogans such as “counterattack the Mainland” (Copper , ; Roy , ). More consequentially, the Taiwanese government began to allow its citizens to travel to Mainland China in  (Copper , ), and later in the decade lifted bans on indirect trade and investment flows to China (a decision that will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter). On the surface, at least, cross-Strait relations continued to stabilize to some extent during the early s. In the Guidelines for National Unification, adopted in , the ROC government affirmed that “both the mainland and Taiwan areas are parts of Chinese territory,” and that “helping to bring about national unification should be the common responsibility of all Chinese people,” though it emphasized too that unification must come about in the context of a “democratic, free and equitably prosperous China.”9 Shortly thereafter, Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui (–) lifted the “Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion,” which had suspended the ROC constitution since the latter’s being enacted in . Lee also ended the “Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of the Communist Rebellion,” thereby declaring the civil war over and effectively legitimizing Communist rule on the Mainland (Roy , ).10 In , the ROC government established the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). Though formally a private organization, the SEF was created to serve as a semi-official intermediary in dealing with the Mainland (Goldstein , ; Roy , ). The PRC, in turn, formed a companion organization with similar function, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits\n\nmainland china–taiwan relations as a case study\n\n\n\n(ARATS). In  ARATS proposed direct chairman-level talks between the two organizations; Taiwanese officials responded positively, leading to a  meeting between C. F. Koo of SEF and Wang Daohan of ARATS in Singapore.11 Yet even as events like the Koo-Wang meeting suggested an improved crossStrait political climate, the stage was being set for intensified conflict later in the decade. In part, renewed conflict emerged from political changes in Taiwan. Prior to the s, the KMT had presided over a Leninist regime in which the ruling party penetrated all branches of the state, and in which opposition parties were banned (Chu , ). Moreover, though representing only about  percent of Taiwan’s population, Mainlanders (people who emigrated to Taiwan after the mid-s, and their descendents) dominated the KMT leadership structure. In this type of environment, political leaders remained committed to the view that Taiwan in principle is a part of China while prohibiting contrarian public discourse on the subject. But a slow process of democratization began to accelerate in the s; key breakthroughs included the government’s  decision to tolerate opposition parties and the  lifting of martial law, which had been in place since the s (Roy , –). Elections grew in importance, and after  (when the first popular election was held for the presidency) all major executive an"
