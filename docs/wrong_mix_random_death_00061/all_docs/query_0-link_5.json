        "text": "4umi fourletterword\n\nA collection of more or less random historical facts has been mapped on a calendar in a less or more logical order, although not, repeat not chronological. The people and events that shaped our world tell different stories at different levels when brought together in seeming chaos. Empires have come and gone, languages developed and died out. The only uninterupted manifestation of a continuous culture throughout the millenia appears to be the cycle of seven days called a week. Dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 use the Julian calendar system to calculate the weekday.\n\nOnly events that happened on a single day are noted here. Most world changing events are however not confined to a single date, but rather come to pass by shifting mindsets in different places on all days. The world view arising from this list may therefore seem a little absurd...\n\nMonday 0 500 BC: Pythagoras, Greek philosopher, aged around 72, dies in Metapontum around this time.\n\nMonday 0 425 BC:
