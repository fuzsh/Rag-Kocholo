BY ALBERT AND MARJORIE RAVENHOLT M odern revolutions have a cruel way of cannibalizing both their leaders and the ideals that originally generated them. As 1986 drew to a close, it was not yet clear whether this would be the fate of the extraordinary popular revolt that had elevated a once housewifely widow, Corazon Aquino {see Biographies), to the presidency of the Philippines. With an almost fiesta-like mobilization of “people power,” the Filipinos deposed a dictatorship that had robbed the now 40-year- old republic of its zestful political life and plundered its economy. This nation of 7,100 islands, guarding the Pacific approaches to Southeast Asia, had paid dearly for the years of tyranny. Two-thirds of its 56 million citizens were impoverished, many had suffered in prisons, some had been murdered, and others had fled into exile. In February 1986, as the lunar new year inaugurated the year of the tiger, hundreds of thousands of students, nuns, and entire families of ordinary people, armed only with prayers, flowers, and food, turned back the tanks of the despot who aimed to steal his reelection as president. In a demonstration of nonviolence that sent ripples of hope throughout the lands where dictators ruled, Filipinos displayed a depth of commitment to democracy that surprised even themselves. For those who value human liberty and champion the rights of the individual, it was one of the most positive and stirring events of modern times. It was not, however, a universally popular upheaval. Over the past 15 years, thousands of students and other dissatisfied or fearfal young people had taken to the hills. Joining the New People’s Army (NPA), which operates under the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), they established a growing alternative authority. By 1986 these insurgent forces ruled between one-third and one-half of all Philippine territory. Even on the outskirts of Greater Manila, it was a rare fishpond owner who did not pay tax to this rival government. Ambushing Philippine Army patrols, enforcing vigilante justice in the countryside, and indoctrinating recruits Mth teach-ins, the insurgents continued to extend their reach. In December Albert and Marjorie Ravenholt have made Manila their base since soon after World War II, he as a foreign correspondent and associate of the American Universities Field Staff International and she as an area consultant on the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Albert Ravenholt wrote the feature article \"The Philippine Republic: A Decade of Independence\" in the 1957 Britannica Book of the Year and a subsequent book. The Philippines: A Young Republic on the Move. 1986 their open organization, the National Democratic Front (NDF), negotiated a cease-fire with the new national government. The leaders of the insurgents are doctrinaire Marxists, as they define their ideology. They boycotted the February 7 election in which incumbent Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos and his vice-presidential candidate, Arturo Tolentino, were defeated by a united opposition led by Corazon Aquino and now Vice-Pres. Salvador.?. Laurel. The Marxists had refused to join the protests triggered by the assassination of former senator Benigno Aquino on Aug. 21, 1983. They were absent from the almost religious massing of “people power” that brought Marcos’s rule to an end. Only belatedly did the Communists and their ideological allies acknowledge that they had made a tactical blunder. They now seek credit for initiating popular resistance to the Marcos regime. Meanwhile, insurgent Muslim Moros in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago and Kalinga and Apayao tribesmen of the northern Luzon cordillera have agreed to a cease-fire that could lead to a political settlement of their grievances. Many besides the Filipinos have a stake in the out- come of this drama. Neighbouring countries — Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, even China — all look with nervous concern at what is happening in the Philippines. For these neighbours, peace in the region is a prerequisite for their own internal progress. Nor do they want an expansion of the Soviet military presence into the Philippine Archipelago. For Americans the quandary is particularly acute. For nearly half a century, beginning in 1898, the Philippines was under the American flag. There the U.S. made its most sustained effort to foster democracy among another people. The two largest U.S. military bases outside North America, Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, are both on Luzon. On a more human level, an almost familial relationship has evolved between Filipinos and Americans, who shared combat against the Japanese in World War II and grew to be comrades in many of life’s important arenas. It is not within the range of realistic options for the United States to walk away and leave the Filipinos to a hostile fate. Fate of a Nation. Countries and peoples, much like families, experience life in cycles; periods of setback and discouragement alternate with times of exhilaration and hope. It was exhilaration and hope that marked the “time of Magsaysay,” as ordinary Filipinos call the events of 30-odd years ago. Then the country had a larger-than- 5 A soldier of the New People's Army (left) collects taxes from a local mayor In Albay Province on the island of Luzon. By 1986 the insurgent NPA forces held stern authority — rival to the national government — in more than one-third of the Philippine lands. MARYANN OE L£0— S1PA/SPECIAL FEATURES life president of boundless energy, scrupulous honesty, and a compelling faith in the common man. A former World War II guerrilla chieftain, Ramon Magsaysay used his shrewd judgment of men to cleanse government of corruption and restore faith in the electoral process. Picking up the tasks barely begun by the first two presidents of the republic, Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino, he proceeded to rebuild the society from the chaos left by the Japanese military occupation in World War II. Yet new nations are especially vulnerable to the unexpected. Magsaysay was Idlled on the night of March 17, 1957, when his airplane crashed on a mountain in the central island of Cebu. Leadership of the Philippine republic passed to the incumbent vice-president, Carlos P. Garcia. A product of provincial politics, Garcia, who was reelected in November 1957 on the Nacionalista Party ticket, declared a “Filipino First” policy that started the nation on the path of manufacturing for import substitution rather than building an agricultural and industrial system that could compete in the world market. Self-styled Filipino nationalists, profiting at the expense of consumers, jealously campaigned against the foreign commercial participation that might have forced them to become efficient. Despite its great advantages — privileged access to the U.S. market; English as the language of education and government; a corps of highly educated technocrats; vast natural resources — the Philippines fell far behind such less favoured neighbours as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand. Diosdado Macapagal, elected president on the Liberal Party ticket in 1961, abolished most foreign exchange controls and attempted to open up the economy, despite stubborn resistance within the Congress. The most notable accomplishment of his administration, however, was enact- ment of the Land Reform Code, which benefited tenants cultivating rice and com. In every congressional district or province proclaimed a “land reform area,” all tenant farmers — who usually had been sharecroppers diWding the net harvest after the cost of threshing 50-50 with the landowmers— were entitled to shift to leasehold with the start of the next agricultural year. For former tenant farmers this Land Reform Code proved a boon, though not all of them have taken advantage of the purchase option, and the procedures for securing titles arc complex. 6 However landless labourers, who were not provided for in the code, have suffered; the new owner-farmers usually have proved less generous to rural labourers than the paternalistic, semifeudal hacenderos who preceded them. Enactment of the Land Reform Code set in motion critical political changes, especially in central Luzon. This region had spawned pre-World War II socialist and Communist\" movements that joined forces against the Japanese occupiers as the Hukbalahap guerrillas. After Japan’s defeat, the “Huks” were denied recognition, back pay, and veterans’ benefits by the U.S. Army board sitting in Manila. Bitter and ripe for Communist propaganda, the Huks rose in revolt in 1948 against the often oppressive Philippine government forces. It was only after Magsaysay, who became secretary of defense in 1950, began disci- plining the Philippine armed forces while offering land to guerrillas who surrendered that the Huks were defeated and their supremo, Luis Tame, turned himself in. As tenant farmers became owners, the Huk organizers who had retained their roots in central Luzon turned to new ventures. Beginning in 1964, escalation of the conflict in Vietnam resulted in vastly expanded acti-vities and personnel at the Clark and Subic bases. The former Huk organization became a mafia-type operation, smug- gling, dealing dmgs, selling protection, and controlling filling stations, taxis, bars, and a huge gambling casino patronized by U.S. servicemen. In reaction against this profiteering, the more idealistic revolutionaries broke away and founded the NPA with its own Maoist-oriented CPP. Virtually forsaking central Luzon, they followed the early Chinese Red Army pattern of moving into inaccessible mountainous regions, like the Sierra Madre of Luzon, the hinterland of Samar, and the vast interior of Mindanao. After Ferdinand Marcos was elected president in November 1965, some Filipinos who worked intimately with him felt that he showed great promise, though older politicians recalled that, while still a law student, he had been convicted of murdering his father’s political opponent, Julio Nalundasan (the Supreme Court later reversed the decision). There also was controversy concerning Marcos’s claim to be a much-decorated wartime hero, which U.S. Army records failed to substantiate. As chief executive, Marcos emphasized building infrastructure. During his first administration and after his reelection in November 1969, new roads were built and neglected ones surfaced, long-stalled bridge construction was completed, rural electrification was extended, harbours were improved, and irrigation systems were expanded. However, technocrats working with the Marcos administration soon discovered that the project proposals most readily endorsed for action were those promising lucrative contracts for the president’s cronies. Martial Law. The social dynamite that still threatens to tear the Philippines apart was planted with Marcos’s proclamation of martial law, effective at midnight on Sept. 21, 1972. Announced justifications included what he subsequently acknowledged was a faked ambush of then Secretary of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile (see Biographies); insurgent moves by the NPA, then numbering only a few hundred; and deteriorating peace and order. The real reasons lay deeper, however. A new political movement. Statehood USA, threatened old-line politicians in the elections scheduled for November 1973. A constitutional convention presided over by former president Macapagal had introduced a resolution that would prohibit any previous president from being reelected. Marcos saw to it that 12 of the elected convention delegates were imprisoned, along with hundreds of opposition politicians and journalists from closed newspapers, and most of the remaining delegates were so intimidated that by early 1973 they produced a constitution that allowed Marcos to remain in office with enlarged powers. The Congress was disbanded, and portions of the chambers where the Senate and House of Representatives had met since 1916 were converted into a museum. With the proclamation of martial law and the 1973 constitution, which was approved by a casual “show of hands” plebiscite, Marcos ensured that he could remain in Malacanang Palace. He subsequently amended this constitution twice; in 1976 to provide for a prime minister and in 1981 to accord the presidency enhanced powers, somewhat after the French model. An interim Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) was chosen in 1978 and given limited legislative functions. At the outset some aspects of martial law were popular with many Filipinos. A reported one-fourth of Manila’s adult male population had carried weapons or hired private bodyguards, and their vendettas were often settled in public places; now many of their weapons were confiscated by the military, as were the weapons of private armies linked to provincial political dynasties. Much of the press had become irresponsible and corrupt, and a significant number of the members of Congress had become champions of special interest groups often linked to their own families. Businessmen were relieved to have strikes ended (though they learned later that Marcos could mandate successive cost-of-living allowances and in time would force them to pay into a fund purportedly established to provide housing for urban employees). Marcos gained support in the countryside by proclaiming the entire Philippines subject to land reform on annually tenanted rice and com lands. He created a Ministry of Information and asserted control of the media. The armed forces were given greatly augmented powers and expanded rapidly. Opposition to martial law first developed among middle-class Filipinos. As the courts were politicized to serve the interests of the fraternity of power holders around the president and his prominent wife, Imelda Romualdez Marcos, that faith in the legal process so essential to fair government dwindled. The extension of Mrs. Marcos’s authority as governor of Metro Manila and concurrently as minister of human settlements, her frequent foreign excursions as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and her blatant spending at home and abroad intensified the discontent. Beloved former president Ramon Magsaysay (left) purged the Philippine government and began rebuilding the economy. Killed in a plane crash in March 1957. he vras replaced by Carlos P. Garcia (far right), whose isolationist policies strang'ed the newborn hope for international market strength. Perhaps inevitably, unrestrained power in the hands of a political cabal and the military had led to growing abuses. Surveillance of persons opposing the regime became routine, and recourse to legal protection was not available. Some who were only suspected of opposition were hustled off to prison. Torture became frequent, partly the vicious product of according unsupervised power to enforcers at all levels. “Salvaging” became the euphemism for the murder — by the military, police, or hired goons — of someone who had been arrested and never brought to trial. Military sweeps in the countryside became the occasion for soldiers to help themselves to chickens, pigs, and sometimes the daughters of rural families. There were some officers who maintained strict discipline and were viewed by the people as protectors. Unfortunately, they were rarely rewarded by their superiors. A Traumatized Society. In the social pressure cooker created by martial law, every feature of the economy and of daily life was affected. Traditionally, three-fourths of the people relied on farming and fishing. As the population grew to its current total of 56 million — eight times what it was in 1900 — pressure on resources became acute. Formerly, most farming was carried on in the lowlands, but now at least half of all rural households are on slopelands, where leaching of soil nutrients and erosion are exacerbated by intense rainfall during the southwest monsoon. Subsistence fishing declined as dynamiting and poisoning to trap fish destroyed breeding waters. Seventy percent of the population, urban and rural, is officially classed as living below the poverty level of a monthly income equivalent to Si 10 for a family of six, and just over half the population suffers from minor to severe malnutrition. Rice is the basic staple of Filipinos, except for a com-eating minority in the central Visayan islands. The Philippines imported rice throughout the early part of the 20th century. Except for Thailand, Burma, and southern Vietnam, which have extensive well-watered alluvial soils, the other countries of Southeast Asia also have been rice importers in modem times. These shortages began to diminish after the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) by the Rockefeller and Ford foundations in 1962. Located on land adjoining the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture at Los Banos, some 65 km (40 mi) southeast of Manila, IRRI has developed numerous new varieties of high-yield rice and greatly improved methods of cultivation. The Philippine government’s “Masagana 99” program of the early and mid-1970s encouraged adoption of the improved technology by assuring rice fanners of adequate credit. Credit was occasionally misused by agents who had to approve loans, and rural banks have yet to collect some of the payments. Yet the results were so successful that in normal years the Philippines is more than self-sufficient in rice and the problem is to keep prices from dropping so low as to discourage farmers. As elsewhere throughout Asia, there is a constant tug-of-war between city dwellers who want cheap rice — and government officials sensitive to their demands — and the farmers. Sugar production has been an important sector of Philippine agriculture since the Chinese first introduced cultivation of the sweet cane in the 14th century. During and after World War I, U.S. technical and financial interests helped create a modem sugar industry. When the U.S. Congress began regulating the sugar industry in 1934 by assigning quotas to producing areas, the Philippines was accorded its share, and this market share was protected in the independence legislation. By the 1960s the islands 7 were supplying between 1 1 and 12% of all sugar consumed by Americans, at prices usually above those of the world market. After the Marcos administration took office, the Philippines encountered difficulty in meeting its U.S. sugar quota, now augmented by part of the unfilled Cuban and Puerto Rican quotas. Against the advice of its National Economic Development Agency, the Philippine government sanctioned construction of 1 8 new sugar mills and 3 new refineries. The failure of the U.S. Congress in 1973 to renew the Sugar Act that had stabilized the industry for 40 years was a disastrous blow to the Philippine economy, though initially the undependability of an open market was masked by a rise in world prices caused by poor growing weather in several producing areas. The Marcos administration concentrated all sugar trading for export in the Philippine Sugar Exchange, a subsidiary of the Philippine National Bank, and later in the Philippine Sugar Commission and the National Sugar Trading Agency headed by Marcos’s former classmate Roberto Benedicto. For a time these monopolies profited at the expense of growers and millers, but as world sugar prices plunged from almost 40 U.S. cents per pound in 1980 to less than 5 cents in 1984, attempts at support fell short. Mills and hacenderos, accustomed to living on credit, went bankrupt. Bacolod City, the capital of Negros Occidental once noted for its hi^ living, became a depressed community. Directly or indirectly, the sugar industry had supported some five mUlion Filipinos, or nearly 10% of the population. Now the monocrop haciendas became scenes of destitution as starving workers marched into the cane fields and took over plots to plant sweet potatoes and other food crops. Insurgent aptators and compassionate priests joined in demanding a new social order. But crop diversification and a change in the semifeudal economy can come only haltingly; even able planters are reluctant to believe the new government of President Aquino when it tells them large-scale sugar production has no real future in a world where com sweeteners and other substitutes are taking over the market. Coconuts traditionally have been the main source of livelihood for nearly one-third of the Philippine popula- tion, and the archipelago has supplied more than 60% of the coconut products moving in world commerce. But despite the vital role of coconuts in its agriculture and export earnings, the Philippines has not pursued scientific research on cultivation, production, and utilization of this “tree of life.” Meanwhile, coconuts have been losing out to other sources of vegetable oil; only coconuts for direct consumption or for specialty export items have maintained their market share. The Marcos administration initiated a program for the coconut industry that may have begun \\vith positive intentions but degenerated into a racket that impoverished small growers throughout the country. Eduardo Cojuangco, one of the wealthiest of Marcos’s cronies and a first cousin of Corazon Aquino, had traded part of his agricultural landholdings in central Luzon for control of Bugsug Island off the eastern coast of Palawan. There he started large- scale production of hybrid seed coconuts. To finance fanners’ purchases of these seed nuts, an export levy was imposed on all copra, and the funds were deposited in the United Coconut Planters Bank, which Cojuangco and his group (including Entile) controlled. To further clinch their monopoly, this group and its allies bought or otherwise gained control of the mills that processed copra and exported oil and copra meal p>cllets for livestock feed. The hybrid coconut seed was an inferior type, but even so the monopoly reaped huge profits. Emmanuel Pelaez, former vice-president and now ambassador to the U.S., was shot by goons for speaking out on behalf of coconut farmers. At the same time, the price of vegetable oils in world markets was declining drastically, and poverty spread through the coconut-growing regions. The situation was made to order for Communist organizers. They did not usually discuss Karl Marx or even Mao Tse-tung. Instead, they talked about the low prices farmers received for their coconuts compared with the world price, and the implication that greedy officials were stealing the difference caught on. The NPA has grown strong in the coconut-growing communities, where their alternative government operates openly. Similarly, in the Muslim-dominated regions of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, where coconuts are also the main cash crop, the machinations of the so-called Coco Bank group have contributed to discontent and rebellion. Timber, including the renowned Philippine mahogany, is another once-valuable source of foreign exchange in decline. In the 1950s and 1960s fortunes were made exploiting easily available stands close to water, but only a few companies made a conscientious effort to preserve the forests for sustained yield. Corrupt senior officials of the Bureau of Forestry allowed clear-cutting without reforestation, and during martial law timber concessions were allotted to relatives and other favourites of the Marcos clan with scant regard for forest protection. Mrs. Marcos ordered 25-year forest concession leases canceled on trumped-up charges, and these areas sometimes became grab bags for local politicians, who sent their tenants to become slash-and-bum squatter farmers. As a result, this may be the last generation of Filipinos to see a virgin tropical rain forest. Quandary' of the Young. While the nation’s economy deteriorated, problems of employment were compounded. At least one-fifth of the employable adults are jobless, and another two-fifths are underemployed. Roughly half of the population is under 21 years of age, and of these 28 million young people, 10 million to 12 million are out- of-school youths who cannot afford to attend high school or college, even if they qualify. They rarely have steady employment, so there is scant opportunity for them to learn skills. The result is apathy and, sometimes, anger. The Spanish made little progress in encouraging edu- cation during the 300-odd years that they controlled the islands, but the Americans instituted a radical change. They brought in teachers who quickly trained more teachers to staff the public schools that were established throughout the country. Once Filipinos saw that those who learned English and earned a diploma were given the jobs in government and business, they avidly took to education. The tradition of education as the largest government enterprise was reinforced after the commonwealth was established in 1935 and has continued since independence. As of 1985, over nine million students were enrolled in public elementary schools and some 490,000 in the much more expensive private schools. Government secondary schools had just under 2 million, while private secondary school students numbered about 1.3 million. There were 319 government-supported colleges and universities — headed by the University of the Philippines system with nine campuses— with a total enrollment of about 230,000. Private colleges and universities numbered 838 with a total enrollment of 1,274,000, and the best private universities, often managed by religious orders, are comparable to the better schools abroad. Despite this enormous educational industry, only two- 8 thirds of the population, at best, is functionally literate. The new constitution to be submitted to a plebiscite in 1987 mandates the development of Filipino as a national language, but neither it nor any of the eight major regional languages offers significant access to technical, scientific, or historical knowledge. It is a rare individual who can get ahead without mastery of English. In reality, the Philippines is a two-class society divided between those who do and those who do not possess effective command of spoken and written English. As the economy deteriorated and opportunities for employment shrank, an ever greater number of Filipinos began to seek opportunities elsewhere. Those with suitable skills sought to participate in the boom in the oil- producing countries. Employment agencies mushroomed in Manila as an estimated 750,000 Filipinos went to the Middle East. Another 165,000 or so are seamen. While British immigration laws allowed, Filipinas were in demand as domestic help in London, where about 10,000 are still employed, and Filipinas also found work as amahs, cooks, and housemaids in Hong Kong and Singapore, where the Chinese now preferred to work in factories or shops. Filipino technicians and hotel staff could be found throughout the region, from Sabah in East Malaysia to Guam and the Pacific island states. The remittances from these migrants became the country’s largest single source of foreign exchange, bringing an estimated equivalent of $1.5 billion annually. In the minds of Filipinos, however, the great land of opportunity has remained the United States. In 1985 alone, some 47,000 received U.S. immigrant visas, and the total since the proclamation of martial law is 480,000 legally admitted immigrants. Well over a million Filipinos are officially present in the U.S., and at least another 500,000 are probably there illegally. Filipinos are now the second largest Asian component of the U.S. population, after the Chinese, and another 500,000 are roistered on the computers at the U.S. consulate general in Manila awaiting their turn to enter. Some 16,000 Filipino doctors were practicing in the U.S. at last count, and several thousand Filipino nurses go to the U.S. each year. In contrast, no regular annual immigrant visas are issued for the Philippines, and the quota for foreign nationals seeking permanent residence is 50 per country per year, nonquota residence admissions are available to those who marry Filipinos. Under the Marcos regime foreigners were forbidden to be executives or to work in any enterprise involving mining, fishing, forestry, agricul- ture, or other natural resources, and they were excluded from numerous other forms of employment, except as consultants specifically allowed by presidential order. The new draft constitution prohibits foreigners from practicing any profession. A foreigner is not allowed to acquire land, even a house lot. After the proclamation of martial law, the Marcos-dominated Supreme Court ruled that any property acquired by Americans in the Philippines during the 27 years after July 4, 1946, had been acquired illegally, thus negating land titles issued under a 1946 con- stitutional amendment allowing Americans to own land. Most severely hurt were thousands of Filipinos who had become U.S. citizens through military service or residence and who now lost property they had saved to buy in their ancestral home. Later Marcos gave special exemption to Filipino-Americans and to Americans resident for at least 15 years, but by then most owners had disposed of their properties at bargain prices. This attitude toward foreign land ownership has put the Philippines at a disadvantage in attracting foreign investment. For those who remain at home but lack influential connections, the struggle to make a living is intense. With roughly one-fourth of Greater Manila’s eight million inhabitants living in shantytowns or slums, it is common to find teams of youngsters sorting through garbage containers, trash piles, and dumps throughout the city. In desperation, unemployed youths enter a life of crime. Syndicates of purse snatchers are often in league with collectors of lagay, the squeeze money jitney drivers and many others pay. After the Marcos regime fell, the extortion money extracted in return for issuing licenses to taxi and other professional drivers was reduced, but the gangs of racketeers that dominate Manila’s harbour have yet to be eliminated. An intriguing new underground industry that has emerged during the past decade and now involves between 450,000 and 500,000 Filipinos is panning and digging for gold, using the crudest methods and frequently without any legal claim. The Philippines was a major gold producer before World War 11, but the mines were wrecked during the Japanese invasion. By the war’s end both knowledge and men had been lost, although old-timers still told tales of rich, lost veins. This began to change after 1973, when the U.S. halted gold sales at $35 per ounce.

Thousands of poor residents in the Tondo district make \"careers’ of garbage picking, reaping their livelihood from the scraps and castoffs of their rich neighbours. 9 sk>'rocketed, the lure of gold reached into remote barrios, holding out an opportunity for the unemployed. Today gold panning is a major actirity in at least 20 localities. Conservatively the free-lance panners and miners recover one-half to one gram of gold a day, worth S6 to Si 2, and in the jungles of eastern Mindanao the occasional schoolboy becomes a peso millionaire. The best estimates are that over $1 billion in gold annually is extracted and smu^ed out of the Philippines, where government regulations prohibit private trading in the metal. Surreptitious export of gold is not new to the islands. During the two decades when Marcos was chief of state, a major effort was made to locate the gold and other valuables buried by the Japanese when they were facing defeat in 1945. A special recovery unit of the military focused on this search, and a mint that smelted and refined gold was established in Quezon Cits'. Estimates vary as to hosv much of this gold Marcos and his associates removed from the country, but some svho have done considerable research calculate that its present value would be worth more than the nation’s foreign debt. Benigno (“Ninoy\") Aquino. The decision of former senator Benigno Aquino, known popularly as Ninoy, to return to the Philippines from the U.S. on Aug. 21, 1983. was to prove fatal to him and, in time, to the Marcos dictatorship. By fateful coincidence, it was 12 years to the day since Aquino had escaped assassination when he was delayed in arriring at a Liberal Party rally at the Plaza Miranda, where grenades tossed on the platform killed and wounded a number of candidates. The son of a prominent family in central Luzon and possessed of notable energy and wit, he had been the youngest correspondent to cover the Korean War. He had married Corazon Cojuangco, the attractive and well-educated daughter of one of the richest men in the Philippines. Like him. she was from Tarlac, where both families held sugar and rice lands. In the pattern of young, politically ambitious Filipinos, he was elected, in succession, mayor of his hometown, governor, and senator. Throughout his career as a prosincial politician, Aquino had played the rough-and-tumble role that survival de- manded. He used his own armed guards and made deals for support svith local power brokers, who in some Tarlac municipalities included former Huks. This was part of the charge brought a^inst him when, under martial law, he was tried by a military court, refused to defend himself on the grounds that the court lacked civil jurisdiction, and was convicted of murder and treason and sentenced to death. Imprisoned for seven years, Aquino became a changed man, reading and thinking, evolving ideas on nonviolence based on the writings of Gandhi and others. For 40 days he went on a hunger strike. When he suffered cardiac problems. Marcos authorized his leave to go to the U.S. for surgery. He spent three years with his family near Boston, studied at Harvard, lectured, and visited abroad, including the Middle East. Reports that Marcos was critically ill prompted Aquino's supporters to urge him to return. Although strenuous efforts were made to disguise the president’s illness and his American physicians have been reluctant to talk, it appears that Marcos had a kidney transplant early in August 1983 and that it was less than successful. In mid-August members of the Cabinet reportedly said Mrs. Marcos had told them to prepare for the succession. In that time of acute political tensions, the Philippine chief of staff (and an old Marcos associate), Gen. Fabian Ver. took extraordinary security precautions. Military men met the China .-\\irlines flight bringing Aquino from Taiwan. and he was separated from accompanjing newsmen, led down an outside service stairway, and shot in the head from behind before he reached the tarmac. Rolando Galman, a small-time gangster, was shot at about the same time, before or after he was pushed from a nearby waiting van. In subsequent hearings and at a staged trial, the government tried to make the case that Galman was a Communist agent sent to murder Aquino, but this farce was so crudely managed that it only reinforced the belief that Aquino’s murder had been ordered by the highest authority, A new trial was ordered after Corazon Aquino took power but, meanwhile, some of the original 26 defendants, including General Ver, had left the country. Radio Veritas, the Roman Catholic broadcasting station, made its reputation on August 21. While the Marcos- intimidated media tried to ignore the assassination. Radio Veritas was giving an eyewitness account. Ten days later nearly two million mourners followed Aquino’s funeral cortege through Greater Manila. Shocked and angered by the flagrant murder of Marcos’s most outspoken political opponent, who had become an idol to many young people, the nation at last began to stir. TTie Price of .4bnsing Power. Officially Marcos had abolished martial law in January 1981, but he had retained powers to issue commitment and preventive detention orders, and he kept in force the presidential decrees and letters of instruction through wluch he had controlled the society. Relatives and cronies continued to receive favours, and opponents were targets of the military. At one stage “secret marshals” were authorized to kffl on sight — supposedly they were after gangsters, but innocents also suffered. Qaudio Teehankee, appointed chief justice by Mrs. Aquino and one of the few jurists who had defied Marcos, said later in a pubUc address; During those 14 years [1972-86], we were a nation lost in the woods of history. In place of truth reigned falsehood, disinformation, outright deception and fraud. Justice, freedom, equality became mere words used to cover crime against human dignity and basic human decency. Public office lost all concept of pubh'c trust and public accountability — lost was the distinction between what belonged to the state and what belonged to the servants of the state.

PHOTOGRAPHS AnO» MERNANOeZ— SYGMA all authoritarian gods — that of national security. Every excess and abuse of power — every disregard of the sacredness of human life and liberty — every suppression of free expression — was premised on national security, even though it involved nothing more than the ruler’s perpetuation in office and the security of relatives and some officials in high positions and their protection from public exposure in the press of their acts of venality and deception in government. These were years of systematic undermining of the national will ... of systematic looting and plunder of the economy. And it seemed to matter little which came first, the bankrupting of the national treasury or of public morality, we ended up bankrupt in both. In an effort to give credibility to his government, Marcos called elections for mid-May 1984 to replace the interim legislative body with a full-fledged National Assembly. Every device was used to ensure that Marcos’s Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL; New Society Movement) would svin; candidates were given lavish funds, public works were manipulated to their advantage, and in some districts newly emerged private armies were employed to register voters and to see that they got to the polls and cast prop- erly marked ballots. Fortunately, the National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) was allowed to function, mobilizing volunteers across the country as private poll watchers who also participated in the tabulation of results. The opposition won one-third of the 182 members elected to the assembly, although Marcos had the power to name another 30. While the election left the KBL in control of the legislature, the opposition learned that the elective process, scarred by fraud and violence though it was, could be used to gain an independent voice in national affairs. In November 1984 Marcos survived another health crisis and began recovering some of his earlier vitality; he may have had a second kidney transplant, although the nature of his illness has been carefully concealed. Meanwhile, the mismanagement of government and abuses of power were coming home to roost. There was a massive flight of capital out of the country as. one after another, the crony companies went bankrupt and the owners moved both their wealth and themselves abroad. As a result. the government institutions, like the Government Service Insurance System into which civil servants pay their retirement funds, no longer could provide savings for capital investment. Having borrowed recklessly abroad, the Philippines was now compelled to adopt the austerity program set by the International Monetary Fund before foreign private lenders would agree to roll over loans. The political circus was ending. Marcos remained intransigent. He refused to retire Genera] Ver as chief of staff, despite the popular conviction that Ver was involved in the Aquino assassination. The general, who used military intelligence funds casually for political and personal purposes on behalf of the Marcos family, seemed to have become the president’s “security blanket.” An indication of Marcos’s fear of elimination was his stubborn refusal to have a vice-president. At this juncture the Roman Catholic Church and the U.S. government asserted themselves. The church, which claims slightly over two-thirds of Filipinos as communicants, wus prompted to open criticism of the Marcos regime both by the outraged consciences of its leaders and by pressure from wthin. As for the U.S., the Aquino assassination had focused American attention on the calamitous drift in Philippine affairs. Particularly disturbing to the U.S was the deterioration in the armed forces. The U.S. loss of confidence became esident wth the srisit of Sen. Paul Laxalt (Rep., Nev.) to Manila in October 1985. La.\\alt was not a specialist on the Philippines, but he was a close personal friend of Pres. Ronald Reagan, and when he told Marcos that the old political shell game had ended, no one in Malacanang could doubt his word. About two weeks later, on November 3, Marcos announced that he was calling a “snap” election for president and xice-president on Feb. 7. 1986. He seems to have calculated that he could neutralize domestic and U.S. pressure to clean up his government by staging his own reelection. Apparently he assumed that enough votes could be bought to ensure his \\ictory. Commitment to Democracy. Marcos had underestimated the determination of Filipinos to win their freedom. Reluctantly.

Her supporters reasoned that she would attract sympathy and, as a female, she was less likely than a man to be murdered. Two cousins, Joaquin (“Chino”) Roces, a former publisher, and Jesus Marcos (“Tuting”) Roces, former vice-mayor of Manila, took the lead in organizing the Cory Aquino for President Movement, with the former serving as the first chairman. Within a few weeks they and their covolunteers had collected 1.3 million signatures. Salvador Laurel, the scion of a prominent political family, also wanted to be a presidential candidate, but after intense jockeying and the intervention of Manila’s archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, a Unido PDP-Laban coalition was formed with Laurel as Mrs. Aquino’s vice-presidential running mate and yellow as its colour. Unido (United Democratic Organization) was Laurel’s party and the only one in the coalition registered with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and therefore authorized to have watchers in polling booths. PDP (Pilipino Democratic Party) was headed by Aquilino Pimentel, a Mindanao politician, and Laban (Lakas ng Bayan or Strength of the Nation), established by Benigno Aquino, was the umbrella for several groups of varying strength and ideology. It was an extraordinary campaign. On one side was the professional political machine of President Marcos, his vice-presidential candidate, Arturo Tolentino, and the KBL party organization. They were never short of money, and they dominated the electronic and print media. However, their campaign was handicapped by Marcos’s lack of vitality. Marcos also was burdened by nearly two decades of promises that he had failed to keep, while his family and cronies conspicuously enriched themselves. The contrast with the Cory Aquino campaign was startling. She was the first woman ever to seek the Philippine presidency. Initially shy, this mother of five children soon gained support with her engaging simplicity. When Marcos denigrated her competence, she challenged him to come out and “stand up like a woman” to debate. Her organization, managed by leading independent busi- nessmen and committed priests, depended on volunteers who gave their labour and paid their own way to the immense rallies that filled Manila’s historic Luneta Park, facing Manila Bay. Equally vital was the performance of Namfrel, led by modem-minded businessman Jose Concepcion and banker Vicente Jayme. With roughly 500,000 volunteers, Namfrel belatedly won from Comelec the role of representing the public with poll watchers in some 90,000 precincts. Still, the old political machines manipulated registration, and many voters in opposition strongholds were disenfranchised. Election day, February 7, was tense. By law the police and military are required to keep their distance from the polling booths. In many communities violence erupted as hoodlums tried to upset peaceful polling; most strong-arm tactics were on the KBL side, although the opposition occasionally tried to retaliate. Women and young Filipinos, many of whom had never known a real election, struggled to protect the balloting. The turnout among an estimated 27 million eligible voters approached 90%, but not all of them succeeded in casting a ballot. Media coverage was exceptional; nearly 900 foreign journalists and cameramen joined the domestic press to provide graphic accounts from major cities and a few rural areas. Marcos had specifically invited a U.S. congressional delegation to observe the voting, and a larger international contingent of observers joined in visiting provincial voting precincts. As an older Filipino politician explained: “There are two ways you cheat on elections. One is when the votes are cast and the other is when they are counted. Marcos is depending mostly on the latter.” After votes were tabulated in view of the poll watchers, including representatives of both political parties and Namfrel, the ballot boxes were taken to the municipal and city treasurers. Canvassing of the total vote was done at the provincial and chartered city level, and returns were transmitted to Comelec. This cumbersome process took days to complete, and Comelec, which was packed with Marcos appointees, used the opportunity to tamper with the final tally. On the basis of that taJly, the National Assembly proclaimed Marcos and Tolentino as winners, to the consternation of most Filipinos and much of the world. Namfrel, meanwhile, had been tabulating results based on reports from its watchers around the country, and Father James Reuter and his associates in the Catholic Broadcasters Association were sending tabulated voting returns to Namfrel from their nationwide network of radio stations and mobile transmitters. Both tallies showed that massive manipulation had not prevented Aquino and Laurel from gamering over 58% of the votes. People Power. Faced Mth the National Assembly’s proclamation of Marcos’s reelection, Aquino and Laurel led a prayer rally at the Luneta and adjoining Rizal Park on February 16, where some two million people massed in protest. They then traveled to the southern islands to mobilize passive resistance, including a boycott of companies controlled by the Marcos cronies. TTie Catholic bishops’ conference issued a blunt denunciation of terror and cheating aimed at thwarting the people’s will. Meanwhile, a drama was being played out within the Philippine military. Months earlier several groups with a shared aversion to the corruption and favouritism of the Marcos-Ver regime had been preparing secretly for 12 In a display of unarmed \"people power,\" supporters of Juan Ponce Enrile and Fidel Ramos — who withdrew their loyalty from Marcos — block government tanks outside the Ministry of Defense.

One was led by Minister of National Defense Enrile and his younger associates, who had grouped men and weapons in the Cagayan Valley of northeastern Luzon. Another was RAM, the Reformed Armed Forces Movement, composed primarily of younger officers. A third consisted of retired generals and colonels who wanted to restore professionalism to the armed forces and end the Communist-led insurgency. These groups and others had been quietly planning a coup. The announcement of the election led them to postpone their moves, but when they saw that Marcos intended to remain in power, they prepared for action. One plan was to cross the Pasig River in assault boats with the help of collaborators in the Presidential Security Command, kidnap President and Mrs. Marcos, General Ver, and their immediate associates, and proclaim a new, predominantly civilian government. Only hours before this plan was to be initiated. Col. Gregorio Honasan, Emile’s chief of security, learned that a double agent in the Presidential Security Command had betrayed the plot to General Ver’s son, and a trap had been arranged. As Marcos’s people and Ver prepared to mobilize troops to capture the defense headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo, Enrile invited Gen. Fidel Ramos, the vice-chief of staff, commander of the Philippine Constabulary, and a West Point graduate, to join him in support of the truly elected government. Enrile and Ramos later moved across the highway to the constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame, where, with some 400 soldiers, they made their stand. For a time it seemed that the Marcos-Ver forces would succeed in destroying the defectors — the telephone lines remained open between Marcos and Enrile. Then Cardinal Sin appealed over Radio Veritas for the people to protect Camp Crame, and they came by the hundreds of thousands, blocked the tanks, prayed for the soldiers to join their peaceful revolution, and kept \\igil through three nights. As a steady stream of army, air force, and na\\y units joined General Ramos — a count he reported regularly on Radio Veritas — Ver became a general with few troops to command. An untold stoiy was the role played by commanding officers’ wives, who in several critical instances persuaded their husbands to ignore the orders to move their troops against the revolution. In this confused period, Marcos’s followers succeeded in wrecking the transmission towers of Radio Veritas, forcing it to broadcast on a weak signal from a borrowed station. The revolutionary forces soon recouped by capturing, with limited bloodshed, the government’s Channel 4 and the crony-owned Channel 9, leaving the Marcos forces without television coverage. Aquino was in Cebu City as the struggle was coming to a head in Greater Manila. She flew back to Manila, and it was decided that she would take her oath of office. At the Club Filipino in a Greater Manila suburb, she was duly and simply sworn in as the seventh president of the Philippines on Feb. 25, 1986, with Laurel, Enrile, Ramos, and other supporters at her side. A few hours later, with his popular following melting away, Marcos proceeded with his own inauguration at Malacanang Palace, guarded by troops from the mobs that threatened to storm in. It was a sad final gesture by a man who could have had an honoured place in his country’s history. Instead he desperately sought any face-saving opportunity to stay and avoid mob vengeance. In a transpacific telephone call to Senator Laxalt in Washington, D.C., Marcos got the final word to “cut and cut clean.” Late on February 25 Marcos telephoned Enrile and requested him to ask the U.S. ambassador, Stephen Bosworth, for help in leaving. That night the Americans arranged for four helicopters to carry Marcos, his family, servants, and close cronies to Clark Air Force Base, but they had such mountains of luggage that some of them had to travel by road. President Reagan had offered asylum in the U.S., and early the next morning the escapees and tons of their personal effects were loaded on two U.S. Air Force planes for the flight to Guam and, after a layover, to Hawaii. In arranging their departure, the U.S. government undoubtedly saved the lives of Marcos and his wife, for the crowds that broke into the palace grounds that night were lusting for blood. The action also helped minimize the cost in life and property, which inevitably would have risen if the power struggle had been prolonged. Marcos later suggested that the Americans kidnapped him and that all he had wanted was to go home to his native province of Ilocos, but in fact he knew where he was going on each leg of the journey. A New Era. The Aquino-Laurel government is avowedly revolutionary. The National Assembly was disbanded, gov- ernors and mayors were replaced with appointed officers, and Marcos’s 1973 constitution was replaced by a Freedom Constitution incorporating selected elements of previous statutes. Some of Marcos’s presidential decrees remain in 13 force. Meanwhile, President Aquino also rules by decree, though with comparative restraint. The judiciary is being revamped and cleaned up, and new institutions include a Human Rights Commission to investigate past misdeeds of police and security agencies (but not the NPA). A board of respected retired generals is screening the military for those who have abused their positions or illegally enriched themselves. Most of the generals Marcos kept on past retirement age have been retired, and nearly two dozen younger officers have been promoted to general rank. A Presidential Commission on Good Government under former senator Jovito Salonga is screening the business empires accumulated by the Marcos clan and cronies and sequestering some of the properties. The PCGG has only begun to recover small portions of the immense wealth the former ruler, his family, and his favourites shipped abroad, often under covert identities. In a plebiscite scheduled for Feb. 2, 1987, Filipinos are to decide whether to adopt the new constitution drafted by a 47-member Constitutional Commission appointed by President Aquino. In its essentials, this draft constitution contains many of the provisions of the 1935 constitution. One change is that presidents are limited to a single six-year term. There is a distinct separation of powers between the executive, the judicial, and the legislative branches, and the latter will again be composed of two houses, a 24-member Senate and a 250-member House of Representatives. Senators can serve a maximum of two six-year terms, and representatives wll be limited to three consecutive three- year terms. A comprehensive Bill of Rights seeks to guard against future repetitions of the abuses perpetrated by the Marcos dictatorship. Capital punishment is abolished, and no person may be imprisoned for debt or nonpayment of poll tax. Independent commissions are provided for the civil service, elections, and audit. Two autonomous geographic regions are created — for the minority tribes of the northern Luzon cordillera and for Muslim areas of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago — each to be governed according to an organic act passed by the new congress. That congress is to be elected on the second Monday in May 1987. The Aquino government has made an encouraging beginning, but it confronts enormous problems. The Cabinet is less than unified; most ministers had not worked together before and joined the coalition chiefly to defeat Marcos. Several Cabinet members have already set their sights on campaigning for the 24 at-large Senate seats to be filled in May 1987, and some have presidential ambitions. The New Armed Forces of the Philippines are upgrading their organizations professionally. At year’s end Rafael Ileto became the new minister of defense; this low-key retired former vice-chief of staff, who served as ambassador to Iran and Thailand, is a graduate of West Point, fought with the U.S. Army in World War 11, and transferred only in 1950 to the Philippine Army, where he organized the rangers. Gradually factionalism atnong the military is being reduced and deficiencies are being corrected, but there are differences between the military and some civilian Cabinet ministers on tactical deployment. Moro soldiers of the southwestern islands are being paid 1,500 pesos (appro.ximaiely $75) upon enlistment and given uniforms, weapons, training, and other com- pensations, apparently with funding from Islamic sources abroad. The NPA in some areas has done even better; in addition to the same 1,500 pesos paid to the enlistee, an extra 1,000 pesos is given for goodwill to neighbours who will be deprived of the new recruit’s assistance. Official estimates of 23,500 to 26,000 hard-core armed NPA troops understate reality. Armed insurgents have been operating virtually where they choose, capitalizing on frustration among the young and offering a Communist vision of Utopia. Through the NDF, which serves as their political umbrella, the NPA and CPP negotiated a cease-fire with the government early in December 1986. The insurgents’ demands for a coalition government, integration of their troops into the national armed forces, and removal of U.S. military bases were rejected. Instead, the insurgents were urged to seek their goals through the parliamentary process, raising the issue of legalizing the Communist Party. The government has not provided meaningful opportunities for those who surrender, and regional Communist commanders ruthlessly block followers who want to return to the government side. The Communists have recouped their fortunes and expanded their power since their low point, when they boycotted the elections and the “people power” revolution of February 1986, and they now use flamboyant public relations to further improve their image. Within the government, leaders haVe disagreed on how to cope with this growing insurgent challenge that commands both guns and votes. Now that political negotiations are beginning, they must resolve their differences. It was unrealistic to expect that Corazon Aquino could fulfill all the popular expectations that her victory generated. Nevertheless, many Filipinos feel let down. Few recognize that the civil service had become so demoralized and mired in bad habits that long, sustained effort will be required to make it effective. Corruption has been curbed only in some ministries and government agencies. Dramatic gestures of public redress, such as President Magsaysay’s Presidential Complaints and Action Commission at Malacanang Palace, through which any citizen could appeal to him, have not been implemented. The Tanodbayan, designed to function as an ombudsman, is itself bogged down in bureaucracy and busy with the new trial of those accused in the slaying of Benigno Aquino. Government banks are just beginning to turn over foreclosed properties for distribution to the landless. The desperate desire of at least two-thirds of all Filipino families to own a home with a lot where they can grow some food has yet to be met, although housing construction could be a major source of jobs. The challenge confronting President Aquino and her administration in dealing with the Philippines’ pressing needs and raising funds, chiefly abroad, demands inspired leadership. This first woman president of the republic is surrounded by a trusted inner circle that, observers report, sometimes shields her from realistic awareness of the fundamental problems of rural Filipinos. She cannot do everything. Like other national leaders, she must pick and choose among the innumerable demands for her attention. Neither is wisdom easily attained by equally hard-pressed Cabinet ministers who have little time to think beyond the immediate future. Like most governments in the less developed world, that of the Philippines was not designed for development; it is primarily an administrative structure. Filipinos who care about their country are challenged as never before. Passionately concerned civilians joined with like-minded military^ to make the February revolution. The task ahead is less dramatic yet tougher. How Filipinos cope with the tortuous problems of their society will decide whether their mustering of popular action to topple a truculent dictatorship was a transient, though glorious, historical episode or a major step in the building of a prosperous and genuine democracy. 14 Two Bicentennials: An Introduction T wo of the world’s leading constitutional democra- cies will be celebrating 200-year anniversaries in the years 1987-88. In 1987 the United States commem- orates the creation of its Constitution by the convention that met at Philadelphia from May through September 1787. Australia’s celebration is of a different sort. While delegates from most of the 13 American states were arriv- ing in Philadelphia, a fleet of 1 1 ships departed England for Australia carrying about 1,500 persons. These indi- viduals would become the first colonists of a new nation when they arrived at their destination in January 1788. These two bicentennials are obviously quite different in their focus. Australia’s festivities look back to the country’s very origins. As such, it is an anniversary more comparable to remembering the first English settlements in the United States, at Jamestown or Plymouth, in 1607 and 1620, respectively. The United States, on the other hand, was already in place as a settled, well-populated country in 1787. The 13 former colonies had declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 (occasion for yet another bicen- tennial celebration in 1976). In 1787 they were about to take the fateful step of forming themselves into one nation, instead of a weak confederation of 13 quarreling and mutually suspicious states. A similar federation of states would not come into being in Australia until 1901, when the act creating the federation came into effect. If the two bicentennials are quite different in what they celebrate, there are, nevertheless, historical undercurrents that connect the two nations. There were, in each case, similar patterns of colonization. Both were colonized largely by immigrants from the British Isles. When they arrived at their destinations, whether North America or Australia, they claimed to find an empty continent wait- ing for settlement. In reality, of course, the continents were only said to be empty. Each had its native popula- tions: North America its hundreds of Indian tribes and Australia its Aborigines. Each of these populations, in time, became a disadvantaged minority. They lost much of their land and became underclasses virtually subject to the increasingly more numerous white colonists. A more positive assessment of the two bicentennials can be made by regarding the constitutional traditions of each country. Both nations were rooted in English con- stitutionalism, as it had developed since Magna Carta in 1215. These very issues of constitutionalism, or represen- tative government, and of the rights of Englishmen first became paramount in the North American colonies and divided the colonies from the mother country. What happened in North America cast a long shadow on the later development of the Commonwealth of Na- tions. After the American Revolution, no other British colony found it necessary to declare its independence unilaterally until Rhodesia did so in 1965 (but for quite different reasons). Britain assessed the damage of 1776 and moved more cautiously with the remaining colonies. Another positive consideration is the impact the Con- stitution of 1787 has had around the world In the year the new Constitution began functioning, France launched its revolution. Within two decades the Spanish colonies of Central and South America would pattern their rev- olutions (although not necessarily their governments) on what had happened in the United States. The experiment of 1787, giving rise to what is now the oldest government with a written constitution, also served to inspire the future independent members of the Commonwealth. The forms of government are not precisely the same; Australia has a parliamentary. Cabinet system, in contrast to the separation of powers in the federal government of the United States. But the persistent development of political democracy, inaugurated in England and carried forward in the United States, has been emulated in Australia’s historical progress. In the follosving pages the two bicentennials are exam- ined in the context of historical significance and current relevance. Mortimer J. Adler, philosopher, author, and chairman of the Board of Editors of Encyclopxdia Britannica, re- flects on the role played by the United States Constitution in creating a nation and a sense of nationhood. Kenneth Inglis, professor of history at the Australian National University and a scholar of Australian and American government, explores the bicentennial celebra- tion about to start in his continent-country, svith occa- sional asides on the American experience. 15 BY MORTIMER J. ADLER ^he bicentennial celebrated by the United States of America in 1976 was the 200th anniversary of its Declaration of Independence, but assuredly not of the establishment of the nation the world knows by that name today. To be sure, that Declaration spoke for “the United States of America,” but in fact the 13 rebellious colonies that there proclaimed themselves states were united only in their resolution to fight for independence from the British crown. Indeed they reached that agreement only after more than a year of actual warfare. The only link between the states was a Continental Congress, which did not even have the power to levy taxes but had to raise by persuasion funds to support the Continental — not U.S. — Army. In 1781 the Continental Congress managed to work out a compact to connect the 1 3 sovereign states in some kind of formal structure. And that pact, the “Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union between the States,” quickly proved incapable of perpetuating union, or even of preserving the hard-won peace. In order to conduct foreign and even interstate trade, to settle boundary quarrels, indeed to coexist, the states were obliged to negotiate with one another. The peacetime union proved to be as shaky as that of the wartime days before the Articles of Confederation. At last, out of a series of meetings among a few of the states over navigation and fishing rights grew the momentous convention at Philadelphia in the summer of 1787. From united states to United States. Although the delegations of the 12 states' that attended the Philadelphia convention were not authorized by their legislatures to do so, once there a majority of them recognized the need “to form a more perfect Union,” and consciously set about creating a “Constitution for the United States of America.” The document framing and formulating that more perfect union was properly called a “constitution” for, once ratified, it did two things a constitution should do. Both were things the Articles of Confederation did not do and could never do, for the Articles had merely established an alliance of sovereign states, and no more created an organic union than does the Charter of the United Nations. In the first place, the great document of 1787 constituted a single, sovereign state out of the 13 formerly independent states. In the second place, the Constitution of the United States established a government, outlined its purposes, limited its scope, identified by name and function the several branches of that government, and defined the offices of each branch, specifying how they should be filled and how the authority and power vested in each should be related one to another. While they were engaged in their war for independence, the former colonies might properly have referred to themselves as “the united states of America,” but not until the adoption of the Constitution could they be styled “the United States of America” as the world now understands that term. At Gettysburg in 1863, Abraham Lincoln said, “Four score and seven years ago [1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .” How are we to interpret that? Clearly, Lincoln meant by it a new people, for the term nation that he used originated in the Latin word nascor, “to be bom”; the use of “nation” in the sense of nation-state is a 20th-century development. And a new people was indeed brought forth by the Declaration, but it remained for the Constitution to fashion that people into a single nation-state out of 13 formerly sovereign states. Strictly speaking in contemporary terms, it remained for the adoption and implementation of the Constitution to make a nation of the American people. Put another way, the Constitution forged the American nation into a state. It created the first federal republic in history. The phrase “United States” appears twice in the Preamble to the Constitution; We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. In its first appearance in the Preamble, the phrase should have been written “united states,” as it should have appeared in the Declaration, for when the Constitution was promulgated by the 1787 convention the 13 quarrelsome, independent states were still linked only by the Articles of Confederation. UBRAHY OF CONGRCSS The Preamble to the Constitution defines in brief the encompassing purpose of the document.

TM£ GRANGER COLLECHOtf NEW YORK In its second appearance in the Preamble, the capital initial letters in United States are appropriate, because that phrase should be interpreted as prospective. It refers to the nation or national state that will come into existence only when the document of 1787 has been ratified and implemented. For ratification, two-thirds of the 13 states had to adopt the proposed Constitution, and that did not come to pass until June of 1788, ivith the other states falling into line somewhat later. Not until 1789 was the new charter actually implemented, with the United States Congress supplanting the Continental Congress, and with the inauguration of George Washington to the new office of president of the United States. In political as well as biologic life there is a period of gestation between conception and birth. In American history we may think of 1789 as the birth of the United States of America, and the adoption of the Constitution by the Philadelphia convention in August of 1787 as its conception. The months of turbulent debate over ratification that went on between those dates were its period of gestation. In some human cultures, age is counted from concep- tion, rather than from birth. In these terms 1987 is the bicentennial of the United States. That bicentennial can also be appropriately seen as a three-year celebration to conclude on April 30, 1989 (the bicentenary of Washing- ton’s first inauguration as president). But whatever date or dates we select, the great accomplishment of 1787 is well worth celebrating. Indeed much of the world has celebrated it for many of its 200 years, not infrequently by imitation. The Birth of Constitutional Government. The idea of constitutional government, as radically contrasted with royal or despotic regimes, is as old as ancient Greece. We are told that among Aristotle’s political works was a treatise on Greek constitutions in which he described and discussed more than 100 of them, although his account of only one — that of Athens— has survived. Plato distinguished legitimate governments from ille- gitimate ones by the supremacy of laws instead of the supremacy of men. Following Plato, Aristotle defined a constitution as the fundamental law that conferred rightful authority, and in one remarkable passage he described those who first founded a state as the greatest of benefactors. Although we do not know, it is reasonable to conjecture that he had in mind Solon and Lycurgus, who framed constitutions, respectively, for Athens and Sparta. In earlier societies, the people living under the rule of Egyptian pharaohs or Persian kings were subjects or slaves, not citizens. That kind of government — absolute, royal, or despotic — is appropriate for families, Aristotle said, but not for states. States do not come into existence until governments are constituted — until constitutions come into existence. It was the invention of constitutions by the ancient Greeks that introduced the state and, with it, the concept of citizenship. While it was manifestly not the first ever created, it is true that the Constitution of the United States was the first national constitution ever deliberately drafted by a group of men meeting for that purpose in what they themselves called a constitutional convention. And with ratification of the Constitution by the ninth state, constitutional government began in the United States at one fell swoop. This was not at all the case with the oldest constitutional government in the modem world, that which began in England with Magna Carta in 1215. Magna Carta was only the first step in a long series of enactments that limited the power of English kings, increased the power of representative parliaments, and made those who voted for members of parliament self-governing citizens as well as subjects of the king. It is worth noting that although we speak of the British constitution as an unwritten one, all of the enactments that cumulatively comprise British constitutional law are in fact written. They simply are not gathered into a single document. The fact that the U.S. Constitution as promulgated in 1787 and ratified in 1788 is a single instrument is one of its unique qualities. Toward a More Perfect Union. In their Preamble to the Constitution, the American founding fathers declared their intention “to form a more perfect Union.” The greater perfection they sought, and attained, lies in a single fact. Under the Articles of Confederation, each of the 13 states retained its individual sovereignty, not diminished one whit or in any respect by its confederacy with the other 12 states. But under the Constitution each of the 13 states surrendered all of its external sovereignty, both in relation to the other American states and in relation to foreign states in the arena of international affairs. 17 Yet the 13 retained a significant measure of internal sovereignty. Each state remained sovereign in relation to the U.S. citizens living within that particular state. The Constitution introduced the novel concept of dual sovereignty; each state sovereign within its own boundaries and in the governance of its internal affairs; and it made the federal union of states sovereign in war and peace, in international trade and commerce, in foreign relations, and in all other international affairs. Part and parcel of the notion of dual sovereignty was that of dual citizenship: the citizen of each individual state was at the same time a citizen of the United States. Under the Articles of Confederation, citizenship was unitary; a citizen of Virginia had no special standing in New York. Sovereignty was unitary, too. While the states retained their external sovereignty, as they did under the Articles of Confederation, they were free to make treaties and alliances with one another, and ultimately to make war with one another. Although actual military' action benveen states never quite came to pass under the Confederation, disputes over trade, access to seaports, navigation and fishing rights in shared bodies of water, and other such problems demonstrated to the wise men in all the states the perils and shortcomings embedded in the Articles of Confederation and ultimately led them to Philadelphia in 1787. The very same concerns were repeatedly invoked in the campaign for ratification. Particularly in the first nine of The Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton. James Madison, and John Jay called attention to the intermittent but incessant warfare among the separate unfederated sovereign states of Europe. What could prevent the same thing from befalling the unfederated American states? Nothing, they answered, except the more perfect union offered by the federal constitution and the surrender by the states of their external sovereignty in relation to one another as well as in relation to other states abroad. For all their participation in United States citizenship, most Americans continued to think of themselves first as citizens of their particular states. This remained the case throughout the country' until well after the Civil War, and in the seceding states for many decades after that. Gradually, however, and especially since the turn of the 19th century, the Americans’ sense of U.S. citizenship as primary has spread to the point where it is almost universal. The Slavery Issue. The fact that that kind of popular perception of federal citizenship as primary was so long in coming to pass reflects another important truth about the Constitution. Its framers sought a more perfect union; they did not promise a perfect one. Many differences between states and regions were worked out in the Philadelphia convention, but the fundamental division between North and South over the issue of slavery was beyond resolution and so was compromised in the convention in Article I Sections 2 and 9, and in Article V. The former section, dealing with apportionment of the House of Representatives, counted the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The “other persons\" were slaves. Slaveiy' was thus acknowledged by the Constitution, and the sparsely populated southern, slavcholding states were allowed to count slaves toward their congressional apportionment — ljut only at a reduced rate (three-fifths) so as not to inflate their share of representatives enough to threaten the numerical superiority of the northern states. Article I Section 9 provided, in its first paragraph, that this unnatural condition had to prevail for at least 20 years: The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, . . . Thus antislavery delegates traded tacit acceptance of slavery now for congressional freedom to outlaw it 20 years hence. Article V provided for amending the Constitution, and its penultimate clause protected the 20-year inviolability of slavery written into Article I Section 9: provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Causes in the Ninth Section of the First Article; . . . (The fourth clause prohibited a head tax on the “importation of certain persons.”) Thus from the language of the Constitution it is evident that the charter established only a more perfect, and not a perfect.

HUGH TALWAN to continue, giving to the Congress or to the legislatures of the states the means to propose amendments, always “provided that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.” The tensions over slavery that existed within the Philadelphia Convention and that were compromised there, ultimately by postponement, of course continued, and worsened, and fed the approaching Civil War — not a civil war like Oliver Cromwell’s against King Charles I, but a war of secession that sought to dissolve the federal union. Had the amendments (XIII, XIV, and XV^) to the Constitution that followed the victory of the northern states been an integral part of the Constitution itself, the Civil War might have been prevented, but scholars of the Convention of 1787 are virtually unanimous that a serious attempt to force those provisions on the Constitution would have disrupted the convention and prevented it from finishing the work. The fullness of time, however, brought to pass those amendments that could not have been part of the original document. Slavery was outlawed, not 20 but almost 80 years after the Constitution was adopted. Equality was an idea on which the founders could not agree in 1787. Ideas of the Constitution. A number of ideas were to be found in the Preamble to the Constitution, some of them foreshadowed in the words of the Declaration. They are the ideas of Justice Domestic Tranquility (or Civil Peace) The Common Defense (or National Security) The General Welfare The Blessings of Liberty All of these ideas are also ideals. They were ideals in the 18th century at the inception of the Constitution. Some of them, especially justice and liberty, along with the ideals of equality and of democracy, were realized more in successive amendments than in the Constitution itself. This is especially true of the first ten amendments. knowTi collectively as the Bill of Rights, but also of the Thirteenth. Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Fourth amendments, all of which gradually moved the federal republic more and more in the direction of democracy, by extending suffrage and remosing obstacles to it. In these amendments we find such phrases as “equal protection of the laws” and “due process of law” that evoke the idea — and the ideal — of a government of laws. It is worthy of note that the substance of many future amendments, and particularly of the Bill of Rights, was discussed at great length in the Convention of 1787. George Mason, one of the most influential of the founders, opposed ratification of the Constitution to which he contributed so much because it did not include a Bill of Rights. The first Congress under the Constitution proposed 12 such amendments, of which the 10 comprising the Bill of Rights were promptly adopted by the states. In this light, the text of Article V, the article that enabled the Constitution to correct itself as mandated by future experience, may be a fit subject for special notice in the celebration of the real American bicentennial: The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. This essay is in part a paraphrase of and in part excerpts from the opening chapters of a book written by Mortimer Adler, entitled ll'e Hold These Truths: Understanding the Ideas and Ideals of the Constitution, to be published by Macmillan in the bicentennial year of 1987. 'Rhode Island did not participate but did ratify the resulting Constitution in 1790. -Amendment XHI abolished slavery; Amendment XIV made all persons bom or naturalized in the United States citizens of the United States and of the state where they reside and extended due process of law and equal protection under the law to all; Amendment XV provided that the right to vote “shall not be denied or abridged ... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” 19 Australia’s Bicentennial Year BY K. S. INGLIS 8 will be celebrated as Australia’s bicenten- nial year. The United States bicentennial celebration of 1976 was fresh in memory when the planning began, and Australians, as usual these days, looked across the Pacific to learn how such things are done. There were Umits to what they could learn, not only because the disasters of Watergate and Vietnam still hung in the American air in 1976, darkening festivity, but because the events commemorated in the two countries were so different. Bicentennial of What? Every American knew that the 1976 bicentennial was about the Declaration of Indepen- dence on July 4, 1776. All ceremonial oratory could begin with the words, noble and famQiar, of the document itself. But the Americans’ revolution had made it virtually certain that no white British colonists elsewhere in the world would have to win independence by force of arms. In Australia the imperial power yielded to, sometimes even encouraged, expressions of national consciousness, giving colonial subjects no powerful cause for either complaint or celebration. Each colony was granted a large measure of self-government in the later 19th century; an act of the imperial Parliament federated the colonies into states of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1900; the Statute of Westminster gave formal recognition in 1931 to the uncontested fact that Australia and the other dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and Ireland) were autonomous members of the British Com- monwealth of Nations.
