1 Introduction: Empowerment and Disempowerment REKHA DATTA & JUDITH KORNBERG

Since the 1970s, researchers and policymakers have examined the impact of development on women in developing countries. Ester Boserup’s pathbreaking 1970 study inspired academics and practitioners to address the problems of gender discrimination that exist in the development process.1 With such impetus, many studies have demonstrated the extent of gender discrimination in development. These efforts have resulted in policy changes at local, national, and international levels to ensure more gender equity. Women’s organizations are empowering women in developing countries to play a more active role in the development process. Women are adopting strategies to confront discrimination and deprivation in the workplace, community, and society.2 Consequently, the question of how development policies affect women’s control of resources and decisionmaking capacity has initiated great interest in empowerment studies.

EMPOWERMENT AND DISEMPOWERMENT

Empowerment is a widely used but complex and contentious concept. Since the 1970s, the feminist literature and the gender and development (GAD) discourse have shed considerable light on the concept of empowerment. The dialogue has addressed several important questions. What constitutes empowerment? Who empowers whom? What are the goals and strategies of empowerment as well as the process of disempowerment? To be sure, the notion of empowerment is multifaceted, a process eluding simple definition. Perhaps a helpful way of organizing the literature would be to examine empowerment as a process and as an outcome. Even 1

though conceptually separable, there is a great deal of overlap between these two aspects of empowerment. As a process, empowerment addresses the policies and strategies of decades of development in the third world that affected women. It provides a framework for feminist scholars, activists, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to understand social relationships (gender equality) and the impact of social and economic processes. Such processes include, for example, colonialism and development policy, as they shaped and transformed women’s position in national and international contexts.3 In the 1970s and 1980s, third world feminists used the concept of empowerment to address the issue of the gender differences that exist in the control and distribution of resources. Embedded in the notion was the idea of power, in a relational context (i.e., “power over [whom]” and “power to [influence whom/what]”). Nancy Hartsock distinguished between “power over,” meaning control, and “power to,” meaning the ability to influence change. She considered the latter notion more useful.4 The reference is to strategies of change that women can bring about. Following that trend, subsequent studies manifest the importance of the phenomenon of “power to”—that is, power to bring about change in situations of inequity and discrimination in which women find themselves. Essentially, the reference is to the strategies that women use to increase their control of resources and generate decisionmaking capacity. Gita Sen and Caren Grown argue that women’s organizations are central to these strategies. Thus, women must not only “strengthen their organizational capacity [but also] crystallize visions and perspectives that will move them beyond their present situation.”5 The 1990s witnessed the use of the concept in a more inclusive sense. The focus on power to, which began in the 1970s, was included with the notion of power over, thus expanding the meaning of empowerment. For example, Srilatha Batliwala defines “power” as “control over material assets, intellectual resources, and ideology” and “empowerment” as “the process of challenging existing power relations, and of gaining greater control over the sources of power.”6 Thus, the current effort is toward reconciling the issue of empowerment as a process and as an outcome of that process: Empowerment is manifested as a redistribution of power, whether between nations, classes, castes, races, genders, or individuals. The goals of women’s empowerment are to challenge patriarchal ideology (male domination and women’s subordination); to transform the structures and institutions that reinforce and perpetuate gender discrimination and social inequality (the family, caste, class, religion, educational processes and institutions, the media, health practices and systems, laws and civil codes,

INTRODUCTION

political processes, development models, and government institutions); and to enable poor women to gain access to, and control of, both material and informational resources.7

These components outline the inclusive elements of empowerment. In general, these elements work in a complex continuum, resulting in changes that ensure more power to women. The process can also produce an erosion of power, resulting in disempowerment.

DISEMPOWERMENT

Empowerment studies often address a central question: As a result of empowerment, have women achieved more power compared to men and compared to women in previous decades? Alternatively stated, Are women empowered or disempowered as a result of organizational, structural, and policy changes? The GAD literature has demonstrated many cases where women have actually lost power as a result of development initiatives. Institutions have manifested male biases, and capitalist development strategies have eroded women’s power compared to men’s.8 Many of these studies demonstrate that women have lost a lot of ground compared to men, especially in economic development. Examples of disempowerment would thus include women’s increased dependence, reduced access to resources and decisionmaking, worsening quality of life, and compliance with policies and practices that circumscribe women’s rights. A related issue is whether women’s empowerment led to men’s disempowerment. One researcher argues that “women’s empowerment does mean the loss of the privileged position that patriarchy allotted to men,” yet “women’s empowerment also liberates and empowers men.” When men recognize women as equal partners, there is a qualitative change in gender relations; renewed energy and skills are brought to social and political movements and institutions.9 Thus, it no longer remains a zero-sum game in which women’s gains become men’s losses. Furthermore, it is important to note that even though the process of empowerment will hypothetically lead to outcomes, it is not a simple, unidimensional path. There is no “straightforward cause and effect relationship between process and outcomes. Nor is it always clear when a change is cause and when effect, when process, and when outcome.”10 Thus, when evaluating the empowerment outcome of any particular process (individual skill enhancement, community organization enterprise, policy impact), one has to consider the complex nature of the empowerment process and the effect it may have directly or indirectly in enhancing power. In a recent study of credit programs for rural women in Bangladesh, Naila Kabeer finds that

114

REKHA DATTA & JUDITH KORNBERG a growth of women’s self-confidence, in their knowledge of their rights, their willingness to participate in public action and even the reduction of domestic violence may have occurred as a result of women’s participation in the new forms of social relationships embodied in credit organizations; they bore little relationship to the productivity of their loans.11

Evaluating the impact of empowerment also raises the question of which women are being empowered, whether the empowerment of some women means the disempowerment of other women, and how the struggle for women’s empowerment interfaces with struggles around racial, class, religious, and ethnic oppressions. Sen and Grown argue that it is the vantage point of poor and oppressed women that should be taken into consideration. They recognize that empowerment must address the multiple layers of the subordination of poor women: “We want a world where inequality based on class, gender, and race is absent from every country; and from the relationships among countries.”12 The extent to which the empowerment of poor women leads to resistance by women privileged in terms of class, race, and nationality in specific contexts is an empirical one that requires further research.

THE CASE FOR A MULTILEVEL APPROACH

Critics have pointed out that the concept of empowerment is rooted in the Western culture of individualism and personal achievement.13 Despite its Western origins, however, as we have already discussed, empowerment is now a widely used term in the field of GAD.14 Empirical analyses using an empowerment perspective, though, are at the very beginning stage. Some studies have characterized empowerment as a multilevel process involving the individual, organizational, and policy levels. At the individual level, the process involves raising consciousness and developing skills; at the organizational level, women learn collaborative skills to work in collectivities; and at the policy level, women partake in drafting, enacting, and enforcing legislation that seeks to redress gender discrimination.15 In addition to the different levels of empowerment, the 1990s trend was also toward a synthesis of power over resources and power to make decisions. This definition of empowerment is captured effectively in the definition of empowerment used in the United Nations (UN) system. It includes the following components: women’s sense of self-worth; their right to have and to determine choices; their right to have the power to control their own lives, both within and outside the home; and their ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order, nationally and internationally.16 How do these efforts translate to empowerment

as it is occurring in different developing contexts? This book seeks to contribute to that perspective by demonstrating the multifaceted aspects of empowerment at all these levels. In addition, it presents case studies from various regions of the world in order to manifest the different meanings that empowerment can take when examined from the perspective of the needs of women in particular situations (development, social change, war). Hence, our perspective of empowerment is that it occurs when individual and group efforts correspond with those of agencies. Policies and programs that states and international organizations undertake to alleviate the adversities that women face every day are well within the purview of empowerment. They do this by enabling women to have more power over resources and decisionmaking. These policies include legislation addressing economic reforms, domestic violence, cultural constraints such as divorce legislation, inheritance issues, and the like. Eventually, this sense of empowerment addresses the issue of “power relations” (i.e., how are women able to address and redress power inequities in gender relations?). Therefore, agencies—along with international laws and policies addressing issues of discrimination—go a long way in empowering women. Grassroots movements and women’s organizations also play an important part in the process. Women become conscious of their power relations and decisionmaking ability by actively participating in the process of development. Thus, empowerment constitutes women’s feeling of empowerment as achieved through activism and grassroots movements.17 Using this empirical, multidimensional perspective to understand empowerment, we maintain that empowerment occurs most definitely when women mobilize themselves and take leadership positions in work settings and in the community. Indigenous groups, NGOs, and international intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations have been at the forefront of evaluating the status of women and making recommendations to governments about the need to alleviate discrimination at all levels. This has empowered women and has had an impact on policymakers at each of these levels as well. At the macro level, Chapters 2 and 3 discuss how international organizations are addressing the problem of women’s rights and inequality. In Chapter 2, Charlotte Patton takes note that the United Nations has been godmother to the global women’s movement through four UN world conferences on women (1975–1995), as well as the follow-up Beijing +5 (June 2000). The subject of her chapter is that women have taken greater prominence as activists, policymakers, and critics and, further, have promoted a reconceptualization of population policy. Do cultural and systematic violations of basic rights of women constitute a violation of human rights? Can there be international law addressing issues of female mutilation, sex trade, prostitution, and so on? In an effort

116

REKHA DATTA & JUDITH KORNBERG

to address these issues, are international agencies and conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women able to empower women against violence and discrimination? That is the focus of Chapter 3 by Kathleen Suneja. Chapters 4 and 5 examine national government policies in two very significant countries in the world: China and India, the world’s two most populous countries. They also share the distinction of having a negative femaleto-male ratio. Despite pledges to the contrary, national government policies in both these countries have not resulted in women’s empowerment in economic and social well-being (i.e., education, health, and economic activity). An essential element of empowerment is self-empowerment and grassroots activism. National policies and ideologies often declare their commitment to equality for women and men. In reality, how much of this is practiced, and does it lead to empowerment of women? Kellee Tsai examines whether the post-1949 communist ideological commitment to gender equality has resulted in transforming gender relations within patriarchal institutions and family structures in China. India, in contrast, is a parliamentary democracy. The constitution of India makes express commitment not only to equality but also to providing special opportunities for the advancement of women. Rekha Datta examines whether that commitment, after five decades of Indian independence, has translated into the empowerment of women. Chapters 6 and 7 examine the complexities of West African and Latin American countries, looking at structural adjustment policies and microenterprise projects that have in fact reversed the socioeconomic status of women. Likewise some governments have implemented structural adjustment policies (SAPs) to generate greater economic development. Based on field research, the case study on Niger and Senegal (Chapter 6 by Lucy Creevey) explores the outcomes of economic and political effects that women have encountered as a result of government downsizing, reductions in government spending, and SAPs adopted by these governments in the 1980s and the 1990s. In this study, Creevey raises a very important question: Have these policies resulted in the empowerment or disempowerment of women? Her conclusion is that SAPs cannot be blamed for all the hardships poor women now face in both countries. Poor women were already being forced into work in the informal sector, or “proletarianized,” to fulfill their family obligations. SAPs worsened the situation initially, reduced their already scarce incomes, and thus disempowered them. But there are signs that at the upper economic level women are beginning to profit from improved terms of trade, and some of this benefit is trickling down through the traditional informal female financial network. In Chapter 7, Kiki Anastasakos examines whether SAPs in Mexico and Costa Rica have produced comparable results, leading to empowerment/disempowerment. Interestingly enough, even though women in both countries felt the severe impact of

INTRODUCTION

711

SAPs, Costa Rican women were relatively less disempowered compared to Mexican women. These studies make the case for more concerted efforts by governments to evaluate the effects, especially on women, of SAPs and policy changes before they launch what are generally advocated and accepted as models of development elsewhere. Chapters 8 and 9 focus on areas of the world that are just beginning to receive attention from researchers, namely, the Caribbean and Palestine. Women in these regions are initiating waves of social consciousness and protest to improve their socioeconomic status and overall empowerment and leadership in the community. A basic thrust of empowerment is selfempowerment. Caribbean women’s groups have taken upon themselves to promote a more people-centered development model. In Chapter 8, Marian Miller examines their successes and challenges of these women’s groups as they are “making waves.” In war-torn countries, women have a special role to play. Saliba Sarsar’s analysis of Palestinian women on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (Chapter 9) reflects the multidimensional nature of empowerment. Here, women are caught in the conundrum of conflict, nationalism, activism, state-building, and peace. They have begun to formulate their demands and rights through movements and organizations. The collection of essays in this volume thus approach the multilevel and complex nature of empowerment by looking at the international, national, and subnational levels and the various strategies of empowerment used at these levels. They highlight the different implications of empowerment for women in unique contexts of development and social change. International organizations take a broader perspective to address systematic gender violence issues. Although they may or may not generate economic development, these laws and policies enable women to have greater selfconfidence and freedom from violence and oppression and also empower women to take leadership in other spheres of their life. Thus, the volume does not seek to offer a definition or meaning of empowerment that will be effective and applicable globally. The case studies provide an opportunity to recognize the differences in empowerment experiences in different regions of the world and the levels at which they occur. They recognize the effect of scholarship as well as policies, laws, regulations, and movements that affect the status of women. “To succeed, women must become active both at the level of discovering strategies and implementing them at the level of national politics. They must continue to fight to maintain the language of equality and translate it into practicable measures.”18 We hope to reinforce the emerging notions of assessing empowerment is all its richness, variety, and complexity. The meaning of empowerment for this book is therefore broad, inclusive, and flexible. In order to understand

118

REKHA DATTA & JUDITH KORNBERG

empowerment we must recognize the unique experiences of women in developing countries. Likewise, the strategies and policies that bring empowerment will vary in different contexts. The vicissitudes of the development process are already established. Studies such as these underscore the complex and varying degrees and nature of empowerment.

2 Women and the United Nations: Norms, Reproductive Health and Rights, and Population Policy CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON

Women and population issues now command attention on the global agenda. Although there has been an intergovernmental commission focusing on the status of women since 1947, the salience and high visibility of gender issues emerged only with a decade for women sponsored by the United Nations (UN).1 The end of the Cold War has allowed focus on pressing global issues through major conferences, including the environment, human rights, social development, population (International Conference on Population and Development, 1994), and women (Fourth World Conference on Women, 1995), followed by the Habitat Conference (1996). The attention given to women’s issues varied from conference to conference. Nevertheless, the expanding role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and more integrated thinking and experience among a growing set of players has resulted in normative development and expansion in women’s issues. How the United Nations proceeds to clarify and define the rules, to incorporate the latest norms into programming, and to institutionalize these global commitments therefore calls for increased attention. In this chapter I begin with a brief overview of the United Nations as well as some norms and rules on women as they were articulated in UN conferences of the 1990s. I also consider how the United Nations has contributed to the empowerment of women. Finally, I analyze and critique the roles and activities of several specific UN units in the context of empowering women.2

CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON INTRODUCTION

The United Nations has a long history of involvement with women and women’s issues.3 Article 8 of the UN Charter forbids any restrictions on the eligibility and participation of women and men in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. Established in 1947, the intergovernmental Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) initiated major normative policy on behalf of equality for women, including declarations and treaties (on nationality, marriage, and political rights), as well as the very important 1981 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. These CSW declarations and treaties contributed to the expansion of the women’s movement and its search for equality between men and women. During the UN Decade for Women (1976–1985), political negotiations among the then competitive international forces forced UN political, institutional, and normative development for women, as well as interaction on issues in which women claimed interests and roles: development and peace.4 The three UN conferences related to the UN Decade for Women— Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen (1980), and Nairobi (1985)—not only interlinked these issues as necessary conditions for the improvement of women’s status and lives, but the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies (FLS) culminated in strategies to carry out those interrelated norms. The UN role to carry out these strategies has remained modest, with minimum funds, although the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), with an annual budget of about $13 million in 1993, was one outcome of the Decade for Women. Hopeful signs of progress included patterns of interaction at the global level, such as contacts made by women across national, ethnic, and class barriers at the Nairobi NGO Forum. Furthermore, national governments established national machineries for implementation of the FLS. According to a Nairobi conference document, women had made progress toward equality during the Decade for Women in many areas (e.g., legal equality, participation in the labor force, and government expansion of basic health services).5 But along with progress came unfulfilled expectations, programs that were not extended, and machinery that was not utilized to deal with women’s issues. Also, new issues arose, for example, abuses against women and children. Women continue to be paid less than men for work of equal value, and too few programs have been implemented to eliminate discrimination against women. Women have remained undereducated, underpaid, and overworked in comparison to men. Women themselves have neglected their own health. Obstacles to overcome if women are to advance in equality include attitudes that legitimate women’s position of inferiority; the praise of childbearing and childrearing responsibilities without role accommodation; the lack of data and knowledge about existing contributions

of women and their potential for other contributions; and, always, lack of resources. Women face real problems, including lower literacy levels and discrimination.6 Women’s roles in the political process are not exempt. In the answers to the extensive questions in the UN questionnaire on women’s political participation, governments for the most part failed to include solid data, for example, on gender-specific voting statistics.7 The Secretary-General’s report presented selected percentages of women legislative representatives and deputies for selected countries, but not total composite figures for all countries. Thus, some feminists have asserted that conditions for many women worsened during the Decade for Women and that not enough was being done to counter the effects of structural adjustment, worldwide expenditures on the military, and the consequences of local wars. Women were the faces of poverty and were being forced back into the informal sector. Hence, feminist academics and activists set out to substantiate some of these contentions. Others were added to the list, directing attention to grassroots, poverty-stricken, or head-of-household women. Scholars and activists did research on, organized around, lobbied for attention to, and joined forces with expanded networks and caucuses on a variety of issues: health, credit, education, employment, and violence against women, to name a few. After the end of the Cold War, with the focus now on globalization and the entry of more women into formal politics and NGOs, these issues have become increasingly significant. The question of empowerment of women raises several questions. How is the concept being used in this book? This chapter advances the definition of power as the capacity to influence behavior of others as relative, relational, and situational. When assessing the power of women, while the other components are important, the relational aspect of power seems to be the most important. Power is a social relationship. Increased power of women will be reflected in their increased decisionmaking authority in the family and in community affairs. Power for a woman, then, has been defined not as an end in itself but as an instrumental mechanism for a change in relationships, to herself and to others around her, especially authoritative males, in public and private institutions. Women themselves will exercise more authority. Empowerment also means greater self-reliance on the part of women, that is, challenging a subordinate position in order to change roles and by striving and persisting to gain leadership. Empowerment includes a focus on those who needed help the most as well as on developing a consciousness of new ways and new behaviors to achieve what was desired. Whether an end or a process, presumably the conditions of the lives of more (or even most) women would be better.

114

CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON

New standards for women’s empowerment emerged from the 1990s conferences. The 1985 UN Nairobi Women’s Conference had asserted that all issues are women’s issues. Women are concerned about and have emerged as potential players in many issues on the global agenda, not because they are decisionmakers (in many instances, they are not) but because they have begun to identify how political, social, economic, and cultural forces shape their lives. That particular consciousness has put some of the control of women’s lives into their own hands. In the 1990s, women’s rights were human rights, and reproductive rights were human rights. For example, women’s health mattered because those who gained health care might better responsibly decide the number of children to have free of discrimination, coercion, and violence.8 Some feminist scholars and activists have argued that women should be defined as a group based on a commonality of experiences, whether oppression or discrimination or some other gender construct. Others argue that women are expressly separated by class, education, race, or ethnic identity, sometimes experiencing privilege but more often marginality.9 The world we live in is the world of groups in a planetary global village. What happens to the most marginal of us happens to the most privileged. The affirmation of women as a group declares the possibility of a relational change. Politically, to define oneself as a group provides a foundation for action. Even such a designation can be action itself. Choices to be made by women are sometimes dichotomized in the literature: to reform politics by increasing women’s participation in politics, or to transform politics by working outside conventional political institutions, raising consciousness, and expanding women’s personal and social relations.10 One answer might be that the understanding of the concept of empowerment has moved beyond this to identify a lengthy and multilayered process whereby women struggle with consciousness and policy simultaneously. Thus, a particular interest is seen in the activation of UN Secretariat staff and their efforts to establish programs and projects to carry out the agreed-upon goals of Cairo and Beijing. In this chapter I focus on UN action related to the empowerment of women.

THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE WOMAN ISSUE

Any writing on the United Nations and women acknowledges the United Nations as an international intergovernmental organization established by international treaty (i.e., the UN Charter). The name “United Nations” generally refers to UN Headquarters, comprising the General Assembly

WOMEN &

THE

UNITED NATIONS

151

(GA), the Economic and Social Council, the Security Council, and the Trusteeship Council, four of the five principal UN organs; the fifth is the Secretariat, headed by the Secretary-General, with Secretariat officials supporting the intergovernmental units.11 Over the years, Secretariat functions have changed, new tasks have been added, and technical assistance has expanded beyond advisory missions and training programs to grants (supplies and local salaries) directly to governments. The United Nations, as an international intergovernmental institution, is policy-oriented, sometimes itself serving to influence policies of governments. It can also be a pressure point from which NGOs lobby governments. The main players in the United Nations are government delegates who are generally instructed (although not always) about positions they are to take in the deliberative bodies. Normative rules are articulated in the legislative enactments of these bodies. Some are confirmed in legal treaties, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Governmental control has been inexactly exercised by the power of the purse, a substitute for well-designed policy. Governments active in population policy since roughly 1970 have included the major donors (Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and, depending on domestic politics, the United States). The major recipients of UN population policy funding have been India, China, Pakistan, and other Asian countries practicing family planning, some Latin and African countries, as well as almost all others for censuses and demographic research and evaluation. In the 1990s, reform of the United Nations was a driving political force, publicly demanded by the U.S. government (part of the reassertion of the role of the U.S. Congress, in particular the Senate under Jesse Helms, former chair of the Committee on Foreign Relations, in the making of U.S. foreign policy), and quietly supported by other governments. Even before Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform was introduced to the General Assembly on July 16, 1997, budgetary constraints, NGO complaints about failing adequately to consider issues, and criticisms within intergovernmental bodies had already encouraged some UN units to cooperate more fully on women’s issues.12 In both women’s and population issues, NGOs have been significant players. The women’s movement, discussed below, and the so-called population club (variously, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population) have worked with various UN units, encouraged new endeavors, and have received monies for programming from the United Nations Population Fund (known by the acronym UNFPA). Some NGOs have even become enmeshed with the United Nations and shared an insider’s role at the United Nations.

In this chapter I take note of Secretariat units located at UN Headquarters in New York, in particular the Division for the Advancement of Women (under the CSW), the expert committee reviewing CEDAW, and the UNFPA, a funding agency substantively supporting and promoting family planning to lower the birthrate in third world countries and, since Cairo, reproductive health.

FROM THE NORMATIVE TO EMPOWERMENT: THE UNITED NATIONS, GENDER POLITICS, AND HEALTH

By 1995, the United Nations could present a more optimistic picture of the world’s women—at least in a general way.13 Summarizing and analyzing on a regional basis, the United Nations reported many improvements despite continuing divergence in conditions between women and men. For example, literacy in Latin America was at 75 percent across the region, with more girls than boys in school at the secondary and tertiary levels. In subSaharan Africa, only minimal progress has been made, with literacy rates among the lowest in the world, only 43 percent for women and 67 percent for adult men. In northern Africa and western Asia, increased enrollment of girls has raised female literacy to 44 percent. In southern Asia, two-thirds of women are illiterate, with primary and secondary enrollment of girls below that of all other regions except sub-Saharan Africa. In East Asia, literacy is not yet as universal for women as for men.14 Translating the basic advantages that women have earned into advancement has been slow. Women’s participation in management and administration (including middle levels) rose in all regions but one. In Western Europe, the rise was from 16 to 33 percent, whereas in Latin America it rose from 18 to 25 percent. Women’s participation at the top levels of government remained exceptional. At the time of Beijing +5 (June 2000), only Norway had as many as one-third women ministers or subministers. With respect to health, women continued to live longer than men. Life expectancy for women made the greatest gains in northern Africa, eastern, southern, and western Asia, and Central America (by ten to eleven years). The mortality rates for men and women also reflected different biological and socioeconomic factors. In the developing world, women’s major health risks were related to pregnancy. In the developed world, after age sixtyfive, heart disease has overtaken cancer as the first cause of women’s death. In developing countries, maternal mortality has remained a leading cause of death for women of reproductive ages (nineteen to forty-four). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 500,000 women die each year in childbirth.15 Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, followed by southern Asia. Maternal mortality has been especially

high where maternity care has been low.16 According to the UN report, where childbirth is a woman’s event, pregnancy commanded neither extra expenses nor emergency transport for a woman in crisis during labor. Health had not been a major topic at the United Nations but had been dealt with primarily by the WHO. But prior to the 1990s, two major initiatives by the WHO (in conjunction with others) had begun to link health issues with development. The Alma Alta Conference (1978) and its Declaration on the Right to [Good] Health for All and the Safe Motherhood Initiative (1987) emphasized improvement in the health and wellbeing of mothers, part of the maternal and child-health (MCH) operational programming formula in the United Nations Children’s Fund and the WHO.17 Health had become salient because health-related conditions and initiatives impinged on population policy. Driven only by demographic imperatives, a program began in the 1960s to distribute contraceptives in order to lower the birthrates among women of third world countries. Since the Bucharest UN World Population Conference (1974), directives and linkages to development had placed population and family-planning services within MCH, within primary health care programs, or within community development programs. Hence, when later changes in population/family-planning programming led to a focus on the quality of services and the need for better access by those being served, such issues as high maternal mortality rates and contraceptive acceptability had become factors critical to the delivery and distribution of contraceptives. And in the 1980s, critics of a demographically driven population policy asserted a development framework to take account of women’s reproductive health. This led Dr. Nafis Sadik, the second executive director of UNFPA, to become aware of her women’s constituency, particularly after the 1985 Nairobi Conference. By the time of the preparations for the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994, women’s groups worldwide and at the United Nations had been organizing to lobby and make an impact on the conference agenda, particularly the final document. As an example, the Women’s Environment and Development Organization, organized by Bella Abzug in New York and with members worldwide, as well as the International Women’s Coalition, which served as the Secretariat, convened the January 1994 Conference on Reproductive Health and Justice, International Women’s Health Conference for Cairo in 1994.18 Since the UN Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (1992) had been opened up on an ad hoc basis to nonconsultative-status NGOs, national and local groups, research institutes, and smaller groups of activists had access to the preparations for the conferences themselves.

Cairo and the Politics of Reproductive Health and Reproductive Rights The Cairo Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (1994) reflected efforts at compromise on two significant conflicts: (1) a continued focus on demographic outcomes, or an increased focus on improving women’s reproductive health; and (2) an extension of reproductive rights, including how abortion would be characterized.19 At the third preparatory meeting for the conference, the Vatican delegation had asked that any such language be in brackets so that it could later be negotiated at the full conference. The United States and others staved off demands by some Latin American and Middle Eastern delegations actively supported by the Vatican’s delegation for extensive restrictions. The document (paragraph 7.2) therefore acknowledges the right of men and women to all methods of fertility regulation not against the law. Using language drawn from the International Conference on Population (held in Mexico City, August 6–14, 1984), a compromise was reached. Abortion was not to be promoted as a method of family planning, but it was acknowledged that population growth was indeed a serious public health problem to be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services (paragraph 8.25). The Programme of Action was the most important outcome of the conference. Its preamble, as well as chapters on population growth and structure (Chapter 6); on health, mortality, and morbidity (Chapter 8); on population distribution (Chapter 9); and on international migration (Chapter 10) reflected the demographic focus of the Programme of Action. In contrast, the earlier Mexico City Population Conference had produced the Recommendations for the Further Implementation of the World Population Plan of Action — strictly a demographic-oriented document. The largest section, on population goals and policies, was itself the result of more than twenty years of policy efforts to affect birthrates directly. Reproduction and the family (the locus of statements on family planning), as well as migration (international and internal) and population structure were discussed in 1984. The role and status of women gained a separate heading in the 1984 document (especially influential for 1994), having been shifted out of the section on reproduction and the family by an ad hoc coalition of knowledgeable NGOs, government delegates, and UN Secretariat staff.20 The 1994 ICPD’s Programme of Action was longer, more focused on health and health-related issues than the 1984 Recommendations, and contained chapters on gender equality, equity, and the empowerment of women, reproductive rights and reproductive health, and health, morbidity, and mortality. What pervaded the Cairo conference document was an enlarged acknowledgment of individual options and choices. A wider assertion of

WOMEN &

THE

UNITED NATIONS

191

human rights was emphasized: for example, user-centered services, helping couples, improving the quality of care, and the principle of informed free choice as an essential to long-term success of family planning. The Cairo document expanded its domain to all potential clients and, by implication, to everyone. The new focus on better services and the improvement of people’s lives, as well as on responsiveness to the needs of individuals, many of whom are women, should be called a new development strategy. The new concept of reproductive health (and rights) had to be integrated with demographic goals as well as women’s health concerns. The prominence given to women in the Cairo document linked it to Beijing, which relied on the Cairo document for wordings on abortion as well as other issues. Linkages would be made in the later efforts by the UNFPA and the Division for the Advancement of Women to integrate reproductive health rights and the empowerment of women into existing population programs. Cooperation among UN units was to be a leitmotif in the last half of the 1990s. ICPD, the Fourth World Conference on Women, and Empowerment The Cairo document remained in part a demographic document, even without targets recommended to governments wishing to reduce fertility. It emphasized population growth, the movements of people, new attitudes toward family planning, reproductive health and rights, and demographically focused features of the increased empowerment of women such as combining mothering with workforce participation. These are the 1990s versions of population issues related to the empowerment of women. The demographic context of Cairo’s Programme of Action seemed especially pervasive in contrast to the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women (FWCW) in Beijing.21 Both conference documents addressed the issue of poverty. The Cairo document considered population, economic growth, and sustainable development; women and poverty; and strategic objectives. The ICPD document placed poverty in a broad framework of challenge to development, where poverty was accompanied by unemployment, malnutrition, illiteracy, low status of women, and other features. Slower population growth, according to the ICPD Programme of Action, could buy time for adjustment to continuing population growth (paragraph 3.14), a way of attacking poverty that did not focus exclusively on women. However, Cairo clearly said that human resources needed to be developed in regard to women. The conditions of women were important beyond their demographic impact; every problem has more than a demographic basis.

120

CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON

The women’s document acknowledged that demographic changes do help explain the conditions women faced. For example, paragraph 30 (Global Framework) in the FWCW Platform for Action noted an additional 86 million people each year. The demographic trends of more young people and increased numbers of older people were changing the dependency ratio in families, to the detriment of women, because they remained the caregivers in conditions of poverty and unremunerated work. In another example, the FWCW Platform for Action asserted that the majority of the 1 billion poor living in poverty were women (paragraph 47) but then cataloged a number of broad social, economic, political, and cultural factors in which specific gender discrimination contributed to this condition. What would push for changes in social practices? Would it be larger numbers of people, or would they contribute to demographic inertia, that is, people overwhelmed by poverty and unable to change their lives for the better? In fact, it was not stated, either in Cairo’s Programme or in Beijing’s Platform, how a specific demographic contribution to the impoverishment of some women might occur. And along with the removal of demographic factors, what other critical factors needed to be remedied to empower women? Population growth, in the global sense, catches the imagination, as it presents serious economic, social, cultural, and gender issues in the impoverishment of women. At the micro level, the complexity of factors has made population growth a sufficient but not the single necessary factor in the improvement of women’s lives. Sorting out priorities bedevils population programming. Both documents were political documents, drafted to the needs of a wide spectrum of influential political actors. The documents did not include careful directives from which defined actions necessarily would follow. In some sense, the documents served as justifications of existing sectoral and organizational structures. Nevertheless, cooperation and even collaboration would be important to expanded programming within the UN Secretariat. UNFPA much earlier had expanded its domain into women’s issues, but not necessarily in ways known or of interest to the global women’s movement. Population policy, reproductive health, and reproductive rights would now be issues new to the Division for the Advancement of Women. Engagement and Implementation: Beyond Cairo and Beijing Cairo and Beijing focused on the empowerment of women. At least some women would no longer be passive subjects of policy; they had become active participants in their own future. Women had even become decisionmakers in projects. These conferences themselves redefined empowerment to be a feature of political action by all women, which came about through

and could contribute to transnational coalition-building. We see here that empowerment is a process and an outcome. Conferences are happenings. They can be pressure points for innovation or legitimization of reorganization that is already under way. Both the Cairo and Beijing women’s reproductive health and rights paragraphs could supply the basis for decisions by their respective UN intergovernmental bodies to put in place the next steps in implementation. On the recommendation of the UNFPA, its governing council approved UNFPA’s approach to reproductive health, including family planning. The Commission on Population and Development called for reports on reproductive health, and the Commission on the Status of Women also adopted resolutions designating 1999 as the year for specia1 focus on health. And CEDAW set out to adopt another general recommendation on health, including reproductive health and rights, to be available to the UN Human Rights Committees. Various NGOs continued their roles as lobbyists, advocates, researchers, and critical observers. UNFPA (a funding unit turned substantive advocate) and the Division for the Advancement of Women (a Secretariat think-tank and UN bureaucratic counterpart of the intergovernmental CSW) began cooperation thematically on women and programmatic exploration and increased coordination. Some elements of coordination already existed. In place under the Administrative Committee on Coordination was an ad hoc subgroup on women established in the mid-1970s during the UN Decade for Women. UNFPA had a small suboffice on women, and in 1997 its annual publication State of World Population highlighted the fact that fertility decline may contribute to the improvement of women’s status. Increased cooperation on programs for women emerged as a legitimized systemwide function in the first meeting of the Interagency Committee on Women and Gender Equality (October 1996) at UN Headquarters in New York City. Under the rubric of gender equality, issues of women’s rights, including women’s participation in decisionmaking and systemwide inclusion in programming, were to be given more salience. Very specifically, the meeting’s agenda focused on mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the UN system. UNFPA was to support UNIFEM in its link with the Task Force on Basic Social Services for All. And UNFPA, as the Chair of the Women in Development Subgroup of the Joint Consultative Group on Policy, and the coordinator of the next meeting’s three papers—on indicators; parameters for evaluating best practices; and policy enforcement and accountability—was to link efforts with the Division for the Advancement of Women.22 UNFPA’s approach had begun with its programming as it existed before ICPD. It sought to incorporate this new approach of reproductive health and rights, including sexual health, into its programming. Expert meetings can serve to rationalize what a bureaucracy plans to do while also

122

seeking broader public collaboration. Earlier recommendations to its executive board in 1995 and 1996 had laid the foundations of UNFPA’s approach.23 The approach was first based on its existing programs and projects, which were to be changed incrementally as additional funds became available or as earlier projects finished. Acknowledging other UN units’ role in the implementation of the ICPD’s Programme of Action, UNFPA proposed a mission statement to serve as a framework for its activities over the coming twenty years.24 The ICPD’s new paradigm of population and development, according to UNFPA,25 meshed the macro-level development/demographic goals with a recognition that their accomplishment depended on the attainment of individual goals and the inclusion of all groups in the efforts toward sustainable development. The three core areas selected by UNFPA within its new program framework were the following: reproductive health and family planning; population policy; and advocacy. Along with a commitment to universally accepted human rights, especially reproductive rights, and the monitoring of the implementation of the Programme of Action at all levels, UNFPA underlined its operational goals: to help countries attain the three quantitative goals specified in the ICPD Programme of Action—providing universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family planning methods and to related reproductive health services; reducing infant, child, and maternal mortality; and providing universal access to primary education.26 In reproductive health, UNFPA had already established service delivery points for family planning at all levels and, in some instances, also providing treatment for reproductive tract infections. Post-ICPD planning included the expansion at the primary level of other components of reproductive health,27 including Safe Motherhood as part of its core.28 New criteria for the allocation of UNFPA resources based on a quantification in the three numerical goals set for 2015 focused especially on Africa and the least developed countries. Assistance to countries beyond the new thresholds of the selected seven numerical indicators in favor of SouthSouth cooperation was gradually limited.29 Numerical indicators for access to reproductive health services were to be based on deliveries by trained health personnel, contraceptive prevalence rate, and access to basic health services. The targeted areas for other indicators included mortality reduction and universal primary education for young girls and adult females, with appropriate thresholds. On the basis of these indicators, UNFPA established new categories for countries’ eligibility for UNFPA assistance.30 UNFPA had begun to address itself to women’s reproductive health assistance, including but not limited to family planning services it provided (or might provide) directly to countries, or in collaboration with other UN agencies, or in some instances with NGOs. Along with other UN units,

UNFPA was responding to directives for gender mainstreaming at the United Nations. A recent study presented at one of the many meetings held in conjunction with the special session of the General Assembly (Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development, and Peace for the 21st Century; the so-called Beijing +5 conference of June 2000) has suggested a diffuse quality to gender mainstreaming and to the inclusion of reproductive health and rights into UNFPA programming: guidelines existed but have not been fully incorporated into programming and budgeting. Specifically focused on the UN system and budgeting for gender equality, the reports noted two positive factors: strategic planning is being led by UN system budget offices, and the concept of mainstreaming gender had become more fully understood, moving beyond staffing to analysis of gender impacts. This combination suggested positive learning processes.31 After Cairo and Beijing, CEDAW proceeded to draft a new recommendation on women’s health. Almost all the preceding twenty-three General Recommendations (the last one in 1997) had been short, one to two pages, designed to direct state parties on reporting, legislation, or further elaboration on particular issues, for example, violence against women. By contrast, two recommendations, General Recommendation No. 19, Violence Against Women (eleventh session, 1992) and General Recommendation No. 21, Equality in Marriage and Family Relations (thirteenth session, 1994, the GA-designated Year of the Family) contained extensive recommendations. Indeed, the General Recommendation on Equality and Family Relations urged close attention to issues of women’s nationality (not to be lost by marriage or change in nationality by father or husband); equality before the law (the right to bring litigation, to enter into contract, and to choose her domicile); and, at length, elimination of discrimination in marriage and family relations (polygamous marriages, equal shares in inheritance between women and men, and other items). CEDAW and General Recommendation on Rights Related to Health and Well-Being A pending draft General Recommendation—post-Cairo and post-Beijing— on rights relating to women’s health and well-being has a lengthy format.32 The initial draft asserted the right to a standard of living adequate for health (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which refers only to “him”). It also refers to WHO’s constitution, which states that health is a state of complete, physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Although Vienna, Cairo, and Beijing focused on women’s health, including sexual and reproductive health, the

124

CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON

General Recommendation explores possibilities of discrimination and of the impairment of the enjoyment of various rights and freedoms because of the failure of state parties to fulfill their treaty obligations. The following are highlighted: right to life; security of person; equality before the law; highest standard attainable of physical and mental health; safe conditions of work; privacy and confidentiality; medical information; informed consent in medical decisionmaking; reproductive and sexual health; and the right to benefits in scientific progress. Commentaries focussed on issues related to women’s health under treaty articles such as prenatal sex selection, female infanticide, and son preference. These were called discrimination against the girl child and thus violations of: women’ s rights to health; respect for integrity of women’s bodies; and protection from discrimination in social, domestic, or employment spheres by reason of pregnancy and motherhood.33 Moreover, the focus on research on human reproductive capacity had unintended consequences. It ignored potential dangers to men, did not lead to the improvement of workplace conditions, and led to exclusion of women from places of work or higher-paying jobs. The Recommendations for Government Action cited minimum core obligations: national policy to protect women’s rights to health, health care, and well-being; creation of a system to monitor the status of those rights; and especially the identification of groups of women at risk with respect to discrimination in these rights. Also addressed to governments were collections of data on health status of women disaggregated by age, ethnicity, and race, urban, and rural locations: 1. 2. 3. 4.

Identification of serious health problems faced by women. The adoption of affirmative actions where necessary. Free reproductive and sexual health services to young girls. A review of punitive laws against women who have had illegal abortions, in order to repeal them. 5. Working with communities to assure minimum age of marriage. 6. Monitoring and working with nongovernmental organizations and private groups in their health policies and programs. Reporting guidelines were also expanded. Along with related treaties, CEDAW recommendations have on occasion been used to explore or buttress national legal standards upholding the equality of women.34 Possibly unique to this particular process were the published comments on this draft by a number of interested NGOs.35 Extensive comments were made on each part of the draft, drawing out the consequences of discrimination against women. Various NGO groups wanted a life-cycle approach to women’s health and care; greater emphasis on how women’s health and

related issues were different from those of men and needed recognition and care accordingly; and expansion of specific issues such as HIV/AIDS, violence against women, and poverty.

CONCLUSION

The United Nations has framed the worldwide effort to empower women. Women and their allies worked for normative statements and developments on behalf of women. Increased UN cooperation on population and women’s issues gained legitimacy from the UN conferences of the 1990s. Changes in programming have followed, but because UN units remain essentially separate—calls for reform, greater coordination, and collaboration notwithstanding—expansion has been slow. In view of the UN Secretariat policy approach of mainstreaming gender perspectives—difficult under the best of circumstances—the limited possibilities of increasing cooperation restrict the effectiveness of the United Nations. But, and this is very important, expanded institutionalization and policy expansion on behalf of women have been happening in national arenas. Civil society and NGO overlap/presence in these several arenas is a factor in that institutionalization. The world looks different at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Countries face new and difficult problems: AIDS is increasing in Asian countries, and its devastation is already evident in Africa. These societies are beginning to recognize the critical role of full partnership with women; women realize their need to protect themselves and their children. The government of China has now begun a limited experimentation in a new approach to population policy—removal of permits for births in a given year, new choices for women when to give birth—in order to reduce the hostility among Chinese women to the implementation of Chinese population policy.36 Termed a “client-centered approach,” implementation is being financially assisted by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the UN Population Fund. Women’s educational achievements—one gender factor that research has established can clearly be correlated with lower fertility rates—grow in different ways from region to region. The ICPD’s Programme of Action mentioned the role of men in fertility reduction. What changes improve relationships between men and women, thereby increasing possibilities of fertility control, remain unexplored. The relationship between the global women’s movement and population policy advocates will probably remain distant, if not unfriendly. The ICPD’s Programme of Action is no longer a demographically defined policy. It is now a policy giving prominence to reproductive health and the empowerment of women while downplaying the demographic rationale for

126

CHARLOTTE GRAVES PATTON

population policy.37 Severe resource constraints remain. Now is the time for more collaborative efforts in population policy making and implementation and less focus on coercive rules.38 The UN remains the only global mechanism to record, monitor, and make public what women are doing worldwide. Its imperfections notwithstanding, it sets standards for empowerment of women and establishes the sites of later policy discussion about women. The treaty to eliminate all discrimination against women has 130 signatories, each of whose government makes reports to CEDAW about its compliance with the standards set forth in the treaty. The UN system has advantages not to be cavalierly dismissed or diminished. But the United Nations will need more expertise and more informal contacts at local levels if its programs are to respond to the real differences among women. At the political level, governments need to understand the serious issues in social and cultural policies. Civil society relationships may facilitate greater understanding. Regional exchanges may be useful, although politically difficult. More problem-solving on the status of women, including their reproductive health, poverty, and education, must be the focus of future UN discussions and formal meetings.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. How does public policy empower women? 2. Is empowerment something to be given, something to be taken, or something to be created? 3. Is population policy collaborative or coercive? 4. Is empowerment a process or an outcome? 5. How do you think the United Nations has empowered women?

NOTES 1. During the past twenty years, the United Nations has held four global conferences on women: Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen (1980), Nairobi (1985), and Beijing (1995). These conferences helped to define the obstacles to gender equality and action needed to overcome them. The Mexico City conference, which coincided with the observance of International Women’s Year, “was the start of an international effort to right the wrongs of history,” says the 1985 State of the World’s Women. This led to the proclamation of 1976–1985 as the UN Decade for Women: Equality, Development, and Peace. The Copenhagen conference adopted an action plan for the second half of the decade. The Nairobi women’s conference adopted a fifteen-year program for the advancement of women. About 120 governments have reported progress in meeting the targets set at that conference. In Beijing, at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, representatives of 189 governments adopted a new five-year global action plan, aimed at equality, development, and

WOMEN &

peace. More than 100 governments have made formal commitments to carry out such specific actions as allocating additional funds for education and health, changing laws, and increasing women’s participation in decisionmaking. 2. Although an extremely troublesome issue, the status of women in the Secretariat will not be included because of space. A long history of efforts to improve the conditions of women in the Secretariat challenges the patriarchal UN political culture and the continued operation of the old boys’ network. On the issue of discrimination against women in the Secretariat, the Group on Equal Rights for Women in the United Nations, an open-ended staff group dedicated to the elimination of that discrimination, celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 1997. See the group’s publication, Equal Time (March 8, 1997). On sexual harassment, see the oped in the New York Times (September 15, 1994); and Catherine Claxton vs. the U.N., by Ciceil L.

3 The Empowerment of Women Through International Law KATHLEEN SUNEJA

International law as a body of contemporary law has defined a new framework for women’s rights. Gender-specific laws, as outlined by an international convention on discrimination against women, work in conjunction with domestic legal systems to create new bases to overcome discrimination. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), passed by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1979, addresses in comprehensive form the root causes of all forms of gender discrimination: “Sex is a prohibited ground of discrimination under the international human rights covenants and the regional human rights conventions.”1 Leading scholars have argued that the prohibition of sexual discrimination is now a part of customary international law that binds states even without their express ratification and acceptance.2 CEDAW develops the legal norm on nondiscrimination from a women’s perspective. CEDAW moves from a sex-neutral norm that requires equal treatment of men and women, usually measured by how men are treated, to a recognition of the particular nature of discrimination against women as worthy of a legal response. CEDAW identifies the need to confront the social causes of inequality and discrimination against women. Women have to strive for equality or parity with men and must also seek redress for past discrimination. States are required to show special sensitivity in situations where women are likely to face greater threats to their rights. CEDAW places an affirmative duty upon states to take positive measures to support innovative activities that directly benefit women. Among these measures are steps to end discrimination through gendersensitive awareness-raising, capacity-building, literacy, training, and actionrelated research on women. In addition, states are required not to discriminate 31

by refraining from adopting policies that would infringe upon women’s rights. CEDAW has placed a duty upon signatory states to protect against gender-related violence. The result has been pathbreaking progress for women’s rights under international law. International law has impacted women’s rights in practical terms through the recognition by courts that women may be defined as a “group.” As a group, they qualify for protection as refugees and asylum-seekers under international immigration laws. Additionally, international criminal tribunals have acknowledged crimes perpetrated against women are a means of controlling women’s political participation. The definition of “violence” includes physical violence, mental and health needs, and economic deprivation of women. The physical needs of women include the right to be free from threats of physical harm, including state-sponsored violence and private acts of violence against women. The mental health vulnerabilities are a part of women’s right to have access to adequate resources to meet the physical needs and the emotional necessity to feel safe in her person to make informed decisions about her reproductive rights. The woman has to overcome traditional legal theories under which a woman was the property of a man, just as land. Included in this is the right to privacy and autonomy in regard to reproductive decisions, as they form the basis of the right to remain free from poverty.

WOMEN’S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM VIOLENCE: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW

International law has recognized the specific rights of women with the passage of CEDAW, as well as the Declaration of Violence Against Women. Both documents have increased sensitivity and awareness toward the special needs of women. The greatest benefit to women has come from instilling a greater awareness toward prosecuting crimes against women and the interpretation of international humanitarian law to include sexual violence against women as a crime. The International War Crimes Tribunal, which has heard matters stemming from the violence in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has included crimes against women as war crimes and has successfully prosecuted perpetrators of these crimes who are now serving time in prison. There are four possible charges under which sexual violence may be prosecuted: as a grave breach of the 1949 Geneva Conventions; as a customary war crime; as genocide; and as a crime against humanity.3 Even a single act of rape or sexual assault is a customary war crime and may be prosecuted. Genocide and crimes against humanity require an intent to

331

destroy or to persecute a racial, ethnic, national, or religious group. In this context, the violence against women in the form of rape in the former Yugoslavia has accorded new meaning to the act as a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are considered gross violations against a group; a member of a group has been singled out for the crime solely because the person belongs to that group. The UN Commission of Experts on the Former Yugoslavia found that sexual violence was “widespread” in the conflict and was “part of a policy of terror and violence designed to achieve ethnic cleansing.”4 Most of the sexual violence was systematic and widespread, carried out in connection with efforts to displace the civilian population of a targeted ethnic group in a particular area. Sometimes field military and camp commanders explicitly ordered their subordinates to commit acts of sexual violence. In these cases, the individual commander’s criminal responsibility is unequivocal. In other cases, field and camp commanders failed to prevent sexual violence and did not punish perpetrators when their crimes were exposed. This is a violation of a commander’s duties and makes the commander criminally responsible under international law.5 Often the rape targeted community leaders and professional women, in an attempt to “break” their will. Victims of rape were frequently kidnapped, tortured, and executed on a mass scale. The victims were often held in custody after the rape and were told the women would have children of the perpetrator’s ethnicity, a living reminder to what had happened to them.6 The group rights of women under CEDAW has given them the opportunity to raise the crime of rape to an international crime of genocide. Force used in reproductive behavior made rape victims, if the member of an ethnic group, victims of “ethnic cleansing.” Such crimes were perpetrated by groups of Serbs upon Muslim women held in detention facilities. These are crimes against humanity under current international law. Any deliberate attempts to enforce and encourage sexual assaults and violence by camp commanders were deemed to be part of the “simultaneous military activity . . . to maximize shame and humiliation of not only the victim, but also the victim’s community.”7 This documentation of violence against women is a reminder of the recent increase in the awareness and sensitivity toward women in international humanitarian law. In 1992, the International Committee of the Red Cross had declared that “willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health” under Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention covered rape. The U.S. State Department also concluded that rape could be prosecuted in the manner of a grave breach of customary international law or under the Geneva Conventions.8 Public outrage and media coverage also indicate that women’s rights and their violation thereof have begun to play an increasingly important role in the prosecution of international law. “Responsibility

for gender-based violence resulting from political oppression in peacetime, where a state fails to protect women from violence, or condones or supports subjugation and persecution of women, is even less fully developed than responsibility for the use of violence against women during armed conflict.”9

WOMEN’S REFUGEE STATUS

The principle that women’s rights are human rights dovetails with the development of international legal basis for granting women redress under the law, by prosecuting the offender, but also granting them the additional protection by their status as refugees. The recognition of refugee status for victims of sexual violence allows them to make a claim for “well-founded fear of persecution.” Persecution through sexual violence or gender-related persecution is grounds for granting refugee status under the guidelines of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.10 According to the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, “violence against women” is defined as: any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life.11

Gender-related claims for refugee asylum fall into four categories: • where the method of persecution is gender-related; • where the issue is one of punishment for having transgressed social mores and more generally laws that restrict the exercise of fundamental rights; • measures used in carrying out a law or policy even if it has legitimate goals; and • where the law, policy, or practice may in itself be persecutory.12 Whether a harm or a breach of a woman’s human rights is serious enough to be regarded as persecution is to be determined by whether it is a grave breach or a serious violation of a fundamental human right. Violence includes forms of threats, assaults, interference, and exploitation, including rape, statuary rape, and molestation without physical harm or penetration.13 States have granted asylum in situations where the country of origin of the asylee has failed to protect the asylee due to any variety of reasons, including civil war, political violence, cultural reasons, and government inability to enforce the law. Where government authorities are involved in the

EMPOWERMENT THROUGH INTERNATIONAL LAW

351

persecution, the person is likely to have a greater claim to protection. In the U.S. case of Matter of M-K, a woman from Sierra Leone requested asylum in the United States on grounds of persecution based, in part, on an ongoing cycle of physical and verbal spousal abuse.14 She sought legal protection on three occasions after being severely beaten but was told the police would not interfere, as it was a domestic matter. The abuse continued until she left her husband and fled her home country. Her husband threatened to kill her if she returned to Sierra Leone. Independent evidence produced on the situation of women in that country demonstrated that violence against women, especially wife-beating, is common. Disobedience or disrespect on the part of the wife is considered justification for punitive measures by a husband. The police were found to be unlikely to intervene in domestic disputes except in cases of severe injury or death; few cases of such violence went to court. Thus, the court made a finding of lack of national protection and made a finding of persecution. In defining “persecution,” the judge referred to internationally recognized human rights and instruments, such as the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which specifically condemns battering as a serious violation of human rights. The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) is considered persecution by several international documents. In Re: Khadra Hassan Farah, the Immigration Board of Canada referred to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as a reason to extend protection to a claimant.15 Immigration boards have noted the widespread nature of this “torturous custom” and note that “very little action has been taken by governments in the countries concerned to stop FGM.” Courts have also granted asylum in situations where the applicant’s home country has a serious problem of gender-related violence and where the courts consider the country’s law enforcement and judicial system to be male-dominated. Repeated acts of violence that bring the acts within the meaning of “torture” and the availability of the critical issue of state protection or lack thereof is essential to the refugee claim. The claimant repeatedly sought the protection of the Bulgarian police. Courts will generally find a violation of more than CEDAW and will make reference to the Convention Against Cruel, Inhuman Treatment or Torture. The failure of the domestic justice system to provide protection for violence by private persons is deemed a violation of international humanitarian law. The asylum law in the United States was also transformed to become gender-sensitive with the case of In Re Kasinga. This case was filed by a seventeen-year-old girl named Fauziya Kasinga, who sought asylum in the United States on grounds that she would be persecuted in her native country of Togo by members of her family and tribe by being forced to undergo FGM. In its decision, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Board of Appeals cautiously stated that FGM “under certain circumstances . . . may form the basis for asylum.”16 On June 13, 1996, the board agreed and

136

KATHLEEN SUNEJA

granted Kasinga asylum. In its 11-1 decision, the board stated that Kasinga had established a well-founded fear of persecution and noted that “most African women can expect little governmental protection from FGM.” Kasinga’s plight drew the attention of powerful advocates like U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder and women’s human rights groups like Equality Now, who publicized her case, mobilized support, and arranged for new legal representation. Kasinga had been in detention promptly after she sought asylum in the United States and remained there for sixteen months, enduring repeated strip searches as well as a tear-gassing during a June 1995 incident at the correctional facility where she was being held.17 This infringement was the result of a prison incident, although endured by Kasinga while she was being held in custody with other common prisoners during her incarceration as an illegal alien. She was not treated as a human rights victim prior to her being granted asylum by U.S. immigration authorities. The Kasinga case is an instance in which a government has granted a refugee asylum on grounds that the human rights of the victim were violated on the basis of gender-based violence. The court acknowledged that women were victims of persecution and violence solely because they belong to members of a gender group. Upon proof of the threat of imminent persecution as a cause of their belonging to that group, they qualified for protection under the U.S. Refugee Act, as the court recognized genderbased violence and the need for protection under international norms. The work of CEDAW and women’s initiatives is a reason for granting women recognition as a group and for recognizing gender bias in crimes committed against women under international law.

DO WOMEN HAVE GROUP RIGHTS?

Courts have argued in favor and against considering women as a group. Although recognizing that persecution may not be the sole defining characteristic of the group, courts have determined that may be a part of the definition of what constitutes a “group.” Courts have not spoken in one voice but have considered women as a group in situations where they share a common, immutable characteristic.18 The court in Fatin v. INS recognized that gender was a group and required the claimant to show that she would suffer, or that she has a well-founded fear of suffering, persecution solely based on her gender.19 A scholar in the field of gender-related claims has stated as follows: Gender-based and gender-specific determinations of refugee status are a recent development. Claims of this nature are hampered by current interpretation of the “persecution” element of the [refugee convention] definition,

EMPOWERMENT THROUGH INTERNATIONAL LAW

371

as well as by interpretation of the Convention grounds, which take account of the experience of men more than women. While it appears that there is greater scope in the “particular social group” category than race, religion, nationality or political opinion to accommodate gender-related claims, the drawback of this category is that its interpretation is to a large extent unpredictable. Some decisionmakers have stressed that the shared experience of women who have suffered gender harms, such as violence against them, is insufficient to establish a social group, unless the fact of the earlier violation will make the group targets of future persecution. Women’s claims to be part of a particular social group are also hampered by the fact that the suffering of applicants is frequently indistinguishable from the suffering experienced by the general population of women in the country of origin.20

LIMITATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM

The weakness in international law also limits the protection that this law provides to women. The process whereby the intentions of member states are transformed into practice is to ask the question as to why sovereign states must voluntarily comply with enforcing the law that they created for themselves and signed. Whether states are in compliance with international standards is addressed by the issue of whether states are willing and, more important, able to perform the duties and responsibilities under CEDAW. The challenges associated with meeting the requirements of the regime of women’s rights are manyfold. The international legal system is constrained by the autonomy of states in accepting responsibility for the implementation of international law. Among other weaknesses is the law enforcement in the domestic state system. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties prohibits states from making a reservation that is incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty.21 States have limited their responsibility by way of reservations involving cultural and religious practices to refrain from abiding by essential parts of CEDAW. These states have used the system of reservations as a shield from aspects of CEDAW as adopted by the General Assembly.22 Although more than 120 states have ratified CEDAW, approximately forty states have made some 105 reservations and declarations to CEDAW. The substantive reservations are wide-ranging and affect the integrity of CEDAW. Reservations range from reservations to reflect the exclusively male heritage in the exercise of royal power (Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain); to the exclusion of women from employment in the armed forces or access to combat duties (Germany, New Zealand, Thailand); to restriction of employment of women in night work or at jobs deemed hazardous to their health (Malta, the United Kingdom).

Finally, many Islamic countries reserved certain rights, insisting that equality be subordinate to the teachings of gender-subordinating religious law. Numerous countries wished to maintain restrictions on equality with respect to marriage, family, citizenship, and legal personality of women.23 For example, one reservation reads as follows: “The Government of Bangladesh does not consider as binding upon itself the provisions of Article 2 (and other articles) as they conflict with Shari’a law based on Holy Quran and Sunna. Other states such as Egypt, Iraq and Libya have also made similar broad reservations.”24 These reservations to treaty compliance are challenged by their critics in the UN CEDAW Committee as being possible violations of the Vienna Convention on Treaties. Reservations should not oppose the object and purpose of a treaty according to the Vienna Convention on Treaties. The CEDAW committee requested that the UN system as a whole “promote or undertake stud
