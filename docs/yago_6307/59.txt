The wedding will be featured on the new series of their show

Brady Bunch actor Christopher Knight and model Adrianne Curry are to marry after meeting on a reality TV show.

The couple met on VH1's The Surreal Life in 2004 and their relationship was later chronicled on My Fair Brady, their own programme on the channel.

Knight, 48, was one of the original cast members of The Brady Bunch TV series in the 1960s and 1970s and also appeared in the 1995 movie version.

Curry, 23, shot to prominence as the winner of US TV's Next Top Model.

The wedding will be featured on the next series of My Fair Brady.

In a statement, the couple admitted they had "individual quirks and flaws".

But they added: "We look forward to planning the rest of our lives together and continuing to embrace our differences on our way to the altar."
