        "text": "This week on My Fair Brady, Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight sort out their differences over one problem (Christopher having wanted to have a vasectomy, the topic of last week's episode), just to run head-long into another problem - the Knight family. You see, it's no secret to either Chris or Adrianne that the Knight family doesn't like Adrianne, and doesn't approve of the two age-mismatched lovebirds getting married. There is one huge exception, however. Chris' father, Ed Knight, does give the couple a chance. Adrianne's mother Christine and her grandmother Anne are still visiting Christopher and Adrianne in Los Angeles and are there to receive a crying Adrianne when she runs into the house at the beginning of this week's episode. The situation is quickly diffused, however, when Christopher comes into the house as well. Although things are awkward for a minute, Chris and Anne joke around with one another and lighten the mood. Adrianne's claims to her mother that Christopher \"doesn't want to marry me\" are quickly hushed by laughter filling their house.\n\nUltimately, Ed Knight comes in to save the evening from complete disaster, as he along with his son are going to go out with Adrianne, Christine and Anne for dinner. As they sit at their table in the restaurant, Adrianne notes how much Christopher and his father look alike, but soon things start to unravel. Adrianne brings up Christopher's sister and brother, both of whom don't support Adrianne and Chris' decision to get married. Adrianne quickly gets teary-eyed and goes into her classic dramatic mode. Chris tries to comfort her by telling her that his friends have always been more important than his family, which doesn't only offend his own father but makes everyone else at the table, Adrianne included, extremely uneasy. Suddenly, there's a lot of tension, but Mr. Knight takes it like a gentleman and comments that the evening he spent with them was \"wonderful.\" All of this after Adrianne already acted extremely maturely (for once), calling the Knights, accepting of her or not, her family.\n\nWhen the couple gets home, Chris makes Adrianne extremely happy by telling her that he wants to have children, that he feels subconsciously he wants to reproduce, that it's an urge he cannot ignore. The happiness continues the next day as Chris and Adrianne go tuxedo shopping for the Big Day. Chris, although concerned greatly about the height differential between he and his wife-to-be (she's taller than him and will be even more so with heels on at the wedding), ends up finding a tuxedo that suits him. Adrianne notes that \"Chris just seems to really be stressing over the girly stuff,\" and concludes in testimonial that he needs to get over his \"Napoleon complex.\" After a thought or two on the price of the tuxedo (which came out to be almost as much as Adrianne's dress), the two scamper off to a local bar where the happiness quickly turns back to anger. Chris' family comes back up, especially the issue of his sister, and after suggesting that she write his sister a letter if she wants to talk to her so badly, the two go back home.\n\nAdrianne notes that she feels judged unfairly by Chris' family, for although she was a Playboy model and has done nothing but some reality television, she is proud of what she's done. Understandably, however, Chris eventually snaps at Adrianne for her insistence on talking about his family's issues with their upcoming marriage. What ultimately ends up happening is somewhat funny in that Chris locks himself in his walk-in closet, and then walks back out to get his pillow and blanket and sleeps in the closet. Naturally upset, Adrianne moves off to the couch in their living room, where she cries a bit before getting to sleep. \"I feel betrayed by her,\" Christopher Knight says at the end of the episode. Adrianne also makes a poignant comment, however, about how they will \"never get to the next level of understanding\" in their relationship. And as dramatically as ever, the episode ends with a quick shot of their empty bed.\n\nAlthough going into only its third week of the second season, My Fair Brady is actually getting fairly stale pretty quickly. The show is still more entertaining than a lot of what's on television these days, but the episode this week reflects a mood that transcends this season so far - constant argumentation inevitably leading up to happy times, just like last season. We all know that Adrianne and Chris are going to get married (in fact, in real time, they already have), and I as a viewer wish that they had other things to show us than constant ups and downs. It's becoming too predictable and it makes you wonder if these two lovebirds even love each other at all... or perhaps are in it for entertainment value only. Either way, this week's episode is fun to watch, but light on content and originality. If you're a fan of the season so far, there's no reason to stop watching now. If you're looking for random VH1 entertainment, however, let me steer you in the direction of Supergroup, where the dysfunctionality is much more unusual in its nature."
