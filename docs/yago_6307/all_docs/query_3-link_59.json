        "text": "America’s Next Top Model winner Adrianne Curry and Brady Bunch star Christopher Knight have ended their relationship and are separating after a five-year marriage, both of which began on reality television.\n\nAdrianne wrote on Twitter, “guess you heard about my fucked up life……its ok…we arent fighting…no matter what happens, we will know we put our best in.”\n\nIn a statement, their manager said “the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated. The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. … Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort.”\n\nThe statement, which of course is public and was released to a gossip web site, their manager asks for us to leave them alone: “Both Knight and Curry decided to release this joint announcement today in order to preempt any potential rumors and gossip and ask that their fans and the media respect their privacy during this delicate period.”\n\nThe couple met on The Surreal Life 4 and their relationship was chronicled on three seasons of VH1’s My Fair Brady from 2005 to 2008. Florence Henderson, who appeared on the show and advised them against getting married, offered in 2008 to “counsel their divorce.”"
