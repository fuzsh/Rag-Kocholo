        "text": "Adrianne Curry is the chick who won the first season of America’s Next Top Model. She met Christopher Knight, who played Peter Brady on 70s sitcom staple The Brady Bunch, when they were co-starring on VH1 has-been reality show The Surreal Life in 2005. I watched that season of Surreal Life, and Curry really threw herself at Knight. She seemed incredibly immature and kept bragging about how she was going to land a Brady. She is 25 years younger than he is and is all of 28 now while he’s 53. Those two got a spin off series, My Fair Brady, documenting their relationship and marriage. I saw about two episodes of that and they were in couples’ therapy before they even got married and Adrienne kept threatening to break up with Chris.\n\nThe last I heard of them, Curry was papped out with Knight and went on a rant against marriage. A female paparazzo asked Curry for advice since she was just about to get married, and Curry said “It’s my belief that men and women aren’t really designed to be with each other, but since this is purgatory we can’t live without them. So this is our punishment for whatever it is we did… It’s a lot of work and dedication and time. So don’t do it unless you’re willing to go the distance. That’s why a lot of people get divorced after a few years.”\n\nThen Knight chimed in and said “We’re from two different planets.”\n\n“Especially when you’ve got a big age gap,” Knight added.\n\nThese two are now kaput after five years of marriage, which just makes me wonder what took so long. They made the announcement to Hollyscoop on what would have been their fifth anniversary.\n\nAfter five years of wedding bliss, Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight have decided to end their marriage.\n\nThe couple announced their split to Hollyscoop exclusively on the five-year anniversary of their wedding.\n\nIn a statement released exclusively to Hollyscoop by the coupleâs long-time friend and manager Phil Viardo â Christopher Knight and Adrianne Curry are calling it quits.\n\nâActor Christopher Knight and his wife, model and television star Adrianne Curry have announced today on their five-year wedding anniversary that they are separating,â Viardo confirmed to Hollyscoop.\n\nâAfter starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated. The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in.\n\nâObvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort. The couple has mutually determined that they are at a place where moving forward will require a step back. They still love one another but need some distance to consider their future.\n\nâBoth Knight and Curry decided to release this joint announcement today in order to preempt any potential rumors and gossip and ask that their fans and the media respect their privacy during this delicate period.â\n\n[From Hollyscoop]\n\nThat’s probably the longest split announcement I’ve ever read, and it’s obviously timed for headlines. The article concludes that there’s no scandal there, but we’ll see. I doubt a lot of people will care. It looks like Mrs. Brady was right, for what it’s worth. Not much, considering that just about everyone saw this coming. I guess we should congratulate them for lasting this long.\n\nThese are the most recent photos I can find of these two. They’re practically making out on the red carpet on 4/11/11. What a difference six weeks makes, or not. Credit: PRPhotos"
