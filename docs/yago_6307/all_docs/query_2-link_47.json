        "text": "Former America’s Top Model winner Adrianne Curry — who was also featured in the reality show My Fair Brady, which was about her marriage to Christopher Knight, who played Peter Brady on The Brady Bunch — has deleted her Twitter account after Melanie Lynskey took issue with her body-shaming comments.\n\nThe skirmish began after this week’s episode of The Last of Us, which featured a Warlord-type character played by Lynskey. Curry tweeted that Lynskey didn’t have the typical body of a warlord and wondered why a Linda Hamilton-type wasn’t cast, instead. Lynskey basically told Curry to jump up her ass. “I’m playing a person who meticulously planned & executed an overthrow of FEDRA. I am supposed to be SMART, ma’am. I don’t need to be muscly. That’s what henchmen are for.”\n\nCurry hit back with a lame tweet later about making fun of Jason Momoa in Aquaman but subsequently deleted her Twitter account. However, she used her Facebook page to accuse Lynskey of orchestrating a bullying campaign.\n\nIn criticism of a character I didn’t like in the last of us..the actress screen shotted it and posted it for her fans to BULLY me over an opinion on a FICTIONAL CHARACTER. LOL. Actors and actresses that cannot take criticism of characters they play Is absurd to me. I acted in a film that people tore my character to SHREDS. I am not the character. It wasn’t a direct attack. I survived. Anyway, I’m keeping off Twitter till her fans stop berating me for not finding her feminine stature suitable for warlord status.\n\nOK, one: She was not criticizing the character, she was criticizing the body type of a character, a body type that Lynskey shares with the character. Publicly taking issue with a criticism of a body type is not absurd. And I’m sure that Curry’s character was “tore to shreds,” but I also suspect a lot of it had to do with Curry’s acting ability and the movies in which Curry appeared."
