        "text": "Adrianne Curry and Christopher Knight are no longer married. They were married for five years and announced their separation on their fifth wedding anniversary.\n\nTheir separation was announced by their longtime friend and manager, Phil Viardo. The news came as a surprise to many fans, as the couple seemed to be very much in love.\n\nAdrianne Curry, the first winner of *America’s Next Top Model*, and Christopher Knight, best known as Peter Brady from *The Brady Bunch*, met in 2006. They began dating shortly after and were married in 2007. Their relationship was often in the public eye, as they were both celebrities. However, they seemed to be very happy together and often shared their love for each other with their fans.\n\nUnfortunately, despite their efforts to make their relationship work, the couple decided to separate. The reason for their separation has not been publicly disclosed, and both Adrianne and Christopher have declined to comment on the matter. However, it is clear that both parties are looking to move on from the relationship and focus on their individual lives."
