        "text": "I was just channel surfing a few minutes ago when I saw Dr. Phil's show. Todays show was about a woman who felt like she was being stalked and harassed by her neighbour when he says she is the actual troublemaker. They were talking to the woman and they pointed the camera to a few audience members when I saw Adrianne Curry sitting towards the front.\n\nI don't know if this has been posted yet, but I decided to look up Adrienne Curry + Dr. Phil online and I found that she's going to be on the show in two days!\n\nIn the shows section on www.drphil.com it says she will be in an episode with Christopher Knight on the topic of \"Does Age Matter\".\n\nDoes Age Matter?\n\nCan May-December romances really last? Christopher Knight, famous for his role as Peter on The Brady Bunch, and Adrianne Curry, winner on America's Next Top Model, began their relationship when they starred together on the reality show The Surreal Life 4, and the public watched as they planned their wedding on their own show, My Fair Brady. Now they both say their 24-year age difference is a huge problem in their chaotic marriage. Adrianne says Christopher treats her like an employee, and Christopher says if she worked for him, she would’ve been fired a long time ago. Can these two work out their generational differences? Then, 38-year-old Shelly wants to know if it’s wrong to be in a relationship with an 18-year-old friend of her son. She says he makes her feel beautiful but wonders if she’s causing him or her children harm. Dr. Phil doesn’t mince words when he tells her his opinion.\n\nOHHH SNAP! This sounds intense!! Chris said if she was an employee of his she would've been fired a long time ago?!?! This is a must watch for those who miss Adrienne and Chris' show My Fair Brady.\n\nMy Grandma is a HUGE Dr. Phil and Jay Leno fan. I am planning to take her to a taping of both shows. I never imagined I would go to a show to sit in the audience. I'm jaded by that stuff, and it doesn't really impress me...just looks like work. However, to sit there with someone who will enjoy it so much, I know I will have a good time! I know quite a few people who work on Dr. Phil, so I am having them work on getting a pic of him and my Grandma. She would swoon! Good thing is we will be VIP's...so Grandma wont have to stand and wait in line with her new knee. It pains her to stand too long. What next? Jay Leno, of course! A friend of mine is going to get us in VIP, and I hope we can work in my Grandma meeting Jay.\n\nCatch the Dr. Phil show with Adrienne Curry and Chris Knight this Friday September 21, 2007.\n\nDo you think Adrianne and Chris will last?\n\nNot at all!\n\n23(12.3%)\n\nYes, they're in love\n\n22(11.8%)\n\nMaybe for a while but they will eventually divorce\n\n84(44.9%)\n\nIt's possible, so maybe\n\n49(26.2%)\n\nWe'll see what happens after Dr. Phil\n\n9(4.8%)"
