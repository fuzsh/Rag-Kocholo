        "text": "Winter arrived for one former reality star on her wedding day. America’s Next Top Model alum Adrianne Curry eloped with her longtime boyfriend, Matthew “Ducksauce” Rhode, in mid-September, and the model took advantage of the picturesque scenery of Glacier National Park to stage the most epic Game of Thrones-themed ceremony possible.\n\nCurry, 36, and Rhode opted to forgo the fanfare of a more traditional wedding in order to kick off their married life with their own unique style. “The stress and agony of wedding planning is just not for me,” the ANTM winner wrote on her website. “We wanted an intimate and meaningful wedding. People opposed our career changes, our life changes, etc. It made sense to just do the thing in a personal way and save for our future.”\n\nThe pair married in Logans Pass with bright open, blue skies, towering green mountains and clear water surrounding them. Their photographer, Brooke Stevens-Patrick, also served as the couple’s officiant, capturing many magical moments from the day. In several images that Curry shared to her Instagram, she and Rhode can be seen smooching passionately and holding hands before a stunning backdrop.\n\nWhat made their big day even more magical was that Curry donned a billowing gown inspired directly by GoT character Daenerys Targaryen’s own dress, complete with “custom laser-cut brass shoulders, corset and tiara,” The piece was made by the bride’s best friend Lauren Matesic, the owner of Castle Corsetry.\n\n“I had always been obsessed with it,” Curry explained on her site of her decision to recreate Daenerys’ Qarth gown. “The metal work looked elvish. Also, the Grecian flow of it was always something I envied and I wish I had in my closet.”\n\nOne particularly epic photo shows the couple sharing their first kiss as husband and wife. Yet another shows Curry leaning sweetly into Rhode’s shoulder as they stand in a vast field of tall yellow grass.\n\nCurry has been married once before to The Brady Bunch’s Christopher Knight back in 2006. The pair ended up splitting in 2011 and having their split finalized in 2013. Perhaps in part in reflection of her past relationships and in her understanding of her new marriage, Curry wrote a lengthy, heartfelt note to her followers about figuring out the true meaning of love.\n\n“When we are young, we THINK we know what love is. When we get a little wiser, we KNOW what love is. Most times than not, it ends up NOT being what we thought it was,” she wrote. “Love is not feeling a flip in your stomach when he goes out. It is not worrying who he is texting, messaging or calling. Love is not being told you’re stupid, dumb, or not your partners equal. Love is not ‘keeping your options open’ with past flings/interests while with your mate. Love is not forgetting to call or lying about how late you were out with friends. Love is being considerate of your partner and ALWAYS putting their well being first. Love is not living any sort of private and or unknown life on the side.”\n\n“Love is a complicated thing and it isn’t always easy….but love makes you feel GOOD more than it makes you feel bad,” she continued. “Love is TRUSTING your partner completely because they would NEVER lie, cheat or sneak. Love is apologizing and meaning it.”\n\nCurry and Rhode, who works as a voiceover actor, got engaged in August 2017, and currently live together in Montana.\n\nSecure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.\n\nRelated Articles"
