        "text": "Former \"Brady Bunch\" star Christopher Knight has filed for a divorce from his reality star wife Adrianne Curry, TMZ reports.\n\nIn May, the two announced they were separating to rethink the marriage, but now, it appears Knight has reached his final decision.\n\nKnight filed divorce papers in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Aug. 19, according to court records obtained by TMZ.\n\nA rep for the couple told TMZ that \"they are amicable and remain friends.\"\n\nKnight, 53, is best known for playing middle brother Peter Brady on the iconic 1969-74 sitcom. He met Curry, 29, a former \"America's Next Top Model\" winner, when they were both contestants on the fourth season of the VH1 reality series \"The Surreal Life.\" When that show ended, the pair moved in together and became engaged -- a romance that was documented on the 2005 VH1 series \"My Fair Brady.\"\n\nThat series was renewed for a second season and its title was altered to \"My Fair Brady: We're Getting Married\" to incorporate their 2006, Goth-style nuptials in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Ill. A third season, \"My Fair Brady: Maybe Baby\" aired in 2008. Although the season ended with Curry throwing away her birth control pills while on a second honeymoon with Knight in Hawaii, the couple never had children."
