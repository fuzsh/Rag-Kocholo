        "text": "After skyrocketing to super stardom on America’s Next Top Model, The Surreal Life, and My Fair Brady, things went silent.\n\nIs she difficult to work with? Can she come back? Will she ever get an Oscar nom at this point?\n\nThe last thing I remember is she surprised Christopher Knight with a lesbian photoshoot and he flipped out on her. I think they were both head cases.\n\nDid she really have a career? She did ANTM, then The Surreal Life where she met Chris Knight and they were together for a while and had that show and then that’s it.\n\n\"After skyrocketing to super stardom on America’s Next Top Model, The Surreal Life, and My Fair Brady, things went silent.\"\n\nYou clearly don't understand the concept of super stardom.\n\nI liked her. i liked that she fell for the wrong guy - and not the one the agents and producers picked for her. She and Knight had nice chemistry.\n\nR30, the ANTM models from the social media era have fared much better than those from the earlier seasons. Leila Goldkuhl and Nyle DiMarco are others who benefited from the TV exposure; there used to be a stigma surrounding models who appeared on reality shows, but now it’s a positive.\n\nAdrianne is pretty, but she did not look like a fashion model and the judges and producers knew it—she just had the best narrative.\n\nThese days she sells Mary Kay and trolls social justice warriors from her home in Montana. Rather crass and whiny and uses “gay” as a pejorative.\n\n[quote]r31 Adrianne is pretty, but she did not look like a fashion model and the judges and producers knew it—she just had the best narrative.\n\nI don't know... she was pretty spectacular looking. But there is something maybe too out there and sexy about her, personality wise, to be a mainstream model. Unlike her competitor Elyse, who was fashion down to her (anorexic) fingertips.\n\nOne problem with the show is they want someone who can do high fashion, swimwear, beauty, catalouge, runway and commercials, in addition to being a spokesperson. Well, even top models aren't good at ALL those things. So it's kind of hard to figure out who would be \"the best\" on any given cycle since none of them can possibly ever excell at all those things.\n\nSometimes I think about how many if those Surreal Life people are dead. Lots of addicts on those shows. Sad."
