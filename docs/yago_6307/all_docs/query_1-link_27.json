She is needy and....dare I say, quite abusive (physically and verbally). I also know she has a history of hating men, so this could get ugly. I just think he is a sweet guy, has more to offer than just being some infantile model's arm candy....and, normally age differences don't bother me, but she is a very childish 23 years of age and he is pushing 50. All she does is whine and bitch about not getting her way one minute, then throws a violent tantrum the next, then balls her eyes out when Chris gets pissed (rightfully so) at her. If the situation was in reverse, you'd have NOW and every other feminist organizations raising hell......but, I guess man hating and husband/boyfriend abusing has not only become acceptable in society...but frighteningly enough, it's become somewhat a part of pop culture. She's basically going by an idealized crush she had on him while filming a reality show, now...they are married, and she sees he has flaws and is less than perfect, but instead of pushing the guy around, she should really just lay off him. Okay, sometimes he says things to her as well, but when he tries to apologize, she turns into a total drama queen! I'm just voicing my concern, because Chris/Peter has been the love of my life throughout my childhood wathing the \"Brady Bunch\". I just don't want to see him get hurt. If she makes him happy, fine......I just better not hear anything about her hurting him in any way!\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: Denise Richards\n\nMaybe he should cheat on her for Tyra Banks, if she's single or into cheating :D\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: bradybunchrules\n\n;) ;D\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: Mushroom\n\nI have not seen their show, and have no intention of ever watching their show.\n\nFor one, I am not obsessed about the famous or once famous. I could not care less if somebody was an actor at one time or not. They still put on their socks the same way as I do, and have money problems, relationship problems, and everyhting else that we all go through.\n\nNot to mention that last week I had to see the same commercial for their show over and over again on VH1. I am a regular view of their \"I Love The decade\" shows. Last week was \"I Love The 70's\", and I saw every one. And it seems like every single commercial break, there was the same shot for \"My Fair Brady\".\n\nAnd to be honest, it just completely grossed me out and showed me why I did not want to ever see it. It was like every 10-15 minutes, I was greeted with a shot of her farting in his face. Yea, like I really want to see that, or 30 minutes of such gutter humor.\n\nYou can watch Mr. Rogers\n\nYou can watch Three's Company\n\nAnd you can turn on Fame or The Nelywed Game\n\nOr The Addams Family\n\nI say, you can watch Barney Miller\n\nAnd you can watch your MTV\n\nAnd you can watch 'till your eyes fall out of your head\n\nThat'll be OK with me\n\nAnd you can watch (TV)\n\nYou can watch Johnny Carson\n\nYou can watch Phil Donahue\n\nAnd you can use TV Guide to help you decide\n\nWith capsulized review\n\nSay, you can watch 60 Minutes\n\nEven Captain Kangaroo\n\nBut there's only one set, so what ever you watch\n\nWell, you know I gotta watch it too\n\nSay, give it up, give it up, television's taking its toll\n\nThat's enought, that's enough, gimme the remote controll\n\nI been nice, I been good, please don't do this to me\n\nTurn it off, turn it off, I don't want to have to see\n\nThe Brady Bunch\n\nNot The Brady Bunch\n\nWell, The Brady Bunch\n\nYeah, The Brady Bunch\n\nIt's the story of a lovely lady\n\nWho was bringing up three very lovely girls\n\nAll of them had hair of gold, like their mother\n\nThe youngest one in curls\n\nIt's a story of a man named Brady\n\nWho was busy with three boys of his own\n\nThey were four men living all together\n\nYeah, but they were all alone\n\nUntil the one day, one day when the lady met the fellow\n\nAnd they knew, and they knew it was much more than a hunch\n\nThen they knew this group must somehow form a family\n\nThat's the way, that's the way, that's the way they all became\n\nThe Brady Bunch\n\nWell, The Brady Bunch\n\nYeah, The Brady Bunch\n\nWell, The Brady Bunch\n\nOh, it's The Brady Bunch\n\nIt's The Brady Bunch\n\nOh, The Brady Bunch, yeah\n\nOh, The Brady Bunch\n\nIt's The Brady Bunch\n\nWell, it's The Brady Bunch\n\nWell, it's The Brady Bunch\n\nWell, it's The Brady Bunch\n\nIt's The Brady Bunch\n\n\"Brady Bunch\", by Weird Al\n\nsung to the tune of \"The Safety Dance\" by Men Without Hats\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: whistledog\n\nIs their show still on ?\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: quirky_cat_girl\n\nwho knows...but I watched a few episodes of it...and she totally grossed me out. She's like a pig (lack of manners, vulgar), worse than a man. I don't know what he ever saw in her, really. And, I don't know how she got as far as she did on that \"Top Model\" show...I just don't get it.\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: whistledog\n\nQuirk and Capt Quirk. It's all very confusing :D\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: whistledog\n\nSpeaking of reality shows, how's about a show called \"The Quirks\" :D\n\nSubject: Re: Christopher Knight (Peter Brady) REALLY needs to leave Adrianne Curry!!!!!\n\nWritten By: Capt Quirk\n\nMy reality isn't for the faint of heart. Come to think of it, neither is my fantasy. I can guarantee it wouldn't even make it as a PG13."
