        "text": "We're getting awfully close to the Big Day in My Fair Brady's most recent episode this past Sunday. Still hanging out in Adrianne Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois, Christopher Knight and his young 20-something bride-to-be continue to chip away at their long list of wedding plans while staying in the confines of Adrianne's mother's house. Of course, even things that are supposed to be done in the spirit of love, family and affection can get out of hand in the bubble that is Christopher's and Adrianne's everyday world. In that parallel universe, things such as \"cake testing\" can quickly get out of hand. But more on that later.As the episode begins this week, Chris and Adrianne's mother, Christine, go out alone to grab some breakfast, leaving Adrianne behind in the house all by her lonesome. Though the show builds up their relationship as a turbulent one, they seem to get along quite well at breakfast, something Chris makes sure to back up in his testimonial. However, their good spirits suddenly turn to sorrowful ones as Chris brings up the point of Christine and her ex-husband (Adrianne's father) and how they will interact at the wedding, and if they will meet up beforehand to sort anything out. Dodging most of the inquisition, Christine makes one thing clear - she'll get together with him, but not immediately.Thereafter, things get less serious and more funny. Adrianne and her ex-Brady middle child beau head out to go, as Chris called it, \"cake testing.\" Adrianne throws a pity party for herself, however, as she rapidly becomes jaded with having to plan the wedding, and impartial to half of the things they have to decide. After driving recklessly like a maniac, screaming \"shut up!\" and \"damnit!\" like a banshee to Chris and her grandmother (who is, unfortunately for her, in tow on this misadventure), they arrive at \"Creative Cakes,\" where the fun begins. After being introduced to a ridiculous amount of cake flavors and combinations (more than even Brady maid Alice could bake herself in that horrifying-colored kitchen of hers), Adrianne displays her, in the words of Chris, \"energy that is non-cooperative,\" and immediately settles on a cake combination so they can get out of there. To lighten the mood, Chris puts some cake on her nose. What follows is a ridiculously over-dramatic display of Adrianne's moodiness, as she chases Chris around the parking lot, finally getting him and smearing cake all over his face. Adrianne obviously took the whole thing too far, though she has what could very well be the quote of the episode when she comments that Chris is \"such a little bitch.\" Touch¿, Adrianne. Touch¿. Back in the car, more unnecessary (and, at this point, somewhat repetitive) drama ensues as Adrianne reflects on the situation with her two parents, one she obviously doesn't understand too well. Back at home, Adrianne's mom and grandma get in on the teary act. Finally, Chris breaks up the teary-eyed women convention with an invite to a surprise dinner for his fiancé. Chris is bringing her to the Rialto, where they intend on having their wedding reception. After a display of their classy clothing for such an event (especially Adrianne's super-chic handcuff handbag), the couple goes off to the surprise dinner in a style very reminiscent of how Chris proposed to Adrianne last season. Nonetheless, when the couple settles down to dinner, a very impressed Adrianne and an overly emotional (uncomfortably so) Chris Knight begin to reminisce on their past, such as when they fell in love when they met on The Surreal Life.And just like that, after several minutes of reminiscence, the show suddenly ends with some extremely tantalizing scenes from next week's bachelor/bachelorette party episode, from Las Vegas. As usual, My Fair Brady manages to keep things progressing in an interesting manner, while mixing up the coherence of the show with complete madness as in, during this week's episode, the cake testing trial. But what we're really excited for is next week's episode. From what we can tell, we can expect some lesbian action and plenty of quintessential Chris and Adrianne throwdown-style fighting. 'Til then, this episode should hold you over as the run-of-the-mill, but highly entertaining, My Fair Brady fare."
