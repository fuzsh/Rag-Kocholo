        "text": "Chicago DJ as Seen on VH-1’s “My Fair Brady”\n\nAnd when it came time to choose a disc jockey, they naturally chose Chicagoland’s premier mobile entertainment company, Fourth Estate Audio. When I met with them in my home to begin the planning, they were just like any other engaged couple — thrilled to be getting married, and nervous about getting all the details just perfect. Of course, there were TV releases and confidentiality agreements to sign, since, at the time, their hit VH-1 show, “My Fair Brady,” wasn’t even close to revealing whether they would actually go through with the wedding.\n\nChris and Adrianne were a joy to work with, and their reception was a spectacular affair, complete with dozens of VH-1 cameras and a crew from “Entertainment Tonight” recording every moment. The reception gave me a chance to renew an old acquaintance with Barry Williams (“Greg Brady”), and to meet Susan Olsen (“Cindy”). Mike Lookinland (“Bobby”) was also there, but regrettably, Marcia and Jan couldn’t make it.\n\nIt was a magical evening, and a joyful conclusion to the “My Fair Brady” television saga.\n\n– Jay Congdon"
