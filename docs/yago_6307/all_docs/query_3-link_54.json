        "text": "American actor\n\nFor other people named Christopher Knight, see Christopher Knight (disambiguation).\n\nChristopher Anton Knight (born November 7, 1957)[2] is an American actor and businessman. He is best known for playing Peter Brady in the 1970s series The Brady Bunch. He has since gone on to become a businessman and enjoyed a semi-resurgence in the public eye with television appearances in the 2000s.\n\nEarly life and work\n\n[edit]\n\nKnight was born in New York City, New York, the son of Wilma and Edward Knight, an actor.[3] Knight's father was born Edward Kozumplik, to parents from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while Knight's mother was Jewish.[4][5]\n\nThe Brady Bunch and other roles\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the Brady Bunch series, Knight had some small television roles, including an appearance on the first season of Mannix, in a 1967 episode called \"Coffin for a Clown\". In 1969, Knight was cast as middle son Peter Brady on the ABC sitcom The Brady Bunch, which ran until 1974. He was also the voice of Peter in the ABC Saturday morning cartoon The Brady Kids (1972-74).\n\nAfter the end of the Brady Bunch, Knight's acting career consisted mostly of making guest appearances on other television shows (Happy Days, The Love Boat), and occasional film roles (Just You and Me, Kid, Curfew, Good Girls Don't, The Doom Generation, and Nowhere). He reunited with his former Brady costars in several subsequent series, including The Brady Bunch Hour (1976-77), the TV movie The Brady Girls Get Married (1981), the holiday TV movie A Very Brady Christmas (1988), and the drama The Bradys (1990). He also had a cameo role as a coach in the film The Brady Bunch Movie (1995).\n\nComputer career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Knight, a self-described \"geek\", left acting to pursue a business career in the computer industry. He got a job as an account sales manager for Martec, Inc. and landed that company's first million-dollar sales deal within his first 18 months on the job, for which he was named Employee of the Year. In 1989, he was named Vice President of Design System Marketing and Sales at New Image Industry.\n\nIn 1991, he co-founded Visual Software, a pioneering 3D graphics company. In 1995, he founded Kidwise Learningware, a company that manufactures interactive educational products. In 1996, he joined the keyboard manufacturer Adesso, and in 1997, he became Vice President of Marketing at iXMicro, a video hardware company. In 1998, he founded his own TV tuner company, Eskape Labs; it was purchased by Hauppauge Computer Works in 2000.[2]\n\nReturn to television\n\n[edit]\n\nContinuing to pursue TV opportunities, Knight appeared on VH1's fourth season of The Surreal Life. The show garnered Knight more attention than he had received in quite some time, in part because he appeared shirtless on the show, revealing a well-built body. During his stint on the show, he began a romance with castmate model Adrianne Curry, winner of America's Next Top Model cycle 1, who is almost 25 years younger than Knight. After the show, the two moved in together and got engaged, as documented on the VH1 series My Fair Brady, which premiered on September 11, 2005. The series was renewed for another season, and the couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois, on May 29, 2006, in a Gothic-style wedding.[6]\n\nKnight participated in VH-1's retrospective miniseries, I Love The '70s: Volume II. He, his family, and friends appeared on the season finale of NBC's Celebrity Family Feud on July 29, 2008. During the 2008–09 television season, Knight hosted the syndicated game show, Trivial Pursuit: America Plays. He has hosted a series of Jonathan Goodson-produced game show specials for the Michigan Lottery, Make Me Rich. The first special was scheduled for October 16, 2009, with a second scheduled for February 2010. The show aired periodically until early 2012.[7] Knight joined the other Brady Bunch cast members in the 2019 television series A Very Brady Renovation on HGTV.[8] In 2021, he starred in the Lifetime Christmas movie, Blending Christmas, alongside his Brady Bunch co-stars Barry Williams, Mike Lookinland, Susan Olsen, and Robbie Rist.[9]\n\nIn 2022, Knight, Williams, and Lookinland competed in season eight of The Masked Singer as \"Mummies\". They were eliminated in the third episode, which aired as the October 3 \"TV Theme Night\" alongside Daymond John as \"Fortune Teller\".[10] On June 28, 2024, Knight appeared as a guest on Toon In With Me, which airs on MeTV.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nKnight has been married four times.[11] Knight proposed to his third wife, model and reality television personality Adrianne Curry, on the season finale of My Fair Brady, on VH1, which aired on November 6, 2005. The show was renewed for a second season that began in June 2006, and focused on the couple's wedding preparations. The couple wed in Curry's hometown of Joliet, Illinois, on May 29, 2006, in a gothic-style wedding. Knight's manager, Phil Viardo, told a celebrity gossip website on May 29, 2011, that Knight and Curry were announcing their separation. The date was the couple's fifth wedding anniversary.[12] On February 2, 2012, on G4's Attack of the Show, Curry said the divorce had been finalized.[13] He married his fourth wife, Cara Kokenes, in November 2016.[11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1979 Just You and Me, Kid Roy 1989 Curfew Sam 1993 Good Girls Don't Montana 1995 Coach 1997 Nowhere Mr. Sighvatssohn 2000 Family Jewels The Guru 2003 Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star Christopher Knight 2005 L.A.
