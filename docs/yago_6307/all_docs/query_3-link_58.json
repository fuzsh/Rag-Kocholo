        "text": "Adrianne Curry, 20 from Joliet, IIInois was a contestant and winner of Americas Next Top Model, Cycle 1. Adrianne was in the bottom two, two times throughout the contest the first one with Kesse Wallace where the judges questioned her time on the go-sees and the second one with Elyse Sewell. In the finale of ANTM Adrianne was up against highly popular christian girl Shannon Stewart but in the end the judges chose Adrianne Curry as the first ever winner of ANTM. After ANTM, Adrianne collected all her prizes and has modelled for several magazines including \"Life and Weekly\" and \"OK!\" magazines. She has also walked for Pamela Anderson but currently has stopped modeling and was married to Christopher Knight but know the couple are seperated. Adrianne, although she has stopped modeling is still signed with agencies Whilhelmina Models and Avenue Models. Although in the contest Tyra and Adrianne were lovely to each other after when Adrianne did not get one of the prizes included because the company did not like her, her and Tyra had a big fight about the prize Adrianne was supposed to get. Now because of the fight with Tyra Banks, Tyra does not feature her as one of the winners in the openings of cycles."
