        "text": "Former America's Next Top Model winner and nerd queen Adrianne Curry and erstwhile Peter Brady actor Christopher Knight are separating, just as they are celebrating their fifth year of marriage. The Juice* didn't know five years was the divorce-papers anniversary\n\n\"After starting a relationship with what seemed to be irreconcilable differences, the couple has reached a period where those differences are no longer appreciated, the couples' manager Phil Viardo told Hollyscoop. This was back on Sunday, so you see how high a priority this breakup is for us.\n\n\"The decision was mutually reached after it became clear to both that some perspective was needed in order to assess their unique union. Not unlike all marriages, work must be put in. Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship. They are taking time to see if they want to continue to put in that extraordinary effort.\"\n\nIf that's not a pitch for a follow-up reality show, then we don't know jack about how TV executives think. That's what happens when you meet on The Surreal Life and spend the entire run of My Fair Brady working up to your wedding.\n\n[Photo: Getty Images]\n\nSource\n\nPosted by Joshua Gillin at 2:01:08 pm on May 31, 2011"
