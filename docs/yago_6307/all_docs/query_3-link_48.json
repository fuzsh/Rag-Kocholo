        "text": "edit: The Finale is most likely July 16, but it might be a week after or before\n\nI guess since she wrote it in her myspace blog i can tell you all that Adrianne got married on monday.\n\nI was there, and I opened the door several times in the ceremony (like for flower girl and the bride) and so you can see me on the season finale.\n\nIt was a beautiful ceremony. I cannot post any photos because I am really not in the mood to get sued. Photos were leaked from the reception and sold to e! by one of the servers, it was a really grainy photo.\n\nI met Kesse also, but since she was a bridesmaid, i cannot post any photos of her either until after the final episode. And Shannon was there too.\n\nI told Kesse that you guys found her Church's chicken commercial and she was soo excited. She was so nice, she told my sister i was her new boyfriend and i was her \"boo\"\n\nWe danced at the reception and we are friends now! Shannon was there too, i talked with her for a bit, but I didn't connect with her like I did Kesse! I met Chyna too. Oh and I met Alison Dubois (the show Medium is based off her life). She was very very cool!\n\nAnyways, I will make a big photo post after the final episode airs, so you will all just have to wait, but it will be worth it.\n\nBut anyways, just to let everyone know, she got married on monday and now she is off to Tahiti for her honeymoon and done with taping for now."
