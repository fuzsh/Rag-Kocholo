        "text": "Students may not apply for Phi Beta Kappa. Those juniors with a 3.85 g.p.a. or higher and seniors with a 3.7 g.p.a. or higher by the end of the fall semester are automatically considered and their transcripts are evaluated by the Electoral Board, which also solicits letters of recommendation for eligible students.\n\nThe records of students who graduated the previous year are reviewed, and a number of these students may be elected as well. Therefore, each student is granted at least two opportunities for review by the committee. Students who have Incompletes on their transcripts may be denied membership.\n\nStudents must have a minimum of 16 completed course units and not have been subject to a disciplinary action for an academic integrity violation to be eligible. It is the practice of the Delta Chapter to elect no more than eight percent of the graduating class each year. A small number of juniors is also selected at the spring meeting."
