        "text": "Abstract\n\nImportance: The risk of adverse events from ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm (TAA) is poorly understood but drives clinical decision-making.Objective: To evaluate the association of TAA size with outcomes in nonsyndromic patients in a large non-referral-based health care delivery system.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Kaiser Permanente Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (KP-TAA) cohort study was a retrospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a fully integrated health care delivery system insuring and providing care for more than 4.5 million persons. Nonsyndromic patients from a regional TAA safety net tracking system were included. Imaging data including maximum TAA size were merged with electronic health record (EHR) and comprehensive death data to obtain demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory values, vital signs, and subsequent outcomes. Unadjusted rates were calculated and the association of TAA size with outcomes was evaluated in multivariable competing risk models that categorized TAA size as a baseline and time-updated variable and accounted for potential confounders. Data were analyzed from January 2018 to August 2021.Exposures: TAA size.Main Outcomes and Measures: Aortic dissection (AD), all-cause death, and elective aortic surgery.Results: Of 6372 patients with TAA identified between 2000 and 2016 (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [13.0] years; 2050 female individuals [32.2%] and 4322 male individuals [67.8%]), mean (SD) initial TAA size was 4.4 (0.5) cm (828 individuals [13.0% of cohort] had initial TAA size 5.0 cm or larger and 280 [4.4%] 5.5 cm or larger). Rates of AD were low across a mean (SD) 3.7 (2.5) years of follow-up (44 individuals [0.7% of cohort]; incidence 0.22 events per 100 person-years). Larger initial aortic size was associated with higher risk of AD and all-cause death in multivariable models, with an inflection point in risk at 6.0 cm. Estimated adjusted risks of AD within 5 years were 0.3% (95% CI, 0.3-0.7), 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4-1.3), 1.5% (95% CI, 1.2-3.9), 3.6% (95% CI, 1.8-12.8), and 10.5% (95% CI, 2.7-44.3) in patients with TAA size of 4.0 to 4.4 cm, 4.5 to 4.9 cm, 5.0 to 5.4 cm, 5.5 to 5.9 cm, and 6.0 cm or larger, respectively, in time-updated models. Rates of the composite outcome of AD and all-cause death were higher than for AD alone, but a similar inflection point for increased risk was observed at 6.0 cm.Conclusions and Relevance: In a large sociodemographically diverse cohort of patients with TAA, absolute risk of aortic dissection was low but increased with larger aortic sizes after adjustment for potential confounders and competing risks. Our data support current consensus guidelines recommending prophylactic surgery in nonsyndromic individuals with TAA at a 5.5-cm threshold.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamacardio.2022.3305\n\nView details for PubMedID 36197675\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare midterm outcomes of aortic valve-replacing root replacement (AVR) and aortic valve-sparing root replacement (AVS) operations in patients with Marfan syndrome.METHODS: Patients who met strict Ghent diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome and who underwent either AVR or AVS between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 were enrolled in a 3-year follow-up prospective, multicenter, international registry study; the study was subsequently amended to include 20-year follow-up. Enrollees were followed clinically and echocardiographically.RESULTS: Of the 316 patients enrolled, 77 underwent AVR and 239 underwent AVS; 214 gave reconsent for 20-year follow-up. The median clinical follow-up time for surviving patients was 64months (interquartile range, 42-66months). Survival rates for the AVR and AVS groups were similar at 88.2%±4.4% and 95.0%±1.5%, respectively (P=.1). Propensity score-adjusted competing risk modeling showed associations between AVS and higher cumulative incidences of major adverse valve-related events, valve-related morbidity, combined structural valve deterioration and nonstructural valve dysfunction, and aortic regurgitation ≥2+ (all P<.01). No differences were found for reintervention (P=.7), bleeding (P=.2), embolism (P=.3), or valve-related mortality (P=.8).CONCLUSIONS: Five years postoperatively, major adverse valve-related events and valve-related morbidity were more frequent after AVS than after AVR procedures, primarily because of more frequent aortic valve dysfunction. No between-group differences were found in rates of survival, valve-related mortality, reintervention on the aortic valve, or bleeding. We plan to follow this homogenous cohort for 20years after aortic root replacement.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2021.08.064\n\nView details for PubMedID 34629178\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: It is unknown whether transcatheter valves will have similar durability as surgical bioprosthetic valves. Definitions of structural valve deterioration (SVD), based on valve related reintervention or death, underestimate the incidence of SVD.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine and compare the 5-year incidence of SVD, using new standardized definitions based on echocardiographic follow-up of valve function, in intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis given transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 2A trial and registry.METHODS: In the PARTNER 2A trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAVR with the SAPIEN XT or SAVR, whereas in the SAPIEN 3 registry, patients were assigned to TAVR with the SAPIEN 3. The primary endpoint was the incidence of SVD, that is, the composite of SVD-related hemodynamic valve deterioration during echocardiographic follow-up and/or SVD-related bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) at 5 years.RESULTS: Compared with SAVR, the SAPIEN-XT TAVR cohort had a significantly higher 5-year exposure adjusted incidence rates (per 100 patient-years) of SVD (1.61 ± 0.24% vs. 0.63 ± 0.16%), SVD-related BVF (0.58 ± 0.14% vs. 0.12 ± 0.07%), and all-cause (structural or nonstructural) BVF (0.81 ± 0.16% vs. 0.27 ± 0.10%) (p≤ 0.01 for all). The 5-year rates of SVD (0.68 ± 0.18% vs. 0.60 ± 0.17%; p=0.71), SVD-related BVF (0.29 ± 0.12% vs. 0.14 ± 0.08%; p=0.25), and all-cause BVF (0.60 ± 0.15% vs. 0.32 ± 0.11%; p=0.32) in SAPIEN 3 TAVR were not significantly different to a propensity score matched SAVR cohort. The 5-year rates of SVD and SVD-related BVF were significantly lower in SAPIEN 3 versus SAPIEN XT TAVR matched cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SAVR, the second-generation SAPIEN XT balloon-expandable valve has a higher 5-year rate of SVD, whereas the third-generation SAPIEN 3 has a rate of SVD that was not different from SAVR.

Patients were stratified according to intended transfemoral or transthoracic access (76.3% and 23.7%, respectively) and were randomly assigned to undergo either TAVR or surgical replacement. Clinical, echocardiographic, and health-status outcomes were followed for 5 years. The primary end point was death from any cause or disabling stroke.RESULTS: At 5 years, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death from any cause or disabling stroke between the TAVR group and the surgery group (47.9% and 43.4%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.25; P=0.21). Results were similar for the transfemoral-access cohort (44.5% and 42.0%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.20), but the incidence of death or disabling stroke was higher after TAVR than after surgery in the transthoracic-access cohort (59.3% vs. 48.3%; hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.71). At 5 years, more patients in the TAVR group than in the surgery group had at least mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation (33.3% vs. 6.3%). Repeat hospitalizations were more frequent after TAVR than after surgery (33.3% vs. 25.2%), as were aortic-valve reinterventions (3.2% vs. 0.8%). Improvement in health status at 5 years was similar for TAVR and surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with aortic stenosis who were at intermediate surgical risk, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death or disabling stroke at 5 years after TAVR as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement.

Therefore, we studied variability in mortality and stroke after patients were randomized to surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves-2A (PARTNER-2A) randomized trial.METHODS: Patients at intermediate risk for SAVR were randomized to SAVR (n=1017) or TAVR (n=1011) with a SAPIEN XT device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) at 54 sites. Patients were followed to 2years. A mixed-effect model quantified variability at intersite and intrasite levels.RESULTS: There were 336 deaths (SAVR 170, TAVR 166) and 176 strokes (SAVR 85, TAVR 91). Intersite variability for mortality was similar across sites for SAVR (hazard ratios ranging from 0.52-1.93 among sites) and TAVR (hazard ratios ranging from 0.49-2.03), but intersite variability for stroke was greater for SAVR (hazard ratios ranging from 0.44-2.26) than for TAVR (no detectable variability). Case mix and lower site trial volume accounted for 37% of mortality intersite variability for SAVR and 73% for TAVR, but only 14% for stroke for SAVR. Intrasite mortality hazard ratios demonstrated all but 1 site's 95% confidence interval overlapped 1.0, indicating generally similar SAVR and TAVR mortalities within sites.CONCLUSIONS: Intersite variability was similar for mortality in SAVR and TAVR, but variability for stroke was greater for SAVR than for TAVR. Intrasite events were similar for both SAVR and TAVR. These findings suggest that in performance-based trials, site variability and its sources should be taken into account in analyzing and interpreting trial results.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2019.04.112\n\nView details for PubMedID 31350027\n\nAbstract\n\nFor the management of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, recent evidence has suggested that outcomes of open surgical repair may surpass thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in as early as 2 years.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of TEVAR and open surgical repair in the treatment of intact descending thoracic aortic aneurysms.Using the Medicare database, a retrospective study using regression discontinuity design and propensity score matching was performed on patients with intact descending thoracic aortic aneurysms who underwent TEVAR or open surgical repair between 1999 and 2010 with follow-up through 2014. Survival was assessed with restricted mean survival time. Perioperative mortality was assessed with logistic regression. Reintervention was evaluated as a secondary outcome.Matching created comparable groups with 1,235 open surgical repair patients matched to 2,470 TEVAR patients. The odds of perioperative mortality were greater for open surgical repair: high-volume center, odds ratio (OR): 1.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53 to 2.61); low-volume center, OR: 3.62 (95% CI: 2.88 to 4.51). The restricted mean survival time difference favored TEVAR at 9 years, -209.2 days (95% CI: -298.7 to -119.7 days; p < 0.001) for open surgical repair. Risk of reintervention was lower for open surgical repair, hazard ratio: 0.40 (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.60; p < 0.001).Open surgical repair was associated with increased odds of early postoperative mortality but reduced late hazard of death. Despite the late advantage of open repair, mean survival was superior for TEVAR. TEVAR should be considered the first line for repair of intact descending thoracic aortic aneurysms in Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30765029\n\nAbstract\n\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for degenerated surgical bioprosthetic aortic valves is associated with favorable early outcomes. However, little is known about the durability and longer-term outcomes associated with this therapy.The aim of this study was to examine late outcomes after valve-in-valve TAVR.Patients with symptomatic degeneration of surgical aortic bioprostheses at high risk (≥50% major morbidity or mortality) for reoperative surgery were prospectively enrolled in the multicenter PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 2 valve-in-valve and continued access registries. Three-year clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was obtained.Valve-in-valve procedures were performed in 365 patients. The mean age was 78.9 ± 10.2 years, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 9.1 ± 4.7%. At 3 years, the overall Kaplan-Meier estimate of all-cause mortality was 32.7%. Aortic valve re-replacement was required in 1.9%. Mean transaortic gradient was 35.0 mm Hg at baseline, decreasing to 17.8 mm Hg at 30-day follow-up and 16.6 mm Hg at 3-year follow-up. Baseline effective orifice area was 0.93 cm2, increasing to 1.13 and 1.15 cm2 at 30 days and 3 years, respectively. Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was reduced from 45.1% at pre-TAVR baseline to 2.5% at 3 years. Importantly, moderate or severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation also decreased (33.7% vs. 8.6% [p < 0.0001] and 29.7% vs. 18.8% [p = 0.002], respectively). Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 50.7%, increasing to 54.7% at 3 years (p < 0.0001), while left ventricular mass index was 136.4 g/m2, decreasing to 109.1 g/m2 at 3 years (p < 0.0001). New York Heart Association functional class improved, with 90.4% in class III or IV at baseline and 14.1% at 3 years (p < 0.0001), and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall score increased (43.1 to 73.1; p < 0.0001).At 3-year follow-up, TAVR for bioprosthetic aortic valve failure was associated with favorable survival, sustained improved hemodynamic status, and excellent functional and quality-of-life outcomes.

Early TAVR trials consistently demonstrated O:E ratio less than 0.6 after TAVR when based on the Society for Thoracic Surgery Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) for surgical aortic valve replacement. Recent published results from the Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) Registry have demonstrated O:E ratios of 1.0. We evaluated our own O:E ratios for TAVR to investigate this discordance.METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for TAVR patients from 2008 through 2015 (N=546) and were reviewed retrospectively. The observed mortality and STS-PROM were calculated to formulate O:E ratios and were compared over a variety of subgroups.RESULTS: Overall, the O:E ratio for 30-day mortality was 0.4 and significantly less than 1 (P<.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.63). The O:E ratio relationship remained less than 0.5 for patients with low (STS-PROM<4), moderate (STS-PROM=4-8) and high risk (STS-PROM>8). The O:E ratio was significantly higher for transapical patients (O:E ratio=0.8) when compared with transfemoral patients (O:E ratio=0.2). Lastly, O:E ratios for both commercial (O:E ratio=0.5) and research (O:E ratio=0.3) patients were similar (P=.337), and both were significantly less than 1 (P=.007 and P<.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The STS-PROM consistently overestimated 30-day mortality after TAVR. Achieving an O:E ratio less than 0.6 may be a realistic goal for all TAVR programs. While an accurate and specific risk calculator for 30-day mortality after TAVR remains to be established, our data suggest that current TVT results are not acceptable for commercial TAVR and that programs with an O:E ratio greater than 0.6, based on the STS-PROM, should reevaluate internal processes to improve their results.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30454980\n\nAbstract\n\nLimited intimal tears (LITs) of the aorta (Class 3 dissection variant) are the least common form of aortic pathology in patients presenting with acute aortic syndrome (AAS). LITs are difficult to detect on imaging and may be underappreciated.This study sought to describe the frequency, pathology, treatment, and outcome of LITs compared with other AAS, and to demonstrate that LITs can be detected pre-operatively by contemporary imaging.The authors retrospectively reviewed 497 patients admitted for 513 AAS events at a single academic aortic center between 2003 and 2012. AAS were classified into classic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma, LIT, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and rupturing thoracic aortic aneurysm. The prevalence, pertinent risk factors, and detailed imaging findings with surgical and pathological correlation of LITs are described. Management, early outcomes, and late mortality are reported.Among 497 patients with AAS, the authors identified 24 LITs (4.8% of AAS) in 16 men and 8 women (17 type A, 7 type B). Patients with LITs were older than those with AD, and type A LITs had similarly dilated ascending aortas as type A AD. Three patients presented with rupture. Eleven patients underwent urgent surgical aortic replacement, and 2 patients underwent endovascular repair. Medial degeneration was present in all surgical specimens. In-hospital mortality was 4% (1 of 24), and in total, 5 patients with LIT died subsequently at 1.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.3 to 2.5 years). Computed tomography imaging detected all but 1 LIT, best visualized on volume-rendered images.LITs are rare acute aortic lesions within the dissection spectrum, with similar presentation, complications, and outcomes compared with AD and intramural hematoma. Awareness of this lesion allows pre-operative diagnosis using high-quality computed tomography angiography.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29903350\n\nAbstract\n\nUse of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis is growing rapidly. However, to our knowledge, the durability of these prostheses is incompletely defined.To determine the midterm hemodynamic performance of balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves.In this study, we analyzed core laboratory-generated data from echocardiograms of all patients enrolled in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 1 Trial with successful TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR) obtained preimplantation and at 7 days, 1 and 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postimplantation. Patients from continued access observational studies were included for comparison.Successful implantation after randomization to TAVR vs SAVR (PARTNER 1A; TAVR, n = 321; SAVR, n = 313), TAVR vs medical treatment (PARTNER 1B; TAVR, n = 165), and continued access (TAVR, n = 1996). Five-year echocardiogram data were available for 424 patients after TAVR and 49 after SAVR.Death or reintervention for aortic valve structural indications, measured using aortic valve mean gradient, effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and evidence of hemodynamic deterioration by reintervention, adverse hemodynamics, or transvalvular regurgitation.Of 2795 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 84.5 (7.1) years, and 1313 (47.0%) were female. Population hemodynamic trends derived from nonlinear mixed-effects models showed small early favorable changes in the first few months post-TAVR, with a decrease of -2.9 mm Hg in aortic valve mean gradient, an increase of 0.028 in Doppler velocity index, and an increase of 0.09 cm2 in effective orifice area. There was relative stability at a median follow-up of 3.1 (maximum, 5) years. Moderate/severe transvalvular regurgitation was noted in 89 patients (3.7%) after TAVR and increased over time. Patients with SAVR showed no significant changes. In TAVR, death/reintervention was associated with lower ejection fraction, stroke volume index, and aortic valve mean gradient up to 3 years, with no association with Doppler velocity index or valve area. Reintervention occurred in 20 patients (0.8%) after TAVR and in 1 (0.3%) after SAVR and became less frequent over time. Reintervention was caused by structural deterioration of transcatheter heart valves in only 5 patients. Severely abnormal hemodynamics on echocardiograms were also infrequent and not associated with excess death or reintervention for either TAVR or SAVR.This large, core laboratory-based study of transcatheter heart valves revealed excellent durability of the transcatheter heart valves and SAVR. Abnormal findings in individual patients, suggestive of valve thrombosis or structural deterioration, were rare in this protocol-driven database and require further investigation.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00530894.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28973520\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute type A aortic dissection (AcA-AoD) is a surgical emergency associated with very high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the early outcome of emergency surgical repair has not improved substantially over the last 20 years. Many of the same debates occur repeatedly regarding operative extent and optimal conduct of the operation. The question remains: are patients suffering from too large an operation or too small? The pendulum favoring routine aortic valve resuspension, when feasible, has swung towards frequent aortic root replacement. This already aggressive approach is now being challenged with the even more extensive valve-sparing aortic root replacement (V-SARR) in selected patients. Distally, open replacement of most of the transverse arch is best in most patients. The need for late aortic re-intervention has not been shown to be affected by more extensive distal operative procedures, but the contemporary enthusiasm for a distal frozen elephant trunk (FET) only seems to build. It must be remembered that the first and foremost goal of the operation is to have an operative survivor; additional measures to reduce late morbidity are secondary aspirations. With increasing experience, true contraindications to emergency surgical operation have dwindled, but patients with advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and major neurological deficits do not fare well. The endovascular revolution, moreover, has spawned innovative options for modern practice, including ascending stent graft and adaptations of the old flap fenestration technique. Despite the increasingly complex operations and ever expanding therapies, this life-threatening disease remains a stubborn challenge for all cardiovascular surgeons. Development of specialized thoracic aortic teams and regionalization of care for patients with AcA-AoD offers the most promise to improve overall results.\n\nView details for DOI 10.21037/acs.2016.05.05\n\nView details for PubMedID 27563541\n\nAbstract\n\nBased on the early results of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an accepted treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable for surgery. However, little information is available about the late clinical outcomes in such patients.We did this randomised controlled trial at 21 experienced valve centres in Canada, Germany, and the USA. We enrolled patients with severe symptomatic inoperable aortic stenosis and randomly assigned (1:1) them to transfemoral TAVR or to standard treatment, which often included balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Patients and their treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The randomisation was done centrally, and sites learned of the assignment only after a patient had been screened, consented, and entered into the database. The primary outcome of the trial was all-cause mortality at 1 year in the intention-to-treat population, here we present the prespecified findings after 5 years. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00530894.We screened 3015 patients, of whom 358 were enrolled (mean age 83 years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality 11·7%, 54% female). 179 were assigned to TAVR treatment and 179 were assigned to standard treatment. 20 patients crossed over from the standard treatment group and ten withdrew from study, leaving only six patients at 5 years, of whom five had aortic valve replacement treatment outside of the study. The risk of all-cause mortality at 5 years was 71·8% in the TAVR group versus 93·6% in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio 0·50, 95% CI 0·39-0·65; p<0·0001). At 5 years, 42 (86%) of 49 survivors in the TAVR group had New York Heart Association class 1 or 2 symptoms compared with three (60%) of five in the standard treatment group. Echocardiography after TAVR showed durable haemodynamic benefit (aortic valve area 1·52 cm(2) at 5 years, mean gradient 10·6 mm Hg at 5 years), with no evidence of structural valve deterioration.TAVR is more beneficial than standard treatment for treatment of inoperable aortic stenosis. TAVR should be strongly considered for patients who are not surgical candidates for aortic valve replacement to improve their survival and functional status. Appropriate selection of patients will help to maximise the benefit of TAVR and reduce mortality from severe comorbidities.Edwards Lifesciences.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60290-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 25788231\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial showed that mortality at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years is much the same with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. We report here the 5-year outcomes.We did this randomised controlled trial at 25 hospitals, in Canada (two), Germany (one), and the USA (23). We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly assign high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to either SAVR or TAVR with a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial tissue valve by either a transfemoral or transapical approach. Patients and their treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome of the trial was all-cause mortality in the intention-to-treat population at 1 year, we present here predefined outcomes at 5 years. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00530894.We screened 3105 patients, of whom 699 were enrolled (348 assigned to TAVR, 351 assigned to SAVR). Overall mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score was 11·7%. At 5 years, risk of death was 67·8% in the TAVR group compared with 62·4% in the SAVR group (hazard ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·86-1·24; p=0·76). We recorded no structural valve deterioration requiring surgical valve replacement in either group. Moderate or severe aortic regurgitation occurred in 40 (14%) of 280 patients in the TAVR group and two (1%) of 228 in the SAVR group (p<0·0001), and was associated with increased 5-year risk of mortality in the TAVR group (72·4% for moderate or severe aortic regurgitation vs 56·6% for those with mild aortic regurgitation or less; p=0·003).Our findings show that TAVR as an alternative to surgery for patients with high surgical risk results in similar clinical outcomes.Edwards Lifesciences.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60308-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 25788234\n\nAbstract\n\nA 180/180° configuration has been reported to increase repair durability after valve-sparing aortic root replacement (V-SARR) for bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease. We studied the impact of commissural angular configuration (CAC) and of BAV type on valve performance after V-SARR.A total of 85 BAV patients (68 males, age 44 ± 11 years) underwent Tirone David-V V-SARR between 1997 and 2013. BAV type was documented intraoperatively, and CAC determined from pre- and postoperative computed tomography scans as the angle subtended by the non-fused cusp. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed at 6 ± 3 days and at 2.9 ± 2.1 years. Functional end-points included freedom from aortic regurgitation (AR) 1+, AR 2+ and freedom from AR progression (0 to 1+, or 1+ to 2+). Tested variables included preoperative CAC (>160 vs <160°) and changes in CAC after V-SARR (Δ > 30° vs Δ < 30°) and Sievers' BAV type (SØ or S1).CAC in SØ-BAV (n = 26) changed minimally from 164 ± 12 to 171 ± 11° (mean Δ = 7.2 ± 16°, P = 0.044), whereas in S1-BAV (n = 59) CAC changed substantially from 132 ± 19 to 156 ± 18° (mean Δ = 27 ± 21°, P < 0.001). Larger postoperative CAC angles were not linked to better mid-term valve performance, but Sievers' BAV type had a major effect on valve performance: mild AR in S1/i BAV progressed more often (76 vs 32% at 4 years, P = 0.017) and 1+ AR was more frequent (70 vs 36% at 4 years, P = 0.008) compared with SØ-BAV.BAV type, including number of raphes, sinuses and commissures (SØ superior to S1) but not commissure geometry within the neoroot alone, appears to be linked to functional outcomes after V-SARR for BAV.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/icvts/ivu123\n\nView details for PubMedID 24903440\n\nAbstract\n\nTo compare the 1-year results after aortic valve-sparing (AVS) or valve-replacing (AVR) aortic root replacement from a prospective, international registry of 316 patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS).Patients underwent AVS (n = 239, 76%) or AVR (n = 77, 24%) aortic root replacement at 19 participating centers from 2005 to 2010. One-year follow-up data were complete for 312 patients (99%), with imaging findings available for 293 (94%). The time-to-events were compared between groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.Two patients (0.6%)--1 in each group--died within 30 days. No significant differences were found in early major adverse valve-related events (MAVRE; P = .6). Two AVS patients required early reoperation for coronary artery complications. The 1-year survival rates were similar in the AVR (97%) and AVS (98%) groups; the procedure type was not significantly associated with any valve-related events. At 1 year and beyond, aortic regurgitation of at least moderate severity (≥2+) was present in 16 patients in the AVS group (7%) but in no patients in the AVR group (P = .02). One AVS patient required late AVR.AVS aortic root replacement was not associated with greater 30-day mortality or morbidity rates than AVR root replacement. At 1 year, no differences were found in survival, valve-related morbidity, or MAVRE between the AVS and AVR groups. Of concern, 7% of AVS patients developed grade ≥2+ aortic regurgitation, emphasizing the importance of 5 to 10 years of follow-up to learn the long-term durability of AVS versus AVR root replacement in patients with MFS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.02.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 24655904\n\nAbstract\n\nThe study objective was to determine whether recurrent or residual mild aortic regurgitation, which occurs after valve-sparing aortic root replacement, progresses over time.Between 2003 and 2008, 154 patients underwent Tirone David-V valve-sparing aortic root replacement; 96 patients (62%) had both 1-year (median, 12 ± 4 months) and mid-term (62 ± 22 months) transthoracic echocardiograms available for analysis. Age of patients averaged 38 ± 13 years, 71% were male, 31% had a bicuspid aortic valve, 41% had Marfan syndrome, and 51% underwent aortic valve repair, predominantly cusp free margin shortening.Forty-one patients (43%) had mild aortic regurgitation on 1-year echocardiogram. In 85% of patients (n = 35), mild aortic regurgitation remained stable on the most recent echocardiogram (median, 57 ± 20 months); progression to moderate aortic regurgitation occurred in 5 patients (12%) at a median of 28 ± 18 months and remained stable thereafter; severe aortic regurgitation developed in 1 patient, eventually requiring reoperation. Five patients (5%) had moderate aortic regurgitation at 1 year, which did not progress subsequently. Two patients (2%) had more than moderate aortic regurgitation at 1 year, and both ultimately required reoperation.Although mild aortic regurgitation occurs frequently after valve-sparing aortic root replacement, it is unlikely to progress over the next 5 years and should not be interpreted as failure of the valve-preservation concept. Further, we suggest that mild aortic regurgitation should not be considered nonstructural valve dysfunction, as the 2008 valve reporting guidelines would indicate. We need 10- to 15-year follow-up to learn the long-term clinical consequences of mild aortic regurgitation early after valve-sparing aortic root replacement.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.09.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 24176278\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Over the past two decades elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement (V-SARR) has become more common in the treatment of patients with aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysms. Currently there are little data available to predict complications in the post-operative population. The study goal was to determine if altered flow patterns in the thoracic aorta, as measured by MRI, are associated with complications after V-SARR. METHODS: Time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast MRI (4D flow) was used to image 12 patients with Marfan syndrome after V-SARR. The patients were followed up for an average of 5.8years after imaging and 8.2years after surgery. Additionally 5 volunteers were imaged for comparison. Flow profiles were visualized during peak systole using streamlines. Wall shear stress estimates and normalized flow displacement were evaluated at multiple planes in the thoracic aorta. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, a single patient developed a Stanford Type B aortic dissection. At initial imaging, prior to the development of the dissection, the patient had altered flow patterns, wall shear stress estimates, and increased normalized flow displacement in the thoracic aorta in comparison to the remaining V-SARR patients and volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first follow-up study of patients after 4D flow imaging. An aortic dissection developed in one patient with altered flow patterns and hemodynamic stresses in the thoracic aorta. These results suggest that flow and altered hemodynamics may play a role in the development of post-operative intramural hematomas and dissections.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2013.04.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 23706513\n\nAbstract\n\nThe prognosis and treatment of patients with low-flow (LF) severe aortic stenosis are controversial.The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial randomized patients with severe aortic stenosis to medical management versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR; inoperable cohort) and surgical aortic valve replacement versus TAVR (high-risk cohort). Among 971 patients with evaluable echocardiograms (92%), LF (stroke volume index ≤35 mL/m(2)) was observed in 530 (55%); LF and low ejection fraction (<50%) in 225 (23%); and LF, low ejection fraction, and low mean gradient (<40 mm Hg) in 147 (15%). Two-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with LF compared with those with normal stroke volume index (47% versus 34%; hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.89; P=0.006). In the inoperable cohort, patients with LF had higher mortality than those with normal flow, but both groups improved with TAVR (46% versus 76% with LF and 38% versus 53% with normal flow; P<0.001). In the high-risk cohort, there was no difference between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement. In patients with paradoxical LF and low gradient (preserved ejection fraction), TAVR reduced 1-year mortality from 66% to 35% (hazard ratio, 0.38; P=0.02). LF was an independent predictor of mortality in all patient cohorts (hazard ratio, ≈1.5), whereas ejection fraction and gradient were not.LF is common in severe aortic stenosis and independently predicts mortality. Survival is improved with TAVR compared with medical management and similar with TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement. A measure of flow (stroke volume index) should be included in the evaluation and therapeutic decision making of patients with severe aortic stenosis.URL: http://www.clinicaltrial.gov.

We analyzed the results of 75 patients with a BAV undergoing Tirone David reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement.Average age was 45 ± 10 years; 80% were male; 31% had 2+ or greater aortic regurgitation (AR); annular diameter averaged 28 ± 3 mm; 32% had a Sievers' type 0 BAV, and 66% underwent concomitant cusp repair (usually cusp free margin shortening) to correct prolapse. Early (6 ± 3 days) and late (2.9 ± 1.7, 1-10 years) postoperative echocardiographic results were compared (cumulative echocardiographic follow-up, 190 patient-years; median late interval, 2 years [interquartile range, 0.68, 4.2]). Seven patients remained at risk beyond 6 years. Clinical outcome and valve function were analyzed using log-rank calculations.Actuarial survival was 99% ± 2%; freedom from reoperation was 90% ± 5%, infection 98% ± 2%, and stroke 100% at 6 years. After initial improvement in degree of AR (P < .001), minor subclinical progression of AR was observed (P > .5); however, freedom from AR of more than 2+ was 100%. Cusp free margin shortening was not associated with valve deterioration, but commissural suspensory polytetrafluoroethylene neochord creation (n = 4) portended a higher probability of recurrent AR (P = .025).After David procedure and cusp repair in patients with a BAV, midterm clinical and valve function outcomes were favorable out to 6 years. More follow-up is required to determine long-term valve durability and the hazard of other clinically important late adverse events, including eventual reoperation, to beyond 10 years.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.11.043\n\nView details for PubMedID 23260433\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough implicitly accepted by many that the durability of valve-sparing aortic root replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease and connective tissue disorders will be inferior, this hypothesis has not been rigorously investigated.From 1993 to 2009, 233 patients (27% bicuspid aortic valve, 40% Marfan syndrome) underwent Tirone David valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Follow-up averaged 4.7 ± 3.3 years (1102 patient-years). Freedom from adverse outcomes was determined using log-rank calculations.Survival at 5 and 10 years was 98.7% ± 0.7% and 93.5% ± 5.1%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation (all causes) on the aortic root was 92.2% ± 3.6% at 10 years; 3 reoperations were aortic valve replacement owing to structural valve deterioration. Freedom from structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 96.1% ± 2.1%. No significant differences were found in survival (P = .805, P = .793, respectively), reoperation (P = .179, P = .973, respectively), structural valve deterioration (P = .639, P = .982, respectively), or any other functional or clinical endpoints when patients were stratified by valve type (tricuspid aortic valve vs bicuspid aortic valve) or associated connective tissue disorder. At the latest echocardiographic follow-up (95% complete), 202 patients (94.8%) had none or trace aortic regurgitation, 10 (4.7%) mild, 0 had moderate to severe, and 1 (0.5%) had severe aortic regurgitation. Freedom from greater than 2+ aortic regurgitation at 10 years was 95.3% ± 2.5%. Six patients sustained acute type B aortic dissection (freedom at 10 years, 90.4% ± 5.0%).Tirone David reimplantation valve-sparing aortic root replacement in carefully selected young patients was associated with excellent clinical and echocardiographic outcome in patients with either a tricuspid aortic valve or bicuspid aortic valve. No demonstrable adverse influence was found for Marfan syndrome or connective tissue disorder on durability, clinical outcome, or echocardiographic results.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.09.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 23083792\n\nAbstract\n\nAll neurologic events in the PARTNER randomized trial comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) were analyzed.High-risk patients with aortic stenosis were stratified into transfemoral (TF, n = 461) or transapical (TA, n = 196) strata based on their arterial anatomy and randomized: 657 received treatment assigned (\"as treated\"), 313 underwent AVR, and 344 TAVR. Neurologic events were prospectively adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee. Multivariable, multiphase hazard analysis elucidated factors associated with increased likelihood of neurologic events.Forty-nine neurologic events (15 transient ischemic attacks, 34 strokes) occurred in 47 patients (TAVR, n = 31; AVR, n = 16). An early peaking high hazard phase occurred within the first week, which declined to a constant late hazard phase out to 2 years. The risk in the early phase was higher after TAVR than AVR, and in the TAVR arm in patients with a smaller aortic valve area index. In the late risk phase, the likelihood of neurologic event was linked to patient-related factors in both arms (\"non-TF candidate,\" history of recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, and advanced functional disability), but not by treatment (TAVR vs AVR) or any intraprocedural variables. The likelihood of sustaining a neurologic event was lowest in the AVR subgroup in the TF stratum during all available follow-up.After either treatment, there were 2 distinct hazard phases for neurologic events that were driven by different risk factors. Neurologic complications occurred more frequently after TAVR than AVR early, but thereafter the risk was influenced by patient- and disease-related factors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.01.055\n\nView details for PubMedID 22424519\n\nAbstract\n\nThe use of transcatheter aortic-valve replacement has been shown to reduce mortality among high-risk patients with aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgical replacement. However, the two procedures have not been compared in a randomized trial involving high-risk patients who are still candidates for surgical replacement.At 25 centers, we randomly assigned 699 high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to undergo either transcatheter aortic-valve replacement with a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial valve (either a transfemoral or a transapical approach) or surgical replacement. The primary end point was death from any cause at 1 year. The primary hypothesis was that transcatheter replacement is not inferior to surgical replacement.The rates of death from any cause were 3.4% in the transcatheter group and 6.5% in the surgical group at 30 days (P=0.07) and 24.2% and 26.8%, respectively, at 1 year (P=0.44), a reduction of 2.6 percentage points in the transcatheter group (upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 3.0 percentage points; predefined margin, 7.5 percentage points; P=0.001 for noninferiority). The rates of major stroke were 3.8% in the transcatheter group and 2.1% in the surgical group at 30 days (P=0.20) and 5.1% and 2.4%, respectively, at 1 year (P=0.07). At 30 days, major vascular complications were significantly more frequent with transcatheter replacement (11.0% vs. 3.2%, P<0.001); adverse events that were more frequent after surgical replacement included major bleeding (9.3% vs. 19.5%, P<0.001) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (8.6% vs. 16.0%, P=0.006). More patients undergoing transcatheter replacement had an improvement in symptoms at 30 days, but by 1 year, there was not a significant between-group difference.In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, transcatheter and surgical procedures for aortic-valve replacement were associated with similar rates of survival at 1 year, although there were important differences in periprocedural risks.

The main focus of this report is primarily on the acute cohort.Clinical data were systematically collected from five physician-sponsored investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical trials between 2000 and 2008 using standardized definitions and forms. Adverse events were reported early (≤30 days) and late (>30 days) by body system. Major adverse events included death, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory failure, paralysis, and bowel ischemia.There were 99 cTBAoD patients: 85 were acute, 11 were subacute, and 3 were chronic. Among the acute patients, 31.8% had rupture and 71.8% had malperfusion, including 55.7% lower extremity, 36.1% renal, 19.7% visceral, 8.2% other, and 3.3% spinal cord (patients may have more than one source). Rupture and malperfusion were both reported for three acute patients. Additional findings for the acute cohort included pain (76.5%), hypertension (43.5%), and bleeding (8.2%); comorbidities included hypertension (83.5%), current/past smoking history (69.8%), and diabetes (12.9%). The main focus of this analysis was the acute cohort (n = 85). Age averaged 59 years (72.9% male). Early adverse events included pulmonary (36.5%), vascular (28.2%), renal (25.9%), and neurologic (23.5%). Early major adverse events occurred in 37.6% of patients, including death (10.6%), stroke (9.4%), renal failure (9.4%), and paralysis (9.4%); late adverse events included vascular (15.8%), cardiac (10.5%), gastrointestinal (6.6%), and hemorrhage (5.3%). The point-estimate mortality rate was 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-17.5) at 30 days and 29.4 (95% CI, 18.4-40.4) at 1 year, when 34 patients remained at risk.Emergency TEVAR for patients with cTBAoD (malperfusion or rupture) provided acceptable mortality and morbidity results out to 1 year. Manufacturers can use this 30-day mortality point-estimate of 10.8 (95% CI, 4.1-17.5) for the acute cohort to establish a performance goal for use in single-arm commercial IDE trials if the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory bodies concur.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2010.11.124\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000289012600028\n\nView details for PubMedID 21334174\n\nAbstract\n\nMany patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting conditions are not candidates for surgical replacement of the aortic valve. Recently, transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) has been suggested as a less invasive treatment for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis.We randomly assigned patients with severe aortic stenosis, whom surgeons considered not to be suitable candidates for surgery, to standard therapy (including balloon aortic valvuloplasty) or transfemoral transcatheter implantation of a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial valve. The primary end point was the rate of death from any cause.A total of 358 patients with aortic stenosis who were not considered to be suitable candidates for surgery underwent randomization at 21 centers (17 in the United States). At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause (Kaplan–Meier analysis) was 30.7% with TAVI, as compared with 50.7% with standard therapy (hazard ratio with TAVI, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.74; P<0.001). The rate of the composite end point of death from any cause or repeat hospitalization was 42.5% with TAVI as compared with 71.6% with standard therapy (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.59; P<0.001). Among survivors at 1 year, the rate of cardiac symptoms (New York Heart Association class III or IV) was lower among patients who had undergone TAVI than among those who had received standard therapy (25.2% vs. 58.0%, P<0.001). At 30 days, TAVI, as compared with standard therapy, was associated with a higher incidence of major strokes (5.0% vs. 1.1%, P=0.06) and major vascular complications (16.2% vs. 1.1%, P<0.001). In the year after TAVI, there was no deterioration in the functioning of the bioprosthetic valve, as assessed by evidence of stenosis or regurgitation on an echocardiogram.In patients with severe aortic stenosis who were not suitable candidates for surgery, TAVI, as compared with standard therapy, significantly reduced the rates of death from any cause, the composite end point of death from any cause or repeat hospitalization, and cardiac symptoms, despite the higher incidence of major strokes and major vascular events.

In order to test the extent to which actual fiber angle distributions conform to this prediction, we measured local myofiber angles at an average of nine transmural depths in each of 32 sites (4 short-axis levels, 8 circumferentially distributed blocks in each level) in five normal ovine LVs. We found: (1) a mean midwall myofiber angle of -7 degrees (SD 9), but with spatial heterogeneity (averaging 0 degrees in the posterolateral and anterolateral wall near the papillary muscles, and -9 degrees in all other regions); and (2) an average transmural gradient of 93 degrees (SD 21), but with spatial heterogeneity (averaging a low of 51 degrees in the basal posterior sector and a high of 130 degrees in the mid-equatorial anterolateral sector). We conclude that midwall myofiber angles and transmural myofiber angle gradients in the ovine heart are regionally non-uniform and differ significantly from the predictions of present-day computationally optimized LV myofiber models. Myofiber geometry in the ovine heart may differ from other species, but model assumptions also underlie the discrepancy between experimental and computational results. To test the predictive capability of the current computational model would we propose using an ovine specific LV geometry and comparing the computed myofiber orientations to those we report herein.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.08.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 18805536\n\nAbstract\n\nMyocardial fibers are grouped into lamina (or sheets) 3 to 4 cells thick. Fiber shortening produces systolic left ventricular (LV) wall thickening primarily by laminar extension, thickening, and shear, but the regional variability and transmural distribution of these 3 mechanisms are incompletely understood.Nine sheep had transmural radiopaque markers inserted into the anterior basal and lateral equatorial LV. Four-dimensional marker dynamics were studied with biplane videofluoroscopy to measure circumferential, longitudinal, and radial systolic strains in the epicardium, midwall, and endocardium. Fiber and sheet angles from quantitative histology allowed transformation of these strains into transmural contributions of sheet extension, thickening, and shear to systolic wall thickening. At all depths, systolic wall thickening in the anterior basal region was 1.6 to 1.9 times that in the lateral equatorial region. Interestingly, however, systolic fiber shortening was identical at each transmural depth in these regions. Endocardial anterior basal sheet thickening was >2 times greater than in the lateral equatorial region (epicardium, 0.16+/-0.15 versus 0.03+/-0.06; endocardium, 0.45+/-0.40 versus 0.17+/-0.09). Midwall sheet extension was >2 times that in the lateral wall (0.22+/-0.12 versus 0.09+/-0.06). Epicardial and midwall sheet shears in the anterior wall were approximately 2 times higher than in the lateral wall (epicardium, 0.14+/-0.07 versus 0.05+/-0.03; midwall, 0.21+/-0.12 versus 0.12+/-0.06).These data demonstrate fundamentally different regional contributions of laminar mechanisms for amplifying fiber shortening to systolic wall thickening. Systolic fiber shortening was identical at each transmural depth in both the anterior and lateral LV sites. However, systolic wall thickening of the anterior site was much greater than that of the lateral site. Fiber shortening drives systolic wall thickening, but sheet dynamics and orientations are of great importance to systolic wall thickening. LV wall thickening and its clinical implications pivot on different wall thickening mechanisms in various LV regions. Attempts to implant healthy contractile cells into diseased hearts or to surgically manipulate LV geometry need to take into account not only cardiomyocyte contraction but also transmural LV intercellular architecture and geometry.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.744623\n\nView details for PubMedID 18663088\n\nAbstract\n\nBicuspid aortic valves are associated with a poorly characterized connective tissue disorder that predisposes to aortic catastrophes. Because no criterion exists dictating the appropriate extent of aortic resection in aneurysmal disease of the bicuspid aortic valve, we studied the patterns of aortic dilation in this population.Sixty-four patients with bicuspid aortic valves who underwent computed tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography and echocardiography were retrospectively identified between January 2002 and March 2006. Orthonormal 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional aortic diameters were measured at 10 levels. Agglomerative hierarchic clustering with centered correlation distance measurements and complete linkage analysis was used to detect distinct patterns of aortic dilatation.Mean aortic diameter was 28.1 +/- 0.7 mm at the annulus and 21.7 +/- 0.4 mm at the diaphragmatic hiatus. The aorta was largest in the tubular ascending aorta (45.9 +/- 1.0 mm). Compared with the descending aorta, the transverse aortic arch was also dilated (P < .01). Cluster analysis showed 4 patterns of aortic dilatation: cluster I, aortic root alone (n = 8, 13%); cluster II, tubular ascending aorta alone (n = 9, 14%); cluster III, tubular portion and transverse arch (n = 18, 28%); and, cluster IV, aortic root and tubular portion with tapering across the transverse arch (n = 29, 45%).Distinct patterns of aortic dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortic valves call for an individualized degree of aortic replacement to minimize late aortic complications and reoperation. Patients in clusters III and IV should have transverse arch replacement (plus concomitant root replacement in cluster IV). Patients in cluster I should undergo complete aortic root replacement, whereas in patients in cluster II supracommissural ascending aortic grafting is adequate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.01.022\n\nView details for PubMedID 18374778\n\nAbstract\n\nBetween 43,000 and 47,000 people die annually in the United States from diseases of the aorta and its branches and continues to increase. For the thoracic aorta, these diseases are increasingly treated by stent-grafting. No prospective randomized study exists comparing stent-grafting and open surgical treatment, including for disease subgroups. Currently, one stent-graft device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms although two new devices are expected to obtain FDA approval in 2008. Stent-graft devices are used \"off label\" or under physician Investigational Device Exemption studies for other indications such as traumatic rupture of the aorta and aortic dissection. Early first-generation devices suffered from problems such as stroke with insertion, ascending aortic dissection or aortic penetration from struts, vascular injury, graft collapse, endovascular leaks, graft material failure, continued aneurysm expansion or rupture, and migration or kinking; however, the newer iterations coming to market have been considerably improved. Although the devices have been tested in pulse duplicators out to 10 years, long-term durability is not known, particularly in young patients. The long-term consequences of repeated computed tomography scans for checking device integrity and positioning on the risk of irradiation-induced cancer remains of concern in young patients. This document (1) reviews the natural history of aortic disease, indications for repair, outcomes after conventional open surgery, currently available devices, and insights from outcomes of randomized studies using stent-grafts for abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, the latter having been treated for a longer time by stent-grafts; and (2) offers suggestions for treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.099\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000252451700001\n\nView details for PubMedID 18083364\n\nAbstract\n\nSince the fifteenth century beginning with Leonardo da Vinci's studies, the precise structure and functional dynamics of the aortic root throughout the cardiac cycle continues to elude investigators. The last five decades of experimental work have contributed substantially to our current understanding of aortic root dynamics. In this article, we review and summarize the relevant structural analyses, using radiopaque markers and sonomicrometric crystals, concerning aortic root three-dimensional deformations and describe aortic root dynamics in detail throughout the cardiac cycle. We then compare data between different studies and discuss the mechanisms responsible for the modes of aortic root deformation, including the haemodynamics, anatomical and temporal determinants of those deformations. These modes of aortic root deformation are closely coupled to maximize ejection, optimize transvalvular ejection haemodynamics and-perhaps most importantly-reduce stress on the aortic valve cusps by optimal diastolic load sharing and minimizing transvalvular turbulence throughout the cardiac cycle. This more comprehensive understanding of aortic root mechanics and physiology will contribute to improved medical and surgical treatment methods, enhanced therapeutic decision making and better post-intervention care of patients. With a better understanding of aortic root physiology, future research on aortic valve repair and replacement should take into account the integrated structural and functional asymmetry of aortic root dynamics to minimize stress on the aortic cusps in order to prevent premature structural valve deterioration.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1098/rstb.2007.2124\n\nView details for PubMedID 17594968\n\nAbstract\n\nLaminar, or sheet, architecture of the left ventricle (LV) is a structural basis for normal systolic and diastolic LV dynamics, but transmural sheet orientations remain incompletely characterized. We directly measured the transmural distribution of sheet angles in the ovine anterolateral LV wall. Ten Dorsett-hybrid sheep hearts were perfusion fixed in situ with 5% buffered glutaraldehyde at end diastole and stored in 10% formalin. Transmural blocks of myocardial tissue were excised, with the edges cut parallel to local circumferential, longitudinal, and radial axes, and sliced into 1-mm-thick sections parallel to the epicardial tangent plane from epicardium to endocardium. Mean fiber directions were determined in each section from five measurements of fiber angles. Each section was then cut transverse to the fiber direction, and five sheet angles (beta) were measured and averaged. Mean fiber angles progressed nearly linearly from -41 degrees (SD 11) at the epicardium to +42 degrees (SD 16) at the endocardium. Two families of sheets were identified at approximately +45 degrees (beta(+)) and -45 degrees (beta(-)). In the lateral region (n = 5), near the epicardium, sheets belonged to the beta(+) family; in the midwall, to the beta(-) family; and near the endocardium, to the beta(+) family. This pattern was reversed in the basal anterior region (n = 4). Sheets were uniformly beta(-) over the anterior papillary muscle (n = 2). These direct measurements of sheet angles reveal, for the first time, alternating transmural families of predominant sheet angles. This may have important implications in understanding wall mechanics in the normal and the failing heart.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1152/ajpherat.00813.2004\n\nView details for PubMedID 15550521\n\nAbstract\n\nFive years after reporting our initial stent-graft repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms experience, we determined the 5- to 10-year results of stent-graft treatment and identified risk factors for adverse late outcomes.Between 1992 and 1997, 103 patients (mean age 69 +/- 12 years) underwent repair using first-generation (custom-fabricated) stent grafts. Sixty-two patients (60%) were unsuitable candidates for conventional open surgical repair (\"inoperable\"). Follow-up was 100% complete (mean 4.5 +/- 2.5 years; maximum 10 years). Outcome variables included death and treatment failure (endoleak, aortic rupture, reintervention, and/or aortic-related or sudden death).Overall actuarial survival was 82% +/- 4%, 49% +/- 5%, and 27% +/- 6% at 1, 5, and 8 years. Survival in open surgical candidates was 93% +/- 4% and 78% +/- 6% and at 1 and 5 years compared with 74% +/- 6% and 31% +/- 6% in those deemed inoperable (P <.001). Independent risk factors for death were older age (hazard ratio = 1.1; P =.008), previous stroke (hazard ratio = 2.8; P =.003), and being designated an inoperable candidate (hazard ratio = 1.9; P =.04). Actuarial freedom from aortic reintervention and treatment failure at 8 years was 70% +/- 6% and 39% +/- 8%, respectively. Earlier operative year (hazard ratio = 1.2; P =.07), larger distal landing zone diameter (hazard ratio = 1.1; P =.001), and transposition of the left subclavian artery (hazard ratio = 3.3; P =.008) were determinants of treatment failure.Survival after aneurysm repair using crude, first-generation stent grafts was satisfactory in good operative candidates but bleak in the inoperable cohort, raising the question of whether asymptomatic patients should have even been treated. Late aortic complications were detected in many patients, reemphasizing the importance of serial imaging surveillance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.10.047\n\nView details for PubMedID 15001894\n\nAbstract\n\nRing annuloplasty, the current treatment of choice for chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation, abolishes dynamic annular motion and immobilizes the posterior leaflet. In a model of chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation, we tested septal-lateral annular cinching aimed at maintaining normal annular and leaflet dynamics.Twenty-five sheep had radiopaque markers placed on the mitral annulus and anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. A transannular suture was anchored to the midseptal mitral annulus and externalized through the midlateral mitral annulus. After 7 days, biplane cinefluoroscopy provided 3-dimensional marker data (baseline) prior to creating inferior myocardial infarction by snare occlusion of obtuse marginal branches. After 7 weeks, the 9 animals that developed chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation were restudied before and after septal-lateral annular cinching. Anterior and posterior mitral leaflet angular excursion and annular septal-lateral and commissure-commissure dimensions and percent shortening were computed.Septal-lateral annular cinching reduced septal-lateral dimension (baseline: 3.0 +/- 0.2; chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation: 3.5 +/- 0.4 [P <.05 vs baseline by repeated measures analysis of variance and Dunnett's test]; septal-lateral annular cinching: 2.4 +/- 0.3 cm; maximum dimension) and eliminated chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (baseline: 0.6 +/- 0.5; chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation: 2.3 +/- 1.0 [P <.05 vs baseline by repeated measures analysis of variance and Dunnett's test]; septal-lateral annular cinching: 0.6 +/- 0.6; mitral regurgitation grade [0 to 4+]) but did not alter dynamic annular shortening (baseline: 7 +/- 3; chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation: 10 +/- 5; septal-lateral annular cinching: 6 +/- 2, percent septal-lateral shortening) or posterior mitral leaflet excursion (baseline: 46 degrees +/- 8 degrees; chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation: 41 degrees +/- 13 degrees; septal-lateral annular cinching: 46 degrees +/- 8 degrees ).In this model, septal-lateral annular cinching decreased chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation, reduced annular septal-lateral diameter (but not commissure-commissure diameter), and maintained normal annular and leaflet dynamics. These findings provide additional insight into the treatment of chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.09.036\n\nView details for PubMedID 15001893\n\nAbstract\n\nTo clarify the merits of various surgical approaches, we studied the outcome after composite valve graft versus separate valve and graft replacement versus conservative valve treatment with replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with acute type A aortic dissection complicated by aortic regurgitation.Between 1967 and 1999, 123 patients (mean age 56 +/- 15 years) underwent composite valve graft replacement (n = 21), separate valve and graft replacement (n = 20), or conservative valve treatment (n = 82 [commissural resuspension in 46]); follow-up averaged 6.5 years (95% complete).The 30-day, 1-year, and 6-year survival estimates of 85% +/- 4%, 79% +/- 5%, and 69% +/- 5% (+/-1 standard error of mean), respectively, after conservative valve treatment were similar to 86% +/- 8%, 81% +/- 9%, and 65% +/- 16%, respectively, with composite valve graft replacement and better (but insignificantly so) than 70% +/- 10%, 70% +/- 10%, and 45% +/- 11%, respectively, with separate valve and graft replacement. The 6-year freedom from proximal reoperation was 95% +/- 3%, 89% +/- 10%, and 100% in conservative valve graft, separate valve and graft, and composite valve graft subgroups, respectively (P = not significant). Cox regression multivariable analysis identified that previous sternotomy (hazard ratio [or e(beta)] 95% confidence interval 1.4-10.9, P =.006), hypertension (0.99-2.9, P =.05), cardiac tamponade (1.1-4.0, P =.03), and stroke (1.7-7.0, P =.001) increased the hazard of death. No factors predicting a higher likelihood of late proximal reoperation were identified.In patients with acute type A aortic dissection and aortic regurgitation, there was no significant difference in overall survival or reoperation rates among these surgical approaches. We try to save the valve whenever possible unless the aortic root is pathologically dilated (eg, Marfan syndrome or annuloaortic ectasia) or destroyed by the dissection process, when composite valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement is indicated.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0022-5223(03)01279-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 14688716\n\nAbstract\n\nThe optimal treatment of patients with acute type B dissections continues to be debated.A 36-year clinical experience of medical and surgical treatments in 189 patients was retrospectively analyzed (multivariable Cox proportional hazards model) with respect to three outcome end points: all deaths, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from late aortic complications or death. Propensity score analysis identified 2 quintiles (quintiles I and II, consisting of 142 comparable patients) for further comparison of the effects of surgical versus medical treatment.Shock (hazard ratio 14.5, 95% confidence interval 4.7-44.5, P <.001) and visceral ischemia (hazard ratio 10.9, 95% confidence interval 3.9-30.3, P <.001) largely predominated as determinants of death, along with 6 other risk factors (arch involvement, rupture, stroke, previous sternotomy, and coronary or lung disease), which roughly doubled the hazard of death. Female sex was a significant but weaker predictor of death. Renal dysfunction, year of presentation, age, and mode of therapy (medical vs surgical) had no important bearing on overall survival. The actuarial survival estimates for all patients were 71%, 60%, 35%, and 17% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, and were similar for the medical and surgical patients. Reoperation and late aortic complications were predicted by the presence of Marfan syndrome. For the propensity-matched patients in quintiles I and II, survival, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from aortic complications were almost identical in the medically treated and surgical subsets.The prognosis for patients with acute type B aortic dissection is bleak and determined primarily by dissection-related and patient-specific risk factors, which do not appear to be readily modifiable.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1067/mtc.2002.123131\n\nView details for PubMedID 12407372\n\nAbstract\n\nNo evidence exists that profound hypothermic circulatory arrest (PHCA) improves survival or reduces the likelihood of distal aortic reoperation in patients with acute type A aortic dissection.Records of 307 patients with acute type A aortic dissection from 1967 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. The influence of repair using PHCA (n=121) versus without PHCA (n=186) on death and freedom from distal aortic reoperation was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression models. Propensity score analysis identified a subset of 152 comparable patients in 3 quintiles (QIII-V) in which the effects of PHCA (n=113) versus no PHCA (n=39) were further compared.For all patients, 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival estimates were 81+/-2%, 74+/-3%, and 63+/-3% (+/-1 SE). Survival rates and actual freedom from distal aortic reoperation was not significantly different between treatment methods in the entire patient cohort nor in the matched patients in quintiles III-V. Treatment method was not associated with differences in early major complications, late survival, or distal aortic reoperation rates in the entire patient sample or in quintiles III-V.Aortic repair with or without circulatory arrest was associated with comparable early complications, survival, and distal aortic reoperation rates in patients with acute type A aortic dissection. Despite the lack of concrete evidence favoring the use of PHCA, it does no harm, and most of our group uses PHCA regularly because of its practical technical advantages and theoretical potential merit.\n\nView details for PubMedID 12354737\n\nAbstract\n\nAdvances in imaging techniques have increased the recognition of aortic intramural hematomas (IMHs) and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAUs); however, distinction between IMH and PAU remains unclear. We intended to clarify differences between IMH coexisting with PAU and IMH not associated with PAU by comparisons of clinical features, imaging findings, and patient outcome to derive the optimal therapeutic approach.We performed a retrospective analysis of 65 symptomatic patients with aortic IMH. There were 34 patients with IMH associated with PAU (group 1) and 31 patients with IMH unaccompanied by PAU (group 2). Involvement of the ascending aorta (type A) was more frequent in group 2 (8 of 31, 26%), whereas most of the patients in group 1 had exclusive involvement of the descending aorta (type B) (31of 34, 91%). Patients were subdivided into 2 categories, those with clinical progression and those with stable disease. Forty-eight percent of patients in group 1 and 8% in group 2 were in the progressive category (P=0.002). Clinical and radiological findings were compared between those group 1 patients who had a progressive disease course (n=12) and those who were stable (n=13). Sustained or recurrent pain (P<0.0001), increasing pleural effusion (P=0.0003), and both the maximum diameter (P=0.004) and maximum depth (P=0.003) of the PAU were reliable predictors of disease progression.This study suggests a difference in disease behavior that argues for the prognostic importance of making a clear distinction between IMH caused by PAU and IMH not associated with PAU. IMH with PAU was significantly associated with a progressive disease course, whereas IMH without PAU typically had a stable course, especially when limited to the descending thoracic aorta.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000022164.26075.5A\n\nView details for PubMedID 12119251\n\nAbstract\n\nRing annuloplasty prevents acute ischemic mitral regurgitation in sheep, but it also abolishes normal mitral annular and posterior leaflet dynamics. We investigated a novel surgical approach of simple septal-lateral annular cinching with sutures to treat acute ischemic mitral regurgitation.Nine adult sheep underwent implantation of multiple radiopaque markers on the left ventricle, mitral anulus, and mitral leaflets. A septal-lateral transannular suture was anchored to the midseptal mitral anulus and externalized to a tourniquet through the midlateral mitral anulus and left ventricular wall. Open-chest animals were studied immediately postoperatively. Acute ischemic mitral regurgitation was induced by means of proximal left circumflex artery snare occlusion, and 3 progressive steps of septal-lateral annular cinching (each 2-3 mm suture tightening for 5 seconds) were performed with the transannular suture. Biplane videofluoroscopy for 3-dimensional marker coordinates and transesophageal echocardiography were performed continuously before and during left circumflex ischemia and septal-lateral annular cinching.Acute left circumflex ischemia caused ischemic mitral regurgitation (+0.5 +/- 0.4 [baseline] vs +2.0 +/- 0.7 [ischemia]; P =.005; scale, +0-4), which decreased progressively with each step of septal-lateral annular cinching and was eliminated during the third step (ischemic mitral regurgitation, +0.6 +/- 0.5; P = not significant vs baseline). The third step of septal-lateral annular cinching decreased the septal-lateral diameter by 6.0 +/- 2.6 mm (P =.005); however, mitral anulus area reduction (8.5% +/- 1.0% and 6.9% +/- 1.9% for ischemic mitral regurgitation and septal-lateral annular cinching step 3, respectively; P =.006) and posterior leaflet excursion (50 degrees +/- 9 degrees and 44 degrees +/- 11 degrees for regurgitation and annular cinching step 3, respectively; P =.002) throughout the cardiac cycle were affected only mildly. Normal mitral annular 3-dimensional shape was maintained with septal-lateral annular cinching.Isolated 22% +/- 10% reduction in mitral annular septal-lateral dimension abolished acute ischemic mitral regurgitation in normal sheep hearts while allowing near-normal mitral annular and posterior leaflet dynamic motion. Septal-lateral annular cinching may represent a simple method for the surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation, either as an adjunctive technique or alone, which helps preserve physiologic annular and leaflet function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1067/mtc.2002.122296\n\nView details for PubMedID 12019372\n\nAbstract\n\nLeft ventricular (LV) torsion reduces transmural fiber strain gradients during systole, and torsional recoil in early diastole is thought to assist LV filling. To test the hypothesis that deterioration of torsional dynamics accompanied LV dysfunction during the evolution of mitral regurgitation (MR), torsion was measured during the progression from acute to chronic MR in a canine model.Seven dogs underwent cardiopulmonary bypass for LV marker placement and creation of MR by disrupting the posterior leaflet. After 7-10 days, three-dimensional marker coordinates were measured with biplane videofluoroscopy to study LV geometry, size and function, plus maximal torsional deformation, time of maximal torsion relative to end-ejection, and early diastolic torsional recoil during the first 5% of filling. After three months, the animals were re-studied.Progression from acute to chronic MR was associated with a significant decrease in maximum LV dP/dt (1,574+/-213 to 1,300+/-252 mmHg/s, p <0.01) and an increase in LVEDP from 11+/-5 to 15+/-5 mmHg (p <0.01). After three months of MR, maximum torsional deformation decreased from 6.3+/-1.9 to 4.7+/-2.0 degrees (p = 0.04), as did early diastolic recoil (-3.8+/-1.0 to -1.5+/-1.7 degrees, p = 0.03).Progression from acute to chronic MR is accompanied by decreased and delayed systolic LV torsional deformation and a decline in early diastolic recoil, which may contribute to LV dysfunction by increasing transmural strain gradients during systole and impairing diastolic filling. As torsional deformation and recoil can be measured non-invasively with MRI in humans, such measurements might prove useful in patients with progressive MR as an adjunct to determine the timing of surgical repair.\n\nView details for PubMedID 11858164\n\nAbstract\n\nEdge-to-edge approximation of the mitral valve leaflets (Alfieri procedure) is a novel surgical treatment for patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). Long-term durability may be limited if abnormal mitral leaflet stresses result from this procedure. The aim of the current study was to measure Alfieri stitch tension (F(A)) and to explore its geometric determinants in an ovine model of acute IMR as a reflection of the mitral leaflet stresses imposed by the procedure.Eight sheep were studied immediately after surgical placement of (1) a force transducer interposed between sutures approximating the central leaflet edges and (2) radiopaque markers around the mitral annulus and leaflet edges. Computer-aided analysis of videofluorograms was used to obtained 3D marker coordinates. Simultaneous measurements of F(A), septal-lateral annular dimension (L(S-L)), leaflet edge separation (L(SEP)), anterior (L(AL)) and posterior (L(PL)) leaflet length, and hemodynamic variables were obtained at baseline (CTL) and during acute IMR (circumflex artery occlusion). F(A) was significantly elevated throughout the cardiac cycle during IMR compared with CTL, with maximum F(A) in diastole (0.26+/-0.05 versus 0.46+/-0.08 N, CTL versus IMR; P<0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed L(S-L) as the single independent predictor of maximum F(A) (P<0.001). Positive linear correlations were shown between values of F(A) and L(AL) and L(PL) (dependent variables).These experimental data demonstrate higher F(A) during IMR and cyclic changes in F(A) closely paralleling changes in L(S-L), eg, being greatest in diastole when the annulus is largest. Increased F(A) during IMR is probably indicative of successful therapeutic intent, but higher diastolic leaflet stresses resulting from persistent or progressive mitral annular dilatation may adversely affect repair durability. This indirectly implies that concomitant mitral ring annuloplasty should be added to the Alfieri repair.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000171201500007\n\nView details for PubMedID 11568026\n\nAbstract\n\nThe standard treatment for acute aortic dissection is either surgical or medical therapy, depending on the morphologic features of the lesion and any associated complications. Irrespective of the form of treatment, the associated mortality and morbidity are considerable.We studied the placement of endovascular stent-grafts across the primary entry tear for the management of acute aortic dissection originating in the descending thoracic aorta. We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transluminal stent-graft placement over the entry tear in 4 patients with acute type A aortic dissections (which involve the ascending aorta) and 15 patients with acute type B aortic dissections (which are confined to the descending aorta). Dissections involved aortic branches in 14 of the 19 patients (74 percent), and symptomatic compromise of multiple branch vessels was observed in 7 patients (37 percent). The stent-grafts were made of self-expanding stainless-steel covered with woven polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene material.Placement of endovascular stent-grafts across the primary entry tears was technically successful in all 19 patients. Complete thrombosis of the thoracic aortic false lumen was achieved in 15 patients (79 percent), and partial thrombosis was achieved in 4 (21 percent). Revascularization of ischemic branch vessels, with subsequent relief of corresponding symptoms, occurred in 76 percent of the obstructed branches. Three of the 19 patients died within 30 days, for an early mortality rate of 16 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 32 percent). There were no deaths and no instances of aneurysm or aortic rupture during the subsequent average follow-up period of 13 months.These initial results suggest that stent-graft coverage of the primary entry tear may be a promising new treatment for selected patients with acute aortic dissection. This technique requires further evaluation, however, to assess its therapeutic potential fully.\n\nView details for PubMedID 10332016\n\nAbstract\n\nReplacement of the aortic root with a prosthetic graft and valve in patients with Marfan's syndrome may prevent premature death from rupture of an aneurysm or aortic dissection. We reviewed the results of this surgical procedure at 10 experienced surgical centers.A total of 675 patients with Marfan's syndrome underwent replacement of the aortic root. Survival and morbidity-free survival curves were calculated, and risk factors were determined from a multivariable regression analysis.The 30-day mortality rate was 1.5 percent among the 455 patients who underwent elective repair, 2.6 percent among the 117 patients who underwent urgent repair (within 7 days after a surgical consultation), and 11.7 percent among the 103 patients who underwent emergency repair (within 24 hours after a surgical consultation). Of the 675 patients, 202 (30 percent) had aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta. Forty-six percent of the 158 adult patients with aortic dissection and a documented aortic diameter had an aneurysm with a diameter of 6.5 cm or less. There were 114 late deaths (more than 30 days after surgery); dissection or rupture of the residual aorta (22 patients) and arrhythmia (21 patients) were the principal causes of late death. The risk of death was greatest within the first 60 days after surgery, then rapidly decreased to a constant level by the end of the first year.Elective aortic-root replacement has a low operative mortality. In contrast, emergency repair, usually for acute aortic dissection, is associated with a much higher early mortality. Because nearly half the adult patients with aortic dissection had an aortic-root diameter of 6.5 cm or less at the time of operation, it may be prudent to undertake prophylactic repair of aortic aneurysms in patients with Marfan's syndrome when the diameter of the aorta is well below that size.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000080001700002\n\nView details for PubMedID 10219065\n\nAbstract\n\nOur goal was to determine whether endovascular stent-grafting is feasible and effective for patients with aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta.Starting in July 1992, we conducted a prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial in 103 patients (mean age 69 years [range 34-89 years]) who underwent endovascular treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta using a custom-fabricated, self-expanding stent-graft device. Follow-up was 100% complete and averaged 22 months. Sixty-two patients (60%) were judged not to be reasonable candidates for a conventional \"open\" surgical procedure.Complete thrombosis of the aneurysm was ultimately achieved in 86 (83%) patients. The early mortality rate was 9% +/- 3% (+/- 70% CL). Multivariable analysis revealed that myocardial infarction or stroke was linked with a higher likelihood of early death (P = .001). Early serious complications included paraplegia in 3% +/- 2% and stroke in 7% +/- 3%. Actuarial survival estimates at 1 year and 2 years were 81% +/- 4% and 73% +/- 5% (+/- 1 SE), respectively; being judged not to be a surgical candidate portended a higher probability of death (P = .003). According to the intent-to-treat principle, \"treatment failure\" (including all late sudden unexplained deaths) occurred in 38 patients; 53% +/- 10% of patients were free from treatment failure at 3.7 years. Stent-graft related complications occurred commonly and were linked with several anatomic, technical, and patient-related risk factors.This 5-year clinical trial involving use of a \"first generation\" device indicates that endovascular stent-grafting of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms is feasible with acceptable medium-term results. More refined, commercially developed devices available today offer less traumatic and more precise stent-graft deployment; these major technical advantages, coupled with important lessons we have learned over time and better patient selection, should be associated with more salutary clinical results in the future.\n\nView details for PubMedID 9806376\n\nAbstract\n\nThe usual treatment for thoracic aortic aneurysms is surgical replacement with a prosthetic graft, but the associated morbidity and mortality are considerable. We studied the use of transluminally placed endovascular stent-graft devices as an alternative to surgical repair.We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transluminally placed stent-graft to treat descending thoracic aortic aneurysms in 13 patients over a 24-month period. Atherosclerotic, anastomotic, and post-traumatic true or false aneurysms and aortic dissections were treated. The mean diameter of the aneurysms was 6.1 cm (range, 5 to 8). The endovascular stent-grafts were custom-designed for each patient and were constructed of self-expanding stainless-steel stents covered with woven Dacron grafts.Endovascular placement of the stent-graft prosthesis was successful in all patients. There was complete thrombosis of the thoracic aortic aneurysm surrounding the stent-graft in 12 patients, and partial thrombosis in 1. Two patients initially had small, residual patent proximal tracts into the aneurysm sac, but both tracts thrombosed within two months after the procedure. In four patients, two prostheses were required to bridge the aneurysm adequately. There have been no deaths or instances of paraplegia, stroke, distal embolization, or infection during an average follow-up of 11.6 months. One patient with an extensive chronic aortic dissection required open surgical graft replacement four months later because of progressive dilatation of the arch.These preliminary results demonstrate that endovascular stent-graft repair is safe in highly selected patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. This new method of treatment will, however, require careful long-term evaluation.\n\nView details for PubMedID 7984192\n\nAbstract\n\nThe importance of the intact mitral apparatus in left ventricular (LV) systolic performance has been indirectly suggested by clinical studies of chordal-preserving mitral valve replacement (MVR) or reconstruction. The importance of the intact mitral apparatus has been clearly demonstrated in isovolumic experimental preparations but has not been demonstrated unequivocally in ejecting hearts. Therefore, this question was assessed independently of load in an in situ, open-chest ejecting canine heart preparation (n = 9). Three orthogonal LV dimensions were measured by sonomicrometry. During MVR with complete chordal preservation, snares were placed around the anterior and posterior papillary muscles. After the hearts were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, LV function was assessed by caval occlusion to alter LV preload abruptly. The slopes of the end-systolic--pressure-volume (end-systolic elastance, Ees) and stroke-work--end-diastolic volume (preload-recruitable stroke work, PRSW) relations were used to measure global LV systolic function; similarly, the slopes of the end-systolic--pressure-dimension (regional end-systolic elastance, rEes) and stroke-work--end-diastolic dimension changes in regional LV systolic performance. All chordae were then divided by pulling the snares. Immediate reassessment revealed deterioration of global LV function: Ees declined by 72% (14.1 +/- 11.2 mm Hg/ml [mean +/- SD] vs. 3.9 +/- 3.5 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001), and PRSW declined by 39% (129 +/- 37 vs. 79 +/- 29 mm Hg, p = 0.0001). Regional LV function was also adversely affected but somewhat selectively: rEes decreased significantly in all three LV dimensions (p less than or equal to 0.03), but rPRSW decreased significantly (-21%) only in the anteroposterior minor LV axis (89 +/- 19 vs. 70 +/- 15 mm Hg, p = 0.005) and in the septal-lateral axis (-19%, p = NS). These data demonstrate the importance of the intact mitral apparatus on LV systolic performance in ejecting hearts, particularly in the LV regions subtended by the papillary muscles.\n\nView details for PubMedID 2766532\n\nAbstract\n\nIn animal models, severing the chordae tendineae of the mitral valve reduces the maximum global left ventricular elastance (Emax,g), a load-independent measure of left ventricular systolic performance; moreover, chamber geometry is altered with systolic bulging in the region of the papillary muscle insertions. This suggests that forces transmitted by the mitral apparatus increase the regional volume elastance (Emax,r) of segments subtending the insertions of the papillary muscles, and these regions contribute substantially to overall left ventricular systolic function (Emax,g). To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to evaluate changes in the magnitude and uniformity of Emax,r as quantitated by the slopes (E'max,i) of regional left ventricular isovolumetric pressure-dimension relations. Such measurements were obtained before and after all chordal attachments of the mitral valve were surgically divided in seven open-chest swine preparations. Significant declines in E'max,i were limited to the region of the posteromedial papillary muscle insertion. Although the mean E'max,i of all ventricular regions (E'max,ave) was unchanged, regional left ventricular elastances were less uniform after the mitral chordae tendineae were severed, which indicated a less synergistic contraction, and Emax,g fell by 21% from 7.1 +/- 2.0 to 5.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05). These data demonstrate that the mitral apparatus contributes importantly to the magnitude and uniformity of regional left ventricular elastances and suggest that such alterations in regional mechanics underlie the deterioration in global left ventricular systolic performance (Emax,g) after excision of the mitral apparatus.\n\nView details for PubMedID 2927157\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile conventional mitral valve replacement (MVR) for patients with chronic mitral regurgitation has been associated with relatively high operative mortality rates and incidence of late postoperative left ventricular (LV) failure and death, chordal-sparing mitral valve operations (valve repair/reconstruction or MVR with preservation of the chordae tendineae) subjectively appear to portend lower operative morbidity and mortality rates, better functional results, and improved long-term survival rates. Such empirical clinical observations have provided the basis for the concept of valvular-ventricular interaction, namely, that the intact mitral chordae are important mediators of more efficient and forceful ventricular contraction that enhances LV performance. This paper reviews the pertinent basic physiology and dynamics of the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles and examines critically the available experimental and clinical data regarding valvular-ventricular interaction. The problems inherent in quantifying LV contractility are central to this discussion and are also examined. While earlier experimental studies have produced conflicting results, more recent experiments utilizing load-independent measures of ventricular performance (particularly in isovolumic preparations) have conclusively demonstrated the importance of chordal integrity for optimal LV systolic function in normal animal hearts. The balance of the clinical evidence is also suggestive (although by no means conclusive) regarding the importance of valvular-ventricular interaction. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the mitral chordae enhance LV systolic function by means of regional afterload reduction. The mechanism(s) responsible for valvular-ventricular interaction, however, remains incompletely characterized at the present time, which underscores the urgent need for further experimental and, most importantly, clinical studies.\n\nView details for PubMedID 2980020\n\nAbstract\n\nClinical studies suggest that chorda-sparing mitral valve replacement techniques are associated with superior postoperative outcome, and several animal experiments have shown that disruption of the mitral subvalvular apparatus is followed by deterioration of left ventricular systolic function. One essential element, however, underlying the importance of chordal integrity for left ventricular function remains unproved: All investigators heretofore have been unable to demonstrate that left ventricular systolic performance can be restored by chordal reattachment after disruption of annular-papillary continuity. Therefore, we studied the effects of chordal detachment and subsequent chordal reattachment on left ventricular systolic performance using an in situ, isovolumic heart preparation in 10 halothane-anesthetized swine. The slope and left ventricular volume intercept of the isovolumic peak pressure-volume relationship were measured to assess global left ventricular systolic performance independent of load. Coronary perfusion pressure was maintained constant (95 +/- 6 mm Hg [+/- standard deviation]), and heart rates were in the physiologic range (133 +/- 26 min-1). Slope changed significantly (repeated measures analysis of variance, p = 0.0002), decreasing by 29% (from 4.74 +/- 0.94 to 3.37 +/- 0.87 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001) after chordal detachment and then returning to baseline (6.05 +/- 2.38 mm Hg/ml, p = 0.001) after chordal reattachment. Slope after chordal reattachment was not significantly different from the baseline value (p = 0.074). Volume intercept did not change significantly (p = 0.44) at any time. We conclude that the acute decrease in left ventricular contractility associated with surgical interruption of annular-ventricular continuity can, in fact, be reversed by chordal reattachment in this experimental model (isovolumically contracting normal porcine hearts). These data provide concrete confirmation of the concept of valvular-ventricular interaction; if these findings can be corroborated in the dilated, human left ventricle, such would strongly support efforts to preserve the mitral chordae tendineae during clinical mitral valve replacement to optimize postoperative left ventricular function.\n\nView details for PubMedID 3374162\n\nAbstract\n\nThe spiral orientation of left ventricular (LV) fibers suggests that twisting about the ventricular long axis of the apex with respect to the base, i.e., torsional deformation, may be characteristic of LV contraction. To demonstrate this twisting motion, 10 orthotopic human cardiac allograft recipients were studied with biplane cineradiography of tantalum helices implanted within the LV midwall at 12 specific sites. Counterclockwise twisting about the LV long axis (as reviewed from apex to base) accompanied ventricular ejection in all patients. Torsional deformation angles, measured relative to a reference minor axis at the base, were substantially smaller in the anteroapical wall, as compared with counterparts in the apical third of the inferior and lateral walls (anterior = 13.3 +/- 6.0 degrees, inferior = 18.7 +/- 6.3 degrees, and lateral = 23.4 +/- 10.7 degrees). Torsional angles at the midventricular level were roughly half as much and exhibited similar regional variabilities (anterior = 7.6 +/- 3.3 degrees, inferior = 9.0 +/- 3.3 degrees, lateral = 10.7 +/- 5.2 degrees, and septal = 8.8 +/- 3.8 degrees). Comparison of control beats and the initial beat after abrupt cessation of rapid atrial pacing (126 +/- 10 beats/min) with return to the control heart rate (96 +/- 9 beats/min) permitted the mild positive inotropic effect of tachycardia to be assessed at similar levels of ventricular load. Torsional deformation of the anteroapical and inferoapical sites increased significantly (p less than 0.05) over control values to 15.6 +/- 7.5 degrees and 21.2 +/- 5.5 degrees, respectively. In contrast, torsional deformation of the lateral wall was essentially unchanged. These data provide direct evidence for torsional deformation of the left ventricle in humans, demonstrate that torsion of the LV chamber is nonuniform, and suggest a dependence of LV torsion upon contractile strength that is attenuated in the lateral wall.\n\nView details for PubMedID 3282715\n\nAbstract\n\nTo describe the design and methodological approach of a multicenter, retrospective study to externally validate a clinical and imaging-based model for predicting the risk of late adverse events in patients with initially uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD).The Registry of Aortic Diseases to Model Adverse Events and Progression (ROADMAP) is a collaboration between 10 academic aortic centers in North America and Europe. Two centers have previously developed and internally validated a recently developed risk prediction model. Clinical and imaging data from eight ROADMAP centers will be used for external validation. Patients with uTBAD who survived the initial hospitalization between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013, with follow-up until 2020, will be retrospectively identified. Clinical and imaging data from the index hospitalization and all follow-up encounters will be collected at each center and transferred to the coordinating center for analysis. Baseline and follow-up CT scans will be evaluated by cardiovascular imaging experts using a standardized technique.The primary end point is the occurrence of late adverse events, defined as aneurysm formation (≥6 cm), rapid expansion of the aorta (≥1 cm/y), fatal or nonfatal aortic rupture, new refractory pain, uncontrollable hypertension, and organ or limb malperfusion. The previously derived multivariable model will be externally validated by using Cox proportional hazards regress"
