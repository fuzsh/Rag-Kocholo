This is a film term used to describe the incongruence of transitioning from one shot to another. You know- how like Halle Berry came out of the ocean in James Bond (Die Another Day) and then immediately in the next shot, her bikini was completely dry? Jump cut.\n\nChange happens to everybody. Everybody experiences transition. But it’s the frequency of change that can leave some TCKs feeling rootless or out of balance. I was surprised to read that almost all Third Culture Adults explore the effects of a highly mobile childhood, in their adulthood. \n\nMy upbringing is the best thing that ever happened to me! But the onset of delayed grief is very real and with time and honest reflection, I will reconcile the lost parts of a truly enriched childhood that gave me independence, freedom and resilience.\n\nI’m glad to hear that awareness and support has evolved over the past decade, through TCK transition care, international schools embedding this into their curriculum and parents making a conscious effort to check-in with their kids at all stages of the change journey.\n\nI unpack some of my “aha” moments along the lines of unresolved grief in my chat with @sharadlal on his enlightening podcast “How to Live.” \n\nHave a listen on apple or on spotify via the linkinbio and I’d love to hear what you think! @podcasthowtolive\".",
