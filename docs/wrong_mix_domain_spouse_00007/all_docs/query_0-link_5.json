        "text": "American actor (born 1944)\n\nFor the soccer player, see Danny Trejo (soccer).\n\nDanny Trejo ( , Spanish: [ˈtɾexo]; born May 16, 1944) is an American actor. A native of Los Angeles, Trejo's film career began in 1985, when he landed a role in Runaway Train (1985). The first film in which he was given a proper credited role was as Art Sanella in Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (1987).[1] He went on to star in a multitude of other films, many of which were small parts as inmates, gangsters, or other criminals,[2] appearing in Desperado, Heat (both in 1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996), Con Air (1997), The Replacement Killers (1998), Reindeer Games (2000), and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), among others.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Trejo appeared in the Robert Rodriguez-directed Spy Kids franchise as Isador \"Machete\" Cortez. Subsequently, in 2010, Trejo reprised his role as Machete in the spin-off exploitation action film Machete as the protagonist. With the success of Machete (2010), Trejo once again reprised his role in a direct sequel, Machete Kills (2013).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nChildhood\n\n[edit]\n\nDanny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, in Maywood, California.[3][4][5] He was raised on Temple Street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son of Mexican-American parents.[6][7][8] He is the son of Delores Rivera King[9] and Dionisio \"Dan\" Trejo (1922–1981),[10] a construction worker. Trejo was the result of an extramarital affair; Delores's husband was away fighting in World War II.[11] His parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943.[12] He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor Delores from 1949 until 1965; his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care.[11]\n\nTrejo was often abused by his father. Shortly after his birth, Trejo and his family briefly lived in San Antonio, Texas; they fled Los Angeles because Dionisio was wanted by police for stabbing another man. After a year, they returned to Los Angeles and Trejo's father turned himself in.[12] By 1949, Trejo shared a room with his cousins at their grandmother's house.[13] His stepmother was Alice Mendias, \"his only source of comfort\" when he lived with his father.[14][15][16]\n\nTrejo was using marijuana, heroin, and cocaine by ages 8, 12, and 18, respectively. [17][18][19] Trejo's uncle Gilbert introduced him to all three and was responsible for Trejo overdosing on his first heroin fix.[12] When he was 13, he moved to the majority Hispanic neighborhood of Pacoima, Los Angeles, where he said he did not experience racism growing up. Years later, he purchased his childhood home and often lived in it.[20]\n\nLife of crime and incarceration\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age seven, Trejo participated in his first drug deal.[21] He was first arrested at the age of 10,[22] but experienced his first incarceration at Eastlake Juvenile Hall in 1956.[22]\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Trejo's life consisted predominantly of intermittent jail stints in the California prison system.[22][23] The accounts of his prison chronology, though, are notably conflicting; by one account, his final term in custody is said to have ended in 1972.[8] However, Trejo did time in various juvenile offenders' camps,[24] including three years at Camp Glenn Rockey, San Dimas, for maiming a sailor (stabbing him in the face with broken glass),[25][26] followed by numerous California prisons between 1959 and 1969; \"I was in San Quentin, Folsom, Soledad, Vacaville, Susanville, Sierra\".[17]\n\nWhile doing a stint in Los Angeles County jail in 1961, he met Charles Manson, whom he described as a \"dirty, greasy, scrawny white boy\" who was allegedly a talented hypnotist.[27]\n\nTrejo arrived at San Quentin State Prison in 1966, and his heroin use was exacerbated shortly thereafter.[28] He was a debt collector and drug dealer, often participating in or witnessing acts of serious violence, including murder.[29][30] Simultaneously while imprisoned, Trejo focused on boxing[28] and became a champion in San Quentin's lightweight and welterweight divisions.[8]\n\nRegarding himself, Trejo has suggested his physical appearance contributed to his constantly getting into trouble.[17][31] In 1968, a prison riot broke out during Cinco De Mayo at Soledad. From that fracas, Trejo ended up in solitary confinement, facing capital charges and, potentially, the death penalty, after hitting a guard with a rock. While in solitary, Trejo found faith[32][10] and became a member of a 12-step program, having first attended one \"by accident\" aged 15. He successfully overcame his drug addictions, recalling in 2011 that he had been sober for the previous 42 years. Also while incarcerated, he earned his high-school diploma.[33][17]\n\nIn July 1969, Trejo was released from custody for the final time and returned to Pacoima, Los Angeles, having served five years of a 10-year prison sentence.[34][10]\n\nPrior to his film career, Trejo worked as a labor foreman for developer Saul Pick, and contributed toward the construction of the Cinerama Dome.[35] He was also a gardener, salesperson, part owner of a lawn care company, and became a substance abuse counselor since 1973.[36][37][38]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm and television\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Danny Trejo filmography\n\n1980s: Acting debut\n\n[edit]\n\nTrejo worked with Western Pacific Med Corp in the 1980s, assisting them with the establishing and operating of sober living houses within the San Fernando Valley.[40] He met a \"good looking tattooed kid\" during a meeting in one such house, who explained that he worked as a film extra and was paid $50 per day to stand there. Intrigued, Trejo considered becoming a film extra, initially due to the easy money and publicity it could afford his work with Western Pacific Med Corp. Trejo signed with an agent and would hand out his details while working on film sets, in the hopes of finding more opportunities to help those in need. Late one night, Trejo received a call from a teenaged patient, asking for his assistance in dealing with cocaine problems on the set of Runaway Train (1985).[41][8][42]\n\nWhile there, Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes. Edward Bunker, a former convict turned published crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo from their time together at San Quentin.[8][42] Remembering Trejo's boxing skills, Bunker played a pivotal role in securing Trejo as Eric Roberts' personal trainer and boxing advisor. Trejo was paid between $320 and $350 per day. Trejo recalled: \"When I got my first paycheck, I thought they made a mistake!\"[43][44] Bunker also convinced director Andrei Konchalovsky to offer Trejo a small acting role, asserting that Trejo's personal experiences of incarceration would provide authenticity to the prison drama.[45] Following his acting debut, Trejo was oblivious to being typecast as a prisoner in similar roles for years to follow; \"I [did not] know I was being stereotyped. I just knew I was working.\"[46]\n\nPenitentiary III was his first billed role. While filming he met Anthony Gambino of the Gambino Crime Family; Gambino allegedly had financial interests invested and was there to meet the leading man, Leon Isaac Kennedy. Trejo was paid $120 cash each day, but the project often went into overtime; \"We were stacked with cash.\"[47] On a good month, Trejo was taking home as much as $700 by 1989 from being an extra alone; yet, people often assumed he was far wealthier after a few appearances on television. Trejo says this worked to his advantage as a drug counselor, though, because clients would recognize him as an actor, therefore appreciating his presence and the humility of his work all the more.[48]\n\n1990s: Blood In, Blood Out and career progression\n\n[edit]\n\nTrejo had made a dozen films by 1990, including Death Wish 4: The Crackdown, and Marked for Death. He enjoyed the making of Guns,[49] yet alleges Erik Estrada took issue with the cast and crew being more familiar with Trejo than himself. Trejo says Estrada's ego got the better of him; he believes Estrada arranged for Trejo and a number of others to fly coach instead of first class on the way to Hawaii for filming.[50]\n\nIn 1991, Edward James Olmos originally offered him the role of Pedro Santana in American Me.[51] Trejo was unimpressed by the script and his initial meeting with Olmos. Trejo claims rumors began circulating within the Mexican Mafia that the script was taking narrative liberties. Before Trejo had the chance to attend a second meeting with Olmos, he received a call from Joe \"Pegleg\" Morgan, the then-don of the Mexican Mafia; Morgan approved of his choosing a role in Blood In, Blood Out instead of American Me.[52] In 2021, Trejo stated that he believes Olmos has yet to accept him as a serious actor.[46]\n\nOf his experiences of Blood In, Blood Out, Trejo recalls feeling uncomfortable around many of the other actors during rehearsals, as they were more established.[53] During production at San Quentin, Trejo often had flashbacks to his time there; filming scenes in C550, his former cell, merely exacerbated such feelings.[54] Though his previous works brought him opportunities, Trejo credits Blood In, Blood Out as having brought him \"legitimate, worldwide fame.\"[55]\n\nTrejo found a new talent agent with the help of Raymond Cruz. He was first cast in an episode of Baywatch, followed by a part in 1993's Last Light, Kiefer Sutherland's directorial debut.[56]\n\nHeat went through two script revisions while Trejo read for the part. He ultimately secured the role, which reunited him with Michael Mann, who had directed him in the television miniseries Drug Wars: The Camarena Story a few years prior. Mann initially mistook Trejo for his uncle Gilbert; he found the resemblance uncanny, having met Gilbert while shooting The Jericho Mile at Folsom in the late 1970s; production required the co-operation of the inmates, and Gilbert happened to be one of the shot-callers. Trejo's character in the film was initially called 'Vince' but renamed 'Trejo' in honor of Gilbert. Filming could be upward of 17 hours per day, but Trejo said he was grateful for how much he learned; \"watching De Niro, Kilmer, and Voight, I learned a lot about how they saved [their performances] for when it mattered.\" He recalls being mentored by Robert De Niro, who was a patient and instructive scene partner. Trejo and De Niro improvised the former's death scene.[57]\n\nIn 1996, Trejo was cast in the French production Le Jaguar (which was French for The Jaguar) and reunited with Voight for Anaconda, both of which were filmed in Manaus, Brazil. When production for Anaconda moved to Venezuela, Trejo would go out socializing on his days off. The producers were worried given a possible coup d'état had made parts of the country unsafe to travel; a group of teenagers brandished AK47's on one occasion, demanding Trejo's combat boots. Because of this, Trejo says he negotiated a higher salary to remain within the confines of his hotel.[58]\n\nTrejo described 1997's Con Air as a \"macho fest from the start\" and the cast were often pulling pranks on one another. He remembers Nicolas Cage as being \"cool as hell\" and John Cusack as a \"kickboxing badass\". Trejo met many of his longtime friends on set, including: John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and Dave Chappelle.[59]\n\n2000s: Health scare, Spy Kids and the establishing of Isador \"Machete\" Cortez\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter concluding Animal Factory in 1999, he contracted Hepatitis C and \"had to drag [his] ass\" from Canada to Austin, Texas, to begin filming of Spy Kids in 2000. Spy Kids marked Trejo's debut as the fictional character Isador \"Machete\" Cortez. Having already made Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn together, the opportunity to collaborate with Robert Rodriguez, Antonio Banderas, and Cheech Marin once again \"felt like [a] family reunion.\"[60] Spy Kids provided Trejo with worldwide recognition and for the first time he was \"instantly recognizable\" among children around the globe.[61]\n\nBy the time of Bubble Boy in 2001, his illness had progressed to the point that much of the cast had noticed his weight loss; Trejo states that his past drug use had caught up with him. He described himself as having been pale and weak throughout production, and pre-occupied with keeping his diagnosis a secret within Hollywood for fear of reprisal. Trejo was \"out of it\" and struggling to remember his lines due to prescription medication. By the time Spy Kids premiered in September 2002, Trejo had fully recovered.[60][61]\n\nThroughout the 2000s Trejo appeared in productions including: XXX; Once Upon a Time in Mexico; Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy; The Devil's Rejects; Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror; Delta Farce; Grindhouse; Rob Zombie's Halloween; Urban Justice (alongside Steven Seagal); and Valley of Angels. He also made a number of television appearances, including: Monk, Desperate Housewives, Stargate: Atlantis, and Breaking Bad. Trejo also voiced the characters Enrique and Octavio on King of the Hill. His life is documented in the independent biographical film, Champion, featuring some of Trejo's close friends: Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Steve Buscemi, and Robert Rodriguez.[62] Trejo also shared his tumultuous journey from convict to film star with KTTV in Los Angeles, 2013, in a segment filmed in Trejo's home.[63]\n\n2010s: Becoming a lead actor\n\n[edit]\n\nRegarding his continued growth as a professional actor, Trejo has remarked, \"I'm so blessed. I'm still scared that somebody's going to wake me up and say, 'Hey, we're still in prison. Let's go to chow’\".[64] Trejo also played 'Machete' in a trailer made for Rodriguez's film collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, Grindhouse. He also starred in a full theatrical release of the film Machete, in 2010, based on the character Isador \"Machete\" Cortez and again in 2013 for the sequel film, Machete Kills.\n\nIn 2011, he appeared in the action film Recoil as Drayke Selgado, with WWE wrestler and actor Steve Austin and played the role of the Ripper in Cross.\n\nIn 2012, Trejo starred alongside Ron Perlman and Charles S.

His character works as a breacher (an interdimensional bounty hunter) who can manipulate the space-time fabric and travel to parallel worlds.

Trejo later mentioned in the interview that he \"couldn't stop laughing\" after the panel had thought that \"Raccoon\" was originally portrayed by Danny DeVito.[71]\n\nThat same year, he appeared in season six of Running Wild with Bear Grylls on the episode \"Danny Trejo in the Moab Desert\"[72] and portrayed one of the many forms of Mr. World in the first two episodes of the third and final season of American Gods.[73] In 2021, Trejo portrayed the Ghost of Huet in the Disney+ puppet comedy Halloween special Muppets Haunted Mansion.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2022, Trejo made his official Star Wars debut in the Disney+ space Western television series The Book of Boba Fett as a Rancor keeper on the episode \"Chapter 3: The Streets of Mos Espa\".[74]\n\nVideo Games\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Trejo made an appearance in the videogame Def Jam: Fight for NY, playing one of the villains, an enforcer for Snoop Dogg's character.

Her parents did not approve of their relationship, and they were married in the backyard of Trejo's family home.[97] Trejo believes his drug use and criminal lifestyle contributed to their marriage's demise; Laura filed for divorce during his second confinement at Youth Training School.[97]\n\nHe was married to Debbie from 1971 to 1975,[98][99] and to Joanne from 1975 to 1978.[100]\n\nTrejo has three children: Danny (b. 1981), actor and director Gilbert (b. 1988), and actress Danielle (b. 1990).[87][101] His eldest child, nicknamed \"Danny Boy\", is from a relationship with Diana Walton;[102][103] they were together from 1978 to 1983.[104][105] His latter two children are from a relationship with Maeve Crommie.[106] They were together from 1986 to 1997,[107] and he has also helped her raise her two sons from a subsequent relationship.[36][108]\n\nIn 1997, he married Debbie Shreve; they separated in 2005 and he filed for divorce in 2009.[109][110]\n\nTrejo is a Democrat.[111] His second cousin is filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, though the two were unaware they were related until the filming of Desperado.[112][113]\n\nTrejo battled liver cancer in 2010.[114] In 2011, he moved to the San Fernando Valley to be closer to his mother after she sustained a knee injury; she died in 2013.[101] Prior to this, he lived in Venice, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.[17][115] In August 2019, he witnessed a car colliding with an SUV at an intersection and helped extract a five-year-old trapped in a child safety seat inside the overturned SUV. In reference to the incident, he was quoted saying: \"Everything good that has happened to me has happened as a direct result of helping someone else. Everything.\"[116]\n\nTrejo is characterized in his acting roles by his distinctive appearance; in addition to his heavily lined face, scarred from cystic acne and boxing brawls, and the long hair often in a ponytail and full mustache that he usually sports, he also displays, for many roles, a large tattoo on his chest (depicting a woman – a Charra wearing a sombrero).[42][117]\n\nTrejo is a passionate fan of the Los Angeles Rams dating back well into their original tenure in Los Angeles. Trejo claims that as a child he used to sneak through the security fences at the LA Coliseum to watch Rams games.[118] He frequently attends games and the team's training camps.[119][120]\n\nDuring the filming of Blood In, Blood Out at San Quentin, Trejo met Mario Castillo, a prisoner in the midst of drug addiction. Trejo helped him overcome his addiction, and they became good friends upon Castillo's release from prison. They have since spoken together at both juvenile detention centers and recovery centers across California.[17][10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDanny Trejo filmography\n\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nTrejo, Danny.
