        "text": "Maricopa County Bar Hall of Fame\n\nThe Hall of Fame was created in 2008 through the MCBA by then-president, Hon. Glenn Davis. It seeks to honor in perpetuity those remarkable individuals who have built the legal profession in this county and beyond, who have made extraordinary contributions to the law and justice, and who have distinguished themselves at the highest levels of public service.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's goal is also to preserve and foster the legal profession's history in our county and to showcase these best and brightest lights to the larger community. Their biographies and images are currently displayed in the Maricopa County Justice Museum and Learning Center, housed on the sixth floor of the Historic Maricopa County Courthouse.\n\nAt the museum, visitors can read the stories of how these individuals persevered and succeeded in shaping laws, lives, institutions and communities. The hope is that they will be an inspiration to others to pursue their dreams and make their own extraordinary contributions.\n\nSelection and Induction\n\nEach spring, MCBA solicits nominations of worthy candidates from the legal community. A selection committee evaluates and selects inductees and those selected are inducted at the MCBA Annual Meeting/Hall of Fame Dinner in the fall.\n\nFor more information, please contact MCBA Executive Director Laurie Williams, lwilliams@maricopabar.org\n\n2024 Hall of Fame Nomination Form Robert R. Mills Member of the Year Nomination Form Judicial Office of the Year Nomination Form\n\nPublic Lawyer of the Year"
