        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nBook Reviews 191 Jack Dempsey. Michigan’s Civil War Citizen-General: Alpheus S. Williams. Cheltenham, UK: The History Press, 2019. Pp. 240. Maps. Appendices. Notes. Index. Paper: $21.99. Alpheus Starkey Williams graduated from Yale and traveled extensively before settling down in Detroit in 1836. He joined the militia and earned a living in banking, journalism, and minor government posts. Like many Civil War officers, he served in the Mexican War—as lieutenant colonel of the 1st Michigan Infantry. He endured traumatic personal losses with the passing of his wife and three of their children, yet persevered to secure appointment as president of Michigan’s state military board. With the advent of the Civil War, Williams proved instrumental in raising and training Michigan’s recruits, and was commissioned brigadier general of volunteers. Over the next four years, he faithfully served his country in Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas, playing key battlefield roles at Antietam, Gettysburg, and elsewhere. Williams ranked among the most prominent and impactful Michiganders in the Union army, yet he never secured promotion. After the war, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Jack Dempsey, author of several books on Michigan’s history— including two prior volumes about the Civil War—seeks here to bolster and secure Williams’s legacy. Amazingly, this is the first published, booklength biography of the general, although his fascinating personal correspondence was published sixty years ago by Milo M. Quaife. Dempsey recounts Williams’s civilian life in detail, placing his military career in context. The wartime chapters are first and foremost a chronological narrative of military operations, and in that, Dempsey is eminently successful, with engaging writing and well-chosen photographs. Coverage of the postwar period is enhanced with discussion of how the general has been remembered and memorialized. Dempsey’s central theme for the war years—that Williams deserved promotion—is neither novel nor debatable, yet it must be addressed since the subject’s unrewarded success is integral to his life story. Many students of the war would agree that Williams’s performance at Antietam, alone, should have secured his promotion to major general. Dempsey finds no smoking gun to explain this slight; Williams was overlooked for promotion so many times that there can be no single, satisfying explanation. As Dempsey shows, the historical consensus is that the general found it distasteful to aggrandize himself, and West Point favoritism played a role, as did Williams’s politics—as a Democrat serving predominantly Republican superiors. 192 The Michigan Historical Review There are a couple of missed opportunities. The battle maps are very basic (sometimes omitting troop dispositions), and the narrative does not always overcome that shortcoming to convey what was special about Williams’s prowess in battle. This is particularly true for Antietam, where the climactic engagement at the cornfield is narrated with surprising brevity. The bibliography is omitted, although it is accessible on the author’s website. Lastly, military operations are emphasized to the point that we don’t get to know Williams the man very well. For this reason, Quaife’s aforementioned collection of the general’s personal correspondence will serve as a welcome companion volume. Notwithstanding these caveats, this is a much needed and overdue biography. I recommend Michigan’s Civil War General to anyone with a specific interest in Alpheus S. Williams, or in Michigan’s contribution to the Union war effort. Eric R. Faust Palo Alto, CA Charles Eisendrath. Downstream from Here: A Big Life in a Small Space. Traverse City, MI: Mission Point Press, 2019. Pp. 255. Index. Illustrations. Hardcover: $26.95. The experience of driving around lower Michigan is one of going through spaces characterized by urban development. Each of those urban places has a distinct and complex history. Knowing that history is important to fully appreciating the nature of the space. Driving in upper Michigan is different. The space consists mostly of long two-lane roads bordered by groves of bush or trees broken by occasional views of water. Along those roads are mailboxes and driveways that suggest some sort of activity lies beyond. Each of those driveways leads to a place often treasured in a personal way to its owners. That..."
