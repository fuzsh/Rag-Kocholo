I have a Jd in a 135 with some guys that are more agressive than your average jag and he has always held his own.\n\njmatthewvan\n\nFeeder Fish\n\nJun 30, 2005\n\n342\n\n1\n\n0\n\nMukilteo,WA\n\n#6\n\nDon't get too technical,the two are very compatible as long as you start them off reasonably young...\n\nAquanero\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nFeb 16, 2009\n\n10,324\n\n528\n\n1,101\n\nNew Jersey\n\n#7\n\nUnfortunately the best answer is maybe. You will hear success stories and horror stories, not just with Jag, JD combinations either. Given a big enough tank your chances of success increase considerably. JDs for the most part are not overly aggressive so if you have a tolerant Jag they could live together. The best advice would be plan for the worst and hope for the best, no one can say yes it will work or no it wouldnt work. It depends on the disposition of the individual fish in question. Good luck with them.\n\nshamrock\n\nPiranha\n\nFeb 26, 2006\n\n1,877\n\n47\n\n81\n\n50\n\nEl Paso\n\n#8\n\nThat is why I never get less than 4 cichlids-spreads aggression out.\n\nfishguts\n\nFire Eel\n\nAug 5, 2007\n\n2,420\n\n3\n\n68\n\npennsylvania\n\n#9\n\njags in captivity seldom reach 16 inches let alone 18 inches. ive seen some of the largest jags around here and there 15 and 16 inches tops. most are 12-14. but yes the jag would be bigger then the jd but i dont think it would harass it to death as long as the jd stays of his territory."
