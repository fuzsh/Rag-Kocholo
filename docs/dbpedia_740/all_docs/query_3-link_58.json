        "text": "The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is a striking and vibrant variant of the classic Jack Dempsey cichlid (Rocio octofasciata). This stunning fish is prized in the aquarium hobby for its brilliant blue coloration, which covers its body and fins in various shades of electric and iridescent blues. This variant retains the robust body shape and dynamic personality of the traditional Jack Dempsey but stands out with its unique coloration. Electric Blue Jack Dempseys are somewhat smaller and less aggressive than their standard counterparts, making them slightly more suitable for community tanks, although they still require careful consideration when choosing tank mates due to their cichlid nature.\n\nOrigin: The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is a result of selective breeding and is not found in the wild. The original Jack Dempsey species is native to North and Central America, particularly in areas ranging from Mexico to Honduras.\n\nTemperature: The ideal temperature range for Electric Blue Jack Dempseys is between 22째C to 28째C (72째F to 82째F).\n\nWater Quality: They thrive in a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and prefer soft to moderately hard water.\n\nAquarium Size: A minimum tank size of 200 liters is recommended due to their potential size and territorial nature. The aquarium should have plenty of hiding places and space for swimming.\n\nFeeding: Electric Blue Jack Dempseys are omnivorous and should be fed a diet that includes high-quality pellets or flakes, along with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, and krill for nutritional variety.\n\nLifespan: With proper care, Electric Blue Jack Dempseys can live for about 10 to 15 years.\n\nBehavior and Personality: While less aggressive than the standard Jack Dempsey, they can still show territorial behavior, especially during breeding. They are best kept with other similarly sized and tempered fish. Their vibrant coloration and interactive nature make them a favorite among cichlid enthusiasts."
