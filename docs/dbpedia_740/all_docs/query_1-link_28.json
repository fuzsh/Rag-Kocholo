        "text": "WASHINGTON.\n\nAFEW days after John Tunney was elected to the United States Senate, he was walking through the Capitol building when he ran into a senior Senator from one of the Southern states. The Senator, who was with a group of his constituents, introduced his colleagueto‐be from California: “Gentlemen, this man has just been elected to the United States Senate, and I'm sure you all know his daddy, who used to be the heavyweight champion of the world. I'd like you all to meet Senator Dempsey.”\n\nThe slip's implication that Tunney's success is based on faded memories of his father is one that many of his critics would agree with. According to their line of reasoning, Tunney is the son of a famous boxer who diverted the spotlight from his father to himself. Tall, handsome and athletic‐looking, married to an attractive Dutch woman who has just launched her own rock ‘n’ roll singing career,* the son appears In society pages as much as in news stories; though glamorous, his critics suggest he is intellectually second‐rate, as befits the son of a boxer, a “political lightweight,” to wrap up the metaphor.\n\nBut to other observers, Tunney is one of the most intriguing young Senators. For a 37‐year‐old who seven years ago had never been elected to political office, his achievements\n\n*Mieke Tunney has cut a rock ‘n’ roll record entitled, “Habit of Love.” are impressive. He is already a proven vote‐getter, having a year ago defeated incumbent Senator George Murphy by an overwhelming 600,000 votes. His political pluses include his Kennedy‐like accent and mannerisms —and his close friendship with his law school roommate, Teddy Kennedy.\n\nBecause of that friendship, political writers found clues to Kennedy's plans in Tunney's endorsement, early this month, of Senator Edmund S. Muskie for the Democratic Presidential nomination. As a result of the endorsement, Muskie is sure to gain substantial backing, both financial and political, in California. In return, Muskie has mentioned Tunney as a possible Vice‐Presidential candidate. (He denies any interest in the post, but cannot help savoring the attention.)\n\nTunney says he endorsed Muskie only after becoming convinced that Kennedy was not interested in running. Even if Kennedy should decide to seek the nomination later on, Tunney says, he will stay with Muskie right through the convention, unless the Maine Senator at some point releases his delegates. Without doubt, his support will give Muskie a big boost in next year's California primary. For freshman Senator John Varick Tunney is acknowledged by many to be the most powerful member of the party in the nation's most populous state.\n\nSITTING at his desk in the new Senate Office Building, the heavyweight champ's son reaches down into his briefcase and, with the sheep. ish look of a 13‐year‐old boy about to reveal a picture cf his girl friend, hauls out a thick pile of yellow, legal‐sized papers on which over the years he has scribbled down quotations from his favorite poems.\n\n“No, I won't let you read all these,” he says. “... I won't want you to read all of them... because some of them are... I think that you can tell.. I'll let you.” The political. protective side of John Tunney has lost another small battle. He begins to read from the list, which includes Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Whitman, Pasternak, Frost and Auden. At other times, when he is speaking about public affairs, his manner of speech is restless, nervous, intense, full of stops and starts and incomplete sentences, as if dozens of tiny policy deci‐ions are packed into each paragraph. But now some of the tension flows out of his voice, and he relaxes.\n\nIt is no accident that his list contains more romantics than contemporary poets, for Tunney has almost 19th‐century conception of poetry: it is a mark of the civilized man, a necessary complement to the public life, an embodiment of balance and refinement. But as he recites bits of Frost and Shakespeare's “Troilus and Cressida” from memory, his voice no longer hesitant, it becomes apparent that poetry means a bit more to him than that, for he is obviously, openly, elementally enjoying himself. It is his American spontaneity escaping his European theory of himself.\n\nThis is not unusual, for Tunney, who traveled in Europe 140 time before becoming a Congressman in 1964, displays an assortment of New and Old World idiosyncrasies. In his Continental‐style Washington home, with his wife at his side, he seems a model of European decorum, but later, prancing about the house with his shirttails hanging out, he is slop py, casual, good ol’ John. He condemns another politician because the man “has no gentle instincts,” but explains how much he himself loves a political fight. He is a disciplinarian, a family man deeply concerned about the baneful effect that his frequent absences from home have on his children, but he is also a swinger who wears his hair styled like a tight, furry helmet.\n\nHe is somewhat formal, uncomfortable with backslappers and swear words and babies who ought to be kissed. A friend who has known him since college days says that even his laugh is formal: “You feel it's coming from the throat, rather than his chest. It's as if he's trying to say. '1 like your story; I want to show it, and this is the best I can do to laugh.’ “ And at the same time, he is open, almost to the point of innocence, so much so that a reporter who traveled with Tunney during his Senate campaign last year had this to say about him:\n\n“He's one of the most interesting politicians around. He's not an organization guy, the way Birch Bayh strikes me, one of these modern, young, imitation John Kennedy‐style politicians. He's very open, very frank, very forthright about himself. He's the guy you might have roomed with in college. He told me one time. ‘You know, my problem is I'm not a supercool fellow. Everyone meets me and they think I come on too strong. I bare my soul to everybody. They used to tell me not to do that, and it got me in a lot of trouble.’ He comes on like a big puppy dog sometimes. That's just the way he is.’\n\nInevitably, his critics crack that Tunney is a “political lightweight.” But the California Senator has a tot more going for him than faded memories of his dad.\n\nTHREE days after Mayday protesters tried to tie up traffic in the capital this year, Tunney talks about antiwar demonstrators in a speech before the Woman's Democratic Club in Washington.\n\nThe vast majority of his audience is made up of middle‐aged or elderly women. He begins by joking about California's Gov. Ronald Reagan's failure to pay any state income taxes in 1970. “Reagan,” Tunney says, “has decided that he's not going to pay any taxes for the deadbeats on welfare.” Then he tells a long story about an incident that occurred at an airport after he had handed out several photos to travelers who recognized him. A stewardess had begun to praise him lavishly, and he told her that her words embarrassed him, to which a man who had been observing him for several minutes responded, “How do you embarrass a man who carries around 8‐by‐10 glossy pictures of himself?” The audience, obviously warm to Tunney, responds with sustained laughter. They enjoy a Senator who, though young and glamorous, can poke fun at his own vanity.\n\nThen Tunney swings into the serious part of his speech. He explains that he had originally intended to talk about the optimism he feels as a result of “the actions and commitment of those young Americans who have concerned themselves with the cause of peace, of joblessness, of discrimination and repression,” but, he continues, “the events of the past few days have made me angry.... A small band of refugees from the real world have attempted to disrupt the Government and disrupt the Senate.... The actions of Rennie Davis and his group of Mayday henchmen have been both absurd and frustrating, absurd because they will never attain any constructive end, and frustrating because they well might have ruined several months of hard work by the real advocates of peace....”\n\nThe speech angers those who have mistakenly considered Tunney an orthodox liberal, but to those who know him it is very much in character. The disciplinarian in Tunney is speaking. He thinks the Mayday tactics may have brought about increased political repression and impeded efforts in the Senate to end the war, but, more importantly, it is evident that he intuitively dislikes the protesters for questioning the capacity of the American Government — and, by extension, his own delegated authority—to deal with present problems. “I have no sympathy for those who set out deliberately to disrupt our Government,” he says. “Violence may be justified in those ossified autocracies where orderly change is impossible, but it is not justified and it cannot be tolerated in our nation's capital, itself a worldwide symbol of orderly change, of due process, of democracy.”\n\nHalf the audience reacts warmly to the speech, applauding frequently; the other half remains quiet until the end. The woman who introduced Tunney thanks him for “some encouraging talk instead of doom and gloom.” Tunney maintains an amiable cheerfulness as he answers questions from the floor. The last questioner asks if it is possible to get a copy of the speech. Tunney pauses, the trace of a blush appearing on his face. “Well, I'm deeply flat tered,” he says, smiling. “Don't be surprised if there's an 8‐by‐10 glossy with it.” More laughter from the audience.\n\nTWO days later, on Saturday, Tunney flies to Amherst, Mass., to attend the wedding of a Harvard law student who worked on his staff for five summers. It is a decent gesture for an eternally busy man who tries to save Saturdays for his family. He arrives in Hartford, Conn., and is greeted by Mary Shinkwin, 28 years old, his secretary, Sherry Saunders, 27, his press aide's secretary, and Stuart Wein, 24, another Harvard law student who worked on Tunney's Senate campaign. The secretaries, who have flown up from Washington the day before, are pretty, giggly and wholesome. They kid with him, compliment him and listen as he dominates the conversation during the drive to Amherst. He talks with Wein about bar exams (Tunney has passed bar exams in Virginia, New York and California), explaining why he prefers subjective to objective questions. He moves on to raoial problems (“A system has developed in the ghetto whereby people are rewarded for illegal behavior”), Lockheed (He says he will support the Government loan to the company that was later voted by Congress) and his speech on the Mayday protesters (He laughingly calls one critic of his speech a “radical‐liberal”). The talk is cheerful and breezy, but its earnest, enthusiastic tone seems somehow dated and complacent.\n\nWhen asked how he likes the Senate, Tunney answers quickly, “I love it,” but he seems to see only its good points. Tunney is currently writing a book on his experiences as a freshman Senator. To him, the Senate Is a durable arena where rational, responsible men, guided by intelligence and objective fact, meet to map the nation's destiny. It is as if he had not heard some crucial bit of bad news.\n\nAfter the wedding he goes through the reception line, repeating his elongated “Nice to meet you's.” Then a group of law students gather around him. Tunney is uncharted territory to them—they see only his Kennedyesque, prizefighter glamour. Curious, they fire the usual Vietnam questions at him. Holding a drink in one hand and continually gesturing with the other, he answers deftly and quickly, until they run out of ammunition. They seem impressed. “I like him,” one says afterwards. “He says what he thinks.”\n\nOn the drive back to the airport, Tunney is more relaxed, more expansive. He tells stories about his daredevil ski competitions with Ted Kennedy in the days when they attended the University of Virginia Law School together. He has to be reminded of the story about the time he knocked down a farmer's fence while racing cars with Kennedy. Tunney was charged with speeding and appeared in court. After he admitted that he was going 55 or 60 miles an hour, his lawyer, trying to cast doubt on the accuracy of his estimate, asked him, “Well, driving that difficult road, you weren't watching your speedometer, were you?”\n\n“No, no, sir,” Tunney replied.\n\n“Then how do you know you were going that fast?”\n\n“Oh, well, I always went 55 or 601”\n\nMUCH of Tunney's competitive spirit was absorbed from his father. Self‐educated, self‐made, a believer in Social Darwinism, James Joseph Tunney — nicknamed Gene — literally fought his way out of New York City's Irish ghetto and into the company of men like George Ber nard Shaw, Wendell Willkie, the Duke of Windsor, Ernest Hemingway and Charles Lindbergh. Gene wanted his three sons to be strong competitors and he constantly inspired rivalry among them.* “We were trained to battle each other,” says Jay, the youngest brother. “That's true of all brothers, but for us there was a little bit more intensity.”\n\nGene pushed the boys not only in sports but also in intellectual pursuits. One of his gambits was to offer a dollar to the son who could most quickly memorize a poem he selected for them. John's older brother, Gene, won most of the poetry competitions, but John is the only one who has maintained an interest in poetry.\n\n*Joan, the fourth offspring and only daughter of Gene Tunney, seems to have been left out of many of the masculineoriented family activities—and that conceivably contributed to her later troubles. In June, 1970, she murdered her husband while in England and is now in a mental institution in Massachusetts.\n\nThe father, who married into a wealthy Greenwich, Conn., family after retiring from the ring in 1928, at one time served on the boards of 17 banks and corporations. He tried to protect his children from what Jay calls “the lionized life that he led as a world champion.” As a result, the boys were sent off to a succession of private schools, both Gene and John attending a total of four. It was an affluent, sheltered life. In the summer the boys usually went to camp in Maine, though one year the family took a trip to Cuba to visit Ernest and Mary Hemingway. Because most of John's early education was in boarding schools, he was obviously somewhat distant from his family. “I perhaps was groping more than I would have if I had been home during those early years. I found it difficult to find out who I was, where was, the old identity crisis that every kid goes through. Some people have more acute identity crises than others.... If it hadn't been for my father's being famous, it\n\nJOHN'S prep school record was mediocre. At Westminster School in Simsbury, Conn., where he was enrolled for three years before going on to college, he graduated 21st in a class of 40. He did not participate in student government, and the only distinction his classmates voted him at the end of senior year was that of “worst voice.” He was not even considered handsome, as he is now; his friends, noting his large teeth and slightly bulging eyes, called him “Horse.”\n\nHe learned to box at Westminster and even gave infrequent exhibitions with one of his teachers, but he did not like the sport. “I didn't enjoy boxing in public because of the fact that my father was so good that people would expect me to be equally good.” Not a good enough athlete to live up to his father's reputation, John was left with a desire to succeed but no particular outlet for it. “I thought that if I made a commitment of myself to anything, I wanted to be the very best,” he now says. “That was a very deep psychological yearning, and that, I think, was directly attributable to my father.”\n\nAt Yale, where he went because, “on my mother's side of the family, we'd gone to Yale for generations,” Tun ney's record was not much more distinguished than it had been at Westminster. He tried out for The Yale Daily News, the college's most prestigious undergraduate organization at the time, but dropped out of the competition when he was asked to sell advertisements. He joined the Yale Aviation Club, but gave that up after recurring bouts of airsickness. Most discouraging, after two years at Yale, a dean suggested that he take a year off because he was in academic trouble and not working up to his capacities. Instead, Tunney spent a month in Peru with several anthropologists and became “absolutely fascinated by anthropology.” The result was that he changed his major to anthropology before his junior year and did well in ‘his last two years.\n\nHIS politics at the time were Republican and conservative. Mike Marron, a friend at Yale and now a San Francisco resident who helped Tunney in his Senate campaign, remembers: “His posiition oftentimes — maybe it was with tongue‐in‐cheek—sounded rather conservative and given to aristocracy, as opposed to the common man. As likely at not, he might say, ‘Let ‘em eat cake,’ that kind of thing. At the time you'd never think of him voting for anybody like Humphrey or McGovern. He seemed to be a solid Eisenhower man.”\n\nStill, John was not particularly interested in politics. His brother Jay says that in college “John was far more into O'Shaughnessy and Shelley and Keats than he was into politics. He preferred to talk about Shakespeare rather than Eisenhower.... He was the romantic and the poet of the family, most intrinsically the Irish bard.” In short, he was a dreamer.\n\nAs graduation neared, Tunney considered a broad variety of careers, from writing fiction or teaching, to the import ‐export business or law. Unfocused and as yet unchallenged, Tunney turned down the chance to get a job through his father's connections and instead gave himself three more years by going to law school.\n\n“When I got to law school,” Tunney says now, “I suddenly became aware of the fact that this world was cold and cruel, and that people were indeed very, very hungry.” Tunney did a lot of maturing quickly. For the first time in his life he began to work quite hard, and in his last year at the University of Virginia Law School he won the mootcourt competition.\n\nDuring Tunney's first year at law school, he met Teddy Kennedy. They became close friends, traveled and skied together, and in their last two years rented a house near the campus together. Brother Gene now attributes much of the change that took place in John to Kennedy's influence: “There was a very distinct change which was very obvious to me after he went to law school. It was very quick, all of a sudden. He became far more gregarious, far more outgoing. Teddy, of course, is an extroverted person essentially, and he liked to get around and do things. John admired him and was with him a great deal, and it rubbed off.”\n\nIN the summer of 1958, John and Teddy went to Massachusetts to campaign for John F. Kennedy's reelection to the Senate. Exposed to the Kennedy family, Tunney began to take an in‐terest in politics and, though he was then registered as a Republican in Connecticut, was soon espousing more liberal views. By the time he left law school, he knew that he would eventually go into politics. He worked for th, New York law firm of Cahill, Gordon, Reindel & Ohl for a year and a half, then joined the Air Force and was assigned as a judge advocate to March Air Force Base in Riverside, Calif. During that time he taught business law at the University of California at Riverside and gave about 75 speeches to local service clubs. “I did that for selfimprovement,” Tunney says. “I believed very, very definitely in the idea of training yourself. To be prepared for any eventuality. And then the opportunity came, of course, when I ran for Congress.”\n\nIn 1963, he alone believed that he had an opportunity against Patrick Mino; Martin, a conservative Republican who was in his first term represent ing California's 38th District. Tunney felt that he could defeat Martin but was advised against running by most of his friends. A poll demonstrated that it would be difficult for him to win,’ but Tunney, showing what even his detractors have credited him with all along—political common sense— decided to make the race. With his father, Jack Dempsey and Ted Kennedy (by then a Senator) all campaigning for him, he won the election by 10,000 votes.\n\nA college classmate of Tunney's remembers seeing him soon after he was elected, the first time the two had met since college: “I was stunned to see the change in the guy. I did a double‐take. He seemed to be much taller. He had filled out. He was good‐looking. I remembered him as scrawny. His manner of speech was different—it was resonant, full‐throated. He was obviously a public figure. He was in full command. It was like a 98‐pound weakling turning into the big, strong guy.”\n\nJay Tunney expiai‐s John's at’ raction to politics this way: “Politics is like getting into the ring, or being a gladiator. John has tremendous energy. It's therapeutic for him to be on the move a lot. It's like a shock, it's like taking dope in a way—it relieves the internal pressures, the nervousness. Greenwich Country Club is no antidote for this kind of nervous energy.”\n\nREPRESENTATIVE JOHN TUNNEY'S success in California's 38th District — he increased his victory margin both times he sought re‐election—was not so much attributable to his political stance, which was somewhat more liberal than that of the district's voters taken as a whole, as to his personal qualities. Tunney's glamour was welcome in a district that had never been in the spotlight before. Gene Tunney's son, Teddy Kennedy's pal, tall, handsome and charming, Tunney presented an attractive a‐ray V attributes. At the same time, he worked hard and performed the ombudsman chores of a Congressman well.\n\n*The exigencies of politics are such that Tunney, who had been known by his middle name of Varick up to then, began using his first name, John, because of the poll, which showed that more than 60 per cent of his prospective constituents thought the name Varick was “Russian and/or Communistic.” To avoid confusion, John's younger brother, whose first name was Jonathan, was forced to call himself Jay.\n\nTunney says he first thought seriously of running for the Senate on the night that he was first elected to Congress, the same night George Murphy was elected Senator, over Pierre Salinger, which meant that there would not be a Democratic incumbent in the post in 1970. As time went on, Tunney grew frustrated in the House. After he was elected for his third term in 1968, he decided to run for the Senate. He began making speeches throughout California, and his brother Jay resigned from his job in a large real‐estate development firm to serve as campaign coordinator. Tunney consequently had a big head start over his major opponent in the Democratic primary, Representative George Brown, and Brown never caught up.\n\nTunney won the primary with 41.6 per cent of the vote, compared with Brown's 33.4 per cent. In the final few weeks, the campaign became bitter, with each candidate accusing the other of misrepresenting voting records. But though these charges of foul play may have influenced some votes, the chief factors in Tunney's victory were his better financing, his earlier start, and the fact that because of his more moderate stance he had a better chance of defeating Murphy in November.\n\nIn many ways the general election was easier than the primary. Murphy's integrity had been called into question following the disclosure that while a Senator he had accepted a $20,000 salary, an air travel card and half the rent on his Washington apartment from Technicolor, Inc. (He denied that he had done any favors for the company in return.) His voice had been reduced to a gravelly whisper after an operation for throat cancers; and he was 68 years old. The Tunney campaign emphasized his youth, his energy, and adopted the slogan, “The big boys have enough friends. You need a fighter in your corner,” at once a reference to Murphy's connection with Technicolor and to Tunney's famous father.\n\nFamily Corner. The Senator, Mieke and children (Arriane, 4; Mark, 6; Teddy, 9) at home in Washington. “He comes on like a big puppy dog sometimes,” says a reporter.\n\nTo make his television ads for the campaign, Tunney hired David Garth, the best in the business. The most memorable of Garth's spots showed Tunney walking down the beach with his children, his coat slung over his shoulder. Tunney's opponents charged that the ad was designed to exploit the memory of John F. Kennedy. The charge was true, but what Tunney's supporters could have answered was that a number of men had run for public office on the basis of their connection with the Kennedys—for example, Pierre Salinger, Kenneth O'Donnell and Ted Sorensen—and resoundingly lost. Tunney's victory margin, bigger than Ronaid Reagan's, suggests that he had more going for him than an association with the Kennedys.\n\nHIS most serious problem as a politician is his surprising difficulty in communicating sincerity. Viewing Tunney on television, one almost feels that he is too much aware of his penchant for candor. He seems to be testing each phrase just before he speaks it, trying to sound firm and at the same time weighing the probable reactions of his listeners. Tunney is a man who has learned how to tap an abundant supply of nervous energy, which he can usually control and conceal, but when he speaks publicly, the tension surfaces. He seems more intense, a bit unsure of himself, somehow exposed.\n\nThe impression in some quarters that Tunney is a “lightweight” who cannot hold his own intellectually with his Senate colleagues is due, in part, to his own earnest, sometimes ingenuous manner. When he speaks on public affairs, moreover, his grasp of the topic under discussion often seems shallow. Rather than seeming to have an encyclopedic knowledge of appropriate facts, statistics and place names at his disposal, as many politicians do, he seems more like someone's college roommate engaged in an earnest bull session.\n\nAnother of his possible shortcomings is expressed by Representative James Corman, a California Democrat who supported Tunney in the Senate primary and says: “If I had to pick a weakness, it's that he tends to vacillate. I think John considers it a weakness not to take a stand on things. He considers it a weakness not to consider new facts. Because of those two things, he tends to change his mind too quickly.”\n\nTunney has changed his mind on two key issues, Vietnam (he is now a firm dove) and the SST (after first coming out against, then in favor, he finally voted against it). His change of heart on the SST in particular tends to bear out what Corman says. During his Senate campaign, Tunney said that he was opposed to the SST, then, after the election, he held aerospace hearings in Los Angeles and came out in favor of it. He says now, “I am afraid that I was somewhat confused.... At those hearings we had one witness after another come forward and say that the SST should be built and that it was going to be great employment for California and that the environmental problems could be resolved, and that it was economically feasible....But when I got back here I realized after reading the Senatorial hearings that it was not a good program and that we should use the $290‐million elsewhere.”\n\nTunney explains his change of heart on Vietnam this way: “When I went to Vietnam [as a Congressman] in 1965, I didn't know anything about the war. And I didn't know anything about the Vietnamese people. Before going over, I had the State Department, the C.I.A. and the military brief me on it, and I went there with what I thought was a fairly decent matrix of information upon which to build. When I got over there everything that I heard was the same as the Stateside briefings. It dovetailed and seemed to me to be representative of the truth. And I therefore came back a flaming hawk.\n\n“Then I met with Bernard Fall in 1966 and began to get very concerned about it at that time—not so much concerned with whether we ought to be over there or not, but very concerned about the way we were handling the situation. It was more a question of methodology than ultimate goals. I felt that we were making terrible mistakes. I also began to realize that we weren't being told the truth, because Bernard Fall had such a reservoir of knowledge that he could take the statements that were being made and ex plain them in context, with a perspective. And then in '67 1 began to seriously doubt the wisdom of our being there. John McAlister [now a political science teacher at Stanford University and author of “Vietnam: The Origins of Revolution\"], who was on my staff as a research assistant, and I began seeing a good deal of each other. He was sharply critical of the war. So in '67 I began to really change, and in '68 I campaigned as a dove.”\n\nBecause of his lack of a clearly defined political stance, along with his difficulty in communicating sincerity, his formality and his past vacillations, Tunney is often accused of being an opportunist swayed entirely by the whims of public opinion. Typical of those who hold this opinion is Mike Duberstein, former legislative assistant to George Brown and now an aide to Representative Ron Dellums, Democrat from Berkeley. “Tunney is really a straw nicn,” Duberstein says. “He kends the way he thinks the public is feeling rather than being able to take a step by himself. I've never seen him lead anything. He's the ultimate pragmatist.”\n\nBut if some consider Tunney “the ultimate pragmatist,” others are equally vehement in viewing him as a man of unusual conviction. Representative Tom Rees, a Democrat who represents a wealthy, predominantly Jewish district in Los Angeles County, argues that Tunney's six‐year voting record “was one of the two or three most courageous in the House. It's a lot tougher to represent a district like his than some others where you can compile a 100 per cent liberal record without any trouble.”\n\nThome observers have suggested that because Tunney and Democratic State chairman Chuck Manatt have been close allies in the past, Tunney will become the new boss of the party in California. This is hardly likely. Not only is it extremely difficult for a man in Washington to hold firm control over men 3,000 miles away, but Tunney is simply too gentle for the task.\n\nNonetheless, Tunney does control what is potentially one of the best Democratic organizations (made up largely of volunteers from his 1970 Senate race) within an unruly state party. He will add a young image to Muskie's primary bid in California and also bring along a few big contributors.\n\nBy endorsing Muskie, Tunney joins up early with a possible winner—without hurting his relationship with his best friend. Kennedy and Tunney stay in close touch. The two Senators see each other at least once a week and talk on the phone almost every day. Tunney reportedly journeyed to Massachusetts to huddle with Kennedy before announcing his support of Muskie.\n\nThe meaning of the endorsement may well be that Teddy, as Tunney says, is simply not interested. Perhaps he has decided that Nixon is unbeatable next year. Or perhaps he is willing to give Muskie a sporting crack at the nomination. On the face of it, though, the Tunney endorsement merely confirms what was already clear: that Kennedy will not seek the nomination in the primaries. In the event of a convention deadlock, so the theory goes, Kennedy can still agree to a draft and, if Muskie releases his delegates, Tunney will be free to move to his friend's corner.\n\nPEOPLE who try to speculate on Tunney's future often end up comparing him with the Kennedys. Bobby and Teddy particularly, they note, did not have a very solid grasp of the country's problems when they entered the Senate, but both had the good sense to recognize their deficiencies and surround themselves with knowledgeable men. In some respects, they say, the Kennedys went back to college in the Senate and re‐educated themselves. They hope that Tunney will do the same. He has hired what by Congressional standards is considered an able staff, one which has uncommonly good spirit, but it is in some ways a politically uncommitted one. Tunney's two top legislative assistants, David Cathcart and Tom Gallagher, both claim no ideological bias. Their role, they say, is to outline the choices Tunney has to make, to delineate his options.\n\nHis most serious problem as a politician is his surprising difficulty in conummisating sincerity.99\n\nThe question remains:, can a busy Senator from the most populous state find time to deepen his knowledge of the nation's problems? Tunney often goes on four or five hours of sleep a night, and his staff, which recently has been receiving 20,000 letters a week, is already overworked.\n\nStature takes time to build and Tunney is aware that he is, as is so often said of him, “still maturing.” Even in the course of the Senate campaign, he and the others around him believe he learned a great deal. His primary opponent, Brown, who was strikingly gracious in defeat, says:\n\n“From the time that I first appeared with him at a labor luncheon in the San Joaquin Valley up until the night of the general election, I could see obvious and steady progress in his ability to project himself and the nature of the ideas he was expressing. His self‐assurance and his ability to handle himself also increased.”\n\nIt is doubtful that Tunney will ever be as liberal as Brown, who was, for example, the only Congressman to vote against the military appropriations bill in 1967. Tunney has this to say about the military: “I've always thought that the vast, vast majority of military personnel are just incredibly decent people, really wonderful people. I've had marvelous associations in the Air Force and had many, many friends, and I feel very sorry that a majority of military people are being castigated as fas cists, because it just isn't true. I think that the vast majority of them are just terribly, terribly kind, decent human beings.”\n\nThis is a revealing statement, which suggests Tunney's concern for decency and, at the same time, possibly, his naivete. If the latter is true, then it also suggests how far he must go and what he must overcome. Tunney is a driven man, one who summed up his feelings on being elected to the Senate by saying, “I suppose the best way of describing it is, I feel that my spirit is very restless.” Thus, the danger is not that Tunney will fail to devote all of his vast energies to the struggle, but rather that he will not fully perceive its terms."
