        "text": "Common Name: Electric Blue Jack Dempsey Cichlid\n\nScientific Name: Rocio octofasciata\n\nOther Names: EBJD, Blue Dempsey\n\nThe Electric Blue Jack Dempsey Cichlid is a striking freshwater fish known for its vibrant electric blue coloration, which sets it apart from the standard Jack Dempsey. This variety has a metallic blue sheen that covers its entire body, with darker blue or black markings and spots scattered across its scales. They possess a robust, oval-shaped body and are known for their bold and somewhat territorial behavior. The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is a relatively new variant, selectively bred for its unique coloration, making it a highly sought-after species for aquarists.\n\nHabitat and Distribution: The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is a man-made variety, selectively bred for its vibrant blue coloration. The natural variety of this species, Rocio octofasciata, is native to Central America, specifically found in the slow-moving rivers and lakes of Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize. These fish prefer habitats with muddy or sandy bottoms, dense vegetation, and plenty of hiding spots created by rocks and submerged branches. In the wild, they thrive in warm, slightly alkaline waters with moderate flow.\n\nSize and Lifespan: In captivity, Electric Blue Jack Dempseys typically grow to about 8 inches (20 cm) in length, with males being slightly larger than females. Their lifespan can range from 8 to 10 years, depending on the care and conditions provided in the aquarium. Providing a balanced diet, clean water, and ample space can help maximize their lifespan and ensure their overall health.\n\nDiet and Behavior: Electric Blue Jack Dempseys are omnivorous and have a varied diet that includes both plant material and animal proteins. In an aquarium setting, they should be fed a diet of high-quality cichlid pellets, supplemented with frozen bloodworms, chopped raw tilapia, and occasional vegetables such as blanched spinach or peas. These fish are known for their territorial and sometimes aggressive behavior, especially during breeding. They are best kept in a well-structured tank with plenty of hiding spots to establish territories and reduce aggression.\n\nBreeding and Reproduction: Breeding Electric Blue Jack Dempseys in captivity can be challenging due to their specific environmental needs and territorial nature. They are substrate spawners and require a suitable flat surface, such as a rock or a piece of slate, for egg-laying. The female lays her eggs, which are then fertilized by the male. Both parents guard the eggs and fry aggressively, ensuring their safety. Providing a separate breeding tank with optimal water conditions and a high-quality diet can increase the success rate of raising fry.\n\nAquarium Care and Tank Requirements: To keep Electric Blue Jack Dempseys, a large aquarium of at least 55 gallons is recommended for a single fish, with a larger tank required for a pair or community setup. The tank should include plenty of rocks, caves, and plants to create hiding spots and establish territories. A sandy or fine gravel substrate is ideal, along with moderate water flow to simulate their natural habitat. Efficient filtration and regular water changes are essential to maintain water quality, as these fish are sensitive to poor conditions.\n\nIdeal Tank Mates: Electric Blue Jack Dempseys can be kept with other similarly sized, semi-aggressive fish. Suitable tank mates include other large cichlids, such as Firemouths or Convicts, as well as larger catfish and robust species like Silver Dollars. It is important to avoid housing them with smaller, more timid fish, as they may be bullied or harassed.\n\nDifficulty Level: Intermediate to Advanced. While they are hardy, their territorial nature and specific care requirements make them more suitable for experienced aquarists.\n\nWater Parameters:\n\nTemperature: 76-82°F (24-28°C)\n\npH: 6.5-8.0\n\nGeneral Hardness (GH): 8-12 dGH\n\nCarbonate Hardness (KH): 4-8 dKH\n\nAmmonia: 0 ppm (ideal), up to 0.25 ppm (max)\n\nNitrite: 0 ppm (ideal), up to 0.25 ppm (max)\n\nNitrate: <20 ppm (ideal), up to 40 ppm (max)\n\nAdditional Information:"
