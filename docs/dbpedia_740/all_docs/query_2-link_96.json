        "text": "A young Puerto Rican tapped on the restaurant win dow until Jack Dempsey turned and waved. Then the young man carefully took a cigarette out of his mouth and struck a classic boxing pose.\n\n“Hi, boy,” said Dempsey, shaking a big fist, and their eyes met and they both laughed.\n\nDempsey's partner, Jack Amiel, whispered, “How does that boy know the great Jack Dempsey? That boy can't be 21 years old. He's magic, Dempsey's magic.”\n\nA crowd gathered at the window, tourists, lunch time strollers, six student beauticians from a nearby school. The girls tapped until Dempsey, sitting on a red banquette with his back to Broadway, turned and then they sang, “Happy Birthday.” He blew them a kiss.\n\n“Magic,” said Amiel. “A guy once came up to us in the Luxor Baths and of fered Jack $5,000 to let him knock him into the pool. Just one punch. He wanted a piece of Jack's reputa tion.”\n\n“When did that hap pen?” a man at the table asked.\n\n“Last week,” said Amiel.\n\nWilliam Harrison Demp sey was 75 years old yes terday. He feels good, he says, which he attributes to clean living, honesty and being nice to people. He smokes big brown cigars, but hides them under the table when youngsters march up and thrust menus under his nose. He does not merely sign his name; he makes a social contact.\n\nA Handshake\n\n“What's your name, boy?”\n\n“Benjamin Druss.”\n\n“Better spell that last name, Benjamin.” As the boy spells it out, Dempsey writes and writes. When he fin ishes, he says, “That your grandpa over there, Benjamin?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Hi, grandpa,” calls Dempsey and as Benjamin, who is 10, whispers, “Thank you,” and begins to slip away, he grabs one of the boy's hands. “Never leave without a handshake, Benjamin.”\n\nDempsey has been sitting in the corner booth of Jack Dempsey's Restaurant, with his back to Broadway, since 1938. The restaurant is between 49th and 50th Streets, next to the Brill Building and across Broadway from the Rivoli Theater. It is about the last of the Broad way celebrity restaurants and there are usually old song writers, old prizefighters, old politicians, in a room that seats nearly 300. Dempsey is usually in his corner at lunch‐time and at dinner‐time every day.\n\nTall, gray‐haired, bright‐eyed, Dempsey enhances a legend that did not truly flower until he retired from active prizefighting in 1927. He was not a popular cham pion, but he worked very hard at being a popular ex champion. He was always available to speak, to sign autographs, to raise his hands in mock terror when some one pretended to throw a punch.\n\nSitting in the window, his back to the passing world, Dempsey seems frozen in time. He leans forward suddenly and asks, “Know who named me the Manassa Mauler? Damon Runyon. He was sports editor of the Pueblo Chief tain then and he saw me knock out George Copelin Cripple Creek.”\n\nCosts You Nothing\n\nThat was in 1915 and Dempsey was an iron bar of a man slashing through the western mining towns. Some one reminds him how vicious he was in the ring. He shakes his head. “In the ring it was for money: if you don't take him out, he'll take you. But outside I was always nice to everybody; it costs you nothing.”\n\nThere is a dignity about Dempsey, old‐fashioned and courtly, that makes his reticence to offer opinions seem wise instead of shrewd, his enthusiastic hand‐pumping gracious hospitality instead of good business. He accepts few speaking engagements, he says, to avoid making enemies of those he refuses. He realizes, he says, it was a mistake to campaign for Gene Tunney's son in a Cali fornia Congressional election several years ago: He re ceived criticism “from the other side.”\n\n“A champion,” he says, turning to wave at the ever present crowd outside the window, “owes everybody some thing. He can never pay back for all the help he got, for making him an idol.”\n\nA man rushes into the restaurant and leans across the table. “Mr. Dempsey, about 26 years ago my dad was working for you and I was going to quit school and he sent me to talk to you. I got that degree and I'm doing good now.”\n\nDempsey reached out and grasped his hand. “Thank you,” he said."
