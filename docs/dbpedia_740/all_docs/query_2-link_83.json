        "text": "Manassa – Standing in the center of Jack Dempsey’s tiny birthplace on Manassa’s Main Street recently, Michelle Richardson confessed that visitors come in streaks.\n\n“July’s our busiest month, and we can get up to 50 people in one day,” said the curator of the town-owned Jack Dempsey Museum and Park, open from the Memorial Day weekend through September. “I have had days when nobody walks through the door.”\n\nThe town’s identification with Dempsey, she said, “has started to fade a little bit, and I think that’s sad. I tell people I wish everybody loved it as much as I do, but you can’t expect everybody to.”\n\nManassa is so small – the population is barely 1,000 now, and was less than 700 when he was born in 1895 – not even Jack Dempsey could get it on all maps. But with an assist from another Colorado legend, Damon Runyon, the champ punched it right into the lexicon of American sporting and pop culture.\n\nAfter Dempsey pummeled Jess Willard in Toledo, Ohio, to win the heavyweight championship of the world on July 4, 1919, Runyon came up with a nickname for Dempsey.\n\n“The Manassa Mauler.”\n\nThrough the Roaring ’20s, when Dempsey and Babe Ruth were the most famous sporting figures in America, and through the rest of Dempsey’s life, the alliterative nickname shadowed the Colorado-born boxer.\n\nLike Dempsey, Runyon (though born in Kansas) was raised and began his professional career in Colorado, so perhaps if the raconteur-writer hadn’t come up with that nickname, nobody would have. What other influential Dempsey chronicler would have known that when Manassa had a high school its teams were called the Maulers? Who else would have been struck by the appropriateness, given Dempsey’s savagery in the ring?\n\nNearly 90 years later, the boxer who reigned as world champion until Gene Tunney dethroned him in 1926 is inexorably linked with the tiny San Luis Valley town where he was the ninth of 11 children born to Hyrum and Celia Dempsey.\n\nWherever he went, he was the Manassa Mauler, even to folks who had no idea what that meant.\n\nThere is some dispute about how long Jack and his down-on-their-luck family lived in Manassa before beginning a series of moves that took the Dempseys to a handful of other Colorado towns.\n\nDempsey himself contributed to the confusion with inconsistent remembrances, but Mormon church records show Jack was in Manassa at least as late as 1903. In one of his autobiographies – 1977’s “Dempsey” – he said that the wandering family had settled in Uncompahgre, between Telluride and Montrose, shortly after his ninth birthday in June 1904.\n\nIn a 1960 interview with writer Roger Kahn, a close friend who eventually used the material in the engaging and highly sympathetic 1999 book, “A Flame of Pure Fire,” Dempsey said he hated leaving his native town.\n\n“All the kids were upset,” Dempsey said. “Manassa was what we knew of home.”\n\nHe told Kahn, “It was terrific growing up in the Wild West. I learned to shoot, not for fun, but for food. I liked to go with my father on hunting trips. Sometimes he’d run out of ammunition, but there always was plenty of game. I learned how to set traps. I could follow deer tracks through scrubby brush. I fished in the Conejos River….I could handle horses before I was 10.”\n\nDempsey’s memorable return\n\nDempsey’s birthplace is in downtown Manassa, right on Main Street. Go past the best (and only) restaurant, Val’s Place. It’s across the street from the post office, City Hall and the kids’ shaved ice stand. It’s just before you get to the Church of Jesus Christ-Latter Day Saints and Bond’s Manassa Market.\n\nThe home on the grounds of the park doesn’t much resemble the ramshackle stucco structure in which Jack – officially William Harrison Dempsey – was born. In the mid-1960s, the town bought and moved the home several blocks to the park, also renovating it. Area residents were thrilled when Dempsey consented to be the grand marshal of the town’s annual Pioneer Days celebration in July 1966 and preside over the official dedication of the Jack Dempsey Park and Museum.\n\nForty-one years later, despite some financial crises, the museum is still open. The town commissioned a striking addition in 1999, a monument on the front walkway to the house that includes a bronze sculpture by Bob Booth of Dempsey in full fighting pose. It officially is dedicated to Dempsey’s mother – she and Hyrum were divorced long after Jack left the nest as a teenager – and carries this quote from Jack: “My mother was the most magnificent woman I ever met. I knew from the time I could walk that she deserved a better break. And I swore or vowed or prayed, or whatever it is a kid does, that I would someday make it up to her.”\n\nInside the house, when Richardson gives mini-tours to visitors – “mini” because the house, after all, is only 600 square feet – she can include her remembrances of Dempsey’s 1966 visit, featuring his ride in the parade down Main Street on a horse.\n\n“Being 9 and a girl, I didn’t really know what was going on,” she recalled. “My paternal grandmother was born in 1910, so she knew exactly who he was. As he approached her, she was waving a white handkerchief and she dropped it. He stopped his horse and climbed off, picked it up, returned it to her and kissed her hand. She was impossible the rest of the day. Just impossible. I was standing there, too, and he told me I was a pretty little girl, wished me a good day and got back on his horse.\n\n“That’s my Dempsey story. And it took me a few years to realize that not everybody has one.”\n\nMany do, though, and now that everyone who knew Dempsey from his childhood have passed on, those stories either have been handed down through generations or come from Dempsey’s 1966 visit, or both. News stories of the time emphasize that Dempsey met with dozens of his childhood friends on the visit, and the implication seems to be that he played along with whatever stories anyone had told, whether they were about fighting him when they were kids or about swimming in the Conejos.\n\n“Kid Blackie” moves on\n\nRaised on a family farm 5 miles outside of Manassa, in the Los Rincones (“the corners”) area, young Ken Salazar used to think of Manassa as the big city.\n\n“It had lights!” the Colorado senator said with a laugh from Washington.\n\nBefore attending Centauri High School in nearby La Jara, the closest high school after the home of the Manassa Maulers shut its doors for good in 1964, Salazar attended elementary school in Manassa.\n\n“There was a teacher named Mrs. Joyce, who has passed away,” Salazar said. “I remember she talked at some point about Jack Dempsey beating up her brother – sticking his face in a mud puddle.”\n\nSalazar also was on Main Street on July 23, 1966, and he vividly recalls Dempsey waving.\n\n“I thought it was pretty cool,” he said. “Here is a person who has been heavyweight champion of the world, and here he is in our little town.”\n\nSalazar said he has visited the birthplace and museum several times, including with then-Governor Roy Romer in 1987.\n\nIn City Hall recently, Town Clerk Evelyn Tibbets was wearing a Dempsey Museum and Park T-shirt.\n\n“I’m amazed at how many people do come, and how much they know about Jack Dempsey,” Tibbets said.\n\nWithin a few steps of her office, in the entranceway, a painting hangs of Dempsey in battle. It is a curious choice: In what many consider the most action-packed-per-second title fight of all time – Dempsey’s second-round victory over Luis Firpo, “The Wild Bull of the Pampas,” in 1923 – the champ has been knocked through the ropes in the first round into the arms of the writers at ringside. They shoved him back in the ring, and many argued he should have been disqualified.\n\nBut part of the deal with Dempsey is that controversy tended to follow him. Among other things, he was married four times, was (apparently unjustifiably) accused of being a “slacker” in avoiding World War I service and of dodging noted black heavyweight Harry Wills, and wasn’t above pushing the envelope of the looser boxing rules of the time.\n\nA few hard knocks were nothing for a man who, often calling himself “Kid Blackie,” literally fought his way through Colorado mining towns and saloons to get started as a professional boxer. In fact, Dempsey’s final fight, the infamous “Long Count” loss to Tunney in their 1927 rematch, in some ways sent him out of the ring as a sympathetic victim.\n\nAfter knocking down Tunney in the seventh round, Dempsey for several seconds didn’t heed the “new” rule to head to the neutral corner.\n\nIn his book on Dempsey, Kahn implied that referee Dave Barry was crooked, and that he should have picked up the knockdown timekeeper’s count at five instead of starting a new count when Dempsey finally went to the neutral corner. Tunney got up at the referee’s count of nine. No credible evidence of referee “funny business” has been unearthed, though it also raised eyebrows that Barry started counting immediately after Tunney later knocked down Dempsey, before Tunney went to a neutral corner. Yet there is universal agreement that Tunney otherwise dominated the fight.\n\nAfter retiring, Dempsey presided over one of Manhattan’s most famous watering holes, Dempsey’s Restaurant, which in its later years was at 1619 Broadway, between 49th and 50th streets. He joined Byron “Whizzer” White and Dutch Clark as the inaugural inductees in the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1965, and he maintained a touching and lifelong friendship with Colorado boxing mogul Eddie Bohn, who owned the Pig ‘N’ Whistle motel and restaurant on West Colfax. At Times Square’s low ebb, Dempsey’s restaurant closed in 1974. Dempsey died in 1983, and stories the next morning said the end came shortly after he assured his fourth wife, Deanna: “Don’t worry, honey, I’m too mean to die.”\n\nHe forever will be the Manassa Mauler."
