        "text": "IF boxing in this century, like all Gaul, were divided into three parts they would be dominated, respectively, by Jack Dempsey in the first third, by Joe Louis in the period from 1935 through World War II and into the 1950's, and finally, of course, by Muhammad Ali.\n\nFew boxing people would argue the pre-eminence of these three ring gladiators as the most influential figures in the modern day history of the sport. Dempsey helped establish boxing as a mainstream sports enterprise in this country (and around the world); Louis's destruction of racial barriers was instrumental in creating the environment that enabled black fighters to move to the top of almost every weight class (and to permeate, with phenomenal success, the ranks of most other professinal sports); Muhammad Ali became the most widely known athlete of his time, recognized in countries where even the great Pele might have gone unnoticed.\n\nThe late Nat Fleischer, boxing historian and editor-publisher for 50 years of The Ring, once said that were it not for Jack Dempsey there might never have been a Joe Louis or a Muhammad Ali, that the excitement, the thrills, the glamour, the passion-filled controversies engendered by Dempsey throughout his career were the major factors in making boxing a subject of animated discussion in every household where sports pages were read or a radio played, in every barroom in the country, every billiard parlor, every social club or fraternal branch meeting room.\n\nEven with my 50 years at ringside, I never saw Jack Dempsey in ring action. Yet it has always been the impression here that the two most significant punches ever thrown in the ring involved the great Manassa Mauler -one which had him on the receiving end, the other that he threw and even now, after more than a half century, is provocative.\n\nThe first of these momentous blows was struck by Luis Angel Firpo, nicknamed the Wild Bull of the Pampas, a 216-pound slugger from Argentina who could not, as is said in boxing, fight a lick but could punch with sledgehammer force.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1923, in a heavyweight title bout at the Polo Grounds in New York, Firpo survived seven first-round knockdowns and then, summoning all the power he could command, smashed a thunderous right to Dempsey's jaw, sending the champion flying through the ropes onto the laps and typewriters of the reporters at ringside. Somehow the writers pushed Dempsey back into the ring before the referee, Jack Gallagher, could complete the knockout count.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
