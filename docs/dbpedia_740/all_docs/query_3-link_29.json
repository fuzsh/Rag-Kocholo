        "text": "Scientific Name: Nandopsis octofasciatum\n\nCommon Name: Dempsey Cichlid, Jack Dempsey Fish\n\nAdult Size: 10 inches\n\nLife Expectancy: 10 -15 years\n\nHabitat: North and Central America; Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Yucatan, and Honduras\n\nMinimum Tank Size: 50 gallons\n\nIdeal Tank Conditions:\n\nTemperature Range: 75 - 82Â°F\n\npH Range: 7.0 - 8.0\n\nWater Hardness: 5 - 15\n\nTemperament: Semi-aggressive. The Jack Dempsey has demonstrated a tolerant attitude towards tankmates. That being said, as this fish ages it can tend to become more territorial and aggressive, especially when it is time for them to spawn. If they become too aggressive to co-habitat with the other members of the tank, it is recommended they be transferred to a species only tank. If keeping more than one, it is easier and safer for them to keep them in large groups rather than in pairs.\n\nDiet & Nutrition: Omnivore, will eat flakes, pellets, freeze dried and live foods. Give them a varied diet with lots of protein.\n\nBreeding & Spawning: The Jack Dempsey Cichlid has been bred in captivity. They are one of the easiest cichlids to get to spawn but as pairs they can become territorial, intolerant, and biters. The Dempsey fish are egg layers. The female will lay 500-800 eggs on carefully cleaned rocks. They form a nuclear family. The fry are kept in pits and are guarded by both the male and female in the manner of \"monogamous cichlid\" breeders.\n\nGender: The male has a longer and more pointed dorsal fin than the female. The male may also have a round black spot in the center of the body and at the base of the tail. The female has fewer spots than the male."
