        "text": "This care guide has everything every aquarist need to know about the Jack Dempsey fish.\n\nIf you are about to buy the fish and wondering if it’s the right fish for you, then this is your perfect guide.\n\nKeep reading.\n\nClassifications\n\nThe fish that’s also known as Rocio octofasciata or previously known as Cichlasoma octofasciatum scientifically was first coined by Regan in the year of 1903.\n\nBy now, you might be wondering why the fish is called Jack Dempsey?\n\nIs the fish somehow related to the famous Jack Dempsey professional boxer?\n\nThe fish itself has no “connection” with the boxer, but because of its aggressiveness towards its fellow tank mates, people started calling it Jack Dempsey.\n\nScientific nameRocio octofasciata (previously known as Cichlasoma octofasciatum)FamilyCichlidaeGenusCichlasomaSpeciesoctofasciatum\n\nScientific Name Origin\n\nThe origins of scientific names of the fishes we like is always an interesting topic to discuss.\n\nThe very first namer didn’t coin the name Rocio, but it was his wife’s idea.\n\nThe word Rocio is a Spanish word, which if translated into English means “dew.”\n\nAnd it’s easy to guess we it’s named after “dew,” simply because of the fish’ great sparkle-spots.\n\nNot only the first scientific name has its origin, its last name also came from an interesting idea.\n\nThe name “octofasciata” is composed of 2 parts: “octo” and “fascie“. Octo means eight and fascie means stripe. If we combine both, it means “Eight-striped.”\n\nMaybe the Jack Dempsey fish they had had eight-striped, so they named it with the name. Today’s Jack Dempsey fish have more than eight stripes in common.\n\nDistribution\n\nYou can easily find the fish in North and Central America; Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Yucatan, and Honduras.\n\nTo be more specific, you can find them in the Papaloapán River (Mexico) and Ulua River (Honduras). See the map to find the live locations.\n\nHabitat\n\nBugs and swamps (warm waters) are their favorite habitats.\n\nIf you want to find them in the wild, make sure you search them among the weeds in bottom.\n\nSize\n\nRocio octofasciata is a large fish. The fish can reach up to 10 inches in length (25.40 cm). That’s why you have to keep them in a large tank.\n\nIn the wild, the male Jack Dempsey Cichlids are found to be smaller. The most common size is 12 – 15cm or 4.72 – 5.91 inches long.\n\nTank\n\nBecause of its aggressiveness, I recommend you to keep the fish with its kind in a large tank (preferably 50 gallon or 189 liters).\n\nSome sources even said that one Jack Dempsey fish requires the whole 50-gallon tank, so if you want to keep more than one, then a larger tank is recommended.\n\nMinimum Tank Size50 gal/189 LSubstrate TypeSandLighting NeedsModerateTemperature22.2 to 30.0° C (72 to 86° F)Range ph 6.5 – 7.0Hardness Range 8 – 12 dGH\n\nMaintenance\n\nMaintenance is rather simple for this fish.\n\nAll you need to do is to regularly change the water and feeding them with the correct food, the fish should do fine.\n\nWater Conditions\n\nYou should always remember that the fish is perfect for beginners, not because it requires its “personal” tank and can’t have tank mates from different species, but because of its sturdiness.\n\nThe fish is very hardy concerning water conditions demand. But of course, the water change should be done regularly; I recommend you to change it every two weeks (bi-weekly).\n\nFood\n\nEven though they are omnivore, these cichlids are well-known predators.\n\nThey are relatively greedy that will accept most of the foods given. But of course, trying a variety will help them to prevent stress.\n\nThe everyday food you can feed them is blood worm, brine shrimp, milled seafood, and tubifex.\n\nAccording to Meethepet, you can also feed them with plants like cabbage, blowball leaves, and lettuce. Make sure to boil them first.\n\nWhen giving them a new kind of food, please be patient when they don’t seem to accept it, it will take time for them to realize that what you give is food for them.\n\nI recommend you to feed them only once a day.\n\nOverfeeding is a must to avoid.\n\nFirst, they can result in lethal changes in the water chemistry. The breakdown products are toxic and can stress fish, making them prone to other diseases. Overeating, itself, can cause health problems. Finally, the pond or tank can become very unsightly, not pleasing to the eye, or the fish.\n\n– Veterinary & Aquatic Services Department, Drs. Foster & Smith\n\nBreeding\n\nBefore we talk about the breeding tips and tricks, you should understand that differences between the male and female.\n\nThe male is known to be larger and has a brighter color than the female. When the fish reached adulthood, you can find sparkles covering their whole body.\n\nThe male’s genital papilla is called antrorse, and it looks like a firing hammer. While the female’s looks like an upside-down cone.\n\nAppearance-wise, the male should have a more pointed dorsal fin. Black spots are often found in the center of the male’s body and somewhere around the base of the tail.\n\nThe female, on the other hand, has fewer spots, and often found in the dorsal fin and lower edge of the gill cover.\n\nBreeding tips\n\nThe recommended temperature when breeding is 86.0° F or 30° C.\n\nYou should remember that Rocio octofasciata is an egg layer type of fish. For every eggs-laying, the female can produce 500 to 800 eggs. The most common place to lay these eggs on is a cleaned rock. So make sure that your breeding tank has cleaned rocks in it.\n\nOnce the eggs hatched, both the male and female will guard their fries.\n\nJack Dempsey Cichlid Gallery\n\nCommon Questions\n\nQ: How long do jack dempseys live?\n\nA: In common, they can live for up to 10 – 15 years.\n\nQ: How fast is the jack dempsey cichlid’s growth rate?\n\nA: We have done a couple of researches in different online forums, most respondents say that Jack dempseys grow relatively slow.\n\nA three-year-old spans 9 inches, and 21 month old spans about 7 inches.\n\nQ: Where can I buy jack dempsey fish?\n\nA: The fish is widely sold in the local market and online stores.\n\nQ: How many Jack dempsey variants are there?\n\nA: Like any other aquarium fish, this fish has multiple color options.
