(Courtesy of Cynthia Harris)\n\n(Reena Rose Sibayan | The Jersey Journal)\n\nJack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier were barely back in their dressing rooms when The Jersey Journal presses began humming with a special edition.\n\nIn front of more than 92,000 fans, Dempsey knocked out Carpentier at Boyle's Thirty Acres (what is now Montgomery Street and Florence Place in Jersey City) on July 2, 1921, in a championship bout that is most remembered as the sport's first million-dollar box office. In fact, the $1.8 million take from the heavyweight fight was double the previous record-setter.\n\nAs the Journal proudly stated three days later, \"Sixteen minutes after Dempsey had delivered the knockout punch, The Jersey Journal was out on the streets being gobbled up by anxious readers. Ordinarily, The Jersey Journal would not boast of an accomplishment of this sort, but there is special satisfaction in serving its loyal army of readers so well, inasmuch as our newspaper brethren in the big city across the Hudson had predicted they would 'beat' The Jersey Journal on its own ground.\"\n\nLike Dempsey, the Journal won the day, beating the competition by a good hour and selling a record number of special-edition newspapers.\n\nWhile promoter Tex Rickard went down in history as the mastermind behind boxing biggest box-office hit, the Jersey City Chamber of Commerce deserved a big assist.\n\nA brochure created to promote the bout included a map of the Montgomery Park area, a drawing of the arena to help people purchase tickets and a sales pitch that pointed out Jersey City was a great place to locate \"your factory or warehouse ... next to the largest city in the world.\"\n\nThe special eight-page edition detailed everything about the fight - down to Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague jumping into the ring after he was introduced to shake hands with both fighters. Like a true politician, Hague then introduced Gov. Edward I. Edwards, who also then scooted into the ring and shook hands with the combatants before the bout got underway.\n\nDempsey retained his world heavyweight title with a fourth-round knockout.\n\nThe Jersey Journal described the end like this:\n\n\"Dempsey stood over the fallen French idol until the count was finished and then tenderly picked up the bleeding and dazed Frenchman and dragged him to his corner.''\n\nEditor's note: This piece examines one of Hudson County's top 25 news stories since The Jersey Journal's founding in 1867, as selected by the paper's editorial staff and local historians."
