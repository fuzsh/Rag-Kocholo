        "text": "Boxing promoter George “Tex” Rickard, knew that bringing his client, world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, 26, into the ring to defend his title against world light heavyweight champion Georges Carpentier, 27, would draw a big crowd. But he faced the challenge on where to host the epic match, that is until Mayor Frank Hague built him an amphitheater, the largest at the time, in the heart of Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\n“In making the rounds of the cities which he has named as the possible sites for the Dempsey-Carpentier fight on July 2, Tex Rickard yesterday paid a visit to Jersey City where he was the guest of Mayor Frank Hague at a luncheon at the Elks' Club, Jersey City.\" - New York Times, April 1921\n\nIn the 1890s the field called Montgomery Oval had been the home of a Jersey City baseball team in the old Eastern League. But by April 26, 1921 when Rickard walked onto the neglected land that Mayor Hague was pitching him, it was nothing more than a section of swampland in the middle of Jersey City, so recently filled in with garbage that it was still cluttered with rubble and refuse, tin cans, glass, and broken boards.\n\nIt was out of that rubble in the course of only two months that Boyle's Thirty Acres, a stadium that became known to the world as the site of the second-best boxing match in history behind David and Goliath, was built.\n\nthe First Citizen of Lens, was a natural hero. Wounded twice during the war and decorated with both the French Médaille Militaire and the Croix de Guerre with palm Carpentier was the idol of all women. The fight was credited as the first boxing match in which women were allowed to attend. \"I hope Carpentier wins,\" people said, \"but I'm afraid Dempsey will knock his block off.\" Rickard, determined to put on an epic show, fed the press the narrative of a fight between the handsome French war hero, Carpentier, and the American draft dodger.\n\nThe fight was a glaring mismatch, but spectators were so engrossed in the emotionally charged battle of \"good guy vs bad guy\" that Carpentier's mediocre record and light-heavyweight body (a frail-looking 172 pounds against Dempsey's 188) seemed almost unnoticed. The New York Times cast the Frenchman as not only the representative of his country but of the \"millions of soldiers who had fought in the trenches.\"\n\nAt Boyle's, 2,900 police, firemen, plainclothes men and private ushers waited to handle the crush of spectators scheduled to arrive, setting up blockades four blocks away from the stadium, letting only properly accredited people into the menagerie.\n\nAs Carpentier entered the arena to the accompaniment of wild cheers, Up in section H, back in the $5.50 seats where the final additions were built, stadium started to sway.\n\n\"There was just a movement,\" an engineer who helped build the stands said \"Let's not make a big thing out of it. There was a movement, a decided sway. But there was really never any danger of the stadium collapsing. None.\"\n\nThe people in the stands at the time were far from convinced. \"Everybody stay down,\" one man shouted. Then he turned to a policeman. \"If you police can't make them sit down, club them down.\"\n\nThe New York Times ran an eight-column banner on its front page the following day and filled six of its eight news columns with stories about the fight. The next 12 pages were filled with only fight stories and pictures. As if in apology, the staid old journal editorialized that same day, \"The world may now gain its equipoise.\"Three days later a group of engineers checked the stadium and found it safe.\n\nIn the contest between Dempsey and Carpentier, the strength and power of Dempsey was too much for the Frenchman, who was knocked out in the fourth round, with a broken thumb.\n\nJersey City Makes History\n\nThe Dempsey-Carpentier bout in July 1921 is remembered by radio historians as one of the major occasions that helped usher in the \"radio era\" and mass communication. Developing into a trend in which big sporting events would be the catalyst of introducing new technology or expanded capability. Now with billions being able to access live streaming from around the world, on that day in July 1921 hundreds of thousands tuned in to hear the human voice beam out over the northeast United States for the first time.\n\nSome more Background\n\nIt held approximately 80,000 fans and was built at a cost of $250,000. It was situated around Montgomery Street and Cornelian Avenue, on a plot of marshland owned by John F. Boyle. It stood for six more years, until Rickard had it torn down.\n\nTex Rickard, the promoter of the bout, initially wanted the fight to take place at the Polo Grounds in New York City. However, Nathan Lewis Miller, the governor of New York, opposed prizefighting and indicated that he did not want a Dempsey-Carpentier bout to be held in New York State\n\nConstruction started on April 28, 1921 and was completed a few days before the fight. The arena was initially due to hold 50,000 fans. However, the demand for the international extravaganza was so enormous that Rickard had to expand the arena to hold a capacity of around 80,000 to 90,000 fans. It had the greatest seating capacity of any amphitheater ever built.\n\nBy 1927, 6 years after it was built, Rickard announced that the wooden arena would be demolished and in June 1927 the wrecking ball brought the short history of Boyle's Thirty Acres to an end.\n\nSite of Boyle’s Thirty Acres Today\n\nToday, Boyle's Thirty Acres are lost in the middle of a housing project, the only echo of their sporting past lying in the shouts of the kids from neighboring Ferris High School.By 1952, the site of Boyle's Thirty Acres had become a Jersey City housing project named Montgomery Gardens. After over 50 years of use, the project began to be emptied and the Jersey City Housing Authority planned to demolish the buildings in order to build mixed-use housing. Three of the six buildings were imploded in August 2015, and one was rehabilitated and converted to senior housing."
