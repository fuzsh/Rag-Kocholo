Is it okay to feed him as much as he'll eat? i mix up the foods, brine shrimp, bloodworms, regular worms, pellet foods, and flakes. hes fat as hell and really dark and aggressive. IS there a problem getting him to fat? I have plants in the tank, live sand and a cascade 1500 (i think) filter filled with bio ceramic media.\n\nIs this true in the wild too? Do the fish that eat more die off faster?\n\nAquarium conditions are not the same as wild conditions. High protein/fat prepared fish food, even fed sparingly, is more nutrition than any fish could ever get in the wild.\n\nThen consider that aquarium fish do not need to work to get their food and often will not have room to burn off all those extra calories (especially large fish like dempseys).\n\nSort of like people I guess... keep someone in their house for their whole life and feed them cheeseburgers for every meal. Ain't going to turn out well.\n\nI agree with Tony.â€¦ If you do 50-60% weekly water changes, offer a large selection of different fish foods like pellets, flakes, frozen, live (bugs, worms) and feeding these in decent amounts twice daily throughout the week you will be awarded a nice large healthy fish in no time."
