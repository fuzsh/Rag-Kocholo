        "text": "Jack Dempseys are one of the most well known cichlids. They are infamous for their aggression and don’t play well with others, but that does not mean they can’t be kept in groups, or even with other species. Those who know how to handle their aggressive nature can create a thriving aquarium, but those that don’t, will struggle to stop them harassing their tank mates – so they are not recommended for beginners. Minimum tank size 200 to 300 litres.\n\nThis species is not the best option for newcomers to fishkeeping.\n\nJack Dempseys (Rocio octofasciata) originate in North and Central America, such as Mexico and Honduras. A common name is Mexican Blue Frontosa.\n\nBehaviour\n\nWhen kept properly, this carnivorous fish introduces various colors and plenty of activity to your tank. They tend to be less aggressive in well populated tanks because it’s harder for them to single out and pick on stray fish. A male will try to establish a territory and will fend off other individuals. If you have plenty of caves and crevices to form different territories, there will be few territory disputes. Mostly they will stay in the middle and lower levels of the tank. They tend to be less aggressive in well populated tanks because it’s harder for them to single out and pick on stray fish.\n\nTank Conditions\n\nEach fish will need at least 55 gallons (200 litres) of water, but they will appreciate more space. Remember these fish are aggressive and need their own territory so give them each a spot to hideaway.\n\nAvoid bright lights or your Jack Dempseys will just hide away. Their natural water would be slightly murky so use some dimmer lights. Floating plants (like hornwort) can be used to shade certain areas.\n\nStarting at the bottom of the tank, pick a soft sandy substrate since Jack Dempseys spends lots of their time in the lower levels of the water. When adding decorations, make sure you have multiple caves spread around the tank so that your fish can find and claim their own territories. You can add plants too as they don’t usually destroy them. However you might find that one day they decide they do not like the plants in the tank and have destroyed them. Be careful to check that any other species you keep won’t destroy them either.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe aggressive nature of Jack Dempseys can be quite restrictive when looking for tank mates, but that does not mean there aren’t some good options out there. Tank mates generally need to be a similar size with the same aggressive temperament. This means that no fish can fit in another’s mouth, and everyone can defend themselves. Oscar fish are a popular option as are Mbuna cichlids. Other choices include: Angelfish, Birchir, Blue Acara, Clown loaches, Convict Cichlids, Firemouth Cichlids, Plecostomus, and Silver Dollars.\n\nFeeding\n\nAs carnivorous fish, a Jack Dempsey’s diet would normally consist of anything meaty that they can fit into their mouths. They can quickly grab worms, crustaceans, insects and small fish. They are not picky eaters so you can choose what is easiest for you. Processed dried foods are generally cheaper and readily available. You can find pellets and flakes designed specifically for cichlids. If you are going to use processed foods, pick some additional frozen/live foods to add into the tank occasionally – this will help give them a range of nutrients. Popular options include bloodworms and brine shrimps. Larger insects like crickets, grasshoppers, and fruit flies will go down very well with your Jack Dempseys.\n\nHerbivorous foods will mostly be rejected, which is why you can keep live plants in the tank with a low risk of them being eaten.\n\nCare\n\nJack Dempseys have simple care requirements. The problems start when you keep a group or mix them with other species. Handling their aggression can be difficult if you haven’t kept aggressive cichlids before.\n\nIf cared for poorly, your Jack Dempseys will start harassing each other and other species. However, if the aggression is handled properly, it is not difficult to keep them healthy. They can get diseases just like all other freshwater fish. One of the most common issues is Ich (white spot disease) – this is an ectoparasite that appears as white nodules on the body and fins. Raising the water temperature in your tank to 86°F can help to treat the disease.\n\nAnother common disease is Head and Lateral Line Erosion (HLLE). This forms pits or cavities on the head. It is usually caused by poor nutrition, so you will need to change their diet if you spot it.\n\nAn unhealthy environment usually promotes disease, so you need to keep the tank clean. Anything you add to an established tank can bring disease with it so quarantining new additions is a must."
