        "text": "Rocio octofasciata – Jack Dempsey\n\nRocio octofasciata was described by Regan in 1903. The genus name Rocio was drawn up in 2007 by Schmitter-Soto. The name ‘rocío’ means ‘morning dew’ in Spanish. This is a reference to the spots on the cheek and flank of some species. It is also the first name of J.J. Schmitter-Soto’s wife.\n\nSynonyms\n\nOver the years, this species has been redescribed many times and therefore has many synonyms: Nandopsis octofasciatus, Heros octofasciatus, Archocentrus octofasciatus, Cichlasoma biocellatum, Cichlasoma hedricki, Cichlasoma octofasciatum, Cichlasoma octofasciatus, Cichlosoma biocellatum, Parapetenia octofasciata\n\nDescription\n\nRocio octofasciata can reach a length of 20 centimeters. These fish have spectacular colors, they have a light gray base color, with lots of blue and green speckles all over their bodies, and red edges on their fins. Females have the same colors, only less speckled.\n\nThe species has been a well-known appearance in aquariums since 1904. Through selective breeding, different breeding variants are also available, such as the Electric blue Dempsey with a bright blue base color, and the Gold Dempsey, with a pale metallic gold base color and gold-colored speckles on the cheeks. However, these two color variants are still very rare in the hobby. Rocio gemmata looks very similar to Rocio octofasciata but remains much smaller.\n\nCharacter\n\nThis aggressive cichlid is named after legendary boxing champion Jack Dempsey. They are very territorial and can only be kept together with other robust cichlids, and it remains to be seen whether this will go well. During the breeding period they are very aggressive and will not tolerate other fish in the area.\n\nOrigin\n\nRocio octofasciata can be found in southern Mexico, Honduras, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula. They occur in the basin from the Rio Papaloapán in southern Mexico to the Ulua River in Honduras.\n\nThe aquarium\n\nJack Dempseys require an aquarium of at least 2 meters. Furnish the aquarium with hard plants, rocks and driftwood so that there are sufficient hiding places. The plants are best anchored in a flower pot in the ground, because the Jack Dempsey likes to root around in the ground. Sand or fine round gravel can be used as a substrate, but not sharp gravel, otherwise they could injure themselves. It is advisable to provide a powerful filter and to change the water regularly, they are also quite messy eaters.\n\nWater parameters\n\nTemperature: 22-25 degrees Celsius.\n\npH: 6,5-7\n\nGH: 8-12\n\nDiet\n\nBoth live food and frozen food can be given as food, such as mosquito larvae, insects, earthworms, shrimps and pieces of beef heart, cichlid sticks are also accepted.\n\nBreeding Rocio octofasciata – Jack Dempsey\n\nThe breeding of the Jack Dempsey is quite simple, it is best to start with a group of young fish, from which a good couple can later be formed. Up to about 800 eggs are laid and fertilized on a flat, polished rock. After 3 to 5 days the eggs hatch and the young are intensively protected and cared for by both parents.\n\nThe parents try to protect the young fish from other fish that young fish for a snack. In an aquarium with some hiding places where protection is easier, there will always be a few fry left. The parents also ensure that the young Jack Dempseys get enough to eat.\n\nIf you want to keep more young, you can remove part of the nest. The fry can be raised with brine shrimp nauplii. When they are a bit bigger you can switch to a different food.\n\nIn any case, do not empty the entire nest of the Rocio octofasciata. The parents then become confused and may focus their aggression on each other. Always leave a few young fish with the parents to distract them.\n\nVideo\n\nAuthors\n\nCoby\n\nJ. de Lange\n\nCopyright images\n\nHélène Lagueux\n\nJ. de Lange\n\nReferences"
