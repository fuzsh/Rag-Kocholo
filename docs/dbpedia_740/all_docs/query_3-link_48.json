        "text": "The Jack Dempsey (Rocio octofasciata ) also known as the Powder Blue Jack Dempsey, is an almost unbelievably bright blue colour variant of its species. For a time, it was believed to possibly be a hybrid of the Jack Dempsey Cichlid and another New World cichlid species, but the current general consensus is that it is a natural colour mutation that was isolated and developed within the original species. This variant is relatively new to the hobby, but it has now been selectively cultivated long enough to produce much healthier, consistent offspring than those that existed in the early years of development. The Electric Blue Jack Dempsey is typically more docile and attains a smaller size than \"wild colour\" individuals of the species.\n\nThe Jack Dempsey Cichlid will thrive in an aquarium with a sandy substrate and plenty of refuge such as clay pots, driftwood, and rock formations. It typically will not eat ornamental plants, but it does like to do a fair amount of digging, so plants that attach to driftwood and rockwork are recommended. As mentioned before, this color variant is typically not nearly as aggressive as the typical \"wild colour\" Jack Dempsey, so it is often compatible with other peaceful and semi-aggressive fish too large to be considered prey. Territoriality is typically at its peak during spawning. Dwarf shrimp and other small, delicate invertebrates should not be kept with the Jack Dempsey Cichlid. This fish can attain a considerable size of up to 8 inches (20 cm), so most ornamental invertebrates will eventually be considered prey. If spawning is desired, tank mates of other species should be kept to a minimum or avoided altogether.\n\nFeeding is simple for the unfussy Jack Dempsey Cichlid. High-quality dry, frozen, and live meaty foods will all be readily accepted. Supplemental vegetable matter is also required. Quality and variety are the keys to a diet that will ensure that this fish maintains optimal health and coloration.\n\nWe are offering young specimens of this magnificent fish. They are already displaying superb coloration for their size.\n\nWhat We Like About This Fish:\n\nBeautiful electric blue and black marbling across the entire body\n\nVery hardy with plenty of personality\n\nPossible to breed in the aquarium\n\nCompatible with many other species in a spacious tank\n\nPotential to be a \"centerpiece\" fish\n\nRECOMMENDED TANK PARAMETERS:\n\nTemperature: 68° - 86° F (20° - 30° C)\n\npH: 6.0 - 7.2\n\nKH: 0 - 10 KH\n\nMinimum tank size: 30+ gallons for a pair.\n\nCARE GUIDELINES:"
