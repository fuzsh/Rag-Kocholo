        "text": "Photo Credits: Canadian Colour\n\nWe in The West are in love with the iconic antihero, from the lovable lout The Tramp, played with ebullient charm by Charlie Chaplin to John Wayne’s shoot first question later gunslinger. Or the grizzled ruggedly handsome Harrison Ford who gave us Indiana Jones and Han Solo.\n\nWe love our heroes with scratches and scars. Imperfect and troubled.\n\nWe love our Angels with a dirty face.\n\nJack Dempsey was our first antihero.\n\nA man who symbolized our strength and resilience.\n\nA man of ferocity, who for those trapped in meager circumstances and powerless to fight back could live vicariously through.\n\nThe Manassa Mauler\n\nWilliam Harrison Dempsey was born in 1895. One of 13 children.\n\nHe adored his Mother.\n\nHis father Hyrum was shiftless. A drifter & failed at nearly everything to which he put his hand.\n\nLately, that was prospecting for gold & so the family moved out west to Manassa, Colorado.\n\nThe Dempsey’s lived in squalor.\n\nJack later recalled the embarrassment of his mother at being unable to pay the train conductor for the stage coach ride.\n\nJack resolved that would never happen again.\n\nYoung Jack took odd jobs as a laborer. However, the family was always desperate for money.\n\nSo, Jack would walk into saloons exclaiming \"I can't sing and I can't dance, but I can lick any SOB in the house.\"\n\nAnd he did.\n\nCrisscrossing the nation from Nevada to New York often riding in hobo cars Dempsey fought every single man he could.\n\nFinally, on July 4th, 1919. Independence Day. Dempsey challenged Jess Willard for the Heavyweight Title.\n\nWillard had somehow beaten the great Jack Johnson.\n\nThe Pottawattamie Giant. Six-feet-six-and-a-half inches tall. Weighting 245 pounds.\n\nDempsey was five-foot-eleven. Maybe six feet. Depending on which account you read.\n\nAnd at best 195 pounds.\n\nThe literal manifestation of David versus Goliath.\n\nAnd what followed was one of the most savage beatings in boxing history.\n\nWillard was down seven times in just the first round.\n\nDempsey stood over the giant, snarling.\n\nThere was no neutral corner rule then. Jack would win at all costs.\n\nA broken jaw, facial fractures, broken ribs and missing teeth is what Willard got for his trouble.\n\nDempsey got the title.\n\nThe Golden Age – The Roaring Twenties\n\nIt was a time of gangsters, speakeasies and bathtub gin.\n\nBabe Ruth smacked ‘em outta the park.\n\nAnd Jack Dempsey was heavyweight champion of the world.\n\nIf you were some Mick living in the Bowery guaranteed there were two portraits in your home: Jesus Christ and Jack Dempsey.\n\nWorld War I was behind us. However, the memories were raw.\n\nEveryman was to do his part.\n\nChallenger Georges Carpentier was a war hero.\n\nDempsey was labeled a slacker. A black mark that stayed with him all his life.\n\nTex Rickard shrewdly promoted the fight as the War Hero against the Black Hat.\n\nJuly 2nd, 1921 at Boyle’s Thirty Acres 91,000 people attended Dempsey vs. Carpentier.\n\nDempsey won in the 4th.\n\nThe painter George Bellows would immortalize the slugfest between Jack Dempsey and Luis Angel Firpo.\n\nDempsey was knocked off his feet, out of the ring, nearly landing on the floor in the 1st round.\n\nPhoto Credits: Francis G. Mayer\n\nDempsey came back – charging like a wounded animal and stopped Firpo in the 2nd by Kayo.\n\nJack Dempsey was the most famous athlete in the world.\n\nDempsey was Champ for nearly seven years and took on all contenders – all white contenders.\n\nDempsey would not take on black fighters.\n\nJack Johnson had offended America’s delicate sensibilities. There was no appetite for another Black Champion.\n\nSo, contender Harry Wills never got his shot.\n\nA Bon Vivant\n\nJack Dempsey was rich. Popular.\n\nAfter growing up and living through such deprivation early in life Dempsey became Jack.\n\nHe partied and spent money that flowed like liquor. He starred in the serial Daredevil.\n\nHe did endorsements and traveled the world.\n\nHe married Estelle Taylor. A lady of the evening who’d been Dempsey’s constant companion since his days bouncing in brothels.\n\nFew challenges to Dempsey’s title existed.\n\nLife threw the most telling blows.\n\nDempsey lost his brother Bruce years before. He’d been stabbed to death during a fight.\n\nThen his brother John shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself.\n\nHoney I Forgot to duck\n\nThe beast in Dempsey's belly wouldn't rest.\n\nWaiting in the wings now was The Fighting Marine Gene Tunney – in his prime.\n\nDempsey was never a technician, he had guts. He had guile.\n\nThe living personification of unbridled violence.\n\nBut the game has changed.\n\nTunney was a brilliant boxer.\n\nDempsey lost.\n\nWhen Dempsey retired to his dressing room his wife was aghast at his appearance.\n\nDempsey said only “Honey I forgot to duck.”\n\nWith that, Dempsey took off the black hat forever & endeared himself to the public.\n\nDempsey was not done yet.\n\nHe faced Jack Sharkey for a shot at the rematch with Tunney.\n\nDempsey was aging… not gone.\n\nSharkey ended up on the business end of left hook ending a fight he’d been winning.\n\nThe Long Count\n\nOne year later millions listened by their radios & many thousands attended the fight at Soldier Field.\n\nDempsey was losing again when he knocked Tunney down…\n\n1, Dempsey’s blood is up.\n\n2, he stands over Tunney.\n\n3, referee Dave Barry attempts to separate the men.\n\n4, Dempsey won't back off.\n\n5, The dog is coming out again.\n\n6, Relentless.\n\n7, Barry moves Dempsey to a neutral corner.\n\n8, 9, 10…11, 12, 13…\n\nBarry fails to keep time and restarts the count at 1…\n\nTunney rises and battles back & wins the next two rounds.\n\nTunney remains champion.\n\nDempsey raised his foes hand & congratulated Tunney.\n\n\"You were best. You fought a smart fight, kid.\"\n\nDempsey retired.\n\nDempsey. Icon.\n\nDempsey had passed to the next phase in his life – the elder statesman!\n\nOn the corner of 8th avenue & 50th street Dempsey opened Jack Dempsey’s Restaurant.\n\nWide eyed tourists came from all over for three attractions: the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn bridge & Jack Dempsey.\n\nHe always had a kind word, a clap on the back, he never said no to an autograph or request for a picture.\n\nJack would always make an effort to leave a personal message.\n\n“Keep punching!! Yours, Jack Dempsey.”\n\nIn 1971 two thugs mistook Dempsey for easy pickings & tried to rob him.\n\nEven as an elderly man Dempsey possessed a mighty punch. He laid both men out.\n\nThey remained on the ground until police arrived out of fear.\n\nJack would say to his wife Deanna “don't worry honey, I'm too mean to die!”\n\nThose would be his last words.\n\nWith the passing of Jack Dempsey the Golden Age of boxing finally passed on as well.\n\nMore than that the last light of bygone era faded away also.\n\nA time of bunkhouses, stage coaches, saloons & steam whistles & wide open country…\n\nThe Old West was finally gone… there were no tough guys anymore.\n\nMen who made their living by their wits & by the steely resolve of the guns and the cards they drew.\n\n4 min"
