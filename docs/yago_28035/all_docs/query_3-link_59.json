        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nAs Queen Margaret persuades the French king Lewis to support her and Prince Edward, Warwick arrives with the offer of marriage from King Edward to Lady Bona. The offer is accepted, and Lewis promises to support King Edward. News then arrives of King Edward’s marriage to Lady Grey. Lewis shifts his support once more to Margaret, and Warwick, humiliated, turns against Edward. Preparations are made for Warwick to lead French troops against Edward, with Margaret following later with another large French army.\n\nFlourish. Enter Lewis the French king, his sister\n\n⌜the Lady⌝ Bona, his Admiral called Bourbon,\n\nPrince Edward, Queen Margaret, and the Earl of Oxford,\n\n⌜the last three wearing the red rose.⌝\n\nLewis sits, and riseth up again.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1605 Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,\n\n1606 Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state\n\n1607 And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis\n\n1608 doth sit.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1609 5 No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret\n\n1610 Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve\n\n1611 Where kings command. I was, I must confess,\n\n1612 Great Albion’s queen in former golden days,\n\n1613 But now mischance hath trod my title down\n\n1614 10 And with dishonor laid me on the ground,\n\n1615 Where I must take like seat unto my fortune\n\n1616 And to my humble seat conform myself.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1617 Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep\n\n1618 despair?\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1619 15 From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears\n\n1620 And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares.\n\np. 141\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1621 Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself,\n\n1622 And sit thee by our side.Seats her by him.\n\n1623 Yield not thy neck\n\n1624 20 To Fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind\n\n1625 Still ride in triumph over all mischance.\n\n1626 Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief.\n\n1627 It shall be eased if France can yield relief.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1628 Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts\n\n1629 25 And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.\n\n1630 Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis\n\n1631 That Henry, sole possessor of my love,\n\n1632 Is, of a king, become a banished man\n\n1633 And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;\n\n1634 30 While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,\n\n1635 Usurps the regal title and the seat\n\n1636 Of England’s true-anointed lawful king.\n\n1637 This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,\n\n1638 With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,\n\n1639 35 Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;\n\n1640 And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.\n\n1641 Scotland hath will to help but cannot help;\n\n1642 Our people and our peers are both misled,\n\n1643 Our treasure seized, our soldiers put to flight,\n\n1644 40 And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1645 Renownèd queen, with patience calm the storm\n\n1646 While we bethink a means to break it off.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1647 The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1648 The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1649 45 O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.\n\np. 143\n\nEnter Warwick, ⌜wearing the white rose.⌝\n\n1650 And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1651 What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1652 Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.\n\nKING LEWIS, ⌜standing⌝\n\n1653 Welcome, brave Warwick. What brings thee to France?\n\nHe descends. She ariseth.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1654 50 Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,\n\n1655 For this is he that moves both wind and tide.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1656 From worthy Edward, King of Albion,\n\n1657 My lord and sovereign and thy vowèd friend,\n\n1658 I come in kindness and unfeignèd love,\n\n1659 55 First, to do greetings to thy royal person,\n\n1660 And then to crave a league of amity,\n\n1661 And, lastly, to confirm that amity\n\n1662 With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant\n\n1663 That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,\n\n1664 60 To England’s king in lawful marriage.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1665 If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done.\n\nWARWICK, speaking to ⌜Lady⌝ Bona\n\n1666 And, gracious madam, in our king’s behalf,\n\n1667 I am commanded, with your leave and favor,\n\n1668 Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue\n\n1669 65 To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,\n\n1670 Where fame, late ent’ring at his heedful ears,\n\n1671 Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1672 King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak\n\n1673 Before you answer Warwick. His demand\n\n1674 70 Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,\n\np. 145\n\n1675 But from deceit, bred by necessity;\n\n1676 For how can tyrants safely govern home\n\n1677 Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?\n\n1678 To prove him tyrant, this reason may suffice:\n\n1679 75 That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,\n\n1680 Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.\n\n1681 Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and\n\n1682 marriage\n\n1683 Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;\n\n1684 80 For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,\n\n1685 Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1686 Injurious Margaret!\n\nPRINCE EDWARD 1687 And why not “Queen”?\n\nWARWICK\n\n1688 Because thy father Henry did usurp,\n\n1689 85 And thou no more art prince than she is queen.\n\nOXFORD\n\n1690 Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,\n\n1691 Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;\n\n1692 And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,\n\n1693 Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;\n\n1694 90 And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,\n\n1695 Who by his prowess conquerèd all France.\n\n1696 From these our Henry lineally descends.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1697 Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse\n\n1698 You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost\n\n1699 95 All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten.\n\n1700 Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.\n\n1701 But, for the rest: you tell a pedigree\n\n1702 Of threescore and two years, a silly time\n\n1703 To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.\n\nOXFORD\n\n1704 100 Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,\n\n1705 Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years,\n\n1706 And not bewray thy treason with a blush?\n\np. 147\n\nWARWICK\n\n1707 Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,\n\n1708 Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?\n\n1709 105 For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.\n\nOXFORD\n\n1710 Call him my king, by whose injurious doom\n\n1711 My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,\n\n1712 Was done to death? And more than so, my father,\n\n1713 Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,\n\n1714 110 When nature brought him to the door of death?\n\n1715 No, Warwick, no. While life upholds this arm,\n\n1716 This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.\n\nWARWICK 1717 And I the house of York.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1718 Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,\n\n1719 115 Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside\n\n1720 While I use further conference with Warwick.\n\nThey stand aloof.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1721 Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him\n\n1722 not.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1723 Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,\n\n1724 120 Is Edward your true king? For I were loath\n\n1725 To link with him that were not lawful chosen.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1726 Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1727 But is he gracious in the people’s eye?\n\nWARWICK\n\n1728 The more that Henry was unfortunate.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1729 125 Then further, all dissembling set aside,\n\n1730 Tell me for truth the measure of his love\n\n1731 Unto our sister Bona.\n\np. 149\n\nWARWICK 1732 Such it seems\n\n1733 As may beseem a monarch like himself.\n\n1734 130 Myself have often heard him say and swear\n\n1735 That this his love was an ⌜eternal⌝ plant,\n\n1736 Whereof the root was fixed in virtue’s ground,\n\n1737 The leaves and fruit maintained with beauty’s sun,\n\n1738 Exempt from envy but not from disdain,\n\n1739 135 Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1740 Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.\n\nLADY BONA\n\n1741 Your grant or your denial shall be mine.\n\n1742 (Speaks to Warwick.) Yet I confess that often ere this\n\n1743 day,\n\n1744 140 When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,\n\n1745 Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1746 Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s.\n\n1747 And now forthwith shall articles be drawn\n\n1748 Touching the jointure that your king must make,\n\n1749 145 Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.—\n\n1750 Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness\n\n1751 That Bona shall be wife to the English king.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD\n\n1752 To Edward, but not to the English king.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1753 Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device\n\n1754 150 By this alliance to make void my suit.\n\n1755 Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry’s friend.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1756 And still is friend to him and Margaret.\n\n1757 But if your title to the crown be weak,\n\n1758 As may appear by Edward’s good success,\n\n1759 155 Then ’tis but reason that I be released\n\n1760 From giving aid which late I promisèd.\n\np. 151\n\n1761 Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand\n\n1762 That your estate requires and mine can yield.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1763 Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,\n\n1764 160 Where, having nothing, nothing can he lose.—\n\n1765 And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,\n\n1766 You have a father able to maintain you,\n\n1767 And better ’twere you troubled him than France.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1768 Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,\n\n1769 165 Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!\n\n1770 I will not hence till with my talk and tears,\n\n1771 Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold\n\n1772 Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love,\n\n1773 For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.\n\nPost blowing a horn within.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1774 170 Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.\n\nEnter the Post.\n\nPOST speaks to Warwick.\n\n1775 My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,\n\n1776 Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.\n\n1777 (To Lewis.) These from our king unto your Majesty.\n\n1778 (To Margaret.) And, madam, these for you—from\n\n1779 175 whom, I know not.They all read their letters.\n\nOXFORD, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1780 I like it well that our fair queen and mistress\n\n1781 Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1782 Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.\n\n1783 I hope all’s for the best.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1784 180 Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1785 Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.\n\np. 153\n\nWARWICK\n\n1786 Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1787 What, has your king married the Lady Grey,\n\n1788 And now, to soothe your forgery and his,\n\n1789 185 Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?\n\n1790 Is this th’ alliance that he seeks with France?\n\n1791 Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1792 I told your Majesty as much before.\n\n1793 This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1794 190 King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven\n\n1795 And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,\n\n1796 That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward’s—\n\n1797 No more my king, for he dishonors me,\n\n1798 But most himself, if he could see his shame.\n\n1799 195 Did I forget that by the house of York\n\n1800 My father came untimely to his death?\n\n1801 Did I let pass th’ abuse done to my niece?\n\n1802 Did I impale him with the regal crown?\n\n1803 Did I put Henry from his native right?\n\n1804 200 And am I guerdoned at the last with shame?\n\n1805 Shame on himself, for my desert is honor!\n\n1806 And to repair my honor lost for him,\n\n1807 I here renounce him and return to Henry.\n\n⌜He removes the white rose.⌝\n\n1808 My noble queen, let former grudges pass,\n\n1809 205 And henceforth I am thy true servitor.\n\n1810 I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona\n\n1811 And replant Henry in his former state.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1812 Warwick, these words have turned my hate to love,\n\n1813 And I forgive and quite forget old faults,\n\n1814 210 And joy that thou becom’st King Henry’s friend.\n\np. 155\n\nWARWICK\n\n1815 So much his friend, ay, his unfeignèd friend,\n\n1816 That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us\n\n1817 With some few bands of chosen soldiers,\n\n1818 I’ll undertake to land them on our coast\n\n1819 215 And force the tyrant from his seat by war.\n\n1820 ’Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him.\n\n1821 And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,\n\n1822 He’s very likely now to fall from him\n\n1823 For matching more for wanton lust than honor,\n\n1824 220 Or than for strength and safety of our country.\n\nLADY BONA\n\n1825 Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged\n\n1826 But by thy help to this distressèd queen?\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1827 Renownèd prince, how shall poor Henry live\n\n1828 Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?\n\nLADY BONA\n\n1829 225 My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1830 And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1831 And mine with hers and thine and Margaret’s.\n\n1832 Therefore at last I firmly am resolved\n\n1833 You shall have aid.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1834 230 Let me give humble thanks for all, at once.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1835 Then, England’s messenger, return in post,\n\n1836 And tell false Edward, thy supposèd king,\n\n1837 That Lewis of France is sending over maskers\n\n1838 To revel it with him and his new bride.\n\n1839 235 Thou seest what’s passed; go fear thy king withal.\n\nLADY BONA\n\n1840 Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,\n\n1841 I wear the willow garland for his sake.\n\np. 157\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1842 Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside\n\n1843 And I am ready to put armor on.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1844 240 Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\n\n1845 And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere ’t be long.\n\n1846 There’s thy reward.⌜Gives money.⌝\n\n1847 Be gone.Post exits.\n\nKING LEWIS 1848 But, Warwick,\n\n1849 245 Thou and Oxford with five thousand men\n\n1850 Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;\n\n1851 And as occasion serves, this noble queen\n\n1852 And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.\n\n1853 Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:\n\n1854 250 What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?\n\nWARWICK\n\n1855 This shall assure my constant loyalty:\n\n1856 That if our queen and this young prince agree,\n\n1857 I’ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy,\n\n1858 To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.\n\nQUEEN MARGARET\n\n1859 255 Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.\n\n1860 Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous.\n\n1861 Therefore, delay not; give thy hand to Warwick,\n\n1862 And with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,\n\n1863 That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD\n\n1864 260 Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,\n\n1865 And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.\n\nHe gives his hand to Warwick.\n\nKING LEWIS\n\n1866 Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,\n\n1867 And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,\n\n1868 Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.\n\n1869 265 I long till Edward fall by war’s mischance\n\n1870 For mocking marriage with a dame of France.\n\np. 159\n\nAll but Warwick exit.\n\nWARWICK\n\n1871 I came from Edward as ambassador,\n\n1872 But I return his sworn and mortal foe.\n\n1873 Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,\n\n1874 270 But dreadful war shall answer his demand.\n\n1875 Had he none else to make a stale but me?\n\n1876 Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.\n\n1877 I was the chief that raised him to the crown,\n\n1878 And I’ll be chief to bring him down again:\n\n1879 275 Not that I pity Henry’s misery,\n\n1880 But seek revenge on Edward’s mockery.\n\nHe exits."
