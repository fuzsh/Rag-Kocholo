        "text": "HENRY IV – SYNOPSIS\n\nThis production by Shakespeare Festival Saint Louis is a confluence of William Shakespeare’s Henry IV Part 1 and Henry IV Part 2 into one play. This synopsis reflects our adaptation.\n\n—\n\nHaving deposed King Richard II, Henry Bolingbroke (now King Henry IV) discusses with his court the recent fighting against the Welsh and Scots, as a result of which Henry Percy (nicknamed Hotspur) has refused to yield up his prisoners. Henry regrets that Prince Hal, his own son and heir, does not match Hotspur’s prowess. When Henry meets Hotspur, Northumberland (Hotspur’s father), and Worcester, Hotspur still refuses to comply; all three later discuss their grievances and plan a rebellion. Lady Percy, Hotspur’s wife, tries to find out if her husband is putting himself in danger.\n\nHENRY V – SYNOPSIS\n\nHenry V telescopes historical events that took place between 1415-1420. The play takes place in London and Southampton in England, and in various locales in northern France.\n\nIn this openly theatrical play, a Chorus is our storyteller and guide to the reign of King Henry V and the battle of Agincourt.\n\nThe newly crowned Henry V contemplates pursuing his right to lay claim to the French throne. After being convinced by his clergy that he has this right, and having suffered a grievous insult from the French Dauphin, Henry decides to go to war. He departs for Southampton where he foils a plot by three of his peers, who have been bribed by the French to assassinate him. This danger overcome, he sets sail for France and war."
