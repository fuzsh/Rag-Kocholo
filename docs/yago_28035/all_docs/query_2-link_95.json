        "text": "Born Marguerite de Valois at the royal Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and nicknamed Margot by her brothers, she was the daughter of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici. Three of her brothers became kings of France: Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Her sister, Élisabeth de Valois, became the third wife of King Philip II of Spain.\n\nMarguerite was forced to marry Henry de Bourbon, the son of Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant Queen of Navarre, in a marriage that was designed to reunite family ties and create harmony between Catholics and Huguenots. Although Henry's mother opposed the marriage, many of her nobles supported it, and the marriage was arranged. Jeanne d'Albret died under suspicious circumstances before the marriage could take place; some suspected that a pair of gloves sent to Jeanne as a wedding gift from Catherine de' Medici had been poisoned.\n\nOn 18 August 1572, the 19-year-old Marguerite married Henri de Bourbon, who had become King of Navarre upon the death of his mother.\n\nJust six days after the wedding, on Saint Bartholomew's Day, a massacre of Huguenots was conducted by Parisian mobs.\n\nMarguerite has been credited with saving the lives of several prominent Protestants (including her husband) during the massacre, by keeping them in her rooms and refusing to admit the assassins, which included her lover, Henri de Guise. For her pains, she was confined to the Louvre by her mother. Henry of Navarre, too, was placed under house arrest and had to feign conversion to Catholicism.\n\nAfter more than three years of confinement at court, Henry escaped Paris in 1576, leaving his wife behind. Finally granted permission to return to her husband in Navarre, for the next three and a half years Marguerite and her husband lived in Pau. Both openly kept other lovers, and they quarrelled frequently.\n\nAfter an illness in 1582, Queen Marguerite returned to the court of her brother, Henry III, in Paris. But Henry III was soon scandalized by her reputation and forced her to leave the court. After long negotiations, she was allowed to return to her husband's court in Navarre, but she received an icy reception. Determined to overcome her difficulties, Queen Marguerite masterminded a coup d'état and seized power over Agen, one of her appanages. After several months of fortifying the city, the citizens of Agen revolted and Queen Marguerite fled to the castle of Carlat. In 1586, she was imprisoned by her brother Henri III in the castle of Usson, in Auvergne, where she spent eighteen years.\n\nIn 1589, her husband succeeded to the throne of France as Henry IV, though he was not accepted by most of the Catholic population until he converted to that faith four years later. Henry continued to keep mistresses, most notably Gabrielle d'Estrées from 1591 to 1599, who bore him four children. Negotiations to dissolve the marriage were entered in 1592 and concluded in 1599 with an agreement that allowed her to maintain the title of queen. She settled her household on the Left Bank of the Seine, in the Hostel de la Reyne Margueritte.\n\nDuring this time, Marguerite wrote her memoirs consisting of a succession of stories relating to the affairs of her brothers Charles IX and Henri III with her former husband Henry IV. The memoirs were published posthumously in 1628 and scandalised the population. Marguerite took many lovers both during her marriage, and after divorcing. Most notable were Joseph Boniface de La Môle, Jacques de Harlay, Seigneur de Chanvallon and Louis de Bussy d'Amboise.\n\nReconciled to her former husband and his second wife, Marie de Medici, Queen Marguerite returned to Paris and established herself as a mentor of the arts and benefactress of the poor. She often helped plan events at court and nurtured the children of Henry IV and Marie. Marguerite died in her private residence, the Hôtel de la Reine Marguerite in Paris, on 27 May 1615, and was buried in the Chapel of the Valois.\n\nAlexandre Dumas, père's novel Queen Margot (\"La Rei\n\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\nMargot #3\n\nÉlianne Viennot opens her essay with “Marguerite de Valois was born in 1553 and died in 1615. She was the first true memoirist in modern time…” and what a memoir she wrote.\n\nMarguerite was the daughter of Henri II, king of France and sister to the kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henri III. She married Henri of Navarre, who would become Henri IV, king of France although by this time, she would have her marriage annulled and live as Queen Mother, just as her mother Queen Catherine de Medici. Marguerite lived through the turbulent time of the Religious Wars. In short she was an “eye witness” to the political machinations of the time. More importantly she shines a light from a woman’s point of view within the highest ranks of the royal court.\n\nThe memoir spans from 1559 when she was six to 1581 to when she was 28. Sadly her original copy was lost, plus there are three lacunas revealing much was missing. It’s believed she wrote the manuscript ending it around 1582. The memoir was published posthumously in 1628. It would inspire Alexandre Dumas to write his famous novel La Reine Margot (1845).\n\nDespite the missing sections, Marguerite covers some major incidents of the period including the Saint Bartholomew Day Massacre, her turbulent escape from her time in Belgium, the complex issues with her brother Le duc François d’Alençon, and ending with her somewhat “peaceful” period when she is reunited with Henri of a Navarre in Gascogne (which inspired Shakespeare to write Love’s Labour’s Lost and performed for Queen Elizabeth I).\n\nAided by Viennot’s excellent essay and her notes throughout, one gets a great sense of Marguerite and her times. She was very well read and makes numerous historical allusions. She is a fervent Catholic, going to church every day, complaining that when she entered Protestant Pau, she needed to attend church, which angered the town’s councillors.\n\nShe had a strong and loyal love for her brothers, king Henri III and François duc d’Alençon despite the fact they were often opposed to each other in the religious wars. She often stood behind François even though he was on the side of the Huguenots, to the point of almost getting herself in serious trouble.\n\nAlthough she didn’t have a “daughterly” relationship for her mother Catherine, she knew how dangerous she could be and yet, knew how important she was to win her over to her side. Likewise, her brother king Henri III could be imposing but she played her cards well and always managed not to “lose her head.”\n\nAs for her own husband, Henri of Navarre, she admired him, helped him and yet fully aware of his powers and ambitions. He was a Huguenot and she a Catholic. It was bound to cause problems. By the end of the memoir, when she was in Gascogne, she realized that she was no match for Henri’s mistress Foseusse. She finally saw what her husband was truly like. Which comes to Marguerite. She was known to have many love affairs, some ending very badly. On her relationships, she leaves out her feelings and only mentions them in reference to there events. Why?\n\nThis made me realize something about memoirs. Why are they made? To make the person writing them look good, one must safely assume. Marguerite does come off really well. She appeared to be the only one in the royal family opposed to the Saint Bartholomew Massacre on the grounds of religion. Namely devout faith. She often asks for peace, seeks for wars to end and yet her own family were constantly in the thick of things, stirring up the pot.\n\nWe do get different perspective. How accurate can be debated but one needs to read this angle before drawing conclusions. Without a doubt it still remains an important part of history.\n\nAt the end of the memoir, Viennot adds a letter from Marguerite to Father Loryot on the theme of gender equality. It was 1614 and she brings an answer to that age old debate, “a discourse on the excellence of women.” She never kept quiet until the end."
