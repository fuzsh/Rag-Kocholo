        "text": "On 17th December 1599 Henri IV of France finally obtained the divorce he sought from Marguerite de Valois, known to history as “Reine Margot”, after more than 27 years of a largely loveless marriage.\n\nThe marriage may not have been the happiest, but that does not mean that either party had deprived themselves when it came to night-time activities. Both had been notoriously unfaithful to each other, with Margot being especially busy in working her way through the aristocracy of France.\n\nIn 1586 Henri decided that he had had enough of listening to gossip about his wife’s illicit affairs and he placed her under house arrest at a castle in central France, well away from the political centre of Paris. This did not stop her from indulging in fun and games of her own, or from engaging in various eccentricities such as riding a camel through the streets of the nearby town.\n\nHenri wanted a divorce so that he could marry his mistress, Gabrielle d’Estrées, who had already borne him several children, which Margot had failed to do. If he could marry Gabrielle the children would be legitimised and the succession to the throne would be secured."
