        "text": "Why did three royal princesses bear the name Marguerite de Valois between 1495 and 1615? It makes it so complicated to separate them. Their contemporaries must have muttered over the same problem.\n\nSources of Information\n\nThe literature on the Marguerites is vast and varied. The selections after each brief bio represent only a fragment. I’ve chosen the most accessible. They include both popular, and primary and secondary sources. But I’ve not included fiction. In another blog, I will share a more extensive list.\n\nThree Marguerites—Great Aunt, Niece, Grand Niece\n\nThe chart below shows the relationships among the three generations of Marguerites de Valois. I shall use their titles when writing about them. I hope their deeds will speak for them. Their personalities were as different as chalk and cheese.\n\nMarguerite d’Angoulême, Queen of Navarre\n\nOf the three, Queen Marguerite, Pearl of Pearls, receives most scholarly attention. An early woman author, as queen ensured everyone read her writing. It also helped her work to survive. Her role in the early reform movement has made her a heroine. And her influence with her brother and mother gave her an important political role.\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nL’Heptameron: textes etabli sur les manuscrits avec une introduction des notes et un index des noms propres, by Marguerite De Navarre, Jan 1, 1950\n\nThéâtre profane: Nouvelle édition revue (Textes Litterai) (French Edition), by Marguerite de Navarre and Verdun-Léon Saulnier, Jan 1, 1965\n\nThe Mirror of the Sinful Soul: A Prose Translation from the French of a Poem by Queen Margaret of Navarre, by Marguerite, Queen Consort of Henry II, et al., Oct 16, 2018\n\nOeuvres complètes: Le triomphe de l’Agneau (III) (Oeuvres complètes / Marguerite de Navarre.

She supported such writers as Du Bellay, Ronsard and the Savoyard poet Claude de Buttet. Liberal in thought, the Church accused her of reformist sympathies.\n\nMarguerite de Valois—Duchess de Savoie\n\nIn July 1559 she finally married Duke Emmanuel-Philibert de Savoie. They had one child, Charles Emmanuel, born in 1562. A gentle and soft-spoken woman, she had the ability to reconcile opponents. Her new subjects believed she healed the rankling wounds between Savoie and France over contested borders.\n\nSelected Sources\n\nMarguerite Duchess of Savoy and Berry\n\nMarguerite of France, Duchess of Savoy\n\nPeyre R. une princesse de la Renaissance, Marguerite de France duchesse de Savoie, Paris, 1902\n\nMarguerite de Savoie, Une princesse de la renaissance\n\nRouget F.

The marriage itself became the occasion of one of the most shameful events in French history—the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre. They had no children from this disastrous union. Unhappily married, she shuffled between the courts of Navarre and France as the fortunes of war shifted. In 1585, she threw her support to the Catholic League. Her disgruntled brother, King Henri III, imprisoned her in Auvergne.\n\nLa Reine Margot’s Memoirs\n\nSelected sources.

Noel Williams and Linda Ellis | Jun 11, 2015\n\nMarguerite and its diminutives\n\nThe limited number of royal names in use is trying. I have often wondered how they dealt with it. Nicknames or diminutives? Is that why there are so many for one name? For Marguerite here are some of the most common. Margot (Margaux), Maggi, Gutte, Marina, Pernette, Grette, Marinete, Megane, and Magali. These I found easily. I discovered several Breton variants, too. Several probably existed in the langue d’oc. Other local languages existed then, spoken by small enclaves. I suspect they had their own versions.\n\nThis multiplication of people with the same name, is one of the small, irritating challenges that historical novelists face. Using variants is one solution. How do others solve it? Reply in the comments with your thoughts."
