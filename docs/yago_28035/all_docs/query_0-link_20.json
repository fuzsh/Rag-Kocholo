Before this he was King of Navarre, in South West France.\n\nIn 1572 Protestant Henry married his Catholic cousin Margaret of Valois to help solidify a peace between Catholic and Protestants during the French Wars of Religion. Instead it prompted the St Bartholomew's Day massacre. Instigated by Catholic leaders, it is likely more than 5,000 Huguenots were murdered and Henry himself only just escaped with his life.\n\nHenry's succession to the throne of France continued to be contested by the Holy League before his succession and after. Henry only restored peace through various battles during which he showed strong leadership and courage and through his conversion to Catholicism in 1593.\n\nThe Edict of Nantes in 1598 finally established Catholicism as the official religion of France but crucially granted Protestants rights and freedoms.\n\nTo ensure an heir, Henry IV had his marriage to Margaret of Valois annulled and married instead Marie de Médicis, all the while maintaining an impressive list of mistresses.\n\nHenry IV's reign was cut short by his assassination by a fanatical Roman Catholic in 1610.\n\nBorn: December 13, 1553\n\nBirthplace: Pau, Kingdom of Navarre\n\nStar Sign: Sagittarius\n\nDied: May 14, 1610 (aged 56)\n\nCause of Death: Assassinated\n\nArticles and Photos\n\nThe Lost Love of Cheating Henry\n\nThe mistress of French king Henry IV was beautiful, intelligent – and pregnant.
