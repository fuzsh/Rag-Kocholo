        "text": "THE KINGS\n\nHenry III, Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV\n\nand\n\nTHE DUKES\n\nJean-Louis and Bernard, les ducs d'Épernon\n\nKING Henry III\n\n1551-1589\n\nA Catholic\n\nHenry III, King of France from 1574 to 1589, was the last of the Valois kings. He was born at Fontainebleau on 19 September 1551, the third son of Henri II and Catherine d'Médicis. He was his mother's favorite son.\n\nAt one point in his youth he showed a tendency towards Protestantism as a means of rebelling. At the age of nine, calling himself un petit Huguenot, he refused to attend Mass, sang Protestant psalms to his sister Margaret (exhorting her all the while to change her religion and cast her Book of Hours into the fire), and even bit the nose off a statue of Saint Paul. His mother firmly cautioned her children against such behaviour, and he would never again show any Protestant tendencies  instead becoming nominally Roman Catholic.\n\nHe was the leader against the Huguenots (French Protestants) and took part in the victories over them in 1569 when he was 18.\n\nFrench Wars of Religion\n\nWe are talking here about the series of civil wars between 1562-1598 (called the French Wars of Religion), which took place on again off again between the Roman Catholics and Protestants all across France. As a whole this consisted of eight sub-wars, numerous battles, ineffective treaties and edicts, and an unbelievable half century of self inflicted misery and suffering for people and church buildings and furnishings. These wars continued throughout Henri's reign, bringing France close to bankruptcy.\n\nThe low point was in August 1572 when Henri aided his mother, Catherine d'Medici, in planning the \"Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre\".\n\nThe St. Bartholomew Massacre was a turning point in both French history and the history of the European Christian church. Protestants no longer viewed Catholicism as a misguided church, but as the force of the devil itself. No longer were Protestants fighting for a reformed church, but they suddenly saw themselves fighting for survival against a Catholic church whose cruelty and violence seemed to know no bounds. Throughout Europe, Protestant movements slowly transformed into militant movements.\n\nThe War of the Three Henries\n\nThe War of the Three Henries (1587-1589) was the eighth and final conflict of the French Wars of Religion.\n\nIt was instigated, funded, and supported by Spain's King Philip to keep his enemy, France, from interfering with his army in the Netherlands and his planned invasion of England. [Philip's Spanish Armada was defeated by England in 1588.]\n\nThe war was fought between the Royalists (Henry III of France), the Huguenots (the heir-apparent, Henri, King of Navarre), and the Catholic League (Henri I, the duc de Guise). Spain supported the duc de Guise, of course.\n\nThe head of the House of Guise, the duc de Guise, was a fanatical Catholic with designs on the throne of France. He formed the Catholic League, whose objective was to exterminate the Huguenots, to confine the King in a monastery, and place himself, the duc de Guise, on the throne of France. The League was sanctioned by the Pope and backed by the Catholic King Philip II of Spain.\n\nThe Catholic League convinced King Henry III to issue an edict outlawing Protestantism and annulling Navarre's right to the throne. Henry III might have been influenced in this by one of the royal \"favorites\", Anne, duc de Joyeuse.\n\nAt first, the Royalists and the Catholic League were uneasy allies against their common enemy, the Huguenots, but after Joyeuse was killed at the Battle of Coutras relations between the two failed.\n\nIn 1588, the Catholic League (led by the duc de Guise) led the citizenry of Paris to revolt against the king, planned in part by the Spanish diplomat Bernardino de Mendoza. This has been called the \"Day of Barricades\". The king was forced to flee to Blois.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Spanish Armada King Henri called the Estates-General in the midst of intrigue and plotting. Henry of Guise planned to assassinate King Henri and seize the throne, but the king struck first, and had Guise killed by his fanatically loyal guards, The Forty-Five.\n\nOpen war erupted between the Royalists and the Catholic League. In exile, King Henry III had struck up an alliance with his Huguenot cousin, Henry III of Navarre. Navarre believed that the peace and security of France were far more important than imposing his religious views. And the king now named Navarre to be his successor.\n\nAssassination\n\nWhile attempting to regain Paris on 1 August 1589, the king was stabbed by Jacques Clément, a young, fanatical, fury-driven, Dominican friar.\n\nJacques Clément, carrying false papers, had been granted access to deliver important documents to the King. The monk gave the King a bundle of papers and stated that he had a secret message to deliver. The King signaled for his attendants to step back for privacy, and Clément whispered in his ear while plunging a knife into his abdomen. Clément was killed on the spot by the guards.\n\nClick on the image for a larger version\n\nThe assassination of Henry III of France\n\nand the Execution of his Killer,\n\nby Franz Hogenberg\n\nAt first the King's wound did not appear fatal. But, in anticipation that he may not survive, he enjoined all the officers around him to be loyal to Henry of Navarre as their new king.\n\nHenry III on death bed,\n\nacknowleding Henry of Navarre\n\nThe following morning  the day that he was to have launched his assault to retake Paris  Henry III died.\n\nChaos swept the attacking army, most of it quickly melting away and the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Inside the city, joy at the news of Henry III's death was near delirium. Some hailed the assassination as an act of God.\n\nMy page\n\nAssassination of King Kenry III\n\nKing Henry III was interred at the Saint Denis Basilica. Childless, he was the last of the Valois kings. Now, Henry III of Navarre would succeed and become King Henry IV, the first of the Bourbon kings.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the body of King Henry III was disinterred from his tomb, and his remains were desecrated and thrown into a common grave, along with many others of the nobility.\n\nKING HENRY IV\n\n1553-1610\n\nA Protestant, then later a Catholic\n\nHenri de Bourbon was born on 13 December 1553, in the Château de Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in the southwest of France, former province of Béarn.\n\nHis father was Antoine de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme, and descended in the 9th generation from the 13th-century king of France, Louis IX.\n\nHis mother was Jeanne d'Albret, was Queen Jeanne III of Navarre. Her mother was Marguerite of Navarre, a sister of King François I of France, making him a 2nd cousin of Kings François II, Charles IX and Henry III.\n\nAlthough baptized as a Roman Catholic, Henry was raised as a Protestant by his strong-minded Calvinist mother, a leader of the French Protestant (Huguenot) movement, which during the 1560s became involved in a series of civil wars with the Catholics. As a teenager, Henry joined the Huguenot forces in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nOn June 9 1572, upon Jeanne's death, he became King Henry III of Navarre.\n\nHenry's wedding in 1572 to Margaret of Valois, sister of the reigning monarch, Charles IX, was followed by the massacre of thousands of Huguenots. This became known as the Saint Bartholomew's Day, Massacre.\n\nWhen the childless Henry III, king of France, was assassinated, the French crown passed on 1 August 1589 to Navarre, and he was now King Henry IV, king of France, the first monarch of the Bourbon branch of the Capetian dynasty in France.\n\nIt was to his father (a 10th-generation descendant of King Louis IX), however, to whom Henri owed his succession to the throne of France. The \"Salic Law\" disregarded all female lines, and Henri was the senior descendant of the senior surviving male line of the Capetian dynasty. He was the first monarch of the Bourbon branch of the Capetian dynasty in France. Upon the death of Henri III of France, who had no son to succeed him, the crown passed to Henri IV. The new king, however, had to fight for some years to be recognized as the legitimate king of France by the Catholics, who were opposed to his Protestant faith.\n\nDespite the endorsement of Henry III of France, many people would not accept a Protestant as their King, and Henry of Navarre had to continue to do battle with the Catholic League, which received strong support from Spain. Thus it was several more years before Henri could be crowned King of France.\n\nOn the 21st of September 1589, King Henry IV engaged the Duke of Mayenne at Arques, on the north coast near Dieppe. His force of a few thousand men, managed to repel the much larger forces of the Catholic League. Shortly after this Henri received reinforcements from Elizabeth I of England, as well as the Count de Soissons and others.\n\nOn the 14th of March 1590 Henri again did battle with Mayenne, this time at Ivry to the west of Paris. Again King Henry IV prevailed. However the Catholic League retained a strong grip on Paris.\n\nHenri Converts and is Finally Crowned\n\nOn the 25th of July 1593, Henry III of Navarre converted back to the Catholic faith, which led to him being officially crowned as Henry IV of France at Chartres, on the 27th of February 1594. Henri is reputed to have said that \"Paris is worth a Mass\". It still took him until 22 March 1594 and the bribing of key officials before he was able to enter and claim Paris.\n\nMany Protestants were disappointed, that the man they had supported, had renounced their faith for a second time. Many Catholics didn't believe his conversion was sincere. In the middle ground were men like Henri himself of both religions, who realized that for France to recover from the turmoil of the religious wars, the two religions needed to live peacefully side by side.\n\nHenri used his new influence to draft the Edict of Nantes, which was signed in 1598, and which gave Protestants freedom to practice their faith in what was still predominantly Catholic France.\n\nThe war lasted several more years, as Catholic League diehards and Spanish troops continued to resist the reunification of France.\n\nReunification of France\n\nBut once those were dealt with, he was credited with brokering peace between Catholics and Protestants. His reign inaugurated a time of commerce and peace commonly regarded as a golden age. His long time trusted friend, the financially astute Duke of Rosny, was promoted in 1606 and from then on became known as the Duke of Sully, and helped Henri set about rebuilding the finances and infrastructure of the united Kingdoms of France and Navarre, which had been devastated by the lengthy wars of religion. He built Parisian landmarks including the Pont Neuf bridge and Place des Vosges.\n\nKing Henry IV was a man of good humor, and was much loved by his people, called \"le bon roi\" (the good king). A Protestant, he had converted to Catholicism to unite his subjects. He displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the time.\n\nAnd yet, there were over twenty assassination attempts during his reign, all unsuccessful until the 14th of May 1610.\n\nBecause Henri planned to be absent for long periods on state business, Marie d'Medici was crowned Queen on the 13th of May 1610, so that she could act in his place while he was away.\n\nQuite oddly, the next day, the 14th of May 1610, the king was struck down in the streets of Paris by the blade of a Roman Catholic fanatic, François Ravaillac. Ravaillac stabbed Henri to death while his coach's progress was stopped by traffic congestion for the Queen's coronation ceremony.\n\nMy page\n\nAssassination of King Kenry IV\n\nHenri was buried at the Saint Denis Basilica in Paris.\n\nThe reign of Henry IV had a lasting impact on the French people for generations. A statue of him was built at the Pont Neuf in 1614, only four years after his death. Although this statue  as well as those of all the other French kings  was torn down during the French Revolution, it was the first to be rebuilt, in 1818, and it stands today on the Pont Neuf. He remains one of France's most beloved kings.\n\nLink up to a song on YouTube from \"chansons historiques de France\": Vive Henri IV. Another rendition (with pictures) on YouTube: click here.\n\nKING LOUIS XIII\n\n1601-1643\n\nA Catholic\n\nLouis XIII of France was born in 1601 at Fontainebleu. He was the son of Henry IV and Marie d'Medici. He was the first of the Bourbon kings of France.\n\nOn the day in 1610 when his father was assassinated, Louis was nine years old and King of France.\n\nAbsolute monarchical power, started by Louis XI and advanced by Kings Francis I and Henri II, was expanded during his reign.\n\nQueen Mother Marie is Regent\n\nSince Louis was a minor, France, then would be governed by a Regent  in this case, the Queen Mother, Marie d'Medici. She allowed her favourites, Galigai and Concini, to do as they wished, thereby discrediting the monarchy after the exalted heights to which Henry IV had taken it.\n\nEven after being declared of age in 1614, he was excluded from affairs of state by his domineering mother. From then on he became more and more influenced by Charles, duc de Luynes, who favoured an extension of royal absolutism.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1615, Louis married Anne of Austria; daughter of Philip III, king of Spain.\n\nThe Queen Mother is Ousted\n\nIn 1617, Louis caused the assassination of his mother's favorite, Concino Concini, with the aid of his own favorite, Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes, and Marie d'Medici was exiled to a château at Blois and kept out of the royal court.\n\nIn addition, the king and de Luynes concocted a trial that found the Queen mother's other favorite, Galigai, guilty of being a witch, a decision that led to her execution.\n\nOnce both of the Queen's former favorites were out of his way, de Luynes used his position to expand his power, but also the power of the king.\n\nLouis and his mother reconciled in 1622 and he entrusted the government to her protégé, Cardinal Richelieu in 1624.\n\nCardinal Richelieu\n\nArmand Jean Duplessis, Duc de Richelieu (1585-1642) was consecrated as a bishop in 1608. He later entered politics, becoming a Secretary of State in 1616. He soon rose in both the Catholic Church and the French government, becoming a Cardinal in 1622.\n\nThe Cardinal de Richelieu was often known as King Louis XIII's \"Chief Minister\" or \"First Minister.\" As a result, he is considered to be the world's first Prime Minister, in the modern sense of the term. He sought to consolidate royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strong, centralized state.\n\nHis chief foreign policy objective was to check the power of the Austro-Spanish Habsburg dynasty. Although he was a cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with Protestant rulers in attempting to achieve this goal. His tenure was marked by the Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe.\n\nAs the de facto ruler of France from 1629 onward, his ultimate intent, however, was to break the power of the Huguenots. He did so in the 1628 Siege of La Rochelle when he starved them into surrender.\n\nDay of the Dupes\n\nDay of Dupes is the name given to the day in November of 1630 on which the enemies of Cardinal Richelieu mistakenly believed that they had succeeded in persuading Louis XIII, King of France, to dismiss Richelieu from power. The actual day is thought to have been either on the 10th, 11th, or 12th of the month.\n\nIn November 1630, the political relations between the cardinal and the queen mother reached a crisis. In a stormy scene on 10 November, in the Luxembourg Palace, Marie d'Medici and the cardinal met in the king's presence. The queen mother demanded the cardinal's dismissal, declaring that the king had to choose between him and her.\n\nNo immediate decision came from this conference, but the king retired to his hunting lodge in Versailles. Richelieu seems to have believed that his political career was over, but the intercession of influential friends saved the minister from impending disgrace. While the apartments of the Luxembourg Palace were thronged by the cardinal's enemies celebrating his fall, Richelieu followed the king to Versailles, where the monarch assured him of continued support. Marie was subsequently exiled to Compiègne. The \"Day of Dupes\", as this event was called, marks the complete restoration of the cardinal to royal favor.\n\nUnder Richelieu's anti-Habsburg foreign policy, in 1635, France entered the Thirty Years' War as an ally of Sweden and the Protestant princes of Germany. Louis's reign was marked also by occasional religious strife between Roman Catholics and the French Protestants, or Huguenots, and by the many conspiracies against Richelieu.\n\nRichelieu strengthened royal authority and centralized government control, at the expense of the power of the nobility.\n\nHe remained in office until his death in 1642, and was succeeded by Cardinal Mazarin, whose career he had fostered.\n\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\nCardinal Richelieu\n\nKING LOUIS XIV\n\n1638-1715\n\nA Catholic\n\nLouis XIV was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He was the third monarch of the Bourbon family, and ruled for 72 years (1643-1715), the longest reign in European history.\n\nHe was the unexpected child of King Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, who had not had children in their 22-year marriage. He was christened Louis Dieudonné (literally, gift of God).\n\nIn 1643, before his fifth birthday, his father died, and Louis inherited the crown of France, which was internally divided, militarily exhausted, and nearly bankrupt.\n\nWhile a child, his mother served as regent, ruling France in his place. She was assisted by Jules Cardinal Mazarin, the Italian financier who had been the principal minister of Louis XIII. Mazarin had guided the nation through the later stages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648).\n\nMarriage\n\nOut of diplomatic necessity, Louis married Marie-Thérèse, the eldest daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. The marriage was arranged via a treaty that explicitly excluded Marie's heirs from inheriting the Spanish crown once Philip had paid her dowry. But the full dowry was never paid. Consequently, Louis refused to relinquish his family's claim to the Spanish inheritance, a claim that was to influence French policy later in his reign.\n\nAfter Cardinal Mazarin died in 1661 [the same year our La Valette died], Louis declared that henceforth he would rule France without a chief minister, something no French king had done in living memory. He intended to rule as an absolute monarch, believing that his power as king was derived from God and that he was responsible to God alone. He took the sun as his emblem and connected himself to its radiant image. Portraits, woodcuts, and engravings of the king portrayed as the Greek sun god Apollo poured from Parisian workshops.\n\nOn the domestic front, Louis strengthened the central government's control over the diverse regions of France, incorporating his territorial gains into a united state.\n\nOn the other hand, he provoked controversy when he restored Catholic religious unity by revoking the Edict of Nantes and repressing Protestantism.\n\nUnfortunately many of Louis's policies, both domestic and foreign, caused great hardship to ordinary people, many of whom suffered starvation, fled their homeland, or lived in terror of persecution.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nWIKIPEDIA ARTICLES\n\nCardinal Richelieu\n\nCatherine d'Medici, mother of Henry III\n\nHenry III of France\n\nLes Mignons - of King Henry III.\n\nFrançois Ravaillac, assassin of King Henry III, 1610\n\nWar of the Three Henries\n\nWives and Mistresses of King Henry IV\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLES\n\nHenry III of France, king from 1610-1643\n\nHenry IV of France, king from 1589-1610\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nArticle about: Jean-Louis de Nogaret de la Valette (in French).\n\nSee especially, half-way down, regarding the assassination of King Henry III.\n\nArticle re: French kings Henry III, Henry IV, Louis XIII, and Louis XIV on the Girouard Family website (a good article).\n\nGalliawatch Blogspot article: The Head of King Henry IV\n\nWives of Henry IV - (a good site)\n\n\"Esoteric Curiosa\" Blogspot article on King Henry IV (a good article).\n\nClick your Back button to return\n\nto the page you just left to get here."
