        "text": "Some strange, some coincidental, but all true facts about John F. Kennedy.\n\nAge\n\nAlthough Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest man to serve as president, John Kennedy was the youngest elected president at 43 years old. He was also the youngest to die in office, at the age of 46.\n\nAll in the Family\n\nWhile JFK was president, his brother Robert was U.S. Attorney General, and his youngest brother Ted, was elected a U.S. Senator. This is the only time that three members of the same family have held such high government positions. JFK was also the only president to appoint a sibling to a cabinet post.\n\nA Literary Leader\n\nJFK is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize, for his collective biography, Profiles in Courage.\n\nA New Medium\n\nThe Nixon-Kennedy debates were the first ever to be televised, and JFK's ability to project a positive image on-screen may have given him a significant advantage in the election. Interestingly, many people who heard the debates over the radio thought Nixon had done a more competent job."
