        "text": "Dorothy,\n\nThanks for your question. I'm kinda stumped on how to answer. Since it was August 1994, I asked the archivists at the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum if they knew anything about this. They pointed me to a Freedom of Information Act request that they processed on John Kennedy, Jr. None of them remember seeing anything like this in the records. If you're interested in the collection it's 2017-0713-F. The finding aid is here: https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/items/show/57520 .\n\nThanks again for your question.\n\nVery interesting... I wonder what Biden did?\n\nJFK Jr. was a heck of a guy and called it how he saw it. Since George W was elected President then, JFK Jr would have definitely beaten him in the '04 election. He was everything that W. was not.\n\nDear Mr. Saffron,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nSince the document cited is in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we suggest that you contact them about the redactions and contents. Their web site is https://www.fbi.gov/services/information-management/foipa#Obtaining-FBI%20Records.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your research!\n\nThere are records in possession of the FBI that refer to a 1994 letter to Sen. Joe Biden calling him \"a traitor\". According to the FBI, the letter was signed by an \"UNSUB [i.e. an unknown subject] aka John F. Kennedy, Jr.\" However, there is no reason to believe that the author of the letter was the son of the late President Kennedy.\n\nThe FBI records indicate that despite recovering four latent fingerprints the FBI and Capitol Hill Police were never able to determine the actual identity of the author of the letter. The letter appears to have been written by an impostor or possibly someone else who shared the name of John F. Kennedy, Jr. If it had been written by the son of JFK then it would have been a simple matter to match the fingerprints to him. Instead, the case was closed with no suspect identified."
