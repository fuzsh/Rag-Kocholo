        "text": "Background\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was America’s 35th president. He was a great leader and war hero who served the nation, both within and outside the office. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was born to a prominent family, as his father was a businessman/politician, while his mother was a socialite. Kennedy was a Gemini of Irish descent, his father was often away from home on business, and the family moved to Riverdale in 1927. He attended a prestigious boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut. After high school, he enrolled at Harvard College in September 1936. He lived a flamboyant life, touring different world countries and exploring cultures. He graduated cum laude in 1940 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government (international relations).\n\nIn 1940, Kennedy joined the U.S. Naval Reserve after World War II seemed unavoidable. In December 1942, he commanded the PT-101, a patrol torpedo boat, and then the PT-109 in April 1943. His PT-109 was attacked and cut in half, but he survived. For his efforts in the war, Kennedy earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the Purple Heart, the World War II Victory Medal, and several more. After the war, Kennedy had a brief stint in Journalism after his father got him a position in Hearst Newspapers. In 1947, he was elected to Congress and served for six years. He ran for Senate in 1952 and won. He also won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957 after he published “Profiles in Courage,” which highlighted how senators risked their careers for their personal beliefs. He was re-elected for a second term in the Senate in 1958 and announced his intention for Presidency in January 1960. He went head to head with Richard Nixon in the presidential debate and won the election by a small margin. He was sworn in as the 35th POTUS on January 20, 1961.\n\nKennedy was a fearless President. He attempted to overthrow the Cuban government and planned to invade Cuba in 1962. He signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in 1963 and presided over the Peace Corps with Latin America. However, on November 22, 1963, he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetary. He was survived by his wife, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, and four children. Kennedy had multiple affairs in his lifetime, and he is rumored to have had more children."
