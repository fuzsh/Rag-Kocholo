        "text": "Initiated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, the Alliance for Progress sought to establish economic cooperation between the United States and Latin America and avert an expansion of communist influence in the region. Offering a ten-year plan for the region that would increase annual per capita income 2.5 percent, ensure democratic governments, eliminate adult illiteracy, stabilize prices and reduce inflation, and promote land reform, total U.S. aid for the program between 1961 and 1969 exceeded $20 billion. The program also included military and police aid that in many cases was used to support authoritarian governments and military regimes. Presidents Johnson and Nixon subsequently distanced themselves from the goals of the program after Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nMarch 13, 1961. It is a great pleasure for Mrs. Kennedy and for me, for the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson, and for the Members of Congress, to welcome the Ambassadorial Corps of our Hemisphere, our long time friends, to the White House today. One hundred and thirty-nine years ago this week the United States, stirred by the heroic struggle of its fellow Americans, urged the independence and recognition of the new Latin American Republics. It was then, at the dawn of freedom throughout this hemisphere, that Bolivar spoke of his desire to see the Americas fashioned into the greatest region in the world, “greatest,” he said, “not so much by virtue of her area and her wealth, as by her freedom and her glory.”"
