Quotations:

"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." (Edmund Burke)

From One Man's America, by Alistair Cooke: On the 19th of May, 1780, as Mr. Cooke describes it, in Hartford, Connecticut, the skies at noon turned from blue to gray and by mid-afternoon had blackened over so densely that, in that religious age, men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session. And as some men fell down in the darkened chamber and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the Speaker of the House, one Colonel Daveport, came to his feet. And he silenced the din with these words: "The Day of Judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought."

From Dante's Inferno.

Casket Information: President Kennedy had two caskets. The first, which was used in transit from Parkland Memorial Hospital to Bethesda Naval Hospital, was a Handley Britannia model manufactured by the Elgin Casket Company. The casket, a 400-pound, double-walled, hermetically sealed coffin made of solid bronze, was damaged when it was removed from Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on November 22, 1963. The second (burial) casket was selected at Joseph Gawler's Sons, Inc. of Washington, D.C. Manufactured by the Marsellus Casket Company, the coffin was made of hand-rubbed, 500-year-old African mahogany and upholstered in white rayon.
