The stimulus for insulin-antibody formation and the mechanism of the hypoglycemia in this condition remain unknown. Three patients with this rare syndrome had severe hypoglycemia of limited duration. Two had received a drug containing a sulfhydryl group (methimazole and penicillamine) as treatment for an autoimmune disorder (Graves' disease and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively). A third patient who underwent surgery for a suspected insulinoma was found to have pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia. Drugs containing a sulfhydryl group may have a role in the etiology of the syndrome. Additionally, our findings suggest a relationship between circulating insulin antibodies and beta cell hyperplasia.\n\nSevere hypoglycaemia in a person with insulin autoimmune syndrome accompanied by insulin receptor anomaly type B.\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, T; Itoh, M; Hanashita, J; Itoi, T; Matsumoto, T; Ono, Y; Imamura, S; Hayakawa, N; Suzuki, A; Mizutani, Y; Uchigata, Y; Oda, N\n\n2007-11-01\n\nA rare case of the insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) accompanied by insulin receptor anomaly is reported. Antibodies to insulin and insulin receptor were determined in the patient with severe hypoglycaemia before and after the treatment with prednisolone. Titers of antibody to insulin and insulin receptors were 73.0% and 41.5%, respectively. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests were all negative for the suspicious drugs. Her HLA-DR was DRB1*0403/04051. Following steroid therapy, the formation of antibodies was suppressed and alleviated her symptoms. Scatchard analysis yielded findings specific to polyclonal antibodies. The changes in autoantibodies resulted in alleviation of the hypoglycemic symptoms as a result of steroid therapy.\n\nAn uncommon cause of hypoglycemia: insulin autoimmune syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavas-Erdeve, Senay; YÄ±lmaz Agladioglu, Sebahat; Onder, Asan; Peltek Kendirci, Havva Nur; Bas, Veysel Nijat; Sagsak, Elif; Cetinkaya, Semra; Aycan, Zehra\n\n2014-01-01\n\nInsulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is a condition characterized by hypoglycemia associated with the presence of autoantibodies to insulin in patients who have not been injected with insulin. A female patient (aged 16 years and 3 months) presented with the complaint of being overweight. Physical examination revealed a body weight of 78.2 kg (+2.6 SD) and a height of 167 cm (+0.73 SD). While the patient's fasting blood glucose level was found to be 40 mg/dl, blood ketone was negative and the serum insulin level was determined as 379 mIU/ml. The patient was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Abdominal ultrasound, pancreas MRI and endoscopic ultrasound were normal. The daily blood glucose profile revealed postprandial hyperglycemia and reactive hypoglycemia in addition to fasting hypoglycemia. The results of anti-insulin antibody measurements were as high as 41.8% (normal range 0-7%). A 1,600-calorie diet containing 40% carbohydrate and divided into 6 meals a day was given to the patient. Simple sugars were excluded from the diet. Hypoglycemic episodes were not observed, but during 2 years of observation, serum levels of insulin and anti-insulin antibodies remained elevated. In all hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases, IAS should be considered in the differential diagnosis and insulin antibody measurements should be carried out. Â© 2014 S.

A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (75 gOGTT) showed a marked increase in the plasma insulin level and impaired glucose tolerance. The patient exhibited a high titer of plasma anti-insulin autoantibodies. Her diagnosis was insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS). Following the cessation of loxoprofen-sodium (LOXs), she experienced no further hypoglycemic episodes. However, the hypoglycemic attacks recurred following the accidental readministration of LOXs in an adhesive skin patch. Considering the changes in the titer of anti-insulin autoantibodies, the repeated 75 gOGTT and the repeated Scatchard analysis, we determined LOXs to be the cause of the IAS and evaluated the characteristics of the autoantibodies.\n\nGliclazide-Induced Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome: A Rare Case Report and Review on Literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Xiu; Yuan, Lu; Hu, Yun; Zhu, Yunqing; Yang, Fan; Jiang, Lanlan; Yan, Rengna; Luo, Yong; Zhao, Enhui; Liu, Chenxiao; Wang, Ying; Li, Qi; Cao, Xin; Li, Qian; Ma, Jianhua\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInsulin Autoimmune Syndrome (IAS) is a rare condition characterized by the combination of recurrent severely spontaneous hypoglycemia without evidence of exogenous insulin administration, high concentration of total serum insulin, and the presence of a high titer of insulin autoantibody (IAA). But now we describe a case with IAS caused by gliclazide and hardly occuring hypoglycemia. A 70-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presented to our department with poor glycemic control without evidence of hypoglycemia, but the levels of serum insulin and IAA were very high. He had no exogenous insulin administration history. Switching antidiabetic therapy from gliclazide to acarbose and metformin, the patient's serum insulin level and IAA decreased gradually. Accordingly, the glycemic control improved and there was no episode of hypoglycemia. Hence, clinicians should pay more attention to type 2 diabetic patients treated with gliclazide and detect their serum insulin concentration and IAA to exclude or diagnose IAS and perform the best therapeutic regimen to these patients.

Over 200 patients have been described from Japan with significantly less numbers being reported from outside the Orient. IAS is more common in patients older than 40âyr of age with reports in the pediatric age group being notably rarer. Exposure to sulfhydryl group containing medications is implicated in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. In this report, we describe a case of IAS in an African-American adolescent. A 16-yr-old healthy African-American male was diagnosed with Graves' disease and started on Methimazole. Four weeks later, he was found unconscious and hypoglycemic (blood sugar 1.5âmmol/L). Evaluation was negative for insulinoma. Insulin antibodies were positive. Oral glucose tolerance test revealed elevated free insulin concentrations with disproportionately elevated total insulin levels. The patient was started on prednisone, diazoxide, and propranolol for management of IAS and hyperthyroidism. Thyroid radio-ablation was subsequently undertaken. The doses of prednisone and diazoxide were tapered and these medications discontinued after 9âmonths. The insulin antibody levels decreased gradually and became undetectable in 6âmonths with resolution of the hypoglycemia. Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.\n\nRemission of insulin autoimmune syndrome in a patient with Grave's disease by treatment with methimazole.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkabe, R; Inaba, M; Hosoi, M; Ishimura, E; Kumeda, Y; Nishizawa, Y; Morii, H\n\n1999-06-01\n\nThe patient, a 24-year-old man, had suffered from hunger, sweating, tachycardia and palpitation for three years. He was diagnosed as having Graves' disease (GD) and treated with methimazole (MMI) for 3 months. He noted that palpitation and perspiration seemed to particularly occur when he was hungry, and thus he was examined to determine whether these symptoms were caused by hypoglycemia. As a markedly elevated immunoreactive insulin level and the presence of insulin antibody in serum were found, he was diagnosed as having insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS). HLA typing revealed the patient to be positive for group Bw62/Cw4/DR4, which is reportedly a specific HLA type in MMI-treated euthyoroid GD patients with IAS. In spite of the continuation of MMI treatment, the % binding of IRI decreased and the hypoglycemic episode disappeared. In contrast to the previously reported MMI induced IAS in GD cases, MMI is unlikely to have exacerbated IAS in the present case, although his HLA combination is identical to that of the previous cases.\n\nClopidogrel-Induced Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome: A Newly Recognized Cause of Hypoglycemia in a Patient Without Diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nRajpal, Aman; Kassem, Laure Sayyed; Moscoso-Cordero, Maria; Arafah, Baha M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nInsulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS), defined as hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with high titers of anti-insulin antibodies, is frequently reported in Japanese patients but rarely observed in whites. We report in this study on a 79-year-old white male without diabetes who developed IAS following exposure to clopidogrel, a drug not previously known to cause hypoglycemia. The patient presented with recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia. During one episode, serum glucose was 45 mg/dL, whereas insulin and C-peptide levels were 40,000 mIU/mL and 40 ng/mL, respectively. Additional studies revealed no intake of insulin or its secretagogues, whereas anti-insulin antibody titer was high (59.3 nmol/L). Although total insulin levels were consistently high, free insulin concentrations (polyethylene glycol precipitation) were appropriate for ambient glycemia. The patient was found to have HLA-DRB1*0404, a feature often reported in Japanese patients with IAS. Three weeks prior to symptom onset, he was started on clopidogrel, a drug that does not have a sulfhydryl group, but its active metabolite does. Clopidogrel was switched to a nonsulfhydryl antiplatelet agent, and glucocorticoid therapy was initiated. Shortly thereafter, the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes decreased, and glucocorticoids were tapered over the ensuing 3 months. No hypoglycemic episodes were noted during 6 months of observation after discontinuing glucocorticoids, whereas the total insulin and anti-insulin antibody levels normalized. The data indicate that IAS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in seemingly well individuals, even when no drugs known to cause IAS were used. Clinical suspicion of IAS can avoid expensive imaging and unnecessary surgery in affected patients.\n\nClopidogrel-Induced Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome: A Newly Recognized Cause of Hypoglycemia in a Patient Without Diabetes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajpal, Aman; Kassem, Laure Sayyed; Moscoso-Cordero, Maria\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInsulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS), defined as hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with high titers of anti-insulin antibodies, is frequently reported in Japanese patients but rarely observed in whites.

PMID:29264578\n\nHyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with insulin antibodies caused by exogenous insulin analog.\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Chih-Ting; Lin, Yi-Chun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInsulin antibodies (IA) associated with exogenous insulin administration seldom caused hypoglycemia and had different characteristics from insulin autoantibodies (IAA) found in insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS), which was first described by Dr Hirata in 1970. The characteristic of IAS is the presence of insulin-binding autoantibodies and related fasting or late postprandial hypoglycemia. Here, we report a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus under insulin glargine and insulin aspart treatment who developed recurrent spontaneous post-absorptive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with the cause probably being insulin antibodies induced by exogenous injected insulin. Examinations of serial sera disclosed a high titre of insulin antibodies (33%, normal <5%), high insulin concentration (111.9âIU/mL) and undetectable C-peptide when hypoglycemia occurred. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed persistent high serum levels of total insulin and undetectable C-peptide. Image studies of the pancreas were unremarkable, which excluded the diagnosis of insulinoma. The patient does not take any of the medications containing sulfhydryl compounds, which had been reported to cause IAS. After administering oral prednisolone for 3 weeks, hypoglycemic episodes markedly improved, and he was discharged smoothly. Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) or IAS-like situation should be one of the differential diagnosis in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.Although less reported, insulin antibodies (IA) caused by exogenous insulin analog should be considered as the cause of hypoglycemia.Patients with suspected insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) should be screened for drugs related to autoimmunity to endogenous insulin.\n\nAutoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeld's syndrome) - An update.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatad, A; Quaresma, M; Brown, S; Cohen Tervaert, J W; RodrÃ­guez-Pint, I; Cervera, R; Perricone, C; Shoenfeld, Y\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAutoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) has been widely described in many studies conducted thus far. The syndrome incorporates five immune-mediated conditions, all associated with previous exposure to various agents such as vaccines, silicone implants and several others. The emergence of ASIA syndrome is associated with individual genetic predisposition, for instance those carrying HLA-DRB1*01 or HLA-DRB4 and results from exposure to external or endogenous factors triggering autoimmunity. Such factors have been demonstrated as able to induce autoimmunity in both animal models and humans via a variety of proposed mechanisms. In recent years, physicians have become more aware of the existence of ASIA syndrome and the relationship between adjuvants exposure and autoimmunity and more cases are being reported. Accordingly, we have created a registry that includes at present more than 300 ASIA syndrome cases that have been reported by different physicians worldwide, describing various autoimmune conditions induced by diverse adjuvants. In this review, we have summarized the updated literature on ASIA syndrome and the knowledge accumulated since 2013 in order to elucidate the association between the exposure to various adjuvant agents and its possible clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we especially referred to the relationship between ASIA syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).\n\nClues to immune tolerance: The monogenic autoimmune syndromes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWaterfield, Michael; Anderson, Mark S.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAutoimmune disease affects a significant proportion of the population. The etiology of most autoimmune diseases is largely unknown, but it is thought to be multifactorial with both environmental and genetic influences. Rare monogenic autoimmune diseases, however, offer an invaluable window into potential disease mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS1), the immunedysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX), and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Significantly, the information gained from the study of these diseases has provided new insights into more common autoimmune disease and have yielded new diagnostics and therapeutic opportunities.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity among pediatric patients with Turner syndrome. The study was retrospective and included 41 girls with Turner syndrome aged 6-18 years. Free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies, and karyotype were investigated. The correlation between karyotype and incidence of thyroid autoimmunity was also examined. Eleven patients (26.8%) were positive for TPO-Ab and/or TG-Ab. Three girls from that subgroup were euthyroid, 5 had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 3 were diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism. Out of these 11 patients affected by thyroid autoimmunity, 6 girls had mosaic karyotype with X-isochromosome (n = 4) or with deletions (n = 2), and 5 had the 45,X karyotype. The study findings confirmed a high incidence of thyroid autoimmunity in girls with Turner syndrome, but we failed to observe an association between the incidence of thyroid autoimmunity and karyotype. We conclude that it is important to monitor thyroid function in patients with Turner syndrome because they are prone to develop hypothyroidism.\n\nFamilial juvenile autoimmune hypothyroidism, pituitary enlargement, obesity, and insulin resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nReutrakul, Sirimon; Hathout, Eba H; Janner, Donald; Hara, Manami; Donfack, Joseph; Bass, Joseph; Refetoff, Samuel\n\n2004-04-01\n\nThe proband, a 9-year-old Hispanic female, presented with hair loss, strabismus, and weight gain. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) she was found to have severe primary hypothyroidism and a large pituitary mass. In addition, acanthosis nigricans, obesity, and hyperinsulinism were observed. Findings were similar in three of four siblings. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were detected in the father and three of four siblings. Although all family members were obese, and hyperinsulinemia with high proinsulin and C-peptide was found in all except one sibling, only the mother and one child had overt type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the unusual association of autoimmune thyroid disease, insulin resistance and obesity rather than insulin deficiency, we searched for possible genetic abnormalities. The HLA haplotypes did not cosegregate with autoimmune thyroid disease or insulin resistance. Mutational analysis of known obesity genes was done. Leptin was not deficient, and sequencing of the proband's DNA showed no mutations in the perixisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, PPAR-gamma(2), PPAR-alpha or melanocortin 4 receptor genes. Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness was ruled out since no mutations were found in mitochondria DNA. Insulin receptor antibodies were not detected. In conclusion, the remarkably high incidence of childhood autoimmune hypothyroidism, pituitary enlargement, insulin resistance and obesity in this family is not linked to known HLA types or known gene defects.\n\nAutoimmune liver disease in Noonan Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoddo, Italia; Romano, Claudio; Cutrupi, Maria Concetta; Sciveres, Marco; Riva, Silvia; Salpietro, Annamaria; FerraÃ¹, Valeria; Gallizzi, Romina; Briuglia, Silvana\n\n2015-03-01\n\nNoonan Syndrome (NS) is characterized by short stature, typical facial dysmorphology and congenital heart defects. The incidence of NS is estimated to be between 1:1000 and 1:2500 live births. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In approximately 50% of cases, the disease is caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12, resulting in a gain of function of the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 protein. Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) is a cryptogenic, chronic and progressive necroinflammatory liver disease. Common features of AIH are hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG), presence of circulating autoantibodies, histological picture of interface hepatitis and response to immunosuppressant drugs. Conventional treatment with Prednisone and Azathioprine is effective in most patients. We describe the case of a 6 years-old girl with Noonan Syndrome and Autoimmune Hepatitis type 1. Molecular analysis of PTPN11 gene showed heterozygous mutation c.923A>G (Asn308Ser) in exon 8. Though association between NS and autoimmune disorders is known, this is the second case of association between Noonan Syndrome and Autoimmune Hepatitis type 1 described in literature. In the management of NS, an accurate clinical evaluation would be recommended. When there is a clinical suspicion of autoimmune phenomena, appropriate laboratory tests should be performed with the aim of clarifying whether the immune system is involved in NS. We think that autoimmunity represents a characteristic of NS, even if the etiopathogenesis is still unknown. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

He had tachycardia and a fever. He had a 25-year history of insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) images showed fresh infarction in the right hemisphere, and carotid ultrasonography showed stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). We determined that atherothrombotic brain infarction had likely occurred. After admission, the right ICA became narrow and finally occluded. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a thrombus in the right ICA, and gadolinium-enhanced MRA showed vasculitis of the ICA. In laboratory tests, his thyroid hormones were elevated. He was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. After treatment, the tachycardia and high fever were improved. Because of a positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody test result, he was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We found that he had anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome because he was positive for anti-beta-glycoprotein I antibody. These findings suggested that his condition was autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3. He received prednisolone and warfarin. After 3 months, his neurological findings were improved; however, occlusion of the ICA remained. Autoimmunity was considered to be the cause of ICA occlusion. Ischemic stroke with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome is very rare and is associated with progressive carotid lesions in juvenile patients. It is necessary to diagnose and treat this condition as soon as possible.\n\nIs disomic homozygosity at the APECED locus the cause of increased autoimmunity in Down's syndrome?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShield, J.; Wadsworth, E.; Hassold, T.; Judis, L. A.; Jacobs, P.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nAIMSâTo examine the age of onset of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in children with Down's syndrome compared with non-trisomic individuals, and to assess whether differences might be related to disomic homozygosity at the autoimmune polyglandular disease type 1 (APECED) gene locus.â¨METHODSâChildren with Down's syndrome and IDDM were identified through the Down's syndrome association newsletter and from paediatricians. DNA was extracted from mouthbrush preparations provided by the parents and patients using standard techniques. Mapping techniques were then used to identify areas of reduction to homozygosity, including a marker that overlaps the locus for APECED. The frequency of disomic homozygosity for all markers (n = 18) was compared with a control group of 99 patients with Down's syndrome and their parents. The families also answered a questionnaire concerning diabetes and related autoimmune conditions in the family. Details were compared with the British Paediatric Surveillance Group 1988diabetes study.â¨RESULTSâChildren with Down's syndrome and IDDM were diagnosed significantly earlier than the general population (6.7 v 8.0 years) with a far higher proportion diagnosed in the first 2 years of life (22% v 7%). There was no evidence of increased disomic homozygosity in the region of the APECED locus in Down's syndrome patients with IDDM compared with simple Down's syndrome.â¨CONCLUSIONSâThe natural history of IDDM in Down's syndrome is different from that of the general population. Although children with Down's syndrome have features similar to cases of APECED, disomic homozygosity in this region does not explain the predilection for autoimmune disease.â¨â¨ PMID:10490523\n\nThe value of Autoimmune Syndrome Induced by Adjuvant (ASIA) - Shedding light on orphan diseases in autoimmunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nSegal, Yahel; Dahan, Shani; Sharif, Kassem; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Watad, Abdulla; Amital, Howard\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAutoimmune Syndrome Induced by Adjuvant (ASIA) is a definition aimed to describe the common etiological process at the root of five clinical entities sharing similar symptomatology: macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome (MMF), Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), sick building syndrome (SBS), siliconosis, and post vaccination autoimmune phenomena. ASIA illustrates the role of environmental immune stimulating agents, or adjuvants, in the instigation of complex autoimmune reactions among individuals bearing a genetic preponderance for autoimmunity. The value of ASIA lies first in the acknowledgment it provides for patients suffering from these as yet ill-defined medical conditions. Equally important is the spotlight it sheds for further research of these poorly understood conditions sharing a common pathogenesis. In this article we elaborate on the significance of ASIA, review the current evidence in support of the syndrome, and address recent reservations raised regarding its validity.

On the basis of the clinical picture, they are divided into four different types. If undiagnosed and untreated, autoimmune polyglandular syndromes may pose a serious risk to patients. We report here a case of a pregnant woman with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2. She was diagnosed with Addison's disease 11 months before the onset of the pregnancy and until the end of the first trimester the disease was effectively controlled by hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone treatment. In the tenth week of gestation, the patient developed Graves' disease and the treatment with propylthiouracil was started treatment leading to the unmasking of adrenal insufficiency, which required titration of hydrocortisone dose. Our study shows that autoimmune polyglandular syndromes should be considered in every pregnant woman with any autoimmune endocrine disease and that the treatment of these syndromes during gestation may be challenging.\n\n[Coexistence of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 with diabetes insipidus].\n\nPubMed\n\nKrysiak, Robert; OkopieÅ, BogusÅaw\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAutoimmune polyglandular syndromes are conditions characterized by the combination of two or more organ-specific disorders. The underestimation oftheir real frequency probable results from physicians' inadequate knowledge of these clinical entities and sometimes their atypical clinical presentation. Because they comprise a wide spectrum of autoimmune disorders, autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are divided into four types, among which type-3 is the most common one. In this article, we report the case of a young female, initially diagnosed with diabetes mellitus who several years later developed full-blown autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 consisting of autoimmune thyroid disorder and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.The discussed case suggests that in selected patients diabetes insipidus may coexist with autoimmune endocrinopathies and nonendocrine autoimmunopathies, as well as that in some patients idiopathic diabetes insipidus may be secondary to lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and/or the supraoptic-hypophyseal tract\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: more than a FAScinating disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBride, Karen; Teachey, David\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited syndrome characterized by abnormal lymphocyte survival caused by failure of apoptotic mechanisms to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis. This failure leads to the clinical manifestations of non-infectious and non-malignant lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune pathology, most commonly, autoimmune cytopenias. Since ALPS was first characterized in the early 1990s, insights in disease biology have improved both diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Sirolimus is the best-studied and most effective corticosteroid-sparing therapy for ALPS and should be considered first-line for patients in need of chronic treatment. This review highlights practical clinical considerations for the diagnosis and management of ALPS. Further studies could reveal new proteins and regulatory pathways that are critical for lymphocyte activation and apoptosis.

Despite similarities with Wolfram syndrome, we excluded the WFS1 gene as responsible for this disease. Using combined linkage and candidate gene study, we selected ALMS1, responsible for AlstrÃ¶m syndrome, as a candidate gene. We identified a novel splice mutation in intron 18 located 3âbp before the intronâexon junction (IVS18-3T>G), resulting in exon 19 skipping and consequent frameshift generating a truncated protein (V3958fs3964X). The clinical presentation of the patient significantly differed from typical AlstrÃ¶m syndrome by the absence of truncal obesity and short stature, and by the presence of ketoacidotic insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy and diabetes insipidus. Our observation broadens the clinical spectrum of AlstrÃ¶m syndrome and suggests that ALMS1 mutations may be considered in patients who initially present with an acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes.

Diseases whose symptoms developed after such adjuvant exposure are called autoimmune/ inlammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). The group of adjuvants includes not only silicone implants, silica, squalen and aluminium, but also ink components used for making tattoos. Analyzing the available reports on the inluence of adjuvants on the development of autoimmune diseases, the conclusion is that apart from long -term silicone exposure, the coexistence of other factors such as genetic or environmental is also necessary. Metaanalyses clearly do not conirm an increased risk of developing autoimmune disease after breast augmentation with silicone implants, or tattooing, but it seems that among these patients there is a group that is more predestined to develop disease symptoms. In the general population the beneits of vaccination are obvious, and the risk of severe adverse events following immunisation is incomparably lower than the risk of developing a speciic disease and its complications, also for patients with diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Because of data heterogeneity in previous studies and dificulties in diagnosing ASIA it seems necessary to conduct further analyses of adjuvantsâ inluence on autoimmune disease development, and to reine ASIA diagnostic criteria, which now allow too easy a diagnosis of this syndrome.\n\nCocaine/levamisole-associated autoimmune syndrome: a disease of neutrophil-mediated autoimmunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nCascio, Michael J; Jen, Kuang-Yu\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLevamisole was previously used for its immunomodulatory properties to treat rheumatoid arthritis and some cancers. However, because of serious side-effects, it was taken off the market in the United States. Recently, levamisole has reemerged as a popular cocaine adulterant. Some individuals who consume levamisole-adulterated cocaine can develop a life-threatening autoimmune syndrome. In this review, the medical consequences of levamisole exposure and postulated mechanisms by which levamisole induces these adverse effects are discussed. Although agranulocytosis and cutaneous vasculitis are the major findings in patients who develop cocaine/levamisole-associated autoimmune syndrome (CLAAS), more recent experience indicates that other organ systems can be involved as well. Current studies point to neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation with subsequent antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-mediated tissue injury as a possible mechanism of CLAAS. In the past decade, the detrimental effects of levamisole have reemerged because of its popularity as a cocaine adulterant. Although infrequent, some individuals develop a systemic autoimmune syndrome characterized by immune-mediated agranulocytosis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-mediated vasculitis. Mechanistically, neutrophil antigens appear to be a major player in inducing CLAAS. Prompt cessation of levamisole exposure is key to treatment, although relapses are frequent because of the addictive effects of cocaine and the high prevalence of levamisole within the cocaine supply.\n\nInsulin-secreting non-islet cells are resistant to autoimmune destruction.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLipes, M A; Cooper, E M; Skelly, R; Rhodes, C J; Boschetti, E; Weir, G C; Davalli, A M\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTransgenic nonobese diabetic mice were created in which insulin expression was targeted to proopiomelanocortin-expressing pituitary cells. Proopiomelanocortin-expressing intermediate lobe pituitary cells efficiently secrete fully processed, mature insulin via a regulated secretory pathway, similar to islet beta cells. However, in contrast to the insulin-producing islet beta cells, the insulin-producing intermediate lobe pituitaries are not targeted or destroyed by cells of the immune system. Transplantation of the transgenic intermediate lobe tissues into diabetic nonobese diabetic mice resulted in the restoration of near-normoglycemia and the reversal of diabetic symptoms. The absence of autoimmunity in intermediate lobe pituitary cells engineered to secrete bona fide insulin raises the potential of these cell types for beta-cell replacement therapy for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Although the relation between molecular channel defects and clinical symptoms has been explained in the case of many neuromuscular channelopathies, the pathophysiology of auto-immunity in neuropsychiatric syndromes is still unclear. To review recent findings regarding neuronal auto-immune reactions in severe neuropsychiatric syndromes. Using PubMed, we consulted the literature published between 1990 and August 2014 relating to the occurrence of auto-immune antibodies in severe and persistent neuropsychiatric syndromes. Auto-antibodies have only limited access to the central nervous system, but if they do enter the system they can, in some cases, cause disease. We discuss recent findings regarding the occurrence of auto-antibodies against ligand-activated receptor channels and potassium channels in neuropsychiatric and neurological syndromes, including schizophrenia and limbic encephalitis. Although the occurrence of several auto-antibodies in schizophrenia has been confirmed, there is still no proof of a causal relationship in the syndrome. We still have no evidence of the prevalence of auto-immunity in neuropsychiatric syndromes. The discovery that an antibody against an ion channel is associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders may mean that in future it will be possible to treat patients by means of immunosuppression, which could lead to an improvement in a patient's cognitive abilities.\n\n[SPECIFIC CLINICAL FEATURES OF TYPE 1 AUTOIMMUNE POLYGLANDULAR SYNDROME].\n\nPubMed\n\nMikhina, M S; Molashenko, N V; Troshina, E A; Orlova, E M; Sozaeva, L S; Eystein, S H; Breivik, S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAutoimmune polyglandular syndrome is a primary autoimmune disorder affecting two or more peripheral endocrine glands and responsible for their incompetence. It is frequently combined with various organ-specific non-endocrine diseases. Patients with this pathology need life-long replacement therapy and dynamic observation by endocrinologists and other specialists to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and detect new components of the disease. We report a variant of type 1 autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Special emphasis is laid on the importance of succession of actions of endocrinologists and specialists in related medical disciplines dealing with children and adult patients.\n\nHow I treat autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOliveira, JoÃ£o Bosco\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) represents a failure of apoptotic mechanisms to maintain lymphocyte homeostasis, permitting accumulation of lymphoid mass and persistence of autoreactive cells that often manifest in childhood with chronic nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurring multilineage cytopenias. Cytopenias in these patients can be the result of splenic sequestration as well as autoimmune complications manifesting as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune neutropenia. More than 300 families with hereditary ALPS have now been described; nearly 500 patients from these families have been studied and followed worldwide over the last 20 years by our colleagues and ourselves. Some of these patients with FAS mutations affecting the intracellular portion of the FAS protein also have an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. The best approaches to diagnosis, follow-up, and management of ALPS, its associated cytopenias, and other complications resulting from infiltrative lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity are presented.

John; Cowen, Edward W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) is a severe, multisystem adverse drug reaction that may occur following the use of numerous medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, and minocycline hydrochloride. Long-term autoimmune sequelae of DHS have been reported, including hypothyroidism. Observations A 15-year-old female adolescent developed DHS 4 weeks after starting minocycline therapy for acne vulgaris. Seven weeks later she developed autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves disease), and 7 months after discontinuing minocycline therapy she developed autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus. In addition, she developed elevated titers of several markers of systemic autoimmune disease, including antinuclear, anti-SjÃ¶gren syndrome A, and anti-Smith antibodies. Conclusions Minocycline-associated DHS may be associated with multiple autoimmune sequelae, including thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and elevated markers of systemic autoimmunity. Long-term follow-up is needed in patients with DHS to determine the natural history of DHS-associated sequelae.

A review of case reports and small series suggest as many as 10% of MDS patients may experience various autoimmune syndromes. Clinical manifestations of such phenomena may include an acute systemic vasculitic syndrome, skin vasculitis, fever, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrates, peripheral polyneuropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, and even classical connective tissue disorders, such as relapsing polychondritis. On the other hand, asymptomatic immunologic abnormalities have also been reported in these patients. These autoimmune manifestations frequently respond to immunosuppressive agents including steroids and occasional hematologic responses to steroid therapy have also been reported. We report five patients with history of MDS who manifested different spectrums of autoimmune phenomena including: pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), vasculitis, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We also review the incidence, nature, course and response to therapy of these manifestations and discuss potential pathogenic mechanisms.\n\nCoexistence of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrysiak, Robert; Samborek, Malgorzata\n\n2011-11-01\n\nAutoimmune polyglandular syndromes are rarely diagnosed conditions characterized by the association of at least 2 organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Very few cases of these syndromes have been described during pregnancy. The authors report a case of a patient diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and a history of HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet) syndrome in a prior pregnancy. After increasing the levothyroxine dose, she developed Addisonian crisis. Normalization of adrenal cortex function resulted in the appearance of diabetes insipidus. This report shows that pregnancy may influence the course of preexisting endocrine disorders and lead to their unmasking. Although the risk of the development of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes during pregnancy is small, they may pose a serious health problem. The possible presence of these clinical entities should be considered in every woman with 1 or more endocrine disturbances.\n\nMetabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in obese adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nGobato, Amanda Oliva; Vasques, Ana Carolina J; Zambon, Mariana Porto; Barros Filho, Antonio de Azevedo; Hessel, Gabriel\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTo verify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in obese adolescents and its relationship with different body composition indicators. A cross-sectional study comprising 79 adolescents aged ten to 18 years old. The assessed body composition indicators were: body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, abdominal circumference, and subcutaneous fat. The metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed by Cook et al. The insulin resistance was determined by the Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index for values above 3.16. The analysis of ROC curves was used to assess the BMI and the abdominal circumference, aiming to identify the subjects with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. The cutoff point corresponded to the percentage above the reference value used to diagnose obesity. The metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 45.5% of the patients and insulin resistance, in 29.1%. Insulin resistance showed association with HDL-cholesterol (p=0.032) and with metabolic syndrome (p=0.006). All body composition indicators were correlated with insulin resistance (p<0.01). In relation to the cutoff point evaluation, the values of 23.5 and 36.3% above the BMI reference point allowed the identification of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The best cutoff point for abdominal circumference to identify insulin resistance was 40%. All body composition indicators, HDL-cholesterol and metabolic syndrome showed correlation with insulin resistance. The BMI was the most effective anthropometric indicator to identify insulin resistance.\n\n[Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, Vera; Conde, Marta; Figueiredo, AntÃ³nio; Vasconcelos, JÃºlia; Dias, Alexandra\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is an impairment of lymphocyte apoptosis expressed by generalized non-malignant lymphoproliferation, lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly.

Clinical pearls and pitfalls are emphasized for the use of the practicing allergist and the fellow in-training. The diagnosis of ALPS was guided by published criteria. A careful history and workup were needed to exclude other possible etiologies for the patient's symptoms and physical findings. ALPS often carries significant morbidity and is best managed through a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nMetabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in obese adolescents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGobato, Amanda Oliva; Vasques, Ana Carolina J.; Zambon, Mariana Porto; Barros, Antonio de Azevedo; Hessel, Gabriel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: To verify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in obese adolescents and its relationship with different body composition indicators.

High transferrin saturation is not a common finding in above diseases except for iron overload syndrome. We encountered a challenging case of 73-year-old female who presented with yellowish discoloration of skin, dark color urine and dull abdominal pain. Initial laboratory tests reported mild anemia; elevated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and transferrin saturation. We came to the final diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis after extensive workups. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disease, and the diagnosis can be further complicated by a similar presentation of iron overload syndrome. Markedly elevated transferrin saturation can simulate iron overload syndrome, but a liver biopsy can guide physicians to navigate the diagnosis.\n\n[Severe type A insulin resistance syndrome due to a mutation in the insulin receptor gene].\n\nPubMed\n\nRos, P; Colino-Alcol, E; Grasso, V; Barbetti, F; Argente, J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nInsulin resistance syndromes without lipodystrophy are an infrequent and heterogeneous group of disorders with variable clinical phenotypes, associated with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The three conditions related to mutations in the insulin receptor gene are leprechaunism or Donohue syndrome, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and Type A syndrome. A case is presented on a patient diagnosed with type A insulin resistance, defined by the triad of extreme insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism, carrying a heterozygous mutation in exon 19 of the insulin receptor gene coding for its tyrosine kinase domain that is crucial for the catalytic activity of the receptor. The molecular basis of the syndrome is reviewed, focusing on the structure-function relationships of the insulin receptor, knowing that the criteria for survival are linked to residual insulin receptor function. It is also pointed out that, although type A insulin resistance appears to represent a somewhat less severe condition, these patients have a high morbidity and their treatment is still unsatisfactory.

Despite the criteria adopted, PCOS is considered to be a predominantly hyperandrogenetic syndrome and the evaluation of metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity is not mandatory. Most women with PCOS also exhibit features of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia. While the association with type 2 diabetes is well established, whether the incidence of cardiovascular disease is increased in women with PCOS remains unclear. Acknowledging the strong impact of insulin-resistance in the genesis of PCOS could be helpful not only to make the diagnosis more robust, but also for conferring better cardiovascular risk prevention. Several current studies support a strong recommendation that women with PCOS should undergo comprehensive evaluation for the metabolic syndrome and recognized cardiovascular risk factors, and receive appropriate treatment as needed. Lifestyle modifications remain the first-line therapy for all obese women with PCOS. However, many of these women do not lose weight easily. Insulin-sensitizing drugs are discussed as a promising and unique therapeutic option for the chronic treatment of PCOS.\n\nFamilial Aggregation and Segregation Analysis in Families Presenting Autoimmunity, Polyautoimmunity, and Multiple Autoimmune Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCastiblanco, John; Sarmiento-Monroy, Juan Camilo; Mantilla, Ruben Dario; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana; Anaya, Juan-Manuel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStudies documenting increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases (ADs) have shown that these conditions share several immunogenetic mechanisms (i.e., the autoimmune tautology). This report explored familial aggregation and segregation of AD, polyautoimmunity, and multiple autoimmune syndrome (MAS) in 210 families. Familial aggregation was examined for first-degree relatives. Segregation analysis was implemented as in S.A.G.E. release 6.3. Data showed differences between late- and early-onset families regarding their age, age of onset, and sex. Familial aggregation of AD in late- and early-onset families was observed. For polyautoimmunity as a trait, only aggregation was observed between sibling pairs in late-onset families. No aggregation was observed for MAS. Segregation analyses for AD suggested major gene(s) with no clear discernible classical known Mendelian transmission in late-onset families, while for polyautoimmunity and MAS no model was implied. Data suggest that polyautoimmunity and MAS are not independent traits and that gender, age, and age of onset are interrelated factors influencing autoimmunity.

Because symptoms are precipitated by rising progesterone levels, treatment relies on hormone suppression. A 22-year-old nulligravid woman presented with symptoms mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. A cyclic recurrence of her symptoms was noted, and the diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis was made by an intradermal progesterone challenge. After 48 months, she remained refractory to medical management and definitive surgical treatment with bilateral oophorectomy was performed. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a challenging diagnosis owing to its rarity and variety of clinical presentations. Treatment centers on suppression of endogenous progesterone and avoidance of exogenous triggers. When these modalities fail, surgical management must be undertaken.\n\n[Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants.

They all have a common denominator: a prior exposure to immunoadjuvants, and, in addition, they also share several clinical criteria associated to chronic inflammation and autoimmune reactions. This proposal still needs to be validated by the scientific community, but nowadays is a topic of hot discussion in the literature and in various international conferences. In this revision article, we analyze the characteristics of this syndrome, the current mechanisms possibly involved in the pathogenesis, and the more recent reports regarding ASIA associated to vaccine and some foreign substances.\n\nDeregulation of Fas ligand expression as a novel cause of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome-like disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nNabhani, Schafiq; Ginzel, Sebastian; Miskin, Hagit; Revel-Vilk, Shoshana; Harlev, Dan; Fleckenstein, Bernhard; HÃ¶nscheid, Andrea; Oommen, Prasad T; Kuhlen, Michaela; Thiele, Ralf; Laws, Hans-JÃ¼rgen; Borkhardt, Arndt; Stepensky, Polina; Fischer, Ute\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAutoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome is frequently caused by mutations in genes involved in the Fas death receptor pathway, but for 20-30% of patients the genetic defect is unknown. We observed that treatment of healthy T cells with interleukin-12 induces upregulation of Fas ligand and Fas ligand-dependent apoptosis. Consistently, interleukin-12 could not induce apoptosis in Fas ligand-deficient T cells from patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. We hypothesized that defects in the interleukin-12 signaling pathway may cause a similar phenotype as that caused by mutations of the Fas ligand gene. To test this, we analyzed 20 patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome of unknown cause by whole-exome sequencing. We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.698G>A, p.R212*) in the interleukin-12/interleukin-23 receptor-component IL12RB1 in one of these patients. The mutation led to IL12RB1 protein truncation and loss of cell surface expression. Interleukin-12 and -23 signaling was completely abrogated as demonstrated by deficient STAT4 phosphorylation and interferon Î³ production. Interleukin-12-mediated expression of membrane-bound and soluble Fas ligand was lacking and basal expression was much lower than in healthy controls. The patient presented with the classical symptoms of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: chronic non-malignant, non-infectious lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, elevated numbers of double-negative T cells, autoimmune cytopenias, and increased levels of vitamin B12 and interleukin-10. Sanger sequencing and whole-exome sequencing excluded the presence of germline or somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Our data suggest that deficient regulation of Fas ligand expression by regulators such as the interleukin-12 signaling pathway may be an alternative cause of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome-like disease. CopyrightÂ© Ferrata Storti\n\nInsulin resistance syndrome in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nTen, Svetlana; Maclaren, Noel\n\n2004-06-01\n\nThe insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome X, metabolic syndrome) has become the major health problem of our times. Associated obesity, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes conspire to shorten life spans, while hyperandrogenism with polycystic ovarian syndrome affect the quality of life and fertility of increasing numbers of women. Whereas a growing number of single genetic diseases affecting satiety or energy metabolism have been found to produce the clinical phenotype, strong familial occurrences, especially in racially prone groups such as those from the Indian subcontinent, or individuals of African, Hispanic, and American Indian descents, together with emerging genetic findings, are revealing the polygenetic nature of the syndrome. However, the strong lifestyle factors of excessive carbohydrate and fat consumption and lack of exercise are important keys to the phenotypic expression of the syndrome. The natural history includes small for gestational age birth weight, excessive weight gains during childhood, premature pubarche, an allergic diathesis, acanthosis nigricans, striae compounded by gynecomastia, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, premature atherosclerosis, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and focal glomerulonephritis appearing increasingly through adolescence into adulthood. Type 2 diabetes, which develops because of an inherent and/or an acquired failure of an insulin compensatory response, is increasingly seen from early puberty onward, as is atheromatous disease leading to coronary heart disease and stroke. A predisposition to certain cancers and Alzheimer's disease is also now recognized. The looming tragedy from growing numbers of individuals affected by obesity/insulin resistance syndrome requires urgent public health approaches directed at their early identification and intervention during childhood. Such measures include educating the public on the topic, limiting the consumption of sucrose\n\nProteome-wide survey of the autoimmune target repertoire in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLandegren, Nils; Sharon, Donald; Freyhult, Eva; Hallgren, Ã sa; Eriksson, Daniel; Edqvist, Per-Henrik; Bensing, Sophie; Wahlberg, Jeanette; Nelson, Lawrence M.; Gustafsson, Jan; Husebye, Eystein S.; Anderson, Mark S.; Snyder, Michael; KÃ¤mpe, Olle\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAutoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1) is a monogenic disorder that features multiple autoimmune disease manifestations. It is caused by mutations in the Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, which promote thymic display of thousands of peripheral tissue antigens in a process critical for establishing central immune tolerance. We here used proteome arrays to perform a comprehensive study of autoimmune targets in APS1. Interrogation of established autoantigens revealed highly reliable detection of autoantibodies, and by exploring the full panel of more than 9000 proteins we further identified MAGEB2 and PDILT as novel major autoantigens in APS1. Our proteome-wide assessment revealed a marked enrichment for tissue-specific immune targets, mirroring AIREâs selectiveness for this category of genes. Our findings also suggest that only a very limited portion of the proteome becomes targeted by the immune system in APS1, which contrasts the broad defect of thymic presentation associated with AIRE-deficiency and raises novel questions what other factors are needed for break of tolerance.

Intra cellular vitamin D receptors and the 1-Î± hydroxylase enzyme are distributed ubiquitously in all tissues suggesting a multitude of functions of vitamin D. It plays an indirect but an important role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as reflected by its association with type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome, insulin secretion, insulin resistance, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and obesity. Peer-reviewed papers, related to the topic were extracted using key words, from PubMed, Medline, and other research databases. Correlations of vitamin D with diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were examined for this evidence-based review. In addition to the well-studied musculoskeletal effects, vitamin D decreases the insulin resistance, severity of T2D, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Vitamin D exerts autocrine and paracrine effects such as direct intra-cellular effects via its receptors and the local production of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , especially in muscle and pancreatic Î²-cells. It also regulates calcium homeostasis and calcium flux through cell membranes, and activation of a cascade of key enzymes and cofactors associated with metabolic pathways. Cross-sectional, observational, and ecological studies reported inverse correlations between vitamin D status with hyperglycemia and glycemic control in patients with T2D, decrease the rate of conversion of prediabetes to diabetes, and obesity. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from current studies, because (A) studies were underpowered; (B) few were designed for glycemic outcomes, (C) the minimum (or median) serum 25(OH) D levels achieved are not measured or reported; (D) most did not report the use of diabetes medications; (E) some trials used too little (F) others used too large, unphysiological and infrequent doses of vitamin D; and\n\n[Oral diseases in auto-immune polyendocrine syndrome type 1].\n\nPubMed\n\nProust-Lemoine, Emmanuelle; Guyot, Sylvie\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAuto-immune polyendocrine syndrome typeÂ 1 (APS1) also called Auto-immune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED) is a rare monogenic childhood-onset auto-immune disease. This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by mutations in the auto-immune regulator (AIRE) gene, and leads to autoimmunity targeting peripheral tissues. There is a wide variability in clinical phenotypes in patients with APSI, with auto-immune endocrine and non-endocrine disorders, and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. These patients suffer from oral diseases such as dental enamel hypoplasia and candidiasis. Both are frequently described, and in recent series, enamel hypoplasia and candidiasis are even the most frequent components of APS1 together with hypoparathyroidism. Both often occur during childhood (before 5Â years old for canrdidiasis, and before 15Â years old for enamel hypoplasia). Oral candidiasis is recurrent all life long, could become resistant to azole antifungal after years of treatment, and be carcinogenic, leading to severe oral squamous cell carcinoma. Oral components of APS1 should be diagnosed and rigorously treated. Dental enamel hypoplasia and/or recurrent oral candidiasis in association with auto-immune diseases in a young child should prompt APS1 diagnosis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Co-morbidities found in overweight or obese adults were not commonly found in youth three decades ago but are now increasingly \"normal\" as the obesity epidemic continues to evolve. This article is the second of six related articles discussing the co-morbidities of childhood obesity and discusses the complex association between obesity and insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Insulin resistance increases up to 50% during puberty, which may help to explain why youth are more likely to develop co-morbidities as teens. Treatment of these disorders is focused on changing lifestyle habits, as a child cannot change his or her pubertal progression, ethnicity, or family history. School nurses and other personnel can assist youth with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome by supporting their efforts to make changes, reinforcing that insulin resistance is not necessarily type 2 diabetes even if the child is taking medication, and intervening with negative peer pressure.

Exclusion criteria were: history of thyroid disease, current treatment with L-thyroxin or anti-thyroid drugs. Evaluation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroid hormones and anti-thyroid antibodies was performed. Thyroid volume was measured by ultrasonography. IR was assessed using the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) formula. In the study group 22% of subjects had insulin resistance defined as eGDR lower or equal to 7.5 mg/kg/min. The prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity (positivity for ATPO or ATg or TRAb) in the study group was 37%. There were no significant differences in the concentration of TSH, FT3, FT4, the prevalence of AIT and hypothyroidism between IR and insulin sensitive (IS) group. Mean (Â±SD) thyroid volume was 15.6 (Â±6.2) mL in patients with IR and 11.7 (Â±4.7) mL in IS subjects (pâ=â.002). Thyroid volume correlated inversely with eGDR (râ=â-0.35, pâ<â.001). In a multivariate linear regression model the association between thyroid volume and eGDR was independent of sex, age, duration of diabetes, daily insulin dose, BMI, cigarette smoking, TSH value and presence of thyroid autoimmunity (beta: -0.29, pâ=â.012). Insulin resisance is associated with larger thyroid volume in patients with type 1 diabetes independently of sex, body mass index, TSH value and presence of autoimmune thyroid disease.\n\nImmune complex-mediated autoimmunity in a patient With Smith-Magenis syndrome (del 17p11.2).\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Jianying; Chandrasekharappa, Settara C; Vilboux, Thierry; Smith, Ann C M; Peterson, Erik J\n\n2014-08-01\n\nSmith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a sporadic congenital disorder involving multiple organ systems caused by chromosome 17p11.2 deletions.

We report the first case of SMS-associated autoimmunity in a woman who presented with adult onset of multiple autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis. Molecular analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism array confirmed a de novo 3.8-Mb deletion (breakpoints, chr17: 16,660,721-20,417,975), resulting in haploinsufficiency for TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor).

The discordant forms of treatment for hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis have made medical management of these patients difficult. We report our experience in using corticosteroids as first line therapy for the hepatitis C-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome. Seven patients with this overlap syndrome (diagnosis based on the presence of serum hepatitis C antibody by RIBA and serum hepatitis C RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and serum hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated ANA or ASMA titers, or histological findings consistent with autoimmune hepatitis) were treated with prednisone with or without azathioprine or cyclosporine, and followed for a median duration of 44.5 months. Five patients (71%) showed improvement of median serum ALT level from 162 U/L to 38 U/L (p = 0.04) and median serum gamma-globulin from 2.1 g/dl to 1.4 g/dl (p = 0.04) by 6 months of therapy. The mean modified histological activity index score also decreased from 11.4 +/- 2.5 to 6.6 +/- 2.6 (p = 0.04) by at least 1 yr of therapy. One patient discontinued prednisone while taking azathioprine and experienced a rebound elevation of serum ALT that did not respond to retreatment with prednisone. Antiviral therapy was subsequently administered and resulted in biochemical and virologic response. Hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable in all other patients. Corticosteroids are beneficial as a first line therapy for some patients with the hepatitis C-autoimmune overlap syndrome, resulting in appreciable biochemical and histological response but without viral eradication.\n\nImmune Dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-Linked Syndrome: A Paradigm of Immunodeficiency with Autoimmunity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarzaghi, Federica; Passerini, Laura; Bacchetta, Rosa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nImmune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is a rare monogenic primary immunodeficiency (PID) due to mutations of FOXP3, a key transcription factor for naturally occurring (n) regulatory T (Treg) cells. The dysfunction of Treg cells is the main pathogenic event leading to the multi-organ autoimmunity that characterizes IPEX syndrome, a paradigm of genetically determined PID with autoimmunity. IPEX has a severe early onset and can become rapidly fatal within the first year of life regardless of the type and site of the mutation. The initial presenting symptoms are severe enteritis and/or type-1 diabetes mellitus, alone or in combination with eczema and elevated serum IgE. Other autoimmune symptoms, such as hypothyroidism, cytopenia, hepatitis, nephropathy, arthritis, and alopecia can develop in patients who survive the initial acute phase. The current therapeutic options for IPEX patients are limited. Supportive and replacement therapies combined with pharmacological immunosuppression are required to control symptoms at onset. However, these procedures can allow only a reduction of the clinical manifestations without a permanent control of the disease. The only known effective cure for IPEX syndrome is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but it is always limited by the availability of a suitable donor and the lack of specific guidelines for bone marrow transplant in the context of this disease. This review aims to summarize the clinical histories and genomic mutations of the IPEX patients described in the literature to date. We will focus on the clinical and immunological features that allow differential diagnosis of IPEX syndrome and distinguish it from other PID with autoimmunity. The efficacy of the current therapies will be reviewed, and possible innovative approaches, based on the latest highlights of the pathogenesis to treat this severe primary autoimmune disease of childhood, will be discussed.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a widely used strategy for detection of protein coding and splicing variants associated with inherited diseases. The DNA of eight patients affected by MAS [all of whom presenting with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS)], four patients affected by SS alone and 38 unaffected individuals, were subject to WES. Filters to identify novel and rare functional (pathogenic-deleterious) homozygous and/or compound heterozygous variants in these patients and controls were applied. Bioinformatics tools such as the Human gene connectome as well as pathway and network analysis were applied to test overrepresentation of genes harbouring these variants in critical pathways and networks involved in autoimmunity. Eleven novel and rare functional variants were identified in cases but not in controls, harboured in: MACF1, KIAA0754, DUSP12, ICA1, CELA1, LRP1/STAT6, GRIN3B, ANKLE1, TMEM161A, and FKRP. These were subsequently subject to network analysis and their functional relatedness to genes already associated with autoimmunity was evaluated. Notably, the LRP1/STAT6 novel mutation was homozygous in one MAS affected patient and heterozygous in another. LRP1/STAT6 disclosed the strongest plausibility for autoimmunity. LRP1/STAT6 are involved in extracellular and intracellular anti-inflammatory pathways that play key roles in maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system. Further; networks, pathways, and interaction analyses showed that LRP1 is functionally related to the HLA-B and IL10 genes and it has a substantial impact within immunological pathways and/or reaction to bacterial and other foreign proteins (phagocytosis, regulation of phospholipase A2 activity, negative regulation of apoptosis and response to lipopolysaccharides). Further, ICA1 and STAT6 were also closely related to AIRE and IRF5, two very\n\nWhole-blood viscosity and the insulin-resistance syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¸ieggen, A; Fossum, E; Moan, A; Enger, E; Kjeldsen, S E\n\n1998-02-01\n\nIn a previous study we found that elevated blood viscosity was linked to the insulin resistance syndrome, and we proposed that high blood viscosity may increase insulin resistance. That study was based on calculated viscosity. To determine whether directly measured whole-blood viscosity was related to the insulin-resistance syndrome in the same way as calculated viscosity had been found to be. Healthy young men were examined with the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp technique, and we related insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate) to other metabolic parameters and to blood viscosity. We established a technique for direct measurement of whole-blood viscosity. There were statistically significant negative correlations between glucose disposal rate and whole-blood viscosity at low and high shear rates (r = -0.41, P = 0.007 for both, n = 42). Whole-blood viscosity was correlated positively (n = 15) to serum triglyceride (r = 0.54, P = 0.04) and total cholesterol (r = 0.52, P = 0.05), and negatively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.53, P = 0.04) concentrations. Insulin sensitivity index was correlated positively to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.54, P = 0.04) and negatively to serum triglyceride (r = -0.69, P = 0.005) and to total cholesterol (r = -0.81, P = 0.0003) concentrations. The present results demonstrate for the first time that there is a negative relationship between directly measured whole-blood viscosity and insulin sensitivity as a part of the insulin-resistance syndrome. Whole-blood viscosity contributes to the total peripheral resistance, and these results support the hypothesis that insulin resistance has a hemodynamic basis.\n\nSirolimus for Autoimmune Disease of Blood Cells\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2017-11-02\n\nAutoimmune Pancytopenia; Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS); Evans Syndrome; Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura; Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune; Autoimmune Neutropenia; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nAssociated autoimmune diseases in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).\n\nPubMed\n\nKakleas, Kostas; Soldatou, Alexandra; Karachaliou, Feneli; Karavanaki, Kyriaki\n\n2015-09-01\n\nType 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease with aberrant immune responses to specific Î²-cell autoantigens, resulting in insulin deficiency.

The most frequently encountered associated autoimmune disorders in T1DM are autoimmune thyroid, followed by celiac, autoimmune gastric disease and other rare autoimmune conditions. There are limited previous studies on the prevalence of associated autoimmunity, especially multiple, in children with T1DM. The present review reports on the classification of autoimmune diabetes, and on the prevalence, pathogenesis, predictive factors and clinical presentation of pancreatic autoimmunity and of all associated autoimmune disorders in children with T1DM. The impact of associated autoimmunity on diabetes control and general health is also discussed, along with suggestions regarding screening strategies and follow-up for early detection and management of the autoimmunity.

It has been estimated that by 2025 their incidence will double. Ferritin is one of the key proteins regulating iron homeostasis and is a widely available clinical biomarker of iron status. Some studies suggest that prevalence of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance increases significantly with increasing serum ferritin. Metabolic syndrome is known to be associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis as well as insulin resistance. The present study was designed to explore the association of serum ferritin levels with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. The present study was prospective, cross sectional. The study protocol was approved by IEC. The study group consisted of 90 participants (50 cases of metabolic syndrome and 40 age and sex matched controls). Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was done as per NCEP ATP III criteria. Estimation of serum Ferritin and Insulin was done by Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) while Glucose by Glucose Oxidase and Peroxidase (GOD-POD) method. Insulin Resistance was calculated by HOMA IR score. Data obtained was statistically analysed by using student t-test. We found statistically significant rise in the levels of serum ferritin (p=<0.001), glucose (p=<0.001), insulin (p=<0.001) and HOMA IR score (p=<0.0001) in cases of metabolic syndrome as compared with controls. High serum ferritin levels though within normal range are significantly associated with both metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.\n\nPrimary cutaneous amyloidosis associated with autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome and SjÃ¶gren syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYan, Xin; Jin, Jinglan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract Rationale: Primary cutaneous amyloidosis (PCA) is a localized skin disorder characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid in the extracellular matrix of the dermis. The association between PCA and other diseases, although rare, has been documented for various autoimmune diseases. PCA associated with autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cirrhosis (AIH-PBC) overlap syndrome and SjÃ¶gren syndrome (SS) has not been previously reported in the literature. Patient concerns: A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive abnormal liver enzyme levels and was referred to our department. Diagnoses: Due to the patient's symptoms, laboratory test results, radiographic findings, and pathologic results, she was diagnosed with PCA associated with AIH-PBC overlap syndrome and SS. Interventions: She was subsequently treated with a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), prednisone, and azathioprine. Outcomes: While this treatment can achieve therapeutic success, it cannot prevent complications from cirrhosis. This patient remains alive but experienced an emergent gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Lessons: While we acknowledge that this is a single case, these findings extend our knowledge of immunological diseases associated with PCA and suggest a common, immune-mediated pathogenic pathway between PCA, AIH-PBC overlap syndrome, and SS. After 12 years of follow up, clinical manifestations have developed, and these autoimmune diseases have progressed. The combination of UDCA, prednisone, and azathioprine can achieve therapeutic success but cannot prevent disease progression. Routine follow up for this patient is necessary to document disease progression.

Aerobic exercise training alone was evaluated as an intervention in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Methods Eighteen non-diabetic, sedentary subjects, eleven with the metabolic syndrome, participated in eight weeks of increasing intensity stationary cycle training. Results Cycle training without weight loss did not change insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome subjects or sedentary control subjects. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), activated muscle AMP-dependent kinase, and muscle mitochondrial marker ATP synthase all increased. Strength, lean body mass, and fat mass did not change. Activated mammalian target of rapamycin was not different after training. Training induced a shift in muscle fiber composition in both groups but in opposite directions. The proportion of 2x fibers decreased with a concomitant increase in 2a mixed fibers in the control subjects, but in metabolic syndrome, 2x fiber proportion increased and type 1 fibers decreased. Muscle fiber diameters increased in all three fiber types in metabolic syndrome subjects. Muscle insulin receptor expression increased in both groups and GLUT4 expression increased in the metabolic syndrome subjects. Excess phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser337 in metabolic syndrome muscle tended to increase further after training in spite of a decrease in total IRS-1. Conclusion In the absence of weight loss, cycle training of metabolic syndrome subjects resulted in enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased expression of insulin receptors and GLUT4 in muscle, but did not decrease the insulin resistance. The failure for the insulin signal to proceed past IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation may be related to excess serine phosphorylation at IRS-1 Ser337 and this is not ameliorated by eight weeks of endurance exercise training.

They constitute heterogeneous group of disorders, in which multiple alterations in the immune system result in a spectrum of syndromes that either target specific organs or affect the body systematically. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a possible shift of one autoimmune disease to another or the fact that more than one autoimmune disease may coexist in a single patient or in the same family. Numerous autoimmune diseases have been shown to coexist frequently with thyroid autoimmune diseases. AUTOIMMNUNE THYROID DISEASE AND OTHER ORGAN SPECIFIC NON-ENDOCRINE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES: This part of the study reviews the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease coexisting with: pernicious anaemia, vitiligo, celiac disease, autoimmune liver disease, miastenia gravis, alopecia areata and sclerosis multiplex, and several recommendations for screening have been given. AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE AND OTHER ORGAN NON-SPECIFIC NON-ENDOCRINE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES: Special attention is given to the correlation between autoimmune thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, syndrome SjÃ¶gren, systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease. Screening for autoimmune thyroid diseases should be recommended in everyday clinical practice, in patients with primary organ-specific or organ non-specific autoimmune disease. Otherwise, in patients with primary thyroid autoimmune disease, there is no good reason of seeking for all other autoimmune diseases, although these patients have a greater risk of developing other autoimmune disease. Economic aspects of medicine require further analyzing of these data, from cost/benefit point of view to justified either mandatory screening or medical practitioner judgment.\n\nAutoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by mineral oil: a health problem.\n\nPubMed\n\nVera-Lastra, Olga; Medina, Gabriela; Cruz-DomÃ­nguez, MarÃ­a Pilar; RamÃ­rez, Gabriel Medrano; Blancas, Raymundo Benjamin Priego; Amaro, Ana Lilia Peralta; MartÃ­nez, Anabel Villanueva; Delgado, JesÃºs SepÃºlveda; Jara, Luis J\n\n2018-06-01\n\nAutoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvant (ASIA) includes the following conditions: siliconosis, Gulf War syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome, and post-vaccination phenomena. Afterward, other syndromes have been recognized, such as in ASIA by mineral oil (ASIA-MO). These conditions are triggered by adjuvants and they are the result of the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. ASIA-MO is defined as the infiltration of oily type modeling substances for cosmetic purposes. It has been reported in many countries and used surreptitiously. Pathogenesis of ASIA-MO is not clear, but is characterized by chronic granulomatous inflammation, like the pristane model in mice, with increase of proinflammatory cytokines: type I interferons (IFNÎ± and IFNÃ), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and erosive arthritis. In humans, an increase of interleukin 1 (IL-1) has been found. Clinical spectrum of ASIA-MO is heterogeneous, varying from mild to severe and being local and systemic. The systemic manifestations can be non-specific and specific, meeting criteria for any autoimmune disease (AID), i.e., SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis, among others. The areas of the body where the mineral oil is mostly applied include the following: buttocks (38-72%), breasts (12-16%), lower extremities (18-22%), and face (6-10%). The penis augmentation is also common. Treatment is focused on local and systemic manifestations and requires medical and surgical management representing a challenge for the physician.\n\n[Clinical implications of polycystic ovary syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nDraveckÃ¡, Ingrid\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous and complex endocrine disease which among the female population belongs to the most widespread endocrinopathies and it is the most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism, anticoagulation and infertility.
