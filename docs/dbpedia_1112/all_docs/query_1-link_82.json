        "text": "Felföldi (Hungary) offers a broad survey of the Hungarian dance repertoire as it stood when the round dances began to spread into Hungary from neighbouring countries, and how they were met as a foreign influence that the ethnochoreologists did not engage with. He continues by presenting a catalogue that samples the variety of the rich Hungarian sources, which are currently unavailable in other languages. Describing the sociocultural and political context that nourished the substantial resistance to round dances in Hungary, Felföldi discusses the appearance of Csárdás as an alternative national dance. It has a clear similarity to the round dances, as opposed to the alternatives arising in other countries, and Felföldi discusses these similarities and differences, and the context from which the dance arose.\n\nDancing was a frequent occurrence at private gatherings, religious festivals, and civic celebrations in the early modern period. While some of these occasions were solemn affairs that called for only the most sober and stately measures, most dances featured at least an element of play. In fact, there were a substantial number of dances specifically devised as dance games; thus, attending to dancing can help us understand early modern playfulness—and its boundaries. This essay examines three types of dance games—courtship games, pantomime dances, and “social mixer” dances. It argues that these dances were not simply enjoyable recreations, but also helped communities manage potentially disruptive behavior. At the same time, this function of dancing was not uncontroversial: some critics argued that rather than containing or diverting lustful tendencies, dance games encouraged them. However, since dancing was generally considered among the adiaphora, or things indifferent, it was the contextual details of a dance—who danced it, in what style, and under what circumstances—rather than a dance’s steps that decided its acceptability and appropriateness. It is therefore important to attend to contextual details to understand how early modern dancers and spectators interpreted a dance’s significance and playfulness.\n\nBakka (Norway), discusses, and contextualises, the banning of round dances by one of Norway’s largest youth movements for about forty years from 1917. He shows how the three popular movements that built assembly houses had conflicting attitudes towards social dancing, and dealt with it in different ways. The Liberal Youth Movement, which imposed the ban, gave a variety of reasons, first among them being that it destroyed interest in popular enlightenment, which was the main aim of the movement. The movement also did not consider round dances to be folk dances, and therefore held them to be of less national and educational value. However, only the lay Christians strongly rejected round dances as having a sinful and morally corrupting effect.\n\nUntil the latter part of 1886, there was only one real ballet premiere at the Hungarian Royal Opera House: the Wiener Walzer [Viennese Waltz], performed on May 16, 1885. The piece, which proved successful in the imperial city, also received great acclaim in Budapest a few months later. The creators of the ballet did not strive for a classical plot: in the piece, individual images present the major stages of the development of the waltz, with a loose dramaturgical thread included for the sole purpose of holding the piece together and music comprised of a medley of handpicked waltzes. The piece was very well received at the time and was featured as part of the repertoire for decades. This study attempts to present danced history primarily through the reception of the piece in Vienna and, to a lesser extent, Budapest, while also touching upon its appearance in a charity performance by amateur aristocrats in Kolozsvár; furthermore, this article also emphasizes how the Wiener Walzer can ...\n\nThe period 1870 to 1920 in England was witness to a revolution in social dancing. Where once London Society waltzed genteelly and exclusively around the opulent ball rooms of its private mansions and palaces, the rising, wealthy middle classes now tangoed and foxtrotted across the new dance floors of the city's fashionable hotels and restaurants. New York not Paris became the anticipated source of dance fashion, the individual Victorian dancing master was ousted by new organizations of dance pedagogy, and the artificially fashioned and constrained body of the old aristocratic order was supplanted by the natural, free body of the modern English ballroom style. Drawing on newly researched archival material, this book investigates changes and continuities in social dancing among Britain's social élite. In the process, it raises issues of movement socialization, class and gender, national identity, self-expression and cultural leadership that resonate across the wider dance culture of modern Britain.\n\nDiscussions on the theme of ballroom dancing have grown intensely, especially when observing aspects such as leading, strength relations between partners and the roles of lady and gentleman. This article proposes to reflect on and highlight, based on literature findings, some proposals regarding leading developed in the area that seek to break with cisheteropatriarchy in ballroom dancing. Feminist studies linked to the debate on gender are presented and the concepts of \"co-leading\" proposed by Jonas Feitoza, \"active lady\" proposed by Míriam Strack and \"shared leading\" proposed by Carolina Polezi are discussed. Comments are also made on queer and gay milongas and their influence on the problematization of the concepts of lady and gentleman. The problematization of the relations between lady and gentleman, leader and follower, is still incipient with regard to its theory and is little applied in ballroom dancing teaching practices. Keywords: ballroom dancing; leading; cisheteropatriarchy; gender identity; sexuality."
