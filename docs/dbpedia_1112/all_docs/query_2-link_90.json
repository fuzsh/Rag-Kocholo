        "text": "Updated on June 17, 2024 by Angelika\n\nMost of Würzburg's sights can be easily reached on foot, as the city center is manageable. You can \"walk\" the highlights of the city center in one weekend.\n\nFor me, Würzburg is one of the most beautiful cities in southern Germany. Exceptional artists like the brilliant architect Balthasar Neumann and probably Germany's most famous sculptor and carver of the late Middle Ages, Tilman Riemenschneiderhave left numerous traces in churches and castles.\n\nIn addition to the artists, the city is proud of 14 Nobel Prize winnerswhose first Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen who discovered the groundbreaking X-rays in 1895\n\nWith 30,000 students in a population of 130,000, Würzburg is a very young city. Enjoy the good vibes at the Old Main Bridge, Four-Tube Fountain and the Mainauen!\n\nPlan for two to three additional days to explore Würzburg's beautiful surroundingswhere you can discover many interesting places. You will find tips after the Top 10 sights of Würzburg.\n\nThe highlights of the city center are manageable in a one day walking tour - even if you don't have much time. I have put together my tips for Würzburg in one day have been compiled for you under the table of contents.\n\nThis post contains advertising links with my recommendations (affiliate links). If you book or buy through one of the links, I get a small commission, with which you support my work. It doesn't cost you anything extra! Thank you so much!\n\nSightseeing Würzburg: The Top 10 Must-See Places\n\n1. Residence Würzburg\n\nThe Residence is Würzburg's most impressive landmark and has been listed as a 1981 for a UNESCO–World Heritage. One of the most important baroque palace complexes in Europe was created in collaboration of famous artists and architects from different countries - and that more than 300 years before the foundation of the European Union!\n\nThe City Palace of the Würzburg Prince-Bishops was built between 1720 and 1744, but the interior design was only completed in 1780. Prince-Bishop Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn appointed the young and then still unknown Balthasar Neumann as court architect for the new residence. A technical masterpiece and the most famous part of the residence is the column-free Staircase. The competent guides of the residence will explain the details to you.\n\nStaircase, Imperial Hall and Mirror Cabinet\n\nThe monumental ceiling fresco in the staircase was created by Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo who was already world famous at that time, in an incredibly short period from 1752 to 1753. With 19 m x 32 m it is the largest continuous ceiling fresco in the world. You can easily recognize the then known four continents: Africa, Asia, America and Europe. If you join a guided tour of the residence , you will learn a lot of interesting facts about the history of the creation of the fresco.\n\nIn addition to the staircase, the representative Imperial Hall is a highlight of the residence. 20 half-columns of reddish stucco marble support the large oval dome. The three ceiling frescoes by Tiepolo thematize the history of Würzburg at the time of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa, who in 1168 granted the bishop the ducal dignity and with it secular power.\n\nAnother masterpiece of the residence is the Mirror Cabinet, which was completely destroyed in 1945. Masters of their trade reconstructed it between 1979 and 1987 using the old reverse glass painting techniques. The Mirror Cabinet completed the reconstruction of the residence 40 years after the end of the Second World War.\n\nYou can find out more about the damages to the Residence during the Second World War in the Memorial Room, and about the reconstruction in the documentation room of the Würzburg Residence.\n\nCourt Church \"Most Holy Trinity\"\n\nThe magnificent court church belongs to the residence and was also designed by Balthasar Neumann The entrance to the church is a bit hidden. If you stand in front of the residence, you will find it on the right in the south wing of the building.\n\nThe Court Church is a sight in itself and is considered a prime example of Baroque architecture. The Austrian Lucas von Hildebrandt opulently decorated it with stucco, frescoes and statues in marble and gold. The two paintings above the side altars were, like the famous frescoes in the staircase and the imperial hall of the Residence, painted by the Venetian Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.\n\nIf you still have energy, you can visit the picture gallery and antique collection in Martin von Wagner Museum in the south wing of the residence.\n\nYou can digest the many new impressions during a walk in the beautiful Court Garden,which you enter through the magnificent rococo gate next to the Court Church. Here you will find a shady place on a bench in one of the arcades even on a hot summer day.\n\nA real feast for the eyes is the south garden at the back of the residence with the stone figure groups by Johann Peter Wagner, the rock fountain and the cone-shaped cut yews.\n\n2. Marienberg Fortress\n\nAnother important sight in Würzburg is the Marienberg Fortress. During the walk up to the fortress, you first cross the Old Bridge, to then continue up the Tellsteige to the castle.\n\nThe outdoor premises of the fortress are freely accessible at all times. Take your time to enjoy the magnificent panorama of the River Main and the old town, the pilgrimage church Käppele and the Würzburg vineyards.\n\nFrom the 12th century the Prince Bishops used the mighty castle as their permanent residence, and had it expanded in the late Middle Ages. After the fortress had been stormed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, Prince Bishop Johann Philipp von Schönborn initiated the construction of the bastions. At the Bombing of Würzburg by the Royal Air Force on March 16, 1945, the castle almost completely burnt down. The reconstruction was only finished in 1990.\n\nToday the fortress houses the Museum for Franconia with an extensive collection on Franconian art and cultural history. Among other things, it contains the world's largest collection of sculptures by Tilman Riemenschneider, who lived in Würzburg from 1483 until his death in 1531.\n\n3. Old Bridge \"Alte Mainbrücke\"\n\nThe Würzburg sight that you practically can't miss is the Old Bridge. It is a visitor magnet, and probably your way will lead you there directly after arrival.\n\nAt the foot of the Old Main Bridge you can enjoy the traditional Brückenschoppen A Schoppen glass holds ¼ liter of Franconian wine. You pay a deposit and may take the glass to the bridge with you.\n\nThe Views from the Old Main Bridge over the Main River, Würzburg's Old Town and Marienberg Fortress is magnificent, and the bridge itself is absolutely worth seeing. Twelve stone figures of people who played a role in Würzburg's history adorn the structure. These so-called \"Bridge Saints\" include Charlemagne and the three Irish missionaries Kilian, Kolonat and Totnan.\n\nWhen the river became more and more of a problem for the increasing trade in the 12th century, the cathedral and city architect Enzelin built a first, Romanesque stone bridge. Some parts of today's bridge are still from the original structure. From the end of the 15th century, individual piers had to be renewed because floods repeatedly damaged the structure.\n\nThe 12 baroque figures were erected around 1730. On April 2, 1945, German troops blew up the fourth and fifth bridge arches. Reconstruction was completed in 1950. The Old Bridge has been closed to motorized traffic since 1990.\n\n4. Cathedral St. Kilian\n\nWürzburg Cathedral - the fourth largest Romanesque church in Germany - has been dedicated to St. Kilian since 1967 and is definitely one of Würzburg's most important sights. It was built from 1040 to 1237, after the two previous buildings had been completely or partially destroyed by fire. The Italian Pietro Magni created the baroque stucco work in the interior between 1701 and 1704.\n\nBalthasar Neumann added the baroque Schönborn Chapel, the burial place of the prince-bishops, in the second half of the 18th century. The tombs of bishops Rudolf von Scherenberg and Lorenz von Bibra were made by Tilman Riemenschneider. Riemenschneider's tomb slab was only discovered in the cathedral's courtyard in 1822, when the cemetery was dissolved. A cast of it has been placed on the north outer wall of the cathedral. You can see the original in the Museum for Franconia in the Marienberg Fortress.\n\nThe cathedral was severely damaged at the air raid on Würzburg on March 16, 1945, and large parts collapsed in February 1946. The reconstruction lasted until 1967 and was based on the original Romanesque architectural style. Since the reconstruction in 1988, the choir room combines baroque and modern forms.\n\n5. Marketplace and Lady Chapel\n\nAnother highlight of Würzburg is the market square with the Marienkapelle (Lady Chapel) and the magnificent baroque Falkenhaus (Falcon House), which houses the tourist information office.\n\nThe Lady Chapel on the north side of the market square dates from the 14th century and is considered a masterpiece of late Gothic architecture. Despite its size, it is \"only\" a chapel, as it was not endowed with parochial rights.\n\nBefore the construction of the Lady Chapel, there was a synagogue on this site, which was destroyed in a progrom against the Jewish population of Würzburg in 1349.\n\nThe city council commissioned 1490 Tilman Riemenschneider, to make the sandstone figures of Adam and Eve for the south portal. The originals were replaced by copies during the 2nd World War and are now in the Museum for Franconia on the Marienberg Fortress,.\n\nThe tympanum on the north portalthat depicts Mary's proclamation will certainly amuse you: A twisted hose leads from God's mouth to Mary's left ear. The dove at the end of the hose symbolizes the Holy Spirit. On the hose, baby Jesus slides belly-down to Mary's ear. This would finally solve the mystery of the Immaculate Conception!\n\nThe Lady Chapel was badly damaged during the bombing raid on Würzburg in 1945. Numerous works of art were lost. The reconstruction took place from 1948 to 1961.\n\nInside the Lady Chapel there is the tomb of the knight Konrad von Schaumberg, made by Riemenschneider. Also Balthasar Neumann, the architect of the is one of the most beautiful and traditional Christmas markets in Bavaria and delights its visitors with a festive atmosphere against the impressive backdrop of the Falkenhaus and the Gothic St. Mary's Chapel (Marienkapelle). More than 100 lovingly decorated stalls shine in the city's historic market square during the Advent season, offering a wide range of handcrafted products, Christmas decorations and regional delicacies. The Würzburg Christmas market is particularly famous for its handmade nativity figures and traditional wooden toys, which are made in the region., , found his final resting place here.\n\nOther Würzburg Sights on the Market Square: \"Schwalbenlädle\", Stand-Up Café and Falcon House\n\nThe small stores on the south and west sides of the Marienkapelle (Lady Chapel) are a special feature of Würzburg. As early as 1437, the church rented out these so-called \"Schwalbenlädle\" (literally \"swallow stores\"), which stick to the church like swallows' nests, to merchants. Würzburg's smallest café is also located here, Brandstetter's stand-up café (a branch of the long-established Würzburg bakery and confectionery Brandstetter).\n\nThe tourist information is located in the most magnificent house on the market square. The House to the Falcon, also called Falcon House, originally was the residence of the cathedral priest. In 1735, the innkeeper Franz Thomas Meißner bought the house and ran it as the inn \"Zum Falken\". After Meißner's death, his enterprising widow ran the inn and had the three-gabled, richly stuccoed rococo facade built in 1751. The house burned down during the bombing raid on Würzburg in 1945. It was reconstructed in the early 1950s based on old photographs.\n\n6. Grafeneckart and Four-Tube Fountain\n\nThe Grafeneckart is one of Würzburg's top sights and is the oldest part of the Würzburg City Hall.\n\nThe Council of Citizenship, which was designated to counterbalance the Prince Bishop in Würzburg in the High Middle Ages, bought the Romanesque family tower together with the so-called Grünbaum (the side wing attached to the tower) near the Old Bridge in 1316. The unusual designation Grafeneckart commemorates the bishop's mayor and Vizegraf Eckhart de Foro, who lived in the tower and was murdered in 1201.\n\nThe tree painted on the south facade of the building is a reminder of the linden tree under which court hearings used to be held in front of the Grafeneckart and which fell in 1597. after the sentence was pronounced, the criminals were put into the dungeon in the cellar of the Grafeneckart.\n\nThe red construction was erected in the middle of the 17th century. At its portal you can see the high-water markings that date back to the 14th century. In the 19th century, the city council bought the secularized Monastery of the Discalced Carmelites.\n\nThrough the portal of the Red Building you can enter a restaurant, which is operated by the Ratskeller in summer.\n\nThe Bombing raids on Würzburg caused severe damage to the Grafeneckart. It was rebuilt in the 1950s. In the south wing the new council hall was built with a contemporary monumental painting by Wolfgang Lenz.\n\nFour-Tube Fountain - Baroque Gem and Popular Meeting Place\n\nIn front of the Grafeneckart stands the beautiful Four-Tube Fountainin rococo style. Lukas Anton van der Auwera, who also created some of the figures, was commissioned to redesign the original draw fountain in 1763. The work was completed by Johann Peter Wagner,who was a member of the Auwera workshop. The four Christian cardinal virtues - Bravery/Strength (Fortitudo), Wisdom (Prudentia), Temperance (Temperantia) and Justice (Justitia) rise on the fountain structure above four water spouting dolphins. In the center of the fountain on a coat of arms decorated obelisk Franconia guards the Würzburgers. You can see the originals of the fountain figures in the Museum for Franconia .\n\nIn the evening, the square around the four-tube fountain is very lively. Get yourself some delicious home-made ice cream at Eiscafé Fontana and enjoy the colorful hustle and bustle.\n\n7. Neumünster\n\nThe Neumünster Church is one of the most important sights in Würzburg. It's located next to St. Kilian's Cathedral. The Neumünster was built at the place where the \"Apostles of Franconia\" Kilian, Kolonat and Totnan were martyred and died in 689. First, in the eighth century, Bishop Meningoz erected a memorial building (Salvator Cathedral) for the three murdered Irish itinerant preachers.\n\nAround 1060 St. Adalbero founded the Neumünster Monastery. First a Romanesque basilica was built. The tower was added during the expansion in the 12th and 13th centuries. The baroque west building with the dome and the impressive west facade was built by Joseph Greissing at the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe sandstone Madonna in a pillar niche of the dome room is an early work by Tilman Riemenschneider.\n\nIn two buildings of the crypt of the Neumünster the coffins of St. Kilian and bishop Meningoz TranslatePress enables also the relics of the martyrs are kept. The urn tomb of Pastor Georg Häfner, who died in the Dachau concentration camp in 1942, is located in the crypt of St. Kilian's.\n\n8. Lusamgärtlein (Lusam Garden)\n\n9. Käppele (Capuchin Monastery Nikolausberg)\n\nA Würzburg sight visible from afar is the baroque pilgrimage church on the Nicholas Hill (Nikolausberg), which is actually called \"Visitation of the Virgin Mary\".\n\nThe Nikolausberg already developed into a place of pilgrimage during the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War. A Franconian fisherman's son placed a carved vesper image in the vineyards around 1640. Soon, mainly winegrowers and farmers wandered up to the little Pietà. A first small chapel was built after some miraculous healings occurred.\n\nPrince Bishop Johann Gottfried von Guttenberg agreed to the expansion of the chapel at the end of the 17th century after initial hesitation. When the decision was made in the middle of the 18th century to build a new chapel, court architect Balthasar Neumann - who would be surprised? - got the commission. The terraced path from the banks of the river Main to the Käppele is lined with 77 figures by Peter Wagner and 14 stations of the cross. Along the way, you can enjoy magnificent views over the city from the terraces.\n\nAs one of the few architectural monuments in Würzburg, the Käppele has been largely spared from the incendiary bombs of March 16, 1945.\n\n10. Würzburg Stein - terroir f Würzburg\n\nAlready Goethe, Hermann Hesse, Leonhard Frank and Walther von der Vogelweide knew that wine has an inspiring effect. You will meet these poets at the terroir f Würzburg. From the literature balcony, which floats above Würzburg's best vineyard \"Würzburg Stone\" on the Stone-Wine-Trail, you can enjoy the magnificent view of the city, Marienberg Fortress and the vineyards, which rise from the Main valley. The viewing bridge is surrounded by 15 stelae, each showing one of the four literary figures, who all had a special relationship with Würzburg, depending on the angle of view and the direction of the compass. At the digital showcase you get more information about the topic wine and literature.\n\nThe Würzburg stone is the largest contiguous vineyard in Germany. On the 4 kilometer Stone-Wine-Trail you can take a nice walk through the vineyards. On the way 20 information boards inform you about the History of Franconian wine and Würzburg. Here you will learn interesting facts about the Stone-Wine-Trail.\n\nWürzburg Sights in the Surrounding Area (with Map)\n\nThere are some interesting destinations within a radius of about 30 km, for which you should plan two to three additional days.\n\nFor the beautiful boat trip to Veitshöchheim - which I would definitely recommend to do - you should plan a whole day.\n\nIn another day you can do Volkach (including terroir f, Vogelsburg and Maria im Weingarten), Prichsenstadt and possibly Iphofen. I did that, but found this day tour very exhausting (however, this was the hottest day in July with around 40°C). I would recommend you to split this into two day tours - for example Volkach and Prichsenstadt on one day, Iphofen, Marktbreit and Ochsenfurt on the other.\n\nRecommended Destinations around Würzburg\n\nThe following destinations near Würzburg are worth seeing:\n\nVeitshöchheim (Tour of the castle and rococo garden!)\n\nterroir f Volkach\n\nVogelsburg Castle (View of the Main Loop)\n\nPilgrimage Church Maria im Weingarten (Mary in the Vineyard)\n\nVolkach old town\n\nSteigerwald:\n\nPrichsenstadt\n\nIphofen\n\nMarktbreit\n\nOchsenfurt\n\nExtra Tip: Rothenburg ob der Tauber (60 km)\n\nWine, Art and Beautiful Views\n\nDon't miss to do a boat trip to Veitshöchheim.

The nearest airports are:\n\nThe most convenient train connection is from the Rhine-Main Airport in Frankfurt. There is an hourly ICE direct connection to Würzburg. Travel time is about 90 minutes.\n\nFrom both Nuremberg and Stuttgart airports, you first have to take the subway or S-Bahn from the airport to the main train station. From Nuremberg airport, travel time by train is an hour. And it takes a shocking 3 hours to get to Würzburg from Stuttgart airport.\n\nBy train:\n\nThe train station is located near the old town. If you come to Würzburg for a short stay only, it is a good option to arrive by train. The city has excellent connections to other major German cities.\n\nBy car:\n\nWürzburg is conveniently located at the intersection of the A7 and A3 motorways, making it easily accessible by car from all directions. The electronic parking guidance system leads you to the parking lots and parking garages in the city center. However, keep in mind that the fees in the parking garages in the city center are high.\n\nParking in Würzburg\n\nUnfortunately, as in most large cities, there is no free parking in Würzburg's city center. But there is a free large parking lot near the city center,which, thanks to a referendum in July 2022, will also remain free of charge (at least until further notice):\n\nTalavera: There is a huge free parking lot here, unless there is an event like Kiliani or the Spring Festival (Frühjahrs-Volksfest). From here you can either walk to the city center in about 15 minutes or take the streetcar or bus from the Talavera stop This hardly saves any time, but you don't have to carry your luggage.\n\nIf you want to park closer to your (downtown) hotel, you will have to bite the bullet and park your car in a public garage, unless your hotel has its own parking spaces, but they will also charge. The cheapest parking garage in the city center is the Parking garage Theater with 16 € per day. For all other city center garages you have to pay 19 € to 24 € per day.\n\nGet an overview of all parking spaces and rates you at WVV.\n\nLocal Transport Tips\n\nThe sights of the city center are all within easy walking distance. But there is also a well-developed local transport network with buses and streetcars. The Day Ticket Solo for a single person is 4,50€, the Day Ticket Plus for two adults and their children/grandchildren under 15 years is 6,40€. A one-way ticket is available for 2,40€, a short-distance ticket (up to 4 stops after boarding) for 1,40€.\n\nYou can find all information about public transportation in Würzburg at WVV.\n\nTips for Recommended Accommodation in Würzburg\n\nI stayed at Hotel Alter Kranen (advertising link) which I would be happy to recommend. The location is super central near the Old Bridge. The rooms facing the Mainkai offer a fantastic view of Marienberg Fortress. Since the hotel is located at the main road, it is quite noisy if you open the windows. I especially liked the bright breakfast room with a view of the fortress.\n\nSince the hotel has only two (narrow) garages, you have to park your car in a public parking garage (the closest one is the Kranengarage, daily rate 19€). If you don't want to explore the surrounding area of Würzburg as well, I would recommend to come by train.\n\nOther recommended hotels in Würzburg:\n\nDAS v EVERT Hotel - at the Congress Centrum Würzburg (advertising link): Comfortable hotel in a historic building in the city center, with its own parking. Nice rooms and friendly service, the reviews say.\n\nSteinburg Castle Hotel (advertising link): Just under 2 km from the Old Bridge, this 4-star hotel sits on a hill overlooking the city. Breathtaking view and parking included.\n\nTips on Recommended Restaurants, Cafés and Beer Gardens in Würzburg\n\nRestaurant and wine house Zum Stachel:If you're in Würzburg, you should definitely treat yourself to an evening at the medieval Weinhaus Zum Stachel for the ambience alone! In the cozy courtyard, the delicious dishes with a creative touch and the Franconian wine taste twice as good! You should make a reservation here.\n\nAddress: Gressengasse 1, 97070 Würzburg; Phone: +49 931 527 70; click here to go to the website.\n\nLa Rustica: In a side alley behind the Hotel Alter Kranen I had a good meal at this \"real\" Italian restaurant. In summer, it's pleasant to sit at one of the tables on the sidewalk. Friendly service, medium price range.\n\nAddress: Karmelitenstraße 29, 97070 Würzburg; Phone: +49 931 4653 8811; click here to go to the website.\n\nLocanda Würzburg: The riverside terrace of this Italian restaurant directly on the Alter Kranen is so popular in summer that I didn't manage to get a table without a reservation on my four evenings in Würzburg. The pizzas and pasta dishes on the diners' plates looked delicious. When the weather is nice, I don't think there is a better location in Würzburg.\n\nAddress: Kranenkai 1, 97070 Würzburg; Phone: +49 931 15600; click here to go to the website.\n\nbeer garden Goldene Gans A beautiful beer garden with friendly service in a prime location below the Marienberg Fortress. The view of the bridge, the river and the city is great, at least if you get a table on the Main side. Classic beer garden dishes (bratwurst with sauerkraut, natural sourdough bread or potato salad; snacks). I had pork neck steak with potato salad, accompanied by a glass of Franconian Silvaner. I liked it.\n\nAddress: Leonhard Frank Promenade, Burkarderstrasse 2 - 4, 97082 Würzburg; Phone (reservations from 6 people): +49 176 24476389; open seasonally, in good weather daily from 11 am. Click here to go to the website.\n\nLämmle Inn: Rustic Franconian restaurant with beer garden right next to the Lady's Chapel. On a still hot summer evening, I sat on the pleasantly airy terrace thanks to the old chestnut trees. I don't expect gourmet cuisine in a beer garden. The Obatzer accompanied by a Riesling was just the thing for me that evening after my sightseeing marathon.\n\nAddress: Marienplatz 5, 97070 Würzburg; Phone: +49 931 54 748; click here to go to the website.\n\nEiscafé Fontana: Twice, after dinner, I ended the day at the Vierröhrenbrunnen with an ice cream from Fontana. The selection of ice cream specialties from their own production leaves nothing to be desired. My choice: dark chocolate with tonka - to die for! And on warm summer evenings, the vibes are guaranteed to be good in this beautiful location.\n\nAddress: Beim Grafeneckart 8, 97070 Würzburg; Phone: +49 931 3292180; click here to go to the website."
