        "text": "\"I don’t know who needs to hear this right now but one year before Alexandria Ocasio Cortez became the youngest ever congresswomen, she was working two jobs to support her mum, at a charity and as a bartender in the Bronx. She has been trolled for being working-class and not having enough experience, and she has openly admitted to regularly battling imposter syndrome in politics. She was the underdog that the media didn’t take seriously until she won and she is absolutely the type of woman we celebrate and work towards. And if you need any more reasons to love her, read this... “Women like me aren't supposed to run for office. I wasn’t born into a rich or powerful family. My dad died when I was a teenager. I’ve waitressed my way through hard times and dealt with disappointment. The dress I'm wearing is from a thrift shop. The ring on my hand is my mother’s - a reminder of every floor she's mopped so that her daughter could have a chance.” So the next time you question if you can do something let’s just remind ourselves of everything AOC stands for. \"👊👊👊👊 via F*ck Being Humble"
