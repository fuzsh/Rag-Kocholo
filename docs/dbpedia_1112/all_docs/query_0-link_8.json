        "text": "BRIDIE KING\n\nBridie King first came to national prominence as a blues and boogie pianist with her recording of Piano Frenzy on The Hippos' album Hippocracy in 1988. Bridie studied classical piano for 16 years, including 6 years at the NSW Conservatorium of Music, and has a Master’s degree in Music (Music Education) and a Diploma in Music Education. She teaches classical, blues and improvisation on piano at her home practice. Bridie taught her Blues course at the Sydney Conservatorium’s Open Academy 2003-09.\n\nThroughout Bridies's early childhood she was exposed to African-American music of the 20's, 30's, 40's, and 50's through her family's involvement with the Sydney Jazz Club and her father's love of rhythm & blues, gospel and traditional New Orleans Jazz. In the late 1970s she formed the band Mona and the Wail with her sister Sally King, on whose original soul and blues songs the band was centred.\n\nIn 1980s Bridie's work in her next two bands, The Ratbags of Rhythm and The Hippos, saw her touring major at major venues, including a support for Robert Cray at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, making many TV appearances and recording four albums. Piano Frenzy from Hippocracy received radio and TV airplay, including weekly playing for on Channel 9, and was used in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.\n\nBridie has attracted many overseas performers to play as her special guests. They include Buddy Miles ( Jimi Hendrix Band), Jimmy Vaughan (Stevie Ray Vaughan and The Thunderbirds), Johnnie Johnson. and members of Dire Straits and Soko Richardson (Tina Turner's Band). Bridie was invited as special guest to play with Blues guitar legend Albert Collins at Selina's, Coogee. Albert Collins said of Bridie - \"You can play and you cute too\". Jimmy Vaughan made the comment - \"you're really serious, ma’m’\". Doug Anderson wrote in a review of of Basement gig in the Sydney Morning Herald - \"The night cogged into overdrive with the arrival of Bridie King\".\n\nBridie became a bandleader in 1997 when she formed Bridie and the Boogie Kings. They sustained a 9 year residency at the Bridge Hotel, Rozelle. Band members over the years included guitar master Ray Beadle (1999 – 2001).Other notables include guitarists Adam Pringle, Darren Jack, Steve Edmonds, and Mitch Grainger; bassists Rowan Lane, Hal Tupaia, Pat Savina; drummers Declan Kelly, Jim Finn; and vocalists, most notably Stephy Marchant (2001 –2008), also Jerome Smith and Kara Grainger.The Bridge residency was voted inthe Top 10 of Sydney gigs in 2002 by The Sunday Telegraph. The band also played at other top Sydney live Blues venues including The Basement, and hotels The Empire, The Unity, and The Baldfaced Stag. Bridie and the Boogie Kings also played many festivals including those at Manly, Darling Harbour, Narooma, Thredbo, Wangaratta, Glebe Street Fair and the Melbourne International Women’s Jazz Festival. A writeup of the 2000 Wangaratta festival in the national paper The Australian claimed that ‘nothing beat the Blues and Boogie of Bridie King’.\n\nIn July 1999 Bridie recorded her first CD under her own name, titled My Blues. The CD attracted excellent reviews. John Shand of the Sydney Morning Herald enthused that ‘Bridie oozes vitality’ and awarded the rating of 3 and½ stars. A reviewer in the Melbourne Sun felt the music of ‘My Blues’was‘in the key of joy.’ The CD has sold 2000 copies and is on its second pressing. It has featured on the ABC shows, the Planet and AndrewFord’sprogram, and on numerous FM stations, especially on the 2MBSFM program Stormy Monday.\n\nBridie has also played live many times on radio and TV. In 2003 she accompanied Eric Burdon on Bert Newton’s Good Morning Australia and on ABC radio. With the Hippos she performed over 10 times on TV between 1986 - 1988, and under her own name on ABC radio in 2003, 2004 and 2005, and several times on 2MBSFM, most recently in 2007.\n\nFrom 2002 Bridie King researched and studied for a Music Education Master’s degree in traditional Blues and improvisation teaching methods. She graduated in 2007, and also was awarded a high distinction for her thesis and research into her students’ development in this topic. Since then she has concentrated her efforts into her busy teaching practice at home and her Blues Piano course at the Conservatorium of Sydney. However, music education has always been half of the story of Bridie’s professional life.\n\nThe other half, live performance, took a back seat during her years of Master’s research. But since 2007 she has been applying her skills in band leading and arranging in the production of her new CD ‘Way Back Home’ and in the presentation of gigs in Sydney. In April 2008 she was described as ‘a force in the Sydney soul scene’ in Fine Music magazine. That year Bridie introduced a new lineup focusing on the richness of the piano and of female harmonies with the introduction of the ‘Harmony Queens’ vocal trio, Stephanie Marchant, Narelle Evans and Karana Nepe.\n\nIn 2009 Bridie took the Harmony Queens and the Boogie Kings to several festivals, including Wangaratta Jazz and Blues, and Narooma Blues Festival, with drummer James McCaffrey and bassist Merv Sequeira . The Opera Bar at Sydney Opera House was another gig, and also the inaugural Breakfast on the Bridge event where they played on the back of a vintage truck was a highlight. The ‘Way Back Home’ CD was played on the ABC particularly the track, ‘Piano Players Blues’ on local ABC music stations nationally. The two Basement shows were played to packed houses, the first one in August was with Lez Karski and friends. The second proved to be the last of the gigs with the Harmony Queens, a great way to end a successful two year project.\n\nA new six-piece lineup in 2010 took Bridie’s repertoire as far south as possible, in terms of Southern roots music: contemporary zydeco music, slightly rearranged, and Texan rocknroll /blues. Bridie still included her piano boogie as her strong point and has added playing Hammond organ and accordion to her instrumental output. Gigs included festivals, pubs and clubs. ‘Bono’ was added to the playlist on ABC radio local stations nationally. The Basement gig (2009) with Lez Karski was aired on ABC tv’s ‘Live at The Basement’.\n\nIn 2011 Bridie took a few months off and came back to record her new album “Blue Ivories” The record features mostly piano trio instrumentals and two vocal tracks by such heroes of boogie woogie piano as Memphis Slim and Amos Milburn, repertoire you would expect from Bridie’s lifelong love affair with piano blues. Add to the boogie, tunes by Henry Butler, recently dubbed by Dr. John as the ‘pride of New Orleans’, and Professor Longhair one of the true great originators of New Orleans piano, Bridie is keeping the Louisiana flag well and truly flying . This album also features tracks by The Young-Holt Trio, soul-jazz men from Philedephia, bringing a fresh new acoustic sound to Bridie’s repertoire. There are also two originals adding a completely new sound too.\n\nLISA SCHOUW\n\nBorn in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, Lisa Schouw and family moved to Auckland, New Zealand when she was three. As a student of classical ballet, she reached intermediate level of the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus. Piano, horse riding, athletics and playing basketball were all part of her teen years.\n\nAfter leaving high school she spent two years training at the New Zealand Dance Centre and performed in a number of ballets including \"The Nutcracker Suite\" and \"La Boutique Fantastique\". The school's principal was Russell Kerr and fellow company members included Jon Trimmer who was also a principal dancer with the Nederland's Ballet Company.\n\nDuring a dress rehearsal for a season of \"The Tales of Beatrix Potter\", Lisa fell and injured her ankle. Unable to dance anymore she spent a brief couple of months at university, then worked as a lab assistant, hotel receptionist, clerical worker and completed a journalism course at Auckland Technical Institute.\n\nLisa began her singing career by doing gigs with a cabaret band and tackling the local talent quest circuit. Her desire to reach a broader audience led to a move to Australia in 1983.\n\n\"I guess I was searching for something to fill the gap inside me caused by not being able to dance anymore. I had always loved singing but had thought my voice was no good. It was only when I moved to Australia that I really started to pursue a career in music seriously.\"\n\nLisa lived in King's Cross, Sydney while she absorbed the local music scene. A move south to Melbourne led to an audition as a vocalist for local band \"Pointz\". It was in this band that she met Robin Gist for the first time. Over a period of two years, the band changed its name to \"Short Story\", played around Melbourne, almost secured a publishing and recording deal with Wheatley Records and then finally self-destructed. Lisa went back to New Zealand for about six months, but decided to return to Australia to meet up with Robin to begin writing songs for a new project.\n\nAfter auditioning various players they settled on Brett McNaughton and together the three formed Separate Tables in 1987. The band released an independent single; \"Long Dark Night\" backed with \"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\". Independent videos were shot for \"Long Dark Night\" and the song \"Blue Falls The Rain\". Both were aired on Australian TV.\n\nAfter a year of writing and gigging the band secured a recording deal with RCA/BMG, the support for John Farnham's \"Jack's Back\" Tour and spent months on the road playing Entertainment Centres and concert halls around Australia promoting the single \"When The Word Came Down\". John Favaro joined the band on bass guitar and recording began on their debut album \"Paint a Picture\" with producer Ross Fraser. The band changed it's name to Girl Overboard and put out the single - \"I Can't Believe\". The album was released in 1989, went gold and received two ARIA nominations; Best Debut Single - \"I Can't Believe\" and Best Australian Video - \"Permanent Friend\". Lisa co-wrote many of the bands hits including \"The Love We Make\".\n\nIn 1991 the band released their second album \"GO\" produced by Australian producer Charles Fisher (1927, Air Supply, Hoodoo Gurus & Savage Garden) to critical acclaim. The haunting ballad \"Jackie\" and the catchy \"Chain of Fools\" were both played constantly on Australian radio.\n\nAfter the break-up of the band in 1993, Lisa began working with her acoustic trio. She has appeared at venues such as The Harbourside Brasserie and The Tilbury in Sydney, to excellent reviews.\n\nOver the years Lisa has been involved in a number of different projects. She appeared in the 1989 Australian Feature film \"Hungry Heart\" with actor Norman Kaye as well as writing music for the soundtrack. In 1993 Lisa was invited to sing the title track on the award winning New Zealand film \"Bread and Roses\". In 1994 she collaborated and danced in a commissioned work for \"The Independent Dance Collection\" at Sydney's Performance Space. Later that year she appeared in another contemporary dance piece co-created with Dean Walsh.\n\nLisa was invited to sing at the \"Blue Moon\" Gala Benefit at the Sydney Town Hall with other performers including Max Cullen and Georgie Parker. Lisa has worked as a researcher and producer's assistant on various projects for television including; \"Missing Pieces\", \"Andrew Denton Meets Kevin Costner\", and for The Sydney Olympics \"The Journey Begins - Towards 2000\".\n\nFor the last five years she has taught acting, singing and voice at The ActorsCentre Australia, the Australian Theatre for Young People in Sydney and NIDA. She died from cancer in 2020."
