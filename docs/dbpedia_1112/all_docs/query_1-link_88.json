When you find out they have a heart condition, you’re left with just one: that they’ll make it. This is the reality for the parents of the eight Aussie babies born with CHD every day.\n\nHeartKids is bringing awareness to the children, teens and adults affected by Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in Australia in a powerful campaign by DDB Sydney.\n\nWith CHD affecting 1 in 100 babies (one born every three hours), the multi-channel campaign captures the emotional and physical impact a diagnosis can have on Australian families.\n\nLaunching with a 30-second spot that showcases just how quickly life can change when a child is impacted by CHD, the probono campaign is supported with an outdoor and digital campaign that focuses on the significance of a single heartbeat.\n\nThe campaign was coordinated by the industry’s social purpose organisation UnLtd with media strategy and planning by Initiative.\n\nSays Tara Ford, CCO, DDB Sydney: “When we look at children’s charity advertising there are accepted codes that appear time and again. To stand out in the category, we wanted to find a place that makes people uncomfortable enough to pay attention, but not uncomfortable enough to look away. We hope that the campaign will inspire empathy and support for the families affected by CHD.”\n\nSays Dianna Crisp, digital strategy and marketing manager, HeartKids: “When we embarked on this project earlier in the year, we were impressed with DDB’s dedication to the CHD community. Many people aren’t aware that CHD impacts eight babies a day and is the leading cause of disease-related disability, it also has no known cure. Bringing awareness to this disease is critical for the families who need to be supported.”\n\nAgency: DDB Sydney\n\nChief Creative Officer: Tara Ford\n\nECD: Matt Chandler\n\nCopywriter: Tom Lawrence\n\nArt Director: Sam Raftl\n\nPlanner: Jessica Sutanto\n\nGroup Business Director: Nick Cleeve\n\nHead of Integrated Content: Renata Barbosa\n\nPost Producer: Emily Wood\n\nDigital Producer: Stacey Szabo\n\nSenior Project Manager: Sally Mueller\n\nSound Designer: Andy Stewart\n\nSenior Print Producer: John Wood\n\nStudio Manager: David Collins\n\nSenior Finished Artist: José Rodrigues\n\nUnLtd\n\nKey Account Director: Saarika Shah\n\nMedia Agency: Initiative\n\nJason Maggs: Global Head of Good, Senior Director of Strategy\n\nDanielle Galipienzo: Associate Director, Client Advice and Management\n\nMaddison Keogh: Director, Client advice and Management\n\nJessykah Florido: Investment Partnership Manager\n\nPhotographer: Chris Budgeon\n\nStudio: Headquarters Studio\n\nProducer: Eve von Bibra\n\nExecutive Producer: Alison Lydiard\n\nProduction Company: Photoplay Photography"
