        "text": "3-Frank Henry Walker was born on 18 Aug 1879 in Westbury, Tasmania, died on 17 Feb 1945 in Drumreagh, Deloraine at age 65, and was buried in Feb 1945 in General Cemetery, Deloraine D101/559.\n\nFrank married Mary Paton McFarlane, daughter of James McFarlane and Janet Thompson, on 26 Sep 1906 in Hagley, Tasmania. Mary was born on 9 Jul 1871 in Westbury, Tasmania, died on 2 Sep 1951 at age 80, and was buried in Sep 1951 in General Cemetery, Deloraine D101/559. Another name for Mary was Martha.\n\nThey had five children:\n\nWilliam James\n\nFrank Trevor\n\nEdith Janet\n\nJack Thompson and\n\nMaxwell Alvin.\n\nFrank worked for a time for Hedley von Bibra, at Ulverstone, and later farmed at Kimberley; Fairleigh, Dunorlan; and Drumreagh, River Road, Deloraine, where he died in 1945.\n\nFrank and cousin Norman Walker apparently worked together in some sort of partnership involving the raising and butchering of cattle. Jack has a few fragmentary memories of an occasion on which Frank and Norman's families met at a cattle slaughtering, probably at Kimberley, using an unoccupied house as a temporary headquarters. Frank's wife Martha and Norman's Louie were present, also two of three kids from each family, and there was an old D-shaped sheet iron tank, which fortunately contained sufficient water for Martha to scrub the kids' faces before lunch. Not that she used much water. The families were so obsessed with the need to save rain water that a couple of inches of water in a battered old enamel dish was made to suffice, used in succession by all concerned. Martha gave each of three frankly rebellious little boys a vigorous scrub, using a tattered piece of old rag as a washer, and an equally vigorous rub with a towel that had seen better days. Her stocks rose a bit in the lads' estimation when she produced some very tasty cold mutton, cut into small squares, and chopped up potato onion, which Jack was experiencing for the first time.\n\nNo recollection of grace, which would inevitably have been said, and equally inevitably have been regarded by the boys as not worth remembering, and no recollection of seeing the cattle slaughtered and dressed; a positive indication that the boys weren't allowed on the scene, probably because their mothers were present, as all would previously have seen animals slaughtered, and Jack in particular was used to seeing dead animals dissected and discussed prior to burial. Norman and Frank sometimes referred nostalgically to the occasion in later years â€” \"one of the times we cleared a nice little cheque\".\n\nWhen Norman went broke, Frank obliged him by \"taking a bit of stuff', i.e. concealing a few of Norman's possessions until the selling-up process was over and creditors' demands had died down. On one occasion Norman and Jack spent the night at Frank's on the way home from the coast. Frank was away, but had left a beast's carcass to be cut up on the following morning, a task Frank's boys allegedly avoided if they could. Norman took over the task with relish, throwing in a lecture on anatomy, and expressing the opinion, quite seriously, that all surgeons should be apprenticed to butchers for at least 18 months before being allowed to practice on people.\n\nAs they drove away next day in the old jinker, Norman remarked to Jack, 'Til have to get some of that stuff home. That was my broad axe the meat was chopped up with, and my block the meat was chopped up on, and my scales it was weighed on.\" Pause. \"And my single furrow plough leaning up against the shed.\" Pause. \" That's my gun, too, the one Father gave me when I was a boy.\" (He meant a very good gun which stood in the corner of Martha's kitchen.) \"I lent it to Frank while he was teaching the boys to shoot. That old thing under the seat is Frank's gun. It belonged to old Grandfather McFarlane. You know how it kicks.\" (Too true, it did.)\n\nIncidentally, the gun was under the seat, and a rifle along the back of the seat, for the benefit of anyone Norman's associate might have put into the old homestead (The Camp), during Norman's absence. Fortunately things never quite came to the use of firearms, nor did Norman ever \"get any of the stuff home\", and Grandfather McFarlane's bitzy old gun was stolen during the process of moving out to Ashburn.\n\nThe abiding impression of a visit to Frank's was the warmth and friendliness of the reception, worth travelling miles to experience.\n\n4-William James Walker was born on 9 Apr 1908 in Buckland, Tasmania, died on 5 Aug 1978 in Deloraine Hospital at age 70, and was buried on 8 Aug 1978 in Lawn Cemetery, Deloraine, Tasmania.
