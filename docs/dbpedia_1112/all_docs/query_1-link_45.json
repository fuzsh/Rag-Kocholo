        "text": "Welcome to our Winter Newsletter!\n\nWe have updates from COPIM and the OABN, information about our new and forthcoming publications, calls for proposals, new blogs, latest reviews and more...\n\nAuthors' Survey\n\nWe would like to ask for your feedback on the publishing process with us. We would also like to collect demographic data about our authors, editors, and contributors to help us form a better picture of the communities we interact with – and the gaps in representation that need addressing. This data will remain private and the identities of those individuals who agree to participate will not be disclosed under any circumstance. If you are one of our authors, editors, or contributors please, click here to access the survey.\n\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to remind you that if you are an author or an editor of any of our titles you can access the OBP Author Reports page to find out more about readership and sales information for your book. If you are unable to log in, or have any question please contact our Marketing and Library Relations Officer Laura Rodriguez here.\n\nNew Board Member!\n\nWe are delighted to announce that J. David Velleman, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy and Bioethics at New York University and Miller Research Professor of Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, has joined as a member of our Editorial Board and Advisory Panel. J. David Velleman is the author of Foundations for Moral Relativism and Beyond Price: Essays on Birth and Death.\n\nFEATURES\n\nAuld Lang Syne: A Song and its Culture by M. J. Grant has been featured in around 350 media outlets!\n\nThis title explores the history of this iconic song, demonstrating how its association with ideas of fellowship, friendship and sociality has enabled it to become so significant for such a wide range of individuals and communities around the world.\n\nAmong the highlights are:\n\nBBC Sounds interview with Dr Morag Grant from Edinburgh Uni on Today Show discussing the origins of Auld Lang Syne.\n\n'Why do people link hands to sing Auld Lang Syne?', BBC, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Linking arms while singing Auld Lang Syne was a parting ritual of the Freemasons, expert reveal', Daily Mail, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Freemasonry behind Auld Lang Syne arm linking at new year', Irvine Times, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Auld Lang Syne arm-linking at new year connected to Freemasons', The Guardian, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Roots of Auld Lang Syne found in masonic lodges', The Times, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Author connects Auld Lang Syne arm linking to the Freemasons', Wales Online, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Freemasonry behind Auld Lang Syne arm linking at new year', The Scotsman, 31 December 2021.\n\n'Auld Lang Syne: The possible meaning behind why people link arms while singing', The Herald, 31 December 2021.\n\nThis is an Open Access title available to read and download for free at http://doi.org/10.11647/10.11647/OBP.0231.\n\nRead about the importance of this contribution on our blog at http://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0173.0189.\n\nCOPIM\n\nAccess the latest COPIM reports:\n\n* Opening the Future... in 60 seconds by WP3: https://bit.ly/3Lj4oWH\n\n* OA book published by OtF press by WP3, Tom Grady, and Martin Paul Eve: https://bit.ly/3smyjEY\n\n* COPIM statement on the corporate acquisition of OA infrastructure by Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs: https://bit.ly/3snlY3f\n\n* CEU Press publish 2nd OtF OA book by Tom Grady and WP3: https://bit.ly/3gtGQQM\n\n* Third OA book from CEU Press out today by Tom Grady and WP3: https://bit.ly/3Lle7vR\n\n* Book vs journal metrics - Q&A by Tom Grady and WP3: https://bit.ly/34uRdkO\n\nOABN\n\nThe Open Access Books Networks has released the following blogs and collaborations:\n\nSmall university presses and OA books: come and join us!\n\nOpen café for small university presses: an update\n\nCall for Reviewers!\n\nThe Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association is currently looking for reviewers for our title What is Authorial Philology? by Paola Italia, Giulia Raboni et al.\n\nInterested in reviewing this title? Contact our Marketing and Library Relations Officer, Laura Rodriguez, at laura@openbookpublishers.com\n\nCitations\n\nWe have been analysing our titles’ citation performance by comparing our books with similar titles published by traditional presses; we randomly selected a set of our books and we are overjoyed by the results:\n\nAs you can see, our titles have received a higher number of citations than those published in the same field and year by traditional presses. Open Access books gain many more readers: a university-level book typically sells only 200 copies during its entire lifetime, but at OBP our books are read around the world by an average of between 300-400 readers per title every month, and these figures do not drop off over time, as sales figures do. Also, the free availability of our titles in PDF and HTML format to everyone everywhere, not just to those who can afford it or have access to well-endowed university libraries, might have played a key part in the citation performance of our titles.\n\nOf course, gathering citation metrics presents the same problems as gathering readership metrics: it is difficult to obtain a complete picture of how a book has performed given that only a limited amount of platforms offer this information. If, for example, you visit the reports page for one of our books (https://reports.openbookpublishers.com/public/report/10.11647/obp.0086) you will see that it has been accessed more than 13,207 times. However, you will also notice that this information has been gathered from only four sources: Google Books, OAPEN, Worldreader and our website. This is because not all platforms to which we distribute our titles have the technical capacity to provide publishers with this data. Similarly, although we would like to provide our authors with the full picture of the citation metrics for their titles, we can only access information released by certain platforms.\n\nOut New: Our First Spanish Translation!\n\nThis month we have publishedReplanteando la acción social por la música: la búsqueda de la convivencia y la ciudadanía en la Red de Escuelas de Música de Medellín by Geoffrey Baker, translated by Claudia García.\n\nThis our first publication in Spanish and is a translation of our book Rethinking Social Action Through Music: The Search for Coexistence and Citizenship in Medellín Music Schools, published in 2021.\n\nOBP actively works to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in scholarly publishing by publishing and/or translating research from outside the anglosphere and into multiple languages. We have published books in German and French and soon we will publish our first title in Italian: Il 'Gabinetto Armonico' di Filippo Bonanni, written by Cristina Ghirardini.\n\nYou can access our catalogue at https://www.openbookpublishers.com/section/2/1\n\nNew Titles\n\nThese past months we have released 8 new titles in the fields of classical studies, development studies, sociology and anthropology. As always, these titles are freely available to read and download at www.openbookpublishers.com.\n\nNew Blogs\n\n* Ya Disponible: Replanteando la acción social por la música: la búsqueda de la convivencia y la ciudadanía en la Red de Escuelas de Música de Medellín by Geoffrey Baker: http://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0173.0190\n\n* On Burns Night by M. J. Grant:http://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0173.0189\n\n* Points of Contact: The Shared Intellectual History of Vocalisation in Syriac, Arabic, and Hebrew by Nick Posegay: http://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0173.0188\n\n* HOROS: Ancient Boundaries and the Ecology of Stone by Thea Potter: http://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0173.0186\n\n* Book: Points of Contact, by Nick Posegay by Melonie Schmierer-Lee: https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/genizah-fragments/posts/book-points-contact-nick-posegay\n\nNew Library Membership Programme\n\nAs you know, at Open Book Publishers, we ensure that we do not need to charge authors a mandatory Open Access fee thanks to our mixed model of funding. The support we receive from libraries is vital to help us continue our work: the income from our Library Membership Programme constitutes a third of our annual revenue.\n\nSince the membership was launched in 2015, Open Book Publishers has been steadily increasing the number of publications per year (with a growth of 275% since the first year of our membership), we have worked on the development of open-source infrastructure to lower the technical and financial barriers for others who wish to publish OA and our book accesses have increased a 310.28% - all while our membership fee remained unchanged.\n\nWe always aim to attract more libraries to our programme to reduce the amount of revenue we would need from other sources. However, to mitigate the concern over Open Book Publishers’ dependence on grants funds and to work towards a more sustainable model, we would like to introduce a new membership.\n\nOpen Book Publishers’ new membership allows institutions to choose their pricing tier and support OBP in agreement with their individual funding and subscription capacities. Our tier system consists of recommended prices that align with each institution’s size and budget. We won’t impose a tier on any institution, but we encourage institutions that are able to sign-up to their suggested tier or those that would like to join a higher tier to make their selection accordingly. Find out more information on tiers here.\n\nFree membership for libraries in economically developing countries: For institutions based in economically developing nations some fees may not apply. If you are a librarian at a university or library in such a country, or if you are interested in receiving more information on how to become a member, please contact our Marketing and Library Relations Officer Laura Rodriguez at laura@openbookpublishers.com.\n\nCalls for Proposals"
