        "text": "In this book Paolo Sachet provides a detailed account of the attempts made by the Roman Curia to exploit printing in the mid-sixteenth century, after the Reformation but before the implementation of the ecclesiastical censorship. Conventional wisdom holds that Protestant exploitation of printing was astute, active and forward-looking, whereas the papacy was inept, passive and reactionary in dealing with the relatively new medium of communication. Publishing for the Popes aims to provide an impartial assessment of this assumption. By focusing on the editorial projects undertaken by members of the Roman Curia between 1527 and 1555, Sachet examines the Catholic Church’s attitude towards printing, exploring its biases and tactics.\n\nPost-Tridentine Liturgical books, such as Breviaries and Missals, have until now been scarcely considered in Book history, although they may provide a wide range of insights, crossing cultural, political, religious and confessional history. Moreover, scrutinizing liturgical calendars and Propers of Saints makes possible to reassess such seemingly independent topics as the question of coexistence of norms and competences in celebrating feasts, the one of local identities interacting with the new frame of the Roman Breviary (since 1568) and Roman Missal (since 1570), and even the changes in vernacular literary culture of the Counter-Reformation. All those aspects and processes deserve better understanding in Central Europe. In Historiography, Central European bishops are commonly supposed to have soon accepted the new Roman liturgical order, though the point is by no means so simple. Furthermore, liturgical reorganization, breviaries and hagiographical books had many features in common, as already brilliantly demonstrated, for instance, by Simon Ditchfield for Italian Piacenza. On one side, ancient and recent Breviary lessons often appear as a matrix for vernacular hagiography and catholic devotional books in Czech, Hungarian, German or Polish during the Counter-Reformation era. On the other side, the new Officia propria sanctorum patronorum of the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary mixed Latin old and new texts, but were always presented as the true expression of timeless local historical and sacral tradition, in a time of re-conversion to Catholicism and complete disruption of religious habits. Though these books should have been approved by the Roman Congregation of Rites, some of them introduced “old-new” feasts and saints -especially in Bohemia. We shall try to reconstruct the local reasons of such liturgical innovations and to highlight their links to latin and vernacular literary culture, as well as to the reshaping of local identities."
