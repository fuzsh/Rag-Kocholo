        "text": "anat01\n\nSome people don't travel with their own IFE and would like one; no idea on how successful JQ's VOD units are, but I can see JQ as the LCC who's too poor to have any IFE.\n\nI'm sure they're successful for the 9 people who get the opportunity to rent one for the flight - shame about the other 168 who miss out. Apparently there's only a choice of 3 movies - BFD!\n\nI'd get more excitement from re-reading their inflight magazine cover to cover.\n\nReminds me a bit of a South Park episode when it's Cartman's Birthday - I guess the current VOD unit is like the Yellow Megaman & the iPad is like the Ultra Mega Megaman.\n\nCartman: Now as you can see Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Megaman, that's because the Yellow Megaman is the cheapest one and I know how poor your family is. Anyway Kenny Yellow Megaman is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments in a year, or two.\n\nOz\n\nhttp://www.jetstar.com/~/media/files/pdf/entertainment/videoondemand.ashx\n\nThis month one can choose from:\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are\n\nPG 101mins\n\nStarring James Gandolfini,\n\nMax Records, Forest Whitaker\n\nMax runs away from home and\n\ntravels to an imaginary world\n\ninhabited by strange creatures.\n\nBright Star\n\nPG 119mins\n\nStarring Abbie Cornish,\n\nBen Whishaw\n\nAn unlikely romance inspires a\n\npoet’s work, but can love conquer all\n\nobstacles in their way?\n\nKenny\n\nM 99mins\n\nStarring Shane Jacobson,\n\nEve von Bibra\n\nKenny Smyth is an unappreciated\n\nporta-loo delivery guy juggling life\n\nand sewage with charm and humour.\n\nWhip It !\n\nPG-13 110mins\n\nStarring Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore,\n\nMarcia Gay Harden\n\nA teenage girl escapes her small-town\n\nlife and finds adventure when she\n\njoins the Roller Derby.\n\nGentlemen Broncos\n\nPG-13 89mins\n\nStarring Michael Angarano,\n\nJemaine Clement, Jennifer Coolidge\n\nA teenage writer’s story is stolen by a\n\nprofessional author and turned into a\n\nsci-fi novel and movie.\n\nLaw Abiding Citizen\n\nR 108mins\n\nAvailable with Japanese subtitles\n\nStarring Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx\n\nA man decides to take justice into his\n\nown hands after his family’s killer is\n\nset free.\n\nLove Happens\n\nPG-13 109mins\n\nAvailable dubbed in Japanese\n\nStarring Jennifer Aniston,\n\nAaron Eckhart\n\nA self-help guru falls for a florist —\n\ncan they give love a second chance?\n\nAmelia\n\nPG 104mins\n\nAvailable in closed captions\n\nStarring Hilary Swank, Richard Gere\n\nAviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, set\n\nout to be the first person to fly solo\n\naround the world.\n\nApple dont have the best battery technology in their products , I cannot see my 12\" thinkpad that ran without a charge on a BNE-SYD-PER-BNE daytrip last week being replaced too soon, I got 12 hours of \"work\" from it and its only a 1.5CM thick.\n\nJust wait until you've had it for 12 or 18 months and you cant even get from BNE to SYD without having to plug it in.\n\nI've got the X61 and whilst a brilliant computer, the battery life after only 12 months was just abysmal, that was until I bought a new battery.\n\nI honestly dont see one product killing off IFE, unless as has been said its such a shoddy offering as JQ currently has.\n\nTG\n\nJust wait until you've had it for 12 or 18 months and you cant even get from BNE to SYD without having to plug it in.\n\nI've got the X61 and whilst a brilliant computer, the battery life after only 12 months was just abysmal, that was until I bought a new battery.\n\nI honestly dont see one product killing off IFE, unless as has been said its such a shoddy offering as JQ currently has.\n\nTG\n\nThats my point about Apple, design overides function in that you cannot change what is a consumable item, the battery, with your X61 you have the choice of three batteries, with apple you dont. All batteries will fail over time, with the IPAD having a RRP of around $600 I doubt spare batteries will be a readily available part.\n\nThats my point about Apple, design overides function in that you cannot change what is a consumable item, the battery, with your X61 you have the choice of three batteries, with apple you dont.

It’s part of the design, not a fault.\n\nThe design not to have a removable battery is functional in that it allows them to build a custom fit battery that they wouldn’t be able to had they needed to create a cavity where a replaceable battery would sit.\n\nEveryone whines about the MacBook’s batteries not being replaceable, but they’re much bigger than they were because of that.

Compare a Macbook Air with a Protege R600 and tell me its a design feature not to have a replaceable battery, absolute rubbish, its a feature purely to ensure the lifecycle of the device is shortened and the replacement cost of a new battery is better spent on a new device. I am also not suggesting the iPAD will replace notebooks, just has netpads have not replaced notebooks either.\n\nDid not say it was a fault, only that it impacts the TCO and contributes to a throw away mentality.

And as for user-changeable? there's a few screws, whole case comes off, and you bang in a new battery. Sure, it's not the same as switch n go, but with higher capacity and longer cycle life, you don't need to as often either.\n\nAnd if you don't use a laptop as a laptop, your battery will suffer. Classic example - my MacBook Pro (2008 so the changeable battery model). Got it in March 2008, and the battery is absolutely toasted. It's been used primarily as a desktop replacement, and has lived on a power cord for most its life. I can't get more than 90-100 minutes out of it (minimal screen and wifi on). My December 2007 Macbook, which has been used pretty much only as a laptop (and has a far higher cycle rate and health percentage) will still regularly get up to 2 hours in similar configuration.\n\nWhen it comes time to buy a new notebook, the 'user changeable' issue is a moot point. Everyone coughed about it on the iPhone, and people certainly have had no problems with that. And with most a/c getting a/c (pun intended) in flight these days, it's becoming less of an issue.\n\n*edit*\n\nJust as an example, http://www.ifixit.com/MacBook-Parts/MacBook-Air-Mid-2009-Battery/IF188-044 shows you how accessible batteries are on the Mac range. ifixit.com has tear downs of every apple device, along with the parts/tools required if you so desire to purchase, to DIY.\n\nDid not say it was a fault, only that it impacts the TCO and contributes to a throw away mentality.

I am also not suggesting the iPAD will replace notebooks, just has netpads have not replaced notebooks either.\n\nWhile the replacement battery has to be changed by Apple, it’s the same price as the older batteries that could be hot-swapped. $199. So it’s not like it would be cheaper to just throw the computer away and buy a new one!\n\nThe capacity of the non-user changeable batteries is significantly higher than the user changeable items of a competing PC product.\n\nThe Apple batteries in these devices have proven to be exceptional.

In the above case non user changable batteries appear to offer nothing other than a slick bottom!\n\nTo go back to the comparison I made with the R600 vs the air (given we are talking similar profiles/weight to the iPAD):\n\nAir: Capacity 5200mAh Avg Life 5 hrs Recharge Time 10 hours\n\nR600: Capacity 5800mAh Avg Life 6 hrs Recharge Time 4.5 hrs\n\nAs you can see, using the Tosh R600 PA3612U-1BRS battery which is the standard in Oz you get a higher capacity, longer use and quicker recharge.\n\nSo you get higher capacity, quicker recharge and the ability to take two batteries for those long flights where there is no AC when compared to the Air, yet you have a laptop lighter than the air with that battery in at 1.1kgs?

It runs windows\n\nThe Air can be charged faster, if you use a different non-air PSU, but your points are all entirely valid. The Air is probably a bad example for my argument though (although that is what you originally mentioned - my logic in this case, is far from sound)."
