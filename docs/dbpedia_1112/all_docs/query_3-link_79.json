        "text": "Today I'm holding up the Top 50 singles chart from 3 May 1987.\n\nAussies took to club music in a big way in 1987 and two tracks resonated particularly strongly: Paul Lekakis' 'Boom Boom (Let's Go Back To My Room)' and 'Male Stripper' by Man 2 Man Meet Man Parish. We're seeing both at their chart peaks: 'Boom Boom' topped the Australian chart for five weeks (it's in its third week at #1 here) and 'Male Stripper' spent one week at #3 and six weeks in the Top 10. Looking back, it's hard to pinpoint how the crossover from the clubs to the mainstream occurred, but I suspect it had building for some time. Pseudo Echo's cover of 'Funkytown' had been a huge hit in the clubs and spent seven weeks at #1 at the beginning of 1987 — and then Kim Wilde's 'You Keep Me Hangin' On' followed suit. Dance hits from Stacey Q, The Communards and New Order all made the Top 10 in the first four months of the year and Dead Or Alive's 'Something In My House' reached the Top 20. Dance music had been a feature of the Aussie charts for a good decade, but suddenly club tracks that didn't receive any radio play were reaching the Top 3 (and both 'Boom Boom' and 'Male Stripper' were crossovers from gay clubs, which is even more notable). Something was happening. Aussies really wanted to dance in 1987.\n\nBon Jovi achieve their first big hit in Australia with 'Livin' On A Prayer', rising from #10 to #4. It will peak at #3 next week. Bon Jovi had gotten off to a slow start in Australia with 'You Give Love A Bad Name' peaking at #32 but they will be one of the big chart acts of 1987: the Slippery When Wet album will spend six weeks at #1 in July/August and become the 3rd biggest selling album of the year. Along with dance music, Bon Jovi's emergence signalled another shift in popular taste: a string of hard rocking poodle-haired imitators will follow (although none will be quite as successful).\n\nChantoozies, Australia's version of Bananarama, drop from their #4 chart peak this week with their cover of 'Witch Queen'. Chantoozies were four actresses (Ally Fowler, Tottie Goldsmith, Eve von Bibra and Angelica 'Angie' Arnott) and backing musicians (including David Reyne, James' brother) who had formed to play cover songs at Tottie Goldsmith's 24th birthday party. They went on to play successful club gigs, which led to a recording contract with Mushroom Records. Chantoozies would enjoy another big hit in Australia with 'Wanna be Up', which reached #6 in 1988.\n\nHoodoo Gurus are at #8 with their first (and only) Top 10 single, 'What's My Scene'. The Gurus had reached the Top 20 in 1985 with 'Bittersweet' and 'Like Wow - Wipeout' but 1987 will mark the peak of their success with 'What's My Scene' reaching #3 (for two weeks) and their third album Blow Your Cool! reaching #2. As I mentioned a few weeks ago in another post, if the \"various artists\" compilations had been removed from the Australian albums chart in 1987 instead of 1989, Blow Your Cool! would have been a #1 album for Hoodoo Gurus (it was prevented from reaching the top by '87 Hits Out).\n\nU2's new single 'With Or Without You' is at #16 this week and it will peak at #9 in two weeks. On paper, U2's chart success in Australia during 1987 was underwhelming — or, at least, the chart positions achieved here weren't comparable to those in the US or the UK. 'With Or Without You' only just grazed the Top 10, 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' (#17) and 'Where The Streets Have No Name' (#27) were only minor hits, and The Joshua Tree will peak at #3, unable to dislodge Whispering Jack and Graceland. But chart positions can be deceptive: the album (boosted by the singles) had legs, spending 22 consecutive weeks in the Top 10. It will be the 5th biggest album of 1987 and be certified 5 x platinum in 1996.\n\nA big future #1 is rising up the chart at #21: 'Slice of Heaven' by Dave Dobbyn with Herbs. 'Slice of Heaven' was the theme from the Footrot Flats film, which was a massive hit (the highest-ever grossing animated film in Australia until The Lion King). The single will climb to #14 next week and then make a big jump to #2 before deposing Paul Lekakis and spending four weeks at #1. 'Slice of Heaven' will be the 4th biggest single of 1987 in Australia.\n\nMadonna debuts at #32 with 'La Isla Bonita', the fifth single from her #1 album True Blue. It's a bit of a comeback for Madonna because her previous single 'Open Your Heart' (a US #1) had been her first single to miss the Australian Top 10 since 'Borderline' peaked at #12 in August 1984 — ending a run of nine consecutive Top 10 hits. But 'La Isla Bonita' will put Madonna back on track, peaking at #6. I'll have to profile Madonna as an \"80s Star of the Day' (like I did with Pat Benatar a while back) because her success in Australia has been extraordinary (it has been everywhere, of course!). Since April 1984 (when 'Holiday' reached #4) Madonna has achieved 41 Top 10 singles in Australia, including 11 number ones.\n\nThere are lots of other songs I could rabbit on about but I want to leave some for the rest of you! Please chime in with your favourites.\n\nThere are a number of great songs on this chart, most by the usual suspects, Hoodoo Gurus, Pretenders, Models, David Bowie, The Angels and Kim Wilde, who's version of You Keep Me Hangin' On was the only highlight on her weakest album.\n\nDon't Give Up by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush is a brilliant song, great to see it in the top 10, and I liked Cameo's Word Up back then as well, I think it may have also been a top 10 hit earlier in the year.\n\nIt was a little disappointing that Crowded House's World Where You Live didn't climb higher up the charts, it was my favourite track from their brilliant debut.\n\nHmmm, so it's easy to see where I started to drift away from the chart stuff. Part of it was that I was in college, so I wasn't watching music shows and purely relying on radio or my own collection. I wasn't out at clubs so much as going to University bar nights.\n\nThe first song I really like in the chart is the Gurus \"What's My Scene?\" It's such a well constructed pop song and has a really great groove. Pretty timeless.\n\nElsewhere, the superb \"Don't Give Up\" which is a unique song of the time, \"She's the One\" by The Cockroaches which is great little pop number, \"Real Wild Child\" by Iggy which I adore, \"C'est La Vie\" by Robbie Nevil, \"We Gotta Get Out of the Place\" by The Angels with Doc Neeson and he's desperate vocal performance, \"Slice of Heaven\" by Dave Dobbyn and The Herbs from the Footrot Flats movie, although I think Dave Dobbyn has better songs like \"Whaling\".\n\nBizarre Love Triangle, Walk Like an Egyptian, You Gotta Fight for your right to Party by the Beastie Boys! World Where you Live by Crowded House in the lower reaches of the chart, should have been a bigger hit but then I'm biased! Day In, Day Out by David Bowie - probably an unfairly maligned Bowie song, but it's very typical OTT 80s.\n\nAnd then I see in the breakers section Billy Vera and the Breakers. I have that EP. Love it. I think it was popular off the back of the song \"At this Moment\" being used in the TV show \"Family Ties\".\n\nSo what you can see is that I'm all over the map on my musical interest here. The biggest disappointment was how little attention was paid to the debut Crowded House album. It's fantastic and I have a real soft spot for it. I think I had it on 3 formats and it got played to death in my uni housing that year. Absolutely adore the album - hard to believe now that this album had a series of singles fail...\n\nYes, I was the same. I looked at this chart and my first thought was, \"this is when I started my shift away from pop\". It's not that I think it's an awful chart because I like a lot of these singles — but there are just as many that I don't care for. I still picked up the Top 50 chart from my local record store every week but I didn't buy many of these singles or albums.\n\nRe: Bowie's 'Day-In, Day-Out'. I was a massive Bowie fan in '87 and remember being very disappointed that the new single (and then the album) received such a lukewarm response. I actually think 'Day-In, Day-Out' is pretty good — I mean, it's no 'Let's Dance' or even 'Blue Jean, but I was a bit shocked it only reached #33 here. I went to see Bowie's Glass Spider Tour at Kooyong in November '87 and I was beside myself with excitement. Actually, I became slightly hysterical when we got off the train at Kooyong and my friend threatened to slap me. That whole era in Bowie's career is almost universally panned but I've still got a soft spot for it.\n\nI went to the first of the four Melbourne concerts:\n\nMelbourne Setlist - 18 Nov, 1987\n\n1. Purple Haze (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)\n\n2. Up the Hill Backwards\n\n3. Glass Spider\n\n4. Up the Hill Backwards (Reprise)\n\n5. Day-In Day-Out\n\n6. Bang Bang\n\n7. Absolute Beginners\n\n8. Loving the Alien\n\n9. China Girl\n\n10. Rebel Rebel\n\n11. Fashion\n\n12. Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\n\n13. All the Madmen\n\n14. Never Let Me Down\n\n15. Big Brother\n\n16. Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family\n\n17. '87 and Cry\n\n18. \"Heroes\"\n\n19. Sons of the Silent Age\n\n20. Time Will Crawl\n\n21. Young Americans\n\n22. The Jean Genie\n\n23. Let's Dance\n\n24. Fame\n\nEncore:\n\n25. Time\n\n26. Blue Jean\n\n27. Modern Love\n\nI started college in 1988, and like you and a couple of others I see this chart and feel like pop music has passing me by, there is still a number of great songs, but a lot of the songs I have no interest in. I think it’s about 6-9 months later that I turn off the local commercial radio stations forever and it wasn’t until Triple J arrived in 1990 that I started finding new genres and new artists that began to excite me again."
