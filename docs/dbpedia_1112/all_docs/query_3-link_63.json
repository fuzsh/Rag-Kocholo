Plus, Gavin and Robbie appraise all the album tracks on Total Euphoria. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 2: Big Pig and I'm Talking with Sherine and Zan Abeyratne\n\n​\n\nTwin sisters Sherine and Zan Abeyratne made a huge impression on the Australian pop scene in the 1980s. Individually, they were members of two of the most innovative, era-defining bands to emerge locally that decade: Big Pig and I'm Talking. In this episode, the siblings look back on their time in those groups, whose sound pushed Australian music out of its pub rock comfort zone, and talk about singles like \"Hungry Town\", \"Breakaway\" and \"Holy Word\". They also discuss their work — both separately and together — as in-demand backing singers, with credits on hits by INXS, Kids In The Kitchen and Models. We also hear what it was like to be part of the local industry at a time when women were making their presence felt and breaking down barriers in what was once a boys' club. In our extensive interview, Sherine and Zan also reflect on the less commercially successful moments in their careers and reveal what they are up to now.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Check out the full interview with Sherine and Zan, which includes the sisters talking about working with U2, their musical upbringing, the I'm Talking reunion and more. Also, Gavin and Robbie look back at some other female singers in Australia who were both backing singers and solo performers. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 3: Frente! with Angie Hart and Pop! with Amy Flower\n\n​\n\nIn the early '90s, indie pop band Frente! enjoyed a meteoric rise in Australia, going from the Triple J Hottest 100 to regulars in the top 5 of the ARIA chart in just a couple of releases. In this episode, we hear from singer Angie Hart about the band's early success and the backlash they suffered following the release of \"Accidently Kelly Street\", which was brutally parodied by The Late Show. This episode also covers a different — but linked — music industry story. In 1995, Angie provided vocals for a track called \"Tingly\" by Pop! But despite rave reviews and support from a variety of FM radio networks, it wasn't the hit it should've been. Now, as Angie has reunited with Pop! for new single \"Waiting\", she and Amy Flower explain what happened with \"Tingly\". We'll also hear about Frente's acoustic cover of New Order's \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" and less commercially successful second album, Shape, and eventual split.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear about Angie Hart's time on Buffy The Vampire Slayer and find out what's next for her and Pop!'s Amy Flower in our extended interview. Plus, Gavin and Robbie discuss all those Fast Forward and The Late Show musical parodies. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 4: Paul Mac on solo success, Itch-E & Scratch-E and The Dissociatives\n\n​\n\nFrom his pioneering work on Australia's dance music scene in the 1990s to becoming a pop star in the 2000s, Paul Mac has had a long and impressive career. In a candid and insightful — not to mention F bomb-laden — interview, the recording artist, songwriter, producer and remixer discusses some of his standout musical moments. Paul reflects on releasing the ARIA Award-winning club track \"Sweetness And Light\" as part of Itch-E & Scratch-E and what it was like as a dance artist in Australia in the '90s. His three solo pop albums, 3000 Feet High, Panic Room and Holiday From Me, also come under the spotlight, and Paul talks about his choice of vocalists like Abby Dobson, Tex Perkins and Peta Morris; the personal stories behind hits like \"Just The Thing\" and \"Sunshine Eyes\"; what it was like to go from the underground to the pages of Smash Hits and more. We also hear about his ongoing musical relationship with Daniel Johns and their collaborative album as The Dissociatives.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview with Paul Mac, he talks more about his career, including how close he and Daniel Johns have come to releasing more music, the pivotal role Volition's Robert Racic played and what he's been working on recently, Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 5: Pseudo Echo with Brian Canham\n\n​\n\nThey were at the forefront of Australia's synthpop scene and Pseudo Echo were rewarded for toughing it out on the rock-dominated live music circuit with a string of hits, including debut single \"Listening\", which the band played an early version of as an unsigned act on Countdown. Lead singer and principal songwriter Brian Canham tells us about that breakthrough appearance and the success that followed with albums Autumnal Park in 1984 and the next year's Love An Adventure, which yielded three top 15 singles. He also discusses the band's chart-topping remake of \"Funky Town\" and the dramas that unfolded in the aftermath, which led to an unexpected direction change with 1988's Race. If the move in a rockier direction puzzled you at the time, you weren't alone — hosts Gavin and Robbie recall their reaction to the new-look and new-sound Pseudo Echo, and Brian reveals the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to the shift and, ultimately, the band breaking up.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Brian talks more about the recording process for Autumnal Park, Pseudo Echo's first chart misses, songwriting within the band, his production work during the '90s and 2000s, and more in the full interview. Plus, Gavin and Robbie take a listen to some of the releases Brian produced after Pseudo Echo's initial split. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 6: Girlfriend Part 1: Make It Come True\n\n​\n\nExactly 30 years ago, Melanie Alexander, Jacqui Cowell, Siobhann Heidenreich, Robyn Loau and Lorinda Noble burst onto the pop scene with their debut single, \"Take It From Me\". The all-singing, all-dancing girl group were like nothing Australia had seen — and they were ahead of their time internationally with their girl power message (the words were literally in the lyrics of their second single, \"Girls Life\") and diverse line-up. In the first episode of a two-part special, Melanie, Jacqui, Siobhann and Robyn join us to discuss the story of their formation, reaching number 1 with that first release, the all-important Girlfriend brand (the flower hats!) and loads of memories from their songs and music videos. It wasn't all smooth sailing, with some decisions made on behalf of the band not sitting well with everybody, but theirs is a story of pop star dreams that came true incredibly quickly thanks to a combination of hard work, catchy tunes and a savvy understanding of what the pop marketplace was missing.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear the full interviews with Robyn and Mel, Jacqui & Siobhann, in which they share more memories of Girlfriend, including how they dealt with fame, why the new direction with \"Sooner Or Later\" wasn't enough to convince Robyn to stay, GF4's recording sessions and other experiences in the US, and Robyn's time working with Siva Pacifica. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 7: Girlfriend Part 2: It's Up To You, GF4 and Malaria\n\n​\n\nWe continue the story of Australian girl group Girlfriend, with Melanie Alexander, Jacqui Cowell, Siobhann Heidenreich and Robyn Loau telling us about the promotional trips they made overseas, especially to the UK and Japan, in an attempt to break internationally. Back in Australia, the group moved on to second album It's Up To You, although \"Heartbeat\" and \"Wishing On The Same Star\" didn't achieve the chart highs of the singles from their debut album. But the girls had other issues to worry about, including a lack of money flowing through to them despite solid record sales and regular concert tours. We hear about the tumultuous period that followed, with a change in management and the decision by Robyn to leave the group. Out of that upheaval came two great singles: \"Sooner Or Later\" by the rebranded GF4 and Robyn's solo release, \"Sick With Love\", both of which reached the top 20 and proved moving in new musical directions was the way to go. But the wheels fell off both GF4 and Robyn's solo career — and the ladies explain what happened in both cases. Despite the ups and downs of Girlfriend's career, theirs is a story of paving new paths in pop and holding their own in a male-dominated industry.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear the full interviews with Robyn and Mel, Jacqui & Siobhann, in which they share more memories of Girlfriend, including how they dealt with fame, why the new direction with \"Sooner Or Later\" wasn't enough to convince Robyn to stay, GF4's recording sessions and other experiences in the US, and Robyn's time working with Siva Pacifica. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 8: Indecent Obsession with David Dixon\n\n​\n\nIn 1989, four young, energetic performers crashed onto the Australian chart with their debut single, \"Say Goodbye\" — an instantly catchy piece of synthpop that took them into the top 10. One of the first signings to Molly Meldrum's Melodian Records, Indecent Obsession had the good looks that saw them regularly in the pages of Smash Hits and the killer hooks that made for some great pop tunes. But even though their second single, \"Tell Me Something\", was another hit in Australia and broke internationally, the band struggled to be accepted by the rock-obsessed local music industry and to gain radio support. The band's original lead singer David Dixon talks about Indecent Obsession's initial success in all corners of the globe, the disastrous front cover of debut album Spoken Words, the disappointing performance of big ballad \"Come Back To Me\" and the process of recording second album Indio. He also reveals why he left the band in 1993 and explains what became of his short-lived solo career.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview with David Dixon, he talks about what Indecent Obsession looked like before they were styled, touring with Debbie Gibson and Kylie Minogue, his stint on Home And Away, his career change after leaving the entertainment industry and more. Plus, we bring you an exclusive sneak peek at four of the tracks from David's planned solo album. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 9: Radio Freedom with Paul Snashall\n\n​\n\nIn the early '90s, there was no hotter Australian pop music label than Westside Records, who pounced on Radio Freedom, a project fronted by Paul Snashall. Fresh off an appearance on talent show Star Search, the singer otherwise known as Pehl put together a track called \"I Can Feel It\", an infectious mix of dance, Latin and hip-hop that stormed the ARIA top 10. In our interview with Paul, he reveals all the behind-the-scenes details of what inspired that tune, how the song and his profile exploded (sometimes with disastrous consequences), and his lucrative deal with Westside. Paul talks us through the follow-ups to \"I Can Feel It\", including soul track \"Proove\", Bob Marley cover \"Is This Love\" and the band's final single \"Edge Of The World (Love Storm)\", detailing the reasons behind Radio Freedom's evolving sound and the record company politics at play. Label issues would also have a huge impact on what could've been the band's big international break, with their support slot for Elton John cut short — a turn of events that, together with constant delays on their debut album, hastened Paul's disillusion with Radio Freedom.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie dive into the rest of the Westside Records catalogue and discuss tracks by Melissa, Teen Queens, Bruce Samazan, Boys In Black and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 10: 1927 with Erik Weideman\n\n​\n\nTheir album ...ish remains one of the all-time best-selling debuts in Australian music history, but no record company wanted to sign 1927. Lead singer Erik Weideman talks about putting that multi-platinum album together after he was spotted on Hey Hey It's Saturday talent quest Red Faces by former Moving Pictures member Garry Frost and how it was producer Charles Fisher who took a chance on the pop/rock quartet. While the music industry might have been unsure about 1927, the Australian public weren't, with hit after hit being lifted from ...ish. Erik talks about songs like \"That's When I Think Of You\", \"If I Could\" and \"Compulsory Hero\", and shares his disbelief when Garry decided to quit the band while they were working on their follow-up album. Although not as commercially successful, second album The Other Side was another enjoyable experience for Erik, notwithstanding the line-up change, but the singer explains why 1927's self-titled third album did not go so well and what led to the ultimate demise of the band in the mid-'90s.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear the full interview with Erik Weideman, in which he talks about 1927's more recent recordings, gives more details about \"That's When I Think Of You\" and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 11: Koo De Tah with Tina Cross and John Bettison\n\n​\n\nFollowing solo success at home in New Zealand, Tina Cross relocated to Australia in the early '80s, eventually teaming up with singer/songwriter Leon Berger, who was born in Russia but had also made the move down under. Together, they formed the foundation of synthpop band Koo De Tah, whose debut single, \"Too Young For Promises\", was a top 10 smash in 1985. Tina and her former band-mate John Bettison, who played guitar for Koo De Tah, reveal how some missing demos almost scuppered the band's record deal chances and how they thought \"Too Young For Promises\" wasn't going to be very successful at first. They also recall the timing problems and record contract delays that led to subsequent singles \"Body Talk, \"Think Of Me\" and \"Missed You All Along\" falling short of their initial success. The pair discuss Koo De Tah's self-titled album and the exorbitant amounts of money the rare item has traded hands for in the decades since. And they share some personal news that has been decades in the making.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie look at some more short-lived Australian synthpop, new wave and funk bands from the '80s that didn't have quite the same success as Koo De Tah. Think: Dear Enemy, QED, Go 101 and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 12: Toni Pearen\n\n​\n\nShe might have taken the well-worn path from soap opera to pop music, but former E Street actress Toni Pearen actually turned down the first record deal that was offered to her. The singer, actress, presenter and reality TV favourite talks about why she waited to sign with Mushroom Records and the process of putting together her back-to-back top 10 hits, \"In Your Room\" and \"I Want You\". Toni also explains why there was such a delay in releasing further music and describes how her album, Intimate, came together. Fan favourites \"Walkaway Lover\" and \"Joy\" also come under the spotlight, with Toni going on to describe the shift in attitude at Mushroom and the start she made on a follow-up album. When her time at Mushroom came to an end, Toni spent five years in the US pursuing other musical opportunities — and she reveals what happened during that time and reflects on the impact her period of pop stardom had on fans and herself.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, Toni goes into more detail about her music videos and songwriting, the group she was in before she got her record deal, navigating being a young woman in the Australian music industry and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 13: Real Life with David Sterry\n\n​\n\nIn 1983, Australian synthpop exploded with a surge of new bands hitting the ARIA chart, Front and centre was Melbourne's Real Life, which had been plugging away since forming in late 1980 through a couple of newspaper ads. Electronic anthem \"Send Me An Angel\" was a massive success locally and took off overseas, becoming a hit in North America and Europe. Singer David Sterry talks about the band's great start on Wheatley Records in Australia and Curb Records internationally, as well as the mixed fortunes of follow-up singles \"Openhearted\" and \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" from debut album Heartland. The band went through a difficult — and expensive — second album Flame, which led to a tumultuous second half of the '80s with line-up changes, stand-alone singles not being released in Australia and a return to favour with a remix of \"Send Me An Angel\" in 1989, which did even better in the US than the original. Third album Lifetime followed in 1990 and David discusses that and Real Life's sporadic release and touring schedule since then, including a recent return to the stage after a four-year break.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Listen to the full interview with David Sterry in which he discusses appearing on Countdown, how the band got its name, latest album Sirens and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 14: Madison Avenue with Andy Van\n\n​\n\nWith every one of their four singles reaching the ARIA top 10, dance duo Madison Avenue had a perfect chart strike rate. Formed by DJ/producer Andy Van and singer Cheyne Coates, the pair crossed over from the clubs to the top 50 in 1999 with \"Don't Call Me Baby\" — a song Cheyne was never meant to sing. Andy tells us about how that track came together — from the sample he based the song around, the Mousse T tune that served as inspiration and how Cheyne's hastily recorded guide vocal ended up being on the finished record. We'll also hear about the bidding war to release the song overseas, how follow-up singles \"Who The Hell Are You\" and \"Everything You Need\" came about, and the pressure to put together debut album The Polyester Embassy. Andy also talks about his and Cheyne's sometimes contentious working relationship, which ultimately led to their split in 2003; his thoughts about Madison Avenue's remake of \"Reminiscing\"; and other highlights from his career, including his ARIA Award-winning remix of Pendulum's \"Coma\", starting Vicious Vinyl with John Course, and working with wife Cassie in groups Vandalism and Super Disco Club.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview with Andy Van, he talks about the Neighbours cast member he produced a hip-hop record for, the dance music explosion in the late '90s, signing Avicii and more about his time in Madison Avenue. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 15: Sister2Sister with Christine and Sharon Muscat\n\n​\n\nAs the '90s became the 2000s, two bubbly teenagers came seemingly out of nowhere to score back-to-back top 5 singles, \"Sister\" and \"What's A Girl To Do\", but Christine and Sharon Muscat had been preparing for that moment for years. First, growing up with their musician father, Joe, helping them to develop their talents and then, being spotted by Tina Arena on TV and signed by her then-husband/manager, Ralph Carr. Sister2Sister were quickly launched overseas, with UK chart success and key support slots on tours by Five and Britney Spears. But the pop stardom ended just as suddenly and a planned (and recorded) second album was never released. The sisters talk about the decisions they made following the release of their debut album, One, that changed the course of their joint career. Over the past two decades, the siblings have worked in a more behind-the-scenes capacity as session singers, backing vocalists and vocal coaches, but they are set to release their first music as Sister2Sister in two decades and explain why they feel lucky to have had the experience in the music industry that they've had.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, as well as more detail from Christine and Sharon about their songwriting sessions and the work that was done on pulling their debut album together, the sisters discuss an early record deal that they turned down and their mother recalls exactly what happened at Britney Spears' Halloween party. Listen here.\n\nBONUS: Tania Lacy on Countdown, The Factory and Countdown Revolution\n\n​\n\nIn this special podcast crossover event, the teams behind A Journey Through Aussie Pop and A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman unite to discuss the legacy of Tania Lacy, who went from dancer on Countdown and choreographer of Kylie Minogue's \"Locomotion\" music video to maverick presenter on spin-off series The Factory and Countdown Revolution. Tania talks about being co-host of those music programs and entertaining a generation of music fans with her comic characters and outrageous interview segments. Behind the laughs, there were some not-as-amusing moments, as Tania reveals the lack of support she received from producers and the consequences of the infamous strike episode of Countdown Revolution. She also talks about her current projects, including her stand-up performances around Australia.\n\nEPISODE 16: Sweet And Sour Part 1: Johanna Pigott, Tracy Mann, David Reyne & Ric Herbert\n\n​\n\nAt 6pm on July 2, 1984, a new ABC series debuted and would go on to become one of the most popular shows aired on the national broadcaster all decade. Created by Johanna Pigott and Tim Gooding, both former members of punk band XL Capris, Sweet And Sour depicted the rise and fall of fictional group The Takeaways. In this first episode in a two-part special, Johanna shares her memories of being in XL Capris and how that experience formed the basis for Sweet And Sour. She reveals the false start the series had and discusses the process of creating the show a generation of Australians watched again and again in the mid-'80s. We also talk to three of the cast members: Tracy Mann, who played singer Carol Howard; David Reyne, who brought his existing music industry knowledge to the role of guitarist Martin Kabel; and Ric Herbert, the man behind human whirlwind Darrell Winters, The Takeaways' manager.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear extended interviews with Tracy Mann, David Reyne, Ric Herbert, Johanna Pigott, Sharon O'Neill, Graham \"Buzz\" Bidstrup and Jan Chapman. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 17: Sweet And Sour Part 2: Sharon O'Neill, Deborah Conway, \"Buzz\" Bidstrup & Jan Chapman\n\n​\n\nAs important as the fictional story of The Takeaways was to the success of Sweet And Sour, an equally crucial factor was the show's soundtrack. Johanna Pigott and Graham \"Buzz\" Bidstrup (formerly of The Angels and The Party Boys) talk us through the process of reaching out to the cream of Australia's songwriters for material to include in the show. Both Johanna and Buzz also contributed songs themselves, and the latter tells us about joining forces with three other writers who he'd go on to form GANGgajang with. We also hear from Sharon O'Neill about how the ups and downs of her career up until that point influenced the lyrics of title track \"Sweet And Sour\", while Deborah Conway recounts how she was recruited to provide the singing voice of The Takeaways' lead singer, Carol, and why she requested that her involvement stay as anonymous as possible. Finally, series producer (and future producer of The Piano, Lantana and many more movies) Jan Chapman reflects on her role bringing the series to air and why she considers it a career highlight.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear extended interviews with Tracy Mann, David Reyne, Ric Herbert, Johanna Pigott, Sharon O'Neill, Graham \"Buzz\" Bidstrup and Jan Chapman. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 18: Jo Beth Taylor\n\n​\n\nShe was one of Australia's most recognisable and popular personalities in the 1990s — and it all began with singing for Jo Beth Taylor. After starting out in her hometown of Perth on a local TV show, she was snapped up by Molly Meldrum for his label, Melodian Records, shortly after she relocated to Melbourne. Jo Beth tells us about getting eased into the music industry as a backing singer for Indecent Obsession, building a lifelong friendship with Debbie Gibson while on tour, and going to New York to work with Debbie and a who's who of music producers for her debut album, 99 Reasons. Jo Beth reveals the record company debates about what style of music she should record and discusses her first two singles, \"99 Reasons\" and \"You Don't Own Me\". Jo Beth's music then took a backseat to a blossoming TV presenting career, with only two further singles released, \"A Prayer For Jane\" and \"I Love My Dog'. By 1997, her all-consuming work for Channel 9 took its toll and Jo Beth stepped away from the spotlight to attend to her mental health — a subject she reflects on when looking back at the ups and downs of her career in entertainment.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie work their way through Jo Beth Taylor's album, 99 Reasons, in a track by track commentary. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 19: Darren Hayes Part 1: Savage Garden, Affirmation & Spin\n\n​\n\nSince 1996, Darren Hayes has released some of Australia's most loved pop music, both as half of Savage Garden and as a solo artist. In the first episode of a two-part special, we look at Darren's time alongside Daniel Jones in Savage Garden and hear from the singer about the two albums they released together (Savage Garden and Affirmation), how the duo exploded both locally and internationally with hits like \"I Want You\", \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and \"I Knew I Loved You\", and the development of their professional and personal relationship. Following Savage Garden's complicated split, Darren emerged as a solo artist and released Spin as his debut album in 2002. Containing singles \"Insatiable\", \"Strange Relationship\", \"I Miss You\" and \"Crush (1980 Me)\", its polished sheen and bouyant energy masked Darren's personal struggles — issues that would shape the rest of his solo career. Disarmingly candid and thoughtful in his answers, Darren gives great insight into his record-breaking music career.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, Darren talks about his pre-fame job in a record store, the important lesson he learnt early in his career and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 20: Darren Hayes Part 2: The Tension And The Spark to Homosexual\n\n​\n\nAs Darren Hayes prepares to release his fifth studio album, Homosexual, he talks about how he moved away from being signed to a major label to emerge as an independent artist firmly in control of his career. That began with 2004's The Tension And The Spark, a synth-based album on which he grappled with his sexuality. While success continued in Australia and the UK, his relationship with Sony Music in the US reached breaking point. He followed that with experimental double album This Delicate Thing We've Made, a sprawling, 25-track release that allowed him to flex his creative muscles. In 2011, Darren worked with major labels once again — but on his terms. Secret Codes And Battleships was a return to a more accessible sound, but it resulted in Darren leaving the music industry for what would end up being a decade once promotion for the album was complete. He explains what inspired him to record once more and what he is saying on Homosexual that he has never expressed in his music before.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, Darren talks about side project We Are Smug, how Leona Lewis almost ended up recording \"Black Out The Sun\", his mid-'90s George Michael revelation and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 21: Wendy Matthews\n\n​\n\nShe's called Australia home for four decades and become one of this country's most beloved singer/songwriters, with three wins for Best Female Artist at the ARIA Awards in the '90s. Originally from Canada, Wendy Matthews cut her teeth as a session singer and backing vocalist before stepping into the spotlight with a series of increasingly high profile projects, culminating in Absent Friends' top 5 remake of \"I Don't Want To Be With Nobody But You\". Wendy tells us about those early experiences and how she then embarked on a solo career that yielded a string of hits from her first two albums, like \"Token Angels\", \"Let's Kiss (Like Angels Do)\" and her platinum-selling, ARIA-winning version of \"The Day You Went Away\". As she shares the stories behind the songs, Wendy reveals her hesitance in being a solo artist and the degree of control she was able to exert over her career. We also hear about gospel-influenced album The Witness Tree, what happened when her record label, RooArt, was sold to a major international record company, BMG, and why she eventually decided to go back to her independent roots.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: There's more from Wendy Matthews in the full interview, with stories about the video for \"The Day You Went Away\", her early collaboration with a Japanese star, recording the same song as the Eagles, the musical revival that never happened and more, Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 22: Peewee Ferris on Collette, Culture Shock, DJ Beats, Human Nature and more​\n\nDJ, remixer, songwriter, producer... Peewee Ferris has done it all. Australia's original superstar DJ shares his story of how his love for music led him into a career behind the decks and in the studio — and how being one step ahead when it came to dance music meant he was the go-to guy to bring new sounds and trends to the mainstream. From remixing acts like Jenny Morris, Boom Crash Opera and Kate Ceberano for major labels to being hired to launch Australia's answer to Yazz, Collette, Peewee's skills developed with each new project. In the '90s, he worked with two local dance acts, Bass Culture and Culture Shock, with mixed success before creating DJ Beats: Beyond The Turntable, the project that spawned top 20 single \"I Feel It\" alongside DJ Darren Briais. His profile continued to rise with prominent remixes for big-name pop acts like Savage Garden, Tina Arena and Human Nature. Peewee discusses those and his recent return to releasing pop/dance music with Toni Pearen.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie each share three of their favourite Australian remixes, from artists like Rockmelons, Delta Goodrem and INXS. Plus, you can hear the full interview with Peewee Ferris. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 23: Peter Andre​\n\nBorn in the UK, raised on the Gold Coast and discovered on Australian TV performing Bobby Brown songs, teenager Peter Andre was snapped up by Molly Meldrum for his record label, Melodian. After a couple of years' development, which included a songwriting trip to the UK to work with Phil Harding and Ian Curnow at PWL, the diehard Michael Jackson fan released his first single in 1992. But it was his second release, a cover of \"Gimme Little Sign\" that turned Peter into a star — and he recalls both his reluctance to record the track and his insistence that he show off his buff body in the music video. Further ARIA chart success continued as did support slots on high-profile Australian tours by Bobby Brown and Madonna, but with it came a backlash from certain quarters. Peter reveals the impact the negativity had on him and why he relocated to the UK to work on his second album. With tracks like \"Mysterious Girl\" and \"Flava\", Natural would be the album that would see his career take off in his homeland and allow him to achieve a long-held ambition to sell out Wembley Arena. In our candid interview, Peter also discusses why he left the industry after his US R&B-influenced third album, Time, and the comeback he never expected to have in the 2000s.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear the full interview with Peter Andre, in which he goes into more detail about his three decades in the entertainment industry. Listen here.\n\nSEASON TWO\n\nEPISODE 24: The Chantoozies Part 1​\n\nWhat had started out as a bunch of girlfriends catching up for drinks and a bit of a sing-along turned into one of Australia's biggest pop groups of the late '80s and early '90s. In the first episode of a two-part special, singers Ally Fowler, Tottie Goldsmith, Angie Arnott (née La Bozzetta) and Eve von Bibra, as well as musicians Brett Goldsmith, Scott Griffiths and David Reyne talk about how The Chantoozies came into being and went from playing gigs in one of the clubs run by the Goldsmiths' father to hitting the ARIA top 10 with their cover of \"Witch Queen\" and original track \"Wanna Be Up\". We'll also hear about the head-to-head battle with The Party Boys thanks to rival versions of \"He's Gonna Step On You Again\" and how the band's rigorous touring schedule earned them cred on the local music scene.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: The full interviews with Eve & Ally, Angie, Tottie, David, Brett and Scott include the story of the girls' near-death experience on the road, why Angie and Tottie decided to leave the reunited band, extra details on the record process and reflections on what being in The Chantoozies meant to them. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 25: The Chantoozies Part 2​\n\nThe Chantoozies had enjoyed an amazing run from their inception to the release of their debut album, but behind the hit singles and high rotation music videos, tensions were simmering. A split down gender lines developed — a situation that was exacerbated by a relentless touring schedule and some members not feeling they had enough say. The band members talk candidly about their disagreements and artistic differences, as well as the romances that existed between Eve and Brett, and Angie and David. Tottie and Scott also explain their reasons for leaving the band ahead of 1989 single \"Come Back To Me\", while David reveals what motivated him to quit after that track's release. Then, we hear about the decision to sack Brett and Frank, and reconfigure as a three-piece girl group. After all the upheaval, the new-look band scored a welcome hit in 1991 with a remake of \"Love The One You're With\", but split within a year. Reunions followed in the decades since, and these days, Ally and Eve keep the Chantoozies name alive as a duo.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: The full interviews with Eve & Ally, Angie, Tottie, David, Brett and Scott include the story of the girls' near-death experience on the road, why Angie and Tottie decided to leave the reunited band, extra details on the recording process and reflections on what being in The Chantoozies meant to them. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 26: Rogue Traders with Natalie Bassingthwaighte and James Ash​\n\nThey ruled radio and the charts in the mid-2000s, but when Rogue Traders started out, they were a very different proposition than the dance/rock hybrid that scored a string of hit singles a few years later. DJ/producer James Ash recalls the band's evolution from releasing disco-inspired club tracks to edgy, sample-laden anthems like \"One Of My Kind\" and \"Voodoo Child\". Recruited to front the band for top 5 smash \"Voodoo Child\", singer and actress Natalie Bassingthwaighte discusses the audition process to gain the gig and her reluctance to trade on her Neighbours fame to promote the single. With a four-piece line-up settled, the band went from strength to strength, with songs like \"Way To Go\", \"Watching You, \"Don't You Wanna Feel\" and \"I Never Liked You\" ensuring they were never far from the top 10. James and Natalie share their memories of those heady days and the choice to move away from samples on 2007's Better In The Dark. Nat also talks about her decision to go solo in 2008, while James fills us in on the less commercially successful period for the band with new singer Mindi Jackson, Then, we hear how the classic line-up of Rogue Traders came to reform and are now back touring and releasing new music.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie take a look at Natalie Bassingthwaighte's solo career, including her duet with Shannon Noll on \"Don't Give Up\", the singles from 1000 Stars and her final track, All We Have. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 27: Bachelor Girl with Tania Doko and James Roche​\n\nAfter crossing paths in 1992, singer Tania Doko and musician James Roche realised they shared a creative spark that would quickly evolve into pop/rock duo Bachelor Girl. The pair tell us about the road to getting signed with Ross Fraser and John Farnham's label, Gotham Records, and how their top 5 debut single, \"Buses And Trains\" was part of that journey. Tania and James reflect on the success of that song and how it led to being signed by US industry heavyweight Clive Davis and a revised version of debut album Waiting For The Day. While overseas success wasn't to be, Bachelor Girl followed their first local hit with others like \"Permission To Shine\", \"I'm Just A Girl\" and \"Treat Me Good\". We hear about the inspiration behind their songs, the pressures involved in their second album, Dysfunctional, and how record company politics led to their joint career being put on hold. Tania also reveals details of her solo record deal, which was also cut short in the mid-2ooos, and her stint as a mentor on Popstars Live. Then, the story of how they reunited for singles \"Speak\" and \"Calling Out Your Name\" in recent years is also told.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie chat about some of the songs Tania Doko has co-written for The Veronicas, Steps, Sheppard, Samantha Jade and Tina Arena. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 28: Icehouse with Iva Davies​\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, Icehouse racked up 13 top 20 hits across six studio albums and cracked both the US and the UK top 20 at different points, Initially known as Flowers, the band fronted by Iva Davies were at the forefront of new wave music in Australia, with their sound ranging from atmospheric synth ballads to rocky party tunes — and everything in between. In this career-spanning interview, Iva talks about the band's \"dangerous\" early sound that stood apart from their contemporaries on the pub rock scene and why writing hits came naturally to him. We hear the story behind chart-conquering classics like \"Great Southern Land\", \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Crazy\" and \"Electric Blue\", but also the downside of success, with Iva contending with a band break-up and a personal breakdown. He also discusses 1993's experimental seventh album Big Wheel and why Icehouse's days as a recording act came to an end, capping off a legacy that endures to this day, with Icehouse remaining one of Australia's most popular touring bands.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie each count down their personal top 3 Icehouse singles and dive deeper into the sound and success of the band. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 29: Ricki-Lee Part 1​\n\nIn a career spanning almost 20 years, Ricki-Lee Coulter has gone from the shock of an early elimination in Season 2 of Australian Idol to a prominent presence on the pop culture landscape thanks to her 15 top 50 hit singles, four studio albums, hosting gigs on two of the country's top reality shows (including the 2023 revamp of Idol) and role as a radio host. In the first of a two-part chat, Ricki discusses her decision not to originally sign with Sony Music but go with independent record company Shock Records instead and the string of hits she had on that label, many of which she co-wrote. Why did she cry on the set of her very first music video for debut single \"Hell No!\"? How did her highest-charting single, \"Can't Touch It\", wind up on a Hollywood film soundtrack? Which of her music videos was Video Hits unhappy about? Why did she release a singles collection after only two studio albums? Ricki-Lee has the answers. We also hear about her detour into girl group territory with Young Divas and some surprising never-before-shared memories of that roller-coaster ride.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Listen to the full interview with Ricki-Lee here.\n\nEPISODE 30: Ricki-Lee Part 2​\n\nWe continue to follow Ricki-Lee Coulter's musical journey from when her time at Shock Records came to an end after the disappointing performance of singles \"Don't Miss You\" and \"Hear No, See No, Speak No\" and the decision by Ricki to shelve her intended third album. She explains why the choices being made at this stage weren't ones she agreed with and how meeting husband Richard Harrison helped her get her career back on track. That reset happened with Fear & Freedom, with Ricki-Lee recalling how that album came about and the process of signing to major label EMI to release it. With hits like \"Raining Diamonds\" and \"Do It Like That\", things went incredibly well, but a record company merger led to the follow-up, Dance In The Rain, having a difficult rollout and the situation surrounding subsequent stand-alone singles \"Not Too Late\" and \"Unbothered\" once again signalling to Ricki that it was time to move on. Now a fully independent artist, Ricki-Lee discusses the work she's been doing over the past year with production duo DNA, which includes current single \"On My Own\" and an upcoming album she promises is full of bangers.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Listen to the full interview with Ricki-Leehere.\n\nEPISODE 31: CDB with Andrew De Silva, Gary & Brad Pinto and Danny Williams​\n\nR&B and funk had been slow to take off in Australia, but when those genres really started to be embraced locally in the mid-'90s, a four-piece boy band from Melbourne were perfectly placed to become this country's pre-eminent vocal harmony group. All four original members of CDB (Andrew De Silva, Gary and Brad Pinto, and Danny Williams) join us to talk about how they slogged away on a scene that was just starting to take off and how a break providing backing vocals for Peter Andre was crucial in them securing their own record deal with Sony Music. With songs written by Andrew as a teenager, CDB were teamed up with established artists Paul Gray (from Wa Wa Nee) and Rockmelons to shape their sound into something commercial, with hits \"Hook Me Up\" and \"Hey Girl (This Is Our Time)\" following. But it was a remake of \"Let's Groove\" which propelled the group into the big league, with solid sales for debut album Glide With Me as a result. Second album Lifted, which showed a maturing of CDB's material with more songwriting input from other members, didn't perform as well despite featuring stellar tracks like \"Good Times\" and \"Back Then\". This was followed by Andrew's cancer diagnosis and departure from the group, and a missed opportunity for the second line-up, resulting in them disbanding. But you can't keep a good vocal group down, with CDB's more recent reunions highlighting the synergy the original four-piece has always had.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear more from Andrew, Brad, Gary and Danny in the full interview, in which they talk about fellow vocal harmony groups Kulcha and Past To Present, their chart-topping success in New Zealand and how well-behaved they were on the road. Plus, Andrew shares his experience of winning Australia's Got Talent. Listenhere.\n\nEPISODE 32: Kate Ceberano​\n\nFunk, dance, pop, soul, jazz, rock, musical theatre and, with new album My Life Is A Symphony, orchestral arrangements, Kate Ceberano has covered a lot of musical terrain in her 40-year recording career. In this honest and unflinching chat, the singer/songwriter discusses the pop side of her extensive catalogue of work, starting as singer of '80s band I'm Talking and continuing through the roller-coaster ride of her solo career. Commercial triumphs like Brave and Pash are dissected alongside fan favourites like Think About It! and Kensal Road, with Kate recounting behind-the-scenes stories and sharing what each experience has meant to her. From game-changing performances like the Jesus Christ Superstar arena spectacular to the false start of the Globe album, Kate's career is filled with fascinating stories and life lessons. And, of course, fantastic music, with singles like \"Bedroom Eyes\", \"Brave\", \"See Right Through\", \"Pash\" and \"True Romantic\" just some of the tracks covered.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie count down listeners' top 10 favourite pop singles from Kate Ceberano's career, and analyse the songs' appeal and commercial performance. Listenhere.\n\nEPISODE 33: Melissa Tkautz​\n\nA song that was originally intended just to be used in a dream sequence on soap opera E Street became the highest-selling Australian single of 1991 when it was released as the debut for then-teenage actress and singer Melissa Tkautz. That song was \"Read My Lips\" and in a frank and at times raw interview, Melissa reveals her naivety about the track's sexual overtones and how its success took everyone by surprise. She also talks about follow-ups \"Sexy (Is The Word)\" and \"Skin To Skin\", recording debut album Fresh and how she juggled her TV work with her music commitments. Melissa opens up about some of the experiences she had as a young pop star that were less than enjoyable and how she would have liked more creative input and control over her recordings — something she was able to achieve with her music comeback in 2005 with the Lost And Found album and her remake of \"The Glamorous Life\". As well as touching on personal tragedy and lessons learnt during her decades in the entertainment industry, Melissa celebrates her pop star experience and the whirlwind she was unexpectedly swept up in.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Gavin and Robbie go through the album tracks on Melissa's Fresh, giving their opinions on each song and discussing the influences that were likely at play. Listenhere.\n\nEPISODE 34: Deborah Conway on Do-Ré-Mi and solo success​\n\nAs vocalist of Do-Ré-Mi and as a solo artist, Deborah Conway has received critical acclaim and mainstream success, but in this wide-ranging interview, the singer/songwriter reveals her music career hasn't always been smooth sailing. From the unexpected success of Do-Ré-Mi's debut single for Virgin Records, \"Man Overboard\" — a song without a chorus — to the detour into a solo dance project that mostly remains locked away in the record company vault to that time in the early 2000s when she and musical and life partner Willy Zygier played in fans' lounge rooms, Deborah's story is one with surprising twists and turns. For every up, like her ARIA Award win for debut solo album String Of Pearls (which included hits \"It's Only The Beginning\" and \"Under My Skin\"), there's the tale of Do-Ré-Mi being pressured to go more pop on second album The Happiest Place In Town (which featured top 30 single \"Adultery\"). It's all delivered with Deborah's renowned dry wit and sharp sense of humour.\n\nEPISODE 35: Rockmelons with Bryon Jones and Ray Medhurst ​\n\nFrom their beginnings holding warehouse parties in Sydney's inner city to their string of chart hits in the late '80s and early '90s, Rockmelons always stood out from the rest of the Australian music scene by championing genres that few others did — and taking them mainstream. Formed by the core trio of Ray Medhurst and brothers Bryon and Jonathon Jones, the funk/soul/R&B/hip-hop/dance-influenced band also welcomed a series of regular and guest vocalists to their line-up, including John Kenny (the singer of \"Rhymes\" and \"New Groove\", among others), Sandi Chick, Peter Blakeley, Wendy Matthews and Deni Hines (who fronted \"Ain't No Sunshine\", \"That Word (L.O.V.E.)\" and \"It's Not Over\"). In an in-depth interview, Bryon and Ray recall the hurdles they surmounted on first two albums Tales Of The City and Form One Planet — lack of radio support, friction with certain collaborators, recording delays — and their against-the-odds success. They also talk about 2002's comeback album, Rockies 3, and the spanner in the works that prevented that enjoying a higher profile.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, Bryon and Ray talk about their writing and production work with the likes of CDB, Kaylan, and Bardot, and Bryon recalls working on the debut albums for Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll straight out of Australian Idol. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 36: Bardot Part 1: Belinda Chapple​\n\nIn early 2000, reality TV juggernaut Popstars changed the pop music landscape in Australia forever. Launched by the show, Bardot were an instant phenomenon, shooting to number 1 with debut single \"Poison\" and their self-titled album. Comprised of Belinda Chapple, Sophie Monk, Sally Polihronas, Katie Underwood and Tiffani Wood, the five-piece girl group encountered ups and downs during their relatively short career, many of which are recounted in Belinda's book, The Girl In The Band. In this first part of a Bardot special, Belinda joins us to talk about the experience of being in the group and how it culminated with a shock betrayal as her pop music career was unexpectedly taken away from her when the band was dissolved. Bardot's six top 20 singles and two albums are discussed, as well as pivotal moments like Katie's decision to leave as recording was underway for second album Play It Like That. Belinda also shares her experience in the industry after Bardot and what brought her and Katie back together as Ka'Bel.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, hear more from Belinda Chapple about her time in Bardot, as well as her early experiences with '90s girl groups Teen Queens and GF4, and what to expect from upcoming TV series Paper Dolls, which is based on a concept she came up with. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 37: Bardot Part 2: Sally Polihronas​\n\nFor Sally Polihronas, the Bardot experience had its ups and downs. On the plus side, being part of the girl group allowed her to really hone her vocal skills — something she wanted to focus on after more than a decade as a dancer and performer in Adelaide — and took her into the studio with producers around the world. She also got to have her \"Madonna moment\" in the \"These Days\" video and has many cherish memories of Bardot's achievements. But there were drawbacks, too. In an exclusive in-depth interview, Sally reveals what made her think about quitting Bardot long before the group disbanded in early 2002 and why she stuck around until the (literally) bitter end. She also sheds new light on the discord within the band about things like the division of vocals and what she describes as \"mean girl\" behaviour. With a couple of decades of perspective, Sally can also rationalise why Bardot's time was brief, citing a number of external factors that contributed to the group's collapse.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Success in Asia. Popstars Season 2 winners Scandal'us. Katie Underwood's decision to leave the group. In the full interview, Sally Polihronas shares her thoughts on these and more Bardot memories. She also talks about her 2003 remake of \"We Will Together\" for the soundtrack to Nick Giannopoulos film The Wannabes. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 38: Bardot Part 3: Katie Underwood​\n\nDespite a background on Melbourne's dance music scene and no intentions of being a pop star, Katie Underwood did just that, becoming one of the most recognisable members of Bardot and given prominent lead vocals on all three singles from the self-titled debut album, \"Poison\", \"I Should've Never Let You Go\" and \"These Days\". In an extensive interview about her music career, Katie explains her motivations for being part of the Popstars girl group and what brought about her decision to leave Bardot during recording for second album Play It Like That. She also discusses the various musical projects she has been involved in since then, including her collaborations with Disco Montego, Mr Timothy and former Bardot band-mate Belinda Chapple as Ka'Bel. Katie also reveals how her solo career, which was kicked off by 2003 single \"Danger\", was dealt a blow when her record company dissolved, but how she now is in complete control of her musical output.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: There's more from Katie Underwood in the full interview, in which she discusses her first professional recording experience, working on feel-good TV series Undercover Angels, just what she was doing on the front cover of Bardot and more. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 39: Kids In The Kitchen with Scott Carne and Bruce Curnow​\n\nIn 1983, synthpop bands were big business on the Australian music scene, with Kids In The Kitchen snapped up by Mushroom Records imprint White Label Records. The band's singer, Scott Carne, and drummer, Bruce Curnow, discuss how weekend jam sessions quickly led to gigs and that record company interest. Hits followed, with \"Change In Mood\" and \"Bitter Desire\" both reaching the top 20, but a dispute over the music video for the latter led to two original members being asked to leave. With replacement members in position, more hits (including \"Something That You Said\" and \"Current Stand\") and platinum-selling debut album Shine made KITK one of the hottest bands in the country. But then the wheels started to come off, with under-performing singles (\"Out Of Control\", \"Say It\" and \"Revolution Love\") from second album Terrain, which was released after a disastrous trip to the US. Following the demise of the band, Scott was involved in two very different musical projects, but now, he and Bruce reunite with other KITK members for occasional concerts (including an upcoming show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne).\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview with Scott Carne and Bruce Curnow, find out more about the Kids In The Kitchen experience. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 40: Rick Price​\n\nIt was inevitable that singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Rick Price would forge a career in the music industry, but rather than jumping at any offer of a record deal that came his way, he took his time to ensure the situation was just right. Before signing to Sony Music and releasing debut album Heaven Knows in 1992, he worked for many years as a session singer, appearing in a national ad for Australia's Bicentennial in 1988 and on charity single \"You're Not Alone\" by Australian Olympians. He was also involved in the early stages of Girlfriend's career as a songwriter. When his own deal did fall into place as he wanted it to, he hit the ground running with back-to-back top 10 hits \"Not A Day Goes By\" and \"Heaven Knows\". Ever conscious of doing things his way, Rick switched up his sound for second album Tamborine Mountain — and he talks about his label's response to a less commercial approach and how they convinced him to come back to pop for third album Another Place. Rick also discusses his more recent independently released albums, his move to Nashville and collaboration with fellow early '90s star Jack Jones.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear Rick Price's earliest musical memories, how his working relationship with Tina Arena came about and more in the full interview. Listen here.\n\nEPISODE 41: Dannielle Gaha DeAndrea​\n\nBorn to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Dannielle Gaha grew up surrounded by singing and dancing, training and helping out at the talent school run by her mother, Janice Breen. She made her first steps into the industry herself by appearing on TV talent contest Star Search, which led to ongoing singing work with judge Glenn Shorrock and, through that, her big break — being picked to record duet \"Communication\" with John Farnham. Dannielle, who now goes by her married name DeAndrea, recalls those early stages of her career and what it was like performing with the biggest male singer in the country on the anti-drugs hit. She also discusses the music she released as a solo performer, Australian single \"I Like It\" and the three tracks through her deal with Epic Records in the UK: \"Stuck In The Middle\", \"Do It For Love\" and \"Secret Love\", most of which involved input from Wa Wa Nee's Paul Gray. Although that solo pop career didn't take off as she hoped, she landed on her feet in the mid-'90s with an ongoing gig as one-half of The Nissan Cedrics on Roy & HG's series, Club Buggery, and since then has carved out a diverse career in a range of musical styles.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: In the full interview, Dannielle Gaha DeAndrea talks about touring with Jason Donovan, reveals the Kylie Minogue song she demoed in the studio and gives more detail about the tracks she recorded for her unreleased album with Epic Records. Listen here.\n\nAussie Pop latest\n\nEPISODE 42: Deni Hines​\n\nIt wasn't a given that Deni Hines would pursue a career a music. Despite her mother, Marcia Hines, being one of the most recognisable pop stars in Australia, Deni had other interests and suffered from performance anxiety in her younger years. But her vocal talent soon got her snapped up as a backing singer for artists like Wa Wa Nee, Peter Blakeley and Kylie Minogue. It was her voice that also saw her hired as the latest frontperson for funk/dance band Rockmelons. In a frank and unflinching interview, Deni shares exactly what she thought of their collaboration and the hits that ensued. She also recalls guesting on \"Not Enough Time\" by INXS and what Michael Hutchence was like to work with in the studio. Then, after a solo deal in the US fell apart for reasons beyond her control, Deni landed at Mushroom Records and scored a top 5 hit with \"It's Alright\". She describes the process of putting together her debut album, Imagination, in London and follow-up singles like \"I'm Not In Love\" and \"Delicious\", a duet with Don-E that was added to the UK version of the album (retitled Pay Attention). When her time at Mushroom came to an end — following early 2000s single \"Frenzy\" — Deni went independent, and she talks about her various projects over the past couple of decades, including Water For Chocolate, The Soul Sessions and her upcoming album, due in 2024.\n\nBONUS CONTENT: Hear about the early record contract Deni Hines didn't accept, what it was like having her tracks remixed by David Morales and more in the full interview.
