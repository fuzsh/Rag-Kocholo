During this year of the revolution Dr. Irons resided in Paris. The archbishop, D. A. Affre, was shot and killed upon the barricade at the Bastille, while trying to persuade the rebels to cease firing. This took place on the 25th of June. On the 7th of July Irons was present at the memorial service conducted in the Notre Dame Cathedral. It was a most impressive service. The heart of the bishop was exhibited in a vessel in the chancel. The ritual, and especially “Dies irae,” sung by a large choir of priests, made a profound impression upon Irons. When he came back to his residence he wrote his translation of this hymn based upon the Latin text of the Paris Missal, and this is the most popular English version of this famous hymn. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nIRONS, William Josiah (1812-1883), was born at Hoddesdon, England, September 12, 1812. He took his B. A. degree at Queens College, Oxford, 1833, and became a clergyman of the Church of England, 1835. He served at various places until he became rector of St. Mary-Woolnoth in 1872, formerly held by his fathers friend, John Newton. He was also Bampton Lecturer in 1870 and Prebendary of St. Paul’s Cathedral. He died June 18, 1883. The Bampton Lectures on Christianity as Taught by St. Paul were his most important work. Numerous hymns and compilations of hymn-books are credited to him. He translated the Dies Irae and Quicumque vult. He published Metrical Psalter, 1857; Brompton Metrical Psalter, 1861; Hymns for Use in Church, 1866; Psalms and Hymns for the Church, 1873. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\ntr. 537\n\nIsaac, Heinrich, c. 1450-1517\n\nThis tune was composed, or possibly only arranged, by Heinrich (Henricus) Isaac, born cat 1450. Isaac was a prominent and prolific composer, living for some time in Florence (Firenze). For a time he was concert master at the court of Emperor Maximilian I. He composed 24 masses, and his Choralis Constantini embraces the complete Catholic liturgy. His music bears the mark of the German and Italian school as well as the influence of the Netherland school.—Concerning this melody, Mozart said that he would gladly give his best production in exchange for it. A similar sentiment was at one time expressed by Johann Sebastian Bach, who employed this melody in several of his compositions. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nISAAK (Isaac, Izac, Ysack, Yzac), Heinrich (c.1450-c.1527), also known in Italy by the name of Arrigo Tedesco, was one of the foremost musicians of his day. He was very likely a Netherlander, in spite of the fact that the Italians called him Tedesco or Gemmanus, as his testament designates him as Ugonis de Flandria. He was at Ferrara for a time, and then went to Florence to serve as organist of the Church of San Giovanni. He was also organist at the Medici Chapel, 1477-93, and music-master to the children of Lorenzo the Magnificent. After the death of his patron in 1492, Isaak appears to have remained for some years in Italy, where he enjoyed a great reputation. He left for Vienna in 1496 and became Symphonista regis, or chapelmaster, to Maximilian I at Innsbruck, 1497-1515. He retired on an annual pension of 150 florins, returned to Italy, and was recommended to Duke Ercole of Ferrara, but without result. The last trace history gives of him is at San Lorenzo Maggiore in Rome, old and sick, and without means. Isaak died in Florence. He was a prolific composer of motets, masses, chorales and songs. His masses number 23 or 24. His Choralis Constantini embraces the complete Roman Catholic liturgy. Isaak was an eminent contrapuntist. One of his peculiarities is the frequent appearance of the melody in the soprano, which was an unusual procedure at his time.

He received his education in the College and Seminary at Gettysburg and from 1864 to 1867 served as professor in the College. He was home missionary at Pittsburgh, 1867-1868, and then became pastor at Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, and principal of Thiel Hall, 1868-1870, and then served as professor at Pennsylvania College, 1870 to 1883. From then until his death he was Professor of Systematic Theology at the Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia. Among his works are the following: History of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the United States; Elements of Religion; Martin Luther, the Hero of the Reformation; German Emigration to America; A Summary of Christian Faith. He was editor of the Lutheran Church Review from 1882 to 1896, translated Hutter’s Compendium of Lutheran Theology and H. Schmid’s Doctrinal Theology of the Lutheran Church. He died July 11, 1932. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n311\n\nJeffrey, J., 1880\n\nThe English translation was rendered by J. Jeffrey in 1880. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\ntr. 295\n\nJohn of Damascus, c. 750\n\nJohn of Damascus, or John the Damascene, was born in Damascus near the beginning of the 8th century. He was the last of the Greek Church Fathers and, according to Neale, he was also the greatest of the Greek hymn writers. Rudelbach says: “Throughout the Greek Church he was acknowledged as the foremost writer of sacred poetry; his hymns were likened to the sweet music of the lyre and the joyful notes of the song of the nightingale.” Together with his foster-brother, Cosmas, he was educated in Damascus and dwelt there several years. He was employed in several high offices of the state. Later on he gave away all his property and, together with Cosmas, retired to the cloister of St. Sabas, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. John of Damascus was highly recognized in the church for his great festival odes and other hymns. He was otherwise known as the ablest opponent of the so-called Iconoclasts (Image-destroyers). His appeal to legendary history and appreciation of the beautiful; to the intimate connection between the visible image and the invisible things of the spirit revealed to believers, furnished him with powerful weapons for the attack. He says: “I am too poor to possess books. I come to the church filled with worldly thoughts, and the glowing colors soothe me like a scene in the flower garden. Imperceptibly the glory of God takes possession of my soul. I see the exalted place and the crown of the martyrs, and I feel a holy and burning desire to emulate them. I kneel down, in the martyr I worship God and accept salvation. The Lord called His disciples blessed for what they had heard and seen, and through the picture (image) we share in the same blessedness.”\n\nFrom the story of his youth the following incident is related: “The father of the Damascene was a lawyer and judge. One day he met a monk who had been taken prisoner by pirates at sea. He was doomed to die and stood weeping pleading for his life. When the judge ridiculed him for weeping, the monk answered: ‘I do not weep because I fear for my life, but I weep at the thought of the enormous mountain of learning which must perish with me,’ and he counted upon his fingers all the sciences which he had mastered. The judge was deeply moved, secured his release and entrusted to him the tutorship of his son.” In his later years John of Damascus served in the church of Jerusalem. His hymns, especially those written for the Easter Festival, the Ascension, and the St. Thomas Festival, had far-reaching influence upon the hymn writing of the Greek Church. Hymns connected with the name John Arklas have also been ascribed to John of Damascus. He has been called the “Thomas Aquinas of the Orient.”—It might be of interest to give an account of the incident which brought forth the present Easter hymn, the subject of this sketch. The scene is laid in Athens, Easter Eve. The midnight hour is drawing near. The archbishop and the priests, together with the king and the queen, come out from the church and ascend a large platform from which they may be seen by the crowd. The people stand round about in silent expectation, reverently holding their torches which are ready to be lighted. A muffled song of the monks is heard from a distance. The firing of a cannon announces the midnight hour. The old archbishop raises the cross toward the heavens and with a powerful and jubilant voice he exclaims: “Christos anesti” (Christ is arisen). The silence is broken by the triumphant shout of joy coming from the multitudes who repeat the grand message: “Christ is risen! Easter Morn is breaking, darkness fades away.” In a moment thousands of torches are lighted as by a magic stroke and the light is reflected from the many faces beaming with enthusiastic joy. The air is filled with the playing of instruments, the roll of drums and the roaring of cannons. The people shake hands and embrace each other. From the olive groves the rockets shoot up towards the sky. Christ is risen! He has conquered death, trampled it under foot, and by the power of His resurrection all the faithful, whose bodies are in their graves, shall arise unto eternal life. Thus the hymn of the priests, re-echoed by the multitudes, rings out exultingly with an impassionate spirit, which only the true Easter joy can create. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nJOHN OF DAMASCUS, ST. (c.750), Greek theologian and hymn-writer, was born in Damascus and educated by the elder Cosmas. He held an office under the Mohammedan Caliph and afterwards retired to the monastery of St. Sabas, near Jerusalem, where he composed theological works and hymns. He was ordained priest of the Church of Jerusalem late in life and lived to a high age; December 4, the day of his death, is assigned to him in the Greek calendar. He was one of the last of the Fathers of the Greek Church and has been called the greatest of her poets. He gave an immense impetus to Greek hymnody, and the arrangement of the Octoechus in accordance with the Eight Tones was his work. The best known of his canons is the Easter or Golden canon. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n347, 356\n\nJonson, B., 1572?-1637\n\n130\n\nJoseph the Hymnographer, c. 800-883\n\nJOSEPH, THE HYMNOGRAPHER, ST. (c.800-883), was born in Sicily and received his early training at the Sicilian school of poets. He left Sicily in 830 for the monastic life at Thessalonica and moved successively to Constantinople, Rome, Crete (where he was a slave), and finally back to Constantinople. There he founded a monastery in connection with the Church of St. John Chrysostom. He was banished to the Chersonese for defense of the icons, but was recalled by the Empress Theodora and made Scenophylax (keeper of the sacred vessels) in the Great Church of Constantinople. He died at an advanced age in 883. His day in the calendar of the Greek Church is April 3. St. Joseph is the most voluminous of the Greek hymnwriters. He is said to have composed 1,000 canons.

He was vicar of Wincobank (18761915), and from 1905 onward vicar of Topcliffe. He was canon of York from 1901 on. He is noteworthy for his monumental Dictionary of Hymnology. He also wrote: Concerning Hymns; The Outgrowth of Some Literary, Scientific, and Other Hobbies; he composed a number of hymns and translations.

He and his brother Thomas studied under their father’s tutorship until the age of 14, when he matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He proved himself to be a brilliant scholar, and within a short time received many marks of honor. He was graduated in 1810, and at the age of 18 years became Fellow at Oriel College. He was ordained in 1816 and became curate of East Leach and Burthope. In 1827 appeared his classic, The Christian Year, a collection of religious poems and hymns for the church year. It was said concerning these poems that “nothing equal to them existed in our language.” Ninety-six editions of this work were published under the direct supervision of the author. In the course of 25 years 108,000 copies were sold, and by 1873 the number had mounted to 305,300. The poems of this collection are really not church hymns in the strict sense of the term. But they have been a source of inspiration for many later hymn writers and many hymns have been made upon portions of Keble’s work. One author says: “I know of no body of poetry where purity and power, where knowledge of Holy Scripture and knowledge of the human heart, where the love of nature and the love of Christ are so wonderfully combined.” In 1831 Keble was appointed professor of poetry at Oxford. He also became one of the leaders in the reform movement through the Church of England, the so-called “Oxford Movement.” In this connection he produced a series of articles called The Tracts for the Times. In 1835 his father died, and the following year Keble was appointed vicar of Hursley, at which place he labored until his death, March 29, 1866. John Keble’s noble character and his pathetic love for his parents and brothers and sisters must be emphasized. In order to help them and be near them he time and again declined the offer of splendid positions in the church. His father being sickly, and his mother having died at an early age, John Keble assumed the duties of his father. Any one, and especially our theologians and pastors, will be benefited by studying the life of John Keble. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nKEBLE, John (1792-1866), was born, April 25, 1792, at Fairford in Glaucestershire, and at the age of 15 won a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1812 he also won both the English and Latin prize essays. He was ordained deacon in 1815 and priest in 1816. From 1836, when he accepted the living of Hursley, near Winchester, his life was spent mostly in this small country parish, devoted faithfully to its simple duties, though he exerted great influence throughout England by a vast correspondence. Quiet and retiring as he was, he is yet considered, on Newman’s testimony, as the real author of the Oxford movement, to which he is held to have given the impulse by his sermon on National Apostasy, preached at Oxford in 1833. His important contribution to the literature of the movement was his share in the translations of the Library of the Fathers and in the Tracts for the Times, of which he wrote seven, besides being ultimately associated in counsel with the other authors. His The Christian Year, a volume of verse which he published anonymously in 1827 had a remarkable success and influence, not equaled by that of his later volume Lyra Innocentium, 1846. He was professor of poetry at Oxford from 1831 to 1841. He died at Bournemouth, March 29, 1866. Keble College in Oxford was founded as a memorial to him. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n577\n\nKehl, Roy F., 1984\n\nsetting: 498\n\nKeimann, Christian, 1607-62\n\nChristian Keimann was born February 27, 1607, in Pankratz, Bohemia, where his father served as a minister. In 1627 he began his studies at the University of Wittenberg, receiving his master’s degree in 1634. The same year he was appointed associate director of the gymnasium of Zittau, and in 1638 was promoted to the position of director. He died in Zittau, 1662. Keimann was a prominent teacher and author, especially of scholastic writings. His hymns, about 13 in number, are among the best of his time; they breathe a firm conviction of faith; they are churchly; they are an expression of sound Christian experience and are characterized by exceptional poetic beauty. The melody was composed by James Tilleard (b. England, 1827, —d. 1876). A second melody by H. Pope has been taken from a Swedish book of chorales, where it was set to J. O. Wallin’s hymn: “Stilla jag pea dig vill akta.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nKEIMANN (Keymann), Christian (1607-1662), was the son of Zacharias Keimann, a Lutheran pastor at Pankratz, Bohemia, where Christian was born on February 27, 1607. In 1627 Keimann entered the University of Wittenberg and in 1634 graduated (M. A.). The same year he was appointed by the Town Council of Zittau as Conrector of their Gymnasium, of which he became Rector in 1638. He was a distinguished teacher, author of a number of scholastic publications, several Scriptural plays, and of some thirteen hymns, almost all of which came into church use. They rank high among those of the seventeenth century, being of genuine poetic ring, fresh, strong, full of faith under manifold and heavy trials, and deeply spiritual. He died January 13, 1662, at Zittau. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n163, 362\n\nKelly, John, 1833-90\n\ntr. 304, 341, 377\n\nKelly, Thomas, 1769-1854\n\nThomas Kelly, the son of an Irish judge of the same name, was born in Kellyville, Queens county, Ireland, July 13, 1769. It was his father’s wish that the son should study law, so he entered Dublin University. One of the works which he read awakened his interest for Hebrew, and during the course of his study of this language, he was brought in closer touch with the Holy Scriptures. This led him again to read other works of a religious nature. He was especially impressed by a treatise written by the pious William Roumaine. Having completed his reading of Roumaine’s work, Kelly determined to forsake the world and all its attractions and take up the study of theology. His religious fervor developed at first into fanaticism, and his asceticism undermined his health, until he finally found peace and comfort through faith in the grace of God through Jesus Christ. In 1792 he was ordained to the ministry in the Episcopalian Church and began to proclaim the old Gospel of sin and grace, of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. He found a good friend and co-worker in the famous preacher Rowland Hill, who was also educated in the Church of England. Hill served for a time as traveling preacher in the western part of England and in Ireland. These two men were, however, soon to experience that such purely evangelical sermons did not please the leading men of the Episcopalian Church of Ireland. It did not harmonize with the viewpoint and requirement of the times. Rowland Hill and Kelly were forbidden by Archbishop Fowler to preach in his bishopric. In other words, they were suspended from the Episcopalian Church. But Archbishop Fowler could not forbid them to proclaim the Gospel. Thus Kelly became a so-called Dissenter preacher. He set up preaching places in Dublin and the surrounding districts, where he became the soul of the evangelical movement. He was met by strong opposition, not only from the archbishop and the clergy, but even from his own family. But in return he was loved by the common people and not the least by the poorer classes in Dublin. After some time he also gained universal recognition on account of his culture and thorough learning, but especially on account of his endearing personality, his sincere piety and humility, his charity work, and untiring zeal for the extension of the Kingdom of God. At the age of 30 he was married to a young lady, who shared his spiritual views and who brought him a goodly fortune. Thomas Kelly is the Prince of the Singers of Erin. In 1802 he issued a Collection of Psalms and Hymns Extracted from Various Authors. This contained a supplement of 33 hymns written by himself. In 1804 he published 98 original hymns: Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture. During a number of years this appeared in several enlarged editions, until, in the last edition of 1854, there were 765 original hymns by Kelly. It is evident that, among so many original hymns, many are of lesser merit. But the greater number in this collection are of high rank. About 100 of them are in universal use. One hymnologist asserts that Kelly is at his best in the hymns of praise and in the hymns written in the more modern meter. His hymns are characterized by simplicity and natural expression. His hymns reflect in the main his charming personality; they are lyrical and Biblical. They are not so subjective as the great number of hymns of the Methodist school. Kelly was a talented musician and wrote melodies for all the various metrical forms used in his hymnal. He died of heart failure in 1855, at the age of 86. As he felt death approaching he exclaimed: “Not my will, but Thine be done.” One of his friends read to him: “The Lord is my Shepherd.” He whispered: “The Lord is my All.” His last words. Later years have brought a new interest in Kelly’s hymns, particularly on account of the many beautiful melodies furnished for them by Miss Havergal. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nKELLY, Thomas (1769-1854), was born at Kellyville, Athy, Queens County, Ireland, on July 13, 1769. His primary education was obtained at Portarlington and Kilkenny. He received his secondary education at Trinity College of Dublin University. He graduated with the highest honors. Expecting to become a lawyer, Kelly went to the Temple in London for that purpose. At the Temple he befriended Edmund Burke. While reading law Kelly had to study Hutchinson’s Moses Principla, which required him to study Hebrew. This in turn interested him in Romaine’s teachings. While thus engaged, Kelly developed a consciousness of sin that distressed him very much. He now practiced asceticism, and even jeopardized his life by his rigorous discipline. He took holy orders in the Established Church in 1792. At this time he became an intimate of Walter Shirley, and his sympathies were wholly with the evangelical movement. Because of the dearth of evangelical preaching, people very soon flocked to hear him preach in Dublin. This aroused the ire of Archbishop Fowler to such an extent that he forbade Kelly and his friend Rowland Hill to use the Irish pulpits. Kelly, however, continued preaching at Plundet Street and Bethesda in Dublin and also had meetings at an alderman’s home in Luson Street. Having seceded from the Established Church, Kelly built chapels with his own money on York Street, at Athy, Portarlington, Wexford, Waterford, and elsewhere. About 1800 he married Miss Tighe of Rosanna, Wicklow. In 1804 his Hymns on Various Passages appeared. While preaching at the age of eighty-five, Kelly had a severe stroke, which resulted in his death on May 14, 1854. Benson ranks Kelly with the best of English hymnists. Many of the 765 hymns are in use. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n297, 390, 393\n\nKen, Thomas, 1637-1711\n\nThomas Ken was born in Berkhampstead, England, 1637. His parents died when he was a child, and he was reared in the home of Izaac Walton, who was married to Ken’s elder sister. In 1651 he became a pupil at Winchester College. In 1657 he was made fellow of New College, Oxford; rector of Little Easton, 1663; fellow of Winchester, 1666; rector of Brighstone, the following year; promoted to the rectorship of Woodhay and prebendary of Winchester, 1669. In 1679 he was appointed court preacher for Princess Mary, at The Hague, Holland. He returned to England the following year. In 1685 he was elected bishop of Bath and Wells. He was imprisoned in 1688 because he refused to subscribe to the so-called “Declaration of Indulgence.” He died in Longleat, 1711.\n\nBishop Ken was a bold and zealous servant of the Lord. He was compelled to leave the court of Princess Mary in Holland because of his fearless opposition to the riotous mode of life maintained there. When Charles II came to Winchester and requested room in the pastor’s house for his concubine, Nell Gwynne, and her company, the bishop bravely refused, and it seems that the king was deeply impressed by his fearless and firm attitude, since he secured his appointment to the bishopric.\n\nBishop Ken ministered to the king when he lay upon his deathbed. James II called Ken “the most eloquent Protestant preacher.” He was also a warmhearted friend of the poor and needy. According to his own wish he was buried at sunrise, in Frome, below the east chancel window of the church, during the singing of his morning hymn, “Awake, my soul, and with the sun.” After Ken’s death his Hymns for all the Festivities of the Year were published in 1721. In the course of time a large number of centos of Ken’s hymns have been made. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nKEN, Thomas (1637-1711), was born in July, 1637, at little Berkhamstead. His mother died when he was but four years old, and his father followed her very shortly. He was brought up by his half-sister Anne, wife of Izaac Walton, author of the Compleat Angler. He was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. His musical talent expressed itself at this period in his fine voice, on the lute, on the organ, and on the viol. He was ordained in 1662 and held several livings until 1666, when he returned as Fellow to Winchester College. There he prepared for the boys of the school his Manual of Prayers, which contained his three most famous hymns. In 1679 he was created Doctor, and was appointed, by the Duke of York, chaplain to his daughter Princess Mary, the wife of William of Orange, at the Hague. Dismissed for his outspokenness, he returned to England and became chaplain of Charles II. At Whitehall the King once left his court with the words: “I must go hear Ken tell me my faults.” Later when the court visited Winchester, the King wanted Ken to house his mistress, Nell Gwynne. Ken replied: “Not for a kingdom.” In spite of this bold defiance Charles appointed Ken bishop of Bath and Wells. He was consecrated June 29, 1685. In lieu of the customary consecration-dinner Ken gave 100 pounds to charity. Eight days later Ken was called in to minister to the King who had suffered a stroke. For three days the bishop pleaded and prayed and finally got the King to give up “poor Nell” and to make amends to the Queen. But the Duke of York through the Papist priest Huddleston received the King into the fold of the Catholic section of the Church. At the coronation of James II, Ken was the right-hand supporter of the King. After the battle of Sedgmore, by the King’s behest, Ken had to minister to the hardened Duke of Monmouth. After the execution, which Ken attended, he used his influence to stop the wholesale execution of the Dukes followers. He was one of the seven bishops who refused to read, at the Kings command, the “Declaration of Indulgence” or the” Liberty of Conscience to All.” They were speedily imprisoned in the Tower. Later they were all acquitted amid the loud exultation of the people. Shortly after, the King abdicated, and Mary with William of Orange became sole rulers of England. Ken refused to swear allegiance and, after the year of grace allowed had ended, was deprived of his bishopric. The remainder of Ken’s life was uneventful. He was offered his bishopric again upon the accession of Anne but declined it, pleading ill health. In the last years of his life he suffered acutely from various ailments, but uncomplainingly. He died March 19, 1711, and was buried just before sunrise two days later under the chancel-window of the church at Frome, Selwood. He published Hymns and Poems for the Holy Days and Festivals of the Church (this suggested to Keble the idea of his The Christian Year); Anodynes, written in his last years of suffering.

Kennedy was the president of the Shrewsbury School from 1836 to 1866 and in 1867 was made professor of Greek at Cambridge. From the latter date he also served as canon of Ely. He was ordained to the ministry in 1829, but served in a pastorate only a short time. Kennedy prepared a number of splendid textbooks for school use. Also several editions of ancient classics, and a volume of University Sermons. Approximately 127 of his hymn-paraphrases were published in his Psalter and Hymnologia Christiana mentioned above. The latter contains also a great many translations from the German, and several original hymns. Kennedy died April 6, 1889.

Kennedy took holy orders in 1829 and served for a while as Prebendary in the Litchfield Cathedral and Rector of West Felton, Salop. Kennedy’s chief hymnological works are his Psalter in English Verse, 1860, and Hymnologia Christiana, 1863.

The date and place of birth of William Kethe are unknown. He was an exile from Scotland for some time during the Marian persecutions, at Frankfurt in 1555, and at Geneva in 1557. During this exile he contributed twenty-four metrical psalms to the Psalm Book prepared by these English refugees and also helped in the translation of the Bible. In 1561 he was made rector of Childe Okeford, Dorsetshire, and probably remained there until his death. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n51\n\nKingo, Thomas H., 1634-1703\n\nThomas Hansen Kingo, born in Slangerup, Denmark, December 15, 1634, was the son of a linen weaver, Hans Thomesøn Kingo. His father came, at an early age, to Denmark from Scotland. Thomas Kingo spent his boyhood years in Slangerup and in Fredriksborg, where he attended the Latin school. In 1654 he passed the examen artium and, after four years’ study at the university, completed his course for the ministry in 1658. After serving for some time as private tutor, he became assistant pastor with Peder Jakobssøn Worm, and remained with him seven years. Worm died in 1668, and in the same year, in August, Kingo became pastor in his native city of Slangerup. By this time he had become known as a poet. In 1665 appeared his Sæbygaards Koklage and subsequently, among others, the famous pastoral poem - Chrysillis, which became very popular. His rank as a poet was thus established even before he appeared as a hymn writer. Therefore, Bishop Wandal, in his preface to Kingo’s first hymn book, called him “our most famous Danish bard.” At Christmas, 1673, his collection of spiritual songs, Aandelig Sjungekors første Part (Spiritual Songs, First Part) appeared. This contained only twenty-one hymns: fourteen morning and evening hymns, and seven of the penitential Psalms of David. While his other poetry followed the style of his times and has but little of present-day interest, his hymns have exceptional vigor and beauty. His morning psalms are like the morning dawn itself, presaging the coming of a new day for Danish poetry. In 1670 he was appointed bishop of the diocese of Fyen, which at that time included also Lolland and Falster. He performed the duties of his office faithfully and did not spare those who were neglectful of their work, while at the same time he proved a friend and helper to all who were conscientious in the performance of their duties. On the 15th of June, 1679, Kingo was made a member of the Danish nobility, and in 1682 he was created doctor of theology.\n\nIn 1681 appeared the second part of Aandelig Sjungekor. This contained twenty hymns and sixteen prayers. Of the hymns six deal with confession and sanctification; four with the Lord’s Supper; five with the vanity of the world and the providence of God; three are table hymns; a devotional for travelers; and a hymn for sea-farers. In poetic beauty and force this edition was fully equal to the first part. Kingo now ranked as the first poet of Denmark. He supplied melodies for his hymns, and some hymns were composed directly to secular melodies (folksongs). To justify this latter practice he directs an appeal to “the courteous and fairminded reader,” in which he calls attention to the fact that he thereby desires to make these tuneful and pleasant melodies more heavenly and more devotional: “If you through some pleasing melody enjoy a song of Sodom, how much more ought you not, as a true child of God, to enjoy a song of Zion with the same melody.” King Christian V, under whose directions the ritual of the church was being prepared, desired also to have a new hymn book to take the place of Hans Thomissøn’s, which had been in use since 1569. This hymnal (Thomissøn’s) had been reprinted many times with but few changes up to the middle of the 17th century. From that time, however, it was to a large extent supplanted by various editions, especially by the publications of the firms of J. Moltke, Kr. Cassuben, Kr. Geertsøn, and Dan. Paulli, publishers of Copenhagen. The many editions which appeared contained the hymns of Thomissøn’s Hymnal, but included also a great amount of material borrowed from various devotional writings and poor translations. In many cases the original hymn book made up the smaller part of the editions. Complaints began to be made that almost every congregation, “nay, almost every church-goer carried a different hymn book.” Furthermore, so many misprints and errors appeared that the old, familiar hymns could scarcely be recognized. Hence, when Kingo’s Spiritual Songs appeared, it was only natural that the desire for better hymnaries made itself felt. It was also natural that King Christian V, in casting about for a better hymn collection, turned his thought toward Kingo’s edition. By the royal rescript of March 27, 1683, Kingo was ordered to prepare a new hymn book to contain “the best of the old, familiar hymns and a good number of his own compositions, so that more variety of selection might be possible in the future.” Kingo was further ordered to retain without change the principal hymns sung before the sermon on Sundays. A change in these would not be tolerated except in cases where a new word here or there might actually improve the hymn. Under no circumstance should there be any change in the thought of any of Luther’s hymns. With respect to the arrangement of material, each Sunday was to have its own series of hymns, “not too long, and according to the best and most familiar church melodies.” When this new book had been approved and accepted, Kingo should publish it and possess the sole right of sale, at a popular price, for fifteen years. Churches and schools were to be required to buy it, and the use of any other hymnal was to be strictly forbidden.\n\nSix years later, in 1689, the first part appeared. This was called The Winter Part (from Advent to Easter) and contained 267 hymns. Of these, 136 were by Kingo. It was approved January 25, 1690, and ordered to be introduced in all the churches of the kingdom. The order should take effect upon the first Sunday in Advent of that year. But on the 22nd of February the king cancelled this order and also Kingo’s rights of publication. This was a hard blow to him, but not wholly undeserved, as he had not followed the prescribed method of procedure. The greater number of the hymns, except those by Kingo himself, were not well suited for church use. The task was now given to Søren Jonassøn, dean of Roskilde, but the collection which he delivered in 1693 did not contain a single one of Kingo’s hymns, and for that reason could not be approved. Kingo then sent a petition to the king, and the result was that a commission was appointed to prepare a new hymnal based upon the outline of Kingo’s hymn book. The developments, however, proved disappointing to Kingo. In the new hymnal only 85 of his hymns appeared and in the book of family devotions, prepared at the same time, only 21 hymns from the first part of Spiritual Songs were made use of, and 3 from the second part. On July 21, 1699, the hymn book popularly known as Kingo’s was introduced in all the churches of Denmark. But the adversity which he encountered in connection with the hymnary was not the only incident which cast a gloom over his later years. His successor in office, Bishop Müller, accused Kingo of misappropriation of funds, but after a long and bitter court trial, Kingo was exonerated. The charge of avariciousness, which by some has been placed against him, has never been substantiated. He was recognized as an able and energetic bishop, and his secular poems were praised very highly. But his fame rests mainly on his immortal hymns. A Danish author says of him: “He showed rare genius in moulding language into beautiful rhythm, in unfolding deeply religious thought in clear and striking pictures. New and melodious expressions are born through him. The force of his Alexandrine stanzas, which otherwise might have developed into bombast and empty pathos, has in his hymns been combined with the most elegant grace.” As Grundtvig, the famous hymn writer, once expressed it, “He effected a combination of sublimity and simplicity, a union of splendor and fervent devotion, a powerful and musical play of words and imagery which reminds one of Shakespeare.” But the chief characteristic of his work is to be sought in the manner in which he brought out the true hymn spirit and gave it a deeply religious expression. For this reason he has been called, “Salmisten i det danske kirkekor” (The Psalmist of the Danish Church Choir). Personally he was of a very excitable and even impassionate temperament, and thus would have been able to picture varying moods of stress and trial in the deeply religious soul, but in his hymns he does not often dwell on the subjective moods. His hymns are always tempered by experience, experience supported by and interwoven with the everlasting thoughts and facts of a living Christianity. For that reason his hymns are truly church hymns. Of course, rationalism did not appreciate his Christianity nor his hymns, but when this movement receded, in the 19th century, Kingo again was restored to his place of honor. Bishop Skaar says: “Among the finest hymns in Spiritual Songs must be mentioned the morning and evening hymns with their accompanying prayers, and the table and communion hymns. His hymns based upon the Gospel and epistle lessons, especially, express in striking phrases the thoughts that stir the hearts of Lutheran believers as they behold the life of the Savior upon earth; His lowly birth, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension. These hymns, which generally end with an appeal to lift the heart unto God in prayer and thanksgiving, have always been cherished by those who have learned to know them.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nKINGO, Thomas Hansen (1634-1703), Denmark’s first great hymnist, was born in Slangerup, Denmark, December 15, 1634. His grandfather had emigrated from Scotland to Denmark. Thomas spent his boyhood in Slangerup and Fredriksborg, where he attended the Latin school. He completed his course for the ministry in 1658, and from then until 1668 he served as tutor and assistant pastor, when he became pastor in Slangerup. He possessed unusual poetic gifts and early attracted attention with his secular poetry, especially his popular “Chrysillis.” 1673 marked the first appearance of his religious poetry Spiritual Songs, First Part (Aandelig Sjungekors förste Part), which made a great impression, and he was duly rewarded with the bishopric of the diocese of Fyen. He dedicated his Spiritual Songs to Christian V, and in his dedication address he championed the cause of true Danish hymnody over that of foreign peoples, for the Danes used many hymns of foreign origin in their worship. His hymns have exceptional vigor and beauty, and his value as a poet was gradually being realized. As further reward he was made a member of the Danish nobility in 1679 and created doctor of theology in 1682. The second part of his Aandelig Sjungekors appeared in 1681 and was dedicated to Queen Charlotte. In his dedication address he praised her heroic efforts to master the Danish language before coming to Denmark to be its queen, at the same time referring to certain foreign courtiers who spent thirty years in that country without endeavoring to learn thirty Danish words. Many of his hymns were sung to Danish folk songs, while he supplied melodies for some of them. At this time King Christian V desired to have a new hymnal to replace the one which had been in use since the year 1569. On March 27, 1683, Kingo was ordered to prepare this book, with certain specifications: He should include some of his own hymns, was to make very few changes in the old traditional hymns; and not to alter the meaning of Luther’s hymns in any way. In 1689 the first part of the hymn-book appeared, containing 267 hymns, of which 136 were Kingo’s own. It had been prepared at Kingo’s expense, but was now rejected because he had not followed the prescribed method of procedure. The task was turned over to Sören Jonassön, dean of Roskilde, and his book appeared in 1693, containing not a single one of Kingo’s hymns. This was consequently disapproved, and a commission was appointed under Kingo’s direction to try again. The new hymn-book was approved and introduced into all the churches of Denmark in 1699. Only eighty-five of Kingo’s hymns were contained in the book. However, he never recovered from the indignity and humiliation he had received in connection with these various controversies. He died October 14, 1703. His immortal fame rests on his religious rather than on his secular poetry. His morning hymns are among the finest songs of praise in existence and are truly church-hymns. Of his works Bishop Skaar says: “Among the finest hymns in Spiritual Songs must be mentioned the morning and evening hymns with their accompanying prayers and the table and Communion hymns. His hymns based upon the Gospel and Epistle lessons, especially, express in striking phrases the thoughts that stir the hearts of Lutheran believers as they behold the life of the Savior upon earth: His lowly birth, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension.

He intended to enter the teaching profession and at 17 went as a tutor to St. Petersburg. However, the music of Haydn and Mozart made such an impression on him that he decided on a musical career. His friend, Clementi, the great pianist, confirmed him in this decision. After he had studied in St. Petersburg, Kocher returned to Germany and published compositions of such promise that means were found by the publisher Cotta to enable him to proceed to Italy. There his studies, particularly of Palestrina, made him an enthusiast for church choral music. Returning to Germany, Kocher set about to improve church music by popularizing choral singing. From 1827 until 1865 he was organist of the Stiftskirche, Stuttgart. There Kocher founded a school of sacred song which started a movement that spread throughout Württemberg popularizing four-part singing. In 1852 the University of Tübingen gave him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Kocher occupied himself in the revision of various hymn-books and contributed new tunes to them. He published a large collection of chorales under the title Zionsharfe, 1854-1855, and Der Tod Abels, an oratorio, in addition to several operas, sonatas, and other pieces.

He became the leader in the work of compiling the hymn book for the Norwegian Synod. In this edition the above-mentioned hymn was first published in 1874. This happy version of the 100th Psalm of David, together with his translation of “Dies irae, dies illa” (Hymn bk. of Norw. Synod 54), and his revisions of a number of hymns, show his unusual ability to strike the true spirit of the church hymn. They bear witness of his aesthetic taste and marked sense of rhythm and euphony. His hymn paraphrase was entered into G. Jensen’s “Utkast til ny Salmebog” for the Church of Norway, but later omitted by the committee in charge. For the revised edition of the hymn book for the Norwegian Synod, Dr. Koren rewrote several hymns, making them better suited for church use. He was also very musical and keenly interested in the older rhythmic form of church music. At his suggestion was published the Rythmisk Koralbog, which had some influence upon the composition of The Lutheran Hymnary. The English translation of Dr. Koren’s hymn is by Mrs. Harriet R. Spaeth, 1898. The melody is by Erik Christian Hoff (b. 1832). Hoff was an organist in Christiania. Among other works he has published a book of chorals for church use.\n\nUlrik Vilhelm Koren was born in Bergen, Norway, December 22, 1826. He completed the course at the Cathedral School of Bergen and entered the University of Christiania in 1844. In 1852 he became a candidate of theology and was given a teaching position at Nissen’s latin og real-skole. In 1853 he received a call to a pastorate among some Norwegian congregations of the state of Iowa. He accepted this call and was ordained to the ministry in Norway on the 25th of July, 1853. During the winter the young minister, accompanied by his wife, Else Elisabeth (Hysing), set out upon the voyage across the ocean, to preach the Gospel to their countrymen who had settled on the plains of the far West. They arrived in Little Iowa (later called Washington Prairie) in December, 1853. Rev. U. V. Koren was the first Norwegian pastor to settle west of the Mississippi river. For many years he served the settlements of northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, a territory now comprising more than 20 parishes. In 1855 he was chosen secretary for the Norwegian Synod; was a member of the church council from 1861; vice-president of the Synod, 1871-1876; president of the Iowa district, 1876-1894; from 1894 until his death, 1910, president of the Norwegian Lutheran Synod of America. On Christmas Day, 1903, he delivered his 50th Christmas sermon before his congregation on Washington Prairie, where he had resided continuously throughout his long term of activity.

Landstad was accordingly baptized in the “northernmost church in the world.” In Oksnes he spent seven of his childhood years (from 2 till 9). Aside from the solitude, storm, and darkness, which prevailed in that region and oppressed the mind, war. hunger, and high prices often caused the ever increasing family to feel the lack of the very necessities of life. During his childhood occurred also the removal of the family from Oksnes to Vinje, Telemarken, October, 1811. The very next year was also a year of famine, 1812. All over the country the grain froze and the people suffered intensely from the war and high prices. But from Vinje Landstad could also draw brighter memories. He spent his childhood amid natural scenes which, tho harsh enough in the winter, still in the summer were replete with magic inspiration, and these environments warmed his spirit and placed an indelible stamp upon the feelings and imagination of the future hymn writer.\n\nHe received his preparatory training from his father, and in 1822 he began his studies at the university. During the following year he took his master’s examination and began the study of theology. When it became difficult for his parents to pay his expenses in Christiania, he was given a position as family tutor in Hadeland. The following year he returned to the university and continued his studies under the teachers Hersleb and Stenersen. In December, 1827, he passed the final examinations with the grade “laudabilis.” His graduation sermon was preached upon the text in 1 Cor. 11: 28-29. In November, 1828, he was appointed resident vicar of Gausdal. The following year he was married to Vilhelmine Lassen, a daughter of Albert Lassen, the dean of Grau, in Hadeland. In 1834 he was appointed to the pastorate of Kviteseid, and in 1839 he became his father’s successor as pastor of Seljord. In Kviteseid his income was very meagre, and sickness in his family further increased his difficulties. He was stricken with an attack of pneumonia and could not take over his father’s charge until 1840. In Seljord he labored for eight years under the most trying circumstances.\n\nIn Landstad’s Sange og Digte there are two memorial poems which date from his first year as a student. These poems were written as a tribute to two of his brothers who passed away. Aside from the inner promptings in his own soul, Landstad’s interest for hymn writing was awakened through an interesting incident of which he himself relates the following: “Once during my student days I happened to walk by a house where an auction sale of books was in progress. The doors were open and I entered without having in mind to make any purchase. Just then a package of old books was offered. I made a bid of four cents, the deal was made, and I walked home with my package. It contained two volumes in leather binding. One was Freuden-Spiegel des ewigen Lebens, by Philipp Nicolai. On the last few pages of this book four of Nicolai’s hymns were printed. The other book was Arrebo’s Hexaemeron, The Glorious and Mighty Works of the Creation Day. In that manner two splendid hymn collections, one German and one Danish-Norwegian, unexpectedly came into my possession. I was not acquainted with either of these works before. Nicolai’s hymns appealed to me very strongly, and I at once made an attempt to translate them. ‘Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme’ was rendered into Norwegian in essentially the same form as it now has in the hymnal, ‘Zions Vægter hæver Røsten.’ The second hymn, ‘Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern,’ was given a free rendering. This hymn, ‘Af Høiheden oprunden er,’ was already used by our church through Kingo’s Hymnary. Later on, therefore, when it became my duty to prepare the hymn book for the church, I limited my work upon this hymn to a few minor changes in Kingo’s version. My experience with these hymn collections, I believe, gave me the first impetus in the direction of hymn writing. Furthermore, it gave me a deeper insight into the life and spirit of the old church hymns.”\n\nLandstad’s first original hymn dates from his sojourn in Gausdal, “Ser jeg mig i Verden om” (Landst. 399). During his pastorate in Kviteseid he composed three hymns for the Reformation festival of 1837. Two of these were sung in his church on November 5 of that year: “O Kristenhed! i Nattens Stund” (Landst. 556) and “Herrens Raad ei Støv udgrunder.” But, if Landstad had already in his student days gained an “insight into the life and spirit of the old church hymns,” this deepened more and more as he began to delve into the works of the hymn writers of the Church. Landstad’s Hjertesuk (Prayers) are the direct fruit of these studies. In 1841, shortly after moving to Seljord, he published Hjertesuk til hver Dag i Ugen, Morgen og Aften, saa vel som ved andre Anledninger (Prayers for Morning and Evening, and Other Occasions). This work has later been printed in a great many editions and has proved a blessing to many. Ten of these Prayers are written by Landstad. Among these may be mentioned the following: “Slukt er Dagens lyse Flammer” (Landst. 616); “Jeg ligger her i Vaande” (Landst. Norw. ed. only, 621). The rest of these prayers were rewritten by Landstad and given better form. Two years later seven of his hymns appeared in the periodical Nor. Five of these are original. There is a marked foreign element, however, in many of these hymns. It is apparent that Landstad at the time borrowed from the Danish poets. He had not yet fully acquired the homelike and warmhearted tone which characterizes his later hymns. During his stay in Kviteseid he began to gather folk-songs. He completed the collection in Seljord and published it in 1853 under the title: Norske Folkeviser. This received much favorable mention from P. A. Munch and others. His work in the field of folk-song had great influence upon his development as a writer of hymns. Thus he learned to appreciate the force of that unaffected poetry which, by means of direct and simple words, is often capable of making the most profound impression upon the soul. He called forth from his harp deep-sounding and forceful tones, that struck a sympathetic chord in the hearts of his people. Through the hymns which he published the attention of the church officials was directed to Landstad as the logical man for the work of preparing a new hymn book for the Church of Norway. In 1848 the church department of the government requested him to undertake this task.\n\nHe declined at first, because his pastorate in Seljord claimed so much of his time. It left him no opportunity for study and research in the vast field of hymnological literature which would necessarily require his attention. He therefore applied for the pastorate of Fredrikshald and was appointed in 1849. The church department had not, however, given up the plan for a new hymn book for Norway, especially since W. A. Wexels, a “prominent follower of Grundtvig,” in 1849, also issued a hymnal which he desired should be considered as a “proposal for a new hymn book, submitted to the judgment of fellow-Christians.” In 1852 Landstad was again called upon to undertake the task of preparing the new hymnal. The same year he was granted an assistant in his pastorate, and on October 7th a royal resolution was passed, delegating to Landstad the work of preparing “an outline for a new church hymn book essentially along the lines of his previous plan.” In 1855 Landstad published Martin Luthers aandelige Sange, oversatte og med Anmerkninger ledsagede. Julesalmer, saadanne som de agtes foreslaaet til kirkelig Brug, followed in 1856; and in the spring of 1861 appeared the long looked for Kirke-Salmebog, et Udkast.\n\nLandstad’s book was reviewed by Morgenbladet, one of the leading papers of Norway, in the issues of August and September, 1861. It expressed sincere appreciation of the hymnal, and voiced the hope that the church people of Norway would rally around it. But the article also expressed the conviction that the omission of certain hymns, and especially that the form of language employed in the book would prove a serious handicap in the way of its adoption by the congregations. This review gave the occasion for Landstad’s reply, Om Salmebogen, first printed in Morgenbladet and later issued in book form. A few excerpts will suffice to show the trend of his defence: “If we are to get a new hymnal, we must meet on the common ground of faith in love. We must not cling to our preconceived notions; not let ourselves be influenced too strongly by our own tastes! nor by our own desires, as though we were the only ones entitled to a hearing. We must concede that others may also have well-founded demands that ought to be considered. Again, it is the common observation that differences of opinion arise over minor matters; but we must always hold fast to this principle: ‘not to swerve a hair’s breadth at any time from the true ground of faith’ (at vi ei fra Troens Grund et Haarsbred viger nogen Stund). Even those who speak from the assurance of conviction and authority may often be grossly in error. A church hymnal has the lofty mission of serving as the medium of confession, of prayer, and of praise, during the service in the sanctuary, as well as in the home. We must offer something which will serve the congregation, something which will satisfy their longings and desires, and which will fulfil the lofty missions of such a publication. If we would simply take from the existing material all that which seems serviceable and useful and without further ado include it in our hymnal, then a book could very easily be manufactured. The very fact that the material is so vast in volume, makes our task difficult, because all of it is not pure gold.” Concerning the qualifications of the one who is to prepare a hymnal, Landstad writes: “An intimate knowledge of hymn literature, poetic vision, and knowledge of language, especially the mother tongue. We must above all demand that our hymns possess the elements of poetic diction and true song. We must consider the historical and churchly elements, and the orthodox objectivity, which shows respect for church tradition and which appreciates the purity, clearness, and force of confession. But the sickly subjectivity, which ‘rests’ in the varying moods of pious feelings and godly longings, and yet does not possess any of the boldness and power of true faith— such as we find in Luther’s and Kingo’s hymns— this type of church hymn must be excluded. Finally, we must also emphasize the aesthetic feature. Art must be made to serve the Church, to glorify the name of God, and to edify the congregation of worshipers. But it must always be remembered that art itself is to be the servant and not the master.” This very scientific and earnest defence gained many friends for Landstad’s work on the hymnal, but it did not, however, win universal sympathy for the new forms of expression which he had introduced into the language of the hymns. During the following years, Landstad thoroughly revised his hymn book. In the course of this work about 30 of the more recent hymns were omitted and an equal number of the older hymns were included. Numerous changes in expression, however, were incorporated. In 1865 the revised work was submitted to a committee consisting of Bishop A. Grimelund, Prof. M. J. Monrad, Prof. R. T. Nissen, the pastor (later bishop) Jørgen Moe, and the associate pastor (later bishop) J. N. Skaar. The committee gave their opinion in 1867, and considered the matter again in 1868. Finally, on October 16, 1869, the book was authorized for use at the public services in all places where the congregations would so decide. By the close of the year 1870 Landstad’s Hymnary had been introduced into 648 of the 923 pastorates in Norway.\n\nOn April 23, 1859, Landstad was appointed to the charge of Sandherred and labored there until 1876, when he sought release from his duties. He was granted a pension of 4,000 crowns. We quote the following estimate written on this occasion: “In consideration of Landstad’s long and honorable service in the ministry, and in recognition of his great merits as a writer of hymns and as editor of the hymn book, we have recommended for him a larger pension than any other pastor hitherto has received. The committee heartily endorses this and recommends: That the proposed pension for M. B. Landstad be granted.” This pension was granted unanimously and without debate by the Storting in 1877. The golden wedding on May 6, 1879, developed into a grand celebration in honor of the aged hymn writer and his estimable wife. Innumerable presents, telegrams, and flowers were showered upon them from all parts of the country, and by all classes of people. Landstad died October 9, 1880, in Christiania.\n\nWe quote the following from Skaar’s Norse History of Hymns: “Landstad’s work in folk-song gave a decidedly Norwegian ring to his hymns, but he did not succeed in liberating himself entirely from his Danish patterns.… His hymns are marked by a popular tone, but they also possess pure warmth and earnestness and a churchly spirit.… In a masterly manner he restored the old hymns. Although his hymns, in poetic flight, cannot rank with Kingo’s, still in depth of feeling, in truth and sobriety of sentiment, in simplicity, in clear and open confession of that which is most precious to the heart of the Christian, in these Landstad’s hymns rank equal to, if not above, the best in the possession of our Church.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nLANDSTAD, Magnus Brostrup (1802-1880), was born in Maaso, Finmarken, Norway, on October 7, 1802, where his father was pastor at the time. His youth was spent in Oknes and Vinje, where the family suffered because of the solitude, storm, darkness, and famine. Landstad received his preparatory training from his father. In 1822 he began his studies at the university, took his maste’rs examination the following year, and began the study of theology. For financial reasons he was obliged to take a position as family tutor in Hadeland to continue his studies at Christiana. After a year Landstad returned to the university and studied under the teachers Hersleb and Stenersen. In December, 1827, he passed the final examination with the grade “Laudabilis.” In November, 1828, he was appointed resident vicar of Gausdal. The following year he married Vilhelmine Lassen, a daughter of Albert Lassen, the dean of Grau in Hadeland. In 1834 Landstad became pastor at Kviteseid and in 1839 succeeded his father as pastor of Seljord. He did not start duties there, however, until 1840, because of an attack of pneumonia. Here he labored for eight trying years. Landstad’s interest in hymn-writing was awakened during his student-days through an accidental purchase of two books, Freuden-Spiegel des ewigen Lebens by Philipp Nicolai (q. v.) and Arrebo’s Hexaemeron, The Glorious and Mighty Works of the Creation Day (q. v.), at an auction sale. His first original hymn was written during his sojourn in Gausdal. During his pastorate in Kviteseid Landstad composed three hymns for the Reformation festival in 1837. At this time he also began to collect folk-songs, a work that had a great influence upon his hymn-writing. Through the hymns which he published he came to the attention of the church officials and was asked to prepare a new hymn-book for the Church of Norway. He declined the offer as his pastorate in Seljord claimed so much of his time. He therefore applied for the pastorate of Fredrikshald and was appointed to it in 1849. An assistant in this pastorate was granted him, and on October 7, 1852, a royal resolution was passed, delegating to Landstad the work of preparing an outline for a new church-book essentially along the lines of his previous plan. In 1861 the long-looked-for Kirke-Salmobog et Udkast appeared. An article in one of the leading newspapers expressed sincere appreciation of the hymnal but also expressed the conviction that the omission of certain hymns, and especially that the form of language employed in the book, would prove a serious handicap in the way of its adoption by the congregations. Landstad gave a very scientific and earnest defense of his work, and while it gained many friends, it did not win universal sympathy for the new forms of expression which he had introduced into the language of the hymns.

His golden wedding anniversary in 1879 developed into a grand celebration in honor of the hymn-writer and his estimable wife. Landstad died in Christiana, October 9, 1880.

In spite of the fact that she is included in almost every collection of hymn-writers biographies in the English language, very little is known about this English woman and her private life, except the dates of her birth in 1807 and death in 1882. She was for years a well-known figure in the Catholic Apostolic Church, contributing to its hymn-book nine hymns and translations. Later in life she entered the Roman communion. Some of her hymns were produced as “prophetical utterances,” supposedly under the prompting of the Holy Spirit, at public services. A former member of the same communion. who heard her produce one such hymn at a service in Bishopsgate Church, records that “it was delivered slowly with short pauses between the verses, a pause three times as long as any one would ordinarily make in reading. I have not known any one with a similar gift; but I have heard of an improvisatore who far surpassed Miss Leeson. She only exercised her gift at long intervals and could choose her own time and her own subject. He improvised very frequently, much more rapidly, and on any subject chosen for him by others.” She possessed rare gifts in writing for children and many such hymns flowed from her prolific pen. Her published collections of children’s hymns date from 1842 with Infant Hymnings and Hymns and Scenes of Childhood; The Child’s Book of Ballads, 1849; Songs of Christian Chivalry, 1848; Paraphrases and Hymns for Congregational Singing, most of which were rewritten from the Scottish Translations and Paraphrases of 1781, in 1853.

Then he resigned his position and entered a secular occupation. There are no further traces of him in the records of Trinity Church.

Having taken eksamen artium and commenced his theological studies, he was appointed to the position of organist in Our Savior’s Church, Christiania. In this work he continued until his death, May 23, 1887. From 1849 and on he also served as professor at the theological seminary. In 1871 he published Koralbog for den norske kirke. Through this work as well as through all his work in general, Lindeman contributed greatly to the cause of good church song among the Norwegian people. It was stated at his funeral that he was the person who had taught the Norwegian people to sing. He certainly gave impetus to congregational singing through his many and varied choral melodies. His melodies are to a large degree original. Some have been recast from older tunes. Lindeman’s hymn tunes breathe a spirit of deep religious fervor, refreshing vigor, and partake of the character of the folk-tune. The latter explains to some extent their popularity (Bishop Dr. A. Chr. Bang). Lindeman’s life and work will be treated more fully in a later section.

In 1865 he was made professor of theology at the Evangelical Lutheran Seminary, Columbus, Ohio, and in 1880 was elected president of Capital University, of which the seminary is one department. For a number of years he served as president of the Ohio Synod. Loy died in 1915. Twenty-one of his original hymns and a like number of his translations have been embodied in The Evangelical Lutheran Hymnal of the Ohio Synod. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nLOY, Matthias (1828-1915), was born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg, on March 17, 1828. He was the fourth of seven children. The mother of the family, who was a Lutheran, gave the children a Christian education. In 1834, when Matthias was six years old, the family moved to Hogestown. When Matthias was fourteen, he was sent as an apprentice to Baab and Hummel, printers of Harrisburg. Here he worked for six years, all the while attending school. Through Mr. Hummel he came to the attention of the Rev. C. W. Schäffer (q. v.), pastor at Harrisburg, who suggested to him the vocation of the Lutheran ministry. Meanwhile he studied Latin and Greek under the tutorship of the principal of the Harrisburg Academy. Later he attended this Academy as a regular student. By this time he had made up his mind to become a minister. He left for Circleville, Ohio, to print a German semimonthly paper for the United Brethren Publishing House. Arriving in Circleville in the autumn of 1847, Loy met the Lutheran minister there, who suggested that he leave immediately for Columbus and there enter the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio. Loy secured a release from his contract with the publishing house, and with the financial assistance of the Lutheran pastor, he left for Columbus. During his student days Loy was a reader of the Lutheraner, edited by C. F. W. Walther. Upon his graduation in 1849 Loy was called to a congregation in Delaware, Ohio. In 1860 he was elected President of the Joint Synod of Ohio and four years later was appointed editor of the Lutheran Standard. Then after sixteen years in the ministry, Loy was called to the professorship of theology at Capital University in March, 1865. In 1878 he resigned as President of the Ohio Synod; he was succeeded by Prof. Wm. F. Lehmann, who had been Vice-president. At this time Loy returned the call to the English professorship of theology at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis. In 1880, when Prof. Lehmann died, Loy succeeded him both as President of the synod (which office he held until 1892) and as President of Capital University. In 1881 Loy started the Columbus Theological Magazine. He also fostered the formation of the Synodical Conference. However, at the Ohio Synod meeting at Wheeling in 1881, the synod withdrew from the Synodical Conference. He wrote the following books: The Doctrine of Justification, 1868; Sermons on the Gospels, 1888; Christian Church, 1896; The Story of My Life, 1905.

When she was six years old, her father died. But her mother, Æmilie Antonia, tenderly cared for bringing her up together with her orphaned relative, Emilie Juliane, who had been adopted into the family. The highest aim of the mother was to instruct them in the Word of God and in the Confessions of the Lutheran Church and otherwise to give them all good and useful training. She secured a pious and learned theologian as their teacher. But Ludämilia’s development was particularly influenced by Ahasverus Fritsch, who later became the tutor of her brother Albert Anton. Fritsch was a highly cultured man, a man of integrity, filled with a living love for the Word of God and the confessions of his church, and a great lover of spiritual song. After the death of her mother, Ludämilia was betrothed, 1672, to her cousin, Christian Wilhelm, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. But she did not become his wife. The following year the district was visited by an epidemic of measles, and Ludämilia’s oldest sister was stricken and died after a short illness. Ludämilia, who had tended her together with one of the younger sisters, was infected by the same disease and died a few weeks later. As soon as she was stricken she went to bed and said: “Here I lay me down in Jesus’ name; may He do unto me according to His good pleasure.” And when she had partaken of Holy Communion, she exclaimed: “My God, come what may, life or death; my will is the will of Jesus; I am a child of God. Nothing, nothing shall separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. God has blessed me now in Holy Communion as before in my Baptism.” And later: “God be praised that I was brought up in the true Christian, Lutheran religion, and that I now do not doubt, but firmly, yea, firmly dare to believe that I by the blood of Jesus am an heir to eternal salvation and that I shall stand before my God in heaven, the moment my body and soul are separated on earth.” During her last night, she was continually praying, and when morning came she sang hymns and prayed: “Lord God, my Father, what Thou hast created; Lord, the Son of God, what Thou hast redeemed; Lord God, the Holy Ghost, what Thou hast sanctified, this I commend into Thy divine hands…\n\nBe near me when I’m dying,\n\nO show Thy cross to me; and to my succor flying,\n\nCome, Lord, and set me free:\n\nThese eyes, new faith receiving,\n\nFrom Jesus shall not move;\n\nFor he who dies believing\n\nDies safely, through Thy love.”\n\n(Landst. 333, 8; Luth. Hym. 315, 8.)\n\nThereupon she bade her loved ones farewell, expressing her joy and delight in the glory which awaited her, and recited John 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” “Father, in Thy hands I commend my spirit!” She expired at noon, March 12, 1672. Ludämilia Elisabeth wrote over 200 hymns. This hymn was translated by H. A. Brorson, and has been called “The principal gem in Elisabeth’s crown of evangelical hymns.” In addition to this hymn, Landstad also has included her popular hymn “Sørg, o kjære Fader, du” (Landst. 525).

In 1665 she went with her mother to the dowager Castle of Friedensburg near Leutenberg; but after her mother’“s death in 1670, she returned to Rudolstadt, where on December 20, 1671, she was formally betrothed to Count Christian Wilhelm of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. At that time measles were raging in that district. Her sister Sophie Juliane was stricken and died February 14, 1672. By attending on her, Ludämilia and her youngest sister, Christiane Magdelene, caught the infection, and both died at Rudolstadt on March 12, 1672. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n379\n\nLundeen, Joel W., b. 1918\n\ntr. 146\n\nLuther, Martin, 1483-1546\n\nMartin Luther (1483-1546), German reformer, was born in Eisleben, the son of Hans and Margarete Ziegler (Lindemann?) Luther. His parents were miners. In 1484 they removed to Mansfeld, where the father became a prominent citizen. The training in the parental home was very strict and the son was kept rigidly at his studies. He received his early education in Mansfeld, Magdeburg, and Eisenach. In 1501 he became a student at Erfurt. His father decided that he should study law, but Luther, suffering from anguish of conscience, entered the Augustinian cloister at Erfurt in 1501. In 1507 he was ordained. While in the cloister he showed great zeal both in acts of penitence and in the study of the Holy Scriptures, which he here learned to know for the first time. But he suffered still from remorse of conscience. For this the vicar-general Staupitz gave him great comfort. Staupitz brought Luther to the attention of Elector Friedrich the Wise, who procured for him a professorship at the university of Wittenberg in 1508.\n\nIn 1511 Luther went on his famous journey to Rome. In 1512 he was created doctor of theology. His religious views began to ripen and take form as he studied the Letter to the Romans, the Psalms, Augustine, Bernhard, and the German mystics. Righteousness by faith now became the central doctrine of his theology.\n\nThen came his public declaration against the selling of indulgences. In the 95 theses, nailed on the church door at Wittenberg, October 31, 1517, he challenged the pope’s authority to remit punishment except that which he had himself ordered. This caused a great sensation; Luther had had the courage to come out openly and express an opinion which already had been nourished by many. The pope tried in vain to silence Luther, first through Cardinal Cajetan (Augsburg, 1518), then through his chamberlain Miltitz (Altenburg, 1519). At the disputation with Eck (Leipzig, 1519) it appeared that Luther’s views on the authority of the pope were entirely different from that held by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn the meantime Luther was supported by his colleagues, especially Melanchthon, by the elector and many of the humanists, as Hutten and Crotus, and by the common people. In 1520 the main Reformation writings appeared: To the Christian Nobility, emphasizing the universal priesthood of all believers; The Babylonian Captivity with its new conception of the sacraments; and Christian Liberty. On January 3, 1520, Luther was placed under the ban of the Church. In 1521 he was cited to appear before the Diet of Worms, where he was asked to retract all his writings. Upon his determined refusal to do this (April 18), he was declared (May 25) also under the ban of the empire. The elector had, however, prepared a place of safety for Luther at Wartburg, where he found time and peace to translate the Bible for his people. March 7, 1522, the fanaticism of Carlstadt drew him again to Wittenberg. He now began to organize the work of the church and the order of service. During this period he also wrote many of his powerful hymns.\n\nIn the following year the humanists (Erasmus), the fanaticists (Carlstadt, Münzer), and the peasants (Peasants’ War, 1524-1525) deserted the cause of Luther. Through his action during the war Luther strengthened the position of the rulers. On June 15, 1525, he married a former nun, Katharina von Bora. During the following year he visited the congregations in Saxony, for whom he wrote the Small Catechism. During the years 1526-1530 there arose the controversy with the Swiss reformers, especially with Zwingli, who so far disagreed with the Lutherans on the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper that Luther at the conference at Marburg, 1529, declared openly, “Ye are of a different spirit from us.” During the Diet of Augsburg, 1530, Luther followed the proceedings from his retreat at Coburg. Thus it came to pass that, while the Augsburg Confession contains the fundamental ideas of Luther, it was given its form under the painstaking hand of Melanchthon.\n\nLuther’s polemics did not grow milder as he ripened in years. Even in 1545 he wrote about the Papacy at Rome, Founded by the Devil. His many letters to his wife and children prove that his domestic life was very happy. During his later years he grieved over the fact that the Gospel of Christ bore so little fruit.\n\nHis Table Talks show him to have been a prince of entertainers, both along the line of mirth and in serious conversation. Death overtook him upon a journey which he made in an attempt to reconcile the counts of Mansfeld. He died in his home town of Eisleben. He was buried in the castle church of Wittenberg.\n\nLuther was a spiritual giant, great in the fearless fight which he waged, and great in true conservatism. Personally he was the incarnation of the strength of the German people. He was a master of language, both written and spoken. His translation of the Bible alone would have established his fame. He was exceptionally earnest and sincere. The desire of his heart caused him to enter the cloister; but the constant faith of his heart led him forth again from the cloister into active life, and this experience of his heart, based upon the testimony of Scripture, he made the firm foundation upon which he took his stand in defiance of all human onslaughts. His strong realistic tendency might at times verge on coarseness, but we see in it simply a frank protest against vain sentimentalism, against affectedness and vacillation. The quadri-centennial of Luther’s birth was celebrated in 1883 by Lutheran churches over the whole world.\n\nLUTHER’S HYMNS\n\nORIGINAL\n\n1. Eines neues Lied wir heben an.\n\n2.

In the foregoing list, prepared by a Lutheran hymnologist, only four hymns are mentioned as original with Luther. In reality many more deserve to be listed as original, when we consider how the spirit of Luther has adapted and arranged the material of many hymns and impressed the stamp of his personality upon them. The best church hymns as well as our sermons are associated with passages from the Holy Scriptures. But just the same the hymn or sermon may be original to an eminent degree and at the same time be truly Biblical. “A mighty fortress is our God,” is based upon the 46th Psalm, but employs very few of the words or expressions of the Scripture text. Yet this hymn must surely be said to be both Biblical and at the same time be Luther’s own, original, and characteristic poetry. James Mearns has listed the following as original with Luther:\n\nChrist lag in Todesbanden (partly based on an older Easter hymn).\n\nChrist unser Herr zum Jordan kam (based on Mark 1 :9-11).\n\nEin neues Lied wir heben an.\n\nErhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort.\n\nJesus Christus, unser Heiland, der den Tod.\n\nNun freut euch, lieben Christen g’mein.\n\nVom Himmel hoch da kam ich her (Luke 2 :10-16).\n\nVom Himmel kam "
