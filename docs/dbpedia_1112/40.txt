The Show

Take a trip back to the 80s. An era of frizzy perms and shoulder pads, tax deductible lunches, CDs and music that shaped a generation.

The Absolutely 80s show was born 11 years ago, featuring much loved Aussie pop icons performing their massive hits from the 80s and creating hours of epic flashbacks.

The Absolutely 80s show doesn’t just focus on the hits of our singers, but mixes it up with a wide range of famous songs from the 80s. This approach - along with the outstanding showmanship of our stars - makes for all-round, broader entertainment appeal. In the 80s, each of our acts sold hundreds of thousands of records, Australia wide and internationally, also holding house attendance records in many venues.

You’ll still see some of our stars making regular appearances on TV (AFL Grand Final, Footy Show, Spicks & Specks, Rock Wiz, The Morning Show & Sunrise). We have a loyal fan base of 35,000 people across Australia, who follow us on social media and via our newsletters, where we promote our tours.

Ticketed shows are usually 2 x 50 minute sets in duration plus encores. However, we can cater for any time or length for functions and corporate events. Each show comprises a mix of artists (see following pages for information on our performers) and we can work with you on a specific line-up, depending on availability. Or we can give you our recommendation to suit your audience and needs.

The teenagers of the 80s are today’s 45 - 55 year olds, enjoying the 80s revival and looking for entertainment that they know and love. We’re currently on the circuit performing shows all around the country, at corporate and private functions, casinos, nightclubs, big beer barns and more. Our fan base and audiences keeps growing - people just can’t get enough of the Absolutely 80s Show!
