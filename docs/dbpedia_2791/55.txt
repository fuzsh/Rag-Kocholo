Alejandro Jodorowskyâ€™s follow-up to El Topo is a riot of mystic and religious imagery underlining its vision of a spiritual quest towards enlightenment.

An austere figure known as The Alchemist (Jodorowsky), holed up in a sheer-faced tower, brings together a diverse group of disciples from every culture and corner of the galaxy to embark with him on a journey to the Holy Mountain, where together they will try to unseat the immortal beings who secretly rule the universe.
