        "meta_description": "the comics of Jodorowsky by IndyPL_RickD - a staff-created list : Alejandro Jodorowsky is a French-Chilean filmmaker, playwright, poet, mime, clown, magician, atheist mystic, and comic book author. He was part of the panic movement of the 1960's. His first movie, Fando y Lis premiered in Acapulco. When it started a riot, the film was banned in Mexico. He is also famous for having a very ambitious plan for making a \"Dune\" movie, that could not meet funding.\n\n His other movies like \"El Topo\" and \"Holy Mountain\" gained cult followings and were associated with midnight movies. Throughout the decades his work, and opinions have upset many people.  Even with his controversy he has fans ranging from John Lennon, to Marilyn Manson, to Kanye West \n\nI can confidently say, Jodorowsky is not for me. \n\nSometimes I think he is inspired, other times I think he is overrated. Sometimes I am impressed with his ideas. Other times, it feels like exploitation, and make me nauseous. I can picture him telling me that he didn't make his comics to make me happy, he made his comics to send a message. I was reluctant to make a list of his comics, but his work has too big of an impact to ignore. #IndyPLAdults",

Anyone who has seen it, can expect weirdness, religious imagery, shameless sacrilege, and mysticism. The titular El Topo has been killed, around his grave there are seven golden pillars and a garden. The grave is on a plateau over an acid moat where the only way to get across is on floating rocks. If El Topo finds you unworthy, you fall below. One of the visitors is his son, Abel, who is invisible to the world. Show less\n\nA fictional account of the first mafia dynasty.

The dark lord Tartarath has taken the king. The kings twin children, must go on a quest to save their father with their flying guardian, Lyrena. One rule is that they must not ride Lyrena like a horse, but there are loopholes such as she can catch them to break their fall or walking across her back to get across a chasm. Then ending felt anticlimactic. I feel like Jodorowsky was trying to get out of his comfort zone and be different, although you can tell its his work.
