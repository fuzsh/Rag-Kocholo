        "text": "'L'Incal' and 'La Caste des Méta-Barons'.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (also written as Alexandro Jodorowsky) is a Chilean film director, best known for his surreal cult movies 'El Topo' (1970) and 'The Holy Mountain' (1973). They made him one of the icons of 1970s counterculture cinema and launched the 'midnight movie' phenomenon. Jodorowsky was active in many artistic disciplines, including poetry, novels, plays, music, mime, painting, sculpting, puppeteering and... comics. His weekly comic 'Fabulas Panicas' (1967-1973) ran in El Heraldo de Mexico. However, Jodorowsky was more prominent as a comic writer than an artist. He collaborated with various European and Latin American artists on realistically-drawn adult series. Recurring themes in his work are mysticism, symbolism and hallucinogenic experiences, inspired by alchemy, tarot, Zen Buddhism, shamanism and drugs.\n\nEarly life\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky was born in 1929 in Iquique, Chile, as the son of Jewish-Ukrainian immigrants. Following an unhappy childhood, he found refuge in poetry, and began his professional life in several creative occupations. He started as a clown in a circus, and eventually focused on performing as a mime. He had his own theatre group, the Teatro Mimico, and wrote his first play in 1953. Jodorowsky spent most of the 1950s in Paris, where he toured within the mime troupe of famous artist Marcel Marceau. In February 1962, he became co-founder of the innovative \"Mouvement Panique\" (\"Panic Mouvement\"), along with Fernando Arrabal, Olivier O. Olivier, Jacques Sternberg, Christian Zeimert, Abel Ogier and Roland Topor. The collective focused on absurd and bewildering plays to reject the commercialisation of surrealism. They staged many provocative and bizarre plays throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, before Jodorowsky dissolved the Panic Movement in 1973.\n\n'Fabulas Panicas', drawn by Alexandro Jodorowsky.\n\nEarly comics\n\nIn the 1960s, Jodorowsky settled in Mexico City, where he created his first comic book work. He debuted in 1966 as the writer of the futuristic saga 'Anibal 5', drawn by Manuel Moro for Editorial Novaro. He in turn also drew his own comics, such as the weekly 'Fabulas Panicas' (1967-1973) feature in the Mexican magazine El Heraldo de Mexico.\n\nEarly film career\n\nDuring his stay in Paris in the 1950s, Jodorowsky made his first film, 'Les Têtes Interverties' (also known as 'La Cravate', 1957), based on Thomas Mann's novel 'Die vertauschten Köpfe' (1940). The short was made entirely in pantomime and featured Jodorowsky and Belgian-French comedian Raymond Devos in starring roles. Inspired by Federico Fellini, Antonin Artaud and Luis Buñuel, Jodorowsky shot various psychedelic and highly controversial pictures in Mexico, France and the UK. The picture 'Fando y Lis' (1967), based on a play by Fernando Arrabal, made his reputation. It sparked riots during the premier, because viewers felt several scenes were shocking. Jodorowsky had to escape the theater by sneaking into a limousine. However, protesters recognized him and threw rocks at the car. As usual, the scandal attracted more attention to this avant-garde film than possibly would've been the case otherwise. Riots kept erupting during screenings and between 1968 and 1972 the movie was banned in Mexico. In the United Kingdom it was released under a different title: 'Tar Babies'. Jodorowsky was nearly deported from his home country.\n\nEl Topo\n\nJodorowsky's next film, 'El Topo' (1970), was equally outrageous. Described as an \"acid western\" the picture follows a very loose plot thread. A cowboy dressed in black (played by Jodorowsky himself) roams through the desert. He encounters many bizarre people and experiences surreal and shocking events. Predictably the film was a huge flop with mainstream audiences. But theatre owners noticed that certain young adults liked it. Its subversive, erotic, violent and blasphemous tone fit perfectly within the counterculture movement. Since it was made by an independent filmmaker, it was as anti-Hollywood as you could get. The mystic and occult themes mirrored young viewers own search for the inner self. Above all, the trippy images made it a perfect stoner movie. Theatre owners therefore decided to market 'El Topo' in a different, unprecedented way. Each screening took place at midnight, giving the film a more mysterious appeal. Numerous curious teenagers and other young adults gathered together. They felt united in their bizarre taste, with some even dressing up for it. It helped 'El Topo' build up a cult audience and launched the \"midnight movie\" phenomenon. Soon many film theaters started programming unusual movies at 12 o'clock at night, like 'The Harder They Come' (1973), 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (1975), 'Eraserhead' (1978) and many more. Several films who didn't do well on their initial release, now found an audience. Devoted fans kept coming back for repeat viewings.\n\n'El Topo' attracted celebrity fans like rock musicians John Lennon, George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Roger Waters and actors Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda. In later decades, musicians Peter Gabriel, Marilyn Manson, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-Lópza (The Mars Volta) also expressed admiration. Directors like David Lynch, Nicolas Winding Refn and Samuel Fuller were all influenced by it. Lennon even made an attempt to screen 'El Topo' in bigger theaters, to boost its fame and success. Predictably, it only lasted a week, before the film was screened in midnight movie theaters again.\n\n'El Topo' established Jodorowsky's reputation, especially since the film wasn't commercially available on home video for decades. Anyone who wanted to see it had to find a movie theater who played it. In the 1980s, a few laser disc versions were released in Japan, but with several scenes censored. It took until 2007 before 'El Topo' received an official, uncensored DVD release. Jodorowsky always wanted to create a sequel to 'El Topo' and at one point considered shock rock musician Marilyn Manson for the starring role. Unfortunately the project remained in development hell. In 2016 Jodorowsky adapted his script into a comic book, 'Les Fils d'El Tope' ('Sons Of El Topo', 2016), illustrated by José Ladronn.\n\nLater film career\n\nThroughout his career, Jodorowsky created other polarizing films, such as the mystical and mind-boggling 'The Holy Mountain' (1973), which was partially funded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The loose plot follows a thief and his seven spiritual advisors who want to climb a holy mountain in search of spiritual enlightment. The thief is guided by an alchemist, played by Jodorowsky himself. With a slightly higher budget and more satirical themes, 'The Holy Mountain' became his second best-known film and also a cult classic. The 1980s brought forth 'Poo Lorn L'Elephant' ('translated in English as Tusk', 1980) and the cult horror film 'Santa Sangre' (1989). In 1990, Jodorowsky directed 'The Rainbow Thief' (1990), which could afford stars like Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Christopher Lee, but disappointed long-time fans by being more conventional in tone. It took two decades before Jodorowsky had enough money to create new films. 'La Danza de la Realidad' ('The Dance of Reality', 2013) and 'Poesía Sin Fin' ('Endless Poetry', 2016) marked a return to his old form and received good reviews.\n\nBook covers for 'Anibal 5' and 'Les Yeux du Chat'.\n\nCollaboration with Moebius\n\nIn the 1970s Jodorowsky also made his mark as a comic author, particularly through his collaborations with widely admired French comic artist Moebius. They met in 1976, when Jodorowsky tried to adapt Frank Herbert's epic sci-fi novel 'Dune'into a movie. H.R. Giger, Chris Foss and Moebius designed sets and characters, Dan O'Bannon provided special effects and David Carradine, Mick Jagger, Gloria Swanson, Salvador Dalí, Amanda Lear and Orson Welles would play major roles. The soundtrack would be composed by Pink Floyd and Magma. This ultimate geek's wet dream was however never realized. Most of the budget was spent on pre-production. In 1984, the picture was eventually directed by David Lynch, but with different contributors. Over the years, Jodorowsky's version of 'Dune' acquired a mythical status, tingling many people's imagination of what this film could've been had it been released. In 2013, a documentary, 'Jodorowsky's Dune', was made, bringing many previously unseen storyboards and photographs to the forefront.\n\nJodorowsky and Moebius continued their collaboration with the comic series 'Les Yeux du Chat' (1978) at Les Humanoïdes Associés. They created a comics classic with 'The Incal', in which Jodorowsky introduced his own science fiction universe, later referred to as the \"Jodoverse\". The saga focuses on the P.I. John Difool, who receives the Light Incal, a crystal of enormous powers. After a first serialization in Métal Hurlant magazine, Les Humanoïdes Associés published six books under the title 'Une Aventure de John Difool' in the 1980s. John Difool's early years were later explored in 'Avant l'Incal', a prequel series that Jodorowsky made with artist Zoran Janjetov between 1988 and 1995. A sequel cycle called 'Après L'Incal' was started by Jodorowsky and Moebius in 2000, and completed by two more installments drawn by José Ladrönn in 2011 and 2014. Ladrönn also provided the artwork for the final cycle, 'Final Incal' (2008-2014).\n\nBook covers for 'John Difool' and 'Castaka'.\n\nOther comics\n\nAnother famous creation set in Jodorowsky's space opera universe is 'The Saga of the Meta-Barons', about a dynasty of perfect warriors. Drawn by Argentinian artist Juan Giménez, the series was published in eight books by Les Humanoïdes Associés between 1992 and 2003. Two more cycles followed to complete the trilogy: two books of 'Castaka' were drawn by Das Pastoras in 2007 and 2013, while Travis Charest and Zoran Janjetov provided the art for 'Weapons of the Metabaron' in 2008. In addition, Jodorowsky and Janjetov, accompanied by colorist Fred Beltrán, cooperated on yet another sci-fi cycle, 'The Technopriests' ('Les Technopères') from 1998 to 2006.\n\nBook covers for 'Les Technopères' and 'Alef-Thau'.\n\nIn 1982, Jodorowsky had teamed up with artist Arno to create the magical fantasy series 'Alef-Thau'. The duo made seven albums, while a final installment was drawn by Al Covial in 1998. Remaining in the fantasy genre, he wrote 'Le Dieu Jaloux' (1984) and 'L'Ange Carnivore' (1986) for Silvio Cadelo, two books that were later reprinted under the title 'La Saga d'Alendor'. Jodorowsky has worked on several projects with the artist Georges Bess, starting with 'Les Jumeaux Magiques' in Le Journal de Mickey in 1986, and then followed by the fantasy series 'The White Lama' ('Le Lama Blanc', 1988-1993), the graphic novel 'Juan Solo' (1995-1999), and a restart of 'Anibal 5' (1990-1992). Jodorowsky and Bess have returned to Tibet for an esoteric follow-up to their best-known collaboration, called 'La Légende du Lama Blanc' from 2014.\n\nCovers for the series 'Le Lama Blanc' and 'Bouncer'.\n\nFrom 1991 on, Jodorowsky started several stories serialized in magazine À Suivre, such as 'Face de Lune' (with François Boucq) 'La Passion de Diosamante' (with Jean-Claude Gal) and 'Le Coeur Couronné (with Moebius). Other notable creations are the hard-boiled western series 'Bouncer', made with François Boucq at Glénat since 2001, and the historical fiction series 'Borgia' in cooperation with Milo Manara from 2004 to 2010. Jodorowsky made a graphic novel about a mime player during World War II, 'Pietrolino' (2007-2008), drawn by Olivier Boiscommun, and a comic book sequel to his 1970 film called 'Les Fils d'El Tope' with José Ladrönn in 2016.\n\nBook covers for 'Pietrolino' and 'Borgia'.\n\nFurther collaborations include 'La Vérité est au Fond des Rêves' with Jean-Jacques Chaubin, the detective comic 'Gilles Hamesh' with Michel Durand (1995), 'Aliot' with Victor de la Fuente (1996), the historical 'Le Pape Terrible' with Théo Caneschi (2009-2013), the heroic fantasy 'Sang Royal' with Dongzi Liu (since 2010) and more sci-fi series like 'Megalex' with Fred Beltrán (1999-2008), 'Showman Killer' with Nicolas Fructus (2010-2012) and 'Ogregod' with Zoran Janjetov (2010-2012).\n\nRecognition\n\nBack in France since 1990, Alejandro Jodorowsky was named an Officer in the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettes in 2005. In that same year an asteroid was named after him."
