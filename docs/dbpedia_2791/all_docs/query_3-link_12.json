        "text": "BOOM! Studios’s Archaia imprint (via The Beat) have announced an English translation of “The Sons of El Topo” (originally published in French by Glénat) from acclaimed surrealist director Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Eisner Award-winning artist Jose Ladronn. “The Sons of El Topo” is a sequel to Jodorowsky’s breakthrough 1970 film El Topo (or The Mole). The controversial cult classic helped to cement Jodorowsky’s reputation as one of the great experimental/avant garde directors of the 20th century.\n\nArchaia is characterizing the “The Sons of El Topo” as a direct sequel to the film. According to their official press release:\n\n“’THE SONS OF EL TOPO VOLUME ONE: CAIN’ continues the surrealist western story you know from the film, digging deeper into the philosophical and spiritual questions of El Topo’s journey – along with the incredible visual experience you’d expect from master artist like Ladrönn.”\n\nJodorowsky has had a long career in comics, beginning with the “Anibal 5” comic from 1966. Notably he also collaborated with celebrated French artist Moebius for “The Incal” (which would become the subject of a lawsuit against Luc Besson, who allegedly stole elements of the comic for his film The Fifth Element).\n\nLadronn has also had a long and respected career in comics, including artistic stints for Marvel’s “Incredible Hulk” and DC’s “OMAC Project.” In 2006 Ladronn won the Eisner Award for his work on “Hip Flask: Mystery City.”\n\nJodorowsky and Ladronn’s “The Sons of El Topo Volume One: Cain” will be hitting the stores in December 2018. More details on “The Sons of El Topo” will come when they are made available."
