El Topo (the mole) claims to be God, while dressed as a gunfighter in black, riding a horse through a spiritual, mystical landscape strewn with old Western movie, and ancient Eastern religious symbols. Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his. El Topo's surreal way is bloody, sexual and self-reflective, musing of his own demons, as he tries to vanquish those he encounters.",

        "text": "The New York Times contacted me today for background about my review of El Topo that was published in the L.A. Free Press on April 23, 1971. They provided me with a scan of the article, and I'm reposting it here. Maybe 43 years later its verbiage is a little embarrassing; but I stand by what I wrote back then. How often do we get an opportunity to view what we thought about films through the prism of the far past experience? Let this be a lesson for all you younger reviewers on letterboxd...chances are in the far future you might be confronted with your writings, since nothing on the internet is truly ephemeral...just the way that nothing in print…\n\nErm...I'm going to put down in this review what I thought of this film as I was watching it, and see what I come out with:\n\nNice scenery.\n\nIn Western times, being 7 years old was considered to be the age at which you become a man?\n\nRepetitive credits.\n\nMassacre, massacre, massacre, massacre.\n\nDisembowled donkeys.\n\nHe actually made his 7 year old son conduct a mercy killing. He's the world's worst dad.\n\nYep, shooting shoes.\n\nYep, slicing bananas.\n\nYep, making a naked woman out of seeds, then eating it.\n\nLaughing.\n\nBalloons were invented in Western times?\n\nBang bang, splat splat.\n\nOK, how can he still walk after being shot with a high-powered rifle in both knees?\n\nMassacre.\n\nLaughing.\n\nJust casually…\n\n“El Topo” is a collage of images plastered with sticky blood to a wall. But every time you think you’re just about to get a good hard look at it - the pictures shuffle around, and the search for meaning begins again.\n\nIt’s immediately clear in watching “El Topo” why the film has one of the most respectable fan rosters a piece of art could hope for. Creative icons from David Lynch to Bob Dylan have expressed admiration for Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Acid Western. For the type of person that imbues meaning into every object, a quest into each task — “El Topo” must be a sacred tome.\n\nThere is symbolism, and then there is -symbolism-. “El Topo” is like a…"
