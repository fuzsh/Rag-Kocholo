        "text": "Taika Waititi obviously doesn’t need sleep. That or we have a Multiplicity situation on our hands. Between writing, acting, directing, and producing, the man is relentless. Now, despite already having an overloaded slate of projects, he’s taking on yet another. And it’s a big one. Waititi will write and direct a movie adaptation of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Mœbius’s best selling sci-fi graphic novel The Incal.\n\nHumanoids Publishing has announced (in news we first heard at Variety) it has tapped Waititi to bring Jodorowsky’s seminal comic book to life. Jemaine Clement will also partner on the project, co-writing with Waititi. The pair have previously worked together on What We Do in the Shadows and Flight of the Conchords. Peter Warren will also join them as co-writer.\n\nThe graphic novel follows “the tribulations of the shabby detective John Difool as he searches for the precious and coveted Incal.” Here’s the series’ official synopsis from Humanoids:\n\n“John Difool, a low-class detective in a degenerate dystopian world, finds his life turned upside down when he discovers an ancient, mystical artifact called ‘The Incal.’ Difool’s adventures will bring him into conflict with the galaxy’s greatest warrior, the Metabaron, and will pit him against the awesome powers of the Technopope. These encounters and many more make up a tale of comic and cosmic proportions that has Difool fighting for not only his very survival, but also the survival of the entire universe.”\n\nThe series also marked the beginning of Jodorowsky’s “Jodoverse.” Fans disappointed he won’t be directing the film himself need not worry. Jodorowsky gave Waititi his full endorsement. At 92, he says he’s not capable of directing a movie of this magnitude. (Though he would have been very upset if it had been given to someone else years ago.)\n\nPrimer Entertainment will produce with Humanoids. The movie marks the publishing company’s first-ever film. It’s a big first swing. But between the source material, the man who wrote it, and the man who will lead the adaptation, they might hit a home run.\n\nWe only have one real question about the project. Which of the 17 Taika Waititi clones working in Hollywood will actually be behind the camera?"
