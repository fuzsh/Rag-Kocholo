        "text": "September 12, 2023\n\nThe final chapter in the Sons of El Topo saga. Again, as the first two parts before, Jorodowsky makes a heavy use of mystic Christian symbols and images to conclude the story started in Cain. I really like how Jorodowsky created a modern story of alchemical transformation from Nigredo (the darkest and heaviest matter) to Rubedo (the reconciliation of opposites and transformation into gold), all of this masterfully woven in a western of epic proportions. Also, as the previous chapters, the art by José Ladrönn is breathtaking, from the grossest and gory details to the beautiful and sublime\n\nAugust 25, 2024\n\nIt took a while for Jodorowsky and Ladrönn to complete The Sons of El Topo, but the conclusion was fairly well done. Infused with the biblical themes set from the very beginning, the story follows the lives of Cain and Abel, the two surviving sons of the mythical gunman known as El Topo. Years since his death has only solidified the legend of El Topo, who has now attained sainthood to a level that embodies cult worship across the desert communities. A prophecy uttered by El Topo stipulated that his elder son Cain would be the source of evil and that he would be destined to kill his brother Abel. Cain, vengeful towards his father, struggled with his impulses over the first two volumes and questioned his own destiny. But self-fulfilling prophecies is the common theme here, and the story of Cain and Abel might as well have been etched in stone.\n\nA bloody and fitting conclusion to Jodorowsky's Sons of El Topo series, which embodies a big chunk of the spirit of the original movie. It's not nearly at the same level in terms of surrealism, but there are bizarre elements aplenty and tons of gratuitous scenes to be found. Fans of El Topo will find this series to be a good supplementary story. The artwork by José Ladrönn also remains a huge selling point for the series, as Ladrönn does a great job cultivating a cinematic aesthetic for the story."
