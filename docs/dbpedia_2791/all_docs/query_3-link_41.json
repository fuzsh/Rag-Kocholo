        "text": "Alejandro Jodorowsky has enjoyed something of a career renaissance in cinema lately, mostly thanks to the Jodorowsky’s Dune documentary that related how his attempt to film Dune went totally off the rails. After becoming a cult figure in the 1970s, Jodorowsky’s career hit a speed bump after his Dune project collapsed, and he had dropped out of directing entirely from 1990 to 2015, but since then he has made three new films, each with a hefty dose of autobiography.\n\nFor a long time his work was difficult to get – especially El Topo and The Holy Mountain, the two 1970s works which really put him on the map and got him attached to the Dune project in the first place. Arrow Video have now stepped in and produced a boxed set of blu-rays providing a useful cross-section of his work: his debut feature Fando y Lis, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, and his latest release – Psychomagic, a documentary about his homebrewed style of art therapy that he has been practicing in recent years.\n\nI’m going to be honest: over the course of watching these movies I have come to seriously dislike Jodorowsky and his work. He clearly takes a lot of inspiration from the Surrealists, but I think he increasingly uses the tools of Surrealism for the sake of shameless self-promotion and creating this Messianic aura around himself. In addition, in relation to El Topo in particular there is furious controversy around his claim that he actually raped one of the participants in the film. I will cover that in more detail when we get to that, so consider this a content warning.\n\nFando y Lis\n\nThe Final War has come and gone and all the cities are in ruins. Well, maybe not all. When he was young, Fando (Sergio Kleiner, or Vincente Moore when appearing as a child) learned of the hidden city of Tar from his father (Rafael Corkidi). If he could just find Tar, he’d have eternal happiness – and his lover, Lis (Diana Mariscal, or Elizabeth Moore when shown as a child), would both have eternal happiness and be cured of her paraplegia.\n\nSo off they trek across the blasted wasteland, Lis sat on a trolley as Fando totes her along. As they go, they have various encounters – real or imagined – with various figures of a largely symbolic or metaphorical nature, and bit by bit we as audience members find more and more reason to worry about the duo’s relationship. It doesn’t seem as idyllic and healthy as it seemed to at the start of their quest. Fando keeps wandering off – despite the fact that this almost never ends well for him – and increasingly gaslights and lies to Lis. Eventually he does something barbaric and irreversible. Maybe there really is a city of Tar out there – but will it take in someone who’s been as senselessly cruel as Fando?\n\nFando y Lis is essentially a mashup of Surrealism and Freudianism, two great inter-war tastes that taste great together. Stylistically, the movie is shot in somewhat old-fashioned high-contrast black and white, giving a look which was already a bit archaic in 1968 and which prompts thoughts of Luis Buñuel’s work. Jodorowsky wasn’t just being random when he wanted to cast Salvador Dalí as the Emperor in Dune; he was being random and also being a huge fanboy of the original Surrealists.\n\nMost of it is to be understood metaphorically, the metaphors are sometimes pretty obvious, sometimes not; Jodorowsky is able to cut away from some sinister stage performers forcing the child Lis down onto the floor to a cut of people crushing eggs in their hands, thereby viscerally and disturbingly implying an instance of child sexual abuse without actually depicting anything which it would have been alarming for the kid in question to film. Likewise, when a ragged individual in priestly garb muttering nonsense to himself turns up, it’s not hard to figure out that a jab is being taken at organised religion. That said, other aspects of the movie demand more interpretation and conjecture by the viewer, like the burning piano or the bizarre succession of piglets that appear on Lis’ trolley.\n\nOn the psychological side of things, the movie is largely an exploration of a very, very codependent relationship – there’s a sequence, for instance, where Fando and Lis paint their name all over each others’ bodies, then all over the walls of their room, and then just chuck paint everywhere. Interestingly, Lis seems entirely untroubled by her legs in this sequence, which seems to be part of a number of flashbacks to a life lived prior to the journey; this sets up the troubling question of how Lis lost the use of her legs. Was there an illness, an accident, or some act of violence? And if the latter, who did it? Fando would seem to be the prime suspect, but overall it is not addressed, leaving us to ponder our suspicions.\n\nIn addition, the movie is an examination of how Freudian drives sabotage Fando, like I said, has a tendency to wander off; when he wanders off it usually involves some sort of psychosexual event happening, and each one of these which happen increasingly prominently involve his father and mother (María Teresa Rivas), and the more of these happen the more dysfunctional his interaction with Lis becomes. In essence he starts off with a clean slate and then gets a psychological backstory filled in by these incidents, by the end of which he’s behaving entirely horribly.\n\nNot all of the treatments of sexuality in the movie are necessarily malign, mind. There’s one instance where Fando and Lis together (for once) have the same encounter: a run-in with a troupe of drag performers, who cajole them into some cross-dressing play which ends up with Fando dressed as a woman and Lis dressed in Fando’s trousers and jacket, and then they make out a bit before they burst out laughing when the illusion collapses. After everything we’ve seen previously (and in light of everything we see subsequently) you keep waiting for something terrible to happen, but actually the experience seems essentially positive for the two, but they treat it as a joke and take it no further; the gendered interaction between them, with Lis passively dragged around (at points literally) by Fando, returns in force.\n\nFando y Lis apparently caused a riot at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, which in some respects honours a time-honoured Surrealist tradition; Buñuel’s L’Age d’Or gained enough of a violent reaction from the French League of Patriots to get banned back in 1930. Its interest in finding interesting artistic ways of depicting psychological drives, and its Freudian underpinnings, stand as clear evidence that the seeds to Jodorowsky’s Psychomagic were sown very early in his work. At the same time, it feels like it doesn’t radically expand the vocabulary or techniques of Surrealist film beyond Buñuel. It is an intriguing prelude to Jodorowsky’s work, but without his more famous works after it, it would be of much less interest. It’s worth a watch, but doesn’t quite seem worthy of lots of repeated viewings to plumb the depths of its symbolism.\n\nEl Topo\n\nOut of the desert comes El Topo (Jodorowsky), riding a horse with his naked-but-for-a-hat son, called only Hijo (Brontis Jodorowsky). After encountering a town put to the slaughter, El Topo brings brutal justice to the bandits responsible, and leaves Hijo behind with the Franciscans – replacing him on his journey with Mara (Mara Lorenzio), who has become infatuated with him. El Topo then undertakes a desert journey to seek four gunfighters, each of whom seems to epitomise a different type of occult or mystical philsophy, and cheats his way to victory against them all; shaken by the experience, he is gunned down by Mara and a mysterious female gunslinger (Paula Romo) who has usurped him in Mara’s affections.\n\nDecades later, El Topo returns to consciousness deep underground; he has become an idol worshipped by a community of people with various physical disabilities and challenges, who have been cast down into the cave and are unable to climb to the exit due to their conditions. El Topo resolves to go out into the world, beg for his keep, and spend his time digging a tunnel which will allow the people trapped in the cave to escape.\n\nFalling in love with a woman with dwarfism (Jacqueline Luis) who he’d carried into the outside world and who assisted him with this process, when the duo choose to be married the monk they seek a blessing from proves to be Hijo himself (now played by Robert John). Hijo is torn between wanting revenge on El Topo, but also has some sympathy for what he’s doing, and has become disillusioned with the town, which is dominated by a cult dedicated to slavery, greed, self-indulgence, vice hidden under a hypocritical veneer of propriety, and guns. When the townsfolk violently reject the emerging outcasts, the stage is set for El Topo to take up gunslinging one last time.\n\nThe archetypal acid Western and the movie that put Jodorowsky on the map, El Topo has in more recent years become a millstone about his neck. It is irresponsible to offer any critical appraisal of it without noting that, in the process of doing publicity about the film, he claimed that in the scene where El Topo abruptly tears off Mara’s dress and rapes her (imparting her with the ability to survive in the desert by discovering eggs hidden in the sand and making water spring from a stone), he actually did rape her. In more recent years – when events like museum exhibitions about his work were cancelled over the comments – he’s tried to go back on that and claim he was just bullshitting for publicity’s sake.\n\nI’m going to give his here, since I think it’s important that any discussion of this matter in particular reflect what Jodorowsky actually said, rather than what is reported second hand, and because it provides important context:\n\nWhen I wanted to do the rape scene, I explained to her that I was going to hit her and rape her. There was no emotional relationship between us, because I had put a clause in all the women’s contracts stating that they would not make love with the director. We had never talked to each other. I knew nothing about her. We went to the desert with two other people: the photographer and a technician. No one else. I said, “I’m not going to rehearse. There will be only one take because it will be impossible to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to.” Then I told her, “Pain does not hurt. Hit me.” And she hit me. I said, “Harder.” And she started to hit me very hard, hard enough to break a rib… I ached for a week. After she had hit me long enough and hard enough to tire her, I said, “Now it’s my turn. Roll the cameras.” And I really… I really… I really raped her. And she screamed. Then she told me that she had been raped before. You see, for me the character is frigid until El Topo rapes her. And she has an orgasm. That’s why I show a stone phallus in that scene… which spouts water. She has an orgasm. She accepts male sex. And that’s what happened to Mara in reality. She really had that problem. Fantastic scene. A very, very strong scene.\n\nNow, it’s important to note that we only have Jodorowsky’s side of that story; he lost contact with Mara Lorenzio after the production, and so far as I can tell nobody has been able to track her down and get her input on the matter.\n\nSo it’s rather amazing, in a way, that in addition to the absolutely appalling thing Jodorowsky has claimed to have done in filming this scene, that this quote also reveals him to be an absolute and total bullshit artist on multiple levels. Quite simply, a lot of the quote is simply nonsense; let me count the ways.\n\nFirstly, we never actually see El Topo raping Mara. We see him ripping her dress off and pushing her to the floor; we see a cut to her floating in a pool; we see a cut to her to lying in the desert sand, screaming, a close cut on her face. There are substantially more intimate sex scenes between them later on in the film; I don’t think there’s any reason to think that Jodorowsky was going to be coy about any aspect of the movie, given the extent of the violence and sexuality depicted in it. As it stands, if Jodorowsky is telling the truth, then he did this dreadful thing to shoot material which, so far as I can tell, was more or less entirely removed from the movie aside from the close-up shot of the scream. (The shot in which El Topo rips off Mara’s dress really doesn’t seem to be following immediately on from her punching him until she breaks one of his ribs.)\n\nThe above being the case, he is asking us to believe that he shot more material of the rape, then thought better of including it, then admitted to it anyway. If he is telling the truth, he is not just a rapist and a bully – he’s a rapist, a bully, and a complete and total fuckwit. Someone who was concerned about getting in trouble for raping their actress would have removed the rape from the movie completely, and never mention the rape. Someone who was not concerned about getting in trouble, and had shown us the other sexual content in the movie that precedes and succeeds that scene, would have shown us more. If we take Jodorowsky at his word, he seems to have no goddamn idea what he is doing or what he wants or what the consequences of his actions are.\n\nOn which note, if Jodorowsky’s explanation of the scene’s intended symbolism is accurate, then he screwed up the edit. Mara clearly expresses an amorous interest in El Topo prior to the rape scene; “frigid” is not what I would call her at all. It would be possible to do a cut where this wasn’t the case and where Jodorowsky’s framing of the scene makes sense, but that’s not the cut we see. I can come up with potential other interpretations – he’s doing a thing which gives her an ability we see him demonstrating earlier, the obvious implication is that someone else raped El Topo in the past which caused him to develop this ability. (The Franciscan monks get raped earlier in the movie, so this is very much not a worldview in which men are immune from abuse.)\n\nJodorowsky claims that Mara Lorenzio knew what was going to happen before the scene happened and agreed to it, but also that he raped her. That’s a almost a tautology. If someone consents to rough unsimulated sex with you, and they remain consenting throughout the process, by definition it’s not rape. That said, it is possible that Jodorowsky was being imprecise in his language, or that Lorenzio didn’t realise it would be unsimulated, or that Lorenzio stopped consenting partway through but Jodorowsky did not stop, and of course there’s the power differential involved in any movie project between director and actor to consider.\n\n(On this latter point: in recent comments on the issue Jodorowsky has pointed out that actually, there’s no way they could have shot that sequence with the minimal crew he’d claimed, and they’d needed to set it up for multiple shots from different angles, which on a spurious level seems to clear him; after all, it takes away the idea that the scene was shot once in this brief, single sequence. On the other hand, who’s to say the sequence described in the original quote denotes not the entire scene in question, but one particular shot from it? Either way, this is another instance where Jodorowsky creates a situation where we must believe he was either being a crass, exploitative liar back in the 1970s, or is being a crass, exploitative liar now.)\n\nStill, I think it’s evident that what Jodorowsky wanted us to believe in that quote is that the rape happened, and that Mara Lorenzio knew that the rape was going to happen, and that Mara Lorenzio went along with it knowing and accepting what was going to happen, and that it turned out serendipitously that Mara Lorenzio actually did have sexual hangups and actually did have an orgasm from rough sex with Jodorowsky so the artistic endeavour yielded this positive psychological result for her.\n\nIn other words, it’s an enormous case of Jodorowsky trying to have his cake and eat it. He wants us to believe he is an edgy, dangerous director who could do anything. At the same time, he wants to give himself an out by saying that nothing happened that Mara wasn’t told was going to happen. The ultimate point of all this – the whole reason behind the anecdote, so far as I can tell – is the bit at the end, where he talks about how this was basically art therapy. We see here further signs of where we’re going to end up with when it comes to this Psychomagic business: Jodorowsky as artistic visionary and benign therapist and spiritual/philosophical guru all wrapped up in one package.\n\nAs mentioned, we don’t know Mara Lorenzio’s feelings on the matter, so the rule of thumb of “believe the victim” can’t apply here. But I also have another rule of thumb, which is to believe abusers when they tell you that they are abusers. If Jodorowsky was telling the truth back in the 1970s when he told this story, then he was telling us then he was an abuser, and he’s lying now when he claims otherwise, which is not the hallmark of someone who has given up on abusive, manipulative, and exploitative behaviour.\n\nOn the flipside, if he was lying back then, this reveals that in the past he was willing to bullshit the world for the sake of doing publicity, and to build up an image of him as this healer-auteur which intersects troublingly with his later claims about the whole Psychomagic thing. It means he was at best untrustworthy, at worst trying to create a cult around himself – a cult which he arguably succeeded at creating.\n\nEl Topo was the start of the Jodorowsky cult – when his myth-making about himself really began to take off, and when he gained serious counter-cultural cachet. (The fact that the counter-culture seems to have largely let his claims about raping Lorenzio pass by uncommented-on is something of an indictment about where it was at the time.) John Lennon was a big supporter of the movie, and in those days if a Beatle liked you then wider attention was near-guaranteed; it also kicked off the “midnight movie” fad in American arthouse cinemas, which until guttering out in the mid-1980s would provide crucial markets for the likes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Eraserhead, Pink Flamingos, and Fritz the Cat.\n\nTo be fair, there’s a lot to like about El Topo. It’s clearly an evolution from Fando y Lis, but Jodorowsky shows a knack for dressing up his Surrealist-inspired set pieces in a quasi-Western aesthetic, showing heavy inspiration from Sergio Morricone. Even the soundtrack feels a bit like an Ennio Morricone number, with El Topo’s flute having a similar prominence to Charles Bronson’s harmonica in Once Upon a Time In the West.\n\nJodorowsky’s interests, however, seem to have shifted from the more straightforwardly psychological to religious and mystical considerations. El Topo himself feels like two very different characters – a jealous, vengeful, violent Old Testament figure in the first half of the movie, before he transforms into a gentle, non-violent, belevolent New Testament type. Benevolent, that is, until the town does something unforgivable: then we get an apocalyptic final outburst of violence, followed by a fate that suggests that El Topo has now truly attained the enlightened state of the four gunfighters he bilks in the desert.\n\nThis is not a simply Christian movie, however; El Topo’s final destiny calls to mind iconic Buddhist protests against the Vietnam War, through which lens El Topo may be a boddhisatva, one who has attained enlightenment but returned to the world for the enlightenment of others. In this reading, El Topo successfully attains enlightenment when Mara and the Lesbian With No Name abandon him; he is literally seeking enlightenment for the captives in the cave. The castration of the bandit leader, coming as it does in a section entitled Genesis, after he has declared himself God is reminiscent of the castration of Uranus by Cronos, or Cronos by Zeus – one God usurping another (leading into that Old Testament/New Testament structure). The four gunfighters each seem to correspond to different types of intensive spiritual practice – yogic asceticism, Tarot-driven occultism, bucolic intuition, and hermit-like poverty and isolation respectively.\n\nThere’s also social commentary: the town in the second half is clearly a stand-in for the ugliest aspects of American culture, right down to the massive use of the eye-in-the-Pyramid symbol. This, I think, is meant to refer to the Great Seal of the USA; though it may also meant to nod to more conspiratorial ideas about it, I feel like the townsfolk’s use of the symbol is too deliberately crass, blatant, and ubiquitous for it to meaningfully represent the worldview of a secret society (they’d be a bit more subtle about it); it’s more of an aggressively presented indication of group-adherence, like how the more aggressive breed of patriot tends to use the flag.\n\nStill, I’m left in two minds about whether there’s anything substantial to El Topo if you are able to look past the rape angle. It’s a somewhat wearying journey through some fun imagery, but it feels like its ultimate message risks being vapid and there’s a certain air of exploitativeness and cheap sensationalism that creeps in around the edges.\n\nAnd if you can’t or won’t look past the rape thing, I honestly can’t blame you. As I’ve argued, either Jodorowsky really did do a shitty, appalling thing for the sake of making the movie (there’s some incidents of animal cruelty here which are also troubling – something that also features in The Holy Mountain), and he’s now trying to cover for it, or alternatively he made up a bullshitty story to make himself seem like the sort of edgy Messiah figure he plays in the film – when actually if he was this enlightened, benign figure he wouldn’t tell such weird, grim stories about himself in the first place.\n\nThere’s no angle you can view that story from which casts Jodorowsky in a good light; regardless of your interpretation, it’s a bad look on him. El Topo itself is ambiguous enough to admit to a range of interpretations, on the other hand, and if there’s any value in the movie, it arises from that fact.\n\nI just wish I could be sure I hadn’t caught a glimpse of an actual rape when watching it.\n\nThe Holy Mountain\n\nIn the middle of a junkyard, the figure known as the Thief (Horacio Salinas) comes awake and stumbles into the city, in which massive state violence and religious hypocrisy is on display. Eventually, he finds his way into the tower of the Alchemist (Jodorowsky), and after confronting him accepts a position as his apprentice. Along with the Written Woman (Ramona Saunders) and seven powerful social figures each corresponding to a planet (Mercury and Earth are not specifically represented), the Thief is accepted into the Alchemist’s project to scale the Holy Mountain and overthrow the Nine Immortals who control the universe, thereby attaining immortality and gaining their power. To do so, the nine must undertake further processes of purification, personal exploration, and group identification – by the end of which the object of their quest may well not be what they signed up for.\n\nThis was Jodorowsky’s magnum opus. His version of Dune might have been that, had the project not crashed and burned, so The Holy Mountain is it. Jodorowsky was at the peak of his cultural cachet when he made it, he had yet to become associated with the failure of Dune and so his professional standing was at its highest, and John Lennon was helping to bankroll the movie. It is notable that he immediately backed away from anything resembling a conventional genre, in stark contrast to El Topo – framed as a Western largely due to the commercial rejection of Fando y Lis. Instead, Jodorowsky exerted absolute creative authority over the process – as well as directing, writing, and producing, he also did the set and costume design – and produced something which was 100% his vision, aimed directly at the counter-culture audience he had cultivated.\n\nIs the ascent worth it?\n\nI’m not sure.\n\nPrior to the Thief meeting the Alchemist, the movie’s symbolic language is heavy-handed and rather obvious, but at least refreshing for its audacity. The crass American tourists posing for photos of themselves fucking police brutes over the bodies of their victims, the Roman-operated sellers of religious figures that is all about greed and money and personal enrichment which is a rather obvious spoof of the Church, and the Church building where peasants dance with cops and the priest rejects the Christ that the Thief brings him in favour of the Christ he goes to bed with (perhaps a spoof of Church collaboration with the State and meaningless Christian sectarianism), it’s all in the service of a pretty blatant anti-authoritarian, anti-Church message; it’s nothing that Buñuel hadn’t already done with more panache and in more daring circumstances (it’s much easier to break taboos when taboo-breaking has become routine), but still fun in that sense.\n\nHowever, the whole message of the movie isn’t that you should do anything about that – it’s all about turning your back on that in favour of internal spiritual practice. The line between esotericism and solipsism is, after all, extremely thin. That’s not to say that social satire entirely disappears from the proceedings. There is a fairly long segment giving an insight into the lives and personalities of the seven bigwigs representing the planets as we are introduced to them one by one, for instance, which tries to balance social commentary with allusions to esoteric properties of the planets in question. On Lotus Island, where the Holy Mountain is to be found, the Pantheon Bar is a never-ending party of people who tried to seek Enlightenment but got sidetracked along the way, persuaded that their own artistic imagination, stoner theories, or personal accomplishments were the Enlightenment they were seeking and giving up on the idea of seeking the summit.\n\nHowever, these are all ultimately sideshows – like the Pantheon Bar itself. From the moment the Thief enters the Architect’s tower, the movie is much more interested in exploring Jodorowsky’s personal syncretic mashup of Kabbalah, Tarot, Masonic symbolism, Golden Dawn occultism, alchemy, quasi-Jungianism, Zen, Sufism, yoga, the Enneagram of Óscar Ichazo (with whom the cast studied intensively prior to filming), and so on ad nauseum.\n\nIn this respect, Jodorowsky had his finger on the zeitgeist. 1973 was a fertile time for this sort of cobbled-together spirituality mashing up traditional systems with pop psychology, vague New Age soul-searching, and the sort of human potential movement-type ideas which pop up in contexts ranging from team-building exercise to NXIVM-esque cults.\n\nAt the same time, the movie also falls into the pitfall of presenting a vision which is so personal, using a system of symbolism which is simultaneously extremely precise yet, at the same time, not really depicted in such a way as the viewer could be meaningfully expected to infer that from the material they are presented with. This is essentially the exact same fault that sabotaged Guy Ritchie’s Revolver, except Jodorowsky didn’t suffer the critical roasting that Ritchie endured because The Holy Mountain was being unleashed on an audience and era which was much more receptive to such navel-gazing, and because people essentially expected this sort of thing from Jodorowsky in a way they didn’t from Ritchie.\n\nFor instance, take the seven figures representing different planets. Jodorowsky does not include Earth and Mercury – I think the Thief and the Written Woman are supposed to represent them, but the movie does not give a direct indication. Jodorowsky probably only specifically names seven planets because in alchemy there are traditionally seven planets – but not Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto, who are included here but obviously were not generally known at the time most of the alchemical literature was written. The seven alchemical planets are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon, and the Sun, since the alchemists were largely working in a geocentric cosmology in which a planet was defined as being one of the major lights in the sky that changed its position in relation to the “fixed stars”, which we now know to be other suns.\n\nNow, Jodorowsky doesn’t want to work with traditional alchemy when it comes to the planets, but at the same time he does seem to want to present very direct ideas from traditional alchemy in other parts of the film. And he works in this way in much of the rest of the movie; when the Thief first sees the Alchemist, the Alchemist is sat between the black and white pillars of Jachin and Boaz, as feature in Masonry and the Tarot; among the various symbols and Hebrew letters written on the Written Woman is the symbol of Royal Arch Freemasonry. But this is all ripped out of its context within the wider symbolic structure of Freemasonry, and Boaz and Jachin have two I Ching trigrams inscribed on them.\n\nThis sort of blending of traditions and symbols is nothing new; Crowley was very much into a lot of it. But it persistently feels like Jodorowsky is being a bit of a tourist, grabbing things and mashing them together without accounting for how pulling those things out of their original context undermines them, or how they necessarily fit together. And it is worth noting that, bar for Óscar Ichazo’s bullshitty little Enneagram, specific recognisable occult imagery fades away in the final act of the movie, as the party make their ascent up the Holy Mountain.\n\nThe movie was apparently shot sequentially. This may be why this last segment is less visually rich than the preceding parts: the money may have been getting tight. But there also seem to be artistic decisions contributing to this. In order to prepare for the ascent, the nine seekers have burned all their money, cut off all their hair, dressed alike, and undergone psychedelic experiences with Mexican shamen (actual, real ones who agreed to take part in the filming) to help dissolve their egos. By the time they are going up the mountain, no longer are there fabulous costumes; they are all wearing basically identical blue hiking gear. Jodorowsky’s Alchemist is instantly recognisable because he has retained his moustache, but everyone else has rather lost their individuality altogether.\n\nIncidentally, this loss of individuality is in some ways to the detriment of the narrative and symbolism; quite simply, it makes it much, much harder to tell the nine seekers apart. This means it’s much trickier to, for instance, discern the differences between them when they are having various individual temptations and nightmares as they make the ascent, which feels to me like an obfuscation of the very imagery and symbolism Jodorowsky is trying to communicate.\n\nHowever, there’s something much more disturbing seeing Jodorowsky and his cast like this in 1973, back when cult-like movements were spreading like wildflower in the wake of the hippie counter-culture disappearing up its own arse. When I see these people giving up everything which makes them distinct and identifiable and identifying wholly with the group, whilst they follow the demands and instructions of Jodorowsky, a teacher who retains just enough individuality to make him distinct from the group (and therefore the centre of focus), I do not think of a benign search for personal enlightenment and self-actualisation.\n\nHere is what I think of instead. I think of David Icke and family, wearing matching turquoise tracksuits as they proclaim David a Son of the Godhead – the aesthetic is similar except Icke and company didn’t shave their heads. I think of Scientology, and David Miscavige perpetuating by rote a pattern of abuse designed and documented by L. Ron Hubbard in his lifetime well past the death of the man this was all supposed to ultimately benefit. I think of Heaven’s Gate, the Manson Family, the Solar Temple, Jonestown, or less apocalyptic examples like the Process Church, with the common thread between them being intense religious feeling interwoven with intense group identification.\n\nI am not saying that communal feeling is evil or individualism is an unalloyed good. We are social animals, and still other nightmares come true when all connection to society is abandoned. I am not even saying that a period of intense surrender of individual identity to a group identity can’t have benefits to it. But what I am saying is that this sort of surrender is intensely perilous, not least because it’s not always going to be obvious what sort of group identity is going to form out of that, and those perils intensify a thousandfold when the group is intensely focused on following the teachings of a single will, which is exactly what happens here.\n\nIn essence, once the nine seekers are gathered together the movie becomes a surrealist-tinged guidebook to how to set up your very own cult. Take some people, sell them on the idea that you will allow them to attain something nobody else can offer, deprive them of their means to support themselves independently of the group, take away the distinctions between them, make them dependent on you, and eventually make them police each other… in one stage on the climb up the mountain one of the characters (I think it’s the symbolic representative of Venus but I couldn’t quite tell) makes a comment which causes the others to decide he’s been holding out on them, not fully giving himself to the process, so they pressure him into cutting off his own fingers.\n\n(That said, they do better than some of the animals in the film; when the table of lizards and toads re-enacting the coming of the Conquistadors explodes, I am fairly sure you can see some toads caught up in the explosion, and there’s one sequence which I’m 99% sure is an unsimulated dog fight.)\n\nThis makes the second movie in a row where Jodorowsky depicts himself as an enlightened Messiah/guru figure, mind you, and the production process was quite cult-like in its own right, with the cast doing spiritual lessons together for three months and then living together for a month before filming commenced. That’s not as intense as, say, the absolutely absurd conditions involved in more legendarily abusive creative processes, like what Captain Beefheart put his Magic Band through in the process of making Trout Mask Replica or something, but it’s still another example of Jodorowsky taking this stuff out of the movie and into a real context.\n\nAbout that… I will now spoil the entire ending of the film for you, to save you the annoyance of it happening unexpectedly. After the Thief has returned to the world with the love of a woman who adores him to sustain him, seeking enlightenment through that alternate route, the remaining eight seekers and the Alchemist sit down at the table around which the Immortals sat – but the Immortals proved to be only dummies. On the table is depicted the Enneagram.\n\nThe Alchemist then explains that the seekers thought they were going to transcend humanity and become immortal – but now here they are at the summit, more human than ever before and thoroughly mortal. He now says he is going to reveal the big secret, and then says “Zoom back, camera!”; the fourth wall shatters, the camera zooms back to reveal the technical crew, Jodorowsky explains that The Holy Mountain is over and it’s now time to leave and do the real work in the world, after the cast flip the table Jodorowsky says “Goodbye Holy Mountain – real life awaits us.”\n\nThe impression I think we are meant to get is that Jodorowsky has told us a bunch of things we really needed to know about society, taken us on a journey in parallel with the journey the cast of characters has endured, and has now freed us to apply new insights to our lives. But I don’t think The Holy Mountain does that. Instead, it expresses a bunch of counter-cultural platitudes about society which most people can probably agree with on some level (even regular Church-goers can look at the anticlerical scenes and assume it’s talking about the wrong kind of Church, rather than theirs), then it strings us along with a long shaggy dog story, and then it says that the journey is over and have all definitely learned something important, when in fact we have learned nothing and the movie has communicated nothing which the intended post-hippie audience didn’t essentially know, believe in, or agree with already.\n\nIn short, I think The Holy Mountain is a cult movie which was designed to be a cult movie; a film which intends to provide nothing to its audience other than a bunch of amusingly trippy imagery and a wish to go to others and say “Hey, you should go see The Holy Mountain” – and that’s it. It purports to offer some seed of great wisdom, but what it actually delivers is a statement that true enlightenment, attainment, personal fulfillment and self-actualisation is not going to be delivered by watching a movie. It expends a lot of energy in trying to convince you that Jodorowsky has some sort of significant insight to impart to you, but at the crucial moment he bottles it.\n\nThis is true of a lot of the philosophies – especially the human potential movement stuff – that inspire the movie. They hype up the importance of growing your own potential, but they fail to offer any meaningful thing to do with that potential beyond growing it further. They serve no wider vision of society or of human life aside from propagating themselves purely for the sake of propagating themselves, since they believe that there is no activity which is more laudable than promoting the system in question. They become not a means to an end but an end in itself, and an astonishingly shallow end at that.\n\nThe Surrealists that Jodorowsky clearly takes so much inspiration from made a habit of using their art to attack the Church, the State, tradition and all sorts of other oppressive things; The Holy Mountain makes an effort to follow in their footsteps. However, there is a tyranny in The Holy Mountain which the movie does not address, and that’s the overbearing presence of the Alchemist himself, who is basically Jodorowsky (as the fourth wall breaking sequence at the end establishes). The oppression of private groups and individuals was less generally recognised at the time than the oppression of more traditional institutions – that’s why so many hippies grew up to become obnoxious libertarians.\n\nPerhaps – perhaps – the thing that The Holy Mountain can be said to do for its audience is that it makes an attempt, at the end, to free the viewer from the dominance of Jodorowsky, to liberate you from the idea that he’s got some sort of big major artistic or social or mystical statement to make. But there’s an easier way to be free of Jodorowsky, and that’s to ignore him altogether. Any mystical system which is designed to teach you that you do not the mystical system in question is suspect; it demands time and emotional investment to arrive at the same conclusion that someone smart enough not to fall for the scam already reached, and whilst it make you wise to such things in future, you don’t need to be boiled by this particular pot of water to realise it’s hot.\n\nPsychomagic: A Healing Art\n\nJodorowsky’s career rather went off the rails after The Holy Mountain. Shortly after its release, he fell out with Allen Klein, the former Beatles manager who had distributed El Topo and The Holy Mountain. Klein had wanted Jodorowsky to adapt The Story of O, but Jodorowsky had become enthusiastic about feminism and strongly disliked the content of the story, with its strong focus on BDSM with women as the submissive parties. Neither party budged; as a result, Klein kicked off a rights dispute which kept El Topo and The Holy Mountain in limbo and meant no legitimate home video releases of either movie took place until the late 2000s; the disappearance of both movies from the market may have contributed to the mystique around both films.\n\nThen the Dune debacle happened; then he made Tusk in 1980 (which so far as I can tell sank like a stone), the rather well-received Santa Sangre (produced and co-written by Claudio Argento, younger brother of Dario) followed in 1989, and then in 1990 he made The Rainbow Thief – a project he hated working on because he was not allowed to make any changes to the script. Grumpy with the whole process, he disowned the finished movie and effectively ceased to be a director for a quarter of a century. Though he had some small acting roles since, his most visible artistic output in the 1990s was his work in comics; he’d been producing some comics works since early in his career, and his The Incal had come out over the course of the 1980s, but from the 1990s onwards he made far more waves with The Metabarons than any new film work he was doing.\n\n2015 swung around and a Jodorowsky revival seemed to be on the horizon (though the rediscovery of his rape claims around El Topo may ultimately thwart this). As well as the Jodorowsky’s Dune documentary, it saw the release of The Dream of Reality, followed by Endless Poetry in 2016. The two films formed a cinematic autobiography, spanning from Jodorowsky’s origins to his decision to leave Chile for Paris in order to (with typical Jodorowsky humility) “save Surrealism”; they feature Jodorowsky as his present-day self, either commenting on the action or stepping in to give support to his younger self.\n\nThe Arrow boxed set, however, jumps straight from The Holy Mountain to Psychomagic, Jodorowsky’s latest release from 2019. It seems apt that since he started working in film again, Jodorowsky has made three films what are basically about himself; this would be surprising from an enlightened master who has transcended ego, but is entirely unsurprising from the mind that gave us the self-celebrations of El Topo and The Holy Mountain. It is perhaps also appropriate that Jodorowsky’s Dune, a movie about him but not by him, seems to have gained more acclaim and attention than any of his own latter-day works.\n\nPsychomagic: A Healing Art is, at least purportedly, a documentary about Jodorowsky’s work with the titular therapeutic method of his own invention. It begins with Jodorowsky making a distinction between psychoanalysis as defined by Freud, which is a talking therapy in which the therapist is discouraged from touching the patient, and psychomagic, which is a therapy based on acts, not words, and in which the therapist is encouraged to touch the patient (since it overlaps with Jodorowsky’s work in initiatic massage).\n\nWe get very little in the way of further explanation, but so far as I can piece together from the remainder of the documentary psychomagic works like this: patients talk to Jodorowsky about their issues. Once he has a sense of what is going on with them, he derives this ritualistic little bit of performance art for them to do. Once they have done it, they feel better.\n\nThat is more or less it, and a lot of that I have had to infer. Most of the movie, you see, consist of these little case studies of patients that have tried out Jodorowsky’s psychomagic, and most of those consist of an introduction to the patient’s issue, the psychomagic performance art ritual itself, and then (sometimes) a followup in which the patient talk about how they feel now. It is essentially a compilation of success stories, but this makes the movie a matter of advertising and self-aggrandisement – like an artist’s portfolio of their work, only instead of artwork it’s patients.\n\nThat said “case studies” might be being over-generous. Though there is some followup, it’s fairly superficial, and there isn’t enough of it to really establish whether these people have experienced true improvements in their lives or merely got a rush of endorphins from the little scene and feel good about that. More generally, we don’t get any instances of people who felt that the therapy didn’t work for them, and there’s no explanation offered as to why some people seem to have one-and-done experiences whilst others seem to have a series of these things before the process is complete.\n\nWe also don’t really get much insight into the full process. In at least some cases, Jodorowsky must have given the patient significant amounts of briefing so they’d know what to do in the ritual performance in question, but there’s little insight on what that would entail and what input the patients had in devising the scenes themselves, or what considerations Jodorowsky takes into account when preparing this, or in assessing how things went afterwards.\n\nThis being the case, we can watch the movie from beginning to end and really not come away with an idea of how a psychomagic therapy process is constructed from beginning to end, or what makes it all that different from any other approach to therapy based around doing rather than talking – primal scream therapy, art therapy, use of role-playing exercises in therapy, vision board nonsense, or whatever.\n\nFor that matter, there is almost no acknowledgement of the existence of a wider world of therapy, psychoanalysis, and psychology other than the mention of Freud, which puts my hackles up. Credible scientists have a broader knowledge of developments in their particular area of science than just the famous epoch-defining heavy hitters; Jodorowsky presenting psychomagic like it’s the biggest idea in therapy since Freud, whether he’s implying it deliberately or accidentally, isn’t exactly humble of him.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, we get two examples which we are supposed to take as acts of social psychomagic, attempting to use its techniques to provoke social change or community therapy. It is far from clear how this is meaningfully different from performance art; in fact, the first example just comes across as a bit of performance art done during a gay rights protest, and it’s far from clear that Jodorowsky was even involved. The last instance is a Walk of the Dead in Mexico intended to commemorate people who have died in drugs-related violence there, where apparently a psychomagic chant was done and Jodorowsky addressed the crowd. However, though I am unable to find any confirmation that Jodorowsky was actually centrally involved in organising the protest/memorial, or that it was created as a specifically psychomagic-oriented action; that is the impression Jodorowsky’s direction is supposed to give us, but I’m really not sure whether it’s actually the case.\n\nThese are not even the most alarming parts of the documentary. Early on, when there’s more initiatic massage, we get a lot of Jodorowsky or his assistants groping away at people; there’s a bit where he grabs a patient’s testicles to infuse him with masculine energy. There’s no suggestion here that this is something the participants aren’t expecting or don’t consent to, though “let me touch you in an intimate fashion, it will heal you, honest” is certainly a sleazy angle that people have tried out before.\n\nNo, what really astonishes me here is the bit where Jodorowsky implies that he’s cured someone’s cancer.\n\nJodorowsky is extraordinarily careful not to directly claim he’s cured this patient’s cancer, mind. The title card for the section is framed as a question (“Can cancer be cured?”), not a statement, and in discussing the incident the patient doesn’t say that her cancer had been cured by Jodorowsky – she concedes, in fact, that the incident shown in the documentary happened after she had gone through a more mainstream medical intervention, but she believes her experience with Jodorowsky opened the door for healing.\n\nStill, it really feels like Jodorowsky is dancing close to the line here – and doing so in such a way that comes across like he really wants to suggest that he did cure this woman’s cancer, but is aware that he could get in significant trouble in some jurisdictions for doing so. There’s no moment where he clarifies that he doesn’t think he actually cured the cancer, merely helped with the recovery process, or anything like that, and the whole way the section is framed feels like it’s an attempt to nudge people into concluding more than is explicitly said.\n\nAnd then there’s the method involved. The footage we get shows Jodorowsky giving a lecture in a packed theatre, and he invites this woman up on the stage and has all the audience members hold out their hands and beam healing energy at her. Maybe Jodorowsky would prefer us to think that the whole audience cured the cancer, rather than him doing it himself – but he’s still very much the person who arranges the situation and calls on them to do it, he’s directing and controlling and presiding over the situation. It’s very televangelist-tastic, and yet again comes back to Jodorowsky basically posing as/actually acting like a phony Messiah figure.\n\nI’m not saying that these interactions with Jodorowsky did nothing for the individuals in question, or that there’s no merit to the general idea he’s working with here. Therapy is often cathartic, and we’ve known that drama can induce catharsis since Aristotle, catharsis has at least some value even if it doesn’t necessarily last for the long term.\n\nFurthermore, if you’ve decided to go to Jodorowsky to participate in psychomagic, it’s probably because you are aware of his work as a director, and these psychomagic rituals he cooks up are basically like little Surrealist micro-plays – or, more to the point, like scenes in his movies. (Extracts from all of his feature films aside from The Rainbow Thief pop up over the course of Psychomagic to illustrate this point.) In essence, then, his patients get to be the star actors in a special little mini-movie that’s just for them (or for all of us, if they’re one of the patients who agreed to appear in this documentary), directed by a world-famous director. That’s got to offer at least a little bit of an ego boost.\n\nStill, yet again it comes down to Jodorowsky presenting himself as this guru figure who makes this unique, life-transforming intervention in people’s lives and coyly suggests that he has outright supernatural powers without quite committing to declaring as such. In the context of a career as a director in which he has almost constantly centred himself and promoted this image for himself, this would be annoying and egotistical. In the context of someone trying his hand at being a therapist, it’s deeply alarming."
