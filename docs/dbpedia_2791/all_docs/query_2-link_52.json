        "text": "Since the dawn of home video, the unavailability of two cult classics by Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky—the legendary midnight movie favorite El Topo (1970) and its mind-blowing successor, The Holy Mountain (1973)—has been a source of great frustration for devotees of strange cinema. Many of them (this writer included) have spent irrational sums of money importing inferior transfers of the films in various formats from Japan, where they were still available. Now, after years of waiting for Jodorowsky and producer Allen Klein (the notoriously prickly president of the Abkco record label and former manager of The Rolling Stones and The Beatles) to settle their infamous feud, the films are finally being released in pristine form on American DVD.\n\nThe films are available individually or in an impressive box set that also includes soundtrack CDs for both titles, as well as Jodorowsky’s early feature Fando and Lis (1967), his short film La Cravate (1957), the feature-length documentary La Constellation Jodorowsky (1994) and a wealth of supplementary features (the usual interviews, commentary tracks, trailers, photo galleries, etc.). While Fando and Lis had previously been released on domestic DVD (accompanied by the La Constellation Jodorowsky documentary) several years ago by Fantoma, these new releases from Abkco (in association with Anchor Bay) represent the first time that Jodorowsky’s most significant work has been made available for home viewing to the American public, which subsequently marks these releases (particularly the exhaustive boxed set) as among one of the most important film events of the year.\n\nBut before we succumb to complete hyperbole, it’s also necessary to really examine the films themselves; indeed, some of them have not necessarily stood the test of time. Time is the key factor here, as Jodorowsky’s early works are definitely a product of their era. Consistently described as “psychedelic” and “hallucinogenic,” The Holy Mountain and particularly El Topo were midnight movie phenomena in the drug-haze days of the early 1970s, and one suspects that the mind-altering substances wafting through their late-night screenings may have efficiently blinded many viewers to certain flaws that become more obvious in the sobriety of one’s 21st-century home. Fando and Lis and El Topo in particular can be rather rough going these days; both films seem somewhat static and sluggish in their pacing, and the perceived mysticism of El Topo is also hampered by elements of thematic confusion, egocentricity and chauvinism (the latter being a quality that Jodorowsky has acknowledged as a personal one). Still, both films contain some remarkably bold, stylized set pieces and images of striking power. While some of the philosophies seem somewhat pretentious today, the films do also offer genuine intellectual food for thought (which is certainly more than you can say for far too much contemporary cinema).\n\nHaving acknowledged that, The Holy Mountain is actually a flat-out masterpiece, and one of the most astonishing and original films of the 1970s. While Jodorowsky’s previous films were free-form perversions of familiar genres, The Holy Mountain is largely unclassifiable in its sheer narrative experimentalism, visual splendor, outlandish humor and mystical mind-bending. Loosely structured as the spiritual journey of a Christ-like figure and his all-knowing guru (portrayed, respectively, by Jodorowsky’s son and Jodorowsky himself) amidst a surreal world of corruption, the film is an eye-popping (literally, in one grotesque moment) assemblage of unforgettable imagery and spectacular sets that must be seen to be believed. The Holy Mountain is easily the highlight of Jodorowsky’s film career; all cineastes with a taste for the unique should seek it out immediately. Like David Lynch’s Inland Empire, it’s the kind of movie that makes directorial self-indulgence an occasional blessing.\n\nIf Jodorowsky’s cinematic oeuvre is sporadic and (by his own admission)somewhat unpolished at times, this is simply a reflection of the fact that film is only one of many artistic mediums that he has explored through the years. Born in 1929, Jodorowsky was a clown, a mime, a puppeteer, a writer and a theater director before he became a moviemaker. In recent years he has focused his energies on writing surreal graphic novels, conducting tarot readings and—in the unlikeliest of career transitions—developing his own form of psychotherapy. His career really became significant in the 1960s with his involvement in the theatrical “Panic Movement,” co-founded with Roland Topor and Fernando Arrabal (who would later direct films that actually make Jodorowsky’s seem “normal” by comparison).\n\nFollowing the four early films collected in the new box set, Jodorowsky’s subsequent cinematic output has been problematic. The rarely-seen Tusk (1980) was an ill-fated film that the director essentially disowned due to its production problems. He came back strong with Sante Sangre (1989), a bloody and baroque carnival-set horror film that demonstrated that the director had (thankfully) not mellowed with age and remains among his best work. Unfortunately, he followed that with The Rainbow Thief (1990), a woefully misguided drama not even enlivened by the unlikely casting of Peter O’Toole, Omar Sharif and Christopher Lee. Jodorowsky has not directed a film since.\n\nGiven his advanced age and uncompromising vision, it may be unrealistic to expect that we will see another film from Jodorowsky, and this is lamentable. As he himself admits, he now feels that he has a richer comprehension of complex ideas that he was only just beginning to understand at the time he made El Topo and The Holy Mountain.\n\nMovieMaker spoke with Jodorowsky by phone recently while he was at home in Paris. He apologized repeatedly for his limited English, but his ideas came through loud and clear, and for such a reportedly intimidating figure, he was never less than friendly, gracious and often very funny.\n\nTravis Crawford (MM): It must be very gratifying to see El Topo and The Holy Mountain become available to the public again after so many years. What are your feelings about that?\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky (AJ): Thirty years ago, I would have been very happy. But now, though I feel good, it’s been so long… How can I really be happy with that?\n\nMM: What’s it like for you to see the films again after so long?\n\nAJ: Well, I have a tenderness when I see what I was fighting and trying to do when I was just 40 years old. I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted to do, and I admire that.\n\nMM: Can you look at them objectively as films, or are they personal artifacts for you?"
