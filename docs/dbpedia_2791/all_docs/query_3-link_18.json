The avant-garde Chilean auteur is best known for his 1-2 punch in the early 1970’s (El Topo and The Holy Mountain), his iconoclastic spirit, infrequent output (I think it’s 8 total films in 50+ years and I think he’s “disowned” a few of them). He’s also remembered for his failed adaptation attempt of Dune (he never completed his, not failed in the same way as Lynch). His strengths are The Holy Mountain and the fact that he has a clearly identifiable and unmissable audacious visual style.\n\nBest film: The Holy Mountain. The images stay with weeks after watching it. Jodorowsky’s finest work—a brilliant experiment.\n\ntotal archiveable films: 3\n\ntop 100 films: 0\n\ntop 500 films: 0\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 0\n\nmost overrated: Jodorowsky doesn’t have an overrated film. Santa Sangre and El Topo are both on the TSPDT consensus list but land between 1001-2000—and I’ll get to The Holy Mountain directly below here in the underrated section— so clearly not overrated.\n\nmost underrated : The Holy Mountain. I’d move it higher than the slot they have it- TSPDT has it at #803. The overhead shot work is both impressive from a formal standpoint and daringly beautiful.\n\ngem I want to spotlight : El Topo. Unlike The Holy Mountain this is a little more grounded in traditional narrative (which isn’t saying much in comparison with The Holy Mountain). It is certainly a Jodorowsky film but has elements of and influences from Leone.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits:\n\nSurrealism, Bunuel is his lineage (and Lynch picking up after him)—the Bunuel connection is there too because some of the images feel straight out of Dali\n\nThere’s a grand circus element in his work that feels like Fellini as well\n\nA true avant-garde artist, experimental cinema, cult classics or midnight cinema\n\nSymmetry and staging of the frame as his canvas—medium long shots to design the entire frame— Sergei Parajanov’s The Color of Pomegranates– it does feel at times like he’s doing art in front of the camera instead of cinematic art\n\nHeavy symbolism in his works\n\nRevolutionary, anti-convention, anti-Hollywood, anti-traditional cinema—an important alternative\n\nReoccurring use of overheat shots, bold color choices\n\ntop 10\n\nThe Holy Mountain\n\nEl Topo\n\nSanta Sangre\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1970- El Topo R 1973- The Holy Mountain MS 1989- Santa Sangre R\n\n*MP is Masterpiece- top 1-3 quality of the year film\n\nMS is Must-see- top 5-6 quality of the year film\n\nHR is Highly Recommend- top 10 quality of the year film\n\nR is Recommend- outside the top 10 of the year quality film but still in the archives"
