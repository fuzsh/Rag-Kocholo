        "text": "Money is shit. Money is nothing. Money is paper with nothing inside.\n\nBut unfortunately, money is also necessary. And independent filmmakers like us rely on your financial support.\n\nBut perhaps your enthusiasm for mind expansion got the best of you. Maybe you watched this film via questionable means. That's understandable.\n\nHowever, if you enjoyed our work, we hope you'll consider making a small financial donation of your choosing via PayPal. It's a cliche because it's true â€“ every bit helps.\n\nThe recent purchase of one of the Jodorowsky's Dune storyboard books has opened our eyes to the world of crypto currency. Check out episode 39 of the Filmumentaries podcast for an interview with the man behind the $3,000,000 winning bid (as well as JODOROWSKY'S DUNE director Frank Pavich).\n\nSo now that we're becoming more enlightened to the crypto world, we're happy to accept donations in the form of Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana or Dogecoin.\n\nOf course, please email us at jodorowskysdune@gmail.com if you have another crypto coin which you would like to donate.\n\nWe are truly grateful for your interest in what we do!"
