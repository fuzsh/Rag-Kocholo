        "meta_description": "El Topo by Floral Image, released 07 September 2022\n\n1. El Topo\n2. Subpoena\n\nWith their 3rd single release of this summer, Floral Image have revealed their most explorative recording yet. El Topo, named after Alejandro Jodorowsky’s cult cinema classic, aims to place you on an epic audial journey through an imagined technicolour landscape that Jodorowsky himself would be proud of producing. Ever mutating, El Topo takes you higher with its pounding Psych-Rock whilst also bringing you back down to earth with passages of awe inspiring ambient soundscapes. \r\n\r\nA thumping crowd favourite at their already raucous live shows, El Topo stretches across your ears like a meandering psychedelic river. The single is accompanied by a live session video where you see the band demonstrating their tasteful knack of incorporating both the heavy and the intriguingly mysterious for their Jodorowsky inspired stomper. The Norwich 4 piece have many tricks up their sleeve…Who wants more?",
