        "text": "The preface of the Mexican film El Topo, by Chile’s Alejandro Jodorowsky, considers the titular animal, the mole, that searches through earth for sunlight and, when finally finding it, goes blind. Relating this to the protagonist (played by Jodorowsky, who also composed the film’s sometimes annoyingly raucous music) may come hard or not at all; one can never be sure just what Jodorowsky had in mind—if anything.\n\nJodorowsky’s gunfighter on horseback in the Mexican desert is accompanied by his naked 7-year-old son (played by Jodorowsky’s young son). At the outset they perform a ritual culminating in Dad’s announcement that the boy is “a man”—a dig, perhaps, at Latin American machismo. In a scene of recent massacre (including animal carcasses with innards hanging out), the pair encounter a man on the sand who, in terrible pain, begs to join the dead others. Father hands pistol over to son, who does the dispatching. Tweaking the Roman Catholic line on eternal damnation, an act of Christian mercy becomes a suicide by proxy.\n\nIndeed, although El Topo’s taunting by the band of bandits responsible for the massacre suggests John Huston’s Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1947), a good deal of the film’s imagery and Catholic-skewering anarchism and wit derive from Luis Buñuel. El Topo shows all the bloodmarks of additional influence by Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns.\n\nIt is hard now to see the Eastern mysticism that captured the attention of John Lennon, the film’s legendary champion, but Jodorowsky’s irony survives intact. A woman whom El Topo rescues from the bandits’ grip rewards him by leading him to the four gunmen he most wants to confront. To paraphrase a familiar saying, “All roads lead to violence.”\n\nResplendent with barbarous beauty, El Topo is something to experience rather than perfectly grasp."
