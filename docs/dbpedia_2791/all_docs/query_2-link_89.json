        "text": "The child of Russian emigrants exiled to Chile, Alejandro Jodorowsky was born on February 7, 1929 in Irique. He left Chile for France in 1953 and joined the company of the celebrated mime Marcel Marceau. Thereafter, he staged performances by Maurice Chevalier and, in 1962, along with Roland Topor and Fernando Arrabal, he created Panique, (Panic), a cheeky, funny take on the surrealist movement.\n\nJodorowsky moved to Mexico in 1965 where he revolutionized the artistic scene, creating avant-garde theatre in particular. There, he directed three films, Fando Y Lis (1968), El Topo (1970) and The Holy Mountain (1973). As a result, Jodorowsky became known in the United States and the rest of the world as a celebrated cult filmmaker.\n\nIn 1973, he returned to France and embarked on the film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune. Though the film wasn’t made, it had a marked influence on science fiction cinema for the years that followed, including Star Wars and Alien which employed key elements of the team that Jodorowsky had assembled as well as.\n\nJodorowsky next collaborated with celebrated artist/illustrator Moebius (Jean Henri Gaston Giraud) on a series of graphic novels, the first of which was Les Yeux du Chat, (The Eyes of The Cat) released in 1978. Two years later they launched into Les Aventures de John Difool (The Adventures of John Difool). Jodorowsky would soon become one of the most famous and prolific comic writers with his Alef-Thau series, in collaboration with Arno, as well as Anibal 5 and Juan Solo, with Georges Bess. He also created Incal series with Zoran Janjetov and Face de lune (Moon )Face with Boucq and La Caste Meta-Barons (The Saga of the Meta-Barons) with Juan Gimenez, to name but a few.\n\nJodorowsky returned to cinema in 1989 with Santa Sangre, followed in 1992 by The Rainbow Thief, with Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. His autobiographical film La Danza de la Realidad, (The Dance of Reality) premiered at the Cannes Festival in 2013. Likewise, its sequel Poesia Sin Fin (Endless Poetry) premiered at Cannes in 2016.\n\nA multidisciplinary artist, Jodorowsky is the author of plays, novels, essays and poetry collections. He is also known for his practice of “divinity tarot” His work concerning the Tarot, titled \"De Marseille,\" was in collaboration with Philippe Camoin and since the 1980s, he has participated in numerous conferences on the subject. This has led him to develop Psychomagia, with those experiences that are recounted in The Theatre of Healing and The Dance of Reality. Alejandro Jodorowsky also devoted two books to Psychomagia: The Psychomagic Guide and Psychomagia, published in 2019."
