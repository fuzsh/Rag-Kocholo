Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French avant-garde filmmaker.

He made a name for himself in the late 1960s and early 1970s with films such as Fando y Lis, El Topo and The Holy Mountain, after which he attempted to make a film adaptation of Dune.

His plans for the film were ambitious, assembling an all-star cast including David Carradine, Geradline Chaplin, Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, Alain Delon, Hervé Villechaize, Udo Kier, Gloria Swanson, Salvador Dalí, Amanda Lear and his son Brontis. He also recruited artists Jean "Moebius" Giraud, Chris Foss and H. R. Giger to design the film and progressive rock bands Pink Floyd and Magma to create the soundtrack. The film was ultimately cancelled due to studios being unwilling to finance it, but has still managed to have a massive influnce on popular culture.

He later reunited with Moebius to create the comic book The Incal, which featured a lot of designs and story ideas they had created for Dune. Another comic book he wrote, Metabarons, also utilised designs and story details from Dune.

He is interviewed in the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune.
