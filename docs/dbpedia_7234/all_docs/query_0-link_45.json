        "text": "The New Yorker, October 2, 2000 P. 62\n\nTalk story about Robert Ludlum... Ludlum is, of course, the best-selling thriller writer of all time, having sold more than two hundred million copies of his twenty-two novels, and he has become known for the sweep and intricacy of his plots. What hasn’t been adequately appreciated is his sophisticated understanding of capitalism. Ludlum came of age during the Cold War, but he was always more engaged by what was going on outside or behind it. In particular, he was fascinated by capitalism’s ceaseless attempts to slip the bonds of national sovereignty... In “The Matarese Circle,” accordingly, the conglomerates have decided that the logical solution to the perpetual conflicts besetting the planet is simply to replace the violent rule of states with the aggressive but peaceful rule of multinational corporations. ...History proved the conglomerates wrong. The deregulation of industry, the rise of foreign competition, and the greater availability of venture capital all combined to destroy the conglomerates’ power... Now Ludlum brings us “The Prometheus Deception,” which, perhaps energized by the quasi-utopian vision of the New Economy, is his most ingenious novel yet. At the heart of it is Systematix, a Seattle-based company run by one Gregson Manning, a sort of Bill Gates with charisma. Systematix, which is devoted to the creation of enormous information databases and a panopticon of global surveillance, is ethereal where the conglomerates were ponderous. In fact, it’s the perfect new-model corporation, building its influence through alliances and networks. In just a few scenes of “The Prometheus Deception” Ludlum distills a year’s worth of Harvard Business Reviews, and provides a dead-on picture of contemporary corporate strategy—from the impact of Metcalfe’s Law to the emergence of the “virtual corporation.” Mentions Frank Norris’s “The Octopus” (1901)... Ludlum has been among the very few novelists who have taken the trouble to master and write about such market forces..."
