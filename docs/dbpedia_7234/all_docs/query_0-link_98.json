        "text": "As summer sizzles on stubbornly while those people start posting Halloween memes, television is amping up for fall programming with a heavy slate of new releases. In addition to previously-released films added at the beginning of each month, viewers can look forward to new animated properties for Rick and Morty (Max), Batman (Prime) and Terminator (Netflix). Powerhouse series Only Murders in the Building (Hulu) and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (Prime) return, with spankin-new action releases like The Union (Netflix) starring Mark Walhberg and Halle Berry, Vince Vaughn’s Bad Monkey (Apple TV+), and trippy beauty fable Divinity (AMC+). And a trio of shrewd documentaries – Killer Lies (Hulu), Cursed Gold (Disney) and Cowboy Cartel (Apple TV+) – expose breathtaking scandals. Book and Film Globe has curated a tasting flight of the month’s best VoD offerings, so sip on to find your next favorite watch.\n\nNetflix\n\nJoe Rogan: Burn the Boats (August 3) – The florid color commentator brings his bros-blunts-barbells business model from the podcast studio to the stage in his first stand-up show in six years since moving to Austin and opening a comedy club. Filmed at the glamorous Majestic Theatre in San Antonio instead of Rogan’s modest venue Comedy Mothership, the trailer–part Axe commercial, part UFC promo–offers nary a punchline but teases provocative material to inspire “ride-home arguments.” Like why anyone would spend money to watch a stoned 56-year-old in a hoodie ranting about the bite force of bears in this economy.\n\nThe Union (August 16) – Mark Wahlberg is Mikey, a blue-collar Jersey boy swept up in an international spy mission with ex-lover Roxanne (Halle Berry) in a new action comedy that promises to make us all feel terrible about our aging bodies. The verse-and-chorus plot pairs a phenomenally fit 57-year-old Berry with perennially pumped 53-year-old Wahlberg in a string of action scenes interspersed with callbacks to their romantic past, while agonizing the plot with unsubtle reminders that Roxanne is a sophisticated badass and Mikey is a clueless rube. “Where did Jersey go?” he asks idiotically after being drugged and waking up in London, but little does he know he’s just a training montage away from saving the world.\n\nTerminator Zero Season 1 (August 29) – Japanese anime studio Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell) and Skydance are creating a new Terminator series that writes a complex new chapter in the action franchise. In late-90s Japan, Malcolm Lee has been developing another AI system that hopes to compete with Skynet. As Judgment Day approaches, an unknown robot assassin pursues Lee and his family, while a mysterious resistance fighter from the future appears to protect him. Showrunner Mattson Tomlin says the Terminator franchise finds its soul in the love stories that bloom in the shadow of a machine holocaust, and serial animation offers a venue to “tell a multi-generational story about lovers, parents, children, siblings, and family bonds.” Terminator Zero is directed by Masashi Kudo and stars Timothy Olyphant, André Holland, Rosario Dawson, Ann Dowd and Sonoya Mizuno.\n\nKaos Season 1 (August 29) – A modern spin on Greek mythology transforms jazzy Jeff Goldblum into a paranoid, power-drunk Zeus hellbent on maintaining supremacy. When a new forehead wrinkle triggers fears of his reign crumbling – and the world ending – Zeus spirals into neurosis, while his friend-turned-nemesis Prometheus plots to use three mortals connected to an ancient prophecy to bring him down and reshape the future of humankind. The show also stars Janet McTeer (Ozark), Nabhaan Rizwan, Debi Mazar, David Thewlis, and Chris Curtis.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nThe Umbrella Academy Season 4 (August 8)\n\nInside the Mind of a Dog (August 9)\n\nVisit Netflix for a full list of releases.\n\nHulu\n\nOnly Murders in the Building Season 4 (August 27) – The true-crime trio head to Hollywood to investigate the murder of Charles’s TV show stunt double Sazz (Jane Lynch), whose death the show revealed in the final moments of season 3. But Sazz’s death starts to get complicated when they discover that Charles, not his lookalike, may have been the intended victim. The senior season of the plucky mystery series boasts a star-studded cast including Meryl Streep, Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, Zach Galifianakis, Melissa McCarthy, Molly Shannon, Richard Kind, and Kumail Nanjiani. With award nominations for last season falling like ticker tape, Only Murders could shoot ten episodes of linoleum peeling and the black mold would get short-listed for a 2025 Emmy.\n\nMuslim Matchmaker Season 1 (August 20) – The groundbreaking new series from Indian Matchmaking creator Smriti Mundhra follows Muslim Americans as they steer through cultural customs while looking for love – without dating apps and hookup culture. From cringey first dates to moments of profound connection, matchmakers Hoda and Yasmin help their clients navigate the complexities of marriage-focused courtship while staying true to their values and beliefs. Executive producer Senain Kheshgi believes the show will counter stereotypes that Muslim culture is monolithic, adding, “this is an important opportunity to showcase the unique stories, personalities and perspectives of our diverse community.”\n\nKiller Lies: Chasing a True-Crime Con Man (August 29) – Killer Lies tells the story of French serial killer expert Stéphane Bourgoin, and the rise and fall of his international reputation. His star ascended along with the lucrative true crime industry until a group of cyber sleuths began to scrutinize his work – and discovered his career was based on a series of dark lies, including its violent origin story. The 3-part series based on Lauren Collins’ New Yorker article details their dogged investigation and the stunning extent of Bourgoin’s 30-year deception.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nReasonable Doubt Season 2 (August 22)\n\nThe New York Times Presents: Lie to Fly (August 24)\n\nVisit Hulu for a full list of releases.\n\nPrime Video\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader Season 1 (August 1) – Co-executive producer J.J. Abrams helms a moody animated Batman series that finds the dark avenger on the wrong side of the law in corrupt Gotham City. On the run from the cops, he must forge ahead on his own mission: to find the villains behind a series of catastrophic explosions before an all-out gang war erupts. His crusade for justice attracts surprising allies but leads to deadly, unforeseen consequences. The classic, pared-down 1940s animation style adds a slick noir feel to Batman’s grim vigil over the crime-haunted metropolis.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2 (August 29) – Sauron returns to pursue his evil ambitions as the gorgeous series builds on its first season’s vast scope and narrative ambition. Cast out by Galadriel, the Dark Lord disguises himself as an elf to trick the people of Middle Earth into creating the Rings of Power–the very tools he’ll use to control them. The forces of good face a rising tide of darkness as friendships strain and kingdoms fracture. The trailer teases an epic orcs-vs-elves battle, while Sauron will face his archrival Adar in a showdown for rulership of Mordor.\n\nJACKPOT! (August 15) – In the not-so-distant future, a Grand Lottery has been newly established in California. The catch: kill the winner before sundown to legally claim their multi-billion-dollar prize. The action comedy from Paul Feig stars Awkwafina as Katie, a lottery winner running for her life from jackpot hunters. She reluctantly joins forces with amateur lottery protection agent Noel (John Cena) trying to keep her alive in exchange for a chunk of her winnings. But a rival protection agent (Simu Liu), also determined to collect Katie’s money at all costs, will put Noel to the ultimate test. Careful screenwriting matches Awkwafina’s nimble delivery to Cena’s good-guy energy while clever physical sequences play up their contrasts.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nONE Fight Night: Brooks vs. Balart (August 3)\n\nThe Mallorca Files Season 3 (August 8)\n\nVisit Amazon Prime for a full list of releases.\n\nMax\n\nElizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes (August 3) – Elizabeth Taylor’s own voice narrates her story as a Hollywood megastar and a multifaceted woman who navigated lifelong global fame. With 40 hours of newly recovered interviews from 1964, along with her personal media archive, a deeper vision of Taylor emerges as a devoted artist who battled the studios and forged her own deals to play serious roles amidst a deep ambivalence toward her career and public image. The Lost Tapes reveals the complex inner life and vulnerability of the Golden Age legend while challenging audiences to reconsider her legacy.\n\nCity of God: The Fight Rages On (August 6) – 20 years after the events of the international award-winning film City of God, the release of a young trafficker from jail plunges the favela back into a power struggle once again. Cidade resident find themselves trapped among traffickers, militia, businesspeople, and the government until they unite around a plan to end the cycle of violence once and for all. The six-episode Brazilian series includes the return of beloved characters from the 2002 film including Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), Berenice, Bradock, Cinthia, Barbantinho and Melonhead, along with new faces that will bring Brazil’s notorious favela to life.\n\nRick and Morty: The Anime (August 16) – “Of all the multiverses, this one had to be anime.” Thus spake the trailer for Takashi Sano’s new Rick and Morty spinoff series that takes the chaotic pair into a new world of screwball misadventures, from fighting the evil Galactic Federation to falling in love with atemporal beings. The ten-episode show features voice actors reprising their roles from the Japanese dub of the original series (although it’s unrelated to events from the main show). With fans forced to wait until 2025 for season 8 of Rick and Morty (the first time the show has failed to release a new season every year), Sano’s anime fever dream is zany enough to fill the void.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nIndustry Season 1 (August 11)\n\nVisit HBO Max for a full list of releases.\n\nDisney+\n\nOceanXplorers (August 19) – All aboard OceanX’s state-of-the-art research and exploration vessel as it investigates the world’s ocean frontiers, 80 percent of which are entirely untouched. Armed with advanced technology, a team of explorers and scientists embark on a global odyssey to solve some of the ocean’s greatest mysteries through the lives of its animals and their ecosystems. The ship travels to the depths of the Atlantic in the Azores, the warm shallows of the Bahamas and Norway’s frigid arctic shores to unearth incredible underwater discoveries and push the boundaries of sea exploration.\n\nAre You Sure?! (August 8) – In the summer of 2023, Jimin and Jung Kook from K-pop group BTS embark on an unforgettable trip before their military enlistment, beginning in the U.S. and continuing to South Korea and Japan. Their “spontaneous” and totally not booked-months-in-advance adventure finds the duo engaging in a strict schedule of biking, fishing, snorkeling, kayaking, kart racing, snowboarding and hiking in a sort of eight-episode music video. It’s oddly relaxing watching the singers gamely dork out with clip-on microphones and selfie sticks with the confidence of young megastars who know they could film a dying cockroach with a 2003 Nokia brick and make millions off their devoted fans.\n\nCursed Gold: A Shipwreck Scandal (August 22) – Based on a New York Times bestseller, Cursed Gold tells the true story of maverick scientist Tommy Thompson and his resourceful team who stunned the world in 1989 by finding three tons of gold on a deep-ocean shipwreck in the Atlantic Ocean. Thompson’s discovery made him an American hero, but his fortunes changed when lawyers claimed the gold, leaving his investors empty-handed. The three-part series reveals a 3-decade yarn of deepwater adventure, deception and legal battles that takes Tommy from celebrated explorer to fugitive on the run, to a jail cell for refusing to cough up the location of 500 gold coins. Thompson remains incarcerated indefinitely on contempt charges since 2015.\n\nVisit Disney+ for a full list of releases.\n\nApple TV+\n\nThe Instigators (August 9) – A desperate father (Matt Damon) and an ex-con (Casey Affleck) come together to rob a big-money fundraiser for a corrupt mayor, but when the heist goes sideways when the police, bureaucrats, and vengeful crime bosses start hunting them across Boston. Out of their depth, they convince Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau) to join their getaway through the city, where they must overcome their differences and work together to evade capture—or worse. Directed by Doug Liman (Road House, The Bourne Identity), the film also stars Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, Ron Perlman, Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man), Toby Jones (Indiana Jones), and Jack Harlow (F9: The Fast Saga).\n\nBad Monkey Season 1 (August 14) – A new crime series based on Carl Hiaasen’s bestselling novel follows Andrew Yancy (Vince Vaughn), a disgraced Miami cop slumming it as a health inspector in the Florida Keys. When he stumbles onto a murder case involving a human arm fished up by tourists, he realizes it could be his ticket back into his old career. But first he needs to get past a voodoo witch, a lithe young widow, hired thugs, real estate developers – and a murder charge – to solve the case. Bad Monkey’s gore-in-paradise theme carries shades of a slapstick Dexter, while Vaughn is the sardonic voice of reason amidst a cacophony of Florida oddballs. Vaughn also executive produces alongside Bill Lawrence (Ted Lasso, Shrinking), with an ensemble cast including Rob Delaney (Deadpool & Wolverine), Michelle Monaghan, and guest stars John Ortiz and Zach Braff.\n\nPachinko Season 2 (August 23) – The critically-acclaimed international epic opens a second chapter in the sweeping journey of a Korean immigrant family across generations, countries and languages. Season two picks up in Osaka in 1945, where Sunja must make dangerous decisions for her family’s survival during World War II, and in Tokyo in 1989, where her Western-educated grandson Solomon struggles with his family roots. The story also explores the moral cost of Solomon’s deal with a seedy pachinko parlor mogul from season one, and the darker tone of Japan’s bubble economy in 1989.\n\nCowboy Cartel (August 2) – Apple’s latest four-part documentary series follows the unbelievable story of a rookie FBI agent who takes down the leaders of Los Zetas, one of Mexico’s deadliest cartels, and exposes their massive money laundering operation in the world of American horse racing. Featuring first-time interviews with case-breaking agent Scott Lawson, along with journalists and law enforcement, true crime fans will get the whole stranger-than-fiction story straight from the horse’s mouth.\n\nVisit Apple TV+ for a full list of releases.\n\nParamount+\n\nSEAL Team Season 7 (August 11) – The fan-favorite military drama is set to air its final season, with Master Chief Jason Hayes (David Boreanaz) struggling to adapt to a dangerous new era of warfare and to balance his warrior’s existence with family responsibilities. Ray, his second in command, questions whether he can leave the battlefield behind as his retirement nears, while Omar and Drew dive into work to distance themselves from past traumas. Deployed across the globe at a moment’s notice, the Team is ready and willing to take on a one last season of high-stakes missions. Joining Bravo team for the final season is Beau Knapp (The Bikeriders) in the role of Drew Franklin, a Chief Petty Officer with a checkered history.\n\nPD True (August 6) – Real-life police officers recount gripping stories and share exclusive, never-before-seen footage of their most notorious cases. The two-season series features hair-raising bodycam clips and chilling interviews with detectives who worked the country’s most high-profile crimes and murders, including the Pulse nightclub shooting, the New York subway shooting, and the notorious 1997 North Hollywood shootout that mimicked the violent bank robbery climax in the DeNiro/Pacino film Heat. The visual intensity and pacing of the stories bring their emotional charge to the vibrating edge as viewers are immersed in the pumping heart of each investigation.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (August 9)\n\nVisit Paramount+ for a full list of releases.\n\nPeacock\n\nMr. Throwback (August 17) – Former child athlete Danny (Adam Pally) turned struggling sports memorabilia dealer looks for redemption by reuniting with his childhood friend and basketball teammate, NBA legend Steph Curry. The pair decide to make a documentary about Danny‘s life, and he finds himself drawn into the megaballer’s glamorous “Stephiverse” – a world that’s a searing reminder of his own dreams that fizzled out. Can he reconcile his past mistakes with the future he might have had, and come to terms with his life as it is? Curry’s talent machine is well-calibrated to surround the star with experienced comedians so he can simply act like himself and help pull off a witty premise. The ensemble cast also features Ego Nwodim (Saturday Night Live), Adyen Mayeri, Tracy Letts and Rich Sommer (The Office).\n\nFace to Face with Scott Peterson (August 20) – For the first time since his 2003 conviction for murdering his pregnant wife Laci, Scott Peterson speaks on camera to reveal his side of the story to director Shareen Anderson, who has been investigating the notorious case for over a decade. While many believe the trial served justice, Peterson’s family and experts close to the case have spent over 20 years committed to uncovering flaws in the evidence and bolstering alternative theories about Laci’s murder. And in a shocking twist on a murder the world thought was solved, the Los Angeles Innocence Project takes over Scott’s case in 2024. A gaunt Peterson doesn’t utter a peep in the 90-second trailer, but true crime followers will be listening closely as information continues to unfold.\n\nThe Killer (August 23) – Legendary action director John Woo keeps the hits coming with a radical reimagining of his 1989 Hong Kong masterpiece, creating his first female-led film ever by gender-swapping Chow Yun Fat’s professional hitman with a mysterious assassin called Zee (Game of Thrones’ Nathalie Emmanuel). But when she refuses to kill a young woman (Diana Silvers) blinded during an assignment, the decision will disintegrate alliances, attract the attention of the law, and plunge her into a criminal conspiracy that sets her on a collision course with her own past. Sam Worthington plays Zee’s shadowy mentor and handler and Lupin’s Omar Sy is a savvy police investigator who gets close to Zee.\n\nAlso playing:\n\nBel-Air Season 3 (August 15)\n\nVisit Peacock for a full list of releases.\n\nAMC+\n\nDivinity (August 2) – Writer/director Eddie Alcazar crafts an indelible black-and-white trip that uses classic framing to delve into modern anxieties about maintaining costly lifestyles on a dying planet. Business mogul Jaxxon (Stephen Dorff) sells his father’s (Scott Bakula) anti-aging potion as a popular designer drug, but – annoyingly – it requires the use of fetuses in a future world with a 97 percent infertility rate. As the world grows more perverse in its pursuit of physical perfection, two mysterious brothers (Jason Genoa and Moises Arias) hold Jaxxon prisoner in his mansion and overdose him on his own formula with monstrous results. Kneading in imagery from Metropolis, Frankenstein, The Hulk and Terminator, Alcazar counts the cost of immortality in a pumping, quivering hallucinogenic nightmare."
