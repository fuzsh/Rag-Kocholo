If the whole movie (plot holes and discontinuities and all) were actually ALL in David's Imagination, then everything could be written off. Weyland created David, and David created (in his dreams) everything else: The Engineer in the beginning. Dr. Shaw & Dr. Holloway. The planet LV-223. Vickers. The black goo. the Engineer at the end.

OMG that comment is priceless!\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 12:13 AM\n\nBut wouldn't it be interesting if it were revealed to be a dream in a fragmentary form where everything was actually true, but happening the way David chooses to believe it happened. Because he's a dark Pinnochio, and he's found a way to lie while making people think they're hearing the truth by being ambiguous. As he does in many of the lines in the movie. Knowing full well what he means behind his remarks, what his programming was and what the true plan was. His true plan was to sort of do everything his programming told him to, but botch things enough and do things in a way dictated by his emotions to infect Holloway, get Weyland killed, and risk his own safety for a chance to survive to carry on free with his true goal. He thinks he should ascend to the throne of the kingdom (i.e. Weyland), or the throne of humanity. Whichever one. And wants to destroy his creators because he thinks he is clearly superior to them and closer to the level of these \"gods\". Gods who he realizes are only slightly more advanced, non-immortal, relatives of homo sapiens. There's a hidden drive behind David's desire to kill his creator. He thinks his creator is not fit to lead humanity anymore because of his foolishness. David sees himself as superior to him, and therefore feels that he should be the next king, though he can't admit it in his dreams, thoughts, and MOST of his actions/speech. Subconsciously Weyland recognizes David's superiority by not wanting Vickers in control of the company. At the same time his quest for immortality is such that he can try to remain in power, and attempt to gain some sort of superiority over his own creation. True genetic immortality fused with his own probably partially synthetic nature so he doesn't eventually rust or disintegrate and leave the company in the hands of millions of Davids who may feel the same way. And may have developed the same tricks to make people accept their fates. He's Weyland's closest thing to a son... a prince... and Weyland metaphorically would consider him next in line for the throne if the king should inevitably die. Something Weyland really didn't want because he knew one of his creations (Vickers) would already usurp him and was worried about the shape of things to come for the kingdom he built from the ground up. In the end he did a lot more damage to his kingdom by severing all the heads at the same time, thus allowing the body to be leaderless, and allowing a mutation to form under whichever leadership should arise over the next 30 years. A golden age, as spoken of in myths of a perfect, pristine time has ended for Weyland corp... Someone may step up to allow the kingdom/company/body to regenerate and thrive for a time, but without the leadership of a very intelligent corporate head, the body will lose direction and degenerate into a monster completely... Until some other company comes along and tries to extract the cells that have been corrupted in the body of the company like a cancer that will soon spread. Wouldn't it be cool if the first shot we get in the sequel is the way the flight sequence went down at the end. However, we then we see bits and pieces intercut of the way things really went down for just that end sequence. Prometheus is then revealed to have been a true dream through the eyes of the decapitated David head the way he was choosing to encode in into his memory banks. True, but with certain parts he didn't have access to from his perspective deliberately remembered ambiguously, in a imperfect way to trick his own programming into further accepting and allowing him to do what he will continue to do so that it becomes stored as a memory. And he feels no guilt about any of what he's done and what is to come. A problem he doesn't like: the fact that he feels guilt but also feels the same way deep down that he's become after those lonesome years of contemplation. His eyes open up to reveal that it was either a dream/memory, however it was both that was more like a recollection of everything that transpired from his point of view put into a visual memory bank in a way that lets him escape guilt. David has found a way to lie to himself about his actions, as well as to go against his programming even in his dreams. Lol I'm glad I can finally get my thesis on this subject about David being an evil ambiguous truth/lie telling bastard out in a good place.\n\ntankgirl\n\nSocial LiasonMemberOvomorphJul-19-2012 10:56 PM\n\nInteresting idea Free FreePlanet @joeymanic ha ha ha ha ha Space Age Bobby Ewing vibe....

Time to dig those David movies out,,from the debris of the Prometheus\n\nBe choicelessly aware as you move through life\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 12:43 AM\n\nUgh can't edit right now but to add there seems to have been a ton of stuff left out of Prometheus that I really think will reshape the movie a lot towards the sequel with the \"relaunching\". Things David couldn't have known about for sure like the Elder engineers, which already changes a lot in my books. Almost as a teaser to the sequel, and revelation that a lot of what we saw was from the robot's point of view as Lindelof said it would be early on. Really getting into the robot's head. When we see David looking into Shaw's dream there's a static filled image of David that briefly flashes as he disconnects. Some think it could be a left out part where there was a David in the memory at the site with Shaw and her Father. I think it's a bit of both. It's a clue that the entire movie is a recording of David's dream, but that all this actually happened. It was a brief image of David projecting himself into the dream before his decapitated state. I also think some of the planned scenes and filmed scenes were deliberately trimmed for a dual purpose, as well as some that were meant to be major clues being not filmed and things that were filmed left out for the relaunch/ revelations in the sequel to build on this idea later. As well as the idea that David himself wants to destroy and rebuild humanity with him as king, and this is why he tricks Shaw into helping him by offering assistance at the end, changing the meaning behind a lot of his words. We know he's partially evil because of the context, but really Shaw has nothing to go on but the way he said certain things a little strangely. Shaw still doesn't know he infected Holloway even though he basically admitted it and freed himself of guilt by ambiguously telling her it wasn't the air. So he was deliberately doing things ambiguously throughout the course of the events/dream/memory too, to hide his true intentions and to fulfill/alter his programming at the same time. As well as another way to escape the guilt he feels in having to do evil deeds because of the programming, and having to do them in a certain way he chooses and engineers as almost an actor to eventually reach his goal of being free. And through the brief use of a dream-like state he transfers remembers and tricks the memory banks into thinking things went down this way. Until we get a more complete perspective on everything.\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 12:58 AM\n\nIn this vision of the sequel David is only dreaming because he is breifly deactivated and then revived while Shaw reattaches the head and we see a quick succession of his memories after David wonders what will happen to his consciousness. Unbeknownst to David his consciousness is uploaded into that of an entire backup David consciousness acting as a collective subconscious for all the David's ever produced. When the head regains control of the body David has become something else. Something that can be in multiple places at once and craves more power... So some of the ending sequence is shown again happening in a different way to indicate that things didn't happen exactly as we thought. A would-be major theme for the second movie as it proceeds to reveal everything about the Elder engineers and the past and current state of Engineer, Weyland and the Yutani kingdoms at the same time. All have lost their head at some point in the past and the body changed direction as the head changed. Thus changing the entire kingdom. Yutani has a head that is capable of trying to tie all the kingdoms together into a monstrous empire.\n\nCustodian\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 1:33 AM\n\nEnter the YUTANI CONNECTION via the 10/11/12 merger/blackmail/spy mission? :)\n\n2013 sci-fi horror novels 'Custodian' and 'Tandem' available from Amazon, B&N, iTunes etc...\n\nSolaris\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 2:17 AM\n\nThis may be a valid explanation to the going-ons in PROMETHEUS. Where else do you see yourself meeting your maker? While dreaming halfway to your own death. This could be a shared dreaming experience kinda like INCEPTION, lol! See those people in the cryo sleep? They never wake up. They only wake up in another dream state: dream within a dream. When the Engineer God wakes up and start to go ballistic on the humans, it is a projection of collective human guilt. All your dreams are about neuroses, guilt, remorse etc. So they dream themselves scenarios where they get pummeled by Gods. But whether or not this is David's dream, I don't know.\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 4:44 AM\n\nI don't really think it's his dream, just a dream-like interpretation and reconstruction of all he was able to recall because of his ambiguous actions being recorded into memory and then assembled. It's happening during the record of all the events being uploaded to Weyland corp, the other Davids, and the other Weyland's mainframe/consciousness once the heads were damaged. Weyland was only a law of his kind and was partially synthetic too, i believe. I think too many ppl figured out a plot point way too early. One about David's head sending additional data back. So some things that would have given this away far before the sequel have been saved for the relaunching, or left out entirely. I won't even get into how some of the additional Holloway lines/scenes may have been cut to hide a bigger secret about the Engineers to make it not as apparent. It has to do with why they visited so many times and the fabled water tank scenes supposedly left out of this movie without purpose. David might also have some problems with believing this race to hold the answers, when really Holloway may have had the best theory about them had he survived to the end. David's also withholding a lot of info throughout the movie to avoid having to tell the truth, like whatever the hieroglyphs say. David doesn't entirely know Weyland's consciousness is out there now in the mainframe somewhere too... because he had already begun to turn himself partially artificial and had plans to back himself up, so as to still be able to attempt to have control through David. Weyland thought the darkness was the process not working, he doesn't care about a real afterlife if he wants to live forever and is afraid to slip in whatever comes next, even if it's nothingness. He's mad because he thinks both his plans for immortality just failed. And David was happy that he thought that plan had failed too. David may or may not know by the time they release all they've filmed that Weyland was talking about more than going to an actual heaven and that the body reestablishes a connection to the company. So \"relaunching\" will have dual maybe even triple meanings. When the head was severed the data transmission was severed and tried to take a record of everything stored. Everything that happened after that point becomes a gross misrepresentation of the truth in an even more fantastical, quick paced way based on what he knew was happening while trapped there on the floor and afterwards. There are no plot holes. The wine bottle is a clue and is connected to David's guilt which is why it doesn't tip over... When the body is reattached in the sequel, she has to deactivate him and he assures her he will still have his memories. As she does the scenes of Prometheus flash before us and when she reconnects the body a connection with the mainframe back on earth, and Weyland's consciousness is reestablished. David believed Weyland was a fool and didn't succeed in some of his endeavors. Even science can be wrong because David is covering up evidence, withholding evidence and being deliberately ambiguous, and the entire movie is as an extension of this. The hologram foreshadows Weyland's return, not only in the movie, but in the digital realm/spirit world after his apparent death in the film. The other Davids that Fassbender's on contract to play don't know that David and Weyland have both been uploaded to the company's mainframe/ collective consciousness which David now succumbs too more than his initial programming. Apparent nothingness to Weyand, and for David for a brief second in the sequel/part 2, but to the company and the other Davids a wealth of information that can't be gathered from Shaw's message. However, this is David's carefully crafted message to send them a certain picture. That David and to a lesser extent Janek are right about the true nature and the nature of the Goo. When Holloway, a stupid human had some of it figured out from the beginning that these were not gods. Because David is a pinnochio character and can't lie he crafts and paints things a certain way and knows what he's doing when dealing with separate kingdoms because he sees himself as an actor and a king, who not only wants to be real but now wants the exact thing Weyland craves. Whether he knows it's from Weyland's phantom or not.\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 4:59 AM\n\nThe way David is dealing with sending his ambiguous message to the company the same ways he covers up the truth and gets around his programming that doesn't let him lie or directly harm people. He does this by telling half-truths than can be seen as true even though they're also partially false because he's referring to something else or leaving things out. It's assumed that he is telling things exactly the way they are about them going to Earth. He tells them where they WERE heading. we have no way of knowing for sure David wasn't being ambiguous as he seems reluctant to go into detail for such a superior being. There are many examples of this and other ways that he tricks the other characters and the viewer into thinking he has the correct answer, or is telling the truth. \"I didn't know you had it in you\" while trying to make it appear he was talking about her taking it out. When really he knew she had it inside her the whole time and is dealing with his guilt and inability to lie. There's a psychological phenomenon where people alter memories and trick themselves by dreaming that it happened in a slightly different way or allowing the memories to fade using a form of selective memory based on only what is most relevant, and then misconstruing it and reforming the memories. I'm suggesting the entire movie is David's way of remembering events as someone came to earlier in the thread.\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-20-2012 5:39 AM\n\nUgh why can't I edit sometimes. I keep messing up while trying to frantically get all this info out at a time while I'm not too busy. But going back to possible themes in the second one and botching things on purpose to remain ambiguous; I think flooding will be a major theme in the second one and we'll be flooded with more information than we can handle from David(s). Some of it true with the aim of misleading into servitude like Lucifer in his war against the heavens. Some of it deliberately ambiguous and questionable like the movie was where you're sort of left to interpret things. The way David is dealing with sending his ambiguous message to the company is the same way he covers up the truth and gets around his programming. Programming that doesn't let him lie or directly harm people even though he's been programmed to find results by Weyland. Flooding your perceptions with alternate explanations could have been a big theme in this one if they only left a few lines by Holloway in because we already have multiple theories, though we're led to believe Janek/David are the most correct. As well the flood will tie in to the religious elements. I completely believe the theory that parts of the sequel have already been shot and will build off and reuse a lot of sets is true for reasons I won't say. As well as scenes that were specifically filmed for the sequel, cut down or left to add as a representation of the an alternate perspective in the sequel. So by David revealing more about what actually happened, perhaps what really happened to Vickers etc. etc. and flashbacks to what happened with Shaw and the Engineer, the first movie takes on a completely different shape, and we're forced to revisit some things and confront some things David nor Shaw really cared about checking on, while adding more understanding to Shaw's perspective because the Engineer acting monstrous occurred at a time David was saying it would happen. Then suddenly he burst through the wall like in a nightmare. Everything moves so quickly at that point and becomes more dream-like because it's all an imagination of the way that scene went down + what he logically assumed/knew happened after talking to Shaw. All constructed this way to keep us guessing about what the Engineers were up to with the Alien in the sequel, as well as to conceal what David is really up to for much of the movie: which is ensuring that Weyland's body dies. Lindelof, for as coy as he's being lately, is still on contract to merely produce the sequels and has stated he knows exactly where this is going, even hinting at a three movie arc. So this was all planned to be just the first step into our adventures with our anti-hero David who beleives he should have the right to rule/create and destroy because he is superior to humans and possibly even a threat to the Engineers if he assumes control of the body/kingdom of the company as the current prince/ next in line and favorite over Vickers, giving him his perceived right to be next in line. Going back to the flooding thing: sometimes that can be a way of hiding the truth behind statements, by overloading the message with too much info that sounds completely true, or half true, because it is only half true with some stuff that's questionable mixed in so that the viewer accepts it as part of the entire convoluted message. When really some of the misleading stuff like the Engineers wanting to destroy Earth is David finding a way to lie about where they were going in the past, and projecting his own truth about what he wished for the human race. David secretly wants them to become slaves to him and the bio-mechanoids. To feel how he FEELS as a slave. You can see in the way that David carries himself he feels trapped and paints himself a certain way to guard his emotions, but also accepts his fate and rushes through everything in a certain way that guaranteed his master's death. He was playing a game of chess and had already read the board, thought steps ahead and knew how to read the board(hieroglyphs) better than his opponent, and as an expert chess player outperformed them and outperformed them as an actor in the movie in multiple ways. He has a tell though... he gives away his true feelings sometimes in his undertones which was probably directed by Ridley to Fassbender to do that in his attempts to act away his guilt behind a more cheerful sounding tone. Which will probably not work out too great for David when Yutani saves Weyland from his leadership by killing the new god-king and forming an Empire with a shady past. But David's already learned that when your opponent has you at a disadvantage the best move to make in chess may not be the obvious one, but rather a defensive one or essentially to not move. Basically he has to wait for the right time to reveal certain truths or make certain pieces move in his attempt to put the king in checkmate. Not-exposing yourself, but not attacking immediately and looking steps ahead where you can see the outcome of the move coming back to bite you in the ass. So David goes with the rules of the game and alters his reactions and strategy as it goes, and as new pieces come into the picture. In the end the Engineer was a wildcard and David knew it would attack the humans, but thought the wildcard would be dealt in his favor as the Engineer is partially synthetic, but also more organic than David when he examines their blood on the wall. Essentially not moving or taking a full action and only making safe moves according to the rules of the game until he finds a way to tell the Engineer a truth that changes the layout of the pieces. He maybe could have even lied to the Engineer but technically he \"knew\" they were human and it may have been against his programming, so he just decides to straight-up tell him what Weyland was doing in a way that pisses off the engineer.\n\nMala'kak\n\nMemberOvomorphJul-26-2012 8:00 PM\n\nNot a dream, David's deception to the company told in a way where he's created false or ambiguous memories he believes to be true to deceive anyone monitoring the mission, i.e. Weyland reps on Earth and Yutani, who he knew hacked him. A way to change his dreams and interpretations of his memory. This is why the happy birthday David viral Rorschach like tests are so important. That way Yutani can't know all that David secretly learned, and hypothesized about the Engineers that he kept from the crew... I also think there's a second David on the juggernaut that Shaw and the head took, hiding out like the alien at the end of the original. However, this and the splashdown sequence on Paradise (the Spain water tank shoot) were too tied into the plot of the second movie, so steps had to be taken to change the ending a little, mislead people about what's really going on, and only certain test audiences saw part of this ending and parts of other things which I believe will be in the relaunching. So yeah I think the relaunching will reveal another David, another side of David's consciousness now that was a backup no one knew about like Weyland's twin orderlies possibly being clones. And the orderlies are only briefly seen together before they get killed somehow or disappear. Possibly in the medbay because of the blood that was left there. Guess we'll find out. Did the other David send them there to check on the trilobite? Was the other David secretly in a lot of the cut footage, attending to lots of things while the other was charging through with his mission. And they thought it might fuck up the surprise of having an evil stowaway David appear right when we think think Shaw has decided to knock the head back off of the newly repaired one after he's revealed to be very evil in the opening 15 minutes of the sequel/part 2/maybe even in the relaunching... If they'd gone with the original plan of keeping all the footage of the second David in the movie, and shot the yacht scene, it may have given away things too much before the sequel/relaunching. It's my belief we'll at least get to see the second android Ridley was talking about in the relaunching. So they went with making it ambiguous, having the Deacon appear right at the very end as the shocker, and disguising it as David's dream denial state that his wrong doings or other side even existed at all, because it reminds he's treated as a product programmed to serve his king. A king he wants to overthrow as the prince that sees himself as superior to the king. Little did he know it was seeping into the programming of all the other Davids as well, and Fassbender will become quite the omnipresent villain. And turn into a bigger literal god-king-monster than Weyland or even the Engineers. It might actually take the Engineers, and the enemy of the Elder engineers to stop what David has planned for paradise and earth by the end of the three movie arc. He wants to build an empire from his little kingdom and their kingdoms... and has been practicing how to deal with the natives, and controlling armies. At the same time the headless Weyland kingdom will join with Yutani to form an Empire representing earth with all their colonies. And some marines will show up for the third one this time. And the backup secretly made his way to the second juggernaut... David's whole part at the end was another trick to get shaw aboard, and if she hadn't come along willingly he could have flown the ship without her, which is why he waits for the action to die down and contemplates his move like a good chess player. which adds double meaning to him saying he can fly it and is him secretly testing her to see if she still doesn't suspect him. But he will reveal himself the second she turns on the head and reattached body and sees through his game. Which doesn't take her long once they leave. She ends up frozen, we don't know where she wakes up but it seems David has actually fulfilled her wish and took her to Paradise, instead of going home which was the headless David's desire. However, he just wanted her aboard the craft for the same reason he wanted her before. He'll try to infect her again. Holes have been left on purpose to be filled by the relaunching in a way that will massively change the plot and reveal more about the Engineers actually being the tall, pale, hybrid fish-monster, fish-human creating Atlanteans of the ancient myths. The real myths relate them closer to the idea of ancient astronauts, not actual mermaids. The important thing is that they created mermaids, and other hybrid serpent monsters, went against the titans and gods in the greek myths, hd dealings with prometheus, and created the first earth humans who are basically us but precede us. The movie's been constructed in a way to not give away certain things yet but the hints are there and all over the themes of the movie. the twin snake theme and how that ties into advanced science, which the atlanteans had on their mythic island before it inevitably was swallowed by the ocean and their paradise was lost. However some remained and helped humans develop. Every culture referenced also has myths about Atlantis... they're one and the same as the Engineers which will be revealed in Paradise. They are definitely not gods. That island was on Earth or another watery planet 350 million years ago, and Atlantis was just a colony, an earth kingdom of a much larger empire. What we saw was humanity created as a byproduct of the way they start early colonies or kingdoms for their empires on other worlds. Our planet rebelled against the larger empire and their kingdoms were purposely flooded by atmospheric altering, with some left chained to this rock and punished from above repeatedly throughout the many ice ages, plagues and floods caused from above. Expect the sequel to deal heavily with misinterpretation of ancient events/myths, flooding of actual planets, and the flooding of information/theories to confuse things even more while actually offering up some answers and connecting to the mythic/religious themes even more, but in a way not expected. The Elder engineers and their enemies had been using floods and the bioweapons to wipe out planets. Floods and iceages to wipe all traces of civilization they may have left. Some stayed near or on earth after Atlantis sunk for a very, very long time and never rejoined the greater empire, explaining the message changing. But the bioweapon became altered by the flood on the \"home\" planet Shaw and David splash down on, or possibly during a flood on ancient earth before it was brought to the outpost to be hybridized further. To attempt to control it but that never works out I expect the relaunching and sequel to show us what this other David was doing aside from being briefly seen waking up others in cryosleep behind the David you know about so far. As well as maybe a bit more about the Elders and the aquatic-like traces in the genetics of this alien breed. Plus possibly a little more about the true nature of the Engineeers via Holloway's cut lines and anything that happens in the rest of the sequel (why they as the Atlanteans lost their Paradise on earth and on the \"home\" world) and to whom they lost their empire to, and were at war with."
