        "text": "Pluton is one of the three Ancient Weapons, alongside Poseidon and Uranus. Pluton is a highly advanced warship capable of mass destruction, labeled the World's Worst Battleship (世界最悪の戦艦, Sekai Saiaku no Senkan?).[2][3] It was constructed long ago in the city of Water 7 in the Grand Line.[4][5] The battleship is said to be capable of destroying whole islands in a single shot[6] and is located deep beneath Mt. Fuji in Wano Country.[7]\n\nPluton was first mentioned by Crocodile when he questioned Nefertari Cobra of its whereabouts.[1] In the Water 7 Saga, its blueprints were an important item that served as the catalyst for the saga's events.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIt is supposed to be a large warship of some kind. Both Franky and Iceburg were shocked when seeing the blueprints, wondering how a ship like Pluton could be built in the first place. In the words of Tom, who was considered the best shipwright in the world, it is the most monstrous ship ever made in the history of ship building.[3] Not much else is known about it.\n\nAbilities and Powers[]\n\nPluton is the most powerful warship in the world.[8] The battleship is said to be capable of destroying whole islands in a single shot.[6] Whoever controlled the weapon had the potential to conquer the world and thus in the wrong hands it would be quite dangerous. Likewise, Pluton also had the ability to do much damage to the world. Furthermore, because the blueprints remained in existence even after the ship was built, whoever possessed the blueprints to the vessel would have the potential to build a fleet of vessels with the same destructive abilities as each other.\n\nThe blueprints had been preserved as a means of bringing Pluton back into existence should the world ever need it to fight the Ancient Weapons, including the original Pluton itself.[5] At this point, however, the blueprints are now destroyed while Pluton itself is still asleep.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPast[]\n\nEarly History[]\n\nPluton was designed and constructed on Water 7 during the Void Century, and became inactive after the war. As a reaction to the threat Pluton carried, the World Government used the existence of Pluton, Poseidon, and Uranus as the primary reason for banning Poneglyph research. What happened to it after the war has not yet been revealed, but the Poneglyph telling its location was hidden in the Arabasta Kingdom's royal tomb.[6][9] Pluton is currently buried deep beneath Mt. Fuji in Wano Country;[7] as the Arabasta Poneglyph details its location and the Poneglyphs are 800 years old, it is reasonable to assume that it has remained in Wano Country for the past 800 years.\n\nUnlike Poseidon, whose ability was passed down the Ryugu Kingdom royal family bloodline,[10] Pluton was said to be an actual object, meaning the only way a second instance could be created was by reconstruction. The weapon's blueprints were secretly kept in Water 7. These blueprints had been passed down in a line of incredible shipwrights for centuries before eventually falling into the hands of the legendary shipwright Tom. The duty of the shipwrights was to guard the blueprints and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Also, they were supposed to use them to construct a second Pluton should the first weapon ever be revived.[5]\n\nSpandam's Plot[]\n\nTen years before the current storyline, Spandam, the chief of CP5, appealed to the Five Elders to gain control of the Ancient Weapon in order to bring the Great Pirate Era to an end. His true intention, however, was to use its immense power to overthrow the government and rule the world himself. His research led him to Tom, from whom he demanded the blueprints. Tom feigned ignorance, but when Spandam left, he entrusted the blueprints to his apprentices, Iceburg and Cutty Flam, to ensure that they would not fall into the Government's hands.[3] Days later, when Spandam framed Tom and arrested him, and Cutty Flam suffered a seemingly fatal accident after pistol whipping Spandam, Iceberg alone kept the blueprints.[11]\n\nThree years later, during which Spandam had become chief of CP9, he sent four agents undercover into the city to locate and obtain the blueprints.[12]\n\nPassing on the Secret[]\n\nFour years after his assumed death, Cutty Flam, with his newly cyberized body returned to Water 7, and secretly met with Iceburg, who gave the blueprints to him for safekeeping. Iceburg requested Cutty Flam that he forgo using his real name but only go by the nickname that Iceburg had given him, Franky, and leave the island to ensure that the Government would never find the blueprints. Out of necessity to avoid being arrested, he followed the first part of the advice, but refused to leave the island, much to Iceburg's ire.[13]\n\nArabasta Saga[]\n\nArabasta Arc[]\n\nAt the same time that Franky received the blueprints, in another part of the world, Crocodile sought to gain control over this weapon. He struck a bargain with Nico Robin, the sole remaining person who could read the Poneglyph that told of Pluton's location, and formed the criminal organization Baroque Works to take over Arabasta in order to acquire the weapon. It took four years before the organization's purpose neared completion.[14]\n\nRobin forced King Cobra to lead her to the Poneglyph, but she lied to Crocodile about what it said.[15] Crocodile easily saw through Robin's deception and stabbed her, having judged from Cobra's stunned reaction to his mentioning Pluton that the kingdom held the key to finding the weapon,[16] and resolved to seek it out on his own, though he was defeated by Luffy and arrested before he had the chance to do so.[17] The Poneglyph was later buried when the tomb collapsed.\n\nWater 7 Saga[]\n\nWater 7 Arc[]\n\nWhen the Straw Hat Pirates reached Water 7, the CP9 agents who had been undercover in the city for five years made their move, capturing Robin, who had joined the Straw Hat Pirates, and attempting to assassinate Iceburg while obtaining the blueprints. Upon discovering that the blueprints Iceburg held were fakes, they confronted the mayor, and confirmed their hypothesis that Franky had the blueprints, having discerned his true identity thanks to a passing comment when he returned to the city.[12][18] They captured Franky, and took both him and Robin to Enies Lobby. En route, Franky learned that the rumors about Robin were untrue, and that she had no desire to revive the weapons.[19]\n\nEnies Lobby Arc[]\n\nNot much later, Franky witnessed the Straw Hats infiltrate Enies Lobby and declare war on the World Government for Robin's sake, hammering it home that she was one of them. Seeing this, Franky revealed the blueprints, having kept them in his body the whole time, and then incinerated them right in front of Spandam, thus eliminating the option of building a countermeasure for the real weapon if it were ever revived.[5]\n\nWano Country Saga[]\n\nWano Country Arc[]\n\nAfter inspecting the Poneglyph in the basement of the shogun's castle, Robin talked with the former shogun, Kouzuki Sukiyaki, and revealed that the Poneglyph in Arabasta said that Pluton was in Wano Country, which Sukiyaki confirmed.[20] Sukiyaki escorted Robin and Trafalgar Law down a secret staircase to a cavern at the base of Mt. Fuji and near the ancient settlement of Wano. He informed them that Pluton was buried further beneath Mt. Fuji and that the walls around the country would need to be removed in order to retrieve the battleship.[21]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nPluton (Πλούτων) is the Roman name for the Greek god of the underworld Hades (ᾍδης); known as Dis Pater in Rome.\n\nIn the anime-only special 3D2Y, another ship was shown with the power to destroy whole islands, the Groseade, though only with the assistance of Byrnndi World's Devil Fruit power, the Moa Moa no Mi. World used his abilities to enlarge the cannonballs fired from the ship's main cannon to such enormity that the destructive impact from one could blow up an entire island.\n\nSo far, Pluton was the only known Ancient Weapon capable of being reproduced, due to the blueprints, until Franky destroyed them.\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nMajor Events:Literature:\n\nSignificant FiguresArchaeologists:Explorers and Pioneers:Pirates:Marines:World Government:Leaders/Royalty:Holy Figures:Animals:Fictional:Misc.:\n\nVoid CenturyAncient Weapons:\n\nPluton\n\nPoseidon\n\nUranus\n\nArtifacts:Great War:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Locations:Other Artifacts:Others:\n\nPirate Ships:Government Ships:Other Ships:Dial-Powered Ships:Sea Trains:Non-Canon Ships:Other:\n\nRelated ArticlesTerms:\n\nSwords and Bladed WeaponsSwords:Other Blade Weapons:Related:\n\nProjectile WeaponsFirearms:Artillery:Slingshots:Ammo:Others:\n\nOther WeaponsAncient Weapons:\n\nPluton\n\nPoseidon\n\nUranus\n\nNon-Bladed Polearms:Cyborgs:Chemical Weapons:Mechas:Robots (Non-Canon)≠:Others:\n\nRoyal Family:Palace Staff:Suna Suna Clan and Rebels:Rainbase:Other Citizens:Citizens (Non-Canon):\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapons Based:Support:\n\nRelated ArticlesLocations:Groups:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Specials:Others:\n\nCitizens:Former Citizens:Non-Canon Citizens:\n\nAbi\n\nAobire (Deceased)†\n\nAunt\n\nAkihiro\n\nAyako\n\nSho\n\nYoko\n\nYuya\n\nBanban\n\nHatsu\n\nNiina\n\nYuka\n\nZona Anes (Former)‡\n\nLucie\n\nShironyan\n\nKuronyan\n\nHien\n\nTorva\n\nLylat\n\nGannot (Former)‡\n\nTobo (Former)‡\n\nMahy\n\nEmily (Hysteria only)*\n\nGulf (Hysteria only)*\n\nGarays (Hysteria only)*\n\nGarz (Hysteria only)*\n\nGarth (Hysteria only)*\n\nGaron (Hysteria only)*\n\nArsel (Hysteria only)*\n\nSargus (Hysteria only)*\n\nBulmatte (Alternate Memoria only)*\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesOrganizations:Locations:Sea Trains:Ships:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Other:\n\nMembers:Sea Trains:\n\nAbilitiesWeapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arc(s):Locations:Other:"
