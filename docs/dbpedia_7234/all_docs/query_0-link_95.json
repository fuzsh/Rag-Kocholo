        "text": "tbd Pachinko - Trailer\n\nDrama: Widely praised when it debuted in 2022, Apple's epic family drama series adapted from Min Jin Lee's novel finally returns for its second season today. Once again, the action takes place in multiple time periods, countries, and languages (Korean, Japanese, and English) as it traces the story of multiple generations of a Korean family throughout the 20th century. New episodes stream weekly through October 11.Apple TV+ tbd Only Murders in the Building - Trailer\n\nComedy: Picking up following the events of last year's finale, which ended with the murder of Sazz (Jane Lynch), the fourth season of Hulu's hit murder mystery comedy series finds our trio of amateur sleuths/podcasters (played once again by Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez) heading across the country to Los Angeles as they investigate Sazz's death. In Hollywood, they'll also encounter the filming of a movie adaptation of their podcast in which the trio is portrayed by Eugene Levy (as Charles), Zach Galifianakis (as Oliver), and Eva Longoria (as Mabel). Other newcomers this season include Molly Shannon, Melissa McCarthy, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Kind, and Desmin Borges, while Meryl Streep will return from Season 3. Hulu tbd Kaos Trailer\n\nComedy/Drama/Fantasy: A new series from The End of the F***g World creator Charlie Covell, KAOS is an irreverent take on the world of Greek mythology. Jeff Goldblum stars as the cruel, paranoid, and neurotic god Zeus, who worries (correctly) that his reign may be coming to an end, while Janet McTeer plays his increasingly independent wife (and sister) Hera, and Stephen Dillane portrays the imprisoned Prometheus, who hatches a plan to take down Zeus. Eight episodes stream today.Netflix tbd Terminator Zero Trailer\n\nAnime: Netflix's latest original anime series is set in Japan in both 2022 and 1997 and takes place in the world of the Terminator movies but features all new characters. (And, with Japan being a gun-free country, they may have an especially tough time battling killing machines from the future.) The series comes from writer Matt Tomlin (The Batman), while the animation comes from the Japanese studio behind Ghost in the Shell. Timothy Olyphant heads the voice cast, which also includes Rosario Dawson, Ann Dowd, Andre Holland, and Sonoya Mizuno. All eight episodes stream today.Netflix tbd English Teacher Trailer\n\nComedy: Created by and starring Brian Jordan Alvarez, FX's new workplace comedy centers on a high school teacher in Austin. Jonathan Krisel (Portlandia, Baskets) and Paul Simms (What We Do in the Shadows, Atlanta) are producers on the series, which also stars Enrico Colantoni, Sean Patton, Langston Kerman, and Stephanie Koenig. The first two (of eight) episodes air back-to-back tonight and stream tomorrow on Hulu.FX 10p\n\nHulu (9/3)Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist Trailer\n\nDrama: A fictionalized retelling of an intriguing true-crime tale adapted from the Will Packer-produced podcast Fight Night, this eight episode miniseries is set in Atlanta in 1970. As a hustler known as Chicken Man (Kevin Hart) hosts a wealthy crowd at a party celebrating Muhammad Ali's return to the ring, a brazen armed robbery takes place. When the cops suspect Chicken Man of masterminding the crime, he must clear his name—changing the future of the Atlanta in the process. An impressive cast also includes Samuel L. Jackson, Don Cheadle, Taraji P. Henson, and Terrence Howard, while Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) directs four of the episodes.Peacock tbd The Perfect Couple Trailer\n\nDrama: Adapted from the Elin Hilderbrand novel of the same name, this six-part Netflix original from Jenna Lamia (Good Girls) is set during a busy Fourth of July weekend on Nantucket when a ritzy wedding involving a wealthy family is upended by the discovery of a dead body in the harbor. Nicole Kidman, Liev Schreiber, Dakota Fanning, Eve Hewson, Billy Howle, Omar Epps, Jack Reynor, and Meghann Fahy star. Susanne Bier (The Night Manager) directs the series in its entirety.NetflixUniversal Basic Guys Trailer Animation/Comedy: Originally ordered in 2022 (and already picked up for a second season), the latest entry into Fox's Animation Domination block comes from Adam and Craig Malamut (Sports Friends) and follows two brothers who are out of work after being replaced at the hot dog factory by robots. But there's good news: They qualify for a new basic income program guaranteeing them $3,000 a month with no strings attached. How do they use their free time and money? Probably not well.\n\n*Tonight's episode (followed by Bob's Burgers) begins immediately following NFL coverage live in all time zones.Fox 8p ET*Three Women Trailer\n\nDrama: Originally ordered by Showtime (in 2019!) but later jettisoned in a cost-cutting move, this 10-episode adaptation of the book by Lisa Taddeo stars Shailene Woodley, Betty Gilpin, DeWanda Wise, Blair Underwood, and Gabrielle Creevy. Woodley plays a writer who convinces three \"ordinary\" women to share their stories about how they radically overhauled their lives in different ways.Starz 10p tbd American Sports Story: Aaron Hernandez Trailer\n\nDrama: The first season of Ryan Murphy's latest FX anthology series offers a fictionalized retelling of the rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez, the one-time NFL star for the New England Patriots who was later convicted of murder and died in prison in 2017. Adapted from the Boston Globe/Wondery podcast Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez and Football Inc., the season stars Josh Andrés Rivera (West Side Story) as Hernandez alongside Patrick Schwarzenegger as Tim Tebow and Norbert Leo Butz as Bill Belichick. The first two (of 10) episodes air tonight and stream tomorrow on Hulu.FX 10p\n\nHulu (9/18)High Potential\n\nDrama/Comedy: Adapted from a French series called HIP—High Intellectual Potential (which you can find streaming on Hulu), ABC's new detective dramedy stars Kaitlin Olson (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as a single mom who works as a janitor at a police precinct. After she speaks up to help solve a tricky case, the police enlist her as a consultant and team her with a by-the-book (what else?) detective played by Daniel Sunjata. The adaptation comes from Drew Goddard (The Good Place) but no longer has Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas as showrunner; he was replaced a few months ago by Todd Harthan (The Resident). ABC 10pAgatha All Along Trailer\n\nComedy/Drama/Sci-fi: In development for three years under at least five different potential titles, this WandaVision spinoff finds Katherine Hahn reprising her Emmy-nominated role as New Jersey witch Agatha Harkness, who seeks to regain her powers after losing them in the prior series. Also starring in this latest MCU series (which comes, like WandaVision before it, from Jac Schaeffer) are Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke, Sasheer Zamata, Patti LuPone, and Debra Jo Rupp. The first two of nine episodes stream tonight, and Agatha won't be the only WandaVision spinoff: Another centering on Paul Bettany's Vision is due in 2026.Disney+ 9p ET / 6p PT tbd Frasier\n\nComedy: The revived Kelsey Grammer comedy returns with the first two episodes of its second season today. Guests this season include Peri Gilpin (returning from the original series as Roz)—plus familiar faces from the KACL studio, which Frasier will visit in one episode—along with Patricia Heaton, Amy Sedaris, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Rachel Bloom.Paramount+The Penguin Trailer\n\nDrama: Originally a Max series but now bearing the HBO brand, this long-in-development DC Comics project is a spinoff from Matt Reeves' 2022 film The Batman and returns Colin Farrell as mob boss Oswald Cobblepot, aka The Penguin. Also starring in the eight-episode miniseries, which picks up shortly following the events of the film with Gotham still under water, are Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Michael Kelly, Carmen Ejogo, and Clancy Brown. The series comes from writer/showrunner Lauren LeFranc (Agents of SHIELD, Chuck)—though Reeves is among the producers—while Craig Zobel (Mare of Easttown) directs the first three episodes. Note that the the next episode will not air until Sunday 9/29 at 9p (the show's regular timeslot moving forward). HBO 9p\n\nMaxA Very Royal Scandal\n\nDrama: The production team behind the recent limited series A Very English Scandal and A Very British Scandal return with a three-part dramatization of the events surrounding an infamous 2019 interview between a scandal-plagued Prince Andrew (Michael Sheen) and journalist Emily Maitlis (Ruth Wilson). If that sounds vaguely familiar, it might be because Netflix already aired a different dramatization of the interview earlier this year (though this new series, made with the input of the real-life Maitlis, will center more on her than on the disgraced prince). All three episodes stream today.Prime Video tbd His Three Daughters Trailer\n\nDrama: Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne, and Elizabeth Olsen star as three very different sisters who come together in the final days of their father's life. Azazel Jacobs (French Exit) writes and directs the drama, which received excellent reviews at TIFF in 2023 and which will also receive a limited theatrical release beginning September 6. NetflixMatlock\n\nDrama: Kathy Bates stars in a remake of the 1980s legal drama (you know, the one that starred whatshisname from The Andy Griffith Show). Beau Bridges, Jason Ritter, and Skye P. Marshall also star. Tonight's airing is a special sneak preview of the first episode (which will repeat on Oct. 10); the series returns for its regular run on 10/17 at 9p.CBS 8pRescue HI-Surf Trailer\n\nDrama: It's basically Baywatch in high-definition but minus The Hoff. So ... a wash? It's also set in O'ahu and is produced by John Wells (ER, The West Wing)—so expect an approach that's a bit more serious and slightly more realistic—but the fact that we're not listing the cast means that you probably wouldn't recognize the names. (Either that or we're simply lazy.) Another episode airs tomorrow at 8p, the show's regular Monday timeslot going forward.\n\n* Tonight's episode airs live in all time zones immediately following NFL coverage.Fox 8p ET*Murder in a Small Town Trailer\n\nDrama: Fox's newest drama series centers on a series of arsons in a mid-sized city. (Double-checking our notes ... Oh, we really got that one wrong.) Kristin Kreuk, Rossif Sutherland, James Cromwell, and Stana Katic star in the adaptation of L.R. Wright's Karl Alberg books that follows a big-city police detective relocating to a quiet Pacific Northwest coastal town, where he can't quite escape the need to solve murders. Lots and lots of murders. Tonight's premiere runs 90 minutes; subsequent episodes air Tuesdays at 9p starting 10/1.Fox 8p tbd Nobody Wants This\n\nComedy: Kristen Bell and Adam Brody play an outspoken, agnostic woman and an unconventional rabbi—you'll have to match the actor to the role on your own—who begin an unlikely romance in a loosely autobiographical comedy series from Erin Foster in her debut as series creator. Also produced by Modern Family's Steven Levitan, the series also counts Succession's Justine Lupe and Veep's Timothy Simons among its regulars.
