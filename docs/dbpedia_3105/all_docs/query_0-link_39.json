        "text": "Auntie Mame is a 1958 American Technirama Technicolor comedy film based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Edward Everett Tanner III (under the pseudonym Patrick Dennis) and its 1956 theatrical adaptation by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee. This film version stars Rosalind Russell and was directed by Morton DaCosta. Not to be confused with a musical version of the story, that appeared on Broadway in 1966, and was later made into a 1974 film Mame starring Lucille Ball as the title character.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nMame is an unconventional individualist socialite from the roaring 20's. When her brother dies, she is forced to raise her nephew Patrick. However, Patrick's father has designated an executor to his will to protect the boy from absorbing too much of Mame's rather unconventional perspective. Patrick and Mame become devoted to each other in spite of this restriction, and together journey through Patrick's childhood and the great depression, amidst some rather zaney adventures.\n\nMovie Trailer[]\n\nSound Effects Used[]\n\nH-B GULP, CARTOON - SPEEDY'S GULP, SWALLOW\n\nSound Ideas, CARTOON, CYMBAL - CRASH CYMBAL HIT, PERCUSSION, MUSIC\n\nSound Ideas, CRASH, CARTOON - LARGE METAL AND DEBRIS CRASH 01\n\nWB CARTOON, ROOSTER - MORNING CALL, ANIMAL\n\nImage Gallery[]"
