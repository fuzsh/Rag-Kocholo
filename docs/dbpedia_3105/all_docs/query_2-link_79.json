        "text": "The unlikely story of how a character actress became a Broadway leading lady.\n\nBack in October of this year we lost a beloved star of the stage and screen, Angela Lansbury. With a performing career that spanned 80 years, she received six Tony Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and one Laurence Olivier Award — that was in addition to nominations for a Grammy, three Oscars, and 18 Emmy Awards. That’s right, she was nominated 18 times for an Emmy over the course of 33 years and didn’t win one of them.\n\nBut with all her years in movies and television, the theater was really her first love. Lansbury appeared in 14 Broadway productions and four national tours from 1957 to 2012. Although Hotel Paradiso was her Broadway debut, it was another show almost ten years later that would cement her theater career and earn her that first Tony Award. But getting there certainly wasn’t easy.\n\nBetween the four of us, we put it across with the producers that I would play [Mame]. There were many very exotic ladies who were up for the part, let me tell you, and it was an extraordinary breakthrough for me.\n\n~ Angela Lansbury (MasterWorks)\n\nThe Legend of Auntie Mame is Born\n\nSince 1955, Auntie Mame has been the unstoppable, passionate, easily distracted, yet thoroughly down-to-earth personification of an aunt any child would love to have. The novel that introduced her to the world was written by Edward Everett Tanner III, who wrote under the pseudonym Patrick Dennis. This also happens to be the name of the orphaned 10-year-old boy in the book, who comes to live with his aunt on the eve of the Great Depression.\n\nTanner’s manuscript was actually rejected by 19 publishers before Vanguard Press finally gave it the green light. And that decision really paid off — Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade was on the New York Times bestseller list for two years. The 1955 novel inspired a Broadway play the following year, a movie based on that play in 1958, a Broadway musical in 1966, and another movie based on the musical in 1974.\n\nThat original Broadway play and its subsequent movie starred Rosalind Russell, who already had three Oscar nominations under her belt, but it was Auntie Mame that made her into a superstar and is arguably the role she is most known for in her career.\n\nSo based on the success of the Broadway play and that movie, playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee began work on musicalizing their play in 1964. And so they approached composer Jerry Herman, who was already enjoying a huge success with another musical at that time.\n\nHello, Dolly! was running on Broadway, and I got a call from Lawrence and Lee, the wonderful writers of Inherit The Wind and Auntie Mame, and I had never met these gentleman, and they asked if I would mind having lunch with them. And I was absolutely thrilled because I love those two plays. And we went to Sardi’s, and after a few minutes of conversation, one of them said to me, “How would you like to musicalize Auntie Mame?” And again, I didn’t have to think or say, “Oh, I’ll call my agent” or any of that business. I just went, “Oh boy, yes!” It was such an instantaneous love affair that I had with this piece of work, because I honestly could have written seven or eight more songs for this character.\n\n- Jerry Herman (NPR)\n\nThe musical was originally titled My Best Girl. And from the get-go, these creatives were determined that this show wasn’t going to just be Auntie Mame with music. As Jerome Lawrence said, “We conceived Mame as a new work and tried to tell it as lyrically and joyfully as possible with music.“\n\nNonetheless, Rosalind Russell was the first one offered the role of musical Mame, but she turned it down because she didn’t want to “eat yesterday’s stew,” as she put it. So then it was decided that legendary leading lady Mary Martin would take on the role. Joshua Logan was brought in as the director, but he wanted to make significant changes to the story, and then other artistic differences came up between the creatives, including Onna White, who had been tapped as the show’s choreographer. So Logan was dismissed and would eventually be replaced with Gene Saks.\n\nAnd to complicate matters even more, Mary Martin ended up declining to do the show, offering the excuse that the score failed to captivate her…or maybe she was just ready for a break from the stage after years of back to back Broadway productions of South Pacific, Peter Pan, and The Sound of Music. But whatever the reason, Lawrence, Lee, and Herman now had to find a new leading lady.\n\nA veritable list of of Who’s Who in show business auditioned for the role, including Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Doris Day, Phyllis Diller, Katherine Hepburn, Lena Horne, and Dinah Shore just to name a few. But something seemed to be missing from each one of them. As Jerry Herman put it: Mame is a deceptively difficult role to play.\n\nShe’s so rich and she’s so full of fun and she has her problems and her romance and her disappointments, and it was just everything that a songwriter dreams about being offered.\n\n- Jerry Herman (NPR)\n\nThe juxtaposition of this elegant, charming lady with an undercurrent of wild, unpredictable humor and spunk was not a combination easy to find in most actresses. So after exhausting their list of leading lady contenders, Jerome Lawrence suggests an actress that lived down the road from him in Malibu: Angela Lansbury.\n\nLawrence and Lee asked me to come and have brunch with them in Malibu. So I did. And they were very, very, I don’t know — they certainly gave me the idea that they thought that I could play Mame. And all I could think of was, why would you think I could play Mame, you know?\n\n- Angela Lansbury (MasterWorks)\n\nThe 1963–64 Broadway Season Was Exceptional\n\nNot only were the likes of Carol Burnett, Sammy Davis Jr, and Josephine Baker starring in hit productions, but that season also ushered in Barefoot in the Park, 110 in the Shade, One Flew Over the Cuckoo‘s Nest, Hello Dolly, Funny Girl, and Anyone Can Whistle.\n\nIn fact, Funny Girl and Anyone Can Whistle were both related in some very remarkable ways. For example, Stephen Sondheim was actually approached to write the score for Funny Girl, but turned it down because their choice of leading lady, Mary Martin, wasn’t Jewish, but eventually she turned down the role of Fanny Brice (just like she later did with Mame). For his part, Sondheim chose instead to focus on his own musical Anyone Can Whistle, which cast Angela Lansbury in the leading role of Cora and offered the supporting role of Fay to Barbra Streisand, who turned down that show to instead star in Funny Girl. (What a life-changing and career-defining choice that turned out to be, huh?) Well, for Angela Lansbury Anyone Can Whistle was her big break as well, because it was her very first starring role in a Broadway musical.\n\nNobody had ever seen Angela Lansbury on stage singing, dancing, playing a leading role, and they didn’t know whether I could do it, didn’t know I could do it, didn’t know I had the capacity of the voice or anything else.\n\n-Angela Lansbury (Television Academy)\n\nWell, it turns out Lansbury did have the capacity and got favorable reviews for her part, but the show itself was not well-received and Anyone Can Whistle only lasted nine performances on Broadway. Still, even during that limited run, a certain composer by the name of Jerry Herman happened to be in attendance one night.\n\nSo months later when Jerome Lawrence suggested Lansbury for the part of Mame, Herman was ecstatic with the idea. Yet when he brought her name up to the producers, they weren’t so keen on the idea. Two of them had also seen Lansbury’s performance in Anyone Can Whistle, and though they thought she was a wonderful character actress, they just didn’t think she could sing the part or handle the musical comedy required for Mame. Plus, director Joshua Logan didn’t want her either, but he wasn’t with the show for long, so eventually his opinion wouldn’t matter.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine now, but back then Lansbury didn’t have the star power theater producers wanted. According to her agent, Charles Adams Baker, Lansbury had a reputation in Hollywood and on Broadway as everybody’s favorite coworker but NOT a ticket-seller. However, Jerry Herman kept on insisting and finally convinced the producers to bring Lansbury in for an audition.\n\nAngela Lansbury Finally Auditions\n\nJerry Herman: I wanted Angela very much because I wanted an actress to do that role and I sensed the need for an actress.\n\nAngela Lansbury: He said, I’ll do everything I can in my power to help you to audition. We’ll do it together. I’ll play for you. I’ll be there and I want you to get this part. I believe that you’re Mame.\n\nJerry Herman: I had Angela come to my apartment, and I taught her two songs from the score. And no other lady who auditioned had the benefit of knowing “If He Walked Into My Life” and “It’s Today.” And when we went to the theater to audition, I snuck into the orchestra pit without anybody knowing, and I accompanied her audition.\n\n(from a 1984 interview on 20/20)\n\nOne of the show’s producers, John Bowab, recalls that the audition showed her strong personality and pizzazz. But ultimately she didn’t seem to have the vocal range for the score. Sensing this, Lansbury returned to California after the audition and began vocal training to help her add more notes and expand her singing range. She was determined, and wanted this role as much if not more than anything else she’d done up to that point.\n\nI knew that I could do it. I just knew I could do it. To make it happen took me more persuasion and more time and more, well, humbling myself really to get that part. It’s the one time in my career that I’ve done that, and I did it for Mame, because I knew Mame was a key that would unlock a whole new career for me and get me out of this kind of doldrums of cameo parts that I was locked into for so many years.\n\n- Angela Lansbury (1985 interview)\n\nLansbury would go on to audition for the role two more times, going back-and-forth between New York and California. And during that time, the creative team continued to audition other actresses like Lauren Bacall, Kaye Ballard, Tammy Grimes, Geraldine Page, and Bea Arthur, the wife of the show’s new director, Gene Saks.\n\nWell, four months after Lansbury‘s first audition, she flew back to New York to meet Gene Saks for what would be her fourth and final audition. That’s because she gave the producers an ultimatum, saying that this would be her last audition and that she needs a yes or no answer before going back to California. So after a lengthy casting search and Lansbury‘s mandate, it finally came down to a vote, and thankfully the majority wanted Angela Lansbury for the role of Mame.\n\n“I was ready for it. It was everything that I had envisioned for myself accomplishing in the musical theater, because what I haven’t told you is that all during the years at MGM, when I was battling along, playing battle axes and so on, I was running in and watching rehearsals, all of the musical rehearsals for the great musical movies that were being made on the lot at that time with Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, all those, and I knew all of the musical people involved, and I thought, “Oh gosh, this is it. This is what I really wanna be doing. This is what I’m gonna really love to do one day.” And I really visualized myself doing it until I did — I found myself up on the stage playing Mame.” — Angela Lansbury\n\nMame was so joyous an experience, because we had a great new star in Angela Lansbury and everything went right.\n\n- Jerry Herman (Musical Theater Guild)\n\nShortly after the musical opened in May of 1966, Lansbury won the Tony Award for Best Actress and ended up staying with the show almost two years on Broadway, before heading off on a limited tour of the show. The popularity of Mame continued for another two years with various actresses, including Janis Page, Jane Morgan, and Ann Miller, until it closed in January 1970 after 1,508 performances.\n\nNews sources and research came from the following:\n\n“Look Back at Angela Lansbury in the Original Broadway Production of Mame” — Playbill\n\n“How Angela Became Mame” — Medium\n\nBut Darling, I’m Your Auntie Mame! by Richard Tyler Jordan (2004)\n\nAnyone Can Whistle — Wikipedia\n\nMame — Wikipedia"
