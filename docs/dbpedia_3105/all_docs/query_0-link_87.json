        "text": "Cast and Crew: Morton DaCosta (Director, Producer); Patrick Dennis (Novel); Betty Comden and Adolph Green (Screenplay); Forrest Tucker, Patrick Knowles, Henry Brandon, Gloria Holden, Dub Taylor\n\nWhat It’s About: When Patrick Dennis’s (Roger Smith and Jan Handzlik), he is put in the care of his only living relative, his eccentric Aunt Mame (Rosalind Russell). Patrick’s father’s will stipulates that the executor of the estate, Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), will arrange for Patrick’s education, in order to shield Patrick from Mame’s excesses. Patrick and his maid Nora (Connie Gilchrist) arrive at Mame’s during a raging party. Although Mame initially fools Babcock, when Babcock discovers that Mame has enrolled Patrick in a nudist school he sends the boy off to a prestigious boarding school, and the battle between the Dwights of the world and Mame commences.\n\nWhy Watch it Today?: Rosalind Russell died on this date in 1976. Russell’s long career included classic Screwball comedies like His Girl Friday, but she also had a long and successful stage career. She originated the role of Auntie Mame on Broadway and was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in today’s Movie."
