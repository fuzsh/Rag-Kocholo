        "text": "Rosalind Russell is the best-known person to come from my hometown of Waterbury, Connecticut. She was born there in 1907 - or thereabouts, as she later began shaving some years off her age - and grew up in a large Victorian house near downtown that's today a funeral parlor. She made only a few short visits back to Waterbury after making it big. Possibly for that reason, there's nothing in Waterbury to commemorate her.\n\nOther Waterbury natives of note include Watergate judge John Sirica, pioneering AIDS researcher Robert Gallo, and Harry Daghlian, a Los Alamos scientist who in 1945 was the first fatality from a nuclear accident."
