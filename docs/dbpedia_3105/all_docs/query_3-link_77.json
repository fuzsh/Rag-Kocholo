        "text": "“Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!” – Auntie Mame (Rosalind Russell)\n\nWith larger-than-life excitement, Rosalind Russell exclaims, “Darling! I’m your Auntie Mame!” and welcomes her recently orphaned nephew — and the audience — into her open arms.\n\nThat’s how Patrick Dennis’ adventures begin in Auntie Mame, which documents the boy’s adventures living with an free-spirited, avant-garde relative through the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s. Russell plays Mame, who encourages her nephew to try new things, ask questions and drink in as much fun and education from the life going on around him. The executor of his father’s will, Mr. Babcock (Fred Clark) isn’t pleased, however, and tries to put an end to her influence on Patrick.\n\nThe movie’s message is clear — get as much out of life as you can, and don’t worry about tomorrow. Of course, that doesn’t always work out for Mame and Patrick. The stock market crash wipes their bank accounts clean, but the friendships Mame has cultivated get them through (the maid and butler stay because of how good she’s been to them). When grown-up Patrick (Roger Smith) threatens to burn the bridges Mame has set up for him in favor of a “top-drawer” fiancee (Joanna Barnes), she assembles all of the people from his past for a party that reminds him that he wouldn’t be the person he is without mingling with society’s less acceptable creatures.\n\nAnd yet, those social misfits (including a progressive teacher, failing actress, unwed mother-to-be secretary and lovable publisher) are key to the fun of the story. Russell’s performance is possibly the greatest of her career, partly because the actors around her leave enough room to let her be wild. The audience is like Patrick, edging the room as Auntie flashes her jingling bracelets and cackles at inappropriate jokes. In fact, the only thing she finds inappropriate is what everyone else considers normal — public education, family businesses, traditional weddings and tasteful decorating.\n\nThe latter is where Auntie Mame capitalizes on cinema’s budget and space. The 1958 film, based on Patrick Dennis’ novel and the 1956 stage play, pulls in theatrical style in its act-by-act structure but goes full-blown Cinemascope with the color and drama of its sets. Mame’s apartment changes act by act, encapsulating the character’s eclectic but erratic personality. Even the pastoral Upson house is outrageous, but on a far less sophisticated style — and Mame isn’t afraid to point that out.\n\nMame borders on motherhood and aunthood in that way. She’s open to criticism and criticizing like a mother, but dotes on her nephew without concern for how he’ll turn out in the end. And when he starts to fall into the trap of the mediocre, like a mother she herds him back — with an aunt’s sense of humor. On the face of it, Auntie Mame is the story of a woman trying to raise a boy to be open to the world as the world continues to be closed to her sense of adventure. At its core, however, is the experience of a woman well-suited to be a mother but even better equipped to be “Auntie.”"
