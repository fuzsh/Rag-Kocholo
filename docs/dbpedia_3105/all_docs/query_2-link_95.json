        "text": "U.S., 1958\n\nDirected by Morton DaCosta\n\nWritten by Betty Comden, and Adolph Green\n\nStarring Rosalind Russell, Forrest Tucker, Coral Browne\n\nBased on the novel by Patrick Dennis\n\nApprox 143 min. DCP.\n\n“Rosalind Russell gives the performance of her life, recreating her famous stage role as a madcap Roaring Twenties eccentric who lives life to the fullest. Based on Patrick Dennis’s autobiographical novel, Mame’s colorful antics are seen through the eyes of her orphaned 10-year-old nephew, Patrick, whose life becomes a whirlwind of parties with his Auntie’s bohemian friends, much to the consternation of the conservative trustee (Fred Clark) of the boy’s estate.” – Leonard Maltin’s Family Film Guide\n\nWith support from the Robert Jolin Osborne Endowed Fund for American Classic Cinema of the 1930s, ‘40s, and ‘50s and the Ada Katz Fund for Literature in Film.\n\nReviews"
