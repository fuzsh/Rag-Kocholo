        "text": "Starring the incomparable Rosalind Russell (ie the star of His Girl Friday and many other fast talking classics), Auntie Mame is a long time personal favorite. Initially set during the Prohibition era, the film follows bohemian socialite Mame Dennis, who is granted custody of her orphaned nephew Patrick. Together the unlikely duo survive the Great Depression, a failed theater career, and ill-fated romantic relationships– all while Mame raucously encourages Patrick and viewers at home to LIVE, LIVE, LIVE.\n\nOriginally written for the stage (also starring Russell), Auntie Mame is still structured a bit like a play– strategically placed spotlights accentuate the end of “acts”, and the often lavish sets look like they would fit in perfectly on Broadway. Costumes are both beautiful and hilariously employed, and the constantly changing “lewks” Mame explores are as fun to watch as her repeat apartment remodels. But while Mame is a bit of a flake in many regards, she quickly proves to be an A+ mom to her saccharine little nephew, guiding him away from those with “braces on their brains”. Yes, there are admittedly some problematic scenes/character interactions, but it’s not a surprise to me that Auntie Mame has been praised and embraced by the LGBTQ community– above all, Mame embodies adventure, originality, acceptance, and unbridled joy. If you’re looking for an upper this New Year’s Eve (or on any night you feel like getting pleasantly sloshed), this is a solid pick.\n\nWith that said, I give you a cocktail menu inspired by Auntie Mame that Mame herself would certainly enjoy– mostly because it has tons of booze. It’s top drawer, I mean REALLY, top DRAWER!\n\nThe Movie\n\nThe Menu\n\nA Full Bar\n\nYield: 5 Cocktails\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 20 minutes\n\nBecause no amount of booze is too much for Mame Dennis.\n\nIngredients\n\nGin Martini, Extra Dry\n\n2 1/4 oz dry gin\n\n1 oz dry vermouth\n\n3 dashes Angostura orange bitters\n\nOlive to garnish (optional)\n\nDaiquiri, Sans Honey\n\n1 1/2 oz light rum\n\n3/4 oz freshly squeezed lime juice\n\n1/2 oz simple syrup\n\nAbsolutely NO honey\n\nlime slice twist, to garnish\n\nSpiked Dr. Pepper for Agnes\n\n2 oz Irish whiskey\n\nDr. Pepper Top Off\n\nMaraschino Cherry, for garnish\n\nChampagne Cocktail\n\nChampagne\n\n1 Sugar Cube per Flute\n\nDash of Bitters\n\nFlaming Mame\n\n1 1/2 oz blanco or silver tequila\n\n1 oz triple sec\n\n1 oz freshly squeezed lime juice\n\n1 tsp agave\n\n1/8 tsp Chile powder\n\ntajin, for the rim\n\nhollowed out lime end, with a bit more alcohol\n\nInstructions\n\nExtra Dry Gin Martini:\n\nChill your martini glass in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. Spill your vermouth into the glass and swish around to coat the inside of the glass.\n\nNext, combine bitters and gin in a large glass. Fill with ice and stir-- never shake. Bruises the gin. Stir for about 30 seconds and strain into your martini glass. Garnish with an olive if you like-- though Auntie Mame says olives take up too much room in such a little glass.\n\nA Better Upson Daiquiri, Sans Honey:\n\nAdd your ingredients to an ice filled cocktail shaker-- shake and strain into a cocktail glass (preferably chilled). Garnish with a twisted slice of lime.\n\nSpiked Dr. Pepper for Ms. Gooch:\n\nPour Dr. Pepper over Irish (ala Mr. O'BANNion) whiskey in a highball glass filled with ice-- top with a cherry, and avoid signing any marraige licenses.\n\nChampagne Cocktail for Auntie Veer--RAH:\n\nAdd a few dashes of bitters to a sugar cube in a champagne glass-- top with champers and pace yourself dammit.\n\nA Flaming Mame:\n\nSometimes Mame can be short for Margaret-- which is an easy move to Margarita. Good thing margs are also fun made spicy and lit on fire!\n\nRun a piece of lime around the rim of your martini glass and dip the rim into tajin to coat. Combine liquid ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until chilled-- pour over ice in your tajin-ed glass. Float your lime end in the top of your marg, pour a bit more booze inside it, and get lit!\n\nFishberry Jam Beggar's Purses\n\nYield: 6 purses\n\nCook Time: 15 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 15 minutes\n\n...ie caviar beggar's purses. If you can find/afford Osetra, you won't regret it.\n\nIngredients\n\nChive Crepes\n\n2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter\n\n1/2 cup whole milk\n\n1/4 cup flour\n\n1 egg\n\n1/8 tsp salt\n\n1 tbsp chopped chives\n\nFor Purses\n\n6 long chives\n\n6 tbsp creme fraiche\n\n3-4 oz caviar\n\nInstructions\n\nCollect your crepe ingredients!\n\nMelt butter in an 8 inch skillet over medium heat-- set aside 2 tbsp for cooking the crepes, and continue to cook the rest until it browns (just a couple of minutes). In a small food processor or blender, mix butter, milk, flour, egg, and salt until smooth. Add minced chives last, and pulse just to combine. Refrigerate batter for 30 mins.\n\nWhen ready, pour a bit of reserved butter into the same skillet and eat over medium-high. Lift the skillet away from the stove, and quickly pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter, tilting and rotating the pan to cover it's entire bottom. Place back over heat and continue to cook for about 30 seconds until the bottom edges start to turn golden brown.\n\nUsing a wide, pliable spatula and your fingers to help, flip the crepe over and continue to cook, another 30 or so seconds. Repeat 5 more times, leaving you with six roughly 6-inch crepes.\n\nMicrowave your long chives in a bit of water for 10-20 seconds until slightly softened. Then, dollop a tbsp of creme fraiche into the center of each crepe, followed by a heaping tsp of caviar. Wrap the crepe around the filling to create a purse, and tie with pliant chives.\n\nSprinkle remaining caviar into the crevices of your purse \"tops\" and serve immediately.\n\nPickled Rattlesnake Bites\n\nYield: 6 cheese balls\n\nA spicy riff on the Texas Roadhouse rattlesnack bite. Don't worry-- no actual rattlesnacks included.\n\nIngredients\n\nPickled Jalepenos\n\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n\n1/4 cup water\n\n1 small clove garlic, smashed\n\n1/2 tbsp sugar\n\n3/4 tsp salt\n\n2 jalapeño peppers, sliced 1/8 inch thick\n\nRattlesnake Bites\n\n3 oz monterey jack cheese\n\n3 oz pepper jack cheese\n\n1 1/2 oz cream cheese\n\n1/4 tsp paprika\n\n1/2 tsp garlic powder\n\n1/8 tsp cayenne pepper\n\n1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs, pulsed in a mini processor for a finer grain\n\n1/3 cup flour\n\n1 egg, beaten\n\n2-3 cups of oil for frying\n\nSiracha and Pickled Jalapeño for garnish\n\nInstructions\n\nBegin with your quick pickled jalepenos. Combine the vinegar, water, garlic, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pot and bring to a boil. Once the mixture is fully dissolved, add jalapeno slices and remove from heat. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to cool and transfer the jalepeno slices and brine to a container; cover with the brining liquid to fill the jar and store until ready to use-- you can store for up to two months.\n\nNext, collect your cheeseball ingredients:\n\nIn a medium bowl, toss your cheeses and seasonings together. Add cream cheese to the bowl and stir to completely mix. Shape into six balls about 1.5 inches in width, and refrigerate for 15 minutes while you set up your breading station of flour, breadcrumbs and beaten egg.\n\nRoll cheese balls first in egg, then flour, then egg again-- finally press each ball into your breadcrumbs coating completely.\n\nHeat oil in a small but deep skillet or saucepan -- oil should be at about 1 inch depth. Once oil reaches a temperature of about 350, drop in cheese balls 1-2 at a time. Fry until golden brown on both sides, rolling the balls around in the oil for roughly 3 minutes. Repeat with the remaining balls, draining each batch on a paper towel lined plate.\n\nServe hot, topped with stripes of siracha and a pickled jalepeno.\n\nTuna (Tataki) with Peanut Butter (Sauce)\n\nYield: 6 Hors D'oeuvres\n\nA more exotic and far superior version of Mrs. Upson's Upson Downs tuna fish and peanut butter appetizer. Auntie Mame would approve.\n\nIngredients\n\nPeanut Butter Sauce\n\n1/3 cup peanut butter\n\n2 tbsp rice vinegar\n\n2 1/2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari\n\n1 1/2 tbsp honey\n\n3/4 tsp grated ginger\n\n1 clove garlic\n\n1/8 tsp red pepper flakes\n\n1 tbsp water, to reach desired consistency\n\nTuna Tataki\n\n4 oz sushi grade ahi tuna steak at least 1 inch thick, cut into 1 inch thick rectangles\n\nsalt\n\n1/4 cup black and white sesame seeds\n\n2 tbsp neutral oil\n\n6 cucumber slices, about 1/2 inch thick\n\n6 tsps peanut sauce\n\nsliced scallions, for garnish\n\nInstructions\n\nStart by making your peanut butter sauce.\n\nAdd all ingredients to a bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nVery lightly salt your tuna steak rectangles, and then coat each side with mixed sesame seeds, pressing for good coverage.\n\nHeat oil in a small skillet on medium high/high, and sear tuna, about 30 seconds per each side. Your sesame seeds will turn a nice golden brown color.\n\nSlice tuna steaks into 6 pieces-- the tuna should still be pink inside. Add a dollop of peanut sauce to your cucumber rounds, and top with tuna.\n\nServe on toothpicks, garnished with sliced scallions.\n\nMatterhorn Cookies\n\nYield: 4 cookies\n\nFor those who prefer sweets to extreme heights (aka me), these coconuty confections are a perfect sweet treat to wrap up a coctail menu.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 egg whites\n\n1/4 tsp vanilla extract\n\n1/4 tsp almond extract\n\n1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar\n\n3/4 cups white sugar\n\n1/2 cup flour\n\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n\n1 cup flaked coconut\n\n1 cup white melting chocolate\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 325, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, and gather your ingredients.\n\nIn a medium bowl (either with a hand beater or stand mixer), beat egg whites, vanilla, almond extract, and ream of tartar until soft peaks form.\n\nGradually beat in sugar and whip until stiff.\n\nIn a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and coconut. Fold into the egg whites.\n\nDrop batter onto prepared cookie sheets-- you'll want four rounds about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, four 2 inch rounds, four 1 1/2 inch rounds, and four 1 inch mounded mountain \"toppers\".\n\nBake for 15-20 minutes, keeping a careful watch, until only very slightly golden. Remove from oven and, while they are still hot, layer your mounds biggest to smallest on top, to create your \"matterhorn mountains\".\n\nFinally, melt the white chocolate in a microwave in short bursts of 30 seconds, until melted. Drizzle over your cookie mountains, prefarably a bit neater than the ones show below.\n\nAllow the chocolate to dry, and serve--you can go by layer, or eat the whole damn thing.\n\nEpilogue\n\nFor the morning after– Auntie Mame’s best remedy for being hung, a black coffee and a sidecar. Highly recommend hair of the dog, 10/10.\n\nFor more menus, check out my movie directory here!"
