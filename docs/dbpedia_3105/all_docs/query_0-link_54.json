        "text": "Morton DaCosta, 1958\n\n143 minutes\n\nMame Dennis (Rosalind Russell), a progressive and independent woman of the 1920s, is left to care for her nephew Patrick (Jan Handzlik/Roger Smith) after his wealthy father dies. Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), Patrick's assigned executor, objects to Mame's unconventional way of living and tries to force her to send Patrick to prep school.\n\nIndulge yourself with a series featuring many of “My Favorite Films” including tales of romance, humor, suspense, satire, and heroism. Organized by Auditorium Manager Tina Gorski, a lifelong movie lover, the films in this series may hold special memories for you: no matter how many times you see them, they continue to draw you in one more time. The series features films since 1945. While many of these films are available through streaming, it’s always more fun to see them in the theater.\n\nMake a day of it at the Modern and include extra time to visit the galleries and our special exhibitions. Enjoy lunch in Café Modern and then settle in for an afternoon screening, or plan for a coffee break afterwards with fellow film enthusiasts."
