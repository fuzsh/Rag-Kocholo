When young, impressionable Patrick Dennis' millionaire father dies, the boy is left in the care of his only living relative--his flamboyant, extravagant, devil-may-care ... and never, never dull Auntie Mame. New York during the Jazz Age--Despite the best efforts of estate executive Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark) to rear Patrick (Jan Handzlik and Roger Smith) as a boring, stuffy aristocrat, the boy is swept into Mame Dennis' (Rosalind Russell) world of parties, flappers and the most eccentric, entertaining, intelligent set of friends anywhere. Through the stock market crash, a marriage to a rich Southerner and his death while scaling the Alps, Mame's whirlwind approach to life opens Patrick's eyes to endless possibilities.",

        "text": "The story keeps shifting around from place to place and event to event, appearing as if the plot is made up on the spot; the film feels comprised of an improvisational, unorthodox series of vignettes.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nRosalind Russell turns in a flamboyant but beautifully controlled performance in the Hollywood version of the stage triumph.\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\nTo this day, I still regard Auntie Mame as one of the highest of achievements of that very American decade.\n\nAugust 23, 2018\n\nBase on a book and Broadway play, the movie is still too theatrical due to Da Costa's mediocre helming, but it's a great, campy and colorful showcase for comedienne Rosalind Russell in her best-known role which she had originated on stage.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
