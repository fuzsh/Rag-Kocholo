        "text": "The character of Mame Dennis has endured many iterations, as the titular character in Edward Everett Tanner III’s novel and later it became the 1966 hit Broadway musical, Mame, starring Angela Lansbury. In 1974, the musical Mame was adapted into the movie musical of the same name, starring Lucille Ball. Ball’s version is considered an absolute disaster and she was considered miscast. Lansbury’s performance as Mame Dennis was one of the highlights of her career. As much as I love Lucille Ball, I wish that Lansbury had been given the opportunity to reprise her role in the film. The iteration that is the most remembered however, is the 1958 adaptation, Auntie Mame, starring Rosalind Russell. Russell was reprising her Tony Award-winning role in the 1956 adaptation of Tanner III’s novel. She was born to play Mame Dennis. It is the perfect marriage of star and part.\n\nAuntie Mame starts in 1928 when Mame Dennis’ nephew Patrick is orphaned when his father Edwin dies unexpectedly. Edwin’s sister, Mame, is given custody of Patrick per Edwin’s will. The trustee of Patrick’s large inheritance, Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark), had been tasked by Edwin to try and undermine Mame’s enormous influence over everyone. Her larger than life personality and love for unique people, cultures and experiences– her overall lust for life so to speak, charms her to many people from different walks in life. Mame has an eccentric group of friends, all whom end up at her townhouse all hours of the day–often because she’s invited them over for a wild party. Some of Mame’s friends include book publisher Lindsay Woolsey (Patric Knowles), actress Vera Charles (Coral Browne), and Acacius Page (Henry Brandon) who runs a nudist resort. Patrick of course is fascinated by all these people, which horrifies Mr. Babcock.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929 bankrupts Mame. She is forced to start working to pay her bills. All her jobs end disastrously, including appearing on stage with Vera where the bells on her jewelry and clothing is distracting both to the actors and audience. Later, Mame works as a switchboard operator and finally as a sales girl at Macy’s. While at Macy’s, Mame meets oil baron Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker). Mame and Beauregard fall in love and marry and spend their days traveling the world. Meanwhile, Patrick is living under the guardanship of Mr. Babcock which is leading to Patrick developing a more conservative personality.\n\nVERA to MAME: What the HELL have you got back there? Reindeer?!\n\nCoral Browne as “Vera” to Rosalind Russell as “Mame” while Vera and Mame appear onstage.\n\nIn 1937, Beauregard dies in a mountain climbing accident, leaving Mame a very wealthy widow. Beauregard’s death serves as the moment when the film transitions from child Patrick to adult Patrick (Roger Smith). When Mame returns to her home after her husband’s death, she is greeted with gifts from Patrick: a Dictaphone, typewriter, and a secretary named Agnes Gooch (Peggy Cass). Patrick and Mame’s friends encourage Mame to write her memoirs. A ghostwriter is hired, Brian O’Bannion (Robin Hughes) is hired, though it quickly becomes apparent that he’s after Mame’s money.\n\nNow comes for my favorite part of the film: the introduction of the Upson family. Patrick announces to Mame that he’s engaged to Gloria Upson (Joanna Barnes), the snobby rich daughter of Doris (Lee Patrick) and Claude (Willard Waterman). There’s a funny scene where Mame visits Doris and Claude and is given Claude’s signature cocktail, a daiquiri made with a lot of honey. Rosalind Russell is hilarious in this scene. Her facial expressions fully inform the audience how disgusting this drink is. Later, she basically tosses the drink over her shoulder and wisely turns down a refill. It is this scene where Mame learns that the Upsons live in a restricted community. Of course, Mame who loves people from all religions, occupations, etc. is appalled. She gets delicious revenge later.\n\nGLORIA: Oh my, what a stunning apartment!\n\nMAME: Thank you.\n\nGLORIA: Books are awfully decorative, don’t you think?\n\nJoanna Barnes as “Gloria” and Rosalind Russell as “Mame”\n\nJoanna Barnes’ performance of Gloria is hysterical. At Mame’s party, she tries to entertain Mame and her friends, with actual interesting lives and stories, with her anecdote involving a wild ping pong game which resulted in the ball being stepped on. As one can imagine, Mame and her friends are not impressed at this vapid, snobby, idiotic woman. Gloria constantly calls everything “top drawer” with her nasally “Valley Girl-esque” voice. She tries so hard to impress everyone with her wealth and status, but she’s so shallow and has no substance that she comes off as an idiot. Mame is repulsed by the Upsons and does everything she can to try and open up Patrick’s eyes to the family he’s about to marry into.\n\nGLORIA: Bunny Bixler and I were in the semi-finals – the very semi-finals, mind you – of the ping-pong tournament at the club and this ghastly thing happened. We were both playing way over our heads and the score was 29-28. And we had this really terrific volley and I stepped back to get this really terrific shot. And I stepped on the ping-pong ball! I just squashed it to bits. And then Bunny and I ran to the closet of the game room to get another ping-pong ball and the closet was locked! Imagine? We had to call the whole thing off. Well, it was ghastly. Well, it was just ghastly.\n\nJoanna Barnes as “Gloria” in Mame\n\nEventually Mame gets a new secretary, Pegeen Ryan (Pippa Scott), after Agnes ends up pregnant after a (presumably) one night stand with O’Bannion. Earlier in the film, Mame had sent Agnes to a party in her place to sabotage O’Bannion’s attempts to woo her, i.e. move in on her money. Patrick is smitten with Pegeen, a pairing that pleases Mame. At the aforementioned party, Mame invites her friends over to show off her memoir. She also redecorates her townhouse with futuristic decor, including a seating area that can be raised and lowered with different cords. Mame’s goal of course is to drive the Upsons out of her home and of course, Patrick’s life.\n\nRosalind Russell is everything in the role of Mame. She is loud, vivacious, glamorous, hilarious and incredibly charming. I love how Mame’s zest for life is portrayed through the evolution of Mame’s costumes and decor in her townhouse. As Mame visits a new country or becomes interested in another culture or decorating style, her clothing and furnishings change to reflect her new interests. Russell’s costumes are gorgeous, my favorite costume being the silver sequined shirt and harem pants with a chartreuse organza wrap she wears at her big party with the Upsons. Mame also wears a great orange crepe coat with a mandarin collar while she’s in her “Asian period.” At the end of the film, while Mame is packing for a trip to India she is dressed in a beautiful gold gown with a matching embroidered gold wrap. I think Russell’s height (5’8) suited her well for all the gorgeous coats and gowns that Mame wears.\n\nThe supporting cast is excellent as well and work well in Mame’s world. Coral Browne plays Mame’s best friend, Vera, and is just as outrageous. She often gets plastered at Mame’s parties and just sleeps it off. Vera has an acid tongue and is hilarious. Peggy Gooch as Mame’s secretary is hysterical. Her raspy high pitched voice is funny enough, but it is even funnier with her frumpy appearance. Joanna Barnes as the snobby and spoiled daughter of the Upsons is hilarious–especially when you can see from where she got her behavior. Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman are obnoxious. They’re like every snobby rich person who thinks that money makes up for having class and taste. Because they’re rich, everything they eat, drink, do, etc. is fancy and for the elite, because they’re doing it.\n\nVERA: If you kept your hair natural like I do…\n\nMAME: If I kept my hair natural like yours, I’d be bald.\n\nCoral Browne as “Vera” and Rosalind Russell as “Mame”\n\nAn interesting aspect of Auntie Mame‘s presentation is how it is presented as if one were watching a play on the screen. Each section of the play ends with a dimming of the screen and a bit of a pause in the action–as if we needed to wait for new sets and costume changes. This gives the film a very stylized, elegant presentation which might be off-putting to some, but I find it appropriate for the Mame character. She herself is a stylish person. She is sophisticated. Since her style evolves as she does, the stylish aesthetic of the film is fitting. The presentation of the film and of Mame herself supports her message: Life’s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!"
