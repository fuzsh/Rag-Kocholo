        "text": "March 5, 2020\n\nThere are 2 stories that I really liked in particular: Auntie Mame On A Mission of Mercy and Auntie Mame And The Southern Belle. These are the summaries of them:\n\nAuntie Mame On A Mission of Mercy:\n\nA while after the elopement of Agnes Gooch and Brian O’Bannion, news came that Agnes needed help to deliver the child. Auntie Mame immediately called Patrick to meet her when he was in class at St. Boniface Private School. Patrick risked his academic life to escape the school and meet his aunt just to hear the news that he now had the responsibility of taking care of Agnes because Brian dumped her when she got pregnant. At first, Patrick did not want to accept another responsibility that will risk him getting expelled from school, but when Auntie Mame promised him that she will take him to Europe in exchange for taking care of Agnes, he reluctantly approved of risking his academic life. From then on, he had to sneak out of his boarding school to take Agnes on a 4-mile walk at night after lights out. To not get found out, he had to disguise as a grown man and climb up using a rope attached to Auntie Mame’s room, and climb down again after his task is done to get back to school and change back into his uniform just when the sun is rising. Although his grades started slipping, he did a good job trying to hide the fact that he was sneaking out every night. In spite of the fact that he was so talented at acting like nothing happened at night in school, he got found out one night by Mr Pugh, who also wasn’t allowed to leave school, claimed that he was coming to watch a flower that blooms at night. In order to not get into trouble, they do not tell anyone about what happened. Surprisingly, Mr Pugh started walking Agnes every night by himself. However, they get found out during the night of Father and Son Day. Father and Son Day is when the students’ fathers would wear their old, worn-out uniforms and come to visit the school. Mr Pugh and Patrick were exposed by the accident of climbing up the wrong rope to Mrs Babcock’s room when they wanted to go to Auntie Mame’s room to see how Agnes was doing. The whole St. Boniface School was then chasing after them, which then resulted in them running away from school— one expelled and the other fired, but married to Agnes.\n\nAuntie Mame And The Southern Belle:\n\nAfter meeting the generous man, Mr Burnside, Auntie Mame finally found her “man” and married him. Thus, Auntie Mame and Patrick went on a little trip to Mr Burnside’s home country. Sally Cato, Mr Burnside’s former girlfriend was jealous of Auntie Mame, so she tried to defeat her and be loved by Mr Burnside once again. This included the event of Sally Cato questioning whether if Auntie Mame can ride a horse. Not noticing what was going to happen, Auntie Mame claimed that she was really good at horse-riding back when she was living in New York. Sally Cato, obviously doubting that this has happened, prepared a hunting event inviting everyone and the most insane horse for Auntie Mame to show how “great” she is. Unfortunately, her plan was ruined by Auntie Mame’s luck. Somehow, Auntie Mame had controlled the horse finely, and hopped off the horse without a scar on her body. Being caught that Sally was unfair and purposely planning to destroy Auntie Mame’s reputation beforehand, she was despised by the Burnside family.\n\nI really liked Auntie Mame's personality. She had an open personality, although sometimes she was a little too impulsed and emotional. However, I have to admit that she is indeed an eccentric woman that does not mind what others think of her. She does not hesitate to climb back up after she falls down. This could be shown by the example of how she keeps on finding a new job in order to support Patrick’s education and their monthly spendings. From working as an interior designer to a book writer, she has never given up trying to find a job that she likes to support the family. She is a woman to be admired because even though she has eccentric ideas, she has values that people should learn from. One of the examples of this is how she always displays love to someone even if they are now as ince to her. This could be shown when she was still helping Patrick even when he gets easily irritated by her weird personality showcased in front of the Upsons."
