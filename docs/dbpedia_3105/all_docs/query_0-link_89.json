        "text": "OK guys, this is a BIG one! Auntie Mame, filmed in 1958 and starring Rosalind Russell is more than just a movie, it’s a philosophy, a lifestyle, a raison d’être!\n\nI first saw this film as a teen on one of the classic film stations and it had a profound impact on me. And not just the clothing, the sets or the sirenic Ms. Russell’s performance but really the message behind it all: that of living an extraordinary life – one full of beauty, exploration, creativity and freedom.\n\nBut about those costumes, they were designed by Orry-Kelly and holy moly were they amazing! This film covers several decades of Mame’s life and she goes through a lot of clothes (and hairstyles) throughout the film. Of course the fashionable aunt also had to update her pad at No. 3 Beekman Place to match, so look forward to lots of amazing sets including the infamous Danish modern set by the fictional Yul Ulu (in real life it was Malcolm C. Bert who designed the sets and was nominated for an oscar for his work on this film).\n\nI don’t want to give too much away because this film really is an experience that has to be lived. But once you live it I think you’ll agree that Auntie Mame is something special!"
