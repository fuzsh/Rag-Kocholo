        "text": "Warner Brothers Six Sheet Poster. 81x81 Very Good Condition.\n\nOriginal Warner Brothers Six Sheet poster for the Morton DaCosta comedy, AUNTIE MAME (1958) starring Rosalind Russell, Forrest Tucker, Coral Browne, Roger Smith, and Peggy Cass. Mame (Russell) is an unconventional socialite in the roaring 1920s who must raise her nephew Patrick (Smith) after his father dies. Together Mame and Patrick have some zany adventures in this highly theatrical movie version of the celebrated Broadway success. The film garnered 6 Academy Award nominations-- including Best Picture, and Best Actress for Russell, and Best Supporting Actress for Cass. This original six sheet poster was a theater-used poster from the original release of the film. We we got the poster, we photographed it as you see it. The condition of the six sheet is folded, obviously, but with excellent paper integrity and good color. We have put this poster in the queue for linen backing. The six sheet poster is a large poster, printed on four separate panels which are then joined to make one 81x81 inch poster. Condition is very good unrestored to fine plus on linen. Scarce in this format.\n\nForrest Tucker - Actor\n\nMORTON DaCOSTA - Director\n\nRosalind Russell - Actor\n\nPeggy Cass - Actor\n\nFred Clark - Actor\n\nCoral Browne - Actor\n\nRoger Smith - Actor\n\nPatric Knowles - Actor\n\nLee Patrick - Actor\n\nJoanna Barnes - Actor\n\nPippa Scott - Actor\n\nHenry Brandon - Actor"
