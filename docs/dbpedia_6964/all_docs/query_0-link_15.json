        "text": "The Rebel Moon directors cuts have run for an extra two hours. Worthy plot material or Synder’s over indulgence?\n\nNetflix presumably threw a lot of money for Zack Snyder to produce his epic sci-fi vision, Rebel Moon. The story arrived in two parts with the first released on Netflix, in December 2023, with the subheading, A Child of Fire (Review). The second instalment was released in April 2024, entitled, The Scargiver (Review).\n\nI wasn’t sure if I was going to watch them initially, as Snyder had already been revealing that his longer director’s cut would be released at a later date. However, the initial trailers had got my attention, and I’ve always been a sci-fi boy at heart, so I got stuck in.\n\nIf you haven’t read my linked reviews, my general feelings were one of massive enjoyment. I loved the worlds Snyder had created with interesting creatures, worlds, and technology. But on the flip side, some character development felt missing, plus both films had a feeling of being sanitised.\n\nConsidering the amount of on-screen violence these films contain, there’s barely a drop of blood to show for it. Violence does not have to be gallons of blood spurting everywhere to create an impact, but these two films definitely had a feeling of being toned down for a larger audience. No doubt part of a contract for supplying these films to Netflix.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Netflix and Snyder have released his director’s cuts, they have been given new names to differentiate them from the originals.\n\nRebel Moon Part One is now Chalice of Blood and Part Two, The Curse of Forgiveness. Both films have been very much expanded as well, with Part One gaining seventy minutes, while Part Two has fifty-two minutes more. To sit down and watch both in a single session, make sure you have at least six hours free!\n\nAn extra two hours is unmistakeably a lot of new material, so what do we get, and does it enhance the viewing experience?\n\nFor starters, the opening narration from Anthony Hopkins has been removed. To be honest, I found this to be quite an info dump in watching the original versions, so I didn’t miss them here. The story flows quite naturally and as you watch the films, what has happened and why is revealed over the runtime.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is a whole new opening sequence to show the attack on a previously unseen planet. Here we see King Heron and his family trying to survive while their city is under an attack from the Imperium.\n\nThe scene will end with the eldest son of the family, Aris, being forced to kill his own father in order to spare the lives of his mother and his sisters. A brutal choice forced upon him by the sadistic Atticus Noble.\n\nAris kills his father and is taken away by Noble to become a soldier in the Imperium. His role now plays out larger across the two films, and this introduction explains his motivations and actions clearer than the original theatrical cut.\n\nThis large opening sequence also defines the visual style of the film going forward. If you’ve seen 300, you’ll be familiar with the very stylised CGI blood flying across the screen, particularly in slow motion.\n\nI hope you liked that effect, because almost every battle will now feature that in absolute spades. It only ever comes across as gory in a few specific kills. Snyder is implying this is Star Wars style sci-fi for the adults now. It’s a welcome addition but becomes a little tiresome by the end.\n\nUnfortunately, there are two scenes, raising the age rating for this film, that I felt could have easily been implied or at least cut back. Kora has sex, once in each film, with a lot of on-screen nudity. The first time is one of the director’s cut additions, the second I think is an expanded edition of the original cut.\n\nI sped through the second scene because even though Kora is with a different man this time around, it feels like unwarranted repetition. The second sex scene is the important one for the story, loose the first one, please.\n\nThere is a little more nudity when some poor women are stripped of their clothes and branded as witches by the Imperium, but the way it was presented didn’t feel as unnecessarily as gratuitous as the aforementioned sex scenes.\n\nOne of my bugbears of the original cuts was the lack of screen time for the android Jimmy. After saving a young girl’s life, he disappears for most of the two films, and only reappears for the final fight. With the extended edition, Jimmy makes semiregular appearances, and we learn that he was contemplating his place in the world and was helping the other heroes on his own terms without them realising.\n\nJimmy’s extra scenes weren’t quite the revelation I was expecting, but they were helpful in expanding his character. The biggest addition was a small subplot in the second film involving Jimmy discovering that bounty hunters are spying on the heroes.\n\nThe huge Imperium Dreadnought spaceships are powered by a reactor that looks like a huge metal statue of a naked woman crouching. In the expanded version, it’s revealed these are in fact sentient beings, known as the Kali, imprisoned by the sadistic Imperium for their own needs.\n\nThe odd extra line of dialogue here and there confirms the Imperium treat them badly, and a new scene with Kora during the film’s climax enables them to reveal their true selves. Hopefully, if more films are forthcoming, this is a point that can be expanded upon further. How many of the Kali are being held as prisoners to power their technology?\n\nOne final obvious edition is the fascination with teeth. The strange priests of the Imperium carry with them a picture of the slain princes, Issa. What surrounds the picture is what looks like a mosaic of small ivory pieces or rocks.\n\nHowever, as the first high profile kill of the film reveals, once the subject is dead, the priests remove a tooth and place into a space onto the mosaic. This serves no huge purpose to the plot, but the number of teeth shows how cruel and barbaric the Imperium are.\n\nThese are just a few of the major additions to the two films that I noticed as I watched these new extended editions. I couldn’t possibly recount all the changes because my memory is terrible, and I feel that with the second film, the additions were more frequent but in smaller pieces.\n\nIf you’re not a fan of the original cuts, these new versions are probably not going to change your mind, as the story stays the same. For fans of the series, what we now have is a tale that has been expanded considerably with more background information that really helps flesh out some main protagonists.\n\nSnyder has a tendency for slow motion in his films, it seems to be something you love or hate. The Rebel Moon director’s cuts now feature even more, so I hope you’ve built up a tolerance to it. To be fair, for some reason, I didn’t find it as distracting as my first viewing.\n\nI watched both films over two evenings and as you’ve probably guessed, I was thoroughly engrossed in these films all over again. While maybe not every addition is needed, Snyder does need to reign it in a little, I really appreciated the extra story information accompanied by the extra visual flair and violence.\n\nReviewed on Xbox Series S.\n\nAlso available on PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Windows.\n\nStill Wakes the Deep was a game that I came across completely by accident. After having completed Far Cry 5 recently, I dived back into the Xbox Game Pass collection to discover something new to play.\n\nDipping into the Indie section, the haunting graphic of an oil rig within the silhouette of a man caught my attention and I started to watch the trailer. The premise intrigued me, I stopped the trailer halfway and proceeded to download the game.\n\nAs the game starts, there’s an emotional story set into play as to who you are and why you are on an oil rig. You will play the game as Cameron “Caz” McLeary, an electrician who has gone to work on a dilapidating oil rig, the Beira D, somewhere in the North Sea, in December 1975.\n\nCaz is married to Suze, and they have two children together. In the opening moments of the game, we discover that Caz didn’t take too kindly to a man called Billy making advances on his wife and proceeded to assault him.\n\nThe Scottish police are now on the hunt for Caz and if they find him, Suze will likely lose the flat which is their family home. Caz takes up the kind offer of help from his best friend Roy, a cook on the Beira D, and enlists to work on the oil rig as an electrician.\n\nCaz hopes that by leaving and allowing the situation to cool, in time, he’ll be able to talk Billy into dropping the charges. However, leaving for the oil rig puts a strain on his marriage and as the game opens, Caz receives a letter from Suze, hinting at a divorce.\n\nDropping the letter onto your bunk, you make your way to the canteen for breakfast, meeting a few characters along the way. However, before you can tuck in, the boss of the platform, an angry, careless man called Rennick, bellows over the intercom that he needs to see you in his office.\n\nAs you make your way across the deck of the rig towards the boss’s cabin, you’ll meet more workers and see the state of the place and the equipment.\n\nThe meeting with Rennick is short as has discovered the reason for your employment on the rig, there’s no room for a liability. He angrily terminates your employment. Halfway through this encounter, his will take a phone call from the drillers asking about a difficulty in drilling. Rennick doesn’t care and orders them to push on through.\n\nYou make your way across the oil rig to the waiting helicopter that will take you back to the mainland. Just as you reach the helicopter, the drill workers have hit something during their drilling. Explosions can be heard, and the platform is rocked.\n\nWhile trying to save a fellow worker from falling off the edge of the helipad, another explosion rocks the oil rig, and you find yourself tumbling into the rough seas below.\n\nWhen you come to, rescued by other members of staff, you make your way from the bottom of the oil rig back to the top. You can see the drilling shaft, which is now wrapped in blood-red tendrils that extend into the base of the oil rig.\n\nThe mystery of what has happened will be entwined with a fight for your survival, which is about to begin.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but I wanted to set the scene, and what I have described to you is merely the opening ten minutes or so of the game. There’s a lot more to come.\n\nStill Wakes the Deep was not the kind of game I was expecting at all, but this is not a bad thing. From the trailer, I assumed this was going to be a first-person shooter or maybe something along the lines of Dead Space (A game I love and have yet to play the remaster).\n\nThis is very much a game style that is often referred to as a walking simulator. Despite the huge labyrinthine location of an oil rig, you can’t outright free roam, the game will always guide you in the right direction.\n\nThe most common method of signposting will be the utilization of the colour yellow, be it yellow metal ladders or just splashes of colour in certain places that will hint at where you should be going. There will be the odd corridor or extra rooms to explore that will fend off the presence that your choices are essentially non-existent.\n\nNeither is there a heads-up display of any kind. No health bar is shown or needed. Much like real life, if you’re going to die because of the situation, quite frankly, that’s what’s going to happen.\n\nThe only change to the display is an effect that resembles a film negative burning up in a projector. When you see it, you’ll know what I mean. This appears around the edges of the screen in relation to the presence of the menace taking over the oil rig, as it seemingly affects your mind. I thought it was visually interesting and something different from the norm.\n\nWeapons aren’t an issue either, as you never fight anything. At most, you can pick up items such as cups, spanners or drinks flasks which can be thrown as a distraction. This is when the game feels the most open, as you must make your way across a section of the map stealthily, distracting the enemy as you progress.\n\nThere are several other encounters that involve you running for your life. These certainly got my heart pounding, especially as there is a button to use that allows you to glance behind! No, thanks, too busy running!!\n\nStill Wakes the Deep is best described as an interactive story, but that kept me enthralled, as once I started, I sat there completely engrossed and played through the entire game in a single sitting of several hours.\n\nIt felt very reminiscent of Alien: Isolation at times and as the dark of night drew in outside, I became completely absorbed by the events of the story in my darkened room. It even caused me to jump with fright a couple of times.\n\nThe story is quite reminiscent of the classic sci-fi horror, The Thing (1982) and it’s easy to spot the similarities. As the story progresses, you’ll travel through the same sections of the oil rig and see how the place is deteriorating due to the strange menace and the effect it’s having on the location.\n\nWhat really tied this altogether for me were the superb graphics. I don’t follow tech very closely, but I’m aware that the latest version of the Unreal Engine is very powerful and allows for amazing work.\n\nStill Wakes the Deep has been created on this technology, and for me, the oil rig itself is one of the biggest stars of the whole game. The attention to detail was astounding, the structure itself, the weathered look in the textures, signs on the wall, it all helped make me feel I was there.\n\nThe characters you meet didn’t quite meet the same standard, but that wasn’t an issue for me at all. This may have been related to performance issues. For reference, I played this on my Xbox Series S, by default, the game had motion blurring on and after a minute’s play, that option was reversed.\n\nThe rest of the game played very well, but it had a 30fps feel to it and sometimes, it felt like it dipped below that. These occurrences were uncommon and considering the style of gameplay, it’s not too much of an issue.\n\nStill Wakes the Deep was a very well presented Lovecraft style horror that probably involved the most swearing I’ve ever heard in a video game; the characters are all Scottish, I remind you.\n\nThe story and the graphical way in which it was presented was something I was not expecting, and I was engrossed from start to finish. Look at the length of this review! Highly recommended.\n\nTwisters, strap in and enjoy the ride, it’s that simple.\n\nTwisters is a legacy sequel to the original Twister, directed by Jan de Bont and released in 1996. Legacy sequel? Yes, this rather new term in Hollywood refers to a film that is a sequel to another that is several years, and in some cases, decades old. However, it has been proven to be very successful, look at Top Gun: Maverick and next month we have Beetlejuice Beetlejuice!\n\nThe original Twister was the story of a storm chaser, Jo, and her ex-husband and ex storm chaser turned weatherman, Bill, as they team up to deploy a new scientific device into the heart of a tornado. Nicknamed Dorothy, the device would send hundreds of small sensors into the vortex of a twister, sending back vital data as they went. With this data, they would hopefully be able to successfully predict twisters, allowing those who watch the weather to give out twister warnings sooner, giving people more time to evacuate and prepare.\n\nAfter the huge success of Speed, Jan de Bont’s first film as a director, Twister also did very well at the box office. It also has the honour of being the first DVD to be released in America and also one of the last HD-DVDs to be released as well.\n\nIt’s one of our (that’ll be Mrs Wife) favourites as well, and I’ll always remember the teaser trailer which includes a shot of a twister taken from the POV of being inside a truck. The shot ends when a wheel from a tractor comes flying into the windscreen.\n\nAfter watching the film, it bugged me that this shot never made the final cut of the film. I later learnt this was actually a proof of concept shot created by Industrial Light & Magic. Everyone liked it so much, it was included at the end of the film’s teaser trailer.\n\nBut you’re not here to listen to me ramble about the original film, you’re here for Twisters. How does this film connect to the original and what does it offer?\n\nWell, to put it bluntly, more of the same. But that’s a good thing.\n\nTwisters opens with a group of young scientists led by Kate Carter. Her team includes Javi, Addy, Praveen, and her boyfriend, Jeb. In one of the few links to the original film, they are also using the Dorothy equipment to try to gain scientific data from tornadoes.\n\nBut they also have a new theory they want to put to the test. Not only do they want to release scientific probes into a twister, but also a scientific compound called sodium polyacrylate. If successful, this would absorb the moisture from a tornado, causing it to burn out and dissipate.\n\nKate has a natural ability to forecast where a tornado is likely to appear, and they go after a suitable twister to test their theory. The plan comes apart when the tornado escalates to an EF5 (the most destructive tornado there is). The situation goes from bad to worse when the effect of the tornado takes the lives of the team. Only Kate and Javi survive.\n\nFast-forward five years and Kate is now working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration helping to predict tornadoes. She is visited by Javi, who convinces her to come back to working in the field for just one week in order to help his company prove that his new phased-array radar scanning technology will work. With the data this new technology will provide, they can help to create warnings about tornadoes earlier, which will of course help to save lives.\n\nKate and Javi arrive in Oklahoma where they will encounter popular YouTube storm chaser Tyler Owens, known as the “Tornado Wrangler”, who has also arrived to capitalize on a predicted tornado outbreak. Tyler and his team only seem interested in giving their internet audience what they want to see and selling the associated merchandise.\n\nWill Kate and Javi get the data they need? Will Tyler keep getting in their way and become a hindrance? Is there more to this film than I have revealed? Of course, yes, but I’m not going to spoil it for you.\n\nTwisters is practically a standalone sequel that, apart from the Dorothy technology, doesn’t really feature any other links to its predecessor, except from the tornadoes themselves.\n\nComing almost thirty years later, the advances in technology mean that in this film, the tornadoes can feel bigger and meaner than ever before. That’s a good thing, as it makes for a hugely entertaining film.\n\nI haven’t counted the number of tornadoes in either film, but it feels like Twisters might just pip the original. Every encounter is exciting, tense, with no idea what will happen to those involved. The way Tyler ensures his truck wasn’t pulled away by the tornadoes was a nice touch.\n\nMuch like the original film, there’s definitely an on-screen visual competition of modern sleek science vs the rag tag homemade sensibility of the YouTubers. They easily win the aesthetic because it creates a much more visually appealing look.\n\nWhile there are numerous interesting characters on screen, Ben the English journalist bought a comedic touch to the proceedings, the film really focuses on the three main protagonists.\n\nKate, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, was a great female lead that certainly gives Helen Hunt a run for the money when comparing to the original film. In fact, while watching the film, my wife was convinced that it was going to reveal that Hunt’s character was going to be Kate’s mother, enforcing another link to the original, but this isn’t the case.\n\nAnthony Ramos, Javi, was pretty good. I thought he was playing for the lovesick angle originally, but I’m not sure if that was his character’s motive. It wasn’t quite clear enough, perhaps that was what I was expecting from him.\n\nFinally, we come to Glen Powell, who I think most will have come to know him as the character Hangman from another legacy sequel that was a massive blockbuster hit, Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThis is only the second film I have seen him in, but he’s already becoming a favourite. He’s just so damn likeable in Twisters, I can’t fault him. Even when he first appears as the “annoying YouTuber”, he’s still fun to watch with his gung-ho, twister chasing attitude.\n\nThis trio of actors works surprisingly well together, in fact Twisters was a genuine surprise as the term legacy sequel immediately puts me on edge a little. The studio is banking on that feeling of nostalgia for a hit film.\n\nThat’s not what happened here, Twisters is a great piece of entertainment that I wasn’t expecting to be this good. If you’ve never seen the original, it doesn’t matter, see this on a big screen and have some fun.\n\nReviewed on Xbox360 via Xbox Series S Backwards compatibility.\n\nAlso available on PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows.\n\nTrying to stay alive in the post apocalyptic FPS world of Rage\n\nRage is a game that I only played because of its sequel, Rage 2. I only played that because it was free! Rage 2 was released, if I remember correctly, shortly after the Christmas period of 2021 via the Epic Games store.\n\nI gave it a go and was happy to discover it played well on my then aging PC, so I kept going. It was also giving me strong Max Max vibes which is a game I adore so much; I have played through it twice.\n\nSo, at some point in the intervening years, I spotted a copy of the original Rage for PlayStation 3 for a very cheap price in a second-hand shop. I snapped it up, however, it turned out to be a disappointment.\n\nI can only assume that whatever 3D graphics engine was powering the game, it was pushing the PlayStation to the limit, or it was just the way it was coded.\n\nIn essence, the game looked fine if you were moving forward. A quick 180-degree turn, and you would see the rough coloured 3D models of the game. The Blu-ray drive stuttered within the machine, the textures all loaded in within a few seconds. But spin around again and the same visual effect happens again. Even after several minutes of play, I found this was quite irritating. Rage was placed back on the shelf and left there.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. I exchanged some considerable unused tech and acquired an Xbox Series S. My wife graciously upgraded my son’s Game Pass level to ultimate, so I would have access to it as well.\n\nI have been very impressed with the choice of games and when I discovered I could play the Xbox360 version of Rage, I added to my download list.\n\nHaving completed and really enjoyed Rage 2, I was aware of the storyline and was intrigued to see where it all began. The original Rage is a similar game but on a much smaller scale because of the older technology.\n\nRage opens with the depressing story that an asteroid is to hit the Earth. In preparation for this near apocalyptic event, hundreds of devices, known as Arks, are prepared.\n\nThese metallic, spherical constructions, containing cryogenic chambers and the technology to keep people alive, wil be built underground. They will emerge when the effects of the asteroid collision have reduced to a safe level, so that civilisation can rebuild.\n\nYou play as former U.S. Marine, Lieutenant Nicholas Raine, who was placed into one of these Arks. They went underground safely before the asteroid hit in the year of 2029.\n\nUnfortunately, something went wrong. The majority of the Arks malfunctioned and never returned to the surface. Your Ark, although heavily damaged, did activate. The other crew members lie dead in their damaged cryogenic chambers. You’re all alone. To make matters worse, you’ve been in stasis for 106 years.\n\nYou emerge from the Ark to discover an apocalyptic wasteland; the remains of a few buildings lay before you. Before you can get your bearings, you are under attack from some bandits.\n\nFortunately, a man who later introduces himself as Dan Hagar, rescues you and takes you to his small commune. It’s the remains of a gas station, diner and vehicle workshop.\n\nDan explains that a technologically advanced organization known as The Authority, which considers itself the one true government of the wasteland, is searching for Ark survivors.\n\nDan will help you acquire some basic gear, if you perform some small tasks for him. And so begins the game of Rage.\n\nRage is primarily a first-person shooter that is interspersed with vehicle sections that also involve combat. There is always a hub of sorts, of which Hagar’s encampment is the first of three in the game.\n\nThese hubs contain a multitude of interesting characters, some of which perform essential game related tasks. A shop owner to sell found items to and more importantly, purchase ammo for the many weapons you will acquire. A garage owner will repair your vehicle and allow you to install any upgrades you’ve bought and so on.\n\nMore characters, usually just a handful, will give you missions and tasks to complete. Back to the garage you trot, get into your car and travel to the start point. The missions are always completed on foot.\n\nThis description is crude but covers the basics, so what kept me playing?\n\nI have a strong affection for post-apocalyptic stories, for example, the aforementioned sequel Rage 2, the game of the film, Mad Max and even Waterworld. So, Rage is right up my street.\n\nThe first thing that grabbed my attention is the art style which is just glorious. It feels like a graphic novel that’s been bought to life. There is so much detail in the world, it drew me in. I was honestly surprised that a game from this era of computing could look so good.\n\nThe only drawback, probably due to the limitations of the technology of the time, is the textures for many of the objects are soft and often somewhat of a low resolution. But you can still easily see what an object is. Just accept the environment as whole, don’t focus on the individual objects and appreciate what the developers achieved.\n\nAs I was playing the game on the Xbox Series S, this may have heavily alleviated the texture pop-in referred to earlier. It’s still there just but not enough to distract from the game. Also, load times, due to 2020’s SSD technology, are reduced to mere seconds which also helps speed you through the game.\n\nMost of the time you’ll be exploring a variety of locations, in first person, so expect lots of gunplay, the bread and butter of the game. This is where Rage really shines with a few niggles.\n\nThe animation and AI of the enemy is easily some of the best I’ve seen of that era. Enemies duck behind different elements of the location, run for cover and even fire blindly to protect themselves and hopefully damage you. Each type of enemy has their own set of animations, and attack patterns. Initially, the game will keep you on your toes.\n\nRage features a large range of weapons to fight back and these futuristic weapons look fantastic but I think maybe the developers loved them a little too much.\n\nThe most basic of weapons are fists, to be honest, this is next to useless and I never had to resort to using them in my entire playthrough.\n\nNext up is a pistol, shotgun, machine guns, rocket launcher and a few more surprises. Unlike previous FPS games where you can simply scroll through the entire arsenal at the flick of a button, Rage only allows four at any one time and the selection method is fast and seamless.\n\nHolding down the right shoulder button brings up the weapon wheel with the four assigned weapons, one at each compass point. Simply hold the left stick in the direction of the desired choice, let go of the shoulder button and it’s selected.\n\nRage offers a little more tactical thinking by adding seperate ammo types to every weapon, and this is selected in the same way. A second ammunition wheel appears when changing weapons, and the right stick is moved to your selected ammo option.\n\nThis system makes for fast and seamless weapon changing while in the middle of combat. If you want to use a weapon not in your selected four, you can pull it out via the inventory menu temporarily. For example, a rocket launcher to use on a tougher enemy.\n\nUnfortunately, perhaps the developers loved their guns a little too much. They look great, the player even lovingly looks over each one as it is acquired. Sadly, ammunition reloading animations, despite looking lovely, do take their time. This bothered me later in the game where enemies were attacking whilst I was reloading and was vulnerable. Maybe if I was just a better shot in the first place?\n\nIt’s not just FPS combat though, driving in between missions, across the landscape, will have you encountering various bandits trying to stop you. At first, you’ll only be able to outrun them with the basic boost, but after a while, you’ll be able to fight back.\n\nThe second and third hubs in the game, the towns of Wellspring and Subway Town, both feature vehicle racing as a side adventure. Several types of racing are available such as time trials and combat racing for example. Winning these events will earn you certificates which can be exchanged for better car parts at the upgrade shop.\n\nAn upgraded car then means you can fight back in the wastelands. It’s fun for a while. But once your car has the best engine and armour, there isn’t really a reason to fight back but kudos to the developers for mixing up the gameplay.\n\nAlso, each town has a form of gambling with a unique strategy game involving cards. By placing bets and winning games, the better equipment you’ll be able to afford. Different cards can also be found scattered throughout the games locations which might just give you the edge in a card game.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I didn’t fully understand how to play the card game on my first go and never touched it again. For myself, collecting all the random junk in the wastelands and selling it back to the shops earned me plenty of cash to keep my guns full of ammunition.\n\nThere is also a side quest system where you can make deliveries like postman to different areas of the map. I never utilised this as I felt I was easily earning enough money already.\n\nRage’s story was okay and to be honest I can’t remember much; I just found the gameplay exciting enough. The basic premise is that The Authority want any Ark survivors that are discovered. You’ll upgrade yourself to a point where you can visit their base, wipe them out and use their technology to your own advantage.\n\nThis leads me onto another game point, end of level bosses. Rage doesn’t really have any major ones. There are a few minor encounters but with the powerful enough weapons you’ll already have by that point, they’ll go down quickly.\n\nAt some point during the first third, there was a very big bad guy battle. The events of the battle happen in such a way, it’s quite hard to be killed and its more of a spectacle than a real confrontation.\n\nRage also surprised me that the last level also suffered from the same problems that I would encounter with its sequel. It was fairly easy due to the games design.\n\n**SMALL SPOILER**\n\nJust before the start of the level, in a discussion with some major characters, they give you a very powerful weapon for the final mission. This makes killing a new enemy you encounter in that level quite easy. Plus, they’re plenty of ammo packs for that weapon dotted around which are easy to find.\n\nIt’s almost like Rage was giving me a new toy to play with and saying, “Go on! It’s the end. Have a bit of fun!”\n\n***END SPOILER***\n\nOverall, Rage was a very entertaining. I loved exploring the world created for the game and blowing the enemies away. I loved the games aesthetic; the soundtrack and I spent just under 12 hours in that world soaking it all in. The DLC is still available to purchase if you want to extend the game that little bit longer, but I was satisfied.\n\nDriving between areas broke up the FPS sections but not by much and they are quite short. If there was some other way of explaining how the character travelled the wasteland to different areas, they wouldn’t be missed.\n\nIf you have access via Game Pass, or some other way to play on Xbox360 or the PC, I’d recommend Rage. It still holds up very well over a decade later.\n\nMichael Fassbender stars as a Roman soldier, braving the Scottish Highlands to rescue his general\n\nAs a film nerd, you think I would dive into a film blind every other day, but it’s a rare occurrence for me.\n\nIf a film gains my attention, then I usually follow its path through production, ogle the posters and then watch its first trailer over and over. Unless the trailer runs for three minutes, then I typically turn it off early once I get a flavour of the film. Don’t get me started on that!\n\nBut on the odd occasion, I have delved into a film knowing nothing, and this is one such occasion.\n\nI suppose I’m what you would call a casual fan of director Neil Marshall’s work. His directorial debut, Dog Soldiers, is a low budget werewolf adventure, but it’s so well-crafted and a lot of fun.\n\nMy other favourite is the horror film The Descent, where several women go pot holing and discover something that will cause them to fight for their lives.\n\nFinally, it gets a lot of flack, and even I admit there are various problems, but I also quite enjoyed Hellboy released in 2019 with David Harbour as the titular character.\n\nI’m not aware of Marshall’s other films apart from one about a deadly virus entitled Doomsday, so I was quite surprised to find a Blu-ray copy of Centurion in one of my many charity shop visits.\n\nThe film has an impressive cast list including Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, and Dominic West. Once I started watching the film, I started to recognise numerous good actors, but I’ll get to that later.\n\nCenturion is set in 119AD, when the Roman Empire has conquered large swathes of Europe, including England. However, despite making a little headway into Scotland, the Roman’s have been unable to conquer it due to what they consider as the savages who live there. These people are called the Picts.\n\nThe Roman’s have an outpost in the Scottish highlands, Pinnata Castra. One of the soldiers currently stationed there is the Centurion Quintus Dias.\n\nIn the dead of night, the outpost comes under a bloody attack by the Pict. Almost everyone is brutally slaughtered except for Quintas when the Pict discover he can speak their language.\n\nQuintas is taken back to the Pict encampment whereupon he is tortured and interrogated but as a Roman soldier, he refuses to yield and reveals nothing. He later manages to escape.\n\nGnaeus Julius Agricola, Roman governor of Britannia, learns of the massacre of Pinnata Castra and orders the 9th Legion to march North and eradicate the Pict once and for all. To accompany them is a female Pict scout, Etain, who has agreed to work alongside them.\n\nAs the 9th Legion march on, they come across Quintas in the woods and rescue him from his pursuers. They continue pushing North but find themselves in an ambush.\n\nThere is an intensely bloody battle and the commander, General Titus Flavius Virilus, is captured alive to a Pict encampment. It’s also revealed that Etain was a traitor all along.\n\nQuintas and a small handful of survivors, including a cook, head off to rescue the general, but this will turn out to be just the start of their problems.\n\nCenturion could be considered a bit of a hidden gem, as I really enjoyed this, but it took a little while to settle into it. Being a film from Marshall, it’s not a stranger to a healthy dose of blood and gore. But what irked me at first is that all the blood flying across the screen is clearly CG.\n\nInstead, rather than let that affect my opinion, I saw it as a visual styling. It reminded me of something I would possibly see in a violent comic book, or maybe something like a British version of Zack Snyder’s 300.\n\nDon’t become too concerned as there is also a healthy dose of practical deaths with buckets of red blood aplenty. The shots are usually quite fleeting, but that’s all you need. The gruesome effect is there long enough to make you wince.\n\nCenturion does feel like 300 at several times throughout due to the level of violence, and the Roman generals barking orders you probably wouldn’t hear in real life, the kind of dialogue that’s sounds overly dramatic to enhance the scene. But don’t worry, Centurion doesn’t feature any slow-motion sequences.\n\nWhat is does have in abundance, in much the opposite of Zack Snyder’s epic adventure film, is lots of beautiful Scottish scenery. There’s no green screen here, and it is all the better for it. I’d certainly say it gives a good fight against New Zealand, as for myself, it was hard not to think of the original Lord of the Rings franchise because the shots were of a similar style.\n\nIn regards, to the story, it’s a great action film and seeing it blind, I had no idea which way the story was heading. I’ll admit there were a few elements I guessed, but as the story progressed, it was still surprising to see how they reached the relevant points.\n\nIn my research afterwards, it was a little disappointing to see that the film was technically a flop, as it only made back around half the budget. When I saw that the production costs came to a relatively low $12m, that’s an impressive film up on the screen.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Michael Fassbender was one of the reasons I picked up this title, and he certainly doesn’t disappoint. He’s one of those actors I can enjoy in almost anything, well, except Alien: Covenant, but I don’t blame him for that.\n\nOlga Kurylenko is the mute Pict tracker, Etain. She obviously can’t say anything, but her characters tracking skills are exemplary. Also, you don’t want to find yourself on the other end of her spear! Olga certainly does all she can to make her character memorable.\n\nDominic West is one of the many recognisable faces as the captured general. Others on the Roman side include a young Riz Ahmed as Tarak, the cook, who I recognised from Star Wars: Rogue One and would of course go into bigger roles.\n\nOne of the other massacre survivors is Macros, a noted marathon runner before joining the army. He is played by Neil Clarke who for most, probably came to their attention as the Dr Who companion, Mickey Smith.\n\nFinally, Paul Freeman (I’ve met him), Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark, has a small role as Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the Roman governor of Brittania who orders the 9th legion into Scotland.\n\nAs you can see, Centurion has a lot going for it, and I feel it’s a bit of a shame that the initial negative reviews have pushed it into the background. It also has a runtime of just an hour and a half, something of a rarity in today’s world.\n\nThis is just my opinion, well that’s the point of a review, but I honestly feel that this film is worth seeking out. It’s currently streaming on several major services on both sides of the pond, so it shouldn’t be hard to find.\n\nNo Mars! No Johnny Cabs! What does this remake of Total Recall have to offer?\n\nI don’t know how you feel about 1990s Total Recall starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it’s one of my beloved films that I watched so many times on VHS back in the day. Not only is it a great piece of science fiction, but I also think it’s one of Arnold’s best films as well.\n\nDirected by Paul Verhoeven, this film attracted a lot of attention at the time for its excessive violence. Well, did you see Robocop? It’s not a surprise, really.\n\nSo, when it was announced that Director Len Wiseman was going to remake a film which is regarded as a classic in the eyes of many, the trepidation of worry already starts to set in.\n\nAs you’re probably very familiar with by now, this is a film which I saw soon after release, thought it was ok and it never crossed my mind again. That was until recently, whereupon I discovered a lovely Blu-ray steel book edition in a charity shop for just £2. The packaging won me over, and I was willing to give the film another evaluation.\n\nTotal Recall is the story of a man called Quaid. He lives in what we know as Australia but is now called The Colony. All out global chemical warfare in the future has made most of the planet inhabitable.\n\nThe only other place habitable on the planet is the United Kingdom and some of the surrounding European countries. This is the United Federation of Britain. I just want to insert some kind of Brexit joke right now.\n\nThese two habitable areas of Earth are connected via a lift system which travels through the centre of the planet. Hundreds of workers make this commute every day.\n\nQuaid is one of these workers, and he spends his days on a production line creating an army of robotic police force. Despite being married to his beautiful wife of seven years, Lori, Quaid has been having the same dream of being involved in a frantic chase with the police. With him is another woman who loves him, but they become separated, and he vows to find her again.\n\nHe just wants a change of routine and despite the protest of his best friend, Harry, he decides to visit Total Recall. This company can give you any dream you desire and implant the whole adventure as a memory.\n\nHowever, during the implant process, something goes severely wrong, and before he knows it, the police have infiltrated the company and are demanding his arrest. As if from nowhere, Quaid acts like a trained combat expert and, much to his own surprise, disarms and defeats the squad of policemen.\n\nQuaid goes onto to stop another squad of policeman before making his way back home. He tries to explain what has happened to his wife, Lori, but to his surprise, she then tries to take him down with hand-to-hand combat before reaching for a gun.\n\nQuaid is on the run again, his life turned upside down.\n\nTotal Recall, trying not to think of the original, is a competent science fiction adventure. I was quite enamoured with the production design, especially with the cramped conditions of both England and Australia.\n\nIt almost verged on the Blade Runner style at times, but there were also concepts that reminded me of The Fifth Element and Minority Report as well. To be honest, there has been so much science fiction, it can’t be easy to break away from the films that really made an indelible impression in our minds.\n\nEven though this tale of a future world is full of people crammed into tiny spaces, the cast of the film is really quite small.\n\nColin Farrell takes on the lead role of Quaid, and he makes for a half decent action star, but it’s obviously a style that didn’t agree with him. Career wise, there are only a few films in this genre in which he stars.\n\nJessica Biel is Melina, the woman of Quaid’s dreams, literally, she’s also along for the ride with him and can certainly hold her own.\n\nKate Beckinsale, the then wife of the director, lasts longer in the film than Sharon Stone does in the original. She’s certainly tough, doing anything she can to stop Quaid in his tracks.\n\nThis core trio of actors carries the film through to its end, with appearances from some other great names who have fleeting appearances.\n\nBryan Cranston is Cohaagen, the leader of the United Federation of Britain, who wants to take over the rule of The Colony. While he’s Lori’s boss, his presence is only really felt during the film’s final third, where he will be involved in the big action set piece.\n\nBill Nighy makes an appearance, just about, as Matthias, the leader of the resistance who wants better living conditions for those in The Colony. I can’t say too much because for an important character in the film, he’s barely in it.\n\nThere’s even an uncredited appearance from Ethan Hawke as Hauser, if you have never seen Total Recall, I won’t spoil his relation to the story. His appearance is small but quite significant.\n\nIn mentioning Ethan (he doesn’t appear in the theatrical cut), I should say that I watched the Extended director’s cut on the Blu-ray which has the consensus of being the better version of the two editions. In my research of the two versions, it seems the theatrical cut had several plot points trimmed out, which had the effect of dumbing down the story for the audience. This is one of the main reasons as to why the film didn’t set the box office alight.\n\nI find that Len Wiseman’s work as a director is entertaining. While this was enjoyable, it’s not so great that I would run around recommending it to others. The same could be said for most of his filmography which includes half of the Underworld franchise and Die Hard 4.0 (or Live Free Or Die Hard) which, despite a few problems, I really like.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, this glossy remake isn’t a patch on the 1990 original. Nostalgia is a tricky thing, but it holds up the original is high regards, this remake doesn’t stand a chance.\n\nThe 1990 original is so practical, real, and visceral with blood spurting from every gunshot wound. A film I watched as a child when the age rating on the box said I shouldn’t be.\n\nIt also doesn’t help that the remake contains two moments, that for fans of the original, were two massive callbacks that really took me out of the film. Without going further into spoilers, two minor but instantly recognisable characters are in the remake as a nod to the original. One of which doesn’t make much sense considering the context of the 1990s version.\n\nNew audiences wouldn’t have had any idea, but as an old man yelling at clouds, I would’ve preferred these moments to have found themselves on the cutting room floor.\n\nOverall, there’s nothing wrong with the newer Total Recall, as I previously said, it’s a safe, competent science fiction adventure. If you fancy something with a bit more bite, go back to the 90s.\n\n“I’ll be back!” he said, Arnold and co. play Terminator once again\n\nWell, here I am after finding myself watching the final trilogy of films in the popular Terminator franchise. You can read my longform review of Terminator: Salvation here, and my reviews of Terminator: Genisys (almost a decade apart) via [Letterboxd] or [the blog].\n\nI have just finished watching Dark Fate, the sixth and as of writing, final film of the Terminator franchise. After the failure of Genisys, they tried again to launch the franchise but even with the help of Terminator’s creator, director James Cameron, it crashed at the box office and plans for any more were quickly binned.\n\nWhile the first two films follow a logical (time travel not withstanding) timeline, the rest of the sequels tend to play fast and loose, making up new lore as they go.\n\nThe first two films are based on a simple premise. In the original, Skynet, the AI of the future, that almost wipes out humanity, sends a lone killing machine, a Terminator, to kill the mother of a man who would ultimately lead the revolution against the machines. It failed.\n\nIn Terminator 2: Judgement Day, we learn that Skynet also sent back a Terminator to a time when the future leader of the resistance was just a young man. Skynet lost again and ultimately events were changed so that it would never exist in the first place.\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines shifted focus slightly and had Skynet sending a Terminator back in time to kill those who would become a second tier of generals in the resistance.\n\nTerminator: Salvation worked for me because it came from a completely different angle and tells a story of the resistance fighting the machines in the future. This aspect had only been seen for a few moments until this point so I was happy to spend an entire film in this part of the Terminator story.\n\nTerminator: Genisys quite frankly goes nuts with the time travel element. It forges a new storyline for itself by integrating with the events of the original film. An interesting idea but it gets muddled, and it doesn’t help when some elements aren’t explained. I think these points where to be revealed in future films that were never produced due to the poor box office reception.\n\nFinally, after my waffling, we get to Terminator: Dark Fate. A film that tries to start fresh, again, by ignoring mostly what has come before and sets itself up as a direct sequel to Terminator 2.\n\nBy the end of Terminator 2, we were led to believe that Skynet had been stopped and the film series was at a natural end. But those who want a piece of the franchise cash always find a way, an idea, to keep the story moving forward.\n\nThese new ideas all follow a similar theme. Events were changed so that Skynet would never exist but time itself is seemingly adamant that the “AI versus humanity” story must play out. Then, a form of Terminator must travel through film to kill someone. Also, the problem is placed on the filmmakers to invent a new and interesting form of Terminator that will create for an action packed and entertaining film.\n\nDark Fate is no different.\n\nThe film opens, rather shockingly, by starting not long after the events of Terminator 2. Sarah Conner and her son, John, are enjoying life in Mexico. Unfortunately, a Terminator has found them, John is brutally gunned down.\n\nOur story jumps forward 22 years and we witness the familiar events of a time orb materialising. It appears in the middle of a Mexican highway at night and a young woman appears. She is helped by two young bystanders and when the police soon arrive, she reveals her talents.\n\nThe next morning, we are introduced to Dani Ramos and her brother Diego. They are getting ready for work. They say goodbye to their father and leave the compact apartment complex where they live.\n\nNot long after, another time orb appears and a man appears. He greets a shocked woman who was about to hang her washing out to dry. The man touches the plaid shirt and his skin morphs and changes into the same garment. From this simple act, we obviously learn he has morphing capabilities much like the machines from previous films, but it hasn’t revealed all of his tricks yet.\n\nThe story moves to the location of the automative factory where Dani and Diego work. The woman from the future arrives, takes out a guard at the security station by the front gates and takes his clothes.\n\nDani’s father also arrives at the factory claiming his kids forgot to bring their lunches. But when Diego meets him, he’s confused as Dani made the lunches and they brought them along. When Diego’s father spots Dani, he moves in for the kill but before he gets close enough, the young women in the stolen security uniform uses a shotgun to blast him back.\n\nDiego and Dani are in complete shock but their father’s body isn’t bleeding. The open wounds are black, shiny and already self-healing.\n\nThe unnamed woman grabs Dani and informs her that she must follow if she wishes to stay alive. Dark Fate then kicks off an impressive opening action sequence that quickly demonstrates the abilities of our protagonists.\n\nThe young woman reveals herself to called Grace. She is an augmented soldier from the future with incredible strength, speed and other upgrades but they can only be used for a few minutes at a time due to the limits of the human body.\n\nOur villain of the piece is a unit designated a Rev-9. As the future war has played out differently in the timeline, this Terminator is possibly the most advanced unit we’ve seen in the franchise.\n\nThe REV-9, as we have seen, can mimic anything it touches, much like the liquid metal T1000 from Terminator 2 and the subsequent films. But what makes this model different to stand out from the other entries in the franchise is a more traditional Terminator style skeleton underneath, it’s black, sleeker and incredibly more agile.\n\nWhilst normally seen as “one person”, when in combat, it can separate and become two fighting machines, a deadly two pronged attack.\n\nAll of this is revealed in the opening action sequence which starts in the factory and becomes a vehicle chase on the motorway with shades of callbacks to the flood channel and fuel tanker truck action of the second film. If that wasn’t enough, Sarah Connor will join the fray by the end, with Linda Hamilton reprising her role from the first two films.\n\nWhat follows is the usual type of Terminator road movie where our heroes must keep moving and try to stay ahead of the advanced fighting machine. More plot will be revealed and by the halfway point, nostalgia will rear its head when Arnold Schwarzenegger is bought back into the story, playing the Terminator that killed John Connor.\n\nFor me, this is when the film loses its way and starts to change around and play with Terminator lore.\n\nThe Terminator (Arnold), once having completed its mission, has learnt to become more human and has even struck up a nonphysical relationship with a woman and helped her to raise a son. That’s a bit of a stretch for me.\n\nSecondly, a plot point involving Sarah receiving texts about when and where Terminators are about to appear when travelling from the future is revealed to be the Terminators (Arnold) doing. Apparently he can feel the time travel journeys echo backwards through time allowing him to know when and where they will appear.\n\nFor a film that started off so well, these new details just didn’t sit right with me, but I wasn’t going to stop the film there in annoyance.\n\nDark Fate then heads into its bombastic second half where the action is undeniably entertaining but in the context of a Terminator film, events happen push my logic boundaries to the limit.\n\nAdvanced fighting machines I have no issue with but the human element is pushed too far. You can tell me, “it’s just a movie, it’s entertainment”, but sometimes there’s a point in my head where a switch is flipped. What I’m trying to say is, I’ve expanded my logic rules for the film, fantastical events will happen to create excitement but when the plot pushes past that even further, it’s lost me.\n\nAnd I think that’s what lets Dark Fate down for me.\n\nThe opening action sequence was, for me, really top notch, but in order to top that, the final big climax, spread across two locations, pushes the boundaries of believability in order to surpass what has come before.\n\nIt probably helps that the opening action sequence feels very grounded, and practical whereas the ending relies heavily on CGI. That’s not a slight on the quality of the visual effects which for the most part are very impressive.\n\nThis is especially true of the film’s opening moments where CGI is used to create 1991 era Linda Hamilton, Eddie Furlong and Arnold Schwarzenegger. One of the best “de-aging” sequences I’ve seen, especially for Linda and Eddie. Very impressive work.\n\nThe cast is pretty good. Playing a killing machine from the future never really changes and so having Schwarzenegger back in the role again is always nice to see.\n\nHaving Linda Hamilton return to the role of Sarah Conner was another bump in the nostalgia feels, even though her character is a grump though most of the film.\n\nThe strong female cast is further enhanced with Mackenzie Davis playing the soldier from the future, Grace. She made for a great action hero, and she does overshadow Natalia Reyes playing Dani who until the final moments, is relegated to a damsel in distress role for most of the film.\n\nGabriel Luna also makes for a good villain and being the bad guy in a Terminator film, he doesn’t get to say very much but he is good at the silent evil stares.\n\nIn the overall ranking of Terminator film’s this is a tricky one to place. The original two are stone cold classics and can’t be touched, so it’s a battle to become third place.\n\nIt’s certainly better than Genisys but it also suffers the same problems in a lesser way. A good action film, loved the new hero and villains but it was the introducing of new plot points into the lore that spoiled it for me.\n\nAs much as I love the Terminator franchise, if it wants to continue, it needs a fresh new idea. Leave the John Connor storyline behind and try something else.\n\nDisney pokes a little fun at the superhero genre in this high school coming of age tale\n\nThe film industry took a while to turn to the stories and character of the comic book world for inspiration. I would say the 1970s was the slow start with the emergence of Christopher Reeve as Superman.\n\nThe film was successful, and the inevitable sequels followed. Other studios cottoned onto the idea and started searching for similar properties. But as the years progressed, it really was a mixed bag.\n\nFor example, Batman, directed by Tim Burton, went through the roof when it premiered in 1989. The same year, Dolph Lundgren bought The Punisher to the big screen, far fewer people were interested.\n\nAs the comic book adaptations continued through the 90s and early 2000s, there were many great films, titles I love, that also became cult classics, but again, only a select few hit the big time. Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man and Bryan Singer’s X-Men really captured an audience outside the hardcore comic book fans.\n\nWhat I’m trying to convey is that cinema was very different before Marvel started their own run of films with Iron Man, released in 2008. Who would’ve guessed that they would effectively be carpet bombing the cinema with up to four films a year! (They did in 2017!)\n\nIn 2005, Disney made their own superhero film. This was before they bought out Marvel, and it wasn’t based on any existing property. The film is Sky High, our would-be hero is Will Stronghold, just your average teenager about to start high school. While Will may be average, his parents are certainly not. His father, Steve Stronghold is better known to the world as The Commander, an almost invincible superhero.\n\nWill’s mother is Josie DeMarco-Stronghold, again, better known to the population at large as Jetstream, a superhero whose main trait is the power of flight.\n\nBecause of his parentage, Will has been enrolled in Sky High, a superhero school that is situated on a moving antigravity platform, as the name suggests, high in the sky. The problem is, Will hasn’t developed any superpowers of his own.\n\nWill’s first day of high school will be with his best friend Layla, who already has the power to control plants and, as we will soon discover, has a long harbouring crush on him.\n\nThe adventure that follows is an almost textbook Disney coming of age tale mixed into a superhero world, and it works, really well, with its tongue firmly in its cheek. What helps propel this story is the fantastic cast of both kids and adults.\n\nWill’s father, Steve, is Kurt Russel, and he’s great in the role. He’s eager for his son to develop his own powers so that they can fight crime as a family team. He’s so eager, he even half-jokingly brings up the idea of dropping Will into a vat of acid to see if that will kick-start his powers. Probably a reference to Daredevil, which had been adapted into live action a few years previously.\n\nSteve’s wife, Josie, played by Kelly Preston, quickly shoots this idea down, and it’s clear that she is also more of the brains in their roles as a superhero couple.\n\nThe rest of the adult cast are primarily the school’s teachers and staff. For starters, the school coach, a superhero known as Sonic Boom, is played by Bruce Campbell. As the freshman arrive, he will assess the kid’s superpowers and determine whether they are superheroes or sidekicks. Of course, this will be achieved in a variety of ways, which really plays up to Bruce’s strengths.\n\nAs a fan of the Canadian sketch show series, The Kids in the Hall, it was great to see two of the team appear in Sky High. With an enhanced, larger comedy forehead, denoting greater intelligence, Kevin McDonald as Professor Medulla, the mad scientist. Medulla is there to educate all those destined to be heroes about science and technology.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, and the other Kids in the Hall alumni, Dave Foley as Mr. Jonathan Boy / All-American Boy. Jonathan was formerly a sidekick to The Commander. He tries to pass on all his skills to those who are seen as the lower form of being a superhero, the sidekick. Although, to be more “politically correct”, it is referred to as Superhero Support.\n\nFinally, the dean of the school is none other than the wonderful Linda Carter. The obvious joke here being that she played Wonder Woman in the successful TV series in the late 1970s.\n\nThe kids are great too, and all have unique and quite different powers from the norm that you know will come in handy in some form before the end of the film. While you may recognise some classmates, the one name that did seem to have the more successful career is the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead.\n\nMix this cast into the story and Sky High is a joy to watch. It feels even funnier this time around after more than a decade of a steady stream of Marvel and DC titles with its light ribbing on the whole genre. (I’m pretty sure I caught the original cinema release.)\n\nThere are fun moments such as The Commander / Steve becomes so angry dialling on the phone, he accidentally breaks it into tiny pieces. He opens a kitchen draw to reveal an entire stash of new phones ready to go!\n\nOf course, regular high school events also become elevated into larger action pieces such as the fight in the cafeteria, especially when one of the assailants has the power of Pyro kinesis.\n\nAs you can tell, I had a great time with Sky High and thoroughly recommend it. Because it’s a Disney production, this is a film the family can enjoy too as it’s a bright colourful world with nothing you’ll find offensive. A wonderful little gem currently hidden away on Disney+.\n\nAvailable On | PC, Xbox Series X/S & PlayStation 5\n\nVersion Reviewed | PC\n\nHarold Halibut is a beautiful, captivating story but not really a game\n\nHarold Halibut was a game that took me completely by surprise when I first discovered a trailer on YouTube. What captures your attention the most are the fantastic visuals.\n\nThe game looks like a lovingly crafted stop-motion film, and this was the original idea. The original small development team had more experience in crafting in the real-world vs the digital one. So all objects, characters, and sets were built as real miniatures and then photographed from all angles so they could be recreated in the digital world.\n\nThe result is a beautiful, wonderful small scale world that pops in three dimensions, even through your screen is flat (or maybe curved). The textures of the clothes and materials are so detailed, you just want to reach out and grab what’s in front of your eyes. This is a ten-year labour of love, and it shows, but games are not just about how pretty they are, there has to be something to actually do. That’s where the story comes in.\n\nDuring the height of the Cold War, sometime in the 1970s, some of the richest families and corporations on Earth decide that world events are making it too precarious to stay. These people grouped together to build the Fedora, an ark like ship that will take people on a journey through space in order to find a new home.\n\nAfter drifting through space for over two hundred years, a solar flare causes the Fedora to make a crash landing on an alien water planet. The Fedora and its inhabitants adapt to a new life living underwater.\n\nFifty years pass by, the story centres on a young man by the name of Harold Halibut. He lives under the science laboratory of Prof. Jeanne Mareaux and performs odd jobs for her and usually anyone else that asks.\n\nOne of Harold’s main duties is to ensure that one of the filter systems on the module is regularly maintained and cleaned. Then on one fateful day, Harold finds something has become trapped in the filter system, a colourful, humanoid fish person. This is just the start of an amazing adventure for him.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not always a great adventure for us. When I first saw Harold Halibut, I had assumed it was the true traditional point and click adventure. Seeing as your standard controller is the way to play the game, I stopped waggling the mouse around with an inkling of disappointment.\n\nThere are very few controls in this game. The left analogue stick is for moving Harold around, the A button is for interaction when prompted, X will make Harold jog rather than run and Y will bring up his PDA device. The PDA allows Harold to receive messages from others on the Fedora and to keep track of any ongoing tasks, which will rarely ever be more than two at a time.\n\nAs with any adventure game, as the story progresses, some more areas of the world will open up and that jog button will become your best friend.\n\nRemember some old point and click adventure games of the old days? You could double-click on the edge of the screen to make your character jump to the next area, rather than having to wait for them to walk all the way across the screen. I really missed that in Harold Halibut.\n\nWhile the playing area is fairly large, you will be travelling all over it repeatedly, and jogging is the fastest way to get anywhere. I honestly found it a little tiresome by the game’s end.\n\nIt’s a shame that there are several sequences that appear to have been originally some form of puzzle that would have broken up the narrative a little. The puzzle elements have been stripped back to nothing.\n\nFor example, at one point, Harold must unscrew numerous overlapping electrical panels to reveal the wiring beneath. It’s simply a case of unscrewing every visible screw until all the panels fall away. There was nothing to really think about.\n\nAnother section near the end of the game has you piloting a submarine with some apparent dangers floating nearby. But with no energy/life meter to speak of, you can put down the controller and enjoy the ride. It makes no difference. It’s a real shame as it would have been nice to flex the mental muscles occasionally.\n\nThis isn’t a traditional point and click adventure, either. You’re told to meet someone, they ask you to do something for an explained reason, you go and do it. It becomes more nuanced than that with how the story develops, but you never find items to use in puzzle solving situations. Harold never has to think.\n\nWhen you talk to a character, I was fully expecting the list of questions to pop up on the screen, but that only happens a handful of times and then doesn’t make any difference to the outcome.\n\nSo, what kept me playing for the game’s eleven-hour runtime, that’s with a few side quests thrown in, was the visuals and more importantly the story.\n\nHarold Halibut features a great collection of characters both young and old who have been voice by a cast that makes you feel for them. Most of what you do in the game will reveal more about each person as they become fully rounded characters. I think Buddy the postman was the one who I became particularly attached to and I think was the highlight of the story for me.\n\nThat’s why you probably get a sense of disappointment from this review because I was expecting an adventure game. Harold Halibut is much more of an interactive story with only a little thinking required from the player, and a lot of walking!\n\nHarold Halibut reminds me of games like Firewatch or maybe, to a lesser extent, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. It’s a good story, with an amazing aesthetic, that had me captivated from the start, but it’s not a traditional game. If you go in with those expectations, you’ll enjoy yourself.\n\nIf you had a chance to bring your loved ones back from the dead, would you?\n\nI remember watching the trailer for Replicas when it first appeared, and it didn’t exactly make me want to rush out to see it, but I was interested. This relatively mid-budget film came and went without much fanfare and feels largely forgotten.\n\nStarring Keanu Reeves, Replicas is the story of a brilliant scientist, William Foster, who along with his team and trying to implant the consciousness of people who have recently died into a robot body with an artificial brain.\n\nWilliam is of course thinking of the medical and life-saving practicalities, but one day he will use this technology for a reason he could never have imagined. However, it is not going to go well.\n\nThe film opens with William and his team trying to transfer the mind of a recently deceased soldier to the robotic body. In a scene that reminded me of exactly the same situation from Robocop 2, the transferred mind of the soldier is unable to accept his new body and tries to kill himself. William shuts down the power, stopping the robot in its tracks.\n\nThe head of the Bionyne Corporation informs William that if he isn’t successful in his experiments soon, the entire, very expensive project, will have to be shut down.\n\nThe Foster family live in Puerto Rico, where William had to move to take up the job with the Bionyne Corporation. He lives with his wife, Mona, their three children Zoe, Matt, and Sophie who was adopted.\n\nHe is taking the family on a Christmas holiday and are driving through the night in the pouring rain with poor visibility. A palm tree unexpectedly crashes onto the car, a branch impales Mona, killing her instantly.\n\nWilliam loses control of the car, which runs down the side of a hill before taking a nosedive and crashing into the edge of a lake. He is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen he awakes, he is horrified to discover not only his wife dead, but all three children have drowned. He manages to carry all four bodies to the shore and starts to grieve. But then an idea pops into his head and I bet you’re way ahead of me already.\n\nHe calls up his colleague from the laboratory, Ed, and asks him to bring over the equipment that allows them to take digital copies of their minds. Ed arrives on the scene and is shocked to discover William’s plan, but begrudgingly agrees to go along with it.\n\nSo at this point, you’re obviously thinking that he’s going to brink back his family as a set of robots. Wrong. We are suddenly given a new piece of information that reveals the company has been experimenting with cloning. Ed informs Williams that they can grow a human body in just seventeen days.\n\nWilliam is happy, if he can figure out how to transfer the minds he copied into these new bodies, he will have his family back. What could go wrong?\n\nWell, as it turns out, quite a lot, otherwise it wouldn’t be much of a film. There are, however, strange choices made by characters and leaps of logic and various other small problems that make this film strangely watchable but for the wrong reasons.\n\nWhen a pair of policemen show up at the family house, it is absolutely pouring with rain outside. Why is that strange? Both men are in crisp, clean shirts that are bone dry. Surely, they’d get walking to the front door?\n\nWhen we witness the tragic car accident, the car sits in the water differently to how it crashed into it. Also, the car is a modern, very expensive vehicle but yet not a single airbag deploys.\n\nWilliams can’t face the task of hiding the bodies of his family and asks Ed to do it, to which he reluctantly agrees. This is almost the last we hear of it, but it seems to be a point brushed away so easily.\n\nThe boss of the Bionyne Corporation, a man named Jones, feels unfairly harsh. When Williams makes an effort to visit work to show his face, Ed has told everyone he has pneumonia. Williams fakes a cough to pass off the lie, Jones thanks him for coming into work even though he’s sick. I think almost anyone else would send him home to rest and recuperate, regardless of the work situation.\n\nYou may say I’m nitpicking but all these little moments add up, it’s not helped by the acting either. We all love Keanu Reeves, but he can’t pull off the convincing drama needed to carry the story. The big emotional moments when he’s kneeling in front of the bodies of his family, or when he must choose which child not to bring back due to a plot point about cloning, are questionable.\n\nReplicas is almost a double act with Keanu and Thomas Middleditch, as Ed, carrying us through the film. Luckily, Thomas fits into the film better and is pointing out the problems and solutions that I as the viewer was experiencing before the characters were. He’s performing some logical heavy lifting to keep the story moving.\n\nIs Replicas a bad film? In many ways it is, but it is still strangely watchable, and I wanted to see where the story will go. Unfortunately, the inevitable happy ending seemed to gloss over any ethical or logical questions that it raised.\n\nIn truth, I had developed my own darker ending in my head during my viewing and the film went halfway there, but I was still disappointed. Once the film had finished, I couldn’t help that this would’ve been better if it had been truncated and been part of something akin to an episode of The Outer Limits or the Twilight Zone."
