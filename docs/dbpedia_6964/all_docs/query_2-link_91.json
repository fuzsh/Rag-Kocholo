Think 'Bridgerton' and 'Poldark' mashed up with My Name Is Earl.\n\nLord Christian Brighty is the talk of the Regency Ton - a celebrated libertine, a heartthrob and a hero to many. But close-up, he is a spoilt, impetuous, life-ruining bastard or at least he was. Because his previously carefree life of casual debauchery, non-stop revelry and infinite privilege has been upended by an unfortunate accident (shot by a cannon after a new servants hazing ritual goes awry) and an even more unfortunate period of recovery, where his intended victim - uneducated but forthright chambermaid Babbigail (Babs for short) - decides straight-talking is the best medicine and thus becomes the first person ever to tell him the unvarnished truth about himself and the consequences of his actions.\n\nSo now, with his narcissism collapsing and faith in the system shattered, Lord Brighty is determined to fix all his past wrongs - and by extension all the ills of Regency society. Accompanying him in his quest are Babs (elevated beyond her station to a chambermaid-cum-adviser role) and dutiful butler Churlington  who would really just like everything to stay exactly as it used to be (as would all Brightys friends, family and the entirety of high society).\n\nWritten by award-winning comedians Christian Brighty and Amy Greaves, whose sketches based on Bridgerton, Poldark and Jane Austen (@brightybuoy) have catapulted them to viral stardom, with over 100 million views across TikTok and Instagram - securing Christians place as the internets answer to Mr Darcy, and earning them a nomination for a Writers Guild Award.\n\nThe show was recorded in Hoxton Hall, London N1 6SH.\n\nAlthough we have no details of further recordings of this show, if you would like to add your details to our mailing list here, we can email you with details of possible future recordings.\n\nTHE CHRIS & ROSIE RAMSEY SHOW\n\nFollowing on from the huge success of their award-winning podcast Sh**ged.
