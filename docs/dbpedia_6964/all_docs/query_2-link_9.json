        "text": "Posted by Ra Moon\n\nSet in the North York Moors, The Secret Garden is based on 1910 Frances Hodgson Burnettâ€™s popular novel, a classic of English children's literature.\n\nHowever, this new adaptation takes place in 1947, in the aftermath of World War II and the partition of India.\n\nMary Lennox (Dixie Egerickx) is an orphaned young girl who discovers a mysterious garden on the grounds of a gloomy isolated mansion owned by her uncle Lord Craven (Colin Firth).\n\nThe supporting cast includes Julie Walters (who you've seen in countless productions including Mamma Mia!, Paddington or the Harry Potter film series), and Amir Wilson (who starred in The Letter for the King and His Dark Materials).\n\nThe curated filming locations of the movie are a visual delight. The Secret Garden pictured in the film is an amalgam of locations, shot all over the United Kingdom:\n\nThe colonial house of Mary's parents in India is located at Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens in Dorset.\n\nThe top floor was CGI'd to a cabin of this 18th-century park, noted for having a unique microclimate that enables rare and exotic species from all over the world to thrive.\n\nThe short railway wagon scene was filmed in the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.\n\n(You can open all the locations on Google Maps by clicking on the links below in the captions â†´)\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nThe swimming pool was filmed in the historic Trematon Castle near Plymouth. Within the castle, courtyard stands a Georgian house.\n\nThe pool, dating from the 19th-Century, was built following the style of India colonized by the British Empire.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nThe exterior of the Misselthwaite Manor, the ancestral home of Mary's uncle Archibald Craven in the Yorkshire Moors, is based on the front facade of the Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire.\n\nBuilt in 1837, the estate currently serves as the British campus for the American University of Evansville.\n\nThis Jacobethan style manor has been used before as a filming location in several other productions including The Ruling Class (1972), The Last Days of Patton (1986), The Haunting (1999), and more recently in the Victoria series (2017).\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films and Jules & Jenny - Map\n\nThe railings outside the courtyard are from the Duncombe Park house near Helmsley, North Yorkshire.\n\nThe land of this privately owned stately home extends 30-acres between the meanders of the River Rye within the North York Moors National Park.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films and Alh - Map\n\nThe tunnel of trees and the Father Time Sundial sculpture pictured above were also filmed on the grounds of Duncombe Park.\n\nA few scenes were also set at Helmsley Walled Garden, an orchard originally designed to provide vegetables, fruit, and flowers to the family living at Duncombe Park.\n\nWe also discovered that some ornate rooms of the mansion belonging to Knebworth House in Hertfordshire (the drawing-room and picture gallery).\n\nThe grounds of this 16th century Tudor manor have been the venue of many top festivals and major concerts since 1974.\n\nThe site is also a popular filming location and has been featured in tons of movies and TV shows including Harry Potter, Midsomer Murders of 1989' Batman.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nThe 16th century Osterley Park and House in the outskirts of London was a bit hard to find in the movie.\n\nThe filmmakers just used the period kitchen of the large mansion that lies in the center of the park.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nWhen the naughty girl starts exploring the area around the house she finds the exuberant sub-tropical Trebah Gardens in Cornwall.\n\nShe walks through a jungle of exotic tree ferns from Australia, the Brazilian gunneras of enormous leaves, or the bamboos originating from several corners of the world.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the beautiful secluded beach and boathouse of the property was the last thing that many soldiers saw before assaulting Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nThe dramatic ruins with a pool is a small temple filmed in the stunning medieval remains of Fountains Abbey near Ripon in North Yorkshire.\n\nFounded in 1132, this ancient Cistercian monastery and the 18th-century Studley Royal Water Garden are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe Fountains Hall country house located here was used to picture the Misselthwaite Manor in the 1993 Secret Garden film.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films and Google Maps\n\nThis glorious gardens compilation could not miss the enchanted world of Puzzlewood near Coleford in the Forest of Dean (Gloucestershire).\n\nThis ancient woodland seems out of a fairy tale. It was featured recently in the Netflix series Cursed and Star Wars: The Force Awakens filmed.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nThe scene when Mary and Dickon find Grace's garden gate was filmed at Woodhall Estate, an 18th-century neoclassical country house in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe yellow flowered-passage is the Laburnum Arch at Bodnant Garden near Tal-y-Cafn in Conwy, Wales.\n\nCreated in 1880, this 55 metre-long pergola walkway is the highlight of this National Trust site.\n\nThe golden Laburnum flowers bloom only for three weeks at the end of May and the beginning of June.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Maps: Woodhall Estate - Laburnum Arch\n\nThe Peto Garden is an Italianate courtyard surrounded by an arcade at Iford Manor in Wiltshire, near Bath.\n\nThis historical Romantic park has never been on the Big Screen before.\n\nImage courtesy of Heyday Films - Map\n\nAnd what about the beautiful hall and interior rooms of the house? They were built in a soundstage in Pinewood Studios.\n\nAccording to National Trust, Calke Abbey wasn't used for filming, but the interiors of this early 18th-century Baroque mansion near Ticknall (Derbyshire) became a key inspiration for the film crew.\n\nCan you help to improve this article about the shooting locations of The Secret Garden?
