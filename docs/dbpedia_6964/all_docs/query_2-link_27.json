We made ‘The Secret Garden’ at Pinewood Studios in England and the class of people who dressed the set were first-rate.\n\n“It looked so great, and it inspired you to make great shots that would have been impossible to get on location. It also had an effect on the actors. They were reverential. I feel now that if you have great facilities and talented people, it’s better to shoot inside.\n\n“I have shot at Brysurmarna, the most modern and biggest soundstage in France. French stages have really good restaurants. The British stages have the best pubs, but there is an ambiguous quality about that — the work can suffer a bit.\n\n“But shooting in Hollywood — on the Paramount streets, at Fox, at Universal — you feel the spirit of all of those movies that have happened before on the same stages and you understand that you are in a magical place.”"
