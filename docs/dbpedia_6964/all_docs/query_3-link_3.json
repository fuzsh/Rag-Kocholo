        "text": "HE GAVE SHAPE TO 80 YEARS of Indian history in \"Gandhi\" and fashioned the elegant decor in \"Dangerous Liaisons.\" For each he won an Academy Award. But in his new film, opening on Friday, the production designer Stuart Craig faced a particularly difficult task -- finding ways to make \"The Secret Garden\" fresh.\n\nThe source material, of course, is Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved story of an orphan whose discovery of a hidden and neglected garden fills her deathly world with life. Published in 1911, the book has spawned adaptations as varied as a Margaret O'Brien film in 1949, a BBC children's special in 1975 and a 1991 Broadway musical. The current version, from Francis Ford Coppola's film company American Zoetrope, was directed by the Polish film maker Agnieszka Holland (\"Europa, Europa\") with a cast including Maggie Smith as the housekeeper and a group of young unknowns. Mr. Craig, accordingly, knew that the secret garden itself -- indeed, the entire look of the movie -- must function as its star; this was a film as much about plants as people, about physical location as a gauge of spiritual growth.\n\n\"It's kind of a fact that the most difficult thing to pull off was the garden,\" the 51-year-old designer said over lunch at Shepperton Studios, just west of London, where he is working on Stephen Frears's new film, \"Mary Reilly.\" \"My fear is that it becomes the set piece and must inevitably disappoint. That became the challenge.\"\n\nAnd not just the garden but its antithesis: Misselthwaite Hall, the Yorkshire mansion where Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) is delivered after the death of her parents in India. Labyrinthine and airless, the house's Gothic corridors signal the disease embodied in Mary's ailing cousin, Colin (Heydon Prowse). Mary's attachment to the garden proves restorative as she moves between the brooding vastness of the mansion and the sickly floral enclosure in need of care and kindness.\n\nThe film's worlds are defined in opposition: The house and its surrounding moors are mysterious and oppressive; the garden, ultimately, becomes radiant and clear. With its prowling mastiffs bounding out of a constant shroud of mist, the Misselthwaite landscape suggests Bronte territory turned up a Gothic notch. Roaming the halls, Mary chances on one forbidden room after another.\n\nMr. Craig deliberately exaggerated the physical context so that Misselthwaite would seem as suffocating as the garden was life-enhancing. \"There was a certainty,\" he recalled, \"that the temperature of the whole thing had to be raised\" to film such \"a delicate book.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
