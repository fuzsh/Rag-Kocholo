        "text": "Teresa and Val - 4/3/17\n\nFrom our first visit at the wedding fair in early 2016 we both fell in love with the venue and its infinite possibilities to arrange a stunning wedding from the exquisite decor, the surprise pool room, the friendliest staff and stunning grounds.\n\nIt was pretty clear from the start that you all love your jobs and the venue and your help in particular, Alison, was vital to ensuring things ran to plan. Nothing was too much trouble, every query met with 'no problem', for every scenario you had valid and insightful advice. Our guests have, without exception, commented on the helpfulness of the staff - in many examples going above and beyond what we may have expected. Please also pass our massive compliments to the chef - the food was exquisite! The set up of the rooms was simply perfect - such attention to detail really set this wedding apart from the countless others we have been to. So thank you once again, from the bottom of our hearts - it really was the best day of our lives and I'm so glad we booked with you.\n\nAeron Greenwoden - 14/5/16\n\nNothing I write can truly do justice to Heatherden Hall at Pinewood Studios and its staff. If you want a wedding in a manor house, you get one.The ceremony room is beautiful with its large arched period windows. We were lucky with the weather, which meant we could take full advantage the gardens, which are full of hidden gems for photos, a beautiful bridge over a pond with a fountain (and for Bond fans out there, it may look familiar ;)) The food was fantastic and two weeks on people are still mentioning the Duck starter, in fact the food was even better on the day then it was at the taster, which is hard to do with mass catering. They really know how to run a party. From start to finish our events planner, Alison Chambers, was so helpful, the answer to everything was 'that's not a problem, we can sort that' and she and the team did. As a bride it's your job to be stressed but I wasn't, our wedding party were a little worried at how calm I was and it was down to the fact that I had nothing to be worried about. It was the best day of my life (so far) and the best wedding I've ever been to ;). Thank you so much.\n\nEllie and David, 12/7/16\n\nWe would love to say a massive thank you to Alison and Donna and the team for their part in helping to organise our big day. Thank you for making our vision a reality and making the whole day flow without any hiccups. It was an amazing day and we couldn't believe how much work you put in and how beautiful the entire venue looked; absolutely spectacular. It completely surpassed our expectations and we were blown away. Also thanks for making us feel at ease throughout the entire process, for helping us enjoy every moment on our wedding day and most importantly for being part of our special day, it really was a fairytale. You did a fantastic job and we couldn't have asked for more."
