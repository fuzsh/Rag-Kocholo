        "text": "I’ve always thought that spring is the strangest season. It’s a vague time of year that teases warm days flush with the smell of hyacinths and then drops a week of bone-chilling storms on you. Yet, its magical charm is undeniable. After months and months of being harangued with bleak winter snows and never-ending nights, spring offers a warm embrace. It’s not just nature that finds itself reborn — it’s the soul.\n\nThat’s why I think that Agnieszka Holland‘s 1993 adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden is the best film ever made about spring. Though considered a children’s film, the movie is actually a spell-binding masterwork. No, really. If you’re too snobbish to give the film a try, consider the talent behind it. Holland is best-known now as a brilliant television director, responsible for bringing key episodes of The Wire and House of Cards to life. The lush colors of the film are the work of famed cinematographer Roger Deakins and the astounding score came from Zbigniew Presiner. Oh, and it was produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Not exactly a shabby group.\n\nIn this version of the usually sugary-sweet tale, Mary Lennox is played by Kate Maberly. The young actress plays the orphan girl like Hermione Granger without the charm. She’s pushy and morose, stubborn and self-righteous. She looks at everyone with pure disdain that she’s adopted as armor against getting hurt. Discovering the garden and the promise of spring isn’t some cutesy project for the girl; it’s her one chance to reclaim hope in a world that has continually shunted her to the side as an inconvenience. The idea that a dead thing isn’t gone at all — merely in hibernation — becomes a switch that sparks new energy in Mary. Bringing the secret garden to life means affirming that there can be life, love, and hope. It’s about proclaiming that life is worth living.\n\nCoincidentally, The Secret Garden also makes for a glorious meditation on the struggles inherent in overcoming grief and depression. The characters in the film all suffer from lack of love. As spring returns to the Manor, and as everyone falls under the spell of the season’s rebirth, they all learn to express themselves in new honest, thankful, and joyous ways.\n\nOf course, if you still need a reason to watch The Secret Garden, make it to see one of Maggie Smith‘s most nuanced performances. Yeah, she’s good on Downton Abbey, but her take on Mrs. Medlock, the bitter housekeeper in charge of corralling Mary and keeping her invalid cousin Colin alive, is extraordinary. Smith manages to play Medlock as both an indifferent harpy smothering Mary’s hopes for fun and as a deeply wounded and caring woman. While most of the film is from Mary’s point of view, Holland gives Smith an incredible breakdown towards the end that humanizing someone who might otherwise be seen by the audience as a two-dimensional villain. Smith collapses on a grand staircase and we watch — from above and behind — as she barks at her sweet young maid Martha’s attempt at comfort, before melting into a pile of sobs. Medlock wasn’t the villain. She, too, was chained by the spell of depression, sorrow, and winter.\n\nThe Secret Garden is a small triumph of a film. It’s bewitching and understated, moody and sweet, and can be watched by the whole family. Oh, and it just so happens to be streaming on Amazon Prime right now.\n\n[Watch The Secret Garden on Prime Video]\n\n[Photos: Everett Collection]"
