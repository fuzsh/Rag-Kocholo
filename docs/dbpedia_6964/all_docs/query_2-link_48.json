Advice is offered without charge at all studios and on locations in London & South East England.\n\nWith today’s increased legislation, it is more important than ever to have a professional solution and to comply with EU regulations. It is now a legal requirement to segregate waste types that are classed as hazardous and store on site in UN approved containers. These include waste resins, paint tins, mastic tubes and aerosols. Even empty paint tins with residue paint and containers that have residue adhesives are now classed as Hazardous. It is illegal to put these items into a mixed waste skip!\n\nHazgreen can ensure that your production is not only recycling efficiently, but also working legally and ethically."
