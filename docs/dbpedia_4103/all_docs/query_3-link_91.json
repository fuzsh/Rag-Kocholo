        "text": "Thirteen minutes before the end of the one-hour-and-55-minute-long film, the husband, who had gone mad since his wife went missing some months ago, incidentaÂ­lly reaches a spot along a ghat on the Hooghly river from which a skeleton had just been recovered. He runs to the skeleton, grabs and hugs it crazily, and draws it onto his lap. He identifies it as his wife Taralaâs by the bangle on its wrist that had his name embossed on it. He refuses to let go of his âwifeâ.\n\nThe family friend, a doctor who had driven him to the spot, agrees to take the skeleton back with them and the locals donât object to it. The skeleton would be of best use to a doctor, they agree.\n\nBack in Calcutta, inside the doctorâs chamber, the skeleton is kept in a standing posture on a base. One day, as the doctor falls asleep on his chair out of fatigue, one hand of the skeleton tenderly runs the fingers through the doctorâs hair. He wakes up but is not scared. He asks the skeleton to return to its âoriginal shapeâ. As it takes the shape of the missing woman, the doctor asks for the name of her murderer, so that he can be punished. But, the skeleton replies, there is no need for it, as she wouÂ­ld complete the task herself.\n\nSome moments later, the culprit, also an acquÂ­aiÂ­ntance of the doctor, enters the chamber when it is empty. He is shocked by the presence of the skeÂ­leton and again upon spotting the iron bangleâa Bengali Hindu wedding markerâon its wrist. The skeleton then grabs him by the throat and yanks him up in the air. He is dead in seconds. The doctor, who rushes in along with others upon hearing the screams, heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nThe police, who were already on the lookout for the man in connection with a case of theft, reach the spot to find him sprawled on the floor. With a wry smile, the doctor informs police, âA power greater than you has already punished him.â\n\nThe story is from Naresh Mitraâs 1950 feature KanÂ­kal (Skeleton)âconsidered the first Bengali horror talkie. It was just a year after the release of Mahal in Hindi, often considered the first succesÂ­sful Indian horror film. Kankal is also considered the only one of this genre in Bengali cinema in the 1950s. From the same period, poet-filmmaker PreÂ­Â­mendra Mitraâs Kalo-Chhaya (1948) and HanÂ­aÂ­bari (1952) are usually described as suspense thrillers. In place of a ghost, Hanabari had an ape-like beast as the main source of horror and a whodunnit became the driver of the narrative.\n\nSince Kankal, ghosts have appeared in Bengali cinema with a wide range of purposesâfrom the King of Ghosts showering three incredibly powerful boons on the protagonists of Satyajit Rayâs GooÂ­py Gyne Bagha Byne (1969), to the ghost of the zamindar which fails to grab an orchard from a farmer in Tapan Sinhaâs 1980 classic BanchhaÂ­raÂ­mÂ­er Bagan, and the ghost of pishima (paternal aunt) protecting her jewellery box in Aparna Senâs Goynar Baksho (2013). More than horror, they served the purpose of comedy. But almost always, they were meant to convey some social message.\n\nIn contrast, Kankal had no pretence of allegory or metaphor in its use of the supernatural. One of its protagonistsâthe doctorâhad placed strong arguments in favour of the existence of spirits soon after carrying the skeleton back to Calcutta. At the time of its release, the film had earned critical praise for its technical dexterity, despite glaring holes in the plot.\n\nBut horror movies as a genre did not pick up pace in Tollygunj, even though suspense thrillers, often with a tinge of the occult, kept getting made to popular acclaim. Most notable Bengali ghost films display certain common themesâfrom unsÂ­atisfied desire to unfulfilled life mission, ensuring justice to supporting the underprivilegedâand are rarely spooky.\n\nTwo of the most notable ghost movies in Bengali are adaptations of Rabindranath Tagoreâs short stories. In Tapan Sinhaâs 1960 movie, Kshudhito Pashan, a tax collector who reaches a village and decides to put up in a palatial âhaunted houseâ till his work is over, finds himself living amid ghosts of women victims of the original owner. A particular ghost starts engaging with him, lures him to nooks and crannies of the palaceâbut instead of developing into another Gothic romance, the narrative brings to the fore two centuries of history.\n\nThe 1961 film Monihara (The Lost Jewels)âa segment in SatÂ­yÂ­ajit Rayâs Teen Kanyaâis an adaÂ­ptation of Tagoreâs eponymous short story, in which the ghost of a wealthy businessmanâs dead wife returns to reclaim her jeweÂ­llery. It is the only horror film in Rayâs oeuvre.\n\nâLoneliness is the theme of MonÂ­iÂ­hara,â British author Andrew Robinson wrote in his book Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye. âRayâs story is considerably different from Tagoreâsâ¦ he has intensified both the mystery and the horror in the original.â He added that Rayâs drama was âmainly psychologicalâ, âflesh-tingling rather than nail-bitingâ.\n\nWith GooÂ­py Gyne Bagha Byne, Ray introduced ghosts in an entirely different way than earlier seen in Indian cinema. The King of Ghosts is perhaps the first benevolent ghost in cinema, and the scene of the dance of the ghosts has gone on to become iconic in Indian cinema.\n\nSurrounded by dozens of ghosts in the dark of a forest, Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer are scared, till the King of Ghosts offers them three boons of their choice for pleasing him with their music. These three boons later help them end the tyrannical rule of a despotic king.\n\nTwo years later, Tarun Majumdarâs 1971 classic Kuheli opened in theatres. It has been alternativÂ­ely described as a masterpiece of the genres âhorrÂ­or-thrillerâ or âsuspense-thrillerââwhich has few peers in Bengali cinema. Here, a woman who lands in a godforsaken place called Nijhumgarh as a governess at a bungalow, starts noticing events that defy logic and explanation. These eventually get linked to murders that took place in the house some years ago. Lata Mangeshkarâs songs added to the eerie atmosphere, just like her voice had done in the 1949 Hindi film, Mahal. Kuheli was a major box office success.\n\nIn Tapan Sinhaâs Banchharamer Bagan, though, the ghost serves more the purpose of comedy than horror. Adapted from playwright, actor-Â­theatre-director Manoj Mitraâs play SajÂ­ano Bagan, the ghost of the greedy zamÂ­iÂ­ndar in this film is in no way spooky. Rather, it makes the audience laugh. The ghost keeps waiting for orchard owner Banchharam to die, so that his son, the current landlord, can take possession of the land. But though a tenacious BancÂ­hÂ­hÂ­aram ages and is crippled by ailments, he just does not die.\n\nFor nearly three decades since then, Bengali cinema did not produce films on ghosts that could make a mark. The 1989 film Nishi Trishna, dubbed as the first Bengali vampire movie, had no claim to critical acclaim. Though made as a horror film, the present-day viewer would probably find it difficult not to laugh at the ham acting and dull plot.\n\nOne of the major constraints of making ghost or horror films is the lack of technÂ­ology for quality special effects, or their high cost. Of course, the likes of Ray, SinÂ­ha or Majumdar could bypass this limitation with careful choice of narratives and deft use of the craft, but then they were acknowledged masters.\n\nThe dry spell of good ghost films ended in 2012 with Anik Duttaâs refreshing Bhooter Bhabishyat and Aparna Senâs Goynar Baksho the next year. In both, the ghosts arenât scary, but help advance the narrative with wit and metaphor. If Duttaâs story was original, Senâs was a screen adaptation of Shirshendu Mukhopadhyayâs short novel.\n\nIn an interview after the release of Goynar BakÂ­sho, Sen had said that the ghost of pishima from Mukhopadhyayâs story used to chase her. âI liked pishima so much that I did not want to let go of her at the point where Shirshenduda brings her character to an end in the storyâ¦ so even as a ghoÂ­st, she keeps evolving. I found it very interesting that someone could be so much in love with life that she canât forsake it even after dying,â she had said."
