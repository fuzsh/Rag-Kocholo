He had previously worked on two movies. He went on to collaborate many times with Ray, gaining worldwide fame for this association. Ray later commented on the amateur appearance of his first work: \"Judged on the level of craftsmanship, there was much that was wrong with my film. . . . The early part clearly shows we were groping with the medium. Shots are held for too long, cuts come at the wrong points, the pace falters.\" Other critics have more generously judged that the director and his editor allowed the material, the natural rhythms of the village life and landscape, to dictate the rambling style of the film.\n\nDutta, under Ray's close supervision, developed a cutting style of great economy, but one which could reveal the poetry of the content. Akira Kurosawa commented that \"his work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river.\" Dutta's editing skills are most apparent in scenes of dialogue, such as the picnic and memory game in Aranyer Din Ratri. Ray described in a 1966 article, \"Some Aspects of My Craft,\" the alternative assemblages Dutta would put together for him: \"These offer endless variations of emphasis, unlimited scope for pointing up shades of feeling. It is not unusual for an important dialogue scene to be cut in half a dozen different ways before a final satisfactory form is achieved.\"\n\nDutta has worked with other directors, including James Ivory on his first film, The Householder. But he has otherwise lived an almost reclusive life in the film community of Calcutta, rarely being seen in public.\n\n—Stephen Brophy"
