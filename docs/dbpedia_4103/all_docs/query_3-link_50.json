The music of the 1969 masterpiece is being given an Indo-Western twist by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. British Indian composer Soumik Datta will present his 'King of Ghosts' at the Alchemy festival on May 19.

I would say its a psychological drama with an element of thrill. There is crime but it is also about relationships, though not of the Nishijapon kind. Hit-list has a different feel and texture than the Feluda films. Then there are female characters in the film, unlike in Feluda (laughs). So, its a new experience for me as well. Whats the story of Hit-list?...\n\n↧\n\n↧"
