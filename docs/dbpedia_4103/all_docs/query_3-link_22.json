        "text": "News\n\nCity News\n\nkolkata News\n\nWhy didnât Kishore Kumar agree to act as Goopy for Rayâs film?\n\nThis story is from August 4, 2018\n\nWhy didnât Kishore Kumar agree to act as Goopy for Rayâs film?\n\nFile photograph of Satyajit Ray with Kishore Kumar and Sandip Ray.\n\nKOLKATA: Not too many know that Kishore Kumar had a âManik mama rackâ at his Mumbai residence. Manik referred to Satyajit Ray and this rack was meant for pirated videos of Ray films that the legend had sourced for his personal library. On the singerâs 89th birth anniversary on Saturday, director Sandip Ray spoke about the bond his family shared with the legend even though the latter had turned down the iconâs offer to play Goopy in âGoopy Gyne Bagha Byneâ (GGBB).\n\nThat Kishore Kumar had financially helped Satyajit Ray during the making of âPather Panchaliâ (1955) is an open secret. He also didnât charge a penny for singing in Rayâs films. âCharulataâ, where Kishore had sung âAmi chini go chiniâ, had released in 1964. The busy Kishore had requested Ray to fly down to Mumbai to record this song. Ray had got wife Bijoya to record a version of the Tagore song that he carried along with him to Mumbai. Kishore had learnt the song from there and then recorded it. The song starts with Kishore singing to piano accompaniment. Before the song was used in the film, the orchestration for it from the stanza âami akashe patiya kaanâ was done in Kolkata.\n\nIt was a year later that Ray had started planning for âGGBBâ. âHowever, the original producer RD Bansal had backed out. He had already produced âCharulataâ, âKapurushâ and âMahapurushâ. But, things didnât fall into place for this film with him. Later when it was made, Purnima Pictures presented it,â Sandip says.\n\nRay had wanted Kishore to play Goopy. âAt that time, Kishore-da was very busy. He was recording three to four songs a day in Mumbai. In order to play Goopy, Kishore-da would have to shoot exhaustively. He needed to go to Rajasthan as well as shoot in Kolkata. He just couldnât find time for that,â Sandip says.\n\nIncidentally, a story doing the rounds online is that Kishore had originally wanted his brother â Anup Kumar â to play Bagha. Since Ray had already thought of Robi Ghosh to play this role, Kishore had agreed to disagree and bowed out citing date issues. Does this back story have any authenticity? Sandip doesnât think so. âRobi kaku was the first choice for Bagha. Kishore-da loved and respected Baba a lot. It was impossible for him to make such a request,â says Sandip, who has also directed a documentary on Kishore titled âZindagi Ek Safarâ.\n\nMany had tested to play Goopy after Kishore couldnât do the film. âEven Soumitra kaku (Soumitra Chatterjee) had wanted to play Goopy. Ultimately, Tapenda was cast and the rest, as they say, is history. When Soumitra kaku finally saw the film, he said: âNa re Tapen, ami tor theke bhalo korte partam na (I wouldnât have been able to do it better than you, Tapen)â,â Sandip says.\n\nYet, was there a sense of disappointment in the Ray household when Kishoreâs casting didnât materialise? âToo many things were happening then. The original producer had backed out. Baba had started planning âAlienâ. That also fizzled out. Baba had to make âChiriakhanaâ which was originally supposed to be made by some of his unit members. As far as I remember, there was too much of turmoil happening all around,â he says.\n\nBut he does distinctly remember that Kishore was supposed to also sing the songs of âGGBBâ when Ray had thought about the casting. âBut when Kishore-da couldnât act, Baba wanted a fresh voice. Thatâs when Anup Ghoshalâs name came up as the playback singer. He was known to my mother and Baba had also heard him sing,â he added.\n\nOnce the film released, it became a personal favourite of Kishore. Did he ever regret not having done it? âEven if he felt sad, he never expressed it. I think, he was too busy to rue over it. Kishore-da used to love all films of Baba. He had watched all of them multiple times over. At his house in Juhu, he had a fabulous collection of Babaâs films,â he recalls.\n\nThose were the days of Video Home System (VHS). âBack then, Kishore-da would often go to Dubai to perform. There was a person in Dubai who had a fabulous stock of pirated home videos. Kishore-da would tell him to keep track of Babaâs films. He was so addicted to Babaâs films that whenever he heard that one such video had surfaced, he would immediately get hold of it. So, when we went to Mumbai, we would have fun finding which new films of Baba he had got hold of,â says Sandip, gurgling with laughter.\n\nAccording to him, Kishore had the best personal film library in Mumbai. âHe would show it off to us saying: âEi dyakho, eita hochhe Manik mama-r rack (Look, this is Manik uncleâs rack)â. We would look at them in wide-eyed wonder since we didnât even know that videos of Babaâs films were available anywhere. Every year, we would go for mixing in the 60s. It was a routine for us to go to Kishore-daâs house to spend a day at its house,â he remembers.\n\nMuch later when Ray was filming âGhare Baireâ in the 80s, he was sure that he again needed Kishore to sing. This was for the âBidhir bidhanâ song. Kishore was busy with an income tax case and couldnât leave Mumbai. Ray had flown down to Mumbai with a recording of Bijoy Rayâs singing this song. He again wanted Kishore to learn the song by listening to this recording. âThere was no orchestration used for this song. Baba had taught Kishore-da the four lines of âBujhte nari nari ki chaeâ and âChol re chol sobe bharotosantanâ that he also has sung for this film. In fact, Baba had played the piano as well,â he says. Such was his skill that Kishore had finished recording the songs in a dayâs time.\n\nâGhare Baireâ released in 1984. Kishore didnât go on to work in any other films with Ray. But some relationships are for keeps. âThough it was through Ruma-di (Kishoreâs first wife Ruma Guha Thakurata) that we were connected, our relationship with him was impeccable even after their divorce. It remained that way till he breathed his last,â Sandip concludes.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 flowers and plants that will attract birds to your garden\n\nLifestyle\n\n9 habits which will keep your skin young\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 delicious dishes to pair with Idli beyond Sambhar\n\nFood\n\nInternational Tiger Day: Indian national parks famous for Bengal tigers\n\ntravel\n\n10 negative impacts of strict parenting\n\nLifestyle\n\nInternational Beer Day 2024: 8 types of beer and ingredients used in making them\n\nFood\n\nâBeautiful baby girl names with letter 'M'â\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 most famous wildlife safaris across the globe\n\ntravel\n\nSawan special: Easy Makhana Mango Barfi made under 10 mins\n\nFood\n\n10 bird species extinct due to loss of habitat\n\nLifestyle"
