        "text": "Celebrated poet-writer-director\n\nhas, over the years, been influenced by several Bengali literary stalwarts. It comes as no surprise that he has now chosen the Bengali classic, writer Upendrakishore Roychowdhury’s Goopy Bagha, to dramatise for children.\n\nRoychowdhury’s grandson, auteur , had adapted the same tale in 1969, making the popular Bengali film, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. Soon after its release, Gulzar and Ray were in talks to create a Hindi version of the film, but the project never saw the light of day. However, Gulzar translated the original work into Magical Wishes: The Adventures Of Goopy And Bagha, in 2012.\n\nNow, he has dramatised the original story into a Hindi script. The play, titled Googli Jhanak Jaayein, is being directed by Salim Arif. It traces the adventures of two young boys who are exiled into a forest. Gulzar talks to us about children’s literature in India, writing and more.\n\nWhy did you choose this work in particular?\n\nThe story is interesting, and has every element that must be present in any children’s work. It has fantasy, music and a story that young minds will happily enjoy. Also, the story is extremely layered. There are a lot of political undercurrents, too.\n\nOf course, we are following Manik da’s (Satyajit Ray) vision, but this work has gone beyond the realm of the movie’s narrative, and we have added a contemporary perspective to it. One of the kings in the drama is glued to his PlayStation, and there’s a pizza delivery man who does a moonwalk like Michael Jackson.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat do you think about children’s literature in India?\n\nIt’s in a sorry state apart from some Bengali, Marathi and Malayalam writers, and a few English writers, children’s literature is non-existent in our country. There’s no writing produced for young minds in two major languages — Hindi and Urdu."
