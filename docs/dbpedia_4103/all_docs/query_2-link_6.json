        "text": "গুপী গাইন বাঘা বাইন is a 1969 fantasy adventure comedy film written and directed by Satyajit Ray and based on a story by his grandfather Upendrakishore RayChowdhury . It is a musical film, with the music and songs written by Ray himself.\n\nPlot[]\n\nGoopy, a young farmer’s son with a passion to sing and marked absence of talent, is banished by the king from the kingdom, as Goopy has the audacity to disturb the king in his slumber with dreadful singing. Crestfallen Goopy arrives in a forest riding a donkey. He meets Bagha, a drummer from a neighbouring kingdom, who too has been banished by his king for his terrible drumming.\n\nGoopy and Bagha soon are good friends and start their terrible music. They encounter a bizarre dance of the forest ghost. They manage to please the king of the ghosts, who grants them three boons – instant food and clothing, instant travel and musical talent that can spellbind audiences. The key to all the magic is in two pair of slippers.\n\nWearing the magic slippers, they arrive in the kingdom of Shundi. At a music contest held by the good king of Shundi, they enchant the audiences and win the contest and are given positions as court musicians.\n\nMeanwhile, the bad king of Halla, twin brother of the king of Shundi, wants to declare a war. The king of Halla is not really a bad king but is drugged and being controlled by the court magician Barfi. He works for the greedy and ambitious Prime Minister. With their magic powers, Goopy and Bagha avert the war. The twin brothers, kings of Shundi and Halla are reconciled and they offer to reward Goopy and Bagha with their daughters in marriage.\n\nCast[]\n\nProduction[]\n\nSource Material[]\n\nScript[]\n\nFilming[]\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nRelease[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\n[]"
