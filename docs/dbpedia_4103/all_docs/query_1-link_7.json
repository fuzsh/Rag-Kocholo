        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBased in the US, Janus is a film distribution company dedicated to promoting indie & art-house movies of various nations to the US audience. It has preserved works of masters such as Sergei Eisenstein, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini etc.\n\nIf all goes well, not one, but three Satyajit Ray classics will be bought by Janus Films, a popular US film distribution company.\n\nIn an interview with the Times Of India, Arijit Dutta, the heir of the family who produced three Ray masterpieces, ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’, ‘Aranyer Din Ratri’ and ‘Pratidwandi’, said that he was considering selling the movies as it is getting difficult to preserve the negatives and was tired of multiple times the movies were screened without any recognition or compensation/royalty.\n\nDescribing the decision to sell the classics as “very sentimental,” Dutta told TOI, that the negatives were kept in air-conditioned rooms 24X7. Earlier, the negatives were kept at Bombay Laboratories. After it shut down, I picked up the negatives in 1990..” He also revealed that the last coloured reel of ‘Goopy Gyne, Bagha Byne’ was in colour and got lost. However as they had a master positive, it was restored.\n\nAside from the financial burden of preserving the reels, Dutta also complained about the sheer lack of acknowledgment. A 4K version of ‘Pratidwandi’ was selected as part of the Cannes Classics. But despite being the producers, Dutta and his family were not invited to the festival. “So many people not related to the film went to Cannes. But we were not even acknowledged,” rued Dutta.\n\nBased in the US, Janus is a film distribution company dedicated to promoting indie & art-house movies of various nations to the US audience. It has preserved works of masters such as Sergei Eisenstein, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini etc.\n\nOne of the most endearing and enduring children’s films of all time, ‘Goopy Gyne, Bagha Byne’ was released in theatres on May 8, 1969. It was one of the most commercially successful films directed by Ray. The movie ran in theatres for 102 weeks. Aside from winning big at the box-office, the movie also got plenty of accolades. It bagged a nomination for the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThese cars aren’t really Toyota’s own, but account for 50% of its India sales\n\nA list of 15 stocks that FPIs are buying amid an expensive market\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage?
