Hood makes a thoroughly informed socio historical critique of all twenty nine feature films of Satyajit Ray. Structured along themes which the author has identified in Ray's movies this reassessment analyses each film independently on the basis of its individual merits and lapses carefully avoiding the popular hagiography that is common to much of Ray criticism. Having taken us through the two ends of the spectrum of excellence and mediocrity that comprise Ray's work Hood concludes his incisive study by affirming that What makes Ray ascend into the realms of the great is his profound sense of humanity. A highly accessible work on arguably the finest film maker India has ever produced this book will engage not only serious readers of cinematic texts but also be a valuable learning resource for students of film studies all over the world. 476 pp."
