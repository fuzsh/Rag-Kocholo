        "text": "Mumbai, Jan 14 (IANS) \"Goopy Gawaiya Bagha Bajaiya\", an animation film inspired by Satyajit Ray's \"Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne\" -- which released 50 years ago -- will hit the screens on March 1.\n\nDirected by Shilpa Ranade, the project is produced by the Children's Film Society, India in association with Karadi Tales, a publishing house known for children's books.\n\nRanade, who has illustrated multiple children's books written by Gulzar, said in a statement: \"I had read the story and the beauty of the story is that you can re-interpret, revisualise it in your own way without losing the essence. Hence, it is relevant even after so many years.\"\n\nThe idea, she said, was to engage people of today's generation and so the language is contemporary.\n\nSatyajit Ray's son Sandeep saw the film recently in Kolkata.\n\nHe said: \"The story was written by my great grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury in a children's magazine called 'Sandes' that he had started in 1912. When my father Satyajit Ray read that short story much later, he was mesmerised.\n\n\"My father later revived 'Sandes' (it was shut in the 1930s) and Goopi and Bagha was the first story he republished in 1961. By then he was already a known filmmaker. I happened to complain to him that he should make something for us (children). He said 'Let's see, I may make one, one day for you.\n\n\"The film was planned in 1966 and it got made and released only in 1969. It was a big hit then. It is such a nice story that it has stood the test of time.\"\n\n--IANS\n\nrb/bg\n\n(This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed. No part of the story has been edited by The Quint.)"
