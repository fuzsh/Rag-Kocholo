        "text": "This essay examines Satyajit Ray’s children’s film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) to interrogate the ways it signals the utopian. Contending that its utopian desire manifests through the trope of wish-fulfillment (in particular, the granting of boons), it illuminates the trope’s centrality in the film’s imagination and articulation of freedom. Moreover, the essay suggests that the film’s utopianism is also anchored in its irrealist aesthetics. Engaging with the film’s figuration of ghosts and its violation of the narrative structure of the real, the essay illuminates how these formal features inform, and are informed by, a utopian desire. Furthermore, the essay notes that despite its inherent utopianism, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne fails to resolve some of the more obdurate social contradictions in its diegetic world, especially around questions of class, gender, and caste. Arguing that these “failures” are in keeping with its utopian spirit, I suggest they draw our attention to the imperfections of our real conditions of existence and flag the limits of textual utopianism. In so doing, they refer negatively to the social field beyond pointing to the abiding importance of class struggle as the ultimate agent of transformative social change.\n\nThe act of writing, owing to the permanence it craves, may be said to be in continuous interaction with the temporal flow of time. It continues to stimulate questions and open up avenues for discussion. Writing people, events and relationships into existence is a way of negotiating with the illusory. But writing falters. This paper attempts a reading of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in terms of power politics through the lens of the manipulation of written codes and inscriptions in the film. Identities and cultures are constructed through inscriptions and writings. But in the wrong hands, this medium of communication which has the potential to bring people together may wreck havoc on the social and political system. Writing, or the misuse of it, in the case of the film, reveals the nature of reality as provisional. If writing gives a seal of authenticity to a message, it can also become the casualty of its own creation. Key words: Inscription, Power, Politics, Writing, Social system\n\nEuropean genre of travel writing is guided by an “ethnographic impulse” which constructed India as an exotic space. Neglecting the country’s vast complex and liberal culture, the European travel narratives about India focused on certain negative aspects like ignorance, women subordination, casteism, and religious conflict to construct India as a primitive and exotic space, an excuse for colonialism. In contrast to these the British presented themselves as civilised, rational, masculine and enterprising. Resisting these definitive absolutes, postcolonial travel writers challenge the construction of India in terms of exotic barbarity. Goopi-Bagha trilogy (Satyajit Ray’s Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne (Adventures of Goopi and Bagha, 1969), Hirak Rajar Deshe (The Kingdom of Diamond, 1980) and his son Sandip Ray’s Goopi Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopi and Bagha, 1992)), though primarily children’s fantasy films, uses the motif of travel to challenge the Orientalising gaze of the European tra...\n\nIn this research paper, I analyze the effects of institutionalised ways of reading 'gender' and 'caste' in Marathi literature with reference to Baburao Bagul, one of the important Dalit writers, short stories with the help of some notions and arguments from Antonio Gramsci's Prison Notebooks, Jacques Derrida's essay \"Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of Human Sciences\", Aniket Jaaware's essay \"Destitute Literature\" and the book Practicing Caste: On Touching and Not Touching. Baburao Bagul's short stories re-valuated the established institutionalized reading practices of gender and caste in literature set by the Marathi writers and critics, mostly upper-caste, before the 1960s. However, other Dalit writers did not venture to re-valuate the representation of gender and caste in literature. Before the concept of 'Destitute Literature' was propounded by Aniket Jaaware, most of the reading/analysis of Marathi Dalit literature followed institutionalized ways of consumption of literature. The dominant practices of reading literature in academia as well as out of it did not spare even the scholars who claimed to be different from the hegemony. The descriptions and analysis of gender and caste were mostly on the grounds of identity politics. For example, all the essays in the Marathi book Samagra Lekhak: Baburao Bagul (Complete Writer: Baburao Bagul) edited by Dr. Krushna Kirwale offer the institutionalized readings of Bagul's stories, their form, content, and the characters. I attempt to critique such earlier writings and criticism written on Baburao Bagul's stories and re-read the stories in destitutionalised way.\n\n\"Freedom of mind is the real freedom. A person, whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man. One, whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prison, is a prisoner and not a free man. One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead. Freedom of mind is the proof of one's existence\", B.R.Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches. The distribution of power within a society and the endorsement of power reflects the inherit inequality between low and higher caste people. They tried to break down the fixity of the dividing lines between domination and subordination and try to overpower the mutants by creating fear. Few character search for identity and thus they get weakened internally through loss and the confusion self, thereby tries to overpower the people of their community and at home. When individual fails to empower themselves in their community he opens up new and unforeseen spaces of subaltern resistance to the dominant power. They try to readdress the power and empower by incorporating dominant nature to regain their authority. The article focuses on caste and its role played in the novels of Bama, Sivakamy, Urmila Pawar and Perumal Murugan. Marginalized The central character in The Taming of Women is Periyannan who is similar to a spider in web, even if he tries to gain power over varied things and people, someone or the other would cut the webs, he was put down purely because of caste yet he tried his best to gain power inside and outside the family. 'Periyannan gifted the Iyer flowers, bananas, coconuts, two baskets of paddy, a vessel full of tamarind, a\n\nI shall deal with a particular episode in Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s novel Pather Panchali (first published in 1929; I am using the 2001 reprint of the book) that has something of a folktale in its essence. It tells us that at the limits of space – a place at the fringes of the village Nishchindipur – and at the limits of time – the day coming to a close and evening not far away – the young Apu, protagonist of Pather Panchali, and his friend Neelu, during one of their rendezvous, meet an old feeble woman whom both take to be the dreaded Aaturi Dainee (Aaturi the witch). The episode has a marginal existence in the novel itself (Bandyopadhyay 2001: 57-58) and is also omitted by Satyajit Ray in his critically acclaimed cinema version of the novel. Considered suitable for young readers and students the episode is often included in school text-books. I believe that the negligible space accorded to the episode itself notwithstanding, both the elements of folktale as well as the episode built on it are important constituents in the evolution of the character of Apu, the protagonist of the novel, and significant indicators of the ideas, perceptions and value systems constructed by our societies. I hope to demonstrate this in my essay.\n\nBaburao Bagul's Marathi novels from Pavsha to Kondi record the pitiable conditions and the harrowing pangs of Dalit people and women in the pre and post independence era. His novels mirror the Hindu society and its connection to the Varna system which results into the division of the society and poses serious threats to unity and the sovereignty of the country as a nation. He records the rigidity in the Hindu culture, customs, traditions which fracture the psyche of the Hindu people and result into the severe problems. His novels probe into the reasons of the enforced segregation, discrimination, subjugation and the degradation of the women and the depressed classes. This paper is an attempt to explore how the Varna system critically affects the lives of Dalits and relegate their existence to the lesser human beings. Bagul highlights caste oppression, sexism, classism, orthodoxy, religious violence and terrorism, poverty, illiteracy, and superstitions having its origin in the exploitation of Dalits by the upper castes in Hindu religion. The present paper explores this reality depicted in the fictional world of prolific Marathi writer Baburao Bagul and voices the voiceless to expose the extremist elements and fascist forces in Hindu society."
