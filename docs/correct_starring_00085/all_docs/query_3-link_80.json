        "text": "“I always drink to world peace.”\n\nThat’s just one of the myriad oft-quoted lines from “Groundhog Day,” by many lights the life’s masterwork of Harold Ramis, who died Monday at 69. The 1993 film — which starred Bill Murray as a cynical newscaster who goes on a mysterious, fuguelike journey through the time-space continuum while covering the holiday in Punxsutawney, Penn. — has entered the pantheon of classic American comedies, revered for its philosophical loop-de-loops, unabashed romance and characteristically deadpan Murray performance.\n\n“Groundhog Day,” which Ramis wrote and directed (and played a small role in), also has come to be considered a perfectly written film — its screenplay, along with “Chinatown” and “The Godfather,” is regularly taught as a textbook example of structure, pacing, dialogue and swift, vivid characterization. Granted, Ramis was working with an original script written by Danny Rubin, who according to Hollywood legend and lore had delivered a famously flawless first draft. But through their collaborative efforts — and thanks to Ramis’s frequent collaborator, Bill Murray, being willing to take new, darker risks with his heretofore lovably goofy persona — “Groundhog Day” has stood the test of time, taking pride of place alongside “It’s a Wonderful Life” as the go-to holiday movie for families the world over.\n\nBefore “Groundhog Day,” Ramis had delivered a batch of comedies now considered emblematic of the late 1970s and ’80s: “Animal House,” “Meatballs,” “Caddyshack,” “Stripes,” “Ghostbusters.” Most of them starred Murray, whom Ramis met while they were in Chicago’s Second City (that’s also where Ramis met John Belushi, for whom “Animal House” was a breakout hit).\n\nAt a time when so many Americans are getting their comedy by way of YouTube links and late-night shticks, when what we find amusing is as narrow-cast and fragmented as how we vote and where we shop, Ramis’s oeuvre allows us to reflect on a moment, now distant, when we could all laugh together.\n\nIs it any accident that both Ramis and John Hughes — his fellow avatar of 1980s cinema — both hailed from Chicago? The world they collectively depicted on screen was by no means representative; it was blindingly white, conspicuously male and monotonously middle class. But they nonetheless captured enough of the zeitgeist to touch a universal nerve — or, in Ramis’s case, funny bone.\n\nJust as TV anchors historically sought to acquire a flat, Midwestern accent, the better to appeal to the broadest swath of regions and states, Ramis’s work broadly represents America. His films landed in that fertile middle ground somewhere in between sophisticated and slapstick, outrageous and relatable, naughty and nice: They were flyover comedies, in the most humanistic, accessible sense of the term.\n\nEnsuing generations of filmgoers probably know Ramis best as “that guy” in the countless films in which he co-starred with Murray, or Seth Rogen’s dad in “Knocked Up.” That film, of course, was directed by Judd Apatow, who counted Ramis as an influence on his own films, which took raunch and ribaldry to the next level, for better or worse."
