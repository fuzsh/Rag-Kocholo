        "text": "Harold Ramis, who wrote the hit comedies \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Groundhog Day,\" has died. He was 69 years old.\n\nHis other scriptwriting credits include \"Animal House,\" \"Stripes,\" \"Meatballs,\" \"Caddyshack\",\" \"Analyze This\" and the remake of \"Bedazzled.\" He directed \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" \"Gorundhog Day\" and \"Caddyshack.\"\n\nRamis was perhaps best known to film-goers for playing Dr. Egon Spengler in front of the camera on \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II.\" (A proposed third chapter has been advocated in recent years by co-star Dan Aykyroyd).\n\nThe Chicago native was surrounded by family in his Chicago home when he died early Monday morning from complications of autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis, his wife Erica Mann Ramis told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nRamis worked in the famed Second City comedy troupe along side John Belushi and Bill Murray. The trio worked together on The National Lampoon Radio Hour in the early 1970s.\n\nRamis co-wrote the Belushi comedy \"Animal House\" and Murray's \"Meatballs\" in the late 1970s."
