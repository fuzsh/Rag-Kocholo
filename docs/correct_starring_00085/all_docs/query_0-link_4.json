The question we had to ask ourselves then was, 'Can we handle any extra shots and not have the quality suffer?' We already had nine units shooting every single day for three or four weeks just to get the original shots done, and there was no way we could take on any more and not have the quality suffer.

At one point we committed ourselves to having the Ghostbusters fight their way back to being Ghostbusters rather than starting out with them as successes. With this in mind, we were working toward a courtroom scene, but we did not know exactly what should happen there. Meanwhile, the ghosts themselves were very loosely based on the fact that my father was a storekeeper who was once robbed and assaulted by the Scoleri brothers. The whole point of our trial was that the legal system of New York was completely skeptical of the supernatural. At some point, the idea of the courtroom and the Scoleri brothers came together. We thought, what better way to reinstate the Ghostbusters than at the moment of their sentencing to have two ghosts appear in the courtroom? It was one of those nice discoveries that brings ideas together and says what you want to say. It also connected with the notion that negative human emotions have an impact.

I began by generating some rough drawings in my very cartoony style, and then I involved a longtime friend and collaborator, Henry Mayo, to help me firm the concepts into something that was more realistic, yet still broad in intent. It seemed to me that the original draft of the script was 'monster shy' and the ghostly apparitions that did appear were very much of the see-through person variety. There was no marshmallow man, no terror dogs--just a variety of vaporous people.. I could not imagine a Ghostbusters movie without any creature-type ghosts, so I very consciously began pushing the concepts for the Scoleris into a broad caricature direction. I took my cues from the script and extrapolated my own interpretation along lines that I felt would represent the brothers' internal evilness rather than merely suggest what they looked like in life--hence the very exaggerated ghosts that appear in the movie. Both Ivan and Michael were enthusiastic about this approach, and so I hoped to generate further characters of this type of work progressed.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989).

Also, Ivan was really busy finishing Twins, so he was not around a lot when I was boarding the scene. It became even more difficult when I was told that, because of time, the courtroom set was being built at the same time I was boarding the action and they needed the boards to match what the expense account could afford for special effects. For instance, there were only a certain number of chairs that could be thrown about in the scene because the rest were rented and they did not want to touch those. So I had to board the scene keeping in mind that I could use only fourteen chairs. I could also only blow up four pillars and break one wall of glass .\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989).

To achieve this bulk--as well as other specialty costume requirements for the film--Camilla Henneman was engaged to develop a fat-suit that Tim Lawrence himself would wear during the effects shoot. Using techniques akin to those she had employed to put similar poundage on Weird Al Yankovic for his 'Fat' video parody, Henneman constructed an assemblage of spandex pouches filled with a variety of gelatinous materials to simulate the undulating quality of fleshy masses. The finished suit was then sheathed in an appropriately singed prison garment. While the suit construction was in progress, the concept for the overall sequence continued to evolve as the brothers went from walking through the courtroom to walking and sometimes flying to finally being totally airborne. By the time their all-flying status was settled upon, the costumes were too far along to abandon altogether and so flying harnesses were incorporated into the configuration.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 17. Cinefex, USA. Tim Lawrence says: \"For the Nunzio character, I wanted a great gaping mouth. I also had an idea to divide the head into two separate units--the lower jaw to be attached to my shoulders and the upper head to rest on a skullcap, with the two joined together by a single foam latex skin. With this approach, the lower jaw could be sent mechanically in one direction while I turned my head in th opposite direction, thus creating a ghastly twisted cavern in the center of Nunzio's face. Al figured out how to do it using a series of proportionally controlled pneumatic cylinders to move the mass of the lower jaw with speed and precision.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989).

Where Lawrence and crew had gone for the impossibly fat Nunzio, they wanted Tony to be impossibly thin. \"Our first approach was a full-sized puppet with an articulated head directly and analogously attached to a puppeteer. To develop this version, I secured the services of another longtime associate, Mark Wilson, and a prototype was quickly assembled and video tested against black. We achieved a very eerie look--a skeletal locomotion unseen outside of stop-motion, yet with more of a sense of gravity.\" Though Dennis Muren was impressed with the results, he determined that the rotoscope load for such an approach would seriously compromise the production schedule and so the character was redesigned to fit actor Jim Fye. \"We attached the head to a skullcap that positioned it in front of and on top of Jim's own head. Then we lowered the collarbone in the emaciated torso sculpture--which elongated the neck--and styled the hair in such a way that it concealed Jim's head. We dressed him in oversized shoes so that when he was suspended he could direct the toes down or behind, adding a sharper pointed look to the legs. We tattered his prison suit and added extra lengths of cloth strips which were blown about with a fan. We also added small details like finger extensions and droopy pants. All of these measures helped put over the illusion of a much more skeletal being than was actually there.\" A third-scale marionette was also made in prototype form , but abandoned when the costume approach proved fully workable.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989).

Though crude in many respects, the Synthetic, Neuro-Animation Repeating Kinetics module--dubbed the \"SNARK\" system--performed a number of functions and allowed for considerable flexibility of the characters. From parameters outlined by Lawrence, Coulter supervised the efforts of Tim Gillett in the construction of the electronics necessary to link the characters' servos and pneumatics to a computer.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 17. Cinefex, USA. Tim Lawrence says: \"The technology for this kind of control has been around for decades. I worked with animation control systems more than ten years ago, and many of the people I count as valuable coworkers were first met in this Hollywood satellite industry. Only within the past few years, however, has the hardware and software approached an off-the-shelf availability, and we incorporated some of this available technology into an original contour with considerable custom interfacing to arrive at the system we used in Ghostbusters II. With the SNARK system, we could either perform the character totally live--as the information outputs were typical joystick conformation--or we could record the initial performance, keep the parts we liked, and then go back in and electronically edit the other functions a channel at a time until a complete and satisfying performance was in the memory. This could then be played back as stored, or speeded up and slowed down at the touch of a keystroke. There is also an override switch for each function allowing partial playback and partial live performance, as in an instance where an eyeline might be critical yet you would want to keep the animated lip-sync. It is all very similar to photographic motion control. The potential of this concept for creature work is immense.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 17. Cinefex, USA.

To provide the broad articulation required of the Scoleri brothers, mechanical animator Al Coulter and his crew employed some nontraditional technology.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 17. Cinefex, USA. Line reads: \"Bringing Nunzio and Tony to cinematic life meant that Lawrence and Fye had to wear the full body suits for hours at a time while hanging from wires in front of a bluescreen. Given the bulk of the suits themselves--Nunzio weighed close to eighty pounds--a great deal of acting and patience was required. \"I've done a lot of these types of characters,\" Lawrence explained, \"and I've learned that the trick to performing in suites such as these is to have in your mind a perfect mental image of what you look like in the suit. It takes a while to get that knack, especially since you cannot see yourself and often you cannot see a monitor when you're doing a shot. It's actually a lot like acting through appliances where you have to really move your face around behind them to get them to register. With a big foam suit, you have to move a lot and be exaggerated to have something come through. You also have to know how to temper your moves--otherwise it looks like just a bunch of waving around. Actually, with the Scoleri brothers that was kind of what the producers wanted--a lot of extreme motions.\" When the brothers first appear, they are sitting in the electric chairs that ended their lives. In reality, the chairs were miniatures that were shot separately from the ghosts. To make the two elements merge, Lawrence and Fye had to hang in midair and pretend to be sitting. \"In the Nunzio suit,\" Lawrence admitted, \"it was very hard to pretend like I was sitting in midair. Fortunately, one of the crew members was underneath and helped me push my feet up so my legs were bent properly at the knees. Then on a certain count, he would duck away and I would pretend like I was bursting out of the chair and falling forward in a dive. To get the best negative, we needed the biggest image we could get--so we had to stay in the center of the frame. Therefore, if Nunzio was sitting and he had to burst out of his chair in an upward arch and then dive back down, I had to move my arms and feet accordingly, but I could actually swing through the frame. Sometimes if it was a particularly difficult shot, we would do a black-and-white test and make a quick composite to check our moves. Despite the complications, we actually shot the sequence really fast. We filmed on one brother in the morning and one in the afternoon, and we could usually get five or six shots a day of both.\" Though the results were impressive, the essential concept for the Scoleri brothers sequence was ultimately altered and simplified to such an extent that the characters could have been achieved much more simply in other ways.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 17. Cinefex, USA. Tim Lawrence says: \"By the time much of the work had been done, the concept had changed to the point that the brothers were now always in flight, never really spoke, were very transparent and also heavily augmented with roto effects. The facial animation--while excellent--was now all but superfluous. The characters could easily have been done with third-scale marionettes on wires. You just never know how the stuff is going to be used until it is.

To do this, we used very thin mirrorplex that was about a thirty-second -of-an-inch thick and very flexible. If you poke this material on the back with your finger, you get a bump, the image is distorted. By controlling how you move and shape the mirrorplex, you can get different types of distortion. And if you put two pieces next to each other and push one and pull the other and line it up to a reflected image, you can make things twist.\"\n\n↑ Wallace, Daniel (2015).

Our effects coordinator, Ned Gorman, recalled a person he had worked with on Willow named Robin Navlyt. I was convinced no one else would wear the suit, but I had her come in for a fitting and audition. Incredibly enough, she was exactly the same height as Bobby--four-foot-ten-inches--and she fit into both the body pod and the already molded and cast gloves very well.

He was always on the set and kept going for a more subtle approach--which surprised us at first. We thought Slimer's actions should be bigger. But we did a few things his way and realized it was cool. Michael wanted a lovable character--and for him, the lovability of Slimer would come from a subtle, inner humanness that you might not otherwise see because of the way he looks.

At first we thought the answer was to add more of him, so we had an ongoing confrontation between Louis and Slimer in which Louis was constantly trying to catch him. We thought it would be funny and at screenings we expected the audience to cheer and laugh when they saw him again. But nothing. No reaction. The audience was looking at it as a fresh movie. There were a lot of kids who loved to see him, so we knew we could not abandon him completely, but he never really worked with the audience the way we expected. Ultimately, we decided less was better, and in the final film we limited him to two very quick shots.\"\n\n↑ The Good, The Bad, and The Sequel Stitcher \"Special Effects Master Tim Lawrence\" 43:10-43:31 4/17/2019 Tim Lawrence says: \"We shot so much more than got used because again Bill was getting a little itchy about how much Slimer there was. So we started getting cut out again and by the time I left for Gremlins there were only three shots left in the movie and if we shot-if production had gone on any longer, Slimer would have been completely removed again.\"\n\n↑ Wallace, Daniel (2015).

Dan Aykroyd says: \"Vigo came out of the idea of the Carpathians, the Dracu, Vlad the Impaler-that part of the world where there was a lot of demonology and possession and magic. We drew on Sumerian mythology for the first movie, and we drew on Carpathian mythology for the second movie. Vigo was an invention of Harold and myself, almost like a Dracula figure.\"\n\n↑ Wallace, Daniel (2015). Ghostbusters The Ultimate Visual History, p. 122.

Line reads: \"To make the image work, actor Wilhelm von Homburg was filmed in front of a bluescreen and then matted over a miniature of the corridor built by the ILM model shop.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 9. Cinefex, USA. Bill George says: \"The slime corridor was a forced perspective set that was pretty straightforward. Both columns and bricks along the sides had to be built in forced perspective, and they were all sculpted out of foam. There were arches between the columns and beyond those we had light coming in. The only unusual aspect was that the producers wanted slime oozing out of the columns, which meant that we had a major cleanup after each take. It was really no big deal--just a big mess.\"\n\n↑ Eisenberg, Adam (November 1989). Ghostbusters Revisited, Cinefex magazine #40, page 44-45. Cinefex, USA.Line reads: \"The change was accomplished primarily by makeup applications devised by the ILM creature shop. \"It was not the first work we did on the Vigo character,\" noted Tim Lawrence. \"Early during preproduction, we were given a variety of sketches by Thom Enriquez depicted a very overweight-looking character with a wild-eyed look and a facial structure such that it would have been impossible to find anyone who actually looked like that. So at the beginning, we were going to be designing a makeup that would be used on an actor throughout the film. Then when it came time for transformation at the end, Vigo was going to be something much more monstrous--some kind of a huge construction that we never quite worked out completely because the whole concept went off in a different direction once Wilhelm von Homburg was cast for the part. Wilhelm has a very distinctive \"bad guy\" face and Ivan decided to use it without a whole lot of alteration--but he did still want some appliance makeup. So we did lifecasts on Wilhelm and then Mike Smithson and I did a variety of alterations in clay--fairly subtle things like strengthening his jaw line, straightening out his nose, giving him a more sinister brow, elongating his earlobes and sharpening his cheeks. We did ten or eleven versions of the makeup in clay and then photographed them in black-and-white and made up a little book that we sent down so that Ivan and the producers could see the various directions it could go in. They picked one that they liked and we made a set of appliances for this guy. The problem was that they wanted this very elaborate makeup to be used for the whole film and I had asked for three weeks to do it. They said they could only give us two weeks and then wound up giving us one; but they said, 'Don't worry about it, because it's just going to be used for a photo shoot as a guide for the artist who is doing the painting, but that when he comes to life he should look more realistic and less stylized. So we did the makeup very quickly for the photo shoot and then Wilhelm was used without makeup for the film itself.\" The final transformation was likewise toned down. \"We did a lot of drawings for the Vigo monster--some of them pretty horrendous--and we had other things going on as well. At one point the slime was going to bring to life things from some of the other paintings--so we had little Hieronymous Bosch characters running around and a spirally kind of Escher character. Over time, however, all that got more and more watered down to the point where instead of making a Vigo monster we were asked to come up with a makeup that simply represented Vigo's inner evil essence. We sent about fifty concepts down to Michael Gross--some of which were altered photographs. Early in the show there had been some mylar tests done on Ned Gorman--our effects coordinator--to show "
