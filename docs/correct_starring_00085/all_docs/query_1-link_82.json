        "text": "What is Dan Aykroyd's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nDan Aykroyd is a Canadian comedian, actor, screenwriter, and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $250 million. Dan Aykroyd began his career as a member of the Second City comedy troupe in Toronto and later became a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live\" from 1975 to 1979. During his time on \"SNL,\" Aykroyd created memorable characters and sketches, including the Blues Brothers with John Belushi.\n\nAykroyd's film career took off with roles in comedies such as \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), and \"Dragnet\" (1987). He co-wrote and starred in these films, showcasing his talent for both writing and acting. Aykroyd's versatility extended to dramatic roles as well, such as in \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989) and \"My Girl\" (1991).\n\nThroughout his career, Aykroyd has been involved in various television projects, including his own sitcom, \"Soul Man\" (1997-1998). He has also made guest appearances on numerous shows and lent his voice to animated series like \"The Real Ghostbusters\" (1986-1991).\n\nAykroyd co-founded the House of Blues concert venue/restaurant chain in 1992 and launched Crystal Head Vodka in 2007. The vodka is sold in crystal skull-shaped bottles, and the company's revenue topped $80 million by 2018.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDan Aykroyd was born Daniel Edward Aykroyd on July 1, 1952, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. His mother, Lorraine worked as a secretary, and his father, Samuel (who actually went by his middle name \"Peter\"), was an author and civil engineer who was a policy advisor under Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's administration.\n\nAykroyd has a younger brother, Peter, who grew up to be an actor and writer. Dan was born with webbed feet and was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome at the age of 12 and Asperger's syndrome in the early 1980s. He was raised in a Catholic household and had planned on becoming a priest, but changed his mind at 17. Aykroyd attended St. Pius X High School and St. Patrick's High School before studying sociology and criminology at Carleton University. He dropped out of college before earning his degree and performed comedy at Canadian nightclubs; he joined the Second City comedy troupe in 1973 and ran a speakeasy called Club 505.\n\nCareer\n\nAykroyd made his television debut at the age of 17 on Canadian sketch comedy series \"The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour,\" which ran from 1970 to 1971 and starred Hart Pomerantz and Lorne Michaels. Michaels later recruited Dan for \"Saturday Night Live,\" hiring him as a writer and performer. Aykroyd was on the show from 1975 to 1979 and played beloved characters such as Yortuk Festrunk, Beldar Conehead, and Elwood Blues. The Blues Brothers got their own movie in 1980, and John Goodman replaced the late John Belushi in the 1998 sequel, \"Blues Brothers 2000.\" Dan also co-starred with Belushi in \"1941\" (1979) and \"Neighbors\" (1981), and he had planned on co-starring with him in \"Ghostbusters,\" (which Aykroyd began writing in the early 1980s), but after he died of a drug overdose in 1982, Dan rewrote the part of Peter Venkman for Bill Murray. The 1984 film grossed $295.7 million worldwide and led to a 1989 sequel, a 2016 reboot (in which Aykroyd had a cameo as a cab driver), and an animated series (\"The Real Ghostbusters,\" which ran from 1986 to 1991). He reprised his role in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\" which is set to be released in 2021.\n\nIn 1983, Dan co-starred with Eddie Murphy in \"Trading Places,\" then wrote and starred in \"Spies Like Us\" (1987) and \"Dragnet\" (1987). He then appeared in 1989's \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" 1991's \"Nothing But Trouble\" (which he also directed), 1993's \"Coneheads,\" and 1995's \"Tommy Boy.\" In 1996, Aykroyd began hosting \"Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal,\" which was created by his brother and ran until 2000. He also starred on ABC sitcom \"Soul Man\" from 1997 to 1998, playing a widowed priest. Dan has appeared in more than two dozen films in the 2000s, including \"Evolution\" (2000), \"50 First Dates\" (2004), \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\" (2007), and \"Tammy\" (2014).\n\nGhostbusters Salary\n\nIn order to secure the rights to the highly-coveted \"Ghostbusters\" script, Columbia Pictures agreed to some very generous salary terms as negotiated by Michael Ovitz, the principal partner at talent agency CAA. All three principal actors (Aykroyd, Murray, Ramis) plus the film's director Ivan Reitman, would split 30% of the movie's gross revenues at the box office, home video sales and network licensing deals. In the end this turned into $300 million split four ways. That's $75 million per person. After adjusting for inflation, that's the same as $200 million PER PERSON!\n\nFor the sequel, the four principals got an even sweeter deal. They each received a $6 million upfront salary and then split 35% of the gross. \"Ghostbusters II\" was slightly less successful, earning around $215 million at the box office. One could conservatively assume that between salary and backend points, each of the four earned $50 million off the sequel. That's the same as $110 million after adjusting for inflation.\n\nSo, in total without adjusting for inflation, Dan Aykroyd earned approximately $125 million from the first two Ghostbusters. After adjusting for inflation he earned $310 million in today's dollars.\n\nAs the film's creator and screenwriter, Dan has earned millions more from additional sequels, merchandise, comic books and more.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDan was engaged to Carrie Fisher, his co-star in \"The Blues Brothers,\" in 1980, but she left him for former boyfriend Paul Simon. Aykroyd married actress Donna Dixon on April 29, 1983, and they have 3 daughters together: Danielle (born in November 1989), Belle (born in June 1993), and Stella (born in April 1998). Dan was close friends with John Belushi, calling him both a brother and a kindred spirit, and he was devastated by his death.\n\nDan has served as a reserve commander for the Harahan, Louisiana, police department and a reserve deputy for Mississippi's Hinds County Sheriff's Department. Aykroyd is a Spiritualist and is interested in UFOlogy; he is a member of MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) and serves as the organization's Hollywood consultant. His interest in UFOs led him to host \"Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal\" and release the DVD \"Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs.\" In 2009, Dan's father published a book about the Aykroyd's family history with Spiritualism; Dan wrote the introduction to \"A History of Ghosts\" and helped Peter promote the book.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nIn 1977, Dan shared an Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series with the \"Saturday Night Live\" writing staff, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in \"Driving Miss Daisy\" in 1990. Carleton University gave him an honorary Doctor of Literature degree in 1994, and in 1997, he received a Snuffed Candle Award from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry for his involvement with \"Psi Factor.\" In 2002, Aykroyd received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame, and he was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1999 and the Order of Ontario in 2017.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1988, Dan and his brother paid $732,500 for a 4,176 square foot house in Los Angeles and sold it for $2.13 million in 2008. In 2007, Aykroyd bought a 4-bedroom home in the Pacific Palisades for $14.5 million, and the following year, he sold his 4,828 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills for $3.8 million. In 2014, Dan put the Pacific Palisades home on the rental market, asking $45,000 per month.\n\nCrystal Head Vodka\n\nIn 2007, Dan and a partner launched a vodka business called Crystal Head Vodka with $600,000. The triple-distilled vodka is sold in distinctive crystal containers that are shaped like human skulls. By 2011, the company was doing more than $55 million in annual revenue. Today annual revenue tops $80-$100 million."
