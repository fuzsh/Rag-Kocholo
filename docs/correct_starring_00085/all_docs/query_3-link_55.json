        "text": "Groundhog Day commenced with predictions from two of the nation's most popular woodchucks - Punxsutawney Phil and the Chicago area's own Woodstock Willie. But one long-awaited event -- an epic reunion fit for the holiday -- didn't take place until later on.\n\nThe cast of the iconic movie \"Groundhog Day,\" convened at Navy Pier for their first reunion since the film's release more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe event commemorated Chicago-born Harold Ramis, co-writer and director of the cult favorite, who died in 2014. Cast members including Brian Doyle Murray, actor Bill Murray's brother, Marita Geraghty, Peggy Roeder, Robin Duke and Ken Hudson Campbell, shared how Ramis impacted their careers and lives.\n\nMarita Geraghty, who played Nancy Taylor, said Ramis \"ruled the game\" as an extraordinary producer, actor and director.\n\n\"He was so warm, he was so welcoming,\" she said. \"He was calm, even though he was creative. There was just nobody like him.\"\n\nRobin Duke, who played Doris the waitress, known for her singnature line \"More coffee, hon?\" - said Ramis was always present -- but he was so calm, you sometimes wondered who was directing.\n\n\"I always feel like he's around in my life,\" she said. \"It was such a joy to know him and to laugh so much with everything I did with Harold. There was always laughter around.\"\n\nLocal\n\nAnd, of course, the star of the film, Bill Murray, who plays weatherman Phil Connors, made a surprise appearance. Murray did highlight Ramis' impact, but began on a different note -- albeit an appropriate one.\n\n\"We've heard a lot about Harold,\" Murray said, as the crowd erupted in laughter. \"Let's talk about the weather, ok. It appears we're going to have a very early spring.\"\n\n\"He's up there stirring the clouds around, making that low pressure move out over Indiana and just drench and ruin those peoples lives in indiana,\" he said.\n\nThe acclaimed actor and famous Chicagoan appreciated the mild weather, which he thanked Ramis for. Murray came to know Ramis through his brother, as well as others in the film industry, including Joe Flaherty, whom he learned a lot from.\n\n\"Those people were wonderful me, were very kind. It's the kindness of those people that made it possible for me to avoid the penitentiary.\"\n\nBrian Doyle Murray said while his friendship with Ramis dates back to the 1960s, there's one thing he's especially grateful for. Doyle Murray credited Ramis for allowing him to meet his wife - who was a production assistant on Groundhog Day.\n\n\"[He was] just the sweetest man you ever knew...\" Doyle Murray said. \"Thank you, Harold, for giving me the opportunity to meet my life partner, and I love you.\""
