        "text": "Early Career[]\n\nHarold was first known as a writer in National Lampoon's Animal House. Harold directed National Lampoon's Vacation in 1983, starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Harold's daughter Violet Ramis had a minor role in the movie. As Randy Quaid/Eddie Johnson's daughter in the movie Daisy Mable Johnson.\n\nFilm Roles[]\n\nHarold was best known for his work on Meatballs, Caddyshack, Year One, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, and Stripes etc.\n\nPassing[]\n\nOn February 24th, 2014, Mr. Ramis passed away due to complications from a rare disease Autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis, a condition he battled for four years. Ramis died Monday morning in his Chicago-area home and is survived by his wife, Erica Mann Ramis, three children and two grandchildren.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nFor Ghostbusters, Ramis decided Egon would never smile per a description of him in the script as a \"New Age Mr. Spock.\"[2]\n\nIn The Real Ghostbusters episode \"Take Two\", Winston mentions Ramis' last name while reading off the cast of the movie being made about the Ghostbusters.[3]\n\nThe Scoleri Brothers are very loosely based on the real-life Scoleri Brothers, who once robbed Ramis's father, Nate Ramis' store.[4]\n\nThe scene of Oscar's kidnapping evolved from Ramis' initial idea about the baby walking like an adult.[5]\n\nDan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis enjoyed the stunt scene of the Ghostbusters rappelling down into the Manhattan Museum of Art's restoration room and did it five times for fun.[6]\n\nJohn Melchior took a flight to Chicago and spoke with Ramis about committing to Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Ramis was somewhat reluctant at first but once he was sure that it was not going be a cheaply made game, then Melchior went to see Aykroyd. [7]\n\nMelchior and the team went to the set of \"The Office\" and after some waiting, showed Ramis the demo of the game during a break from directing an episode.[8]\n\nFor Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Ramis was credited as a writer but to be exact, he did rewrites of the original script by John Zuur Platten and Flint Dille. Aykroyd and Ramis mainly polished the tone of the dialogue and vernacular used.[9]\n\nDuring a debate about the Museum of (Super)Natural History Level, John Melchior called up Ramis for advice. At the time, Ramis was on the set of The Office directing an episode.[10]\n\nOn page 12 of Ghostbusters Volume 2 Issue #1, H. Ramis was listed as one of the authors of the technical report.\n\nIn the Ghostbusters: Mass Hysteria hard cover collection, on page five, Ramis was referenced in Dan Aykroyd's introduction.\n\nIn Ghostbusters: Get Real Issue #3, page 14, an eight pin board in the Proton Pack is named after Ramis.[11]\n\nA bust of Harold Ramis makes a cameo in Ghostbusters (2016 Movie). Ramis' bust is outside of Erin Gilbert's office at Columbia University. When Dean Harold Filmore was about to leave then said, \"Never mind.\" a second time, the bust is in view.\n\nThe bust was given to Erica Ramis, Harold's wife. She in turn gave it to the Ramis Film School at The Second City in Chicago. It resides in the bar. [12]\n\nRamis' son Daniel Ramis has a cameo as the Metal Head who gives Rowan North a high five in Chapter 8 of the 2016 movie.[13]\n\nOn page 215 of Ghosts from Our Past: Both Literally and Figuratively: The Study of the Paranormal (Three Rivers Press), Harold Ramis was thanked in the acknowledgment section.\n\nRamis is mentioned in the Introduction of Ghostbusters 101: Everyone Answers The Call TPB on page 2.\n\nOn page 2 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Ghostbusters Volume 2 Issue #3, one of the Ghostbusturtles has the first name of Harold Ramis.\n\nOn Cover B of Ghostbusters Crossing Over Issue #4, the Harold Ramis bust from outside Dean Harold Filmore's office in the 2016 movie appears on the lower level.\n\nOn page 1 of Ghostbusters Year One Issue #2, Bob Douglas mentions pledging to Delta Tau Chi. This was the name of the fraternity in \"Animal House\" which was co-written by the late Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman.\n\nOn page 4 of Ghostbusters Year One #2, Peter's hairstyle is based on Bill Murray's character Tripper in \"Meatballs\" (1979) which was directed by Reitman and co-written by Ramis. Egon's hairstyle is based on Ramis' character Russell in \"Stripes\" (1981) which was also directed by Reitman and co-written by Ramis.\n\nReferences[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nSelected Photos[]"
