        "text": "Welcome back to another Second Thursday Sequel! This week we will look at one of my favorite sequels: Ghostbusters II (1989). At the end of this film, there is a painting of the Ghostbusters and each character is holding a specific item. I want to relate each item to their personality and even their role in the team.\n\nRay Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) is holding a small tree branch. A branch could be related to the olive branch delivered to Noah by a dove in the bible. Therefore, this branch would represent hope. Ray wants the Ghostbusters to exist even after they were “sued by every state, county, and city entity in New York”. Like the trunk of a tree, he holds the team together even when they have lost hope; he is their hope!\n\nEgon Spengler (Harold Ramis) holds a book. This symbolizes his curiosity and knowledge base. Egon is the scientist. He wants to know how and why things happen. He is continuously doing experiments on people, ghosts, emotions, nature, everything. He needs to have information so much that he “sleep[s] with” the slime to find a “positive reaction”. The book represents his interest in learning all the time.\n\nPeter Venkman (Bill Murray) has a sword. This symbol relates to his courage, determination, boldness, and fearlessness. He pursues Dana (Sigourney Weaver) until she finally gives in even though she tries to fend him off. He also talks back the police when they try to stop the guys from digging into the street. He has no problem talking back to people with authority. Peter is afraid of nothing, not the police, not ridicule, not even a “God” that pops out of a painting. Even when that “God” embodies one of his best friends, Peter still is ready to fight, save the world, and bring Ray back.\n\nPhoto from Ghostbusters Planet.\n\nWinston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) holds a harp. The harp can represent music, art, and, thus, passion. Winston may not have been as invested in ghostbusting as the others in the beginning, but he turns around. He finds their work exciting and interesting. Even after a ghost train tries to run him over, he still sticks with the team.\n\nWinston’s passion is necessary in this film because he is the one explaining things to the average Joes; he sets the science aside and translates the jargon into “English”. He explains the “sludge” to the mayor using Layman’s terms. He feeds into everyone’s passion on the team but makes it relatable to everyday people.\n\nI find it interesting to choose the harp as his symbol. It makes sense when thinking about it representing passion because there has to be something in this job to keep him there. In the first movie, all he wants is a job that pays. However, he still sticks with the guys even after they are not making any money. He loves the job.\n\nWhile the painting at the end of the movie is strange, each symbol was thoughtfully chosen and appropriate for each character holding them.\n\nFan theories are always fun and make you think differently about movies. What if the Ghostbusters died in the first movie? What does that make the second really about?\n\nUnfortunately, I would not find any other interpretations or analyses of this film.\n\nThank you for reading! See you next week!"
