        "text": "Edited By gmanfromheck\n\nWe've been hearing some talk about the next Ghostbusters movie for a little while now. It's hard to say what will actually happen and what won't. /Film found the following quote from director Harold Ramis:\n\nSomething’s going to happen. Dan [Aykroyd] did write a spec GB3 screenplay a few years ago, but no one was motivated to pursue it. Now, 25 years after the original, there seems to be some willingness to proceed and apparently a substantial public appetite for a sequel. We’ll introduce some new young Ghostbusters, and all the old guys will be in it, too. Think Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future … GB3 is progressing with plans to shoot next summer and release in 2011.\n\nMy question is how big is that \"public appetite\" for another movie. Since it has been so long since the last movie, will viewers still care? I am somewhat interested but I can't say I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for this movie to happen. Also the idea of \"introducing some new young Ghostbusters\" sounds a little lame. I suppose my biggest fear is simply that this will turn out really bad. Perhaps I should have more faith. Let's hope that if and when the movie does get made, there will be a good reason. Meaning, there will be a good script. I don't want to see a third movie just trying to cash in on the Ghostbusters name. I also wonder if they will actually throw the number 3 in the title or instead try to give some clever subtitle. The 3 might be discouraging to those that haven't seen or were even alive when the first two came out. At least they have over a year to come up with something clever.\n\nHow many of you have seen the original movies? Have you read the recent IDW comics? Are you looking forward to more ghost-busting action?\n\n#6 Edited By Ectoplasmic\n\nI know my handle makes me biased right off the bat but hear me out, hahah....\n\nDan Ackroyd... As much as I love him he can still be hit or miss. If he wrote the treatment for GB3 solo I'd be a little worried. Not to say the guy isn't a genius. In fact everything that I've loved about the last two movies was his direct contribution (GB science, packs, traps, the occult histories of things) but Ackroyd also has a long career in films where his best work is as a duo with other comedians...\n\nTry naming a great Dan Ackyord movie where he wasn't paired with an equally talented comedian! Ya can't do it!\n\nI think I can say either way that I'm really excited about this. Whether there is a strong enough appetite for a new Ghostbuster film or not there will never be a better time than now. With the right marketing the public can develop the type of appetite the studio wants.\n\nAnd as far as new Ghostbusters goes... It just seems like the only direction to go. I really can't see these men busting ghosts at 60..."
