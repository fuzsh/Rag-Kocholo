British director John Guillermin, whose films included The Towering Inferno and Death on the Nile, has died aged 89.

In a statement, Guillermin's wife Mary called him "sensitive and passionate, full of a fierce rapture himself."

Born in London to French parents, Guillermin attended the University of Cambridge before joining the Royal Air Force.

His career directing began in France with documentary film-making. In 1950, he moved to Hollywood to study film-making methods.

Following the success of disaster films such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure, Guillermin assembled a star-studded cast for The Towering Inferno.

The movie, still regarded as a classic of the genre, about a fire that breaks out on the 81st floor of a shoddily-built skyscraper starred McQueen and Newman - two of the biggest film stars of the day.

Known for his big budget adventures, Guillermin also had a reputation of being a difficult man to work with. In his memoirs, film editor Ralph E Winters, described an incident he witnessed when he worked with Guillermin on King Kong.
