        "text": "British director John Guillermin, whose films included The Towering Inferno and Death on the Nile, has died aged 89.\n\nThe Towering Inferno, released in 1974, won three Oscars and starred Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden and Faye Dunaway.\n\nGuillermin's action-packed 1976 version of King Kong, starred Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange.\n\nHe died on Sunday at his home in the Topanga Canyon area of Los Angeles, his friend Nick Redman confirmed., external\n\nIn a statement, Guillermin's wife Mary called him \"sensitive and passionate, full of a fierce rapture himself.\"\n\nBorn in London to French parents, Guillermin attended the University of Cambridge before joining the Royal Air Force.\n\nHis career directing began in France with documentary film-making. In 1950, he moved to Hollywood to study film-making methods.\n\nFollowing the success of disaster films such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure, Guillermin assembled a star-studded cast for The Towering Inferno.\n\nThe movie, still regarded as a classic of the genre, about a fire that breaks out on the 81st floor of a shoddily-built skyscraper starred McQueen and Newman - two of the biggest film stars of the day.\n\nKnown for his big budget adventures, Guillermin also had a reputation of being a difficult man to work with. In his memoirs, film editor Ralph E Winters, described an incident he witnessed when he worked with Guillermin on King Kong."
