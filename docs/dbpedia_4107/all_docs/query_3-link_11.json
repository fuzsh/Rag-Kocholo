The exterior, with a matte added on by the sfx people at FOX was the Tower you saw in the film. A model was also constructed at the studio for additional shots and the two melded together for the final film. Anyhow, we had been working for about 10 hours at the front entrance of the building (I was cast as a SFPD officer) and had gone into the lobby just before we wrapped that morning at 5 am (we had started the shoot at 7pm the previous evening). All the extras were exhausted. I looked up and Paul Newman was opening up a portable bar he had and was preparing some drinks for some of his fellow actor friends. He looked up and saw me watching- and without a second thought, asked if “you want to join us?” I declined- didn’t think my agent would approve, but was always impressed that he would want to have included me in his circle.\n\nWORKING WITH A LEGEND by Tony Piazza\n\nI was watching a young Fred Astaire in “Top Hat” on TCM last night and thought back to the summer I worked with him during the “autumn” of his life in 1973. It was during the shoot of Irwin Allen’s “Towering Inferno” at San Francisco’s Hyatt Regency Hotel that I first met and worked with this real Hollywood legend. Of course you would not have thought so to see him. He wasn’t surrounded by a large entourage of staff or masses of fawning autograph seeking fans… just a small, but fit, elderly man, extremely modest in personality and pretty much of a reserved character. While crowds were recognizing McQueen and Newman, Mr. Astaire could pretty much blend into the crowd without attracting too much attention. It was kind of sad, but again, I had a feeling that he preferred it that way. He had more than his share of attention during Hollywood’s golden era and now he seemed extremely satisfied just being a private person, doing his job, and moving on with life.\n\nI watched him at a polite distance, as he waited for his cue to step onto the escalator that would carry him up into the massive hotel lobby which doubled as the atrium of the film’s tower. As he waited, he was just perceptibly tapping his feet, keeping time to the music coming over the hotel’s Muzak system. I can’t recall the tune, but it was a classic that could have easily been introduced in one of his musicals. He seemed content, moving his feet, mentally creating some dance routine that would have been the rave of earlier movie audiences, but alas was replaced by exploding buildings and machine gun fire.\n\nI was working on two films at that time- it was a busy San Francisco when it came to movie productions that year. I spent the morning to late afternoon on “The Streets of San Francisco” television show and then went over to the “Towering Inferno” location from evening to the next morning. I literally worked around the clock. My family was also heavily involved. My Mother was one of the couple that comes up ahead of Mr. Astaire in the escalator scene. If you view it, look for the woman with the blue pant suit and her hair worn up, standing next to a male “extra” that is supposed to be her companion. It is always great to see her young and smiling again each time I view the film- she passed on about nine years ago.\n\nMy Mother was from Mr. Astaire’s era, perhaps just a little later, and was very impressed by his approachability and humbleness. This was demonstrated when my father visited the set. My Dad was assigned to “The Streets of San Francisco” as location liaison, but came to visit her on the “Towering Inferno” after he had completed his days’ work. Mr. Astaire was standing close by when my father came up to greet her, and without a thought my mother introduced the two. She said, “Mr. Astaire this is my husband” whereupon he very graciously shook hands and they exchange some polite conversation. I have known some smaller actors (who are legends in their own minds) whereas that could never happen- but Mr.Astaire, always the gentleman, responded politely even though he had not really known them from Adam. That scores some big points, coming from a fan’s perspective!\n\nMr. Astaire certainly lived up to all he portrayed on the silver screen- as evidenced by this experience, and made him all the more enjoyable while watching him last night glide across the dance floor with Ginger in his arms. That certainly was a class act, performed by a truly classy individual!\n\nWorking with Irwin Allen\n\nRegarding “Towering Inferno” I have a number of other stories to tell. I was fortunate enough to also get some stand-in work with the second unit under the direction of IRWIN ALLEN himself. I’d always enjoyed the imaginative features and television shows that he had been associated with, and so it was a thrill to actually work with the man.\n\nAWARDS AND NOMINATIONS\n\nAcademy Award Oscars Won 1975\n\nBest Cinematography - Fred J.
