        "text": "As the bland, star-laden drama gets swallowed by fiery special-effects setpieces, it feels like one type of big-budget mediocrity giving way to the next.-The A-V Club\n\nMovies like The Towering Inferno appear to have been less directed than physically constructed. This one is overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.-NY Times\n\n[Quote]Saw this with the family when I was ten at a local drive in movie screen, loved it. Also a big fan of 70s disaster films, Irwin Allen, etc. My mother loved both Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, she was over the moon, and constantly commented on how good they both looked for their \"age\" at the time (1974). An all star studded cast, and a blazing inferno, that's what I call entertainment.\n\nand you mother could feel safe that none of the big stars would die in the disaster\n\nMy brother and I went to this movie several times as kids. Our city had a couple old theaters with balconies that included opera seats on the side that were built in the late 1800s. Both were converted to movie theaters in around the 1940s or 50s. At the one showing The Towering Inferno, the balcony area was closed off, but we knew the usher because he was also our paper boy. He let us watch the movie from up there every time we went to see it.\n\nWe were very young, so we thought the special effects were awesome for the time. I remember we'd run around the balcony and go to the snack bar for that first 40 minutes or so until the action picked up. Watching it back as an adult, Faye Dunaway was stunning in this. I remember even as a kid thinking Newman and McQueen didn't look like they cared for each other. Their mutual dislike bled through the screen.\n\nWe used to make fun of the scene where Jennifer Jones was knocked out of the elevator because her body banked off another part of the building on her death drop. We'd play it out with Fisher Price family figures using something to be the building. We also hated Richard Chamberlain's character, who was a smarmy asshole and major coward. He and some others gain control of a breeches buoy strung between the Towering Inferno building and another building, which had been working to ferry people across, but it's destroyed in an explosion after he and some others hijack it and fall to their deaths. The theater cheered when Chamberlain dropped. He played that character so well everyone hated him.\n\nAh, the memories!\n\nI eagerly awaited for this movie before it came out and was massively disappointed after I saw it. This movies drags on and on until the fire starts. Newman and McQueen have no memorable scenes or characters to speak of. There are a couple of really good death scenes, Susan Flannery and Jennifer Jones, but that's it, everything else is movie mush. I even forget how the others died because their deaths are just not as spectacular as those two. OK, so maybe Robert Wagner but not really because you can tell it's a stuntman in a fire resistant suit. Faye looks tremendous but all I remember is her ushering people in and out of the elevators. She was at the height of her stardom and just two years later we'd watch her roll around under the sheets with her Inferno co-star William Holden in Network but here all she's asked to do is look fetching and by God she does.\n\nPauline Kael on Inferno:\n\n> The plot in characters are retreads from the producer Irwin Allen's earlier Poseiden Adventure.\n\n> What was left out this time was the hokey fun.\n\n>When a picture has any kind of entertainment in it viewers don't care much about credibility, but it when it isn't entertaining, we do\n\n>And when a turkey bores us and insults our intelligence for close to three hours it shouldn't preen itself on its own morality.\n\n> it asks us to accept Richard Chamberlain as a rat-fink electrical contractor and as the city's leading roue.\n\n> best surprisingly is Faye Dunaway as Newman's girl.\n\n> her porcelain world weary face becomes wounded by the fear of falling apart and she's more beautiful than ever.\n\n> Perfection going slightly to seed is is the most alluring face a screen goddess can have.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit I LOVED this movie. Richard Chamberlain was a hoot as the Snidely Whiplash villain, kicking people off that makeshift rescue chair. Wasn't the fat socialite Irwin Allen's wife? My favorite tense moment didn't involve any of the big stars, but that unknown actor playing the poor fireman trying to rescue people off the broken elevator. Like all minor characters, I was sure he was toast, but he survived! (Cute, too!)\n\nAll the hoopla was about who would get top billing. I know they found a creative solution, with McQueen getting first billing, but Newman getting higher billing. Still , if you waited for the rolling ending credits, it's Steve who gets first credit (which amazed me, since most people think of Newman as the bigger star).\n\nWas this the only Oscar nomination Fred Astaire ever received? It was obviously an appreciation nod, but he was heartbreaking in the final scenes looking for Jennifer Jones.\n\nThe entirety of the short version of Pauline Kael's hilarious review of \"The Towering Inferno\":\n\n[quote][bold]The Towering Inferno[/italic] (1974) -- Disaster blockbuster with each scene of someone horribly in flames presented as a feast for the audience's delectation. The picture practically stops for us to say, \"Yummy, that's a good one!\" These incendiary deaths and the falls from high up in the 138-floor tallest skyscraper in the world are the film's only feats. Paul Newman and Steve McQueen mutter heroic sentiments, and Faye Dunaway manages to look goddessy-beautiful through it all, wandering through the chaos in puce see-through chiffon. John Guillermin directed and Irwin Allen produced. Stirling Silliphant wrote the series of bloopers that make up the script, which is base don two books--Richard Martin Stern's [italic]The Tower[/italic] and Thomas M. Scortia's [italic] The Glass Inferno[/italic] --that were sold to Hollywood studios,The plots were so similar that the two studios--20th Century-Fox and Warners--got together and jointly financed this one expensive (and highly profitable) movie. The picture asks us to believe that the tallest building in the world--a golden glass tower that's a miracle of flimsiness, as it turns out--would have been set down in San Francisco, of all places. With William Holden, Susan Blakely, Robert Vaughn, Jennifer Jones, Fred Astaire, Robert Wagner, O. J. Simpson (he gets to rescue a pussycat), and Richard Chamberlain as a rat-fink electrical contractor--can you imagine him negotiating with the electricians' local? Cinematography by Fred Koenekamp. (160 minutes.) color.\n\nAll that backdraft blowing glass and furniture and adulterous secretaries into the air...and then no debris at the foot of the building whatsoever.\n\nFlames at every window - and no column of smoke obscuring everything (and smothering those trapped in the rooftop ballroom).\n\nSomehow two women in evening dress running towards a helicopter will make it crash.\n\nIt is possible for a human body to fall twenty stories, hit a skyscraper ledge and bounce lightly off, completely intact.\n\nThe best place for a 130 story skyscraper is San Francisco. Also, it is implied that they tore down the Palace Hotel for this thing.\n\nAlthough there's not a staircase intact or an elevator working, the survivors are at ground level that same night.\n\nMore and more firetrucks arrive and are promptly parked in an alternate dimension, so that the streets remain clear.\n\nAn entire floor is in flames before two people in an office on that floor smell smoke or notice any other thing out of the ordinary.\n\nRichard Chamberlain is a straight contractor who beats up other men.\n\nShelia Allen looks her best in an Empire tiered hairstyle and pink chiffon.\n\nOther than that, this was completely believable.\n\nI was 7 years old when we went as a family to see this in the cinema. I remember my father went ahead to the Showcase Cinema to get the tickets for the 6 of us on a Saturday afternoon. I thought Jennifer Jones actually died in the film and was very sad and disturbed by it.\n\nLater that evening, I was so disturbed I couldn’t watch Randolph Mantooth in Emergency!\n\nIt’s odd because I’d seen The Poseidon Adventure and didn’t think any of those people died. I think it was the way she fell and then doesn’t she hit another rooftop on the way down? I guess it really made me think about death.\n\nVoyage of the Damned was more in the vein of Ship of Fools. There was no physical/phenomenonal disaster in it, just disastrous consequences for its passengers interned in concentration camps.\n\nI was 11 when I saw The Towering Inferno on a huge screen in its first run at an old Century Theatre multiplex built for Cinerama spectacles. Earthquake was playing in Sensurround at the theater next door. The sound was so loud that it shook the chairs in both theaters. My friends and I snuck in to Earthquake afterward. The chairs rumbled and our ears rang by the time Ava Gardner was swept away in the sewer.\n\n[quote]R154 I wonder why Ross turned down those movies… she did Voyage of the Damned around this time and inexplicably won a Golden Globe for it (She has almost nothing to do in it).\n\nThis is an interesting blog entry by some gay guy. He likes Ross’ performance.\n\n————————\n\n[italic] [bold]A few favourite things[/bold] ...... both scenes featuring Katharine Ross, who won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress before Oscar decided against her altogether, really sing. Practically a whole movie has passed by the time she shows up but she's worth the wait. Her first scene is a stereotypical hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold introduction but she plays it beautifully, leaning away from trope-mandated goodness and more into genuine confusion and improvisation... she's trying to figure out how to act in this confounding scenario she did not see coming even if you can still tell that her heart is gold. She's even better in her second (and only other) scene where we learn she is secretly Jewish and that her parents are onboard the ship that can't dock. It's the most exquisitely acted scene in the entire film with all three actors (ever reliable Yentl papa Nehemiah Persoff plays her father) delivering a gut-wrenching estranged-family mini-movie against the ticking clock of three absolutely inadequate minutes.\n\nThe opening sequence is one of my favorite of all time! Because the editing is THE WORST THAT HAS EVER EXISTED!!! Seriously, look at this, look with a hard eye. The helicopter is flying to San Francisco from somewhere north along the coast, and...\n\nThe helicopter is flying from north to south along the coast. The helicopter flies out to sea, then it's inland... going from south to north! Then it flies back out to sea, then it approaches the Golden Gate Bridge from the north, then is approaches the Golden Gate Bridge from the west! If you have any idea what kind of landscape they're supposed to be flying over, it's nonsensical.\n\nThis is one of those rare films that need to be remade... and set in some place like Dubai, not San Francisco! Some capitalist playground of the rich, where the goal of the authorities is to be rich and to impress other rich people, and where people who aren't rich are considered worthless and expendable, where there are no building codes or safety regulations, where the construction is done by slave laborers who'd be happy to see the building and everyone in it burn. That's where the next skyscraper-fire disaster is going to happen.\n\nThe only problem with that extremely realistic setup is finding a few sympathetic characters to be the stars of the film! Nice, admirable, and likeable people don't go to Dubai.\n\nYou can't really remake movies like this anymore, because there are hardly any big genuine \"stars\" left anymore that would attract people to it. Dunaway, Holden, Newman and Astaire were iconic figures at that point.\n\nRyan Gosling and Tessa Thompson are not instantly recognizable to a vast majority of the public, much less iconic stars.\n\nPlus the shitty CGI would overwhelm everything like it does in 90% of these movies and ruin the experience.\n\nLook at the difference between the original and remake of Murder on the Orient Express and (especially) Death on the Nile if you need examples.\n\nI love disaster movies and have seen The Towering Inferno many times.\n\n( Note Paul Newman's son Scott Newman as the young fireman who is afraid to rappel down the elevator shaft from the roof of the elevator after the power is cut off. Fire Chief Steve McQueen listens and replies, \"OK, then you better go first so that if you fall, you won't take any of the rest of us with you.\")\n\nSo, since we are talking of disaster movies, here is my list. Some are not very good, but nevertheless, from my collection...\n\n2012\n\nAbandon Ship (1957)\n\nArmageddon\n\nBeyond the Poseidon Adventure\n\nThe Cassandra Crossing\n\nContagion\n\nDante's Peak\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow\n\nDaylight\n\nDeep Impact\n\nFire! (Irwin Allen) (TV Movie 1977)\n\nFlood! (Irwin Allen) (TV Movie 1976)\n\nThe Hindenburg\n\nJuggernaut\n\nThe Last Voyage\n\nA Night To Remember (1958) (about Titanic)\n\nOutbreak\n\nPoseidon\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure (Irwin Allen)\n\nTitanic (1953)\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nThe Towering Inferno (Irwin Allen)\n\nTwister\n\nWhen Time Ran Out\n\nAny disaster movies about air travel is a separate category.\n\nIt seems I must be the first to put in a good word for \"Volcano\" (1997)! And my good word is genuine and heartfelt, it's a very entertaining movie and a bit campy! How can you bitches fail to appreciate seeing all those LA landmarks torched or blown up? Or seeing Anne Hehe trying to be taken seriously in a ridiculous film? Or seeing Tommy Lee Jones struggle to keep a straight face?\n\nFYI I first saw it in a theater with a horsewoman, who leaned over and whispered \"That 'volcanic ash' is a kind of horse bedding made out of shredded newspapers!\". How can a movie where the La Brea Tar Pits turns into a volcano that spews horse bedding NOT be considered a camp classic?\n\nR232, thank you for your comment regarding \"The Hindenburg\".\n\nMy airline disaster list is really just movies involving airplanes. But I refused to include the mocking movie \"Airplane!\" since it mocks the actual airplane movies.\n\nI have, though, actually seen 1957's \"Zero Hour\" which the makers of \"Airplane!\" used as the basis of their film. Starring Dana Andrews and Linda Darnell. ... \"Did you have the chicken or the fish?\" being the big question. I seem to remember the folks making \"Airplane!\" bought up the rights to \"Zero Hour\", but I could be wrong.\n\nSo, being on the topic anyway, here is my list of Airplane movies that I own. Not at all a complete list of all disaster movies about airplanes, but only those copies I own. I welcome any others as suggestions.\n\nAirport (4 movie box set)\n\nBack from Eternity (1956) Same story as \"Five Came Back\", both directed by John Farrell.\n\nCon Air\n\nThe Crowded Sky\n\nFate Is the Hunter\n\nFive Came Back (1939) Same Story as \"Back From Eternity\", both directed by John Farrell. Lucille Ball in a serious role.\n\nThe High and the Mighty\n\nIsland in the Sky\n\nJulie\n\nNo Highway in the Sky\n\nPandora's Clock (TV mini-series)\n\nSnakes on a Plane\n\nSully\n\nUnited 93\n\nI'm going out on a limb to say that I don't get the love for Maureen Stapleton in Airport. I don't think she did anything all that great, she certainly didn't deserve an Oscar nomination, and it wasn't anything we haven't seen any no-name actress do when playing a distraught fishwife.\n\nNow, of course, she acted circles around Helen Hayes, but that's a different story. I think both of them should have been punted for Diana Sands in The Landlord.\n\n[Quote]The Blu-Ray extras show a missing scene with Robert Wagner in his office having a meeting on details of the big party. The scene fits right before the scene where RW brings the big scissors into William Holden's office.\n\n[Quote]Supposedly there was a larger story about the Robert Vaughn character too that was cut.\n\nThey should have kept cutting until they had a 1hr45m film. The backstories are completely uninteresting and what do they matter ultimately?\n\nIt was a career nomination, R277. Astaire did frothy musicals that were never going to get performance nominations because his acting in them wasn't really doing any heavy lifting. If they were on the stage, he'd have won close to a dozen Tony Awards (had Tony Awards been around back then) because of his dancing. But he was a film legend and this was a way to honor him. He really was the front runner for that reason, but DeNiro (who didn't really deserve the Oscar that year, either) won. (John Cazale was way better in the same film and wasn't even nominated, yet Michael V. Gazzo, who was shit, was.)\n\nActually, the stars in this movie do what movie stars do - add some star quality to a really shitty script!\n\nOf course their ROLES are uninteresting, but that left them with nothing to do but look spectacular, strike poses, and get their camera angles just right. They're fun to watch, particularly since they aren't taking it too seriously. Okay, Dunaway is, she can't help but take things too seriously because that's just how she is, but this is as close to a light performance as she ever gave.\n\nThe original TTI scene for getting one of the kids down the blown out staircase, was supposed to have Jennifer Jones putting the little girl on her shoulders and climbing down the twisted metal stair rail debris.\n\nThat would have been quite a scene.\n\nBut not a good look for Newman.\n\nI wonder who pushed to change who carried the little girl down?\n\nI find it really interesting that the studios (especially Universal having two of the three) released Airport 75, Earthquake and Towering Inferno within 8 weeks of each other. A75 was first in mid-October, Earthquake came 4 weeks later and TI was another 4 weeks later.\n\nAnd all three were big hits. And this was back in the days when films stayed in theaters for months on end because there were no 3000 screen releases. The few films released on 1000+ screens prior to the Jaws phenomenon (which this was) were the ones they knew were dogs but were hoping to cash in on before word of mouth spread. I would have thought these three would directly compete with each other and erode each other's box office, but for some reason, that didn't happen.\n\nI can (vaguely) remember my parents dragging me to all three. I was six. I barely remember Airport 75, I remember Earthquake more because of the expectation of Sensurround that my parents talked about before going, and I remember TI most. We saw it about 4 months after it was released on a Sunday afternoon. When we got home, I had to take a bath before going to bed. For some reason, the film had scared me enough that I was afraid to be in the tub (who knows what I thought was going to happen) and I switched to showers soon after.\n\nI have very clear memories of when they were released, r320. I was working at the Aladdin and we were getting Earthquake. The Aladdin was built in 1926 (first theatre west of the Mississippi to be built specifically for sound pictures). They had to inspect the building to make sure it could withstand the Sensurround speakers (I think there were eight of them). We doormen wore black tuxedo jacket, powder blue tuxedo shirt with a ruffle & French cuffs and a big ol' black velvet bow tie. Our manager, Mrs. Hallett, had started as a concessionaire and worked her way up to be one of only two female theatre managers in Denver at the time. She was something. She decided the doormen and concessionaires would wear Red Cross Disaster Services jumpsuits and plastic hardhats. The Red Cross obliged and that's what we wore for the Earthquake run.\n\nI much preferred the blue jeans and Tommy t-shirts we got to wear when it opened after Earthquake's run.\n\nI was intrigued that this big budget movie was directed by an English/Frenchman who seemed to come out of nowhere.\n\nHis first real movie was an American-style police thriller which also climaxed on a tower.\n\nIt starred a brazen-looking actress that our New York DL eldergays will remember as winning the 1961 Tony Award for 'Irma La Douce'.\n\nIt also starred an English eldergay named Alec McCowen who at that time was always playing young neurotics.\n\n[quote]Another closeted movie star, by all accounts…\n\nJust whose accounts would those be, r362?\n\n[quote]On March 28, 1960, Franciscus married Kathleen \"Kitty\" Wellman, the daughter of film director William A. Wellman. They had four children — Jamie, Kellie, Korie, and Jolie.\n\n[quote]After the couple's divorce, he married Carla Ankney in 1980.\n\n[quote]They were still married at the time of Franciscus's 1991 death from emphysema in North Hollywood, California, at 57.[5]\n\nMany have noted in this thread about how underwritten and one dimensional the star's characters are in TTI, and it's true, though it was not originally supposed to be that way. Originally the female lead (Dunaway) had a much larger more psychologically complex back story and was supposed to be slightly older, in her early 40s. Indeed, in pre-production the part was slated for Lucille Ball who was very excited about finally working with McQueen and Newman and having an extensive love scene with the latter. However, delays in the shooting of Mame and advice from those in her inner circle, ultimately forced her to withdraw from the project. Once Dunaway was on-board, for a number of reasons, including the powers that be's fear that Faye wouldn't have the acting chops to pull off the character as written for Lucy, the script was altered and the female lead became much more one dimensional.\n\nTold this story here before. At CHILLER I met Leslie Nielsen and I handed him \"The Poseidon Adventure\" DVD cover and said, \"This is all your fault, you were busy flirting with the blonde\" and he burst out laughing and said \"OH NO! I take no responsibility for this!\". Then I met Richard Chamberlain and I gave him \"The Towering Inferno\" cover and said 'This is all your fault! and he laughed and said \"Yes! I guess it is!\"\n\nI have \"The Poseidon Adventure\" signed by Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Eric Shea and Leslie Nielson, and \"The Towering Inferno\" by Chamberlain and Mike Lookinlad. Thanks CHILLER!"
