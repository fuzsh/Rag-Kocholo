        "text": "In my opinion, despite the fact that there are two separate entries for the films in the IMDB, TORMENTA (“Storm,” in Spanish) and THUNDERSTORM are the same film. They basically share all major production credits. Another clue is that someone has entered “Franco Vich Production Inc.” into the IMDB as one of the Spanish-sounding companies that produced TORMENTA. In clearing up the confusion, it helps to know that Hemisphere Films Ltd., which produced THUNDERSTORM, was a company operated by Mike Frankovich, the husband of THUNDERSTORM’s producer Binnie Barnes.\n\nThe film was shot on location in the village of Mundaka (Bizkaia), Spain from late April to late July 1955. Given Mexican-born Christian’s popularity with Spanish-speaking audiences, I suspect that both an English-language and a Spanish language version were produced, with Guillermin and Alfonso Acebal alternating the direction. Both Guillermin and Acebal are credited on the Spanish poster below (the only feature film for which Acebal is credited as director). But the American prints, which were released by Allied Artists in 1956, credit only Guillermin. Note also that the Spanish poster properly spells “Frankovich.” Allied Artists had a pre-production involvement in the picture's making.\n\nThe story concentrates on Linda Christian’s character of “Maria,” a woman who is rescued from the sea near a small fishing village. She is a tall, blonde, fair skinned and slim woman who ends up the center of attention for all the men of the town. Her presence threatens the town’s way of life, as she becomes much of a distraction. A British DVD of the film was just issued this past May.\n\nFrom April through June 1973, several major studios engaged in a bidding war for the yet-to-be released, high-rise disaster novel, “The Tower,” by Richard Martin Stern. Soon after Warner Bros. outbid producer Irwin Allen and Twentieth Century-Fox, Allen purchased a similarly themed, but not yet published novel, “The Glass Inferno,” by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. In August 1973, a Daily Variety article revealed that in a historic first, Fox and WB would join together to finance and release a film to be titled THE TOWERING INFERNO, which would be adapted from both novels. The collaboration came about because of the unique events that led to both studios having the rights to similarly themed novels and the increasingly high cost of action-effects films. Fox had paid $400,000 for “The Glass Inferno,” and WB paid $300,000 for “The Tower.” The cost for the production was set at $11,000,000.\n\nProducer Allen, who had produced Twentieth Century-Fox’s 1972 successful box office disaster picture, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, wanted to direct the new film. But Fox was not comfortable with putting the entire production in his hands. It was decided that Allen would direct the action sequences for the film, and John Guillermin would be hired to direct the actors for non-action sequences. With the second units, there were generally a total of four film units shooting at the same time.\n\nIn the original script, the role of the fire chief (known at the time as “Mario Infantino”) was considerably smaller. According to Guillermin, the role was offered to Ernest Borgnine with Steve McQueen playing the architect. McQueen offered to play the fire chief if someone of his star-power would play the architect. So Paul Newman was brought into the project as the architect. Both McQueen and Newman were salaried at one million dollars each for their respective roles, as well as a percentage of the gross. McQueen demanded the script be augmented so that he and Newman had the same number of lines. Both actors insisted on personally doing as many of their own stunts as possible, resulting in Newman receiving a moderate burn and McQueen sustaining a sprained ankle that resulted in several days of shooting him in a seated position.\n\nThe 1974 film grossed $55,000,000 at the North American box office. John Williams score was released by Film Score Monthly.\n\nThe screen rights to remake RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.’s KING KONG (1933) were contested between producer Dino De Laurentiis and Universal Pictures. Universal sought the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, Sensurround, which debuted with the 1974 release EARTHQUAKE, and the studio had begun negotiating remake rights with RKO General, the successor to RKO Radio Pictures. Around the same time, however, De Laurentiis signed a $200,000 deal with RKO General and announced his production in May 1975. Universal responded by filing a $25 million lawsuit against De Laurentiis and RKO General, but by early November 1975, a trial date had not yet been set, and the De Laurentiis production was moving ahead with a reported $10-$12 million budget, a first draft of the script completed by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., and casting scheduled to begin December 1975. Universal, which was in also in preproduction on the remake at the time with Hunt Stromberg, Jr., as producer and Joe Sargent directing, made a second attempt to defend its legal rights to King Kong with a federal district court lawsuit that argued the story’s “basic ingredients” were public domain. Universal sought to differentiate Edgar Wallace’s original serial and Delos W. Lovelace’s novelization from the 1933 KING KONG screenplay. On 19 November 1975, RKO General filed a $5 million counter-claim against Universal for copyright infringement. By that time, Universal had titled its production “The Legend of King Kong” and had established a 5 January 1976 start date for principal photography, confident that the film was exempt from RKO copyright because it was based on the Lovelace novel, not the RKO motion picture. However, RKO General sought an injunction against Universal’s production, fearing that a second King Kong release would violate its deal with De Laurentiis.\n\nMeanwhile, De Laurentiis had negotiated domestic distribution rights with Paramount Pictures, and John Guillermin had been hired to direct, though there was no set start date for principal photography. December 1975 brought an additional lawsuit, this time filed by De Laurentiis against Universal with charges of copyright infringement and “unfair competition.” The complaint sought an injunction against Universal “from interfering with the De Laurentiis production,” and $90 million in damages. In January 1976, De Laurentiis and Universal ended their litigations, agreeing that De Laurentiis’ Paramount release would open eighteen months earlier than Universal’s version. It was later revealed that De Laurentiis had agreed to give Universal’s parent company, MCA, Inc., a “significant participation in the gross receipts” of his production.\n\nUniversal maintained its original legal battle against RKO General, but in March 1976 it was announced that Los Angeles Superior Court Justice Harry Hupp threw the case out of court, ruling that Universal held no legal claims to the picture. Although Daily Variety opined that a Universal remake of King Kong would never materialize, the studio released Peter Jackson’s KING KONG two decades later in 2005.\n\nKING KONG was filmed over eight months in locations including Los Angeles, New York City, and Hawaii. Principal photography was initially scheduled to begin 15 April 1976, but due to competition from Universal, De Laurentiis pushed the production start date forward four months, to begin on 5 January 1976, even though the sets were not yet constructed and the forty-foot mechanical “King Kong” had not been fabricated. By the time of Universal’s settlement with RKO on 5 March 1976, the production was already well into filming and headed to Hawaii. De Laurenttis estimated that the contest with Universal cost the production up to $4 million.\n\nThe character of King Kong was portrayed by an uncredited costumed actor, Rick Baker, as well as the forty-foot robotic gorilla. The completed 6.5-ton model was structured by an aluminum skeleton that contained 3,100 feet of hydraulic hose and 4,500 feet of electrical wiring. Its chest measured twenty feet in width, with an arm span of the same distance. The machine could walk, turn at its waist, and move its arms in sixteen unique positions with the operation of hydraulic valves that were controlled by six men. The hands alone were six feet across and the arms weighed 1,650 pounds each. The arms were constructed separately from the rest of the Kong model, then suspended from a crane, so actress Jessica Lange could be lifted thirty to forty feet. Safety features were installed in Kong’s fingers so they were not able to close around Lange entirely. Michael Dino, a famous wigmaker and the hair designer for Kong, created the gorilla’s fur with 4,000 pounds of horse tails, imported from Argentina. One hundred assistants weaved the horsehair into four types of netting, and the work took months. The hair panels were then attached to pieces of latex that were, in turn, glued onto the model’s metal frame. The mechanical Kong cost $2 million.\n\nBecause the film’s mechanical “Kong” weighed over six tons, it was too large to be hoisted on the top of the World Trade Center. Therefore, a forty-foot non-mechanical, styrofoam model was used as a replacement. The World Trade Center sequence was filmed twice, for a total cost of nearly $250,000, and the throng of approximately 45,000 background personnel marked the largest crowd scene in motion picture history to date. The U.S. Department of Labor initiated an investigation into the ethics of using so many unpaid extras. The outcome of the case remains undetermined. Principal photography concluded on 31 August 1976, four days behind schedule, with a budget that increased from $6.7 to $23.7 million in eight months. The film took in $37 million in rentals in the U.S. alone.\n\nDEATH ON THE NILE was the second Agatha Christie movie in the series of films from producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin. The picture was originally titled “Murder on the Nile” so as to connect with the first Agatha Christie movie in the series, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974). Some of the film's poster artwork was even designed to evoke the earlier movie. DEATH ON THE NILE was the first of three produced screenplays from novels by Agatha Christie written by Anthony Shaffer. The others were EVIL UNDER THE SUN (1982) and APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH (1988).\n\nThe location shoot in Egypt went for seven weeks of which four were spent aboard the paddle steamer “Memnon” (in the movie named “Karnak”) and three filming in places such as Luxor, Cairo, Aswan and Abu Simbel. The “Memnon” was one of the few paddle steamers remaining on the Nile. Visitors were barred from the set by director John Guillermin so as to preserve the secrecy of the whodunit plot. Under orders from the producers, Guillermin and the cast and crew were barred from seeing the dailies. The rushes were sent directly to the production office in London.\n\nFilming had to be stopped every day at noon for around two hours because temperatures reached around the 130 degrees Fahrenheit mark at that time. To accommodate this, make-up calls were scheduled for 4 am with filming starting at 6 am. On this, veteran actress Bette Davis once quipped: \"In the older days, they'd have built the Nile for you. Nowadays, films have become travelogues and actors stunt men\".\n\nThe film grossed $14.5 million in the U.S. Nino Rota’s score was last released on CD by DRG in 2006."
