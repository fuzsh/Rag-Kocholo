        "text": "The film director John Guillermin, who has died aged 89, started on cheap British B films in the 1950s and progressed to such big-budget spectaculars as The Towering Inferno, the second King Kong and Death on the Nile in the 1970s. He learned to work with tight resources during his eight-year apprenticeship in the lower echelons of British cinema, and proved equally responsible when given the chance to handle large forces.\n\nWhether they cost a shoestring or megabucks, most of his 35 films were made in a thoroughly workmanlike, Saturday-night-at-the-movies manner. Only in his later work was there sometimes a disparity between scale and quality.\n\nBorn in London of French parents, Guillermin studied at Cambridge University before joining the RAF at 19. When demobbed three years later, he went to France to work on documentaries. At 24, he made a modest start by co-directing (with Robert Jordan Hill) a comedy with the cockney character actor Ben Wrigley called High Jinks in Society (1949).\n\nHe then went on to direct further double-feature programme fillers that passed the time pleasantly enough for British audiences waiting to see the latest Hollywood movie. One of them, Miss Robin Hood (1952), made it to the US, where the New York Times enjoyed Margaret Rutherford’s “droll gyrations” but thought “John Guillermin’s direction is frantic and wild, so that the picture becomes a crazy clutter of purely mad clowning and flighty farce.”\n\nGuillermin’s first film in the premier league was Town on Trial (1957), a riveting thriller in which a police inspector (John Mills) investigates the murder of a “blonde good-time girl”. In a small part was Maureen Connell, whom Guillermin married soon after the film was completed. Mills also appeared in Guillermin’s I Was Monty’s Double (1958), an enjoyable fictionalised version of the hoax that diverted the attention of the Nazis from the Normandy invasion. With a cast that also included the British film stalwarts Cecil Parker, Michael Hordern, Marius Goring and Leslie Phillips, it could hardly put a foot wrong.\n\nThough Tarzan’s Greatest Adventure (1959) hardly lived up to its title, it was a notch above many of the latter adventures of the ape-man. (Three years later, Guillermin directed Tarzan Goes to India.) Shot on location in Africa, the film and its eponymous hero (Gordon Scott) were much tougher and more realistic than their predecessors. In one scene, Tarzan shoots a man at point-blank range with an arrow, and the villains, led by Anthony Quayle, are pretty vicious.\n\nNever Let Go (1960) also had a pretty vicious villain, played surprisingly and effectively by Peter Sellers in his first straight role, as a London gangster. Sellers returned to semi-comic vein in the bittersweet Waltz of the Toreadors (1962), based on a Jean Anouilh play.\n\nBut Guillermin’s strength lay in action movies, his best being set among the military. Guns at Batasi (1964) benefited from a forceful performance by Richard Attenborough as a martinet regimental sergeant major in an African state bowing to the “wind of change”. “I have seen Calcutta. I have eaten camel dung. My knees are brown, my navel is central, my conscience is clear, and my will is with my solicitors, Short and Curly,” Attenborough declaims.\n\nThe Blue Max (1966), a first world war drama from the German perspective, contained spectacular aerial sequences and a steely depiction of the camaraderie of men under stress. There was plenty of explosive action in The Bridge at Remagen (1969), which revolved around the last bridge standing over the Rhine in 1945, fought over by German and American forces. The film gave as much time to both sides (of the bridge and the war), showing GIs and Germans suffering under fire. Much of it was shot in Czechoslovakia, but it had to be completed in Italy when real-life Soviet troops moved in.\n\nAfter making a minor contribution to disaster movies of the 1970s with Skyjacked (1972), Guillermin (with the producer Irwin Allen) made The Towering Inferno (1974), arguably the best of the sub-genre. It proved that, if paid enough, few big stars would refuse to play second fiddle to special effects and bravura directing. Yet, unlike in other disaster movies, the characters are well-defined and well-played. The cast was headed by Paul Newman and Steve McQueen battling the flames to rescue a host of famous faces from a burning 138-storey hotel. At the end McQueen says, “We were lucky today. The body count was only 200. One of these days 10,000 people are going to die in one of these firetraps.”\n\nGuillermin followed his triumph with what many considered a disaster movie in a different sense. The 1976 remake of King Kong was shot down by critics for featuring a man in a monkey suit, and being heavy, over-budgeted (by the producer, Dino de Laurentiis, at $24m), and containing lines such as “Put me down, you goddamn chauvinist pig ape!” – delivered by Jessica Lange in her debut film. Yet it was financially successful and both Lange and Guillermin survived the brickbats.\n\nAnthony Shaffer’s adaptation of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile (1978) was sumptuously set in 1930s Egypt with Peter Ustinov as a witty Hercule Poirot questioning an all-star cast of suspects. Smoothly handled by Guillermin, it was also his last success.\n\nAfter being replaced by Andrew McLaglen on Sahara (1983), Guillermin, reverting to the world of his Tarzan movies, made Sheena, also billed as Sheena, Queen of the Jungle (1984), nicely shot on location in Kenya, and based on a comic strip, a medium where it should have remained. Then, instead of leaving well alone, Guillermin made King Kong Lives (1986), an awful and pointless sequel, with vast sums thrown at it by De Laurentiis again, in which we discover that the giant ape did not die when he fell off the World Trade Center 10 years earlier. Guillermin had enough sense to leave the picture and it was completed by an uncredited 21-year-old documentary film-maker, Charles McCracken. Guillermin’s last film was The Tracker (1988), a competent made-for-TV western starring Kris Kristofferson.\n\nDespite a few duds towards the end of his career, nobody could argue with the comment Guillermin once made: “You know, there’s really nothing like an exciting film on a big screen. Hopefully, I’ve made a few in my career.”\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Mary, and a daughter, Michelle, by his first marriage. A son predeceased him."
