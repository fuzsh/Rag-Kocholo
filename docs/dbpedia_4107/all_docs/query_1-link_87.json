        "text": "The 1990s were a time of relative prosperity, but at the movies nothing could go right. The Cold War was over, the threat of nuclear annihilation appeared to be off the table, and yet now asteroids were headed right towards Earth while a dormant volcano erupted beneath Los Angeles. The decade experienced a resurgence of the disaster movie, which had been a formidable blockbuster presence in the ’70s, only to give way to new stars and higher concepts in the ’80s. When the disaster movie returned in the ’90s, it wasn’t the star-studded event films of studios trying to feel their way through New Hollywood; they were VFX-driven pieces of the blockbuster landscape that were now deemed so valuable that different studios would pursue the same world-shaking event in competing movies.\n\nHowever, after the smoke had cleared in the new century, better CGI didn’t lead to better disaster movies. Instead, the visual effects developments in the 2000s swallowed up the delicate balance between character and disaster. Spectacle now ruled all, and audiences lost the human charm against the backdrop of calamity.\n\nOf course, large-scale devastation does not automatically qualify a movie for the disaster genre, but dedicated Letterboxd members have specific criteria for what falls in or outside the category. Meghan tells me that natural disasters obviously qualify, but also disasters within a particular place, such as The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure. Brandon Williams goes a step further, noting that as long as the disaster is the narrative’s driving force, then the movie qualifies—so you not only have natural disasters, but also movies like Godzilla or the alien attack of Without Warning.\n\nBut why do we even find disasters riveting entertainment in the first place? We’re certainly not taking joy from human suffering against the elements, and while some movie disasters are beyond human experience (although if you or a loved one has suffered from an asteroid impact, please let us know), we’re well aware of the devastation caused by tornadoes and earthquakes. “There’s something incredible about the disaster genre’s ability to tap into primal emotions by using the most extreme danger scenarios possible,” Theironcupcake explains. “These films ask us to consider what we would do in such situations: how would we act if trapped on a sinking cruise ship? What about attempting to outrun lava from a volcano? What about controlling a runaway train so that it does the least damage to the surrounding population? These stories go straight for the gut, the brain and the heart rate, all at once.”\n\nThe disaster movie roared back in the ’90s, and fans of the genre see this era as the best time for on-screen catastrophe. Williams goes so far as to say that if you’re looking to get into disaster movies, the ’90s are the best place to start since you not only had variety in the genre but also an easy basis for comparisons as you had similar movies competing in the same year, like Volcano and Dante’s Peak in 1997 and Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998. Meghan and Ironcupcake agree with Williams that things peaked for disaster pictures here, closely followed in preference order by the ’70s. “When I remember how my childhood as a New Yorker was impacted by the sheer terror on display in the Sylvester Stallone classic Daylight,” says Ironcupcake, “choosing that decade feels like the right call.”\n\nThe masters of disaster we spoke to also agreed that of the best decade for cataclysmic catastrophe, it’s Jan de Bont’s Twister from 1996 that’s the cream of the crop. “As someone who has logged Twister 45 times since joining Letterboxd in 2018, I would have to pick it as the best disaster movie I’ve seen,” says Meghan. “I just feel like it has held up really well throughout the years. It has a great cast, an interesting plot, a good soundtrack and excellent special effects.” If you’re a disaster flick neophyte, our experts are aligned in suggesting Twister is a great entry point for the genre. Ironcupcake explains that while containing a great story and delightful humor, there’s nothing too gruesome in the carnage, so you get the full benefit of the mayhem without something like Pierce Brosnan’s bone breaking through his skin in Dante’s Peak.\n\nWhy has Twister endured past some of its ’90s peers? Speaking with director Jan de Bont for the release of the film’s new 4K Blu-ray, he says the relatability of the premise is a key element. “I think because the story is very identifiable. The storm chasers really exist, and the way they are portrayed and filmed looks authentic, looks real,” explains de Bont. “We also have this desire to be like them. What would it be like in one of those chase cars, going so close to a tornado and possibly endangering your life?”\n\nFor all their bombast, Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno and Earthquake are plausible scenarios one could imagine themselves in, and Twister continued in that tradition. However, other ’90s disaster movies hinted at the oncoming larger-than-life premises for the genre—like in Armageddon where a team of oil drillers trains to become astronauts so that they can put a nuclear warhead inside an oncoming asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Still, the ’90s heyday of the genre found a way to dance on the edge of this ridiculousness either by emphasizing real-world stakes, like the rural volcano eruption destroying a small town in Dante’s Peak or capitalizing on the emotional beats, which Deep Impact does beautifully.\n\nBut both the world and Hollywood changed moving into the 21st century. In 1996, aliens zapping tall buildings in Independence Day was cause for exhilaration. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the large-scale devastation of an iconic landmark such as the World Trade Center, there was less room for earthbound giddy thrills unless they started going so wildly afield that there was no longer anything “natural” about natural disasters. Trying an inverse-Armageddon/Deep Impact with The Core, a group of scientists and NASA pilots go into the Earth to detonate a nuclear device and “restart” the Earth’s core. Disaster movie mainstay Roland Emmerich’s The Day After Tomorrow wants to reckon with the onslaught of climate change but has to cram it all into a very bad weekend where characters outrun CGI wolves and weather that instantly freezes people to death.\n\nAs de Bont explains, one of the reasons Twister works so well is that his cast (led by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, with a cinephile’s dream of a supporting squad including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Todd Field and Alan Ruck) felt they were really contending with the elements, and it forced them to react to what they were experiencing rather than try to imagine how it would turn out in post. “The physicality of having all the stuff coming at you—you change. Everyone would change if that happened to you!” de Bont tells me. “The power of those jet engines—it blows you away. So you really have to fight that to stay upright and get to the goal you want to achieve… It’s real because it was real.”\n\nWhile the 2000s and 2010s have been rough eras for the disaster movie with the occasional bright spots, the genre is roaring back thanks to Twisters, a sequel to the 1996 movie directed by Oscar-nominated Minari filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung. Fans who have seen the movie seem to be sparking to the film’s vibe. Emma declares that “Twisters is a film that lives up to the legacy of the original. Like the first, behind all the thrilling, intense action is a story with heart and emotion.” Ashleigh keeps it simple, writing just “YEE-HAWWWW 🌪️🌪️🌪️🌪️” .\n\nSo what makes Twister and Twisters stand apart from their disaster movie peers? For director Lee Isaac Chung, it’s applying that Amblin magic and making it more of an adventure movie. “I love Amblin movies and it’s just been a dream of mine to make a movie that’s an Amblin movie,” he explains to me. “On a meta level, I was working with that in mind that this is an Amblin movie. Tonally, I wanted to try to go back to that type of film in which there’s a lot of heart, there’s a lot of warmth. At the same time, there’s fun action—action that really puts a smile on your face.”\n\nOf course, Twisters comes into a different world than its predecessor. In the ’90s, there was the comfort that any weather event would pass, but with climate change proliferating and exacerbating natural disasters, how do you make that fun in the present day?\n\n“I wanted the film to have sober moments where we really look at destruction and we try to recreate it in a very realistic way,” Chung details. “We also look at those moments with a bit of silence and reverence. As a team, we constantly talked about how we might respect people who have actually lived through storms that have destroyed their property. And it was honestly happening to people who were working on the film. Some of the people on our film—one of the people in transportation, for instance—his house, his roof was destroyed during a tornado while we were filming. So it was just generally happening and we just knew we needed to respect it.”\n\nChung’s film shows that when it comes to contemporary disaster pictures, there is a way forward, and that Twisters could be the start of a revival for the genre. It may be the first of the big-screen sequels to the ’90s disaster movies, but if it’s a hit with audiences, it’s unlikely to be the last. When asked if there’s another follow-up they’d love to see, our members were brimming with ideas. “I’d love to see Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton reunite for a Dante’s Peak sequel,” says Williams. “We can assume Harry Dalton would continue to work for the USGS. Possibly overseeing activities, taking Paul’s job into his late career. If he’s still working, maybe Rachel has been traveling around with him.”\n\n“I think it would be interesting to see a sequel to Volcano,” Meghan ponders. “I would like to know how Los Angeles adapted to having a volcano in the city and how they would deal with another eruption.”\n\nPart of the thrill of a disaster movie is its unpredictability, but as Glen Powell’s Tyler Owens shows in Twisters, there is a way to wrangle a tornado. What Twisters demonstrates is that it’s not a matter of using the latest in CGI or having the biggest VFX budget (although the film’s effects are impressive), but leading with characters. Just as we cared about the ragtag team of storm chasers in Jan de Bont’s movie, Chung’s follow-up gets us on board with this new batch of daring meteorologists. Twisters manages the powerful combination of compelling protagonists without getting lost in a CGI haze while still respecting our current climate crisis. If other films can replicate this balance, then audiences should brace themselves for the coming storm."
