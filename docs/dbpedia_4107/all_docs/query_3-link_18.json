        "text": "John Guillermin, a prolific British director best known for blockbusters like the 1974 disaster movie “The Towering Inferno” and the 1976 remake of “King Kong,” died on Sunday at his home in Topanga, Calif. He was 89.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, his wife, Mary Guillermin, said.\n\nIn addition to big-budget extravaganzas, Mr. Guillermin (the name is French, but he pronounced it GILL-er-min) directed a raft of films in various genres from the end of the 1940s until he retired from filmmaking in the 1980s.\n\nRegardless of whether he was directing a light comedy, war epic or crime drama, Mr. Guillermin had a reputation as an intense, temperamental perfectionist, notorious for screaming at cast and crew alike. His domineering manner often alienated producers and actors.\n\nDavid L. Wolper, producer of the mini-series “Roots,” nearly fired Mr. Guillermin from “The Bridge at Remagen” (1969) after he upbraided the crew and told Mr. Wolper not to appear on set during a complicated scene.\n\n“At that time I had worked with few feature-film directors, so to say Guillermin was the most difficult director with whom I’d ever worked wouldn’t mean much,” Mr. Wolper wrote in his memoir, “Producer” (2003). “So, It is probably better to say he was a real pain.”\n\nBut Mr. Guillermin’s impeccable eye and ability to capture both intimate moments and large-scale action scenes usually overcame that reputation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
