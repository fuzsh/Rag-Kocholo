I really question whether it became a sensation purely as a result of hype.\n\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nRather than being a reflection of the true terror of a fire, this is a romp of a disaster movie, with some big, fun set pieces, heroes to root for, and villains to boo.\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nThe use of real stunts and real fires lend to a staggering visual design with stellar cinematography to match.\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\nIt starts with flare-ups and explosions, and it ends up in ashes. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFebruary 20, 2020\n\nAn absolutely spectacular cast, and a top-notch technical team, are the pillars on which 'The Towering Inferno' is based, a film built with the precision of an architect. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nSeptember 4, 2019\n\nDespite the best efforts of most of those involved, the film never takes off as more than just a remarkable collection of glossy violence.\n\nJune 25, 2017"
