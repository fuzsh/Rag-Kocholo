        "text": "Sellers had an unexpected impact on Guillermin’s next movie, Guns at Batasi (1964), an adventure-drama set in the last days of British rule of an unnamed African country. Sellers’ then-wife Britt Ekland was meant to play the ingenue, but her husband objected, so she pulled out of the film; Mia Farrow took over instead, launching that actor’s career.\n\nThe story concerns a British military outpost caught up in a coup. Richard Attenborough gives a career-highlight performance as the martinet RSM in charge, who is initially depicted as a figure of fun, obsessed with regulations and the army, but when the pressure is on, is the only one who really seems to know what to do. A subject like this is a political minefield, with its hot topic subjects of imperialism, militarism, race, emerging democracies, etc. It works best as a siege story, on which basis it is very exciting. The cast includes Australia’s own John Meillon as a sergeant (called “Aussie”), singer Joe Leyton and a just-before-his-throat-operation-that-ripped-out-his-cancerous-vocal-chords Jack Hawkins.\n\nThe film was released by 20th Century Fox, whose head of production Darryl F. Zanuck admired Guillermin’s work and hired the director to make Rapture (1965). This little-remembered picture was shot in France (Zanuck was a Francophile) and starred Patricia Gozzi (who had become famous in Sundays and Cybele), Dean Stockwell and Melvyn Douglas. It’s an odd film and head scratching why Fox made it. I know Zanuck was on a French kick but still… Maybe he liked the idea of Patricia Gozzi having a crush on runaway crook Dean Stockwell. I think Gozzi was 14 when she made this and she gets into bed with Stockwell for the third act, which is awkward. Guillermin’s directing is atmospheric; the film didn’t work for me but has its fans, including Guillermin himself (according to his widow this was his own favourite of his movies.)\n\nThat film was barely seen, but Guillermin’s next movie, also for Fox, was a huge success: The Blue Max (1966). This was a World War One aerial epic, shot in Ireland, starring George Peppard, Ursula Andress and James Mason. It feels like a sports movie at heart told from the point of view of a “team” of German pilots – cocky kid George Peppard wants to be the champ, and doesn’t care about anything else really. The film is on Peppard’s shoulders and he carries it – he was ideal in these big movies, as he proved in The Carpetbaggers (1964), especially if he played a bastard. The running time is dragged out rather mercilessly (James Mason doesn’t appear until 40 minutes in and there’s too little of him); it would have made a fantastic 90 minute movie. The scenes between Andress and Peppard are electric.\n\nThe prickly Peppard enjoyed working with Guillermin and the two men made their next two films together, both for Universal: the detective story PJ (1968) and thriller House of Cards (1968). PJ, Guillermin’s first film shot in the US, seems to have been made with one eye on being a new Harper (1966) – only it doesn’t have Ross MacDonald, William Goldman, an all star cast or Paul Newman. It does have Raymond Burr in while hair who is great fun, as is Brock Peters as a Bermudan cop and Gayle Hunnicut as the girl. George Peppard is an ideal private eye but the film seems unsure how tough or comic to make his character – one minute he’s a clown, the next a smart arse, the next a tough guy, the next someone who gets beaten up by patrons of a leather bar. The movie doesn’t feel like a Guillermin work – such was the smothering blandness of films made at Universal in the late ‘60s and ‘70s.\n\nGuillermin returned to war with The Bridge at Remagen (1969), a World War Two story shot in Czechoslovakia until the Soviets invaded, after which it had to be completed in Germany and Italy. It’s tough and fast and looks great. I loved the opening scene with tanks hurtling down the road (you rarely see them going fast in a film – because it’s not historically true admittedly but it looks awesome) – and Robert Vaughan has a brilliant death sequence. Ben Gazzara and George Segal are excellent as soldiers.\n\nGuillermin went to Spain to make a Western for National General, El Condor (1970), starring Lee Van Cleef and Jim Brown. The film was written by Larry Cohen, who later said Guillermin had a fistfight with producer Andre de Toth during filming. Ah, the good old days…\n\nMGM offered Guillermin the job of directing Skyjacked (1972), a thriller with Charlton Heston. This is a solid piece of classical entertainment which is one of the best movies made at MGM under the regime of James Aubrey. It is hard, after Flying High (1980), to take the disaster film tropes seriously but it’s all good drama: the passengers include a heavily pregnant woman, a stewardess who used to date Heston, a black singer, a nubile young starlet. I loved the third act of the plane arriving in Russia and Charlton Heston was born to play a pilot.\n\nGuillermin stayed at MGM to make Shaft in Africa (1973), the third in the Shaft series and an attempt to reinvent the character as a sort of James Bond figure. It has location filming in Ethiopia which looks amazing, but the picture was a box office disappointment.\n\nGuillermin then received an offer from producer Irwin Allen to direct The Towering Inferno (1974), an all-star disaster movie. For me, this is one of the most purely entertaining films of the 1970s. It has so much going for it: an exciting storyline, a skilled script by Sterling Silliphant that juggles a lot of balls in the air, confident handling from Guillermin, decent stunts and effects, and a genuinely starry cast: some B-listers, sure (Robert Vaughan, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, Robert Wagner), and camp casting (OJ Simpson) but two genuine former A-listers (Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones), one on the slide (Bill Holden) and three at the top of their game (Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway). It’s just brilliant fun and the film made a deserved pile of money. Vincent Canby of the New York Times said, snottily, “John Guillermin directed the film, but it’s difficult to know exactly what he might have done aside from suggesting a few line readings. Movies like The Towering Inferno appear to have been less directed than physically constructed.”\n\nThis sort of ignorance was awe-inspiring from a reviewer in a major paper: films like The Towering Inferno are extremely difficult to execute well. As if to prove it, Irwin Allen’s three subsequent movies, all made without Guillermin, were dire flops: The Swarm (1978), Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) and, When Time Ran Out (1980).\n\nGuillermin’s next movie was for another high-profile producer, in this case Dino de Laurentiis on King Kong (1976). Few movies of the 1970s were more publicised or critically divisive. I think it’s a fabulous film, a genuinely fresh interpretation of a classic. The sense of adventure is high; Charles Grodin is fun as the oil exec; Jessica Lange is beautiful and Jeff Bridges is handsome; John Barry’s score is lush; the animal suit antics are fine; the ending is moving (Guillermin never lets the spectacle overwhelm the love story). I missed dinosaur island but at least there is a killer boa. I think people will remember this fondly a lot longer than Peter Jackson’s version which seems to have vanished in collective memory.\n\nIn 1976, Guillermin said his fee for directing was one million dollars plus 10% of the profits. “I’ve outlived most of my contemporaries who are either destitute or gone on to other things,” he said. “I may have been anonymous but I’ve been working with quiet satisfaction and I’ve made a lot of money.”\n\nGuillermin did a third blockbuster in a row, Death on the Nile (1978) for EMI Films, shot in Egypt. This is delightfully civilised entertainment – it’s got a strong story (thanks to Agatha Christie); a cast of familiar faces; some broad comedy courtesy of Bette Davis and Maggie Smith’s hilarious double act (I wish they’d be given their own vehicle) and Angela Lansbury; sex appeal via Lois Chiles and some very low cut gowns; location shooting in Egypt; David Niven as his exposition man; Mia Farrow being a crazy nutter very convincingly. The unravelling of the murderer is very satisfactory, and the dialogue is witty.\n\nAfter an extremely strong 1970s, including three big hits, one would have assumed Guillermin would have had his choice of projects by the end of the decade. And his name was linked with some choice assignments: an adaptation of James Clavell’s Tai Pan, and a proposed Godfather III. But Guillermin’s next movie was Mr. Patman (1980), a psychological thriller/character study shot in Canada. This was part of that country’s tax-break-driven film boom which consisted of projects featuring ageing stars that couldn’t find finance in Hollywood. It’s a really terrible movie, dull and lacking in atmosphere, the first bad picture Guillermin made in over a decade.\n\nI get that all careers have their ups and downs, but to go from three massive films to a Canadian tax shelter movie indicates that perhaps something else was going on. Guillermin had a notoriously bad temper; most anecdotes about him involve him yelling at someone, cast, crew and/or producers. People will put up with this sort of behaviour to a point; Guillermin clearly had talent, and his methods brought results. But if he went around yelling at people all the time then it’s not unreasonable, I feel, to surmise that possibly filmmakers who might otherwise have hired him would shy away. Or maybe he just had bad luck.\n\nNot that he was unemployed. He was hired to direct Sheena (1984), a $25 million adaptation of the comic book, starring Tanya Roberts. The film was a flop and critically mauled. Personally (and I know I’m in a minority here) I think it’s terrific. It looks gorgeous, was beautifully shot on location, has a wonderful score, the script flies along, and Guillermin’s direction is excellent. Tanya Roberts’ method-like intensity takes some getting used to but once you tune in, she’s great fun and has the body of an athlete; Ted Wass is an engaging hero, handsome and a bit klutzy, but an ideal partner (as in King Kong, Guillermin never loses sight of the central love story). I’m aware it’s problematic with its white saviour heroes; I will argue in the film’s defence, at least it’s in present day Africa and there are a lot of positive black characters, it’s just most of them are killed.\n\nGuillermin’s last feature was King Kong Lives (1986), a film I would love to say is a hidden gem, but it is awful. There’s no sense of adventure or danger: the bulk of the film takes place in the USA, and the rampage of Kong is played for laughs (being whacked on the head by a golf ball, etc). The leads, Linda Hamilton and Brian Kerwin, could have been cut out of the film entirely. Who wants to see a King Kong movie where the apes are in love with each other and not a human? The characters lack decent motivation and differentiation. The music score is nice and John Ashton chews scenery with aplomb. But it’s bad, bad, bad..\n\nGuillermin’s last film was the cable TV Western The Tracker (1988), starring Kris Kristofferson. This was a polite late ‘80s western, a variation on The Searchers (1956) with some baddies kidnapping women and Kristofferson leading a posse, and his son learning the importance of killing people. The dust feels clean. Look, it’s fine.\n\nThere were no more movies – it’s hard for directors to find work after they turn sixty and Guillermin’s last three cinematic features were big flops. He was a long time retired, dying in 2015.\n\nUnlike many directors, he seemed unconcerned with propagating his reputation through interviews and memoirs. He was married twice and had two children; a son predeceased him. A rare interview is here. His widow has recently completed a book about her husband’s life and films.\n\nGuillermin doesn’t sound like a particularly pleasant person to work for – according to some accounts he was a flat-out bully. But revisiting his filmography for this article was a pure enjoy. At their best, his movies are energetic, beautiful and compulsively entertaining. He wasn’t known as an actor’s director, but career-high performances were given in his films by John Mills, Peter Sellers, Richard Attenborough, and Richard Todd; his strike rate with women wasn’t as high, but Tanya Roberts was never better than in Sheena.\n\nOlaf Miller wrote a 2014 profile on Guillermin for Film Comment which said: Guillermin is something of a melancholic: in his coolly unflinching cinema, tired, traumatized men in desperate situations fight with dour determination for a few shreds of dignity. There’s nothing conventionally uplifting about his films; his tales of violence, grimy glory, and defeat conceded with stoicism, don’t make for easy viewing experiences. At their finest, Guillermin’s films are howls from the soul’s darker recesses – theirs is a savage heart.\n\nAnd they’re fun to watch, too!"
