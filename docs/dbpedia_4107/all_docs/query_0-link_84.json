Robinson (novel)\n\nSteve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway (starring)\n\nBeverly Hills, CA: Twentieth Century-Fox, 1974. Two vintage double weight color studio still photographs and two vintage studio still photographs from the 1974 film. Two black and white photographs with provenance stamps on the verso.\n\nBased on the novels \"The Tower\" (1973) by Richard Martin Stern, and \"The Glass Inferno\" (1974) by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. In 1973 both Twentieth Century-Fox and Warner Brothers had each purchased rights to similar skyscraper disaster novels, when \"Master of Disaster\" producer, Irwin Allen, on the heels success with his 1972 disaster film, \"The Poseiden Adventure,\" convinced both studios to join forces in the production of a motion picture, the first in the history of the major studios. The result was one of the highest grossing films of 1975 and one of the largest ensemble casts yet assembled, including Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, O.J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, and Robert Wagner, among many others.\n\nDuring the premiere gala for the world's tallest skyscraper, the building catches fire, the result of shoddy wiring by corrupt contractors, trapping 300 guests on the 135th floor. Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Cinematography, nominated for five others including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Fred Astair, his only Academy Award nomination.\n\nSet in San Francisco, shot on location in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\n8 x 10 inches. Generally Near Fine, with two color photographs evenly toned.\n\n[Book #158841]"
