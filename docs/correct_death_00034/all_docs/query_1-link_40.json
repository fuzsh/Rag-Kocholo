        "text": "At the ripe ‘ole age of 23, Ray Nelson II already refers to his co-workers as “cats” and his work schedule as “gigs.”\n\nThat's just part of the jazz parlance the Florida A&M University graduate has picked up as the drummer and newest member of the 81-year-old Count Basie Orchestra.\n\nPatrons attending last month’s inaugural Florida Jazz & Blues Festival at Casades Park will remember Nelson as the drummer who brought the crowd to its feet with a jaw-dropping solo during the orchestra’s performance of “WhirlyBirds.”\n\nNelson wasn’t able to attend last week’s homecoming activities. He was performing with the orchestra at New York’s Apollo Theater for the kick-off celebration honoring the 100th birthday of vocalist Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n“Being a member of the Marching 100 means so much to me,” Nelson said in an interview from Los Angeles, where he now lives. “Growing up around this incomparable band taught me so many things, music-related and life-related.\n\n“I always felt like if I could come up in the \"100\" that I could do anything,” he continued. “I learned so much about discipline and perfection, and pushing myself until you have no more to give; leaving it all on the field.”\n\nMusical legacy\n\nActually, the interest in drumming and his subsequent journey to FAMU began before he entered kindergarten. He comes from a family of FAMU graduates and musicians.\n\nHis father, Ray Nelson, attended FAMU and played trumpet and French horn in the Marching 100 under its founder, William P. Foster. His mother, Terrion Nelson, attended FAMU, sang in the campus choir and was elected Miss FAMU in 1987. His grandfather, Edward Nelson, played drums for the Marching 100 and later worked as a jazz drummer.\n\n“The moment they saw me playing on hymn books and Bibles at church and always going near the drums, they knew that music and drums were my gift,\" said Nelson, whose friends also call by his nickname, “Quasi.”\n\nHe recalls being 3 or 4 years old when he got his \"First Act\" drum set, a four-piece ensemble with a “Geoffrey the giraffe” chair.\n\n“My first real instructions came from my \"Papa,” he said, referring to his grandfather. “The moment when he realized how serious I was taking it at such a young age, he pulled down his vintage 1965 Rodgers drum kit and begin giving me lessons on rudiments and basic fundamentals before I could even touch the drum set.\n\n“My goal at the time was to be great, that simple,” he added. “It was so many drummers that I looked up to in my hometown (West Palm Beach) … I wanted to be just like them; better even.”\n\nNelson spent a great deal of his childhood honing his skills and staying focused. He graduated from Alexander W. Dreyfoos High School for the Performing Arts in West Palm Beach and headed to FAMU.\n\nFAMU years\n\nHe credits Professor Shaylor James, assistant director of bands and director of percussion, as being a major influence.\n\n“A huge shout out to Dr. Shaylor James, my percussion instructor at FAMU,” Nelson said. “These lessons have truly translated over to my everyday life. It’s an honor to have served as a member of the Marching 100 and being a part of a legacy.”\n\nJames, who has taught at FAMU for 52 years, remembers being equally impressed with Nelson.\n\n“Since I've known him, he has displayed only the highest level of character, integrity and musicianship,” James said. “When I auditioned him as an entering freshman percussionist at FAMU, I was impressed with his unlimited talent and potential. During this period, he was a very talented and focused individual who continued to grow as a drummer, percussionist and consummate musician.”\n\nAt the same time, Nelson’s father, also was using his connections by reaching out to Scotty Barnhart, with whom he played in the Marching 100. Barnhart joined the Count Basie Orchestra in January 1993 but returned to graduate from FAMU in 1998. He was appointed band director in September 2013.\n\nWilliam “Count” Basie formed the Count Basie Orchestra in 1935 and served as director for nearly 50 years until his death in 1984 at 79. It has long been considered one the world’s most influential orchestras, attracting soloists from Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett to Billie Holiday and others.\n\nThe orchestra’s website describes it as “an American institution that personifies the grandeur and excellence of jazz.\" It has won every major jazz poll in the world at least once, won 18 Grammy Awards, performed for kings, queens and every major jazz festival and major concert hall in the world.\n\nThe recruit\n\nBasie was known to recruit only the best musicians. As director, Barnhart's role is to continue that tradition. He remembers the senior Nelson calling him, saying, “He can really play, he’s only 2.”\n\nThat was followed up with another call, “He’s 5, he can really play.”\n\nAnd then, “Better watch out, he’s 12, he can play.”\n\nBarnhart later received a DVD of the son performing.\n\n“I said, ‘OK!,\" Barnhart said, recalling how impressed he was with the student’s talent and natural ability.\n\nFinally, in 2010 when he was conducting the Florida All-State Orchestra, one of the young drummers caught his eye. It was Ray Nelson II.\n\nBarnhart shared some Count Basie and Duke Ellington's music, only to have Nelson blow him away after a few listens.\n\n“I said, “Oh, my God,’ “ Barnhart recalled.\n\nHe started following Nelson’s development at FAMU and continued to be impressed with his technique.\n\n“I said this cat has turned into a tremendous drummer,” Barnhart said. “If anything comes up, I will have to call him.”\n\nIn 2015, Nelson graduated from FAMU with an undergraduate degree in jazz studies with a minor in music industry. He returned to West Palm Beach and then decided to move to California. He had become enamored with California while participating in 2014 with the Disney All-American College Band at DisneyLand.\n\nBarnhart remained in touch with Nelson. He gave him two CDs that covered most of the orchestra’s set list. He also started mentioning Nelson’s name to another jazz great, Wynton Marsalis, who was eager to meet him.\n\nBut Barnhart had first dibs.\n\nLast October, he told Nelson to get ready. The Basie Orchestra was soon going to need a drummer . Nelson was invited to play two performances to fill in on drums.\n\nWhen the orchestra’s drummer left a short while afterward, Barnhart hired Nelson full-time last October.\n\n“When I got the official call (from Barnhart), I was driving down Interstate 5 at night,” Nelson said. “I hung up and called my parents, in tears, because I couldn't believe it. God truly keeps his word.”\n\nJames said the fact that Nelson was recruited to join the orchestra doesn't surprise him. He describes his former student as a person who wasn't just focused. He also understood the importance of being a serious musician.\n\n\"I am not surprised at Ray being successful in getting the job with the Count Basie Orchestra because he was never one to rely solely on talent,\" James said. \"He has always been a conscientious young man with high ideals and an outstanding capacity for carrying out assigned tasks. In my opinion, his current job with the Count Basie Orchestra is only the beginning of a fabulous career. Ray is a phenomenal drummer and individual. They sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nNelson's skills are impressive, especially given his age.\n\n\"The main thing we look for is ability,\" Barnhart said. \"We get the best people we can find.\"\n\nNelson remembers his “first official gig” was on January 23 at Symphony Hall in Chicago. The Count Basie Orchestra was sharing the stage with The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis.\n\n“Talk about pressure,” Nelson said of the performance.\n\nPerforming with such noted musicians in the orchestra is an honor, said Nelson.\n\n“I grew up on this music, so to actually play it for a living is sometimes surreal,” he said. “I also love the history lessons I get from all the cats in the band.\n\n“In middle school and high school I was heavily involved in the jazz band but I honestly never saw myself being a \"big band\" drummer … so for this to be my first mainstream gig goes to show that the best is yet to come. It really shows me how I also have to do my part in making sure that \"America’s music\" doesn't die.”\n\nBarnhart, an assistant professor of jazz studies at Florida State University, can’t say enough about the technique and natural ability Nelson brings as a drummer. He, along with Marsalis, marvel at Nelson’s skills.\n\n“I do consider Ray to be in the top 1 percent of drummers alive today, period.”"
