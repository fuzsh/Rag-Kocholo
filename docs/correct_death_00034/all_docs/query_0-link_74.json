        "text": "Today is Friday, April 26, the 117th day of 2024. There are 249 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine caused radioactive fallout to begin spewing into the atmosphere. (Dozens of people were killed in the immediate aftermath of the disaster while the long-term death toll from radiation poisoning is believed to number in the thousands.)\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1607, English colonists went ashore at present-day Cape Henry, Virginia, on an expedition to establish the first permanent English settlement in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn 1865, John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, was surrounded by federal troops near Port Royal, Virginia, and killed.\n\nIn 1913, Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old worker at a Georgia pencil factory, was strangled; Leo Frank, the factory superintendent, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. (Frank’s death sentence was commuted, but he was lynched by an anti-Semitic mob in 1915.)\n\nIn 1933, Nazi Germany’s infamous secret police, the Gestapo, was created.\n\nIn 1964, the African nations of Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania.\n\nIn 1968, the United States exploded beneath the Nevada desert a 1.3 megaton nuclear device called “Boxcar.”\n\nIn 1977, the legendary nightclub Studio 54 had its opening night in New York.\n\nIn 1984, bandleader Count Basie, 79, died in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nIn 1994, voting began in South Africa’s first all-race elections, resulting in victory for the African National Congress and the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president.\n\nIn 2000, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean signed the nation’s first bill allowing same-sex couples to form civil unions.\n\nIn 2009, the United States declared a public health emergency as more possible cases of swine flu surfaced from Canada to New Zealand; officials in Mexico City closed everything from concerts to sports matches to churches in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nIn 2012, former Liberian President Charles Taylor became the first head of state since World War II to be convicted by an international war crimes court as he was found guilty of arming Sierra Leone rebels in exchange for “blood diamonds” mined by slave laborers and smuggled across the border. (Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison.)\n\nIn 2013, singer George Jones, believed by many to be the greatest country crooner of all time, died in Nashville at age 81.\n\nIn 2018, comedian Bill Cosby was convicted of drugging and molesting Temple University employee Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004. (Cosby was later sentenced to three to 10 years in prison, but Pennsylvania’s highest court threw out the conviction and released him from prison in June 2021, ruling that the prosecutor in the case was bound by his predecessor’s agreement not to charge Cosby.)\n\nIn 2022, Russia pounded eastern and southern Ukraine as the U.S. promised to “keep moving heaven and earth” to get Kyiv the weapons it needed to repel the new offensive, despite Moscow’s warnings that such support could trigger a wider war.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Actor-comedian Carol Burnett is 91.
