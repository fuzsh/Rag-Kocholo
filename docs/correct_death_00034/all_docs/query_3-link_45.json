        "text": "William \"Count\" Basie (August 21, 1904 - April 26, 1983) was a jazz pianist, organist, and bandleader.\n\nBasie was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father, Harvey Lee Basie, worked as coachman for a wealthy family. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several area families. His mother, Lilly Ann Basie, 'took in laundry'. Basie learned how to play piano as a child.\n\nBasie toured the vaudeville circuit starting in 1924 as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers. In 1928 he joined Walter Page's Blue Devils, and the following year became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, Missouri. After Moten died in 1935, Basie became leader and started referring to himself as \"Count Basie\".\n\nAt the end of 1936 he moved his band to New York City where the Count Basie Orchestra remained until 1950. The big band era appeared to be at an end, but Basie reformed his as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952 and led it until his death. Basie remained faithful to the Kansas City jazz style and helped keep jazz alive with his distinctive piano playing. Basies music was characterized by his trademark jumping beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano.\n\nBasie also showcased some of the best blues singers of the era: Billie Holliday, Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, and Joe Williams\n\nCount Basie died in Hollywood, Florida April 26 1983 at age 79.\n\nOne O'Clock Jump and Jumpin' at the Woodside were among Count Basie's more popular numbers.\n\nSee also\n\nJazz royalty\n\nSamples\n\nDownload sample of \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\" by Count Basie & His Orchestra, a popular swing song by a jazz legend\n\nExternal links\n\nCount Basie at the Duke Jazz Archives (http://www-music.duke.edu/jazz_archive/artists/basie.count/03/bio.html)\n\nCount Basie at PageWise (http://de.essortment.com/biographywillia_rgyr.htm)da:Count Basie"
