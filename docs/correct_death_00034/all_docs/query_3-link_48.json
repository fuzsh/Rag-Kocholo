        "text": "Count Basie Orchestra returns to Red Bank\n\nJazz is coming home.\n\nThe Count Basie Theatre, the historic Red Bank venue named after swinging icon and Red Bank native William \"Count\" Basie, has plenty of jazz shows on its calendar in the near future.\n\nLeading the charge at the Monmouth Street theater is none other than the Count Basie Orchestra, the ensemble launched by the man himself back in 1935. The orchestra will celebrate its 80th anniversary year with a Sunday afternoon performance at the Count Basie Theatre, where it will be joined by the vocal stylings of New York Voices.\n\nOther can't-miss shows for jazz lovers at the Basie include chanteuse Diana Krall on March 2, Fourplay with Spyro Gyra on April 16, Norah Jones on June 20 and Chick Corea with Bela Fleck on Oct. 16.\n\nBasie, who was born on Mechanic Street in 1904, made his name in Kansas City and collaborated with American musical titans from Frank Sinatra to Billie Holiday to Clark Terry before his death in 1984 at the age of 79.\n\nThe Count Basie Orchestra is now under the direction of Scotty Barnhart, an Atlanta native who played trumpet with the orchestra for 20 years before being appointed director in September 2013. Barnhart, now based in Los Angeles and Tallahassee, Florida, is also a professor of jazz trumpet at Florida State University.\n\nIs there any extra pressure on Barnhart and the orchestra when they take the stage at Basie's namesake venue in his hometown?\n\n\"No added pressure other than what there is every time we play,\" Barnhart said. \"I just have to make sure we play the right thing and sound how we're supposed to sound. It's no different if we're playing in Red Bank or Carnegie Hall or the Blue Note in Tokyo. It's all the same for me, as far as making sure we're always 100 percent and living up to the legacy that Mr. Basie set.\"\n\nBarnhart, a fan of Basie's work since the age of 9 or 10, explained the key to the orchestra's continued artistic success.\n\n\"Everything that we do, I act as if (Basie) is on that stage every night,\" he said. \"To me, we take the stage every night and I think he's right there. I feel he's right there. We all feel that. That's why the orchestra still sounds the way it sounds. It's no accident.\n\n\"Basie was a heck of a band leader. I think he was the greatest band leader ever, when you really look at what this orchestra has been able to do. And still, if you close your eyes and listen to us play for two or three seconds, you know it's the Count Basie Orchestra. There's not even any doubt as to who we are. And, that's a testament to Basie. So, I just try to make sure I live up to everything that he left us, and I'm just working hard at it.\"\n\nA two-time Grammy winner thanks to his work with the Count Basie Orchestra over the years, Barnhart described what set Basie's musical output apart from that of his peers.\n\n\"Immediately, it made you want to get up and dance â€” it made you feel good,\" he explained. \"It was accessible. It wasn't too cerebral so you had to try to figure out what the horns were doing or what was going on. It immediately got straight to the point of making you want to get up and dance.\n\n\"So, even today, everything we play, you can dance to it. Even when some of the tempos are a little faster, when we start playing we've got the groove and the swing going on right away. We don't take a minute to get into it, we don't 10 seconds to warm up and get into the song. From beat one, we're right on.\"\n\nTHE COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA\n\nWITH: The New York Voices\n\nWHEN: 3 p.m. Sunday, March 1\n\nWHERE: The Count Basie Theatre, 99 Monmouth St., Red Bank\n\nTICKETS: $25 to $49.50"
