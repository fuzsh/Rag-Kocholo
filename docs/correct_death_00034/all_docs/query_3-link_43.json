        "text": "A longtime friend of jazz legend Count Basie is facing possible jail time for allegedly stealing $70,000 from the late bandleader’s disabled daughter.\n\nWhen William James “Count” Basie died of cancer in 1984, he left his $1.5 million fortune in a trust to provide for his only child.\n\nHis daughter, Diane Basie, now 71 and living in Florida with full-time caregivers, is “severely retarded and only marginally communicative,” according to court papers.\n\nBasie appointed Aaron Woodward, a Long Island Baptist pastor and accountant, to be Diane’s guardian.\n\nBut in 2012, Manhattan Surrogate’s Court Justice Kristin Booth Glen removed Woodward from his guardian role after he failed to account for money that belonged to Diane.\n\nNow Joy Rosenthal, a court-appointed lawyer who is Diane’s replacement guardian, wants to jail or fine Woodward, 68."
