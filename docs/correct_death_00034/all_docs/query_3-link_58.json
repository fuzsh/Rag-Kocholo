        "text": "Legendary jazz trumpeter and composer Clark Terry, who played alongside jazz greats such as Count Basie and Duke Ellington over a 70-plus year career, died on Saturday. He was 94.\n\nHis wife, Gwen, confirmed his death on his Facebook page saying her husband “joined the big band in heaven where he’ll be singing and playing with the angels.”\n\nTerry rose to international fame in the 1960s when he became the first African-American staff musician at NBC, where he spent 12 years as one of the featured horn players on the Tonight Show.\n\nAccording to his official online biography, the St. Louis-native is “one of the most recorded musicians in the history of jazz, with more than 900 recordings.”\n\nTerry also enjoyed a long career in jazz education, organizing jazz camps, youth bands and teaching in educational institutions.\n\n“Teaching jazz allows me play a part in making dreams come true for aspiring musicians,” he wrote on his website.\n\nTerry received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010."
