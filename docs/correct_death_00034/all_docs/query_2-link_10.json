        "text": "(1904–84). American jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader Count Basie was one of the outstanding organizers of big bands in jazz history. He transformed big-band jazz by the simplicity of his arrangements and secured his place in history with such classic numbers as “One O’Clock Jump” and “Basie Boogie.”\n\nWilliam Basie was born on August 21, 1904, in Red Bank, New Jersey. He studied music with his mother and was later influenced by the Harlem pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, receiving informal training on the organ from Waller. He began his professional career as an accompanist on the vaudeville circuit. Basie eventually settled in Kansas City, Missouri, and in 1935 assumed the leadership of a nine-piece band, composed of former members of the Walter Page and Bennie Moten orchestras. One night, while the band was broadcasting on a short-wave radio station in Kansas City, the announcer dubbed him “Count” Basie to compete with such other bandleaders as Duke Ellington. The jazz critic John Hammond heard the broadcasts in New York, New York, and promptly launched the band on its career in Chicago, Illinois. Although rooted in the riff style of the 1930s swing-era bands, the Basie band included soloists who reflected the styles of their own periods. In this way the band was a springboard for such artists as tenor saxophonist Lester Young, trumpeter Buck Clayton, and trumpeter-composer Thad Jones. Many musicians considered Basie’s to be the major big band in jazz history, a model for ensemble rhythmic conception and tonal balance.\n\nDuring the late 1930s the accompanying unit for the band (pianist Basie, rhythm guitarist Freddie Green, bassist Walter Page, and drummer Jo Jones) was unique in its lightness, precision, and relaxation, becoming the precursor for modern jazz accompanying styles. Basie’s syncopated and spare but exquisitely timed chording, commonly termed comping, became the model for what was expected from combo pianists in their improvised accompaniments for the next 30 years of jazz. Despite its influence on modern piano styles, Basie’s solo technique had roots in the pre-swing-era style of Fats Waller, and Basie continued to display such a “stride style” in performances through the 1970s.\n\nBasie’s autobiography, Good Morning Blues, written with Albert Murray, was published in 1985, one year after his death. Count Basie died on April 26, 1984, in Hollywood, Florida, leaving a grand legacy of song that would continue to influence jazz musicians for generations to come."
