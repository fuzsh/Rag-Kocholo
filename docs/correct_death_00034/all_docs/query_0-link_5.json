        "text": "Born:\n\n21st August 1904 in Red Bank, Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA.\n\nCount Basie’s grave in Farmingdale\n\nDied:\n\n26th April 1984 in Hollywood, Florida, USA.\n\nBuried:\n\nPinelawn Memorial Park, Farmingdale, Suffolk County, New York.\n\nMost famous single:\n\nOne O’Clock Jump. (See below for a video.)\n\nSome great albums:\n\nBasie Beginnings (1929–1932).\n\nAmerica’s #1 Band (1936–1952).\n\nThe Complete Decca Records (1937–1939).\n\nVerve Jazz Masters: Count Bassie (1954–1965).\n\nThe Complete Atomic Mr Basie (1957).\n\nFor the First Time (1974).\n\nSome interesting facts:\n\nHe was one of the greatest jazz artists of the swing era (1930s–early 1940s)! [Swing jazz uses big bands and has a strong beat. It is often very fast as well.]\n\nHis real first name was William (or Bill).\n\nHe was mostly a piano player, but sometimes played the organ.\n\nHis playing was much more relaxed than a lot of other swing piano players. He played fewer notes than many others.\n\nHis music during the swing era has a very strong rhythm section (drums and bass, or drums, bass and guitar).\n\nHis most famous single, ‘One O’Clock Jump’ was composed when his group were just messing around!\n\nHe formed the band ‘Count Basie Orchestra’ in the 1930s and led it for almost 50 years. This band is still going today!\n\nHe didn’t like school and didn’t get very far there either!\n\nIn the last years of his life he played the piano in a wheelchair.\n\nHere is a video of the Count Basie Orchestra playing One O’Clock Jump. Count Basie is the person playing the piano.\n\nThe Count Basie Orchestra playing ‘One O’Clock Jump’\n\nAnd here is a video of Count Basie and an orchestra playing Freckle Face.\n\nCount Basie playing ‘Freckle Face’\n\nPicture credits:\n\nCount Basie.
