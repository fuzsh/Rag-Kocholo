        "text": "Celebrate 100 years of William “Count” Basie with the Count Basie Orchestra and Nnenna Freelon at the Phillips Center, Tuesday, February 15\n\nRelive the big band era with The World Famous Count Basie Orchestra and multi-Grammy -nominated jazz vocalist Nnenna Freelon at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Tuesday, February 15, 2005 at 7:30 p.m. A pre-performance discussion, which is free and open to the public, will take place at 6:45 p.m.\n\nThe Count Basie Orchestra’s collaboration with Freelon celebrates Count Basie and his music –- the 100th anniversary of Basie’s birth was last summer –- including the best-known Basie repertoire, and paying homage to the beloved vocalists who have performed with the Orchestra, including Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. In addition to the scintillating Basie sounds, the performance includes new material designed and arranged for Freelon’s unique stylings, including the only tune that Vaughan ever wrote.\n\nBorn in 1904, William “Count” Basie began playing the keyboard in the Benny Moten Orchestra in the early 1930s; jazz experts maintain that Basie’s place at the keyboard signaled the beginning of the Moten band’s historical significance. After Moten’s sudden death in 1935, Basie took the reigns as bandleader and the name “The Count” when the group headlined at Kansas City’s Reno Club in 1936. The band’s gigs were broadcasted live on the radio, and Music Corporation of America and Decca signed it shortly afterwards.\n\nRadio airtime and records helped the band’s popularity grow, and The Count Basie Orchestra ushered in the 1940s attracting solo guests and large crowds across the nation. While the Korean War and economic lull eventually sent the demand for “big bands” into decline, the Orchestra played on, with European concert tours in the 1950s, and expanded European and Southeast Asian concert tours and regular television and Las Vegas appearances well into the 1960s.\n\nEven after Count Basie’s death in 1984, The Count Basie Orchestra’s impact on the jazz world remains strong. The band’s lightness and precision set the tone for modern jazz accompanying style with a piano style called “comping,” which refers to a syncopated and highly precise style of playing chords. The band also launched the careers of several musicians, including tenor saxophonist Lester Young, trumpeter Buck Clayton, trumpeter-composer Thad Jones, bassist Walter Page and drummer Jo Jones. Bill Hughes, who sat in the band’s trombone section for nearly 50 years, leads The Count Basie Orchestra today; with the help of drummer Butch Miles and his tight rhythm section, the band continues to win over a new generation of fans and garner awards and special recognitions. The Washington Post notes that in spite of changes in leadership since Basie’s death, “the band is still purring one moment and roaring the next in trademark fashion.”\n\nJazz vocalist Nnenna Freelon joins the Orchestra at the Phillips Center to celebrate 100 years of Count Basie. An accomplished singer, composer, producer and arranger, Freelon has a well-deserved reputation as a captivating live performer. In 2001, she received an enthusiastic standing ovation from 20,000 music industry insiders and celebrities when she took the stage at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. She has performed and toured with several jazz greats, including Ray Charles, Ellis Marsalis, Al Jarreau and Dianne Reeves. Her fifth release on Concord Records, Live (which was recorded live at the Kennedy Center in 2003), marks her decade-long recording career and 20 years on the road.\n\nSaturn of Gainesville sponsors this performance.\n\nTickets are: $30, front orchestra and mezzanine; $30, mid-orchestra; $25, rear orchestra; $20, balcony. Rush seating in the balcony may be available day of show for $10.\n\nTickets to University of Florida Performing Arts events are available by calling the Phillips Center Box Office at 352-392-ARTS (2787) or 1-800-905-ARTS (2787) or by faxing orders to 352-846-1562.
