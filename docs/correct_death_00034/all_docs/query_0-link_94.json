        "text": "Who reigns as America’s greatest jazz singer ever?\n\nBillie Holiday.\n\nAnd who had the saddest life story you could ever imagine?\n\nBillie Holiday.\n\nHoliday, known as Lady Day, is the subject of a truly original, unusual and unforgettable documentary, James Erskine’s ‘Billie’ — now in select theaters and available on TVOD (Amazon, iTunes, etc.). It begins as titles tell what happened to Linda Lipnack Kuehl, a freelance film writer who lived in Washington, D.C. For a decade she had been researching a comprehensive, definitive biography on Holiday. Kuehl never finished that book. We’re told she died, a suicide. Much later, we hear from her family, that ‘suicide’ is debatable. Why would anyone jump with their face mask on?! Why would a writer abandon her life’s work without leaving a note?!\n\n‘Billie’ covers the singer’s life, beginning as an only child born out of wedlock in April 1915 Philadelphia. She grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, with a doting mother and absent father. As we hear the actual interviews, with subtitles to insure we clearly understand what’s being said, a mosaic becomes a full portrait of a Lady Day we’ve never, ever come close to knowing. Here is the teenager turning tricks to get by. She is bisexual. She is very serious about her singing, her composing, her writing lyrics. She broke barriers in 1939 with the extraordinary protest song ‘Strange Fruit’ about the lynchings that had begun early in the century with the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and continued with impunity until after WWII. ‘Strange Fruit’ which she first sang at the integrated Café Society nightclub in Manhattan was a song that changed the cultural landscape.\n\n‘Billie’ lets us hear from musicians who were on the road with Billie who was, we are reminded, always angry about discrimination and segregation. The only woman on the band bus, the guys could go into the woods for relief which the lone woman on the bus, Holiday, could not. She routinely cussed, using expletives often and with great flair. We hear about affairs including one with the married Count Basie. There are horrible stories, one after another, about the men she married who beat and robbed her.\n\nShe loved to wear furs, jewels, slinky gowns. She was beautiful. She was an addict. She died with just $750 to her name. We see the Harlem crowds that mourned her open casket. We see the coffin leaving the church, placed in the hearse. We hear from the FBI agents who monitored her and never thought of arresting her because, ‘She was not trafficking in narcotics, only using.’ Until one of her husbands, an informer since 1934 the agent reveals, called to have the cops bust her so that she would get clean. She spent a year in jail, released in 1948.\n\n‘Linda,’ says her sister Myra Luftman, ‘was conscious of being a white writer and writing about Billie.’ But Linda, thru the late ‘60s into the ‘70s, asked the questions from those that were there in the ‘30s, ‘40s and ‘50s. It’s a completely different energy to hear a source giving information than to read their quotes on a page. It makes ‘Billie’ a living, breathing look at a life that wasn’t lived in service to her great gifts but was truly tumultuous.\n\nNEW DVDs:\n\nDOG EAT DOG You (still) need a strong stomach to watch Alejandro González Iñárritu’s masterful epic of Mexican life, the three-part ‘Amores Perros’ (Blu-ray, Criterion Collection, R). Iñárritu’s sensational 2000 debut – he would go on to win consecutive Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for ‘Birdman’ (2014) and ‘The Revenant’ (2015) — first created a sensation at Cannes. With its mix of violence, an eclectic soundtrack, expansive emotional landscape and intriguing cast of characters, ‘Perros’ single-handedly revived the stagnant Mexican film industry. Gael Garcia Bernal, then 18, made his starring feature film debut as a hot-headed brother who covets his gangster brother’s wife and makes money dogfighting. There is the glam model set up in a high rise flat by her married lover and the third section follows the elderly hitman who collects stray dogs. The graphic dog fights seem so real, so visceral that walkouts were inevitable I suppose. The Criterion restoration, supervised by Iñárritu and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, boasts a bookshelf of extras: An extensive new COVID-era virtual interview in English between Iñárritu and Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, a new conversation with the director and 3 of his leading actors, a new interview with the composer, two essays, a superb video essay examining the film’s multiple elements by scholar Paul Julian Smith.\n\nPlus a fascinating documentary behind the scenes by Iñárritu that reveals how they managed to make those canine killings so vivid without ever harming an animal. Here too Iñárritu documents what looks like continual chaos on various locations to get the film he envisions. An actor is hurt in a simple scene where he’s attacked; the doctor is called. Bernal argues with Iñárritu about how he can safely be beaten behind a shower curtain. The spectacular car crash that begins and ends ‘Perros’ is seen as a complicated, dangerous (‘We’re losing the light!’) sequence with stuntmen, blocked streets, unsettled speeding car carburetors. It seems truly, dangerously life-threatening – yet no one died! And always we see Iñárritu determined in his make-or-break moment, always demanding, pushing and imploring, and fully succeeding in creating a modern masterwork.\n\nSTORM CLOUDS OVER SOUTHERN FRANCE Two titans of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu and Benoît Magimel, become political rivals in the 2016-18 series ‘Marseille: The Complete Series’ (Blu-ray, 16 episodes, 4 discs, Kino Lorber, Not Rated). France’s picturesque port city on the Mediterranean is naturally an ideal spot for double-dealing, romantic complications and disturbing revelations. Magimel, 46, was the mayor’s protégé but now he’s bared his ambitions to topple, after 25 years, his old mentor Depardieu, 71. This was the first original French language series commissioned by Netflix. It ran for 2 seasons. In French with optional English subtitles.\n\nHAIL VERHOEVEN Reputations, like clothes, constantly change. And Dutch director Paul Verhoeven’s reputation is ascending. Always a popular filmmaker (‘Robo Cop,’ ‘Black Book,’ ‘Elle’ with Isabelle Huppert and ‘Starship Troopers’), Verhoeven’s ‘Total Recall’ (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray+ Digital Code, 3 discs, Lionsgate, R), now celebrating its 30th anniversary in a 4K upgrade, ranked as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s best.\n\nSet in 2084 and co-starring Sharon Stone (whom Verhoeven would transform into a superstar 2 years later with ‘Basic Instinct’), ‘Recall’ tussles with issues of identity, implanted memories and a trip to Mars. Special features: An F/X featurette, a Making of, a documentary on ‘Imagining Total Recall,’ On the Scoring and the company, Carolco, behind the picture. And an Audio Commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger.\n\nPRE-CODE GENDER QUESTIONING ‘The Kiss Before the Mirror’ (Blu-ray, Kino Lorber, Not Rated) merits interest mostly because it’s a 1933 James Whale picture and as a pre-Code picture before the Breen Office censored every Hollywood picture, it presents a possible emancipated lesbian character. ‘Kiss’ begins with a murder, a crime of passion where a husband shoots his cheating wife and her lover. His lawyer (Frank Morgan, the Wizard in ‘Wizard of Oz’) finds he is possessed by the idea of murdering his wife who is having an affair. Whale was Hollywood’s only ‘out & proud’ gay director, famous for ‘Frankenstein’ and ‘Show Boat.’ He was played by Ian McKellen (Best Actor nomination) in the 1988 biopic ‘Gods and Monsters.’ The audio commentary by Melbourne film historian Alexandra Heller-Nicholas is the essential here. She’s truly engaged and informative.\n\nSNIPES SNIPS As the half-man, half immortal Blade in Stephen Norrington’s accomplished anti-vampire thriller ‘Blade’ (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray+ Digital Code, Warner Bros., R), Wesley Snipes had a career-defining role. One that sparked 2 sequels. Stephen Dorff is Deacon Frost, the evil vampire Blade must slay to save the world. Blade and Dorff do go to town and suggest a rivalry as to which actor can chew the most scenery. Special features: Audio commentary by cast & crew, including Dorff and Snipes, plus the isolated Mark Isham score with commentary by the composer.\n\nBEST BUSTER ‘The Buster Keaton Collection Volume 4’ (Blu-ray, Cohen Media, Not Rated) spotlights 2 of the silent era’s supreme stone-faced clown. Both comedies have new 4K restorations and all-new music scores: ‘Go West’ (1925) has Keaton as director and star in and ‘College’ (1927). ‘West’ which Keaton co-wrote and produced as well, finds him failing spectacularly in Arizona, whether bronco busting, cattle wrangling or, pull those udders! dairy farming. The bonus: A 1923 Hal Roach short ‘Go West,’ new restoration trailers and a featurette, ‘Buster Keaton: Screenwriter.’\n\nOH REN, OH STIMPY The animated series with a psychotic Chihuahua named Ren and a dim-witted cat named Stimpy gets an analysis with ‘Happy Happy Joy Joy The Ren & Stimpy Story’ (DVD, Gravitas Ventures, Not Rated). Here are clips ‘recognizable to any fan’ and a history of the celebrated show that premiered on Nickelodeon in 1991 and ran until ’95. Its creator John Kricfalusi was fired from the show in 1992 . Years later, in 2018, two former employees of his production company accused him of grooming and sexually assaulting them in the late 1990s when they were teenagers. Kricfalusi apologized, citing mental health and ‘poor impulse control.’ He has reportedly since retired from the animation industry. This DVD, with interviews with Kricfalusi and his fellow creators, looks at the show and asks: What is the role of media creators? How do we reckon with what we see onscreen and who they actually are?\n\nEARLY ROCK ‘Rock Hudson Collection’ (Blu-ray, KL Studio Classics, Not Rated) is a box set of 3 of Hudson’s early films for Universal Pictures where he was under contract. It was Douglas Sirk who saw real talent in Hudson and made him a star in the 1954 ‘Magnificent Obsession’ opposite Oscar winner (and ex-Mrs. Ronald Reagan) Jane Wyman. Hudson shines in these early leads. The 1953 ‘Seminole’ is a well-regarded historical drama (director Budd Boetticher) about the destruction of the Florida Indian tribe’s homeland. Hudson followed that with the absurd ‘The Golden Blade,’ a Middle East fantasy of sorts with its Caucasian cast barely bothering to suggest supposedly ethnic roles.\n\nHere, adapting the Excalibur legend to somewhere in Syria, a magical gold sword endows its owner (Hudson!) with magical powers. Piper Laurie (‘Carrie’), another Universal contract player, is the independent, rebellious Princess. ‘Bengal Brigade’ (’54) cast Hudson as a British Captain in 1857 British-ruled India who resigns in disgrace. Only to seek redemption when his fellow servicemen are attacked and he can rush to their aid. Technicolor definitely boosts these films’ charms and Hudson is more than fine – he’s good.\n\nPREGNANT, PREGNANT Maybe I’ve seen too many similar set-ups like that in the Australian thriller series, ‘The Secret She Keeps’ (DVD, 6 episodes, 2 discs, Sundance Now, Not Rated). Adapted from a bestselling book, ‘Secret’ parallels, then intersects, two pregnant women. Agatha (Laura Carmichael, ‘Downton Abbey’) is the grocery store clerk living on the edge of poverty, proud of her pregnancy, especially considering her history which is revealed later. Meghan (Jessica De Gouw) is her opposite, a glam, cozily upper middle-class beauty who uses her pregnancy to promote her job as an online influencer. These women are destined to meet as, yes, secrets will be revealed. For myself, unfortunately, one ‘secret’ was too obvious from the very start. Bonus: Behind the scenes."
