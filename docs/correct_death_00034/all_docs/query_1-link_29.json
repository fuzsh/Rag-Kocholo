        "text": "Count Basie\n\nCount Basie\n\nSource: Time Toast\n\nBorn William James Basie on 21 August 1904 in Red Bank, New Jersey, pianist and swing and jump band leader, Count Basie, began his musical career in Red Bank with drummer, Sonny Greer, playing at dances and resorts. About 1920 he made his way to Harlem where Greer, who had preceded him to NYC and was drumming for Duke Ellington, introduced him to his scene. Basie then began to tour the States with vaudeville acts. Returning to Harlem in 1925, his first employment of note was at a place called Leroy's where cutting contests were held for upper class clientele. Finally, in 1928 Basie joined Walter Page's Blue Devils in Tulsa. Beginning to make progress now (and beginning to be called the \"Count\"), he joined Bennie Moten's band the next year in Kansas City. It was with Moten that Basie started to shine as a talent to be dealt with, also making his debut issued recordings with Moten in Chicago on October 23, 1921, 'The Jones Law Blues' and 'Small Black' among several.\n\n'The Jones Law Blues' Count Basie w Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra\n\n23 Oct 1929 in Chicago Matrix 57302-2 Victor 23357\n\nCornet: Ed Lewis / Booker Washington\n\nTrombone: Thamon Hayes / Eddie Durham (valve)\n\nClarinet / sax: Harlan Leonard / Jack Washington / Woody Walder\n\nPiano: Basie / Ira \"Buster\" Moten (accordion)\n\nDrums: Willie McWashington\n\nComposition: Bennie Moten / Count Basie\n\nBasie briefly led Moten's orchestra upon the latter's eventual absence in the early thirties, renaming it the Cherry Blossoms. In 1936 he reshaped that orchestra, called it the Barons of Rhythm, and began a residency in Chicago at the Grand Terrace Ballroom. Basie's first recordings as a leader were with that orchestra credited as Jones-Smith Incorporated on November 9, 1936. They were also tenor saxophonist, Lester Young's, first four featured releases: 'Shoe Shine Boy', 'Evening', 'Boogie Woogie' and 'Oh, Lady Be Good'.\n\n'Shoe Shine Boy' Count Basie w Jones-Smith Incorporated\n\n9 Nov 1936 in Chicago Matrix C-1657-1 Vocalion 3441\n\nTrumpet: Carl Smith Tenor sax: Lester Young\n\nPiano: Basie Upright bass: Walter Page\n\nDrums: Papa Jo Jones\n\nComposition: Sammy Cahn / Saul Chaplin\n\nIn 1937 Basie moved his band to NYC for a residency at the Roseland Ballroom and began to record for Decca. Among early titles for that label was 'Pennies From Heaven' with vocalist, James Rushing, issued on Decca 1121 in 1937. Among Basie's many compositions were 'Swinging at The Daisy Chain' issued on Decca 1121 in 1937, 'One O'Clock Jump' issued on Decca 1363 in 1937 and 'Jumpin' at the Woodside' released on Decca 2212 in 1938. 'One O'Clock Jump', probably Basie's best-selling title overall, shot to #15 on the popularity charts followed by 'Jumpin' at the Woodside' at #10. However, 'Stop Beatin' Around the Mulberry Bush' of 1938 breached the Top Ten at #6. 'Open the Door, Richard!' topped Billboard at #1 in 1947. Music VF finds Basie placing twelve titles in the Top Ten of the Pop or R&B categories from 1938 to 1956:\n\nStop Beatin' Around the Mulberry Bush #6 1938\n\nRusty Dusty Blues #6 R&B May 1943\n\nRed Bank Boogie #6 R&B March 1945\n\nJimmy's Blues #10 / #3 R&B Sep 1945\n\nThe Mad Boogie #10 April 1946\n\nBlue Skies #8 Sep 1956\n\nOpen the Door, Richard! #1 / #2 R&B Feb 1947\n\nFree Eats #7 April 1947\n\nOne O'Clock Boogie #8 June 1947\n\nI Ain't Mad at You #7 Aug 1947\n\nEvery Day (I Have the Blues) #2 R&B July 1955\n\nApril in Paris #8 Jan 1956\n\n'Pennies from Heaven' Count Basie and His Orchestra\n\n21 Jan 1937 in NYC Matrix 61543-A Decca 1121\n\nTrumpet: Buck Clayton / Joe Keyes / Carl Smith\n\nTrombone: George Hunt / Dan Minor\n\nAlto sax: Caughey Roberts / Jack Washington\n\nTenor sax: Herschel Evans / Lester Young\n\nPiano: Basie Guitar: Claude Williams Upright bass: Walter Page\n\nDrums: Papa Jo Jones Vocal: James Rushing Arrangement: Don Redman\n\nMusic: Arthur Johnston Lyrics: Johnny Burke\n\n'One O'clock Jump' Count Basie and His Orchestra\n\n7 July 1937 in NYC Matrix 62332-A Decca 1363\n\nComposition: Count Basie\n\n'Sent for You Yesterday and Here You Come Today' Count Basie and His Orchestra\n\n16 Feb 1938 in NYC Matrix 63286-A Decca 1880\n\nVocal: James Rushing Composition: Count Basie\n\n'Stop Beatin' 'Round the Mulberry Bush' Count Basie and His Orchestra\n\n22 Aug 1938 in NYC 1 of 2 takes both issued on Decca 2004\n\nTrumpet: Buck Clayton / Ed Lewis / Harry \"Sweets\" Edison\n\nTrombone: Benny Morton / Dan Minor / Dickie Wells\n\nReeds: Lester Young / Herschel Evans / Earl Warren / Jack Washington\n\nPiano: Basie Guitar: Freddie Green Upright bass: Walter Page\n\nDrums: Papa Jo Jones Vocal: James Rushing\n\nComposition: Clay Boland / S.

His operation from 1935 to 1950 is referred to as his Old Testament Band corresponding to the shellac recording period. His New Testament Band was shaped for recording on vinyl LPs stretching from 1952 into the eighties. Basie first took his orchestra to Europe in 1958, but didn't begin to wear his trademark yachting cap until 1964.\n\n'Open the Door, Richard!'

Tom Lord cites Chris Sheridan's 'Count Basie: A Bio-Discography' published by Greenwood Press in 1986, but doesn't list any of reportedly numerous titles. Prior to that Basie put away the album, 'Fancy Pants', in December of 1983 following a few other albums the same year: 'Me and You', '88 Basie Street' and 'Mostly Blues and Some Others'.\n\n'Fancy Pants' Count Basie Orchestra\n\n14 Dec 1983 in Hollywood toward the album 'Fancy Pants' on Pablo PACD-2310-920-2\n\nTrumpet: Dale Carley / Sonny Cohn / Jim Crawford / Bob Summers / Frank Szabo\n\nTrombone: Grover Mitchell / Dennis Wilson / Booty Wood / Bill Hughes\n\nAlto sax: Danny Turner / Chris Woods (flute)\n\nTenor sax: Eric Dixon (flute) / Kenny Hing\n\nBaritone sax: John C.
