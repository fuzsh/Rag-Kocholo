        "text": "By Briona Hopkins\n\nFlorida A&M University (FAMU) alumnus Scotty Barnhart won a Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, February 4.\n\nAn acclaimed jazz trumpeter, leader, composer, arranger, educator, and author, Barnhart earned his degree from FAMU. He also works as a Florida State University (FSU) music professor.\n\n“I’m elated to have won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble for our “Basie Swings The Blues” recording,” Barnhart said. “It’s extra special because this project was my idea from conception, and, luckily, I had the greatest Jazz orchestra in the world to bring my vision to reality in the most amazing way.”\n\nBarnhart is a former trumpeter in the FAMU Marching “100” Band. He has performed with such music legends as Frank Sinatra, Quincy Jones, Ray Brown, Aretha Franklin, and many more. His musical skills have led Barnhart to be named as the most important jazz trumpeter in history, according to Scott Yanow in his book,Trumpet Kings.\n\nValencia E. Matthews, Ph.D., dean of the FAMU College of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, is delighted about Barnhart’s win.\n\n“It is a beautiful thing to see Scotty receive a Grammy—so well-deserved. He is a wonderfully talented, world-class musician and musical director, and we are so proud of and happy to celebrate him,” Matthews said.\n\nWhen Barnhart is not touring with The Count Basie Orchestra, he performs with his own quintet-sextet and travels around to lecture and demonstrate at schools, play at conferences around the world, while introducing jazz to listeners and beginners who may want to discover the fine art of music.\n\nKnown for its innovative style of blending the blues and jazz, the Count Basie Orchestra was formerly led by the legendary Count Basie, who died in 1984 at age 79. Barnhart credits the long-standing art of Count Basie and is privileged to be part of continuing musical history.\n\n“I also have to say that this is all due to the genius of Count Basie and the incredible legacy he left us. To have his orchestra still at the top of its game in its 89th year of touring the world is astounding,” Barnhart said. “Basie won his first Grammy in 1958 and 66 years later his orchestra is still winning them. I’m honored to be the director of one of the most important orchestras in history.”"
