        "text": "The art of big-band arrangement is being rekindled. After years consigned to buffs' nights out for their prehistoric repertoires, high overheads, profligate staffing and absence of cool, the warmth, richness and urgency of the jazz orchestra is coming back on song.\n\nAmong the architects of this tradition, heroes like Count Basie and Duke Ellington are household names, but many of the crucial background figures are known only to enthusiasts. These are the staff arrangers, the artisans who could wrap the folds of an orchestra's tonal possibilities around the graceful form of a good tune - and do it at the drop of a cigar-butt.\n\nThe former Count Basie saxophonist, composer and arranger Ernie Wilkins, who has died aged 76, was one of those. His work was fundamental to the rebirth of the Basie band's reputation in the 1950s.\n\nWilkins's background in St Louis made him well acquainted with the blues, and the blues was the essence of the Basie band's direct appeal. Basie himself had been born in New Jersey but came up in Kansas City in the early 1930s, where the mob-run Kansas club-life was more pragmatic than New York and the expenses tighter. Blues was the popular local fare, and the agenda was high-quality populist, getting straight to the point.\n\nA decade and a half later, when the disorientated and struggling big-band leaders of the difficult post-war years were toying with fussy and over-complex arrangements to win the audiences back, it was Ernie Wilkins who reminded the Basie band of what it had once done best. He produced a succession of crackling arrangements as emphatic and arresting as a string of exclamation marks.\n\nHe kicked the whole process off by writing Every Day I Have The Blues for Basie's majestic singer Joe Williams almost as soon as he joined the orchestra in 1951. The song became a chart hit, and one of the best-selling jazz records of all time - and it put the flawless open roadster that had been the Basie band of the swing era back on the road.\n\nWilkins originally learned piano and violin, and played jazz as a teenage tenor saxophonist, growing up with the fine trumpeter Clark Terry, who was later to work with both Basie and Duke Ellington. During military service in the 1940s, he worked with the innovative altoist Willie Smith's ensemble, but the vital musical and professional experience of this period was joining the last big band of the piano virtuoso Earl Hines in 1948.\n\nWhen the Hines band broke up, Wilkins returned to St Louis, but three years later - when Basie was looking for an altoist - it was Terry's childhood friend who came to mind to fill the chair. He had to switch to a battered old alto the band dubbed \"the grey ghost\", but though his solo playing was never exceptional, his writing abilities soon surfaced.\n\nFollowing the success of Every Day I Have The Blues, Wilkins came up with Teach Me Tonight and Roll 'Em Pete for Joe Williams, as well as punchy arrangements of jazz and bebop standards. By the late 1950s, this talent was becoming widely appreciated, and he left Basie's staff to freelance for Dizzy Gillespie, Harry James, Sarah Vaughan, Buddy Rich and many others. His impact in the 1950s big-band world was so pervasive that Basie is reported to have said to James on a joint show, \"Who's going to play my arrangements first, me or you?\"\n\nWilkins's star waned in the 1960s when he turned to heroin, and it was Clark Terry who offered work when others had given up on him, although he did write for his trombonist brother Jimmy's group. When he straightened out, he and Terry worked extensively together throughout the 1970s, and for a period in that decade Wilkins headed artists and recording at Mainstream Records.\n\nMoving to Copenhagen in 1979, he refreshed his arranging career through work with his own Almost Big Band, and larger orchestras including the Danish Radio Big Band. Health problems hampered him in later years, but he continued to compose and arrange into the 1990s. Wilkins honed a jubilant, forthright style that has become something of a clich√© in other hands - but in his own, it was a 1950s revelation.\n\nErnest Brooks 'Ernie' Wilkins, jazz musician, born July 20, 1922; died June 5, 1999"
