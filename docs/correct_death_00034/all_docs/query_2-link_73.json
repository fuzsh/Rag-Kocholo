William \"Count\" Basie was an American jazz pianist and bandleader who formed the Count Basie Orchestra in 1935. Some key innovations of his band included using two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, and using arrangers. Many famous musicians came to prominence under his leadership over the band's almost 50 year run. Basie had an early musical education and got his start performing in vaudeville and with various bands in the 1920s-1930s before forming his own successful band.",
