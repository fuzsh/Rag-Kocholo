Featured music ranges from “El Grillo” (“The Cricket”), likely written by Josquin des Prez in the 1500s, to “Under the Sea,” Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s song from “The Little Mermaid,” a 1989 Disney animated film. Earth, Wind and Fire’s popular “September” is included, as is “The Storm is Passing Over” by Charles Albert Tindley, an African American Methodist minister and gospel music composer whose composition “I’ll Overcome Someday” is credited as the basis for the Civil Rights anthem “We Shall Overcome.” The combined choirs will close the concert with Brian Tate’s “We Are One,” an anthem adapted from Bible verses in Deuteronomy that carry a message of love and caring.

Through a series of chance encounters and unexpected connections, their individual stories begin to intersect, revealing the profound impact that everyday encounters can have on our lives.
