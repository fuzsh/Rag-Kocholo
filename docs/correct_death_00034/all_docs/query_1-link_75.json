        "text": "Thad Jones was stuck in neutral at the start of 1966. A few months shy of his 43rd birthday, the Pontiac-born trumpeter was toiling in the CBS studios and freelancing around New York. He had recently left the cozy nest of the Count Basie band, where he spent nine years from 1954-63. He contributed some potent arrangements to Basie, though his greatest fame came from inserting a mischievous quote of “Pop Goes the Weasel” to start his solo on “April in Paris” (1955).\n\nJones was the second of three brothers from Pontiac who became jazz royalty. Hank, the oldest, was an elegant pianist. Younger brother Elvin was one of the most innovative drummers in jazz history. By early 1966, Thad Jones was known as a versatile modernist, highly regarded by insiders as a thinking man’s improviser and an imaginative composer-arranger. But there was also a feeling that for a musician who bassist Charles Mingus had once celebrated as “Bartok with valves,” Jones’ career remained less noteworthy than his talent had predicted.\n\nThat began to change 50 years ago today. On Monday, Feb. 7, 1966, in a pie-shaped basement 15 steps below 7th Avenue in Manhattan, the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra made its debut at the Village Vanguard. The band, co-led by an A-list drummer, was an instant smash, and Jones was soon recognized as one of the most important and influential composer-arrangers in jazz. More than anyone else, as critic-musician Bill Kirchner once put it, Jones revitalized post-war big band writing for the conventional ensemble of saxophones, trumpets, trombones and rhythm section. Jones created a new template. On top of a Basie and Ellington foundation he added all the harmonic and rhythmic advances since bebop, even venturing into modal territory mapped out by John Coltrane. It was big band music in the present tense. In some ways it still is.\n\nJones, who died in 1986, and Lewis created an institution. They parlayed a handshake deal with Vanguard owner Max Gordon for a couple Monday nights into the longest running gig in jazz history. Fifty years and roughly 2,500 Mondays later, the band — which survived Jones’ decampment to Europe in 1979 and Lewis’ death in 1990 — lives on as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. The band has been celebrating its anniversary with an extended eight-night stand at the club.\n\nAnother piece of the anniversary party arrives on Feb. 19: Resonance Records is issuing a remarkable 2-CD set, “All My Yesterdays,” which documents the birth of the band, including six tracks recorded on that first Monday night 50 years ago and 11 more taped six weeks later.\n\nThese seminal recordings open a window on a critical chapter in modern jazz history. It's a rich, multi-layered story that begins with Jones' influential genius and the long-shadow of the orchestra he and Lewis created a half century ago. But the tale also reflects the explosion of jazz talent in Detroit in the middle of the 20th Century and the odd-couple partnership of an African-American trumpeter-composer and white drummer, whose integrated ensemble offered an inspiring model for the promise of American culture at its best\n\nThe music on the Resonance set, including such Jones classics as “The Little Pixie,” “Mean What You Say” and “Big Dipper,” practically explodes out of the speakers. Execution is not nearly as polished as it would become, but the excitement, electricity and spontaneity in the club are off the charts — you can hear Jones clapping and shouting encouragement to the band. The audience is shouting too, and you can feel the feedback loop inspiring the players.\n\nThe recordings were engineered by George Klabin, then a 19-year-old student at Columbia, who was hired by disc jockey Alan Grant, an early champion of the band, to help provide Jones and Lewis with a demo tape that they could use to secure a record deal. About 15 years ago, Grant released a shoddy bootleg of some of this music, obscuring the fact that there were two recording dates. Now Klabin, who owns Resonance, and co-producer Zev Feldman have done right by the material, meticulously sorting out the details and including an 88-page booklet featuring fresh interviews with surviving original band members and others. The sound quality is crystal clear.\n\nThere's one regrettable misstep. Because the original tape ran out before the end of \"The Little Pixie,\" the producers had to engineer a fade-out. But they have also surreptitiously spliced the opening chorus onto the end of the performance, clumsily re-arranging Jones' masterpiece.\n\nStill, the opening-night performance of “The Little Pixie” offers a distillation of Jones' art. Like a lot of his classics, it’s based on a simple form: a 32-bar “I Got Rhythm”-derived tune in A-flat that Jones transforms into a dazzling symphony of melody and swing. It begins with a surprising burst of muted brass, an ambiguous chord suspended in midair. Saxophones announce the jabbing theme, heavily syncopated and sparkling like pixie dust. Three scampering ensemble choruses follow as reeds and brass (in cup mutes to start, then open) chase after each other in a game of anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better. They trade 16-bar phrases, then 8s, then 4s. The writing is virtuosic and witty, filled with clever melodic pirouettes, breathless triplets, driving rhythmic accents and colorful chord extensions. Joyous swing is built into every phrase. Harmonies bite with dissonance. Tension builds. Fingers fly. Emotions soar. The ensemble merges in a rocking climax.\n\nWow!\n\nThe band included mostly midcareer pros from the studios, players with big band experience but also vibrant personalities as soloists, among them the section leaders Snooky Young, a peerless lead trumpeter, Jerome Richardson on alto saxophone and Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone. Hank Jones was on board, though another Detroit pianist, Roland Hanna, would soon assume his chair. Marvin (Doc) Holladay, who in the 1970s established the jazz program at Oakland University, played baritone sax on opening night, though the fire-breathing Pepper Adams, Jones’ first choice for the baritone chair, plays on the March 21 date and shortly thereafter replaced Holladay permanently. Hot young tenor Joe Farrell was in the sax section\n\nJones, more than 6 feet tall and built like a linebacker, played unpredictable solos on cornet and flugelhorn and conducted with a charismatic smile and homemade karate-chop gestures. The sidemen made $17 a night to start, though the band was so successful the members quickly got a raise — to $18. The Vanguard charged a $2.50 cover.\n\n“When word got out about the band, a crowd of musicians started showing up at rehearsals,” alto saxophonist Jerry Dodgion, an original member, said in an interview. “That first night the place was packed. Jazz was alive in New York, but it wasn’t thriving. Max wasn’t doing great. He said, ‘Mondays are a good night to try — nothing’s happening.’ Pretty soon, Mondays were sustaining him. It was good timing. The band exploded and the people were ready for it.”\n\nJones, who was 63 when he died, has been gone 30 years. While he's in the canon, his brilliance as an improviser and composer-arranger are not as widely understood or appreciated as they should be these days. Still, as great a trumpet soloist as Jones was — and he remains a vastly underrated school unto himself — his ultimate destiny was the big band. “The epitome of everything we’re trying to do musically — sounds, fury, distance, dissonance, space — happens in a big band,” Jones told Down Beat magazine in 1970.\n\nComing of age as a musician and man\n\nBorn Thaddeus Joseph Jones in 1923, he took up the trumpet at 13 or 14 after hearing Louis Armstrong on the radio, and he taught himself to play from method books. He played cornet at Pontiac High School and retained a lifelong preference for the instrument’s darker sound compared to the trumpet. Being self-taught reinforced his individuality.\n\n“There are certain things I do in certain ways that nobody else does,” Jones told Down Beat in 1955. “A schooled musician has, I imagine, a crisper style than mine, but there is a freedom in the way I play.”\n\nJones was raised on a rich diet of big bands. Duke Ellington's puckish cornetist Rex Stewart, who loved bent notes and half-valve effects, left the biggest imprint until Jones latched onto his most significant influence, Dizzy Gillespie. Jones assimilated the swift attack, complex syncopation and chromatic melodies that defined the emerging bebop style spearheaded by Gillespie and alto saxophonist Charlie Parker.\n\nJones played with territory bands, revues, carnivals and burlesque shows in the late '40s. The trips to the segregated south were rough: “We were having pistols stuck in our faces by cops,” he told Chip Deffaa in the 1985 book “Swing Legacy.” Those experiences and others like them left scars. Friends remember Jones as generous, gregarious, self-effacing and funny, but his mood and countenance could turn on a dime if he sensed any hint of racism, disrespect or condescension.\n\n“He had antennae up for that,” said trumpeter John McNeil. “It came close to having a chip on his shoulder, but if you were cool, he was cool with you.” McNeil said Jones told him about an incident on the street in front of Birdland in New York in the ‘50s in which Jones, wearing a suit and holding his horn case, was standing with friends when two cops approached. One said, “Hey, boys, break it up.” Jones, his temperature rising at the demeaning tone, replied sternly, “I don’t see no boys here!” The cops roughed him up. “I didn’t make it easy on them,” Jones told McNeil. “They had to call for backup. It took four of them to get me in that car. I got a few bruises, but it was worth it. They charged me with disorderly conduct or some bull, and I had to pay a fine.”\n\nJones retained an intense dislike for the south, especially Florida, where on a couple of occasions he left for home in the middle of tours with his own band because he perceived racist treatment. He was a complicated man. Mel Lewis told Bob Rusch in Cadence magazine in an interview published in 1990 that Jones created some scenes himself, situations exacerbated by Jones' issues with alcohol abuse.\n\nJones settled in Detroit, joining the house band in 1952 that tenor saxophonist Billy Mitchell led at the Blue Bird Inn on the West Side. It was the hippest modern jazz group at the hippest club in Detroit. The rest of the band was pianist-vibraphonist Terry Pollard (who was replaced by pianist Tommy Flanagan when she joined Terry Gibbs in 1953), bassist James (Beans) Richardson and drummer Elvin Jones.\n\nMitchell’s quintet became the stuff of legend, working on its own and backing visiting stars like Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt and Miles Davis. Several of Jones’ enduring originals date from this period, including “Zec,” “Elusive,” “Bitty Ditty,” “Scratch” and “50-21.\" In May 1954, Jones was hired out of Detroit by Basie, and he hit New York running.\n\nThe highlights of Jones’ early discography are the three LPs he made for Blue Note in 1956-57: “Detroit-New York Junction,” “The Magnificent Thad Jones,” “The Magnificent Thad Jones, Vol. 3.” Half the sidemen were colleagues from home, among them emerging stars like guitarist Kenny Burrell and bassist Paul Chambers, and these were among the first records to draw attention to the burgeoning pipeline of world-class talent from Detroit.\n\nJones’ initial LPs were part of an emerging hard bop mainstream, but they also stand apart. Unlike the loose blowing sessions coming into vogue, there is a wealth of organizational detail. Jones' compositions and improvisations are filled with what colleagues would come to call \"Jonesisms” — melodic surprises and dissonance, sudden harmonic shifts, rhythmic displacements, curious sequences and intervals —that keep the ear in a state of wonder. Jones’ solos are models of tension-and-release, each risky dissonance ingeniously resolved — like Gillespie taken to a higher level of abstraction.\n\nJones' tone was uniquely burnished and warm, and he didn’t rely on preconceived patterns and formulas. “If you talk about the percentage of true improvisation in a solo — or an entire career of solos — then Thad had one of the highest percentages in jazz history,” said trumpeter Tim Hagans. “The quality and percentage of literally new stuff that came out of his horn was astounding. That creative melodic language is what informs all his lead lines in his big band writing. That’s why his music has so much warmth and humor.”\n\nJones balanced organization and unpredictability. “I remember hearing him play night after night on tunes that I knew really well, and I would think: Why did he just play that?\" said John McNeil. “Then five or six seconds later I’d wonder why I never did! He could make a sequence out of anything. He would play a phrase, then play it a minor 3rd away, then maybe a step down; he would move it all over the place. And he would make changes to it as he went along, throwing other notes in or changing the rhythm.”\n\nJones told the New York Times in 1973: “There are no bad notes, just bad organization.”\n\nJones’ first big band arrangements with Basie in the late '50s fit comfortably into the Basie mold, but there are also Jonesisms: A trombone playing lead over the saxes on “H.R.H.” is as alluring as it is unusual. The ambitious “Speaking of Sounds” folds flute, clarinet and bass clarinet into the orchestration and a cutesy soft-shoe beat.\n\nAt a 1961 recording session that paired the Ellington and Basie bands, Duke’s ears perked up when he heard Jones’ sumptuous ballad “To You.” Ellington hired Jones in August 1963 for what turned out to be just a week. Jones joined the band at the Michigan State Fairgrounds in Detroit for performances of Ellington’s symphonic “Night Creature” with the Detroit Symphony led by associate conductor Walter Poole. Jones regarded the experience as one of the greatest musical highlights of his life. But he would later recall that he couldn’t keep the gig because he had just left Basie to spend more time with his wife and two children.\n\nJones revered Ellington. One Monday in 1968, Ellington veterans Britt Woodman and Jimmy Hamilton dropped by the Vanguard. When they left, Jones turned to David Berger, an aspiring composer-arranger: “Duke Ellington — greatest band in the world,” said Jones.\n\nBerger protested: “Your band's the greatest!”\n\n“No, no, no!” Jones said. “My band's not one-tenth of what Duke Ellington and Count Basie are and never will be.”\n\nJones elaborated on Ellington in Deffaa’s “Swing Legacy”: “I can’t think of anybody who was able to use the material available and to mold it and create such fantastic musical tapestries. It’s almost like watching a moving mural to listen to one of his arrangements. All of the different colors. All of the different intangibles that you feel emotionally.”\n\nThe birth of a band\n\nJones and Mel Lewis first met in Detroit on a sweltering July night in 1955 when Jones was with Basie and Lewis was with Stan Kenton. The groups were booked for a battle-of-the-bands dance at the Graystone Ballroom. After talking on a break, Jones invited Lewis to the West End Hotel, an after-hours jam session spot in southwest Detroit. They pair remained friendly, later crossing paths in the studios and the fertile Gerry Mulligan Concert Jazz Band in 1964. That’s when they began plotting their own band.\n\nThe demise of the Mulligan band set the stage for the Jones-Lewis orchestra. So did fate. Basie commissioned an album’s worth of material from Jones in 1965, but the arrangements proved too adventurous for Basie and the LP was scuttled. Jones and Lewis now had the foundation of a book of their own. Bob Brookmeyer, who found inspiration in Jones’ progressive dissonance and would become a highly influential writer himself, also contributed several key charts.\n\nThe co-leaders were a curious pair: One black and raised Baptist, the other white and Jewish; Jones was genial, Lewis rather brusque and a talker of Rabbinical proportion. But they were as close as brothers. They insisted on rooming together on the road, even though Jones was an inveterate ladies’ man and Lewis was often left to bide his time in hotel lobbies while Jones entertained a new friend upstairs. But Jones and Lewis shared musical values. Each wanted a disciplined band committed to the grandeur of the ensemble but with unfettered freedom granted to soloists.\n\nThey also insisted on an integrated band. From the start the group was half-black and half-white, a potent symbol of harmony in an era in which black-power politics were gaining currency. When the personnel tilted increasingly toward white players in the ‘70s, Jones and Lewis candidly complained to critic Leonard Feather in 1978 about the relative scarcity of young black musicians willing to commit to straight-ahead jazz in the fusion era and the irony that increasing opportunities for blacks in previously closed studios and pit bands were siphoning away potential sidemen.\n\nFor all of Jones’ originality, one of the most striking things about many of his compositions and arrangements is how basic the forms are and how saturated they are with the blues. On the new Resonance release, “Big Dipper,” “Backbone” and \"A-That's Freedom\" (Hank Jones' tune, but Thad's chart) are all 12 or 16-bar variations on the blues. Jones’ melodic imagination and reservoir of swing are inexhaustible. The theme of “Mean What You Say,” as memorable as a Gershwin tune, gives way to oodles of adroit counter-melodies, ornamentation, interludes and backgrounds. You could draw a frame around any detail and call it a song.\n\nThere were many other innovations and Jonesims. He set a new standard for the saxophone “soli” — a written passage for the section that mirrors an improvised solo. He reintroduced the soprano saxophone into a big band tapestry.His climatic shout choruses roar in gnarly yet swinging glory. In the '70s, he explored woodwind colors and even denser harmony. When you take the scores apart, you can see the craftwork. But there’s a soulful resonance far beyond technique. Jones tells stories. He gets under your skin where your emotions live. He excites the imagination, elevates the spirit.\n\n“I try to write it as I’m building a house, adding as I go, maybe bypassing one section and coming back to it, rather than go from level to level,” Jones told Down Beat in 1974.\n\nLewis was the band's secret weapon. The most musical big band drummer of the modern era, he swung in relaxed fashion at any tempo or volume, set up the ensemble with a minimum of fuss, and morphed into a fine small-group drummer behind solos. He teamed with idiosyncratic bassist Richard Davis to forge a groove unlike any other. Lewis’ drums laid behind the beat and Davis’ bass pushed ahead: Imagine the back and front legs of a chair moving in unison, the band riding on a wide cushion in between.\n\nThe audience never knew what was going to happen. Neither did the players. Jones would spontaneously cue the rhythm section in and out, letting a soloist go it alone for a few choruses or putting a horn player in motion with, say, just bass behind him. The two versions of “Big Dipper” on the new recording begin with hilariously heated unaccompanied discussions between Jerome Richardson’s baying alto sax and Jimmy Nottingham’s growling, plunger-muted trumpet. Background riffs behind soloists were often improvised on the spot, and Jones would mix and match them on the fly.\n\nThe Vanguard was Jones' living room. He had fun, and if you were in his orbit, you did too. One night Miles Davis was in the club and between tunes walked up to the band and asked Jones to play a ballad. “Sure!” said Jones. He turned to the band and counted off one of the fastest tunes in the book. The next tune was a ballad.\n\nThe original band recorded five indispensable LPs between 1966-70 — “Presenting Thad Jones-Mel Lewis & the Jazz Orchestra,” “Live at the Village Vanguard,” “Monday Night,” “Central Park North” and “Consummation.” There are also studio dates with Ruth Brown and Joe Williams and killer bootlegs of European concerts in 1969 with the added attraction of Joe Henderson (another former Detroiter) blowing up a storm on tenor sax. There’s a lot of great video from Europe floating around YouTube too.\n\nA legacy of individualism\n\nThe ‘70s on the whole were frustrating for Jones. He and Lewis were unable to parlay their acclaim into higher fees, steady recordings and more consistent touring. A New York Times story in 1973 gives a picture of Jones’ harried professional life: He taught at William Patterson University in Wayne, N.J., on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Five nights a week, plus matinees on Wednesday and Saturdays, were spent in the pit for “Two Gentlemen of Verona” on Broadway. On Fridays he flew to Boston to teach at the New England Conservatory. Monday nights were reserved for the Vanguard. “America makes a mockery of higher aesthetic yearning,” Jones told Jazz Journal International in 1979.\n\nHe had reached another crossroads. Beyond his gnawing restlessness, his marriage was breaking up, and there was a new woman in his life from Denmark. He began a relationship with the Danish Radio Big Band in 1977 that called for well-paid two-month residencies in Copenhagen in the fall and spring, including recording. He re-upped the next year, quietly laying the groundwork for a permanent move. Then came a bizarre incident whose details still remain elusive.\n\nWhile on tour with the Jones-Lewis band in 1978, Jones was in a taxi cab in Yugoslavia when a bystander shoved his fist through the window. The shattered glass cut Jones’ lip, and it would take three years and several surgeries before he could return to the cornet. He took up valve trombone for a while, because the larger mouthpiece required less muscle strength. In interviews Jones blamed the incident on a random act of violence by a drunk, but given his own volatile history it’s just as likely that words had been exchanged before the punch. Jones left the states without warning in January 1979 to start a new life in Denmark. “Thad and Mel got a divorce — and Mel got the kids” was a popular line at the time.\n\nLewis had been deeply hurt when Jones left. The drummer never really got over the bitterness, although he and Jones eventually reached a détente. The brief final chapter of Jones’ life began in 1985, when he returned to America to take over the Count Basie band after Basie’s death. The marriage got off to a promising start, but within a year an exhausted Jones returned to Copenhagen. He died of cancer in August 1986.\n\nJones’ music remains central to the big-band tradition. His arrangements are performed regularly and studied like Shakespeare in universities. Almost all of the mainstream big band arrangers and composers to emerge in the 1970s and ‘80s bore his influence, among them Jim McNeely, John Clayton and Bob Mintzer. The avant-garde hero Muhal Richard Abrams took something from Jones’ dissonance and angularity and dedicated a piece to him, “Big T.” Of the younger generation, the eclectic composer-bandleader Darcy James Argue grew up worshiping Jones. Countless once-a-week big bands all over the country grew out of the Jones-Lewis model. Jones' trumpet playing remains far less celebrated, but a goldmine of ideas and inspiration awaits anyone who discovers it.\n\nUltimately, however, Jones’ legacy transcends aesthetic bloodlines and musicology. The key lesson of his career is that his body of work defines a spirit of individualism as adamantly as any in jazz. “Each person has his or her own voice that they have to speak with if they want to speak the truth,” Jones said about a year before he died. That’s it exactly: The music of Thad Jones spoke the truth. The whole truth and nothing but.\n\nThis essay was adapted from Mark Stryker’s forthcoming book, “Made in Detroit: Jazz from the Motor City” (University of Michigan Press), to be published in 2017.\n\nContact Mark Stryker: 313-222-6459. mstryker@freepress.com"
