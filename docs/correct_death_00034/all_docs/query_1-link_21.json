        "text": "RED BANK - Growing up, William J. Basie would spend his days here watching vaudeville at the Palace Theatre, where he eventually filled in playing tunes on the piano to entertain audiences between movie reels.\n\nHe was good at it. At age 16, he won a contest in Asbury Park, where each piano player was limited to three minutes. Four years later, he was off to New York to launch a career that established him as one of America's finest jazz artists.\n\n\"He was just destined,\" said Gilda Rogers, vice president of the T. Thomas Fortune Foundation & Cultural Center in Red Bank. \"He was destined to be the Count.\"\n\nYears in the works: Count Basie Center unveils The Vogel performance space in Red Bank\n\nThe center, housed in the restored former residence of one of America's pre-eminent Black journalists, is hosting \"A Love Letter to Count Basie: From The Great Migration to The Harlem Renaissance,\" an exhibition that includes several of Basie's personal artifacts on loan from the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies and on display for the first time.\n\nThe exhibit traces African American history through Basie's life, connecting the past with the present. His parents moved from the South to escape racism. He used his celebrity to support the civil rights movement. And he was a pioneer of jazz, a uniquely American expression of sorrow and joy.\n\n\"He’s an American icon,\" said Elizabeth Surles, the archivist at the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies in Newark who oversees the collection. \"His role in jazz history is immeasurable in a lot of ways.\"\n\nTrailblazer: Oceanfirst names first Black board member; will other banks follow?\n\nAffable yet shy, Basie made his mark with swing music, performing with legends such as Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett and collecting accolades along the way.\n\nHe was the first African American to win a Grammy Award. He played at John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball. But Red Bank was a common thread.\n\nHis songs included \"The Kid from Red Bank\" and \"Red Bank Boogie.\" He played concerts in the borough, bringing Holiday with him to one in 1938 for a fundraiser to support the then-segregated YMCA on the borough's west side.\n\nBasie grew up the east side of town, on Mechanic Street. The original house apparently was damaged in a fire, although a reporter couldn't verify that from newspaper archives. But Basie built the current home — a one-story structure that resembles those that were prefabricated — so his father wouldn't have to walk up stairs, his father often said.\n\nState of the arts: Jersey Shore arts venues facing limited-capacity shows, funding crisis, uncertainty\n\nThe home's current occupants, Catherine Trasborg and her husband, John Burke, bought the home and moved from Jersey City two years ago, mainly because they liked the style.\n\nBut they have done their research and wonder if the legend that Count Basie's piano is buried in the foundation is true.\n\n\"Every now and then we get people that come by and if I’m out watering the plants they are like, 'Oh is this Count Basie’s home?'\" Trasborg said.\n\nBasie died in 1984 at age 79. Rutgers acquired a collection of nearly 1,000 artifacts, including pianos, photos, clothing, home movies, from his estate in 2018. The price wasn't disclosed.\n\nRogers, who attended the official announcement of the acquisition, was on a mission.\n\nBring it back: Red Bank movie theater to reopen as Basie Center Cinemas\n\n\"They said, which was true, that they had brought Count Basie home to New Jersey,\" she said. \"And I was like, 'Well, yes, you brought him home to New Jersey. But now let's get him to Red Bank, where he was born and raised.'\"\n\nRogers spoke to the Asbury Park Press this week about Count Basie, the exhibit and its lessons.\n\nFive takeaways:\n\n1. Before he was the Count\n\nBasie was born in 1904 to Harvey Lee and Lillian Basie, who had moved to Red Bank from Chase City, Virginia, as part of the Great Migration of African Americans. Harvey worked as a horse-and-buggy coachman; Lillian was a laundress.\n\nTheir son, known as Bill, took piano lessons when he was 5 years old from Grace Malchow, who taught at her studio on West Front Street. And he played the piano for the choir at Pilgrim Baptist Church, then on Pearl Street, where his father was a trustee.\n\n\"He's inspired right here in Red Bank,\" Rogers said. \"He was inspired by the carnivals that used to come to town once a year. And I guess the entertainment and the jubilant environment inspired him. He writes about it in his memoir, 'Good Morning Blues.' And he says that when the carnival used to come to town, he hated for them to leave, because he wanted to go with them.\"\n\n2. The Count of Basie\n\nBasie didn't graduate from high school, finding his way instead to New York, where at the age of 20, he joined the jazz scene and became part of the Harlem Renaissance, a center for Black culture that emerged in the1920s.\n\nBasie went on to Kansas City, where he took over the Bennie Moten band, renaming it Count Basie and his Cherry Blossom Orchestra. Radio broadcasted his concerts nationwide, reaching legendary record producer John Hammond.\n\nBasie's career took off.\n\n\"He was playing at a club in Kansas City and the announcer said, 'We have the Duke of Ellington, the Earl of Hines. Now we have the Count of Basie,'\" Rogers said. \"And it stuck and he became Count Basie. William James “Count' Basie.\"\n\nNew and improved: Everything to know about Count Basie expansion\n\n3. A common language\n\nBasie was considered shy and unassuming, steering clear of booze and drugs, according to a 1974 Red Bank Register story.\n\nHe grabbed the spotlight nonetheless, teaming up with the biggest stars of the day.\n\n\"Frank Sinatra hired the Count Basie Orchestra to play with him,\" Rogers said. \"If they traveled south and Count Basie couldn't stay at a particular hotel, Frank didn’t play. So he is in a crossroads at a particular time where race is definitely prominent. And he is eclipsing race through his music. So we have to understand how music, not just music, but art, is transformative and brings people together.\"\n\n4. The activist Count\n\nBasie and his wife, Catherine, were involved in the civil rights movement, lending their celebrity to end discrimination that had been part of their lives.\n\nIn 1963, Basie joined a protest in Tallahassee, Florida, after he was refused service at a restaurant after a performance at Florida State University.\n\n\"Here's this orchestra of basically all Black men, very polished, poised and great musicians,\" Rogers said. \"So he's presenting himself in a way that is so professional and polished, and his artistry is so accomplished he can't be denied. He can't be denied. That's power. Even in the face of inequality, he took his art to a point where he could not even be denied.\"\n\nCount Basie Center spent years on expansion: COVID-19 has it 'in dire straits'\n\n5. The power of jazz\n\nBasie was seen as affable, but if he was hurting beneath the surface, he had a perfect outlet: jazz.\n\n\"This is where the music comes from,\" Rogers said. \"The depth of suffering. And jazz speaks to all of that. And jazz encompasses and brings everybody along with it. That's why jazz is so diverse. It speaks everybody's language. Everybody knows suffering. So jazz is that. And it was born right here in America.\"\n\nIf you go: \"A Love Letter to Count Basie: From the Great Migration to the Harlem Renaissance is at the T.
