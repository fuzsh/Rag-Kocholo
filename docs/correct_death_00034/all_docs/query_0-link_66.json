        "text": "September 23, 1939 - August 14, 1988\n\nLeroy \"Roy\" Buchanan was a guitarist and blues musician known as a pioneer of the Telecaster sound. His work as a sideman and as a solo artist is considered to be highly influential.\n\nBuchanan made his recording debut in 1958, accompanying Dale Hawkins and playing the solo on \"My Babe\" for Chicago's Chess Records. Two years later, during a tour through Toronto, Buchanan left Dale Hawkins to play for his cousin Ronnie Hawkins and tutor Ronnie's guitar player, Robbie Robertson. Buchanan plays bass on the Ronnie Hawkins single \"Who Do You Love?\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Buchanan often played as a sideman with various rock bands, playing guitar in recording sessions with Freddy Cannon, Merle Kilgore, and others. At the end of the 1960s, with a growing family, Buchanan briefly left the music industry and became a barber.\n\nBuchanan's life changed in 1971, when he gained national notice as the result of an hour-long PBS television documentary. Entitled Introducing Roy Buchanan, leading to a record deal with Polydor Records and praise from John Lennon and Merle Haggard and, allegedly, an invitation to join the Rolling Stones. He turned down the offer, earning him the nickname \"the man who turned the Stones down.\" He recorded five albums for Polydor, one of which, Second Album, went gold, and then three more albums for Atlantic Records, one of which, 1977's Loading Zone, also went gold.\n\nIn 1985, be began recording for Alligator Records, releasing When a Guitar Plays the Blues. His second Alligator LP, Dancing on the Edge (with vocals on three tracks by Delbert McClinton), was released in the fall of 1986. He released the twelfth and last album of his career, Hot Wires, in 1987. Buchanan's last show was on August 7, 1988, at Guilford Fairgrounds in Guilford, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1988, Buchanan was arrested for public intoxication after a domestic dispute. He was found hanged from his own shirt in his Fairfax County, Virginia jail cell on August 14, 1988. His cause of death was officially recorded as suicide, a finding disputed by Buchanan's friends and family. One of his friends, Marc Fisher, reported seeing Roy's body with bruises on the head.\n\nAfter his death, compilation and other albums continue to be released, including in 2004 the never-released first album he recorded for Polydor, The Prophet.\n\nRoy Buchanan is interred at Columbia Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n07/29/198855Pete Drakepedal steel guitaristLung CancerNashville, Tennessee"
