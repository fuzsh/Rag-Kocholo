        "text": "With nine children, the Alberico house always brimmed with activity.\n\nOn Sundays, the din of nine children became drowned out by the mash-up of some of the area’s most talented musicians. They were all there to jam with Sal Alberico Sr.\n\nThe Utica musician died Tuesday at age 82. He’ll be remembered for the deep roots he made in the community’s music scene as well as the foundation he formed as a loving and fair father, friends and family said.\n\n“He was a serious father and just a great fun friend,” said his one of two sons, Joe Alberico, 60, of Mohawk. “He had seven daughters, so the poor guy didn’t sleep for 30 years, and literally, he didn’t go to sleep before everyone was in the house.”\n\nHis parenting was just and fair, Joe Alberico said. Those traits spilled over into his music career, for which he had great passion, he said.\n\nHe never showed up late for a gig, and he never canceled one.\n\n“I don’t think he ever went to a job less than an hour before the job,” Joe Alberico said. “That was his thing. That was very important to him to be there and do the job and make the people enjoy it and make the club owner happy.”\n\nStarting at age 11, that’s exactly what Sal Alberico did. His mother paid $154 for a clarinet and lessons at Schwender’s on Columbia Street, and his father – a drummer — offered more encouragement. A year later, it seems, mom got her money’s worth when Sal landed his first engagement.\n\nHe was 11 when he and his two friends Carl Cardarelli and Ray DeFiore began playing at the Palm Grill at Second and Bleecker streets.\n\n“They had to get special permission from the Liquor Board for us to be there, and we couldn’t go into the barroom,” Sal once said in an interview. “We got paid $1.50 on Friday and $2 on Saturday, plus a covered meatball sandwich and a Coke at the end of the night.”\n\nEventually, Sal traded clarinet for saxophone. He performed in every band and orchestra in Proctor High School before graduating in 1948 and later joined the Tony Rogers Band, a local group of wide acclaim.\n\n“He had a lot of friends,” said childhood friend and fellow musician Dan Falatico. The two played together for decades. Falatico last spoke to his friend two weeks before he died in Florida.\n\n“He was a fantastic musician. He could have played with anybody.”\n\nAnd he did.\n\nFor decades, his bands have been synonymous with swing, featuring the Big Band sounds of Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Count Basie and others. In addition to his own group, Sal backed up the best in the business, including Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole and Tony Bennett. He used his talents to assist charities, especially Operation Sunshine, which was “his baby,” his son said.\n\nHe served many years as union president of Local 51, American Federation of Musicians, and as recently as three years ago he was the front man for his Big Band and played with several smaller groups. He was honored in 2009 by the Oneida County Historical Society as a Living Legend.\n\nHe and his wife, the former Marie DeSimone – who died in June — were married 62 years."
