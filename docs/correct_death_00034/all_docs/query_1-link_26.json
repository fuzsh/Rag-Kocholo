        "text": "Florida State jazz professor and trumpet player Scotty Barnhart is one of the world’s leading experts when it comes to legendary pianist-songwriter-bandleader Count Basie (1904-1984).\n\nThere’s a good reason for it, too, because it’s his job.\n\nBarnhart spent 20 years as a soloist with the Count Basie Orchestra before being tapped as the big band’s director three years ago. He’s played two concerts in Tallahassee as a member of the orchestra. On Saturday night, he will make his debut as director of the Basie Orchestra in front of the hometown crowd during the inaugural Florida Jazz & Blues Festival in Cascades Park.\n\n“Coming here to do it is something hard to describe,” Barnhart, 51, said earlier this week. “It’s like it’s my first gig or something.”\n\nTo add a little extra pressure, Barnhart also is serving as the artistic director for the Florida Jazz & Blues Festival. He reached out to friends and colleagues such as pianist Marcus Roberts, singer-pianist Freddy Cole, blues guitarist Johnnie Marshall, vocalist Avis Berry, drummer Leon Anderson and Grammy Award-winner Brian Lynch to join the musical maiden voyage.\n\n“People are going to have a lot of world-class talent in their backyard,” Barnhart said. “I’ve never seen a new festival with this level of talent. Especially for the first time.”\n\nWhen the 17-piece Count Basie Orchestra takes the amphitheater stage as the evening’s closer on the second night of the three-day festival’s run, it will showcase a mixture of the old and the new.\n\n“I try to make sure we have every decade, every period of the band covered from 1935 to today,” Barnhart said.\n\nExpect the setlist to include such standards as “April in Paris,” a salute to Basie’s pal Frank Sinatra and, of course, “One O’Clock Jump,” the Basie Orchestra’s signature tune. Every member of the band will get a shot at taking a solo, including the new drummer Ray Nelson Jr., 23, who graduated from FAMU last year.\n\n“Both his (Nelson’s) parents are musicians, his whole family is musicians, so he was born with music in his ears,” Barnhart said. “He’s part of the future of this orchestra.”\n\nBasie was born in New Jersey and got his start playing the vaudeville circuit in New York when he was very young. The legendary Fats Waller gave him a few keyboard lessons. In the mid-’20s, Basie ended up in Kansas City, Mo., which was a hotbed for jazz during the Roaring Twenties. In the mid-’30s, Basie formed the Barons of Rhythm band, which eventually morphed into the Count Basie Orchestra after a return to New York City.\n\nStarting in 1937, Basie’s big band scored smash hits with “One O’Clock Jump” and “Jumpin’ at the Woodside.” If The Duke Ellington Orchestra was the sophisticated sound of the Big Band Era, the County Basie Orchestra was its swinging dance band.\n\n“Those two orchestras set the standards for all the orchestras that followed,” Barnhart said.\n\nEven though Big Band Era faded after the end of World War II, the Count Basie Orchestra defied the odds and returned to popularity starting in the ‘50s thanks to recordings with singers such as Joe Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Bennett and Sinatra. In 1958, Basie became the first black male artist to win a Grammy Award.\n\nRacial barriers were harder to break down when Basie and his band toured the South during the Jim Crow days.\n\nIn December 1963, The Count Basie Orchestra played a concert at Florida State University. After the show, Basie and FSU sociologist James Geschwender went to The Mecca restaurant on campus, near the corner of Copeland Street and Park Avenue. They were refused service.\n\nThe next day, Basie joined protestors on the sidewalk who were picketing outside The Mecca. The world-famous bandleader held a sign that read: “All We Asked Was Equality and Justice.” The photo of Basie’s defiance was published in newspapers across the nation.\n\nDespite the bad publicity, The Mecca remained segregated until 1964 when the Civil Rights Act was passed.\n\n“Man, can you imagine what all they had to put up with in those days?” Barnhart said. “We have it easy today. They paved the way. They did all the hard work.”\n\nNot all racism was as blatant as The Mecca incident. Basie, who liked to wear a yachting captain’s cap in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s, was often racially profiled in a more benign manner while out on the road. Barnhart retold a story he heard from saxophonist John Williams about Basie being mistaken as a bell hop while he was waiting for his tour bus outside an upscale hotel in Detroit.\n\n“This cab pulls up and these two little old white ladies get out,” Barnhart said. “They looked like they had a little bit of money, had their furs on. So Basie just happened to be standing right there where they were, so they put their suitcases at his feet and said, ‘Sonny, will you follow us.’ Basie didn’t flinch. He picked up them up and said, ‘Yes, ma’m.’ He followed them to the elevator and waited there with them. The guys in the band couldn’t believe he was doing this. The elevator doors open and he got on with them. He gets to their room, drops the luggage down and they gave him a quarter. They had no idea who he was. That’s a true story, man.”\n\nDrummer Harold Jones, in his memoir titled “The Singer’s Drummer,” corroborated Barnhart’s bell hop tale: “He (Basie) was often mistaken for being a porter. Women would approach him to ask for help with their baggage. Sometimes he would actually do it and take the tip. But usually he would refer the traveler to a real porter or to another band member, as a joke. When Paul Probes was the roadie, Basie would always refer these requests to him. Basie got a kick out of this since Probes was white.”\n\nBasie’s sense of humor and playful nature helped attract musicians who were loyal to their boss.\n\n“The thing about Basie is that we are the only band that’s still on the road 32 years now after the leader’s death with members in it that he hired,” Barnhart said. “Basie was always the guy with the slowest turnover rate. ... When you got someone like that as your leader, you want to play for someone like that, you’re not afraid to play for someone like that. You want to have a good time and that’s what he was all about. He wanted the guys in the band to be happy. And I try to understand that, too.”\n\nWatch Count Basie Orchestra rehearse\n\nThe Count Basie Orchestra is holding an open rehearsal at 11 a.m. sharp Saturday in the FAMU Band Rehearsal Hall, 1660 Pinder Ave. It’s free and open to the public. Parking will be available on campus. Orchestra director Scotty Barnhart will also give a brief talk about the band and its legacy."
