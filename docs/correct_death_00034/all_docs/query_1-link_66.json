        "text": "Whatever remaining light there was shining on this impossibly tough year just grew a little dimmer.\n\nA \"gentleman\" and a \"godfather\" are no longer with us as Brevard County and Central Florida lost two giants this week, champions of the arts who inspired countless with their passion for music and community theater.\n\nLegendary WUCF FM 89.9 Jazz on the Beach host Jack Simpson, \"the Gentleman of Jazz,\" died Sunday at the age of 96. His passing was followed four days later by that of 85-year old Arlan Ropp, known affectionately as the \"Godfather of Theater.\"\n\nMore: Love vinyl? Titusville music enthusiast picks 10 albums every audiophile should own\n\nNormally the arts are a perfect escape from the realities of everyday life. But in a year rocked by pandemic, social unrest and economic uncertainty, the arts have really taken a hit. Only recently have theaters and music venues begun to re-open cautiously to offer a respite from the world. Now we lose these two celebrated icons of the local arts scene.\n\nI had the honor of knowing Ropp a bit these last few years, having met him during an event I emceed naming the annual Surfside Playhouse Playwriting contest after him, at meetings of the Playwrights Workshop of Brevard where he encouraged inexperienced authors, and finally being cast alongside him in his last performance in the Surfside Playhouse Production of \"Arsenic and Old Lace.\"\n\nI got to share his final curtain call.\n\nHe was a marvel to watch and a calming presence for those less-experienced thespians like myself. I remember castmate Peter Olander and myself nervously searching for Ropp as his entrance neared. We were to follow him on stage and oftentimes couldn't find him anywhere.\n\nBut our worry was for naught as Ropp would slowly shuffle to make his perfect entrance like clockwork. And, naturally his small scene stole the show as he was chased off the stage by Mortimer Brewster to raucous laughter and applause. Then he would calmly shuffle back to the green room where he would do puzzles, talk about his grandchildren or regale us with theater stories or his barbershop quartet.\n\nRopp was a fixture for 30 years in Brevard Community College's theater and communications departments, before retiring in 1998. He always said if he were to write his autobiography, he'd title it 'From Tractor to Actor.'\n\nThat's because Ropp was born and raised on a farm in Illinois. He told me the home was so cold and drafty that as a child he could sometimes see his breath during the winter. So, it was no surprise that he wound up in Brevard County in 1968 when he was hired to teach English, Speech, Television Production and Drama at what was then called Brevard Junior College.\n\nIt wasn't long before he was acting and directing on local stages.\n\nMore: The shows go on: Brevard theaters announce 2020-21 seasons\n\nIn 1992, he joined what is now called the Barbershop Harmony Society and performed with them until the pandemic.\n\nDespite his age, news of Ropp's death took the local theater community by surprise. I guess he was one of those people we assumed would be around forever. Longtime actor Terrence Girard described Ropp as \"encouraging and generous.\"\n\n\"I'd only been acting at Surfside a short while when Arlan gave me an opportunity to perform in a dinner theatre project he was spearheading at one of the Cocoa Beach hotels — the lead in Neil Simon's 'Barefoot in the Park.' Imagine how stoked I was to be paid a stipend, to act!\" Girard said.\n\n\"(Arlan) worked with all the theater groups, so was universally beloved by our theater community. He'll be greatly missed.\"\n\nLike Girard, Bryan Bergeron, artistic director at the Surfside Playhouse, also landed his first paid acting gig thank to Ropp, whom he first met in 1972 at BCC.\n\nBergeron said in many ways he owes his own 45-year career in theater to Ropp and his kind, steady tutelage.\n\n\"And the amazing thing is he never stopped. Arlan was truly a force of nature,\" Bergeron said. \"I owe so much to that man. I for one will feel his loss deeply.\"\n\nI never had the pleasure of meeting Jack Simpson in person but heard of him often and his affinity for and expertise in jazz. A native of north England, Simpson never fell in with the boys from Liverpool or the psychedelic sounds of Syd Barrett. Even as a child, he told my colleague Lynn Dowling in 2017 that he was drawn to jazz.\n\nAfter a stint in the Royal Air Force, Simpson moved to the U.S. where he married his wife Lorraine and settled in Brevard County. Frustrated by the lack of jazz on the radio, he contacted FLORIDA TODAY's Help! column in 1967 asking for help to put jazz on the radio. Shortly after, WKRT, a station in Cocoa, gave him an hour a week to play jazz recordings from his own collection.\n\nThat was the beginning of his more than 50-year run of his \"Jazz on the Beach\" radio show. Simpson co-founded the Space Coast Jazz Society, wrote a jazz column for FLORIDA TODAY, served as master of ceremonies for numerous jazz festivals and hosted his radio show for more than 50 years.\n\nMore: Satellite Beach plaza hoping for picture-perfect comeback with new movie theater and more\n\nThe station continued running previously broadcast shows and occasionally Simpson would pop in do a live show.\n\n“Jack Simpson was so special to so many people. We all loved him,\" said Kayonne Riley, WUCF Director of Radio. \"We often referred to Jack as our “gentleman of jazz” since he was always respectful, patient, kind, thoughtful, passionate and caring in every aspect of his life – the way he spoke on air, how he interacted with you, and how he lived his life. We will never forget him.”\n\nSimpson died only three months after the passing of his wife, Lorraine.\n\nLocal jazz musician Shannon Cherry (who I've seen do incredible things with his saxophone) said he first met Simpson when he was a music student at then Brevard Community College.\n\n\"He was incredibly and even persistently encouraging to me, always had recommendations of who to listen to,\" Cherry said. \"Later I’d learn that he was the immortal Jack Simpson — who I’d heard all the years of my youth with 'Jazz on the Beach'. \"\n\nMore: COVID-19 has all but silenced live music. Can it bounce back, and will it be the same?\n\nIncredibly, Cherry also had a close relationship with Ropp.\n\n\"The craziness in all of this was we have lost Arlan Ropp this week as well, who was a friend, a senior mentor, a former professor of mine and a fellow actor, writer and singer,\" Cherry said.\n\nIs it New Year's Eve yet? 2021 can't come quick enough.\n\nTribute for Simpson\n\nWUCF FM 89.9 Jazz & More will air a tribute to its long-time Jazz On The Beach host Jack Simpson on Saturday, September 26 at noon. WUCF's special tribute to Jack Simpson will include listener memories and stories of the Central Florida Jazz icon as well as some of the best of moments of Jack's Jazz On The Beach program on 89.9 Jazz & More."
