        "text": "US #3096\n\n1996 Count Basie\n\nFirst Day Cover\n\nPart of set featuring four legendary Big Bank Leaders\n\n7th pane in the Legends of Music series\n\nStamps were issued on same day as Songwriters stamps in same series\n\nStamp Category: Commemorative\n\nSet: Big Band Leaders, American Music series\n\nValue: 32¢, First-Class mail rate\n\nFirst Day of Issue: September 11, 1996\n\nFirst Day City: New York, New York\n\nPrinted by: Ashton-Potter (USA) Ltd.\n\nPrinting Method: Lithographed\n\nFormat: Panes of 20 (4 across, 5 down) from plates of 120 (12 across, 10 down)\n\nPerforations: 11.1 x 11\n\nWhy the stamp was issued: The five stamps in the Big Band Leaders set honor talented individuals who contributed to the sound of Big Band music. They include Count Basie, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, and Benny Goodman.\n\nAbout the stamp design: The portraits of the four big band leaders were made by Bill Nelson, who works in colored pencils on recycled charcoal paper. He had previously designed album covers for big band recordings compiled by Time-Life Records.\n\nFirst Day City: The set of five Big Band Leaders stamps was dedicated at Shubert Alley in New York City. The Songwriters stamps from the same series were issued at the same time. It kicked off the US Postal Service’s American Music Stamp Festival 1996. Family members of the men featured on the stamps were present at the ceremony.\n\nAbout the Legends of American Music Series: The Legends of American Music Series debuted on January 8, 1993, and ran until September 21, 1999. More than 90 artists are represented from all styles of music: rock ‘n’ roll, rhythm and blues, country and western, jazz and pop, opera and classical, gospel and folk. In addition to individual singers and Broadway musicals, subjects include band leaders, classical composers, Hollywood songwriters and composers, conductors, lyricists, and more. The Legends of American Music Series was a huge advancement for diversity because it honored many Black and female artists.\n\nHistory the stamp represents: The success of the Benny Goodman Orchestra in 1935 led to the formation of other big bands led by such talented individuals as Count Basie, Tommy and jimmy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller.\n\nBasie’s mother taught him to play piano when he was young and he began performing in his hometown as a young teenager. He learned to accompany the silent films that played at the local theatre. Basie preferred drums at first, but by the time he was 15 he realized his true talent was on the piano.\n\nThe band, with Basie’s musical contributions, began playing a style of music that soon became known as swing. After playing with Moten’s band for a number of years, Basie formed his own. One night they were broadcasting on a local radio station and had some time to fill at the end of the program. The group began improvising, and that session produced a song Basie called “One O’Clock Jump.” It became the band’s signature songs for many years.\n\nBy 1936, his band was called Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm. They became known for their strong rhythm section and for using two tenor saxophones instead of just one. Other bands were soon copying the sound. That October, the band recorded some of their music. The producer later called it “the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I’ve ever had anything to do with.”\n\nCount Basie was able to continue playing his piano and leading bands for decades. He played for such great soloists as Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and Tony Bennett. During his career the Count earned nine Grammy awards and made a permanent mark on American music. He passed away on April 26, 1984, in Hollywood, Florida. The Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank is one of several places named in his honor."
