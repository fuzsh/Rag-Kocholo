        "text": "A legacy is something that lives on after your death and The Count Basie Orchestra obviously fits that description. Count Basie passed away in 1984, but his music lives on in this group. Two of the present members of the orchestra actually performed with him.\n\nAt the Holland Performing Arts Center in Omaha on Feb. 13, The Count Basie Orchestra combined the best of the blues, jazz, swing and Big Band to create an evening of musical delights for the large audience."
