        "text": "By Steve Elman\n\nHow well or how poorly are we paying homage to our jazz ancestors? Some graves are worthy places of pilgrimage. Others are neglected . . . or unknown.\n\nBud Powell”s body lies in an unmarked grave in a poorly-kept cemetery in Pennsylvania.\n\nDoes this shock you? Are you amazed that one of the great artists of the twentieth century, a pianist who influenced countless others after him, has one more ignominy added to his troubled life?\n\nIt shocked me when Peter Pullman, Bud’s biographer, told me about it. I went back to his Wail: the Life of Bud Powell (Bop Changes, 2013) and found it as compelling as it was when I reviewed it almost eleven years ago.\n\nWail does not linger at Powell’s deathbed. But Pullman is so thorough in his devotion to his subject that he has begun a campaign to raise funds supporting reburial of the pianist’s remains in one of the sites best-known to jazzpeople, the “Jazz Corner” of Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. To learn more about the campaign and how you can help, see “More” below.\n\nIt is understandable that one would want to visit the grave of an artist one reveres, and to see it well-marked and well-cared-for. I remember my visit to Copenhagen’s Assistens Cemetery in 2013, when I was easily able to find the plot where Ben Webster’s ashes are interred and where I was able to stand in a few moments of silent homage to an artist whose work still means a lot to me.\n\nPullman’s discovery fired up my curiosity about other jazz graves, so I set out to investigate how well or how poorly we are honoring our jazz ancestors. I was surprised to learn how well-documented some tombs are and how mysteriously others are said to be “unknown,” which often means “undocumented” or even “unresearched.”\n\nIt seems that for the great majority of jazz performers, what had been a life lived substantially in public becomes suddenly private after death. The postmortem decisions pass out of the deceased’s hands into those of his or her survivors. These people – and sometimes the funeral directors they employ – determine where and how the remains are to be memorialized. Some artists are remembered in keeping with their importance, and their graves can legitimately be said to be places worthy of pilgrimage. Some deaths are mysterious and the places of interment even more so. And money is always a factor.\n\nWhat follows are some notable postmortem anomalies. We should begin with Bud Powell. His story may be an example of the kinds of issues that interfere with worthy recognition.\n\nPowell died of tuberculosis, alcoholism, and malnutrition on July 31, 1966 at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn. His funeral took place on August 8 of that year, and several thousand witnessed his funeral procession. Rev. John Gensel, who made service to the jazz community in New York his life’s work, paid for Powell’s remains to be transported to Fairview Cemetery in Willow Grove, PA, where his body was buried next to those of his mother Pearl and his brother Richie. But no stone was erected, despite good will from Powell’s fellow musicians like Max Roach. It appears that no one had enough money to provide the stone Powell should have had. When Peter Pullman visited Powell’s grave, he noted, “Fairview is a very poor facility, poorly maintained,” and he received approval from Powell’s heirs to begin an effort to give Powell a fitting memorial.\n\nAnother bebop master, Dizzy Gillespie himself, is also buried in an unmarked grave, “next to his mother,” in Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, NY, according to findagrave.com. In March 2019, Andy Senior of The Syncopated Times noted this and said, “To our knowledge, Dizzy never expressed the wish that his grave be left unadorned.” This may be another example of time gnawing away at chances for appropriate recognition.\n\nBassist Paul Chambers was one of the busiest sidemen in jazz at the height of his career, and a member of one of the great rhythm sections of all time, in Miles Davis’s first great quintet, with Red Garland on piano and Philly Joe Jones on drums. He was an invaluable contributor to dozens of classic LPs, like Davis’s Kind of Blue, Porgy and Bess, and Sketches of Spain; John Coltrane’s Giant Steps; Sonny Clark’s Sonny’s Crib; and Abbey Lincoln’s That’s Him. Chambers fought addictions to heroin and alcohol, and his ability as a musician decayed as the years passed. Eventually his substance abuse led to tuberculosis, a coma, and death in New York City in 1969. The news barely rated a ripple in the mainstream press (or even in the jazz press), and it took years before he began to receive his due. Only one source (a feature on Chambers by David Yearsley) identifies his place of burial as The Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, where Lester Young, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and producer Bob Thiele are also buried. The cemetery itself does not even mention him among its notable “residents.”\n\nOn the other hand, Elvin Jones, the drummer in another great band, John Coltrane’s so-called “classic quartet,” with McCoy Tyner and Jimmy Garrison, played brilliantly and was lionized to the very end of his career. There was even a public memorial service in New York City after his death from heart failure in Englewood, New Jersey in 2004. But assiduous searches of the net do not turn up any information about whether he was cremated or where he was buried. Presumably, his family knows, but it is surprising that there appears to be no lasting memorial – whether a gravestone, a statue or even a plaque – to one of the great percussionists of all time.\n\nPossibly the most notorious death in jazz history was that of the tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray, whom fans in the bebop era expected to become the Charlie Parker of the tenor saxophone. But like many other beboppers, Gray became addicted to heroin. After he died of an overdose in Las Vegas in 1955, friends brought his body to the desert and left it there. What happened to the remains has not yet been documented in any source I can find.\n\nThe death of saxophonist Albert Ayler, like that of Gray, was a tragedy. His body was found in the East River in New York City in November 1970, and it was common speculation that he had committed suicide, although there was some suspicion that he had been murdered. His grave is in Highland Park Cemetery, Highland Hills, Ohio, near his birth city of Cleveland Heights.\n\nThere must be an unequivocal story of suicide, of course. Disappointment and frustration dog the lives of many jazzpeople, but the name of one who killed himself may be a surprise to many: J. J. Johnson, an unqualified success by any measure. Johnson’s amazing control of the notoriously difficult trombone is documented on dozens of recordings, and he was also an accomplished composer. Ultimately, suicides are unexplainable to the survivors, but perhaps Johnson felt despair at the decay of his abilities resulting from his battle with spinal stenosis, which can be so painful that it consumes a person’s life. He was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in his home town of Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nThere are some stories that add appropriate twists to distinctive careers. Fats Waller was a master showman who loved his birthplace and stomping ground of Harlem. He specified that his ashes were to be strewn over Harlem from a plane, and his wish was granted after he died in 1943, with the plane piloted by an aviator known as “The Black Ace,” possibly the first African-American pilot in World War I, Eugene Bullard.\n\nPaul Desmond’s story provides a wry postscript for a man who loved subtle humor. It’s told by Paul Cerra in his Jazz Profiles blog: Desmond’s remains were cremated, and his friend, “Jimmy Lyons, the one-time San Francisco disc jockey and founder of the Monterey Jazz Festival, took the urn containing Paul’s ashes and a pitcher of martinis up in an airplane over the sea off the rugged coastal stretch known as Big Sur, which Paul loved. He opened the plane’s window to scatter the ashes and drink a last martini to Paul, and the wind blew both in his face. ‘Thanks a lot, Paul,’ Jimmy said, and laughed.”\n\nFor relatively recent jazz deaths, the memory may be too fresh or too painful for the musician’s survivors yet to consign their loved ones to history. For example, there are no records on line regarding the graves or cremations of Chick Corea (died 2021), Roy Hargrove (died 2018), Barry Harris (died 2021), Bobby Hutcherson (died 2016), Ahmad Jamal (died 2023), Steve Lacy (died 2004), Pharoah Sanders (died 2022) or Horace Silver (died 2014).\n\nIn some cases, the public record is simply silent. For example, I was unable to find any reference to the cremation or grave of pianist Tommy Flanagan, perhaps in keeping with a life as a consummate accompanist who rarely sought the spotlight for himself.\n\nThere also are glories. Louis Armstrong’s grave in Flushing NY is a site that sees many visitors. Miles Davis (“Sir Miles” on his tombstone, recognizing the honor given him by the government of France) has an honored place in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx near that of Duke Ellington, and many other lights have joined them nearby in what Woodlawn calls its “Jazz Corner.” Jackie McLean’s tombstone In Woodlawn captures his ebullience and fire. Sam Rivers’s stone, in Florida National Cemetery, Bushnell, FL, eloquently says “Jazz Icon” after his military service record. And the mutual love of trumpeter Art Farmer and his twin brother bassist Addison, who died suddenly in 1963, 35 years before his brother, is touchingly memorialized on their joint tombstone in Greenwood Memorial Lawn Cemetery in Phoenix: “Together forever.”\n\nCemeteries and gravestones are for the living, of course. But the sad truth is that if too much time passes after a person dies, they become a footnote or a question mark, and the living are the losers.\n\nWe jazzpeople should not allow this to happen to Bud Powell, or to any of those who continue to give us joy and enlightenment through their recordings. I, for one, am making a contribution to help Peter Pullman give Bud Powell the final honor he very much deserves.\n\nMore:\n\nThe campaign to move Bud Powell’s remains from the unmarked grave in Fairview Cemetery in Pennsylvania to the Jazz Corner of Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx with an appropriate headstone is being managed by Powell’s biographer Peter Pullman. Pullman has secured a location for the new grave at Woodlawn and has found an anonymous donor who will put $15,000 in matching funds towards the campaign. Pullman’s goal is to complete the reburial and the erection of the new headstone before September 27 of this year, which will be the 100th anniversary of Powell’s birth.\n\nPullman is partnering with a fiscal sponsor, FJC, to allow donors to make tax-deductible contributions. To date, the Bud Powell Centenary project has raised about two-thirds of its goal. Gifts are tax-deductible, and they may be doubled in value if the donor works for a company that participates in charitable fundraising efforts. More information can be found at the Bud Powell Centenary page on the non-profit website fjc.givingfuel.com\n\nBelow is an idiosyncratic list of jazzpeople who have inspired reverence, devotion, or passion from their fans, in an attempt to satisfy readers’ curiosity about where their graves might be visited. Each listing shows information about the person’s burial or cremation in so far as I have been able to find such information from on-line research. Additions to the list are (of course) welcome – please feel free to add a comment below if you have information to share.\n\n“Woodlawn” signifies burial in Woodlawn Cemetery, 4199 Webster Avenue, Bronx, NY.
