Cohen died on Monday, Feb. 8, at 98. (Amy Beth Bennett, Sun Sentinel) Jazz trumpeter and bandleader Pauly Cohen — a diminutive “force of nature” who shared the stage and offstage friendships with the likes of Charlie Parker, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie Gleason, Quincy Jones, Ava Gardner and Judy Garland — died at his home in Tamarac Monday night. Cohen was 98. Paul Cohen and I, Fredric J. Cohen, MD were born in the same house, he on October 3, 2022 and I December 10, 1942 . We shared the same father, WWI distinguished dough boy Master Sergeant Louis Cohen who lost several fingers from artillery barrages and was awarded the Purple Heart. He was hiding under a truck during this barrage and the oil pan was leaking into his eyes. He used his combat knife to stop the leak.The next day he was cited by the Scranton, PA Company D Captain for a Bronze Star for \"repairing a truck under shell fire, above and beyond the call of duty\" what a stretch. At age 8 Paul picked up the trumpet, I at age 4...our first teacher was our dad who was the company bugler as well as a Sharpshooter sniper. Paul Graduated Lincoln High School on Ocean Parkway Brooklyn in 1940. 3/12 Advertisement I graduated from the University of Louisville School of I had no idea that in 1970, after Medicine , on a trumpet and academic scholarship ,that as an intern rotating through Coney Island Hospital on Ocean Parkway, I was the third baseman in a softball game House staff vs. the Attending Staff. Well I had my greatest day in sports hitting two home runs over the hand ball courts, about 290 feet and made some lucky plays in the field. I drove in 9 runs and dedicated my MVP trophy to my Brother Paul. I never met Paul's mother because it was impossible! She died in 1941 and since the house was in two names, Dad had to have the deed changed. His lawyer was in the Empire State Building and the four lawyers shared one Legal Secretary, today called a paralegal. He dated this woman, Clara Ida Venetek and on the occasion of Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941, he proposed to this 26 year old became his fiancee. He was 52 years old, like a deck of cards, 26 and 52. They were married February 1, 1942 at the Twin Cantor's Synagogue on Eastern Parkway and Utica Avenue in Brooklyn, now a Crown Heights Church. Therefore we were brothers with the same father and a different mother, Paul was upset about this marraige due to the short mourning period and the young age of my mother. I bear no guilt because we can not choose our parents but dad tried to mend this estrangement between Paul and took me and my younger sister Francine Bauer (nee Cohen) as we attended dozens of Broadway Musicals where Paul was playing in the pit. He always took all four of us to Dinner at Sardi's We took a long time to bury the hatchet and eventually I got his hand me down trumpets and my dad got his old suits. Our dad was extremely proud of Paul's Musical pedigree as he matriculated at the Julliard School for the performing arts, then in Harlem and not at the present Lincoln Center locale. Paul joined the Count Basie band as the lead trumpet and arranged music for Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett for many years. I believe the Harlem milieu gave Paul the skills to fraternize with his African American colleagues. Time to toot my own horn. In Brooklyn Technical High School I played first trumpet in the dance band, orchestra and sports marching bands. I did not have Paul's chops, nobody did his range was an octave above high C but I was still a \"squeaker\". Pauly Cohen with his swing band performing at the Margate Center in 1990. My wife Anna and his wife Paula Cohen and our children Lori, Carson and Mikey attended. I was practicing plastic surgery in Palm Beach at the time. When we asked Paula how they met she said, \"My father was his agent, so instead of paying 10% he paid 50%\" Paul tapped the lectern with his conductor baton and strolled over to a saxophonist, he said\"\"I just wanted to make sure that we are playing the same music\". A while later He returned ans asked in a sarcastic tone, \"Is there any reqason you felt like getting up today and getting dressed and coming here For my music scholarship in medical school, I was required to perform in the Louisville Philharmonic, and I wore brown pants as I was third trumpet and still sucked. The Pep band traveled with the top ranked mens basketball team and one occasion we had a game vs. Syracuse at the Madison Square Garden in 1968. Dad was front row center and heard every note I played, he has that ear. Dating, cars and other personal items were earned by moonlighting. Above is my 'Chicago\" style band doing a gig at the Brown Hotel in downtown Louisville on Broadway..still there. 2/16/2021 Pauly Cohen obituary: Jazz trumpeter, bandleader dies at 98 - South Florida Sun-Sentinel https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/obituaries/fl-et-pauly-cohen-obituary-jazz-musician-covid-death-20210209-3pf7jyzqu5gg3fmihnzo53kgpy-story.html 8/12 “He felt a great responsibility in making sure he fit into the band, to carry on the spirit of that music,” Dr. Michael Petrie, a Chiropractor and friend recanted to me“There was such a history with the Basie band. You have to be aware of the history of that music.” I told Mike that when I was five years old I was placed in the Pride of Judea Children's Home that summered in Long Beach NY. There was a Cap Callaway benefit that I jumped up to the stage and told Cap that I was Pauly Cohen's Brother. He recognized the resemblance and I sat on the piano chair with him and had a snack with the band afterwards. In the midst of a USTA tennis tournament at Roosevelt Island in 1986, paul called me to get a urologist referral, itol him that, \" he was not at my brith but I sure will be there for your prostatectomy\". I can still hear him cracking up on the phone Cohen was not a jazz trumpet soloist on the order of Gillespie, Louis Armstrong or Miles Davis, but his skills in setting the tone for the musicality of a band as a lead trumpet player was widely respected. “As the lead trumpet player, he was playing the really hard, high parts all night, every night. [In that role] he was very exposed. You couldn’t hide his mistakes,” said Mike Ragan, himself a friend and trumpet player. “Within the pantheon of trumpet players who know that, pretty much everyone knows Pauly.” Cohen’s storytelling prowess was a result of having so many stories to tell from a life embedded in a unique corner of mid-20th century pop culture. Memories came easily, rich in detail and a generous spirit. This photographic memory and 170+ IQ put all the males in our family in the one in seven million range...really nuts too. We were known as raconteurs, story tellers and perhaps BS artists as well. Despite my office hours Thursday February 18th and the snow, I will be at his internment at Sharon Gardens Cemetery 273 Lakeview Avenue Valhalla NY 10595. I will wear a kippa, say some words to celebrate his life and tearfully play taps on HIS TRUMPET He witnessed Billie Holiday walk onstage at the Three Deuces on 52nd Street in the ’60s with schoolboy awe: “She wouldn’t move a muscle until the audience kept quiet. No clinking of glasses. You could hear a pin drop. She waited for the pin to drop. Then she started with ‘Strange Fruit,’ and the place went [gasp] … She could command you.” When Artie Shaw was his boss, Shaw’s girlfriend, Ava Gardner “was so beautiful…She was a woman who could make a man feel more like a man. That’s a talent. And she had it like nobody had it.” Cohen had an eight-week run with Sinatra in the mid-’60s at the Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, and recalled late-night basement chats: “I respected him tremendously. Always giving the credit to the musicians and arrangers. That was my kind of man.” 2/16/2021 Pauly Cohen obituary: Jazz trumpeter, bandleader dies at 98 - South Florida Sun-Sentinel https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/obituaries/fl-et-pauly-cohen-obituary-jazz-musician-covid-death-20210209-3pf7jyzqu5gg3fmihnzo53kgpy-story.html 9/12 He recalled leaping from the orchestra for an impromptu jitterbug with Judy Garland at the old Diplomat Hotel in Hollywood in 1966: “Every tune she did had a special meaning to her, that she wanted to give to the people. They did a lot of bad things to her out in Hollywood [Calif.] … I felt sorry for her. She was a great person.” When he turned 90, Cohen’s music and stories were captured by filmmaker Bret Primack in a documentary, “Taking Charge,” that would be shown the next year at the 2013 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival. The screening was part of a birthday celebration for Cohen that included a video message for “my brother Pauly” from Quincy Jones. “As Sinatra used to tell us every night, live every day like it’s your last and one day you’ll be right,” Jones said, with a small smile. “Happy birthday my brother. I’m gonna be right behind you. I love you.” The FLIFF screening included a performance by the Pauly Cohen Big Band before a packed house of 300 people at the Sunrise Civic Center Theater. Cohen introduced the concert with uncommon brevity: “I’m Pauly Cohen. I’m lucky to be here. Let’s play some music!” Staff writer Ben Crandell can be reached at bcrandell@sunsentinel.com."
