        "text": "Hawker Sea Fury TT Mk. 20 \"Deutsche Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst\"\n\nIPMS Deutschland Special Edition No.3\n\n1/72 scale\n\nReviewed by Volker Helms\n\nHyperScale is proudly supported by Squadron.com\n\nBackground\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury was the ultimate development in a long line of Hawker piston engined fighters, which began with the bi-plane Fury and was continued so successfully with the Hurricane, Typhoon and Tempest. The Fury came too late to be employed with the RAF, as the new jets had much more potential. But the Fleet Air Arm wanted to bridge the time until the jet aircraft become technically mature to meet their requirements. Thus the Fury became the Sea Fury.\n\nThe first Fury prototype took off on 1st September 1944 for first time and the first naval aircraft flew on 21 February 1945. In 1947 the first Sea Fury Mk. X were delivered to the FAA. Several Versions followed as the fighter-bomber FB.Mk. 11 and the trainer T.Mk. 20, which was built in 61 copies. For Iraq and Pakistan the T.Mk. 61 was developed. Altogether Iraq and Pakistan are believed to have received five machines each. The last Sea Fury's delivered by Hawker went to Germany as target tugs.\n\nThe first supply consisted of 10 TT Mk. 20. Later some more Sea Furies Mk..20 and a FB Mk.11 were delivered. Altogether there were max. 16 two seater, which were operated by \"Deutscher Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst (German aviation advisory service). The TT Mk.20 received a winch and the drive with propeller on the starboard side. These red airplanes were stationed in Luebeck. The last copies were sold 1974. The Air Force museum in Uetersen received the only FB Mk. 11. This was exchanged later for the Fieseler Storch, which is now exhibited in Gatow.\n\nFor those interested in some photos and more background information I recommend the site of Thomas Genth: http://www.thomasgenth.de/SeafuryD/indexeng.html (English  click images for a larger view).\n\nFirstLook\n\nIn spring 2006 Special Hobby issued a Sea Fury Mk. 61, on which this model is based.\n\nFor this IPMS Deutschland Special Edition Hawker Sea Fury TT.Mk. 20, Special Hobby designed new resin and etched parts and some new vacu canopies for the Mk. 20.\n\nClick the thumbnails below to view larger images:\n\nUnfortunately they could not provide the FB Mk. 11 canopies in time so you will have to make them on your own, or just build the Mk.20 (maybe they arrive later?). So you have some fodder for the spare parts box.\n\nThe decals are from DEAD Design and allow the following markings:\n\nl Hawker Sea Fury TT.Mk. 20, D-CAMI (only one version)\n\nl Hawker Sea Fury TT.Mk. 20, D-COTE (two shemes)\n\nl Hawker Sea Fury TT.Mk. 20, D-CATA (two shemes)\n\nl Hawker Sea Fury TT.Mk. 20, D-CABY (only one version)\n\nConclusion\n\nAnybody interested in German Air Force history should take the opportunity to get this Sea Fury edition. The IPMS Special Edition is limited to 150 kits and can be ordered for 17 Euro (13,50 for IPMS Deutschland members) +p&p via info@ipmsdeutschland.de (also if you have further questions)\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nThanks to MPM/Special Hobby for the review sample.\n\nReview Copyright © 2006 by Volker Helms\n\nPage Created 04 October, 2006\n\nLast updated 21 February, 2007\n\nBack to HyperScale Main Page"
