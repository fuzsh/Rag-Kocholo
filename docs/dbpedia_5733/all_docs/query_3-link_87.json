        "text": "The phrase is part of what is known as “Ariel’s Song” in the play. Since Shakespeare coined the phrase, it has appeared in numerous other novels, short stories, songs, and films. This is due to the mood the line evokes—one of mystery and fear. The poet’s use of alliteration and allusion in the single line of text also makes it hard to forget.\n\nMeaning of “Full fathom five thy father lies”\n\nThe phrase is used in “Ariel’s Song” and is about Ferdinand’s father, Alonso, the King of Naples. It refers to the depths at which Ferdinand’s father’s ship is wrecked. It is lying at the bottom of the ocean, thirty feet below the surface, or at least that’s what Ferdinand interprets from the song.\n\nAt the beginning of the play, Ferdinand has washed ashore on Prospero’s island and falls in love with Prospero’s daughter, Miranda. Prospero wants to imprison the young man, but his daughter pleads with him not to as she has immediately fallen in love with him.\n\nImportant Vocabulary to Know\n\nFathom: a unit of measurement— around six feet or 1.8 meters. It is used in reference to the depth of water. In the quote, the spirit Ariel is referencing “five” fathoms, or 30 feet of water.\n\nWhere Does Shakespeare Use “Full fathom five thy father lies?”\n\nThis famous quote is from The Tempest. In Act I, Scene 2, and is spoken by Ariel, a spirit who lives on the island with Prospero and Miranda. Ariel owes a debt to Prospero, who freed him from a tree when the latter arrived on the island. He became his servant after previously serving a witch—Sycorax. Ariel sings the line in verse passage of the play. Here is the quote in context:\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n\nOf his bones are coral made;\n\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n\nNothing of him that doth fade\n\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\n\nInto something rich and strange.\n\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell\n\nHark! Now I hear them – Ding-dong, bell.\n\nAriel sings these lines to Ferdinand and he replies with:\n\nThe ditty does remember my drown’d father.\n\nThis is no mortal business, nor no sound\n\nThat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.\n\nFerdinand does not understand where the words are coming from. He refers to them as “no mortal business, nor sound.” They are not part of what the “earth owes.” He hears the sound “now above” him. This is not the only time throughout the play that Ariel is described incorporeally. He is a spirit and is not always visible to the characters.\n\nInterestingly, while the quote is most commonly included in the above passage, the song actually begins a few lines earlier with these less-commonly quoted lines:\n\nCome unto these yellow sands,\n\nAnd then take hands.\n\nCurtsied when you have, and kissed\n\nThe wild waves whist.\n\nFoot it featly here and there,\n\nAnd sweet sprites bear\n\nThe burden. Hark, hark!\n\nBurden dispersedly, within: Bow-wow.\n\nThe watchdogs bark.\n\nBurden dispersedly, within: Bow-wow.\n\nHark, hark! I hear\n\nThe strain of strutting chanticleer\n\nCry cock-a-diddle-dow.\n\nFerdinand’s response to these lines is just as baffled. He says:\n\nWhere should this music be? I’ th’ air, or th’ earth?\n\nIt sounds no more; and sure it waits upon\n\nSome god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,\n\nWeeping again the King my father’s wrack,\n\nThis music crept by me upon the waters,\n\nAllaying both their fury and my passion\n\nWith its sweet air. Thence I have followed it,\n\nOr it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.\n\nNo, it begins again.\n\nIt’s clear in these lines that Ferdinand is still dealing with the aftermath of his father’s death. He attributes the song to a god of the island who is mourning the kings’ death by drowning as he is. It’s easy to hear his sorrow in the lines.\n\nWhy Did Shakespeare Use “Full fathom five thy father lies?”\n\nShakespeare used this line as part of “Ariel Song” in The Tempest. It uses a few different literary devices that have made it as well-known today as it is. Most importantly, the use of alliteration. The quote includes four words that start with the letter “f.” This makes the line very pleasing to hear read aloud and to read to oneself. It also makes the line quite easy to remember. (This is a feature of most of Shakespeare’s best-known quotations.)\n\nSince Ariel is singing, as he does throughout much of the play, it makes sense that Shakespeare uses this highly lyrical language. There is also an element of mystery to this line due to the use of the archaic word (or at least rarely used word) “fathom.” It suggests that something terrible has happened to this father figure, but without context, one might not understand entirely what that “terrible” thing is.\n\nWhat’s especially interesting about this quote is that when it’s delivered, Alonso isn’t dead. Ariel suggests that he is, but it’s later revealed that the King of Naples is alive and searching for his son. It’s Ferdinand who is actually believed dead by more people. His father is very relieved to find his son alive on the island.\n\nFAQs\n\nOther Resources"
