        "text": "Britain's great cinematic translator of the modern queer experience, Andrew Haigh (Weekend, 45 Years, the TV show Longing) returns with a Rizla-paper-delicate rumination on gay loneliness, love, and how grief lingers like a spectre in the corner of the room.\n\nIt's part ghost story, part nocturnal romance, part late-stage coming-of-ager. Andrew Scott stars as Adam, a depressed screenwriter working on a new script inspired by the death of his parents. For research, he visits his childhood home on the outskirts of London, only to find his mum and dad — Claire Foy and Jamie Bell, respectively — are seemingly alive and well, looking exactly as they did thirty years ago. Meanwhile, a steamy tryst blossoms with a stranger (Paul Mescal) in Adam's empty apartment complex.\n\nIt's stirring, and achingly felt. One of those movies to not see with your dad (or anyone else who you're embarrassed to watch unflinching gay sex scenes with, or endlessly cry in front of). And it's sure to stand as one of the best of the year. You can watch All of Us Strangers on Disney+.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\n2 February\n\nThe Zone of Interest is only the British auteur's fourth film in his 23-year-long, eclectic directorial career (he also made 2000's Sexy Beast, 2004's Birth and ScarJo's thrilling 2013 sex-alien-murderer movie, Under the Skin.) It's also, arguably, his best, if “best” is the appropriate adjective for a holocaust movie that terrifies you into a hypnotised tremor with its pounding sound design and haunting visuals. And we rarely see inside the camp: loosely based on Martin Amis' novel of the same name, The Zone of Interest tells the story of the Nazi genocide from the perspective of the camp commandant — and his doting family — who live next door. You'll never want to watch it again. You can watch The Zone of Interest on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Iron Claw\n\n9 February\n\nPaul Mescal takes the combat pit in place of Russell Crowe, whose Maximus Decimus Meridius took his revenge and subsequently died in the first one. Barry Keoghan was attached at one point, but was replaced by The White Lotus' Fred Hechinger. The cast also includes screen legend Denzel Washington, Hollywood's favourite character actor Djimon Hounsou, internet daddy Pedro Pascal, Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn and bona fide British stage royalty Derek Jacobi.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King\n\n20 December\n\nWe'd usually have absolutely zero interest in another “live-action” Disney remake, but Mufasa: The Lion King has our interest for one reason — and one reason only. That's Barry Jenkins, the indie filmmaker who rose to fame after Moonlight won Best Picture at the Oscars ahead of Damien Chazelle's La La Land. You'll remember the cock up with the announcement.\n\nHis movies are brilliant, and this is the first one he has directed in over five years, after a brief detour to television with Prime Video's The Underground Railroad. Who cares if it's a live-action sequel to The Lion King that no one really asked for? (We say that, but 2019's The Lion King made over 1.6 billion quid at the global box office, so maybe we know about as much as the flies buzzing around a pile of warthog dung.)\n\n2024 US Release Confirmed, UK TBC:\n\nNightbitch\n\n6 December in the US, with a UK release date to be confirmed\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood's Marielle Heller is set to shift tonal gears for Nightbitch, working in a genre mode that the filmmaker — whose movies have been on the sentimental side — has yet to demonstrate. Promotional materials describe it as a comedy horror with Amy Adams in the lead role, who is joined by Scoot McNairy, Zoë Chao, Mary Holland, Ella Thomas and Jessica Harper. The official logline reveals little: “A woman pauses her career to be a stay-at-home mom, but soon her domesticity takes a surreal turn.” A scary, off-kilter psychodrama, then? Sign us up, bitch!\n\n2024 TBC:\n\nQueer\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino has already had a hell of a year with the success of tennis sex drama Challengers, and now he turns his attention to veritable Oscar fare — with a post-Bond Daniel Craig as his latest muse. Queer adapts the 1985 period novel of the same name by William S. Burroughs, which follows an American expat (Craig) in post-war Mexico City who falls in love with a much younger man (Drew Starkey, who you might know from the Netflix teen drama Outer Banks, especially if you're Gen Z). The movie has Daniel Craig Oscar Run etched all over it, really. Other cast members include Phantom Thread's Lesley Manville, Wes Anderson fave Jason Schwartzman and pop musician Omar Apollo.\n\nBird\n\nBarry Keoghan's next big move after nakedly strutting his stuff in the halls of a dusty manor house? Decidedly more downbeat, if the previous works of its director Andrea Arnold are anything to go by. (Her last movie, Cow, was a documentary about — you guessed it — a cow.) This one sees Keoghan play off against German indie superstar Franz Rogowski, known to MUBI-tote flashing BFI-goers as the bicurious fuckboy who broke Paddington's heart in 2023's Passages.\n\nOh, Canada\n\nRichard Gere returns to the arms of his American Gigolo director Paul Schrader in Oh, Canada, which sees him play a tormented writer on the brink of death; Jacob Elordi subs in for Gere in flashback scenes. Uma Thurman is also set to star, as will Michael Imperioli, hot off the heels of his White Lotus-inspired screen renaissance.\n\nMaria\n\nLook, we can't pretend to be intimately familiar with the life story of Maria Callas; having died in the late ‘70s, she was a bit before our time. But a brief scan of her Wikipedia entry gives up the goods as to why she has piqued the interest of Pablo Larraín, director of Princess Di psychological horror Spencer and Jackie O biopic Jackie. Considered one of the greatest opera singers of all time, her life was beset by tragedy, scrutiny in the press… and she had an affair with Aristotle Onassis, ie. the guy who would later shack up with the former first lady. Perhaps this is the next step towards a Pablo Larraín cinematic universe? Will Natalie Portman appear in a brief post-credits cameo? The cherry on the icing on the cake: Angelina Jolie stars as the eponymous soprano, with film awards nerds tipping her for an Oscars renaissance.\n\nEmilia Perez\n\n“Mexican cartel trans musical” might sound like a harebrained marketing pitch thought up by Don Draper's evil twin, but it's really a movie, folks! From this unlikeliest of genre-bending premises the French filmmaker Jacques Audiard has cooked up a seeming winner with Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez and Karla Sofia Gascón, such is why Emilia Perez was the talk of the Cannes Film Festival where it was bought by cult film distributor A24 for a mega $12 million. Expect it to be in and around the film awards conversation when it (probably) arrives later in the year; in Audiard's native France, it's pegged for release on 28 August.\n\nThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\n\nThis nigh-on three-hour epic debuted at Cannes to rave reviews, taking home a special prize from the competition jury headed by Greta Gerwig. More noteworthy is the political context in which it was made, as director Mohammad Rasoulof was effectively exiled from his home country of Iran soon after the film was announced, charged with defying the state's strict censorship rules. As to its premise, The Seed of the Sacred Fig centres on a good-hearted lawyer shuffled to the top of the Revolutionary Court, where he is called on to approve executions sight-unseen. Now why would that provoke antagonism from the regime?\n\nAll We Imagine As Light\n\nIn a crowded pack of directors of such legendary prestige as Videodrome's David Cronenberg, The Godfather's Francis Ford Coppola and Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader, it was an unknown Indian woman filmmaker who seized the day in the Cannes Film Festival competition. Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, described as the “absorbing story of three nurses that is full of humanity” by The Guardian's chief film critic, won heaps of acclaim — and the second-highest prize on offer, which usually goes to the cinephiles' fave — at the fest, which it'll surely ride through to a hefty crop of awards at the Oscars et al next year. In the meantime, you'll likely be able to watch it by the end of 2024, though dates for the cinemas are yet to be set in stone.\n\nFind all of the most anticipated TV shows of 2024 here."
