        "text": "Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘Aloha’ (PG-13, 1:45) Cameron Crowe’s latest film, set among military officers and contractors in Hawaii, is a mess. A romantic comedy (starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone) trips over a bittersweet breakup drama (starring Mr. Cooper and Rachel McAdams) and collides with a dizzy satire about corporate power and the weaponization of space. But amid the frustration and confusion, there are sparks of Mr. Crowe’s wit and humanity, and moments of sweetness and delight. (A. O. Scott)\n\n‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ (PG-13, 2:21) For Marvel agnostics, the single most interesting thing about this sequel is that you can sense that the director, Joss Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first “Avengers,” has struggled mightily to invest this one with some life. He has and he hasn’t. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n‘Chagall-Malevich’ (No rating, 1:57) Set primarily during the Russian Revolution and aftermath, Alexander Mitta’s literally colorful film centers on the painter Marc Chagall and fictionalizes his real-life efforts to establish an artistic bulwark amid ideological ferment. There are fervid ideals aplenty courtesy of Chagall and his contemporary, Kazimir Malevich, but the movie’s also written about as subtly as a radical manifesto. (Nicolas Rapold)\n\n‘Entourage’ (R, 1:44) Naw, bro. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘Ex Machina’ (R, 1:50) Alex Garland’s slyly spooky futuristic shocker about old and new desires turns on the relationships that bind together a robot called Ava; (a terrific Alicia Vikander), the software zillionaire who created her (Oscar Isaac, wonderful); and a visitor (Domhnall Gleeson) who’s seriously out of his depth. (Dargis)\n\n‘Far From the Madding Crowd’ (PG-13, 2:00) In this brisk adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s novel, Carey Mulligan plays Bathsheba Everdene, whose efforts to manage the farm she has inherited are interrupted by the attention of three very different suitors: her stodgy neighbor (Michael Sheen), a dissolute soldier (Tom Sturridge) and a salt-of-the-earth shepherd (Matthias Schoenaerts).
