        "text": "Please be advised: Niagara’s Fury is set to cease operations with its last day being Labour Day, September 2, 2024. Ticket substitutions will be available for pass holders.\n\nDiscover the Ancient Story of Niagara Falls\n\nThe Niagara Peninsula became free of ice from the last Ice Age about 12,500 years ago. As the ice retreated northward, its melt waters began to flow down through what became Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Niagara Falls was originally located at the escarpment at Queenston-Lewiston and continued to steadily erode through the bedrock to its current location over the next 10,000 years.\n\nBefore 1950, the falls receded an estimated three to four feet per year. The Niagara River Water Diversion Treaty between Canada and the United States was established in 1950 to slow the erosion of the falls by limiting the amount of water that could be diverted from the Niagara River for industrial and power generating purposes. The treaty helped slow erosion of the falls to an estimated 30 centimetres (1 foot) every 10 years."
