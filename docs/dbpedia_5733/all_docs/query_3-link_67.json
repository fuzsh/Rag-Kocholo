        "text": "William Shakespeare, one of history’s best-known writers, authored dozens of plays and hundreds of poems, and originated words such as “gossip,” “dauntless,” and “negotiate” which are still part of our vocabulary today. His works have inspired novels such asVinegar Girl by Anne Tyler (DB 84781) and A Thousand Acres by Jean Smiley (DB 33926); movies including The Lion King (DVD 1881), She’s the Man and 10 Things I Hate About You; and musicals like West Side Story and Kiss Me, Kate, alongside the thousands of adaptations and interpretations of his original plays. But it is not only the stories themselves that have influenced later writers. This month’s list features books titled after quotes from the works of Shakespeare, words and phrases which have made their way into the names of books ranging from mystery to romance to science fiction. Even if you skimmed over Shakespeare in school, you might find that there’s something to enjoy inspired by his words.\n\nDigital book (DB), braille (BR), large print (LT), and audio described videos (DVD) copies of these titles are available from the Perkins Library or the Worcester Talking Book Library. Please contact the library to order any of these books.\n\nPrepared by Leah Ellenbogen\n\nChildren’s Resource and Service Librarian, Perkins Library"
