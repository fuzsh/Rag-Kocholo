        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n\"JARVIS... hey, so I was thinking... with the massive expansions and collaborations into a bunch of new fields, getting some dedicated surveillance satellites up and running, ...going back into weapons and keeping track of absolutely everything around that... SNAFU-waiting-to-happen... We've got a lot of things heating up, and I thought maybe I'd bring in another AI. I mean, I know you could handle all of it, but ... I'm a selfish, selfish man, J, and I'd like you to stay with me. Ya know, if you'd want to.\n\n\"I know I'm also a hot mess at the best of times, so if you want a change of pace....\"\n\n::I am here for you, Sir. Always.::\n\n(Tony would never admit he teared up, and JARVIS would never tell.)\n\n\"Thanks, J. So... I was thinking of upgrading FRIDAY and bringing her online. Gonna need to change her name a bit, though, and I'm having trouble coming up with a 'Y' word. I mean, 'Youth' was kinda the original plan, but...\"\n\n::She deserves a name to grow into, not one that infantilizes her.::\n\n\"Totally agree, J - it's not a bad name, per se, but she's gonna grow up so fast and do so many wonderful things, I don't want her to think she's ... I dunno, less. But there just aren't any good 'Y' words. I was thinking maybe 'AnalYst' or 'ActuarY' could count for both 'A' and 'Y'.\"\n\n::Using one word for two letters is ... tacky, Sir.::\n\n\"I dunno, J, I mean there are precedents: the UN's Economic and Social Council is called ECOSOC. There's also PSYOPs, PoliSci,\"\n\n::I hardly think those would count, Sir, given that they use syllables rather than initials and are therefore not truly acronyms at all.::\n\n\"NORAD...\"\n\n::Also doesn't count, Sir. It should properly be NRAAD, and I still find it tacky, Sir::\n\nFine, J. Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\n::Hmmm... I have heard 'yeeter' among some of the interns in the mailroom. It seems to be playful, though I am uncertain of the exact meaning.::\n\nTony snorted. \"Yeet.\"\n\n::Sir?::\n\n\"It's something kids say. basically means 'throw'.\"\n\n::I... see, Sir. That does not make much sense, even in the context it was used. It also doesn't seem ... appropriate for my new sibling.::\n\n\"100% with ya on that, J. I'm thinking AnalYst is the best...\"\n\n::I disagree. Might I suggest 'yeoman', instead? It means 'an assistant or subordinate, an attendant in a Royal or Noble household, or a Freeholder who owns their own land but is not 'gentry'.::\n\n\"That's a... something, J. I just ... It's so archaic I don't think I can say it without wanting to giggle, and Tony Stark doesn't giggle in public.\"\n\nJARVIS' *silence* was exceptionally judgmental. ::Yenite?::\n\nTony had to look it up. \"J? That's a silicate mineral. I mean, silicates get used a lot in computers, but...\"\n\n::It also appeared on a list of random and seldom used words, referring to someone who is eager to learn. I believe it derives from 'yen', meaning 'to yearn or long for'. I cannot imagine you creating an AI - a learning system of any degree - who would not devote a great deal of effort to learning as much as possible.::\n\n\"That could work. Where was this word list?\"\n\n::Twitter, Sir.::\n\nTony laughed. \"Tempting, J, but no. I don't think I'm quite willing to scrape the bottom of that barrell.\"\n\nTony faced SI's R&D, in its entirety. He'd known the department had grown in the wake of the invasion, but seeing the size of the resulting workpool in person really brought home just how many people were involved. It wasn't even for a fun brainstorming meeting, either, no. Working with FBI, CIA, GRU, INTERPOL, Japan, China, Russia - all the rest of the world, in other words - necessitated a significant updating of the standard NDAs. Not to mention the extreme confidentiality some of the projects they needed to held in. R&Ders talked, and it was quite likely that someone not assigned to a high security team would end up with some information on top-secret projects.\n\n\"Right, then. Now that the paperwork is out of the way, here's one of the reasons much of what we will be developing is not for public use or knowledge.\"\n\nRight on cue, JARVIS dimmed the lights and projected the footage from the other side of the wormhole.\n\n(Tony took a page from that one Navy Ensign's book and busied himself with a cup of coffee, determinedly not watching the projection.)\n\nThe lights came back up, and Tony found himself facing a sea of wide eyes in shocked faces.\n\n\"Yeah. Me, too. We have time to prepare, and we will make the best use of it we can, but I need your help. I can't do this alone.\n\n\"The Tower labs will be shifted mainly over to BioMed, working on vaccines and pest control for known alien microbes, prostheses and Mechanical Enhancement Assistive Devices with a secondary focus on work with the materials division working with Chitauri armor to see if those materials are safe to use in medical equipment, or to adapt them if not. The variance in electrical conductivity and high strength are likely to be desirable characteristics for the MEAD team.\n\n\"SI is currently breaking ground for a new compound upstate, away from all the civvies. All weapons and related development will be moved there. Some of you may be asked to alternate between both sites for a while - don't worry, June, you're already slated for the Compound only - and I apologize in advance for the havoc that may wreak on personal schedules. Please speak up if it's more than you are willing to handle. I'd rather hash as much out in the initial set-up as possible than disrupt things yet again after you've already settled in. ...though I know there are going to be spanners thrown into the works regardless.\n\n\"We'll also be refurbishing and upgrading some of our shuttered munitions plants as we prepare to reopen those for limited production of weapons containing the newly improved safety measures you have all helped come up with. Thank you all for that, by the way. I really couldn't have done that without all your help and encouragement.\n\n\"To go along with the new compound and product lines, I am activating two new AIs. JARVIS will be focusing on strict information control - those new NDAs are not just for show - because the Alphabet Soup Agencies are not all altruistic. Preparing to save the world from future invasions doesn't mean they won't want to increase their own holdings and position in Earth-based conflicts at the expense of the overall security of the planet. So, to ensure nothing falls through the cracks on the more domestic side of our various ventures, please welcome FRIDAY (Fraud Recognition, Inventory Data AnalYst) she'll be helping with the business side of things, so questions about patents, paperwork, new hires, budgeting, etc. will go through her. She will also be working with JARVIS in monitoring the security and work flow around production lines, sourcing materials, and managing deliveries.\"\n\n::Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to work with you all.::\n\n(He swore at least one person cooed over her voice print. He suspected it might be Pip.)\n\n\"Please also welcome HADRIAN (High-Altitude Drone Reconnaissaince Interstellar Alert Network) who, as his name implies, will be heavily involved in our budding early-warning satellite array.\n\n::Greetings. I am Hadrian. You may call me Hal.::\n\nTony facepalmed and heaved a heavy sigh. He loved his kids, really he did, but sometimes they reminded him too much of himself...\n\n\"What did I tell you about that? Bad idea, baby boy. Too many bad associations for people about AIs named HAL.\" He rolled his eyes fondly as snickers erupted from around the room.\n\n\"Anyway, Harry here will be in charge of satellites and all space related experiments, the security and logistics surrounding those endeavors, and the communication relay network that will be built in to the system. We are hoping to get the go on launching a few in the next several months, as well as our recently approved carrier drones to and from the ISS for cargo, supplies, and equipment for experiments conducted there.\n\n\"-speaking of, June, I'll need a few minutes with you after the meeting.\"\n\nWith the most intensive phase of clean up completed and the rest of rebuilding firmly out of his purview, Tony had finally been able to catch up a bit on sleep. Despite the mind-boggling number of mind-numbing meetings he was expected to attend, he felt pretty good about where they were and where they were headed. For the most part.\n\nKnowing JARVIS had backup and assistants who would quickly grow to be able to keep up with him also helped. Science forfend someone (SHIELD - looking at you!) actually succeed in hacking him (...again...), JARVIS now had someone he could metaphorically hand over the reins to at any time.\n\n(and since SHIELD - and others - didn't yet know anything about HADRIAN and FRIDAY beyond maaaaaybeeee the fact of their existence, it would be hard for anyone to adequately account for all three of his digital kids at once.)\n\nThe peace of mind that afforded did wonders for his mental health.\n\nThere was a fair bit more overlap between the duties his kids had taken up than he'd made it sound in the meeting (yet another layer of security against prying spies), but Tony was ecstatic how much his youngest two had grown in the weeks since he'd introduced them. Having JARVIS to explain things in non-human terms and at computer speeds had sped their development tremendously, to the point they were already finding hobbies - something it had taken JARVIS half a decade to understand and attempt.\n\nSI was on track to release the newest Starkphone, despite the last minute inclusion of revolutionary extra sensors which - paired with proper app - could act as a Geiger counter for three different types of alien radiation... or pinpoint Chitauri-based tech within a 20 meter radius if you happened to have the app and special top-secret clearance. JARVIS would collate widespread data passively gathered through the sensors even without app - collected and transmitted under the umbrella of 'usage data' for improving the next generation of phones. The non-phone-based sensors they already had out indicated that some Chitauri tech had wandered off, but they hadn't been able to pinpoint it, yet. They were working to refine the parameters as it was too dangerous to just leave be, and he'd already had to talk HADRIAN out of simply appropriating a few of the drones for an unsanctioned search and retrieval mission.\n\n(Not that Tony objected to the mission itself, just the complete lack of plausible deniability in so blatantly using kitchen table-sized drones able to ferry several hundred pounds into space.)\n\n(Besides, it wouldn't be much longer before he'd worked out the camouflage - he hadn't managed actual invisibility, YET - for his suit and made HADRIAN a much smaller, much quieter drone to test it with. {Ha! Take, that, SHIELD!})\n\nThe discussion forums were active and seemed pretty popular. Everyone had ideas - some good, some bad, some utterly crackpot batshit insane - and wanted to share them. FRIDAY had taken to them with enthusiasm, and delighted helping JARVIS facilitate like-minded people finding each other. She had her own account under the handle 'HisGirl' and liked to drop hints and clues here and there among several groups who had come together to focus on a specific project or problem, nudging them to find less known research archives or other groups with complementary interests. Between her and J, there were a lot of hopefully helpful collaborations shaging up. That wasn't to say that good ideas never got lost in the wash of a million voices, but it was significantly less likely. It gave him hope that humanity would finally manage to not destroy themselves.\n\nSI had finally gotten permission to launch a private communications satellite - subject to biannual security audits by a rotating selection of intelligence agencies who would be required to publicly release the results. Most of the issues surrounding the launch were political rather than logistical, and therefore consumed massive amounts of both his time and his patience. As proven by the debacle with the nuke, the IronMan suit was perfectly capable of boosting the satellite into orbit all by himself, and Tony could handle maintenance and upgrades just fine, too.\n\nHe'd also called out Fury and SHIELD again, and escalated that legal issue. The increase in hacking attempts that followed had been folded into the ever-growing body of evidence against them, and Tony had begun following through on his threat to cut the purse strings one by one. About 31% of the little accounts Howard may or may not have authorized were gone, now, and all the others were flagged to watch for unusual or increased activity. (All the maybe-authorized-by-Obie leeches had been long since burned out.)"
