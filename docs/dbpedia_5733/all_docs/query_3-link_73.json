        "text": "26. Flame And Citron/Flammen & Citronen (2008, Denmark)\n\nd. Ole Christian Madsen\n\nLove, loss, and betrayal are all covered in this World War II thriller about the little known Danish resistance to the Nazis. It tells the story of two of their most infamous operatives, Bent Faurschou Hviid (known as Flammen) and Jørgen Haagen Schmith (known as Citron), played by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen respectively. Slowly but surely the two up the ante by killing Germans as well as Danish collaborators, thereby inevitably bringing more attention and reprisals to not only them, but potentially their family.\n\nDespite them being up against Nazis, the film never seeks to make Flammen and Citroon clear-cut heroes, instead exposing the morally murky world they operate in. It all builds to a truly thrilling climax, where the cost of war must be paid.\n\n25. TimeCrimes/Los Cronocrímenes (2007, Spain)\n\nd. Nacho Vigalondo\n\nA thriller which uses a sci-fi construct to get to the heart of the action, rather than a sci-fi film which has thriller elements to the plot, TimeCrimes remains one of my favorite films of the last 10 years. Taught and twisty, TimeCrimes is about a middle-aged man named Hector who has one hell of a day. Peering through binoculars at home, he spies a topless young woman. Going to investigate, he discovers her dead, and himself chased by a terrifying man with a head wrapped in bandages. Running away, he finds his way to a laboratory and is told to hide in a vat of gooey liquid by a scientist. Cue time travel shenanigans with multiple Hector’s soon popping up all over the place.\n\nIt doesn’t make too much sense under careful scrutiny, but the film is just done so well, a terrifying bandaged wrapped villain to haunt your dreams, a conclusion you know is fated to happen but will have you screaming at the screen to try and stop it, and all shot through with streak of black humour.\n\n24. The Tunnel/Der Tunnel (2001, Germany)\n\nd. Roland Suso Richter\n\nA superbly crafted suspense thriller, The Tunnel is set in East Germany in 1962, not long after the Berlin Wall has gone up. It’s tells the story of a group of young East Germans who build a tunnel in order to rescue their families from the GDR. Originally made for TV, and only released theatrically with English-Language subtitles in 2005, The Tunnel plays out as a tense and compelling finely matched game of chess. The players are the tunnellers and the GDR, each trying to outwit the other, and both aware of just what the other is trying to do.\n\nAlso, never has actually digging a tunnel been so well realised on film – the literal mud, sweat, and tears are all on display here.\n\n23. Battle Royale/Batoru Rowaiaru (2000, Japan)\n\nd. Kinji Fukasaku\n\nLong before The Hunger Games, there was Battle Royale. Due to a future government law, a class full of children are taken to an island, and told they have three days to fight to the death. Only one winner can survive. Sound familiar?\n\nBattle Royale was a hugely controversial film when it was released, but beyond the hype lies a very clever comment on youth violence outrages, as well as a treatise on the morality of teamwork and determination. Plus of course a huge helping of Fukasaku’s brand of violent mayhem. A superb final film from the master.\n\n22. A Hijacking/Kapringen (2012, Denmark)\n\nd. Tobias Lindholm\n\nSadly less well known than the similar Captain Phillips, A Hijacking is a mesmerising, sweaty-palmed tale of a ship hijacked at high seas, and the efforts to get it back.\n\nAs you would expect from one of the main creative forces behind the brilliant Danish political drama Borgen, writer and director Lindholm has created a smarter than average thriller which remembers to ask questions and explore the moral grey area amongst all the the action beats – the sequence where both kidnappers and prisoners celebrate at catching a fish is excellent. Borgen alumni Philip Asbæk and Søren Malling turn in excellent leading performances as the captured ship’s cook and the embattled CEO trying to get them released on the cheap.\n\n21. Lust, Caution (2007, Taiwan)\n\nd. Ang Lee\n\nAng Lee’s superb follow-up to Brokeback Mountain, Lust, Cautionlays claim to being perhaps his finest work. Set during the Japanese occupation of China during World War II, and located between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the film is a masterclass in obsession, betrayal, and what you are willing to do for your beliefs.\n\nAs I have said before on this very site, ‘watching it made my chest feel uncomfortably tight at times, and in Tony Leung’s masterful performance as Mr Yee, a high-ranking collaborator, you have what may be one of the most complex and nuanced villains in cinema history’. Lust, Caution is a gorgeously shot, highly sexualised examination of the nature of revenge and the motivations behind it.\n\n20. Wild Tales/Relatos Salvajes (2014, Argentina/Spain)\n\nd. Damian Szifron\n\nNow for something completely different… An anthology film of six different stories, Wild Tales combines black comedy, drama, and thriller into one excellent package. Each story is driven by a desire for revenge, with overarching message being you never know what you’re going to get when you embark down the path of vengeance.\n\nMixing mundanity with Bond level villainy, the film works hard to get the audience onside, while at the same time gleefully and anarchically getting out of control. From a bride who suspects her husband has been cheating, to a man outraged over his car being towed, the stories all weave their own brutal and brilliant magic.\n\n19. The Beat That My Heart Skipped/De Battre Mon Cœur S’est Arrêté (2005, France)\n\nd. Jacques Audiard\n\nA rare example of a Hollywood film being remade outside of Bollywood, this French gangland thriller is both uncompromising and tender, perfectly reflecting the lead character of Tom, played with genuine on-screen magnetism by Romain Duris. By day Tom and his gang buy and bribe their way into acquiring freeholds, intimidate and brutalise the residents into leaving, and then sell on at a profit. By night however, he yearns to become a concert pianist, following in the footsteps of his creative mother.\n\nTorn between the demands of his violent father and his artistic dreams, The Beat That My Heart Skipped prepares and lights a powder keg for the viewer.\n\n18. The Raid 2: Berandal (2014, Indonesia)\n\nd. Gareth Evans\n\nThe first Raid was a true classic in the action genre, with balletic scenes having audiences applauding in their seats. So very wisely, director Gareth Jones decided to try and not repeat himself again, instead going back to a prior script he had written, and expanding the world of The Raid into a magnificent crime thriller epic.\n\nThat’s not to say the action is any way lacking, it’s every bit as superb if not more than the original, it’s just that the focus is much wider here, with events building to a deafening crescendo as Rama goes undercover to bring down the criminal syndicate responsible for all the violence, death and corruption he is forced to endure.\n\n17. Amores Perros (2000, Mexico)\n\nd. Alejandro González Iñárritu\n\nThree short stories, each connected by a car accident in Mexico City. Octavio Y Susana features Gael Garcia Bernal as a man in love with his brother’s wife, and whose desire to get money to make a new life with her results in him entering the murky world of dog-fighting, with disastrous consequences. Daniel Y Valeria follows a model injured in the crash, and the effect this has on her previously middle-class and easy life, while El Y Maru focuses on a hitman who has been hiding in plain sight as a homeless man during the previous two parts.\n\nDue to the short nature of each story, each segment is a tightly focused narrative, dealing with class war, violence, revenge, loss, and love. Satisfying individually, taken as a whole the stories come together to create a thrilling depiction of life on the edge.\n\n16. I Saw The Devil/Angmareul Boatda (2010, South Korea)\n\nd. Kim Jee-woon\n\nI’m a huge fan of this revenge thriller, and have written about it before here on Den Of Geek. While there’s always something new to say about films (a few on this list have featured before) I think my previous description genuinely and honestly sums up just why it earns a place high on this list of thrillers, ‘This is the tale of revenge, murder, and how the lines between good and evil can blur so much you can no longer tell where one begins and the other ends – except that they both end in shocking violence.\n\nMaster director Kim Jee-Woon crafted this stunningly executed tale of a psychopathic killer with no morals, who is relentlessly tracked by a cop with a personal vendetta, and no desire to see justice down by the letter of the law. If you thought the Vengeance trilogy was the last word in this subject, then think again – I Saw The Devil turns revenge films inside out, and pushes the traditional cops and criminals genre into incredible new territory to boot. It’s a hard and brutal watch, but the violence always informs, and is never simply to titillate.’\n\n15. The Counterfeiters/Die Fälscher (2007, Austria/Germany)\n\nd. Stefan Ruzowitzky\n\nThis superb dramatic thriller concerns itself with the incredible true story of the Nazi plan to destabilise the United Kingdom by flooding the country with forged bank notes – counterfeited by Jewish prisoners kept in concentration camps.\n\nThe film focuses on Salomon Sorowitsch, a master forger seemingly only out for himself. But as the film progresses, and the Nazis become more desperate for the plan to succeed, his motivations become more muddled. Self-preservation mixes with his desire to help his fellow prisoners sabotage the plan from the inside, while also battling with his own perusal ambition to successfully forge the notes, proving he is the best. As the ticking clock counts down, the forgers walk the incredibly thin line between helping and hindering their captors, while trying to avoid a death that constantly stalks them.\n\n14. Infernal Affairs/Mou Gaan Dou (2002, Hong Kong)\n\nd. Andrew Lau, Alan Mak\n\nBetter than The Departed? That’s open for debate, but it has the edge in the thriller stakes, with a far more satisfying ending in my book. For those who have somehow managed to avoid either film, the plot revolves around a police spy who infiltrates a Triad gang, who in turn have one of their own posing as a police officer. A hunt for each other ensues, as both strive to serve two loyalties, and work out who they really are.\n\nOperating as a race against time, what makes Infernal Affairs so incredible is the humanity Andy Lau and Tony Leung each bring to their respective secret gangster and police officer. Suspenseful until the very last shot (and beyond), Infernal Affairs is a powerhouse of a film, and one which could only be remade by a master such as Scorsese.\n\n13. Hidden/Cache (2005, France)\n\nd. Michael Haneke\n\nSubversive, mysterious, and thought-provoking, Haneke’s psychological thriller about a bourgeois intellectual who begins receiving videos of himself in the post operates on many levels.\n\nFirstly there are the incredible performances of Daniel Auteuil as Georges and Juliette Binoche as his wife Anne, the couple who are terrorised by the anonymous packages. Secondly there is the tight script and even tighter editing, which propels you along with the story, commanding you to watch and wait to see what happens. Finally there is the subtext, an examination of middle-class guilt, and an investigation into repressed memory. All of it adds up to a compelling and disturbing package.\n\n12. The Chaser/Chugyeokja (2008, South Korea)\n\nd. Na Hong-jin\n\nThe directorial debut by The Yellow Seadirector Hong-jin, The Chaser is the charming tale of an ex-cop turned pimp tracking down serial killer who has been butchering his girls.\n\nBeyond the shocking headlines though is an expertly made old-school thriller of a film, which builds up to one of the most exciting foot chases in recent cinema. Yes that’s right, a foot chase. Watch it, and be amazed by how technically accomplished not just that scene is, but the whole film. It’s constructed like an intricate piece of clockwork engineering, with each seemingly unrelated plot element affecting the other and creating a sense of dreadful suspense. Truly outstanding.\n\n11. The Wave/Die Welle (2008, Germany)\n\nd. Dennis Gansel\n\nIntriguingly described as a ‘sociopolitical’ thriller in various places, The Wave is based on a 1967 California high-school experiment designed to show how easy it was to create fascist autocratic movements involving educated people. Rainer Wenger is a dissatisfied teacher made to teach a class on autocracy, despite his own anarchist leanings. However, after getting the students to call him Herr Wenger instead of Rainer, he begins to enjoy the power. The students too respond to their new sense of community and identity, becoming increasingly violent and ostracising to those not part of ‘The Wave’.\n\nChilling, well constructed and horrifyingly believable, The Wave is an entertaining look at a very serious subject.\n\n10. Elite Squad/Tropa De Elite (2007, Brazil)\n\nd. José Padilha\n\nChoosing to make your first fiction film about BOPE, the Brazilian government authorised death squads of the ’90s, was a brave choice for director Padhila. Along the way he also managed to antagonise the drug dealers of Rio, and was forced to answer to the Brazilian Congress. Luckily for him then it was worth it, with a firecracker of a film tracing the brutal career of Captain Roberto Nascimento, who viewers might recognise as a much more portly Pablo Escobar in Narcos.\n\nElite Squad is violent, difficult, and controversial, but it’s hugely gripping, with the war between BOPE and the drug-lords giving the audience no quarter.\n\n9. The Skin I Live In (2011, Spain)\n\nd. Pedro Almodovar\n\nThe Skin I Live In should’t work, fusing an almost unholy alliance of sexual melodrama, identity crisis, betrayal, and revenge, cloaked in the genres of horror and sci-fi. The fact that not only does it work, but excels, is down to Almodovar’s masterful control of proceedings, and lead Antonio Banderas’ charisma in the role of Dr. Robert Legard, who’s experiments with artificial skin hide a dark secret.\n\nA true suspense thriller down to the end, The Skin I Live In confirmed that Almodovar could find new ways to spin his thematic obsessions and create a truly dark and horrifying world.\n\n8. Memories Of Murder/Sarinui Chueok (2003, South Korea)\n\nd. Bong Joon-ho\n\nBased on the true life story of South Korea’s first serial murders, Memories Of Murder is a complex and exquisitely shot examination of the impact of brutal death on those investigating it. After a series of horrific killings, two rural cops and an investigator from Seoul desperately try to solve the case, employing ever more messy methods in the process.\n\nIt’s far from a slick operation, but thats what makes Memories Of Murder so compelling (that and the cinematography). Cases like this aren’t solved quickly and easily, and the film doesn’t shy away from what it takes to catch a killer, and how that will change you as a person. There are no quick fixes or easy answers on display here, and that’s just the way it should be.\n\n7. Cell 211/Celda 211 (2009, Spain)\n\nd. Daniel Monzón\n\nA film I’ve unforgivably neglected over the years, Cell 211 is a pulse pounding high-concept thriller about rookie prison guard Juan, who on his first day informal induction to the jail, gets caught up in a riot. Abandoned by the other guards, and unknown to the prisoners, he is able to pass himself off as a new inmate just put away for homicide. After befriending the leader of the riot, the violent and unpredictable Malamadre, Juan must learn to survive in his new environment.\n\nThere’s so much compelling content in this film, with the performance of Luis Tosar as Malamadre foremost amongst it. Backstories for the characters are skilfully and economically sketched out, raising the stakes constantly, while the sides of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ are never clear. Occasionally over melodramatic, Cell 211 is a must for your immediate watch list.\n\n6. The Consequences Of Love/Le Conseguenze Dell’amore (2004, Italy)\n\nd. Paolo Sorrentino\n\nA psychological examination of loneliness and love as much as it is a crime thriller, this superb looking and acted film is a slow build fro beginning to end, but with a third act that will have you holding your breath until the ending, which all I can say involves wet concrete and will leave you in a cold sweat for hours after. Titta Di Girolamo is a middle-aged businessman mysteriously living by himself in a swish Swiss hotel. He has secretive routines, but eschews meaningful contact with people. However, slowly but surely he finds himself developing feelings for Sofia, a beautiful waitress at the hotel. However, Tito is keeping several dark secrets, which gradually become revealed during the film, leading to the incredible ending.\n\nStylish and captivating, The Consequences Of Love is a true cinematic treat.\n\n5. Nine Queens/Nueve Reinas (2000, Argentina)\n\nd. Fabián Bielinsky\n\nAn absolute classic of Argentine cinema, Nine Queens is a movie about con-men, which might just be pulling a con on the audience. Not in any bad way I might add, just that you’ll never be quite sure what’s real int the film, and what’s not. Beyond this cleverness though is a killer plot involving two con-men and their attempts to get the ‘Nine Queens’, a set of rare stamps. Fakes, thefts, and double-crosses abound, and the whole thing is played out by a superb cast delivering lines with constant perfection.\n\nI’ve never wanted to pull a con on someone quite as much as after watching this film.\n\n4. Tell No One/Ne Le Dis à Personne (2006, France)\n\nd. Guillaume Canet\n\nTell No One is a superb mystery thriller, and a perfect adaptation of Harlen Coben’s novel. Years after a paediatrician’s wife is murdered, he receives an email from her, kick-starting an unstoppable chain of events that will leave the viewer bewildered and breathless. A brilliant and tense mystery thriller, it’s engrossing, twisting, and ultimately incredibly satisfying. The narrative momentum never slows down one iota, but still leaves time for you to learn all you need about the characters, their motivations, and what they truly believe in.\n\nIt also builds in time to make you genuinely care about a lovely dog sidekick (in the most uncheesy way possible too), and with a hugely satisfying conclusion building upon an equally satisfying first and second act, Tell No One teaches the rest of the world how the genre should really be approached.\n\n3. The Lives Of Others/Das Leben Der Anderen (2006, Germany)\n\nd. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\n\nSet in 1984 East Berlin, Gerd Wiesler is a member of the feared Stasi, who spends his days listening to suspected anti-regime activists. However, this insight into a world of free-thinking, free-speech, and freedom gradually begins to change the mindset of this loyal agent of the state.\n\nThe Lives Of Others is an extraordinary achievement, and I’ve often written about how much I love this film. It doesn’t quite get the top spot here as I think its personal drama is more important that the thriller element, but the story of betrayals and informants in Stasi controlled East Germany is still first rate, and propels the narrative into nail-biting territory on several occasions.\n\n2. The Secret In Their Eyes/El Secreto De Sus Ojos (2009, Argentina)\n\nd. Juan José Campanella\n\nI’ve yet to see the recent remake, but if it’s even half as good as the Argentinian original, it will be one of the best thrillers in years. I suspect it won’t be though. But speaking of the best thrillers of recent years, 2009’s The Secret In Their Eyes is an absolute must-watch. Retired prosecutor Eposito begins to write his first novel, based on an unsolved murder he investigated 25 years earlier, and which came to define his life since. Meeting with his former boss, Irene Hastings, with whom he has always been in love with, he seeks to make sense of it one last time.\n\nA film about obsession, secrets, and regrets, all played out with technical excellence, The Secret In Their Eyes is not only compelling and stylish, but filled with so much emotion that you can’t help but be seduced and intrigued by the mystery within.\n\n1. Oldboy/Oldeuboi (2003, South Korea)\n\nd.Park Chan-wook\n\nWell it had to be really didn’t it? Justifiably hyped for years, Oldboy is a visceral gut punch to the viewer, which both rewards and punishes with brilliantly paced sequences throughout the film. Oh Dae-su, a nondescript everyman, is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years without knowing why and by whom. Upon his release, he sets out to seek and wreak bloody revenge, along the way falling in love with a young female sushi chef.\n\nThe stand-out scenes are justifiably famous, such as the octopus eating and the corridor fight scene (which clearly inspired a similar sequence in Netflix’s Daredevil), but it is the terrible build to the explosive climax which really gets under the skin. Horrifying to behold but impossible not to watch, this is truly the finest thriller of modern times. Best avoid the Spike Lee remake though."
