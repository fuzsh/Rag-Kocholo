        "text": "Flight Sergeant Morris Rose of No 3 Squadron points out the essential characteristics of the V-1 flying bomb to other Tempest pilots at Newchurch, 23 June 1944. The Scottish pilot downed his first 'doodlebug' on 16 June, and by the end of July had claimed a total of 11 destroyed.\n\nGround crew refuel and re-arm Hawker Tempest Mark V 'JF-G' of No. 3 Squadron RAF by the grass North-South runway at Newchurch, Kent. On the far side of the runway is the dispersal area of No. 56 Squadron RAF.\n\nGround crew servicing and refuelling a Hawker Tempest Mark V of No. 56 Squadron RAF in flooded conditions after the heavy rains at B80/Volkel, Holland.\n\nWing Commander R P Beaumont, wing leader of No. 150 Wing, leaning against a Hawker Tempest Mark V of No. 3 Squadron RAF at Newchurch Advanced Landing Ground, Kent.\n\nSquadron Leader A S Dredge, Officer Commanding No. 3 Squadron RAF, briefs his pilots for a sweep over the Caen area, on the elevator of a Hawker Tempest Mark V, 'JF-M' at Newchurch, Kent.\n\n1944 Pilots of No 486 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force, assemble in front of their Hawker Tempest fighter-bombers on an airfield in Belgium. No 486 was one of three New Zealand squadrons in 2nd Tactical Air Force, supporting the Allied armies in North-West Europe.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of No. 486 Squadron RNZAF confers with his some of his pilots in front of their Hawker Tempest Mark Vs at B60/Grimbergen, Belgium. The group consists of, (left to right); Flying Officer N J Powell, Pilot Officer W A L Trott, Flying Officer R J Cammock, Warrant Officer A H Bailey, Pilot Officer S J Short, Flying Officer J H Stafford, Flight Lieutenant H M Sweetman, Squadron Leader J H Iremonger (CO), and Flight Lieutenant E W Tanner.\n\nA Hawker Typhoon Mk 1B in fighter pen at North West corner of RAF Duxford. The evidence suggests that this is a 'Bombphoon' of No. 181 Squadron; formed at Duxford on 1 September. No. 181 Squadron pioneered the use of the Typhoon as a low level bomber or 'Bombphoon'. The black and white stripes painted on the underside of the wings - sometimes referred to as 'Dieppe stripes'- were actually introduced following the failed Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942. Originally only black stripes were painted on but white stripes were added by December 1942 for greater recognition by other RAF aircraft who had mistaken the Typhoon for the German Focke Wulf 190. Duxford's original Typhoon Wing - 56, 609 and 266 Squadrons -had all left Duxford by late September 1942.\n\nTyphoon Mark IB, MN234 'SF-T', of No 137 Squadron RAF with a full load of 60-lb. rocket-projectiles beneath the wings, running up on an engine test at B78/Eindhoven, Holland.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Walter Dring, commander of B Flight, No. 183 Squadron RAF, with his Typhoon Mark IB, R8884 HF-L, in a dispersal at Gatwick, Sussex.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Raymond 'Cheval' Lallemant's reputation as an admirer of all things equestrian was reflected in this shot set up in front of a Typhoon at Martragny (B-7) on 30 July 1944. The 24 year old Belgian was a flight commander with No 198 Squadron at this time, and was soon to command No 609. Badly burned in a crash in August, 'Cheval' did not return to operations until March 1945.\n\nHMS Ocean korean war,Leading Airman (Photographer) B Chilton and Petty Officer Photographer P Johnson load an aerial camera onto a Sea Fury aircraft on board HMS OCEAN before an armed reconnaissance over Korea.\n\nHawker Tempest Mark II aircraft lined up beside the runway at the Hawker Aircraft Ltd factory at Langley, Berkshire.\n\nFlying Officer J R Cullen of No. 486 Squadron RNZAF, standing in front of his Hawker Tempest Mark V at Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire. Cullen became a successful Operation DIVER pilot with the Squadron,, shooting down around 16 flying bombs launched against the United Kingdom. Between February and October 1945 he commanded No. 183 Squadron RAF, flying Hawker Typhoons.\n\nHawker Tempest Mark Vs of No. 3 Squadron RAF undergoing servicing at Newchurch, Kent, while other off-duty ground crew relax in the foreground. The view was taken from one of the tents which constituted the accommodation for RAF personnel, since no permanent buildings were constructed at this Advanced Landing Ground.\n\n1944 An aircrew officer and a guard on night duty listen to a choir, composed of the ground crew of No. 122 Wing, singing Christmas carols by a Hawker Tempest in a dispersal at Volkel airfield (B80), Holland, conducted by the Wing's Padre, Squadron Leader K J Morgan.\n\nTempest Mark Vs lined up on completion at the Hawker Aircraft Company works at Langley, Berkshire. The nearest aircraft, JN818, served with No. 3 Squadron RAF and was flown by the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader K A Wigglesworth, when the Newchurch Tempest wings attacked a V2 launch site in a wood 20 miles north of the Hague on 13 September 1944. Wigglesworth fired on the target, causing an explosion which destroyed his aircraft and killed him.\n\nHMS glory Korean war, \"Away chocks\".

Mackie joined the RNZAF in 1941 and arrived in the United Kingdom in 1942 where, after a period at an Operational Training Unit he was posted to No, 485 Squadron RNZAF. Early in 1943 he joined No. 243 Squadron RAF in North Africa, and achieved considerable success, becoming a flight commander in May and commanding the squadron itself in June. In November 1943, after further victories over Sicily and Italy he was given the command of 92 Squadron RAF. Mackie's long tour of operations ended on 20 February 1944, after which he returned to the United Kingdom and converted to flying the Hawker Tempest. In December 1944 he joined No. 274 Squadron RAF in Holland, but was made Commanding Officer of No. 80 Squadron RAF the following month, and then promoted Wing Leader of No. 122 Wing RAF in April 1945, before returning to New Zealand the following September.\n\nTwo pilots of No. 486 Squadron RNZAF, Warrant Officer O D Eagleson of Auckland, and Flying Officer R J Cammock of Christchurch, stand by the tail of a Hawker Tempest four days after the Squadron's arrival at B60/Grimbergen, Belgium. Both pilots achieved high scores against flying-bombs launched against the United Kingdom before the Squadron moved to Europe; Eagleson destroyed 21 and Cammock 20.5.\n\nSanta Claus (Leading Aircraftman Fred Fazan from London) hands out presents to Dutch children at Volkel, 13 December 1944. Members of No 122 Wing had saved their sweet ration for weeks, and contributed enough money to give the children their first proper Christmas party. It was noted by the photographer that this year Santa was afraid of Messerschmitts, so he decided to come by RAF Tempest!\n\nOfficers of the two squadrons on the airfield at Kuala Lumpur.

Coastal shipping was another target, including this unfortunate tug caught in the Scheldt estuary in September 1944. In this case the shell splashes from the aircraft's four 20mm cannon assist the pilot in correcting his aim before unleashing a salvo of RPs.\n\nExhibiting its aggressive lines to advantage, Typhoon IB JP853/SA-K of No 486 Squadron displays for the photographer during a visit to Tangmere, 27 October 1943. One of the Typhoon's problems, especially during its first months of service, was that it was frequently mistaken for the FW190. After various experiments the identification markings shown here, consisting of 12in black and 24in white bands, were adopted.\n\nArmourers fit two extra 60-lb rocket-projectiles to the four normally carried on the wing rails of Hawker Typhoon Mark IB, MN178 'PR-V', of No. 609 Squadron RAF at B77/Gilze-Rijen, Netherlands. The ability of the Typhoon to carry twelve instead of eight RPs was, however, little-used.\n\nKorea, Rearming a Sea Fury on THESEUS.

Baldwin joined the RAFVR and served as a ground crew-man in France during 1940. After bomb-disposal duties in the United Kingdom, he transferred to aircrew and joined No. 609 Squadron RAF, flying Typhoons, in 1942. After steadily building up his victory score, he became Commanding Officer of No. 198 Squadron RAF in November 1943, leaving them in April 1944 for a staff appointment at No. 11 Group, Fighter Command. He was promoted as wing leader of 146 Wing in June 1944 and on 13 July destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 to bring his score to 16.5 victories. He spent the rest of the war on ground attack duties and in 1945 was promoted to Group Captain, commanding No.123 Wing.\n\nSergenat W Page of Coulsdon, Surrey, and Leading Aircraftman G Skelsey of London fit a long-range fuel tank to a Hawker Typhoon Mark IB of No. 137 Squadron RAF at B78 Eindhoven, Holland. The tanks enabled the Typhoons to carry out strikes deeper into German territory, at the expense of a reduced weapons load of two, instead of four, rocket projectiles carried under each wing.\n\nWing Commander M N Crossley standing in front of a Hawker Typhoon at Gravesend, Kent. In 1940 Crossley shot down 22 enemy aircraft over France and during the Battle of Britain while flying with No. 32 Squadron RAF, latterly as its Commanding Officer. He led a wing of Supermarine Spitfires in 1941, and was then posted to the united States as a test pilot for the British Air Commission.
