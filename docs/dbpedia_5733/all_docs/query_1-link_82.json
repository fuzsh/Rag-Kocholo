        "text": "Details Stunning Italian painting of Luciana Paluzzi \"Exciting new Italian star in her first Pinewood film!\" This British double-crown is a stunning composition complete with the ocean and seagulls. Luciana Paluzzi is the local siren who Stanley Baker and Victor McLaglen compete for her attention. This is an interesting film poster as it features Italian artwork used by Rank films for use in the British market organised by the Downton agency in England run by Eric Pulford who supplied the reference material on his trips to Rome and employing many Italian artists who produced artwork with a freedom of expression completely different to British artists working at the time. This is a very early example of the success of this operation. Printed by Charles & Read Ltd. of London & Harlow. The film poster features the printed signature of artist Pino d'ell Orco."
