        "text": "Power words are like a “cheat code” for boosting conversion rates.\n\nSprinkle in a few, and you can transform dull, lifeless words into persuasive words that compel readers to take action.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nYou can use them anywhere.\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn how to use power words like a kung fu master. Specifically:\n\nThe definition of power words (and why they’re so powerful);\n\nThe 7 types of power words proven to increase conversions;\n\nExamples of how bloggers, freelance writers, and businesses are using powerful words to boost conversions;\n\nA huge power words list you can use, bookmark, and reference (again and again).\n\nWant to bring your ideas to life, to make them take up residence in the reader’s mind, lurking in the background, tugging, pulling, and cajoling their emotions until they think and feel exactly as you want?\n\nThen you’re going to love this post.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nClear as mud?\n\nLet’s deconstruct an example from the great Winston Churchill. All the power words are underlined:\n\nInspiring, right?\n\nHere’s why:\n\nPower Words = Emotional Words Packed with Persuasion\n\nSmart speakers, as well as their speechwriters, sprinkle their speeches with carefully-chosen power words drenched in sensory details, drawing the target audience from one emotion to another as skillfully as any novelist or screenwriter.\n\nAnd it goes beyond speakers and storytellers.\n\nEmail marketing messages, copywriting, infographics, step-by-step tutorials, sales pages, inspirational quotes, content marketing, case studies, calls to action, testimonials, tweets, and other social media posts are all designed to influence the reader (and prospective customers) in some way. You want to pass along information, yes, but you also want the reader to feel a certain way about that information.\n\nMaybe you want to impress them, get them excited, make them cautious, get them angry, encourage them to keep going, trigger curiosity, create urgency, build trust with them, or any number of emotions. The better a job you do at making them feel, the more influential you are, and the better your chances of getting what you want.\n\nSo…\n\nLooking for a quick way to give your writing more punch?\n\nMaybe add a little personality or pizzazz — that extra little “oomph” that grabs your reader’s attention?\n\nThen you need to expand your vocabulary and infuse your content with emotional power words.\n\nWe’ve organized our power words into seven different types, which all accomplish the same goal: Each elicits emotion in your reader.\n\nLet’s go over each type and see why these words work.\n\n1. Fear Power Words\n\nLet’s do a little experiment.\n\nJust for a moment, stop reading this post, turn on the television, and go to a major news channel. Watch it for five minutes, listening for the words below.\n\nChances are, you’ll hear dozens of them. Here’s why:\n\nFear is without a doubt the most powerful emotion for grabbing and keeping an audience’s attention. To make sure you don’t change the channel, news networks load up with fear words, making you worry you might miss something important.\n\nGranted, you can overdo it, but in my opinion, most writers don’t use these types of words nearly enough. They really do connect with people.\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Fear Words\n\nHere’s an example of a blog post headline here at Smart Blogger that utilizes three different fear words:\n\nOpen it and you’re greeted by this fear-packed introduction:\n\nPretty effective, right?\n\nHere’s another one:\n\nIf I’m working from my home office, will I lose my sanity if I don’t read this post? There’s only one way to find out. (Click!)\n\nWant to sprinkle fear power words into your writing? Here are a bunch to get you started:\n\n2. Encouragement Power Words\n\nLet’s face it.\n\nWhen they’re reading, most people aren’t exactly bouncing off the walls with energy and enthusiasm. They’re probably bored, maybe a little depressed, and almost definitely tired.\n\nAnd they’re looking for something, anything, that’ll wake them up and make them feel better.\n\nThe good news?\n\nYour writing can do that for them.\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Encouragement Words\n\nHere’s an example email from Mirasee:\n\nWith two encouraging words — life-changing and magic — in one email subject line, it’s a message that stands out in most inboxes.\n\nWant to give your readers a pep talk and get them charged up again? Want to encourage them?\n\nUse these persuasive words and adjectives:\n\n3. Lust Power Words\n\nLike it or not, lust is one of the core human emotions.\n\nJust look at the men’s and women’s magazines in the checkout aisle, and you’ll see what I mean. Nearly every headline on the cover is either blatantly or indirectly about sex.\n\nAnd it works, not just for headlines in men’s and women’s magazines, but for messages to your email list, subheads in your articles, marketing copy — anything.\n\nAs a writer (or marketer), you can use words that inspire lust to make almost anything intriguing.\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Lust Words\n\nSee if you can spot the lust words in this headline from Cosmopolitan:\n\nOkay, the orange underlines probably give it away, but my hunch is you didn’t need them.\n\nPower words like captivating and love jump off the page. And if you use them properly, they can stir all sorts of emotions in your readers’ heads. (Want to see your click-through rates soar? Add a lust power word or two.)\n\nHere’s a power words list of descriptive words to get you started:\n\n4. Anger Power Words\n\nAs writers, sometimes our job is to anger people.\n\nNot for the fun of it, mind you, but because someone is doing something wrong, and the community needs to take action to correct it.\n\nThe problem is, with wrongdoing, most people are pretty apathetic — they’ll wait until the situation becomes entirely intolerable to do anything, and by then, it’s often too late.\n\nSo, we have to fan the flames.\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Anger Words\n\nThe authors of this Forbes headline don’t pull any punches:\n\nI didn’t realize some people get angry over business jargon, but apparently it’s a thing. And this headline, undoubtedly, had such people frothing at the mouth.\n\nIf you want to connect with people’s anger and slowly but surely work them into a frenzy, use the power words below.\n\nJust be careful who you target. Lawyers can eat you alive if you pick on the wrong person. 🙂\n\n5. Greed Power Words\n\nThe legendary copywriter Gary Halbert once said, “If you want people to buy something, stomp on their greed glands until they bleed.” Graphic, yes, but also true.\n\nSkim through good digital marketing campaign copy on an e-commerce site, and you’ll find a lot of power words based on vanity or greed. Many of them are so overused they’ve become cliché, but that doesn’t stop them from working.\n\nThe truth is, nearly every human being on the planet is interested in making money (or saving money).\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Greed Words\n\nIts explicit and implicit use of greed words makes this popular book from Dave Ramsey a great example:\n\n“Money” is hard to miss — it’s probably the ultimate greed word and it’s sitting there in capital letters.\n\nBut a title like “Total Money Makeover” also implies another greed word (even though it doesn’t directly state it): money-saving.\n\n(It also gets bonus points for using alliteration and the safety power word “proven”, which we’ll discuss in a moment.)\n\nIf you want to stomp (which is also an excellent example of onomatopoeia, by the way) on your readers’ greed glands, use these power words:\n\n6. Safety Power Words\n\nGreed isn’t the only emotion you want buyers to feel. You also want to make them feel safe.\n\nThey need to trust both you and your product or service. They need to have confidence you’ll deliver, and they need to believe they’ll get results.\n\nOf course, building that kind of trust starts with having a quality brand and reputation, but the words you use to describe yourself and your product or service also matter.\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Safety Words\n\nOn the landing page for one of our Smart Blogger courses, we use power words to make sure our potential customers feel safe:\n\nIn addition to “legitimate” and “guaranteed” in the screenshot above, our landing page is sprinkled with numerous safety words:\n\nMoney-back\n\nResults\n\nRefund\n\nProven\n\nRisk-free\n\nThey work for us, and they can work for you.\n\nHelp your customers feel safe by using as many of these power words as possible:\n\n7. Forbidden Power Words\n\nRemember when you were a kid, and someone told you NOT to do something? From that point on, you could think about little else, right? Curiosity always got the better of us.\n\nThe truth is, we’re all fascinated by the mysterious and forbidden. It’s like it’s programmed into our very nature.\n\nSo why not tap into that programming?\n\nHow to Crank Up Emotion with Forbidden Words\n\nThis Ahrefs article tempts you with its headline:\n\nWhat’s the “secret”? Only one way to find out.\n\nWhenever you want to create curiosity, sprinkle these curiosity power words throughout your writing, and readers won’t be able to help being intrigued:\n\nNow that we’ve looked at the different types of power words (and gone over a few quick examples), let’s go over all the different places you can use them:\n\n1. Using Power Words in Headlines\n\nAny writer or blogger who’s been in the game for a while knows the headline is the most important part of writing your blog post.\n\nIts purpose, after all, is to entice the reader to read the rest of your content. If your headline fails to get attention, potential readers will ignore it when it shows up in their tweets and social media feeds.\n\nAnd just one or two power words in your headline is usually enough to make it stand out.\n\nJust look at this headline from BuzzFeed:\n\nThe word choice of “Unveiled” makes it feel like a secret is being exposed, and the word “Breathtaking” makes you curious to see what the photo looks like.\n\nHere’s another example from BoredPanda:\n\nPeople generally love anything adorable, so this headline will easily catch attention. (The fact that it refers to snakes will only make people more curious.)\n\nThe headline then drives it home by using the power verb “Conquer.”\n\nHere’s one from BrightSide:\n\nWhile one or two power words are often enough, this headline proves you can use more when it fits.\n\nThis headline has four powerful words, but they feel natural in the headline, which keeps it from feeling like over-the-top clickbait.\n\nHere’s one from Smart Blogger:\n\nGreed (“best”) and anger (“not-so-good”) words highlight the headline for Smart Blogger’s recent review of SiteGround.\n\nLast one:\n\nThis headline from our How to Make Money Writing: 5 Ways to Get Paid to Write in 2024 post incorporates two greed words: “money” and “get paid.”\n\nIt’s one of our most popular posts, and its headline’s use of power words is a big reason why.\n\n2. Using Power Words in Subheads\n\nToo many writers overlook the value of subheads, which is a mistake. Once people click on your headline, most will scan the post first to see if it looks worthy of their attention.\n\nAdding some power words to your subheads is a good way to make your post look like an interesting read.\n\nFor example, here are three subheads from our post on E-book mistakes:\n\nSee how the power words in these subheads grab your attention and make you want to read the text that follows?\n\nPower words can help with SEO too. Adding an SEO power word to your subheads will compel readers to stick around longer, which will increase your dwell time — a big deal in Google’s eyes.\n\n3. Using Power Words in Email Subject Lines\n\nHaving an email list is of little use if only a handful of readers bother to open your emails.\n\nAnd these days, most people’s inboxes are flooded, so they’re selective in which emails they open.\n\nYou can stand out in their inbox and raise your open rates by including power words in your subject lines.\n\nJust look at this one from Ramit Sethi:\n\nIf this subject line would’ve read “The rules of learning,” do you think it would be as appealing? The powerful word “unspoken” is what makes it interesting.\n\nHere’s another one from Cal Fussman:\n\nBoth “Triumph” and “Tragedy” are powerful words full of emotion.\n\nAnd finally, here’s a good example from AppSumo:\n\nThe power phrase “Unleash the power” makes you feel this email is hiding something incredibly powerful inside.\n\nSee how that works?\n\nWhen you send out emails to your list, try to add a strong word to your subject line so it stands out in a prospect’s inbox.\n\n4. Using Power Words in Opt-In Boxes\n\nAs a blogger, one of your main goals is to grow a large and engaged readership, and the best way to do it is by converting readers into subscribers.\n\nThat means — unless you’re using a blogging platform like Medium which doesn’t allow them — you should have opt-in forms scattered across your website.\n\nYou can place them on your homepage, at the end of your posts, in your sidebar, in a popup, or anywhere else.\n\nBut no matter where you place them, your opt-in boxes must catch people’s eye and make them want to share their email address with you. Because they won’t give it away to just anyone.\n\n(Remember, their inboxes are already flooded, so they’re not necessarily eager to get even more emails.)\n\nFortunately, you can use power words to make your offer more enticing.\n\nAs an example, here’s an old popup from Cosmopolitan:\n\nThis popup had power words everywhere, but it avoided feeling like overkill. I bet it converted like crazy.\n\nHere’s a slightly more subtle example from Betty Means Business:\n\nIt’s understated, but still quite effective.\n\nAgain, you don’t have to overdo it with the power words on these. A little can go a long way.\n\nHere’s one final example from Renegade Planner:\n\nIn short:\n\nIf you’re not using power words in your opt-in boxes, you’re missing out.\n\nBig time.\n\n5. Using Power Words on Your Homepage\n\nYour homepage is the face of your website and it’s usually one of the most visited pages. Many people who visit your website will see this page first, so you want it to make a good first impression.\n\nSome people use their homepage to promote their email list, others use it to promote one of their products, and others use it as a red carpet — welcoming new visitors and explaining what their site is all about.\n\nIn any case, your homepage is a good spot to add a few power words, as it can determine whether people stay (and take the action you want them to take) or leave (never to return).\n\nLook at this value proposition on the homepage for Nerd Fitness:\n\n“Nerds,” “Misfits,” and “Mutants” are unusual power words that work well for Nerd Fitness’ target audience. These words immediately separate it from all the other fitness blogs out there.\n\nBut they push it even further with “Strong,” “Healthy,” and “Permanently.”\n\nHere’s another value proposition from MainStreetHost’s homepage:\n\nIt’s quite minimal, isn’t it? They just wrote down three power words and follow it up with a service they provide.\n\nOf course, you don’t have to limit your use of power words to the top of your homepage.\n\nYou can use it in other parts of the homepage too, as Ramit Sethi does here in his list of what you’ll get when you sign up for his email list:\n\nGo look at your homepage now and see if you can find any areas you can spruce up with some power words.\n\n6. Using Power Words in Business Names/Blog Names\n\nHaving a forgettable name is poison to your website’s growth. So when you start a blog, you want to make sure you have a name people can easily recall.\n\nIf you haven’t chosen your blog name yet (or if you’re thinking about rebranding), you should use a SEO power word to give it some punch. The right word will make you stand out from all the boring, forgettable brands out there.\n\nJust take a look at the collection of blog names below and see how well they’ve incorporated power words:\n\n7. Using Power Words in Product Names\n\nJust like you can use power words to spruce up your blog name, you can also use them to make your product names pack more of a punch.\n\nIt can make the difference between your potential customers thinking, “Ooh, this product sounds cool!” and them thinking, “Meh.”\n\nJust check out this subscription product from Nerd Fitness:\n\nIt has such a powerful name that you’d almost want to sign up without learning anything else about it. Who wouldn’t want to be part of a community of rising heroes?\n\nHere’s another good example from Pat Flynn:\n\nIt’s a powerful name for his podcasting course that instantly informs you of the benefit.\n\nSo if you’re about to launch a product (or if you’ve launched a product with a tepid name), consider giving it a power word to make it pack a punch.\n\n8. Using Power Words on Sales Pages\n\nYou can also use power words to spruce up the copywriting on your sales pages and make them more effective at selling your e-commerce products or services.\n\nThey will grab people’s attention when they arrive on the page, they will keep their attention as they scroll down, and they’ll help seduce readers before they reach your “buy” button.\n\nJust look at this headline on Ramit Sethi’s sales page for his product 50 Proven Email Scripts (which also has a power word in its name):\n\nAnd as you scroll down, you see he keeps using power words throughout his sales page.\n\nHis headline is followed by emotion-packed subheads:\n\nAnd he even uses power words in his guarantee:\n\n9. Using Power Words in Testimonials\n\nPower words are also tremendously effective in testimonials.\n\nOf course, I’m not suggesting you change people’s testimonials to include power words. But you can certainly select the ones that already use them to great effect.\n\nJust look at this example from Betty Means Business:\n\nOr look at this one from Farideh’s blog:\n\nAnd here’s another example from Renegade Planner:\n\nAll these testimonials will lend extra credibility and excitement due to their power words and phrases.\n\n10. Using Power Words in Bullet Lists\n\nMany sales pages include a list of benefits of the product they’re selling. Many opt-in forms include a huge list of reasons you should sign up to their email list. And many case studies use bullet lists to quickly summarize information.\n\nYou can use power words in these lists to inspire more excitement in your reader as they read through them.\n\nHere’s one example from Ramit Sethi’s sales page for his How to Talk to Anyone course:\n\nAnd here’s another example from an opt-in form on Restart Your Style:\n\nWithout these power words, these lists wouldn’t convince nearly as many prospects to buy or subscribe.\n\n11. Using Power Words in Button Copy and CTA (Call to Action Words)\n\nYep, you can use power words in your CTA button copy too — even if you only have a few words you can fit in there.\n\nOne of the most common power words used in buttons is “Free” (as in the example below):\n\nBut you can be more creative with buttons than you might think.\n\nTakes this button from the sales page for the book The Renegade Diet:\n\n“Immediate,” “Money Back,” and “Guarantee” are all incredibly powerful words, and the author manages to squeeze them all into one button.\n\nHere’s an example from Tim Ferris:\n\nHe could’ve used “Send Me the List” as most people would do, but the specific word “Unlock” makes it sound a lot more intriguing — like you’re getting access to something that’s been kept hidden away.\n\nNow take a look at the buttons on your site.\n\nDo you see any opportunities to spruce them up with a power word?\n\n12. Using Power Words in Author Bios\n\nYour author bio is another extremely important part of your marketing strategy.\n\nWhen you guest post for another blog (or write a paid article as a freelancer), your author bio has the difficult job of making readers want to know more about you so they click through to your site.\n\nThat means your author bio needs to spark attention and interest. And you usually only get three sentences, so you need to carefully consider the words you use.\n\nAs an example, here’s the author bio from Henneke Duistermaat in her ultimate guide on overcoming writer’s block:\n\nHenneke’s author bio is full of power words. It shows her uniqueness and makes her stand out from other copywriters.\n\nYou can tell she has carefully picked each perfect word for maximum impact.\n\nHere’s another example from Sarah Peterson’s post on blog ads:\n\nShe opens strong immediately by mentioning her guides are insanely useful. And just the name of her report alone is full of power words: “Free,” “Reveal,” and “Begging.”\n\nMakes you want to get your hands on that report, doesn’t it?\n\n13. Using Power Words on YouTube Videos\n\nIf you’re publishing videos on YouTube and you want to get more views, you should use power words in your titles.\n\nAll the biggest YouTube channels do this.\n\nThey understand most of their views will come from their subscribers finding them in their feeds, and from people finding them in the sidebar of other videos.\n\nIn both cases, you’re competing with many other videos for their attention. If you want your video to stand out and be the one they choose to watch, your title has to be captivating.\n\nSee how Philip DeFranco does it below:\n\n“Disgusting,” “Punishment,” and “Controversy” are all attention-grabbing words (and that’s besides the attention-grabbing names of Brock Turner, Star Wars, and Kim Kardashian).\n\nNote also how he has capitalized “Disgusting.” It’s another smart trick many YouTube channels use to stand out more in YouTube’s lists of video suggestions.\n\nStyle vlogger Aaron Marino often does it as well:\n\nBy capitalizing the power words “Don’ts” and “Stupid,” his title catches a lot more attention (as you can see for yourself by the millions of views it’s received).\n\n14. Using Power Words in Book Titles\n\nIf you’re interested in writing your own book, adding power words to your titles will help it sell better.\n\nWith all the competition in the book market these days, you need a title that grabs people’s attention and makes them want to peek inside.\n\nHere are a few quick grabs from Amazon’s list of bestsellers in the self-help niche:\n\nI’m sure you’ve seen this title before.\n\nYou might say Stephen Covey’s use of power words in his title has been highly effective. (See what I did there?)\n\nHere’s another:\n\nMark Manson’s bestselling title is packed with power.\n\nThe power word “Subtle” juxtaposes well with the F-bomb in the title, and his use of “Counterintuitive” will spark some interest as well.\n\nOne more:\n\nLastly, Jen Sincero’s encouraging book title makes you want to flip it open and read it in one go.\n\nThe use of “Badass” alone will make it stand out in the self-development section, but her use of “Greatness” and “Awesome” in the subtitle truly seals the deal.\n\nGo Ahead and Tell Me. What Powerful Words Did I Miss?\n\nThey’re known by many names…\n\nEmotion words. Good words. Strong words. Powerful words, creative words, sensory words, trigger words, persuasive words, curiosity words, descriptive words, impactful words, interesting words, positive words, unique words, action words, and even — yes, seriously — awesome words.\n\nBut whatever you call them; smart, attractive people such as yourself have mastered the strategic use of power words and use this valuable communication skill every day to pack their writing with emotion so they can increase conversions.\n\nYes, this is an enormous list of words, but with so many power words and power phrases available, you’d need a thesaurus or Word of the Day dictionary to catch every single word on the first pass. (Plus, new words seem to be added to the English language every day.)\n\nWhat are some other good words that seem to have that extra little spark of emotion inside them? Do you have favorite power words? What are some other ways you can use power words that I didn’t go over (a Facebook ad, a resume headline, cover letter, etc.)?\n\nShare them in a comment below."
