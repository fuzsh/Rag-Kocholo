        "text": "AUSTRALIAN PREMIERE\n\nEl Maestro que Prometi√≥ el Mar\n\nIn 1935, Antoni Benaiges (a stellar Enric Auquer, Two Many Chefs SPA23) is hired as a teacher in a small, isolated village in Burgos, Spain. There, he establishes an intense relationship with his students, a group of young boys and girls between the ages of six and twelve. To them, he makes a promise: he will take them to see the sea for the first time in their lives.\n\n75 years later, the granddaughter of one of those students (played by Laia Costa, also in Un Amor) who has set out in search of her grandfather comes across the wonderful, yet tragic story of his teacher and the tale hidden behind a promise that was never fulfilled.\n\nBased on the incredible true story of Antoni Benaiges, a Catalan teacher who brought progressive teaching methods from France to the rural village, this emotional drama traversing the past and present, shines a light on the power of education and historical memory.\n\n\"This film is a thing of beauty\" - El Diario\n\nWINNER - Audience Award, Gaudi Awards 2024\n\nNOMINEE (x5) including Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Goya Awards 2024\n\nNOMINEE (x6) including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Non-Catalan Language Film, Gaudi Awards 2024"
