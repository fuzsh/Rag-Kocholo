Future ZULU collaborators American blacklisted turned British-film director Cy Endfield and his previous years' HELL DRIVERS leading man Stanley Baker basically made the same movie only about a tug boat instead of trucks and with very little action, intrigue or competition...

Although the love triangle is more important and upfront as old, somewhat friendly and completely weathered captain Victor McLaglen practically gets youthful (local) Spanish beauty Luciana Paluzzi thrown into his lap by her money-hungry father...

Only she, quickly and predictably, falls for the captain's handsome new first mate Baker who, like in DRIVERS, goes from stranger in town to hard-edged over-achiever whose fellow workmates, especially an underused Robert Shaw, wants him knocked down but sadly, given the cast and old school Errol Flynn-style seafront locale, the description of a battle between old and young man for the young lady never pans out, making an extremely misleading title of SEA FURY that's also the literal name of the boat... one that, despite an adventurous 11th hour rescue, runs out of steam before even really gaining any.
