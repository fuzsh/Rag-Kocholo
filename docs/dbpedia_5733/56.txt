“The Fury by Alex Michaelides is a proper, grown-up thriller that exudes class from every page. So much more than a murder mystery, every twist and turn is simultaneously a total surprise and completely inevitable. The writing is perfectly sparse, yet cloaks a narrative of rare complexity. So many contradictions, yet all unite in a devastating whole. The Fury is a very special book and highly recommended.” —Janice Hallett, Author of international bestseller The Appeal

"Alex Michaelides is the grand master of the modern mystery. The Fury reads like Hitchcock with a heart, or Agatha Christie running amok on a wind-whipped Greek island. A tale of old friends and buried emotions ready to explode, all set on an idyllic island rendered so perfectly you can smell the jasmine, the ouzo and the Aegean Sea. The Fury will, quite literally, blow you away. Totally brilliant." —Tony Parsons, Author of Who She Was
