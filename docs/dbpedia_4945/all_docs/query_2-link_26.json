        "text": "Season fixture lists have been released for the Wellington Phoenix men’s and women’s A-League teams.\n\nThe Wellington Phoenix will play 21 matches in the capital, with just three fixtures to potentially be taken to other parts of Aotearoa.\n\nSky Stadium, which recently played host to more than 230,000 fans during the FIFA Women’s World Cup, will stage at least 14 of the Phoenix’s matches.\n\nWellington Phoenix general manager David Dome says there’s never been a better time to be a football fan in the capital.\n\n“The FIFA Women’s World Cup was simply incredible and it was amazing to see Sky Stadium fill for a number of matches.\n\n“We hope those fans get behind the only professional football club in New Zealand and cheer on our men and women this season.\n\n“The best way to do that is to buy a season ticket. It costs less than $15 a game for a full membership, which includes all 24 Phoenix matches, and a women’s membership is currently on sale for just $99.”\n\nThe Phoenix women will kick-off their third Liberty A-League season at Sky Stadium on Sunday, October 15 against Melbourne City, and will return to the ‘Ring of Fire’ for double-headers with the men on Saturday, November 4 and Saturday, December 23.\n\nThe venues for the women’s eight remaining home matches have yet to be confirmed, but at least seven will be in Wellington.\n\nSix of their home fixtures will be played on Sundays, primarily at 4pm or 5pm, with five on Saturday afternoons.\n\n“I’m really excited about the upcoming women’s season, and I hope our fans are too,” Dome said.\n\n“Wellingtonians created an incredible atmosphere throughout the FIFA Women’s World Cup and I want our players to experience that at Sky Stadium.\n\n“We also want to play at more intimate venues so our fans can get closer to the action than ever before.”\n\nThe Phoenix men will visit Western Sydney Wanderers on Sunday, October 22 in the opening round of the 2023-24 Isuzu UTE A-League, before hosting Perth Glory in their home opener at Sky Stadium on Saturday, October 28.\n\nThey will play a further 10 times at Sky Stadium, with the club only considering taking two matches, their fifth round fixture against Melbourne City and their round 21 game against Sydney FC, out of the capital.\n\nEight of the men’s home matches will be played on Saturdays, predominantly at 5.30pm, with three Friday night fixtures and just two on Sunday evenings.\n\n“Following fan feedback we have made a decision to move away from the 3pm kick-offs, which were a feature of last season.\n\n“While they were great for families, we’re hoping this season’s match times will appeal to a wider section of our supporters.\n\n“We’re also looking forward to staging a few Friday night matches for the first time in several seasons.”"
