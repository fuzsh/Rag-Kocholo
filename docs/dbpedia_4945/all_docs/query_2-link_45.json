        "text": "A-League football has returned to New Zealand with a bang, after Wellington Phoenix set a record crowd for the season at their first game back on home soil.\n\nA crowd of 24,105 created a fantastic atmosphere at Sky Stadium in Wellington, as Phoenix played at home for the first time after a COVID-enforced displacement to Wollongong since the start of November.\n\nComing 433 days since their last home game in New Zealand, Phoenix sent their fans home happy with a 3-0 defeat of Western United. After a brief return to NSW to face Western Sydney, Phoenix will play their last home game of the regular season in Auckland next Sunday, in front of what is expected to be another bumper crowd.\n\nMATCH REPORT: Record-breaking home crowd flocks to watch Phoenix dazzle in 3-0 win over Western United\n\nREACTION: Durante’s bids Phoenix fans emotional farewell\n\nA-League Commissioner Greg O’Rourke said the Wellington fans had been eager to acknowledge the sacrifices made by the team in being based overseas for more than six months, away from friends and family, to allow the A-League season to go ahead.\n\n“What we’ve learned more than ever over the past year is how vital fans are to football, and to see so many in Sky Stadium was a reminder of how electric the atmosphere can be at A-League games,” said O’Rourke.\n\n“New Zealanders are passionate about their football, and we’re delighted that the travel bubble across the Tasman has allowed them to see their team play after so long away.”"
