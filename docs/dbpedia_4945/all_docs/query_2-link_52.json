        "text": "Support for Wellington Phoenix has officially hit fever pitch, with confirmation of a soldout Sky Stadium for Saturday's A-League semi-final return leg against Melbourne Victory.\n\nNZ-based fans are unable to purchase tickets, with the stadium at its capacity of 34,500. Just a couple of hundred tickets reserved for the travelling Australian contingent remain available.\n\nThe club is pursuing its first-ever spot in the A-League Grand Final, entering the match off the back of a 0-0 draw in the first leg at Melbourne.\n\nThe match looks certain to eclipse the Phoenix's previous attendance record of 33,000, set when they hosted their only previous trip to the final four in 2010.\n\n\"I was part of the COVID game, and I want to beat that and the game in Auckland against Perth,\" said coach Giancarlo Italiano. \"Fantastic atmospheres, but I'd love for the fans to come and sing for the whole 90, and get us over the line.\"\n\nPhoenix captain Alex Rufer says playing in front of a full house means a huge amount to the players.\n\n\"We deserve it, Wellington deserves it and it would be awesome for the club,\" Rufer said. \"We've really given it everything this year and hopefully we get a good crowd to show us that they support us too.\"\n\nThe winners will play either defending champions Central Coast Mariners or Sydney FC in the final. Mariners beat Sydney 2-1 at Sydney in the first leg of their semi.\n\nThe second semi between those two sides at Gosford on Saturday night is also a sellout.\n\nJoin Newshub at 6:30pm Saturday for live updates of the Phoenix v Victory A-League semi"
