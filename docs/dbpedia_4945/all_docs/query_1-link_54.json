They have one of the best winning percentages in international rugby, with victory in over 85 percent of their Tests.\n\nThe Black Ferns successful 2017 season was a landmark one for women’s rugby with the Black Ferns becoming the first women’s team to ever be named the World Rugby Team of the Year.\n\nIn 2022, the Black Ferns captured the imagination of Aotearoa when they lifted the Rugby World Cup on home soil for the first time. Playing in front of then world record crowd of 42,000 for women’s rugby, the Black Ferns edged England 34-31 in a thrilling final.\n\nA New Zealand women's selection first took the field in 1989 and competed at the 1991 Women's Rugby World Cup."
