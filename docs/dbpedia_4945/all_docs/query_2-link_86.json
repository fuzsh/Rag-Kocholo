        "text": "The Wellington Phoenix's A-League season has come to an end with an extra time 2-1 loss to Melbourne Victory in their semi-final second leg game in Wellington.\n\nThe game looked set to end after 90 minutes but an Oskar Zawada goal in the ninth minute of added time kept the home side in the game.\n\nIt was a frustrating night for the Phoenix and their fans who had been hoping for a first ever grand final appearance.\n\nAgainst the run of play, Victory had taken the lead in the 81st minute with Adama Traore scoring with a long range shot.\n\nThe Phoenix had dominated all aspects of the game but without a goal, until Zawada's goal which kept the fans in their seats for another 30 minutes.\n\nThe home side should have gone ahead in the 61st minute but captain Alex Rufer had his penalty, for hand ball, saved by Victory keeper Paul Izzo.\n\nThe excitement of the equalizer did not last long for the local fans with Victory substitute Chris Ikonomidis scoring from a corner in the first-half of extra time.\n\nWhile the Phoenix continued to press and get into good scoring positions, they could not find a second equaliser.\n\nThe game was there for the taking for the Phoenix who dominated across the park but not on the score sheet.\n\nInfluential Phoenix midfield Ben Old threatened the Victory goal on numerous occasions and hit the woodwork during one of many raids into the opposition area.\n\nKosta Barbarouses went close in the first half but his shot went straight to the Victory keeper.\n\nHowever, it was Traore and then Ikonomidis who broke the hearts of the sold out crowd.\n\nThe Victory spent the majority of the game feeding off scraps, but made their two efforts count and they will now contend for a fifth A-League title against either Central Coast Mariners or Sydney FC.\n\nA record season ends in disappointment for the Phoenix, they had their highest ever finish in the regular season, had their most points and wins, but did not get to challenge for that elusive first title.\n\nThe first leg in Melbourne last weekend finished 0-0.\n\nThe match was declared a sell-out on Friday, with the final attendance figure 33,297.\n\nThe other semi-final is between minor premiers Central Coast Mariners and Sydney FC with the Mariners leading 2-1 after the first leg.\n\nPhoenix coach Giancarlo Italiano named an unchanged lineup from the first leg; Alex Paulsen GK, Finn Surman, Scott Wootton, Tim Payne, Kosta Barbarouses, Ben Old, David Ball, Bozhidar Kraev, Alex Rufer, Nicholas Pennington and Sam Sutton.\n\nAgainst them were Victory's Paul Izzo, Jason Geria, Adama Traore, Damien Da Silva, Bruno Fornaroli, Nishan Velupillay, Daniel Arzani, Roderick Miranda, Ryan Teague, Jordi Valadon, Roly Bonevacia."
