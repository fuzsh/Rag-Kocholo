        "text": "Frank Catrickes\n\n, CFA, CMT\n\nEquity Portfolio Manager\n\nFor me, choosing to come to Wellington Management was an excellent career decision. I had received my undergraduate degree and was certain that I wanted to be a portfolio manager. I could not have imagined that my career would unfold here as it has. At Wellington Management, you can have an impact even from day one. As my role evolved, I began taking on increased responsibility relatively quickly. We have a merit-based culture where there is no predefined career track. In fact, I could have taken a number of paths but chose to stay true to my original goal. Portfolio managers and analysts here are given autonomy and flexibility to do their jobs the way they feel is best. The environment at Wellington Management is great as well — I have to say that I love coming to work every day.\n\nDanny Sharp\n\nDirector of Alternatives, Americas\n\nWellington Management is a great place to have a long-term career. I am British, and before I joined the firm, I worked for large American companies in London and then ran an independent investment boutique in Chicago. Managing a territory for Wellington Management from our Chicago office is like the marriage of both environments. It’s like running your own business but with the tremendous resources, teamwork and backing of a premier firm. Wellington Management is an elite firm without being elitist. We are collegial and we’re competitive, but not with each other. Everyone is vested in the success of their colleagues. When you have an idea or solution for a client, you seek a wider audience because you know your colleagues will add valuable new dimensions to your thinking. The company is focused on equipping its people to succeed. Here, I get support, autonomy and trust rather than short-term sales targets. This is a great place to work if you love investments; you’ll find a constant and diverse stream of new ideas, products and strategies. This might sound like I’m exaggerating, but I have never enjoyed my career as I do now. It’s as though everything I did prior to joining Wellington Management was preparing me to work here.\n\nCindy Marrs\n\nDirector, Global Financial Intermediaries Group\n\nEverything you hear about Wellington Management’s culture is true on a global scale. At each of our locations around the world, we emphasise professionalism, collaboration and diversity. At the same time, each office has a unique local culture and sense of pride. My role is global in scope, and I can see how each regional office values the freedom they have to serve clients in the ways they believe are best. As one of the individuals who helped build the firm’s London operation, I witnessed firsthand how collaboration among our various groups helps people succeed. We were given the time, support and resources to develop our vision and produce results. Here, intellectual input and teamwork are what count, not what your title is or where you came from. Wellington Management is a special organisation. I believe we are true fiduciaries of our clients’ assets. Client, Firm, Self… that’s the moral compass that guides our decision-making and helps us feel very good about what we do every day.\n\nTara Fitzgerald\n\nCompliance Manager\n\nI have been at Wellington Management since 1999 and can honestly say that I learn something new every day. The environment is highly dynamic and challenges me to think creatively. Part of that is the nature of my role as a global compliance manager and problem solver. But the other aspect is that I work with extremely intelligent people. When we collaborate on a solution, we share our ideas as well as our concerns. It’s an environment where you can be confident expressing yourself. There are abundant career opportunities for people at Wellington Management. I have moved in and out of various roles, constantly challenging myself in new areas. I am allowed to test my ideas and run with them. To a large extent, you control your destiny by the contributions you make. If you want to be constantly challenged, if you want to grow and learn, you can be very successful at Wellington Management.\n\nPatrick Eastwood\n\nDirector, Client Integration and Administration\n\nAt Wellington Management, we have a culture and environment that support personal success in two ways. First, you are encouraged to stretch beyond your comfort zone. For me, this meant taking on different roles that supported my growth and success. I have been with the firm for 16 years and am in my fifth role. I started in one area and then moved to another — and even worked for four years in one of our Asian offices — before settling in my current role back in Boston. In each different role, I was encouraged and supported to develop and apply my skills and talents to contribute in that area and to do what I believed would make the firm and me better. Each experience has contributed to my growth and success in the next role and has been personally and professionally rewarding. Second, the firm encourages all people here to put forward their ideas, asking us to be creative and work collaboratively to hone those ideas and implement them. I like to describe Wellington Management as an all-star team of high-calibre people who work together to win. I can honestly say that here you can do almost anything or go anywhere when you apply yourself, are open-minded and work collaboratively to achieve overall success."
