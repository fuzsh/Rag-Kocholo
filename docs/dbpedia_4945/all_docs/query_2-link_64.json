        "text": "Our 2022 back-to-back Central League Champions, Wellington Olympic, are back with Head Coach, Rupert Kemeys, ready and focused to take on another challenging year of Cups, Titles and a spot in the OFC Champions League!\n\nClub pride and glory will be pushing Rupert and his coaching team, Matt Kolic, Taylor Hall-Jones, Scoota Roche, Frank Hogan and Goal Keeper Coach Steve Dimakis, to work with the squad and preparing them for another hard and long season, and it will be up to Jimbo Mac Aodhagain and Brogan Treanor to ensure that our players are physically ready and conditioned for the battles ahead.\n\nAnd we'll continue to look to all our hardcore supporters from the sidelines to cheer them on, motivate them, and keep them positive. After all, Olympic is a huge football family, emotional, passionate and extra roudy.\n\nWith the majority of last season's players back, Olympic has also welcomed a number of new members to the team with Ben Mata continuing to wear the Captain's band.\n\nOur Central League team works closely with our Capital Premier Reserves. Over the season the team will see a number of players interchange between the two teams, allowing for our youth to progress and compete at the highest level, and for a smooth transition for the players from one team to the other in the case of injuries.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nBen joined Olympic aged 20 at the start of the 2019 season from Papakura City in the Northern League. He had previously played National League with Wellington Phoenix Reserves in 2016/17 and had represented New Zealand at Under 17 level.\n\nHe made his debut on 30th March 2019 in the 10-0 demolition of Wairarapa United in Masterton and scored his first goal in the equally emphatic 11-1 win against Wellington United in the following match on 6th April 2019 at Wakefield Park.\n\nHe immediately became an ever present member of the team missing only four of the 67 matches Olympic played in his first three seasons. He scored three goals in 22 matches in 2019 and 5 goals in 18 matches in 2020 including a brace in an 8-1 win against Waterside Karori on 27th June 2020. Most were headers using his significant aerial presence at set pieces. During those first two seasons he played National League for Team Wellington during the summer before the National League reverted to a club based format.\n\n2021 was a watershed year as he took over the captaincy from Alex Palezevic, then the penalty duties after Hamish Watson joined the long list of players to miss a penalty in 2020 and 2021, played his 50th match in the 2-3 loss to North Wellington at Wakefield on 12th June 2021 before finishing the season by lifting the Central League trophy as Olympic edged out arch rivals Miramar Rangers 1-0 in the league decider. In all, Ben hit home 11 penalties (with two misses) in 23 matches.\n\n2022 was another successful year as Ben gained his first international cap for the Cook Islands in their Oceania World Cup qualifier in Qatar before the team had to withdraw due to Covid. He captained Olympic to the Chatham Cup semi-finals, to their first ever National League final and once again lifted the Central League trophy. Despite losing first call on penalty duties to Kailan Gould, Ben managed 7 goals in the 30 matches played (three from the spot).\n\nOn 11th March 2023 Ben captained Olympic in their first ever Oceania Champions League Qualifier against Auckland City at Martin Luckie Park. A late collapse in the second leg in Auckland, including a red card for Ben, saw Olympic lose out on a trip to Vanuatu.\n\nOn 28th May 2023 Ben became the 34th Olympic centurion after a couple of months beset by injury and suspension. Now back on penalty duties he marked the occasion by scoring two in a 5-2 win against Western Suburbs. This is the first time someone has scored more than one goal in their 100th match. As of end May 2023 Ben has 31 goals in 100 matches (including 19 penalties) putting him 22nd on the all time goal scoring list for Olympic.\n\nCredit to Photomac for the photos"
