We are strong advocates for women's football – not because it's in vogue, but because it is very much the right and fair thing to do. Hosting no less than 5 women's teams at our club is testament to how far we've come, and we love to see other clubs making progress in the women's space too. We are not afraid to challenge the status quo, both on and off the field!\n\nWellington United provide a fantastic footballing and social environment for all of our Senior teams. Despite 'running on the smell of an oily rag' we continue to think outside the box year on year to update playing kits for our social teams, provide match balls and training equipment for all, and run events where members can let their hair down and further connect with our football whānau :)\n\nWe're an awesome little club, with a colorful history and an ever-growing personality!\n\nPlayer registrations\n\nAll players MUST be registered with Wellington United before playing.\n\nTo make things easier for our players/managers, we now utilise the registration system called Friendly Manager (much easier to use than Comet)."
