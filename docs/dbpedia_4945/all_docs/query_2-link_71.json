        "text": "Get ready for Auckland FC’s inaugural season!\n\nThere will be more professional football in Auckland than ever before during the 2024/25 A-Leagues!\n\nWell, it is here Black Knights fans, the day it all starts to feel very real, the fixture list for our inaugural A-League Men’s season has finally dropped.\n\nWe will kick off the season at home with a game against the Brisbane Roar on Saturday, October 19th at 5pm. Our first ever league fixture.\n\nBut we all know there’s one (make that three) games you’ll all be looking out for – those against a certain Wellington-based club.\n\nFortunately you won’t have to wait long. On Saturday, November 2 what promises to be one of biggest sporting rivalries in New Zealand gets underway when we travel to Sky Stadium, Wellington for the first ever derby match between Auckland FC and the Wellington Phoenix.\n\nThere are also two return fixtures for fans to look forward to, with the Wellington Phoenix scheduled to play in Auckland at the GO Media Stadium, Mount Smart on Saturday, December 7 and Saturday, February 22. Both games will kick-off at 5pm.\n\nWe know you’re excited and so are we.\n\n“The fans, the players, the management team, we’re chomping at the bit to get started and I can guarantee you we’re going to be giving it our all. We’re not here to make up the numbers. As Bill Foley explained when launching the club, we’re here to win,” says Head Coach Steve Corica.\n\n“The games against the Phoenix are going to be huge, I’ve played in plenty of derbies so know what it is like, the atmosphere can be intense. But really, being our debut season, every game is a first and I suspect the fans will bring the noise whoever we’re playing.”\n\nOur central midfielder and Auckland local, Cameron Howieson agreed.\n\n“It is going to be very exciting, obviously. I know a few boys from the national team who play there and they are saying the same. Plus I’ve plenty of family and friends who want to get amongst it,” said Howieson.\n\n“I’m ready for it, the team is ready for it and I think Auckland is ready for it. It’s going to be a phenomenal season and I look forward to the fans coming out to support us.”\n\nFans will be able to enjoy at least 13 home games, the majority of them kicking off at 5pm, so if you haven’t yet sorted your membership, now really is the time.\n\n“It is all starting to feel very real. You only get one inaugural season and people are tuning in to the fact you only get one chance to be a part of that, to say ‘I was there from the beginning’”, says CEO Nick Becker.\n\nThe season consists of 29 rounds, including 3 byes for every team.\n\nAuckland FC will play a total of 26 matches during the 2023-24 season. Out of these, 13 will be home games at GO Media Stadium in Auckland.\n\nThe complete season schedule is below:\n\nROUND 1: HOME\n\n19th Oct | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Brisbane Roar\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 2: HOME\n\n27th Oct | 4pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Sydney FC\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 3: AWAY\n\n02nd Nov | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Wellington Phoenix\n\nAway – Sky Stadium\n\nROUND 4: BYE\n\nROUND 5: AWAY (Unite Round)\n\n24 Nov | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Macarthur FC\n\nAway – Allianz Stadium\n\nROUND 6: HOME\n\n30 Nov | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Newcastle Jets\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 7: HOME\n\n07 Dec | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Wellington Phoenix\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 8: AWAY\n\n15 Dec | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Melbourne City\n\nAway – AAMI Park\n\nROUND 9: HOME\n\n21 Dec | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Western United\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 10: AWAY\n\n28 Dec | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Central Coast Mariners\n\nAway – Industree Group Stadium\n\nROUND 11: HOME\n\n01 Jan | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Melbourne Victory\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 12: BYE\n\nROUND 13: AWAY\n\n11 Jan | 11.45pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Perth Glory\n\nAway – HBF Park\n\nROUND 15: HOME\n\n18 Jan | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Melbourne City\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 14: AWAY\n\n22 Jan | 9.30pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Adelaide United\n\nAway – Coopers Stadium\n\nROUND 16: AWAY\n\n26 Jan | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Western Sydney Wanderers\n\nAway – CommBank Stadium\n\nROUND 17: HOME\n\n01 Feb | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Macarthur FC\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 18: BYE\n\nROUND 19: AWAY\n\n15 Feb | 8pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Western United\n\nAway – Ironbark Fields\n\nROUND 20: HOME\n\n22 Feb | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Wellington Phoenix\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 21: HOME\n\n01 Mar | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Adelaide United\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 22: AWAY\n\n09 Mar | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Newcastle Jets\n\nAway – McDonald Jones Stadium\n\nROUND 23: HOME\n\n16 Mar | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Central Coast Mariners\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 24: AWAY\n\n30 Mar | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Brisbane Roar\n\nAway – Suncorp Stadium\n\nROUND 25: HOME\n\n05 Apr | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Western Sydney Wanderers\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 26: AWAY\n\n12 Apr | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Sydney FC\n\nAway – Allianz Stadium\n\nROUND 27: AWAY\n\n19 Apr | 7pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Melbourne Victory\n\nAway – AAMI Park\n\nROUND 28: HOME\n\n27 Apr | 5pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Perth Glory\n\nHome – GO Media Stadium\n\nROUND 29: AWAY\n\n03 May | 8pm\n\nAuckland FC vs. Western United\n\nAway – Ironbark Fields\n\nAdd all our fixtures to your calendar!\n\n(home games in bold, all kick-off times in NZT).\n\nAs per the previous season, the top six sides will qualify for the Isuzu UTE A-League 2025 Finals Series which will start on the weekend of 9-11 May, with the Grand Final to be played on the weekend of 30 May – 1 June.\n\nAs well as entry to the game, members will be entitled to a number of additional benefits including a free gift, discounts on merchandise and special experiences.\n\n“We’re also planning a few very special experiences for our fans who want to travel to away games so stay tuned for those,” added Becker."
