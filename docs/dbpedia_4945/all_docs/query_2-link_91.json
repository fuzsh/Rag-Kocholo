        "text": "The U.S. Women’s National Team will kick off a massive 2023 in Wellington/Te Whanganui-a-Tara, New Zealand, taking on the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup co-host Football Ferns at Sky Stadium. The game will kick off on Jan. 18 at 4 p.m. local NZT, which will be 10 p.m. ET on Jan. 17 back in the United States and will be available for viewing stateside on HBO Max, with pre-game coverage beginning at 9:30 p.m. ET and post-game coverage to follow.\n\nThe 2023 opener in Wellington, which will serve as the host city and venue for the USA’s second group stage match against the Netherlands during this summer’s World Cup, will be the first of two meetings between the USA and New Zealand during this trip Down Under. The teams will meet again three days later in Auckland/Tāmaki Makaurau for a showdown at the renowned Eden Park, New Zealand’s National Stadium. Kickoff for the second match is slated for 4 p.m. NZT on Jan. 21 (10 p.m. ET on Jan. 20; HBO Max).\n\nFans will also be able to follow the action via Twitter (@USWNT), Instagram (@USWNT), Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.\n\nUSWNT DETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB; CAPS/GOALS)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Adrianna Franch (Kansas City Current), Casey Murphy (North Carolina Courage), Alyssa Naeher (Chicago Red Stars)\n\nDEFENDERS (8): Alana Cook (OL Reign), Emily Fox (Racing Louisville FC), Crystal Dunn (Portland Thorns FC), Naomi Girma (San Diego Wave FC), Sofia Huerta (OL Reign), Hailie Mace (Kansas City Current), Becky Sauerbrunn (Portland Thorns FC), Emily Sonnett (OL Reign)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC), Lindsey Horan (Olympique Lyon, FRA), Taylor Kornieck (San Diego Wave FC), Rose Lavelle (OL Reign), Kristie Mewis (NJ/NY Gotham FC), Ashley Sanchez (Washington Spirit), Andi Sullivan (Washington Spirit)\n\nFORWARDS (6): Ashley Hatch (Washington Spirit), Alex Morgan (San Diego Wave FC), Midge Purce (NJ/NY Gotham FC), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Mallory Swanson (Chicago Red Stars), Lynn Williams (NJ/NY Gotham FC)\n\nThe 24-player roster called up for this trip features 21 players who participated in the USA’s November Training Camp and matches against Germany at the end of 2022. The USWNT will be without forwards Sophia Smith and Megan Rapinoe for these games, both of whom scored in the November friendlies against Germany, as both are coming back from minor injuries. Defender Emily Sonnett and forward Lynn Williams return to the roster after missing significant time in 2022 due to injury while forward Midge Purce also is back in camp for the USWNT.\n\nThirteen players on this roster saw action in the most recent meeting between the USWNT and New Zealand, which came on Feb. 20 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif. During the 2022 SheBelieves Cup. Ashley Hatch and Mallory Swanson, formerly Pugh who will now be playing under her married name, both scored in the win as the Americans also forced three New Zealand own goals in the 5-0 victory.\n\nRUN THROUGH DOWN UNDER\n\nThis January camp, which will market the first ever games for the USWNT in New Zealand, provides the USWNT with the unique and invaluable experience of getting to stay and train in the city in which it will base camp during the World Cup, as the USA will be based in Auckland/Tāmaki Makaurau for the duration of the group stage.\n\nThe USA will also get to play at both its World Cup group stage venues this month, as Sky Stadium, which will be known as Wellington Regional Stadium during the World Cup due to sponsorship regulations, will be the site of the USA’s second Group E match against the Netherlands on July 27 (kickoff at 1 p.m. NZT; 8 p.m. ET on July 26 in the USA). The USA’s World Cup opening match against Vietnam (July 22 at 1 p.m. NZT; 8 p.m. ET on July 21) and third group stage match against the Group A Playoff Winner (Aug. 1 at 7 p.m. NZT; 3 a.m. ET) will both be staged at Eden Park in Auckland.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, the USA also had the opportunity to experience travel and training in the World Cup host country, holding its January camp in France and opening the 2019 schedule with a match against 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup hosts France in Le Havre.\n\nSERIES HISTORY: USA vs. NEW ZEALAND\n\nThe USA and New Zealand have played 19 times previously with the USWNT leading the overall series 17-1-1. The lone loss for the Americans came in a 1-0 defeat during the first meeting between the teams on Dec. 15, 1987. Since then, the USA is unbeaten in the last 18 head-to-head matchups with the Football Ferns, scoring five or more goals in each of the last four meetings. The teams drew 1-1 during a friendly in October of 2013.\n\nThe most recent meeting between the teams came 11 months ago at the 2022 SheBelieves Cup, a 5-0 victory for the Americans in Carson, Calif on Feb. 20, 2022, behind goals from Hatch and Swanson and three New Zealand own goals. Prior to that, the teams squared off in the group stage of the delayed 2020 Olympics, a 6-1 victory for the Americans as Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Christen Press and Alex Morgan scored while the USA forced the Football Ferns into two own goals.\n\nThe meeting during the Tokyo Olympics marked the fourth consecutive Olympics in which the USA and New Zealand have squared off, a streak that began during group stage play in 2008.\n\nTHE WORLD CUP AWAITS\n\nThe 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup will kick off on July 20 as co-host New Zealand takes on Norway in Auckland/Tāmaki Makaurau. An hour later, co-host Australia opens against the Republic of Ireland in Sydney/Gadigal. The full tournament schedule along with kickoff times can be found here.\n\nThe USA, which has qualified for every FIFA Women’s World Cup in history and will be seeking to lift the trophy for a fifth time, will face World Cup debutant Vietnam, Netherlands and the Group A Playoff Winner -- either Portugal, Thailand or Cameroon -- in Group E, playing the entirety of the group stage in New Zealand. The U.S. will open Group E play against Vietnam on July 22 at Eden Park in Auckland/Tāmaki Makaurau and then face the Netherlands on July 27 at Wellington Regional Stadium – also known as Sky Stadium - in Wellington/Te Whanganui-a-Tara, marking the first time in FIFA Women’s World Cup history that the two finalists from the previous tournament will meet in group play. The USA will then close out the group stage against the Group A Playoff Winner on Aug. 1 at Eden Park in Auckland/Tāmaki Makaurau.\n\nThe Inter-Confederation Playoffs will determine the final three qualification spots for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, including the USA’s final opponent for the group stage. The ten-team playoff tournament will take place in New Zealand from February 17-23, 2023, and features ten nations split into three groups, with the winner of each group qualifying for the Women's World Cup. Group A will feature Cameroon against Thailand on Feb. 18 with the winner taking on Portugal for a berth to the World Cup on Feb. 22.\n\nAUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND 2023 GROUPS\n\nGroup A: New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Switzerland\n\nGroup B: Australia, Ireland, Nigeria and Canada\n\nGroup C: Spain, Costa Rica, Zambia and Japan\n\nGroup D: England, Group B Playoff Winner, Denmark and China PR\n\nGroup E: USA, Vietnam, Netherlands and the Group A Playoff Winner\n\nGroup F: France, Colombia, Jamaica, Brazil and the Group C Playoff Winner\n\nGroup G: Sweden, South Africa, Italy and Argentina\n\nGroup H: Germany, Morocco, Colombia and Korea Republic\n\nSingle match passes are available between now and March 3rd via FIFA’s ticketing portal on a first come, first serve basis.

New Zealand made a fourth consecutive appearance at the Olympics last summer, having qualified for every Olympic Games since its debut in 2008, and will play in its fifth consecutive World Cup in the summer of 2023.\n\nAlmost the entirety of NZL’s roster plays club soccer outside the country and they are spread across the world in Australia, the USA, Scotland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Finland. As these matches are taking place outside a FIFA window, the Ferns are missing a few regular call-ups, but still have a selection of highly experienced players.\n\nTeam captain Ali Riley, who plays for Angel City FC in the NWSL, is the most experienced Fern on the roster with 147 caps and two goals. Riley, who grew up in Southern California and attended Stanford, has spent most of her pro career overseas, spending about seven years in Sweden, one Germany and one in England, she returned the USA to play for the Orlando Pride and was traded to Angel City FC before last season.\n\nStarting goalkeeper Erin Nayler, who plays for IFK Norrköping in Sweden and has 78 caps, has had several excellent games against the USA over the years.\n\nVeteran midfielder and former California Golden Bear Betsy Hassett (137/14) earned her 100th cap against the USA during the match in 2017 in Colorado. Hassett played with U.S. forward Alex Morgan at Cal.\n\nMidfielder Daisy Cleverly played college soccer at UC Berkeley and Georgetown and now plays professionally in Denmark.\n\nFive players on this New Zealand roster are currently playing college soccer in the USA including Gabi Rennie of Arizona State who scored in New Zealand’s 2-1 loss to Australia at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan. Rennie was a part of the New Zealand U-17 team which made history by winning NZL’s first medal at a FIFA Word Cup with a third-place finish at the 2018 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup. Two other players on this roster, defender Mackenzie Barry and midfielder Grace Wisnewski, were also on that team.\n\nHead coach Jitka Klimkova was the head coach for the U.S. U-20 WYNT during the 2020 World Cup cycle and was also head coach U.S. U-19s as well as head scout for the U.S. team at the 2018 FIFA U-20 WWC in Papua New Guinea."
