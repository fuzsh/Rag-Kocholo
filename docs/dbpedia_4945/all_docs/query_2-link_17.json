I want to recognise how hard the team and all the staff have worked to give fans a spectacular season. Now it’s time for Wellington to do the same! Let’s all get along to the semi-final and show the team how proud we are.”\n\n“We know the difference a big parochial Wellington crowd makes to the players,” comments David Dome, General Manager of the Wellington Phoenix. “Given what the team has achieved this season, they deserve the support of all Wellingtonians. It’s been nine long years since we last had a home finals game and this promises to be a truly unforgettable night. Make sure you’re there to cheer the team on to its first ever grand final!”\n\nNew Zealand got behind the Warriors in 2023, now it’s time to get behind the Nix in 2024.\n\nTickets go on sale at 1.00pm on Thursday 2 May through Ticketek, with three pricing categories available to choose from, plus two bays dedicated to the Yellow Fever and one family bay.
