        "text": "Swim Teams\n\nOur program is divided up into sub-groups, based on ability and age. Please note that the following are only guidelines, they are not absolute. We will place each swimmer into the group that is best for them, based on their ability and age. Just because a swimmer ages up, does not mean they are ready for the next group. Each child develops differently and at different times. The physical and mental maturity of each athlete is taken into consideration.\n\nRed\n\nFor our novice swimmers\n\nBronze\n\nFor our intermediate swimmers\n\nSilver\n\nFor our advanced swimmers 8 - 13yr -Full capacity\n\nSr. Silver\n\nFor our intermediate swimmers 13 & Up.\n\nGold\n\nFor our advanced senior swimmers 13 & Up.\n\nProgram\n\nThe coaches use the following criteria for placing swimmers in groups.\n\nAge: Swimmers are grouped by age and skill levels.\n\nPerformance: Swimmers are grouped by ability.\n\nTechniques: As the swimmer progresses, it is expected that he/she will be prepared to work on and master the finer points of stroke technique, starts, turns and race strategy.\n\nAbility to train: The swimmer must demonstrate he/she will be able to handle the training load of the new group. Ability to meet the group standard is important for the self-image and confidence of the swimmer. If there is a doubt, the swimmer will be placed in a lower group with the opportunity to move up.\n\nAttendance: Swimming requires commitment to practice schedules and meet participation. As a swimmer moves up the competitive ladder, there are more practices of longer duration. If a swimmer does not attend practice on a regular basis, he/she is less able to improve performance.\n\nAttitude: While swimming performance is expected to improve over the long run, in the short run there will be ups and downs. As the swimmer moves up the competitive ladder, he/she must be able to handle the stresses of intense training and competition and also balance swimming with other aspects of life (school and extracurricular activities).\n\nMovement: Movement from one group to another is based on meeting the criteria for the next group. In other words, it is a combination of age, performance, technique, ability to train, attendance and attitude; not age or performance alone. Achieving the time standards or workout sets does not necessarily mean movement to the next group, but means that the swimmer is eligible to be considered for the group. Most changes are made at the end of the long course season (July), but there may be changes made in December and after the Short Course season (March).\n\nAdditional Training/Private Coaching\n\nThese sessions are designed to provide the swimmer with intense instruction in a one on one environment for the swimmer and coach. The focus in these sessions is on skill/stroke work, not fitness development. Video analysis may be used to provide precise breakdown of each stroke and recommended improvements. Sessions are 30 minutes in length. Private lessons are arranged upon request."
