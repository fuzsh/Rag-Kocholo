        "text": "Sky Stadium (non-commercially known as Wellington Stadium) is located in Wellington, New Zealand, and has a total capacity of 34,500, with a large majority of those undercover. Since it opened in 2000, the stadium has played host to many sports including Rugby Union, Rugby League, Cricket, Soccer and even Australian Rules Football. The stadium has a single level of yellow seats surrounding the whole arena with corporate boxes under the stadium roof. It has quality lighting, two video screens and a lot of space under the stands so the venue can host exhibitions and other similar events.\n\nSky Stadium has 64 corporate boxes holding 1,281 people, plus a large superbox bringing the total capacity to almost 36,000. Temporary seating can boost this even higher to around 40,000. Westpac ended its naming-rights of the stadium at the end of 2019, at which time it was renamed Sky Stadium after the broadcaster purchased the commercial rights in a six year deal. During the Rugby World Cup, the venue was known as Wellington Regional Stadium."
