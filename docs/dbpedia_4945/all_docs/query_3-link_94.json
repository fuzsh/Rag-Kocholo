        "text": "The draw for the knockout stage of the OFC Champions League has been confirmed and has placed the New Zealand representatives, Auckland City and Team Wellington, on a collision course if they can progress past the quarter-finals.\n\nThe official draw was held at the OFC Academy in Auckland, New Zealand on Monday, outlining the quarter final match-ups, the semi-finals and final for this year’s edition of Oceania’s premier club competition.\n\nOFC Competitions Director Chris Kemp said following four entertaining groups, the knockout stage of the OFC Champions League is also set to delight fans.\n\n“We experienced excellent engagement from fans who followed the group stage and we’re delighted that so many have expressed their excitement ahead of the knockout stage,” Kemp said.\n\n“The draw has set up some really exciting encounters with most of the quarter-final teams set to meet for the first time in the competition. We look forward to the OFC Champions League getting back underway, after the international break, in early April.”\n\nTeam Wellington, who topped Group D in Honiara at the weekend, will welcome Papua New Guinea club champions and Group A runners-up Lae City Dwellers to Wellington.\n\nSolomon Warriors, runners-up in Group B, will again find themselves on the road as they also travel to New Zealand to play reigning champions Auckland City at Kiwitea Street.\n\nAS Dragon, who won their group on home soil in Tahiti, will once again enjoy home advantage when they take on Fiji club Lautoka, who finished behind Auckland City in Group C.\n\nFinally, Group A winners and the only competition debutants still in action, Vanuatu’s Nalkutan will welcome Group D runners-up Marist, who will be on the road for the first time after hosting their group at Lawson Tama Stadium in the Solomon Islands.\n\nAdding intrigue to this year’s competition for fans is the semi-final and final.\n\nAfter two years of the same four semi-finalists and three editions of Auckland City and Team Wellington in the final, Monday's draw, and the earlier elimination of AS Magenta of New Caledonia, ensured this won’t be the case in 2018.\n\nOne of the semi-finals will feature the winners of quarter-finals one and two – the two which feature the New Zealand teams. Should they beat their respective opponents in the one-off quarter-final matches at home, the Kiwi teams would then meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThe other semi-final will feature the winners of the matches between Dragon and Lautoka, and Nalkutan and Marist.\n\nFinally, the winner of the second semi-final will host the first leg of the final before travelling to their opponent’s ground for the second leg which will take place in May."
