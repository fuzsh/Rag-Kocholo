        "text": "On Aug. 5, Johnnie Kinter shared the perspective on Wellington’s Football Night at Duke Stadium that he was once the kid in middle school who joined the high school team’s practice.\n\n“It is pretty crazy that now I am a senior and I am leading all of these little kids and the underclassmen,” he said. “I know when I was their age, I was looking up to high schoolers and I thought it was the coolest thing ever.”\n\nAfter understanding the importance of his presence, which extends beyond sports, the wide receiver and baseball All-Ohioan is ready to give it his all for his final football season.\n\n“Being an athlete is not easy, especially being a multi-sport athlete. The example that (Kinter) sets is first-class,” Wellington coach Rob Howells said. “He is here when he can be. He might have to leave early or stay late, because he has baseball. As a coach, you have to live with that with multi-sport athletes, and I want multi-sport athletes.”\n\nKinter was a Division III All-Ohio honorable mention in baseball and a D-VI third-team All-Ohioan on the gridiron.\n\n“(Kinter) always had that athleticism,” Howells said. “I always say that even in his freshman year on the basketball (court). He doesn’t even play basketball anymore and you saw that. He wasn’t the only one. You saw that out of Baron Turner (Jr.) too as well. He is going to be featured a lot this year. It is nice to see those guys live up to those expectations that you have forecasted on a young player.”\n\nHe achieved that while Wellington adjusted its system to the personnel it has, going from the ground game to a spread offense.\n\nThe 2024 season will have more experienced offensive linemen, which means the Dukes will shift back to the running game with Turner Jr. in the backfield. Though Kinter was a wide receiver, he is expected to become one of the ball carriers in their rushing attack.\n\n“My nose has been in the playbook for about every day for the past week and a couple of months,” Kinter said. “I picked up a couple of different positions. I have to learn everything that I can about that and help the team win.”\n\nAccording to Howells, Kinter has taken the adjustment well. He and his staff have a plan to get him the ball.\n\n“Offensively, we are moving (Kinter) around. We might be able to empty the box. There are a lot of teams who would high-low him and send two guys at him,” he said. “If we can get an extra guy out of the box, we set him out wide, get him in motion and hand him the ball in different ways. This is going to help us be more dynamic, diverse and harder to game plan for.”\n\nKinter was a member of the T3 Rua U17 team, which took up much of his time playing baseball, including out-of-state tournaments. Now that travel ball has ended, he is putting all of his efforts into football.\n\nWellington did not have the season it wanted in 2023, finishing 2-8 (1-5 LC8), but the team is adamant to show improvement.\n\nIn 2023, Kinter led the Dukes with 483 receiving yards and four touchdown receptions. He also starred at cornerback on defense.\n\n“(Kinter) makes us a completely different team,” Howells said. “His ability to shut down one side of the field, makes us able to send more pressure and play more man-coverage.”"
