It sits on a totara wharf built in the 1860s then known as ‘deep water wharf’. The design of the building takes its inspiration from the many wharf buildings that once stood along Wellington’s waterfront. The ‘Queen’s Bond’ warehouse was built in 1862 and stood where the Arena does now. It was the centre of Wellington’s thriving sea trade from the 1880s to the 1930s, exporting meat, cheese, apples and pears, coal, wool, tallow and flax. It became TSB Arena in 2006.\n\nA multi-use venue\n\nThe arena hosts many sports games and is the home arena for the Wellington Saints and Te Wānanga O Raukawa Pulse.\n\nThe TSB Arena hosts annual public exhibitions, gala dinners, cultural fairs, and the annual World of Wearable Art Awards (WOW). Originally designed to hold 3,635 people, it was redeveloped and expanded in 2005 to seat 4,570.\n\nTSB Arena also operates as a music venue and regularly attracts overseas acts. Previous concerts include Ed Sheeran, The 1975, OneRepublic, Six60, David Byrne, The Killers and comedy acts such as Michael McIntyre\n\nHire TSB Arena\n\nThe TSB Arena is Wellington’s biggest indoor venue.
