Teams that do not have a representative present at a managers meeting will forfeit all scheduled games on the first date they were scheduled. Make sure your team is registered for the appropriate league and skill level. Recreation Staff and Officials will closely monitor games and teams may be required to change leagues. Please note that there are no refunds given after conclusion of registration period.\n\nRegistration"
