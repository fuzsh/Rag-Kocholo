        "text": "Photo Credit: OFC Media via Phototek\n\nThe second team to represent Oceania at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics has been named, with the New Zealand Men’s Olympic Football team confirmed.\n\nThe 18-player squad includes ten who were part of the OFC Men’s Nation’s Cup-winning New Zealand side last month.\n\nUnder the men’s football competition regulations, Olympic squads are limited to 18 players, at least 15 of whom must be aged 23 and under, with three overage players permitted. Joe Bell, Michael Boxall, and Sarpreet Singh have been selected as the overage contingent.\n\nHead Coach Darren Bazeley is excited to assemble his young side in France:\n\n“The Olympics is a special tournament, so it is great to name the side that will be heading over to Paris 2024 as part of the wider New Zealand Team. With the competition happening outside of a FIFA window, there have been some challenges with clubs releasing players, who are all really keen to be part of the tournament, but that is an issue that numerous countries have faced.\n\n“Over half of this group were part of the All Whites squad that won the OFC Men’s Nations Cup last month, so we are looking to continue that momentum when we get to France.\n\n“This is a rare opportunity for us to test ourselves against some top teams, especially the hosts France in our final group game, and I know all of the players are massively excited and proud to be representing Aotearoa New Zealand.”\n\nNew Zealand Men’s Olympic Football Team squad:\n\nGoalkeepers:\n\nAlex Paulsen – AFC Bournemouth, England\n\nKees Sims – GAIS Göteborg, Sweden\n\nDefenders:\n\nTyler Bindon – Reading FC, England\n\nMichael Boxall* – Minnesota United, USA\n\nLukas Kelly-Heald – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nMatthew Sheridan – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nFinn Surman – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nSam Sutton – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nMidfielders:\n\nJoe Bell* – Viking FK, Norway\n\nFin Conchie – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nMatt Garbett – NAC Breda, Netherlands\n\nBen Old – AS Saint-Etienne, France\n\nSarpreet Singh* – Unattached\n\nForwards:\n\nRiley Bidois – Loudoun United, USA\n\nJay Herdman – Vancouver Whitecaps, Canada\n\nJesse Randall – Auckland FC, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nOskar van Hattum – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nBen Waine – Plymouth Argyle, England\n\n*Players aged over 23\n\nTravelling reserves:\n\nLachlan Bayliss – Newcastle Jets, Australia\n\nLiam Gillion – Auckland FC, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nHenry Gray – Ipswich Town FC, England\n\nIsaac Hughes – Wellington Phoenix, Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nThe men’s team has been drawn in Group A at the tournament alongside hosts France, Guinea, and the USA.\n\nTheir Paris 2024 campaign begins against Guinea on Thursday 25 July (KO 3 am NZT) in Nice, before facing the USA on Sunday 28 July (KO 5 am NZT), and France on Wednesday, 31 July (KO 5 am NZT), both in Marseille."
