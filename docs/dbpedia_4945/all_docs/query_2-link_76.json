If your family qualifies for the Free & Reduced Lunch Program, you can have athletic fees waived by completing the waivers in your Parent Vue account.\n\nPlease ensure an updated physical is on file with the Athletics Office. Physicals are valid for 365 days and can be used for all sports within that time.\n\nStudents will need to pick up an Orange Card from the Athletics Administrative Assistant at WMHS and give it to their coach before participating in their first official practice or tryout."
