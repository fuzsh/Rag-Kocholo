Wellington United Men's Premier Team

Men's Premier League

At Wellington United our men's side of the club has been in a rebuilding phase over the last couple of seasons. With a rich history steeped in Wellington Football we are excited by the prospect of returning back to the top flight!

After returning to the Premier League at the end of 2019; we knew we needed to take stock of the team, and strategise to ensure that we retained our place within the Premier League.

We entrusted the rebuild of the Men's club to top Argentinian Football Coach Guillermo Schiltenwolf. 2020 saw a lot of change; and encouragingly we saw our lads start to turn their fortunes around; to where they took points from almost every team in the league!

2021 has seen the team continue to build on this momentum. They have been at the upper end of the table for much of the season, and now hold their destiny in their own hands. The team is determined to pick up at least 3 points from their final two games of the season to secure a play-off spot for the Central League!

The trust and fluidity within the team is a real strength. Players play for each other and they are really exciting to watch. Just as Guille has helped to instill with the Diamonds, there is a real sense of family and unity. They are creative on attack and strong on defence; they are a very hard team for opposition teams to face and we love it! They are a pleasure to follow week in week out and we are extremely proud of the team. They deserve every success that comes to them.

We would like to acknowledge the team behind the scenes! Guille is ably assisted by his right hand man, Carlos Junca, and manager extraordinaire Justine Empson.
