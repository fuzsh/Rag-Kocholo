        "text": "BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's major Tibetan website www.tibet.cn has published a harsh commentary which criticizes the 14th Dalai Lama for instigating self-immolation and advocating Nazi-style racial segregation ideas.\n\nThe following is the full text of the commentary.\n\nEditor's Note: It is a universal rule that all religions and their sects should forbid murdering and telling lies, and protect the interests of the country and its people. Tibetan Buddhism is no exception.\n\nIt is also a rule of Buddhism and a common understanding that life should be cherished and truth should be respected. However, reviewing some remarks and actions of the 14th Dalai Lama in recent years, the writer cannot help raising some questions to him.\n\nQ1: Why the Dalai Lama deliberately incite Tibetans for self-immolation?\n\nThe Dalai Lama called on Tibetans not to celebrate Losar so as to memorize \"the fallen heroes of Tibet\" in Dharamsala India on Feb.22.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is deliberately encouraging Tibetans to self-immolate since he appealed to all Tibetans not to celebrate Losar in memorial of self-immolators.\n\nIt's been thousands of years for Tibetans to celebrate Tibetan New Year, which is an important carrier of Tibetan culture, customs and emotions. Tibetans are able to obtain the great soul from Losar after a year of hard work.\n\nHowever, \"self-immolation\" is an extreme way to end one's life. In the modern age, any group or force encouraging self-immolation for their illegal purposes in any place is bound to be condemned.\n\nUN declaration on measures to eliminate international terrorism declared that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular communities for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.\n\nFrom \"3.14 Riots\" in 2008 to recent self-immolations, all those incidents were premeditated long before and happened at a price of ordinary Tibetans' peaceful life and even lives?\n\nThere is a saying in Buddhism: \"Saving one life is better than build a seven-storey pagoda\". Looking back, how many young lives have been terminated due to the Dalai Lama's bewitching. Even if the Dalai Lama build hundreds of thousands of temples, it could not offset his sin in inciting repeated self-immolations of young monks.\n\nQ2: Who extinguishes Tibetan culture?\n\nIn November 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama acclaimed in Japan that the reason for Tibetan monks' self-immolations was \"China's policy on extinguishing Tibetan culture\".\n\nAs to \"Tibetan culture\", the Dalai Lama follows such a logic: Tibetan culture is the culture of Tibetan Buddhism, the culture of Tibetan Buddhism is the culture of the Gelug Sect (the yellow sect of Tibetan Buddhism, and the sect of the Dalai Lama) while the Dalai Lama has the final speaking in the Gelug Sect.\n\nIn other words, anything that goes against the Dalai Lama is regarded by him as \"extirpation of Tibetan culture\". What a ridiculous idea! The Dalai Lama still treats himself as the serf owner, Tibet as his property and Tibetan people as his slaves.\n\nA scholar has pointed out that the so-called \"extinguished Tibetan culture\" refers to the absolute privilege of the religious figures. In the Dalai Lama's eyes, the fact that common Tibetans master the culture would violate the stiff hierarchy of theocracy.\n\nIn fact, Tibetan culture consists of not only religious culture but also folk culture, not only traditional culture but also modern culture, not only the culture of the Tibetan ethnic group but also the cultures of other ethnic groups, such as Confucius culture, Mongolian culture and Manchu culture.\n\nThe religious culture has never been the only content of Tibetan culture, let alone the \"Dalai Lama's culture\" or \"Gelug culture\". The 14th Dalai Lama racks his brains to cheat the world that he develops the whole Tibetan culture if he develops the Gelug culture. What he does is the worst \"extirpation of Tibetan culture\"!\n\nIn the writer's opinion, the Dalai Lama's \"extirpation of Tibetan culture\" exposes his ugly purpose: he attempts to meet the demand of Tibetan separatists and stir up the Western forces' \"impulse to put pressure on China\" in order to realize his aim of restoring Tibet's serfdom and dividing China.\n\nQ3: Are the central government of China and Tibet in a \"Supply and Granting\" relationship?\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama claimed in his \"Reincarnation Statement\" that the \"Supply and Granting\" relationship between the central governments of Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) and Tibet didn't change even when the 13th Dalai Lama was conferred in 1879.\n\nHis statement implied that inland China and Tibet was historically in the so-called \"Supply and Granting\" relationship, and denied Tibet as an administratively subordinative region of China.\n\nReviewing the history of Qing, however, the author cannot help wondering why the Dalai Lama, known for his lineal memory of previous life, suddenly became \"amnesiac\" and denies the fact that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. The author would like to help Dalai Lama recover his memory kindly by raising some questions.\n\nSince the Dalai Lama considered the central government and Tibet had no \"Supply and Granting\" relationship when he was appointed, why was he so polite towards the central government's ministers stationed in Tibet, reporting everything and seeking for support whenever he met problems?\n\nDid he remember that he had directly reported to the emperor but was denied for bypassing the ministers stationed in Tibet?\n\nThe author believes that his previous life didn't forget these facts before he was reincarnated, and he should not suddenly lose memory. He cannot go so far as to deny those facts as a human being.\n\nHere is a piece of advice for the Dalai Lama: if there were no \"Supply and Granting\" relationship between the central government and Tibet and no drawing lot from the golden urn, the Dalai Lama and his previous life would not have existed either, let alone the \"shows\" he performed today.\n\nAt present,\"traveling through time\" is prevalent in the films and TV series. And I think the Dalai Lama should also \"travel back\" and review his previous life, and then he will tell the truth.\n\nQ4: Why did you build up a \"Berlin Wall\" of national antagonism?\n\n\"Since the Berlin Wall collapsed, the world has witnessed that despotism has no future...the world belongs to humanity, and every country belongs to its people, not a political party, nor a king or spiritual leaders\", said the Dalai Lama in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA) in July 2011, acting as if he is the \"protector\" of t he world.\n\nHowever, the author once noticed that the Dalai Lama stated in the \"Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People\" (delivered in November 2008) that \"it would be vital that\" the so-called future \"autonomous organs of self-government have the authority to regulate the residence, settlement and employment or economic activities of persons who wish to move to Tibetan areas from other parts of the PRC\". This remark is a public declaration to expel non-Tibetan residents out of Tibet.\n\nAt the same time, the Dalai Lama and his followers advocated the \"promotion of harmonious relationships between the Tibetan and Han people\" with their tongues in cheeks, colluding with some shameless scholars to organize \"Friendship Association between the Tibetan and Han people\". Through the contrast, it is evident that the Dalai Lama is a tricky liar skilled in double-dealing. His real intention of stirring up national hatred is obvious.\n\nTo be specific, the Dalai Lama was preying for support and sympathy with so-called slogan of \"autonomy\", so that the feudal serfdom can be restored one day; and in the name of \"protecting ethnic characteristics\", he was actually building up a \"Berlin Wall\" of ethnic segregation and confrontation.\n\nThe remarks of the Dalai Lama remind us of the uncontrolled and cruel Nazi during the Second World War.\n\nBehind the Dalai Lama's concepts of \"Middle Way Approach\" and \"high-level autonomy\" is actually the idea of ethnic separation.\n\nHow similar it is to the Holocaust committed by Hitler on the Jewish!\n\nQ5: Who do you speak for?\n\nOn February 10, 2010, the Dalai Lama asserted that he had responsibilities to speak for 6 million Tibetans during his trip of U.S.\n\nHe always plays tricks under the cover of doing good for Tibetans. It is doubtable that the Dalai Lama would speak on the behalf Tibetans as he is sponsored by the US and his relatives work for Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nLet us find out who does the Dalai Lama actually speaks for.\n\nThe Dalai Lama claimed himself \"son of India\" on November 22nd, 2009. To be filial to his \"father\", Dalai frequently exclaimed that the Lhoka Prefecture in Tibet belongs to India. He even said that India was better qualified for claiming Tibet's sovereignty.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is the largest serf-owner in the old Tibet. He enjoyed the obedience of officials and owned all land, livestock and serfs.\n\nThe secular Geluns who followed him fleeing to India are no exception from oppressors. Top leaders of the Dalai Clique are merely ordinary Tibetans.\n\nAs for lives of the Tibetan communities in exile, they live in poverty and misery which can not be compared with their counterparts in China. It is doubted whether the Dalai Lama could repay them.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is labeled as \"American follower\", \"Son of India\" and the formerly \"serf-owner\". He speaks for his overseas boss and the feudal serf system. Democracy and election, out of his feudal realm before, became his \"slogan\" now. What a fickle man.\n\nThere is no possibility that the Dalai Lama can serve as a qualified leader for his followers. Unless he had rewritten his gene mapping as a serf-owner and traitor, could he be the spokesman of the Tibetans, which we all know is impossible.\n\nQ6: Who are you praying for?\n\nThe Dalai Lama always says that he admires the courage of those who have died in self-immolation incidents and he will pray for them. To win the chance of being prayed by the Dalai Lama who has special religious status, his followers are in no doubt required to imitate their \"examples\". The Dalai Lama has pointed out the method: \"self-immolation'.\n\nPraying is a common thing in religion, but if it were used with despicable intention it would become curse. What is the 14th Dalai Lama actually praying for then?\n\nAt first glance, the Dalai Lama seems to have prayed a lot: he did pray for the accidents such as Japan earthquake, the tsunami in Indonesia, and Taiwan typhoon.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the interests of the United States and his other supporters, the Dalai Lama must be tight-lipped regardless of creatures being trampled on. For example, recently the US soldiers shot a dozen Afghan women and children, but the Dalai Lama dared not speak even a word. How clever he is!\n\nThe Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008 killed tens of thousands of lives instantly including many Tibetans. When some of them were not confirmed dead or alive, on May 15, the Dalai Lama visited Germany. However, he made no comment on the human catastrophe when many Tibetans were suffering physical and mental pain, nor did he express a trace of sympathy. Sources said that the Dalai Lama was in inexplicable ecstasy, showing his \"real gaffe \".\n\nWhat's more, the Dalai Lama did nothing for the quake-hit Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai Province, though he murmured a few words. It was the huge investment from central government that helped the affected Tibetans to rebuild their homes quickly.\n\nAfter all, the Dalai Lama's \"prayer\" is just a political one. He himself should know clearly whether his title of \"Nobel Peace Prize winner\" is true or false. He painted camouflage of \"blessing\", but the color is peeling off and the inside is being brought to light.\n\nQ7: Why Dalai Lama is despised by Netizens?\n\nBefore each self-immolation, it was always accompanied by activities such as \"religious affairs\" or \"assemble meeting\" organized by the Dalai Clique. The Chinese netizens gave an insight into the case.\n\nNetizens said the Dalai Lama and his followers who were all religious figures had intervened in politics. It should not be allowed by any civilized society.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's motive is clear: to restore the feudal serfdom system in Tibet under the cloak of \"democracy\", \"election\" and \"peace\" with helps from his foreign partners.\n\nNeither the history nor the people would agree.\n\nThe netizens' voices generally represent the public opinions. We wonder if the Dalai Lama is aware of the fact that he is despised by the public.\n\nThe Dalai Lama isn't worth of worship. He has never felt contented for his super privilege as head of the feudal serfdom society. So today it is impossible for the monk to \"debase himself\" and join in carrying out the \"democracy\".\n\nHere, I would like to give a piece of advice to the Dalai Lama that if he continued to place himself against the country and the people, he wouldn't have a good end.\n\nDon't even think about trying to separate Tibet from China. All the 56 ethnic groups unite together here.\n\nThe following is a letter written by a netizen to the Dalai Lama and his western supporters:\n\nI ask God, \"When will Tibet be independent?\"\n\nGod answers, \"It is impossible until the earth comes to the end.\"\n\nI ask, \"Why do some people still play tricks to split China?'\"\n\nGod illustrates, \"They are ignorant, boring and inhuman.\"\n\nI am confused and ask, \"Why don't you punish them?'\"\n\nGod says, \"I am in charge of human beings' behaviors rather than domestic animals.\"\n\nI ask, \"Who will be responsible for them?'\"\n\nGod answers contemptuously, \"You'd better ask 'Miss Liberty' in US.'\"\n\n\"The white pretentious woman standing at the harbor called 'Liberty'? \"\n\n\"Yes, it is her.'\"\n\n\"Well, to be frank, I don't believe in her.\""
