        "text": "For most people, probably the first time they ever saw someone driven to self-immolation to defend their beliefs was during the Viet Nam War.\n\nBack then, a Buddhist monk by the name of Venerable Thich Quang Duc calmly entered meditation as he burned to death. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists in his country Viet Nam, and when Americans saw it, they were totally shocked by the sight. It later helped to compel the American government to withdraw their support for the Vietnamese government of the time.\n\nOver the years, this method of protest has been adopted by the Tibetans but unfortunately, with much less success. In the case of Venerable Duc, it only took one monk to trouble the American President’s conscience – upon seeing the photo of Venerable Duc self-immolating, President John F. Kennedy remarked that,\n\n“…no news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one.”\n\nYet with the Tibetans, 152 have taken their own lives and still the international community remains unmoved. To me, this is extremely sad. Buddhists are taught that one of our core precepts is to refrain from killing, no matter how big or small the life. If you remember the movie Kundun, one of the famous scenes was that of Tibetans picking out worms from the soil as they constructed the Dalai Lama’s movie theatre in Tibet. So I would have expected Tibetans, who are Buddhist by culture and birth, to abide by this very strongly. The fact so many Tibetans can overlook one of their cardinal percepts leads me to think a couple of things:\n\nNo one educated them that the self-immolations are not gaining the desired effect. They have somehow become misinformed (whether deliberately or not) into thinking the world will one day react once enough self-immolations occur.\n\nThere is a dilution in the importance the new generation places on their Buddhist culture and values. They are giving up centuries-held culturally-ingrained precepts, in favour of short-term political goals.\n\nYet, none of this confuses me as much as why the Tibetan leadership have remained absolutely silent over the matter. How can any leadership with a conscience allow their people to keep taking their own lives, and not say or do anything to stop it? Does it not hurt them to see so many of their own people dying in this manner? Do they not feel any guilt for failing to make political progress so much so that Tibetans feel self-immolations are such a necessity?\n\nIt also disappoints me to know that His Holiness the Dalai Lama has had to witness this 152 times, and the Tibetan leadership STILL remains silent. How many more people have to die before the Tibetan leaders say enough is enough, and they speak up to stop it all? After all, the Central Tibetan Administration have been VERY creative in the way they have suppressed Dorje Shugden people. Do not get me wrong, I am not asking for potential self-immolators to be hurt or segregated like how Dorje Shugden people are. I would never wish that on anybody. However, there are many ways in which the Tibetan leadership can discourage self-immolations (which Tsem Rinpoche previously outlined in his article about Reuters here). So how come the Tibetan leaders are not doing anything to deter potential self-immolators?\n\nIn fact instead of stopping them, the leadership encourages them by praising them, celebrating them, lauding their so-called ‘feats’, building memorials to them… I am sorry and I mean no disrespect but personally, I would have put the funds spent on building memorials and lighting butterlamps towards building schools, training good teachers, constructing hospitals, getting the best medical equipment and so on. Why not focus on how we can improve the lives of the living instead of encouraging people to essentially commit suicide? How illogical that the Tibetan leadership always chooses the latter option.\n\nIn the bigger picture, no one understands the pain and desperation of the self-immolators better than Dorje Shugden people who have to go through it with double intensity. First, like other Tibetans, Dorje Shugden practitioners who are Tibetan also feel the pain of not being in their homeland. On top of that, unlike other Tibetans, they also suffer a second source of pain and loss of dignity because they are kicked out and segregated from the Tibetan exiled community due to their Dorje Shugden practice.\n\nWishing to prevent more unnecessary deaths and suffering, Tsem Rinpoche issued a statement about the self-immolations, and how the Tibetan leadership’s silence over this is unusual given they have spent 22 years suppressing Shugden practitioners. It was first published by Reuters and now Digital Journal, a Canadian-based Internet news service, has published it too. Originally established in 1998 as a technology and gadget magazine, over time they have evolved to become a global online hub for citizen journalism. These days, they publish both professional contributions and user-submitted content. Of course, all user-submitted content has to be approved by them so if the news somehow risks their journalistic integrity or reputation, Digital Journal is not going to publish it.\n\nSo that is the situation we find ourselves in – Tsem Rinpoche had good intentions to make such a statement, and Digital Journal allowed for the statement to be published, feeling it would somehow interest or benefit their readers. And yet, despite all of this, Tsem Rinpoche’s statements have now been used to attack Tsem Rinpoche himself. Since the publication of the first piece on Reuters, the attacks have intensified, with signs they are being coordinated. They have come from all quarters, ranging from anonymous pro-Tibet accounts all the way up to notable personalities like Prof Robert Thurman. My question is, why would anyone want to attack a person for trying to save lives by advising others that self-harm and suicide via self-immolation is not the correct solution?\n\nI always find it a little strange because if there is no ban on Dorje Shugden like the Tibetan leadership claims, then why are all of their supporters reacting so strongly to Tsem Rinpoche’s statements? Some of them spend hours criticising Tsem Rinpoche for his practice of Dorje Shugden, or denigrating and deriding my teacher for his opinions. Surely, ban or no ban, it is up to Tsem Rinpoche to issue whatever statements he wishes, and to choose whatever practice he wants to rely on. The fact people act like there is a ban whilst simultaneously claiming there is none, actually reflects poor communication from the leadership.\n\nSo I am sorry but I am going to have to say this, and it is not a truth that is very pleasant — it all boils down to poor leadership.\n\nIt was poor leadership that led to the split of the Gelug community over the Dorje Shugden issue.\n\nPoor leadership resulted in the Jonangpas being denied parliamentary representation, even though they are an officially-recognised religious denomination in Tibet.\n\nPoor leadership led to the split of the Karma Kagyu community over the Karmapa issue.\n\nPoor leadership resulted in the many scandals we have seen plaguing the Tibetan leadership as of late, ranging from accusations of sexual assault all the way up to money laundering and embezzlement.\n\nSimilarly, it is now poor leadership that has led Tibetans to feel they lack the opportunity and outlet to express their frustrations, therefore resorting to self-immolations.\n\nI thank Digital Journal for publishing the statement and I hope in doing so, someone reads Tsem Rinpoche’s words and is dissuaded from taking their own life. I also thank Digital Journal for shining a light on the misgovernance and poor leadership that has potentially irrevocably damaged what is actually a very beautiful community which has produced and nurtured incredible great masters that benefit the world. I hope that as time passes, more Tibetans are dissuaded from this horrific act, and the Tibetan leadership starts to act in the interests of their people, by dissuading them from self-immolating and giving them other options for speaking up.\n\nPastor Jean Ai\n\nAddendum\n\nCentral Tibetan Administration’s Website\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Tibet.net, which is the Tibetan leadership’s website. In it, they have a section with “information” about Dorje Shugden which is designed to promote hatred, negativity and direct vulgarities towards Shugden practitioners. What kind of democratic leadership has a section like this on their site targeting a religious group? Imagine the uproar there would be if the American or Canadian, or any other democratic government had sections like this on their site for the public!\n\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama’s Website\n\nThis is a screenshot of DalaiLama.com which is the official website of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. When this section exists on His Holiness’ website, it actually emboldens Tibetans to discriminate against and segregate Shugden practitioners. This section is basically the Dalai Lama’s ‘endorsement’ of such behaviour; when anti-Shugden individuals see this, they think it is okay to segregate against the practice “because the Dalai Lama said so”. I don’t think the Dalai Lama would agree with this but the webmaster and shadow writers behind his website should not put this type of anti-Dorje Shugden section which subscribes to discrimination against a group because of religion. In the 21st century, this is not fitting of a great spiritual leader like His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Do not discriminate tolerate; is the way to go.\n\nIf the Dorje Shugden ban is just advice and not a ban, then why is a section like this necessary on any website?\n\nTibetan Parliament-in-Exile’s Resolution Stating Government Employees Should Not Rely on Dorje Shugden\n\nIn 1996, the Tibetan leadership passed a resolution stating that all departments (and ergo their employees) should not rely on Dorje Shugden (point 8). The resolution also stated that individuals who do engage in its worship will harm the Dalai Lama’s life and the so-called Tibetan cause. That being the case, how will anyone within the Tibetan settlements and government be able to openly engage in Dorje Shugden practice after that, if their worship has been widely labelled as anti-Dalai Lama, anti-CTA and treasonous? To openly practice after that will leave them open to criticism, vulgarities, harassment and discrimination, as Dorje Shugden practitioners have been for the last 20 years. So they will be left with three options: to give up the practice (which many will not do), to practice secretly, or to give up their jobs.\n\nTibetan Parliament-in-Exile’s Resolution Naming Dorje Shugden Practitioners as Criminals in History\n\nThis is a screenshot of tibet.net, the Central Tibetan Administration’s official website, which shows the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile’s unanimous resolution dated 17 March 2014 naming Dorje Shugden practitioners as criminals in history (point 3, paragraph 2).\n\nVIDEO: Dalai Lama bans Dorje Shugden practice\n\nand expels monks\n\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama was recorded in Drepung Monastery in 2008 clearly stating that those who refused to give up their Dorje Shugden practice should be expelled from the monasteries. His Holiness even said that if people found it difficult to fulfill this instruction, that they should say that the Dalai Lama told them to expel Dorje Shugden practitioners.\n\nMy question is this: if giving up Dorje Shugden practice is just advice, and it is up to us who we wish to rely on, then why are there such heavy repercussions for people who choose to keep the practice? As a result of His Holiness saying this, thousands of Shugden monks were expelled from the monasteries, and were forced to set up their own monasteries where they would be able to continue their Dorje Shugden practice.\n\nVIDEO: Gaden Monastery Attacked\n\nSince the inception of the Dorje Shugden ban 20 years ago, the CTA (Central Tibetan Administration) continues to organize a hateful campaign against Dorje Shugden practitioners. In doing so, the Tibetan leadership has gone against the very core teachings of His Holiness the Dalai Lama on compassion and tolerance and thereby, misled the world over the nature of their activities. The Tibetan leadership pursues huge sponsorship and financial aid from the West in order to run its operations but they actually channel these funds towards campaigns that suppresses religious freedom within the Tibetan communities through various means to instigate violent suppression against Dorje Shugden practitioners.\n\nThis video footage shows clearly how Dorje Shugden practitioners have lived their lives in fear for the last 20 years due to the ban on Dorje Shugden. Although the Tibetan leadership and supporters have continued to use various violent and underhanded means to segregate and discriminate Dorje Shugden practitioners, the practitioners themselves have not fought back. Instead, they continue to uphold their peaceful reliance on their Dorje Shugden lineage lamas and especially the practices and teachings they have received in relations to the protector deity. The main part of the video was filmed in 2000 and it shows 3,000 lay and ordained Tibetans heading towards Gaden Shartse Monastery in South India in order to riot against a group of Dorje Shugden practitioners.\n\nDisclaimer: This video belongs to a third party.

They covered the Dorje Shugden issue extensively, surely a reflection of the seriousness of the issue for them to devote so much airtime to it. In their video, France 24 captured on film the discrimination against a Dorje Shugden monk.\n\nVIDEO: Al Jazeera reports on the Dorje Shugden issue\n\nBased in the Middle East, Al Jazeera was formed in response to the heavy influence of Western culture on the media. They are known to cover controversial topics that other news agencies may be reluctant to cover, and provide hard-hitting, objective coverage of current affairs.\n\nEvidence of the Ban\n\nOver the years, my students have collected evidence of the ban against Dorje Shugden. Personally, I find it quite disappointing and sad that they have been able to collect so much evidence because it just goes to show how widespread and pervasive this ban has become. As you can see below, notices banning Dorje Shugden practitioners can be found just about anywhere in the Tibetan settlements. Whether a Dorje Shugden person is trying to access healthcare or enter a restaurant, or try to buy something from a shop, they are banned everywhere and refused service. How is this just ‘advice’ when the repercussions of practising Dorje Shugden are so violent inside the Tibetan communities and settlements?\n\nFor more interesting information:\n\nReuters publishes my thoughts on Tibetan self-immolation\n\nReuters covers international Dorje Shugden conference 2018\n\nMilestone International Dorje Shugden Conference 2018 | 2018全球雄登代表大会开创历史新篇章 | ས་ཚིགས་འཛམ་གླིང་རྒྱལ་ཡོངས་རྡོ་རྗེ་ཤུགས་ལྡན་ལྷན་ཚོགས ༢༠༡༨།\n\nHuffington Post: When Machiavelli Dons Tibetan Robes\n\nHuffington Post: Shugden Acolytes Decry Ostracism Within Buddhist Ranks\n\nHuffington Post: Three Times as Many Buddhists as Communists in China: Dalai Lama’s Tibet Wish May Require Rapprochement with Former Adversaries\n\nDorje Shugden – The Protector of Our Time\n\nDorje Shugden: Our Personal Stories\n\nDear Dalai Lama, please read this\n\nDear Dalai Lama, With Folded Hands\n\nWhy so rude?\n\n700 Meet A Buddha (七百人幸睹佛现)\n\nGreat Masters Speak about Tsem Rinpoche\n\nDorje Shugden Retreat: A powerful practice to fulfill wishes\n\nDorje Shugden People Do Not Go to the Three Lower Realms\n\nWhy Accepting Dorje Shugden Is Good for Tibetan Democracy\n\nWhy can’t the Dalai Lama ‘bind’ Dorje Shugden?\n\nH.E.

To walk away from that was actually very easy. I didn't even consider it.\"\n\n~ Angeline Francis Khoo\n\n\"I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.\"\n\n~ Carl Jung\n\n\"There is a devil there is no doubt, but is he trying to get into us or trying to get out?\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"If you love someone, show it by being honest, respectful & honorable with them.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.\"\n\n~ Henry David Thoreau\n\n\"If I can just be the way I am & you the way you are & we accept each other, world peace is near.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"I am Asian, you are some other beautiful color. Together we make diversity so beautiful.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"It's amazing how some people have never met me or know who I am, but based on a few things they read here & there & rumours, they have formulated a new personality for me & all the things I've never done they passionately speak about....I find it funny and entertaining now. I guess we can't spend our lives fighting rumours...we just have to work hard & then rumours get proven wrong on it's own as a by product. No point explaining repeatedly. Just do our work & show results!!\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"There's a difference between patience and laziness. Patience comes from respect while laziness from disrespect of others.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"Although outwardly we have so much, we have so many conveniences, inwardly we have become more unhappy, so, acquisition is not the secret to happiness. The more we get, the more we have, the more unhappy we become.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"Before we experience any pain, we already had a fixed view of how things should be. When the experience we encounter contradicts our views, then the pain arises. The pain arises due to our fixed views not so much the experience itself. So the secret is changing the views. Re-educating ourselves on our views.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"You know since very young, for better or worse, I always did the things that others told me not to do. I wasn't really good at following the rules. Even now with how I share Dharma and my practice, I just do it the way I think it should be done but I do it sincerely. Not what others tell me what I can and can't do.\"\n\n~ Tsem Rinpoche\n\n\"Love me or hate me, both are in my favor... If you love me, I'll always be in your heart... If you hate me, I'll always be in your mind.\"\n\n~ William Shakespeare\n\n\"One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous or honest.\"\n\n~ Maya Angelou"
