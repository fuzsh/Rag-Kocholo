        "text": "Earlier this year, TIME Magazine sat down with the Dalai Lama to ask him 10 questions. The questions ranged from the conflict in China to what it would be like to be someone other than the Dalai Lama. Some of the questions include:\n\nDo you see any possibility of reconciliation with the Chinese government within your lifetime?\n\nDo you ever feel angry or outraged?\n\nHave you ever thought about being a normal person instead of being the Dalai Lama?\n\nWill you ever be able to fulfull your destiny if you never go home again?\n\nDo you believe that your time here on earth has been a success?\n\nHave you ever tried on a pair of trousers?\n\nFor a complete list of the Dalai Lama's responses, visit TIME's website."
