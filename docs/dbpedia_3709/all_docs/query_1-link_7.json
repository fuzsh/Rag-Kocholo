        "text": "This is indeed a pun.\n\nTo make someone something can mean \"to create something for someone\", as in, I made her a sandwich. But it can also mean \"to change someone into some thing or state\", as in, I made her angry; Zeus made her (into) a cow.\n\nTo be one with something is a spiritual expression meaning...something spiritual. When people say they are one with the universe, they mean they experience some sort of supernatural bond with the entire universe. Don't ask me how it works. Here everything is equivalent to the universe. This is known as nondualism. The Dalai Lama is known for his spirituality.\n\nBut one can also stand for one pizza, as in can you make me one [pizza] with [all available toppings]: everything means \"every topping/ingredient you have that you can put on a pizza\".\n\nExplanation\n\nSo, if you look at the statement again, the Dalai Lama asks them to \"make him one with everything\". So this is indeed a pun.\n\nRead one way, it seems as if he is asking the pizza shop to give him spiritual enlightenment.\n\nWhile, in reality, he may be asking for a pizza with every topping.\n\nNot a good joke.\n\nAlthough to me that joke is hilarious, it is not a good joke in the universal sense. Most jokes require a certain background, a certain experience.\n\nBut this one requires too many.\n\nFor this one, (i) you must have encountered the Buddhist idea of merging or unifying with the universe, expressed using the idiom become one with (which in other contexts is not common); and (ii) you must have encountered pizza in the American style, with loads of different topping choices, ordered using a preposition phrase headed by with (as in \"with pepperoni and mushroom\"); and (iii) you must have been in a pizzeria that has as one of the choices on its menu the indecisive glutton's non-choice consisting of a megacombo of all available toppings (by no means all pizza restaurants give you that option), so that \"everything\" is a possible topping choice.\n\nIt can be read as: can you make me one pizza with every topping on it.\n\nOr: can you give me a spiritual connection with everything within the universe.\n\nBeing \"one\" with something means that you are connected to it in a spiritual sense.\n\nCan you make me \"one\" with \"everything\".\n\nThe dalai lama is an extremely spiritual public figure, who has made a life journey towards enlightenment and becoming \"one\" with the universe.( as in the joke)\n\nAn addition to the previous answers:\n\nThe Dalai Lama walks into a pizza shop and says \"can you make me one with everything?\"\n\nActually, this is only half of the joke. The rest of it comes with the seller's reply when the Dalai Lama, seeing his fifty dollar banknote been pocketed by the seller, asks him for change:\n\n\"Change comes from within.\"\n\nHere, the wordplay is based on the different meanings of the word \"change\":\n\na) the money that is returned to someone who has paid for something that costs less than the amount that they gave;\n\nb) the result of something becoming different (in the context of Buddhism — positively different).\n\nIn this regard, the seller's reply matches the adage known to every follower of Buddhist religion:\n\n\"A genuine change must first come from within the individual, only then can he or she attempt to make a significant contribution to humanity\" (the link).\n\nYes it's a pun on make me one with everything.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has spent his whole life in the pursuit of oneness with himself and the universe, yet here he is asking a humble pizza restaurant to do it for him: can you make me one with everything?\n\nHe is of course referring to a pizza with all the toppings, rather than any spiritual oneness."
