As many people say, i think happiness is heealthy. If you have a smile on your face – the day is brighter. When you laugh and having fun your whole body starts to feel better. That`s why i want to post some of my favorite inspirational quotes.\n\n“Do one thing every day that scares you.”\n\n― Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n“The unexamined life is not worth living.”\n\n― Socrates\n\n“To give pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.”\n\n― Mahatma Gandhi\n\n“You can’t wait for inspiration.

I will add them in the post 🙂\n\nAfter every tiring day we all need to relax and enjoy the life. I started looking for the best way to relax and feel the life around me, because the life isn’t only work, work and again work… If you think I’m right, So you have your own way to enjoy life or you’re like me and are still looking for other options to feel good.\n\nDo you want to know what I found ? I’m sure you want 🙂 So here are some tips to help you feel at ease and make you feel better.\n\nYou can start with practice breathing techniques: Slow down your breathing and actively concentrate on it. This is always the easiest way to self-calm, provided you remember to resort to it.\n\nBreathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\nInhale deeply as you count to five, hold your breath for five seconds, then exhale slowly, counting to five. Do this ten times to relax your muscles and nerves. As you breathe out, visualize the stress and tension leaving your body through your breath.\n\nPlay some relaxing music like this song:\n\nStart practice positive thinking: Positive thinking isn’t about wishful or dreamer thinking; it’s about making the most of the situations that you find yourself in and avoiding any tendency to add negative overlays. Use visualization techniques. While you might not feel calm and relaxed, imagining a calm and relaxed scene in your mind can do wonders to improve your outlook. Picture beaches, lying down resting, going for a hike, etc., to help you stay relaxed.\n\nUse affirmations to change your outlook on life and stop yourself from always jumping to negative conclusions. Affirmations are short, powerful statements that build you up and increase your confidence, helping you to expect positive outcomes. Be careful about the words you choose – the things you say about yourself over and over again will ensure that you believe your own rhetoric. Use positive, believable, and caring words about yourself.\n\nTeach yourself to step back and see the “big picture” when you’re in the thick of things that don’t seem to be going well. Recognize that most problems are temporary, and minor setbacks on the path to achieving larger goals.\n\nYou can try to Meditate: Find a quiet place and focus on calming your mind. There are several different forms of meditation, such as mantras, labyrinths, Sahaja Yoga and Buddhist meditation, among others. Remember that meditation requires practice – the more you practice, the better you’ll get. The internet has a lot of information about this.\n\nIf you have leg pain or they are just very tired you can try this : Close your eyes. Begin to breathe deeply in through your nose, and out through your mouth. Do this for a few moments, until you feel “settled in”. Just focus on your breathing. When you are ready, tighten every muscle in your feet as hard as you can until it just begins to hurt (or count to ten, whichever you prefer), then immediately relax all of those muscles at the same time. After a few seconds, clench your calf and shin muscles as tightly as possible until they just start to hurt, and then instantly relax them.\n\nIf you use some other techniques, share them with us 🙂\n\nIn this post, I want to meet you with someone who is something like a guru for me and I have so much respect for him. Some of you might know more than me about him, but I want to tell you about one film that I watched. There, the 14th Dalai Lama will have to answer on 10 questions.\n\nFirst, let me tell you something about Dalai Lama:\n\nThe Dalai Lama is a high lama in the Gelug or “Yellow Hat” school of Tibetan Buddhism, founded by Tsongkhapa (1357–1419). The name is a combination of the Mongolian word dalai meaning “Ocean” and the Tibetan word bla-ma (with a silent “b”) meaning “guru, teacher”.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama (religious name: Tenzin Gyatso, shortened from Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, born Lhamo Dondrub, 6 July 1935) is the 14th and current Dalai Lama, as well as the longest lived incumbent. Dalai Lamas are the head monks of the Gelugpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, and is also well known for his lifelong advocacy for Tibetans inside and outside Tibet.\n\nHis story of life is staggering and will touch your soul surely. In one of my next posts I will talk more about his life.\n\nThe name of the Film that I want to talk right now is “10 Questions For The Dalai Lama” :\n\nThe film begins as a chronicle of Rick Ray’s journey through India to interview Tenzin Gyatso. The film switches between present and recent past, with stages of the trip introducing sections on the personal history of Tenzin Gyatso, the process used to select a Dalai Lama and Gyatso’s journey into exile.\n\nThe interview with Tenzin Gyatso begins midway through the film. This section is inter-cut between sections addressing philosophical questions and current affairs. The film also features the daily life of Tenzin Gyatso, his international peace efforts and his work with Tibetan refugees. The film features interviews with a Buddhist monk who fled violence in Tibet and Tenzin Tethong, who has served in the Tibetan Government in Exile for 20 years. Towards the end, the film touches on the issues of internet censorship in China, changes in Tibetan culture, and the 11th Panchen Lama controversy.\n\nIf you want to know more about the film :\n\nhttp://www.thedalailamamovie.com\n\nAnd remember “Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.”\n\nFor me its a great Honor to talk about The Dalai Lama.\n\nDo you like the big screen of IMAX? Every time when I watch movie at this huge screen its awesome, I always want to come back into the theater. Last time when i was there I watched “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” in 3D. I felt like the hobbit hits me to the head 😀\n\nNow we can watch movies at the big screen of IMAX, at Home! Yes it’s realistic, maybe it will cost a little bit.\n\nI’m sure it will be Amazing !\n\nIMAX designs every aspect of the IMAX Private Theatre – from our renowned projection and sound technology to the room acoustics and theatre geometry – to work as a fully integrated solution that is optimized specifically for your home.\n\nNow, IMAX has combined its industry-leading expertise, cutting-edge proprietary and patented technology and architecture to bring the world’s most immersive entertainment experience to select homes with the IMAX Private Theatre™.\n\nOnce the system is up and running, the company’s service center remotely monitors it 24 hours a day, and will reportedly respond in less than five minutes if something goes amiss.The official website doesn’t actually specify a price, opting instead to invite serious customers to set up a “personal introduction.” However, according to DTV USA Forum, the home IMAX systems will run between $1 million and $2 million.\n\nAnd remember to be happy 🙂\n\nWhere is the best spot in the world to ride the waves? We all love the big waves, I started getting interested in Surfing, when once I saw “Baywatch” and in one of the episodes, a beauty girl rode the waves and she was amazing!\n\nIn the next rows i want to share with you some of the best places where you can go to surf and to have a great time with your friends to ride the waves.\n\n1.Tamarindo, Costa Rica\n\n:\n\nAfter the popular surfing film The Endless Summer 2 showcased Tamarindo’s goods, tourists were tripping over themselves trying to get to this Central American hotspot. Now developed into a full-fledged resort, Tamarindo has not lost its edge as an exclusive surfing spot. Spots like Little Hawaii and Witch’s Rock are among the most legendary, thanks to aggressive swells and almost perfect weather.\n\n2.Jeffrey’s Bay, South Africa\n\n:\n\nA notorious surfing destination thanks to its six superb breakpoints and consistently great weather all year, Jeffrey’s Bay sees some picture-perfect waves roll onto its beaches, including “Kitchen Windows,” “Magna Tubes” and “Albatross.” It is no wonder the popular Billabong Surfing Festival attracts the world’s best surfers here every July — the conditions are ideal.\n\n3.Pipeline, Hawaii\n\n:\n\nHere it is — the daddy of all waves. It’s the site most surfers will never be good enough to surf, but dream of riding its perfect crest. Aptly, it’s located at the island that created surfing, and is one of the heaviest waves in the world, scaling over six meters over a shallow base of razor blade table reef. If you’ve got the balls, charge this flawless water tube and experience one of nature’s finest creations.\n\nAny surfer will tell you: once you’ve hopped on a board once, you just can’t stop. So even the inexperienced wave lovers who want to catch some big breaks and add “dude,” “tubular” and “awesome” to their everyday lingo should seriously check out these 10 destinations. Each one offers great surfing conditions in an idyllic setting where you can hit the water hard during the day and then experience a resort at night. So, are you ready to ride?\n\nSmile ! (:\n\nIf you want to feel the adrenaline rush, the bunjee jumping is one of the best things that can make you shiver. I’ve jumped a few times and after each jump I say “I will do it again!”. There is no other feeling like it. Its funny to watch people who always say “hah, there is nothing scary out there, its so easy to jump” and when they are staying on the edge, they are so scared that they dont even try to jump 😀\n\nHere are some places, where you can try to jump 😉\n\n1.Corinth Canal, Greece :\n\nThe Corinth Canal is a junction of international sea communications and serves ships of all nationalities. It provides the shortest and safest sea-lane for ships coming from the Ionian sea, the Adriatic, Southern Italy, and those passing through the Straits or Messina en route to Eastern Mediterranean ports and on to the Black Sea and vice versa.The bridge makes an ideal place to set up a bungy jumping venue. The day I visited, I watched a few people do it- but I did not try it myself. Height of Jump: 78m.\n\n2.Ponte Colossus, Italy :\n\nBungee Jumpers count the leap from the Ponte Colossus Bridge among the world’s Top Ten Bungee experiences. The platform is 152 meters above a forested gorge in the Italian Alps, located at the mid-point between the Northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin in Biella, Piedmont Province. The jump provides nearly 5 seconds of free-fall and night jumps are possible guaranteeing a totally unique experience.\n\n3.Royal Gorge Bridge, Colorado, USA :\n\nIronically, Colorado’s most famous bungee destination is one at which traditional bungee jumping is banned throughout the year. Recognized as one of the highest suspension bridges in the world at 1,053 feet, the Royal Gorge Bridge in Canon City, Colorado, has host to several types of bungee jumps.\n\nHeight of Jump: 321 m.\n\nJump into the life ;]\n\nWe all love to go to parties or festivals, to have fun with friends, dancing with strangers, drinking alkohol and we can do that all night long or maybe a few days. Now I want to invite you at some parties, where I’am sure you can have a great time.\n\nSongkran\n\n:\n\nA celebration of the Thai New Year, Songkran may as well be the world’s biggest wet-tshirt contest. The festival takes place during Thailand’s hottest time of year, mid April, and partiers cool off by throwing containers of water, blasting Super Soakers and spraying garden hoses at one other. Although the original Songkran festival was a rather somber and reverent affair—a time to pay respect to elder, where the water hurling symbolized a spiritual cleansing—young people have helped push the festival in the direction of wet and wild revelry.\n\nPhi Ta Khon\n\n:\n\nAs the most well-known event of Loei province in the Northeastern Thailand, Phi Ta Khon is the ultimate yearly celebration. The Thailand Ghost Festival is well regarded as an annual event where revelers put on rather hilarious, yet ghostly, masks made of bamboo and wicker and join in the Ghost parade. Regarded as a rain-making ceremony, this spooky festivity is held annually in the beginning of rainy season. This year the event will be held on 22-24 June at Dan Sai District of Loei province. Unlike Halloween, the ghosts and poltergeists in Phi Ta Khon seek their fun under full daylight.\n\nFull Moon Party\n\n:\n\nThe island of Ko Pha Ngan in Thailand hosts an all-night beach party before or after every full moon. The tradition began in the ’80s as a simple gathering to give thanks to a group of tourists, and over time has evolved into a 20,000-strong celebration that is sure to be on every party-loving tourist’s itinerary. In addition to the endless, pounding music and attractive crowd, the event boasts features like fire skipping ropes, infamous “buckets” of alcoholic beverages and a pretty colorful drug culture. In other words, there aren’t a lot of people going home alone after this one.\n\nEnjoy the moment …\n\nWhen I’am at the beach and the sand is hot, some of the best thing i can wait for is the breeze. But after a few minutes of waiting, I see one bar and do you know what I’am thinking about … Yes “I need a drink”, but not just a drink. I want some special drinks to feel the coolness in this hot day on the beach.\n\nLet me show you some cocktails that I like …\n\nMalibu Sunrise :\n\nRecipe:\n\n2 oz Malibu® coconut rum\n\nfill with orange juice\n\n1 oz grenadine syrup\n\nPour malibu rum in a highball glass, and top with orange juice. Stir. Add grenadine by tilting glass and pouring grenadine down side. (by flipping the bottle vertically very quickly). The grenadine should go straight to the bottom and then rise up slowly through the drink. Enjoy!\n\nDo you like frozen cocktail ?\n\nFrozen Strawberry Banana Colada :\n\nRecipe:\n\n1 1/4 oz dark rum\n\n2 oz coconut cream\n\n2 oz strawberries\n\n1 medium banana\n\n8 oz crushed ice\n\nCombine ingredients in a blender until smooth.

Pour into a tall glass, preferably a pint glass or large brandy snifter with ice, and float the champagne on top with a squeeze of lemon. Serve.\n\nI just think this is plain ol’ fun! Here’s a recipe that Fred Flintstone and Wilma would have toasted with over a moonlit evening – it’s full of alcohol and packs a wallop! It’s also a lovely rose color.\n\nIn the next posts I will show you some more cocktails, I hope you enjoy these 🙂"
