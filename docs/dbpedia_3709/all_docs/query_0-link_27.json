        "text": "In order to appeal tourists, cities need to get well known and in order to get well known, they need publicity. Considering the popularity of television and films, cities are dependent to the power of media in order to be existent. Although the main goal of the production firms is not contributing the tourism and economies of the cities, nowadays, their decisions became crucial for the revenues of them. The relationship between tourism and media is a crucial one considering the relationship of the audience with what they see as they relate themselves and change their consumption habits depending on what they watch also, they make their decisions about the places according to them. This article examines the relationship between tourism and media considering the relationship between the audience and the media content. It examines the relation between the attraction that emerges from the film tourism and the consumption behaviors of the audiences and tourists based on their identifications with the characters and films.\n\nThe goal of this research is, using certain statistic techniques, to analyse the intensity of influence of various media on a tourist destination image creation. It is therefore necessary to research, analyse and determine every single intensity and potentiality of effects of various media on creation of tourist destination image. Furthermore, this statement presents the major part of the problem which this paper has been trying to research and solve systematically. Based on the research goal, the following hypothesis was set: Different media have different intensity of influence on creation of tourist destination image. The sample included 1,000 respondents. The primary data was collected through field research, using the survey technique. Internal consistency, that is, reliability of each measurement scale was tested by Cronbach alpha coefficient. The hypothesis was tested by linear multiple regression method. Necessary analysis and testing were made by using R-programming languag...\n\nFilm induced tourism or film tourism is a result of destination image formation and development through film industry with collaboration of other destination image stakeholders (policy makers, private and public investors, scholars and etc.). This postmodern tourism phenomenon links film driven emotions to the filming locations and at the same time is responsible for positive or negative destination image formation. In Lithuanian academic discourses this theory, as well as the impact of films towards local tourism, was not yet recognized. Therefore this article, according to the collected film tourism theoretical material, analyses Lithuanian potential for film induced tourism and how can it be turned into a destination promotion strategy. The conclusions show that there are real opportunities for Lithuania to use film industry as a tool of destination image formation, however it needs further analysis, a clear strategic plan, strong collaboration with Baltic region and the use of two recommendation models, which were presented in this paper. This research can be used for dynamic analysis as well as strategic planning in any specific institution related to filmmaking, tourism and regional image formation.\n\nA Book Review: Tourism Research Frontiers: beyond the boundaries of Knowledge * In only eight chapters and 165 pages, this book discusses the needs of introducing new themes of investigation in the specialized literature of tourism research. Likely, this globalized world looks pretty different from a couple of decades back, when the discipline was founded. New times, new horizons and new challenges need new thinking. As a part of prestigious Emerald Series, Chambers and Rakic present an edited book, oriented to expand the epistemological boundaries of tourism research, imagining not only new themes and issues to explore but new problems. Based on the legacy of Jafar Jafari, the editors worked hard to compile different voices, dotted of different arguments, into a shared viewpoint. In the first chapter, the editors introduce the concept of frontiers as the fringe between the known and unknown. The fieldwork suggests that we shed light on some issues while others remain unchecked. The legitimacy of academic disciplines rests on their explanatory capacity. These borders, far from being stable, are in continuous renegotiation. Though tourism-research has been consolidated as a promising academic option for graduate and postgraduate students, a radical turn undermines the dominant understanding of tourism as it has been formulated by the founding parents. Most certainly, beyond tourism, critical scholars unveiled a commoditized discourse where the \" Other \" is subordinated to a ruling class of developed countries. As something else than a peace-making industry, tourism covers racialized allegories which lead to control of the periphery. This paradigm sees in tourism an alienatory mechanism of surveillance. Nonetheless, this book proposes an alternative way. Instead of proclaiming the dismantling of epistemological borders of tourism, the editors suggest a shift offering a fertile ground to shore up new paradigms. Through the second chapter, Gyimothy et al, discuss the ebbs and flows of popculture tourism which represents an extension of cultural behaviour in a globalized and multiculturalist universe. In chapter 3, Mondoca presents a study case based on the relationships of stakeholders in Ilha do Grande, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Those communities"
