        "text": "1. My philosophy on life is that you should live while you are alive and you should give others that same privilege. We shouldn’t judge people for the choices they make, because we all make bad decisions. You should do what you want with your life, as long as it makes you happy and causes no harm to others. Happiness is all we can hope for in this world and we have to strive to achieve it. We should help people when we can and graciously accept failures when we have to.\n\n2. The best way for people to live is to work hard and strive for success. People should be compassionate towards others and live life to the fullest. We have to make and maintain friendships. We have to try to advance in our careers and raise families. We have to try and help …show more content…\n\nBeing a good person means being a considerate person who thinks about the consequences of their decisions and the effects of their actions on others. Good people take care of themselves and their friends and try to make personal relationships a priority. Good people also tend to take the high road and be the bigger person in an argument. Generally, they will work to meet important deadlines and be helpful when they can. They try to succeed and take their work very seriously. They are good friends to others and try to treat everyone with respect.\n\n4. Good people aren’t always moral people. This is because moral people seem to be more concerned with rules and laws and are sure to follow them. Good people, in my opinion, do what they think they must to do what is right.

But, a good person may offer to buy the food for him, because they feel it is the right thing to do. Moral people may often feel that they are better than another person because of their tendency to follow the law on all …show more content…\n\nI’m not exactly sure what to expect from this class, but I know that I will definitely learn something new as I haven’t ever studied philosophy. I expect to learn about the Greek philosophers and their philosophies. I hope to gain insight on the true meaning of life. Perhaps I will be able to apply these learnings to my everyday life. For example, this class may change my opinion of human existence. I may learn something in this class that totally changes my view of this world. And, frankly, I hope I do.\n\n8. As you know, my name is Samantha Foutch. I am seventeen years old and I live in London, KY. I graduated high school in May 2016 and this is my third semester of college. In my free time, I love to sing, read, watch TV, write, and draw. I also like to spend time with my family and play with my dog. In the future, I hope to be something great. I still haven’t pinpointed exactly what I want to be. I know that I want to improve people’s lives and make others happy. I have been inspired by people who make me feel better when I’m upset and I want to help people. I want people to remember who I"
