“If you had only one hour with the Dalai Lama, what would YOU ask?

Against the backdrop of an exotic land, a lone filmaker is granted one hour to ask ten questions of the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Containing rare historical footage as well as footage taken inside Tibet, a story is woven between a journeyman’s personal observations, the troubled history of a government-in-exile, and the life and wisdom of one of the premiere spiritual leaders of our time.”

“There have been several documentaries about the Dalai Lama, but few have done a better job of packaging the Tibetan religious leader’s circumstances, both historical and current, along with the philospohies, than Rick Ray’s ’10 Questions for the Dalai Lama'” -San Fransisco Chronicle
