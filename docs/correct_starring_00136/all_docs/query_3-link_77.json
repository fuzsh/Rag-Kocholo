        "text": "We've gotten the first trailer for Clerks 3, the long-awaited return to Kevin Smith's seminal slacker movie series.\n\nStarring the original cast, the plot will see Randal Graves suffer a near-fatal heart attack, and team up with Dante Hicks to make a movie about their time working at the Quick Stop grocery store. As you can see from the trailer, that movie sounds a lot like, well, Clerks.\n\nTo celebrate the trailer's release, director Kevin Smith is currently hosting an Instagram Live chat featuring stars Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson and Jason Mewes, all of whom will talk about the new movie and answer fan questions.\n\nThe movie will air in 700 US theaters for two nights only, September 13 and September 15 – you can book tickets now. Smith will also be taking the film on the Clerks 3 Convenience Tour, starting on September 4.\n\nWe also got a look at the movie's poster, which you can see below:"
