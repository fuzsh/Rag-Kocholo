        "text": "Thursday the 12th, the new horror comedy directed by Brad Leo Lyon and starring such names as Marilyn Ghigliotti and Todd Bridges will be coming to the silver screen this summer. (Click Here for Tour Dates) Yet, that's not the only thing making this a special story. The movie is arriving in cinemas by way of the \"Also in Theaters\" tour, a filmed theatrical road show tour that will take director Lyon across the USA as he promotes the movie and does Q & A sessions after screenings in at least 15 cities.\n\nThe entire endeavor will be filmed as part of a TV series also named \"Also in Theaters\" which will give the world an inside look a version of Hollywood with a lot less red carpet. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of films were released in theaters every week with the mainstream audiences only being aware of a select view. This series takes a look at some of those other movies as they tour the country with a lot less fan fare and far smaller budgets.\n\nThe following articles are from third parties and don't necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Brad Leo Lyon, Lyon Productions, and other affiliated members. (We always wanted an excuse to type that.)\n\nNOTE - This section of our website is being converted over to our \"In the Media\" section above.\n\nFrom Flint Journal/Mlive.com By William E. Ketchucm III April 24, 2012\n\nFLINT, MIâ€”If you're a fan of Saved By The Bell, \"Maniac Cop\" or professional wrestling, don't forget about Tuesday's debut of \"Little Creeps\" in Flint.\n\nFlint producer Brad Leo Lyon's campy horror-comedy flick, which tells the story of a fired professor who finds a magical book that opens the gates of hell, stars actors from the aforementioned TV shows and films. Rave Cinemas (Flint West 14), 1591 South Graham, Flint, will host the premier of the film on Wednesday, April 25 at 7:30 p.m. A limited amount of tickets are available at Lyon Motion Pictures' web site, or by calling 810.208.LYON (5966).\n\nREAD THE ARTICLE HERE"
