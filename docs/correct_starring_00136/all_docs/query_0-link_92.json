        "text": "A day in the lives of two convenience clerks named Dante and Randal as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.\n\nDante (Brian O'Halloran) is called in to cover a shift at his New Jersey convenience store on his day off. His friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) helps him pass the time, neglecting his video-store customers next door to hang out in the Quick Stop. The uneventful day is disrupted by news that one of Dante's ex-girlfriends has died. After attending her memorial service, Dante muses over staying with current girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) or reuniting with ex Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer).\n\nWINNER\n\nCannes Film Festival - Award of the Youth, and Mercedes-Benz Award\n\n\"Smith credits Richard Linklater's Slacker as inspiration. But Clerks supplies its own subversively witty take on Generation Next.\" - Rolling Stone\n\n\"At his best, [Kevin] Smith captures the zeitgeist of an era and becomes the voice of a generation.\" - Salon.com\n\n\"Clerks remains a quintessential part of 90s independent cinema, and the start of the career of one of the most well-rounded directors and writers of this era, Kevin Smith.\" - The Cinematic Reel"
