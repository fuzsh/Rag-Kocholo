        "text": "Things happen as a matter of course in the New Jersey convenience store where Clerks is set, as they do in life if only we were more observant. For instance, an old man comes in, asking to go to the loo. But he needs a porn magazine as accompaniment. Later, the high school sweetheart of Dante, who works there, goes there too and, in the dark, since there are apparently no lights, thinks she's having sex with him. But it's the old man, who apparently dies as a result. Or was dead when she did it.\n\nClerks is nothing if not surprising. It's a slice of life that is designed to prove there is nothing so unordinary as the ordinary, even when it comes to taking a leak.\n\nThe film was made, for practically nothing, by Kevin Smith, who wrote the screenplay, co-produced, edited and plays a character called Silent Bob. It is one of those small-scale American independent movies that you either fall for or you don't, and one would confidently expect most of those fed up with big, empty, run-of-the-mill Hollywood epics to raise at least two cheers.\n\nOnly two, perhaps, because the film is really an extended sketch that might have been better at around an hour or so. But it's certainly fresh, formidably weird and progresses through chapter headings such as Vilification, Vagary, Malaise and Lamentation as if the store is not merely a little world of its own but some kind of microcosm of what's outside. Dante, played with some panache by Brian O'Halloran, is at its centre, forced to miss hockey practice because he has to work on his day off and finding himself gradually clobbered by the experience.\n\nHis girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) announces that she's performed fellatio on 37 men other than him. Caitlin (Lisa Spoonauer), his former sweetheart, is apparently getting married, and he is told one of his old schoolfriends has died. Added to all that, a trading inspector fines him for selling cigarettes to insistent minors.\n\nTo say that it is not his day would be the understatement of the year. But the trick of the film is to suggest that, actually, there are days like this aplenty, even in convenience stores. The other quality lies in the dialogue which skilfully suggests that it is being made up as what passes for a storyline is being developed.\n\nAction never speaks louder than words in Clerks , which is just as well because there isn't an awful lot of the former, apart from the goings-on in the loo, which we don't see, and the hockey game on the roof, which we do. Shot mostly at night in the Leonardo Quickstop store where Smith was working at the time, it's all rather like a Tarantino film without the gunplay. But where Tarantino's characters are pulp fiction approximations rather than real people, both Dante and his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) seem New Jersey denizens to a tee. They are much more entertaining than Richard Linklater's lovers in Before Sunrise and their realities, though far removed from ours in the physical sense, nevertheless ring a number of different bells.\n\nWhen the day is finally done, and the store is closed up, you get the feeling that Clerks would make a wonderful television sitcom, though unlikely to get there because of its language. As it is, given the fact that it doesn't quite sustain itself, it makes pretty good oddball cinema, especially for a mere Dollars 27,000. You can do an awful lot with a little, just as you can waste millions on dross."
