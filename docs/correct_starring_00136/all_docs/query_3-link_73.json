With a small budget of $27,500, Clerks would go on to be a surprise cult classic amassing $3,000,000 at the box office on a limited theatrical run. Now, after numerous successful spinoffs and 16 years after its sequel, Smith has returned to the original series that brought him fame.\n\nOn June 29th, Kevin Smith took to social media to confirm Clerks III after years of fans asking for the series to make a return. To build up the hype, he has posted images and information about the film every day since the initial announcement. This has come as a surprise to many after 2018 when Smith said that a third Clerks movie would not be happening because Jeff Anderson did not want to return as Randal. Refusing to make a film without all of them, Smith toyed around with the idea to make it into a comic series instead.\n\nRELATED:"
