        "text": "Snoochie boochies, indeed.\n\nJay, Silent Bob, Dante and Randal will all return to the big screen this year as “Clerks III,” the latest installment in Kevin Smith’s View Askew cinematic universe, finally arrives in September. Fans got a first look at what's in store thanks to the \"Clerks III\" trailer, released at noon Wednesday.\n\nFranchise stars Jeff Anderson, Brian O’Halloran, Jason Mewes and Smith himself co-star in the film. Returning players Rosario Dawson and Trevor Fehrman are seen reprising their roles from \"Clerks II\" (2006) in the trailer, which also previews cameos from frequent Smith collaborators including Ben Affleck and Justin Long. Anderson is also seen wearing a t-shirt for the Inkwell Coffeehouse, the longtime Long Branch spot that was a favorite of Smith’s before it closed in May.\n\nMonmouth County locations including the Quick Stop and Gianni’s Pizzeria – which has served as a pop-up location for the once-fictional Mooby’s fast food chain introduced in Smith’s “Dogma” (1999) – can be spotted in the trailer.\n\nSet to the appropriately nostalgic 1990s guitar rock of Lit's \"My Own Worst Enemy,\" the trailer packs plenty of references to both Smith's life and his work in just about two minutes, such as the notoriously violent alternate ending to the original \"Clerks\" and Smith's headline-making health scare from a few years back.\n\nWatch the Clerks 3 trailer below.\n\nContinuing the cinematic saga launched by Smith with “Clerks” in 1994, the new film reunites Bayshore convenience store workers Randal (Anderson) and Dante (O’Halloran). As seen in the trailer for the film released Wednesday, the film follows Randal as he, after a massive heart attack, decides to make an independent film about his life.\n\nSmith famously created the original “Clerks” while working at the film’s central location: the Quick Stop convenience store in the Leonardo section of Middletown. He returned to the View Askew series for \"Reboot\" after suffering a massive heart attack of his own in 2018.\n\n\"Everything in this script is something either me or someone I know said,\" Randal says of the movie-within-the-movie in the trailer.\n\nThe latest film from the Red Bank-born, Highlands-raised Smith, the Monmouth County-shot sequel will be released in more than 700 theaters across the country 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 13 and Thursday, Sept. 15. Presented by Fathom Events and Lionsgate, the screenings will include a behind-the-scenes look at the film with Smith and his cast.\n\nThe cross-country screenings follow the launch of Smith’s “Convenience Tour” of “Clerks III” showings following by live question-and-answer sessions. That tour launches Sunday, Sept. 4 at the Hackensack Meridian Health Theatre at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank, followed by area engagements at the Keswick Theater in Glenside, Pennsylvania and the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\n\nTickets for the “Convenience Tour” go on sale 10 a.m. Friday, and tickets for the Fathom Events screening are available today via FathomEvents.com and participating theater box offices.\n\nAlex Biese has been writing about art, entertainment, culture and news on a local and national level for more than 15 years."
