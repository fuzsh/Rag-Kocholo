        "text": "May is Classic 90s Movie month. Today’s guest post comes from Dakota Proctor.\n\nMovie Title: Clerks\n\nYear: 1994\n\nWriter: Kevin Smith\n\nLead Actors: Brian O’Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti\n\nDirector: Kevin Smith\n\nIMDB Plot Summary: A day in the lives of two convenience store clerks named Dante and Randal as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.\n\nWhy I Think This Is A Classic 90s Movies: After a decade of blockbusters and the birth of the “franchise,” the 90s treated us to a new emergence of writer-directors looking to make a name for themselves in a generation that grew up in a deluge of media. The characters are down on themselves, confused about why they possess so much more knowledge than the customers yet are in a lower place in the social ladder. It’s a movie for the generation X, filled with pop culture references, product placement, and overall malaise.\n\nThe movie is a reaction to those huge films of the 80s. Although I’m sure the budget had something to do with this being Kevin Smith’s first film, the audio sync and continuity problems feel very at home in the film. It feels small. It creates that trapped feeling that the characters embody. Almost the whole movie is indoors. It seems similar to Beavis and Butthead, cynical people yelling from their couches about all the things wrong with the world without lifting a finger to change anything.\n\nAnd it seems the movie doesn’t offer any answers. At the end of the film, Dante is talking about how he has to go sort things out with the various women in his life, yet immediately after, makes plans with Randal to hang out the next day. Another day of the same old- same old. The 90s were filmed with movies about showing the world how it actually is, and this is one of the best.\n\nMy Favorite Moment In The Movie: The song Olaf sings early on is one of my favorites. It just shows how desperate these characters are to find something real, when Bob tells Olaf that the song is “beautiful.”\n\nMy Favorite Dialogue In the Movie: Randal and Dante having an “important” discussion in front of a customer.\n\nRandal Graves: So, your argument is that title dictates behavior?\n\nDante Hicks: What?\n\nRandal Graves: The reason you won’t let me use your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I’m supposed to follow it, right?\n\nDante Hicks: Exactly.\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: I saw one, one time, that said, “The next week, the world is ending.” And in the next week’s paper, they said, “We were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a koala-fish mutant bird.” Crazy shit.\n\nRandal Graves: So, I’m no more responsible for my decisions here than, say, a Death Squad soldier in Bosnia?\n\nDante Hicks: Oh, now, that’s stretching it. You’re not being asked to slay children or anything.\n\nRandal Graves: Yeah, not yet.\n\n[takes a drink of water]\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: And I remember this one time-\n\n[Randal spits water at him]\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: I’m going to break your fucking head! You fucking jerk-off!\n\nDante Hicks: Sir! Sir, I’m sorry! He meant to hit me.\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: Yeah, well, he missed!\n\nDante Hicks: Yeah, I know. Here, let me refund your money, and we’ll call it even, alright?\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: I’ll never come in here again.\n\n[to Randal]\n\nTabloid Reading Customer: And if I see you again, I’m gonnna break your fucking head open!\n\n[Randal salutes him as he leaves]\n\nDante Hicks: What the fuck’d you do that for?\n\nRandal Graves: Two reasons. One, I hate it when people can’t shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.\n\nDante Hicks: Oh, Jesus!\n\nRandal Graves: And two, to prove a point. Title does not dictate behavior.\n\nDante Hicks: What?\n\nRandal Graves: If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn’t be allowed to spit water at that guy. But I did. So, my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Even though I work in a video store, I choose to go rent movies at Big Choice. Agreed?\n\nDante Hicks: [gives Randal his car keys] You are a danger to both the dead and the living.\n\nRandal Graves: I like to think I’m a master of my own destiny.\n\nDante Hicks: Please, get the hell outta here.\n\nRandal Graves: You know I’m your hero.\n\nThis dialogue shows the breakdown of classes the movie is so interested in. As “respect” fell more and more out of favor with the youth, people could test boundaries more. Title does not dictate behavior for these characters. They can spit on customers and be okay.\n\nBut at the same time it does. They may be very intelligent, but something about Randal and Dante keeps them from advancing in life. The movie asks the question if our title makes us who we are. Is Olaf a metal singer because he says he is one? If Dante and Randal can be more than clerks, do they simply need to believe in themselves?\n\nKey Things You Should Look For When Watching This Movie: What is Kevin James saying about the American youth who work in service. Watch how the different characters handle anger. Watch for how these characters find release and stay sane amidst their seemingly boring lives.\n\nThanks, Dakota! To show our gratitude for your guest post, here’s a dash of creative juju for you. Whoosh!"
