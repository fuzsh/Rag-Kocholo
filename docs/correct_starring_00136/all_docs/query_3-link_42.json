        "text": "Kevin Smith is supposed to be here this summer.\n\nThe Highlands-born filmmaker is returning to his New Jersey roots, both artistically and geographically, with the latest installment in his long-running View Askew interconnected cinematic universe.\n\n\"Clerks III,\" the upcoming follow-up to his breakthrough 1994 debut film \"Clerks,\" will begin production in August, Smith announced Monday via Instagram.\n\nSmith confirmed in 2019 that original \"Clerks\" leads Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran were set to return as convenience store workers Randal Graves and Dante Hicks alongside Jason Mewes and Smith as lovable drug dealers Jay and Silent Bob in the film.\n\n\"It’ll be a movie that concludes a saga,\" Smith said at the time. \"It’ll be a movie about how you’re never too old to completely change your life. It’ll be a movie about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future.\"\n\nThe original \"Clerks\" was shot at the Quick Stop and RST Video Store shops in the Leonardo section of Middletown. Smith and company will return to the site for production on the new film.\n\nAccording to Smith, the film will be the saga of Anderson's video store clerk Randal suffering from a heart attack and then deciding to document his life's story with an independent film shot at the Quick Stop. Smith, not coincidentally, suffered a massive heart attack in 2018.\n\nExpected to be released next year, the film will also feature returning View Askew players Rosario Dawson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Trevor Fehrman and Jen Schwalbach, Smith confirmed on Monday.\n\nDeadline reported Monday that Lionsgate had acquired worldwide rights to the film, which is now in pre-production.\n\nSmith has been spending plenty of time in Leonardo lately — he partnered with \"Clerks\" actor, contractor and longtime cohort Ernie O'Donnell and Rajiv Thapar, whose family owns the Quick Stop, to launch the SModcastle theater and podcast recording space this month.\n\nAlex Biese has been writing about art, entertainment, culture and news on a local and national level for more than 15 years."
