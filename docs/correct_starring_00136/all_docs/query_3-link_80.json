        "text": "The long-brewing Kevin Smith biopic Shooting Clerks is finally making its debut this weekend, fittingly right at the Smodcastle Cinemas, which Smith himself owns. The biopic focuses on the filmmaker’s first movie, Clerks, which he released in 1994, when Smith was just 24 years old. The actor has previously talked about making the film, which he wrote and directed, with just $27,000, that he acquired by maxing out his credit cards, selling his comic book collection, and cashing out an insurance settlement for a totaled car.\n\nThe synopsis from the press release reads:\n\n“The true story of how convenience store clerk Kevin Smith made his grainy $27,000 film Clerks with maxed-out credit cards and the people who aided him in his indie crusade.”\n\nThe film’s director, Christopher Downie, is aiming to inspire other aspiring filmmakers to follow their dreams with this affectionate tribute. Downie states:\n\n“The tagline ‘It’s all about making a movie with your friends’ says it all for me, personally. I always had help from friends and family when making movies. It’s carried through my entire career because it makes the process an enjoyable experience. Those who we hired to work on the film, namely the cast and my producer Ryan James, have become close friends, mainly because they share the same sentiment. It truly is all about making a movie with your friends.”\n\nThe film will debut at Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey on Sunday, August 13, at 2PM, and immediately following the screening, the cast and crew, including Kevin Smith himself, the film’s director Christopher Downie and producer Ryan James will take to the stage for an all access Q & A."
