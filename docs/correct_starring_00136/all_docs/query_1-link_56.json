        "text": "With a third instalment of Kevin Smith’s series of movies about a pair of guys working in retail due for imminent arrival I thought I’d go back to the 1994 original for the first time in a while and see how Clerks holds up nearly 30 years on from release (though I probably didn’t actually see it until a little over 20 years ago).\n\nFor those who’ve yet to see it the film follows a rather pivotal day in the life of convenience store clerk, and general Generation X slacker, Dante Hicks (Brian O’Halloran) as he goes about his work, despite the fact he’s ‘not even supposed to be there today’ (to paraphrase).\n\nThrough this we meet a series of characters from fellow clerk Randall (Jeff Anderson) from the video rental place next door, to Dante’s girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), his ex Caitlin (Lisa Spoonauer), a pair of local drug dealers, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith), and sundry others who come and go across the film’s 88 minutes.\n\nDivided by title cards of varying levels of obscurity the film is comprised of a series of vignettes of Dante’s day that join together to make a vaguely coherent story, but in many ways this is about the mood as much as the plot.\n\nShot in black and white, for budgetary reasons, and with a naturalistic view of it’s world (far more so than almost any other of Smith’s films), that almost borders on a kind of fly on the wall documentary, the increasingly ridiculous situations are juxtaposed in a way that really feels like it shouldn’t work but somehow does.\n\nAlong with this Smith’s dialogue is, at times, far from naturalistic but again helps capture a mood and tone that is (to someone of my age at least) irresistible and even when the acting may not be quite of the highest standard (again this is as low budget and DIY as they come) it still hangs together thanks to the feel.\n\nReleased in the mid 90s, just as the grunge movement in music was winding down and the indie film craze was at a peak, this feels firmly like part of all that with the look and feel, and the characters overall nature and aesthetic, fitting the same mould and Smith’s DIY filmmaking approach matching it too.\n\nAlong with this, following Quentin Taratino’s startling debut with Reservoir Dogs, the style of dialogue hooks into the zeitgeist of the time jumping from then relatively obscure film references to comparatively serious discussion without missing a beat and with a great turn of comedic phrase at just the right points – along with a terrific streak of the absurd and comedically gross (see Randall’s video ordering list) that balances authenticity with heightened dialogue excellently.\n\nAs the film goes on the situations Dante and Randall find themselves in get increasingly ridiculous (suggesting what was to come from Smith in Mallrats, Dogma and more) but it ultimately comes round to make a point about slacker culture that I’m sure will ring true for many but without becoming too preachy about it and, while at times insufferable, Dante is ultimately a relatable figure (though maybe that says more about me than I’d like to admit).\n\nClerks then still more than holds up nearly three decades on from its release and, while Smith’s oeuvre since has been varied in quality to say the least, it’s still clear quite why his reputation still stands with this as its foundation."
