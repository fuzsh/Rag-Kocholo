        "text": "Lionsgate, 2022.\n\nIf you're not a die-hard fan of the legendary, milestone indie-flick, 1994's \"Clerks,\" then I beg of you: Please, please, PLEASE avoid \"Clerks III\" at all costs. There is nothing here for anyone who doesn't consider themselves a big fan of filmmaker Kevin Smith's \"View Askew-niverse,\" and in particularly, his first feature-film, \"Clerks.\"\n\nAnd even for those die-hards, \"Clerks III\" seems to go to the same well, the same safe places, that many of Smith's recent movies have, in order to suck dry familiar jokes and call-backs. I do think though, that there is enough nostalgia in \"Clerks III\" to make this a passable, if not an impressive, third and final act for Dante, Randall and the gang at the New Jersey Quick-E Mart.\n\nSomewhere along the way, through a multitude of dick and poop jokes, the clouds of marijuana smoke (mostly provided by proverbial side-kicks, Jay & Silent Bob) and the lengthy discussions about intricate details of the Star Wars saga, we actually find that we care about these characters. \"Clerks III\" gives them the emotional send-off that they probably didn't deserve, or even needed. But it allows Smith the opportunity to reflect and comment on his original creation, now from the eyes of a middle-aged man with the wisdom of nearly 30 years of separation, instead of as a wide-eyed twenty-something-er looking to take the world by storm while simultaneously trying to figure out exactly who he is.\n\nGrade: B-"
