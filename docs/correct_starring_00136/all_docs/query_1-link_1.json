        "text": "American actress\n\nMarilyn Ghigliotti is an American actress, producer, director and make-up artist best known for playing Veronica Loughran in Clerks.\n\nLife and career[edit]\n\nClerks director Kevin Smith cast her for her ability to cry while reciting a monologue for the audition. She later auditioned for Smith's Mallrats and was offered the role of Kim in Chasing Amy, but was not comfortable with kissing another woman on film.[1]\n\nShe moved to Sayreville, New Jersey, where she attended middle school and graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School in 1979. After high school, she earned her beautician license to do make-up and hair professionally. She worked at hair salons and later entered acting. Both of her parents are from Puerto Rico.[citation needed]\n\nShe performed in community theater in the New Jersey area. Since moving to Los Angeles in 1998, aside from her acting work, Ghigliotti works as a make-up artist in the TV/film industry as well as side work as a wedding stylist.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nFilm[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Invasion for Flesh and Blood Rape Victim Direct-to-video 1994 Clerks Veronica Loughran 1996 Jacker 2: Descent to Hell Direct-to-video; uncredited 1998 Get a Job Gina 1998 Flesh Eaters from Outer Space Direct-to-video 1999 A Packing Suburbia Reporter 2004 Palmarejo Gigi Short film 2004 Snowball Effect.
