        "text": "Starring Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti\n\nTRADITIONALLY, the lesson taught by the movie world is a common one - you don't have to be good to be rich. But sometimes, happily, the uncommon corollary pops up - you don't have to be rich to be good. Consider the impecunious case of writer/director/convenience-store clerk Kevin Smith. Consider his meagre resources - one black-and-white camera, a single set, and $25,575 in U.S. funds (a sum partially raised by the sale of his comic-book collection). Now consider the result - a feature debut, Clerks by name, that earned its spurs on the festival circuit (kudos at both Sundance and Cannes), ultimately winning the grand prize of theatrical distribution. And it's good, right? Well, not all lessons are neat - it ain't bad.\n\nLike many young filmmakers, Smith knows a lot about dialogue and zilch about structure - luckily for us, he's shrewd enough to use his strength to offset his weakness. So we're back on the episodic terrain of the twentysomething crowd, embodied in the goateed person of Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran). An underachieving soul, Dante works the inner circle of job hell - yes, he's a clerk in the Quick Stop convenience store (the very one that once employed the director). With him at the centre, the picture is simply a loose ramble through his days and ways - a series of semi-connected scenes separated by title cards bearing pretentious labels like Syntax and Paradigm and Perspicacity. Huh? Don't ask - forget the cover and look at the book.\n\nActually, laugh out loud at the book. Our put-upon hero's endless predicaments - with the rude dude who runs the adjoining video shop, with a current girlfriend who adores him and an ex-flame who doesn't, with a steady stream of odd-ball customers - are terrifically funny at best. Clearly influenced by such independent luminaries as Jim Jarmusch and Hal Hartley, Smith has a witty touch with the absurdities of the daily grind, along with a sufficient sense of rhythm to telegraph the joke and still get a big return. Of course, as with any movie pitched to the youthful side of the generation gap, these X-ers have the market cornered on ironic intelligence, and are infinitely superior to the grubby hand fate dealt them. From The Wild Ones to The Graduate to Pump up the Volume, t'was ever thus.\n\nHowever, even augmented by the priceless commodity of Smith's talent, $25,575 can only be stretched so far. Apparently, it won't buy you a stellar cast - some very strong lines receive some rather flat deliveries. And some distinctly lame scenes survive the chopping block. Here, Smith can only blame himself - a hoot one moment, a hiss the next, the film is about as even as a city road after a hard winter. But the script's sheer vigour sees us through. Clerks may be cut-rate yet it gives decent value - no magnum of champagne, to be sure, but better than a Big Gulp."
