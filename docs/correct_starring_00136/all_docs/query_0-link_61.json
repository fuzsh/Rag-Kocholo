        "text": "The emotional high point of this movie for me came in its opening seconds, when Dante (Brian O’Halloran) arrives to open the Quick Stop and Randal (Jeff Anderson) strolls out of the neighbouring cannabis store (formerly, of course, a video store). I loved Kevin Smith’s original Clerks (1994) when I was a teenager and watched it many times. If you show me the guys from that movie looking older, I’m going to feel a little emotional.\n\nKevin Smith’s early films were dominated by scenes in which actors arranged in simple visual compositions delivered reams of dialogue in long, static takes. In the process, he developed a reputation for being a careless and unimaginative visual stylist. The blocking in Clerks III is as basic as before, but one bit of stylistic evolution is that Smith now edits. He is not good at it, but he does it. Many scenes in this movie are shot with two cameras running at once, from slightly different angles, so as characters are talking, Smith will cut back and forth between the two cameras without any sense of rhythm. Smith is the only credited editor on this movie. See this movie and learn what a competent, professional editor can bring to a movie.\n\nOne other note on style: Clerks III is a powerful demonstration of some of the downsides of the industry-wide switch from film to digital. Say what you will about the look of Chasing Amy and Dogma, but at least they had to be lit for film.\n\nSince Chasing Amy, Smith’s comedies have always been built with a hard layer of quippy, foul-mouthed, pop-culture-laced comedy over a thick, gooey interior of sentimentality. Never have the two elements been less integrated than here, with its jarring shifts between broad tomfoolery and syrupy scenes where Dante weeps over the grave of his dead love Becky (Rosario Dawson, very kindly showing up for a day or two of filming to play a ghost). O’Halloran is called upon to do a lot of acting here, and if they gave out awards for effort alone, he’d be a shoo-in for Oscar.\n\nThe inciting incident of Clerks III is Randal surviving a near-fatal heart attack. Recognizing that he’s living on borrowed time and realizing that he’s wasted his life watching movies, he decides to make a movie of his own. In a meta turn, the movie he decides to make is, essentially, the original Clerks. Dante, Randal, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), Jay, Silent Bob, and all the rest of your faves play “themselves” in Randal’s movie, and much of the second act of Clerks III is spent on recreations of scenes from the original film. Like the original Clerks, Dante’s movie is shot in black and white, and has a budget of $27,000. This raises a lot of questions, such as: Why would Randal’s movie cost $27,000 given that the year is 2022 and he’s almost certainly not shooting on film? Wouldn’t Clerks be an entirely different movie if it starred a bunch of people in their late 40s and early 50s? Doesn’t Smith realize that Clerks is not divorceable from its 1990s Gen-X context? Smith includes a few moments where he lightly chides himself for some politically incorrect jokes in the original film, but he misses an opportunity to think about what a movie like Clerks being made in the year 2022 by a modern-day convenience store worker would look like.\n\nOf course, Smith is not really interested in that question, because this movie is about Kevin Smith. Dante and Randal are both nightmare-world self-portraits in which the auteur images a version of himself who never left the convenience store and never found lasting love. The film’s closing credits play to audio of Smith thanking us and everyone for the crazy ride he’s been on these past 28 years. The thesis of the movie is: Isn’t it great that I harnessed my malaise into a creative project? There is also the implication here that you – yes, you! – can follow in Smith’s footsteps by making a creative project of your own. This implicit call to arms would be more convincing if Smith could look outside the prism of his own achievements. In lieu of that, here’s a recreation of the iconic arm-stuck-in-a-can-of-Pringles scene from Clerks.\n\nRandal’s character arc sees him learning to self-actualize through telling his life story on film, but also selfishly losing sight of how Dante and everyone else are equally responsible for his achievement. Smith is clearly working through something personal here. Who does he feel he needs to make amends to? Scott Mosier? O’Halloran and Anderson? Phones are open.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
