This is an original, rolled, one-sheet movie poster from 1994 for Clerks starring Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonhauer, Jason Mewes, and Kevin Smith. Kevin Smith also directed the classic comedy.

Clerks was an extremely low budget film and was only shown on 96 screens in the United States in 1994. Because of this, marketing was limited and very few posters were printed for the film. This single-sided, advance poster measures 27” x 40” and is in very good to excellent, unused condition with minimal wear from previous handing. It has never been folded.

Please look closely at the photo as it is not cropped or a stock image. Please be advised that there are many reproduction posters sold online for this poster.

This very rare and collectible movie poster, printed in 1994 to promote the limited, theatrical release of Clerks, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
