Thursday the 12th, the new horror comedy directed by Brad Leo Lyon and starring such names as Marilyn Ghigliotti and Todd Bridges will be coming to the silver screen this summer. (Click Here for Tour Dates) Yet, that's not the only thing making this a special story. The movie is arriving in cinemas by way of the "Also in Theaters" tour, a filmed theatrical road show tour that will take director Lyon across the USA as he promotes the movie and does Q & A sessions after screenings in at least 15 cities.

The entire endeavor will be filmed as part of a TV series also named "Also in Theaters" which will give the world an inside look a version of Hollywood with a lot less red carpet. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of films were released in theaters every week with the mainstream audiences only being aware of a select view. This series takes a look at some of those other movies as they tour the country with a lot less fan fare and far smaller budgets.
