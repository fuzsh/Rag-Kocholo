Taiwan indie pop band Sodagreen will perform with Taiwan pop singer Jam Hsiao and Hong Kong Cantopop singer Denise Ho for a concert Dec. 22 at Shenzhen Stadium.

Sodagreen emerged in the Taiwanese indie music scene after receiving the Grand Jury Award in the Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock Festival in 2004, after which it signed a contract with Willlin Music. The bandâs main vocalist and songwriter Wu Tsing-fong is prominent for his poetic lyrics, unique performing style and wide vocal range.

Hsiao, 26, began his career as a restaurant singer. In May 2007, he rose to fame after only three brief appearances in the first season of the reality talent show, âOne Million Stars.â His wide vocal range, unique singing style, diverse music genres and astounding charisma quickly captured the attention of the Taiwan music industry.

He chose to accept a contract with Warner Music Taiwan in 2008, and became a professional musician. Hsiaoâs solid, manly voice carries explosive force yet is also sensational and often touches the deepest part of audience membersâ hearts, especially at live performances. His deep, clear and penetrating voice makes him stand out from most Chinese singers. Taiwan musician Sky Wu once commented: âJam Hsiaoâs baritone voice is magnetic, his middle range has reached a level of saturation and his high voice is explosive.â

Although Hsiao is well-known for his vocal ability, his musical talents go far beyond just vocals. Besides the drums, he can play the keyboard, piano, saxophone, flute and guitar. He has composed and released many songs.
