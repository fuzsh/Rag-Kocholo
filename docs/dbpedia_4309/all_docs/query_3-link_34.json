Wu is a major pop artist, and sought-after songwriter in the Chinese-language music world, he is sometimes credited for introducing literacy into Mandopop. Sodagreen was one of the first broadly successful indie bands in Taiwan.\n\nAside from creating the music for Oaeen, he also writes songs for numerous Mandarin singers, achieving commercial success and being awarded various music awards, including the Golden Melody Award for Best Composer and the Golden Melody Award for Best Lyricist. Wu Qing-feng started to work on his career as a solo artist in 2018, releasing his debut album Spaceman in 2019. His sophomore release Folio Vol. 1: One and One followed in 2020, a concept album created with various artists and writers, one half of the songs composed by Wu and the other half songs for which he wrote the lyrics. His third solo album, Mallarmé's Tuesday was released on September 30, 2022.[1]\n\nIn 2022 Qing-feng and AURORA released their song \"Storm\" in two versions.
