        "text": "Chinese songs for kids is an easy and fun way for kids to learn Mandarin. Children already enjoy music and hearing the same song on repeat, making this an easy way to expose children to a second language in an engaging way.\n\nJust think of how you learned the ABCs or how a well known melody will conjure up lyrics we haven’t sung in years! Setting words to music makes it a lot easier for people of all ages to commit things to memory.\n\nSinging is also easier than speaking a new language. Especially in tonal languages like Mandarin Chinese, starting by learning how to sing a song will make picking up the language a lot easier.\n\nLyrics in Chinese songs for kids will also help children pick up common vocabulary words and train their sponge-like brains for both language comprehension and speaking.\n\nBest of all, playing songs at home or in the car is stress free for busy parents like me!\n\nSo now that I have you convinced, here are simple steps to use music as a tool for language learning.\n\n1. If your child is learning Chinese as a second language, start with songs or tunes they are already familiar with such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star/小星星 or Two Tigers/兩隻老虎. Learning a new language can be overwhelming for kids, starting with something they are already familiar and confident in with will help them enjoy learning the language.\n\n2. Start with a few songs and then introduce more once the child has become familiar with them. This is to help them not be overwhelmed and also actually learn the words in the songs which is the goal. Stick to one album first, playing it at home or in the car, and then add another album once your child has learned them.\n\nBabies: sing along with the song and use a scarf (following the rhythm of the song, pull over the baby), shaker or blow & pop bubbles while you sing to make the experience even more engaging. Feel free to take their little hands and feet gently and do some motions to go along with the song. Cuddle them as you sing the song to them or bounce them on your lap to the rhythm of the song. Watch them squeal with laughter! Check out this video from Music Together for more ideas.\n\nToddlers and Preschoolers: Add hand motions and dance to the songs. Create your own musical instruments with empty boxes or plastic containers. Invite them to draw as they listen to the songs. Let your kids come up with their own lyrics to the same tune.\n\nGradeschoolers and up: Have them do some copy work by copying the lyrics to their favorite song. Invite them to learn the song on the musical instrument they’re learning. Form a family band or host a singing competition. Better yet, if you want to really immerse yourself in the culture, have a karaoke (KTV) sing off with friends!"
