        "text": "Oaeen: Leading You Into the World of The Beatles\n\nApple Music\n\nOaeen were Beatles fans way before they became one of C-popâs biggest bands. In fact, when they were still known as Sodagreen, they made a pilgrimage to Liverpool in 2010 to pay homage. That theyâve been deeply influenced by the Fab Four is a well-known fact, and here, the band have made a playlist of their favourite songs. Read on for rare personal insights into their selections. âLucy In The Sky With Diamondsâ âWhen I [guitarist Kay Liu] was in college, I watched I Am Sam, a movie that pays tribute to The Beatles and has a soundtrack of Beatles classics. In the story, the father, who has an intellectual disability, is a huge fan and name his daughter Lucy after this song. John Lennon said itâs a tribute to Alice in Wonderland, but rumour has it that itâs actually about psychedelic drugsâLSD is the initials of the songâs title.â â Kay Liu, guitarist âBlackbirdâ âA short but profound song amid their vast catalogue. âBlackbird singing in the dead of nightâ¦ You were only waiting for this moment to be freeâ. Behind these touching lyrics, Paul McCartney is playing guitar with only two fingers, making for a very special soundâone thatâs different to when a guitarist is intent on showing off their skills. The outcome is fresh, unique and original. Itâs Kayâs most played Beatles song.â âHey Judeâ âYesterday, from 2019, is another movie that pays tribute to The Beatles. The story is set in a world where no one but the protagonist can remember The Beatles. The protagonist plays Beatles songs, pretending theyâre his own, and becomes a rock starâeven Ed Sheeran has to surrender to his ability to write songs. (There's also a scene where he asks the protagonist to rename âHey Judeâ to âHey Dudeâ.) It pays tribute to the Beatles in a sweet, hilarious way.â âThe Long And Winding Roadâ âThere are disputes over the production and arrangement of this song, but itâs impossible to deny its commercial success. Looking back, it seems like a farce. Does it really suit The Beatles? Does it go against their original creative vision? Regardless, it was their 20th song to top the Billboard chartsâand also their last.â âStrawberry Fields Foreverâ âWhen I [guitarist Afu] was 30 years old, I had the opportunity to visit Liverpool and go on a Beatles-themed bus tour. The tour guide was telling the story of The Beatles, and we eventually came to the door of a strawberry farm. [Drummer] Wei and I jumped excitedly off the bus, eager to see the inspiration behind the song. But it turned out to be an abandoned-looking red iron gate with âStrawberry Fieldâ written on the wall next to it. âStrawberry Fields Foreverâ also has a special place in Kayâs heart as The Beatlesâ most psychedelic song.â â Afu, guitarist âYesterdayâ ââYesterdayâ is a super classic that many people have re-arranged and covered, but our favourite is the incredibly simple version that they pioneered with just guitar and singing on [1965's] Help!â âHere Comes the Sun / While My Guitar Gently Weepsâ âAs well as being lead guitarist, George Harrison wrote moving tracks like these. Playing these two songs when youâre in a bad mood is very healing. Itâs said that âWhile My Guitar Gently Weepsâ was inspired by the I Ching (Book of Changes), proclaiming a kind of love that is deeply asleep inside of us, while âHere Comes the Sunâ celebrates moments where the worst times have passed.â âYellow Submarineâ â[1966's] Revolver has a British rock flavour that still endures today. The album includes âYellow Submarineâ, âAnd Your Bird Can Singâ, âFor No Oneâ, âI Want to Tell Youâ and âGot to Get You into My Lifeâ, all songs worth listening to.â âMaxwell's Silver Hammerâ âWeâre recommending a lesser-known song. When we recorded the song âAfter Playingâ on Sodagreenâs Daylight of Spring, this was constantly on our mind.â âAll You Need Is Loveâ âWe really like the simple side of The Beatles. Itâs shocking to think this was released in 1967. How could such a classic song be written more than 50 years ago and still be so relevant today? Love will aways the solution to all things. And, Georgeâs solo in the middle is highly recommended listening.â âCome Togetherâ ââCome Togetherâ comes from [1965âs] Abbey Road, where their creative expression was at its peak. This song has reached the point where nobody in the rock scene doesnât know it. The drums on the right and the bass on the left echo each other from start to finish. The arrangement of the whole song is so simple but so dense, and the music and lyrics also seem to fit together just right.â âLet It Beâ âIn high school, the music my [Kayâs] classmates were listening to was either the Japanese metal band, X Japan, or American folk artist, Richard Marx. Nobody was listening to The Beatles! I took advantage of a discount at the record store to buy [1970's] Let It Be and I was immediately touched by the melody of the title track. I later realised this was the last song they released, but it was also my first step into their fascinating musical world.â âA Day In the Lifeâ ââA Day In The Lifeâ is from [1967's] Sgt. Pepperâs Lonely Hearts Club Band. This was The Beatlesâ first concept album. Itâs also Weiâs favourite album.â âDay Tripperâ âIt sounds like a classic â60s rock song, with a strong, well-arranged melody. Today, fewer people think about how to create a classic melody progressionâbut thatâs what makes this so impressive.â âHer Majestyâ âThe special thing about this track, the last on Abbey Road, is that all the sounds gradually pan from far right to far left. Although itâs only 23 seconds long, it leaves a strong impression.â"
