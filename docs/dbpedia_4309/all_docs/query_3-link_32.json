        "text": "Yesterday (Aug 31), national treasure Stefanie Sun, 44, took to her Instagram to share a video of her hamming it up with Taiwanese band Sodagreen's lead vocalist Wu Qing Feng, 40.\n\nNetizens quickly speculated that the two singers are collaborating on a project. And guess what, they're spot on.\n\nIn the video she posted, Stef appeared to be holding in her pee while knocking urgently on a door. She then opens it to find Qing Feng inside, cleaning the toilet bowl while holding a wine glass.\n\nHer caption? \"Can't wait any longer?\"\n\nYes, we know, totally random, right? Even Singaporean chanteuse Kit Chan couldn't help but comment: \"Wtf!?\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Qing Feng's vid, he's seemingly lamenting to himself about \"looking for someone to drink with [him] today\". He then opens a door to see Stef posing flamboyantly.\n\nNope, the stars weren't trying to create a viral TikTok moment. (Although it could easily be one.) Turns out, they were hinting at their new collab, which was dropped earlier today (Aug 31).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the song is about getting drunk.\n\nDropping the teaser for their new single, Zui Gui Ah Q [Mandarin for 'Drunkard Ah Q'], both Stef and Qing Feng wrote: \"At the salon as a guest... Drunk already!”\n\nStef then added these hashtags: \"Never shared the same stage before?\" and \"[You've] Never invited me?\"\n\nWell, better late than never.\n\nPhotos: Stefanie Sun/Wu Qing Feng/Instagram"
