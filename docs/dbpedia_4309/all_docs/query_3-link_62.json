Once again proving his longstanding influence in the music industry, three of his songs charted on Global Top Mandopop Songs - 晴天 (#3) a well loved hit in the past two decades, 擱淺 coming hot at #4, and 說好不哭 (#8), his more recent work.\n\nWell-loved through the decades, JJ Lin (#2), Eason Chan (#3) and Jolin Tsai (#10) also maintain their stronghold on the list of Global Top Mandopop Artists as they continue to captivate listeners. Alongside these Mandopop icons are rising stars Eric Chou (#4) and 告五人 (#7), who've brought fresh sounds to fans of the genre.\n\nThe Top Global Mandopop Song of the Year goes to Ronghao Li's The Dark Plum Sauce (烏梅子醬). In a testament to the genre's significance in key cultural moments, five of the top 10 list of most-streamed Mandopop songs are featured in some of the hottest movies and TV shows. This includes WeiBird's Red Scarf (如果可以) (#2), Shi Shi's Remembered (眼淚記得你) (#5), 831's Miss You 3000 (想見你想見你想見你) (#6) and Eric Chou's How Have You Been? (你，好不好？) (#9) and Graduation (最後一堂課) (#10).\n\nSpotify's reach has enabled fans and listeners from all over the world to connect with Mandopop and markets like Brazil, Mexico and Germany are amongst the latest markets seeing increased consumption.\n\n\"It's incredible to see Mandopop consumption growing globally as Spotify continues to connect music cultures with audiences from all over the world, showcasing a slate of extraordinary talents - both seasoned and emerging, driving music discovery. 2023 Spotify Wrapped is all about celebrating the real, the realer and the realest listening moments that defined our year, and as we look ahead, we're excited to continue in our efforts to foster the further discovery of the genre while deepening connections between artists and listeners,\" says Kossy Ng, Spotify Head of Music, Asia\n\nHead to this playlist on Spotify to listen to our editor's picks for the best Mandopop tracks of 2023, including the songs in this year's top 20 list of Global Mandopop Top Songs: Best of 最 Hit 華語榜 2023.\n\nThe full 2023 Wrapped Global Top Mandopop lists can be found below.
