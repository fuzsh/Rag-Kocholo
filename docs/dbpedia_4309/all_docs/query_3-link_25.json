        "text": "Has anyone noticed how interesting Taiwanese band names are? While planning for our Taiwanese boba tea event for SocieTea 🍵, Chang-Hung (Rainbow) Liao and I brainstormed about music choices for the event. It was then we realised how the English translations of Taiwanese band names can be SO literal/random. Here are some examples: 🎙 The Little Tigers 小虎队 - A band extremely popular in the 80s and 90s. I asked Rainbow what would be her idea of this band just by the English and she imagined a few people dressed up in tiger leotards. But the reality is a band made up of three charming young men with clean and innocent image singing family-friendly songs. 🎙Sodagreen 苏打绿 - A popular band in Asia with a mega hit song - Little Love Song which people can't stop singing in karaoke. Apparently they added the term 'green' because it sounded better and also it was the favourite colour of one of the members. One fun fact was that this band name was trademarked and the band lost it during a dispute with their manager and they eventually went with \"Odaeen\" (魚丁糸). Doesn't have the same effect does it? 🎙No party for Cao Dong 草东没派对 - Whoever came up with this name is a genius. It is so random to the point that it's got stuck in my head. Whoever Cao Dong is, this name is definitely partying in my head. 🎙Accusefive 告五人 - Another genius name. How else can you make 'Sue 5 People' sound sophisticated other than by ending it with a number? Btw, this band happened to walk past a court bulletin while naming their band. 🎙Your Woman Sleep with Others 老王乐队 - The most unthinkable translation of all. The literal translation means 'Old Wang's Band' but Old Wang has a funny Chinese reference of a person who has an adulterous partner. 🎙EggPlantEgg 茄子蛋 - A wonderful wordplay which makes the reader re-read this multiple times to understand. 🎙Sorry Youth 拍谢少年 - A name that makes me feel sorry. The Chinese name of this band is actually transliterated from the Hokkien dialect so it took me a few seconds to figure out. An interesting Hokkien translation. 🎙White eyes 白目 - A very literal translation as the Taiwanese term is used as a derogatory term to refer to people who can't read the room. A way to make an offensive term sound unoffensive. A conclusion that I have for these English names is that it is so random (and sometimes funny) and that's why it is so memorable. And this is how creative work should be - unthinkable, unforgettable and unreasonable. 😉 What's the most ridiculous English translation of pop bands you've ever heard of? #creative #translation #music #taiwanese"
