        "text": "4 Jul â€“ Rumours are rife that there is a fall out between good friends and Sodagreen members, Wu Qing-Feng (Greeny) and Liu Jia-Kai (Kay).\n\nAs reported on ET Today, fans of the band recently noticed that the two no longer follow each other on Instagram and Weibo, with sources claiming that the two had a falling out due to Kay wanting to go solo amid Sodagreen's return as a group.\n\nIt was alleged that Kay had negotiated with many record labels for his solo career, and later worked with Aaron Yan on a single. However, the single was taken off the shelves within 18 hours of its release due to Aaron's sexual scandal with a minor.\n\nWu reportedly was unhappy with this, seeing that the collaboration with Aaron could also affect Sodagreen's work in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked about the supposed rift, Sodagreen's leader A Fu stated that the group is still working together and practicing for their upcoming performance in China.\n\nMeanwhile, Kay responded to the media, \"I don't know about this. I haven't followed this matter.\""
