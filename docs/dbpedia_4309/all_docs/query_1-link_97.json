        "text": "The inaugural, three-day F1 Rocks event has launched in Singapore, with Hong Kong pop superstar Jacky Cheung headlining, along with Taiwan acts A-Mei Sodagreen and Da Mouth.\n\nArtists including Beyonce, No Doubt and Black Eyed Peas are performing at the remainder of the Sept. 24-26 event, part of a planned series of shows tied into the Formula 1 Grand Prix night race in Singapore on Sept. 27.\n\nThe concerts are organized by Universal Music Group International (UMGI) joint venture All the Worlds, the event production company, in partnership with racing body Formula One Administration Ltd. John Giddings of the Solo Agency is global agent and promoter, LG is the sponsor.\n\nThe opening show’s highlight last night (Sept. 24) was the first-ever collaboration by Cheung and A-Mei, Taiwan’s biggest pop export. A-Mei, has sold over 8 million albums worldwide, according to her label. Her top-selling EMI album “Sisters” (1996) has moved over 1.3 million copies in Taiwan alone, according to her Hong Kong-based label Gold Typhoon Music, which now handles EMI releases in China and Taiwan.\n\nAfter the inaugural night race last year in Singapore, tickets for the actual race and hotel bookings are said to be down this time.\n\n“Given the year’s economic context, it’s not surprising that ticket sales were sluggish,” reports Justin Chew, director of F1 projects at the Singapore Tourism Board. “We’re confident in reversing this situation with F1 Rocks, a series of star-studded concerts, and attracting last-minute bookings to fill the seats.”\n\nHollywood actress Lindsay Lohan hosts the three-day F1 Rocks event at Fort Canning Park. Lohan replaced Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, who pulled out of hosting the F1 Rocks television entertainment show.\n\nTonight’s (Sept. 25) concert line-up features No Doubt, ZZ Top, N.E.R.D. and Simple Minds. Superstar acts Beyonce and Black Eyed Peas headline the closing day event tomorrow with support from Australia’s leading DJ, Havana Brown. F1 Rocks marks the first time Beyonce will perform in the island city state.\n\nStandard ticket price for the three-day event is $450 Singapore ($321) while Gold VIP tickets are priced between $550 Singapore ($392) to $850 Singapore ($607). Saturday day tickets have sold out.\n\n“Response to F1 Rocks has been overwhelming,” said Paul Morrison, CEO of All The Worlds. “The F1 Rocks TV special is expected to be broadcast in over 180 countries in the next two weeks.”\n\nThe Singapore event launches the F1 Rocks initiative, which will see concerts staged in conjunction with several Formula 1 Grand Prix races around the world in 2010."
