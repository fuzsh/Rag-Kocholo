        "text": "4 Jan â€“ After pursuing a solo career following Sodagreen's three-year hiatus from showbiz, lead vocalist Wu Tsing-fong surprised many when he announced that he and manager Lin Wei-che will be parting ways.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao, the two parties recently posted a joint statement, saying that they will continue to be friends despite no longer working together.\n\nWu stated that he is thankful to be able to develop as a performer independently with the encouragement from everyone, and that he gained a lot from working with Lin, whom he regarded like his own mentor and father figure.\n\nHowever, he now believes that he is able to take the responsibility of managing his own life, and that his manager has supported this decision.\n\nThe singer will be setting up his own personal company to handle all of his work, while Lin will concentrate on his own projects.\n\nFans who saw the news are now expressing concern as to whether the end of the partnership will also mean the end of Sodagreen as a group. However, both parties made no mention about Wu's role in the group or its future."
