        "text": "\"I don't play any instrument on the album but a little piano. And without the help of the band members, I completed the songs with my piano playing and humming,\" he adds.\n\nThe title song, Spaceman, has an intro of over one minute, involving musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, violin and drums, and tells the story of a spaceman returning to Earth after years in a space station alone.\n\nAnother song, The Carnival of Babel, was inspired by a novel, The Tower of Babel by Australian writer Morris West, which Wu read in 2017.\n\n\"None of the songs are like what I wrote for Sodagreen. And I was very surprised when the album was completed,\" Wu says. \"At the same time, I felt nervous because with the band I felt safe. Now, I am a soloist and I have to face people on my own.\"\n\nSome of his fans posted on Wu's Sina Weibo account, which has over 10 million followers, saying that \"you are capable of turning something ordinary into a romance\", while others look forward to his reunion with Sodagreen.\n\nDuring the past three years, Wu also showed up at reality shows, such as a talent show, The Coming One, filmed for the Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video; and The Big Band, which was produced by iQiyi and focused on Chinese indie rock bands.\n\n\"I would never attend those shows if I was with the band as I was afraid of speaking in public. But now I have opened up and have adjusted to my new role as a soloist,\" he says.\n\nThe three-year break of Sodagreen is coming to an end soon. Though he didn't disclose the plan of the band, Wu insists that he will return to the band as vocalist and his solo career will be suspended.\n\n\"I have kind of enjoyed the transition between my role with the band and my role as a soloist. It's like different ways of expressing myself,\" Wu says."
