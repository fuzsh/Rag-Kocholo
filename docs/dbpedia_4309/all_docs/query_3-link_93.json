        "text": "Introduction\n\nMusic marketing relates to the methods of accessing to new music. “Music marketing has always been, and always be, about exposure and discovery. Without exposure, an artist’s new music will not be heard” (Kusek and Leonhard, 2005:57). Radio and MTV had been major media between labels and customers. Major labels create a model for promoting new songs: producing a killer video, encouraging airplay on radio and TV, and because of it, the CD sales increase. Major labels control most of the music marketing industry. However, the model has been changed because of the Internet. People on the Internet find new music on their own free-will, instead of receiving messages from the labels passively. In the first paper, music labels used radio and MTV to promote their new music in the past. In the second paper, I’ll present how do music labels start to utilize the Internet to reach their target audience.\n\nPresent\n\nThe Internet is shifting the marketing strategies. Music labels can spend less money and reach a more targeted group of people. This section shows how music labels utilize the Internet to talk to their customers.\n\n(1)The Transition\n\nAccording to Anderson’s survey (2008), Americans spend more and more time on the Internet, less and less time on the traditional media, like TV and radio. The increased usage of the Internet is more notable on Gen Yers (age 18-26). Gen Yers are also major customers of music. “Historically, the main consumers of contemporary popular music, especially rock music, have been young people, between 12 and 25” (Shuker, 2008:176). The influence of TV and radio is becoming less and less since young people’s attention is moving to the Internet.\n\nFigure 1: The declining usage of traditional media and the increase of the Internet. From: Anderson, J.R. (2008) Interactive Marketing Data Overview, US 2007, Cambridge: Forrester.\n\nCommercial radio\n\nAs the discussion in the first paper stated, commercial radio is not the major resource for discovering new music anymore. Major labels buy the airplays for popular artists. Independent music and labels has fewer chances to be heard on the radio. The homogenized playlist decreases the effectiveness of promoting music. However, the Internet brings radio a new stage. Internet radio and podcasts are becoming alternative tools for promoting music (Kusek and Leonhard, 2005).\n\nMTV\n\nMTV changed the whole format of its programming in the late 1990s. Reality shows became the major content, instead of music videos (Groskop, 2006). “The channel has diversified, shifting its emphasis away from music. It no longer shows any music videos during the day, devoting a large part of its airtime to reality and lifestyle TV shows” (Groskop, 2006:39). Even a 24-hours music channel stopped playing music videos. The influence of MTV is fading out.\n\nWhy do music labels need to embrace the Internet?\n\nFirst, although music labels feel threatened from the Internet because of illegal downloading, legal downloading can music sales. Figure 2 and figure 3 present the growing market of digital downloading in the past 5 years. There are more and more digital music service, authorized songs and revenue. The revenue from digital downloading increased from 0.4 billion dollars in 2004 to 2.9 billion dollars in 2007.\n\nFigure 2: Reinventing an Industry – The Digital Difference Over 5 Years from IFPI Digital Music Report 2008 Revolution Innovation Responsibility\n\nFigure3: Digital Music Revenues US$ Billions from IFPI Digital Music Report2008 Revolution Innovation Responsibility.\n\nSecond, Parikh (1999) presents a music business model where labels play an important role in producing, marketing and distributing music. They are intermediaries between musicians and customers. “Having very limited access to marketing and distribution channels, most emerging artists cannot compete on their own” (Parikh, 1999:3).\n\nFigure4: The Current Model from The Music Industry in the Digital World: Waves of Changes (Parikh, 1999)\n\nThe emergence of the Internet changed the model. “The ubiquity and immediacy of the Internet provides a huge, frictionless environment to match buyers with sellers”(Parikh, 1999:3). Compared to traditional media, the Internet controls marketing and distributing at the same time. People used to listen to a song from a radio show and go to a CD store to purchase the physical CD, now they can complete the whole process online. The Internet serves as retailers, like amazon.com and iTunes store. Internet radio is becoming a new type of radio. Furthermore, the Internet is also a marketing tool to customers. Therefore, Parikh emphasizes the influence of the Internet in the “The First Wave” figure.\n\nFigure5: The First Wave from The Music Industry in the Digital World: Waves of Changes (Parikh, 1999)\n\nThe Internet has changed the music business. How do labels utilize the new power?\n\n(2)A Chance to Talk to the Audience: Direct Marketing\n\nMajor labels used to adopt mass-marketing to promote their products. Kusek and Leonhard (2005) propose direct marketing as a new marketing strategy. It helps build relationships between musicians and fans, “fostering the loyalty that often comes with such relationship”(Kusek and Leonhard, 2005:67). For example, a mailing list informs fans of latest news about tours and albums, and it also provides musicians profiles about their customers. Musicians know who the customers were. Kusek and Leonhard state that the Internet works well when it is targeting a market niche. “Niche marketing allows labels to focus on their efforts and approach on a smaller number of fans, and lets them hone the messages to address the needs of a defined group of people” (Kusek and Leonhard, 2005:68).\n\nOfficial websites, online community, and mail list\n\nMost musicians start using the Internet by creating an official website. An official website usually includes a home page, biography, tour schedules, audio clips and video clips. Since there are tens of thousands of other musicians who use the official website as a promotional tool, as a result, how a website can keep audience’s attention is a critical issue. Lathrop and Pettigrew (2003) notice the first mission is giving newcomers a good first impression with clear messages, easy navigation and visual appealing. Then, an effective official website should keep the audience coming back by staying up to date. The website should also offer valuable features and information unavailable anywhere else. It should keep a good balance of information, rather than provide all at once (Lathrop and Pettigrew, 2003). The typical music fans like to feel so close to the act and its music. The more personal the relationship is, the more loyal the fans are. Based on the unique characteristics of the Internet, more interaction between fans and musicians is inputted by online communities and e-mail communication through the official website. Online communities could be a chat room, a forum or a discussion board, which provide a space for fans to share their love fro music, opinions and experiences together. Fans also have chances to know other fans and exchange information. The more they engage in the online community, the more they may become diehard fans (Lathrop and Pettigrew, 2003).\n\nExample 1: Nine Inch Nails and official website\n\nNine Inch Nails released their album “Ghosts I–IV” in 2007. The tracks were available online before the physical album was released. Moreover, it was licensed under Creative Commons. Then in May, 2008, another album, “The Slip” was released on Nine Inch Nails’ official website for free downloading. Without any pervious announcement and promotion, “The Slip” passed 1.6 million downloading and it is still growing. The album peaked at position 14 on the Billboard 200 for 2008 (Billboard, 2009). Nine Inch Nails talked to fans through the official website and knew how to make fans like them more.\n\nExample 2: BBS as a music marketing tool in Taiwan\n\nSeveral musicians start to use PTT, a popular BBS service in Taiwan in 2004. Because of the high popularity, musicians and bands create their own discussion board on the BBS service, and then talk to fans directly. A famous indie band “Sodagreen” likes to build close relationships with their fans. They even announce exclusive new album news on the BBS. What makes BBS different with other online tools? BBS is presented as a kind of subculture. There are some unique characteristics for users to be engage in BBS. An administrator of a discussion board usually set some rules for posting an article. For example, no illegal file-sharing, no article with one sentence only. Because of the interaction with musicians, fans also know what should talk about and what topics are acceptable by knowing more about the personalities of musicians. For examples, Sodagreen care about unauthorized photos during the shows. If there were any fans talking about taking pictures on the BBS, others who know the taboo might try to stop them. So both the fans and musicians form a unique communication with each other. Fans feel special with their close relationship with musicians and could be more loyal than other fans (Kusek and Leonhard, 2005).\n\nNew radio: Internet radio and podcast\n\nA variety of Internet radio and podcasts provide audiences diverse choices of music. Audiences choose programs that fit to their music taste, instead of receiving the same music from commercial radio. Internet radio becomes a great resource for discovering new music and artists. For example, Pandora is an Internet radio features a recommendation system. It shows related music and artists according to users’ taste. Therefore, users have chances to discover more music by listening to it. Moreover, podcasts can be subscribed and downloaded to audience’s MP3 player. “Podcasting will have as profound an effect on traditional radio as blogging has had on publishing” (Kusek and Leonhard, 2005:62). In contrast with Benkler’s (2006) discussion in “The Trouble with Mass Media,” internet radio and podcasts are more diverse than traditional media. They display all kinds of music genre and meet audience’s need from different niche market. They could be adopted by labels as low-end technology since labels spend less on it than traditional media.\n\nFuture\n\nThis section is going to discuss about the future of music marketing. Music labels will still rely on the Internet to enforce the marketing, based on Parikh’s next wave model and the popularities of social media. Furthermore, the growth of mobile technology will also accelerate music labels to adopt mobile phones as a marketing tool in the future.\n\n(1)Parikh’s Next Wave\n\nParikh (1999) discusses the structure of the music industry in his next wave model. He states that the role of labels will disappear, and be replaced by the Internet. “The primary channel for marketing and distributing music will be the Internet. The new Internet-based information dissemination model will replace the old logistics-focused transportation model” (Parikh, 1999:7).\n\nFigure6: The Next Wave from The Music Industry in the Digital World: Waves of Changes (Parikh, 1999)\n\nFrom the model, the influence of the Internet is enlarged. It is a multi-functional media, which includes music promotion, distribution and consumption. Moreover, with the popularity of social media, marketers should utilize social media. Gillin (2007) believes that “social media offers marketers a chance to break this gridlock and engage with their customers in a whole new way” (Gillin, 2007:8). Technologies help form the networks and enforce young people rely on the opinions from their peers. Therefore, we’ll see more marketing strategy through social media.\n\n(2)New MTV: YouTube\n\nFounded in 2005, YouTube is the most popular video sharing site, which tops 3rd globally (Alexa.com, 2009). It encourages user-generated content, however, with the growth of popularity, more and more music videos are uploaded to the website. “YouTube has more viewers than broadcast MTV, and this holds true not just for Gen Y adults, but for all US adults” (McQuivey, 2008:2).\n\nYouTube reflects some phenomenon. First, people can gather popularities through a killer video. People don’t need to spend a lot of money making a fancy video or buy airing. As long as the content is attractive enough, people can be a star easily.\n\nSecond, according to Christensen (2004), YouTube could a replacement technology for independent labels. They can broadcast the videos with lower prices and spread the videos widely. People also could watch the videos that they like repeatedly.\n\nThird, although the copyright issue is still a controversy of YouTube, some labels see opportunities on YouTube. In October, 2008, Click-to-buy buttons on music videos were launched. Viewers can download the audio track on a music video page. People used to watch their favorite music videos on MTV and need to go to record store and buy the CD. Now the new function on YouTube tries to make video fans become music consumers directly.\n\nFinally, according to the research, “The YouTube Viewer’s Ad And Social Media Habits” (Haven, 2008), 1 in 10 online adults views online video on YouTube weekly. YouTube users also have the personalities of sharing. They’re willing to share and recommend products than others. If these customers love a music video, they’re willing to share with others. Labels should notice the influence and try to utilize it.\n\nExample 3: OK Go\n\nThe American band released their second album in 2005. They produced a low-cost video for their single “A Million Ways” with a simple camera. In the video, band members performed a highly choreographed dance in a backyard. The video was downloaded more than 500,000 times in a month because of their creative and impressive dancing (MTV.com, 2005). Then OK Go released a similar video,“ Here It Goes Again”, featuring with dancing on treadmills. This video attracted more attention on YouTube. It generated more than 40,000,000 views, rated 2nd as “Top favorited (All the time)-music” and 22nd as “Most Viewed (All the Time) – Music” (YouTube, 2009). The band became famous because of the videos on YouTube. The sales of the single, “Here It Goes Again” also topped 34th on US Hot 100 chart (Billboard, 2006). A creative music video and YouTube are definitely successful promotional tools for the band.\n\n(3)MySpace\n\nMySpace was founded in 2003 by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe (Vincent, 2007). Different with an official website, “with MySpace, your audience is built in” (Vincent, 2007:10). Users invite their favorite artists as friends and view the new updates from their favorite artists. Users not only find news, photos and videos from the artists’ profile pages, they also interact with the content by leaving comments and sharing it with others. Browsing each artist’s MySpace profile page is more easily and quickly than going to each one’s official website individually. Furthermore, MySpace provides a platform for streaming music files, videos, news and message boards.\n\nIn the future, merchandise and concert tickets will also be available from the artist’s MySpace profile page. Major labels and independent labels are benefited by setting a profile page with easy steps and low cost. So a lot of indie artists gather on the website. MySpace even created its own label, MySpace Records, and contrasted with artists from the website. MySpace is the first social networking website that merges the role of a record company.\n\nIn 2008, Universal, Sony BMG and Warner music joined MySpace music service. Users could listen to free and authorized streaming music. Those tracks are also available for users to build their own playlist. Users get more content to personalize their music profile. Several bands, for example, U2 and Guns n roses, released the tracks from their albums on MySpace profile page prior to the physical CDs were released. The privilege on MySpace shows its influence for music fans and musicians. In the future, more labels and musicians will spread their promotional messages through MySpace.\n\n(4)Mobile Music Marketing\n\nThe future of music marketing relates to the mobile. People may listen to streaming music through mobile phones, connect to other music playlist or know similar artists. The improvement of the device is one of the factor. “Almost 60% of mobile operators think that mobile music has the highest revenue potential of all mobile data services” (Lussanet and Veen, 2005). “EMI’s mobile revenues grew 85% last year, mostly from ring tones — faster than its PC downloads and subscriptions business grew” (Lussanet and Veen, 2005). Second, the 3G network also accelerates the growth of mobile music. People now can access to the online communities through the mobile phone. PC is not the only tool for surfing the Internet.\n\nAs a result of the growth of mobile music, labels will spread the promotional message through mobile phones. For example, iPhone applications are available from some artists for fans to download. Furthermore, the communication through mobile phones will be more instant and geographic between musicians and fans. Hutchison(2008) mentioned “proximity marketing” as a mobile marketing tool. It is the localized wireless distribution of advertising content system with a particular location. People will receive information and download coupons for concerts that near their location through the proximity marketing service. Or people will listen to streaming live music that near their location. Using the proximity marketing, customer will receive more personal and relevant promotional messages.\n\nBesides, according to the news from Mi2N.com (2008), CISAC (The International Confederation of Authors and Composers Societies) predicted that in 2010, half of all digital content will be delivered to mobile devices. Websites designed for mobile phones will be necessary for musicians. Mobile websites will allow mobile fans to access to the websites quickly without scrolling a lot of pages to gain the information. Other related music websites and social networking sites will move to the mobile, too. Fans will connect with their favorite musicians more instantly.\n\nConclusion: Let the music play\n\nMoreau (2009) states that poor content and marketing will threaten the future of the music industry. He believed that there are two reasons for the decline of music sales, one is labels put too many resources on too few artists, the other is that they forgot to produce and market quality content. The labels used to rely on superstars that they created to sell music. Now the music style is more diverse, all kinds of musicians could find their own audience through different kinds of music marketing.\n\nWith a more direct communication, what the music really sounds like deter the customers’ decisions more than ever. The content of music will be the best selling point in the music business.\n\nReferences\n\nAlexna.com. (2009), Top Sites.
