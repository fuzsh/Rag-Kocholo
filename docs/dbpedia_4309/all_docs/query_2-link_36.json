        "text": "28 Feb â€“ Sodagreen has recently released their comeback single, \"Tomorrow Will Be Fine\" after more than three years of hiatus.\n\nAs reported on Epoch Times, the band's frontman Wu Tsing-fong, who spoke to the media about the new song, shared that the song was written to express hope for the future, as he himself experienced after the band went on hiatus in 2016.\n\n\"The three-year break for me is a turning point in my life. A time to re-examine myself, think about the future, gather my energy and restart,\" he said.\n\nAside from performing the new song at Wu's concert at the Taipei Dome on 23 February, the band also launched the music video on the same day. On the other hand, the digital single had hit shelves early in the morning of 24 February.\n\n\"We always use our music to communicate with our fans and to convey what all the six of us wanted to say. We all believe that tomorrow will be fine. This is a song to encourage ourselves, and therefore a song that belongs to anyone who needs encouragement,\" he added.\n\nAt the same time, the singer stated that royalties from the said single will be donated to the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families - an organisation that provides services to vulnerable children and families under the age of 18."
