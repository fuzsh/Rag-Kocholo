        "text": "2. Company Profile Britannia Industries Limited(BIL) • In 1892, with an initial investment of Rs. 295. • By 1910, with the advent of electricity, Britannia mechanised its operations. • In 1921, it became the first company east of the Suez Canal to use imported gas ovens. • During the tragic World War-II, the Government reposed its trust in Britannia by contracting it to supply large quantities of \"service biscuits\" to the armed forces. • Leadership position in Indian bakery market with Rs.124 billion . • Market share of ~38% in the industry. • It has an annual production capacity of 433,000 tonnes and has got 600,000 outlets across India. • In International markets over 30 Countries and a number two brand in the UAE and Oman.\n\n3. PRODUCTS OVERVIEW • GLUCOSE BISCUITS – BRITANNIA TIGER • MARIE BISCUITS – BRITANNIA MARIEGOLD, NUTRICHOICE • COOKIES – GOOD DAY BUTTER, GOOD DAY CASHEW, GOOD DAY PISTA BADAM • CRACKERS – 50-50 CHASKA-MASKA • CREM BISCUITS – TREAT(orange, pineapple, strawberry, fruit) BISCUITS\n\n5. INGREDIENTS SALT WATER FAT & OILS SUGAR MILK & MILK PRODUCTS FLAVOUR COLOUR EMULSIFIER LEAVNING AGENT\n\n6. Wheat Flour • Produced by gradual separation from the Bran in wheat. • Principal ingredient in Bakery products. • Unique ability to form Gluten. • Gluten is made of Gliadin & Glutenin (Insoluble Proteins). • Soluble proteins present in wheat flour are Albumin & Globulin. • Gluten is elastic–like and forms matrix. • Gluten forms only on mixing with water • Gliadin contributes to elasticity & Glutenin imparts strength (Resistance). • Both quantity & Quality of gluten are important in assessing the strength of flour.\n\n7. WATER • 2nd major ingredient in Bakery products. • Hydration of proteins. • Acts as a dispersion medium for sugar & other chemicals. • The consistency of dough largely depends on water. • An excellent leavening agent. • Medium hard water is preferred for most of the Bakery products, as some of the mineral salts (like Calcium salts) have a strengthening effect on gluten and some (like Ammonium salts) serve as yeast foods.\n\n8. FATS & OILS • Act as lubricants. • Tenderizing agent. • Provides texture/structure to the product. • Act as aerating agents. • Eating quality (Palatability). • Moisture-barrier in finished products.\n\n9. SUGAR • Particle size of sugar greatly affects baking properties. • Gluten Development. • Leavening. • Creaming. • Gelatinization. • Caramelization.\n\n10. SALT • Preservative. • Texture aid. • Binder. • Fermentation Control. • Flavor Enhancer.\n\n11. MILK & MILK PRODUCTS • Flavor and taste contribution. • To enhance crust color and bloom. • To improve tenderness of the product. • To improve the texture without altering the symmetry and crumb color. • To reduce the greasy feeling in sandwich creams. • As an alternate to eggs (use of whey protein concentrates).\n\n12. FLAVOURS • Taste enhancer • Dispersibilty in water or fat as per requirement • Expression/Stability at the product pH. • Compatibility to the product as the expression of flavor generally varies with the fat content in the product. • Masking any undesirable odour from the product. • Closeness to the natural product envisaged.\n\n13. COLOURS • To provide identity to the food product. • To provide variety to the consumer. • To correct the natural variations in the color of the food. • To enhance the natural color but at levels lower than that usually attached to the given food. • To protect food products, flavors and vitamins that can be affected by exposure to light.\n\n14. EMULSIFIERS • Starch complexing (anti-staling) • Protein complexing (Dough strengthening) • Viscosity modification • Foaming and aeration • Texture modification • Lubrication • Crystal modification • As Wetting agents & solubilisers. • Suspension & dispersion.\n\n15. LEAVNING AGENT • Rise the volume of dough • Baking powder contains baking soda and the right amount of acid to react with it. • Batters made with double acting baking powder rise twice; • once when dry and moist ingredients are mixed together, and again when the product is baked. 1-S.B.C.(Sodium bicarbonate) 2-A.B.C.(Ammonium bicarbonate)\n\n16. 1-S.B.C.(Sodium bicarbonate) • Above 70 °C, it gradually decomposes into sodium carbonate, water and carbon dioxide. The conversion is fast at 250 °C 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2\n\n17. 2-A.B.C.(Ammonium bicarbonate) • Leavening agents where in application low final moisture content is reached in baked products such as cookies and crackers. NH4HCO3 → NH3 + H2O + CO2\n\n18. Dough conditioner A dough conditioner is any chemical added to dough to strengthen its texture or otherwise improve it in some way. SMBS (Sodium metabisulphite) • Inorganic compound of chemical formula Na2S2O5. • It is used in biscuit industry to modify the rheological properties of hard dough. • It is mellowing agent which breaks down Gluten strands as well as softens them. • SMBS is used as reductant to soften and increase the extensibility of dough used for crackers and hard biscuits.\n\n20. PREMIXING\n\n25. SIEVE\n\n26. LECITHIN PASTE PREPARATION 1 Kg Lecithin + 3 Kg HVO Mixture dumped to Lecithin Paste Preparation Tank Steam from boiler Mixture melts and ready to be used\n\n27. BUTTER PREPARATION Butter melting tank Filter Load cell Storage tank Mixture\n\n28. SKIM MILK POWDER(SMP) PREPARATION 75 Kg of SMP 150 Kg water Solution prepared & ready to be used in the mixer\n\n29. CREAMING • The function of creaming is to entrap air and to mix all ingredients. • It involves mixing of fat, sugar, flavor except flour, creamed for 8-12 minutes.\n\n30. MIXING Then it is mixed with other ingredients for further 2 minutes. SIGMA ARM MIXTURE\n\n31. CONTINOUS MIXTURE\n\n32. Benefits of Continuous Mixing • Simplifies the mixing process • Disperses ingredients consistently • Simplifies dough feed equipment • Provides tight control over the mixing process • Is safer , more sanitary and can be operated with less labour and energy than batch mixing • Is easy to sanitize, maintain, clean and inspect due to the clamshell design • No dough contamination because the dough is never exposed to the environment • Is easy to operate due to the user friendly controls • Controls ingredient metering to the mixer so it’s precise and uninterrupted.\n\n34. MOULDING FORMING (Rotary moulding/sheeting and cutting)\n\n35. SHEETING\n\n36. MOULDING • A-Forcing roller C-Extraction roller E-Extraction web H-Hopper • B-Moulding roller D-Scraper(Knife) F-Cleaning scrapper\n\n37. CUTTING\n\n38. BAKING The zones are classified as: There are 7 independent zones in all three plants. These are a) Proofing zone: zone 1 & 2 (Structure is set here) b) Puffing zone: zone 3 & 4 (Product get oven spring) c) Baking zone: zone 5 & 6 (Moisture removal of product) d) Colouring zone: zone 6 & 7\n\n40. COOLING These baked biscuits are then passed on to cooling conveyors for natural cooling prior to packaging. The temperatures are brought down to room temperatures. It should between 35°- 40°C.\n\n41. STACKING\n\n42. PACKAGING These biscuits are then stacked and fed into packing machine for packing. These packs are then put into secondary packaging like cartons to be transported to retailers. Packing machine can be selected as per the plant capacities and nature of packing.\n\n44. Packing Materials Primary Packaging Materials:  BOPP films(Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene)  Aluminium Foils  Plastic Trays Secondary Packaging Materials:  PET jars (Polyethylene terephthalate)  ATC (Air traffic control) boxes  CBB (Corrugated Board Boxes)\n\n46. Metal detector The \"Balanced Coil\" System Excellence with X-ray\n\n47. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY • The transformer then converts the 11 KVA supply to 33 KV. • Volt remains almost constant to 33 KV but ampere fluctuates with variation in power consumption during production and other factors. It is generally of 25K amp. • There are 4 sets of A.C Diesel generators assemble for emergency purpose. Three is of 625 KVA and one is of 500 KVA.\n\n49. OVEN\n\n50. FLOUR RECIVING"
