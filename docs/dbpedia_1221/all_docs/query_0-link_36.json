Company Profile Britannia Industries Limited(BIL) *In 1892, with an initial investment of 295 ₹ in Kolkata. * *During the tragic World War-II, the Government reposed its trust in Britannia by contracting it to supply large quantities of \"service biscuits\" to the armed forces. *Leadership position in Indian bakery market with 124 ₹ billion. * *Market share of ~38% in the industry. * *It has an annual production capacity of 433,000 tonnes and has got 600,000 outlets across India. * *In International markets over 30 Countries and a number two brand in the UAE and Oman.\n\n3. BRIEF ABOUT UTC *Production trail started on 1st April 2005 in Rudrapur. *Total plotted area of approximately 20 acres. *the purpose of production of biscuits as this area is free from all types of taxes. *New concept like 5S *SEIRI: Organization, *SEITON: Neatness, *SEISO: Cleanliness, *SEIKETSO: Standardization, *SHITSUKE: Discipline *The Company is perusing for ISO 14001 certificate and it is ISO 22000 certified. *This unit enjoys the excise and income tax benefit from Uttarakhand government.\n\n4.

INGREDIENTS WHEAT FLOUR WATER SUGAR FAT &OIL SALT FLAVOUR MILK & MILK PRODUCT LEAVNING AGENT EMULSIFIER COLOUR\n\n8. Wheat Flour *Principal ingredient in Bakery products. *Unique ability to form Gluten. *Gluten is made of Gliadin & Glutenin (Insoluble Proteins). *Soluble proteins present in wheat flour are Albumin & Globulin. *Gluten is elastic–like and forms matrix. *Gluten forms only on mixing with water. *Gliadin contributes to elasticity & Glutenin imparts strength (Resistance). *Both quantity & Quality of gluten are important in assessing the strength of flour.\n\n9. WATER *2nd major ingredient in Bakery products. *Hydration of proteins. *Acts as a dispersion medium for sugar & other chemicals. *The consistency of dough largely depends on water. *An excellent leavening agent. *Medium hard water is preferred for most of the Bakery products, as some of the mineral salts (like Calcium salts) have a strengthening effect on gluten and some (like Ammonium salts) serve as yeast foods.\n\n10. FATS & OILS * *Act as lubricants. *Tenderizing agent. *Provides texture/structure to the product. *Act as aerating agents. *Eating quality (Palatability). *Moisture-barrier in finished products. *\n\n11. SUGAR *Particle size of sugar greatly affects baking properties. *Gluten Development. *Leavening. *Creaming. *Gelatinization. *Caramelization. *\n\n13. MILK & MILK PRODUCTS *Flavor and taste contribution. *To enhance crust color and bloom. *To improve tenderness of the product. *To improve the texture without altering the symmetry and crumb color. *To reduce the greasy feeling in sandwich creams. *As an alternate to eggs (use of whey protein concentrates). *\n\n14. FLAVOURS *Taste enhancer *Dispersibilty in water or fat as per requirement *Expression/Stability at the product pH. *Compatibility to the product as the expression of flavor generally varies with the fat content in the product. *Masking any undesirable odour from the product. *Closeness to the natural product envisaged. *\n\n15. COLOURS *To provide identity to the food product. *To provide variety to the consumer. *To correct the natural variations in the color of the food. *To enhance the natural color but at levels lower than that usually attached to the given food. *To protect food products, flavors and vitamins that can be affected by exposure to light. *\n\n16. EMULSIFIERS *Starch complexing (anti-staling) *Protein complexing (Dough strengthening) *Viscosity modification *Foaming and aeration *Texture modification *Lubrication *Crystal modification *As Wetting agents & solubilisers. *Suspension & dispersion. *\n\n17. LEAVNING AGENT * *Rise the volume of dough *Baking powder contains baking soda and the right amount of acid to react with it. *Batters made with double acting baking powder rise twice; *once when dry and moist ingredients are mixed together, and again when the product is baked. * 1-S.B.C.(Sodium bicarbonate) 2-A.B.C.(Ammonium bicarbonate)\n\n18. Above 70 °C, it gradually decomposes into sodium carbonate, water and carbon dioxide. The conversion is fast at 250 °C 2NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 Leavening agents where in application low final moisture content is reached in baked products such as cookies and crackers. NH4HCO3 → NH3 + H2O + CO2 1-S.B.C.(Sodium bicarbonate) 2-A.B.C.(Ammonium bicarbonate)\n\n19. 1) Wheat flour 2) Palm oil: • % Moisture: 14 (max.) • % Total ash: 0.8 (max.) • % Acid insoluble ash: 0.05 (max.) • % Alcoholic acidity: 0.12 (max.) • % Gluten on dry basis: 7.5 (min.) • Germ oil acidity (as oleic): 15 (max.) • Granularity : 85 mesh sieve ( 99% should pass through ) • Sedimentation value : 17 to 30 • Taste and colour : should be characteristic • Extraneous matter : should be absent • Origin : should be of vegetable origin *% FFA -0.10 max.

Benefits of Continuous Mixing *Simplifies the mixing process *Disperses ingredients consistently *Simplifies dough feed equipment *Provides tight control over the mixing process *Is safer , more sanitary and can be operated with less labour and energy than batch mixing *Is easy to sanitize, maintain, clean and inspect due to the clamshell design *No dough contamination because the dough is never exposed to the environment *Is easy to operate due to the user friendly controls *Controls ingredient metering to the mixer so it’s precise and uninterrupted.\n\n37.

BAKING The zones are classified as: There are 7 independent zones in all three plants. These are a) Proofing zone: zone 1 & 2 (Structure is set here) b) Puffing zone: zone 3 & 4 (Product get oven spring) c) Baking zone: zone 5 & 6 (Moisture removal of product) d) Colouring zone: zone 6 & 7 (Millard & Caramlization)\n\n40. The Physical changes The Chemical changes • Large reduction in product density. • Development of an open porous or flaky structure. • Change of shape associated with shrinkage or spread and increase in thickness. • Reduction in moisture level, to between 1-4%. • Change in surface coloration (reflectance). • *1.
