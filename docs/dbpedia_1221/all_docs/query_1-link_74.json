        "text": "Indian bakery company Britannia Industries has acquired a 51% share of Kenyan company Kenafric in a deal worth $1.1m. The merged companies have also acquired Catalyst Britania Brands, the investment company which owns the Britania brand in Kenya.\n\nBritannia Industries is India’s largest bakery company. It was founded in Calcutta in 1892, initially manufacturing bakery and soya products. Today its products are available in nearly 5 million retail outlets across India and it sells nearly 1 million loaves of bread every day.\n\nKenafric Biscuits was established in Nairobi in 1987 and today manufactures confectionery, food seasonings, icing sugar and drinks as well as biscuits.\n\nThe two companies have bought Kenyan Britania Foods, which has previously had no relation to Britannia Industries. Britania Foods, previously Jambo Biscuits, was bought by East African private equity firm Catalyst Principal Partners in 2017 for $9.8m. In 2021, it was placed under administration after defaulting on loans of more than $10.6m and was put up for auction. Kenafric & Britannia’s bid beat seven other bidders for the company in August, paying an undisclosed amount thought to be between $6.5m and $8.2m.\n\nJambo Biscuits was founded in 1987. In 2017, when it was bought by Catalyst and renamed Britania Foods, it was one of the top three biscuit brands in Kenya dominating 80% of the market. Following the takeover, it was the subject of a court case over whether it had falsified its financial statements and inflated its buying price. It has been out of operation for two years but Kenafric and Britannia reportedly plan to reopen the company and relaunch the Britania brand, known throughout Kenya for more than thirty years. The plant was reopened yesterday after Kenafric spent two months renovating the factory and restoring the machine to full operating capacity. A third of the workers who were there before it closed in 2020 have been reinstated and Kenafric say it will employ over 400 new workers in the next two years. The plant can manufacture 1,200 tonnes of biscuits every month, a six-times increase on the 200 tonnes being produced in 2020, with the first produce reaching the market by the end of next week."
