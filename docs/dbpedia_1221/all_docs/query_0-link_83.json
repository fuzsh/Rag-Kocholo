        "text": "Here is the marketing strategy of Britannia which analyzes the brand with the marketing mix framework which covers the 4Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).\n\nBritannia Product Strategy:\n\nThe product strategy and mix in Britannia marketing strategy can be explained as follows:\n\nBritannia manufactures wide variety of biscuits and dairy products. Britannia’s product strategy in its marketing mix width primarily consists of biscuits, bread, dairy, cakes and rusk. The product line depth is highest for biscuits consisting of several products, followed by cakes and breads. Britannia manufactures biscuits for various segments of consumers, types include sugar free biscuits, cream biscuits and jam biscuits. Some of its popular brands are Britannia Nutrichoice, Britannia Marie Gold, Britannia Pure Magic, Britannia Little Hearts etc. Britannia Tiger biscuits is the most famous of all products. Tiger biscuits also cater to the international markets like Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia. With their joint ventures with dairy companies, Britannia are now able to manufacture and sell cheese, dahi, ghee and butter. Its products are primarily intended for middle class people India, which forms the bulk of the population.\n\nImage: company website\n\nBritannia Price/Pricing Strategy:\n\nBelow is the pricing strategy in Britannia marketing mix strategy:\n\nBritannia is one of the leading food brands in India. The food manufacturing industry is very competitive.\n\nThe base of Britannia’s marketing mix pricing strategy is competition. Also the primary segment for being middle class people, who are highly price sensitive, forces Britannia to play price war with its competitors. Britannia tries to bundle its products, which in turn reduces the price of their products, specially this can be seen in their products which are designed for the family packs. Their strategy of discrimination of prices help them earn larger profits from consumers who are willing to pay for healthier products and greater benefits. The price of Britannia products is very much comparable with its competitors, especially with that of Parle products, and they are almost the same.\n\nBritannia Place & Distribution Strategy:\n\nFollowing is the distribution strategy in the Britannia marketing mix:\n\nBritannia distributes its products primarily via retail chain. The online segment, which contributes to less purchases, has been possible by having tie ups with large ecommerce organizations. Britannia products can be purchased from online portals. With extensive and strong distribution network Britannia products, can be found in all large and small urban areas across India. But the rural distribution network is not as good as that of the urban market. As a large FMCG player in India, Britannia primarily depends on distributors who then decide on dealers and retailers for distribution.\n\nBritannia has made deals with large retailers like spencers, big bazaar which hosts large quantity of Britannia products and provides better display location.\n\nBritannia Promotion & Advertising Strategy:\n\nThe promotional and advertising strategy in the Britannia marketing mix is as follows:\n\nSince the brand, Britannia is present for more than 100 years, perception about Britannia is always good and enjoys high brand recall among consumers, this tends to be a great advantage for Britannia. Advertisements for Television, print media and billboards are few of the many techniques used by Britannia in their promotional marketing mix. Britannia has signed agreements with famous personalities to promote their brand, but this has been different for different products. A bigger part of their promotional activities is done in the sports sector. Britannia logo tagged cricket bats endorsed by international players plays an important promotional activity. Britannia also promotes their product as “essential for good health”, this captures the mind of consumers as nowadays people tend to be more conscious about the nutrient value of what they consume. Hence, this concludes the Britannia marketing mix.\n\nAbout Britannia:\n\nBritannia Industries Limited is a food manufacturing company in India, headquartered at Kolkata.
