        "text": "A new product introduced in the market goes through a sequence of multiple stages. This cycle maps all the stages of a product’s life span that are related to promotion and sales. The product life cycle traditionally follows 4 stages which range from introduction of the product to its demise. As a product moves through these stages, its pricing, promotion, packaging, and distribution are re-evaluated and changed, if required, to prolong its life.\n\nPhase 1- Introduction:\n\nIn introduction phase, a new product is released in the market after obtaining intellectual property rights like patents and trademarks, if required. The branding strategy and pricing model is decided before rolling out the product and awareness is built in the target market subsequently. As the product is new to the market, chances of not having a market are more or even if there is a market, it might be too small and so there is a need to build a base for the product at the introduction stage, rather than making an immediate profit. The characteristics of this phase are low sales, negative or low profits and selective distribution.\n\nBritannia recently (feb 2015) launched choco chunkies under its good day cookie biscuit range, heralding a completely new category of cookies in the country-chunkies. This latest offering is a super premium chocolate product made using state of the art technology, is in its introductory phase. This product is the most expensive in Britannia’s biscuit product line and costs rs 50 for a pack of six biscuits.\n\nAli harris the director of marketing for Britannia says, “with good day chunkies, we bring international standards of an indulgent cookie experience to Indian consumers. We have designed a comprehensive marketing campaign to support this launch, and are confident that it is going to be a success with the new age consumers.” As this product is priced at a premium, it will initially only attract the 2.5% innovators who are willing to try something new regardless of the price.\n\nFor its distribution, the company chose an unconventional medium of e-commerce, first of its kind in fmcg industry. The biscuit company tied up with amazon India for this exclusive launch. Heavy budget advertising campaigns including paid banner ads on amazon as well as tvc starring deepika padrone indicate the amount of investment that goes into introducing a new product.\n\nPhase 2 – Growth\n\nThis stage is marked by a rapid increase in sales and is the key stage for establishing a product’s position in a market, increasing sales, and improving profit margin. To achieve this the marketing and promotional activities are taken up to increase consumer demand and reduce manufacturing costs. The characteristics of this phase are rapidly rising sales, increasing profits and a growing number of competitors. Intensive distribution methods are brought into practice to maximise market share. In this stage a category is established by entrance of competitors.\n\nBritannia launched nutri-choice biscuits in 1998 and re-launched it in 2006 which created a new category of healthy biscuits and currently has captured around 60% of market share in this category. This trend was followed by itc which launched ‘farmlite’ range of biscuits and much later by Parle which entered the war-zone around 2014 with its ‘simply good’ range of healthy biscuits.\n\nPhase 3- Maturity:\n\nSaturation of market is the key indication of a product being in maturity stage of its life cycle. This indicates that most of the consumers use the product and further sales depends upon population growth. All the distribution pipelines get exhausted making price competition intense. The characteristics of this phase are peak sales, high profits and prices are set to match or beat competitors.\n\nBritannia tiger glucose biscuit launched in 1997 as a competitor to Parle g glucose biscuits. While both the biscuits are available all over India, Parle g dominates tiger with a share of 70% as compared to 17% of tiger biscuit in glucose segment. The prices are very competitive tiger 125 gm is available at rs 10 whereas in the same price one gets 133 gm of Parle g glucose biscuits. Hence, the product has reached its maturity phase.\n\nPhase 4- decline:\n\nAt this stage the market for a product declines and this stage marks the beginning of the end of a product. This happens because of a number of reasons including change in consumer taste, increased competition and so on. The typical characteristics of this stage are declining sales, declining profits and phasing out of unprofitable channels."
