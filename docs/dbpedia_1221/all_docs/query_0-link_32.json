        "text": "India’s Britannia Industries Limited has received the green light to produce its biscuits and bakery products in Nepal.\n\nThe renowned food company with a history of 123 years received permission to invest Rs 1.11bn (approx. USD17.25m) to establish a biscuit and bakery production plant in Simara, Bara district, according to the Department of Industry (DoI).\n\nBritannia biscuit brands like Good Day, Bourbon, Digestive, 50-50 and Tiger are popular in the Nepali market.\n\nKhagendra Basnet, chief of the foreign investment section at DoI, announced that this is a consistent investment commitment in the manufacturing sector, aside from that made in cement factories. “This investment in the production of consumer goods is probably the largest in the recent years,” he added.\n\nAccording to the proposal submitted to DoI, Britannia will produce 14,000 tons of biscuits and bakery items every year and employ around 345 people.\n\nAccording to Reuters, products of the Indian company are exported across the world, including the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC) and countries in Africa and the Americas.\n\nAccording to the company’s website, Britannia has over Rs 85bn in revenue, delivering products in over five categories through 4.2 million retail outlets to more than half the Indian population. The company started its production from Kolkata 123 years ago."
