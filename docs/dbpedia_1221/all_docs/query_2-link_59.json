Nestle India has a big share of the market for branded yogurt.\n\nBritannia reported a 19 per cent rise in net profit in the fiscal first quarter to end-June 2007 to 361 million rupees (EUR6.5m) from a year earlier, and said pressure from high prices of raw materials like milk and wheat would persist this year.\n\nRelated content"
