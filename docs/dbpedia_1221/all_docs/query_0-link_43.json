Having a higher representation of women has benefited the plant operations by increasing its efficiency. It has also helped reducing attrition, while inculcating a sense of belonging amongst employees. Through our diversity initiatives, our endeavour has been to challenge stereotyped gender roles, while extending a welcoming and safe work environment and fostering a sense of belonging to the individuals’ workplace.”\n\nDiversity is an important pillar of Britannia’s sustainability framework to become a responsible global total foods company. Britannia reviews the progress of its diversity programme every month and measures progress against targets across metrics such as recruitment, engagement, promotion and attrition. The Madurai plant has emerged as a model factory for the company. The plant undertakes several initiatives to build an inclusive workplace including:\n\nRegular sensitization of employees via Gender intelligence programs, Policy guidelines and Annual POSH training\n\nCCTV cameras that cover the entire premises\n\nSecurity personnel (men and women) to ensure the safety of women\n\nPickup and drop facility for shifts after sunset, along with well-lit premises\n\n***\n\nBritannia Industries\n\nWith over a 100-year legacy and a turnover of over INR 13,000 crore, Britannia Industries is India’s largest Bakery Foods Company and produces India’s favourite brands like Good Day, Tiger, NutriChoice, Milk Bikis, Marie Gold, Little Hearts, and others and is present in over half of Indian households.
