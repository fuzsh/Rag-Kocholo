        "text": "With a 100-year legacy, Britannia Industries is among the leading and most trusted food companies in the country, manufacturing India’s favourite brands such as Good Day and NutriChoice.\n\nMaintaining the quality of produce and consumer trust is paramount. With a great history of supplying hygienic flooring solutions for the food and beverage industry, the client chose Flowcrete India to recommend a solution for its biscuit manufacturing unit.\n\nFor the processing area, 18,660 m2 of Flowfresh MF was chosen. With properties including abrasion, chemical and heat resistance up to 90°c, this system was ideal for the processing area where footfall, point loading and the moving of heavy apparatus would be expected. The butter used during the manufacturing process also posed a particular hygiene and safety concern and so the floor would have to withstand regular cleaning to wash this substance away.\n\nFlowfresh MF incorporates Polygiene®, a performance based antibacterial additive, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. Teamed with regular cleaning and coving, abolishing joints between the wall and floor where bacteria can multiply, the client could rest assured that the facility would maintain high sanitation standards.\n\nSpecifying a 4mm thickness increased the durability of this system and ensured that the floor could withstand abrasions likely to be endured in a processing facility. Aside from strong chemical cleaners, the likelihood of dropped produce on a regular basis can harm lesser floor coatings that aren’t resistant to exposure to sugars or acids.\n\nThe installation took 67 days to complete, landing within the stipulated time set by the client, and the plant was back on track making India’s favourite household treats."
