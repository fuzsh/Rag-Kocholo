Indian biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd. is setting up a manufacturing facility dedicated to servicing global markets, The Economic Times (India) reported May 16, citing Britannia Vice President for Supply Chain Vinay Singh.

The move is aimed at consolidating the company's global sourcing operations to trim costs and benefit from an improved tax environment in the country, the news agency said.

"After GST issues have settled down, we are leveraging backend synergies with the consolidation," Singh told ET.

According to the report, the new plant in Gujarat will cost the company 1.55 billion rupees, and will produce cookies, biscuits and rusk, among other products.

The facility is an addition to Brittania's 75 manufacturing centers, including 35 contract manufacturing units, ET reported.
