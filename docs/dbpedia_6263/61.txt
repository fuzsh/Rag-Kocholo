The Grand Prix de Nations in 1924 was a passively scored event with the scores from the individual jumping event used to determine the team scores. Four riders were permitted for each nation, with the best three scores to count towards the team total. Eleven teams competed with eight teams having three riders finish the course. The course was 1,060 metres long, with obstacles up to 1.40 m in height, all to be completed in a time limit at a speed of 400 m/min. Sweden won the gold medal, as it had in 1912 and 1920, with Switzerland second. The bronze medal went to Portugal, the only other team to finish, which was the first Olympic medal ever won by the Iberian nation.
