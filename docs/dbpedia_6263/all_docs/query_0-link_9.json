        "text": "History\n\nEquestrian sport has a fascinating history at the Olympic Games. In the early days in 1900, the Games were held in the magnificent capital of France and equestrian sport was part of the Olympic competition for the first time. At that time, however, the focus was on other disciplines, namely polo and jumping competitions.\n\nIt was twelve years before equestrian sport found a permanent place in the Olympic Games. Since 1912, i.e. for over 110 years, the disciplines of dressage, show jumping and eventing have been firmly anchored in the program. A significant change occurred in Amsterdam in 1928, when both individual and team medals were awarded in all three disciplines. The upcoming (after Paris 2024) Los Angeles 2028 will therefore mark an anniversary of 100 years of equestrian sport at the Olympic Games.\n\nEquality in equestrian sport\n\nA remarkable feature of equestrian sport as an Olympic discipline is that men and women participate equally and compete for the same medals. However, this was not the case from the very beginning. In the early years, it was reserved exclusively for men who were officers or \"gentlemen\" to compete against the best riders in the world. It was not until 1952 that women were allowed to compete in dressage, followed by admission in show jumping in 1956 and finally in eventing in 1964. Although there were separate medal awards in other sports, the next Olympic Games will strive for equality. For the first time, an absolute balance between male and female athletes was to be established.\n\nEquestrian sport at the Olympic Games has undergone an exciting development and remains a unique discipline that fascinates athletes from all over the world.\n\nThe Olympic disciplines in equestrian sport\n\nThe equestrian discipline has a long and rich tradition in the history of the Olympic Games. There are a total of six competitions at the Olympic Games in equestrian sports - one individual and one team competition in each discipline. The disciplines represented at the Olympic Games include show jumping, dressage and eventing. Women were first given the opportunity to compete in dressage in 1952, but later women's competitions were also introduced in show jumping and eventing. Equestrian sport is therefore one of the few sports that is open to both men and women.\n\nShow Jumping\n\nUntil the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico, a show jumping team consisted of three riders, all of whom had to reach the finish line. As a result, there were no medal winners in the team at the 1932 Games in Los Angeles, as no team reached the finish line in full. From the 1972 Games in Munich to those in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, a team consisted of four riders. For the 2020 Games, there was a return to teams with three riders under the motto \"more flags\" (more participating nations).\n\nThere were no team competitions at the Games in Paris in 1900, only individual events and competitions in the high jump and long jump.\n\nAlthough the World Equestrian Federation FEI decided as late as 1952 that women should not be admitted to the competitions (and the US federation had to disinvite Carol Durand, who had qualified), women were given the opportunity to take part in the Olympic Games in show jumping for the first time in 1956.\n\nDressage\n\nUp to and including the 1948 Summer Games, only officers were allowed to take part in the Olympic equestrian competitions. As a result, the Swedish team had to return the gold medal they had won at the 1948 Games in London in 1949, as it was discovered that the rider GehnÃ¤ll Persson was not an officer. From the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki onwards, this restriction no longer applied. In addition, women were allowed to take part in the dressage competitions for the first time in Olympic history. On this first occasion, Lis Hartel won the individual silver medal. Nowadays, women dominate this equestrian discipline.\n\nIn 1960, for the first time, no team competition was held. As there is the lowest probability of a rider or horse dropping out of a team competition in dressage, teams with three riders lasted the longest. For the first time in 1988, four riders per team were allowed to compete in the Grand Prix de Dressage, with the worst result being eliminated. This mode remained in place until Athens 2004. The four-rider-per-nation mode was used once again in 2016, but three-rider teams are planned again for the 2020 Games.\n\nEventing\n\nEventing, also known as Military, is one of the most demanding disciplines in Olympic equestrian sport. It is a three-day event that requires not only the riders' skills in dressage, cross-country and show jumping, but also excellent cooperation between rider and horse.\n\nIn the history of the Olympic Games, eventing has been constantly developed and adapted. In Antwerp in 1920, for example, dressage was replaced by an additional cross-country ride to make the competition more varied. These changes reflected the constant search for a balanced and challenging competition formula.\n\nThe cross-country ride in particular was repeatedly the subject of heated debate. The length and difficulty of the course as well as the demands placed on the horses led to debates about animal welfare aspects and the fairness of the competition. For this reason, rules have been changed several times in the past to ensure the safety and welfare of the horses.\n\nAnother issue that has shaped the history of eventing is the participation of women. For a long time, women were not allowed to take part in Olympic competitions. It was not until 1964 that this restriction was lifted, and since then women have taken a prominent place in eventing. Today, women dominate the discipline and their achievements have contributed significantly to the development and popularity of eventing.\n\nA particular challenge for eventing riders is the complex structure of the competition. Eventing consists of several partial tests, which makes the competition not only physically but also tactically demanding. The introduction of separate eventing tests and the integration of team performances into the individual classification are examples of the efforts to make the competition fairer and more exciting.\n\nTeam composition in eventing has also undergone changes over the years. From larger teams of up to five riders per nation in the 2000s to a return to smaller three-rider teams in 2020, these changes reflect the search for the optimal balance between competitive intensity and equality of opportunity.\n\nPara-Dressage\n\nIn contrast to the Olympic Games, where three different equestrian disciplines are held, the Paralympics focus exclusively on dressage. The unique bond between riders and their horses is particularly evident in para-dressage. In the competitions, the precision and quality of the ride, the behavior of the horses in the various gaits, their discipline during the rest phases and their artistic expression are assessed.\n\nOriginally, para-dressage was created for therapeutic reasons, whereby interaction with horses helped patients and was also used as a leisure activity. The first competitions took place in the 1970s, but it was not until the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta that para-dressage was included in the Paralympic program. A special feature is that riders of all classes can take part in the competitions together.\n\nThe program of the para-dressage competition includes the championship task, the team task with music (compulsory program with predetermined lessons and lines) and the individual freestyle (self-selected lines to any music). The individual freestyle is open to the best eight riders in each class, based on the results of the individual task.\n\nDepending on their needs, riders can use special equipment such as modified saddles, straps and spurs.\n\nPermitted limitations include orthopedic impairments, paraplegia, quadriplegia, hemiplegia, cerebral palsy, degenerative neurological diseases, neurological disabilities and visual impairments.\n\nThe classification is as follows:\n\nGrade I: Riders have severe impairments affecting all limbs and the trunk.\n\nGrade II: Riders have either a severe impairment of the trunk and an impairment of the arms or a moderate impairment of the trunk, arms and legs.\n\nGrade III: Riders have severe impairment in both legs with minimal or no impairment of the trunk or moderate impairment of the arms, legs and trunk.\n\nGrade IV: Riders have a severe impairment or the absence of both arms or a moderate impairment of all four limbs or are of short stature.\n\nGrade V: Riders have a visual impairment or complete blindness or a slight impairment of range of motion or muscle strength or a deficiency of one limb or a slight deficiency of two limbs.\n\nHow can you take part in the Olympic Games in horse riding?\n\nThe selection of which riders can take part in the Olympic Games varies from country to country and can also differ from Olympic Games to Olympic Games. Below we explain what the qualification path for Paris 2024 looks like:\n\nQualification path for the Olympic Games in show jumping\n\nIn general, the FEI defines the following path to qualify for a starting authorization at the Olympic Games:\n\nQuota places for show jumping: Quota places are allocated by the Standards Commission, with a total of 75 places available. Of these, 72 will be allocated by the Standards Commission and 3 by the host. Each participating nation has the opportunity to nominate a maximum of 3 athletes for show jumping.\n\nAthlete eligibility: Athletes must comply with the provisions of the Olympic Charter, in particular Rule 41 (Nationality of Participants) and Rule 43 (World Anti-Doping Code and the Olympic Movement Code for the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competitions).\n\nAge requirements: Participating athletes must have been born by December 31, 2006 at the latest and must therefore not be younger than 18 years of age. Horses participating in the Olympic Games must have been born by December 31, 2015 and may not be younger than nine years of age.\n\nAdditional FEI criteria: To be eligible for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, athletes and horses must meet certain minimum eligibility requirements (MER). These requirements can be achieved by participating in selected events such as Continental Championships, FEI World Cupâ¢ Jumping competitions and Grand Prix competitions.\n\nNations Cup Competitions: To meet the minimum requirements, athletes/horse combinations must complete the first or second round of three Nations Cup competitions. These competitions should have a height of 1.55 m at CSIO4* to 5*(-W) outdoor events, with a maximum of four (4) penalty points allowed.\n\nTechnical Specifications: The selected Nations Cup, Grand Prix and FEI Jumping World Cupâ¢ competitions must comply with the technical specifications set out in Article 632.5 of the FEI Rules for Equestrian Events at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nIndividual quota places: There are several ways to qualify, including participation in the above events and meeting certain minimum requirements. Only nations that have not received a team quota place are eligible to receive individual quota places\n\nIn Germany, the qualification path for German show jumpers is described by the German Olympic Committee for Equestrian Sports as follows:\n\nPerformance perspective:\n\nCompetition performances, state of health and fitness, form curve and load of the rider-horse combinations are assessed.\n\nNomination criteria:\n\nâThenomination will be made by the DOSB Executive Board between the beginning of May and the beginning of July 2024.\n\nCompetition performances and results:\n\nâTheperformances of the rider-horse combinations during the 2024 show season at CSI/CSIO 4*/5* are decisive.\n\nParticipation in selected international show jumping competitions:\n\nâRidersmust take part in certain international show jumping competitions to demonstrate their skills.\n\nParticipation in the German Championships in Balve:\n\nParticipation in the German Championships in Balve is taken into account in the assessment of performance prospects.\n\nState of health and fitness:\n\nâThestate of health and fitness of the rider-horse combinations is closely monitored.\n\nForm curve of the rider-horse combinations:\n\nâTheform curve of the rider-horse combinations is assessed to ensure that they are in a good state of performance.\n\nAdditional FEI criteria:\n\nâAthletesand horses must meet certain minimum eligibility requirements (MER) in order to be admitted to the Olympic Games.\n\nAthlete eligibility and age requirements:\n\nâAthletesmust respect and comply with the provisions of the Olympic Charter and the FEI, in addition to age requirements for athletes and horses.\n\nThe qualification path to the Olympic Games for dressage ridersÂ\n\nThe selection process for the German dressage riders for participation in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games consists of the following steps:\n\nEvaluation of competition performances and results during the 2024 show season at CDI/CDIO 3/4/5***.\n\nParticipation in two important competitions:some text\n\nGerman Championships in Balve from June 06 to 09, 2024(Grand Prix, Grand Prix Special, Grand Prix Freestyle).\n\nCHIO in Aachen from July 02 to 07, 2024(Grand Prix, Grand Prix Special, Grand Prix Freestyle).\n\nConsideration of the current state of health and fitness of the rider/horse combination at the time of the nomination proposal.\n\nEvaluation of the form curve of the rider/horse combination at the time of the nomination proposal.\n\nConsideration of multiple loading of the same rider/horse combination.\n\nIt should be noted that the Top Dressage Working Group has the option of granting dispensation to outstanding rider/horse combinations for the German Championships in Balve and nominating them for the CHIO in Aachen instead in order to manage the load.\n\nThe final nomination proposal will be submitted to the DOSB Executive Board by July 7, 2024. This proposal will be drawn up in the DOKR committee meeting (working group for top dressage sport) after the CHIO in Aachen.\n\nFurthermore, the World Equestrian Federation (FEI) sets these qualification criteria so that the respective countries are eligible to start:\n\nTeam qualification: The teams are determined through various qualification events, whereby each participating National Olympic Committee (NOC) can provide a team of a maximum of three athletes. Qualification is based on the results at the FEI World Dressage Championships, the FEI European Championships and other FEI Designated Olympic Qualification Events.\n\nIndividual qualification: Athletes can receive individual quota places if their NOC has not accepted a team place. Qualification takes place via the FEI Olympic Ranking - Dressage and via specific events in different geographical groups. Each NOC can receive a maximum of one individual quota place.\n\nReallocation of unused quota places: If a NOC does not accept or rejects an allocated quota place, this place will be reallocated according to the established procedures. This can be done by reallocation to the NOC of the next highest ranked athlete in the FEI Olympic Ranking - Dressage.\n\nConfirmation process for quota places: NOCs must confirm their acceptance or rejection of quota places within certain deadlines. Acceptance is made by submitting the FEI Certificate of Eligibility for the athlete and horse.\n\nQualification schedule: The qualification events will take place between 2022 and 2023, with the final confirmation of quota places by 2024.\n\nReallocation of unused host country places: If the host country does not field a team or chooses to send a single athlete instead, the unused athlete slots will be reallocated to the NOCs of the highest ranked athletes who have not yet qualified.\n\nThese criteria ensure that the best athletes and teams from different regions have the opportunity to take part in the Olympic Games in dressage.\n\nThe qualification path for the eventing riders\n\nThe qualification path for eventing riders is based on the international qualification criteria:\n\nThe qualification pathway for eventing teams provides for a total of 16 nations to receive a team qualification place. One place will be awarded as a host nation place, 14 team quota places will be awarded via FEI-designated Olympic qualifying events and one place will be awarded via the FEI Eventing Nations Cupâ¢ 2023.\n\nEach team consists of three rider-horse combinations. The quota places are distributed as follows:\n\nHost country (FRA)\n\nThe seven highest placed teams at the FEI Eventing World Championships 2022, excluding the host country team (GER, USA, NZL, GBR, IRL, SWE, SUI)\n\nThe two highest placed teams at the FEI European Championships 2023 in the FEI Olympic Groups A and/or B (BEL, NED)\n\nThe highest-placed team in a Group C qualifying event (POL)\n\nThe two highest-placed teams in FEI Olympic Groups D and/or E at the 2023 Pan American Games (CAN, BRA)\n\nThe two highest placed teams in FEI Olympic Groups F and/or G at a qualifying event in 2023 (AUS, JPN)\n\nThe highest placed team in the FEI Eventing Nations Cup Series 2023 (ITA)\n\nIn addition, there are reserve nations (ESP, CHN, FIN) that can step in if a qualified nation does not take part.\n\nFor individual qualification, only nations that have not accepted a team quota place will receive individual quota places. Each athlete can receive a maximum of one individual quota place for their country. A nation may receive a maximum of two individual quota places for eventing competitions.\n\nIndividual quota places will be allocated on the basis of the FEI Eventing Olympic Ranking, taking into account the best athletes from different geographical groups. If places remain unused, they will be reallocated in accordance with the reallocation procedures.\n\nSpecific reallocation procedures apply to unused host country places and individual quota places to ensure that all available places are used optimally.\n\nFor the German eventing riders, things look as follows for this Olympic season:\n\nIn accordance with the international criteria, all quota places for the German eventing team in 2022 have already been obtained.\n\nSpecific principles apply to the nomination for the German eventing team for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, which were adopted by the DOSB Executive Board in May 2022. The selection of rider/horse combinations is based on various criteria:\n\nCompetition performances and results during the 2024 show season at CCI4*/CCI5* events.\n\nCurrent state of health and fitness of the rider/horse combination at the time of nomination.\n\nForm curve of the rider/horse combination at the time of nomination.\n\nMultiple loading of the same rider/horse combination.\n\nThe nomination proposals are drawn up by the working group for top-level eventing , which is made up of various members, including the chairman, the head trainer, the team veterinarian and a representative of the DOKR office. This working group also coordinates the individual participation in selected international CCI4*/CCI5* tournaments and national championships.\n\nThe final decision on the nomination for the German eventing team is made by the DOSB board, based on the nomination proposals submitted.\n\nOutstanding performances in Olympic equestrian sport\n\nRiding master Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler\n\nHans GÃ¼nter Winkler is one of the legendary riders in Olympic history.
