        "text": "NANTERRE, France — Katie Ledecky, the greatest female swimmer in history, won Olympic gold Wednesday night in one of the two races she has dominated for more than a decade, the 1,500-meter freestyle.\n\nLedecky took command of the race early and never was threatened, winning in an Olympic record 15:30.02. It is her first gold medal of these Games to go along with a bronze she won Saturday in the 400 freestyle.\n\nShe now has won 12 medals in four Olympic Games, tying her for the most Olympic swimming medals won by a woman with Americans Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin and Australian Emma McKeon, who also is competing here. Ledecky has two more events at the Paris Olympics, the 4x200 freestyle relay and the 800 freestyle.\n\nLedecky, 27, is undefeated in the 1,500 in her professional career, having won five world titles and the first-ever Olympic gold medal in the event at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She of course also holds the world record in the 1,500, which she has set six different times, and now has recorded the 20 fastest times in the race.\n\nThe last time Ledecky was beaten in the 1,500, she was a high school student swimming in a regional meet near her home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., 14 years ago.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts!
