        "text": "Reinhold Messner arrived at Rongbuk during the monsoon in July 1980. He spent a month acclimatizing, did one reconnaissance to the North Col to cache supplies there, then set off alone from Advance Base on the East Rongbuk Glacier before dawn on August 18. After a lucky escape from a concealed crevasse into which he had fallen, he reached the North Col, collected his gear, and continued to climb higher up the North Ridge. He then slanted diagonally right, as George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce had done in 1922, traversing a full 1.2 miles (2 km) before stopping to pitch his tent a second time, at 26,900 feet (8,200 metres). On the third day he entered the Great Couloir, continued up it, and achieved what had eluded Edward Norton, Lawrence Wager, Percy Wyn-Harris, and Francis Smythe by climbing rightward out of the couloir, onto the final terraces, and to the summit. Messner later recounted,\n\nI was in continual agony; I have never in my whole life been so tired as on the summit of Everest that day. I just sat and sat there, oblivious to everything.…I knew I was physically at the end of my tether.\n\nBack at his tent that night he was too weak even to eat or drink, and the next morning he jettisoned all his survival equipment, committing himself to descending all the way to Advance Base Camp in a single day.\n\nFurther exploration from Tibet\n\nMessner’s 1980 solo climb demonstrated just what could be done on the world’s highest mountain. With that same bold spirit, a four-man British team came to Rongbuk in 1982 to attempt the complete Northeast Ridge from Raphu Pass (Raphu La). While he was leading the climb of the first of the three prominent Pinnacles that start at about 26,900 feet (8,200 metres), Dick Renshaw suffered a mild stroke and was invalided home. The expedition leader, Chris Bonington, felt too tired to go back up, and thus it was left to Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker to attempt the final ascent. They were last seen alive between the First Pinnacle and the Second Pinnacle on May 17. Boardman’s body was found 10 years later, sitting in the snow near that point; Tasker has not been found.\n\nIn 1981 a large American team made the first-ever attempt on Everest’s gigantic East Face from Kangshung Glacier. Avalanche risk thwarted the attempt, but the team returned in autumn of 1983 to attempt again the massive central buttress of the face. This produced some spectacularly hard climbing, led by George Lowe. Above the buttress, the route followed a broad spur of snow and ice to reach the Southeast Ridge just below the South Summit. Carlos Buhler, Lou Reichardt, and Kim Momb reached the Everest summit on October 8, followed the next day by Jay Cassell, Lowe, and Dan Reid.\n\nIn 1984 the first Australians to attempt Everest chose a new route up the North Face, climbing through the huge central snowfield, dubbed “White Limbo,” to gain the Great Couloir. Then, like Messner in 1980, the Australians cut out right, with Tim Macartney-Snape and Greg Mortimer reaching the summit at sunset before making a difficult descent in the dark.\n\nThe most remarkable achievement of this era was the 1986 ascent by the Swiss climbers Jean Troillet and Erhard Loretan. Like Messner, they snatched a clear-weather window toward the end of the monsoon for a lightning dash up and down the mountain. Unlike Messner, they did not even carry a tent and sleeping bags. Climbing by night, resting during the comparative warmth of the day, they took just 41.5 hours to climb the Japanese and Hornbein couloirs up the North Face; then, sliding most of the way on their backsides, they descended in about 4.5 hours.\n\nDevelopments in Nepal\n\nWhile the most dazzling deeds were being done on the Tibetan side of Everest, there was still much activity in Nepal during the 1980s, with the boldest pioneering expeditions coming from eastern European countries. For dogged teamwork, nothing has surpassed the first winter ascent of Everest. Completed in 1980 by a team of phenomenally rugged Polish climbers, this ascent was led by Andrzej Zawada; expedition members Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki reached the summit on February 17. To crown this success, Zawada then led a spring expedition to make the first ascent of the South Pillar (left of the South Col), getting Andrzej Czok and Jerzy Kukuczka to the summit. Kukuczka, like Messner, would eventually climb all of the world’s 26,250-foot (8,000-metre) peaks, nearly all by difficult new routes.\n\nSeveral teams attempted to repeat the Yugoslav West Ridge direct route without success, until a Bulgarian team did so in 1984. The first Bulgarian to reach the summit, Christo Prodanov, climbed without supplemental oxygen, was forced to bivouac overnight during the descent, and died—one of four summiteers who climbed without oxygen in the 1980s and failed to return.\n\nThe first Soviet expedition to Everest, in 1982, climbed a new route up the left-hand buttress of the Southwest Face, involving harder climbing than the original 1975 route. Led by Evgeny Tamm, the expedition was highly successful, putting 11 Soviet climbers on the summit.\n\nThe end of an era\n\nThe last of the great pioneering climbs of the decade was via a new route up the left side of the East Face to the South Col. Led by American Robert Anderson, it included just four climbers who had no Sherpa support and used no supplemental oxygen. British climber Stephen Venables was the only member of this expedition to reach the summit, on May 12, 1988. After a harrowing descent, during which Venables was forced to bivouac overnight without a tent, all four members of the team made it back to the Base Camp.\n\nDuring the same period, more than 250 members of the “Asian Friendship Expedition” from China, Nepal, and Japan staged a simultaneous traverse of the mountain from north and south, which was recorded live on television. Also in 1988 the Sherpas Sungdare and Ang Rita both made their fifth summit of the mountain. That autumn the ace French climber, Marc Boivin, made the first paragliding descent from the summit; New Zealander Russell Brice and Briton Harry Taylor climbed the infamous Pinnacles on the Northeast Ridge; and four Czech climbers disappeared in a storm after making an Alpine-style climb of the Southwest Face without supplemental oxygen. The following year five Poles were lost in an avalanche on the West Ridge.\n\nThe increasing activity on Everest in 1988 foreshadowed what was to come. At the start of the spring season that year, fewer than 200 individuals had summited Everest. However, by the 2003 season, a half century after the historic climb by Hillary and Tenzing, that number exceeded 1,200, and more than 200 climbers had summited Everest two or more times. Both statistics grew dramatically in the succeeding decade, particularly the proportion of climbers with multiple ascents; by the end of the 2013 climbing season, the tally of successful ascents of the mountain was approaching 7,000, and some 2,750 had climbed it more than once.\n\nStephen Venables\n\nCommercialism and tragedy\n\nIn the 1950s and ’60s the expense of mounting an expedition to Everest was so great and the number of climbers familiar with the Himalayas so few that there were many years in which no team attempted the mountain. By the 1970s expeditions had become more common, but Nepal was still issuing only two or three permits per year. In the 1980s permits became available for both the pre- and post-monsoon seasons and for routes via China as well as Nepal, and the total number of expeditions increased to about 10 per year. During the 1990s it became normal for there to be at least 10 expeditions per season on each side of the mountain, and those numbers continued to increase after 2000.\n\nOne of the most successful operators, New Zealander Rob Hall, had led teams up the South Col route to the summit in 1990 and in 1992, ’93, and ’94. On May 10, 1996, his group and several other teams were caught at the summit in a bad afternoon storm. Hall and his American client, Doug Hansen, both died at the South Summit. An American guide from a separate commercial expedition, Scott Fischer, also died, along with several other climbers, including three Indians, on the Northeast Ridge. Although the deaths in the late 1980s had gone almost unnoticed, those from the 1996 storm were reported instantly over the Internet and generated massive press coverage and disaster literature. In all, 12 climbers died in that year’s pre-monsoon season, and an additional 3 died after the monsoon. The 1996 disaster may have caught the world’s attention, but it did nothing to decrease the lure of Everest.\n\nSurge in traffic and overcrowding\n\nIf anything, commercial traffic increased dramatically, despite the obvious message that no guide can guarantee a climber’s safety at such great heights. Indeed, after 2000 the number of climbers making it to the top of Everest continued to rise, reaching a peak of some 630 in 2007 and exceeding 800 in 2018.\n\nIt became increasingly common for several expeditions to be operating simultaneously on the mountain and for dozens of climbers to reach the summit on a single day. On May 23, 2001, nearly 90 accomplished the feat, and in succeeding years daily totals typically approached or exceeded that number during the peak of the May climbing season. An unprecedented 234 climbers made it to the top on May 19, 2012.\n\nSuch large throngs of climbers inevitably created traffic jams in some of the narrower passages. One of the more notorious of those instances was on May 19, 2012, when the record number of climbers became dangerously backed up at the Hillary Step. Four people died then, prompting expedition leaders to better coordinate their final ascent attempts with one another. Despite better efforts to coordinate thereafter, overcrowding still led to a deadly season in 2019, when long lines in mid-May prevented several climbers from ascending and descending quickly enough to replenish their oxygen supply. Eleven climbers perished, though that season saw a record number of ascents, with as many as 885 reaching the summit.\n\nAvalanches in 2014 and 2015\n\nOver the years, considerable improvements in climbing gear and equipment, technology (including mobile wireless availability on the mountain), and expedition planning have improved the safety of those climbing Everest. However, the region remains a highly dangerous place where tragedy can strike at any time. Two notable examples occurred almost exactly a year apart. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche struck a group of Sherpas who were carrying supplies through the Khumbu Icefall. A total of 16 died (13 confirmed; 3 missing and presumed killed), making it the deadliest single day in Everest climbing history to that date. On April 25, 2015, however, a massive earthquake in central Nepal triggered avalanches on Everest, one of which swept through Base Camp, killing or injuring dozens of climbers and workers there. The known death toll on the mountain was 19—which included one climber who died after being evacuated to a hospital—surpassing the total from the previous year. In addition, the route through the Khumbu Icefall was severely damaged, stranding dozens of climbers at Camps I and II above the icefall, who then had to be rescued by helicopter.\n\nThe 2014 disaster put an end to the Nepalese-side climbing season, after the Sherpas decided that they would not climb. One Chinese woman did reach the summit after being helicoptered to and from Camp II, and some 125 climbers made it to the top from the north (Chinese) side. Soon after the 2015 Nepalese-side avalanche, Chinese officials announced that the climbing season on the north side was canceled. For a time, there was some discussion of trying to repair the damaged route through the icefall, but it was deemed not possible, thus effectively ending climbing on the south side also for that year’s spring season. The icefall route was repaired during the summer, and the Nepalese government issued a climbing permit to a Japanese mountaineer. In September he made a solo summit attempt before turning back at an elevation of about 26,740 feet (8,150 metres). As a result, 2015 was the first year in more than four decades that not one person had reached the top of Everest."
