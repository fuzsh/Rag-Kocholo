        "text": "Mallory Franklin was unable to continue Great Britain’s canoe slalom medal streak at Paris 2024, as Jessica Fox made Australian history in the women's canoe single (C1) final at Vaires-Sur-Marne Nautical Stadium.\n\nReigning world champion Franklin finished 12th after receiving 56 penalty seconds for touching three gates and failing to clear the 20th.\n\nThe 30-year-old won silver in Tokyo three years ago and is the reigning world champion in the discipline.\n\nHowever, it was Fox who stole the spotlight, following up her kayak single (K1) gold on Sunday with another victory to become the first Australian athlete to win six individual Olympic medals.\n\nFox clocked 101.06 seconds - including two penalty seconds - to beat Germany's Elena Lilik to gold by 2.48, as American Evy Leibfarth took bronze.\n\nTeam GB had won medals in the first two canoe slalom finals at the Games, with Adam Burgess winning men’s C1 silver on Monday after Kimberley Woods had taken women's K1 bronze a day earlier.\n\nRio 2016 champion Joseph Clarke will contest the men's K1 semi-finals on Thursday, with the final taking place later that day.\n\nFranklin is Great Britain’s most successful female canoeist, winning a total of 16 world medals and making 18 European podiums in addition to her Olympic silver, but it was not to be on Wednesday and she will now look ahead to the kayak cross, which starts on Friday."
