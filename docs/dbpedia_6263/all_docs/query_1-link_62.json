        "text": "1.\n\nPamela’s India Remembered 09:24\n\nWords written and spoken by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: I am Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten, I am the only son of the late Lord Mountbatten Earl of Burma, he was also Admiral of the British Fleet. I have two half-sisters from my father's side, my half-sister Patricia Edwina Victoria Mountbatten, she was born on 14th February 1924; and my second half-sister Pamela Carmen Louise Mountbatten, she was born on 19th April 1929. This is my work I named Pamela's India Remembered. And it happened long before I was born that Pamela went with her mother Edwina and our father Louis Mountbatten to India in His Majesty King George VI's service. I, Deian Mountbatten, was born on 19th November 1965, my skin is white, my eyes are blue, I am 182.5 cm tall [barefoot 181 cm = ca. 6ft], my weight is [ca. 74 to] 79 kg.\n\n2.\n\nMother 03:01\n\n3.\n\nBettina's Smile 02:53\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nSnowflakes In April 04:44\n\nWords written, sung and whispered by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: Snowflakes in April come from where the wild winds blow. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Thank you for coming down, I am standing on this stony ground. You turn every colour into white, I open my hands to hold you tight [but you melt away like a dream unreal]. Snowflakes fall, my eyes open wide and tears swallowed between darkness and light. Snow turns every colour into white, massacre of Peking makes me cry. Snowflakes in April come from where the wild winds blow. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Snowflakes in April come from where the winds are cold. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. I hear the stories of the students sing, when [revolting students literally like] snowflakes sing what tomorrow may bring. You turn every colour into white. I open my arms to hold you tight!! Snowflakes in April come from where the wild winds blow. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Snowflakes in April come from where the winds are cold. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. I lost control by dreaming of the past [when in April 1984 this song of mine had a totally different meaning, but today], Peking massacre, massacre. Snowflakes in April come from where the wild winds blow. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Snowflakes in April come from where the winds are cold. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Snowflakes in April come from where the wild winds blow. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground. Snowflakes in April come from where the winds are cold. Snowflakes in April like hearts that tumble and crash to the ground.\n\n6.\n\nWords written whispered and spoken by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: [At the end of this instrumental I added a few seconds of the radio show from 18th February 1984 on Radio Sarajevo during the 1984 Winter Olympics when my song Lovesong was at number one in the Radio Sarajevo Independent Radio Charts.] Chiefs. [Then I clear my throat.] Over.\n\n7.\n\nSong On The Wind 06:35\n\nExcept for the female backing vocals sung and whispered by Daniela Sauter but also written by myself, all words written, spoken, sung and whispered by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: I can hear. I dream. I speak. I can hear. I can hear somebody screaming. I dream pictures of days gone by, pictures of hearts burning, pictures that will never die. I speak into the falling rain, falling rain. Tears in my sunken in eyes. Memories looking out for pain. Words in mysterious ways. These are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. The wind and the rain bring back words of a song. Impressions I can't explain. This song couldn't be wrong. Still I hear somebody screaming. Memories looking out for pain. Looking out for pain. My eyes catching things burning. I am running into - into the falling rain!! These are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. These are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. When your tumbling heart goes down to the ground, slide with your back down the wall, your dream must go on. These are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. These are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. These are the words of the song on the wind, I can hear, they are painting pictures of days gone by. I dream fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. the song on the wind. I sit and watch these lifeless forms, rain falls all over the land. The meaning of the new way portrays in the sand. Oh these are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Oh fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been. Still I hear somebody screaming, memories looking out for pain. Looking out for pain. My eyes catching things burning. Oh I am running into - into the falling rain. Oh these are the words of the song on the wind, they are painting pictures of days gone by. Oh fingers pointing to show a scene, no other forms that once have been.\n\n8.\n\nElizabeth's Empire II 06:41\n\nWords written and sung by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: Give us, give us this day, oh. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give me all the story has told me, the peace and the glory till my kingdom comes. And they say that in our time, all the truth will fall from grace. Even saints would turn their face in our time. And they told us that in our days different words said in different ways have all the meaning from him who says, in our time. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give me all the story has told me, the peace and the glory till my kingdom comes. And they say that in our time we would live from their legacy, we would learn from what they had seen in our time. And they told us that in our days we would know what was high on high, we would follow and not defy, in our time. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give me all the story has told me, the peace and the glory till my kingdom comes. Faithless in fate, we must behold the things we see. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the peace and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give me all the story has told me, the faith and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give us this day, all that you showed me, the power and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give me all the story has told me, the peace and the glory till my kingdom comes. Give us, give us, give us this day, oh.\n\n9.\n\nFather 05:59\n\n10.\n\nThe Romans Are Approaching 01:46\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\nWord written and said by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: Tron!!\n\n15.\n\nThe State Of Eternity 04:24\n\n16.\n\nWord written, sung and spoken by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: In Africa the people are dying, a little girl dies in her mother’s arms. Oh her mother cries for the dying daughter, but the little girl dies, no bread, no water. Oh her mother cries for the dying daughter, but the little girl dies, no bread, no water. In Africa the people are dying. The helpless in this world - you can hear them crying. All people here who can hear this song now, in Africa the peoples are dying. Oh all people here who can feel these words now, the helpless in this world - you can hear them crying. I see poor people of Africa, oh they cry and cry on this world. Starvation of Africa, ah-ah. Sieh den Stern, sieh den Stern wie er schwebt, so leicht, ja so unscheinbar leicht. Sieh den Stern, sieh den himmelblauen Stern wie er schwebt und erlischt. I see poor people of Africa, oh they cry and cry on this world. Starvation of Africa, ah-ah. People cry, people die. People cry, people die. People cry. Keyboards hört man nicht auf dem Monitor.\n\n17.\n\n[ The wrong leaders and role models who are fetish of their guns are the ones who are meant in this my instrumental musical work I composed on 9th May 1986, those fascists who have nothing else on their minds than shoot to kill when they see an animal like a deer, a wild boar or a pheasant, and they always do to humans what they are able to do to animals, always. Nationalistic destroyers as leaders and their henchmen, instead of creative protective peaceful pacifists like myself who could bring lasting peace to a tired world, and this one of my instrumental synthesizer works I composed without lyrics, and I named Demolishing The Evil Fascist Empire. It is passively without saying a word against bad ways of role modelling, as they always destructively and without any sensitivity make our human race as if devilishly evil, and so systematically destroy and demolish our beautiful home planet Earth, because of their neverending decadent behavior with which they are constantly adding the word bad to everything they do, and whatever they touch always turns into desaster, either in their own country or in some other country somewhere else. That's literally the red thread that goes through this whole album. The problem is, that they live their lives as destroyers and killers, hunters, chase-hunters, poachers, trappers, militant warriors in power, fetish of their weapons and fetish of posing in uniforms. But I cannot be the only one to whom God has not only placed musical creation and protection, but also real love and soul love, and even natural health care, and the tenderest, most sensitive male human soul in the cradle. For example I love my homeland Great Britain, without any feelings of nationalism and false fascist pride, but those who conspire against me do not want to allow me to love, but rather want me to dislike my fellow human beings, for my homeland Great Britain to turn her back on me unfairly and meanly. I am the most tender human soul in the world, I am a man like a treasure with a lake of gold, I am a soul wealth with a mountain of diamonds. ]\n\n18.\n\nRainy Day 04:46\n\nWords written, sung and spoken by myself, Deian Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas George Mountbatten: Woke up with the sound of a voice of a man [my stepfather and official father] who told me about life, about the world and other places, [about my late father] about laughing and smiling faces. Walking round in circles, I'm tired of hanging around, my eyes [literally] nailed to the window, the ritual to get off the ground. One day I am a hero, another day a clown? [Metaphorical speech and question, I don't like clowns.] Sometimes I miss the old man [my late father Lord Mountbatten Earl of Burma], miss the stories untold, I miss the understatement, but life must go on. Rainy day, I'm fading away inside my world of music. Memories, they are made of these moods and chords I'm using. Rainy day. Oh-oh, rainy day. Pictures out of nowhere. Rushing knocks on the door. Storms of rage and tears. Echoes pass through the years. I stepped up to the window, I touched my lucky coin, temptation in my eyes, life is a roll of the dice [I used to have a golden dice pendant on a golden chain, but it was stolen on one of my private parties in the 1990s in my 1rst former house Schwarzwaldstrasse 9 upstairs in the Penthouse, and the thief and her mates burned holes in my carpet], and if you come up with a winner you can try and roll them twice. [Metaphorical speech, I don't gamble, but life seems as if it were a gamble.] Sometimes I miss the old man, I miss the stories untold, I miss his understatement, but life must go on. Rainy day, I am fading away inside my world of music. Memories, they are made of these moods and chords I'm using. Rainy day. Fascinating fantasies, shivers down my spine, you said \"hush\" to me \"don't you cry\". Rainy day, I am fading away inside my world of music. Memories, they are made of these moods and chords I am using. Rainy day. Rainy day. Oh ... rainy day ... oh ... rainy day ...\n\n19.\n\nCircumstances Of Eternity 04:22\n\n20."
