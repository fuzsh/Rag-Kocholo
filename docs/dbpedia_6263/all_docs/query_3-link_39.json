        "text": "Thursday, March 14, 2019\n\nJames C. Foley Takes Office as 2019 TMS President\n\n“The State of our Society is strong, and we are poised to make it even stronger on a number of important fronts,” said Kevin J. Hemker, 2018 TMS President, at last night’s TMS-AIME Honors & Awards Ceremony. Hemker reviewed some of the accomplishments of the Society during his year as president, including the new TMS Aspires strategic plan.\n\nHe now passes leadership of the Society to James C. Foley of Los Alamos National Laboratory who will serve as 2019 TMS President. Foley also addressed the audience with a few words, saying that in the coming year, he plans to do the following: “Volunteer my time. Nominate people for awards and positions. Donate to the TMS Foundation. Promote TMS. And encourage others to do the same. I ask all of you now to take this simple plan and make it fit what you are planning to do for the year. Just think of what we can do as a community if every TMS member checked all of these boxes.”\n\nThomas Battle, Extractive Metallurgy consultant, moves into the role of 2019 TMS Vice President.\n\nMaterials Criticality Roundtable Today\n\nThe International Round Table on Materials Criticality (IRTC) begins at 9:00 a.m. in Room 007C of the convention center. The roundtable sessions, which run until 4:00 this afternoon, will gather input that will ultimately result in a roadmap on criticality, providing advice for authorities and policy makers worldwide. In the morning session, seven presenters will discuss the topic “How Industry Manages Criticality.” The afternoon session will include an introduction to the IRTC project and a roundtable discussion with 11 invited experts. All TMS2019 attendees are invited to participate.\n\nThe following posters by early-career professionals were honored for excellence in several TMS technical divisions, as part of the TMS Young Professional Poster Competition this week:\n\nLight Metals Division\n\n“Analysis and Interpretation about Evaluation and Atomic Vibration of New Raman Active Modes from CDW Phase in of Layered 2H-TaX2 (X=S, Se),” Sugata Chowdhury, National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\nMaterials Processing & Manufacturing Division\n\n“Fatigue Characterization and Microstructure-sensitive Modeling of Extruded and Friction Stir Welded Aluminum Lithium Alloy 2099,” Abby Cisko, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center\n\nStructural Materials Division\n\n“Flaw Tolerance of Shape Memory Yttria-stabilized Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystals,” Ning Zhang, Colorado School of Mines\n\nScenes from Wednesday at TMS2019\n\nA number of attendees started their day on Wednesday with breakfast and stimulating conversation at the Fresh Coffee, Fresh Ideas: Diversity and Inclusion Breakfast event, sponsored by the TMS Diversity Committee.\n\nSeveral honors were bestowed upon members of the Functional Materials Division (FMD) during Wednesday afternoon’s council meeting.

In honor of that milestone, plenary speaker Luana Iorio of GE Aviation looked to the future of materials for flight by taking attendees through some of the company’s most recent breakthrough technologies at the 2019 TMS All-Conference Plenary Session on Monday. She looked at how additive technologies, digital data, and integrated computational materials engineering can help to accelerate materials and process development and noted how these factors are changing the paradigm from looking at the number of years it takes to produce a new material to seeing the number of new materials that can be produced in a year.\n\nFollowing her presentation, 2018 TMS President Kevin Hemker, who hosted the event, presented Iorio with a commemorative coin to recognize her role as TMS2019 all-conference plenary speaker.\n\nTo learn more about the technologies discussed in the plenary talk, visit the GE display in the lobby of the convention center near the Registration Desk today.\n\nJoin Us for Frontiers of Materials Research: A Decadal Study Session\n\nThis afternoon, join us at 12:15 for the special one-hour session, Frontiers of Materials Research: A Decadal Study, in Room 221 D of the convention center.
