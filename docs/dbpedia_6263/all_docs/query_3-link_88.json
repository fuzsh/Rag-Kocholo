When she married Edgar Albrecht in 1925, they ran the home farm. Like other farm wives, Hilda canned, made butter and smoked meat. She recalls, the best bread I baked was in the outdoor oven. When the wood was burned, the oven was hot enough to bake bread. Hilda thought the telephone was the nicest invention because it helped farm people overcome their isolation. Today, she enjoys exercise classes and playing bingo. Hilda believes the hard work she did on the farm has helped her to remain healthy and active.

Death was due to infirmities of age and the announcement of her passing will bring keen sorrow to many who knew and loved her. Mrs. Allendorf was one of the pioneer residents of the county, settling here among the virgin pine and undergoing the hardships and incessant labor incident to the clearing and cultivation of a well kept farm which in later years was the family home north of Two Rivers. The deceased was born in Dorth, Saxony and came to this country in 1855. She is survived by two daughters, Mrs. A.J.

TAKEN WITH CRAMPS--BODY RECOVERED BY LIFE SAVERS Two Rivers contributed the eighth fatality of the season from drowning last night when Wallace Allie, aged 17, last (sic) his life in the river at a point about three-quarters of a mile from the Life Saving station. Though the body was recovered by Life Saving crew within ten minutes of the accident and five minutes after reaching the scene, efforts to revive the unfortunate lad were without avail. Young Allie with a number of companions was bathing in the river when he was taken with cramps and before his companions could aid him, he had gone down. The Life Saving station was notified and responded with the power boat, reaching the scene in incredible short time and recovering the body in less than five minutes after its arrival. Despite this fact, however, nothing could be done to save the body, the crew, with physicians, working over the body for more than one hour before the effort was abandoned. A peculiarly sad circumstance in connection with the drowning of the Allie boy is that he is the third of his family to meet death in the water within the past few years. Four years ago his father, the late Eugene Allie, met his death in the lake at Kewaunee, being washed overboard from his boat, and only a year ago a brother of the dead boy, lost his life, almost at the same spot where his father was drowned. Allie, Sr., was engaged in fishing and after his death the older son followed the father's work, both meeting death while engaged in fishing off Kewaunee. The victim of last night's tragedy was an orphan, his mother having died some years ago and several brothers and sisters are survivors. The body was taken in charge by relatives at Two Rivers. No inquest was held, the circumstances attending the accident being clearly established. Coroner Falge and Dist. Atty. Healy were notified last night of the accident. The drowning of the Allie lad is the eighth which has occurred in Manitowoc and Two Rivers this year, both cities having had four victims of fatalities of this nature. Five of the accidents have occurred within six weeks, three in this city and two at Two Rivers. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Saturday, July 19, 1913 P. 1\n\nALTHEN, SON OF F.

Mrs. Tosten Anderson. She was buried on Thursday and the long line of carriages that followed the remains to their last resting place proved the esteem in which the deceased was held by her many friends. Rev. A.O. Alfson delivered an appropriate and touching funeral sermon. Deceased was a devoted wife and loving parent, possessing the happy faculty of always looking at the bright side of things. When suffering from feebleness or pain, she would, for the sake of others, conceal it as much as possible. It is comforting to think she is now at rest; the day has dawned, the shadows have fled. We have not learned all the particulars of her illness and death, but are certain that the end was in harmony with her life. Death, to her, could have been no surprise. During those long months of lingering illness, her thoughts must have become familiar with the prospects of another world. A beautiful cross of natural flowers was placed on her coffin by her children, a tribute of their love and esteem and an emblem of that sweet rest into which we trust she has entered. Weep not, O friend, we should not weep Our friend of friends lies full of rest No sorrow rankles in her breast, Fallen fast asleep. She sleeps below, She wakes and laughs above; Today, as she walked, let us walk in love Tomorrow follow also.

The absence of any marks of violence on the body and the fact that the body has not been robbed leads to the belief that Bahr's death was an accident. Mr. Bahr had held an apointment as village night watchman for some years and was on duty last night when he met his death, the body was found near the C & NW Railway bridge which Mr. Bahr would cross on his way home and it is believed that he was enroute home when, in the darkness, he missed his footing and fell from the bridge. With no one about to render him aid, Mr. Bahr was unable to save himself and drowned. Mrs. Bahr reported the absence of her husband during the morning and a searching party which was organized, discovered the body at 11 o'clock. Mr. Bahr was 66 years of age and one of the best known men of the village. He had been twice married and is survived by the second wife and one son and by several children of his former marriage. Coroner Falge and District Attorney Healy at Manitowoc were notified and will come here, though it is doubtful that an inquest will be called.

Manitowoc County Chronicle - Nov. 3, 1896\n\nBARTEL, JOHN John Bartel, a farmer residing in the Town of Kiel, Manitowoc county, died a few days since from the effect of blood poisoning, caused by the a accidental inoculation of virus from a horse which had the epizootic. Bartel ran a splinter into the middle right hand finger and before the wound, which amounted to nothing more than a scratch had healed, administered a gargle to the animal suffering from the epizootic never dreaming of any danger. A few days later the wounded finger became badly inflamed and not withstanding every effort to check it, the inflammation rapidly spread through the arm, face and vital parts, causing his death after suffering excruciating tortures. He was attended by a resident physician named Martin and Dr. Breining of this city who pronounced it a clear case of blood poisoning. This fatality should prove a warning to all farmers who are called upon to administer to the relief of sick animals. -- Milwaukee Times Manitowoc Tribune - Thurs., Apr. 12, 1877\n\nBARTER, WM. LOST ON THE SEA BIRD Information Relative to the Citizens of Manitowoc who were Victims of the Late Disaster. Thirty-One Persons Lost. In fulfilling the painful duty which devolves upon us at this time we have endeavored to present to our readers a correct report containing all the information in regard to the lost which we could obtain. We fear there will be some errors, but we have as far as possible obtained the statements of relatives or immediate friends of the deceased. We would that some other hand than ours--one better skilled in soothing afflicted hearts-- might perform the sad office of saying comforting words to the distressed of our Village, but it may not be and we can only say to those who suffer, you have our heartfelt sympathy-- and the sympathy of every person in Manitowoc. We have known your friends, respected them, loved them; and your loss is our loss. Let us hope that He who doeth all things well hath not permitted our friends to fall in vain. WM. BARTER Came here some months ago. Was a painter by occupation. He was a single man and about 40 years of age. He was on his way to Chicago where he has generally spent his summers.

Byers, lost his life by drowning when he failed in an attempt to swim across the river near the Soo line carferry slip. Florian Wielkowski reported to the police that he saw the man fall into the river and start swimming toward the other side. At about the middle he went down and drowned before help could reach him. The body was recovered an hour later by the police. Officers hooked it with the drag line and brought it to the surface. Berendsen had apparently taken the day off and had been about the city. He had been around the depot only a short time before the tragedy and had passed out cigars. He was apparently a little the worse for liquor according to reports made to the police by Walter Wieseman, 817 North Tenth Street and Albert Engel, a clerk at the Soo depot, both of whom had observed the man about the depot and the yards. Wielkowski was the only eye witness to the falling into the river and drowning and he ran to the Franklin Street fire station to give the alarm. This was at 5:45 and officers went to the scene immediately but it was an hour before the body was recovered and resuscitation was out of the question. The coroner was notified but held it would not be necessary to hold an inquest. The body was then taken to the Vogelsang chapel where a search of the clothes revealed eighty-five cents in small change, a ten dollar bill and three one dollar bills besides papers which identified the man as a fireman on the Byers. A gold watch was also found on his person. Two Rivers Reporter Chronicle - Aug. 4, 1927\n\nBERG, HENRY Henry Berg died at his home in this city last Saturday and is to be buried today.

He had recently arrived from Germany and brought with him a reasonable sum of money. Apparently under the influence of drink, he shot himself in the head. ******** SUICIDE On Sunday afternoon a man named Adolph Bishoff committed suicide at Wooster's Hotel at Two Rivers by blowing his brains out with a revolver. He was a young fellow about twenty-five years of age who came from Germany last spring. He was always well dressed and seemed to have considerable money. He led a fast life and it is believed had about exhausted all the funds he had. He had attended the funeral of Sam Stone in company with Mr. Wooster and committed the deed a few minutes after his return. There were some men in the saloon and he approached one of them and said he intended to burn down his barn that night. He then went up to Wooster and said Something is going to happen tonight. Directly after he went out and stood a few feet from a group of four men who were engaged in conversation. He drew a revolver from his pocket and discharged the contents into his head. On Monday an inquest was held by Justice Goedgen. The verdict given was in accordance with the above facts. Bishoff boarded for some time at Nolan's in this city, but spent the greater part of his time with his aunt in Mishicott, a Mrs. Andrew Smith. No cause is assigned for the commission of the rash act.

A2\n\nBLEMSKI, FRANK From Der Nord Westen, 21 May 1908: Frank Blemski, a 73-year old resident of Town Newton, died recently.\n\nBLOECKLI, CHILD OF ULLRICH BODY OF CHILD THAT DIED AT BIRTH KEPT IN HOUSE FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS. The body of an infant was kept concealed in a shoe box for about two months at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ullrich Bloeckli, parents of the dead child, which was born to them in the fore part of January and died at birth. The discovery was made on Tuesday, March 5, by the county judge and the under- sheriff, who pursuant to a complaint made by Joseph Bierlie, father of Mrs. Bloeckli, had gone to the Bloeckli home to see if conditions there were as bad as they had been represented to be by the complainant. It was found that the family was poverty stricken and lived in squalor. It seems that the body of the dead infant was kept in the house because the parents had no money to give it a decent burial. There are five living children, the oldest being 8 years of age. They were taken to the county jail for temporary care. At the jail they were given baths and clean clothes. On Wednesday, March 6, the parents of the children were haled before the county judge and asked to show cause why their children should not be taken from them. During the hearing of the case it developed that conditions at the Bloeckli home were such that the children could not be properly cared for, and accordingly, the five children were taken from their parents and committed to St. Joseph's Catholic Orphan asylum at Green Bay, which institution was, in accordance with the requirements of the law in such cases given the guardianship over the children. The children were taken to Green Bay on March 6th. The father is said to be a steady, industrious workman.
