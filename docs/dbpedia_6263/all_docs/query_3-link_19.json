        "text": "[table]\n\nParameter,Value\n\nFull Name,James David Wolfensohn\n\nBorn,1 December 1933 in Sydney; New South Wales\n\n[/table]\n\nJames Wolfensohn competed for Australia in fencing at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics but his business career has far outshone his sporting one. He received a degree in law from the University of Sydney and worked briefly as a lawyer in Australia before attending Harvard Business School. After receiving his MBA he worked in Switzerland, Australia, and London before settling in the United States as a senior executive with Salomon Brothers. In 1980 he became a US citizen, and began his own investment firm, James D. Wolfensohn, Inc., which included among its partners Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nIn 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Wolfensohn to become President of the World Bank, and he assumed that post on 1 July 1995. The bank’s board of executive directors unanimously supported him for a second five-year term in 2000, and he became only the third person to serve two terms in that position.\n\nAfter leaving the World Bank he formed Wolfensohn & Company, LLC, a private investment firm and advisory group that provided consulting advice to governments and large corporations. He also became chairman of the International Advisory Board of Citigroup. He also served one year as special envoy for Gaza Disengagement for the Quartet in the Middle East, a post to which he was named by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In 2005, James Wolfensohn also founded the Wolfensohn Center for Development at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nHe has received numerous honors. He was an honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution, trustee and former chairman of the board for the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, chairman emeritus of the Carnegie Hall, and of the John F. Kennedy for the Performing Arts in Washington, and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1987 and received an honorary knighthood and OBE in 1995.\n\n[table]\n\nGames/Sport,Event,Position\n\n1956 Fencing,Men’s Team Épée,4 p1 r1/3\n\n[/table]\n\nOK, we know that Michael Phelps has won the most Olympic medals, with 22, and the most Olympic gold medals, with 18.

This is almost a purely American list, with 4 Norwegians on the list from the 1995 World Cup and 2000 Olympics (Gro Espeseth, Bente Nordby, Marianne Pettersen, Hege Riise). Below is the list of the American women who have won both titles, and the number of times.\n\nThe leader with 5 such championships is Christie Pearce-Rampone, with three Olympic gold medals (2004/08/12) and two World Cups (1999/2015). Seven American women have four titles – Heather O’Reilly, Shannon Boxx, Brandi Chastain, Joy Biefeld-Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and Mia Hamm. One could also add Hope Solo to this list, but this reflects one of the difficulties of compiling such a list. In 2004 Solo was on the Olympic team, but never played as a backup goaltender. Likewise, Tiffany Roberts was on the 2004 Olympic team but never played.\n\nOnly Heather Mitts has three such titles without winning both, as an Olympic gold medalist in 2004/08/12. Five Americans have won two Olympic gold medals, without winning the World Cup – Aly Wagner, Angela Hucles, Kate Sobrero-Markgraf, Lindsay Tarpley (2004/08), and Rachel Buehler (2008/12).\n\n[table]\n\nName,Total,#Oly,#WC,OlyYear(s),WCYear(s)\n\nChristie Pearce-Rampone,5,3,2,2004/08/12,1999/2015\n\nHeather O’Reilly,4,3,1,2004/08/12,2015\n\nShannon Boxx,4,3,1,2004/08/12,2015\n\nBrandi Chastain,4,2,2,1996/2004,1991/99\n\nJoy Biefeld-Fawcett,4,2,2,1996/2004,1991/99\n\nJulie Foudy,4,2,2,1996/2004,1991/99\n\nKristine Lilly,4,2,2,1996/2004,1991/99\n\nMia Hamm,4,2,2,1996/2004,1991/99\n\nAbby Wambach,3,2,1,2004/2012,2015\n\nAmy Rodriguez,3,2,1,2008/12,2015\n\nBriana Scurry,3,2,1,1996/2004,1999\n\nCarli Lloyd,3,2,1,2008/12,2015\n\nCindy Parlow,3,2,1,1996/2004,1999\n\nHope Solo,3,2,1,2008/12,2015\n\nKate Sobrero-Markgraf,3,2,1,2004/08,1999\n\nLauren Cheney-Holiday,3,2,1,2008/12,2015\n\nTobin Heath,3,2,1,2008/12,2015\n\nCarla Werden-Overbeck,3,1,2,1996,1991/99\n\nMichelle Akers,3,1,2,1996,1991/99\n\nAlex Morgan,2,1,1,2012,2015\n\nBecky Sauerbrunn,2,1,1,2012,2015\n\nCarin Jennings-Gabarra,2,1,1,1996,1991\n\nKelley O’Hara,2,1,1,2012,2015\n\nLori Chalupny,2,1,1,2008,2015\n\nMegan Rapinoe,2,1,1,2012,2015\n\nShannon MacMillan,2,1,1,1996,1999\n\nSydney Leroux,2,1,1,2012,2015\n\nTiffany Roberts,2,1,1,1996,1999\n\nTiffeny Milbrett,2,1,1,1996,1999\n\nTisha Venturini,2,1,1,1996,1999\n\n[/table]\n\nNick Zaccardi, NBC Olympics maven, posited that if Fiji gets 50+ athletes qualified for the 2016 Olympics, that it might be the most ever for a nation with less than 1,000,000 population. I tweeted recently that it would be and that no such current nation had had more than 40 competitors at a single Olympics. Unfortunately, I did not go back far enough checking those stats, and it has happened before.\n\nLuxembourg is the only nation with < 106 population (as of 2015) that has had 40 or more competitors at a single Olympics, and they have done it several times, with a high of 52 in 1960. They also had 47 in 1928, 45 in 1948, and 44 three times – 1936, 1948, and 1952.\n\nThe first such nation to compete at the Olympics was again Luxembourg, in 1900, although this was not known for over 80 years. Michel Théato, winner of the 1900 marathon, was always considered French until French athletics historian Alain Bouillé discovered in the early 1980s that he was actually a Luxembourgeois national. In 1908 and 1912 Iceland competed, although it was a Danish territory in both those years. From 1920-28 Luxembourg and Monaco competed, along with Malta in 1928. It was not until 1936 that six such small nations competed – Bermuda, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco. In 2012, fully 43 such small nations competed at London.\n\nThrough 2012, such small nations have competed 398 times at the Summer Olympics – we did not check Winter Olympics for this stat. This has been done in all by 43 nations, although Guyana (British Guiana), Belize (British Honduras), and Samoa (Western Samoa), competed under two different names in various years.\n\nThe following list is inclusive of all nations who have competed at the Olympics, with 10 or more competitors, both men and women, at a single Summer Olympics, and currently have a population under a million. I did not try to go back and check populations at the time of their Olympic participation – sorry, but that would be a huge effort. This also eliminates a few small nations that no longer exist as nations, notably Netherlands Antilles and Newfoundland, both of which have competed at the Olympics, but never with very many athletes.\n\n[table]\n\nNation,3LA,Year,###\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1960,52\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1928,47\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1948,45\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1924,44\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1936,44\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1952,44\n\nMontenegro,MNE,2012,33\n\nIceland,ISL,1988,32\n\nIceland,ISL,1984,30\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1984,29\n\nIceland,ISL,1992,27\n\nIceland,ISL,2008,27\n\nIceland,ISL,2012,27\n\nIceland,ISL,2004,26\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1996,26\n\nIceland,ISL,1972,25\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1920,25\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,2000,25\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,2008,25\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1992,25\n\nFiji,FIJ,1988,23\n\nCyprus,CYP,2000,22\n\nGuam,GUM,1992,22\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1984,22\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,2004,22\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1988,22\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1912,21\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,2012,21\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1976,21\n\nBermuda,BER,1992,20\n\nCyprus,CYP,2004,20\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1972,20\n\nGuam,GUM,1988,19\n\nIceland,ISL,1948,19\n\nMontenegro,MNE,2008,19\n\nSan Marino,SMR,1984,19\n\nBarbados,BAR,2000,18\n\nFiji,FIJ,1992,18\n\nIceland,ISL,2000,18\n\nBarbados,BAR,1988,17\n\nBarbados,BAR,1992,17\n\nCyprus,CYP,1992,17\n\nCyprus,CYP,1996,17\n\nCyprus,CYP,2008,17\n\nFiji,FIJ,1996,17\n\nSan Marino,SMR,1992,17\n\nBarbados,BAR,1984,16\n\nBermuda,BER,1976,16\n\nSan Marino,SMR,1980,16\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1968,16\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1988,16\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1972,16\n\nAntigua and Barbuda,ANT,1988,15\n\nAntigua and Barbuda,ANT,1984,14\n\nCyprus,CYP,1980,14\n\nFiji,FIJ,1984,14\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1992,14\n\nAntigua and Barbuda,ANT,1992,13\n\nAntigua and Barbuda,ANT,1996,13\n\nBarbados,BAR,1972,13\n\nBarbados,BAR,1996,13\n\nCyprus,CYP,2012,13\n\nIceland,ISL,1976,13\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,2008,13\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1960,13\n\nBermuda,BER,1948,12\n\nBermuda,BER,1984,12\n\nBermuda,BER,1988,12\n\nIceland,ISL,1936,12\n\nLiechtenstein,LIE,1988,12\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1964,12\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands,ISV,1996,12\n\nBarbados,BAR,1976,11\n\nBelize,BIZ,1984,11\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1956,11\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,1972,11\n\nMalta,MLT,1936,11\n\nMonaco,MON,1960,11\n\nSamoa,SAM,1988,11\n\nSan Marino,SMR,1988,11\n\nSeychelles,SEY,1980,11\n\nSeychelles,SEY,1992,11\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1964,11\n\nThe Bahamas,BAH,1976,11\n\nAntigua and Barbuda,ANT,1976,10\n\nBarbados,BAR,2004,10\n\nBelize,BIZ,1988,10\n\nBelize,BIZ,1992,10\n\nBermuda,BER,2004,10\n\nCayman Islands,CAY,1992,10\n\nCyprus,CYP,1984,10\n\nGuyana,GUY,1984,10\n\nLuxembourg,LUX,2004,10\n\nMalta,MLT,1960,10\n\nSan Marino,SMR,1976,10\n\nSt. Kitts & Nevis,SKN,1996,10\n\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n\nParameter,Value\n\nUsed Name,Jaroslav Drobný\n\nBorn,12 October 1921; Praha (Prague) (CZE)\n\nDied,13 September 2001; Tooting-Greater London (GBR)\n\nAffiliations,ČLTK Praha (CZE)\n\n[/table]\n\nJaroslav Drobný won an Olympic silver medal with the Czechoslovakian ice hockey squad at the 1948 St. Moritz Olympics, but was more famous as a tennis player. For years, he played ice hockey during the winter and tennis in the summer, but his hockey career was cut short in 1949. During a tennis tournament in Gstaad, Switzerland, he defected from communist Czechoslovakia with a fellow Davis Cup player, Vladimír Černík. Drobný, who had won the 1947 World Championships with Czechoslovakia, could no longer represent his country on the ice.\n\nAs an Egyptian citizen, Drobný won Grand Slam singles titles at Roland Garros (1951, 1952) and Wimbledon (1954). His 1954 Wimbledon championship made him the first left-hander to win that title. He was also a five-time runner-up in Grand Slam events; three times at Roland Garros (1946, 1948, 1950), and twice at Wimbledon (1949, 1952). His ice hockey legacy could still be found in his dark prescription glasses, which he needed following a hockey accident that severely affected his eyesight.\n\nDrobný uniquely competed at Wimbledon for four different “nations.” He first played there in 1938, representing Czechoslovakia, and again under that designation in 1946-49. In 1939, following political upheaval in Europe, he was listed from the Nazi-occupied protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. Following his 1949 defection, Drobný was given an Egyptian passport, and won his Grand Slam titles representing that nation from 1950-59. In 1959, he traded his Egyptian passport for a British one, and lived in London for the rest of his life. During a 15-year amateur career, he won over 130 singles titles, and was world ranked in the top 10 from 1946-55. Drobný was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983. In 1997 he was made a member of the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\n[table]\n\nParameter,Value\n\nFull Name,Ion Ioan Ţiriac\n\nBorn,9 May 1939 in Braşov; ROU\n\nMeasurements,183 cm / 84 kg\n\nAffiliations,Sportul Studenţesc; Bucureşti\n\n[/table]\n\nIon Ţiriac played ice hockey for Romania at the 1964 Winter Olympics, but it was only a prelude to a much larger life. His main sport was tennis and he became one of the top players in the world, winning the 1970 French Open men’s doubles alongside Ilie Năstase. Ţiriac’s best finish in a singles Grand Slam was making the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 1968. He was best known for his doubles play, winning 22 career professional titles.\n\nAfter his playing career ended in the mid-1970s, Ţiriac turned to managing athletes, most notably as the coach and manager of Boris Becker from 1984-1993. He also coached or managed, among others, Năstase, Guillermo Vilas, Mary Joe Fernández, Goran Ivanišević, and Marat Safin. Ţiriac also started running and managing tennis events, including the Madrid Tennis Open, the Italian Open, and in Romania, the BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy. In 2013 Ţiriac was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nȚiriac’s business interests then branched out and in 1990, after the fall of Communism in Romania, he founded Banca Țiriac, the first private bank in that country. The bank merged several times, eventually becoming UniCredit Ţiriac Bank, one of the largest banks in Romania.
