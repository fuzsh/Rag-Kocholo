        "text": "United States heads back to the Olympics in the 49er\n\nTokyo 2020 marked the first time in history the United States did not send a full slate to the Olympic Games, after missing the final qualification opportunity in the 49er class at the 2019 Pan American Games. In Paris, the United States will be represented once again in the 49er class.\n\nThe duo of Andrew Mollerus and Ian MacDiarmid, along with Ian Barrows and Hans Henken, officially punched their tickets by qualifying to the medal race at the 2023 Sailing World Championships.\n\nBarrows and Henken were awarded the spot with their performance at the Olympic Trials in January. Both men will be making their Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nDaniela Moroz makes history\n\nDaniela Moroz was not only the first U.S. sailor to make the Olympic team for Paris 2024, but she made history by becoming the first American to ever qualify to the Olympic Games in formula kite â€” a sailing event that will make its Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nThe six-time world champion earned her spot by placing third in the Olympic test event in Marseille in July of 2023 and then finishing fifth at the world championships in the Netherlands a month later. Moroz will look to become the first American woman to win an Olympic sailing medal since 2008 when Anna Tunnicliffe Tobias won gold in the Laser Radial class.\n\nSEE MORE: Daniela Moroz's Olympic journey began with her parents' escape\n\nEllie Aldridge eyes gold in Paris"
