        "text": "Bosco Football Dominates JSerra In Homecoming Game, Takes On Orange Lutheran At Home Tonight\n\nby Michael Barba\n\nThe Braves pulled off an impressive 31-0 win against JeSerra to move to 2-1 in Trinity League play, and look to put on another show for the fans tonight against the Orange Lutheran Lancers.\n\nPhoto by Alex Diaz, Photo Editor\n\nLast Friday, the Braves added a seventh win to their collection in the Homecoming game against the JSerra Lions. This imposing win places the Braves second in the Trinity League, second in California and fourth in the nation, with their only loss coming to the “Team in Red.”\n\nEntering the contest, the Braves were confident considering all of the work that went into this match up. Defensively, the Braves were dominant with 84 tackles in total, and senior defensive back Jshawn Frausto-Ramos secured two interceptions – one he returned for a touchdown.\n\n“Heading into game day I was very confident because it was our Homecoming game,” said Jshawn. “The reason our defense was so on point was because of our defensive coordinators getting us ready for the game.” FULL STORY\n\nBosco Football Faces Off Against The “Team In Red”\n\nby Michael Barba\n\nThe Braves completed their sixth straight dominant performance of the season with a 49-3 win against the Servite Friars, and will continue on to the Santa Ana Bowl to take on the “Team in Red” in the most anticipated match-up of the year so far.\n\nPhoto by Alex Diaz, Photo Editor\n\nBosco Football retains their title as number one high school football team in America and seek to defend their mantle and win streak against the second best high school football team in the country in the “Team in Red.”\n\nThe anticipation for this game is like no other, with the last game against the “Team in Red” drawing a total of 6,000 strong at Panish Family Stadium last season. Due to the talent on both ends of this rivalry, the Braves have been putting every ounce of effort and focus in preparation for gameday.\n\nThe last match-up between the two ended in a 42-21 loss for the Braves, but it is looking more competitive than ever with both teams holding on to a 6-0 record heading into this year’s contest. FULL STORY\n\nBosco Football Opens Trinity league Season Against Servite\n\nby Michael Barba\n\nAfter an unmerciful 65-0 win against the Central Catholic Raiders, the Braves head into Trinity League play undefeated against their long time rivals, Servite High School Friars.\n\nPhoto by Alex Diaz, Photo Editor\n\nThe Braves have yet to disappoint with an impressive 5-0 win streak against some of the fiercest competition in the country. The title of the number one high school football team in the nation currently is awarded to the Braves, but the 33rd ranked high school football team of Southern California, the Friars, looks to knock them from that mantle.\n\nThe Friars were the last football team to beat the Braves, ending their run for CIF gold last season. Due to this, Bosco Football looks to be stronger than ever by the time they step onto the field to seek revenge.\n\n“What we have been doing over the past five weeks is to prepare for the entire Trinity League, not just Servite. We’re trying to get better as a football team and improve on some of the areas from week-to-week that we feel we’ve been deficient in,” Head Coach Jason Negro said. “Servite is a talented team. They ended our season last year, so we are motivated.” FULL STORY\n\nNew Sailing Team Hopes To Show They’re Worth Their Salt\n\nBy Isaac Mays, Sports Editor\n\nSt. John Bosco High School Athletics hoisted the sails this Summer, introducing a new seafaring team, adding to the already impressive range of sports to join.\n\nPhoto by Jacksnowwwwww via Instagram\n\nBosco Sailing plans to embark on a fulfilling and competitive journey, with hopes of gifting a passion for a world of seafaring to many students. This program is largely student-led, with co-captains Jack Snow and Samuel Mohinani helping to direct the team. The prospect of students being partially at the helm makes the environment more approachable and friendly for the Braves who are just getting into sailing.\n\nThe team currently sails in the Los Alamitos Bay in Long Beach at the Alamitos Bay Yacht Club (ABYC). Their season has just started, although any students interested still have time to join. The team already plans to participate in a few sailing competitions, known as regattas, throughout the season, and the program is ramping up to be an exciting new opportunity for the Bosco community.\n\nWhile the team is still in their preparation phase, they are nonetheless excited to unveil their talents and skills at the approaching regattas. Skippers sophomore Jack Snow and junior Samuel Mohinani both have prior sailing experience and are able to help aid in the learning process for new sailors. FULL STORY\n\nBosco Football Defeats Kahuku, Takes On The Central Catholic Raiders From Northern California\n\nby Christian Angel, Managing Editor\n\nAfter defeating the Kahuku Red Raiders last week in their home opener, the St. John Bosco Braves look to continue their winning streak and national title run against the Central Catholic High School Raiders from Modesto at Panish Family Stadium tonight.\n\nPhoto By Alex Diaz, Photo Editor\n\nHead Coach Jason Negro and the Braves represented in the The Trinity League vs. USA Showcase last week against the Aloha State’s best, the Kahuku High School Red Raiders, claiming a gritty 34-7 victory.\n\nWhile fans are looking ahead to the Braves entering Trinity League play and eventually taking on the nation’s second-ranked “Team in Red” on October 7, the Braves’ main focus is to dominate their last non-league game against Central Catholic.\n\nBosco Football comes into this week again as the consensus number one high school football team in the nation after going 4-0 in the past four weeks, defeating their first four opponents by a combined score of 177-28. FULL STORY\n\nBosco Water Polo Has Its Sights Set On CIF Playoffs\n\nBy Marcelles Williams\n\nHead Coach Jeff Powers is encouraged by an experienced squad featuring a strong core of senior leadership, who he hopes will use their experience to leave their final mark on Brave Aquatics.\n\nPhoto by Robert Visty III, Photo Editor\n\nThis team presents a lot of strong talent, and who better to coach them than Coach Powers? Coach Powers first found the sport in 1994 and became a two time Olympian who played a major factor in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where Team USA brought home a Silver Medal.

Turf\n\nby Aydn Morris\n\nEach year more and more sports fields change from natural grass to artificial grass in order to improve the cost and looks of their complex. Though it may be more dangerous for the athletes to play on turf rather than well-maintained grass.\n\nArtificial grass (turf) holds many benefits to athletes, as it can be easily maintained and can allow the athlete to perform better. Although turf may have many benefits, it also has strong negatives as it is significantly harder on the body than grass is.\n\nTurf fields have been highly preferred by Bosco athletes to play on due to how badly grass fields may be maintained. Artificial grass has been installed more in high school and college-level sports due to how much cheaper it is to maintain over time compared to natural grass.\n\nTurf fields have not had the greatest history when it comes to injuries, as many athletes like to play on turf fields, in a long-term decision grass is more recommended to play on to prevent injury.

Despite such heavy losses, the team remains optimistic that they can challenge for a Trinity League title following a couple years of coming up just short.\n\n“I feel like in league, we should be able to win the Trinity League championship, but it won’t be easy at all. We have to take film very seriously and know player personnel, so that we can be really good when the time comes to play,” said senior forward Christian Estrada.

Led by quarterbacks Katin Houser and Pierce Clarkson, they look to continue their great performances and now seek to add yet another National Championship.\n\nThey will face off against the Los Alamitos Griffins who finished 9-1 as well while winning the Sunset League and finishing league play undefeated. Led by five-star junior quarterback Malachi Nelson, the Griffins come in as the underdogs in this matchup.\n\nBoth Braves quarterbacks will look to continue their hot streak after an amazing year with Katin Houser throwing for 1,366 yards and twelve touchdowns. As well Pierce Clarkson finished the year having thrown 1,296 yards and 15 touchdowns.\n\nThis game won’t be easy for the Braves, as Los Alamitos will have a chip on their shoulder trying to knock off the nationally-ranked Bosco Braves.\n\n“Yeah it’s a big game, it’s going to take a lot of mid-game adjustments and the entire team just needs to be ready to ball. Obviously, with it being one game elimination in playoffs we have to play our best, we can’t worry about who they have or how many stars their players got, we just have to play our game and when we do that I think we are one of, if not the best team in the country,” said Senior Katin Houser.

He finished about 20 seconds faster than the next best time.\n\nAlthough this race may have been dedicated to the seniors for their senior day, sophomores Aiden Aldana and Andrew Perez put on a show as well. Aiden, who has been excellent this year, finished fourth with a time of 15:35.4, while Andrew finished ninth at 15:42.2\n\nFollowing a long break from competition due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Braves were excited to have a season without much restriction.\n\n“We have enjoyed being able to travel again this year, being able to meet with a lot of runners and going back to invitationals again,” said Ruben Solorza, an assistant coach.\n\nLast season, the Braves were not able to do their normal meets because of the pandemic, instead competing league dual meets, which is racing against one opposing team at a time.

Both teams are coming into the matchup 8-1 overall and 3-1 in League Play. This matchup will most certainly be a nail-biter as both teams have looked extremely sharp coming into this game. Servite is currently ranked second in California and fifth nationally according to MaxPreps, with Bosco being ranked third and fourth respectively.\n\nBosco has had continuous success with both of their quarterbacks this season, and will once again look to lean on them for support. Both quarterbacks put up impressive stat lines last game, as Katin Houser completed seven of twelve. including a touchdown, while Pierce Clarkson completed nine of eleven, providing two touchdowns. With that in mind, it seems as though both quarterbacks are finding their rhythm, and will both need to be playing at their highest level in order to top Servite.\n\nThis will be a make-or-break game for both teams, as both teams are in desperate need of a victory in this matchup in order to be set up for a solid playoff run. Furthermore, the losing team will drop to third place in the Trinity League, where Bosco has not finished since 2011. Though this will not be an easy game for either team, as it seems both teams are playing the best football they have all season.\n\nServite is coming off of a heartbreaking loss to “The Team in Red,” with the final score being 46-37, and will look to bounce back from that loss with a vital win against the Braves. After playing extremely well last game, it appears that Servite is playing some of the best football they have played in years.

From the tip-off, the Bucks maintained control the entire game starting with last year’s finals MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, having a stellar game scoring 32 points, securing 14 rebounds and dishing out seven assists with two blocked shots. Behind him was all-star teammate Kris Middleton who scored 20 points and recorded nine rebounds.\n\nWhat made this game special to the team is not only the ring ceremony, but also seeing Giannis improve so much in his shooting. Last season Giannis struggled from the free throw line and had the longest free throw routine in the league. He shot a free throw percentage of 69% on 9.5 attempts per game and his routine was regularly at or over the allotted ten seconds.\n\nHe may not have shot perfectly from the free throw line in the season opener, but he showed great improvements from last year.

From Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs being “figured out” by the league to Lamar Jackson and the Ravens putting on a show seemingly every game, the league has astonished its many fans.\n\nHowever, the story of the season for many homers starts in the City of Angels. Although the season is still in its early stages, the Rams and Chargers have both shown that they are serious contenders.\n\nThe Rams, are coming off a dominant win against the New York Giants and boast a great record on the season so far at 5-1, currently holding the 2nd place seed in the NFC West behind the Arizona Cardinals. The Chargers, who recently had a disappointing loss to the Ravens and another heartbreaker earlier in the season to the NFC powerhouse Dallas Cowboys, are still in a good place in the standings with a 4-2 record, which is tied with the Las Vegas Raiders for first place, though due to the head to head record, they have the advantage in seeding if the season were to end today.

With both teams claiming one-sided games throughout the series, it was only right for the series to end in a nail-biting one-run game that came down to the very last pitch.\n\nThe Dodgers in a last minute, game time decision started relief pitcher Corey Knebel on Thursday evening at Oracle Park in place of Julio Urias for strategic purposes that would seem to benefit them in the end. The Dodgers would end up using their bullpen to the max this game, creating more favorable matchups for their players and allowing for each pitcher to stay fresh.\n\nJulio Urias would take over for the Dodgers pitching in the third inning out of the bullpen, going on to pitch four innings allowing one run on a solo homer with three hits and 5 strikeouts.\n\nThis would prove to be enough to get the Dodgers the win, as the small ball would pay off with standout Mookie Betts going 4 for 4 with four singles and a run scored.

The two teams have met thousands of times and no matter how much better one team is compared to the other, they figure out ways to make the games close and competitive.\n\nBut, even with all the regular season battles, this year is the first time the Dodgers and Giants have met in the postseason. The amazing part about this matchup is the fact that the two teams are polar opposites.\n\nThe Dodgers have a team full of stars with the highest payroll in all of baseball. Meanwhile, the Giants have a much younger core with a few veterans leading the charge.\n\nThe NLDS is a five game series, and the pair have already competed twice thus far. It’s safe to say both games were action-packed and high scoring, as the run total of just two games has come to a staggering 15 runs.

The opponent might not be the best, but they need to win big this week to get back on their feet after a 42-21 loss last Friday.\n\nThe Braves senior leadership will be put on the spot to help get the team back in check and make necessary adjustments.\n\n“This week is all about us. The only team that could beat us is ourselves. We believe with the guys we have when we play our game there is nobody in the country that can beat us. So this week we just got to bounce back strong and show why we have the talent to win another CIF Championship as well as National championship,” said Earnest Greene, senior offensive linemen.\n\nThe Lions come into this game at 3-3 after an embarrassing loss to another Trinity League opponent, Santa Margarita. This will be a great test to both teams as there should be plenty of adjustments made after coming off of a rough week from both sides.\n\n“We just got to play better, got to execute way better. And we also had a couple of drives in the red zone where we didn’t take advantage of, and that just can’t happen. So we just got to tighten up. We are not worried we will see them [the Team in Red] again,” said Greene.

Being a Wild Card game, the loser tonight will go home, and the winner will go on to face the best team in baseball, the San Francisco Giants, in the National League Division Series (NLDS).\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled to take place at 5:10 P.M. PT at Dodger Stadium. Both teams will be rolling out their best pitchers, with the Dodgers starting trade deadline acquisition Max Scherzer against Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright. However, the Dodgers will be without power-hitting first baseman and MVP candidate Max Muncy, who injured his elbow in a collision at first base on Sunday.\n\nAs of right now, the Dodgers are -219 favorites according to Caesar Sportsbook. Although the Blue Crew have to play in the Wild Card game, the Dodgers had the second best record in the MLB at 106-56, second only to their divisional rivals, the Giants.\n\nDespite the Dodgers having 16 more wins than their opponent, the Cardinals, who looked hopeless throughout much of July and August, they are not to be taken lightly. The Cardinals posted a 23-10 record in the last month of the season, winning a franchise record 17 games in a row at one point. Therefore, with both aces on the mound, and two offenses that have proven that they can score runs, the match up promises to be one not to miss.\n\nAlthough they are the underdogs, the Cardinals have a talent-filled roster that consists of a mix of veterans and young players. Future Hall-of-Famers, like catcher Yadier Molina and pitcher Adam Wainwright (who will be on the bump tonight for the Cardinals), have stepped up and led this group to the playoffs.

The Braves will then play three consecutive away games at JSerra, Orange Lutheran, and Santa Margarita before they will return home for their final league game against Servite, which is another contest with a ton of hype.\n\nThis will be the first meeting with the Team in Red this year, and the match-up has proven to be one of the biggest and best rivalries in all of high school sports. Last year, the two teams met at the end of their seasons where the Team in Red were victorious over our Braves to close out Trinity League competition in an abridged season absent of any CIF playoffs. This year, the Braves seek vengeance.\n\nThe excitement is at an all time high coming off the COVID-19 season, and this game will most likely decide seeding for this year’s upcoming CIF playoffs. If there was any doubt about the anticipation surrounding this match-up, tickets for the game sold out in just four minutes on the GoFan website.\n\nPer usual, both teams come in evenhanded, which have made for instant classics in years past. The Team in Red comes in as the nation’s top ranked team, according to MaxPreps, but Coach Jason Negro’s squad looks to make its case as top dog.

The Angels’ Ohtani, who has made history numerous times this year as both a pitcher and a hitter, is the frontrunner in a tight race against prodigy son Vladimir Guerrero Jr. of the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nThe Angels, coming off yet another disappointing year filled with injuries and much more, had light in the performance of Ohtani, as Shohei became “Shotime.” There’s no doubt that Ohtani is doing something that has never been seen before, but does it do enough to overtake Guerrero’s extremely impressive season?\n\nThe simple answer is yes, as the name of the award is Most Valuable Player, and even with Toronto being a team that is still fighting for a playoff spot, Shohei Ohtani is much more important to his team.\n\nEven with Guerrero’s offensive stats being higher than Ohtani’s, he doesn’t provide enough as a hitter only to help his team win as many games. Shohei is coming off a 9-2 season on the bump, with many of his 23 starts being quality starts that ended in no decisions.\n\nOhtani also had an astonishing 3.18 earned run average (ERA) and went undefeated in his starts at home. He became almost unhittable towards the end of the season, fixing his command issue and making batters swing and miss more frequently.

The Braves have been excited for this season, given their last season was continuously delayed.\n\n“Last year water polo was getting dragged on forever for the initial start of their season, from being told they would start in October to December all the way back to March. And their ended up being not much hype to the season,” said Head Coach Jeff Powers.\n\nThe push back of the season made it tough for the Braves to be consistently prepared as well as motivated for their season. This push back also remarkably shortened the season with water polo only being able to play 6 games in the two-to-three week schedule.\n\nThey went 2-4 overall in those six games that they played, but so far this year the Braves are 7-8 after winning their last game against Sage Hill by a score of 13-5.\n\nWith the 7-8 record start for the Braves, they are still in contention for CIF playoffs hopes. As of now they are in Division Five, and if they are able to make it to the playoffs, they will work on a deep playoff run that would hopefully lead to a championship.

Despite the Flyers giving up two big plays to start, the Braves were forced to give back the ball. The rest of the first would be a defensive battle with neither team scoring, but that would quickly change in the second quarter.\n\nThe Braves would start by scoring the first touchdown of the game on a long run by the quarterback Pierce Clarkson, giving Bosco a 7-0 lead.

The thirteen years that I’ve been here we’ve always had a good four or five months to prepare. It’s been difficult, so in reality we can’t really prepare too much, we just have to maintain health,” said Coach Sabet.

Javale McGee, a player who for the past two years had provided very valuable shot blocking to the team was traded away in a move to allow cap space for the Gasol signing. However more than halfway into the season Marc has not shown up in the ways the lakers had been hoping for, he’s put out a very lackluster performance on the offensive side, and considering who the lakers traded away in order to acquire Gasol, his performance is well below the standards he should be meeting. The Lakers need a much better big man who can contribute more of a shot blocking presence and more of an inside threat then Gasol has proven to show this year. Had the Lakers decided to keep Javale instead of pursuing Gasol, they would be in a much better spot for their center position.\n\nKyle Kuzma:\n\nKyle Kuzma has shown an ability to shine when given the opportunity, especially with Anthony Davis out for an extended period of time. With Davis out of the lineup Kuzma has had the ability to play an extended amount of minutes at the forward position, contributing some very efficient defense, and giving some very solid shooting splits just as he did years prior. The problem however is that Kuzma should be the third option but while Davis has been healthy has not shown that he can put up that kind of a production on a consistent basis, he showed a lot of potential and a very wide set of skills in his first few Years on the team, but as time has passed has regressed somewhat. Whilst not putting up very impressive numbers consistently, he is still a very young and skilled player who could be a very valuable part of another teams future, should the Lakers trade him, they could receive a very solid batch of wither players of Picks in return. He could even be a large part of a trade package for a star player should the Lakers be looking to make a big move before the trade deadline.

It proved to not be a problem at all as the Braves cruised to a 42-21 win Saturday night over Sierra Canyon to begin the 2021 spring season.\n\nBosco sophomore Pierce Clarkson and junior Katin Houser were the ones responsible for filling the void DJ Uiagalelei left under center and they both did a great job alternating possessions. Replacing DJ Uiagalelei at quarterback was never going to be an easy job, but both showed why FBS offers are starting to pile up.\n\n“We’re going to see some very good quarterback play,” St. John Bosco coach Jason Negro said.\n\nThe second half would prove to be a stroll as St. John Bosco dominated the second half thanks to the help of running back Rayshon Luke as he rushed for a 67-yard score on the opening possession. Setting up the play was a connection between Clarkson and sophomore standout Matayo Uiagalelei came through clutch on a third-down conversion. DJ’s younger brother stood out on both sides of the ball and showed why he’s the fifth-rated recruit in California from the Class of 2023.

Even though they didn’t play, last season still had an effect on the Braves, with many of the players not being able to showcase their talents to college scouts. Since then, the Braves have been counting down the minutes until the first pitch this afternoon.\n\nThe previous season should have the Braves fired up with finally having the opportunity to truly showcase their talents. The team is junior-heavy with 12 out of 25 players being juniors, while also having some committed seniors, such as Caleb Brandon, who is a transfer from Millikan High School committed to USC, Anthony Thomas, committed to Colorado Christian, and Dylan Lina who previously won a gold medal for Team USA at an international tournament in Mexico.\n\nThe Braves will once again be led by varsity head coach Don Barbara, who played college baseball at Long Beach State and in the minor leagues for eight years. Despite nearly over two decades of coaching experience, this year has been unlike any other for the manager. FULL STORY\n\nSports: Bosco Cross Country Season Comes To A Close As Seniors Reminisce\n\nby Joseph Theisen\n\nIn the midst of a pandemic, St. John Bosco looked forward to an impressive final season for many seniors, and a bright future for the underclassmen. While abnormal, the season was memorable for seniors and upperclassmen alike.\n\nBosco Cross Country has recently wrapped up its season, being the final one for many notable seniors and Coach Mac could not be any prouder. Coach Mac has addressed the differences between what a regular season used to be and how the most recent season was during the pandemic. The restrictions have reminded him of the type of competition he had when he himself was a runner.\n\n“The races are like they were twenty years ago, where you run dual meets. We’re allowed to run against only one team at a time in our league. That’s how it was years ago, and what we’ve been doing in the past twenty years is called cluster meets, which is everybody in the league runs against everybody, all at once, and then you score it separately, but it’s kinda cool,” said Coach Mac.\n\nWhile the rules of the new season were different for the runners themselves, Coach Mac clearly had experience with dual meets, which is a large reason why he was able to adapt to it so easily from a coaching standpoint. Additionally, it also gave Coach Mac and his runners a bit of a break, as it allowed them to focus on one team at time rather than multiple at once.

Despite some new names and younger players leading the team this year, the Braves are still overwhelmingly favored to defend their championship throne.\n\nThe last time St. John Bosco played in an official game wearing its school uniforms, it was while beating De La Salle High School in the 2019 state championship that also crowned the Braves the undisputed National Champions. Prior to the COVID-19 shutdown, St. John Bosco were originally scheduled to kick off their season with an opening game against the same Northern California powerhouse De La Salle, but that game was canceled as the pandemic forced the state to shove football back several times.\n\nSt. John Bosco will now instead host reigning CIF-SS Division 2 champion Sierra Canyon this Saturday on their home turf looking to show the world they haven’t missed a beat. Last Saturday, St. John Bosco and Damien High School got together at Damien for a scrimmage before both team’s upcoming season openers.\n\nWhile they spent the first half hour working on special teams and scrimmaged just two quarters, it was worth it for both teams to finally feel what it’s like to trade paint again. It won’t be a full season, but for St. John Bosco High School Head Coach Jason Negro, it’s something to celebrate.\n\n“It was just exhilaration and excitement and I was just so happy for all of the student athletes in California to have an opportunity to get back on to the playing field and to do something they loved,” said Negro in an interview with Spectrum News. “That’s something to really shout about and I’m looking forward to coming out of that tunnel and watching these kids compete.” FULL STORY\n\nSports: The City Of Stars Continues To Grow As Both L.A. Area MLB Teams Make Splashes In Free Agency\n\nby Aeden Alexander\n\nNow that we are almost half way through Spring Training, it’s a perfect time to look at how both the Angels and Dodgers made improvements to their teams and how well they’ll play out.\n\nFor starters, the LA Dodgers shocked the world with the major signing of last year’s Cy Young Winner Trevor Bauer. Considering LA’s already loaded rotation which includes the likes of Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler, this only added more firepower despite the price the Dodgers payed for Bauer.\n\nIn just a few innings of work this spring, Trevor Bauer has shown no signs of slowing down from last years Cy Young campaign as all of his pitches seem to be almost even better than last year. The doubters have been at an all time high, claiming Bauer was only good last season because of the division he played in, which left him matched up against lower skilled players.\n\nThis season, though, it will be the ultimate test for him and his Dodger teammates as they have to deal with a young San Diego Padres team that was already good but had one of the greatest offseasons in major league history, picking up former Cy Young winner Blake Snell and star pitcher Yu Darvish, amongst other moves.\n\nThe defending champs are indeed looking to go back to back this year and a major player who helped them win was Justin Turner. After seeing how much money it would take for him to re-sign, many fans believed that he was long gone as he was a free agent. However, LA managed to pull off re-signing Turner on top of signing Bauer in hopes his impact will be as major as it was in the previous years.

There is no way to dive into that type of thing. Obviously, dates are going to have to be shuffled.” FULL STORY\n\nSports: Game Time Decision To Postpone Steelers Vs Ravens Leads To Major Conflict About Favoritism Which Brings Us To Remembering It Occurs In All Sports\n\nby Aeden Alexander\n\nSports are not just for entertainment but also a business needing to bring in money in which fans sometimes forget that and only believe they are for viewing purposes only.\n\nAfter fans complained about the favoritism in the NFL about how the Ravens vs Steelers game was able to be postponed because of COVID cases while the league decided to force the Broncos to play Sunday with ZERO quarterbacks available.This led many fans to understand that the NFL and all sports leagues in general is overall just a business.\n\nThis decision was very controversial because people believe the decision was unfair and only a “money move” for the NFL as the Ravens and Steelers game was the most important and attention grabber to people. While the Broncos Vs Saints game was not nearly as important and wouldn’t bring in as much revenue.\n\nThese occurrences haven’t only happened in the NFL but in all the professional sports around us. The term “favoritism” is a word that is tossed around a lot in all professional sports because there are many occurrences of certain teams getting more opportunities or chances because they are more popular or the matchup between teams are more important which bring in more attention and money.

Though the fight ended in an unofficial split draw on the WBC-appointed judges scorecards, the bigger and better result was that neither man was badly hurt in the bout\n\nWhile Jones’ return to the ring was his first since 2018, it was Tyson’s first time back in 15 years. But the man who established himself as one of the most dominant heavyweights in the game back in his prime showed glimpses of the form that made him an undisputed champion decades ago.\n\n“The body shots definitely took a toll,” said Jones post-fight about Tyson’s attack. “It’s something to take the punches that Mike throws. I’m cool with a draw. Maybe we can do it again.” FULL STORY\n\nSports: Diego Maradona, One Of Soccer’s Greatest Players, Is Dead At 60\n\nby Diego Santizo, Sports Editor\n\nVery few people in any generation possess the power to make the world hold its breath.

He started off his Bellator career with a 4-1 record before having two disappointing losses. Despite having a rocky start he seemed to be a changed fighter and looks to be better than he ever has.\n\nThe fighter he was facing in this fight named John de Jesus was also coming off of a win with a unanimous decision over Vladyslav Parubchenko where he was dominant the entire fight. The fighter used his wide range of different striking techniques to keep his opponent always on his back foot keeping the fight where he wanted. Though with Pico this didn’t work.\n\nAbout midway through the first round, Pico was able to take John de Jesus to the ground and out wrestle him the rest of the round. It was a dominant round win for Pico and it seemed to be a good start to the fight for him. After this going into the second round he looked to do the same with an early takedown being landed.\n\nAfter this take-down was landed they were on the ground for a little while though John de Jesus was able to get back to his feet. While on the feet Aaron Pico had John de Jesus up against the fence with Pico controlling the standing exchange. This is when Jesus went to throw a right knee but Pico was ready and combatted his knee with a right overhand that put Jesus to sleep.

These are the top ten free-agents the Dodgers may target.\n\n(1.) Trevor Bauer RHP\n\nTrevor Bauer is the number one pitcher coming off the 2020 season with an impressive year winning NL Cy Young and leading his Cincinnati Reds to the playoffs. Bauer’s been a successful pitcher his entire career and continues to dominate. He would fit very well into the Dodgers Organization as he went to UCLA and the Dodgers need pitching.\n\n(2.) Justin Turner 3B\n\nThe Dodgers veteran third basemen reached the end of his contract with LA this year, and even though he might not have had a MVP type year, he still showed up in the playoffs and played a major role in helping the Dodgers win the World Series. For the Dodgers to have the chance to win again this year they need to keep their offense together and this was a big battery to that lineup.

This will be the first time two teams who met in a CIF Championship Football Final had a rematch in the opening game of the following season.\n\nCurrently, the CIF has set up one weekend of games (April 17) after section championships in order to presumably play regional title games, but not for state championships. That would eliminate the possibility of De La Salle and Bosco playing later in the season.

The fight started off well for Pico as he dropped him with a punch at the beginning of the fight, though instead of taking it to the ground he let him back up which proved costly in the end.\n\nAfter that loss, he faced criticism for not using his high-level wrestling enough in the fight and many believed he would have won the fight had he chose to use it more. After that fight, he was matched up against Adam Borics where he would lose in the second round. After not using wrestling at all in his previous fight, he seemed to use the wrestling too much which became a disadvantage and led to a TKO loss in the second round.

Although it may seem logical to wait until the start of 2021 to begin the new season, the NBA is still a business and the longer they wait is the more money they lose. So far it is widely known that the league plans on restarting between December 22nd and December 25th.\n\nAlthough it has not been said directly by big name players in the league, there is certainly a very big possibility that players such as LeBron James may sit out for the first month of play.\n\nMany players and fans alike believe that merely two and a half months break in between the conclusion of the season and the beginning of a new season is too little of time to give the players for rest and preparedness.\n\nTeams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat especially will need extended periods of time to prepare for the new season as they were the last two teams participating in the playoffs as they were competing for the championship.
