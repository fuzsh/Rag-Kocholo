        "text": "brew quote of the week for me last week was from Tony Blair: \"After 14 pints,\n\nhe does look like a Prime Minister...\"\n\n****\n\nUK Tory chief's penchant for pint in the spotlight\n\nLONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The drinking habits of William Hague, leader of\n\nBritain's main opposition Conservative Party, were back in the headlines on\n\nSaturday with reports of rum and sherry binges during his student days.\n\nAlready ridiculed for boasting last month that he often downed 14 pints of beer\n\nat a time as a teenager, a new television documentary about the 39-year-old to\n\nbe shown on Sunday evening could increase his embarrassment.\n\n``Enough to make you sick,'' wrote the Mirror tabloid, a regular Tory critic,\n\nas it reported on Hague's reference in the documentary to drinking 32 rum and\n\nblackcurrant cocktails on his 18th birthday.\n\nThe Times broadsheet said the future Tory leader was banned from being\n\nreturning officer for Oxford University Conservative Association after being\n\nfound guilty of ``incompetence and blatant irresponsibility'' in his conduct of\n\nelections.\n\nIt added that minutes of Oxford Union committee meetings during Hague's term as\n\npresident in 1981 showed how he was urged to economise on his expenses, ``in\n\nparticular a reduction of sherry consumption.''\n\nIt was all a part of what the Times called Hague's desire to hide his\n\nhigh-flying intellectual record and fit in as ``one of the lads.''\n\nBut it was not all about booze.\n\nThe Daily Mail focused on what it called a ``vicious'' attack by Hague during\n\nthe documentary on Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\n``He's too snobbish to speak to his chauffeur,'' Hague is quoted as saying.\n\n``He's not stupid, he's just deceitful.''\n\nAnother theme to emerge in Channel 4's ``Just William...And Ffion'' is the\n\ninfluence of Hague's wife, Ffion.\n\nThe fly-on-the-wall programme is designed to coincide with the Conservative\n\nParty's annual conference next week.\n\nOktoberfest's Elitism Criticized\n\n.c The Associated Press By BURT HERMAN, 9-20-00\n\nMUNICH, Germany (AP) - Bouncers wielding walkie-talkies with lists of VIPs,\n\ndeciding who's in and who's out, certainly aren't unusual at hip venues.\n\nOnly these bouncers aren't guarding the velvet-rope frontier of a New York\n\nnightclub. They're wearing Lederhosen and patrolling the festive tents of\n\nOktoberfest, where the right to drink beer, dance on the table and roar out an\n\node to the frothy stuff has been a sacred rite for nearly two centuries.\n\nBut increasingly, it's become invitation-only - to the chagrin of Munich city\n\nleaders and Oktoberfest organizers who are vowing steps to prevent the\n\nworld-famous Volksfest from turning into a VIPfest.\n\nThey complain that events staged by record companies to promote musicians, or\n\nshows featuring ladies doffing their Dirndl dresses, are threatening the core\n\nof a tradition dating to 1810.\n\n``We don't want to have the Oktoberfest become a show-biz event. We are not Las\n\nVegas, we are not Woodstock, we are not a mega-disco,'' says Gabriele\n\nWeishaeupl, Oktoberfest's general manager, herself the picture of tradition in\n\na smocked green Dirndl. ``We want a traditional Bavarian Volksfest.''\n\nIn a way, Oktoberfest has become a victim of its own popularity. By the time\n\nthe 167th Oktoberfest ends on Tuesday, more than 6.5 million people will have\n\npassed through the blue-and-white gates marking the entrance to ``Wiesn,'' the\n\nBavarian word for field. And they'll have chugged down 5 million of the massive\n\nliter-sized beer mugs.\n\nBut don't expect to just walk into the popular Hippodrom or Kaefer tents.\n\nTables are booked months in advance, many by companies in large blocks. And the\n\nnon-reserved sections in the middle of the tents are already filled by\n\nafternoon. Beer hall owners then simply shut the doors to new arrivals.\n\nWhile only a handful of the Wiesn's 14 tents are violating the Oktoberfest\n\nspirit, Weishaeupl says she will sit down with all the tent owners after the\n\n18-day festival ends for a serious talk. City lawmakers have already called for\n\nthe tents to set aside more unreserved tables.\n\nThe clash with tradition reached a head last year after a performer at the\n\nHippodrom dropped her Dirndl, flashing her breasts for the crowd. Mayor\n\nChristian Ude derided the spectacle as a striptease - and took issue when the\n\nHippodrom started issuing VIP bracelets to allow unlimited access for a select\n\nfew, a sort of season's pass.\n\nHippodrom owner Sepp Kratz abandoned the bracelets under pressure and says he\n\nregrets the flashing incident last year. But he and other owners defend their\n\nattempts to regulate admission as a step against overcrowding.\n\n``I am sorry that it happened - such things don't belong to Wiesn,'' Kratz\n\nsaid. Still, he insisted, ``we are caring for Bavarian tradition.''\n\nStanding in the Hippodrom tent, Johann Niedermeyer of Munich can't remember\n\never missing an Oktoberfest in all his 63 years.\n\n``It used to be cozier, not such a huge event,'' Niedermeyer says, wearing a\n\nwell-worn pair of Lederhosen.\n\nOn stage, a performer with the stage name Antonia from Tirolia performs a song\n\nin a short-short dress, then jumps up and down, threatening to free her bosom\n\nfrom its fabric confinement.\n\n``There weren't such things in the past,'' Niedermeyer says as he claps along.\n\n``But I like these things too.''\n\nLater in the evening, Susanne Tusche from the nearby town of Memmingen stood\n\noutside the Hippodrom tent, already off-limits to non-ticket holders, viewing\n\nthe revelers swaying merrily to the music through a window.\n\n``This has no Volksfest atmosphere when you stand here before closed doors,''\n\nshe said.\n\nBut her mood changed when a friend came out carrying the all-important\n\nreservation bracelets, and suddenly she was on her way to grasp yet another\n\nbeer mug between her hands.\n\n``See, it's all who you know,'' she said.\n\nFrance 2000 malt barley crop quality uneven\n\nPARIS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The quality of France's malting barley crop is more\n\npatchy than last year, but it should match user specifications, French malt\n\nproducers said in a report due to be published next week.\n\nThe report said the crop was mostly healthy, despite wet harvesting conditions,\n\nwith decent calibration levels and a more adequate average protein content at\n\n10.8 percent, compared with 11.3 percent in 1999.\n\n\"The year 2000 is again a good year for French malting barley,\" the French\n\nmaltsters association Malteurs de France said in the report, obtained by\n\nReuters ahead of release.\n\nFor six-row winter barley varieties, 80 percent were successfully calibrated\n\nfor malting industry use this year, down from 85 percent in 1999, said the\n\nreport, compiled with the French Institute of Brewing and Malting (IFBM).\n\nOf the six-row spring varieties, 90 percent passed the tests, designed to\n\nfilter out inadequate grains. This was stable from 1999.\n\nMaltsters can only obtain good germination levels if the size of the grains is\n\nhomogeneous. They usually require a calibration level of at least 90 percent.\n\nThe average protein level for the six-row winter barley variety \"Esterel\" was\n\n10.5 percent, the level sought by maltsters and stable from last year.\n\nNo region reported protein levels below 10 percent, and only the east and north\n\nregistered levels above 11 percent.\n\nHowever, protein levels were more variable for two-row winter barley varieties,\n\nranging from 10.1 percent in the Berry, Beauce and Gatinais regions to 11.7\n\npercent in Champagne and in the east, versus an average of 11.3 percent in\n\n1999.\n\nTwo-row spring barley varieties presented average protein levels of 10.5\n\npercent, up from 10 percent the previous year. In order to make pure malt beer,\n\nproducers usually require protein levels of 10-11 percent. Excess protein can\n\nhamper the germination of the barley and make beer cloudy in the long term.\n\nThe report added harvesting of this year's crop was spread out, due to\n\nunseasonal storms in late July and early August, but most of the barley was cut\n\nin dry conditions with humidity always below 15 percent.\n\nDiageo's Keenan earns million-pound bonus\n\nLONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - One of Diageo's top directors Jack Keenan earned a\n\none million pound-plus bonus last year which boosted his total salary to over\n\ntwo million pounds ($2.94 million), the group's annual report showed on Friday.\n\nKeenan, 62, now deputy chief executive of Diageo's main operating unit Guinness\n\nUDV, was rewarded with the bonus despite a dismal reward for shareholders who\n\nhave seen Diageo shares little moved since the group's formation in December\n\n1997.\n\nHis bonus of 1.1 million pounds reflected the performance of his Johnnie Walker\n\nwhisky and Smirnoff vodka UDV unit over the past 2-3 years. He became deputy\n\nchief executive of Guinness UDV after the merger of its beer and spirits units\n\nin July.\n\nAs a U.S. national, he received other benefits of 429,000 pounds from high\n\npension contributions for an ex-patriot and overseas allowances, and a basis\n\nsalary of 556,000 pounds bringing his total annual pay package to 2.1 million.\n\nThis tops the group's pay scales with the next best rewarded being new Chief\n\nExecutive Paul Walsh on 1.5 million pounds.\n\nDiageo shares closed at 604-1/2 pence on Friday compared with 583p in December\n\n1997 when the group was formed from the merger of Guinness and GrandMet.\n\nGordon Biersch Brewery Restaurants to Expand Into Canada With Fusion ITM\n\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Sept. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant\n\nGroup, Inc. has entered into a 14 unit licensing arrangement with Fusion ITM,\n\nInc. for the Canadian territory Ontario and eastward.

The deal was cleared by UK competition authorities but blocked by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n32 PERCENT MARKET SHARE\n\n``That deal was approved, so I don't see why this deal will not,'' he said,\n\npointing out that a 32 percent share was not that different from S&N's 28\n\npercent and it had a large chain of almost 2,700 pubs.\n\nHe declined to comment on measures the company may have to take to clear the\n\ndeal like brand sell-offs or diluting its five year supply contracts with Bass\n\nand Whitbread pubs ahead of a presentation to the Commission in mid-October.\n\nMerging Bass's and Whitbread's beer businesses should give annual synergies of\n\n90-100 million pounds a year and bring the price of the deal down to 6.5 times\n\ncurrent year earnings before tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from\n\nthe actual price multiple of 8.5 times for the two deals, he said.\n\nIn all the countries of western Europe, except Germany, the leading brewer has\n\na market share of 40-70 percent. ``Why is 32 percent so delicate? It is not\n\nsignificantly different from S&N's and they have vertical integration,'' said\n\nPowell.\n\nHe argued that over the last 10 years, the real retail price of beer has risen\n\n30 percent while the brewers' wholesale price has slipped 10 percent, and the\n\nreal power had passed to the independent pub companies. Bass, the most\n\nefficient UK brewer, makes four pence profit on the pint of beer selling at\n\n2.04 pounds a pint, and Whitbread makes only two pence a pint.\n\nPowell said that group's initial public offering (IPO) was still on track for\n\nlater this year, but the final timing, amount and where the stock would be\n\nlisted had still to be agreed.\n\nHe added that the group had outperformed the world's top 15 brewers in terms of\n\nsales growth, EBITDA earnings and after tax profits over the past six years and\n\nshould start trading at the top of the range of world brewing shares.\n\nGlobal beer companies are trading in a range of EBITDA multiples of between six\n\nand 12, and he saw Interbrew trading at the top along with the world's first\n\nand third biggest brewers Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc and Heineken NV.\n\nNigerian index down, investors sell brewers\n\nLAGOS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Nigerian stocks for the fifth consecutive session\n\nended with losses after investors sold blue chip brewery stocks, dealers said.\n\nThe All-Share Index declined 38.72 points to 7298.88 from 7337.60 on Thursday.\n\nFallers outpaced gainers by 21 to 16.\n\nUniversal Trust Bank sold 5.5 million shares in 20 deals to raise the volume to\n\n13.4 million shares worth 82.85 million naira ($810,269) traded in 1,079 deals,\n\nup from 8.5 million shares valued at 66 million naira ($645,477) in 1346 deals.\n\nGuinness Nigeria lost 4.5 percent to close at 31.50 naira.\n\n``Investors have run out of patience waiting for Guinness to release its\n\nfull-year result,'' a dealer said.\n\nNigerian Breweries lost another 2.2 percent of its recent gains to\n\nprofit-takers to finish at 22.00 naira.\n\nThe banking sector recovered from Thursday's bearish session with Union Bank\n\nadvancing 1.9 percent to end at 20.99 naira and First Bank Nigeria adding 0.1\n\npercent to 15.52 naira.\n\nBut United Bank for Africa slumped 3.9 percent to 12.45 naira and Afribank\n\nclosed 4.9 percent weaker at 65.81 naira.\n\nOil marketer Agip Nigeria dropped five percent of its recent gains to close at\n\n18.05 naira.\n\nTexaco Nigeria jumped the maximum five percent to 49.34 naira after it\n\nannounced a 2.50 naira interim dividend to shareholders on Friday.\n\nTotal Nigeria added 3.6 percent to finish at 57.00 naira.\n\nFood and beverage manfacturer Nestle Nigeria Plc notched up 4.8 percent to\n\n39.50 naira but sector rival Cadbury Nigeria shed 3.1 percent to 16.00 naira.\n\nOrkla Jan-Aug pre-tax profits triple\n\nOSLO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Norwegian conglomerate Orkla announced on Thursday a\n\ntripling in pre-tax profits for the first eight months of 2000, bolstered by\n\nportfolio gains and a lasting growth in earnings for chemicals operations.\n\nThe company, whose businesses also include drinks and newspapers, said pre-tax\n\nprofits for the period surged to 4.77 billion crowns ($525.3 million) from 1.56\n\nbillion.\n\nOperating profits rose to 1.72 billion crowns from 1.41 billion, while net\n\nprofits climbed to 3.58 billion from 1.20 billion crowns.\n\n``The profit reflects higher-than-usual portfolio sales gains, while the\n\nindustry area also posted a significant improvement,'' Orkla said in statement.\n\nPortfolio gains, partly from a sale of shares in telecoms firm NetCom, surged\n\nto 3.05 billion crowns compared with 342 million crowns in the year-earlier\n\nperiod. The return on Orkla's portfolio for the first eight months was 9.6\n\npercent, it said.\n\nOrkla's business interests include chemicals, foods, drinks, brands and media,\n\nof which chemicals posted the sharpest rise in operating profits to 267 million\n\ncrowns, or about double the 138 million made in the same period a year ago.\n\nResults slightly outperformed the consensus of market forecasts garnered in a\n\nReuters poll of 10 analysts pointing to pre-tax profits of 4.51 billion crowns\n\nand net profits of 3.21 billion.\n\nOrkla shares opened up 0.5 crowns at 177.5 at 0800 GMT.\n\nAnalysts had expected to see the biggest improvement from Orkla's chemicals\n\noperations, while the drinks unit had been seen weaker due to cool summer\n\nweather in the Nordic region.\n\nSTRONG DRINKS, CHEMICALS\n\nBut Orkla said strong sales in Russia and Ukraine through its 50 percent owned\n\nBaltic Beverages Holding (BHH), jointly owner with Finnish, boosted drinks.\n\n``Volume growth in Russia and Ukraine contributed to a substantial increase in\n\nturnover at BHH, while turnover in the Nordic region is at last year's level\n\ndespite a colder summer and lower volumes,'' it said.\n\nDrinks saw operating profits rise to 596 million crowns compared with 384\n\nmillion.\n\nOrkla in May sealed a deal with Danish brewer Carlsberg to form a joint brewery\n\nto be owned 60-40 by Carlsberg and Orkla. The deal is under evaluation by\n\nrespective authorities.\n\nFor chemicals, Orkla said: ``Most profit areas showed improved results compared\n\nwith last year.

Distributing Co. claims that Stroh and Pabst Brewing Co.\n\nimproperly transferred those distribution rights to Brown Deer-based\n\nBeloit Beverage Co. in May 1999.\n\nPabst bought most of Stroh's brands at that time, and Stroh is no longer\n\nin business. The brands sold by Detroit-based Stroh to San Antonio-based\n\nPabst included Schlitz and Old Milwaukee.\n\nAccording to the suit, filed in Waukesha County Circuit Court, Stroh\n\ntold W.O.W. that it wanted Milwaukee-based Beer Capitol Distributing Co.\n\nto take over distribution of Stroh brands in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nAs a result, W.O.W. negotiated an agreement with Beer Capitol to buy\n\nthose rights. However, Stroh instead awarded the distribution rights to\n\nBeloit Beverage, the suit said.\n\nW.O.W. claims those actions amounted to a breach of its contract with\n\nStroh, and harmed W.O.W.'s business.\n\nIn response, Brian Morello, Beloit Beverage president, said he didn't\n\nunderstand why his company was sued. Morello said Beloit Beverage was\n\nawarded the distribution rights over a year ago and said he had no\n\ninkling that a lawsuit was in the works.\n\nSpokesmen for Pabst and Stroh couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nhttp://www.afr.com.au:80/investment/20000929/A23744-2000Sep29.html\n\nSan Miguel set to take James Boag to Asia, US\n\nBy Simon Evans, Saturday, September 30, 2000\n\nPhilippines brewing giant San Miguel Corp is poised to begin an Asian\n\nforay with the James Boag brand before Christmas, and to then take the\n\nfast-growing beer to the United States next year.\n\nSan Miguel, which assumed control of the historic Tasmanian brewery in\n\nlate May after a $92 million takeover, has appointed three of its senior\n\nexecutives to the JBoag & Son board as it accelerates expansion plans.\n\nJBoag's director of sales and marketing, Mr Lyndon Adams, said on Friday\n\nthe operational aspects of the brewery in Launceston had been largely\n\nuntouched by San Miguel, but offshore expansion plans for the flagship\n\nbrand were gaining momentum.\n\n\"Hong Kong will start this side of Christmas,\" Mr Adams said.\n\nSan Miguel then plans to take the brand to the Singapore market early\n\nnext year, with the US also earmarked as an export destination in 2001.\n\nThe brand will be pushed through San Miguel's distribution channels in\n\nAsia, with the aim of capitalising on the strong growth of premium beer\n\nbrands across the globe.\n\nMr Adams said San Miguel was also working on a strategy to increase the\n\nclout of its own brand in Australia.\n\n\"It's certainly a long-term plan and strategy to increase the exposure\n\nof the San Miguel brand,\" he said.\n\nThe premium beer market in Australia is growing at more than 20 per cent\n\na year as drinkers trade up to higher-priced brands with a more\n\nsophisticated image.\n\nThe premium market leader in Australia is Foster's Brewing Group's Crown\n\nLager, while Lion Nathan's flagship is Hahn Premium.\n\nFoster's Carlton & United Breweries division and Lion Nathan are engaged\n\nin fierce competition in the mainstream beer sector. Lion Nathan has\n\nmade inroads this year, pushing CUB's market share down by about 0.5 per\n\ncent to just below 55.5 per cent.\n\nFoster's chief executive, Mr Ted Kunkel, warned in the company's annual\n\nreport released recently that it had reduced growth forecasts for the\n\nCUB business because total beer volumes were growing by only about 1 per\n\ncent each year.\n\nBut premium beer is not experiencing the flat market that mainstream\n\nproducts such as Foster's Victoria Bitter and Lion Nathan's Tooheys are\n\nbattling.\n\nMarket analysts estimate premium beer could approach 10 per cent of\n\ntotal beer sales in the months leading up to Christmas, compared with 6\n\nto 7 per cent a year earlier.\n\nMr Adams said sales of James Boag's Premium Lager were growing strongly\n\nand were on target to reach 1 million cases this year.\n\nSales were 70 to 80 per cent higher than the same time last year, he\n\nsaid.\n\nThe Launceston brewery, which employs about 130 people, could easily be\n\nexpanded because it operated on a single shift structure, Mr Adams said,\n\nwith double shifts being introduced for the busy periods such as the\n\nlead-up to Christmas.\n\nAnalysts say it is unlikely that San Miguel, a $5 billion company and\n\nthe third-largest brewer in Asia, would tackle the mainstream beer\n\nmarket in Australia, preferring to concentrate on the high-growth\n\npremium end.\n\n\"Mainstream beer is a mature market and the growth prospects aren't that\n\ngood,\" one analyst said.\n\nSan Miguel executive Mr Genaro Lapez, who has since joined the JBoag\n\nboard, told The Australian Financial Review in June that Japan and Korea\n\nwere likely countries for expansion of the James Boag brand.\n\nAsian investment in Australian brewers is significant, as Lion Nathan is\n\n46 per cent owned by Japanese brewer Kirin.\n\nhttp://www.bergen.com:80/food/beer27200009275.htm\n\nBelgian chef says it's time to cook\n\nWednesday, September 27, 2000\n\nI recently attended a seminar in Manhattan on cooking with beer. Belgian\n\nchef Herwig Van Hove, a well-known author and television personality in\n\nhis home country, is spearheading a major food and beer campaign by\n\nBelgian brewing combine Interbrew.\n\nInterbrew, which owns Labatt's and Bass, has been pushing forward in the\n\nUnited States with its Belgian portfolio, including the refreshing dry\n\nlager, Stella Artois; the spicy white beer, Hoegaarden; the well-rounded\n\nabbey-style Leffe Blond (\"the gentle giant,\" according to Van Hove); the\n\ndarker and sweeter Leffe Brune (Brown); and a selection of lambic fruit\n\nbeers from the Bellevue brewery. All are world class, with or without\n\nfood.\n\nSpurring the campaign in Europe and the United States is the sudden\n\npopularity of beer cuisine. Van Hove says that compared with wine, beer\n\nis reasonably priced, accessible, and approachable. \"In brasseries,\n\nwhere the cooking style and the ambience evoke the warmth and rich\n\naromas of Mum's kitchen, beer is at home much more so than a complicated\n\nwine,\" the chef said. \"And while a good wine may complement a typical\n\nFrench meal, with its subtle sour, sweet, or smoky flavors, hearty\n\nBelgian fare calls out for more.\"\n\nVan Hove tantalized us with some great food and beer pairings: shrimp\n\ncroquettes with Hoegaarden, and salade liegoise, a tangy salad of fresh\n\ngreen beans, sliced potato, and crisp bacon, with Leffe Blond. Brabant\n\nchicken was roasted with one beer, Hoegaarden, and served with another,\n\nLeffe Blond. Smoky-sweet meatballs were a delicious foil for the\n\nsmoky-sweet Leffe Brune, while the crisp Stella Artois was a perfect\n\nmatch for a terrine of chicken, rabbit, and veal. The chef also\n\naddressed the American phobia about raw meat with a tartare, also paired\n\nwith Stella Artois.\n\nhttp://www.dailystar.com.lb:80/business/28_09_00_d.htm\n\nAlmaza and Laziza seek out new drinkers for new products\n\nLin Noueihed Daily Star staff, 28/09/00\n\nAlmaza and Laziza have spent the summer trying to pull more beer sales\n\nout of Lebanon’s small, recession-hit market. Their method? Brew new\n\nproducts and back them up with heavy marketing campaigns aimed at new\n\ndrinkers.\n\nThe two companies say this strategy is letting them tap into new niches\n\nrather than gaining market share at the expense of each other.\n\nLaziza owner Joe Khawam claims that his firm is close to recapturing a\n\n35 percent share of the non-returnable bottled beer market – his target\n\nfor 2000 and the share the brand controlled at its prewar peak. Laziza\n\nreentered the Lebanese market in May 1999 after a decade away.\n\nMarket leader and major rival Almaza also says that business is getting\n\nbetter. Bernarde Jabre, assistant general manager at Almaza, claims that\n\nhis beer has lost nothing to Laziza.\n\n“Our market share fell slightly when Laziza was first launched, because\n\npeople were still trying it out,” said Jabre, whose family established\n\nthe Almaza brewery in Dora in 1933. “But now it has recovered, and we\n\nare doing better than we were last year.”\n\nLaziza introduced its Light and Strong beers to the Lebanese market\n\nthree months ago, and Khawam says he has sold between 150,000 and\n\n200,000 cases of the new brands here.\n\nLaziza’s marketing push last year allowed the company to reintroduce a\n\nbrand that had been missing since the civil war, and whose quality had\n\nbecome inconsistent just before it disappeared.\n\nAnd the company says its provocative advertising campaign for Light and\n\nStrong beers this summer has attracted new drinkers. Khawam spent $1.5\n\nmillion on the product launch, including advertising, dwarfing other\n\nbeers’ budgets.\n\nKhawam added that the Light and Strong brands have had much less effect\n\non the sales of the original brew than he had expected, because they\n\nappeal to niche markets.\n\nLaziza Light appeared in June to appeal to women who were watching their\n\nweight during summer, the traditional peak season for beer sales. Giving\n\nwomen the option of a 75-calorie, 2.5-percent alcohol beer has attracted\n\ncustomers who previously didn’t drink beer at all, Khawam said.\n\nKhawam aimed Laziza Strong, which has 8 percent alcohol, at men used to\n\ndrinking hard liquor but tempted by something cooler for summer. Again,\n\nthe introduction of this beer has lured consumers who would not normally\n\norder a beer at the pub, he said.\n\nJabre wouldn’t say whether Almaza was planning to introduce its own\n\nlight and strong versions. The company did introduce a non-alcoholic\n\nbeer called Malta about nine months ago, which comes in apple and\n\nraspberry flavors. “It’s still a baby, but it’s doing well,” said Jabre.\n\nMalta is also available in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nKhawam claims that non-alcoholic Laziza, introduced alongside the\n\noriginal brew in spring 1999, contributed to the development of the\n\nsmall non-alcoholic segment in Lebanon.\n\nKhawam said that non-alcoholic beer constitutes between 15 and 20\n\npercent of Laziza’s total sales in Lebanon. Laziza, which is brewed by\n\nBavaria in the Netherlands, is available in 17 countries, mostly Arab,\n\nand non-alcoholic beer accounts for 45 percent of the company’s total\n\nworldwide sales. Khawam claims that non-alcoholic beer makes up 15\n\npercent of the market in Lebanon.\n\nJabre disagrees. “The market for non-alcoholic beer in Lebanon is very\n\nsmall, as it’s everywhere where regular beer is available.” He also says\n\nit is too early to estimate the size of the market let alone brand\n\nshares, because it is “such a new niche.” Still, he admits that the\n\nmarket is growing, claiming that in some Muslim areas, sales of Malta\n\nrival, or even surpass, those of Almaza.\n\nThe introduction of Malta, the only Lebanese-made flavored malt drink\n\navailable, has been more low key despite. Imported flavored Holsten is\n\nthe only other product that resembles Malta, according to Jabre.\n\nhttp://www.sltrib.com:80/09282000/utah/27580.htm\n\nRomney Calls for Dry Medals Plaza\n\nThursday, September 28, 2000 BY LINDA FANTIN , THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE\n\nSYDNEY, Australia -- The boss of Salt Lake City's Olympics wants to\n\nmake the premier party site of the 2002 Winter Games an alcohol-free\n\nzone, putting him at odds with the city's mayor.\n\nThe medals plaza near the Delta Center will attract a lot of kids,\n\nsaid Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney, and it would\n\nbe inappropriate to promote or sell beer or any other alcohol in the\n\nvicinity.\n\nThe policy has nothing to do with The Church of Jesus Christ of\n\nLatter-day Saints -- owner of the medals plaza property -- its\n\nanti-alcohol teachings or his personal beliefs as a church member,\n\nRomney said.\n\n\"Alcohol and caffeine are something Mormons and people of conscience\n\nshould avoid, but that is not something I would seek to impose on anyone\n\nelse,\"\n\nRomney told The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\n\"This is not related to the Mormon church but an appropriate concern\n\nfor the youth generally.\"\n\nEven so, the LDS Church likes the idea of an alcohol ban.\n\n\"We commend Mitt Romney's principled stand on eliminating alcohol\n\nfrom the medals plaza,\" the church told The Tribune on Wednesday\n\nafternoon. \"There are plenty of other locations where alcoholic\n\nbeverages are likely to be available.\"\n\nBut Romney's comments are stirring up a brouhaha Down Under. Salt\n\nLake City Mayor Rocky Anderson, who arrived in Sydney on Monday, said\n\nthere should be \"as few restrictions as possible to allow the people [in\n\nSalt Lake City] to have as good a time as people are having here.\"\n\nHe said that when Salt Lake City bid for the Games, its residents\n\nunderstood that Olympic revelers expect more than a Coke and a smile.\n\n\"All around the world people are used to being able to have a beer or\n\na drink when they are out partying, and this is supposed to be a big\n\nparty,\" Anderson said Wednesday.\n\n\"The fact that people have a beer now and then doesn't mean they are\n\ngoing to get out of hand.\"\n\nRecognizing the issue could divide the community, Anderson plans to\n\n\"meet with some folks\" to sort it all out as soon as he returns from\n\nSydney.\n\nSLOC's plan is to stage concerts and other festivities at the plaza\n\nduring the day and award athletes their medals at night. SLOC decides\n\nwhether to allow alcohol at venues, and Romney said his alcohol\n\nrestrictions would not apply to the nearby Delta Center, site of the\n\n2002 figure skating and short-track speed-skating competitions.\n\nBut the city has the power to grant other entities special-use\n\npermits for beer tents located \"outside the fence.\"\n\nThat creates a potential problem for Anheuser-Busch. Because the\n\ncompany paid more than $50 million to make Budweiser the official beer\n\nof the 2002 Games, it would probably object to vendors selling other\n\nbrands of brew near venues.\n\nSome Utahns have questioned the appropriateness of even having a beer\n\nsponsor. Romney, however, defended the arrangement.\n\n\"I would not want to sell a product or advertise a product or link a\n\nproduct with the Games if I considered it to be morally wrong,\" Romney\n\nsaid.\n\nOther Utah communities are also grappling with the thorny issue of\n\nalcohol sales during the Olympics.\n\nIn Provo, where The Peaks Ice Arena will be host to Olympic hockey,\n\nthree City Council members were ready to block any attempt to serve beer\n\nwhen Mayor Lewis Billings' administration decided a permit could be\n\ngranted without a council vote. The issue continues to be hotly debated\n\neven though it appears that beer will flow in 2002 at The Peaks if SLOC\n\napplies for the necessary permit.\n\nMembers of the Salt Lake City Council are divided over medals plaza\n\nbeer sales.\n\n\"I applaud [Romney's] decision from the standpoint it may not be a\n\npopular decision,\" said council Chairman Carlton Christensen. \"I tend to\n\nagree there will be a lot of children there. Clearly there will be\n\nalcohol-consumption possibilities elsewhere.\"\n\nBut Councilmen Keith Christensen and Tom Rogan say beer should be\n\navailable.\n\n\"It is in everyone's best interest to keep [the medals plaza] a\n\nneutral playing ground and to make it available for those who regrettably\n\nchoose,\"\n\nsaid Keith Christensen.\n\nAdded Rogan: \"I don't know why that venue would be any more\n\n'youthful' than others, other than perhaps [events there are] free and\n\nthere is some hope families will be attending. Beer is sold just across\n\ntown at the Gallivan Center.\n\n\"It is not an issue I would go to war over. I don't know what the\n\npoint of it all is. If they are going to have other refreshments, why\n\nshouldn't people have the choice of having 3.2 [percent alcohol] beer,\n\nwhich is all it is.\"\n\nEven Sydney, where the legal drinking age is 18 and alcohol is\n\nanything but taboo, is establishing one alcohol-free zone for its\n\nclosing ceremony. During the opening ceremony rowdy partyers ruled a few\n\nof the city's six Olympic Live! sites as well as the surrounding blocks\n\nwhere crowds had gathered to watch the opening ceremony on giant\n\ntelevisions.\n\nAnderson said a little libation doesn't seem to have harmed\n\nAustralians.\n\n\"There are plenty of impressionable youth in Sydney. I haven't seen\n\nany of them damaged by the availability of alcohol,\" he said. \"People\n\nare extraordinarily well-behaved.\"\n\nReporters attending SLOC's 500-day countdown announcement took the\n\nopportunity to quiz Anderson about Utah's conservative liquor laws. He\n\ninsisted his city has a good night life that will only get better during\n\nthe Winter Games.\n\n\"There's a perception that it's impossible to get a drink in Salt\n\nLake City. But once you get the hang of it, it's easy to find,\" he said.\n\n\"We've come a long way in the last 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nIn fact, Anderson is planning to entertain Olympic officials at City\n\nHall during the Games, and he has no intention of hosting a dry bash.\n\n\"We'd better have alcohol, or there will be anexplosion,\" he said.\n\nhttp://www.courierpress.com:80/cgi-bin/view.cgi?200009/28+brewin092800_fea\n\ntures.html+20000928\n\nFun’s brewin’ at the museum\n\nBeer will be back on tap at the Evansville Museum Saturday night, this\n\ntime with bratwurst and sauerkraut.

Americans in particular are knocking back more and\n\nmore of it, enticed by novel flavours ranging from subtle mandarin to\n\nthroat-clutching hot chilli pepper.\n\nBut V&S's global Absolut distributor, Canadian group Seagram, is putting its\n\ndrinks business up for sale as part of its merger with France's Vivendi.\n\nBritain's Diageo Plc and France's Pernod-Ricard are keen joint bidders.\n\nThough a servant of the same country that only narrowly voted against complete\n\nalcohol prohibition in a 1923 referendum, V&S vows to guard its boozy\n\ninterests.\n\nAn unlikely-looking alcohol multinational, it is taking an increasingly\n\naggressive stance, with recent acquisitions in Britain and the Czech Republic,\n\nand defends its brands vehemently in the courts.\n\nIndustry analysts say V&S looks unlikely to sell Absolut and may hold the trump\n\ncard in the Seagram talks, in the form of a clause in its contract saying the\n\ndistribution rights could be revoked if Seagram were sold.\n\nTalk of a joint bid by V&S for the Seagram unit with British drinks group\n\nAllied Domecq Plc has circulated among analysts and in newspaper reports in\n\nrecent weeks.\n\nCULTURAL SEA CHANGE\n\nFrustrated travellers scouring Stockholm in vain for a bottle of wine on a\n\nFriday night are a common sight, though wiser locals stock up during the week,\n\nand the few Systembolaget stores that now open on Saturdays do a roaring trade.\n\nSwedes once shared a taste for hard drinking with other northern ``vodka belt''\n\nstates, until the backlash Temperance movement gained strength in the early\n\n1900s.\n\nTemperance remains strong even in the 21st century -- though that looks set to\n\nchange, with well-travelled youngsters clamouring ever more loudly for a more\n\nrelaxed attitude to drink.\n\n``It's a reaction to the internationalisation that's affecting everyone,''\n\nHealth and Social Affairs Ministry Deputy Director Gert Knutsson told Reuters\n\nin an interview.\n\n``Now people don't just rely on what the authorities say. They must understand\n\nwhy.''\n\nSweden will cut drink taxes to European levels by 2004, with a first reduction\n\nnext year, Knutsson said.\n\n``Of course some groups will object. There is still a strong temperance\n\nmovement who will of course be screaming loudly, and some political parties\n\nwill object. But most people see it as a necessary step,'' he said.\n\nBRUSSELS FORCES SWEDEN'S HAND\n\nIn reality, Sweden has little choice. It secured a temporary agreement when it\n\njoined the EU in 1995 to prevent Swedes privately importing large quantities of\n\nbooze from countries to the south where it is cheaper.\n\nWhen that expired in June, the European Commission made Stockholm promise to\n\nquadruple the maximum import level for beer and almost triple it for wine and\n\nspirits by end-2003.\n\nSo unless it cuts taxes, more and more Swedes will either buy abroad or through\n\nan already flourishing black market, which the Alcohol and Drug Information\n\nCouncil estimates already supplies a quarter of Sweden's drink.\n\nOpponents of tax cuts point out Sweden has Europe's lowest drink-related\n\nillness rate, citing statistical evidence that death rates have closely tracked\n\nalcohol sales fluctuations through the years.\n\nThe National Institute of Public Health says cutting taxes to the level of\n\nneighbouring Denmark would kill between 500 and 1,000 more people a year\n\nthrough diseases such as cirrhosis. It says with such low consumption, Swedes\n\nwould be particularly vulnerable to a sudden increase in the availability of\n\ndrink.\n\n``It's a balance,'' Knutsson concedes. ``If you restrict too toughly, the black\n\nmarket will grow. You have to find a point just between.''\n\nHandouts vs. Works in Brazil Race\n\n.c The Associated Press\n\nBy MICHAEL ASTOR\n\nJABORANDI, Brazil (AP) - Mayor Jose Dias da Silva thought his record would\n\nspeak for itself. Surely investments in schools and hospitals would sway voters\n\nmore than beer or food baskets at election time, he reasoned.\n\nThe problem was many residents seemed to prefer the handouts.\n\nMany here complain da Silva - known by his nickname Regente - has spent too\n\nmuch on public works and not enough on the favors and gifts that are a hallowed\n\ncampaign tradition and give the election a carnival feel.\n\nThat's where his rival, Lidio Dias, excels.\n\n``Regente did stuff for the city, he didn't do anything for the poor,'' says\n\n19-year-old Lesio Villas Boas da Franca, who wore a Dias T-shirt.\n\n``Unfortunately the people around here are a bit backwards,'' explains high\n\nschool principal Neusa Campos de Oliveira. ``They like a guy who gives them a\n\nslap on the back. Lidio was the kind of guy who showed up at a bar and picked\n\nup the tab for everybody. A lot of people owe him.''\n\nThe campaign ahead of Sunday's municipal election in this town of 10,000 people\n\nhighlights the obstacles to rooting out the patronage and cronyism ingrained in\n\nBrazilian politics.\n\nDias, an old-school politician and da Silva's uncle, was mayor until 1996. When\n\nhis term ended, he used his popularity and influence to help elect his cool,\n\nbusinesslike nephew.\n\nDa Silva, who attended veterinary school and served in the army, brought\n\nsomething new to Jaborandi, a poor town of mostly subsistence farmers 375 miles\n\nnortheast of Brasilia.\n\nHe went after federal funds that Dias had been unaware of or ignored and\n\nbenefitted greatly from a 1998 law that distributed government funding directly\n\nto cities instead of through state governors, who often allocated the money at\n\ntheir whimsey.\n\nUnder da Silva, the town's annual budget jumped from $47,000 to $1.9 million.\n\nHe invested heavily in health, education and a sewage system that keeps the\n\nlocal river clean - something practically unheard of in Brazil's poor\n\nNortheast.\n\n``Governing is the easiest thing in the world, you just have to want to,'' said\n\nthe tall, stubble-chinned da Silva.\n\nDias seems genuinely stunned by the transformation.\n\n``My administration was there to help the people who suffer on the farm,'' he\n\nsaid. ``I did what I could with my small budget.''\n\nBut the all-in-the-family harmony broke down in 1997, when a Constitutional\n\namendment allowed mayors to run for reelection. Dias, who had expected to\n\ninherit the mayor's office again, suddenly faced opposition from his nephew.\n\nThe two no longer speak.\n\nDias says his nephew's administration wasn't entirely selfless. He points to da\n\nSilva's enormous house and sports utility vehicle and suggests that he also\n\nbenefited from the recent cash inflow.\n\nDias is known for distributing food baskets, a traditional election time\n\nhandout here. But he claims da Silva has upped the ante, buying votes with\n\nUNICEF funds intended to replace the unhealthy mud shacks that are home for\n\nmany residents. Instead of new houses, Dias says, the mayor offers renovations,\n\nand only to those who agree to vote for him.\n\nDa Silva denies he's doing anything wrong with the UNICEF money but admits\n\npolitical realities have forced him to engage in some of the more traditional\n\nvoting getting methods.\n\n``I do good work and I do good politics too,'' counters da Silva, known\n\npopularly as Regente. ``Buying votes exists. If a poor person is sick what are\n\nyou going to do: let them die?''\n\nStill, da Silva appears to be trailing among voters. His support is strongest\n\namong the 2,000 who live near the newly restored town square, where he has\n\ncreated government jobs and improved social services.\n\nBut the 8,000 voters on the small farms surrounding the town seem to like Dias\n\nbetter. He mixes easily with the farmers and field hands, drinking cachaca - a\n\nhomemade sugar cane liquor - and smoking corn husk cigarettes. Farmer Jose\n\nJoaquim Saraiva, 56, admits the mayor has done a lot for Jaborandi but says he\n\nstill plans to vote for Dias.\n\n``Lidio helped me a lot when he was in office,'' he says. ``If I could pay with\n\na liter of cachaca or a kilo of beans I would, but I can't. The only way I can\n\npay him is with my vote.''\n\nhttp://news.excite.com/news/r/000929/09/odd-mexico-mayor-dc\n\nMayor Accused of Bigamy, Loses JobUpdated 9:43 AM ET September 29, 2000\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The mayor of a Mexican state capital has been\n\nbooted from office by the local congress to face charges of bigamy,\n\npress reports said on Thursday.\n\nThe state congress of Veracruz on Wednesday voted to remove Raphael\n\nHernandez Villalpando, the mayor of the state capital Xalapa, from\n\noffice so he can face charges in a civil court of being married\n\nsimultaneously to two women, newspapers reported.

Similar drinks marketed in Britain in the mid-90s were called\n\n``alcopops'' by critics who said they appealed those below the legal drinking\n\nage.\n\n``This is a drink that is going to popular with kids, and a responsible\n\nmarketer of alcohol should not be marketing it,'' said James Mosher, senior\n\npolicy adviser at the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other\n\nDrug Problems, based in San Rafael, Calif.\n\nThe beverages, with about 5 percent alcohol, sport folksy names like Mike's\n\nHard Lemonade, Rick's Spiked Lemonade, Doc Otis' Hard Lemon Flavored Malt\n\nBeverage and Hooper's Hooch Lemon Brew.\n\nTheir makers note they list the alcohol content on the labels. They say they're\n\nnot aiming at youngsters but rather at adults who seek variety in beverages and\n\nmay even spike their own lemonade at home.\n\nSales of hard lemonade rose fourfold last year to 4.1 million cases worth about\n\n$90 million at retail, according to the trade publication Impact. The beverages\n\nare generally priced at $5.50 to $7 for a six-pack - on par with specialty\n\nbeers.\n\nMiller Brewing Co., whose Henry Weinhard division introduced Henry's Hard\n\nLemonade in five Pacific Northwest states last month, expects the market could\n\nreach $350 million nationally by the end of this year, spokeswomen Kary McGrath\n\nsaid.\n\nThat's about what's spilled on the bar in the $60 billion-plus beer market, but\n\nmarket watchers say the sector is worth watching given the number of people\n\nreaching the legal drinking age each year and their taste for what's new.\n\nKim McGreevey, 21, a senior at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, said she is not\n\na big fan of beer and finds hard lemonade an appealing alternative especially\n\nfor ``a younger crowd that doesn't have the money to go to a bar for a mixed\n\ndrink.''\n\nShe likes the familiarity of the taste of lemonade and says it is more reliable\n\nthan buying a wine cooler with an exotic description and a disappointing taste.\n\nMike's Hard Lemonade was the spiked lemonade sales leader for the year through\n\nmid-August at supermarkets, according to figures from Information Resources\n\nInc.\n\nMark Anthony Brands Ltd., a privately-held firm based in Vancouver, British\n\nColumbia, launched the brand in Canada in 1996 and started shipping it into New\n\nEngland early last year, said Russell Barnett, the top U.S. marketer of the\n\nMike's brand.\n\nHe said sales quickly beat expectations despite no advertising for what it\n\ncalls ``lemonade with kick.'' It is sold in clear bottles with a black label\n\nand a message etched in white handwriting.\n\n``Ask Mike what he puts into his hard lemonade and all you'll get is, 'I'm not\n\nsaying but I can tell you this: 10 lemons go into a room; only three come out.'\n\nHe's a little mysterious like that,'' the message says.\n\nThere is no real Mike behind the brand but Barnett said, ``There is some Mike\n\nin all of us. He's a fun, cool guy people want to hang around with.''\n\nThere's also no real Doc Otis behind the drink line launched in May by\n\nAnheuser-Busch Inc., the world's biggest brewer.\n\nBut the name plays a key role in its marketing - a half-dozen stories about the\n\nfictional character alternately appear on Doc Otis bottles, and consumers can\n\nwin prizes for penning their own tales. Radio spots invite consumers to\n\n``Unlock the Doc'' mystery, and TV ads are coming.\n\nThe sales push has Doc Otis gaining on Mike's, according to the IRI.\n\nSupermarket data pegged Mike's sales at about 530,000 cases through Aug. 20,\n\nwhile Doc Otis was at about 337,000 cases.\n\nAnother top seller is Rick's Spiked Lemonade, introduced in March by Canada's\n\nSeagram Beverage Co. It had sold about 164,000 cases, about 35,000 cases behind\n\nHooper's Hooch in the IRI data.\n\nRick's is backed with a Web site (www.ricksspiked.com) and radio and print\n\nadvertising in some markets, Seagram marketing executive Jamie Mattikow said.\n\n``One part innocent. One part wild'' is the theme.\n\nDon't bother to go looking for Rick - like Mike and the Doc, he doesn't exist.\n\n``It's a fun, approachable name that had broad appeal to men and women,''\n\nMattikow said.\n\nThe marketers say hard lemonade is a drink for all seasons, though Gary\n\nHemphill of the beverage research and consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corp.\n\nin New York suspects it will sell best when lemonade does.\n\n``It's a light summer drink, another alternative, but I think it will be a very\n\nseasonal product,'' he said.\n\nGeorge Hacker, who oversees alcohol policies for the Center for Science in the\n\nPublic Interest in Washington, D.C., finds spiked lemonade an unappealing\n\nconcept any time.\n\n``The whole point is to package alcohol in a familiar and appealing taste in an\n\neffort to bring new consumers to the alcoholic beverage market,'' he said.\n\n``It's unfortunate we are so cavalier about every new means of incorporating\n\nalcohol into Americans' lifestyles.''\n\nBrazil Kaiser says chief resigns, no Heineken link\n\nSAO PAULO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The president of Brazilian beer company Kaiser is\n\nstepping down but the firm said on Monday the move had nothing to do with talk\n\nHeineken NV <HEIN.AS> was planning to up its stake in the brewer.\n\nHumberto Pandolpho, who had been in charge since February 1999 on an open-ended\n\ncontract, will be replaced by local Coca Cola bottler executive and board\n\nmember Miguel Alarcon, Kaiser said in a statement.\n\nKaiser has been the centre of media reports that Dutch brewer Heineken would\n\nsoon offer to up its 14 percent stake in the brewer. Both sides say they are\n\ntalking, but say nothing has been agreed. Pandolpho's exit was not relevant,\n\nKaiser said.\n\n\"It was nothing to do with Heineken,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nPandolpho said he was resigning because the brewer would also have to think in\n\nterms of soft drinks to compete with recently merged Brazilian market leader\n\nAmBev <AMBV4.SA> which dominates the local beer and soft drink market.\n\nAlarcon had 33 years experience in Brazil's drinks market, 22 with Coca Cola\n\nbottlers which variously own a controlling 76 percent stake in Kaiser, the\n\nbrewer said.

The Commission stressed those inquires are still at early stages.\n\nUnder EU rules, the Commission has the power to fine companies up to 10 percent\n\nof their global annual sales for illegal collusion. However, in practice it has\n\nnever fined above 1 percent of annual sales, and fines are usually much lower.\n\nInterbrew, which makes the popular Stella Artois and Jupiler lagers, said in a\n\nstatement that it ``has taken actions which are incompatible with the\n\ncompetition rules of the E.,'' but has now put in place ``corrective\n\nmeasures.'' Interbrew has ``fully cooperated'' with the investigation, it said.\n\nInterbrew said that it has also been involved in the investigations in France\n\nand the Netherlands and said that it has already made financial provisions for\n\n``the conclusions of these proceedings'' as well.\n\nCompany spokesman Corneel Maes said that the alleged infringements are ``all in\n\nthe past.''\n\n``That's true that we have in the past taken in part in what is known as\n\nconcerted practices (but) we have completely taken care of this,'' he said.\n\nPernod Loses Legal Bid Over Bacardi's Havana Club Rum\n\nWashington, Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Pernod-Ricard SA, the Paris- based beverage\n\nfirm, lost a U.S. Supreme Court appeal aimed at stopping rival Bacardi Ltd.\n\nfrom selling rum in the U.S. under the Havana Club name.\n\nThe justices, without comment, refused to review a lower court's conclusion\n\nthat the U.S. embargo of Cuba bars a Pernod partnership with the Cuban\n\ngovernment from preserving U.S. rights to the Havana Club name for future use.\n\nCuba has used that brand name elsewhere around the world since the government\n\nseized the company that originally made the rum in 1960.\n\nThe dispute has sparked worldwide controversy, drawing in the World Trade\n\nOrganization as well as the U.S. court system. Several international business\n\ntrade groups -- siding with Pernod -- urged the highest U.S. court to get\n\ninvolved, saying the U.S. is bound by treaty to respect foreign trademark\n\nrights.\n\nThe dispute ``is of profound importance to the system of intellectual property\n\nprotection worldwide,'' according to a brief filed by the French National\n\nCommittee of the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLast week, the Geneva-based WTO agreed to form a panel to hear Pernod's\n\ncomplaint, which was brought on its behalf by the European Union.\n\nThe EU charges that the section of U.S. trade law under which Bacardi has taken\n\nover Pernod's registration of the Havana Club brand name is at odds with WTO\n\nintellectual-property rules.\n\nThe WTO panel is expected to take six to nine months to issue its ruling.\n\nBacardi is asserting the rights to the brand name originally owned by Jose\n\nArechabala, SA, the family-run business that sold Havana Club rum until the\n\ngovernment expropriation in 1960. Bermuda-based Bacardi hopes to enter the U.S.\n\nmarket in the next few years with its own version of Havana Club, produced in\n\nthe Bahamas. It began exporting small amounts to the U.S. in 1995.\n\nSpecific Prohibitions\n\nBacardi contends the U.S. treaty obligations ``must give way, in the case of\n\nCuba, to the specific prohibitions approved by the president and Congress.''\n\nPernod and Cuba's communist government pressed their claims through two\n\ncompanies they own jointly -- Cuba-based Havana Club International SA and\n\nLuxembourg-based Havana Club Holding SA. They sued Bacardi for trademark and\n\ntrade-name infringement and false designation of origin.\n\nThe suit contended the Inter-American Convention requires the U.S. government\n\nto treat the Pernod group no differently than a domestic company asserting\n\nrights to a product name.\n\nA New York-based federal appeals court rejected those contentions, saying,\n\namong other things, that a 1998 statute trumped the treaty commitments.\n\nThe law, targeted at Cuban trade, said companies can't cite the Inter-American\n\nConvention for trademark or trade-name protection without the permission of the\n\noriginal owner -- in this case, the Arechabala family.\n\nPernod said in a statement that the high court's refusal to hear the case\n\n``underscores the need to Congress to repeal that provision'' in the U.S. law.\n\nThe company said it's optimistic the WTO panel will rule that provision is\n\ndiscriminatory.\n\n``Today's decision does not reflect on the substance of our case,'' Mark Orr,\n\nPernod's vice president for North American affairs, said in a prepared\n\nstatement.\n\nRum Wars\n\nThe appellate panel also threw out the false-designation allegations, which\n\naccused Bacardi of misleading consumers into thinking its rum was made in Cuba.\n\nThe court said Havana Club International and Havana Club Holding don't have the\n\nright to make that claim because they weren't injured by the alleged\n\nwrongdoing.\n\nBacardi is fighting to preserve its dominance as the world's largest maker of\n\nrum. Pernod is the worldwide leader in sales of Irish Whiskey, under the\n\nJameson and Bushmills brands, and its Wild Turkey is the world's best-selling\n\nbrand of bourbon. The Pernod partnership with the Cuban government, formed in\n\n1993, now sells 1.25 million cases of Havana Club rum a year to Canada, Mexico,\n\nSpain and other countries.\n\nAlthough that's only a fraction of the 20 million cases Bacardi produces each\n\nyear, Havana Club International says it wants to increase its output to 5\n\nmillion cases by 2010, with a million of those heading to the United States,\n\nassuming the embargo ends by then. The Pernod group accuses Bacardi of using\n\nunfair tactics to undermine that competition.\n\nTrade Wars\n\nThe case could have ramifications well beyond the beverage industry. Critics of\n\nthe lower court ruling say it could spark a trade war. Because the\n\nInter-American Convention simply requires countries to provide reciprocal\n\ntrademark rights, a decision favoring Bacardi would permit Cubans legally to\n\ncopy trademarks and trade names from the U.S., they say.\n\n``The decision below threatens scores of major U.S. companies with the prompt\n\nloss of effective protection for their trademarks and trade names and against\n\nunfair competition that they heretofore have enjoyed,'' the Pernod group's\n\nappeal said.\n\nTo accept that argument, Bacardi countered, would be ``to give credence to the\n\n. . . threats of the Castro government to seize those marks.''\n\nThe case is Havana Club Holding v. Bacardi & Co. Ltd., 99- 1957.\n\nAnheuser-Busch Expects First China Beer Profit in 2001, SD Says\n\nShanghai, Sept. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos., the world's largest\n\nbrewer, expects to start earning a profit in China in 2001, six years after\n\nentering the market, Shanghai Daily reported, citing Philip Davis, the chairman\n\nof Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing Co., its sole China brewery.\n\nBudweiser's share of the premium beer market in China has risen to 25 percent\n\nnow from 10 percent in 1997, the paper said.\n\n``We prefer to increase market share by cutting the price,'' the paper cited\n\nDavis as saying. About 25 percent of the raw materials for making beer in China\n\nare imported, the paper said.\n\nAnheuser-Busch spent $52 million acquiring an existing brewery in Wuhan in 1995\n\nand invested $150 million more to upgrade its production line, which has 2.5\n\nmillion hectolitres of annual production capacity, the paper said.\n\n(Shanghai Daily, 9/29/2000, p.5; {SNGI <GO>} for the newspaper's Web site)\n\nUS Supreme Court Could Limit Company Power to Fire Alcohol and Drug-Users\n\nWashington, Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court signaled skepticism\n\nabout the right of employers to fire drug users from safety-sensitive jobs\n\nafter labor arbitrators have ordered the workers reinstated.\n\nThe justices are considering how far companies should be allowed to go in\n\noverriding arbitration decisions that are contrary to public policy. The\n\ndispute involves whether a P&L Coal Holdings Corp. unit must abide by an\n\narbitrator's order to reinstate a truck driver who twice tested positive for\n\nmarijuana use. The company wants to void the arbitrator's decision on\n\npublic-policy grounds -- namely that the employee is a threat to the safety of\n\nothers.\n\nThe United Mine Workers of America contends that once the company agreed to\n\nsubmit disputes to arbitration, it was bound to abide by arbitrators' findings\n\nexcept those that would make the company break the law. The Department of\n\nTransportation's Motor Carrier Safety Regulations require holders of commercial\n\ndriver's license to submit to drug and alcohol tests. The agency's rules,\n\nhowever, neither make it illegal to reinstate employees who test positive for\n\ndrug use nor establish penalties for drivers who test positive more than once.\n\nThat the Department of Transportation hasn't spelled out a penalty ``seems to\n\nerect a caution sign in my mind,'' said Justice David Souter.\n\nNo Specific Rule\n\nAlthough judges have some power to overturn arbitrators' decisions on\n\npublic-policy grounds, the Supreme Court said in 1987 that courts had to point\n\nto an ``explicit'' government policy. In that case, the justices unanimously\n\nbarred a company from firing a paper-plant worker caught with marijuana in his\n\ncar, faulting a lower court for basing its conclusions on ``speculation or\n\nassumption,'' rather than a review of existing laws.\n\nLower courts have interpreted the 1987 decision in different ways. Some say\n\njudges may overturn only arbitration awards that would violate specific\n\nregulations or statutes. Others say that, at least in industries governed by\n\nstrict safety regulations, companies must be able to fire dangerous workers,\n\neven if the law does not require them to do so.\n\nIn the case now before the court, P&L's Eastern Associated Coal Corp. tried to\n\nfire James Smith after he tested positive for marijuana twice in 15 months.\n\nSmith worked as a ``mobile equipment operator'' -- a position that required him\n\nto drive 25-ton trucks on West Virginia roads.\n\nBoth times the company sought to fire Smith, and both times an arbitrator said\n\nthe company could take other disciplinary steps and had to reinstate him.\n\nIn the second case, arbitrator Jerome T. Barrett said he accepted Smith's\n\nexplanation that the drug use was a one-time lapse sparked by a family problem.\n\nThe company appealed. Both a federal trial judge in Charleston, West Virginia\n\nand an appeals court upheld the arbitrator's decision.\n\nCollective Bargaining\n\nThe case is one of three the court will consider in its 2000- 01 term, which\n\nbegan today, with the potential to slow the rapid growth of out-of-court\n\ndispute-resolution systems and limit the impact of arbitration decisions.\n\nThe Supreme Court since 1984 has encouraged the use of arbitration to reduce\n\nlitigation costs, citing the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act that declared a\n\nnational policy favoring arbitration. That law told judges, traditionally\n\nhostile to efforts to bypass the courts, to enforce arbitration clauses just\n\nlike any other contracts.\n\n``In determining a public-policy exemption, we are in a more difficult position\n\nthan common law because we've got a labor contract here and a body of law''\n\nthat strongly supports arbitration, Souter said.\n\nEastern Associated and its union are parties to the National Bituminous Coal\n\nWage Agreement of 1993. The collective-bargaining agreements precludes\n\ndisciplining or discharging any employee except for ``just cause'' and requires\n\nunresolved grievances to be decided through binding arbitration.\n\nEastern's internal policy said that an employee who tests positive for drug use\n\nwill be removed from any safety-sensitive position and subject to disciplinary\n\naction up to and including termination.\n\nThe justices questioned why the company did not press for a more specific\n\npenalty for an employee who tested positive more than once for drug use.\n\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that several other employers have made\n\npenalties for drug use part of their contacts, and if Eastern had done that the\n\nquestion of public policy would be ``moot or academic.''\n\n``What you're seeking is for the public policy to kick in if the employer wants\n\nto get rid of the worker,'' O'Connor said.\n\nThe case is Eastern Associated Coal v. United Mine Workers, 99-1038.\n\nWal-Mart To Sell Own Brand of Wine\n\nBy JAMIE STENGLE .c The Associated Press\n\nLITTLE ROCK (AP) 9/30-00 - Some Wal-Mart customers soon will be able to sample\n\na new discount item - Wal-Mart's own brand of wine.\n\nThe world's largest retail chain will begin selling Alcott Ridge Vineyards\n\nworldwide next Thursday, teaming up with E&J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Calif.,\n\nto produce the spirits at an affordable price.\n\nWhile wine connoisseurs may not be inclined to throw a bottle of Wal-Mart brand\n\nwine into their shopping carts, there is a market for cheap wine, said Kathy\n\nMicken, professor of marketing at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I.\n\n``There is wine in a box that people are willing to buy, and quality really can\n\nbe found in gallon jugs,'' she said.\n\nWal-Mart spokesman Hank Ernest said the company sells wine products in 38\n\nstates and worldwide. The corked wine will sell from about $6 to $7 a standard\n\nbottle (750 milliliters) and be available in Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay,\n\nMerlot and White Zinfandel varieties, he said.\n\nIn the U.S., Alcott Ridge Vineyards will be sold only in the stores that\n\ncurrently sell wine.\n\n``Many of our customers are demanding a greater selection of wine products at\n\nprices they can afford. We believe that Alcott Vineyards will help us meet that\n\ndemand,'' said John Ryan, senior vice president of global sourcing for\n\nBentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\n\nThe bottle will not carry the name Wal-Mart or Gallo, but will be upmarketed as\n\n'Plonk Distinct Vere', suggesting its highest quality and the convenient\n\nresealable aluminum closure instead of a traditional cork stopper.\n\nJustin Morris, a professor of food science at the University of Arkansas, said\n\nWal-Mart's move to sell its own brand of wine makes sense.\n\n``Wine certainly is becoming a popular food item,'' he said. ``It's becoming\n\ncertainly more and more the accepted drink of moderation.''\n\nMost people in Europe think of wine as a food, he said. ``This country is\n\nprobably moving in that direction and Wal-Mart probably sees this as an\n\nopportunity.''\n\nTrainees Beating a Path to Wine Country; Record numbers seek the US slant on\n\nagriculture\n\nSANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 28, 2000--Akaki Adeishvili said\n\ngoodbye last month to the world's oldest wine country, ready and willing to\n\ndiscover what the New World could teach him about his craft.\n\n\"I can take something new back to my country when I'm done,\" Adeishvili said as\n\nhe hauled a hose across the floor of La Crema Winery. \"Everything is advanced\n\nhere. Georgia has a great history in wine, but it's in just the first steps of\n\nredevelopment.\"\n\nAdeishvili left his native Georgia, the former Soviet Republic, to join a\n\nworldwide migration of winery talent that heads for California each fall. This\n\nyear interns will train in record numbers in California cellars until just\n\nbefore Christmas. They will then carry their experience back to places like\n\nGeorgia, perhaps the world's oldest wine country, according to \"The World Atlas\n\nof Wine\" by Hugh Johnson.\n\nKendall-Jackson Wine Estates, including La Crema, hosts more interns this year\n\nthan any other wine company. The Kendall-Jackson intern group has grown to\n\nabout 40 from just 10 in 1996.\n\nInterns, mostly in their 20s with new degrees or a short time in the industry,\n\nsay they are fascinated with the level of custom handling at Kendall-Jackson,\n\nthe collegial, efficient culture of work and extensive use of costly barrels\n\nfor fermentation and aging.\n\n\"There must be more barrels here than in all of Mendoza,\" said Pedro Alejandro\n\nSanchez, referring to his home wine region in Argentina. He scanned the\n\nthousands of barrels at Kendall-Jackson's aging center and shook his head.\n\nHe and Argentine colleague Mariela Razquin resumed labeling a load of new\n\nbarrels, while pondering the accelerating rate of cross-pollination in the\n\nworld of wine.\n\n\"Just in the last year we've seen an influx of French and others to Mendoza,\"\n\nRazquin said. \"It's all the more important, then, that we are here learning\n\nthese methods. We have to learn from each other.\"\n\nBoth interns and employers win under the program, said Beverly Gilmartin, who\n\ncoordinates the Minnesota-based Communicating for Agriculture Exchange Program\n\n(CAEP) that links the interns with wineries and other agriculture.\n\nInterns get acquainted with American innovation and creativity. They gain\n\nexposure to varietals, such as Pinot Noir, they may never handle at home. They\n\nlearn more English and build a network that can turn into wider job\n\nopportunities.\n\n\"On the other hand, the hosts are able to learn about winemaking techniques and\n\ncultural differences from around the world,\" Gilmartin said. \"It upholds the\n\ntrue meaning of exchange.\"\n\nTwenty-five nations are sending 310 winery interns this year, a record. CAEP is\n\nsponsoring close to 1,000 trainees in all classes of American agriculture, also\n\na record.\n\nMike Mendenhall, cellar master at La Crema, said his staff embraces the\n\ndistinct ideas and culture that interns bring, as well as their eagerness to\n\nlearn.\n\n\"They have a vested interest in wine,\" he said. \"That makes them easy to work\n\nwith, and they work very hard.\"\n\nGilmartin predicted the program will grow in the coming years as word spreads\n\namong world winemakers. South America in particular has boosted its\n\nparticipation, now rivaling Europe in the number of wine interns.\n\nA California internship provides winemakers from the Southern Hemisphere an\n\nadded advantage: they can return home and put their training to use as soon as\n\nMarch, when their home harvest begins. Ximena Pacheco is rehearsing for harvest\n\nin her native Chile, where she hopes to work for Calina, part of\n\nKendall-Jackson Wine Estates.\n\nInterns agree that more international exchange will build the distinct wine\n\nculture of each nation, not dilute it.\n\n\"We'll never lose our own style,\" Argentina's Razquin said. \"In the end, it's\n\nright there in the land.\"\n\nPresident/CEO of Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Creams Resigns\n\nMARLTON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 28, 2000--Jeremy's MicroBatch(R) Ice\n\nCreams (NASDAQ: <A HREF=\"aol://4785:JMIC\">JMIC</A>; BSE: JMI) announced today\n\nthat Joseph Phillips has submitted his resignation as the President and Chief\n\nExecutive Officer of the Company, and as a member of the Board of Directors, in\n\norder to pursue other interests.

But, like many Internet startups, the maker of such\n\nflavors as Vanilla Cream Stout and Fuzzy Navel has yet to turn a profit.\n\nIn recent months Jeremy's has made some dramatic changes in hopes of turning\n\nitself around.\n\nAfter reporting $4.1 million in losses over the first half of the year, the\n\ncompany slashed its marketing staff from about 100 to fewer than 10, closed\n\nsome stores in the West and shuffled its front office, scooping up experienced\n\nexecutives and replacing its 24-year-old founder and namesake at the chief\n\nexecutive officer position.\n\nJeremy Kraus, now chairman of the company, remains confident that the\n\n3-year-old premium ice cream company, which markets to 18 to 24-year-olds, will\n\nturn a profit next year.\n\nKraus founded the ice cream company in 1997 as a class assignment while\n\nattending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. When he graduated a\n\nyear later, his ice cream was selling in about 50 stores.\n\nThen, Kraus hit an extraordinary string of good luck.\n\nHe was named one of the state's top young entrepreneurs by the Pennsylvania\n\ngovernor's office and he won an essay contest by Mail Boxes Etc., which landed\n\nthe company a commercial during the 1999 Super Bowl worth $1.6 million - more\n\nthan its annual revenues.\n\nIn February Jeremy's earned $7 million in its initial public offering and in\n\nMarch fashion designer Nicole Miller created a silk tie and scarf using a\n\ncollage of Jeremy's flavor logos, including Vanilla Cream Stout, Triple\n\nEspresso, Chocolate Overload, Eve's Sinful Cider and Tiramisu.\n\nThis summer, the ice cream was mentioned in InStyle magazine and The New York\n\nTimes, after a series of free ice cream giveaways during the 90-degree days of\n\nPhiladelphia's Republican National Convention.\n\nStill, media attention is secondary to profits.\n\nShares of Jeremy's fell from a high of $6.75 in February to about $1 a share in\n\nAugust. In recent weeks, shares have crept back up to about $2.\n\n``They do make good ice cream, in great flavors. But their income statement\n\nlooks like an Internet company,'' said Mitchell Pinheiro, an analyst at\n\nPhiladelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, citing the company's high\n\nmarketing budget and net losses.\n\nThe company reported a net loss of $4.1 million on sales of $489,000 in the\n\nfirst six months of this year. That's compared with a loss of $856,900 on sales\n\nof $572,400 during the same period last year.\n\nThe company blamed marketing expenses and declining revenue after discontinuing\n\nsales out West, which had accounted for 16 percent of 1999 sales. Down from a\n\npeak of 3,200 outlets in 21 states, Jeremy's now is available in about 2,000\n\nstores mostly in the Northeast.\n\nIn July, board of trustees member Joe Phillips - a former executive for\n\nChampion athletic wear - was appointed president and CEO. Other additions\n\nincluded former Pepsi-Cola executives Joseph Casey as chief operating officer\n\nand David A. Broll as a member of the board of directors.\n\nIn addition to sprinkling its management team with experience, the company\n\npared its expensive marketing department from more than 100 full- and part-time\n\nworkers to fewer than 10, including five regional sales managers who are to be\n\nhired this fall.\n\n``In order to get the company where I wanted it to be ... we needed some\n\ntop-level executives,'' Kraus said.\n\n``We have a lot of similarities to Internet startups,'' Kraus added. ``The\n\nyoung founder, the venture capital, the emphasis on marketing. But unlike those\n\ncompanies ... we expect to be profitable next year. And that is something that\n\nmost of the Internet startups cannot say.''\n\nEven if Jeremy's survives this bump in the road, Pinheiro said a small ice\n\ncream company has limited potential: either sell out or find a distribution\n\npartner with a large company, or go out of business.\n\n``Small companies in the early stages can pick up sales from the dollars that\n\nfall between the cracks. But once you get on the radar screen and become a\n\nthreat, the challenges increase,'' Pinheiro said.\n\nOn The Net: http://www.microbatch.com\n\nNew Management Team At Jeremy's MicroBatch Ice Creams Outlines 18-Month\n\nStrategic Plan\n\nMARLTON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 14, 2000--Jeremy's MicroBatch(R) Ice\n\nCreams (NASDAQ: <A HREF=\"aol://4785:JMIC\">JMIC</A>; BSE: JMI) announced today\n\nthe highlights of an 18-month strategic plan designed to stimulate consumer\n\ninterest, solidify business relationships, and rapidly generate revenue.\n\nBlending their combined fifty years of consumer products experience, with a\n\nfirst-hand understanding of the generation x and y consumer, Jeremy's\n\nMicroBatch(R) Ice Creams' new president and chief executive officer, Joe\n\nPhillips; chief operations officer, Joseph Casey, and chairman, Jeremy Kraus,\n\nconceived a strategic plan that focuses on the following five initiatives:\n\n-- Alternative distribution: Selling Jeremy's MicroBatch(R) Ice\n\nCreams where the target demographic (18-34 yr. old males and\n\nfemales) spends their time and money.\n\n-- Expanded sales force: Hire, train and support eight regional\n\narea sales managers who will secure alternative distribution\n\noutlets from Maine to Virginia.
