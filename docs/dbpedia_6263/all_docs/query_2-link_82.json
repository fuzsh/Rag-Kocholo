        "text": "Pictured: Paris Henken (Coronado, Calif.) and Helena Scutt (Kirkland, Wash.), 49erFX, US Sailing Team Sperry dueling with world championship-winning teams from New Zealand and Brazil, Day Four.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFebruary 12, 2016\n\nClearwater, Fla. – Day Four of the 49er, 49erFX and Nacra 17 World Championships in Clearwater, Florida saw Team USA gain its first two Rio 2016 Olympic sailors while multiple American teams battled their way into Gold Fleet. US Sailing Team Sperry athletes will have a chance to earn their way into Sunday’s medal races based on their performances tomorrow.\n\nSATURDAY: LIVE Video Coverage from Clearwater\n\n49er and 49erFX racing will be brought to a worldwide sailing audience on Saturday, February 13 (Day 5) at the Worlds in Clearwater. Coverage will include onboard cameras, aerial footage, 3D graphics and expert commentary as the best skiff sailors in the world battle off Clearwater Beach. The broadcast will begin at 12:00 noon EST.\n\nSEE ALSO: Team Tracker – Current Standings of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Sailing Teams Selection Series\n\n49erFX (Women’s Two-Person High Performance Skiff)\n\nParis Henken (Coronado, Calif.) and Helena Scutt (Kirkland, Wash.) clinched victory in the U.S. Olympic Team Selection Series in the 49erFX after posting a second consecutive day of excellent scores (2,4,9). While the Americans are pleased with their Olympic selection, they remain firmly focused on qualifying for Sunday’s medal race, and challenging for a podium spot. They are currently in 9th overall.\n\nSee Also: Henken & Scutt Earn U.S. Olympic Team Selection in the 49erFX\n\nTracker: 49erFX Class U.S. Olympic Team Selection Tracker\n\nWatch Henken and Scutt battle at the top of the fleet in Clearwater with the full video replay of Day Four 49erFX action, featuring onboard cameras, aerial footage, 3D graphics and expert commentary:\n\n49er (Men’s Two-Person High Performance Skiff)\n\nPictured: Thomas Barrows (St. Thomas, U.S.V.I.) and Joe Morris (Annapolis, Md.), 49er, US Sailing Team Sperry\n\nIn the 49er, two American boats have qualified for Saturday’s Gold Fleet racing, and will have a chance at Rio 2016 selection. Judge Ryan (San Diego, Calif.) and Hans Henken (Coronado, Calif.) fell slightly to 16th overall with finishes of 27, 3, 20, 14. Thomas Barrows (St. Thomas, U.S.V.I.) and Joe Morris (Annapolis, Md.) stand in 22nd, after scores of 25, 7, 5, 16. The top 25 boats earned a place in Gold Fleet.\n\nBarrows and Morris only trail Ryan and Henken by ten points at this event, and both teams are locked in a close battle for U.S. Olympic Team selection. Depending on which teams qualify for Sunday’s medal race, the Team USA Rio 2016 selection series for the 49er could be settled tomorrow. To earn selection, Ryan and Henken must beat Barrows and Morris by seven or more places overall.\n\nNacra 17 (Mixed Two-Person Multihull)\n\nMichael Easton (Bedford, Mass.) and Katie Pettibone (Port Huron, Mich.) lead all American Nacra 17 teams in 19th overall. With no Americans in a strong position to qualify for medal races, Saturday could be the final day of racing for US Sailing Team Sperry athletes in the mixed multihull class. Olympic Team selection is also on the line, and the battle is close.\n\nBora Gulari (Detroit, Mich.) and Louisa Chafee (Warwick, R.I.) came into this event as the leaders in the selection series after a strong showing at Sailing World Cup Miami. To win selection, Easton and Pettibone must finish fifteen places ahead of Gulari and Chafee, while Mark and Carolina Mendelblatt (Miami, Fla.) must finish seven spots ahead. With the three boats sitting in 19th, 29th and 24th, respectively, the selection series could come down to a dramatic final series of races.\n\nSee Also: Nacra 17 Class U.S. Olympic Team Selection Tracker\n\nRacing will continue on Day Four of the 49er, 49erFX and Nacra 17 World Championship in Clearwater, Florida, with medal races being held on Sunday, February 14, 2016.\n\nUSA Results: 49er, 49erFX and Nacra 17 World Championship\n\nFull Results\n\n49erFX (Women’s Two-Person High Performance Skiff): 43 boats\n\n9th overall, Paris Henken (Coronado, Calif.) and Helena Scutt (Kirkland, Wash.), US Sailing Team Sperry\n\n37th overall, Genny Tulloch (San Francisco, Calif.) and Maggie Shea (Chicago, Ill.)\n\n41st overall, Emily Dellenbaugh (Easton, Conn.) and Elizabeth Barry (Riverside, Conn.), US Sailing Team Sperry\n\nSee Also: 49erFX Class U.S. Olympic Team Selection Tracker\n\n49er (Men’s Two-Person High Performance Skiff): 54 boats\n\n16th overall, Judge Ryan (San Diego, Calif.) and Hans Henken (Coronado, Calif.)\n\n29th overall, Brad Funk (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) and Trevor Burd (Marblehead, Mass.), US Sailing Team Sperry\n\n22nd overall, Thomas Barrows (St. Thomas, U.S.V.I.) and Joe Morris (Annapolis, Md.), US Sailing Team Sperry\n\n38th overall, Fred Strammer (Nakomis, Fla.) and Mike Kuschner (Gloucester Point, Va.)\n\n39th overall, David Liebenberg (Livermore, Calif.) and Dan Morris (San Francisco, Calif.)\n\n49th overall, Andrew and Matthew Mollerus (Rye, N.Y.)\n\n56th overall, Jonny Goldsberry & Chad Freitas\n\n62nd overall, Wade Waddell and Ian MacDiarmid\n\n63rd overall, David Ames & P.J.
