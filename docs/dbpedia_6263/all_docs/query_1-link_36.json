        "text": "THE COLLECTION ITSELF\n\nThe entire Albert Cook Myers Collection came to the Chester County Historical Society in 1955 as a gift from Myers “to be more available to the public…” The collection came in various states of organization.\n\nA major portion of the collection consists of Penn papers. His life’s work, Myers was interested in producing the definitive series of the writings of Penn as well as producing the definitive biography of Penn. These papers were organized into loose leaf notebooks and an index, produced by Myers, exists for these papers. By recreating the life of Penn in chronological order, Myers hoped to include all his writings and notes on his life.\n\nThe main purpose of this catalogue does not deal with these “gray boxes” containing the Penn material. Rather, at the time the collection came to Chester County Historical Society, over 350 other boxes of material compiled during the lifetime of Albert Cook Myers, came with it and were put aside. Some of these other than Penn topics, were researched in depth; other skim surfaces and were just ideas which struck the fancy of Myers.\n\nBefore discussing subject matter, a few words need be said about the research methods of Myers. During his lifetime, Myers never learned to type or drive a car. He was always dependent on secretarial services for producing typed manuscripts or reports and on mass transit, hired drivers or friends, for transportation to research opportunities. These factors did not necessarily limit his research, but his methods of research were shaped by them.\n\nBecause transportation limited where he could go and how often he could go, Myers became a copious note taker whenever he was present at a research facility. His notes were not always taken according to an outline or just one topic. Because he might not be able to return easily, he took massive notes on any subject he might use in the future, always planning to separate and organize his notes at some future time.\n\nWhen Myers took notes, he never made a single copy. In fact, he always had carbon paper and note tablets, enabling him to take notes in triplicate or quadruplicate. What this means for the user of this collection is that his notes show up in different forms and in different places. Sometimes there are just folders of stray notes, with any organization being indiscernible.\n\nFrom this disorganized state, many stages exist in between. His ultimate form of organization, short of a finished manuscript, is labeled “notes pasted to sheets”. To reach this state, Myers sorted out all his information, reread everything according to his outline, and put them together in a form he would use to produce a manuscript. He then went one step further and pasted these notes to sheets, which were then usually placed in binder notebooks. In the mind of Myers, this research was complete and ready for the final writing. Research in this form is so noted.\n\nBecause of limited transportation, Myers compensated in two ways. He got the endorsement of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and was given full access to their materials from the beginning of the 20th century until 1936. The other way Myers conducted research is through extensive correspondence. The collection contains much of this correspondence exchanged with noted contemporary historians as well as research institutions.\n\nThis collection follows the interests of Myers and his circumstances at various times in his life. A central theme, which transcends all research, is the history of Adams County, Pennsylvania and more specifically, the history of the Cook/Myers families. His research notes date from the 1890’s and continues into the 1950’s. He had the good fortune to have many relatives in residence, who were willing to do research for him and submit the results to him by mail.\n\nAs Myers found himself on various committees or boards, usually as a secretary in charge of keeping records and taking notes (the results being part of this collection), his research followed the agenda of the committees and boards. Therefore, there is a large collection of information on Quakers since Myers was a birthright Quaker himself and served on the various Quaker boards. His large collection of material on the Indians initially started with Penn’s dealings with the Indians, but was greatly enhanced as Myers became Secretary of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission in 1924 and took on the task of spearheading the movement to mark historical sites, many of which were Indian sites.\n\nThe order in which the topics appear in this guide is artificial. Myers left no specific order. An arbitrary order was created by me, attempting to tie like subjects together. Introductions to each section appear, as well as a listing of file names. To help the researcher, the types of information found in the files are listed next to the file name. These types run from simple notes, printed matter, and organized notes to polished manuscripts.\n\nAll photographs, of which there are many, have been removed from this part of the collection and part of the photo collection of the Chester County Historical Society. Printed matter on a specific topic is found with the topic, unless specifically noted as being part of the book collection of Albert Cook Myers.\n\nCarol Grigson,\n\nProject Archivist\n\nQUAKERS\n\nBecause Myers was a birthright Quaker himself and was deeply involved in the study of William Penn, it became quite natural for him to pursue the study of Quakers, their records and their customs. He was particularly interested in finding all depositories of Quaker records, which could be used by the researcher. He also became vitally interested in the movement of Pennsylvania Quakers to the West and wanted to publish a book on this topic. He searched many manuscript collections seeking journals and diaries.\n\nThis subject is not clearly distinctive from the research on William Penn. Since much of the ordering of the collection was done by Myers’ himself, and the order has been maintained where possible, one should also consult the records on Penn in this collection and the references to the Quakers in general.\n\nBox 1—QUAKERS–PHILADELPHIA MEETING\n\nFile 1—(All the notes in this section have been organized by ACM and pasted to sheets.

MOST ARE UNSIGNED.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA HISTORY\n\nThis series of boxes was originally designed and put together by Myers. By reading some of his personal notes, he once entertained the idea of writing a definitive history of Pennsylvania. The form it was to take never appears in his notes. As he went through his life, more and more files were added under the general topic of Pennsylvania History.\n\nIn most instances the word used on the file as a label was determined by ACM himself. Some of the topics have vast amount of information contained within the files; others are very scanty.\n\nOf value to the genealogist, are alphabetical files of non-Quaker ethnic group immigration. Myers also collected many items on various religious groups.\n\nSome files are full of information with massive amount of notes. Others are very scanty containing very few notes.\n\nBox 12—PA HISTORY–SUBJECT HEADINGS FROM ACCOUNT BOOKS TO COURTS\n\nThe subjects include:\n\nAccount book sources, Animals, Architecture and houses, Artisans (notes of ACM)\n\nBeavers, Betsy Ross House (includes the controversy about whether historical marker is on correct house),\n\nBiographies (includes sources of records)\n\nBoundaries, (The topic of boundaries utilizes several folders and is dealt with extensively. The main topic is the Ben Chambers Line and the Taylor Line, both of which came through ChesterCounty and extended west to the Susquehanna River. The survey lines were to determine the actual boundaries of the land Penn bought from the Indians. ) These folders include notes and copies of drafts of actual survey lines, and notes on landholders through whose properties the boundary lines were drawn. They are organized with the notes pasted to sheets, giving structure and order.\n\nBricks and brickyards, Caves, Clocks and jewels, Constitutional history of early Pennsylvania, Copper mines, Costume, (all\n\ncontain loose notes of ACM)\n\nCourts (notes of ACM, Article from PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE)\n\nBox 13—PA HISTORY–ECONOMIC HISTORY TO IMMIGRATION, NON- QUAKER, GERMAN\n\nThe subjects include:\n\nEconomic history, Fences, Fishing/whaling, Farming/livestock, Forests, Forges/furnaces/stoves, Funerals, Furniture, Fur trade (all ACM notes)\n\nGlass manufacturing (ACM notes), Highwaymen (notes ordered and pasted to sheets)\n\nImmigration–non-Quaker: general—ACM notes\n\nFor additional information on family names, see also the gray boxes in the Penn Collection. Contained within them is information on non-Quaker immigration, Swedish immigration, Welsh immigration and a general topic just called “immigration”. All this information is by family name.\n\nDanes/Poles, Frankfort Company—notes pasted to sheets\n\nFrench family names, A-D, French family names, D-l, French family names, L-V—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nFrench—Chronological Notes, Bibliographic references (notes pasted to sheets)\n\nGerman, German/Palatines—pamphlets, notes of ACM journal articles\n\nBox 14—PA HISTORY–IMMIGRATION NON-QUAKER GERMAN TO IRON MINES AND WORKS\n\nThe subjects include:\n\nImmigration—non-Quaker\n\nGerman/Palatines—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nGerman families, A-F, German families G-K—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nGerman families L-V, German families W-Z—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nIrish, Italian/Spanish, Jews, Scotch\n\nIndentured Servants, Insurance, Iron mines and works\n\nBox 15—PA HISTORY–LAND TENURE TO RELIGIOUS, NON-QUAKER– SCHWENFELDERS\n\nThe subjects include:\n\nLand tenure, Light and firemaking (scanty notes), Mills/milling (detailed notes), Mines\n\nNegroes in Pennsylvania (extensive notes), Paper/paper mills (notes and pamphlet)\n\nPetroleum, Pirates(organized notes pasted to sheets)\n\nPlace names in alpha order (organized notes pasted to sheets), Physical land characteristics\n\nReligious Groups, non-Quaker:\n\nBaptists, Battle Axes, Catholics (notes—different degrees of completeness)\n\nEphrata Cloister, Episcopal, Lutheran\n\nMennonites, Moravians (notes and pamphlets), Pietists,\n\nPresbyterian, Schwenfelders\n\nBox 16—PA HISTORY–ROADS TO SOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe subjects include: (often scanty notes unless otherwise stated)\n\nRoads, Saddler, Schools (pamphlets, notes),\n\nSchuykill River (Falls of)—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nShip-building (notes, magazine articles), Shippensburg (Extensive, detailed research notes for historic marker)\n\nSilk industry, Silver (notes, pamphlet), Social history (extensive notes and magazine articles)\n\nBox 17—PA HISTORY–SUSQUEHANNA RIVER—WITCHCRAFT\n\nThe subjects include:\n\nSusquehanna River (West Side)—extensive notes pasted to sheets\n\nTailors, Taverns, Timber, Tobacco, Transportation\n\nUnderground railroad (notes of ACM), Upland Court (organized notes pasted to sheets)\n\nWagons (notes), Witchcraft—notes organized and pasted to sheets\n\nBox 18—PA HISTORY–PENNSYLVANIA BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nFile 1—Pennsylvania Bibliography–notes\n\nFile 2—Lists of Historians–notes\n\nFile 3 & 4–Public Records—extensive notes\n\nFile 5 & 6–Misc. references—Extensive notes, labeled “bibliography” by ACM, but not sorted or organized\n\nFile 7—Lists of books and diaries—notes and pamphlets\n\nFile 8—References about America—primarily clipped articles and pamphlets\n\nPHILADELPHIA HISTORY\n\nFrom the variety of notes and the order in which they are found, it appears that Myers wanted to write a history of Philadelphia, tracing the city from its beginnings to where other counties, namely Montgomery and Berks, were carved out of it. His notes are divided into the various sections of the county, using the common neighborhood names known today. He also collected information about the city in general. Because all of his notes are in files and there appears to be no manuscript, Myers never got further than collecting information for this history.\n\nBox 19—PHILADELPHIA–EARLY PHILADELPHIACOUNTY\n\nTopics include:\n\nMSS (photostat) of RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITY OF PHILADELPHIA UNTIL 1770 by Robert Proud\n\nHistory of Philadelphia, PhiladelphiaCounty, 1715 (notes printed matter, correspondence)\n\nEarly Philadelphia town—research notes\n\nSections of the county, divided by Myers, as found in 1715:(Differing amount of notes for each section)\n\nByberry, Blocklely, Merion, Oxford (includes pamphlet on LowerDublinBaptistChurch), Perkiomen\n\n( Montgomery County): Abington, Whitpain, Whitemarsh, Dublin, Horsham, Montgomery, Plymouth, Towamensing,\n\nSkippack, Gnynedd or North Wales, Manatawny, Amity, Oley, Society Hill\n\n( Berks County): BerksCounty, City Notes (rather large collection of notes), Board of Property, Bowne Accounts\n\nBox 20—PHILADELPHIA–SUBJECT HEADINGS, B–T\n\nTopics include:\n\nBrickyards, Caves, Charter, Courts, Economics (notes often scanty)\n\nHistorical Pageant of 1912—Pageant script, newsclippings\n\nHouses, Inns and public buildings–notes\n\nLogan Square lawsuit (court papers), Meeting Houses, Mills Name–notes\n\nPopulation, Prints of old Philadelphia, Roads and streets, Schools and education—notes and journal articles\n\nSpringfield Manor (blueprints, maps, notes pamphlets)\n\nStenton (published articles), Tradesmen\n\nBox 21—PHILADELPHIA–SUBJECT HEADINGS, Y—END\n\nTopics include:\n\nYellow fever epidemic of 1793 (articles from FRIENDS INTELLIGENCER), Germantown (pamphlets and\n\nnewsclippings), Philadelphia articles (newsclippings) Pamphlets on Philadelphia:\n\n“Historic Philadelphia And Environs”\n\n“Guide to Philadelphia”\n\n“What To See in Philadelphia”\n\n“Public Buildings in Philadelphia”\n\n“Philadelphia: Past, Present”, Pullinger, 1915\n\n“Bi-Centennial Celebration,1882”, program\n\nAs part of his study on Quakers and Pennsylvania History, Myers became very interested in other colonies, especially those containing Quakers. He searched the records of several states, as well as the Library of Congress, trying to find these early records. He particularly became greatly interested in the “Valley of Virginia”, which was once part of Pennsylvania, but with boundary changes, is presently in the state of Maryland.\n\nBox 22—COLONIAL HISTORY–COLONIAL IMMIGRATION (excluding\n\nTopics include:\n\nSwedish Colonial History (extensive notes), Colonial flags of New Jersey and North Carolina (research and\n\nreport of ACM on flags)\n\nColonial Immigration in general (primarily note cards), Colonial\n\nRacial Elements (mixed notes and cards)\n\nTravels–England, 17th c.

He also included extracts from some of the journals he found.\n\nHis file headings include:\n\nAbstracts of diary of Hannah Greaves Pierce of East Marlborough\n\nTravels in America—bibliographic notes\n\nEarly journals, diaries, narratives–notes\n\nMiscellaneous diaries–notes\n\nThe West, South, New York including diary of John Bartram’s journey in\n\nGeorgia, 1765—extracts, notes and printed matter\n\nJournals–18th c New England, including “Autobiography of a Revolutionary Vagabond”, 1807, Harry Tufts (extracts)\n\nJournals, 17th & 18th c, England and Scotland–notes\n\nJournal, 1839, ChesterCounty, Swayne, near London Grove (extracts)\n\n18th c.

In keeping with the movement of the times, he proposed an exhaustive history of the American frontier using original journals and diaries. He wrote complete outlines for the book and put together an extensive bibliography. He corresponded with several book publishers, but ultimately nothing came of the venture—correspondence, outlines, note cards\n\nBox 26—SLAVERY\n\nNote cards on slavery in the South which include the immigration of slaves\n\nBox 27—FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER\n\nNotes from the lectures of Frederick Jackson Turner given at the University of Pennsylvania and University of Wisconsin in 1903\n\nEARLY PENNSYLVANIA LEADERS\n\nAs part of his Penn research, Myers automatically became involved in researching many of the early leaders, who were either brought by Penn or were immigrants who settled in Pennsylvania. Some of these names were researched because Myers wanted to mark historical sites. Others became important when they were in some way tied to his family genealogy. Many of the names contain information on sub-families. Little attempt has been made to separate and sort the notes. They are found grouped into the family groups as sorted by ACM.\n\nBox 28—PA LEADERS–CRESAP\n\nThomas Cresap—organized research notes pasted to sheets\n\nCorrespondence with M Jackson Crispin\n\nBox 29—PA LEADERS–CRISPIN-FINCHER\n\nCrispin, Crispin–Irish sources—organized research notes, often pasted to sheets, some printed matter\n\nDoz—notes pasted to sheets\n\nJohn Fincher lands—maps, research notes\n\nBox 30—PA LEADERS—FINCHER\n\nFincher lands and family—extensive research notes, including land information, family charts and genealogy\n\nBox 31—PA LEADERS–GILPIN\n\nGilpin—extensive research on family in England and America, many family charts\n\nBox 32—PA LEADERS–GILPIN–HOLME\n\nGilpin\n\nThomas Holme—extensive, organized research, in both Engalnd and America, some printed matter\n\nBox 33—PA LEADERS–HOLME–RAPPE\n\nThomas Holme—more research notes, including photostats of some of his surveys\n\nKeith Family—GraemePark, correspondence with William Buck\n\nJesse Kersey—research notes, particularly search for Sully portrait\n\nLamboll—family charts and notes (see also gray box # 117)\n\nLightfoot—photostat of expedition notes to Connecticut in 1770\n\nPastorius—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nRappe—research notes, some photostats\n\nIn the collection of ACM books are found 4 by Kersey:\n\nTREATISE OF FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, 1815\n\nTREATISE OF FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, 1842\n\nNARRATIVE OF THE EARLY LIFE, TRAVELS, AND GOSPEL LABORS OF JESSE KERSEY, LATE OF CHESTERCOUNTY, 1851\n\nSame book, second printing, 1852.\n\nBox 34—PA LEADERS—PUSEY\n\nCaleb Pusey–builder of a house in Chester, Myers did a complete research on Pusey, his house and his activities. These were put together in a large notebook, in the box as part 1 and 2. Also included are fragments of the first history of Pennsylvania written by Pusey . Myers wants to publish this after he edited the work. All of his notes and work is contained in the files. All of the notes and research is very extensive and well organized.\n\nBoxes 35 & 36–PA LEADERS–BENJAMIN WEST\n\nBenjamin West–Myers was asked to research the West family for a special celebration at his alma mater, Swarthmore. Being very methodical, Myers undertook to research the entire family, their residences, the life of West and each picture that was part of the exhibit. All notes are well organized. Contained in these two boxes are the following topics:\n\nWest ancestry line, Gilpin line, John West, (his father)\n\nSarah Pearson and family (his mother)\n\nBirthplace on campus of Swarthmore\n\nNewtown Square home of John West\n\nMorris family (sister of Benjamin)\n\nACM notes, pictures, portraits of West and family\n\nPainting of Young Men\n\nBenjamin West Society, Biographical sketches\n\nCorrespondence, ACM speech, 1929\n\nPamphlets and books include:\n\n“Benjamin West Not A Quaker”, Charles Hart, 1908\n\n“Life and Works of Benjamin West,” Carson, 1921\n\nLIFE AND WORKS OF BENJAMIN WEST, ESQ, Part II, Galt,\n\nJohn, 1820\n\n“Benjamin West and Pennsylvania,” Bye, 1929\n\nTHE GENERAL MAGAZINE AND HISTORICAL CHRONICAL,\n\nApril 1929, University of Pennsylvania\n\nBox 37–SETTLEMENT MAPS, 1660, 1690,1715\n\nMyers collaborated with the Burrows Company in Philadelphia to construct maps showing the settlement patterns of the colonies. These published maps became the basis for further research and future maps, used at the Jamestown Exposition, 1907.\n\nThis box contains the research, sources, and other information needed to construct the maps. More information is contained in the oversized files.\n\nCOUNTYHISTORIES\n\nThese notes were collected as an adjunct to other research. There never was\n\nany attempt to be systematic or complete. The lack of pattern suggests Myers collected whatever struck him at a given moment.\n\nBox 38—COUNTYHISTORIES–BUCKSCOUNTY\n\nFile 1—Bibliography–notes\n\nFile 2—Early Bucks Co.—information on early deeds\n\nFile 3—Bucks Co., 1715—research notes\n\nFile 4—1715, Bensalem, Buckingham—research notes\n\nFile 5—Falls, Makefield—research notes\n\nFile 6—Newtown, Middletown, Solebury\n\nFile 7—Southampton, Warminster, Richland\n\nFile 8—Durham—includes maps of Durham tract\n\nFile 9—Bucks Co, 1735–notes\n\nFile 10–Unsorted Notes\n\nFile 11–Doylestown, 1922–notes\n\nFile 12–Maonngie–notes\n\nFile 13–Misc news articles and pamphlets\n\nFile 14–Selden Family\n\nFile 15–Washington Crossing—published report\n\nFile 16–ServantTownship—notes pasted to sheets\n\nBook: Centennial of Doylestown, 1938\n\nBox 39—COUNTYHISTORIES–CHESTERCOUNTY: BATTLE OF BRANDYWINE—FRENCH CREEK\n\nFile 1—Battle of Brandywine, notes, pamphlet “Lafayette at Brandywine”, 1896, published by Chester County Historical Society\n\nFile 2—Battle of Brandywine\n\nNewsclippings\n\nPamphlets:\n\n“The Battle of the Brandywine”, Frederick Stone, 1895 “Some Account of The British Army and The Battle of Brandywine”, Joseph Townsend, 1846\n\n“150th Anniversary of Battle of Brandywine”, 1927\n\n“The Brandywine Story, 1777-1952”\n\nFile 3—Bibliography—extensive notes on sources of information\n\nFile 4—BradfordTownship, 1715—notes and maps\n\nFile 5—CalnTownship, Maps and Notes\n\nFile 6—Chester County Historical Society—programs, notices of events\n\nFile 7—Fagg’s Manor and Penn’s Manor—detailed organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nFile 8—French Creek and North French Creek—organized notes pasted to sheets\n\nBox 40—COUNTYHISTORIES–CHESTERCOUNTY: GOSHEN TOWNSHIP—LONDON GROVE\n\nFile 1—Goshen township, 1715—scanty notes\n\nFile 2—Kennett, 1715—detailed notes\n\nFile 3—Kennett and Kennett Square—detailed notes and printed matter\n\nFile 4—Kennett–Martin Academy–catalogue\n\nFile 6—Kennett New Century Club—printed matter\n\nFile 7—Kennett Home Week, 1940—printed matter\n\nFile 8—Early Kennett—notes on recollections of William Pyle\n\nFile 9—LondonGroveTownship Map\n\nBox 41—COUNTYHISTORIES–CHESTERCOUNTY: MARLBOROUGH TO WILLISTOWN{\n\nFile 1—MarlboroughTownship, 1715—map, scanty notes\n\nFile 2—New Garden, Elwood Michener Mss Historical Papers\n\nFile 3—NewGarden and London Grove, 1715—notes and map tracings\n\nFile 4—Nottingham—extensive research notes\n\nFile 5—Sadsbury, 1715–notes\n\nFile 6—Tax lists, early—taken from records of CCHS\n\nFile 7—Taylor’s surveying instructions—copied from original\n\nFile 8—Tredyffrin, 1715—scanty notes\n\nFile 9—Whiteland, 1715—scanty notes\n\nFile 10–Willistown, 1715—scanty notes\n\nBox 42—COUNTYHISTORIES–CHESTERCOUNTY: PAMPHLETS:\n\nCharter and By-LawsChesterCounty Historical Society\n\nHistoric Letters from Collection of West ChesterState Normal School, 1898\n\nChester County Historical Society, “Exercises in Memory of General Wayne, 1914\n\nJohn Fritz, Pioneer in Iron and Steel, CCHS, 1954\n\n“Golden Wedding of John and Hanna Cox”, 1873\n\nBulletins of the ChesterCounty Historical Society, 1902-03\n\nBulletin of ChesterCounty Historical Society,” Exercises in Memory of Thomas B.

Promoters envisioned a massive exposition presenting “the ideal of American Life.”\n\nPlagued by bad weather and construction problems, many of the exhibits were two months late in opening. Many of the early problems were never solved and the exposition ended up deeply in debt.\n\nThe directors of the Exposition hired Albert Cook Myers as History Superintendent. In this capacity, he was to oversee each state’s historical exhibit. These exhibits were placed in a fireproof building which was lighted only by natural light coming through skylights, and which was not heated or cooled.\n\nIn another capacity, he was one of the directors and very active participant in establishing and constructing the Pennsylvania exhibit.\n\nBox 47—JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION, 1907 (General)\n\nFile 1—Invitations and Tickets–Collection of formal invitations issued by various governments, celebrating specific events\n\nFile 2—Newspaper clippings–Collection of clippings from Virginia and Pennsylvania newspapers regarding the Exposition, the awards and the bankruptcy of the promoters\n\nFile 3—News Releases–Copies of releases, written by the Exposition Promoters, sent to newspapers in the country\n\nFile 4—Pamphlets and Guides\n\n”Auto route to the Exposition”\n\nTrain information\n\nSmall pamphlets describing the Exposition\n\nMaps of the Exposition\n\nPrograms for May 13, September 16 and September 25\n\nSmall guide books\n\nBox 48—JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION–WORK AS SUPERINTENDENT OF HISTORY, MARCH 1907-DECEMBER, 1907\n\nFile 1—Organizational memos, initial correspondence as Superintendent of History\n\nFile 2—Reference Sources–Illustrated American History books Journal articles( primarily from Mc Clure’s and Harper’s) of portrait collection\n\nFile 3—Reference Sources—Sources of portraits/painting, which includes a catalogue of pictures and slides available\n\nFile 4–Proposed research in England to secure items for the exhibit\n\nFile 5–Exhibit Rules and forms\n\nFile 6—Official photographs of the Exposition–lists and order forms from The Official Photographer\n\nFiles 7-11–Working notes for historical exhibits for the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

Named as directors, were Marion Learned from the University of Pennsylvania and Albert Cook Myers.\n\nThe goal of the exhibit was to show the early settlement and development of Pennsylvania, as well as show the extension of settlement across Pennsylvania. They proposed to do this by designing maps, visually showing patterns of settlement by religion and ethnic background, and displaying artifacts of the early history of Pennsylvania.\n\nTo produce the maps, massive new research, especially among different religious groups, was undertaken. Help was sought, and generally received, from diverse groups.\n\nThe exhibit won a gold medal at the Exposition.\n\nFile 1—1906–Papers relating to the Organization of a committee to create the Pennsylvania History exhibit\n\nProposals for the scope of the exhibit\n\nCorrespondence of the directors Marion Learned and Albert Cook Myers\n\nFile 2—1907–Correspondence, especially about the objects to be exhibited, shipping the items to Virginia for display and\n\n“Pennsylvania Day”, October 4, 1907.\n\nFile 3—1908–Correspondence, primarily to get items returned to donors, and the official report to the State Commission on the exhibit\n\nFile 4—Exhibit Pieces–Requests, receipts, shipping\n\nFile 5—Building specifications, building requirements\n\nNote: blueprints for building and exhibit in oversized files\n\nFile 6—Awards, including award for the Pennsylvania exhibit.\n\nBox 50–JAMESTOWN EXHIBITION—PRINTED MATTER\n\n1.

Several parades and pageants were the focus of the public activities.\n\nIn conjunction with the above activities, an Historic Industries Loan Exhibit was planned, to be housed on the fourth floor of City Hall. Fresh from their success as directors of the Pennsylvania History Exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, Marion Learned and Albert Cook Myers were named directors of the Philadelphia exhibit.\n\nAs stated in their brochure, the purpose of the exhibit was “to illustrate the economic history and to display specimens of the industries and trades of Philadelphia and its tributary region during the colonial and early national periods.” Myers spent great amounts of time planning the exhibit and securing items for it.\n\nThe collection contains circulars, replies, correspondence, and various lists of people and items connected to the exhibit. The name tags for the items loaned by the Chester County Historical Society have been saved.\n\nBox 52—FOUNDERS WEEK, PHILADELPHIA, 1908–ORGANIZATION\n\nFile 1—Organizational meetings, early 1908, development of\n\nsolicitation circular\n\nFile 2—Lists for mailing circulars seeking items for display\n\nFile 3—Returned circulars listing availing display items\n\nFile 4—Lists of contributed items by county\n\nFile 5—Mailings, primarily in September, either pursuing a circular\n\nresponse or seeking specific items for display\n\nFile 6—Correspondence, June and July, 1908, sorted by ACM\n\nBox 53—FOUNDERS WEEK–CORRESPONDENCE\n\nFile 1—Correspondence, August-October, A-F, sorted by ACM\n\nFile 2—Correspondence, August-October, G-Z, sorted by ACM\n\nFile 3—Lists of Exhibit items\n\nFile 4—Papers relating to exhibit materials\n\nFile 5—Receipts for items received/returned\n\nBox 54—FOUNDERS WEEK–EXHIBIT\n\nFile 1—Exhibit Tags representing items loan by Chester County Historical\n\nSociety\n\nFile 2—Expense account items\n\nFile 3—Historical Pageant–Programs\n\nFile 4—Newspaper clippings, including 80 page supplement from THE\n\nEVENING BULLETIN called “The Story of Philadelphia,” September 30, 1908.

He focused heavily on Jamestown and Philadelphia’s Founders Week for direct examples of the organization and direction of such exhibits.\n\nThe paper was so well received, that Myers was asked to prepare it for publication by the American Historical Association. However, he never met the deadline for publication and the manuscript was returned to him.\n\nFile 1—History of Exhibits\n\nFile 2—International Exhibits\n\nFile 3—Regional Expositions\n\nFile 4—PhiladelphiaAcademy of Fine Arts\n\nFile 5—Sanitary Fair, Philadelphia 1867\n\nFile 6—Suggestions for creating major exhibitions\n\nFile 7—Founders Week, Philadelphia, 1908\n\nFile 8—OhioValley Centennial, 1888\n\nFile 9—Southern States Exhibitions\n\nFile 10–Correspondence re: speech\n\nFile 11–Manuscript of speech presented at convention of American\n\nHistorical Association\n\nFile 12–Follow-up correspondence regarding publication of Historic\n\nExhibits speech\n\nWORLD WAR I\n\nSoon after war was declared in 1917, a war service committee from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, organized to explore what could be done to welcome the traveling serviceman in Philadelphia. Their activities eventually fell into three broad categories–receptions, tours of the important objects housed at the Historical Society, and historical hikes. Myers was directly involved in all three areas.\n\nFor the receptions, patrons were sought and secured. Food, dancing, and “liberty sings” became standard and successful. Because they were held at the Historical\n\nSociety building on Locust Street, the tours of important artifacts usually preceded the reception. These receptions were given throughout 1918, taking time out for the warm summer months and for the month of November because of an epidemic of influenza. They continued until May, 1919. In all, over 25,000 men were hosted.\n\nThe historical hikes were led by historians from Philadelphia, following a script prepared by Myers, and ran from November, 1918 until December, 1919. In the early period, they were often combined with swims at the YMCA. According to reports made at the end of the war, 10,000 men had participated. The average weekly participation was 150-100 men, mostly sailors.\n\nAs an adjunct to this work, committees worked to find lodging for servicemen. This included lists of hotels, rooming houses, and cot tickets for cots placed in churches and clubs. The Friends Service Committee also ran a facility of its own for this purpose.\n\nMyers did additional writing for this project. He wrote guides for weekly events, and a guide describing historical places for the serviceman to visit. At its completion, he wrote the final report.\n\nBox 56—WORLD WAR I–PHILADELPHIA\n\nFile 1—Programs offered: Liberty Sings, Slides, Receptions, Historical\n\nHikes\n\nFile 2—General Correspondence: Includes the purpose and scope of the\n\nCommittee and the announcements and reports on the receptions\n\nFile 3—Accommodations for Servicemen: Correspondence of the Committee on lodging; available accommodations, tickets for cots\n\nFile 4—Pamphlets on Philadelphia: (written by ACM)\n\na. “For Soldiers-Sailors-Marines”\n\nb. “What’s What for Philadelphia’s Soldiers, Sailor and Marine Guests”\n\nFile 5—Friends Service Club—minutes, correspondence\n\nFile 6—Friends in World War I—notes, printed matter\n\nFile 7—Catalogue of important items housed at the Historical Society of\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFile 8—Minutes–War CampCommunity Service Committee\n\nFile 9—Historical Hikes: a script, preliminary notes, tickets\n\nFile 10–Formal reports of the War Committee\n\nFile 11–Pennsylvania War History Commission—formal reports\n\nFile 12–Book of contributions for the reception\n\nOversize file–poster\n\nBox 57—WORLD WAR I: SCRAPBOOKS\n\nFile 1—Newspaper clippings\n\nFile 2—Scrapbook of ACM, part of 1918\n\nFile 3—Scrapbook of ACM, late 1918-1919\n\nBox 58—PENN CELEBRATION, 1918\n\nOrganized by the Philadelphia Society of Friends, this box contains:\n\nCorrespondence relating to the event\n\nAcceptance /declination letters for the general committee\n\nProclamation of the Governor\n\nTranscript of the program\n\nBox 92 of the gray boxes (Penn Collection) contains correspondence with the Governor arguing the significance of the day and the need for a proclamation, a list of the committee members, and a program for the day.\n\nBox 59—PENN CHARTER, 1924-1925\n\nWhen the original signed Charter (a sort of Bill of Rights for the colonists of Pennsylvania) came on the market, Myers spearheaded a campaign to raise money from the public to buy the manuscript. The Philadelphia newspapers entered the campaign and gave it enormous amounts of space. Each day’s issue kept a running tally of how much had been collected.\n\nWhen enough money was collected and the purchase was consummated, elaborate plans were made for taking the Charter, after being on display in Philadelphia, to Harrisburg, where it was formally presented to the State for the People of Pennsylvania. The collection contains many of the newspaper articles, along with the detailed plans for the presentation celebration.\n\nPENN CELEBRATION, 1932\n\nTo mark the 250th anniversary of Penn’s arrival at Philadelphia, massive celebrations were planned for the City of Philadelphia. Pageants, parades, medals, statues, a stamp in honor of Penn, historical markers, and hookups with European states as part of a radio address, were all part of the celebration.\n\nBox 60—PENN CELEBRATION, 1932\n\nFile 1—Commemoration Act, 06/11/31, later declared unconstitutional, correspondence\n\nFile 2—General Committee–correspondence\n\nFile 3—Program Committee minutes\n\nFile 4—Correspondence, 1931\n\nFile 5—Correspondence, 1932\n\nFile 6—Programs (Tentative)\n\nFile 7—Program Committee—minutes, correspondence\n\nFile 8—Program Committee Correspondence\n\nFile 9—Program proofs\n\nFile 10–Play, convention hall, etc\n\nFile 11–Suggestions for play, pageants, etc.\n\nFile 12–”Thou, Philadelphia”(Pageant Play), scenery, cast\n\nFile 13–Mead Trial, 1670—recreation, part of celebration\n\nFile 14–Chief War Eagle—notes, correspondence\n\nBox 61—PENN CELEBRATION, 1932\n\nFile 1—Proposed statue of Penn–newsclippings\n\nFile 2—Penn medal—newsclippings, correspondence\n\nFile 3—Penn stamp—newsclippings, correspondence\n\nFile 4—Penn Stamp, first day issue—newsclippings, correspondence\n\nFile 5—Summary report of work in England by Frances Dorrance\n\nFile 6—Penn Lecture, Media, October 28, 1932\n\nFile 7—International radio hookup–correspondence\n\nFile 8—European speeches—proposed speeches by European leaders\n\nFile 9—Newsclippings, part 1\n\nFile 10–Newsclippings, part 2 (All October 1932)\n\nFile 11–Myers dispute—newsclippings (over money remaining from celebration)\n\nFile 12–Myers speech on Penn—notes, printed speech\n\nFile 13–Penn/Indian Land Treaty Sale–notes\n\nPenn Papers\n\nThis group of papers was separated out of the main collection in 1959 when the collection was given to the Chester County Historical Society. It was not part of the original manuscript. The papers give the story of how the project was conceived and how the research was done. Brochures, which were used to solicit donations and lists of subscribers, are in abundance. Myers also, through a series of folders, writes out his goals and plans. He has copies of letters he sent to individuals who had private libraries. He spent many years in England doing the research, and the folders resulting from that research are in this part of the collection.\n\nBox 62—PENN PAPERS—PROPOSAL\n\nFile 1—Proposed plan of

In trying to trace all the movements of William Penn, Myers came in contact with Indian chiefs and their dealing with Penn. This led to a great interest in Indians, where he searched out their customs, their relationships with settlers, and their life in general.\n\nIn 1924, Myers was appointed to the Pennsylvania Historical Commission. He spearheaded a movement to seek out and mark historical sites in Pennsylvania. His earlier research became the basis of his new task and new information was discovered.\n\nThis collection on Indians is divided into several sections: Indian Traders, IndianTowns, Indian Walking Purchase, Indian Hanna, and general subject areas on Indians. Because research on Indians also appears in the gray boxes of the Penn Collection, reference is made to these boxes and what is contained within them.\n\nBox 83—INDIANS–INDIAN TRADERS\n\nFile 1—Peter Bizaillion–French Huguenot Indian Trader, 1664-1742.

The research done by Myers is very extensive. He tried to trace her family tree (difficult for Myers because Indian genealogy goes through the female rather than the male lines), trace every place she lived in Chester County through a series of “queries” he gave to family members, and secure any supporting evidence he could to document the life of Indian Hannah. Most of this research was completed in 1909. Once completed, Myers organized and pasted his notes to read as he wished.\n\nBox 92—INDIANS–INDIAN HANNAH\n\nFile 1—General Research\n\nChandler family, its genealogy, queries to Chandler family members\n\nb.

One of his greatest undertakings was the large celebration of 1928, which celebrated the 150th anniversary of the French alliance with the United States.

The scene changed in 1930 when the Warner Company, involved in quarrying nearby, donated the land, which became the original PennsburyPark. Once the site belonged to the state, the state investigated what it would take to rebuild Pennsbury. As part of his work on the Pennsylvania Historical Commission, Myers was placed in the position of one of the directors of research and was part of the planning committee for the restoration of Penn’s House. Excavations were undertaken, along with extensive research of written materials to ascertain exact construction designs, materials, and furnishings.\n\nLabor was difficult to secure, because America was in the midst of a great depression and state funding was often uncertain. Help appeared in the form of CWA workers for clerical help and excavation labor. These funds also dried up and the project had to finally turn to private funding.\n\nMyers did not see the completion of the project. He withdrew in 1936, when money was no longer available for his salary. He was convinced that the house, which eventually opened to the public, was one of the “biggest monstrosities ever put on the taxpayer.”\n\nThe first series of boxes were set up by ACM himself. His plan was to go through all the writings of Penn and copy out in date order, every reference he could find connected to Pennsbury. Secondly, he made a list of topics, filed them alphabetically, and usually put the historic references into the folders. Thus, Myers had a system which double checked every possible subject–one by date order and one by subject. Most of these folders contain very limited amounts of information.\n\nBox 103—PENNSBURY–A-D\n\nThe first file in this collection contains all the references in date order.\n\nThe remaining files contain the following subjects:\n\nAdams, Joseph, agricultural methods\n\nBanister, barge, barn, bees, Biddle, Sarah\n\nBlacks, boards, bread, brewhouses, bricks, bricklayers\n\nBridge, building, builder (contriver), Burgess, Anthony\n\nCalow, John, carpenters, carpenter tools, carts\n\nCeiling heights, cellar, cherry trees, chimney, cider\n\nClaypoole’s lot in Philadelphia, cleared land\n\nCloset (governor’s), clothes, coach\n\nCook, Arthur, corn, country scenes\n\nCourt yards, covets, cranberries\n\nDairy, Dearborn, Hugh\n\nDistilling, doors, draughts, Dummer, Robert\n\nBox 104—PENNSBURY–E-M\n\nIncluded are the following subjects:\n\nEnglish grass, entry, events at Pennsbury\n\nFarm implements, fences, fertilizer, fields–hay dust\n\nFishing, the Flat, food, foundation, furniture and furnishings\n\nGardens, Governor’s gardens, Great garden on Delaware River Garden wall, gardens in England, gardens and gardening (early)\n\nGarretts, gates, glass, graft, gravel, Griscom, Andrew\n\nGrounds of Pennsbury, Great Hall, gun of William Penn\n\nHardware, Hawkins, hazelnuts, herbs, Holt, Ben, houses\n\nHusbandry—farming\n\nIndian fields, Indians at Pennsbury, Islands at Pennsbury\n\nJackson, Ephraim\n\nKitchen, kitchen garden, knob\n\nLabor conditions, lady’s house near Pennsbury, (Martha Durant)\n\nLanding, lane, larders, lean-to, lime, livestock, Lord Cornbury’s visit\n\nMartin, John, middle story of house, Milan oven, mill, money\n\nMoldings\n\nBox 105—PENNSBURY–N-Z\n\nIncludes the following subjects:\n\nNet for fishing, nursery for fruit trees\n\nOrchards–fruit trees, out-houses—shed\n\nPark, parlor(best), pasture, Pennsbury—name\n\nPennsbury House–The Great House, plastering, plowing\n\nPlumbers, the Point, poplar trees on the Delaware River, porches\n\nPosts, painter, privy, Prothero, Evan\n\nQuickset—haws\n\nRails and banisters, risening, roofs, rooms–general, roses\n\nSalading, Salter, Hannah, saw-mill, servants, shade, shingles\n\nSide saddle, sloop, Smith, John, Sotcher, John\n\nSpouts, staircase, swamp in Philadelphia\n\nTaylor, James, terrace, turned work\n\nVegetables, vineyards\n\nWainscoat, Walker, Joseph, walks, wallfront of Pennsbury\n\nWalnut trees on Delaware River front, wash house\n\nWells and pump, wheat, wheelwright, windows, wine, Wood, Peter\n\nWoods–miscellaneous trees\n\nBox 106–PENNSBURY—RESTORATION\n\nFile 1—Donation of Pennsbury by Warner Company–photostats\n\nFile 2—Report of the Institute of Architects—notes and architects\n\nFile 3—Maps of Pennsbury\n\nFile 4—Correspondence of Committee, 1933-34\n\nFile 5—Correspondence of Committee, 1935\n\nFile 6—Removal of caretaker’s house—plans—see also oversized files\n\nFile 7—Reconstruction sketches\n\nFile 8—”The Monstrosity”—letter of Myers\n\nFile 9—Expense accounts\n\nFile 10–Newsclippings re Pennsbury\n\nFile 11–Pennsbury research–notes\n\nFile 12–Miscellaneous notes, not in order\n\nFile 13–Catalogues seeking sources of items to furnish Pennsbury\n\nBox 107—PENNSBURY– GARDEN RECONSTRUCTION\n\nFile 1–Garden books bibliography—loose notes\n\nThe files of the following gardening books usually contain only copies of the title page and sometimes the contents page\n\nFile 2—John Worlidge, SYSTEMA AGRICULTURAE\n\nFile 3—Moses Cook, THE MANNER OF RAISING, ORDERING AND\n\nIMPROVING FOREST AND FRUIT-TREES\n\nFile 4—Leonard Meager, ENGLISH GARDENER\n\nFile 5—Sir Hugh Platt, THE GARDEN OF EDEN\n\nFile 6—Nicolas Bonnefons, FRENCH GARDENER (trans by John Evelyn)\n\nFile 7—William Hughes, THE FLOWER GARDENER\n\nFile 8—Charles Cotton, THE PLANTERS MANUAL\n\nFile 9—John Evelyn, KALENCLARIUM"
