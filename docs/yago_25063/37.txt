Family Life and Death.

The family moved to Harrisonville in 1857, and in 1859 Henry was assigned as second mayor of the city.

He was often looted and lost a lot of money. This angered his son Cole who thought he should make a stand. On July 20, 1862 Henry was traveling to Kansas City on a business trip while carrying $1,500 on his person. About one mile south of Westport he was shot three times in the back and killed. It was discovered the killing was politically motivated and not a robbery.

The body was returned to the Youngers who, afraid Union servicemen would dig it up, buried him in an unknown grave.
