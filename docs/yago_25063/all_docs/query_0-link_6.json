He was the father of fourteen children. He was the son of Colonel Charles Lee Younger and Sarah Sullivan Purcell and married Bersheba Leighton Fristoe in about 1830.\n\nHenry and Bersheba Younger's Children.\n\nLaura Helen Younger (born 1 January 1832).\n\nFrances Isabelle Younger (born March 1833).\n\nMartha Ann (Annie) Younger (born 9 January 1835).\n\nCharles Richard (Dick) Younger (born about 1838, died 17 August 1860).\n\nMary Josephine Younger (born about 1840).\n\nCaroline (Duck) Younger (born about 1842).\n\nThomas Coleman (Cole) Younger (born 15 January 1844).\n\nSarah Ann (Sally) Younger (born 2 September 1846).\n\nJames Hardin (Jim) Younger (born 15 January 1848).\n\nAlphae Younger (born about 1850, died about 1852).\n\nJohn Harrison Younger (born about 1851).\n\nEmily J.

This angered his son Cole who thought he should make a stand. On July 20, 1862 Henry was traveling to Kansas City on a business trip while carrying $1,500 on his person. About one mile south of Westport he was shot three times in the back and killed. It was discovered the killing was politically motivated and not a robbery.\n\nThe body was returned to the Youngers who, afraid Union servicemen would dig it up, buried him in an unknown grave.\n\nFile File: http://photos.geni.com/p13/da/f8/58/6a/534448389d4fd7a7henry_washington_younger_original.jpg.
