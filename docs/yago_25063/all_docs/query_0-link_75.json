William Quantrill was a Confederate guerrilla leader during the American Civil War who led a bushwacker unit along the Missouri-Kansas border in the early 1860s, most notably raiding and sacking Lawrence, Kansas in 1863. Born in Ohio in 1837, Quantrill ended up in Kentucky after the war where he was mortally wounded in a Union ambush in May 1865 at the age of 27, dying shortly after in Louisville. As a guerrilla leader, Quantrill conducted raids and terrorized pro-Union civilians and troops in Missouri and Kansas.",
