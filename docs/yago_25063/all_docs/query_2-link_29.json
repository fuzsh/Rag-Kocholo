        "text": "Henrietta Younger Rawlins\n\nHenry Washington Younger was one of Cass Co., Missouri's largest land owners and businessman. He married Bersheba Leighton Fristoe about 1830. He was a loyal Union Colonel who was killed by Federal troops on 20 July 1862. The assassination of Henry Washington Younger would forever change the course of American history, the frontier of the wild west, and many families, including his own.\n\nChildren\n\nof\n\nHenry Washington Younger & Bersheba Leighton Fristoe\n\nLaura Helen Younger\n\n1832\n\n1924\n\nFrances Isabelle Younger\n\n1833\n\n1902\n\nMartha Ann Younger\n\n1835\n\n1918\n\nCharles Richard Younger\n\n1838\n\n1860\n\nMary Josephine Younger\n\n1840\n\n1869\n\nCaroline Younger\n\n1841\n\n1865\n\nThomas Coleman Younger\n\n1844\n\n1916\n\nSarah Ann Younger\n\n1846\n\n1925\n\nJames Hardin Younger\n\n1848\n\n1902\n\nAlphae Younger\n\n1850\n\n1852\n\nJohn Harris Younger\n\n1851\n\n1874\n\nEmily J Younger\n\n1852\n\n1900\n\nRobert Ewing Younger\n\n1853\n\n1889\n\nHenrietta Younger\n\n1857\n\n1915\n\n1st row L-R: Bob, Jim & Cole Younger\n\nStanding: Henrietta Younger\n\nThe Younger brothers post-war years as outlaws began in 1866. Four of the brothers drifted into a life of violence and crime. Cole Younger and his brother, James Younger had joined the Quantrill guerrillas during the Civil War. By 1868, the James-Younger Gang were notorious for their crimes.\n\nCole Younger\n\nJim Younger\n\nJohn Younger\n\nBob Younger\n\nHenrietta Younger Rawlins\n\nMiss Henrietta Younger was active in social and religious activities while living in Denison, Texas.\n\nAccording to the 1887 Denison City Directory, Henrietta is living in the household of her sister, Martha Ann Younger Jones.\n\nHenrietta became the wife of A.B. Rawlins on April 1, 1894 at Gainesville, Cooke Co., Texas; the bride had taught school for many years in Denison and the groom was a practicing attorney in Cooke Co. (The Sunday Gazetteer, April 1, 1894, pg.4)\n\nThe Sunday Gazetteer\n\nSunday, October 28, 1888\n\npg. 1\n\nLOCAL CONDENSATIONS\n\nMonday\n\n\"The Christian Spark,\" is the name of a new religious paper about to be published in this city. It has for its motto: \"God help the rich, the poor can beg.\" Miss Henrietta Younger, of 319 Barrett avenue, is managing it.\n\nHenrietta Younger along with the family of her sister, Martha Ann Younger Jones, attended the Christian Church of Denison. (The Sunday Gazetteer, Sunday, February 10, 1889, pg.4)\n\nThe Sunday Gazetteer\n\nSunday, March 24, 1889\n\npg. 4\n\nSOCIETY MELANGE\n\nA very pleasant entertainment under the auspices of Christian Church Sunday School took place at the church edifice, on Armstrong avenue, Monday night, the principal features of the performance being contributed by the \"White Buds\" - a little mite of a literary society connected with the Sunday school, and presided over by Miss Retta Younger. The program consisted of songs, recitations, reading the little society paper, essays, etc., in which the participants displayed a refreshing enthusiasm, and a childish intelligence that was surprising. The entertainment was largely attended, and in every respect successful.\n\nThe Sunday Gazetteer (April 7, 1889, pg.4) reported that Miss Retta Younger had left that week for Independence, Missouri where she would teach in the public schools. In the summer of 1889 Miss Henrietta spent time in Stillwater, Minnesota, as she wrote a letter dated July 17, 1889 to \"My Dear Little White Buds\", little girls from her literary society in Denison. The letter was printed in the July 28th issue of The Sunday Gazetteer as it describes the weather and scenery of the area as well as her trip on an excursion boat and the lumber companies in the area.\n\nBiography of Col.
