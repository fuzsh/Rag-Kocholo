        "text": "Henry Washington Younger (February 22, 1810 â€“ July 20, 1862) was a businessman and father to the Younger outlaws Cole, Jim, John and Bob. He was the father of fourteen children. He was the son of Colonel Charles Lee Younger and Sarah Sullivan Purcell and married Bersheba Leighton Fristoe in about 1830.\n\nHenry and Bersheba Younger's Children\n\n[edit]\n\nLaura Helen Younger (born 1 January 1832)\n\nFrances Isabelle Younger (born March 1833)\n\nMartha Ann (Annie) Younger (born 9 January 1835)\n\nCharles Richard (Dick) Younger (born about 1838, died 17 August 1860)\n\nMary Josephine Younger (born about 1840)\n\nCaroline (Duck) Younger (born about 1842)\n\nThomas Coleman (Cole) Younger (born 15 January 1844)\n\nSarah Ann (Sally) Younger (born 2 September 1846)\n\nJames Hardin (Jim) Younger (born 15 January 1848)\n\nAlphae Younger (born about 1850, died about 1852)\n\nJohn Harrison Younger (born about 1851)\n\nEmily J.

This angered his son Cole who thought he should make a stand. On July 20, 1862 Henry was traveling to Kansas City on a business trip while carrying $1,500 (~$45,780 in 2023) on his person. About one mile south of Westport he was shot three times in the back and killed. It was discovered the killing was politically motivated and not a robbery.\n\nThe body was returned to the Youngers who, afraid Union servicemen would dig it up, buried him in an unknown grave.\n\nYounger Family Y-DNA Project\n\nThe Younger Y-DNA Project has identified several different Younger families in the United States and found that the common ancestor of the Younger Gang's family is Humphrey Younger (c. 1677 - 1740). Humphrey Younger immigrated to Kent County, Maryland and his descendants included the Younger brothers Cole, John, Jim, and Bob who rode with the outlaw Jesse James. The connected Younger families include the descendants of Captain John W. Younger (c.1773 - 1858), a War of 1812 veteran, Joshua Younger (c.1752 - unknown), and Tiller Younger (c. 1700s - unknown), a Revolutionary War veteran and son of Humphrey Younger based on Y-DNA connections. The Younger family's haplogroup is J-M172.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
