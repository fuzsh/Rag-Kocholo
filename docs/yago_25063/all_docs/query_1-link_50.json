        "text": "The Long Branch Saloon was the most well-known saloon in Dodge City, Kansas from about 1874 to 1885. It had numerous owners, most notably Chalk Beeson and gunfighter Luke Short. The establishment provided live entertainment, notably Chalk’s five-person orchestra, and gambling.\n\nIt was the scene of many altercations, shoot-outs, gunfights and standoffs often associated with the then-wild cattle town, the most famous of which was the Long Branch Saloon Gunfight, in which Frank Loving killed Levi Richardson.\n\nThe saloon was built as the result of a wager between cowboys and soldiers playing ball. Bets were placed and if the cowboys beat the soldiers, the soldiers agreed to provide building materials to construct a saloon.\n\nBorn in Missouri on October 29, 1853, Robert was the thirteenth of fourteen children born to Henry Washington Younger and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe. During the Civil War his brothers Cole and Jim rode with Quantrill’s Raiders. Bob was only 8 when the war broke out in 1861. He saw his father killed by Union soldiers and his home burned to the ground.\n\nAfter the war, his brothers formed the James-Younger gang with Frank and Jesse James. For ten years the gang robbed banks, trains, and stage coaches across Missouri, Kansas, and other nearby states. Bob Younger is believed to have first joined the gang in 1873.\n\nIn September 1876 the gang attempted to rob the First National Bank in Northfield, Minnesota. The townspeople decided to fight back, and in the ensuing shootout all three of the Younger brothers were captured. Bob was wounded in the elbow and later in the chest. Two Northfield citizens were killed in the botched raid.\n\n(Photo was taken 1872, after capture.)\n\nChristopher Houston “Kit” Carson (December 24, 1809– (May 23, 1868) was an American frontiersman and Indian fighter. Carson left home in rural present-day Missouri at age 16 and became a mountain man and trapper in the West.\n\nCarson explored the west to California, and north through the Rocky Mountains.\n\nHe lived among and married into the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes.\n\nHe was hired by John C. Fremont as a guide, and led ‘the Pathfinder’ through much of California, Oregon and the Great Basin area. He achieved national fame through Fremont’s accounts of his expeditions. He became the hero of many dime novels."
