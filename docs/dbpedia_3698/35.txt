"The Gymnasium" - aka Charlotte Y. Martin Centre is an athletics center on the campus of Gonzaga University housing a 4,000 seat multi-purpose arena in Spokane, Washington. It opened on December 3, 1965 as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion, with a capacity of approximately 2,000 patrons. The arena was renamed as part of Gonzaga's centennial celebrations on March 17, 1987, for which major renovations were done to the venue that doubled its size. (Wikipedia)
