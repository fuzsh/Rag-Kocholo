        "text": "An analysis of the interaction between surface and basal crevasses in ice shelves\n\nMaryam Zarrinderakht, Christian Schoof, and Anthony Peirce\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3841–3856, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3841-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3841-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective of the study is to understand the interactions between surface and basal crevasses by conducting a stability analysis and addressing the implications of the findings for potential calving laws. The study's findings indicate that, while the propagation of one crack in the case of two aligned surface and basal crevasses does not significantly reinforce the propagation of the other, the presence of multiple crevasses on one side enhances stability and decreases crack propagation.\n\nThe source, quantity, and spatial distribution of interfacial water during glide-snow avalanche release: experimental evidence from field monitoring\n\nAmelie Fees, Michael Lombardo, Alec van Herwijnen, Peter Lehmann, and JÃ¼rg Schweizer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2485,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2485, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlide-snow avalanches release at the soil-snow interface due to a loss of friction which is suspected to be linked to interfacial water. The importance of the interfacial water was investigated with a spatio-temporal soil and local snow monitoring setup in an avalanche-prone slope. Seven glide-snow avalanches released on the monitoring grid (season 2021/22 to 2023/24) and provided insights into the source, quantity, and spatial distribution of interfacial water before avalanche release.\n\nThe role of atmospheric conditions in the Antarctic sea ice extent summer minima\n\nBianca Mezzina, Hugues Goosse, FranÃ§ois Klein, Antoine BarthÃ©lemy, and FranÃ§ois Massonnet\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3825–3839, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3825-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3825-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze years with extraordinarily low sea ice extent in Antarctica during summer, until the striking record in 2022. We highlight common aspects among these events, such as the fact that the exceptional melting usually occurs in two key regions and that it is related to winds with a similar direction. We also investigate whether the summer conditions are preceded by an unusual state of the sea ice during the previous winter, as well as the physical processes involved.\n\nComprehensive Assessment of Stress Calculations for Crevasse Depths and Testing with Crevasse Penetration as Damage\n\nBenjamin Reynolds, Sophie Nowicki, and Kristin Poinar\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2424,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2424, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStress in glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves causes crevasses, which are important drivers of retreat and sea level rise. We find that different assumptions found in the literature lead to significantly (up to a factor of two) different crevasse depths and recommend a calculation based on observed ice flow patterns. We find that other stress calculations likely overpredict ice shelf vulnerability to hydrofracture.\n\nSeparating the albedo reducing effect of different light absorbing particles on snow using deep learning\n\nLou-Anne Chevrollier, Adrien WehrlÃ©, Joseph M. Cook, Norbert Pirk, Liane G. Benning, Alexandre M. Anesio, and Martyn Tranter\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2583,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2583, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLight absorbing particles (LAPs) are often present as a mixture on snow surfaces, and are important to disentangle because their darkening effect varies, but also because the processes governing their presence and accumulation on snow surfaces are different. This study presents a novel method to retrieve the concentration and albedo reducing effect of different LAPs present at the snow surface from surface spectral albedo. The method is then successfully applied to observations on seasonal snow.\n\nMicrostructure-based modelling of snow mechanics: experimental evaluation of the cone penetration test\n\nClÃ©mence Herny, Pascal Hagenmuller, Guillaume Chambon, Isabel Peinke, and Jacques Roulle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3787–3805, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3787-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3787-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents the evaluation of a numerical discrete element method (DEM) by simulating cone penetration tests in different snow samples. The DEM model demonstrated a good ability to reproduce the measured mechanical behaviour of the snow, namely the force evolution on the cone and the grain displacement field. Systematic sensitivity tests showed that the mechanical response depends not only on the microstructure of the sample but also on the mechanical parameters of grain contacts.\n\nInteractive snow avalanche segmentation from webcam imagery: results, potential, and limitations\n\nElisabeth D. Hafner, Theodora Kontogianni, Rodrigo Caye Daudt, Lucien Oberson, Jan Dirk Wegner, Konrad Schindler, and Yves BÃ¼hler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3807–3823, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3807-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3807-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor many safety-related applications such as road management, well-documented avalanches are important. To enlarge the information, webcams may be used. We propose supporting the mapping of avalanches from webcams with a machine learning model that interactively works together with the human. Relying on that model, there is a 90% saving of time compared to the \"traditional\" mapping. This gives a better base for safety-critical decisions and planning in avalanche-prone mountain regions.\n\nAspect Controls on the Spatial Re-Distribution of Snow Water Equivalence in a Subalpine Catchment\n\nKori L. Mooney and Ryan W.

We observed the south facing slope that experienced mid-winter surface melt events, showed meltwater flowing downslope through the snow. The north facing slope saw similar redistribution of meltwater during the spring snowmelt period.\n\nOn the relationship between Î´O2âN2 variability and ice sheet surface conditions in Antarctica\n\nRomilly Harris Stuart, AmaÃ«lle Landais, Laurent Arnaud, Christo Buizert, Emilie Capron, Marie Dumont, Quentin Libois, Robert Mulvaney, AnaÃ¯s Orsi, Ghislain Picard, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Jeffrey Severinghaus, Barbara Stenni, and Patricia Martinerie\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3741–3763, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3741-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3741-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce core δO2/N2 records are useful dating tools due to their local insolation pacing. A precise understanding of the physical mechanism driving this relationship, however, remain ambiguous. By compiling data from 15 polar sites, we find a strong dependence of mean δO2/N2 on accumulation rate and temperature in addition to the well-documented insolation dependence. Snowpack modelling is used to investigate which physical properties drive the mechanistic dependence on these local parameters.\n\nEvaluating L-band InSAR snow water equivalent retrievals with repeat ground-penetrating radar and terrestrial lidar surveys in northern Colorado\n\nRandall Bonnell, Daniel McGrath, Jack Tarricone, Hans-Peter Marshall, Ella Bump, Caroline Duncan, Stephanie Kampf, Yunling Lou, Alex Olsen-Mikitowicz, Megan Sears, Keith Williams, Lucas Zeller, and Yang Zheng\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3765–3785, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3765-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3765-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow provides water for billions of people, but the amount of snow is difficult to detect remotely. During the 2020 and 2021 winters, a radar was flown over mountains in Colorado, USA, to measure the amount of snow on the ground, while our team collected ground observations to test the radar technique’s capabilities. The technique yielded accurate measurements of the snowpack that had good correlation with ground measurements, making it a promising application for the upcoming NISAR satellite.\n\nBrief Communication: Monitoring snow depth using small, cheap, and easy-to-deploy snow-ground interface temperature sensors\n\nClaire L. Bachand, Chen Wang, Baptiste Dafflon, Lauren Thomas, Ian Shirley, Sarah Maebius, Colleen M. Iversen, and Katrina E. Bennett\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2249,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2249, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTemporally continuous snow depth estimates are vital for understanding changing snow patterns and impacts on permafrost in the Arctic. In this work, we develop an approach to predict snow depth from variability in snow-ground interface temperature using small temperature sensors that are cheap and easy-to-deploy. This new technique enables spatially distributed and temporally continuous snowpack monitoring that was not previously possible.\n\nNovel approach to estimate the water isotope diffusion length in deep ice cores with an application to Marine Isotope Stage 19 in the Dome C ice core\n\nFyntan Shaw, Andrew M. Dolman, Torben Kunz, Vasileios Gkinis, and Thomas Laepple\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3685–3698, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3685-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3685-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFast variability of water isotopes in ice cores is attenuated by diffusion but can be restored if the diffusion length is accurately estimated. Current estimation methods are inadequate for deep ice, mischaracterising millennial-scale climate variability. We address this using variability estimates from shallower ice. The estimated diffusion length of 31 cm for the bottom of the Dome C ice core is 20 cm less than the old method, enabling signal recovery on timescales previously considered lost.\n\nToward long-term monitoring of regional permafrost thaw with satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar\n\nTaha Sadeghi Chorsi, Franz J.

Killingbeck, Anja Rutishauser, Martyn J. Unsworth, Ashley Dubnick, Alison S. Criscitiello, James Killingbeck, Christine F. Dow, Tim Hill, Adam D. Booth, Brittany Main, and Eric Brossier\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3699–3722, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3699-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3699-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA subglacial lake was proposed to exist beneath Devon Ice Cap in the Canadian Arctic based on the analysis of airborne data. Our study presents a new interpretation of the subglacial material beneath the Devon Ice Cap from surface-based geophysical data. We show that there is no evidence of subglacial water, and the subglacial lake has likely been misidentified. Re-evaluation of the airborne data shows that overestimation of a critical processing parameter has likely occurred in prior studies.\n\nPost-depositional modification on seasonal-to-interannual timescales alters the deuterium-excess signals in summer snow layers in Greenland\n\nMichael S. Town, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Sonja Wahl, Anne-Katrine Faber, Melanie Behrens, Tyler R. Jones, and Arny Sveinbjornsdottir\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3653–3683, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3653-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3653-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA polar snow isotope dataset from northeast Greenland shows that snow changes isotopically after deposition. Summer snow sometimes enriches in oxygen-18, making it seem warmer than it actually was when the snow fell. Deuterium excess sometimes changes after deposition, making the snow seem to come from warmer, closer, or more humid places. After a year of aging, deuterium excess of summer snow layers always increases. Reinterpretation of deuterium excess used in climate models is necessary.\n\nVariations in the microstructure of saline ice during its growth and decay: Evidences from an experimental study\n\nMiao Yu, Peng Lu, Hang Zhang, Fei Xie, Lei Wang, Qingkai Wang, and Zhijun Li\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2155,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2155, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice microstructure was observed by continuous sampling and a imaging system. The newly formed bubbles in the middle ice layer were partly thermally driven. Gas bubbles of the ice surface are significantly affected by net shortwave radiation. Variation in the inclusion size distribution was attributed to the merging process.\n\nWind tunnel experiments to quantify the effect of aeolian snow transport on the surface snow microstructure\n\nBenjamin Walter, Hagen Weigel, Sonja Wahl, and Henning LÃ¶we\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3633–3652, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3633-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3633-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe topmost layer of a snowpack forms the interface to the atmosphere and is critical for the reflectance of solar radiation and avalanche formation. The effect of wind on the surface snow microstructure during precipitation events is poorly understood and quantified. We performed controlled lab experiments in a ring wind tunnel to systematically quantify the snow microstructure for different wind speeds, temperatures and precipitation intensities and to identify the relevant processes.\n\nA physics-based Antarctic melt detection technique: combining Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, radiative-transfer modeling, and firn modeling\n\nMarissa E. Dattler, Brooke Medley, and C. Max Stevens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3613–3631, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3613-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3613-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an algorithm based on combining models and satellite observations to identify the presence of surface melt on the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We find that this method works similarly to previous methods by assessing 13 sites and the Larsen C ice shelf. Unlike previous methods, this algorithm is based on physical parameters, and updates to this method could allow the meltwater present on the Antarctic Ice Sheet to be quantified instead of simply detected.\n\nImproved records of glacier flow instabilities using customized NASA autoRIFT (CautoRIFT) applied to PlanetScope imagery\n\nJukes Liu, Madeline Gendreau, Ellyn Mary Enderlin, and Rainey Aberle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3571–3590, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3571-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3571-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are sometimes gaps in global glacier velocity records produced using satellite image feature-tracking algorithms during times of rapid glacier acceleration, which hinders the study of glacier flow processes. We present an open-source pipeline for customizing the feature-tracking parameters and for including images from an additional source. We applied it to five glaciers and found that it produced accurate velocity data that supplemented their velocity records during rapid acceleration.\n\nArctic glacier snowline altitudes rise 150 m over the last 4 decades\n\nLaura J. Larocca, James M. Lea, Michael P. Erb, Nicholas P. McKay, Megan Phillips, Kara A. Lamantia, and Darrell S. Kaufman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3591–3611, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3591-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3591-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present summer snowline altitude (SLA) time series for 269 Arctic glaciers. Between 1984 and 2022, SLAs rose ∼ 150 m, equating to a ∼ 127 m shift per 1 °C of summer warming. SLA is most strongly correlated with annual temperature variables, highlighting their dual effect on ablation and accumulation processes. We show that SLAs are rising fastest on low-elevation glaciers and that > 50 % of the studied glaciers could have SLAs that exceed the maximum ice elevation by 2100.\n\nProjecting the Response of Greenland's Peripheral Glaciers to Future Climate Change: Glacier Losses, Sea Level Impact, Freshwater Contributions, and Peak Water Timing\n\nMuhammad Shafeeque, Jan-Hendrik Malles, Anouk Vlug, Marco MÃ¶ller, and Ben Marzeion\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2184,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2184, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study explores how Greenland's peripheral glaciers will change due to future climate change using OGGM. They might lose 52 % of ice mass. We predict changes in ice discharge versus melting, affecting fjords, sea levels, and ocean currents. Freshwater runoff composition, seasonality, and peak water timing vary by regions and scenarios. Our findings stress the importance of reducing greenhouse gases to minimize impacts on these glaciers, which influence local ecosystems and global sea level.\n\nThe demise of the world's largest piedmont glacier: a probabilistic forecast\n\nDouglas Brinkerhoff, Brandon Tober, Michael Daniel, Victor Devaux-Chupin, Michael Christoffersen, John W. Holt, Christopher F. Larsen, Mark Fahnestock, Michael G. Loso, Kristin M. F. Timm, Russell Mitchell, and Martin Truffer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2354,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2354, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSít' Tlein is one of the largest glaciers in the world outside of the polar regions, and we know that it has been rapidly thinning. To forecast how this glacier will change in the future, we combine a computer model of ice flow with measurements from many different sources. Our model tells us that with high probability, Sít' Tlein's lower reaches are going to disappear in the next century and a half, creating a new bay or lake along Alaska's coastline.\n\nHistory and dynamics of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet retreat, contemporary ice-dammed lake evolution, and faulting in the Torneträsk area, northwestern Sweden\n\nKarlijn Ploeg and Arjen Peter Stroeven\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2486,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2486, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMapping of glacial landforms using LiDAR data shows that the retreating margin of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet dammed a series of lakes in the Torneträsk Basin during deglaciation. These lakes were more extensive than previously thought and produced outburst floods. We show that sections of the Pärvie Fault, the longest glacially-activated fault of Sweden, ruptured at different times, both underneath and in front of the ice sheet, and during the existence of ice-dammed lake Torneträsk.\n\nBenchmarking passive microwave satellite derived freeze/thaw datasets\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Xaver Muri, Markus Hetzenecker, Kimmo Rautiainen, Helena Bergstedt, Jan Wuite, Thomas Nagler, and Dmitry Nicolsky\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2518,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2518, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a robust freeze/thaw detection approach, applying a constant threshold on Copernicus Sentinel-1 data, that is suitable for tundra regions. All global, coarser resolution products, tested with the resulting benchmarking dataset, are of value for freeze/thaw retrieval, although differences were found depending on seasons, in particular during spring and autumn transition.\n\nDynamic and thermodynamic processes related to sea-ice surface melt advance in the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea\n\nHongjie Liang and Wen Zhou\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3559–3569, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3559-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3559-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study identifies the metric of springtime sea-ice surface melt advance in the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea, which can be defined on the same date each year and has the potential to be used in the practical seasonal prediction of summer sea ice cover instead of average melt onset. Detailed analysis of dynamic and thermodynamic processes related to different melt advance scenarios in this region imply considerable interannual and interdecadal variability in springtime conditions.\n\nEffects of sea surface and air temperatures on interannual variations and trends of Arctic sea ice concentration in summer and autumn\n\nDi Chen, Qizhen Sun, and Timo Vihma\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2359,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2359, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigates the variations and trends in Arctic sea ice during summer and autumn, focusing on the impacts of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface air temperature (SAT). Both SST and SAT significantly influence Arctic sea ice concentration. SST affects both interannual variations and decadal trends, while SAT primarily influences interannual variations. Additionally, SAT's impact on sea ice concentration leads by seven months, due to a stronger warming trend in winter than in summer.\n\nBrief Communication: Representation of heat conduction into the ice in marine ice shelf melt modeling\n\nJonathan Wiskandt and Nicolas Jourdain\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2239,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2239, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn ocean models, submarine melt of ice shelves is parameterized based on the heat budget at the interface. The heat budget includes the ocean heat transport, the heat conducted into the ice and the heat available for melting. Here we compare three different approaches to estimate the heat conduction. We show that the most accurate approximation is not the one used most, despite it overestimating the melt by up to 25 % and not being computationally more expensive.\n\nSnow redistribution in an intermediate-complexity snow hydrology modelling framework\n\nLouis QuÃ©no, Rebecca Mott, Paul Morin, Bertrand Cluzet, Giulia Mazzotti, and Tobias Jonas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3533–3557, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3533-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3533-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow redistribution by wind and avalanches strongly influences snow hydrology in mountains. This study presents a novel modelling approach to best represent these processes in an operational context. The evaluation of the simulations against airborne snow depth measurements showed remarkable improvement in the snow distribution in mountains of the eastern Swiss Alps, with a representation of snow accumulation and erosion areas, suggesting promising benefits for operational snow melt forecasts.\n\nSpatial variation in the specific surface area of surface snow measured along the traverse route from the coast to Dome Fuji, Antarctica, during austral summer\n\nRyo Inoue, Teruo Aoki, Shuji Fujita, Shun Tsutaki, Hideaki Motoyama, Fumio Nakazawa, and Kenji Kawamura\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3513–3531, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3513-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3513-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured the snow specific surface area (SSA) at ~2150 surfaces between the coast near Syowa Station and Dome Fuji, East Antarctica, in summer 2021–2022. The observed SSA shows no elevation dependence between 15 and 500 km from the coast and increases toward the dome area beyond the range. SSA varies depending on surface morphologies and meteorological events. The spatial variation of SSA can be explained by snow metamorphism, snowfall frequency, and wind-driven inhibition of snow deposition.\n\nGlacier damage evolution over ice flow timescales\n\nMeghana Ranganathan, Alexander A. Robel, Alexander Huth, and Ravindra Duddu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1850,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1850, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe rate of ice loss from ice sheets is controlled by the flow of ice from the center of the ice sheet and internal fracturing of the ice. These are coupled – fractures can reduce the viscosity of ice and enable more rapid flow, and rapid flow can cause fracturing of ice. We present a simplified way of representing damage that is applicable to long-timescale flow estimates. Using this model, we find that including fracturing into an ice sheet simulation can increase the loss of ice by 13–29 %.\n\nReanalyzing the spatial representativeness of snow depth at automated monitoring stations using airborne lidar data\n\nJordan N. Herbert, Mark S. Raleigh, and Eric E. Small\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3495–3512, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAutomated stations measure snow properties at a single point but are frequently used to validate data that represent much larger areas. We use lidar snow depth data to see how often the mean snow depth surrounding a snow station is within 10 cm of the snow station depth at different scales. We found snow stations overrepresent the area-mean snow depth in ~ 50 % of cases, but the direction of bias at a site is temporally consistent, suggesting a site could be calibrated to the surrounding area.\n\nAn ice-sheet modelling framework for leveraging sub-ice drilling to assess sea level potential applied to Greenland\n\nBenjamin A.

Here we present a framework for using numerical ice-sheet model simulations to provide constraints on how much mass the ice sheet loses before different areas become ice-free. As observations from subglacial archives become more abundant, this framework can guide subglacial sampling efforts to gain the most robust information about past ice-sheet geometries.\n\nIncreasing numerical stability of mountain valley glacier simulations: implementation and testing of free-surface stabilization in Elmer/Ice\n\nAndrÃ© LÃ¶fgren, Thomas Zwinger, Peter RÃ¥back, Christian Helanow, and Josefin Ahlkrona\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3453–3470, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3453-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3453-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper investigates a stabilization method for free-surface flows in the context of glacier simulations. Previous applications of the stabilization on ice flows have only considered simple ice-sheet benchmark problems; in particular the method had not been tested on real-world glacier domains. This work addresses this shortcoming by demonstrating that the stabilization works well also in this case and increases stability and robustness without negatively impacting computation times.\n\nThe AutoICE Challenge\n\nAndreas Stokholm, JÃ¸rgen Buus-Hinkler, Tore Wulf, Anton Korosov, Roberto Saldo, Leif Toudal Pedersen, David Arthurs, Ionut Dragan, Iacopo Modica, Juan Pedro, Annekatrien Debien, Xinwei Chen, Muhammed Patel, Fernando Jose Pena Cantu, Javier Noa Turnes, Jinman Park, Linlin Xu, Katharine Andrea Scott, David Anthony Clausi, Yuan Fang, Mingzhe Jiang, Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan, Neil Curtis Brubacher, Armina Soleymani, Zacharie Gousseau, MichaÅ Smaczny, Patryk Kowalski, Jacek Komorowski, David Rijlaarsdam, Jan Nicolaas van Rijn, Jens Jakobsen, Martin Samuel James Rogers, Nick Hughes, Tom Zagon, Rune Solberg, Nicolas LongÃ©pÃ©, and Matilde Brandt Kreiner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3471–3494, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3471-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3471-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe AutoICE challenge encouraged the development of deep learning models to map multiple aspects of sea ice – the amount of sea ice in an area and the age and ice floe size – using multiple sources of satellite and weather data across the Canadian and Greenlandic Arctic. Professionally drawn operational sea ice charts were used as a reference. A total of 179 students and sea ice and AI specialists participated and produced maps in broad agreement with the sea ice charts.\n\nContrasting patterns of change in snowline altitude across five Himalayan catchments\n\nOrie Sasaki, Evan Stewart Miles, Francesca Pellicciotti, Akiko Sakai, and Koji Fujita\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2026,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2026, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study proposes a new method to detect snowline altitude (SLA) using the Google Earth Engine platform with high-resolution satellite imagery, applicable anywhere in the world. Applying this method to five glaciated watersheds in the Himalayas reveals regional consistencies and differences in snow dynamics. We also investigate the primary controls of these dynamics by analyzing climatic factors and topographic characteristics.\n\nProjected climate change will double the Late Holocene maximum to present ice loss in Central-Western Greenland by 2070\n\nJosep Bonsoms, Marc Oliva, Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno, and Guillaume Jouvet\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1770,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1770, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe extent to which Greenland's peripheral glaciers and ice caps current and future ice loss rates are unprecedented within the Holocene is poorly understood. This study connects the maximum ice extent of the Late Holocene with present and future glacier evolution in the Nuussuaq Peninsula (Central-Western Greenland). By > 2070 glacier mass loss may double the rate from the Late Holocene to the present, highlighting significant impacts of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nThe potential of inÂ situ cosmogenic 14CO in ice cores as a proxy for galactic cosmic ray flux variations\n\nVasilii V. Petrenko, Segev BenZvi, Michael Dyonisius, Benjamin Hmiel, Andrew M. Smith, and Christo Buizert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3439–3451, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3439-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3439-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis manuscript presents the concept for a new proxy for past variations in the galactic cosmic ray flux (GCR). Past variations in GCR flux are important to understand for interpretation of records of isotopes produced by cosmic rays; these records are used for reconstructing solar variations and past land ice extent. The proxy involves using measurements of 14CO in ice cores, which should provide an uncomplicated and precise estimate of past GCR flux variations for the past few thousand years.\n\nFinely-resolved along-track wave attenuation estimates in the Antarctic marginal ice zone from ICESat-2\n\nJoey J. Voermans, Alexander D. Fraser, Jill Brouwer, Michael H. Meylan, Qingxiang Liu, and Alexander V. Babanin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2104,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2104, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLimited measurements of waves in sea ice exist, preventing our understanding of wave attenuation in sea ice under a wide range of ice conditions. Using satellite observations from ICESat-2 we observe an overall linear increase of the wave attenuation rate with distance into the marginal ice zone. While attenuation may vary greatly locally, this finding may provide opportunities for the modelling of waves in sea ice at global and climate scales when such fine detail may not be needed.\n\nWeakening of meltwater plume reduces basal melting in summer at Ekström Ice Shelf, Antarctica\n\nOle Zeising, Tore Hattermann, Lars Kaleschke, Sophie Berger, Reinhard Drews, M.

This study focuses on the Ekström Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, using multi-year data from an autonomous radar system. Results show a surprising seasonal pattern of high melt rates in winter and spring. Sea-ice growth correlates with melt rates, indicating that in winter, dense water enhances plume activity and melt rates. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for improving future mass balance projections.\n\nSubglacial discharge effects on basal melting of a rotating, idealized ice shelf\n\nIrena VaÅkovÃ¡, Xylar Asay-Davis, Carolyn Branecky Begeman, Darin Comeau, Alexander Hager, Matthew Hoffman, Stephen F. Price, and Jonathan Wolfe\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2297,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2297, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the effect of subglacial discharge on basal melting for Antarctic Ice Shelves. We find that the results from previous studies of vertical ice fronts and two-dimensional ice tongues do not translate to the rotating ice-shelf framework. The melt rate dependence on discharge is stronger in the rotating framework. Further, there is a substantial melt-rate sensitivity to the location of the discharge along the grounding line relative to the directionality of the Coriolis force.\n\nSentinel-1 cross-polarization ratio as a proxy for surface mass balance across east Antarctic ice rises\n\nThore Kausch, Stef Lhermitte, Marie G. P. Cavitte, Eric Keenan, and Shashwat Shukla\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2077,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2077, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermining the net balance of snow accumulation on the surface of Antarctica is challenging. Sentinel-1 satellite sensors, which can see through snow, offer a promising method. However, linking their signals to snow amounts is complex due to snow's internal structure and limited on-the-ground data. This study found a connection between satellite signals and snow levels at three locations in Dronning Maud Land. Using models and field data, the method shows potential for wider use in Antarctica.\n\nAssessing the sensitivity of the Vanderford Glacier, East Antarctica, to basal melt and calving\n\nLawrence A. Bird, Felicity S. McCormack, Johanna Beckmann, Richard S. Jones, and Andrew N. Mackintosh\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2060,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2060, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVanderford Glacier is the fastest retreating glacier in East Antarctica and may have important implications for future ice loss from the Aurora Subglacial Basin. Our ice sheet model simulations suggest that grounding line retreat is driven by sub-ice shelf basal melting, where warm ocean waters melt ice close the grounding line. We show that current estimates of basal melt are likely too low, highlighting the need for improved estimates and direct measurements of basal melt in the region.\n\nBrief communication: Precision measurement of the index of refraction of deep glacial ice at radio frequencies at Summit Station, Greenland\n\nChristoph Welling and The RNO-G Collaboration\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3433–3437, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3433-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3433-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report on the measurement of the index of refraction in glacial ice at radio frequencies. We show that radio echoes from within the ice can be associated with specific features of the ice conductivity and use this to determine the wave velocity. This measurement is especially relevant for the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), a neutrino detection experiment currently under construction at Summit Station, Greenland.\n\nSea-ice conditions from 1880 to 2017 on the Northeast Greenland continental shelf: a biomarker and observational record comparison\n\nJoanna Davies, Kirsten Fahl, Matthias Moros, Alice Carter-Champion, Henrieka Detlef, Ruediger Stein, Christof Pearce, and Marit-Solveig Seidenkrantz\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3415–3431, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3415-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3415-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we evaluate the use of biomarkers for reconstructing sea ice between 1880 and 2017 from three sediment cores located in a transect across the Northeast Greenland continental shelf. We find that key changes, specifically the decline in sea-ice cover identified in observational records between 1971 and 1984, align with our biomarker reconstructions. This outcome supports the use of biomarkers for longer reconstructions of sea-ice cover in this region.\n\nSeasonal snow cover indicators in coastal Greenland from in-situ observations, a climate model and reanalysis\n\nJorrit van der Schot, Jakob Abermann, Tiago Silva, Kerstin Rasmussen, Michael Winkler, Kirsty Langley, and Wolfgang SchÃ¶ner\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1999,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1999, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present snow data from nine locations in coastal Greenland. We show that a reanalysis product (CARRA) simulates seasonal snow characteristics better than a regional climate model (RACMO). CARRA output matches particularly well with our reference dataset when we look at the maximum snow water equivalent and the snow cover end date. We show that seasonal snow in coastal Greenland has large spatial and temporal variability and find little evidence of trends in snow cover characteristics.\n\nA reconstruction of the ice thickness of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet north of 70º S\n\nKaian Shahateet, Johannes J. FÃ¼rst, Francisco Navarro, Thorsten Seehaus, Daniel Farinotti, and Matthias Braun\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1571,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1571, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the present work, we provide a new ice-thickness reconstruction of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet north of 70º S by using inversion modeling. This model consists of two steps; the first takes basic assumptions of the rheology of the glacier, and the second uses mass conservation to improve the reconstruction where the previously made assumptions are expected to fail. Validation with independent data showed that our reconstruction improved compared to other reconstruction available.\n\nExperimental study on the shear strength and failure mechanism of mountain glacier ice\n\nMinggao Tang, Huanle Zhao, Qiang Xu, Wentao Ni, Guang Li, Zhiping Zuo, Xu Chen, and Yihua Zhong\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1522,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1522, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssessment of glacier stability relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of ice. The destruction mechanism of ice plays a crucial role in the ice avalanche process. Debris content and temperature significantly affect the shear strength of glacial ice. Fine debris ice has the highest strength among all types of ice, followed by coarse debris ice, polycrystalline ice and ice-rock composite ice.\n\nSpectral induced polarization imaging to monitor seasonal and annual dynamics of frozen ground at a mountain permafrost site in the Italian Alps\n\nTheresa Maierhofer, Adrian Flores Orozco, Nathalie Roser, Jonas K. Limbrock, Christin Hilbich, Clemens Moser, Andreas Kemna, Elisabetta Drigo, Umberto Morra di Cella, and Christian Hauck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3383–3414, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3383-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3383-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we apply an electrical method in a high-mountain permafrost terrain in the Italian Alps, where long-term borehole temperature data are available for validation. In particular, we investigate the frequency dependence of the electrical properties for seasonal and annual variations along a 3-year monitoring period. We demonstrate that our method is capable of resolving temporal changes in the thermal state and the ice / water ratio associated with seasonal freeze–thaw processes.\n\nCharacterization of in situ cosmogenic 14CO production, retention and loss in firn and shallow ice at Summit, Greenland\n\nBenjamin Hmiel, Vasilii V.

Measurements of carbon-14 in ice cores can provide a range of useful information (age of ice, past atmospheric chemistry, past cosmic ray intensity). Our results show that almost all (>99 %) of carbon-14 that is produced in the upper layer of ice sheets is rapidly lost to the atmosphere. Our results also provide better estimates of carbon-14 production rates in deeper ice.\n\nBrief communication: Not as dirty as they look, flawed airborne and satellite snow spectra\n\nEdward H.

Vuyovich, and Jeff Dozier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1681,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1681, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKey to the success of future satellite missions is understanding snowmelt in our warming climate, having implications for nearly 2 billion people. An obstacle is that an artifact, called the hook, is often mistaken for soot or dust. Instead it is caused by 3 amplifying effects: 1) a background reflectance that is too dark; 2) level terrain assumptions; 3) and differences in optical constants of ice. Sensor calibration and directional effects may also contribute. Solutions are presented.\n\nCalving front monitoring at a subseasonal resolution: a deep learning application for Greenland glaciers\n\nErik Loebel, Mirko Scheinert, Martin Horwath, Angelika Humbert, Julia Sohn, Konrad Heidler, Charlotte Liebezeit, and Xiao Xiang Zhu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3315–3332, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3315-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3315-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComprehensive datasets of calving-front changes are essential for studying and modeling outlet glaciers. Current records are limited in temporal resolution due to manual delineation. We use deep learning to automatically delineate calving fronts for 23 glaciers in Greenland. Resulting time series resolve long-term, seasonal, and subseasonal patterns. We discuss the implications of our results and provide the cryosphere community with a data product and an implementation of our processing system.\n\nGreenland's firn responds more to warming than to cooling\n\nMegan Thompson-Munson, Jennifer E. Kay, and Bradley R. Markle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3333–3350, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3333-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3333-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe upper layers of the Greenland Ice Sheet are absorbent and can store meltwater that would otherwise flow into the ocean and raise sea level. The amount of meltwater that the ice sheet can store changes when the air temperature changes. We use a model to show that warming and cooling have opposite but unequal effects. Warming has a stronger effect than cooling, which highlights the vulnerability of the Greenland Ice Sheet to modern climate change.\n\nResearch into mechanical modeling based on characteristics of the fracture mechanics of ice cutting for scientific drilling in polar regions\n\nXinyu Lv, Zhihao Cui, Ting Wang, Yumin Wen, An Liu, and Rusheng Wang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3351–3362, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3351-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3351-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, the formation process of ice chips was observed and the fracture mechanics characteristics of the ice during the cutting process were analyzed. Additionally, a mechanical model for the cutting force was established based on the observation and analysis results. Finally, influencing factors and laws of the cutting force were verified by cutting force test results generated under various experimental conditions.\n\nExtreme precipitation associated with atmospheric rivers over West Antarctic ice shelves: insights from kilometre-scale regional climate modelling\n\nElla Gilbert, Denis Pishniak, JosÃ© Abraham Torres, Andrew Orr, Michelle Maclennan, Nander Wever, and Kristiina Verro\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2111,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2111, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use 3 sophisticated climate models to examine extreme precipitation in a critical region of West Antarctica. We found that rainfall probably occurred during the two cases we examined, and that it was generated by the interaction of air with steep topography. Our results show that kilometre scale models are useful tools for exploring extreme precipitation in this region, and that more observations of rainfall are needed.\n\nTime Series Analysis of C-Band Sentinel-1 SAR Over Mountainous Snow with Physical Models of Volume and Surface Scattering\n\nFiroz Kanti Borah, Jonas-Fredrick Jans, Zhenming Huang, Leung Tsang, Hans Lievens, and Edward Kim\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1825,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1825, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we study radar data collected by Sentinel-1 over mountain regions of Alps. Using physical models of snow and soil surface scattering, we show the reasons for the high sensitivity of cross-polarized observations with snow depth. This accurate modelling for cross-pol using physical models can be then used to retrieve snow depth at for very deep snow at mountain regions using the cross-pol signal.\n\nFive decades of Abramov glacier dynamics reconstructed with multi-sensor optical remote sensing\n\nEnrico Mattea, Etienne Berthier, Amaury Dehecq, Tobias Bolch, Atanu Bhattacharya, Sajid Ghuffar, Martina Barandun, and Martin Hoelzle\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2169,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2169, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe reconstruct the evolution of terminus position, ice thickness and surface flow velocity of the reference Abramov glacier (Kyrgyzstan) from 1968 to present. We describe a front pulsation in the early 2000s and the multi-annual present-day buildup of a new pulsation. Such dynamic instabilities can challenge the representativity of Abramov as reference glacier. For our work we used satelliteâbased optical remote sensing from multiple platforms, including recently declassified archives.\n\nModeled Greenland Ice Sheet evolution constrained by ice-core-derived Holocene elevation histories\n\nMikkel Langgaard Lauritzen, Anne Munck Solgaard, Nicholas Mossor Rathmann, Bo MÃ¸llesÃ¸e Vinther, Aslak Grindsted, Brice NoÃ«l, GuÃ°finna AÃ°algeirsdÃ³ttir, and Christine SchÃ¸tt Hvidberg\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2223,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2223, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the Holocene period, which started about 11,700 years ago, through 841 computer simulations to better understand the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We accurately match historical surface elevation records, verifying our model. The simulations show that an ice bridge that used to connect the Greenland ice sheet to Canada collapsed around 4,900 years ago and still influences the ice sheet. Over the past 500 years, the Greenland ice sheet has contributed 12 millimeters to sea levels.\n\nThe radiative and geometric properties of melting first-year landfast sea ice in the Arctic\n\nNathan J.

In May 2019, we flew uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with sensors designed to quantify the sunlight that is reflected by sea ice at each wavelength over the sea ice of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. We found that snow patches get darker (up to ~ 20 %) as they get smaller, while bare patches get darker (up to ~ 20 %) as they get larger. We believe that this difference is due to melting around the edges of small features.\n\nMeasuring prairie snow water equivalent with combined UAV-borne gamma spectrometry and lidar\n\nPhillip Harder, Warren D. Helgason, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3277–3295, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3277-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3277-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote sensing the amount of water in snow (SWE) at high spatial resolutions is an unresolved challenge. In this work, we tested a drone-mounted passive gamma spectrometer to quantify SWE. We found that the gamma observations could resolve the average and spatial variability of SWE down to 22.5 m resolutions. Further, by combining drone gamma SWE and lidar snow depth we could estimate SWE at sub-metre resolutions which is a new opportunity to improve the measurement of shallow snowpacks.\n\nSpatially distributed snow depth, bulk density, and snow water equivalent from ground-based and airborne sensor integration at Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA\n\nTate G. Meehan, Ahmad Hojatimalekshah, Hans-Peter Marshall, Elias J. Deeb, Shad O'Neel, Daniel McGrath, Ryan W. Webb, Randall Bonnell, Mark S. Raleigh, Christopher Hiemstra, and Kelly Elder\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3253–3276, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3253-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3253-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow water equivalent (SWE) is a critical parameter for yearly water supply forecasting and can be calculated by multiplying the snow depth by the snow density. We combined high-spatial-resolution snow depth information with ground-based radar measurements to solve for snow density. Extrapolated density estimates over our study area resolved detailed patterns that agree with the known interactions of snow with wind, terrain, and vegetation and were utilized in the calculation of SWE.\n\nUnseasonal atmospheric river drives anomalous glacier accumulation in the ablation season of the subtropical Andes\n\nClaudio Bravo, SebastiÃ¡n Cisternas, Maximiliano Viale, Pablo Paredes, Deniz Bozkurt, and NicolÃ¡s GarcÃ­a-Lee\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1958,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1958, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed the impact of a summer snow accumulation event, linked to an atmospheric river in Central Chile. Using observational and remote sensing data, we show that accumulation prevails in all the glaciers of the Maipo River basin and this sole event defines that the Olivares Alfa glacier mass balance was close to equilibrium, despite being a dry year. This demonstrates that an unseasonal accumulation event can counteract the seasonal trends affecting subtropical Andean glaciers\n\nDual-frequency radar observations of snowmelt processes on Antarctic perennial sea ice by CFOSCAT and ASCAT\n\nRui Xu, Chaofang Zhao, Stefanie Arndt, and Christian Haas\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2054,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2054, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe onset of snowmelt on Antarctic sea ice is an important indicator of sea ice change. In this study, we used two radar scatterometers to detect the onset of snowmelt on the perennial Antarctic sea ice. It shows that since 2007, the snowmelt onset has demonstrated strong interannual and regional variabilities. We also found that the difference of snowmelt onsets between the two scatterometers is closely related to snow metamorphism.\n\nImproved basal drag of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet from L-curve analysis of inverse models utilizing subglacial hydrology simulations\n\nLea-Sophie HÃ¶yns, Thomas Kleiner, Andreas Rademacher, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Michael Wolovick, and Angelika Humbert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1251,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1251, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers' sliding over bedrock is governed by water pressure in the hydrological system underneath the glacier and the roughness of the land underneath the glacier. We estimate this roughness using a modelling approach, which optimises this unknown parameter. The water pressure is simulated, too, which improves the robustness of the computed drag at the ice sheet base. We provide this data to other modellers and scientists doing geophysical field observations.\n\nWidespread increase in discharge from west Antarctic Peninsula glaciers since 2018\n\nBenjamin J.

The speed-up began around January 2021, but some glaciers sped up earlier or later. Using a combination of ship-based ocean temperature observations and climate models, we show that the speed-up coincided with a period of unusually warm air and ocean temperatures in the region.\n\nIce sheet model simulations reveal polythermal ice conditions existed across the NE USA during the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nJoshua Cuzzone, Aaron Barth, Kelsey Barker, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2091,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2091, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an ice sheet model to simulate the Last Glacial Maximum conditions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) across the Northeast United States. A complex thermal history existed for the (LIS), that allowed for high erosion across most of the NE USA, but prevented erosion across high elevation mountain peaks and areas where ice flow was slow. This has implications for geologic studies which rely on the erosional nature of the LIS to reconstruct its glacial history and landscape evolution.\n\nTidal influence on flow dynamics of Dotson Ice Shelf, West Antarctica\n\nGabriela Collao-Barrios, Ted A.

Our results show a relation between tides, flow direction, and grounding-zone acceleration that result from changing stresses in the ice margins and around a nunatak in Dotson Ice Shelf. The study describes a new way tides can influence ice shelf dynamics, an effect that could become more common as ice shelves thin and weaken around Antarctica.\n\nIncreased Grounding Zone Ice Flux and Dynamic Thinning Creates Vulnerable Regions on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nIndrani Das, Jowan Barnes, James Smith, Renata Constantino, Sidney Hemming, and Laurie Padman\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1564,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1564, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) on the Antarctic Peninsula is currently thinning and the glaciers feeding it are accelerating. Geologic evidence indicates that GVIIS had disintegrated several thousand years ago due to ocean and atmosphere warming. Here, we use remote sensing and numerical modeling to show that strain thinning reduces buttressing of grounded ice, creating a positive feedback of accelerated ice inflow to the southern GVIIS, likely making it more vulnerable than the northern sector.\n\nObserving glacier elevation changes from spaceborne optical and radar sensors â an inter-comparison experiment using ASTER and TanDEM-X data\n\nLivia Piermattei, Michael Zemp, Christian Sommer, Fanny Brun, Matthias H.

In the present study, we compared the results produced from two different types of satellite data between different research groups and against validation measurements from aeroplanes. We found a large spread between individual results but showed that the group ensemble can be used to reliably estimate glacier elevation changes and related errors from satellite data.\n\nBrief communication: On the potential of seismic polarity reversal to identify a thin low-velocity layer above a high-velocity layer in ice-rich rock glaciers\n\nJacopo Boaga, Mirko Pavoni, Alexander Bast, and Samuel Weber\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3231–3236, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3231-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3231-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReversal polarity is observed in rock glacier seismic refraction tomography. We collected several datasets observing this phenomenon in Switzerland and Italy. This phase change may be linked to interferences due to the presence of a thin low-velocity layer. Our results are confirmed by the modelling and analysis of synthetic seismograms to demonstrate that the presence of a low-velocity layer produces a polarity reversal on the seismic gather.\n\nOptimizing rock glaciers activity classification in South Tyrol (North-East Italy): integrating multisource data with statistical modelling\n\nChiara Crippa, Stefan Steger, Giovanni Cuozzo, Francesca Bearzot, Volkmar Mair, and Claudia Notarnicola\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1511,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1511, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study, focused on South Tyrol (NE Italy), develops an updated and comprehensive activity classification system for all rock glaciers in the current regional inventory. Using multisource products, we integrate climatic, morphological and DInSAR data in replicable routines and multivariate statistical methods producing a comprehensive classification based on the updated RGIK 2023 guidelines. Results leave only 3.5% of the features non-classified respect to the 13–18.5% of the previous studies.\n\nMultiple modes of shoreline change along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea observed using ICESat-2 altimetry and satellite imagery\n\nMarnie B. Bryant, Adrian A. Borsa, Claire C. Masteller, Roger J. Michaelides, Matthew R. Siegfried, Adam P. Young, and Eric J. Anderson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1656,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1656, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measure shoreline change across a 7-km stretch of coastline on the Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast between 2019–2022 using multispectral imagery from Planet and satellite altimetry from ICESat-2. We find that shoreline change rates are high and variable, and that different shoreline types show distinct patterns of change in shoreline position and topography. We discuss how the observed changes may be driven by both time-varying ocean and air conditions and spatial variations in morphology.\n\nAssessment of Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) for High-Precision Profiles of Water Isotopes in Snow Cores\n\nRÃ©mi Dallmayr, Hannah Meyer, Vasileios Gkinis, Thomas Laepple, Melanie Behrens, Frank Wilhelms, and Maria HÃ¶rhold\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1807,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1807, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStatistical studies via extended arrays of vertical profiles have demonstrated improving the understanding of the formation, storage, and propagation of climatic signals in the snowpack. In order to cope with the large amount of analyzes needed, in this study we modify an analytical system (CFA) and analyze the resulting performances.\n\nImproving large-scale snow albedo modelling using a climatology of light-absorbing particle deposition\n\nManon Gaillard, Vincent Vionnet, Matthieu Lafaysse, Marie Dumont, and Paul Ginoux\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1795,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1795, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents an efficient method to improve large-scale snow albedo simulations by considering the spatial variability of light-absorbing particles (LAPs) like black carbon and dust. A global climatology of LAP deposition was created and used to optimize a parameter in the Crocus snow model. Testing at ten global sites improved albedo predictions by 10 % on average and over 25 % in the Arctic. This method can also enhance other snow models' predictions without complex simulations.\n\nWhat does the impurity variability at the microscale represent in ice cores? Insights from a conceptual approach\n\nPiers Larkman, Rachael H. Rhodes, Nicolas Stoll, Carlo Barbante, and Pascal Bohleber\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1723,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1723, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImpurities in ice cores can be preferentially located at the boundaries between crystals of ice, impacting the interpretation of high-resolution data collected from ice core samples. This work finds that one dimensional signals can be significantly effected by this association, meaning experiments collecting data at high resolution must be carefully designed. Accounting for this effect is important for interpreting ice core data, especially for deep ice samples.\n\nHigh-Fidelity Modeling of Turbulent Mixing and Basal Melting in Seawater Intrusion Under Grounded Ice\n\nMadeline S. Mamer, Alexander A. Robel, Chris C. K. Lai, Earle Wilson, and Peter Washam\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1970,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1970, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we simulate estuary-like seawater intrusions into the subglacial hydrologic system for marine outlet glaciers. We find the largest controls on seawater intrusion are the subglacial space geometry and meltwater discharge velocity. Further, we highlight the importance of extending ocean-forced ice loss to grounded portions of the ice sheet, which is currently not represented in models coupling ice sheets to ocean dynamics.\n\nTwo-dimensional numerical simulations of mixing under ice keels\n\nSam De Abreu, Rosalie M. Cormier, Mikhail G. Schee, Varvara E. Zemskova, Erica Rosenblum, and Nicolas Grisouard\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3159–3176, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3159-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3159-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic sea ice is becoming more mobile and thinner, which will affect the upper Arctic Ocean in unforeseen ways. Using numerical simulations, we find that mixing by ice keels (ridges underlying sea ice) depends significantly on their speeds and depths and the density structure of the upper ocean. Large uncertainties in our results highlight the need for more realistic numerical simulations and better measurements of ice keel characteristics.\n\nTower-based C-band radar measurements of an alpine snowpack\n\nIsis Brangers, Hans-Peter Marshall, Gabrielle De Lannoy, Devon Dunmire, Christian MÃ¤tzler, and Hans Lievens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3177–3193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand the interactions between C-band radar waves and snow, a tower-based experiment was set up in the Idaho Rocky Mountains. The reflections were collected in the time domain to measure the backscatter profile from the various snowpack and ground surface layers. The results demonstrate that C-band radar is sensitive to seasonal patterns in snow accumulation but that changes in microstructure, stratigraphy and snow wetness may complicate satellite-based snow depth retrievals.\n\nShort-term cooling, drying, and deceleration of an ice-rich rock glacier\n\nAlexander Bast, Robert Kenner, and Marcia Phillips\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3141–3158, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3141-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3141-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe monitor ground temperature, water pressure, and relative ice/water contents in a creeping ice-rich rock glacier in mountain permafrost to study its characteristics during a deceleration period with dry conditions and a summer heat wave. The snowpack has an important role as a provider of water and as a thermal insulator. Snow-poor winters, followed by dry summers, induce cooling and drying of the permafrost, leading to rock glacier deceleration.\n\nSpatial and temporal changes in autumn Eurasian snow cover and its relationship with the Arctic Oscillation\n\nGareth J. Marshall\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1892,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1892, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEurasian autumn snow cover (SC) can influence Northern Hemisphere weather in the following winter by affecting the Arctic Oscillation (AO) mode of atmospheric variability. We find that the relationship between the rate of October snow advance and the AO is predominantly of opposite sign between east and west Eurasia. Periods when the SC advance is strongly related to the AO, and thus might be used for weather prediction, occur when the sign of the relationship is reversed in one of the regions.\n\nSurface dynamics and history of the calving cycle of Astrolabe Glacier (AdÃ©lie Coast, Antarctica) derived from satellite imagery\n\nFloriane Provost, Dimitri Zigone, Emmanuel Le Meur, Jean-Philippe Malet, and ClÃ©ment Hibert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3067–3079, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3067-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3067-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe recent calving of Astrolabe Glacier in November 2021 presents an opportunity to better understand the processes leading to ice fracturing. Optical-satellite imagery is used to retrieve the calving cycle of the glacier ice tongue and to measure the ice velocity and strain rates in order to document fracture evolution. We observed that the presence of sea ice for consecutive years has favoured the glacier extension but failed to inhibit the growth of fractures that accelerated in June 2021.\n\nAnalyzing the sensitivity of a blowing snow model (SnowPappus) to precipitation forcing, blowing snow, and spatial resolution\n\nAnge Haddjeri, Matthieu Baron, Matthieu Lafaysse, Louis Le Toumelin, CÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Vincent Vionnet, Simon Gascoin, Matthieu Vernay, and Marie Dumont\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3081–3116, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study addresses the complex challenge of evaluating distributed alpine snow simulations with snow transport against snow depths from Pléiades stereo imagery and snow melt-out dates from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Additionally, we disentangle error contributions between blowing snow, precipitation heterogeneity, and unresolved subgrid variability. Snow transport enhances the snow simulations at high elevations, while precipitation biases are the main error source in other areas.\n\nSeasonal and diurnal variability of sub-ice platelet layer thickness in McMurdo Sound from electromagnetic induction sounding\n\nGemma M. Brett, Greg H. Leonard, Wolfgang Rack, Christian Haas, Patricia J. Langhorne, Natalie J. Robinson, and Anne Irvin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3049–3066, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3049-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3049-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacial meltwater with ice crystals flows from beneath ice shelves, causing thicker sea ice with sub-ice platelet layers (SIPLs) beneath. Thicker sea ice and SIPL reveal where and how much meltwater is outflowing. We collected continuous measurements of sea ice and SIPL. In winter, we observed rapid SIPL growth with strong winds. In spring, SIPLs grew when tides caused offshore circulation. Wind-driven and tidal circulation influence glacial meltwater outflow from ice shelf cavities.\n\nA study of sea ice topography in the Weddell and Ross seas using dual-polarimetric TanDEM-X imagery\n\nLanqing Huang and Irena Hajnsek\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3117–3140, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3117-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3117-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInterferometric synthetic aperture radar can measure the total freeboard of sea ice but can be biased when radar signals penetrate snow and ice. We develop a new method to retrieve the total freeboard and analyze the regional variation of total freeboard and roughness in the Weddell and Ross seas. We also investigate the statistical behavior of the total freeboard for diverse ice types. The findings enhance the understanding of Antarctic sea ice topography and its dynamics in a changing climate.\n\nCalibrated sea level contribution from the Amundsen Sea sector, West Antarctica, under RCP8.5 and Paris 2C scenarios\n\nSebastian H. R. Rosier, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, Adrian Jenkins, and Kaitlin A. Naughten\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1838,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1838, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlaciers in the Amundsen Sea region of Antarctica have been retreating and losing mass, but their future contribution to global sea level rise remains highly uncertain. We use an ice sheet model and uncertainty quantification methods to evaluate the probable range of mass loss from this region for two future climate scenarios and find that the rate of ice loss until 2100 will likely remain similar to present-day observations, with little sensitivity to climate scenario over this short timeframe.\n\nSuitability of the CICE sea ice model for seasonal prediction and positive impact of CryoSat-2 ice thickness initialization\n\nShan Sun and Amy Solomon\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3033–3048, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3033-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3033-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study brings to light the suitability of CICE for seasonal prediction being contingent on several factors, such as initial conditions like sea ice coverage and thickness, as well as atmospheric and oceanic conditions including oceanic currents and sea surface temperature. We show there is potential to improve seasonal forecasting by using a more reliable sea ice thickness initialization. Thus, data assimilation of sea ice thickness is highly relevant for advancing seasonal prediction skills.\n\nAssessing the key concerns in snow storage: a case study for China\n\nXing Wang, Feiteng Wang, Jiawen Ren, Dahe Qin, and Huilin Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3017–3031, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3017-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3017-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work addresses snow storage at sports facilities in China. The snow pile at Big Air Shougang (BAS) lost 158.6 m3 snow (6.7 %) during pre-competition and Winter Olympic competition days in winter 2022. There were no significant variations in the snow quality of the snow piles at BAS and the National Biathlon Center except for in the upper part of the snow piles. The 0.7 and 0.4 m thick cover layers protected half the snow height over the summer at Beijing and Chongli, respectively.\n\nReconstruction of Arctic sea ice thickness (1992–2010) based on a hybrid machine learning and data assimilation approach\n\nLÃ©o Edel, Jiping Xie, Anton Korosov, Julien Brajard, and Laurent Bertino\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1896,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1896, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study developed a new method to estimate Arctic sea ice thickness from 1992 to 2010 using a combination of machine learning and data assimilation. By training a machine learning model on data from 2011–2022, past errors in sea ice thickness can be corrected, leading to improved estimations. This approach provides insights into historical changes on sea ice thickness, showing a notable decline from 1992 to 2022, and offers a valuable resource for future studies.\n\nSea ice melt pond bathymetry reconstructed from aerial photographs using photogrammetry: a new method applied to MOSAiC data\n\nNiels Fuchs, Luisa von Albedyll, Gerit Birnbaum, Felix Linhardt, Natascha Oppelt, and Christian Haas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2991–3015, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2991-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2991-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMelt ponds are key components of the Arctic sea ice system, yet methods to derive comprehensive pond depth data are missing. We present a shallow-water bathymetry retrieval to derive this elementary pond property at high spatial resolution from aerial images. The retrieval method is presented in a user-friendly way to facilitate replication. Furthermore, we provide pond properties on the MOSAiC expedition floe, giving insights into the three-dimensional pond evolution before and after drainage.\n\nDistributed surface mass balance of an avalanche-fed glacier\n\nMarin Kneib, Amaury Dehecq, Adrien Gilbert, Auguste Basset, Evan S. Miles, Guillaume Jouvet, Bruno Jourdain, Etienne Ducasse, Luc Beraud, Antoine Rabatel, JÃ©rÃ©mie Mouginot, Guillem Carcanade, Olivier Laarman, Fanny Brun, and Delphine Six\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1733,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1733, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAvalanches contribute to increasing the accumulation on mountain glaciers by redistributing snow from surrounding mountains slopes. Here we quantified the contribution of avalanches to the mass balance of Argentière Glacier in the French Alps, by combining satellite and field observations to model the glacier dynamics. We show that the contribution of avalanches locally increases the accumulation by 60-70% and that accounting for this effect results in less ice loss by the end of the century.\n\nRapid regional assessment of rock glacier activity based on DInSAR wrapped phase signal\n\nFederico Agliardi, Chiara Crippa, Daniele Codara, and Federico Franzosi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1589,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1589, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a novel, semi-automatic methodology that combines DInSAR wrapped phase deformation signals, available information on permafrost extent, geomorphological data and multivariate statistics to characterize the state of activity of 514 periglacial landforms over 1000 km2 in Upper Valtellina (Italian Central Alps). We demonstrate the potential of raw SAR interferometric data to rapidly update periglacial landform inventories and track the evolution of the alpine cryosphere.\n\nEffect of surficial geology mapping scale on modelled ground ice in Canadian Shield terrain\n\nH. Brendan O'Neill, Stephen A. Wolfe, Caroline Duchesne, and Ryan J. H. Parker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2979–2990, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2979-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2979-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMaps that show ground ice in permafrost at circumpolar or hemispherical scales offer only general depictions of broad patterns in ice content. In this paper, we show that using more detailed surficial geology in a ground ice computer model significantly improves the depiction of ground ice and makes the mapping useful for assessments of the effects of permafrost thaw and for reconnaissance planning of infrastructure routing.\n\nQuantifying the Buttressing Contribution of Sea Ice to Crane Glacier\n\nRichard Parsons, Sainan Sun, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, Jan Wuite, and Thomas Nagler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1499,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1499, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2022, sea ice in Antarctica's Larsen B embayment disintegrated, after which time an increase in the rate at which Crane Glacier discharged ice into the ocean was observed. As the sea ice was attached to the terminus of the glacier, it could provide a resistive stress against the glacier’s ice-flow, slowing down the rate of ice discharge. We used numerical modelling to quantify this resistive stress and found that the sea ice provided significant support to Crane prior to its disintegration.\n\nCreep enhancement and sliding in a temperate, hard-bedded alpine glacier\n\nJuan-Pedro RoldÃ¡n-Blasco, Adrien Gilbert, Luc Piard, Florent Gimbert, Christian Vincent, Olivier Gagliardini, Anuar Togaibekov, Andrea Walpersdorf, and Nathan Maier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1600,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1600, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe flow of glaciers and ice sheets is due to ice deformation and basal sliding driven by gravitational forces. Quantifying the rate at which ice deforms under its own weight is critical to assessing glacier evolution. This study uses borehole instrumentation in an Alpine glacier to quantify ice deformation and constrain its viscosity in a natural setting. Our results show that the viscosity of ice at 0° C is largely influenced by interstitial liquid water which enhances ice deformation.\n\nEvidence of active subglacial lakes under a slowly moving coastal region of the Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nJennifer F. Arthur, Calvin Shackleton, Geir Moholdt, Kenichi Matsuoka, and Jelte van Oostveen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1704,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1704, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes can form beneath the large ice sheets and can influence ice-sheet dynamics and stability. Some of these subglacial lakes are active, meaning they periodically drain and refill. Here we report seven new active subglacial lakes close to the Antarctic Ice Sheet margin using satellite measurements of ice surface height changes, in a region where little was known previously. These findings improve our understanding of subglacial hydrology and will help to refine subglacial hydrological models.\n\nGrounded Ridge Detection and Characterization along the Alaskan Arctic Coastline using ICESat-2 Surface Height Retrievals\n\nKennedy A. Lange, Alice C. Bradley, Kyle Duncan, and SinÃ©ad L. Farrell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1885,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1885, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGrounded sea ice ridges stabilize nearshore sea ice by anchoring it in the seafloor. In this study, we develop a method to identify grounded ridges in satellite data, and measure the height, depth, distance from shore, and width of a thousand ridges across the Alaskan Arctic, finding regional differences in these metrics across the coastline. This method lays the groundwork for a better understanding of nearshore ice stability, holding importance for Arctic community food security and safety.\n\nSeasonality and scenario dependence of rapid Arctic sea ice loss events in CMIP6 simulations\n\nAnnelies Sticker, FranÃ§ois Massonnet, Thierry Fichefet, Patricia DeRepentigny, Alexandra Jahn, David Docquier, Christopher Wyburn-Powell, Daphne Quint, Erica Shivers, and Makayla Ortiz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1873,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1873, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for TC (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study analyses rapid Arctic sea ice loss events (RILEs), which are significant reductions in sea ice extent. RILEs are expected throughout the year, varying in frequency and duration with the seasons. Our research gives a year-round analysis of their characteristics in climate models and suggests that summer RILEs could begin before the mid-century. Understanding these events is crucial as they can have profound impacts on the Arctic environment.\n\nCC BY 4.0"
