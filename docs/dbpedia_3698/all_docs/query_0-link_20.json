        "text": "McCarthey Athletic Center or \"MAC\" is a 6,000-seat multi-purpose arena in Spokane, Washington. The arena opened in 2004. It is home to the Gonzaga University Bulldogs basketball program, and is often called \"The New Kennel\". This nickname was inherited from the school's former basketball arena, Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, popularly known as \"The Kennel,\" which had been home to the Bulldogs for 39 years. As the MAC has become the established basketball arena on campus its nickname as \"The New Kennel\" is gradually becoming \"The Kennel\" with the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre being known as the \"Martin Centre.\" For several years it was the largest basketball arena in the West Coast Conference. It lost this distinction when Brigham Young University joined in 2011, its arena, Marriott Center, seats 22,700 - more than triple the MAC capacity.\n\nThe arena's naming rights went to the McCartheys of Salt Lake City, as a result of major gifts by Gonzaga Trustee Philip McCarthey and Regent Thomas McCarthey. Both are Gonzaga alumni and former owners of The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nNot only has it hosted basketball games for the women's and men's teams, it has also served as the venue for concerts by Switchfoot, Yellowcard, Ben Folds, Jay Sean and comedians Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy.\n\nIn 2006, the West Coast Conference post-season tournament came to the McCarthey Center, marking the first time the event had ever been held in Spokane, as the original \"Kennel\" was considered too small to host the event and the larger Spokane Arena was unavailable due to annual scheduling conflicts.\n\nAfter 38 consecutive wins in the McCarthey Athletic Center and a 50-game win streak dating back to the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, Santa Clara University's Broncos ended what was, at the time, the longest home win streak in the NCAA. As of July 2, 2011, there have only been six Gonzaga mens' basketball losses in the building: Santa Clara (02/12/2007), Washington State (12/05/2007), Portland State (12/23/2008), Wake Forest (12/05/2009), San Diego State (11/16/2010) and Saint Mary's (1/27/2011).\n\nRecords\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Heather Bowman broke the West Coast Conference women's basketball all-time points record. On January 30, 2010, Heather Bowman broke the Gonzaga University women's basketball all-time points record. On March 21, 2011, Courtney Vandersloot became the first basketball player (men's or women's) to score 2000 points and tally 1000 assists in their career.\n\nNCAA Tournament\n\nIn October 2009, NCAA announced that McCarthey Athletic Center will be one of 16 locations that will host the first and second rounds of the 2011 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament.[4]\n\nReferences\n\nPreceded by\n\nCharlotte Y.
