        "text": "Services in general practice and the community are being transformed to make it easier for patients to access a wider range of help from general practice, closer to home by phone or online. When you contact our practice for an appointment, youâ€™ll often expect to speak directly with a GP in the first instance, even if that may not be the most appropriate person to help you.\n\nIn addition to the excellent non-clinical support staff, which includes practice managers, the reception and Admin team, the general practice team has expanded to include a wide range of healthcare professionals who work alongside GPs and nurses to ensure patients receive the care they need as quickly as possible. This includes Advanced Clinical Practitioners, Paramedics, clinical pharmacists, physiotherapists, social prescribing link workers and many more.\n\nEvery GP practice in Greater Manchester is different, each offering different healthcare professionals who can support delivery of your care, so you access the most appropriate care and services from the right healthcare professional.\n\nWe are a GP team\n\nWe provide a range of different roles in the wider GP practice team. We help prevent illness and offer treatment to patients with minor ailments, chronic and long-term conditions, aiming to keep them well and in their own homes.\n\nDo you know our GP practice team? Find out more about us and the different roles below."
