        "text": "Charles Russell Speechlys has advised loss adjusting and claims solutions group QuestGates and its senior management in securing an investment from Equistone Partners Europe, one of Europe’s most active mid-market private equity investors.\n\nQuestGates’ management team, led by CEO Chris Hall, will continue to lead the company and, alongside the wider team of QuestGates’ employees, will remain majority shareholders in the business. Equistone’s all equity/no debt minority investment in the company will support the continued delivery of QuestGates’ existing growth strategy.\n\nQuestGates is headquartered in Birmingham and operates out of 12 offices across the UK and Ireland. Founded in 2003, the company has evolved over the past two decades from a niche loss adjusting provider into a professional services business providing multi-disciplinary loss adjusting, claims handling, surveying, engineering and legal services. QuestGates employs circa 500 people and generated revenues of £41 million in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nChris Hall, Chief Executive Officer of QuestGates, commented:\n\nThank you to Mark and the wider team for their exceptional dedication and deep expertise. Their insightful counsel and detailed knowledge of the private equity investment process and ability to navigate the key issues and complexities have been pivotal to securing this investment for the next chapter of our growth.\n\nMark Howard, Corporate Partner, commented:\n\nWe were delighted to have supported QuestGates and its senior management through this seminal investment process. We wish them every success in the next chapter of their journey as they continue to grow and evolve their service offering."
