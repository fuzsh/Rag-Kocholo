At the time I had a lot of health issues. I wasn't at school much and when I was, I wasn't the happiest person out there. But from the day we met, Colin tried his absolute hardest to reach out to me. At the end of that year, my family pulled me out of school. I didn't see him, or most people really, until I came back for prom. I was pretty nervous about seeing everyone again and... well, at first, it didn't go so well. I was about to leave and forget the whole thing. That's when Colin walked in. He was so happy to see me. He told me he saw my name on the guest list and specifically asked if I could be seated next to him, just so I felt welcomed. He anticipated how awkward a situation that would be, and went out of his way to help me... it blew me away. It was such an act of kindness. The fact that he could touch the heart of a person who was trying to keep everyone at arm's length is a testament to how special he was. I am so glad that someone like him was so loved. And I'm so sorry that someone who shined so brightly is gone so soon. My love and condolences go out to his family and friends.\n\nEmily Chouinard - January 21, 2023 DONATION\n\nA Memorial Donation has been made to the following charity:\n\nNorthumberland Hills Hospital Foundation\n\nEmily Chouinard - January 21, 2023 DONATION\n\nA Memorial Donation has been made to the following charity:\n\nRick Hansen, Man in Motion Foundation\n\nLorri Schuetz - January 21, 2023\n\nPlease accept my sincere condolences 💐.
