        "text": "Cumbria Institute of the Arts\n\nCumbria Institute of the Arts has a long history in Carlisle which began with the establishment of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in October 1822.\n\nA new Academy of Arts was established in 1823 and in 1950 was renamed as the Carlisle College of Art. The institution was officially designated a higher education institute on 1 August 1997.\n\nTo reflect its academic growth and development, the institution gained approval from the privy council to change its name to Cumbria Institute of the Arts in 2002.\n\nThe institution was a founding member of AGHEC (Advisory Group for Higher Education in Cumbria) which was established in July 1999 by HEFCE to include the HEIs represented in Cumbria, Cumbria County Council and the North West Regional Development Agency.\n\nIn 2003, AGHEC transferred into University Education in Cumbria (UeC) working with Sir Brian Fender. The work undertaken by UeC underpins the current establishment of the University of Cumbria.\n\nFind out more about the history and legacy of the Cumbria Institute of the Arts.\n\nSt Martin's College\n\nThe Lancaster campus of the University of Cumbria started life as a barracks for the King's Own Royal Regiment and it was this association which gave the teaching college its name - St. Martin's - after a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity.\n\nWith the kind permission of the Museum for the King's Own Royal Regiment we have a gallery of images from their archive and a collection from our own.\n\nThe King’s Own Royal Regiment vacated the barracks and the site was purchased by the Church of England. Former armouries, barracks and other buildings were converted and others demolished to be replaced by new buildings designed by Charles Pike.\n\nPost-war review of teacher training led to the instigation of Lancaster College of Education 1962. The first intake of 89 students (supported by 13 staff) was in 1964.\n\nFrom the start, the college planned to teach degrees as well as Certificates of Education and pioneered the four year BA Hons with QTS. By 1966 the college was teaching PGCE students.\n\nThe college developed courses in nursing and later radiography, occupational health, social work and continuing professional development courses for health professionals. Strong relationships were forged with NHS trust training departments, and many health professionals can be seen proudly wearing both St. Martin’s and University of Cumbria badges on their uniforms to this day.\n\nThe college developed courses in humanities, arts and sport, and a mini building boom ensued in the late 1990s with the development of the Sports Centre, Humanities building, Hugh Pollard Lecture Theatre and new accommodation.\n\nIn the late 1990s St. Martin's took over the management of Charlotte Mason College in Ambleside. The London campuses followed, strengthening the emphasis on teaching.\n\nThe acquisition of the former hospital buildings at Fusehill Street in Carlisle saw the expansion of health, teaching, arts, humanities and business courses in Cumbria.\n\nThe Carlisle campus developed with new halls of residence, a sport centre and in 2006 the Learning Gateway building.\n\nIn 2006 the College embarked on its journey to secure University Title and Taught Degree Awarding Powers (TDAP). Following review by the Quality Assurance Agency the College received approval from the Privy Council on 10th July 2006 in respect of TDAP.\n\nThe College then as part of the establishment of the University of Cumbria applied for university title and a change in name after gaining Taught Degree Awarding Powers (TDAP). The Privy Council confirmed its approval and change of name to University of Cumbria with effect from 1st August 2007.\n\nCharlotte Mason\n\nBorn in 1842, Charlotte Mason was an experienced school teacher who passionately believed in the importance of education for all members of society regardless of gender or social class. Charlotte’s philosophy was that children should be valued as people and should be educated through real situations.\n\nAfter 15 years of teaching at primary level, Charlotte began to publish her ideas on childhood education and subsequently published regularly in Parents' Review. In 1891 she moved to Ambleside and set up a training school.\n\nAfter her death the school was managed by the county until the 1990’s when it became part of Lancaster University. St. Martin’s College took over the management of the college in the late 1990s.\n\nDuring this period the Charlotte Mason building was built; a home for the library and student resources. At the same time outdoor courses were developed from Hill Top building and business courses at the former Kelsick School building, a short distance from the main campus.\n\nAmbleside continues to host courses in outdoors, business, leadership and sustainability.\n\nFor more information on Charlotte Mason’s heritage visit the Armitt Website."
