        "text": "Arsenal provided a reminder to Bayer Leverkusen of the quality that is coming their way in the UEFA Champions League this season as the Gunners beat the undefeatable Bundesliga champions and comfortably so. Mikel Arteta's side completely dominated their opponents, particularly in the first half, on their way to a confidence-boosting victory.\n\nAlex Zinchenko opened the scoring with a low drive before Leandro Trossard finished off a beautiful passing move. Gabriel Jesus got the third following a stunning and seemingly never-ending run from his own half with a finish to match, while Kai Havertz added a fourth in the second half - much thanks to Xhaka.\n\nThe game was not televised on the usual platforms and so plenty of interesting elements from the clash were missed by those not in the ground.football.london thankfully were and give a look behind the scenes at what we spotted that others might have seen pass them by.\n\nGranit Xhaka reception\n\nOne of the narratives of the day was how fans would react to seeing Granit Xhaka back at the Emirates Stadium. Having spent the majority of his time here one would think it would of course be positive. However, there were of course some darker times at the club which have stuck for some.\n\nHowever, as his name was read out over the tannoy there were gleeful cheers and applause from the fans inside the stadium. There was a full tribute from the stadium announcer once the teams were out, which didn't get even a flicker from the midfielder at the time who was in full-focus game mode.\n\nDuring the game, he broke the demeanour on a few occasions. However, as Thomas Partey entered the field, they both shared a familiar embrace, reuniting the partnership they shared during their three years together at the club.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal first half ratings vs Bayer Leverkusen as Jesus, Trossard, Havertz and Zinchenko impress\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal vs Bayer Leverkusen LIVE: Havertz hits fourth after Zinchenko, Trossard and Jesus goals\n\nZinchenko imitation\n\nZinchenko has come under some scrutiny from supporters, especially with the arrival of Riccardo Calafiori. However, he showcased exactly what he is capable of in the final third as he ghosted into an empty space on the edge of the box to slam in the opening goal.\n\nThe cross came from Kai Havertz but it was a dummy from Leandro Trossard which opened up the space for the Ukrainian. In thanks, Zinchenko offered up his gratitude in the form of a celebration inspired by his Belgian teammate.\n\nHe ran over to the West Stand and brought his hands to his eyes as binoculars. A familiar sight to fans but not so much from the new Arsenal No.17.\n\nHalf-time words\n\nZinchenko comes across as a very serious individual and that rarely drops besides when celebrating goals. That was again apparent at half-time in the game between the two sides as when the first period ended, he went straight to teammate Gabriel Magalhaes.\n\nThe pair were locked in a stern conversation about a passage of play. Even though this was just a friendly, each individual moment is looked at as a potential point for development individually.\n\nHaving just changed his squad number, despite speculation, it appears he is staying. While having some defensive flaws, his presence in the squad is felt and he remains one of the key leaders in the group and will continue to provide that characteristic."
