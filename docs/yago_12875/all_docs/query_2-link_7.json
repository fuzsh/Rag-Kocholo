        "meta_description": "Everybody&#39;s Famous by Alex Exists, released 06 November 2023\n\n1. Believe The Hype\n2. With A Bang\n3. Cameraboy\n4. Dancing With Chaos\n5. Mindful Madness\n6. Free To Run\n7. Instant Karma\n8. Eveybody&#39;s Famous (Except Me)\n\nEverybody&#39;s Famous is a unique set of stories about the complex and often absurd nature of human behavior, and the need to express our truth and full potential. The tension between these themes fuels the energy and vibe of the album, which blends rebellious, grungy, glammy, punky, and psychedelic sounds. The satirical lyrics and energizing beats create a sound that&#39;s both passionate and uplifting. With this album, I aim to inspire listeners to navigate the complex social dynamics that shape our lives, and to never stop striving for something better. The message is clear: we have the power to change what we don&#39;t like and the obligation to improve life for each other or else risk being trapped in the warped reality that these songs illustrate. Everybody&#39;s Famous is a must-listen for anyone who craves music that&#39;s powerful, fun and thought-provoking.",

I gave you everything Will it ever be enough? You better believe it! No sympathy for the spotlight I don’t I don’t I don’t (believe the hype) Birds of paradise rolling snake eyes I don’t I don’t don’t (believe the hype) You better believe it it’s coming down fast Turning me into digital ash Somebody’s treasure another’s trash Answer the questions take off the mask Believe the hype Reject idolatry mundane modernity Things don’t need to be right to be true Racing to the bottom hive mind is getting rotten I hear the buzz but the taste nothing new What gives authority to question who we love? I gave you everything Will it ever be enough? You better believe it! No sympathy for the spotlight I don’t I don’t I don’t (believe the hype) Birds of paradise rolling snake eyes I don’t I don’t don’t (believe the hype) You better believe it it’s coming down fast Turning me into digital ash Somebody’s treasure another’s trash Answer the questions take off the mask Believe the hype Do do do do do, do do do do do, hahaha\n\n2.\n\nWith A Bang 03:19\n\nI blew you a kiss you blew me away I taught you to hunt you made me the prey Lips like venom always leaving me drained I’m crawling back looking somewhat deranged Can’t find the lock must we really be chained? No matter what they try we can’t be tamed You say it wouldn’t be this way forever But now it’s clear that it doesn't stop You keep on saying now or never I’ll be waiting here till I drop Now the final act is up Of the terminal lovers So let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang (bang) At each other throats with a bloody bouquet Love is the drug and we medicate Always gotta be right Make problems larger than life Rattled and ready to fight Bringing out my dramatic side! He’s got a few loose screws she obsessed with her blues They got opposing views celebrating nothing to lose You say it wouldn’t be this way forever But now it’s clear that it doesn't stop You keep on saying now or never I’ll be waiting here till I drop Now the final act is up Of the terminal lovers So let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang (bang) Go ahead take a bite Surviving purely out of spite One last prick of your fangs If that’s all there is Let’s go out with a bang! So let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang (bang) Let’s go out with a bang, bang, bang, yeah\n\n3.\n\nCameraboy 03:53\n\nCaught up in your lens again Another day playing pretend Getting shot and chasing trends Posing for the bitter end I bet that that finger on the trigger must feel so good Come shoot me again like a camera boy should Staring down the barrel Blowing smoke hearts in the light Oh you think you’ve captured me Haha you must be joking right?! Camera boy always playing with a human toy Do you like what you see? Does it fill that void? Camera boy Fill the void With your camera I took the shots I made my bed Wondering why I’m still not dead A mouse in a lovely frame The cat plays anamorphic games I bet that finger on the trigger gets ya feeling like a god Camera’s the only thing that your ever turning Staring down the barrel Blowing smoke hearts in the light Oh you think you’ve captured me Haha you must be joking right?! Camera boy always playing with a human toy Do you like what you see? Does it fill that void? Camera Taking pictures to prove you existed I’m timeless don’t get it twisted Taking pictures to prove you existed I’m timeless don’t get it twisted Camera boy always playing with a human toy Do you like what you see? Does it fill that void? Camera boy with a human toy Camera boy fill the void Camera boy\n\n4.\n\nDancing With Chaos 03:05\n\nSomeday hangover morning Got the jackhammers, cars slammin’ Trying to get me going Head rings like a chainsaw As I’m trying to take it chill Stirring pills in my mocha Menace all around every inch of this town I’m just trying to keep it together I’m just looking for a sign that I haven’t lost my mind Need to decompress the pressure When the world is on fire And we’re walking on the wire Surrendering and letting go Of your illusion of control Another dance with chaos Dancing with chaos Dancing with chaos Could you be my magic genie? Cause the vibe down here Isn’t making this easy Chemicals got me glowin’ Getting high as hell Off the gas fumes flowin’ Looking for a spot to be myself don’t need a lot Where the scene isn't batshit crazy I keep looking for a place where my mind could catch a break And be ripping with no worries When the world is on fire And we’re walking on the wire Surrendering and letting go Of your illusion of control Another dance with chaos Dancing with chaos Dancing with chaos When the world is on fire And we’re walking on the wire Surrendering and letting go Of your illusion of control Another dance with chaos\n\n5.\n\nMindful Madness 04:50\n\nRound and round we go again and it’s never clearer Help me believe, it’s not pretend in my magic mirror Rolled all my coins down in the slot it’s a carnival nature Sucking atomic lollipops Hijacked sanity for ransom Forced to sing your new world anthems This ride’s never coming to an end My weapons of mass seduction Wreckquiems for your destruction flick this lighter if you wanna burn I don’t care who’s watching It’s not like we get freedom that often Too much to think? Let me simplify it if you bleed they will drink Faith in suspicions truth in your fictions One last caress oh take me mindful madness Come on Come on take me mindful madness The hand that feeds tastes so yucky Must we be that daft to get this lucky? Don’t need the sympathy or attention Long live my enemies art is my weapon Righteousness and puppet masters staged attacks and crisis actors I don’t know who to believe at all Censored stories, hacks and death threats Security or surveillance? Damned if we do anything at all I don’t care who’s watching It’s not like we get freedom that often Too much to think? Let me simplify it if you bleed they will drink Faith in suspicions truth in your fictions One last caress oh take me mindful madness Come on Come on take me mindful madness I’m no preacher but convince me that life’s not a serial killer Maybe you’re right but all deer secretly love the headlights Subliminal creatures, secret believers Possessed obsessed take me mindful madness Come on Come on take me mindful madness Take me mindful madness Take me mindful madness\n\n6.\n\nFree To Run 03:35\n\nOne down here comes another Doesn't really matter if you're outnumbered Genetic arcade, psychic hunter Coming for ya is it really any wonder? They’ll always be the winner Only love ya when ur wrapped around their finger Sit down, come take a number and wait for the kill Did ya really think you had us falling for you? Those wicked games never played through Blowing up the benefit of being under your thumb I’m the bullet she’s the gun Free to run Free to run Free to run Now we’re going undercover I love my baby and we’re always on the run ya Don’t try to steal my thunder A pretty picture doesn't cut it any longer By now I must be a monster Don’t even know why you still want me any longer Sit down, come take a number and wait for the kill Did ya really think you had us falling for you? Those wicked games never played through Blowing up the benefit of being under your thumb I’m the bullet she’s the gun Free to run Free to run Free to run\n\n7.\n\nInstant Karma 03:48\n\nInstant Karma's gonna get you Gonna knock you right on the head You better get yourself together Pretty soon you're gonna be dead What in the world are you thinking of? Laughing in the face of love What on earth you tryin' to do It's up to you, yeah you!
