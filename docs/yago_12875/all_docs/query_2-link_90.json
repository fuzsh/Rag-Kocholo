        "text": "LOVE EVERYONE (also known as 500 Days in UCLA and Hitler) is an unreleased studio album by Kanye West that was recorded and produced during the Wyoming sessions. However, the album underwent significant changes in early May of 2018 and was ultimately scrapped in favor of ye, which was officially released on June 1, 2018.\n\nBackground[]\n\nImmediately after releasing The Life Of Pablo in February 2016, Kanye announced on Twitter that his eighth studio album would be titled Turbo Grafx 16, named after the video game console of the same name. It was said that the project would have video game sound (fitting the name), with artists such as Tyler, The Creator, Travis Scott, and Nas seen in some studio pictures in the period the album was worked on. However, the album would later be scrapped.\n\nInstead, Kanye embarked on his Saint Pablo Tour to promote TLOP. It was a massive success until Kim Kardashian's robbery in Paris, France in October 2016. Throughout several performances after the robbery, Kanye began going on several rants, the most infamous of which happening on November 19. At the show, Kanye performed three songs before going on an infamous 25-minute rant about Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and even Kanye's former collaborators Jay-Z and Beyonc√©. He ended the show early and cancelled the rest of the tour altogether.[1] Shortly after, he was admitted to the UCLA Medical Center for psychiatric observation.\n\nIn 2017, Kanye bought a mountain ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, thus beginning the famous Wyoming sessions. He worked with several artists during these sessions, including Teyana Taylor, Pusha T, Drake, Big Sean, and more. Throughout the sessions, Kanye also began working on his next studio album. On April 19, 2018, he announced that his new solo project would release on June 1, and his collaborative album with Kid Cudi would release the following week.[2] On April 28, Kanye shared a screenshot of a conversation he had with someone. In the screenshot, Kanye revealed that the album cover would be a mugshot of Dr. Jan Adams, the doctor that gave a plastic surgery to Donda West just one day before her death. When he asked what the album would be titled, the other person responded: \"LOVE EVERYONE\".[3] Kanye went on to release two singles, \"Lift Yourself\" (April 27) and \"Ye vs. the People\" (April 28). On the same day, Dr. Jan Adams wrote a letter to Kanye demanding that he doesn't use his mugshot as the album cover. Kanye thanked Jan for the letter.[4]\n\nThe LOVE EVERYONE era came to a controversial end on May 1, 2018. He was interviewed by TMZ, and in the interview, Kanye infamously stated that slavery was a \"choice\", which caused immediate backlash.[5] Two weeks before the was set to release, Mike Dean recalled that one day, Ye came in the studio, erased the whiteboard with the track list, and announced that they were starting over. Eventually, the project turned into ye.[6]\n\nSongs[]\n\nLOVE EVERYONE is considered infamous by fans because of the offensive nature of the songs that were made during this era. The biggest example of this is an unreleased song titled \"DJ Khaled's Son\", in which Ye says several slurs directed at gay people, women, and Hispanic people, among others. Several leakers have revealed lyrics for unreleased songs that were made during the LOVE EVERYONE sessions, many of which include themes of his support for Trump, the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, and rape.[7][8]\n\nYe only released three singles during this era. The first single is titled \"BED YEEZY SEASON 5\" and was released exclusively onto Soundcloud on February 28, 2017. It is a cover of J. Holiday's song, \"Bed\", sung by The-Dream. The second single is titled \"Lift Yourself\" and was released on April 27, 2018. It was revealed later on that Ye decided to release the song with nonsensical lyrics to troll Drake. A day later, Ye released the third and final single of this era, titled \"Ye vs. the People\". In the song, Ye debates with T.I. over his support for then-U.S. president Donald Trump, which many people criticized Ye for.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nNearly every song from ye originated from the LOVE EVERYONE sessions. The song, \"Brothers\", was reworked into \"Violent Crimes\", but after ye released, it was revealed that Ye kept working on \"Brothers\" in the Yandhi sessions. However, it was eventually scrapped.\n\nIn \"Ye vs. the People\", Ye said that him becoming a Republican showed that black people and white people should start loving each more other. He also stated that T.I. was on \"some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit\". Even after LOVE EVERYONE was scrapped, Ye continued spreading these sentiments. During his speech on Saturday Night Live on September 29, 2018, Ye revealed that people made fun of Ye for wearing the MAGA hat backstage and told people to \"try love\".[9] To kick off the new year in 2019, Ye stated in a tweet that he loved Drake, despite going on a rant about him the prior month.[10] Ye didn't return to the concept of loving your enemies until his infamous interview on InfoWars on December 1, 2022. During the interview, Ye stated that he loved Hitler because \"Jesus teaches that we should love everyone\".[11]\n\nTrack lists[]\n\nOn May 15, 2018, Ye posted a track list for his upcoming eighth studio album. While the whiteboard says \"YE\", it's likely that the album was still titled LOVE EVERYONE at this time because the other whiteboards features the artists' names as well instead of the album names.[12]\n\n[BLANK]\n\n\"Extacy\"\n\n\"Wouldn't Leave\"\n\n[BLANK]\n\n[BLANK]\n\n[BLANK]\n\n[BLANK]\n\nA leaked track list for LOVE EVERYONE was leaked on March 19, 2022. It is considered the last known LOVE EVERYONE-era track list.[13] For unknown reasons, \"Wouldn't Leave\" is written twice.\n\n\"Freeee\"\n\n\"Extacy\"\n\n\"Pussy Mine\"\n\n\"Wouldn't Leave\"\n\n\"Thirty Mile Zone\"\n\n\"Moonlight\"\n\n\"Violent Nights\"\n\n\"Wouldn't Leave\"\n\n\"Y'all Seen Ye?\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"Lift Yourself\" were also seen on the track list, although they weren't placed anywhere."
