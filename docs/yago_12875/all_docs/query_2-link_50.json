        "text": "Toronto’s The Nursery have had a pretty good 2016. The band released their debut EP, toured Canada and the Northeastern United States, and took home awards for Best Indie Band and Best Music Video at the Toronto Independent Music Awards for their video “Digital Ashes”.\n\nWe are pleased to premiere The Nursery’s brand new video for “Everybody’s Famous,” from the band’s forthcoming debut LP. The song explores toxic celebrity culture, double lives, gender politics, and the modern obsession with fame. It was directed by Canadian artist Genevieve Blais.\n\n“‘Everybody’s Famous’ is about the manic and warped obsessions of seeking attention through inauthentic means,” said Alex Pulec of The Nursery. “Social media tools are continually serving as a painkiller to pacify this twisted need to elevate our social statues to unrealistic heights. Fame should be the by-product of being remarkable at something — never the goal.”\n\n“Everybody’s Famous” is the first single off of The Nursery’s upcoming LP Life After Wartime, out early 2017."
