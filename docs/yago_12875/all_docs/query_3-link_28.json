        "text": "Have you ever considered volunteering your skills? Skills based volunteering is not so widely advertised, but many businesses collaborate with charities in this way to give back on a more strategic level. It's a form of volunteering where people use professional skills such as HR, marketing, or finance on a voluntary basis to help a non profit organisation. This might be working through organisational challenges, mentoring, coaching, and even becoming trustees to share professional skills and networks. This new report by the Lloyds Bank Foundation does a great job of highlighting the benefits of this approach to volunteering ➡ https://lnkd.in/eGtGqY6Z As a skills based volunteer you gain: >> 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 - developing new and existing skills ✍ >> 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 - valuing skills you might take for granted, after experiencing how valuable they are to other organisations💡 >> 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 - helping to solve challenges in society as a team 🤝 If your organisation has a set of skills you think would help Action Tutoring tackle educational inequality, it would be great to see how we could collaborate! Drop me a message to explore opportunities.😊 #Volunteering #SkillsBasedVolunteering #VolunteersWeek2024\n\nAt HelloPrint, we believe in giving back to our community. Our commitment to volunteering goes beyond just words; we aim (and allow!) for each employee to dedicate 24 hours a year to community service. In 2023 we've initiated these efforts, starting with monthly cooking sessions at the Ronald McDonald Huis Sophia Rotterdam. This year we’re ramping up and introduced new initiatives like happiness walks with elderly people, partnering with JINC, as well as working with the local Voedselbank Rotterdam. While many companies offer volunteer time off, only a few employees make use of this opportunity. Why? Resources are not provided by the company. At HelloPrint, we proactively schedule and organize activities to ensure our team members can make a meaningful difference. Volunteering is not only beneficial for our local community but it also opens our eyes to the realities around us. For example, we've come to understand the loneliness that many elderly people face or the financial struggles that prevent some from accessing food. These experiences teach us (or.. at least me!) gratitude. And it's a powerful reminder to appreciate what we have and to consider how we can make a positive impact. I've created a video to share a few moments from yesterday’s volunteering at the Voedselbank, in a way to inspire you to give back too. PS. This is not me acting like I hold a microphone 🎤 PPS. I am a professional in sustainability, not in video editing ;-) 📽 Yesterday's team existed of Sara, Jesse, Maxim, Letizia - thanks to Lizzy for organising everything. #sustainability #volunteering #localcommunity #givingback #helloprint"
