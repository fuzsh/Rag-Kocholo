        "text": "Cinema of Belgium refers to the films made within Belgium, or by Belgium directors. While the invention of the cinématographe by the French Lumière brothers is widely regarded as the birth of cinema, a number of developments in photography preceded the advent of film. Among the people pioneering work on animation devices was a Belgian professor of experimental physics Joseph Plateau. Plateau invented an early stroboscopic device in 1836, the \"phenakistiscope\".\n\nThe first public projection in Belgium took place on March 1, 1896 at the Kings Gallery in Brussels. In the following years there was a surge in activity, initially dominated by the French industrial Charles Pathé. One of his assistants, Alfred Machin founded the first production studio in 1910; some of his films are still preserved in the Royal Filmarchive in Brussels. The first Belgian movie producer was Hippolyte De Kempeneer, who produced several interesting films until his studio burned down in 1923.\n\nThe 1930s saw the first serious attempt at cinema. Several prominent figures such as Charles Dekeukeleire and Henri Storck experimented with new filming techniques and founded the Belgian Documentary School, which was long regarded as one of the highlights of Belgian Cinema. With the advent of sound, directors such as Jan Vanderheyden fully explored the possibilities of the medium.\n\nBelgian cinema finally took flight during the 1990s and forward, gaining international prominence with such films as Man Bites Dog [1992), Daens (1992), and Everybody Famous! (2000).\n\nBelgium has been short-listed several times for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.\n\nBest International Feature Film Nominations[]\n\n43rd Academy Awards, 1970\n\nPeace in the Fields — Jacques Boigelot\n\n61st Academy Awards, 1988\n\nThe Music Teacher — Gérard Corbiau\n\n65th Academy Awards, 1992\n\nDaens — Stijn Coninx\n\n67th Academy Awards, 1994\n\nFarinelli — Gérard Corbiau\n\n73rd Academy Awards, 2000\n\nEverybody's Famous — Dominique Deruddere\n\n84th Academy Awards, 2011\n\nBullhead — Michaël R.
