        "text": "''Love Is a Dog From Hell'' was shown as part of the recent New Directors/New Films festival. Following are excerpts from Walter Goodman's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 18. The film opened yesterday at the Waverly, Avenue of the Americas at Third Street.\n\nFor a movie that starts with voyeurism, advances to acute acne and concludes with a bout of necrophilia, ''Love Is a Dog From Hell'' is a remarkably innocent romance.\n\nDominique Deruddere, a 31-year-old Belgian director, found the idea for his full-length feature in the stories of Charles Bukowski. Mr. Deruddere first did a short movie based on Mr. Bukowski's account of a man making love to a dead woman, then worked his way back to the youth of the necrophiliac, here called Harry Voss. The interpretation of how Harry got that way is a bit pat, but the three matched sections of the final work are filled with such sympathy for his longings that they compel understanding.\n\nWe meet Harry in the 1950's, his handsome 12-year-old head bubbling with movie-screen romances, but when it comes to flesh-and-blood women he is defeated first by his shyness, then by his audacity."
