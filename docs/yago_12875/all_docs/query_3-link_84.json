With nowhere to go and the cops closing in on the hotel fast, he wanders into \"Suite 16\" in a fit of despair. Inside, a handicapped and wheelchair bound Glover is held captive for the evening once discovered by Chris. However, things change the next day when Glover informs Chris that the woman he slept with is now dead; and that he surely will be sought out for her murder. Lonely and bored, Glover offers to shelter Chris for awhile while the cuts and bruises from the previous nights escapades have time to heal.",

        "text": "Viewed with the Amazing Edith’s *Collab Film Group*.\n\nI remember my first time.\n\nWith a hooker?\n\nNo, a woman—Well a girl. I didn’t know what to expect. I was 16, and 16 in those days was... 16.\n\nSuite 16 is a provocative, grimy piece of Euro-trash handled with eloquence. The film boasts a plot that hinges on Chris' (Antonie Kamerling) physicality and Glover's (Pete Postlethwaite) general ambiguity. What ensues is something that could have turned into an even further digression of sex and nudity just to show excessive sex and nudity but instead turns itself into a mature (yet perverse) outlook of youth vs old age, ability vs inability, dependence vs independence, twisted into a vicious knot of cat and mouse.…\n\n1st Dominique Deruddere\n\nA perfectly acceptable little erotic thriller that thinks a little too highly of itself. It concerns the increasingly disturbing relationship between a young amoral hustler and a disabled man who protects him from facing a murder charge in the titular suite. Unable to experience the sensual pleasures he so craves, Postlethwaite's rich recluse pays the hustler to bed a number of women so he can vicariously experience his hedonism. Of course, there are the various power struggles between the two men as the hustler becomes the servant of the man he took advantage of, but you can see the plot points coming down the highway. Indeed, I even came up with some better ones along the way,…\n\nSex with the headless corpse of the virgin astronaut revisited.\n\nIt’s been twenty years since I last viewed Suite 16 – a mid-90s erotic thriller about a paraplegic manipulating a homicidal gigolo. This was rewatched for the Collab. Sexually charged thrillers witnessed in teens will rarely have the same resonance, but I was delighted to discover that one of the credited writers is Lisa Mayer. Ms. Mayer is one of the brilliant minds behind the BBC series the Young Ones, whose love I previously confessed to in the group’s Island of Death watch. Suite 16 is played straight enough that it’s a far cry from the pitch-black humour I associate with Mayer, but the grotesque human relationships remain very much…\n\nThere’s a montage of sorts in Suite 16 featuring a procession of call girls being bedded by our virile young protagonist, with each woman appearing nude, and mid-coitus, for a few seconds (a total of sixteen women are credited as prostitutes). As I watched the sequence (despite the subject matter, the film, by design, offers little in the way of erotic stimulation) all I could think was, how did these actors tell their parents about this?\n\nNow, granted, being raised in the conservative Midwest, my sensibilities can admittedly lean toward the more prudish - and this is a European production (you saucy manxes) - but still... what’s the protocol here?\n\nDo you come at it with the whole “art is…\n\nI don’t mind movies about despicable people at all. I wince when I read the standard criticism, “I couldn’t relate to [alt: care about] any of the characters.” **\n\nIt's partly our job to meet the film halfway, to invest, to get off the couch and walk over to the work, not to be hand-fed easily digestible characters.\n\nHowever, what if the characters are despicable AND they’re boring? Ahahhh! Now we’re really on to something very... very, well, meh.\n\nI never once felt the themes of voyeurism here were anything but surface level and the disability angle is nothing more than situational.\n\nPete Postlethwaite goes to eleven on the actor dial, but it’s cool, at least his performance gives the…\n\nChris is young, and has the world wrapped around his finger. He hooks himself to older ladies, ones who are too weak or ashamed to stop him when he robs or abuses them, because he himself is just a façade. He is the epitome of male bravado, strutting around looking like he's playing the role of Baby Sting in \"Jim Henson's New Wave Babies\". He does what he wants, he takes what he wants, and people that disagree with him catch a glass bottle in the head.\n\nBut when Chris meets up with a strong woman (I wonder what made Chris decide to bed this one, instead of just straight up robbing her, like the woman in the opening?), he…\n\nDutch directed, British/American written & filmed in France, Suite 16 is a little erotic thriller about an undeclared gigolo/thief whom—after accidentally killing a woman in a swanky hotel, he flees to a disabled man's penthouse to hide, but is eventually caught up in a strange erotic game that he's ill-prepared for.\n\npros:\n\n- a lot smarter than I initially perceived it to be, with a few unexpected turns, that dealt with psychosexual issues that I haven't seen touched on in a lot of movies of that era, or even today.\n\n- \"You want me to be your dick.\"-great line or greatest line?\n\n- Pete is great (as always!)\n\n- but Antonie Kamerling impresses as the self-assertive, gives-no-fucks, European hardbody. Dude is…\n\nBy nature of being divided up between so many language barriers and political movements, the film industry in Belgium is not as national or unified as many other countries' film movements, and the amount of auteurs to stake their claim in a country composed of three separate language communities is fairly small as a result. One such auteur is\n\nDominique Deruddere, notable for entering the world of film with a controversial Bukowski adaptation and has been chugging along ever since, remaining fairly obscure in most circles but still regarded as a crown jewel in his home country, even so far as to receive funding from a legend like Francis Ford Coppola for his second film. His other films will have…\n\nA young man called Chris (Antonie Kamerling) plagued by bad life choices, seduces older women to rob them, but when one of his giggolo-stick-ups goes wrong he flees the scene of the crime and stumbles into the penthouse suite of a wealthy, disabled man called Glover (Pete Postlethwaite), who offers him refuge. Soon they get tangled up in a game of increasing sexual and doubtful moral activity, with escalating stakes and tension, where Glover wants Chris to act out his fantasies while he watches, but thing quickly turn nasty.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with the premise of this film (in fact it is a pretty good one), but I found it almost immediately frustrating since I did not feel…\n\nThis movie takes place in a depressingly simplistic world, one in which no one can be sexually penetrated by anything that's not a penis, a man's inability to feel love is linked to the fact that he's in a wheelchair, and we need musical cues to tell us when something is powerful and affecting.\n\nI honestly wish there had been more to deal with here -- that Dominique Deruddere's film had forced a real confrontation of personal assumptions or judgements about the sexual practices about others. Instead, it mostly just felt fake deep, as if we were being lectured by someone who suddenly found out that people can be assholes, and that some of them even engage in sexual practices…\n\nfucking boring looking, and boring looking fucking. Pete Postlethwaite getting all bonkers with it doesn’t elevate this above tedious trash, which is my least favorite kind of trash. if I want to watch the torrid, isolated mystery of horny dudes muttering quasi-existentialism in between bouts of thirst, I’ll just watch The Lighthouse again — zing — and not something as utterly zero as this. that said, I got fucknuts high about halfway through and wrote this;\n\nA Postelthwaite, Apostle’s Wait\n\nMan’s gone and fucked the gate\n\nWith no ingress, he’s got some stress\n\nI have no idea what that means, and I don’t think it’s a Coleridge moment. I blame a hybrid strain called Cherry Thunder. Which I think is…"
