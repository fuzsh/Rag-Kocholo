        "text": "Every now and then you see a little film and despite what you've read you just find yourself enchanted. The Belgian film \"Everybody's Famous\" is one such film. The story may be improbable and the film may have a light touch, but it entertained this viewer for 90 minutes.\n\nJean Vereechen (Josse De Pauw) is a 40-something factory worker who writes songs by humming to himself as he inspects the bottles that pass him in the assembly line on the night shift. In the morning he returns home, tapes the songs and sings them to his shy, overweight daughter Marva (Eva Van Der Gucht) and tortured wife Chantal (Gert Portael) over breakfast.\n\nJean wants to be a songwriter so that he can write hits for Marva (who has the same name as a famous departed Belgian songstress), who loves to sing and hopes to become a star. Unfortunately, she views the path to this career as one local talent show after another, where she performs \"Material Girl\" dressed as Madonna, alongside Otis Redding impersonators in black face.\n\nWhen the judges give her consistently low scores, Marva and her father are disappointed and Marva, despite her desire to succeed as a performer, is stressed by her father's efforts to help her along.\n\nWhen the factory closes, Jean and his co-worker friend Willy Van Outvever (Werner De Smedt) try to hide the fact from their families. One day while out killing time, pretending to be at work, Jean encounters Belgian singing sensation Debbie (Thekla Reuten), whose visage has been on TV nightly and on every teen and gossip magazine cover.\n\nJean kidnaps her and convinces Willy to get in on the act, and the movie is up and running. All manner of shenanigans ensue -- including a wonderfully cynical subplot involving Debbie's sleazy manager -- but I won't detail them here as they are as entertaining as they are serpentine, and I don't want to give it all away.\n\nThere are a few shortcomings here, like the complete improbability of much of the plot and the fact that the overweight Marva is often shown munching fatty snack foods or with her mouth overstuffed with food (we would have gotten the point even without sinking to this level), \"Everybody's Famous\" is a rollicking ride and an endearing little film that recalls the great \"King of Comedy.\" It probably won't win any awards, but it'll brighten your life for a little while.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n\"Everybody's Famous\" opens Fri., Aug. 3 at Landmark's Downer Theatre."
