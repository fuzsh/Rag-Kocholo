        "text": "Agnès Varda (French: [aɲɛs vaʁda]; 30 May 1928 – 29 March 2019) was a Belgian-born French film director, photographer and artist. Her work was pioneering for, and central to, the development of the widely influential French New Wave film movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Her films focused on achieving documentary realism, addressing feminist issues, and/or producing other social commentary, with a distinctive experimental style. Varda's work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of landscapes, rather than the real thing. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional in the context of 1950s French cinema. Among other awards and nominations, she received an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, an Academy Honorary Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nAlex Agnew (born December 22, 1972) is a Belgian stand-up comedian and hard rock vocalist. According to the Nigel Williams autobiography \"Had ik maar een vak geleerd\" (\"If Only I'd Learned a Proper Trade\"), Alex was already an established comedian in Belgium since at least the 1999-2000 season. This is somewhat contradicted by the 2011 show \"Larger than Life\", celebrating \"the best of Agnew 10 years on stage\". Undisputedly however, he attained nationwide fame when he became the first Belgian to win the prestigious Dutch Leids Cabaret Festival in February 2003.After this initial success he has been performing in comedy shows like De Bovenste Plank and Comedy Casino on the Belgian television channel Canvas. Agnew is the son of an English father, footballer John Agnew, and a Flemish mother. He is influenced by action movies, superheroes, comic books and a great variety of music, ranging from Tom Jones and musicals to heavy metal and the new-age music his sister played. His \"rock 'n' roll comedy\" (as he himself calls it) is mostly a mix of blue comedy and the production of sound effects, similar to Dutch-Moroccan comedian Najib Amhali. Besides his comedy activities, he is also the lead vocalist of hard rock band Diablo Blvd. His first solo comedy show, \"KA-BOOM!\", spanned the whole 2005-2006 season. Early 2007 Agnew kicked off his new show, \"Morimos Solamente\". He toured Belgium with the show \"More Human than Human\" in the 2009-2010 season. After filling up the Antwerp Sportpaleis 5 times over throughout 2011 with his best-of show \"Larger than Life\" supported by Steve Hughes, he is currently touring with his latest show \"Interesting Times\" throughout 2012 and 2013. On September 16, 2012, Agnew announced his \"indefinite\" retirement from stand-up comedy on his official website and Belgian public television. He cites his commitment to Diablo Blvd. as the main reason for his departure from the stage, also stating he sees no further room for career growth in Belgium, having filled up the Sportpaleis, Belgium's biggest entertainment venue, at least nine times. Agnew's girlfriend runs a popular comedy club, The Joker, in Antwerp."
