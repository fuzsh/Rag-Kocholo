        "text": "H e was a successful Hollywood screenwriter. His novels and short stories received critical acclaim. His reissued books sold hundreds of thousands of copies in Europe, reportedly giving him best-selling author status in France in the 1980s.\n\nJohn Fante’s recognition as an important writer continues to grow, even though he died in 1983.\n\nWith a clean, crisp writing style, infused with deadpan humor, Fante has been heralded as an authentic voice of the immigrant experience in 1930s Los Angeles.\n\nHe also wrote pieces set in Boulder, describing the religion, poverty and prejudice of his youth.\n\nHis novels include “Wait Until Spring, Bandini,” “The Road to Los Angeles,” and “Ask the Dust.” A movie version of “Ask the Dust,” starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek was released in 2006.\n\nFante was born in Denver in 1909. His father, an Italian immigrant, moved the family to Boulder in 1915. The author’s childhood homes, at 1743 Walnut and 959 Arapahoe, are no longer standing.\n\nThe Boulder of John Fante’s youth does not resemble our current city of progressive politics and tolerance. With a population of just over 10,000 in 1920, Boulder was conservative as well as “dry.”\n\nFante was Catholic and Italian-American and regularly endured insulting name-calling about his heritage. He and a neighbor child were not allowed to play together.\n\n“I was a white protestant girl and he was just a wop,” the woman later recalled.\n\nHis boyhood coincided with the rising popularity of the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado. That political period culminated in the election of Clarence J. Morely, a Klan affiliate, as governor of the state in 1925.\n\nBoulder was not immune to the Klan and their particular hatred aimed at foreigners and Roman Catholics. Hundreds of white-robed members cruised down Pearl Street, with automobiles and a float, one night in 1922.\n\nFante’s father, Nick, was a stonemason and worked on the construction of Macky Auditorium, Sacred Heart of Jesus School and other notable buildings in town.\n\nThe Fante patriarch was a heavy drinker, if not alcoholic, and a womanizer. The household was known for Nick’s violence against his wife and children, but his cruelty remained unchecked.\n\nAfter a year at the University of Colorado, John Fante headed to Los Angeles in 1929. There he lived in a cheap hotel and struggled to make it as a writer.\n\nBoulder is thinly disguised in Fante’s first published novel, “Wait Until Spring, Bandini.” When director Dominique Deruddere set out to make a film version in the late 1980s, he visited Boulder but found the town far too modern for the setting, according to a Belgian journalist. Instead, he chose Ogden City, Utah for the filming location.\n\nFante’s fiction reveals some bitter memories of Boulder, but the author and his agents kept in touch with editors at the Daily Camera, sharing news of upcoming publications.\n\nFante also wrote to Frances Wolle, one of his instructors at CU. The Special Collections department at Norlin Library counts two letters from Fante among its treasures.\n\nA book discussion of “Wait Until Spring, Bandini” will be held at the Boulder Public Library on Tuesday at 7 p.m. For more information, contact Carol Heepke at 303-441-3196 or cheepke@boulderlibrary.org."
