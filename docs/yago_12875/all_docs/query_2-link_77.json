        "text": "The music in “Almost Famous” was always more than a soundtrack - it’s also practically part of the set decoration, costume design and ensemble cast.\n\nTwenty years after “Almost Famous” was released, writer/director Cameron Crowe’s masterwork has aged as well as the classic rock & roll it celebrates.\n\nDrawing from Crowe’s experience as teenage journalist covering bands like Led Zeppelin and Allman Brothers for Rolling Stone and other outlets, the film follows a fictional ’70s hard-rock group called Stillwater. (Not to be confused with the nonfictional ’70s Southern-rock group of the same name.)\n\nThe arc largely revolves around three characters: A talented, Dickey Betts-handsome guitarist named Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup); a charismatic groupie who goes by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson); and wunderkind rock journalist/social novice William Miller (Patrick Fugit).\n\nBut like the best bands, “Almost Famous” is much more than its stars, with shining supporting performances from the likes of Jason Lee, Frances McDormand and Fairuza Balk, among others. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman was simply, using a Miller descriptor from the film, incendiary, depicting real-life rock critic Lester Bangs.\n\nSimilarly, while the songs curated for “Almost Famous” pack unified wallop, they’re used in different ways. Some are more in frontman mode, guiding a scene, as with the film’s signature sequence, a tour bus singalong to Elton John piano anthem “Tiny Dancer.” Others are more like a rhythm section. Or a quick yet crucial overdub or background vocal.\n\n“Almost Famous” has a veritable greatest hits album of quotable lines, too. “It’s all happening.” “Your looks have become a problem!” “You’ll meet them all again on the long journey to the middle.” And of course, the Robert Plant inspired, “I am a golden god!”\n\nIn 2020, contemporary rock music struggles to make a blip on mainstream youth culture. That makes revisiting the music in “Almost Famous,” which actually failed to break even at the box office, even more fascinating, because in the period the film depicts, contemporary rock was mainstream youth culture.\n\nTo celebrate “Almost Famous,” released Sept. 13, 2000, here’s a ranking of every song from the film’s original theatrical version. Please note: The below entries contain some low- to mid-level spoilers.\n\n48. “The Chipmunk Song” The Chipmunks\n\nNovelty hit “The Chipmunk Song” can he heard in a scene depicting Miller’s early childhood. There’s another interesting Chipmunks/”Almost Famous” connection. Lee, who plays Stillwater frontman Jeff Bebe, later starred in an “Alvin and the Chipmunks” film franchise, portraying the titular rodents’ songwriter and associate, David Seville.\n\n47. “Fever Dog” Stillwater\n\nHeart guitar-goddess (and Crowe’s then-wife) Nancy Wilson wrote this Zep-y “Stillwater original.” Marti Frederiksen, known for co-writing hits for the likes of Aerosmith, Buckcherry and Carrie Underwood, recorded lead vocals for Lee’s onscreen character.\n\n46. “You Had To Be There” Stillwater 2000\n\nSeventies star/Talk Box guitar effect enthusiast Peter Frampton co-wrote some of the “Almost Famous” Stillwater material. He also lent his searing six-string skills to the recordings. Before finding solo fame with “Frampton Comes Alive,” he was a member of blues-rockers Humble Pie, making Frampton’s “Almost Famous” cameo as Pie’s road-manager extra brilliant. Here’s Frampton’s live DVD version of “You Had To Be There,” which rocks.\n\n45. “Hour Of Need” Stillwater 2000\n\nFrampton recorded his own studio version of this “Almost Famous” Stillwater track, which mixes soaring ’70s melodies and ’90s dirge, for 2003 solo album “Now.”\n\n44. “Dear Jill” Blodwyn Pig 1969\n\nAerosmith, who released their debut album the year “Almost Famous” takes place, 1973, have cited obscure Brit band Blodwyn Pig as an influence. “Dear Jill” scores the scene where Stillwater’s road manager collects Hammond after a wild night with locals in Topeka, Kansas.\n\n43. “Love Thing” Stillwater 2000\n\nThe studio band that record Stillwater music for “Almost Famous” also boasted Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready. The track “Love Thing” benefits from snarling and ringing riffs.\n\n42. “Love Comes And Goes” Stillwater 2000\n\nA very Bad Company-esque power ballad.\n\n41. “Small Time Blues” Pete Droge with Elaine Summers 2000\n\nNorthwest alt-folkie Pete Droge was invited to audition to be a member of the onscreen Stillwater band. That didn’t work out. But Crowe asked his friend Droge to write a song for “Almost Famous.” Droge and Elaine Summers can be seen and heard singing “Small Time Blues” through an open hotel room door, during a scene at the infamous Riot House. In a 2014 Facebook post, Summers wrote, “Our characters were loosely based on Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris.”\n\n40. “Lucky Trumble” Nancy Wilson 2000\n\nWilson summons “Crazy On You”-like acoustic agility for an evocative instrumental.\n\n39. “Albert Flasher” The Guess Who 1971\n\nRollicking piano shuffle from “American Woman” famed Canadians. In “Almost Famous,” the song plays during a scene in which Miller unsuccessfully tries to pry Hammond from his hotel room for an interview.\n\n38. “Feel Flows” The Beach Boys 1971\n\nCarl Wilson’s woozy emerald graces a scene where Miller and Lane first bond - as well as the film’s end credits.\n\n37. “The Oogum Boogum Song” Brenton Wood 1967\n\nFlirty falsetto R&B still innocent enough to score William Miller’s pre-rock-awakening youth.\n\n36. “Teacher” Jethro Tull 1970\n\nFlute-prog cut “Teacher” can be faintly heard as Miller tries to gain entrance backstage to cover a Black Sabbath concert. However he’s repeatedly denied by a hulking security goon.\n\n35. “Bron-Yr-Aur” Led Zeppelin 1975\n\nThere’s a whole lotta Zeppelin in “Almost Famous.” This was quite the coup, because even though Crowe had history with Led Zeppelin, he wrote Rolling Stone’s first cover story on the band, he still had to screen the film for Zep stars Jimmy Page and Robert Plant before getting approval. Instead of stereotypical Led-heavy riffs, Crowes wisely chose tracks highlighting the band’s dynamic reach, like meditative instrumental “Bron-Yr-Aur.”\n\n34. “Mr. Farmer” The Seeds 1966\n\nA garage rock nugget aired during a scene in Bangs’ LP-cluttered home. “Mr. Farmer” was included on the “Almost Famous” soundtrack album,” which sampled 17 songs from the film. The divergent compilation won a Grammy.\n\n33. “Looking At You” MC5 1970\n\nPunk rattler plays in the background as Bangs advises Miller to pitch Rolling Stone “a think piece about a mid-level band struggling with their own limitations ... in the harsh face of stardom.”\n\n32. “I’m Waiting For The Man” David Bowie 1972\n\nThin White Duke’s live Velvet Undeground cover, also released as part of a 2008 Bowie archival release, drips with nasty habits and sketchy connections. Crowe uses the song in “Almost Famous” during a road-life montage.\n\n31. “Tangerine” Led Zeppelin 1970\n\nZep rarely played this tie-dyed folk-rocker in concert. In “Almost Famous” the song is the musical thread that ties the movie’s final moments together.\n\n30. “Future Games” Fleetwood Mac\n\nBob Welch era Mac cut plays in the background during the scene in Topeka where an addled Hammond tells a local teen named Aaron, yes, he does want to watch Aaron feed a mouse to his snake.\n\n29. “Burn” Deep Purple 1974\n\nMetallic raver, with future Whitesnake star David Coverdale sharing co-vocal duties with operatic Purple bassist Glenn Hughes. The song plays as Hammond guzzles a red-cup beer laced with LSD in a hallway at the Topeka house party.\n\n28. “It Wouldn’t Have Made Any Difference” Todd Rundgren 1972\n\nAt one time, Rundgren was married to Bebe Buell, the beautiful renaissance woman/rock scenester who, in addition to being actress Liv Tyler’s mom, is said to be one of Crowe’s inspirations for Penny Lane. The silk art-pop of “It Wouldn’t Have Made Any Difference” shows up in the film’s diner scene, as Bangs warns Miller rock is becoming just “an industry of cool.”\n\n27. “Roundabout” Yes 1972\n\nGalloping opus is at whisper volume as Miller flatters his way into Stillwater’s orbit, while on a loading ramp.\n\n26. “The Wind” Cat Stevens 1971\n\nOne hundred and two seconds of beard-folk bliss. Scores a scene where Penny Lane dances alone and barefoot in an empty auditorium following a Stillwater show.\n\n25. “Wishing Well” Free 1972\n\nThe final single from soul-rock combo Free wafts at NYC rock hotspot Max’s Kansas City, right before Miller tells Stillwater the band’s RS piece has been upgraded to cover story.\n\n24. “Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters” Elton John 1972\n\nCountry-tinged ballad accompanies Miller’s as he finds Lane blotto on Quaaludes and booze.\n\n23. “Sparks” The Who 1969\n\nHypnotic passage spins as William discovers LPs his free-spirit sister gifted him before she left home.\n\n22. Sweet Leaf “Black Sabbath”\n\nMiller’s first Creem Magazine assignment from Bangs, for a princely 35 bucks, is a story on Black Sabbath. The heavy-metal originators’s weed paean rattles through the arena’s backstage during the Sabbath show Miller attends.\n\n21. “Simple Man” Lynyrd Skynyrd 1973\n\nAlternately haunting and explosive, “Simple Man” lurks in the shadows as Hammond asks Miller to “just make us look cool” in his article.\n\n20. “That’s The Way” Led Zeppelin 1970\n\nPastoral stunner fades in as Stillwater’s bus crashes through a venue gate to escape a gig gone wrong.\n\n19. “Something In The Air” Thunderclap Newman 1969\n\nBebe leads a hotel roomful of musicians and hangers-on in a sinner’s choir version of this hit from a band featuring Who guitarist Pete Townshend’s former chauffeur, Speedy King.\n\n18. “Reelin’ In The Years” Steely Dan 1972\n\nDespite the band’s sex-toy derived name, Steely Dan isn’t known for well, sexiness. So it’s interesting Crowd picked this track to lead into the scene where three groupies deflower Miller during a moment of on-tour boredom.\n\n17. “Easy To Slip” Little Feat\n\nSwampy Los Angeles band’s track is heard as Miller receives a phone call from Rolling Stone’s Ben Fong-Torres looking for a story pitch.\n\n16. “Go All The Way” Raspberries 1972\n\nBangs is spinning Raspberries’ power-pop on his home stereo when Miller reaches him via phone, looking for counsel.\n\n15. “One Way Out” The Allman Brothers Band 1972\n\nThe Allmans’ lightning-bolt Elmore James cover swings as Stillwater checks-in to Tempe, Ariz.‘s King of The Road Motor Lodge.\n\n14. “Your Move” Yes 1973\n\nTime seems to stomp on this very CSN tune. It’s a deft pick for when Miller takes his first steps inside a big-time backstage.\n\n13. “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere” Neil Young 1968\n\nHammond leaves a band argument to look for something “real.” He and Miller end up at a local house party, where Neil Young’s twangy romp can be heard.\n\n12. “Misty Mountain Hop” Led Zeppelin 1971\n\nStillwater’s limo ride swaggers a little more with this Zep sidewinder.\n\n11. “Every Picture Tells A Story” Rod Stewart 1971\n\nChiming epic accompanies Miller first experience with rock’s shaggy epicenter, Riot House, aka Sunset Strip’s Continental Hyatt House.\n\n10. “My Cherie Amor” Stevie Wonder 1969\n\nBuoyant R&B love song gives striking contrast to a scene involving a stomach-pump.\n\n9. “America” Simon & Garfunkel 1968\n\nLyrically dense strummer airs as Miller’s older sister, played by Zooey Deschanel, packs up to leave home with some hot scowling dude. Reportedly, at one point Deschanel was to play Penny Lane, a role Natalie Portman is also said to have been considered for. Early on, Brad Pitt supposedly was set to play Hammond.\n\n8. “River” Joni Mitchell 1971\n\nThe scene where Lane and Hammond reconnect early in “Almost Famous” features Mitchell’s sparse longing gem.\n\n7. “Search And Destroy” The Stooges 1973\n\nSlashing proto-punk gets cranked during Bangs’ visit to a local radio station.\n\n6. “Slip Away” Clarence Carter 1968\n\nRecorded at Muscle Shoals’ FAME Studios. Blind singer Clarence Carter’s soul groover is in the background during the “Almost Famous” card game scene where Lane’s companionship is wagered against a case of beer.\n\n5. “The Rain Song” Led Zeppelin 1973\n\nZep’s orchestral track can be heard as Sapphire, the witty groupie Balk plays, advises Hammond to go make things right with Miller. She also complains about a new wave of groupies: “None of them use birth control. And they eat all the steak!”\n\n4. “Paranoid” Black Sabbath 1970\n\nSabs headbanger rages as Miller’s mom drops him off at the San Diego Sports Arena for his Creem assignment. After Miller exists her station wagon and joins the wild-haired throng approaching the arena, she gives him “the family whistle” and loudly implores Miller, to his horror, “Don’t take drugs!”\n\n3. “The Cover Of ‘Rolling Stone’” Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show 1972\n\nGenius honk-tonk-ed satire featuring Chickasaw, Ala. native Ray Sawyer on vocals. In “Almost Famous” Stillwater sings the celebratory chorus after learning about their Rolling Stone cover.\n\n2. “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” Jimi Hendrix 1968\n\nHendrix’s mountain-chopping guitar sends chills as Stillwater prepares to board the band’s first tour plane.\n\n1. “Tiny Dancer” Elton John 1971\n\nElton’s pirouetting ode to a rock seamstress had faded into obscurity before “Almost Famous.” Thanks to that singalong on Stillwater’s bus, “Tiny Dancer” ricocheted into pop-culture (and Elton John’s setlists). As revealed during a recent cast reunion with Rolling Stone’s Brian Hiatt moderating, Hudson actually improvised Penny Lane’s poignant “You are home” remark during that scene. And for 20 years now, watching Crowe’s film has felt like home for rock fans.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\nA wish list of unreleased recordings from rock legends\n\n25 recent songs by Alabama musicians to know\n\n20 of the most iconic cars in rock & roll\n\n20 rock stars who got their start as sidemen"
