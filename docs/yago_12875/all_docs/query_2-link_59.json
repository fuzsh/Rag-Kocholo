        "text": "Well, well, well, this is one of those albums that comes from nowhere and which you end up falling in love with. At least that’s what happened to me. I must admit, when it dropped thorough the letterbox, I opened it and set it aside for a week or so before finally getting around to listening to it. The result was me quickly getting hooked on the late-’80s, early-’90s indie rock vibe which occasionally brought to mind Hüsker Dü as well as Moving Targets. The recording even has a quality that harkens back to those times, which adds to the quality of the release. If, like me, you enjoy music from that era—which is well written and performed, sounds good, and has strong, catchy melodies—then this trio should be for you. –Rich Cocksedge (Moving Change, [email protected], tonota80.bandcamp.com)"
