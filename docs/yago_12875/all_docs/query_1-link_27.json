        "text": "Three nights in the life of a man hopelessly searching for love, based on the work of Bukowski. In the first episode Harry Voss is 12 years old and still naïve enough to think that love is like it is in the movies: a prince romances a princess and kisses her solemnly on the lips while end credits roll. Harry wants to become like his father – a knight who married Harry’s mother on a lonely mountaintop. But he still has a lot to learn about 'fucking' and what you have to do when it 'itches'. In episode two he is a teenager who discovers that some people are beautiful and others are ugly, life is unjust and alcohol helps. Episode three finds Harry as an adult: a bum who was never able to fully work out his psychological problems. He no longer believes in fairy tales, but his longing for that one true love is stronger than ever before. To fulfill this dream, he seems capable of anything.\n\nCONTENU\n\nCrazy Love 83 min.\n\nCrazy Love archives (documentary, 36 min.)\n\nKilling Joke (short feature, 1980)\n\nWodka Orange (short feature, 1982)\n\nTrailers\n\nCrazy Love (1987)\n\nWait until Spring Bandini (1989)\n\nSuite 16 (1995)\n\nHombres Complicados (1997)\n\nIedereen beroemd (2000)"
