This song was written and recorded by Rachel Fannan, who released a song called “Just To Be Free” a month ago, and Harlan Silverman.\n\nThe Bomb is a new project that Fannan started in the beginning of 2016. The band revolves around the rock genre as each song brings out an issue society currently faces or has been facing for centuries.\n\nAccording to Buzzband, this song’s lyrics speak about social injustice as upon the creation of this project Fannan had stated “I’m stepping out from behind my routine love song vibe to speak directly about the human condition. Everything from America’s gun obsession to Donald Trump’s racist insanity. It’s time for me to get real about my longtime desire to influence society for positive change … Here’s to moving it forward and holding ourselves to a purpose. And I’m not saying don’t enjoy it.”\n\nDirected by Holland Rusk and Teresa Chu, the video shows a choreography of a group of females rolling their hips, flipping their hair etc. As for inspiration for the video, the artist had said “I think growing up in the ’80s and ’90s watching MTV, I was really attracted to dance videos. Stuff like early Madonna pulled me in. Those types of visuals and the L.A. girl who works her butt off to stay in the game even when it seems like everyone around her is already famous.”"
