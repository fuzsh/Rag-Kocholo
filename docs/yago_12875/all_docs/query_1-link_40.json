        "text": "4\n\n(7)\n\nThree ‘Bukowskian’ torrid nights in the life of a man in search of love. Harry, 12, is young and naive. Love, for him, is romantic love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on a lonely mountain peak – Later on, he’ll do the same. But Harry has a lot to learn. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That one can find comfort in drinking – but above all he learns that man is capable of anything – absolutely anything. – to get his fair share of love.\n\nDirector: Dominique Deruddere.\n\nWriters: Charles Bukowski (novels), Dominique Deruddere, Marc Didden.\n\nStars: Josse De Pauw, Geert Hunaerts, Gene Bervoets, Michael Pas, Amid Chakir, Florence Béliard, Karen Van Parijs, Carmela Locantore, An Van Essche, Doriane Moretus.\n\nCinematographer: Willy Stassen.\n\nComposer: Raymond van het Groenewoud.\n\n⇓ DOWNLOAD OPTIONS⇓\n\nENCODE:\n\nMP4 | 1.86 GB | 1280×720 | 25 FPS | 3000 kb/s | AAC 192 kb/s\n\nLanguage: Dutch & Italian | Subtitles: English (hard)\n\n⇒ DL via MEGA\n\n⇒ DL via FILES\n\n⇒ DL via 1FICHIER\n\n(DO NOT USE WITHOUT ADBLOCKER)\n\nSOURCE FILE:\n\nMKV | 4.07 GB | 1920×1080 | 25 FPS | 6772 kb/s | AC3 224 kb/s\n\nLanguage: Dutch & Italian | Subtitles: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Romanian & Russian (all soft)\n\n⇒ DL via MEGA\n\n⇒ DL via FILES"
