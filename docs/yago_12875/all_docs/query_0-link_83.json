        "text": "This Flemish movie has been nominated for an Oscar. It's one of those unpretentious comedies that usually get lost in the hoopla around overwhelming movies like Harry Potter or The Lord Of The Rings.\n\nForeign, too, usually means serious art, but this movie's feather-light, the Flemish equivalent of, say, Legally Blonde. It's also a movie about - ugh! - following your dreams and making a success of life, love and all that.\n\nIn this one, Marva (Eva van der Gucht) wants to be a singer and takes part in amateur talent contests. She's pouty, plump, but dad, an unemployed worker, Jean Vereecken (Josse de Pauw), believes in her. To get Marva on TV, he and his layabout friend, Willy (Werner de Smedt), kidnap Belgium's most popular singer, Debbie (Thekla Reuten). The ransom is a singing spot on a TV show for Marva.\n\nDirector and scriptwriter Dominique Deruddere is obviously having a comical go at celebrities, TV and hype. Debbie's made it big, Marva thinks, because she's slept her way to the top. Debbie's manager, also, sees singing as a matter of creating hype around the singer, not necessarily a matter of talent.\n\nThese are easy satirical targets. It's like taking candy from a kid or bashing Jean-Claude van Damme or Kevin Costner. However, people without talent are pretty stupid when they seek fame and probably deserve getting bashed. Just think of what they inflict on everybody else. Just think of Britney Spears.\n\nAnd of course hype's empty these days. You don't have to be a good singer to get packaged on MTV - in fact, without the surreal visual glitter many of the singers on pop videos would sound damn awful if you just had to listen to them, cold turkey.\n\nDeruddere has basically made a cross-over movie, a foreign movie that will play well on the American market. You don't get famous making Flemish movies, he says. True. Interestingly, his movies have been American-influenced, like Love Is A Dog From Hell, based on the toughly existential stories of legendary boozer, Charles Bukowsi, or Wait Until Spring Bandini, co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nBut what distinguishes his movie from a bit of fluff like Legally Blonde is his sense of realism. His characters aren't types, but people, and that's a major difference when it comes to comedy. We're used to the perpetual, unreal mobility of a Jim Carrey, or the gross-out kids of teen comedies. In Everybody's Famous!, Deruddere settles us into the characters: they have hopes, they fail, bicker and are just themselves.\n\nDeruddere makes his jokes with compassion. You feel there's a good-hearted twinkle in his eye, that he enjoys his characters' silliness. In Legally Blonde, there's never a moment of doubt. The movie's about a blonde babe who wants to be a lawyer, and nothing's going to stop her. An adoring camera tracks and follows her, holding her up as role model.\n\nIn Everybody's Famous!, you don't have an overactive camera. There's a wonderful ordinariness about the movie. It's not trying to impress. Some American reviewers complained that it wasn't much of a comedy. It probably isn't, but it's not going for belly laughs, just real situations, made all the more absurd for their being real."
