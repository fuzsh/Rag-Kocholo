        "text": "Landscape Entertainment and Gold Circle Films will team to produce “Au Pair” and “Blood Wedding,” with Landscape topper Bob Cooper and Gold Circle CEO Paul Brooks as producers of both.\n\nJonathan Schwartz, who brought “Au Pair” to Cooper, will also produce the thriller about a female student who goes to work for what seems like an idyllic family but discovers otherwise. Mark Haslett did the rewrite of a screenplay by Judy Klass.\n\n“Blood Wedding,” penned by Tad Safran (“Doogal”), is a remake of the 2005 German comedy written and directed by Dominique Deruddere. Story centers on the groom’s father, who refuses to pay for what he considers an exorbitant wedding reception bill at a country inn, leading to a hostage situation escalating into a war.\n\n“Au Pair” was previously in development at Paramount; Cooper recently optioned “Blood Wedding.”\n\nCooper’s produced “John Tucker Must Die” for Fox and “Mr. Woodcock” for New Line, and he’s developing “The Crusaders” for New Line. Gold Circle produced “Because I Said So” and is in post-production on “My Sassy Girl” and “How I Met My Boyfriend’s Dead Fiancee.”"
