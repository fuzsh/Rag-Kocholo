        "text": "Let's title this one \"What African Film Industries Can Learn from the UK's Progressive Model for Growth and Sustainability.\" There's a critical need in African film industries for actionable initiatives beyond discussions at summits and forums. Leveraging the influence and access of organizers to push for structured, progressive policies, akin to those adopted by the UK government in the article below, could significantly advance the industries. In the context of African cinemas, a proposed inquiry might look like this: Committee Formation - It could be continent-wide, or country-specific. In either case, the Committee should include a diverse range of industry professionals and representatives. Areas of Focus - Most important at this moment is talent development. So, establishing world-class training and educational programs that are not just imitations of Western models, but rather nurture and celebrate the unique cinematic voices and stories, prioritizing local context and perspectives that can lead to the development of distinctly African cinematic identities. - Of course funding and financing, exploring sustainable funding models. - Distribution and accessibility, enhancing local and international film distribution channels. - Cultural representation, ensuring diverse and inclusive storytelling. - Technology adoption, notably the proliferation of AI in the production and distribution stages. - A regulatory environment that is consistent in examining and proposing regulatory changes. - Audience engagement strategies, both locally and globally. - Encouraging regional and international partnerships. Process - Gathering insights via submissions, followed by an in-depth analysis and a report outlining strategic recommendations. - The next crucial step would be advocating for these recommendations to be implemented by governments. This means engaging with policymakers, leveraging the influence of industry stakeholders, and using the report to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed changes. - Effective implementation will require continuous dialogue, collaboration, and, possibly, adjustments to the recommendations based on practical considerations and feedback. This merely outlines a potential framework for exploring similar issues in African cinema contexts. Can this happen? While challenging, successful examples in other regions suggest it's possible with concerted effort and strategic planning.\n\nCongratulations! Your film has made it into a major film festival! So, what now? The first order of business is to establish an open line of communication between you and the the theater or festival venue. You should also make sure your film is formatted properly for the sceeening. Ask the festival/theater if they want a Digital Cinema Package (DCP), Blu-Ray, or a digital file. If the theater/festival has the only copy of your DCP, ask for its return after the screening. Once you get to the festival there are lots of things to do before and after the screening. For example, you can ask to volunteer yourself, or if there‚Äôs a Q&A after the screening if you should be ready for that. REMEMBER: You are looking for as much exposure and publicity as possible and they need your help. Also, volunteering strengthens your relationship with the festival people and keeps you updated on upcoming events. Dress code should always be taken into consideration when attending film festivals. Keep in mind that some events are more formal than others. Leave postcards (smaller copies of your film‚Äôs poster) as well as your business cards on nearby tables. That way, people can learn more about you and your film. Keep in mind that you can stay as long as you like after the premiere, so take the opportunity to talk with the people who enjoyed your film. Who knows where it might lead! üòä #film #filmmakers #filmfestivals\n\nLast night, the Brazilian Congress approved a significant step towards supporting our local film industry by reinstating the quota for local productions. Instead of specifying a fixed number of days, it emphasizes a minimum number of sessions and a diverse range of titles. These specifics will be determined by future executive decree. What's crucial is that the regulation is designed to ensure \"variety, diversity, balanced competition, and effective presence\" of Brazilian feature films in high-demand sessions. This is a move towards a more dynamic and inclusive film landscape. As we look ahead, questions arise about how this will play out. With no screen limit per movie, mechanisms must be implemented to guarantee that local productions receive fair and favorable programming. This development marks a positive stride for our local film industry, and I'm eager to see how it unfolds. Let's keep supporting and celebrating Brazilian cinema! üé•üçø #BrazilianCinema #SupportLocalFilms #FilmIndustry #PositiveChange #cinema #distribution #filmbusiness\n\nOn my way to Berlin Filmfestival for meetings and seminars. Among them Film i V√§st¬¥s (now tradition) very popular seminar at Hilton hotel. This years topic is about ‚Äúover production‚Äù. In many European countries and regions film and audiovisual policies are reformed. The ambition is most often to strengthen the competitiveness of the specific territory. The new proposed objectives are almost always linked to the will to improve domestic contents performance and position. Significantly greater support for fewer films has been seen as crucial for the nation‚Äôs/Europe's films to be able to strengthen their own position and reach and engage a larger audience. In Berlin, we will gather for a conversation on how Europe, and not least film and audiovisual policy and film agencies, can contribute to strengthening competitiveness. Is the conclusion still that a central and necessary measure is to overcome overproduction. What conflict of aims can arise, and can they be avoided?\n\nüé¨ A Call to Action for Canada's Independent Cinema Industry üé¨ A recent report from the Network of Independent Canadian Exhibitors (NICE) reveals a critical juncture for Canada‚Äôs independent cinemas. Facing significant challenges from streaming services and restrictive Hollywood studio policies, 60% of operators reported losses, with a pressing need for increased public funding and policy advocacy. The \"clean run\" policies, where a film must exclusively occupy a screen for up to four weeks, are particularly detrimental, stifling the ability of smaller, single-screen theatres to remain financially viable. This situation not only impacts the cultural landscape but also the economic vitality of communities nationwide. As professionals in the creative and cultural sectors, we must rally support for these vital institutions. üîó For full insights and how you can contribute to the cause, visit: https://lnkd.in/gwYtM2hJ #IndependentCinema #CulturalPolicy #SupportLocal #FilmIndustry #NICECinema\n\nP√• Berlins filmfestival arrangerade Film i V√§st ett samtal och diskussion om filmens framtid och hur den audiovisuella industrin ska st√§rkas. ‚ÄùLess is more‚Ä¶..or not- How should Europe strenghen its competitiveness‚Äù In many European countries and regions film and audiovisual policies are reformed.

KULTURAKADEMIN\n\nTo mark the beginning of the Toronto Film Festival (TIFF) let‚Äôs talk about #accessibility. Films like all pastimes, are not only a way for people to relax after a long day, but a social activity that brings people together for entertainment. However, the theatre is a place where people with disabilities can experience exclusivity due to inaccessibility. For instance, in addition to being a visual medium, films rely heavily on sound to convey the story, the emotions viewers are to feel. But not everyone has perfect hearing. Some have minor, moderate or severe hearing loss. As a result they rely heavily on the existence of captions. While captioned films exist especially in the international film market, the existence of captions directly on the screen is not as common in North America. Especially in Canada where theatres are more likely to use CaptiView machine as an alternative. After all not everyone like captions and there are technical problems with it. However, these machines are not perfect. If we are to continue to use these archaic machines, there should be a major upgrade in the technology. https://lnkd.in/gJsVJKa5 #captions #films #hearingloss"
