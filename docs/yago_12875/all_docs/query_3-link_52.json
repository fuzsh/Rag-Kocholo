        "text": "American Zoetrope (also known as Zoetrope Studios from 1979 until 1990) is a privately run American film production company, centred in San Francisco, California and founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas.\n\nOpened on December 12, 1969, the studio has produced not only the films of Coppola (including Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Tetro) but also George Lucas's pre-Star Wars films (THX 1138, American Graffiti), as well as many others by avant-garde directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa, Wim Wenders and Godfrey Reggio. American Zoetrope was an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV.\n\nFour films produced by American Zoetrope are included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Films. American Zoetrope-produced films have received 15 Academy Awards and 68 nominations.\n\nFormation[]\n\nInitially located in a warehouse on Folsom Street, the company's headquarters have since 1972 been in the historic Sentinel Building, at 916 Kearny Street in San Francisco's North Beach neighbourhood.\n\nCoppola named the studio after a zoetrope he was given in the late 1960s by the filmmaker and collector of early film devices, Mogens Skot-Hansen. \"Zoetrope\" is also the name by which Coppola's quarterly fiction magazine, Zoetrope: All-Story, is often known.\n\nAmerican Zoetrope is now owned entirely by Coppola's son and daughter, directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola., while a majority of the film library is now owned by Lionsgate.\n\nZoetrope Virtual Studio[]\n\nIt also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000 after more than four years of work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, plus new departments for other creative endeavours, offering e-collaborative tools. Filmmaker members can workshop a wide range of film arts, including music, graphics, design and film & video.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nAmerican Zoetrope / Zoetrope Studios filmography Date Film Director Company Credit TBA On the Rocks Sofia Coppola American Zoetrope Production Company Mainstream Gia Coppola 2017 The Beguiled Sofia Coppola 2016 Paris Can Wait Eleanor Coppola Joshy Jeff Baena 2015 A Very Murray Christmas Sofia Coppola Last Days in the Desert Rodrigo García 2014 Life After Beth Jeff Baena 2013 Palo Alto Gia Coppola The Bling Ring Sofia Coppola 2012 A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III Roman Coppola On the Road Walter Salles 2011 Twixt Francis Ford Coppola 2010 Somewhere Sofia Coppola 2009 Tetro Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Youth Without Youth 2006 Marie Antoinette Sofia Coppola The Good Shepherd Robert De Niro 2004 Kinsey Bill Condon Production Company (uncredited) 2003 Lost in Translation Sofia Coppola Production Company Jeepers Creepers 2 Victor Salva 2002 Pumpkin Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder Assassination Tango Robert Duvall 2001 Jeepers Creepers Victor Salva CQ Roman Coppola No Such Thing Hal Hartley Suriyothai Chatrichalerm Yukol 1999 The Florentine Nick Stagliano The Virgin Suicides Sofia Coppola The Third Miracle Agnieszka Holland Sleepy Hollow Tim Burton 1998 Moby Dick Franc Roddam 1997 The Rainmaker Francis Ford Coppola 1997 Buddy Caroline Thompson Production Company (as An American Zoetrope Production) 1997 The Odyssey Andrei Konchalovsky Production Company (as American Zoetrope San Francisco) 1996 Jack Francis Ford Coppola Production Company 1995 Haunted Lewis Gilbert My Family Gregory Nava 1994 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Kenneth Branagh Don Juan DeMarco Jeremy Leven 1993 The Secret Garden Agnieszka Holland 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula Francis Ford Coppola Wind Carroll Ballard 1991 Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse Fax Bahr, Eleanor Coppola, and George Hickenlooper 01990-01-01-00001990 The Godfather Part III Francis Ford Coppola Zoetrope Studios 1989 Wait Until Spring, Bandini Dominique Deruddere 1988 Tucker: The Man and His Dream Francis Ford Coppola 1987}} Tough Guys Don't Dance Norman Mailer Gardens of Stone Francis Ford Coppola Barfly Barbet Schroeder 1986 Peggy Sue Got Married Francis Ford Coppola 1985 Seven Minutes in Heaven Linda Feferman Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters Paul Schrader 1984 The Cotton Club Francis Ford Coppola 1983 The Outsiders Rumble Fish The Black Stallion Returns Robert Dalva 1982 Koyaanisqatsi Godfrey Reggio The Making of 'One from the Heart' Tony St. John Hammett Wim Wenders One from the Heart Francis Ford Coppola Production Company/Distributor The Grey Fox Phillip Borsos Production Company Passion Jean-Luc Godard Production Company/DIstributor The Escape Artist Caleb Deschanel Production Company Parsifal Hans-Jürgen Syberberg 1980 Kagemusha Akira Kurosawa Sauve qui peut (la vie) Jean-Luc Godard Production Company/Distributor 1979 The Black Stallion Carroll Ballard Omni Zoetrope Production Company Apocalypse Now Francis Ford Coppola 1977 Hitler: A Film from Germany Hans-Jürgen Syberberg Distributor Perfumed Nightmare Kidlat Tahimik American Zoetrope 1974 The Conversation Francis Ford Coppola Production Company The Godfather Part II Production Facilities Furnished Through (as American Zoetrope San Francisco) 1973 American Graffiti George Lucas Production Company 1972 The Godfather Francis Ford Coppola Ludwig: Requiem for a Virgin King Hans-Jürgen Syberberg Distributor 1971 THX 1138 George Lucas Production Company 1969 The Rain People Francis Ford Coppola\n\nTelevision series[]\n\nFirst Wave (1998-2001)\n\nThe 4400 (2004-07)\n\nMozart in the Jungle (2014-18)\n\nCafe Zoetrope[]\n\nIn the building lobby Coppola operates a small Italian café, Cafe Zoetrope, featuring Inglenook Estate wine and memorabilia from his films."
