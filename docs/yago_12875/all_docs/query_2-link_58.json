Led Zeppelin is king, Richard Nixon is President, and idealistic 15-year-old William Miller is an aspiring music journalist. When Rolling Stone magazine hires him to go on the road with an up-and-coming band, William is thrust into the rock-and-roll circus, where his love of music, his longing for friendship, and his integrity as a writer collide. Almost Famous is about a young man finding his place in the world and the indelible characters he meets along the way. It’s a celebration of community, family, fandom and the power of music.\n\nWhen Almost Famous had its world premiere in Crowe’s hometown of San Diego at The Old Globe where it set the record for the highest-grossing show in the theater’s 90-year history, Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times called the production, “A shimmering and mesmerizing musical that is destined to conquer Broadway. Cameron Crowe’s coming-of-age rock tale burns bright as Jeremy Herrin balances the thrill of performing in a rock band with the backstage rivalries and romances. Tom Kitt’s score, gorgeously sung by the top-notch cast, weaves an entrancing tapestry of sound that floats on a cloud of groovy rock.”\n\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune enthused, “Capturing a shining moment of youth, love, and music Almost Famous has one quality in particular that can boost a musical above the rest: an unabashedly big heart. Like the movie, it’s brimming with memorably off-kilter characters and unalloyed joy.\"\n\nVariety raved “A love letter to music… Almost Famous feels uniquely real. Which it is, because Crowe lived it, and perfected it by revisiting the memories countless times since.”"
