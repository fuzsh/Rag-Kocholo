Love, for him, is romantic love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on a lonely mountain peak... Later on, he'll do the same. But Harry has a lot to learn. He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That one can find comfort in drinking... but above all he learns that man is capable of anything - absolutely anything! - to get his fair share of love.",

        "text": "13-18: Bukowski rules, the voice of the freaks, the voice of the lonely. Great shit stories.\n\n19-29: Pretend Bukowski was an embarrassing phase, no longer rules.\n\n30-present: Stop giving a fuck, can once again proclaim Bukowski rules. Now realize everything we're supposed to think is embarrassing is the work of someone without fear of such a thing, just a broken man pouring his heart out. He's Carson McCullers for people who hate themselves, a vital role.\n\nCrazy Love is beautiful. Desperation and loneliness played with a tone of magical realism, just without any of the magic, and I can't think of anything truer to life than that. It's the small gestures of others that keep things bearable. Then a final shot I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\nThe original Flemish title translates as 'Love is a Dog from Hell', the title of a collection of writings by Charles Bukowski from which this series of three chapters is taken, and why the decision was made to release it in the English-speaking world retitled like a third-rate romcom is a mystery to me. It's a decidedly weird film. The best segment is the first, a funny and likeable, if rather broad, coming-of-age sex comedy; the two later snippets from the life of protagonist Harry are increasingly dark, and only patchily successful, seemingly determined to shock (and succeeding, it must be said) but less concerned with engaging the audience. It's hard not to feel something in the final moments, although what exactly it was I was feeling I can't put my finger on. Certainly one of the stranger things lurking on Netflix.\n\nThe Films of 1987, Ranked\n\nTarantino chose this film as his Wild Card selection in The Big Picture podcast’s “1987 Movie Draft.” I’d never heard if it. The hosts had never heard of it. But Tarantino’s co-host of his The Video Archives podcast, Roger Avary, seemed delighted by the choice.\n\nAn anthology of sorts, based on the works of Charles Bukowski, the film ultimately follows the trials of love and lust among three stages of one man’s life. “Moonlight” this is not. Instead I was reminded more of Fellini’s “Amarcord” (which I didn’t like), particularly in the first segment where a 12-year-old Harry is infatuated with an actress he sees in a film and wonders is all romances are similar. His older friend, Stan, tells…"
