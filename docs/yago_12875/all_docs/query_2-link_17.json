        "text": "\"Famous\" (originally titled \"Nina Chop\") is the fourth track from Kanye West's seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo (2016).[1] The track features vocals from singer Rihanna, producer Swizz Beatz, and (sampled) singer Nina Simone.[2] It was released as a single on March 28, 2016.[2]\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe song's chorus, mostly performed by Rihanna, comes from Nina Simone's song \"Do What You Gotta Do,\" which is directly sampled at the end. A sample of the track \"Bam Bam\" by Sister Nancy serves as the song's outro.[3]\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe track previously went by the name, \"Nina Chop\" up until January 2016, with that name coming from the use of a sample of Nina Simone's song \"Do What You Gotta Do.\"[4] Additionally, the track was going to contain vocals from rapper Young Thug that were cut from release.[5] When the song was updated in March 2016, a lyric was changed from: \"She be Puerto Rican day parade wavin'\"; to: \"She in school to be a real estate agent\".[6]\n\nChance the Rapper also recorded a verse that seems to have been positioned after the Simone sample at the end of the track. He played the verse to Zane Lowe of Beats 1 after release.[7][8]\n\nRick Ross released a remixed version of the song in February 2016.[9]\n\nControversy[]\n\nSee also: List of feuds#Taylor Swift\n\nAt the beginning of his first verse, Kanye raps:\n\nFor all my South Side ni**as that know me best\n\nI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\n\nWhy? I made that bitch famous\n\n(Goddamn!)\n\nI made that bitch famous\n\nThe line met criticism after release, in which Ye defended the line by saying he talked with Taylor about the line and she \"gave her blessings\" for its use.[10] Swift's spokesperson claimed otherwise.[11] Months after release, Kim Kardashian shared a video of Ye and Swift speaking over the phone, seemingly confirming West's claims.[12] It was four years later, in 2020, when a full recording of the video was leaked, showing that Ye did share the lines with Swift and that she objected to it.[13]\n\nSwift alluded to Ye in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Grammys when she said \" people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\"[14] She also called the song's music video revenge porn in a 2019 Tumblr post addressed to media proprietor Scooter Braun.[15]\n\nIn turn, Ye made a tweet in August 2020 that seemed to refer to Taylor Swift as a snake, referring to a 2016 Kim tweet that seemed to make the same comparison.[2][16]\n\nMusic video[]\n\nThe song's official music video depicts twelve wax figures of celebrities laying in bed with a wax figure of Kanye West. The celebrities are (from left-to-right) former U.S. president George W. Bush; fashion icon Anna Wintour; former U.S. president Donald Trump; singers Rihanna, Chris Brown, and Taylor Swift; Kanye West himself; his now ex-wife Kim Kardashian-West; Kim's ex-partner Ray J; Ye's own ex-partner Amber Rose; Kim's mother Caitlyn Jenner; and comedian Bill Cosby.[17]\n\nThe music video alternates between a panning birds eye view of the bed, and night vision closeups of the figures. Many of the figures have parts of their personal regions shown.[17]\n\nAbruptly before the last chorus performed by Rihanna, the song cuts to a black screen that displays \"SPECIAL THANKS / BILL COSBY / CAITLYN JENNER / AMBER ROSE / RAY J / KIM KARDASHIAN WEST / TAYLOR SWIFT / CHRIS BROWN / RIHANNA / DONALD TRUMP / ANNA WINTOUR / AND GEORGE BUSH / FOR BEING FAMOUS\" before a final pan out is shown of the figures.\n\nThe last two minutes of the music video shows the sun over a horizon as the track \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\" plays.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nMan I can understand how it might be\n\nKinda hard to love a girl like me\n\nI don't blame you much for wanting to be free\n\nI just wanted you to know\n\nSwizz told me let the beat rock\n\nFor all my Southside n***as that know me best\n\nI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\n\nWhy? I made that bitch famous (God damn)\n\nI made that bitch famous\n\nFor all the girls that got dick from Kanye West\n\nIf you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best\n\nWhy?
