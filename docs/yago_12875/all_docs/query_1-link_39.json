        "text": "American Zoetrope: Dedicated to Creating Classics\n\nSince our founding in 1969, we have produced some of the most important films in American cinema. Our founder’s distinguished career includes films that have garnered 27 Academy Awards and 63 nominations, four of which are on the American Film Institute’s list of The 100 Greatest American Films of All Time.\n\nAmerican Zoetrope has constantly embraced the creative possibilities of technology, and is known for orchestrating alternative approaches to filmmaking and challenging stale Hollywood standards. American Zoetrope continues to build on its rich film history and legendary standards of quality from its headquarters, the historic Sentinel Building in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.\n\nBelow is a complete list of our films--from Coppola's first film, Dementia 13 (1963), to current productions that haven't even been released yet in theaters. Click on any title or director's name to access an entire database of information. You'll find domestic, foreign and rare movie posters, movie stills, plot summaries, awards, links to official sites, and complete cast and crew listings."
