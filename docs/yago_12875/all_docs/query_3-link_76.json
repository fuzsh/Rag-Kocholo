RRC Polytech campuses are located on the lands of Anishinaabe, Ininiwak, Anishininew, Dakota, and Dené, and the National Homeland of the Red River Métis.\n\nWe recognize and honour Treaty 3 Territory Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, the source of Winnipeg’s clean drinking water. In addition, we acknowledge Treaty Territories, which provide us with access to electricity we use in both our personal and professional lives.\n\nWe respect the Treaties that were made on these territories, and we dedicate ourselves to move forward in partnership with Indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration.\n\nRRC Polytech is committed to a renewed relationship and dialogue with Indigenous Peoples based on the principles of mutual trust, respect and reciprocity.\n\nHonour Song\n\nThis tradition began centuries ago on Turtle Island. Indigenous Peoples believe the drum and the heart share a similar purpose: to provide life through its beat. This convocation promotes oneness, love and respect for all living things. The honour song brings voice and calls spirit to celebrate the relationships between all life. Usually sung to honour a particular person, they can also be sung for groups or at sacred gatherings such as sundances, sweat lodges and ceremonies to acknowledge those who have accomplished a great goal. When the honour song is sung at a gathering, it is considered respectful to stand and remove your hat.\n\nIndigenous Graduation Stoles\n\nIndigenous graduates from RRC Polytech proudly wear School of Indigenous Education graduation stoles withtheir gowns to recognize their academic achievements. These beautiful stoles are embellished with symbols of the Seven Sacred Teachings, as well as symbols that represent our rich First Nations, Métis and Inuit cultures. You will also see the Assiniboine and Red Rivers represented throughout the design as a nod to the geography and history that have brought Indigenous Peoples to the land that RRC Polytech campuses are located on.\n\nOpening Messages\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nDear graduates,\n\nCongratulations and welcome to a distinguished family of proud RRC Polytech alumni.
