        "text": "I&I's\n\nBesides our core team of six that is spread out over Amsterdam and Accra, our superpowers come from our international community of collaborators. I&I stands for WE as one. Dr. Monk is in cahoots with an undercover society of creatives, thinkers, content experts, researchers, activists, planet lovers, treehuggers, fashion facists, curators, architects, scientists, writers, marketeers, humanitarians and vegetarians… each bringing in a special flavor to the mashup of dynamic, surprising, world changing ideas. They inspire and lift us up every day. For each project, we cherry-pick our wider team and consult our gurus. Here are a few examples of those around us:\n\n“Dr. Monk was always a mystery to me, but since I met Ama and Lynn he stands for the joyful celebration of life.”\n\nRuud Lubbers\n\nFormer Prime Minister of The Netherlands\n\n“Dr. Monk is refreshing, energizing and compelling in its role as linking pin in the transition to a new world. With all the required ideals and formatives you can imagine.”\n\nLaurens Smals\n\nSerial Entrepreneur in the Eye of the Storm\n\n“Dr. Monk, for the necessary positive counter-perspective”\n\nMarijke Winters\n\nProfessor, Motivator and Coach at Hogeschool Rotterdam and Far, Far Beyond\n\n“Some talk about changing the world. Others breathe it, live it and do it. That’s Dr. Monk.”\n\nDave Jongeneelen\n\nGame Changer and Chief Idealist at Better Future\n\n“When you work hard, you have to rest well.”\n\nOma Jan\n\nMost Beautiful, Humorous, Wise, Loving, Quote-Worthy Grandma\n\n“For out of the box and exceptionally creative advice, Dr. Monk is the one you need.”\n\nHerman Wijffels\n\nThe Prime Minister that The Netherlands Wished They Would Have\n\n“Rooted in this time’s spirit. Doers, creative, straight to the point, not afraid to experiment and extraordinarily fun and inspiring. Plus sustainable, engaged, hands on, connecting, interested, frontrunning and with a hearty laugh. So how do I say that in one sentence?”\n\nTed van den Bergh\n\nDirector and Connector at Triodos Foundation\n\n“You can't own land. You are born onto the land. You work on the land. Then you die and return to the land. It's ridiculous to think that you can own land.”\n\nTasi\n\nMost Strong, No-Nonsense, Cool, Sturdy, Grounded, Honest Grandma\n\n“Dr. Monk blends both African and European perspectives in their analysis of issues and creative crafting of solutions.”\n\nDorothy Gordon\n\nDirector-General of Ghana's first Advanced Information Technology Institute"
