        "text": "Today all of us at GRI pay homage to Ruud Lubbers, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands and UN High Commissioner of Refugees, who passed away at the age of 78. We honor Ruud Lubbers as the builder of a great legacy in the field of sustainability, and to cherish him for who he was as a person.\n\nRuud Lubbers told us at many occasions how he had discovered sustainability as the holy grail, when he led the Netherlands' delegation to the Earth Summit Rio in 1992, at that time as Prime Minister. Rio turned into a lifelong friendship with Maurice Strong and Mikhail Gorbachev, as well leading to the creation of the Earth Charter, of which Ruud Lubbers was the passionate co-leader for the remainder of his life.\n\nHe practiced what he preached. He was one of the first to drive an electric car, and he devoted most of his time to the global good through organizations like Earth Charter, GRI and the World Connectors. He strongly believed in GRI as a transformational force. He always used to promote the perfect fit between the Earth Charter and GRI. “Where the Earth Charter provides a moral charter for individual people and organizations on how to behave and relate, to protect mother nature for ourselves and the generations after us, GRI provides the standard to measure the performance of the Earth Charter norms” he said on many occasions. In 2010 we established an MoU between the two organizations. GRI was always there at the big Earth Charter events, and Ruud Lubbers spoke at four of GRI’s Global Conferences: in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2013.\n\nBut Ruud Lubbers was more than a public figure. He was a fellow traveler. He had an endless patience to listen and to advise all of us who were busy creating new movements and institutions.\n\nPeople sometimes refer to him as a distant, aloof person. To me he was a super engaged, passionate, warm and patient friend and sparring partner. When I worked as Director of Climate Change, he used to regularly pop in to my office for a cup of coffee and brainstorm on the international climate negotiations. And I spent endless conversations with him about the future strategy of GRI. He pulled me through difficult moments of this young organization, always helping me look beyond the horizon.\n\nForward attachment\n\nClick or press enter to display Ruud Lubbers at GRI conference.png in the image preview"
