        "text": "The United Nations and Supranational Organizations\n\nThe Westphalian system that resulted from the Thirty Years War (1618-48) emphasized the sovereignty of national states. Indeed, J. Bryan Hehir terms the system as built on two explicit propositions (state sovereignty, non-intervention) and one implicit idea (secularization of world politics). Only following World War I did decision-makers seek to add a specifically international component, the League of Nations. After its failure and the devastation of World War II, the United Nations formed in San Francisco in 1945.\n\nThe primary objective for forming the U.N. was a negative one, to prevent World War III, so the five major victorious powers all received a veto in the fifteen-member Security Council. All nations were represented in the General Assembly. The Secretary General ran the bureaucracy and exercised moral suasion, but did not have significant executive power. The names of those who have held the office of Secretary General, however, remind historians and the general public of the policy agendas of those particular periods as the United Nations became more involved with numerous international questions. The Secretary Generals were: Trygve Lie (Norway), 1945-52; Dag Hammarskjöld (Sweden), 1953-61; U Thant (Burma), 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim (Austria), 1972-81; Javier Pérez de Cuéllar (Peru), 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt), 1992-96; Kofi Annan (Ghana), 1997-2006; Ban Ki-Moon (South Korea), 2007-. In the beginning of the Cold War, the most desired U.N. stand seemed to be “impartiality,” often associated with Swedish leadership. This touchstone has been succeeded by the notion of “credibility” which includes the idea of “fairness” to all.\n\nOverall, the United Nations has done a lot of good through relief and development organizations like Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, currently led by Ruud Lubbers (Netherlands). With limited resources, the U.N. has produced a mixed record on both peacekeeping and human rights. Many institutional reform proposals have been advanced since 1945, but especially since the end of the Cold War in 1989. One partial reform was the changing of the Human Rights Commission to the slightly smaller Human Rights Council (see recent article below). The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights leads the global articulation of these issues in New York and in field offices throughout the globe. Since the establishment of the post as a result of the World Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993), it has been held by José Ayala Lasso (1994-97), Mary Robinson (1997-2002), Sergio Vieira de Mello (2002-3), and Louise Arbour (2004-8), Navi Pillay (2008-). The U.N. also hosts periodic global conferences which influence world public opinion, for example, the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995), and the U.N. Millennial Summit (New York, 2000).\n\nIn terms of other supranational organizations related to the U.N., those with economic portfolios tend to have the most executive authority: International Monetary Fund (IMF), International Labor Organization (ILO), World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO). Select development organizations are the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) administer specialized portfolios. Most people found out about International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the run up to the United States attack on Iraq in 2003, but it is the supranational organization on the issue of proliferation.\n\nKnight and Masciulli (below) place the United Nations at the juncture between the system of sovereign nation states and the multi-centric transnational system in the following section. Their book offers a seven-rule learning process of reform based on “the solidarity of strangers” and subsidiarity, assigning a task to the lowest possible effective level of governance.\n\nA Global Ethic and The United Nations.\n\nA Short Introductory Course:\n\nNowak’s chapter presents a fine analysis of the entire topic. The collection by Knight focuses on the changes in the international systems that influence reform. The conclusion by Knight and Joseph Masciulli is particularly good at making the case for the necessity of the U.N. and its reform in the contemporary global system. Kennedy and Traub offer excellent contrasting and complimentary views of the possibilities of such reform at the present moment. Both also provide a fine historical introduction, with Traub focusing on the recent relations of the U.N. and its most powerful member. The Kille volumn discusses the ethical role of U.N. Secretary Generals.\n\nChapter Four, “The United Nations,” in Nowak, Manfred. Introduction to the International Human Rights Regime (Leiden: Matinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2003), 73-156.\n\nW.

The UN Secretary-General and Moral Authority: Ethics & Religion in International Leadership (Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 2007). The book asks, \"Does the ethical fremework of an individual office holder impact the role played by a secretary-general?\" It argues for \"a combination of personal values that establish the beliefs, forms of reasoning, and interpretations of the world that guide an individual in making judgments about proper behavior in specific contexts.\" (p. 20). There are individual chapters on Trygve Lie, Dag Hammarskjold, U Thant, Kurt Waldheim, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and Kofi Annan, and three integrating chapters.\n\nOther Resource Materials:\n\nChapter Two, “The United Nations Human Rights System,” in Buergenthal, Thomas, Shelton, Dinah, and Stewart, David.
