        "text": "In 1974, the then Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Ruud Lubbers, opened Sekisui Jushi Strapping’s first factory beyond the borders of Japan in the city of Roermond (Limburg, the Netherlands).\n\nAt the time, the mines were closing in the Dutch region of Limburg. The various economic incentives put in place by the Dutch government and the large available labour force convinced Sekisui Jushi Strapping to establish a factory in Roermond. And thanks to the skill, reliability, and enthusiasm of the local employees, it very soon proved to be the right choice.\n\nThe first factory in Roermond soon outgrew its original site, and in 1990, the company moved a kilometre up the road to a new location that was twice as large. At the same time, a British sales office was set up to satisfy the growing demand in the United Kingdom.\n\nSekisui Jushi continues to innovate and reinvent itself. Over the years, this commitment has enabled us to maintain and build further upon our position as market leader in the manufacturing of plastic strapping. In July 2006, these efforts resulted in the award of the ISO 9001:2000 quality standard, which was replaced by the ISO 9001:2008 quality standard in 2009. Throughout the years, we have maintained and exceeded these quality standards.\n\nAs of 1 January 2011, the sales and manufacturing of strapping was consolidated within a separate company: Sekisui Jushi Strapping BV, part of the Roermond-based Sekisui Jushi Holdings BV.\n\nIn 2013, we invested in new printing techniques, enabling high-quality and extremely readable printing on PP strapping as well as printed PET strapping.\n\nThe history of Sekisui Jushi Strapping BV:\n\n1974\n\nOpening of the Sekisui Jushi Strapping factory in Roermond (the Netherlands) by Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Ruud Lubbers – the first Sekisui Jushi factory outside Japan.\n\n1990\n\nRelocation to a larger location 1 km up the road from the original site.\n\n1990\n\nOpening of a sales office in the United Kingdom.\n\n2005\n\nInvestment in a new line of narrower strapping.\n\n2006\n\nISO 9001:2000 certification awarded.\n\n2009\n\nISO 9001:2008 certification awarded to replace the previous ISO certificate.\n\n2011\n\nCompany name changed to Sekisui Jushi Strapping BV. Under the name Jislon, the traffic-safety division became an independently operating company within Sekisui Jushi Europe Holdings BV.\n\n2013\n\nInvestment in new printing techniques.\n\n2017\n\nInvestment in a new product line."
