        "text": "Former Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers resigned yesterday as head of the United Nations refugee agency, saying he was insulted at the way the UN was handling allegations against him of sexual harassment.\n\nJust two days after insisting that he would stay in his post, Mr Lubbers released a letter of resignation he sent to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan after meeting him in New York on Friday to discuss the affair.\n\nMr Annan, who had said the case was not strong enough when the allegations first surfaced last year, appeared to change his mind after details were published in the British daily The Independent on Friday.\n\nAlthough Mr Lubbers, who has always proclaimed his innocence, came out of the meeting saying that he would continue, Mr Annan's office implied there was a doubt by saying that the discussions had focused on Mr Lubbers' future in the organisation.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Lubbers suggested it was Mr Annan's apparent change of mind that had forced him to stand down, adding that the way the matter had been handled added insult to injury.\n\n\"To be frank, and despite all my loyalty, insult has been added to injury and therefore I resign as High Commissioner,\" Mr Lubbers wrote.\n\nLast summer the organization's watchdog, the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services, said allegations against Mr Lubbers by four women in the UNHCR constituted a prime facia case and recommended \"appropriate actions\".\n\nBut Mr Annan rejected the report. His spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said Mr Annan \"did not say there was no evidence\" but that \"he found the allegations unsustainable on a legal basis\"."
