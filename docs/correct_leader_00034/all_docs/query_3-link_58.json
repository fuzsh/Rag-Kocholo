        "text": "It was over lunch in a top-class Paris restaurant that Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, unexpectedly popped the question to his guest Ruud Lubbers, a professor of globalisation at Tilburg university in the Netherlands, and that country's prime minister for 12 years until 1994.\n\nWould Mr Lubbers like to head the world's major agency for helping refugees, the UNHCR?\n\n\"I was surprised,\" Mr Lubbers told a small group of top staff at the UNHCR's headquarters in Geneva recently.\"I knew very little about the issue. I had not applied for the job.\" But surprises had been part of his career, he added.\n\nIf he was amazed by the job offer, the Netherlands' Labour government was furious. It had nominated Jan Pronk, the minister for international development, for the UNHCR post. Wim Kok, the prime minister put out a terse statement \"regretting\" the decision to bypass Mr Pronk but added, patriotically, that he was glad \"an able, experienced and former prime minister, and another Dutchman was chosen\".\n\nThe episode perfectly summed up the two problems with top UN appointments. Rich western governments feel they own the top jobs in the big money-spending programmes, rotating them among themselves. The secretary general, who makes the appointments, is not required to have a short-list, let alone advertise the job or give the initial screening to a selection panel.\n\nMany former senior staff at the UN criticise the system, but nothing has been done to change it, despite lip service to reforming the UN.\n\n\"I'm not sure the secretary general should start from the position that Ruritania should get a particular post,\" says Sir Marrack Goulding, who served as under-secretary general for political affairs until 1997. \"We need to have a much more transparent set of procedures for doing this.\"\n\n\"What is unacceptable, and it happens all the time, is that governments put pressure on the secretary general to appoint the person they want. This is unfair on the secretary general,\" he adds.\n\nColonel Terry Taylor, the assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an independent think-tank that focuses on the study of conflict, served as a political affairs officer at UN headquarters in New York in the mid-1990s. He believes changes in the selection procedure are needed.\n\n\"We should make people compete for the top jobs and force governments to say why they wouldn't find a particular person acceptable,\" he argues.\n\nIn the UNHCR case, according to a former diplomat who represented his country on the UN security council, the Dutch probably felt they had a right to a top job \"because they are a loyal and energetic member of the UN which pays a lot into the budget and haven't had a Dutchman at a senior level for a number of years\".\n\nThe UNHCR, led for the past decade by Japan's Sadako Ogata, is close to bankruptcy after a shortfall in funding by the 14 governments which usually provide about 98% of its money; the body took $40m of its $50m (£33m) in capital reserves last autumn to cover running costs.\n\nDonors for broke UNHCR\n\nStaff are hoping that, as a former prime minister from western Europe, Mr Lubbers will have the clout to get donors to be more generous for this year's huge projected budget of $953m (£635m).\n\nAnother controversial recent appointment, that of Kenzo Oshima to head the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), was done on Mr Annan's own initiative.\n\nAccording to a senior UN insider, the secretary general is dissatisfied with the work of a particular Japanese senior official in another post in the UN and wishes to remove him. To keep Tokyo happy, (it is, after all, another major UN donor), he asked the Japanese government to nominate someone to head OCHA. When Tokyo picked Mr Oshima, who runs the department of international peace co-operation in the Japanese prime minister's office, Mr Annan appointed him.\n\nUnder the UN charter, jobs are required to reflect an equitable geographical distribution that would befit a world body.\n\nFor the roughly 1,800 jobs in the secretariat in New York, a country's economic weight, as reflected in its budget dues to the UN, plays a role. Britain had 56 of these 1,800 jobs in New York, or 3%, according to figures from the mid-1990s.\n\nWhen the figures are broken down for the senior jobs - those at department-head level and above - Britain had 10 out of 210, or 5%, corresponding exactly to its contribution to the overall budget.\n\nThe picture changes radically when it comes to the under-secretary general level and the heads of the main funds and programmes, such as the UNHCR, the UN Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the UN Development Programme and the UN Population Fund.\n\nThese are mainly staffed by people from the wealthiest countries, with the United States disproportionately represented.\n\nGiven that Washington has for years refused to pay its dues in full, this discrepancy has caused major resentment. These appointments are all made by the secretary general.\n\nThe \"agencies\" of the United Nations - the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF - have separate systems of staffing and paying the top jobs, over which Mr Annan has no control.\n\nThe UN secretariat's salaries are said by the UN to be around half those of the European Union, Nato and the World Bank.\n\nSome governments are believed to top up the pay of their nationals who have top UN jobs, although this is against UN rules.\n\nBritain calls for reform\n\nBritain has been making low-key calls for reform since the Labour government gained office. \"We must have a UN whose staff and leadership represent all the countries of the world, but they must be recruited and promoted on the basis of their ability to do the job, not their nationality or political connections,\" Clare Short, the secretary of state for international development, told a New York audience in October 1999.\n\nSince then, she has put more detail into her ideas, calling in last month's white paper on globalisation for \"open and competitive processes for the selection of top management\".\n\n\"This could include a definition of the competencies for the post, selection and search committees,\" the paper said, \"and a clear process for taking the final decision, in which competence would be put above considerations of nationality.\"\n\nPosts filled by the secretary general\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees\n\nThe UNHCR assists 22m refugees, many in camps, and is responsible for protecting asylum-seekers worldwide\n\nHead Ruud Lubbers, Netherlands\n\nAnnual salary $196,590 (£131,000)\n\nUN Population Fund\n\nThe UNFPA supports regional programmes which give advice on family planning and safe motherhood, based on empowering women\n\nHead Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, Saudi Arabia\n\nSalary $196,590\n\nOffice for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\nOCHA provides emergency relief for victims of natural disasters\n\nHead Kenzo Oshima, Japan\n\nSalary $196, 590\n\nThe UNDP supports democratic governance, development and poverty reduction, and publishes the influential annual Human Development Report\n\nHead Mark Malloch Brown, Britain Salary $196,590\n\nWorld Food Programme\n\nThe WFP is the frontline agency for shipping food to famine victims.
