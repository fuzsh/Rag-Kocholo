        "text": "Lubbers, a conservative who argued for \"more markets, less government\" and a closer European Union, passed away on Wednesday in his home city of Rotterdam, the Dutch government announced. No cause of death was given.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the Netherlands had \"lost a statesman with huge stature\" and went on to praise Lubbers for his commitment to Europe and as a \"world citizen\" who was \"intelligent and wise.\"\n\n\"He knew how to find a solution to every problem,\" Rutte added.\n\nLubbers, a Christian Democrat from a Rotterdam engineering and machinery family, who studied economics and then headed an employers' federation, formed his first government in 1982 with the liberal VVD party, on a pledge to cut back the Dutch welfare state.\n\nHis slogan \"more markets, less government\" prompted conflict with trade unions but earned him a reputation for the \"Dutch model\" of spurring the economy to create more jobs.\n\nKey role at Maastricht\n\nIn his third consecutive term, he formed a grand coalition with center-left Social Democrats in 1989, and played a key role in late 1991 when the Netherlands hosted an EU summit that formulated the bloc's Maastricht Treaty focused on political integration.\n\nThe accord, signed in early 1992, also laid the groundwork for the shared euro currency.\n\nWhen he stepped down in the Dutch election year 1994, he had become the Netherland's longest-serving prime minister.\n\nHis 12 years in office had included his persuading parliament to accept the deployment of NATO European missiles in the Netherlands and ambitious conservation projects across the densely populated low-lying nation.\n\nWWF and then UNHCR\n\nAfter stints in academia, bids for top jobs at the European Commission and NATO, and criticism of Germany's then-chancellor, Helmut Kohl, Lubbers went on to serve as president of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in 2000, before becoming the head of the UNHCR refugee agency in 2001.\n\nBombing of Afghanistan wrong\n\nA month after the 9/11 airline hijacker attacks on New York and Washington, Ludders rejected US bombardment of largely Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.\n\nHe told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper in October 2001 that less US military action, not more, combined with aid agency assistance, would minimize the \"danger of a conflagration.\"\n\nAs UNHCR commissioner he had urged the United States: \"no revenge, no disproportionate reprisal attacks that will inevitably cause larger refugee flows and human suffering.\"\n\nResignation\n\nHis UNHCR post was extended in 2003 but in 2005 he was forced to step down over sexual harassment allegations, which he rejected as defamatory.\n\nIn latter years, when the Netherlands had difficulties forming coalition governments, Queen Beatrix reportedly called in Lubbers as adviser and intermediary.\n\nDutch broadcaster NOS said Lubbers had long suffered from an unspecified illness.\n\nipj/kms (AFP, AP, Reuters, Munzinger-Archive)"
