        "text": "IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION A former UN employee had sued former Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers over a 2003 incident in which he pressed his groin against her\n\nAP\n\nA federal judge threw out a lawsuit by a UN employee whose sexual harassment claims led to the resignation of refugee chief Ruud Lubbers, reasoning that the agency?? immunity outweighs her claims.\n\nUS District Judge Robert Sweet tossed out the lawsuit on Tuesday, saying that courts have ??onsistently held that employment-related issues lie at the core of an international organization?? immunity.??br />\n\nA decision by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the defendants were immune from this lawsuit left him nothing to decide, Sweet said.\n\nUS citizen Cynthia Brzak, 55, had sued Lubbers, the former prime minister of the Netherlands, along with former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and six others, saying she was grabbed in a sexual manner by Lubbers after a December 2003 business meeting in his Geneva office.\n\nAt the time, Lubbers was the UN high commissioner for refugees, in charge of one of the largest UN agencies, with a staff of 5,000 in 120 countries and an annual budget of about US$1 billion.\n\nLubbers resigned in February 2005 because of the attention caused by the scandal. Brzak continues to work for the UN in Geneva, although her lawsuit said she has faced retaliation since she made her harassment claims.\n\nLubbers has denied that he put his arms around Brzak?? waist and pulled her back toward him as he pressed his groin against her.\n\nAn investigation by the UN watchdog concluded in June 2004 that he did engage in unwanted physical contact with Brzak, a subordinate. It also said it learned of new allegations against him during its probe, indicating a ??attern of sexual harassment by Mr. Lubbers.??br />\n\nThe report by Dileep Nair, undersecretary-general for Internal Oversight Services, recommended Lubbers be punished for misconduct and abuse of authority after saying he engaged in ??ntense, pervasive and intimidating attempts to influence the outcome of this investigation.??br />\n\nAnnan rejected the report?? conclusions because he said the allegations could not be substantiated. At the time, he refused to fire Lubbers.\n\nA message left with an attorney for the defendants was not immediately returned on Wednesday.\n\nBrzak?? Geneva-based lawyer, Edward Flaherty, said in a telephone interview that he was disappointed the court never got beyond the immunity issue. He promised to appeal.\n\n??t?? Alice in Wonderland law. The United Nations is the only organization that functions like this,??he said.\n\nBrzak has suffered since filing her claims against Lubbers, Flaherty said.\n\n??he?? been harassed, ostracized, denied meaningful work,??he said. ??f you did this in the United States, these people would be paying millions.?"
