BRITISH POPULAR FILMS 1929–1939 In a field generally neglected by film scholarship, British Popular Films 1929–1939 makes a valuable contribution to the social and British film history of the period. Stephen Shafer’s study of the role of cinema in 1930s British society uses research on the early cinema to offer original answers to questions such as why the British public was not more critical and disruptive during the economic hardship and unemployment of the Great Depression. Shafer’s study challenges the conventional historical assumption that British feature films during the thirties were mostly orientated toward the middle classes. Instead, he makes the critical distinction between films intended for West-End and international circulation and those intended primarily for domestic, working-class audiences. Far from being alienated by a “middle-class institution,” working men and women flocked to see pictures featuring music-hall luminaries such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. This contention is supported by an impressive amount of new research into unexplored source material, from statistics of working-class cinema-going to letters in fan magazines. From these fascinating letters, cinema itself emerges as the only solace that made life bearable during the Depression (it was listed by one Leeds shop girl, along with food and shelter, as one of the necessities of life). Significantly, escapist films such as High Society, Pygmalion, and The Lambeth Walk were box-office hits in the impoverished industrial north. Shafer’s detailed analysis of individual films helps to build up our understanding of contemporary attitudes, perceptions, and values, and offers a partial answer to why British society survived the strain of the slump and Depression. A major study of British cinema during the thirties, British Popular Films will also prove indispensable for historians of modern Britain and all those concerned with popular culture. Stephen C.Shafer has created and taught courses in film and history at the University of Illinois over the past twenty years. He currently serves as Assistant Dean in the University’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. He is a member of the British Film Institute, the American Historical Association, the Society for Cinema Studies, and the Popular Culture Association.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This book is a product of a longstanding interest in the history of motion pictures and specifically in the relationship between film and the history of this century. My college and graduate work centered on an interdisciplinary approach to history; during my graduate studies in modern British history, my focus began to shift to a growing fascination with the products of the British film industry, which seemed to me remarkably unappreciated both critically and academically, as a possible resource in examining the country’s social history. The result was a doctoral dissertation some years ago from which this work has evolved with the benefit of years of additional research and of teaching film and history. In the preparation of this study, I have had the assistance and support of a substantial number of individuals who have provided me with suggestions and encouragement. First and foremost, I am especially grateful to Professor Walter Arnstein of the University of Illinois whose calm, reasoned, and sensible advice enabled me to initiate my study in the first place and who has been a source of continuing inspiration both professionally as a scholar and teacher and personally as a friend. The earliest drafts of this material additionally had the benefit of the observations and comments of Professors John Frayne, Caroline Hibbard, and J.Alden Nichols, all of the University of Illinois. I also cherish many lengthy conversations on film and British history early in my work with Professor Randall McGowen of the University of Oregon, with Professor Jim Huston of Oklahoma State University, and with Dr Esther Simon Shkolnik. In particular, I want to thank Mr Gary Steller of Burlington College who read an early version of this work and provided me with excellent stylistic suggestions. Also, a portion of this material was presented to the Midwest Conference on British Studies and to the British History Association of the University of Illinois, and I am grateful for the comments and suggestions I received at that time. Although my primary duties at the University of Illinois center on my responsibilities as an Assistant Dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, for over twenty years I periodically have taught courses in the History Department here, and I am grateful for the encouragement I have received from many individuals in the department who have been supportive. In particular, I wish to express my gratitude to my friend and colleague, Professor John Dahl, now retired from the University of Illinois with whom I first began teaching Film and History in the 1970s. In recent years, I have had the benefit of the insights and encouragement from my teaching colleague, Professor Fred Jaher, also of the University of Illinois. In addition, I value and appreciate my association with the excellent faculty members of the university’s Unit for Cinema Studies; I especially wish to express my thanks to the Assistant Director of the Unit, Dr Richard Leskosky, whose expertise and friendship I have enjoyed for years. I also want to thank Associate Dean Robert Copeland of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences who has been supportive of my completion of this project. I also am grateful to the many students I have encountered

in the classes I have taught over the past twenty years; they have proven to be a continuing source of inspiration to me, and I have delighted in the insights and enthusiasm I have derived from them. I also would like to thank the staff of the British Film Institute’s Library in London which provided continuous assistance in finding the treasures in their outstanding collections during the two summers of research I spent in London some years ago. The staff of the University of Illinois Library also has provided invaluable help in enabling me to make use of the outstanding collection of film materials that have been assembled in Urbana. Since British films from this period are so difficult to find and screen, particularly in the Midwest of the United States, I have depended heavily on the resources in these libraries to locate information about the making of the films themselves and about their plots, in periodicals, screenplays, and other sources. The assistance I have received in tracking down many hard-to-find materials, and in the case of the University of Illinois Library, in acquiring some very obscure items, has been invaluable. I also want to extend my appreciation to Ms Sandy Fitzgerald who has done an excellent job in typing the various manuscript revisions of this book and in transferring the text into disk form. A special note of appreciation must be expressed to three individuals without whose help this project never would have been realized. I owe an immense debt of gratitude to Professor Tony Aldgate who first noticed this study in its earlier form as a doctoral dissertation and who subsequently suggested that it be revised for publication. I have long admired Professor Aldgate’s work, and I was honored by the fact that he regarded my efforts as worthy not only of his attention but also of revision for publication. His suggestions and advice were especially helpful at a late stage in the preparation of this manuscript. Likewise, I wish to thank Ms Rebecca Barden of Routledge for her continuing interest in seeing this project through to publication in spite of the fact that completion was delayed on a variety of occasions. In the course of the years since I began work on this book I have experienced numerous setbacks caused by an almost incredible string of misfortunes and personal grief, from a devastating flood which resulted in the loss of some research materials, to the deaths of both of my parents. Ms Barden’s patience and encouragement enabled me to complete this project at a point when it otherwise might have been abandoned. I also wish to thank Katherine Hodkinson for all her help in the editing stage of this project. Over the years, I have been blessed with the insights I have gained from a number of very dear friends who have enriched me not only with their interest in my work but also with their encouragement. In that regard I want to thank Keith Peterson, Barry Birnbaum, and, especially, Richard Harris of the Chicago Sun Times, with whom I have exchanged a number of ideas and comments about my research in the course of our friendship. John Jackanicz, whose knowledge of film and social history is exceptional, read an earlier version of this study and has offered helpful comments and suggestions over the years; he also alerted me to rare film showings from this period in the Chicago metropolitan area and kindly tolerated my presence as an extended houseguest when the Chicago Film Festival ran a series of British musicals from the thirties a number of years ago. I also want to thank my friend, Larry Goldenberg, whose judgments about films are invariably on target and whose knowledge of the film industry is encyclopedic, for his insight about

motion picture history and for his supportive comments over the many years of our friendship; Mr Goldenberg also kept me informed on important related film events in and around Chicago. I also want to express special thanks to three individuals who have been especially helpful to me. Jeff Moll provided an inestimable degree of help in the early stages of this project with his assistance on the statistical aspect of this study. Aside from introducing me to the joys of word processing, my loyal friend George M.Kwain read through an earlier version of this study and made several worthwhile suggestions; he also helped me locate several obscure films, and with his wonderful sense of humor, helped me retain my perspective at various difficult moments. Also Donald Jackanicz of the United States National Archives has made numerous helpful and supportive suggestions to me about my research over the many years of our friendship; on a number of occasions, Don has taken time out of busy trips to places like London, New York, or Los Angeles to track down in obscure bookshops volumes and research materials I have needed. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to my late grandparents, Matthew and Eleanor Koch, and to my late parents, Edison H. and Shirley Shafer, for their continual support for my scholarly efforts. In particular, I want to recognize the importance of my parents’ contribution. Although they did not live to see this book published, they had a great deal to do with the fact that it came to be written in the first place; because of their careers in music and show business, I developed an early and continuing fascination with the entertainment industry and its relationship to modern life, and accordingly their spirit lives on in every single page of this book. I also cannot express deeply enough my gratitude to my wonderful wife Sue, who typed the very first version of this work, and to my daughter Karen for the sacrifices they both endured in making this book a reality. No one could have better encouragement and support than I have had from my wife and daughter, and I am eternally grateful to them. In concluding, I also would like to thank three wonderful British performers whose work I came to love and admire—Miss Jessie Matthews, Mr Jack Buchanan, and Miss Gracie Fieldsfor making my exploration of British films such an enjoyable and delightful research project. Of course, I am responsible for any and all errors. Dr Stephen C.Shafer June, 1996

1 INTRODUCTION For the historian, the examination of films has provided a useful means of exploring the taste and values of different periods of the twentieth century. Numerous studies have assessed the relationships of the various national film industries to the societies in which they operated. Among the most interesting of these works are several that have dealt with American society during the ordeal of the Great Depression in the 1930s; for instance, Andrew Bergman’s We’re in the Money utilized effectively the content of the films themselves to show certain preoccupations in Hollywood’s response to the economic crisis in the United States. Other studies have examined the response of the film industries in other nations to the Great Depression, particularly in France, Germany, and Italy.1 But, amazingly, while attention in film scholarship has been focused on this general issue, one of the most significant of the national film industries until recently has been uniformly neglected. In fact, the British film industry in the 1930s, at the time one of the largest in the world, has been mostly forgotten. The common perception of the contribution of Britain to world cinema is that it helped pioneer the documentary film, and less significantly, that it provided a genuine, if only temporary, challenge to Hollywood in the period after the Second World War. The usual conclusion about British movies of the 1930s, however, is that they are not really worth studying, and if discussed at all, they usually are dismissed aesthetically with a contemptuous reference to the “quota quickies” and with adjectives like “amateurish” and “stodgy.” Another conclusion frequently reached about British films during the thirties is that they were “stage-bound” and, accordingly, not popular with the working class. For instance, George Perry, in his survey of British film, referred to the “glut of stage adaptations” and the plotlines reflecting the “mores of the country drawing room” that predominated during this period; citing the “stilted delivery,” the “cinematic inexperience,” and the “cultured West End accent” of screen actors as an annoyance to popular audiences, Perry asserted that good British cinema had evolved into a middle-class institution at a time of “misery, poverty, and unemployment for the working classes,” and he determined that “most British films failed absolutely to sense the mood of the audience.”2 This conclusion, hastily arrived at, commonly shared and repeated, from survey to survey, is contrary to fact. An exploration of the films themselves shows a remarkable diversity and range; in many cases, neglected or forgotten features from this period hold up incredibly well and demonstrate a quality that utterly surprises one, after reading the usually disparaging comments in most general surveys. Undoubtedly this poor reputation was a product of a general impression of the low-budget movies made to satisfy provisions of the “Quota Act.” The quota was a product of the Cinematograph Films Act passed by Parliament in 1927 which established the percentage of British films that an

exhibitor was required to rent in any one year. Because of block booking, in which exhibitors were required to show a package of films sight unseen, a condition demanded by American distributors, the British film industry had slumped alarmingly by the mid 1920s. Discussions had continued since the war years on ways to deal with the problem of facilitating British production. After extended debate, Parliament approved a requirement that beginning in 1928, a quota of British films, initially only 5 percent of the features shown, but rising by statute to 20 percent by 1935, had to be exhibited. All films would have to be registered with the Board of Trade, and a time limit for booking was imposed. Although the result was to generate new films and new companies, an unfortunate by-product was the emergence of cheaply made “quota quickies” which could then be booked inexpensively to meet the requirement. American distributors then acquired these often poorly crafted British features for release in the UK in order to meet the government’s quota requirement and legally circulate Hollywood films; other companies met the requirement by setting up their own production facilities and releasing their own low budget offerings. In this manner, the letter of the law could be met. Although some of these low-budget films—like many “Poverty Row” productions in Hollywood that were sometimes shot in as little as four to seven days—were undeniably of poor quality because of the inexperience of many of the people involved, others proved surprisingly worthwhile and even good. The rapid expansion and the looser standards of the companies that supplied quota films gave many prominent movie figures their start in the industry. Unfortunately, the reputation of the poorer movies made under this system caused the general term “quota film” to become, unfairly, synonymous with the term “bad film”; as Charles Davy noted in 1937, this arrangement “helped Hollywood further by serving as a usefully bad advertisement for British production.”3 When the Cinematograph Act was renewed after the first ten years, following recommendations by a Parliamentary investigative committee under the direction of Lord Moyne, revisions were made to discourage the “quota quickies”; specifically, a minimum budget was required for a film to qualify, and the percentage of required films was dropped temporarily to twelve and a half percent for renters and fifteen percent for exhibitors, later to rise to thirty and twenty-five percent respectively. As a result, in the late thirties, MGM and other Hollywood units began to make higher quality films in England. But the basic conclusion that “quota films” were all necessarily bad or that all British films were somehow tainted by the quota structure is fundamentally wrong.4 Similarly, the conclusion that all British films were “stage-bound” drawingroom dramas is also fallacious; while it was true that in the first years of the sound era producers searching around desperately for properties naturally relied on stage vehicles, the great majority of films were created from original stories or were based on novels and stories already published. As the decade went on the reliance on plays was substantially reduced so that by the last three years of the decade, as Table 1.1 demonstrates, fewer than one in five films were taken from stage plays.

Additionally, to assume that all plays were necessarily “middle-class” in nature is to ignore the tradition of provincial and working-class dramas and music-hall sketches (these were not automatically distinguished from legitimate West-End stage plays in credits). Correspondingly, the number of films based on novels and stories increased as the decade went on, as Table 1.2 reveals. Presumably, the films based on novels or radio plays (as listed in Table 1.3) removed any temptation to depend on a “proscenium arch” filming approach to the dramatic property. In fact, until very recently, the primary inspiration for most British films and the source of most film performers in the thirties have seldom been

discussed in the literature; that source was the music hall, which was only fitting, since the “halls” had been the primary purveyor of entertainment for the English working classes prior to the age of motion pictures. Ironically, these exiles from the music hall, who were not completely committed to the artificial conventions of stage tradition, gave the most realistic portrayals on the screen. Film-maker Alberto Cavalcanti called attention to the versatility of music hall performers, who were attracted to a medium in which they could personify a wide variety of types because they were “unfettered by the rigid dignity of the drama” and, accordingly could “turn themselves to any subject”; he refers to the “almost documentary aspect” of the films in which music hall performers appeared, and observed that the stories, settings, and backgrounds “were those of everyday life” which made them appealing “to all classes of the public” and gave them

more “social importance” because they were “closer to contemporary problems.”5 In another context, John Fisher reminisced about the extraordinary personal popularity of the great music hall comedians who were revered “not merely for the laughter they raised” but also “because of the basic social identity they shared with the bulk of their audiences”; Fisher added that “with their origins [and] their attitudes often firmly rooted in the working class” the screen images of these variety stars were “fixed in this world” so that they “could at the same time be identified as ordinary people and as stars in spite of themselves.”6 With the onset of sound, these performers could project not only the visual characteristics but also the aural qualities of everyday life, endearing themselves to the movie-going public. Individuals like Ernie Lotinga, and his character Jimmy Josser, Will Hay, and his befuddled Narkover educational authority figure, Max Miller and his cheeky “chappie,” the Lupino family (Wallace, Barry, and Stanley), George Robey, Violet Loraine, and dozens of other headliners came to the screen in the thirties and promptly created highly memorable characters. One of the most prominent of these music hall performers was Arthur Lucan, whose “Old Mother Riley” washer-woman character not only made a successful shift to the screen, but also became the central figure in one of the longest lasting movie series in British film history. Though admittedly a farce caricature, “Old Mother Riley” is a good case study of this type of portrayal and helps to show the appeal of such music hall performers’ work. Lucan’s make-up and costume evoked a realistic impression of the harshness of life for the working classes; regardless of whether the situations being portrayed were farcical in nature, his rubbery, bony features when garbed in a long dress, shabby shawl, and tattered bonnet provided a remarkably authentic vision of real life existence to which working-class audiences responded. Fisher describes Lucan’s “legendary” characterization in spite of its “absurdity” as being “subtle” and “humane” with a “definite credibility, a strict, even if zany fidelity to working class life”; he adds that her gossipy character and her “reliance upon the lesser creature comforts, namely her chair, her fire, and her gin” along with her “determination and strength in shortened circumstances” all worked together to evoke, in spite of her vulgarity, the “touching portrayal of someone who was only too true a figure…of the British social structure.”7 Fisher noted that the character, also, in a humorous way, touched upon the problems of poverty in old age by concentrating on “unwantedness…loneliness, and ill-health.”8 What is significant about this popular character was “the neglect of Old Mother Riley by the West End” which, Fisher pointed out, was “characteristic of the attitude which existed towards the…unsophisticated provinces”; Lucan’s films found their “readiest audience” in the “North country market” in Lancashire and Yorkshire, though the character itself “represent[ed] a unique hotch-potch of provincial traits” including the “quaint illogicality and endearing blarney” that was the “unmistakably Irish” persona “of the Liverpool dockside and neighboring industrial towns.”9 Because the movies of these transplanted music hall stars like Arthur Lucan rarely played the influential West End, critics rarely wrote about them, except in terms of ridicule. Consequently, they have been largely ignored by social historians and forgotten by students of film. And yet, throughout the decade of the 1930s, British moviegoers flocked to see pictures by music hall luminaries from the industrial North of England such as the legendary Gracie Fields and the popular singer-comedian George Formby, who was often praised as the “male Gracie Fields.”10

British popular films 1929—1939

These music hall performers often accompanied their screen portrayals with popular songs. Formby, the “gormless” comic son of the famous music hall veteran George Formby, senior, for instance, was best known for the humorous, slightly naughty, but invariably cheery tunes that he sang in his films in the late thirties. The songs which he performed while accompanying himself on a ukulele became extremely popular records, and as Formby became Britain’s box office leader in the latter part of the decade, his discs sold millions. The words of the songs invariably conveyed a sense of optimism and wishfulness. For example, the tune “Feather Your Nest,” from the film of the same name, (lyrics by Formby and veteran song writers Harry Gifford and Fred E.Cliffe), imagines what a couple would do when they finally get rich, and their speculations center on the fun they might have in a “lovely bathroom all new.” The rather mundane idea that riches might bring a real bathroom reminds us of the assorted luxuries, such as bathrooms, that were not taken for granted in the thirties. Similarly, in “Hitting the High Spots Now,” written by the same trio, from Trouble Brewing, with lyrics that are vaguely reminiscent of the American Depression tune “We’re in the Money,” Formby reminds his audience that optimism is often the key to success. The song is suffused with notions such as “grey skies are turning blue” and that “troubles over—I’m in clover. Everything’s OK.” The character adds that all his “frowns have turned to smiles” and that there are “no wrinkles” on his brow.

I feel like a millionaire, I’m all deluxe, and how! I’m in the money, tasting the money. Hitting the high spots now. The main philosophy of the song is a conclusion that all of this good fortune emerges from a fairly simple attitude:

Life is what you make it, so make it worthwhile. Whatever comes, just take it. You’ve got to swing along and get in rhythm. In so doing, the singer is “on top of the world” and is “making good, and how!” Indeed, he is “living like a lord,” although in a musical aside, he adds “the Lord knows who, or how.” The emphasis, then, is on forbearance, with the clear conclusion that in keeping an optimistic viewpoint, one can be “Hitting the high spots now!” Even in unashamedly “escapist” features, certain messages implicit in the film’s content could be suggested to the audiences troubled by the economic woes they encountered each day. Because these films were “escapist” in nature, they have not been regarded seriously. Yet the very fact that these features were “escapist,” that is, movies designed to take a viewer out of reality, can often make them more valuable to the social historian than so-called “serious films,” for in this “escapism” can be found the dreams and aspirations of people whose lives are troubled and pain-filled.

Introduction

The assumption that British films did not address the needs of the working classes, and that they were not appealing to them, therefore must be reevaluated. In many cases, far from ignoring the laboring poor, the movies were directed toward them, focusing in a light-hearted way on their problems, preoccupations, and day-to-day concerns. But such involvement with the working classes ordinarily did not occur in films employing theatrical performers. The proximity of the West End to the British studios meant that many performers in the theaters in the evening could be in films for extra money during the day. The attitude of these stage actors toward the films they were making was at best condescending, and often contemptuous. In his memoirs, George Arliss, for one, openly admitted this elitist attitude: he said that the stage actors were decidedly “snobbish” and felt that they were “superior” to screen actors who had been tempted by the availability of “vulgar money” to appear in the movies. He observed that the London actors were “particularly uppish” because they “appeared before the Best People” and were upholding “the honor of our profession”; indeed, they feared that if they “stepped down into movies,” they would “lose prestige” and never again be regarded as “superior actors.” Not until economic necessity and theatrical unemployment required some income would a stage actor be likely to lower himself to appear in films. This attitude provided opportunities for many non-featured performers. As Arliss put it, “small part” actors “whose ‘profession’ was in the habit of neglecting them for periods of six to nine months at a stretch” often “came to the conclusion that honor was likely to get a trifle tarnished if it wasn’t polished up with a little butcher’s meat now and then.” By taking the film roles that the more distinguished stage luminaries disdained, those actors who traditionally “all their lives had had to fight for a living” now “found themselves actually in demand…receiving salaries such as they could not have believed possible”; but Arliss concludes, they could never have reached such success “if the superior class had been a little closer at their heels.”11 With this kind of contempt for movie work and for the film public, the fact that some of the features playing the West End were unappealing to the working classes would not seem surprising and accounts for some of the negative criticism of movies. A sense of vitality was more prevalent in the lower budgeted, but more widely appreciated movies starring music hall trained performers. In the British cinema, then, two major trends (one deriving from legitimate stage plays and the other from the music halls) arose following the introduction of sound; these trends were paralleled by the distribution patterns of the movies themselves, with the features starring music hall performers playing in the provinces but never playing in the West End, and with prestige productions with legitimate stage actors having trouble at the box-office outside London. The effect of this division in British film production has tended to create a misconception about the themes and approaches in the films produced during this decade. Certainly, the cinema had become a continuous, vital, meaningful influence in the lives of British citizens, particularly those in the laboring classes, for whom it had taken on the quality almost of a necessity. As an institution, moviegoing had become in the thirties a permanent fact of life. For instance, the Gallup poll in January, 1938, showed that only 3 percent of the population attended the cinema less than once a month; 38 percent went to the movies at least once or twice a month, 47 percent attended every week or ten days,

British popular films 1929—1939

and 12 percent saw movies more than once a week.12 Surveys conducted by the film industry showed that in terms of popularity British films and British performers more than held their own against the pervasive American films; for instance, in 1934, three of the four most popular directors were British: Alexander Korda, Tom Walls, and Victor Saville.13 Similarly, film-goers in one fan magazine that conducted an admittedly unscientific but much publicized popularity contest for actors and actresses (in which as many as thirty thousand “votes” would be cast), usually listed just as many British as American performers in their “Top Ten.”14 But surveys and statistical evidence of this kind do not tell the full story. Much more impressive and emphatic as social documents were the comments made in the “Letters to the Editor” sections of such inexpensive fan magazines as Film Weekly, Picturegoer Weekly, and Film Pictorial, which were very popular among the working class; these forums for public opinion reveal in a dramatic way how audiences reacted to what they saw on the screen. Often the contributors would reveal their occupation, or lack of occupation, so that a researcher would have a perception of what the individual’s status was. These comments invariably were valuable in demonstrating whether British films were being ignored by the working classes. The experiences, then, of the working classes in England in regularly attending the movies during a decade of painful economic conditions takes on some importance. As a regular activity, film-going clearly must have satisfied various needs; the fact that people in such dire monetary straits that they often did not know how they would feed themselves, wanted to spend what little they had for this kind of amusement, suggests how powerful these needs apparently were. This study will attempt to explore the product of the British studios in the 1930s; in so doing it will endeavor to show what filmgoers, especially those from the working classes, found at the neighborhood cinema and why they wanted to attend. The question of the popularity of British movies also will be addressed. Efforts will be made to show in what ways the film industry and its products responded to the public, especially in a time of trouble. The specific content of British popular films will be examined, both statistically and on an individual film basis. Possible implicit messages and themes in these movies will be explored, and evidence will be offered to suggest how these ideas were shaped, how films portrayed the class structure, and in what ways societal values were reinforced by the British features of the Depression era.

2 MYTHS AND UNSUPPORTED ASSUMPTIONS A statistical overview of the content of British popular movies in the thirties THE NEGLECT OF THE BRITISH CINEMA OF THE 1930s Of the major developed film industries in the world since the sound era began, the British popular cinema of the 1930s is possibly the least known and least studied and is certainly, for its size, the least respected. Though the British film industry was, at the time, “the largest outside America,” its output has been continually castigated and ridiculed as being artistically inconsequential.1 For instance, film historian Arthur Knight, describing British features of the period as “muddled…cheap, [and] artless,” has observed in his survey of international film that “until the very end of the thirties,” the British production companies “remained notoriously devoid of either inspiration or vitality”; he speculated that as a consequence “disenchanted young men who might have contributed their vigor and talents to the entertainment film abandoned it in favor of the explored realms of documentary” and what was produced by the “harried commercial studios” was “little more than shabby imitations of Hollywood’s poorest offerings.”2 Another film historian dismissed “the basic content” of feature films in Britain, at least during the first eight or nine years of the talkie era “as trivial and without contemporary emphasis,” and spent less than four pages of a 709-page survey of motion picture history on the decade, in spite of the fact that the author was himself British.3 Gerald Mast devoted even less time to the topic, with no more than a few sentences out of 575 pages of his widely respected volume on what he called the “artless, craftless cheapies” produced in Britain between the wars.4 Even publications specifically surveying British film history have displayed a similar contempt for features from the thirties, with the lack of attention paid to the period sometimes almost ironic in its proportions. For instance, George Perry’s popular onevolume history of the British cinema had a cover design with the names of twenty-three great British film personalities, no fewer than sixteen of whom were either best known in the 1930s or achieved their fame or success during this decade; yet Perry covered the entire period with a scant 26 pages out of 367.5 A 1978 publication attempting to identify the so-called “great British films” of the sound era discussed merely twelve films from the thirties.6 Film scholarship in general has for the most part neglected the output of this period, and to a large extent, the content of British features from the thirties remains a mystery. Aside from a few well known titles and the names of a handful of personalities and directors working in British film who subsequently became internationally

prominent, even the specialist in cinema studies is hard-pressed to remember details about British motion pictures in this period.7 Several reasons can be cited for this neglect. Certainly the reputation of these films has contributed significantly to the lack of interest in them. For years, what little material was written about British features in the thirties merely echoed the general assumptions and comments that others had made. Film analysts had no real need to challenge the prevailing view because there appeared no diversity of opinion on the subject and because other periods in other countries which had aroused controversy and which had better reputations remained to be studied. Even if British features from the thirties were not being studied extensively, commentators continued to observe the detrimental aesthetic effect of the Quota Act and wrote contemptuously and with confidence about the “quota quickies,” as if all British productions were infected by these movies. Most writers agreed with Arthur Knight’s description of English studios being in a “quotaprotected rut,” producing films that were unimportant and unworthy of any critical attention.8 In part, this attitude was fostered in the early 1930s by the American film industry which feared the potential damage to its domestic and foreign markets should the British film industry develop to any great prominence.9 Not only might English language films from Great Britain have found audiences in the United States among independent theater owners, but also, and perhaps more importantly, they might have interfered severely with the distribution of American films to very important markets for Hollywood productions in the British Empire and Commonwealth, on which American studios had come to depend.10 Trade publications early in the sound era, when Hollywood was already in a distressed state about the changeover from silent film production, reflected this virtual paranoia. Articles in Variety, for example, characterized critical comments on American talkies in the British press as anti-American propaganda designed to “de-popularize” Hollywood productions.11 Attacks on the Quota Act and suggestions that the British Board of Film Censors were being particularly tough on American productions repeatedly appeared among the pages of trade periodicals in the United States.12 Accordingly, Hollywood made it difficult for British films to be shown in America, often buying films and then preventing their exhibition. Those rare British films that were exhibited in America usually received limited distribution at best. Even though one producer, Alexander Korda, did manage to arrange for distribution of his films through an American company, United Artists, this particular company had only a tiny share of the American market. In fact, United Artists, unlike the other major Hollywood producers, owned no theaters in America. Only the small, independent exhibitors who could not obtain or afford the major Hollywood features ran the output of the studios at Denham, Elstree, and Shepherd’s Bush, and the audiences who came to these small cinemas were limited to slumdwellers in the city and the farmers and townsmen in small, rural communities. As Griffith and Rotha have observed, even if this kind of an American audience could comprehend the West End accents “which was more than doubtful,” they certainly “could not understand the films”; with British productions “shown to the basic, primitive cinema audience—children and very simple people” who were only accustomed to genre like “the Western, the melodrama, and the slapstick comedy of Hollywood…[h]ow could the products of the Denham rosegarden be expected to

flourish?”13 Even with Korda’s arrangement with United Artists, one British periodical in the late 1930s reported that “less than thirty percent” of British productions were ever released in any fashion in America; the author reported that this limited distribution also helped account for the American belief that all British films tended to be “serious and ponderous” since comedies, which comprised the majority of British features, were almost never shown in the United States.14 In specific instances, high quality British productions were prevented from American distribution because of censorship problems; various reasons were given, but the usual suspicion was that Hollywood was simply fearful of any potentially popular British film and had exerted its influence with censorship boards as a form of revenge against American films that had been banned in England.15 Additionally, American film producers were quick to latch onto any criticism of a British production for whatever reason. Trade papers were filled with comments about the unintelligibility of British accents or the shoddiness of production values in contrast to those of American films. Performances were ridiculed, though the same performers were then welcomed into Hollywood productions. British producers also complained that American distributors in England encouraged the making of cheap, low quality, inferior features and forced them upon exhibitors to fulfill quota requirements in order to make the impression in the public that it was “impossible to make a good picture in England.”16 Naturally, then, with such a reputation to overcome, unqualified international successes among British films from the thirties were few. While budgets for American movies were ordinarily larger, and while productions may have been more lavish and accomplished, by comparison with British features, the intensity of the anti-British criticism encouraged by American film-makers undoubtedly has led to the mostly uniform reputation of the entire English motion picture output during the decade of the thirties. The more one views and studies British films from the 1930s, the more one realizes that these blanket condemnations, though historically understandable, are unfair, inappropriate, and inaccurate. The production values of a large portion of the several hundred films viewed for this study usually were comparable and sometimes virtually indistinguishable from those of contemporary Hollywood features. Certainly budgets were low for the “quota quickies,” but these films, often produced for distribution in England only by the British subsidiaries of Hollywood companies, consisted of only a fraction of all British films made during the period; and some of these films triumphed over their budgets.17 More importantly, the “quota” films often provided a necessary training ground for performers and film-makers who were later to become very successful and to earn international reputations in movies; actors, like James Mason; actresses, like Margaret Lockwood; and directors, like Michael Powell and Adrian Brunei started in the so-called “quota quickies.”18 Another reason why British commercial motion pictures from the thirties have been neglected is a simple logistical problem: they are not widely available for viewing or analysis. Like virtually all motion pictures made in the thirties, the British features were filmed on nitrate stock which decomposes after a period of time. Preservation of films accordingly has been a major concern for film archives throughout the world. But with limited budgets and with the high cost of transferring films to safety stock, priorities have had to be established; the low regard in which British films of the thirties have been held

12

has caused them to be somewhat under-represented in film collections, as other more prominent features had to be saved.19 The apparent loss of much of the output of the Warner Brothers’ Teddington studio some years ago is particularly regrettable. Since most of the British film companies of the 1930s no longer exist, the studio archives are not reliable sources. Some—but not by any means all—British features were sold to television and are occasionally revived on British or even American television. Revivals of British films at the National Film Theatre of the British Film Institute in London and at other second-run theaters are infrequent, but they invariably are received enthusiastically by the public. For Americans, though, the problem of finding and screening such films is more pronounced. As recently as the early 1980s, of the more than 1700 British productions running thirty minutes or longer made between 1929 and 1939, only approximately 165 titles were listed in the United States as being available for rental or for sale from distributors (many of whom have relatively tiny, irregular, somewhat undependable operations).20 Counting titles available for television exhibition in North America a total of 146 additional movies could be added to the list: this total excludes the 135 features which are not listed as available both on television and for rental and sale, and a large proportion of these are ordinarily inaccessible for private screenings.21 Thus, even if scholars had been more interested, research on the British popular film of the 1930s would have proved difficult to conduct; accordingly, other, more popular subjects have received far greater attention, and British films prior to the Second World War have remained in relative obscurity. The situation has improved slightly in the last decade with the video revolution; a number of companies specializing in obscure, out-of-copyright films have increased the options to view these productions since a good many British films from this decade have not had their copyrights renewed. However, often the prints transferred to video are poor, with incomplete and grainy transfers from second generation dupes; it is rare to obtain a video from a complete print of high quality. Making evaluations from such poor examples is risky. But it is true that the availability question has improved a bit over the years. In the process of preparing this study, over two hundred of these features have been located for viewing over a fifteen-year period. Spending time in London on different occasions during special National Film Theatre career retrospectives of the films of Gracie Fields, Jessie Matthews, George Formby, and Will Hay proved to be a matter of lucky timing for an American otherwise unable to take advantage of all of the tempting offerings from the British Film Institute collection listed in the monthly NFT booklets he received here in the States; although any visit to London usually resulted in being able to see one or two rarities from this period, the possibility of examining an entire collection of films during one of these NFT tributes was especially helpful. Outside the United Kingdom, all endeavors to locate these motion pictures have proved to be far more problematic. Television programmers unfamiliar with movies from this period occasionally schedule British films that feature recognizable American performers who travelled to England to make a film or two; likewise, productions from this era that starred British actors and actresses who were later to emigrate to Hollywood also sometimes are shown on American television. By carefully scrutinizing television listings, the diligent enthusiast of films from this decade sometimes can catch such

features in the United States, especially on cable or on independent broadcast channels. Occasionally, if one is alert to the schedules of specialized film societies, one also might find these films revived at archival screenings. Still, the goal of tracking down as many as possible of these hard-to-locate productions in the United States more often than not requires extraordinary effort, and frequently the endeavor assumes almost comical proportions. Patient and understanding friends in other cities have become accustomed to frantic, long distance phone calls from the author of this study alerting them to late night television showings, noticed in newspaper listings, of otherwise forgotten British films and beseeching them to set their videotape machines to record the items for research purposes. Whenever special showings of British films are announced in places like New York or Chicago, efforts must be made to try to attend as many of the screenings as possible. Especially memorable in this regard was one twelve hour, overnight marathon in a freezing Chicago auditorium, during which beautiful 35mm prints of seven 1930s British musicals (on loan from the British Film Institute) were projected at the Chicago International Film Festival in the mid 1980s; one’s enjoyment of the delightful films inevitably was tempered by the sheer physical difficulty of trying to keep fingers warm enough to continue writing detailed notes about productions one was not likely to be able to see again. Fortunately, in the last few years, with the growth of mail order video companies specializing in out-of-copyright productions, a number of features from this period previously seldom seen in the United States have been made available for home viewing. While the quality of prints being used for the videos varies drastically, and while the ordering of the films proves quite expensive, nonetheless, dozens of titles that have never been available before can now be examined in detail for the first time. Still, for someone interested in this period, it remains very frustrating to consider the sizable number of these movies that continue to be elusive and unavailable for viewing. To obtain a more thorough overview of British films, then, other sources of information must be examined to permit some analysis of a wider cross section of the British cinematic output. Screenplays at the British Film Institute Library have been helpful in this regard, as are reviews and criticism from contemporary newspapers and film commentators. But especially useful are plot synopses and feature articles in contemporary fan magazines and industry publications; for the most part, these accounts have been neglected or at least under used in research on this period. These written accounts of the movies that appeared at the time of the release of the films often include revealing production details and provide remarkably detailed and informative background information. Comparisons of plot evaluations from the magazines with the films themselves suggest that the accounts in these fan periodicals and trade publications were generally quite accurate and reliable. While first hand examination of the films themselves would always be preferable, given the lack of availability of British films of this era, and the likelihood that a significant number of these features are now lost, this material at least provides help in reconstructing the cinematic output of the period. Another reason why British features in the 1930s have remained less well known involves Britain’s greatest contribution to the development of world cinema. As Walter Alien has observed when one contemplates the role British film has played in the general history of cinema, it is, indeed, to the British motion picture of the thirties that one’s

thoughts turn. But it is not the popular features that are considered significant; rather “one’s mind turns… to the superb documentaries that John Grierson fathered and Sir Stephen Tallents fostered, first at the Empire Marketing Board and then at the Post Office.”22 To say that these films critically have overshadowed the popular British cinema of the decade would be a vast understatement. Film historians generally concede that it was the British under Grierson that gave the impetus to the documentary movement, and many, like Arthur Knight, feel that the documentary movement, more than any other factor, shaped the most memorable period of British commercial cinema, the years immediately following the Second World War.23 Thus, the lack of attention to the British popular film industry is fairly easy to understand, given its reputation, its traditional rivalry with Hollywood, the unavailability of its output, and the contrast with the truly significant documentary movement taking place at the same time.

THE PEOPLE’S CINEMA That the British cinema during this period generally has been dismissed as meaningless, stuffy, and stage bound, regarded in the words of one writer as a “middle-class institution,” with its origins in the kind of “drawing-room” drama seen from “a stall seat in Shaftsbury Avenue” presents a remarkable irony.24 The fact is that, for a “middle-class institution,” the British film was remarkably popular among the working classes. Certainly movie-going had become a national pastime, with almost nineteen million people attending their cinemas weekly.25 As historian C.L.Mowat has observed, “to the large majority [of the] unemployed…the main problem was to keep warm, and to conserve low energy”; cinema-going fulfilled these goals and at the same time enabled audience members to obtain a “passing distraction” from the “boredom” of their day-today existence. Indeed, Mowat goes on to cite statistics showing that in Cardiff, for instance, 52 percent of the unemployed young people interviewed visited the movie theaters once a week, and “almost half of these twice a week”; similarly in the cities of Liverpool and Glasgow, as many as 80 percent of those polled attended at least once weekly.26 George Orwell, who spent months studying and living with the working classes during the worst years of the Depression, was also aware of the importance of movies for these people. In his moving study of the Depression era working classes, Orwell remarked that in a decade “of unparalleled depression,” the “consumption of all cheap luxuries” had risen, and the two examples that had “probably made the greatest difference of all” were “the movies and the mass-production of cheap smart clothes”; an individual might have only a half-penny in his pocket, “not a prospect in the world, and only the corner of a leaky bedroom to go home to,” but in his “new clothes” he could “stand on the street corner, indulging in a private daydream” of himself as Clark Gable, and such a fantasy “compensates…for a great deal.”27 Orwell went on to comment that this “development of cheap luxuries [such as]…the movies” had proven in the midst of a potentially explosive economic crisis to be “a very fortunate thing for our rulers,”, because it was “quite likely that…[such pleasure had] averted revolution.”28 Whether Orwell’s contention was correct or not, the working classes themselves

provided ample testimony of their devotion to the movies and to the escape the cinema provided. The importance the working classes attached to the films they saw and to their regular visits to the movie-houses can be seen in some of the contemporary British fan magazines they purchased so avidly. Such publications as Film Weekly, Picturegoer Weekly, and Film Pictorial provided detailed information for the cinemagoer on all aspects of the film experience each week for the minimal cost of around threepence. Although exact circulation figures on these publications are difficult to obtain, the profusion of fan magazines and the variety from which to choose at the newsstand suggests their great success in the public marketplace; when other popular enterprises were failing in 1931, the monthly Picturegoer was so successful that it changed to a weekly. In the letters sent to these periodicals, movie fans related their love for films and told what the cinema meant to them in an increasingly chaotic, frustrating, and troubled world. One shopgirl from Leeds went so far as to outline her entire weekly budget and included movies with such other necessities as food and shelter. I wonder whether people realize how very strong is…[the] effect [of movies] on the lives of hundreds of girls in similar positions to myself. Here is my weekly budget: Wages 32s—Board and lodging 25s—Saturday visit to cinema 1s— Monday visit 7d—Thursday visit 7d—That makes 27s 2d. Then there is threepence for Film Weekly and 3 shillings for dress allowance. That means I have 1s 7d left. People consider me smartly dressed, but that is undoubtedly because I copy the clothes I have seen in films. Powders, soap and odds and ends are those used by my favorite film stars. When I get a rise in salary, I shall be able to afford another night at the pictures.29 Another letter-writer who identified himself as a member of the working classes concurred that the movies were vital for survival. Plain men and women are turning with almost a sign of thankfulness to the cinema, which has become now a stark necessity, taking their minds off the continual struggle for existence during these days of stress and strain. Looking forward to an enjoying two or three hours at the “pictures” definitely lightens the load and tends to free the mind of petty worries so easily magnified. It is the pause enabling us to get our “second wind,” so to speak before “tackling the morrow’s problems” …For it is entertainment which takes our minds out of the rut, so apt to end in a slough.30 Still another letter-writer commented that he could not “imagine what the world would be like…without cinemas,” and acknowledged that the very “thought” of it sent “a feeling of panic…through my mind.”31 Whether such hyperbole was shared by all members of the working classes is not certain, but many letter-writers observed that, if anything, the movies had even greater meaning for the countless unemployed. A letter-writer in August, 1935, pointed out his sympathy for “the vast numbers of unemployed in my district whose only entertainment consists of going in the evening, once or twice a week to one of the local cinemas.”32

Another letter attacked those who criticized the proliferation of movie entertainments, observing that those who were against the spread of motion pictures were precisely “those who can afford to pay well for their relaxation, boxes at the opera, seats for the best concerts, etc.”; the writer added, I wonder if they have ever given a thought to what the “pictures” mean to the working people and especially to the very poor? Their lives are a constant grind to make ends meet, with the fear of unemployment hanging over them all the time. Not for them theatres or concerts; their Mecca is the “pictures”…here for a few pence tired men and harassed women can leave their cares behind and for a few hours live a life that otherwise would never be theirs. Music and singing, love and laughter, all are there…. [O]ur best singers—all the famous bands, the pick of the world’s actors, all are there to do service for them, and no singer or actor has a finer critic or a firmer friend than the workingman or woman…. After the show they go home rested and refreshed, better for the brief hours’ respite from their ordinary life; and the rest of the week will be brightened by snatches of a song, a lilting melody, or a chuckle at a remembered wisecrack by one of the comedians.33 The letter concluded with the author relating what working-class people had told her of their regard for the movies. Women have told me frankly that they would rather go without their dinner than their visit to the pictures. “What folly!” I can hear the highbrows say…but have they ever known what it is to go on, week in, week out, planning, contriving, working, to keep a home and family on totally inadequate means, without a break, without hope of anything better? One woman told me in deadly earnest: “Ma’am, if it wasn’t for a visit to the pictures I should go as mad as a hatter,” and I believe her. I have seen, and I know…. More power to the singers, actors, and actresses, for they are doing a wonderful work…. [T]hey brighten the lives of poor people.34 One unemployed man from Gateshead-on-Tyne wrote to Film Pictorial in late 1932 to explain the therapeutic effect films had for him psychologically; signing himself “Cheery,” he noted, I am a “dockyard matey,” out of work on the dole. But I manage to save an occasional ninepence for the cinema and am never happier than when I see a film with gorgeous scenes of song, dance, and merriment. Why does it make me happy? Because it fills a gap in my life. I do not hanker after luxury or wealth; these I know I can never gain; but such films take me out of myself, out of gloomy Tyneside, and provide the escape from reality without which I should grow dull and despairing.35 Another letter-writer went so far as to personify the movies as the perfect companion.

In this modern age, we have an ideal friend—the cinema; a friend who is ever willing to stretch forth welcoming arms to all, to give entertainment to suit every taste…. Is there anyone who can relieve the monotony of drab existence so successfully and renew lost courage? The cinema—our ideal friend—is being clamored for by every civilized human being as a means of relaxation from a monotonous life; some to forget their sorrows and some to study humanity. No other place could afford such a complete survey of mankind as cinema, our ideal friend.36 The same sentiment was expressed in a remarkably similar eulogy from an anonymous letter-writer in the pages of a different publication, the Picturegoer Weekly in 1931. With the heading “to the Movies,” the note began: You are my best friend. You give me everything, though you ask of me nothing. You never fail to cheer and though you sometimes make me weep, you always comfort me. You make me laugh and forget all cares. I am a globe-trotter, though I never leave my native town. I am well informed, I am an authority on drama, current events, fashions, etiquette, and music. I believe in God, miracles, love, and just folk. I know there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, for I have been there. I seldom leave my neighborhood, but you will find me in every city, town, village, and hamlet in the world. And so because of you, I am a very remarkable fellow. My age? I am all ages. My name? It is legion. I am a moviefan.37 Of course, not all films shown in British cinemas were made in Britain, and it is customary to assume that American films were favored consistently by audiences. But contemporary sources demonstrate a far less certain preference. An item in Film Weekly in early 1933 noted that contemporary filmgoers knew “that they…[could] depend on a good-quality British film” and that they were “glad to pay good money to see it”; the commentary added that this was proven “by the recent admission of an American film distributor that a British film can make three to four times as much money in this country as a Hollywood picture of equal quality.”38 In fact, to a notable degree, letter-writers often stated an open dislike of American films in comparison to features produced in Great Britain. A woman from Birmingham complained in one letter that too many Hollywood features were being shown, saying “it is only my sense of humor that keeps me suffering in my seat through those eternal ‘backstage,’ racketeering, collegiate American films without having to be taken away, foaming at the mouth”; though she claimed that her tastes were not “aggressively British and proud of it,” nevertheless she found English films: clean wholesome and above all REAL. They take me into a familiar atmosphere, among places and people I know even if they are sordid and prosy…. These American “cuties” and “gunmen” mean little or nothing to us; their far-fetched, impossible doings leave us cold; I would rather see one Rookery Nook than twenty American “stupendous epics” …. Elstree, your pictures are good enough for me.39

While certainly not all filmgoers shared this view, the popularity of British films was undeniable and has been overlooked to a significant extent. Even the much maligned “quota quickies” had their devotees. One “letter to the editor” of Film Pictorial in that section of the magazine which was known significantly as “the Screen Parliament” observed that quota pictures were far more enjoyable and meaningful than American short films. These little productions, some of them only forty or fifty minutes long, may well take the place of the miserable drivel from America purporting to be comedy which we have had to endure far too long. Surely the average English audience would prefer the robust but wholesome humour of… [British quota films]…to the nonsensical antics of most American two-reeler comedians.40 Perry’s contention that the British cinema was unresponsive to the working classes would seem to be difficult to understand or justify, then, given the popularity of these movies among the poor and unemployed. If British films during the Depression years appealed to largely working-class audiences, the question of what the content consisted becomes important. A variety of studies on Hollywood films of the thirties already have attempted to relate American movies to social concerns in the United States during the Depression.41 But such content analysis has not hitherto been endeavored with regard to British films. How, then, could such an effort be undertaken?

AN OVERVIEW OF CONTENT An overview of the content of the British cinema was greatly facilitated with the publication in the mid 1970s of the massive volume compiled by Denis Gifford which catalogued all entertainment films made in Britain from 1895 to 1970. Gifford’s work took sixteen years to compile, and it listed cast, credits, and plot synopses of well over fourteen thousand films; it quickly became the most reliable source of information of its kind. Reviewers subsequently praised it as being “dependable and monumental,” and film historian Roy Armes referred to it as being “indispensable.”42 Gifford described twenty-three basic categories or “subjects” into which he

grouped all British films from 1895 to 1970. Of the twenty-three subdivisions he used, sixteen classifications were applied to the just-over seventeen hundred British productions running thirty minutes or longer produced in the thirties.43 Of necessity, these categories are relatively terse and sketchy, and Gifford himself indicated in his introduction the problems and limitations of these single-word categorizations; but despite the difficulty of generalizing from these groupings, at least all of his evaluations were based on published descriptions and have the unprecedented virtue of being consistently applied to the total output of presumably every British studio. Therefore, using Gifford’s data, a general, comprehensive though admittedly limited overview of the content of British films in this decade could be ascertained for the first time. Unfortunately, no such statistical information accompanied Gifford’s published listing. So a first step toward understanding just what comprised the content of British cinema during this period might be obtained by a close survey of Gifford’s material. The rough statistical overview represented in Table 2.1 which was obtained by carefully counting all of the various films over thirty minutes in length and using Gifford’s classifications revealed some very interesting patterns.44 The steady increase in comedy films through 1933, and the subsequently high numbers of comedy productions throughout the remainder of the decade in relation to other categories suggest the popularity of “escapist” film fare.45

After the tumultuous transition year of 1929, when British studios were converting to sound and therefore were in flux, comedy films comprised roughly between 30 and 35 percent of the total number of features released each year by British production companies. In 1933, at the low point of the slump, close to one-half of all films made in Britain were “comedies.” Only near the end of the decade, in 1937 and 1939, when the worst of the economic crisis had passed, did the figure ever slip below 30 percent, and the difference in these two years from the 30 percent figure is negligible. The equivalent numbers for musicals, usually considered equally escapist, are also revealing, though perhaps not as telling as those for comedies.

about 22 percent of all releases. Though 1931 would seem to be aberrant, it should be remembered that 1931 is generally considered to be a year in which the musical film genre was being re-evaluated in the film industry both in Britain and in other countries.46 The figures become somewhat more impressive when revues, which were typically musically orientated, are incorporated. Although Gifford differentiates between revues and musicals, revues would include almost invariably a large proportion of songs, singalongs, and musical numbers. In many cases, the revues would be assemblages of the most prominent and well-known music hall acts. When these two categories are lumped together, the proportion of “musical-type” films is shown to be somewhat more significant, particularly in the latter years of the decade. In five of the eleven years, totals of around 20 percent or higher of the output of British studios were musically orientated. In 1936, perhaps significantly, also the year in which the most comedies were released, almost sixty musicals and revues were produced in Britain, a figure that represents more than one of every four films released that year. The increasing number of revues that appeared is, in itself, a noteworthy phenomenon. With the beginning of the gradual decline of the music halls, it was perhaps inevitable that the cinema, traditionally regarded as heir to the

halls in that it was the primary source of entertainment for the working classes, would adopt some of their performers. The introduction of sound was a necessary prerequisite to this development, but once sound was pervasive in British cinema, revues featuring music hall acts gradually became more common and more popular. By booking such films, cinema managers also presumably could reduce the costs of hiring live acts, to which audiences in some of the bigger cinemas had become accustomed as part of the

22

programs. With the same kinds of acts that previously had performed live now available on the screen, these movies could provide entertainment more efficiently and more inexpensively than live performances. The films kept some of these entertainers employed and active, and also served as a means by which these performers could work their way into the motion picture industry; for example, before the long running “Old Mother Riley” series about a comic washerwoman began, its protagonists, the team of Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane, who had created the characters in a successful music hall act, had made an appearance in a revue. Thus, the emergence of revue films is a significant development in itself, though the percentages may seem negligible. These three categories represented a large proportion of all British releases in the thirties. When musicals, revues, and comedy films are totalled together, they are shown to be the majority of British releases almost every year of the decade; in 1936, three of every five features were in one of these three categories. These three categories make clear the highly “escapist” nature of British cinema during this decade. The largest of the remaining categories is the crime film which seems to have been exceedingly common among British productions.

During most years of the decade, between two and three of every ten British films were crime features. But here the figures may be slightly deceptive in that this particular category covers perhaps the widest range of possibilities. Because of the all-inclusive nature of the way in which this category is defined, it is somewhat ambiguous. No differentiation is made, for example, between detective movies, gangster and street-crime thrillers, caper features about gentleman jewel thiefs, and mad-killer films, cops-androbber epics, or simply old-fashioned, drawing-room murder mysteries. In other words as a genre, the crime film can take on many different forms; as Carlos Clarens observes in his study of the genre, “the crime film is…difficult to isolate, lacking as it does the readable iconography of the Western and the clarity of intent of the horror films.”47 Thus, the number of “crime films” may have

been swollen unduly by the loose definition of the category, and it might be wrong to presume any sociologically abnormal fascination with crime among the film-going public. One small surprise in these figures is the relatively insignificant proportion of “history” films, since this genre is one of the few areas in which British commercial cinema of the thirties was able to develop any lasting international reputation. The success of Alexander Korda’s Private Life of Henry VIII seems to have inspired a brief, though surprisingly small, trend toward history films. These movies had greater success abroad, perhaps because so many of them were made by Korda whose distribution agreement insured access to American markets; accordingly, the films became better known and have retained a lasting prestige.

Straight dramatic films seem to have remained fairly constant in proportion to other British releases, but the percentages are still low throughout the thirties. In most years dramatic films represented only between 8 and 10 percent of the output of British studios. One would expect to find most films dealing with any social messages in this category; thus, the small percentages are again suggestive of a highly escapist cinema industry. But other kinds of dramatic films are listed under other categories. For example, each year at least a few released are characterized as war films. The number of war films during the decade rose, particularly in the later years, just before the Second World War, although a mini-trend in 1930 had resulted in several features with anti-war messages.

By contrast, romances seem to have declined in popularity. In the early thirties, romance films were a substantial fraction of each year’s production totals. But by the late years of the decade, the number of romances had declined to less than 5 percent a year. Adventure movies do not seem to have been as widely produced as might have been expected; but again, the vague notion of what constitutes an “adventure” film may make these figures less meaningful than they might otherwise have been. As a rule, though, adventure films rarely accounted for as much as 5 percent of a year’s releases. One category that is deceptively insignificant is that which Gifford calls sport films. Although the listings are proportionally very small, in fact, when one examines the short synopses Gifford includes, one discovers that a large number of films in other categories (such as comedy, crime, musicals, and

with aspects of sports such as gambling. If such films were included, this category would have been substantially larger. The other categories were not highly represented each year, although a brief flurry of fantasy and horror films in the mid thirties can be detected. Table 2.14 lists the percentages for all films and categories by year. Of course, British studios released in addition to these features and featurettes, hundreds of short entertainment films. An analysis of these extremely rare films cannot be undertaken in this study, though Gifford’s data again provide a rough overview of what these movies consisted. [See Table 2.15.] Several of the categories were unique to short films.48 As in the case of the features, musicals and comedies made up the majority of the releases. The remarkable total of 130 musical shorts in 1929 represents early sound experimentation, but even in subsequent years, when sound films were firmly established, the totals remained comparatively high for this category. Escapism, then, can be seen prominently in the short films produced, as well as in the features.49 These figures are revealing, yet their utility in assessing the cinematic tastes of the British working classes in the thirties is limited at best. The categorization of these films does provide at least a rough grouping of the product of British film studios and demonstrates in what proportions the various types of features were being produced; but beyond that, few specific assumptions can be made without more information. After all, the decision to make a movie can be determined by a variety of factors such as cost effectiveness; public acceptability is not always the most important concern for producers. In Britain, with the quota system such an important consideration in the thirties, several studios specialized in making the low-budget “quickies” that were used to balance American releases and fulfill legal obligations.

their often poor production values and the noticeable haste with which they were concocted, these features were not usually popular with the public, and yet they figure just as prominently in totals of films produced. In addition, some films are routinely more expensive to make than others, and the lower return on the investment may encourage a producer to select a cheaper, less risky property and thereby to ignore other types of films. War, fantasy, adventure, horror, and historical/costume films are usually more expensive, so this fact may account for the relative insignificance of these categories. The inability, then, to differentiate between successful features and films rejected by the public and the difficulty in assessing the motivations of producers makes the raw numbers and percentages imperfect as barometers of public taste and acceptance. Without accurate box office data on specific films, more definitive judgments would be speculative; however, such information is rarely available and is always difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. However, public acceptance can be measured or inferred in a variety of other ways. The reissue of a film usually signifies its acceptance by the public, since ordinarily, only films that are successful or appreciated are ever reissued (although it is undeniable that some films may have been re-released because of a shortage of movies available for circulation). Nonetheless, if the first run of a film was not successful or if a producer did not have reason to expect that a reissue would be profitable, a movie would not be circulated a second time. Gifford supplies information about reissues. By totalling the numbers of

British films from this period identified by Gifford as being subsequently reissued, the movies with the presumably greater public acceptance can be discerned, and any correspondence to the raw totals and percentages previously examined can be highlighted. Table 2.16 shows these reissues by year and by category; it should be noted that many of these films were reissued more than once and that most of the reissues listed for 1929 were silent films that were re-released in 1930 with complete or partial soundtracks added. Perhaps the first and most notable revelation of this table is that so many British films from the period were reissued. If one accepts re-releases as a fair judgment of approval, then, these percentages provide further evidence to

dispel the notion that British films of the decade were either unpopular or ignored. Over two in every five films were being re-released by the end of the thirties in contrast to one in ten in the early thirties and one in four or five midway through the decade. Among the reissued films, comedies and musicals again predominate, and, if anything, the statistics demonstrating this preponderance are even more dramatic, particularly in the early years of the decade. In all but the years 1936–1938, the percentages in Table 2.18 are higher than those in Table 2.6. Table 2.19 shows the percentages of all reissued films per year. A few minor differences from Table 2.14 can be observed. War films, adventures, and histories seem slightly higher proportionally among the reissued films which may be a result of heightened interest in these films during the war years later; crime films and dramas, however, involve about the same or slightly lower percentages. But, in general, the proportions of the rereleased films seem to reflect fairly accurately the patterns established by the categories of all releases. From this data, laughter and songs would seem to have been the main characteristics of not only most British films but also presumably those films which British audiences wanted to see again. While the information derived from this implicit assumption of popularity has been instructive, for the purpose of this study, several major questions remain untouched by all of this analysis. Though Gifford’s broad categorizations are useful, the content of British popular cinema remains largely a mystery even after such a close inspection of what can be gathered from his data. Though the categories of films that were produced by the studios and their proportionate significance has been presented, the nature of neither characters nor plots has been considered. Without further investigation, Perry’s assertion

that British cinema was, by nature, “middle class,” thus remains unchallenged, though the devotion of the working-class patrons to their movies is suggestive. For this reason, a more detailed examination of these features is necessary before an attempt can be made to assess their general appeal or their specific appeal to the working classes.

3 DEPICTING THE WORKING CLASSES IN BRITISH FILM IN THE THIRTIES Escapist versus realistic portrayals If the British public, and especially the working classes, were so fond of the cinema, what accounts for this popularity? One possible explanation may have something to do with the fact that in these productions, the working classes could see themselves being portrayed even if that depiction was not particularly true to life. Certainly, the undeniable appeal of the British film for the working-class audiences that frequented the cinema in part may have been conditioned by the prevalence of working-class characters, environments, and situations in the movies being produced. In spite of the generally held belief that British films avoided the working classes, a close examination of the content of British features during the decade shows that working-class characters and situations appeared with considerable regularity in British movies. Working-class characters were mentioned in many of the plot synopses, listings of credits, and reviews, as indicated in Table 3.1.

In five of the eleven years, the working classes figured significantly enough to be mentioned in more than two of every five films produced in Britain, and in 1935 and 1936, they were prominent in almost one of every two films made; in every other year of the decade, except somewhat surprisingly the last year prior to the war, working-class characters figured in more than one of every three features that were released. The evidence is similar for those films in which working-class characters were actually the protagonists or central figures in the plot. As indicated in Table 3.2, the percentages, which could hardly be described as negligible, in most years, hover rather consistently between 35 and 45 percent. In addition and far more frequently, a recognizable working-class character could be found in the cast at least in a minor or supporting role. As Table 3.3 reveals, in five of the eleven years, a working-class character was

somehow involved in more than half of the films produced by British studios, and in all but one of the remaining years, at least nine of every twenty features had working-class characters in at least some minor part. Additionally, a fairly significant minority of the films produced every year were set in a working-class environment of some kind, such as in mines, in factories, in shipyards, in neighborhood pubs, or in slums. Table 3.4 demonstrates that usually one out of every three films had a working-class setting and that in 1934 and in 1935, the proportion was approximately two of every five English films.

But again, these raw figures are far more interesting than significant. The mere presence of a working-class character does not mean that he or she is an appealing figure; nor does it provide any sense of how the audience reacted to that presence or of how the character was portrayed. In fact, considerable evidence suggests that at least among some audience members, the portrayals of the working classes were regarded as inaccurate and shallow. Writing in a 1938 is
