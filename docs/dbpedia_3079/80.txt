Introduction

is a received and well-established view of British cinema in the 1930s. It consists of the expensively mounted productions of T Alexander Korda's London Films aimed at the international market; the HERE

'cheap and cheerful' regional comedies featuring music-hall stars such as Gracie Fields and George Formby and intended mainly for the domestic market; the polished thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock; and the British documentary movement, led by John Grierson and claiming to present the only authentic picture of contemporary life in Britain. All of these aspects of 1930s cinema have received extended and excellent coverage from film scholars and historians. But there was far more to 1930s British cinema than these admittedly important areas. It was one of the most prolific periods of British filmmaking, a boom era stimulated by the Cinematograph Films Act of 1927 which required a quota of the films shown on British screens to be genuinely British. Many of the films produced in that period and many of the personnel involved – producers, directors and stars – have never been properly examined, leaving the map of British cinema in the 1930s studded with areas of darkness and ignorance. This collection of 11 essays by leading British film historians aims to dispel some of that darkness and chart a new map of British cinema in this key decade. John Sedgwick's essay seeks for the first time to establish scientifically which British films British audiences went to see, what their favourite British films were and who were their favourite British stars. He argues convincingly that there was a viable British film industry in the 1930s and that Gaumont-British, under Michael Balcon, and British and Dominions, under Herbert Wilcox, produced a stream of hit films. He also comes up with conclusions about the top box-office stars that challenges the received wisdom. The careers of Alexander Korda, Michael Balcon and Herbert Wilcox have been charted in a succession of biographies and autobiographies. Linda Wood, though, looks at the career of one of the lesser-known film

tycoons, giving the first in-depth analysis of the regime of Julius Hagen at Twickenham Film Studios. She explores how he tried to transform his operation from producing 'quota quickies' for American companies to a regime of British quality films, falling foul of the perennial problems confronting the British film industry: under-financing, ruthless US competition and the relatively restricted nature of the British market. H. Mark Glancy, utilising MGM's own records, gives a fresh assessment of how one of the Hollywood majors sought to fulfil its quota obligations under both the 1927 and 1938 Acts and how its strategy evolved to the point at which it was committed to a full programme of quality film-making in Britain. Two of the most popular genres with 1930s' cinema-goers were musicals and crime thrillers. Stephen Guy and James Chapman examine how British cinema sought to fulfil this demand, creating distinctive bodies of work that drew on both specifically British traditions as well as on Hollywood models. One of the most critically neglected genres is that of society melodrama and Tony Aldgate breaks new ground in his reassessment of the role of society melodrama, particularly the work of actor-director Miles Mander, in providing searching discussions of sex, class, morals and the role of women in the interwar period. Sue Harper and Jeffrey Richards take us beyond the world of Fields and Formby to examine the careers and to assess the appeal of two currently less fashionable but then popular stars, Conrad Veidt and Tod Slaughter, who represent two important areas of input into British cinema: the influx of continental émigrés and the continuing influence of the Victorian stage. The talents of a number of British directors of the 1930s have been highlighted in recent years. Apart from Hitchcock, the work of Victor Saville, John Baxter and Walter Forde has received sympathetic critical consideration. In this collection, Brian McFarlane makes out the case for the versatile 'jack of all trades' Robert Stevenson. Geoff Brown canvasses the virtues of Bernard Vorhaus, and Kevin Gough-Yates rediscovers Berthold Viertel, two of many talented émigrés who enriched British cinema in this decade. Three themes emerge from this collection which will add a new dimension to the consideration of 1930s British cinema. One is the revaluation of the much mocked 'quota quickies'. The essays of Glancy, Brown, Richards and Wood detect work of real quality in this area, which served as a training ground for new talents and functioned in many ways as the equivalent of the regime of the Hollywood 'B' picture which is recognised as having produced some memorable films.

is the revaluation of melodrama as a legitimate and powerful mode of cinematic expression. It can function as a means of articulating subversive excess or exploring social problems, of highlighting issues of class and gender. It should be seen as a continuing and significant strand in the British film culture. The third structuring theme is the contextualisation of British films in the wider cultural scene, the exploring of its potent links with popular fiction, the music industry and the stage. Together these essays and the issues and themes they raise lead us to a fuller and richer consideration of 1930s British cinema. Jeffrey Richards

Cinema-going Preferences in Britain in the 1930s John Sedgwick

HE 1938 Cinematograph Films Act signalled the end of a decade T of achievement for the British film industry. The legislation made it easier for American renters to meet their quota obligations, by reducing the number of domestic productions they were required to handle in order to balance the volume of Hollywood films imported into Britain. The subsequent reduction in production in 1938–39 came on the tail of a crisis in production during 1936–37 caused by a combination of speculative financing and substantial corporate losses. Domestic film output fell from a high of 228 films registered in 1937/38 to 103 and 108 in the following two years.1 Ian Jarvie has portrayed these events as representing a victory for American strategy in a trade war which was not fully understood either by domestic players or the British government.2 The corporate configuration which had emerged during the decade following the 1927 Cinematograph Films Act was left in tatters, its assets being steadily acquired by flour-milling millionaire J. Arthur Rank. The outcome contrasts markedly with the atmosphere in the industry during the years leading up to 1936. The 1927 Cinematograph Films Act had given a measure of protection to British film-makers by imposing a sliding scale quota – rising to 20 per cent by 1936 – on domestic renters and exhibitors. At a stroke the risks associated with film production had been changed in favour of domestic producers. The moribund industry of the 1920s was transformed. Not only did the volume of domestic feature film production increase annually as a consequence – rising from 13 films shown in 1927 to 125 films registered with the Board of Trade in 1930–31 and then steadily to a peak of 228 films registered in 1937–38 – but much of it was demonstrably popular with domestic

audiences. However, this up-beat assessment does not conform to the orthodox depiction of film-making in Britain during the 1930s, well expressed in Rachael Low's comment: 'The 1927 quota legislation intended to solve all the industry's problems was a failure. Film production doubled during the thirties, but the increase consisted almost entirely of cheap and inferior films, the famous quota quickies and others not much better, which took advantage of the protected market and went far to ruin the reputation of British production as a whole.'3 The implication of Low's statement is clear; the 1927 legislation made little if any difference to the qualitative output of British studios and served merely to increase the quantity of domestic film.4 While paying tribute to Low's monumental seven-volume history of the domestic industry from its inception until the outbreak of the Second World War, this work challenges Low's hypothesis. To do so, given the general absence of corporate accounting records of feature film performance, it has been necessary to establish an index of film popularity (POPSTAT) based upon a sample of contemporary cinema exhibition records.5 The results demonstrate that the orthodoxy outlined above, particularly when viewed in the context of a substantial growth in industry-specific human and fixed capital formation, is in need of substantial revision. The popularity of film in Britain during the 1930s Although cinema was the dominant paid leisure activity in Britain during the 1930s, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all entertainment admissions and expenditure,6 it did not feature very prominently in household budgets, absorbing only 1 per cent of consumers' expenditure in real terms during the period. As far as the national economy was concerned the film industry was small. Annual per capita cinema attendance grew from 19 to 20 visits, resulting in a per capita expenditure of 16–17 shillings between 1934 and 1938, equivalent to a little more than 4 (old) pence per week. The slow upward drift in annual attendances from 903 million in 1934 to 987 million in 1938 appears to have kept pace with the growth in population but, if anything, the proportion of real personal expenditure devoted to cinema-going fell, albeit marginally, while real incomes and expenditure rose.7 For the greater part, audiences did not conceive of cinema as a luxury. Indeed, in keeping with George Orwell's observations concerning the cinema-going habits of unemployed men in Wigan, cinema may well have been consumed as a necessity among the poorest members of the community.8

The pattern of film distribution The system of film distribution in Britain was similar to that of the USA9 and can be explained in terms of price discriminatory practices, whereby films were entered at the highest feasible point in an exhibition hierarchy and subsequently cascaded down, over time, through clearly demarcated cinema 'runs'. As a general rule, a pre-release cinema exhibited films at an earlier date than a general release first-run cinema, which in turn had the exhibition opportunity before second-run houses. The scale of prices dropped very rapidly as a film was distributed downwards and outwards through the various 'runs'. The critical factor in this system for the distributor was the rent earned from individual films at each point of exhibition. The typical commercial life of a feature film during the 1930s was brief, usually less than 12 months even for the most popular films. Although re-releases became more common towards the end of the period under investigation, they were never an important element in pre-Second World War film-going and hence not a significant source of box-office receipts. (This brief product life-cycle was reflected in the amortisation schedules – between 12 and 15 months – adopted by the principal Hollywood studios in assessing the profitability of their outputs.)10 Between 1932 and 1939 nominal cinema prices were largely stable. They were also invariant between the respective programmes of individual cinemas. Whereas the renter was able to set premium rates for those films expected to be highly popular with audiences – charging a flat rate plus between 25 and 60 per cent11 of box–office grosses for major features – exhibitors, mindful of the extent of local competition, maintained their price structure irrespective of the film being shown. The distributor and exhibitor appear to have been engaged in a zerosum game where, for any given film, the relative gains of one party were at the expense of the other.12 As a general rule it was in neither's interest to handle films of an inferior quality, given the existence of discriminating audiences, and the supply of alternative film programmes available within localities at similar prices.13

The POPSTAT (popularity) index The POPSTAT index is based upon the exhibition records of between 81 and 92 leading London and provincial cinemas, listed in the Kine Weekly for the period 1 January 1932 to 31 March 1938.14 The changing

sample numbers reflect the entry and exit of cinemas into and from the Kine Weekly lists and/or operation. Where the Kine Weekly records are incomplete, or questionable, London and provincial city newspapers have been used as an additional source of information. The cinemas in the sample were of unequal size, ranging from the 4,200-seater Green's Playhouse in Glasgow to the 587-seater Electra in Sheffield, with a mean size of just under 1,700 seats. Further, their commercial status, manifest in their ability to obtain films from the major distributors before, at, or after the date of general release, significantly affected the prices they could charge. It follows, then, that their gross and net box-office revenue capacities differed considerably. In order to represent these differences each cinema in the sample has been given a weightmg based upon its potential gross revenue capacity obtained by multiplying its mid-range ticket price15 by the number of seats and expressed as a proportion of the mean potential gross revenue of all cinemas in the sample. Hence the weights reflect the relative commercial status of sample cinemas : the revenue capacity of the Empire Leicester Square was, for example, approximately twice that of the Davis Cinema Croydon, four times that of the Piccadilly Manchester, and eight times that of the Regent Glasgow. As the sample varied slightly over the period, so the weights of each cinema are marginally affected. The record of each film is given as:

where POPSTAT = popularity statistic; t = exhibition period; i = ith film; j = jth cinema; n = number of cinemas in the sample set; a = the weighting of the cinema around a mean value ofl; b = the weighting of the exhibition status of a film where 0.5 represents a shared and 1.0 a single billing; 1 = the length of exhibition at each cinema in weeks and half-weeks. Rowson calculated that there were 4,305 wired cinemas in operation in Britain in 1934, while returns from Western Electric suggest 4,205 in 1933, 4,383 in 1934, 4,471 in 1935 and 4,582 in 1936.16 The sample size of between 81 and 92 cinemas, hence, represents a tiny proportion of the overall cinema population. As could be expected, they were almost twice as large as the mean size cinema: approximately 1,700 seats compared with 900.17 They were also much more expensive with the sample mid-range price of approximately 2 shillings being over twice the mean cinema admission price for all cinemas, estimated by Rowson as 10.54 (old) pence.18

Although the proposed index of film popularity (POPSTAT) draws upon the programmes of a selected and unrepresentative sample of cinemas, it can be maintained, with some confidence, that the sample cinema set captures the exhibition characteristics of the market for films as a whole. From a study of the diffusion of 119 'hit' films (all of which had extended London West End runs) as they were exhibited outwards in time and space – first from within the sample cinema set and then beyond to the cinemas of Bolton, Dover, and the Chelsea, Kensington, Fulham and Hammersmith area of West London – it has been possible to confirm the underlying premise: that films which were popular within the sample cinema set continued to be popular as they cascaded down through the distinct tiers of the distribution system.19 It may be objected that the extent of the concentration of ownership among cinemas of the sample set, and thus the potential for monopoly practices, seriously questions the assumption concerning the efficiency of POPSTAT as a measure of relative popularity. Indeed, approximately half of the cinemas in the sample were owned or controlled by the two leading British combines: with Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC)'s share of seating varying between 16 and 18 per cent and that of Gaumont-British between 33 and 36 per cent. (A similar set of proportions emerges from the calculation of gross revenue potential, with ABPC's share ranging from 12 to 15 per cent and that of GaumontBritish between 36 and 38 per cent.) These proportions are considerably in excess of the respective shares of the two vertically integrated organisations with respect to the total population of cinemas, of which ABPC had 225 and Gaumont-British 331 in 1935.20 However, while the exhibition records certainly show that cinemas from each chain biased their exhibition programmes in favour of in-house films, this did not lead to the exclusion of films from rival producers which might have been expected to generate greater box-office receipts. In other words, there is no evidence that the chains operated uncommercially by consistently favouring unpopular in-house films where more popular alternatives were available.

POPSTAT scores: the most popular films of each year earned upwards of 60 times that of those films falling into the modal classification and 10 times that of those at the arithmetic mean.21 It is clear that only a small number of films could expect to become 'hits', with approximately 65 per cent of films earning less than average box-office receipts. At the other end of the distribution only approximately 10 per cent of films earned more than twice the revenue of films at the arithmetic mean and only 2 per cent of films generated scores more than two standard deviations above the mean. The skewed nature of the distribution was important information to studio heads in devising, and allocating

resources to, annual portfolios. 'Hit' production was an inherently risky activity, and clear evidence exists that the major Hollywood studios compensated for the variance in those rates of return associated with big-budget vehicles with the more reliable earning power of smallerbudget products.22 Such strategic thinking contrasts with that adopted by studios such as Goldwyn in the United States and Korda's London Films in Britain, where production consisted of a small number of bigbudget films. As Barry King writes: Looking at the global level of activity, we find that every season produces its hits, but that no particular producer can be absolutely certain of monopolising the 'hit' product. What this means is that any season of releases resembled, at first sight, a zero sum game with some producers having a time-dated monopoly of the total available market, theoretically speaking, since their film orfilmsare the most popular.23 It has been argued earlier that even the presence of vertically integrated combines need not upset this view in that the popular success of Film A produced by company X will lead to a gain for company Y where it is able to exhibit A in its own cinemas. Thus, 'What the lucky producer has, therefore, is a monopoly (copy) right to a film which will give his company access to his competitor's screen time for a price.'24 Market shares Table 1.2 ranks American and British production companies according to market share, measured in terms of the POPSTAT index. It is clear that while the principal seven Hollywood producers (counting Fox and Twentieth Century-Fox as a single company) together took a dominant position in the British market, the dispersion of market shares between them and the major British production company – Gaumont–British – was such as to generate only a low measure of industrial concentration. Beyond these eight, and the dozen or so firms which achieved at least a1per cent share of demand, was a myriad of firms whose individual performance was negligible by industry standards, but which collectively contributed just under 30 per cent of market supply. Hollywood's 'major' studios The seven high-volume Hollywood producers between them contributed almost a half of market supply for the period but achieved a market share of over 60 per cent. Furthermore, the POP:POP column shows that the films of Paramount, MGM, Warners and Fox/Twentieth Century-Fox achieved significantly higher mean POPSTAT scores than the population mean of 5.56. This evidence

is supported by Top 50 and Top 100 information contained in the last two columns of Table 1.2 which sum to 163 and 366, respectively, for the seven studios. If it is assumed that the Top 50 category consists of the 'hit' productions for the years 1932–37 in which complete release records have been collected, then between them the major Hollywood studios accounted for 54 per cent of notable screen successes, with Paramount and MGM producing 77 'hit' films – just under 30 per cent of all 'hit' films. It would appear that the films of RKO, Columbia and Universal were, in general, less popular with British audiences. One of the most important aspects of any analysis of film consumption during the 1930s is not just the pre-eminence of the major Hollywood studios, in terms of the volume of output and its general quality, but also their apparent permanence. With the exception of Universal, these studios generally made over 40 films each per annum. Further, with the exception of Columbia's decision to distribute its own films from 1933 and Universal's to disband its distribution operation in 1937 in favour of the newly formed British firm General Film Distributors (GFD), institutional arrangements remained unchanged during the period. This stability is further emphasised in the annual pattern of market shares for the years 1932–37, shown below. 13–16%

British volume producers Perhaps the most remarkable results to emerge from Table 1.2 are those generated by Gaumont-British. Although it produced between approximately a quarter and a third of the feature film output of major Hollywood producers over the duration, its record of Top 50 hit production was second only to that of MGM.

Table 1.3 reveals a pattern of growth in production up to 1935 which falls back in 1936 and 1937. Of the volume producers marketing films in Britain during the 1930s, including the Hollywood majors, those features released from the Gaumont-British stable were, on average, the most popular for each of the years 1932–37 with an annual mean POPSTAT two to three times that of the population mean. The contrast with films made by the ABPC organisation is marked. Although it produced a similar volume of films over the period, the company's commitment to film-making on the kind of scale sufficient to furnish its own cinemas with a significant number of programme features had ended by 1936. What is most striking about these results is that, given the size of its cinema chain, films from the studio did so poorly in terms of distribution. Not only were British International Pictures (BIP) films not widely shown in independent cinemas, they were not necessarily shown in ABPC-owned cinemas either. The POPSTAT results seem to confirm the studio as one producing support features as a deliberate strategy. British and Dominions was a major domestic player between 1932 and 1935. Its output of films was divided between cheap quota productions made for Paramount which did very poorly in the sample cinema set and bigger-budget productions distributed by United Artists, which conversely did very well, securing 16 Top 50 'hits' over the fouryear period. The performance of the films released in 1936 differs dramatically from the preceding years, and release levels in 1937 are less than half those of the peak years, as the company slipped into quota productions for Paramount at the new Pinewood Studios. During the period 1932–35 these three studios dominated domestic production, with Gaumont-British/Gainsborough and British and Dominions supplying upward of 75 per cent of all domestic Top 50 productions. However, it is apparent from the lower release levels and market shares recorded during the 1936–37 seasons, that they were in decline: Gaumont-British's hold on the domestic market slipped back from the 9 per cent peak achieved with its 1934 and 1935 releases, while British and Dominions' last Top 50 films were released in 1935.25 Smaller scale British 'hit' producers A number of studios operated a commercial strategy based upon the production of a small number of big-budget films, intended as principal screen attractions and for widespread distribution. Goldwyn, Selznick, Twentieth Century (before it merged with Fox in 1935 to become Twentieth Century-Fox), Reliance and Wanger in the United States and London Films (including

productions marketed under the Denham, Pendennis and Saville labels), Wilcox (including the Imperator label), Capitol (including Cecil, Grafton and Trafalgar labels), Criterion and New World in Britain, between them produced only 128 films – less than 3 per cent of releases – but accounted for nearly 9 per cent of demand as measured by the POPSTAT statistic, and, significantly, secured over one-sixth of Top 50 places (51) over the period. All achieved mean POPSTAT scores greater than ten with the principal studios in this category – Goldwyn, Twentieth Century and London Films – achieving twice that and more. The opening of the Denham Studios in May 1936 caused Alexander Korda to expand his producing activities beyond London Films in order to spread the overhead costs. Those films made in 1936 and 1937 under the production labels of Denham, Pendennis and Saville were closely associated with the Korda organisation in terms of sharing key production staff on top of the more routine studio facilities and services. As such it seems sensible to group them together as a body of work. The success of The Private Life ofHenry VIII is commonly used to explain Korda's subsequent success in raising the substantial capital to finance his production ambitions, including the building of Denham.26 Certainly, POPSTAT and Top 50/100 information presented in Table 1.3 suggest that from the outset of 1934 the studio's films were very popular with domestic audiences, with annual mean POPSTAT scores comparable to those of the Goldwyn studio. In Britain the lacuna left by the decline of BIP/ABPC and British and Dominions was partly filled by the emergence of many new smaller companies, established to raise short-term capital to finance small-scale but expensive production plans. Undoubtedly the emergence in 1936 of new first-rate production facilities at Denham and Pinewood stimulated the growth in what Low has termed 'tenant producers'. The production companies associated with Max Schach (Capitol, Cecil, Grafton and Trafalgar) and Herbert Wilcox (Wilcox and Imperator), as well as those previously discussed under London Films, fit this category as does the attempt by the Fairbanks to establish themselves in production in Britain by forming Criterion Films. New World Pictures represents the first example of one of the major Hollywood studios, Twentieth CenturyFox, producing at the quality end of the domestic industry with MGM and Columbia soon to follow. The films of Associated Talking Pictures (ATP), Twickenham (including later variants in the form of J. H. Productions and St Margaret's Films) and British Lion form a residual category in that while they can hardly be described as 'hit' producers, they nevertheless made films

which often achieved a respectable distribution within the sample set. As with B & D, a clear distinction can be made between those films made for principal Hollywood renters for quota purposes and more serious productions distributed by their respective in-house rental arms. In the case of ATP, several Top 50 hits were recorded and the releases of 1934, 1936 and 1937 generated a mean annual POPSTAT score above 10. The other two companies in general fared less well; not owning the contracts of performers as popular as ATP stars Gracie Fields and George Formby, they produced films with mean annual POPSTAT scores a little below that of the population mean. The remaining British producers listed in Table 1.2, as well as those not listed, made films which received only a partial distribution, if any at all, in the sample cinema set. Their films were generally handled by the major Hollywood distributors and made for quota purposes. The final row in Table 1.2 indicates that less than 5 per cent of the supply share and only a little over 1 per cent of the market share can be attributed to films not of an Anglo-American origin. Most of these films were made in either France or Germany/Austria, supplemented with a small number of Soviet and Australian imports. After 1932, with few exceptions, they were not distributed within the sample cinema set and found their outlets in the specialist 'art house' cinemas found in the large metropolitan conurbations and in the local film societies in smaller towns.

Discussion One interesting result which emerges from the rows at the bottom of Table 1.2 is that the films of those domestic companies listed under Principal British Studios account for less than 60 per cent of domestic supply, although some 84 per cent of registered demand for domestic productions. This implies that approximately 40 per cent of indigenous film production was made by short-lived, small-scale companies. The proportion of American films not accounted for by firms in the list in Table 1.2 is much smaller, at less than 20 per cent, taking up only 6 per cent of demand registered for films of American origin in the sample cinema set. The films of the principal US and British studios generate almost identical mean POPSTAT results. This leads to the conclusion that British films made by the major producers were, on average, as popular as their American counterparts with domestic audiences. The results also imply that most of the 40 per cent or so of domestic output not

represented by firms listed in Table 1.2 was very poorly received since its inclusion lowers the mean POPSTAT of British producers from 7.25 to 5.01. The principal US producers held around 70 per cent of the domestic market for all years other than 1932, with all American films holding approximately 75 per cent share between them.27 On the British side, the listed domestic studios held a 22 per cent market share in 1934, 1935 and 1936, while overall British producers held around 25 per cent share; always in excess of quota requirements. The Top 50 category suggests even greater penetration for British films with British studios taking up to 36 per cent share of hit films in the 1934 and 1935 seasons. These results lend support to Marcia Landy's claim: 'My examination of British genres suggests that whether the British critics wished to acknowledge it or not, Britain did in fact have a viable national cinema.'28 They are also broadly confirmed by qualitative information based upon trade journal film reviews presented to the Board of Trade Committee of Inquiry in 1936.29 This source was analysed by Rowson who maintained that for the year 1934 he had demonstrated '[q]uite conclusively, the superior general average attractiveness of British films to British exhibitors, and presumably British audiences'.30 British stardom A consequence of the ability of the POPSTAT index to indicate relative levels of film popularity in Britain is the light thrown on the 'stars' people paid to watch. With the emergence of a significant film production industry in Britain, in the decade following the 1927 Cinematograph Films Act, came the first serious efforts by domestic studio heads to develop indigenous stars. Stardom had been a central feature of the Hollywood mode of production since the early 1920s as the lesson that stars sold films, independently of other filmic qualities, became incorporated in studios' business strategies. In a volatile product environment stars served to attenuate the risk associated with film popularity. By tying stars to term contracts, studios sought to control the dynamic and unpredictable phenomenon of stardom. It also probably enabled them to pay less for star quality in the form of an economic rent than the additional sums that the star might have generated through the box office. British studio heads, in adopting the Hollywood production model, were concerned to create their own phalanx of stars as an aspect of a broader strategy for competing with the ubiquitous Hollywood product in Britain. British stars were required to convince domestic audiences that home-produced films could be as entertaining as those emanating from the United States. Although it is well known that Alexander Korda

took star-building activities very seriously, it is less well known that this activity was a critical element in Michael Balcon's strategy for GaumontBritish/Gainsborough to become a major player in the American market during the mid-1930s. Basil Dean's autobiography testifies to the sums necessary to keep Gracie Fields under contract.31 Table 1.4 lists a bank of stars derived from the POPSTAT scores of annual Top 100 domestic productions for the period 1932–37. A distinction has been made between first-billed and second-billed artistes by giving a weight of 1 to the former and 0.5 to the latter. Accordingly, the POPSTAT result per 'star' refers to the measure of popularity associated with the films in which he or she appears. The ranking order adopted in Table 1.4 is based upon the aggregate POPSTAT scores for the star and is clearly biased in favour of those stars appearing most frequently; i.e. a different order will result if the mean POPSTAT scores of the stars are used as the instrument of discrimination. It is interesting to compare these findings with the lists of the most popular stars among British audiences found in the International Motion Picture Almanac from the 1937–38 edition (for the year 1936) onwards. These were compiled from a poll of domestic exhibitors. Jeffrey Richards has written in detail about the lists and used them as evidence of the degree of popularity enjoyed by Gracie Fields and George Formby in particular.32 While for the greater part the two lists are comparable, Gracie Fields features much less prominently in the POPSTAT-generated lists and George Formby not at all. Indeed, since by the end of 1936 Formby's only releases for ATP were the moderately successful No Limit (1935) and Keep Tour Seats Please (1936) – neither of which made the POPSTAT Top 50 for its respective year – it is difficult to conceive, as suggested by the Motion Picture poll, that Formby was more popular with audiences than Robert Donat, Jack Buchanan, Tom Walls, Ralph Lynn or George Arliss as a consequence of these two productions. Other points of contrast are the relatively high positions taken by Conrad Veidt and Raymond Massey in the POPSTAT lists, whereas Veidt is ranked by the Motion Picture poll as lying in the 11–25th band for 1936 (even lower for 1937), while Massey would appear to be even less popular. A number of factors may explain these disparities. It may be that in adopting a sample of cinemas which drew their audiences primarily from the middle class, the POPSTAT index fails to discriminate between quite distinct social class patterns offilmconsumption in Britain. Drawing upon contemporary social survey material, the World Film News surveys of exhibitors33 and the Mass Observation study at Worktown

(Bolton) , Jeffrey Richards has argued strongly that middle-class audiences were more favourably disposed towards British films than workingclass audiences. Accordingly, the popularity of Fields and Formby with working-class audiences might explain their poor respective POPSTAT showing, while the dramatic vehicles in which Veidt and Massey appeared may have been of greater appeal to the middle class. Such reasoning provides, perhaps, an intuitively attractive solution to the Fields/Formby and Veidt/Massey dichotomies, although, as previously mentioned, my investigation of the diffusion of 119 London West End 'hits' through the lower order cinemas of Bolton, Dover and West London provides no evidence for Richards's hypothesis. There is a clear need for more focused research into distinct patterns of cinemagoing preferences in Britain at the time. Given the prominence of Gaumont-British in the Top 50 'hit' lists of the period, it is not surprising that its stars should feature so prominently in Table 1.4. Walls, Lynn, Hulbert, Matthews, Veidt, Hay, Carroll, Arliss and Courtneidge were all contract players at times or throughout the period and, of course, Donat was the male lead in Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935). Predictably, the poor showing of ABPC (British International Pictures) is reflected in the fact that, of those listed, only Hay and Tauber made appearances in the studios' films. Jack Buchanan and Anna Neagle were instrumental in maintaining the popularity of British and Dominions' major budget productions until 1936, with Neagle continuing to work with her husband Herbert Wilcox and starring in his 'hit' production of Victoria the Great (1937). Donat, Bergner, Leslie Banks, Laughton, Robeson and Howard all starred in Alexander Korda's productions for London Films. From Table 1.4 it is clear that the Top 10 listing in the Appendix is dominated by stars renowned for their comic and/or light musical qualities. Of the 124 appearances of British stars in indigenous films which were counted in the Top 100 films for the years 1932–37, Walls, Hulbert, Matthews, Buchanan, Lynn and Hay featured in 57 between them. If we were to add to these the films of Fields and Courtneidge, the number would rise to well over half and indicates the importance and perhaps the strength of these genres to the British cinema of the period. The crisis of production in the late 1930s Although British film-makers were able to produce films which were popular with domestic audiences, they were less successful in developing business forms and converting this success into profits. As Jarvie has observed: 'In the UK there was

2O

a protracted struggle that at one point seemed to be pushing back, but over confidence led to over extension.'35 'Over extension' manifested itself in a speculative bubble of independent film finance which peaked and then burst in 1936.36 This coincided with the decision of the three domestic volume producers to cut back on production, which they increasingly viewed as loss-making. The expansion of studio floor space, and hence output capacity, peaked precisely at this time with the opening of both Denham and Pinewood studios. This left film-makers with plenty of studio capacity but for the first time since 1927 a shortage of operational finance. In the case of Korda's principal backer, Prudential Assurance, its attempt to gain control of London Films' costs failed and by 1937 it was looking to loosen its ties.37 Unlike the American experience at this time, the British banking sector never became intimately involved with corporate strategy formulation in the industry, preferring to extend overdrafts and reschedule loans to existing producers. It appears that the clearing banks were also an important source of the start-up finance for the plethora of film production companies set up through the Aldgate Trust; by arranging for those loans to be underwritten by Lloyds insurers, the Trust in effect removed the risks associated with film production and finance.38 In contrast to Hollywood,39 the configuration of British production which had emerged by 1935 proved unstable. Although there is some evidence to suggest that some British producers were less efficient40 and that the Hollywood studios enjoyed significant economies of scale advantages, ultimately the size and rate of growth of the domestic market may have been insufficient to allow the principal British producers to obtain positive rates of return from big-budget films.41 The conundrum which manifested itself to ambitious domestic producers was that access to the American market was deemed possible only at the quality end of the market. Accordingly, the risks associated with 'hit' production were great, given that widespread distribution within the American market was not guaranteed. The failure of Gaumont-British to sustain a presence in this market, despite its corporate links with Fox and its effort in establishing an American distribution organisation in 1935, followed by the corporate losses in 1936, forced Britain's premier producer to rethink its strategy.42 ABPC and British and Dominions had already done so. The government's decision to bow to the interests of the American renters and allow double and triple quota films43 under the 1938 Films Act, encouraged MGM, Columbia, and Twentieth Century-Fox to make big-budget films in Britain and, as a consequence, reduce their need to

distribute the products of indigenous companies. This feature of the legislation may well have killed off the 'quota quickie' but, more importantly, it strengthened the hold of American interests in the domestic 'quality' sector of the British market. As Jarvie has commented, these events represent the success of US commercial strategy in an environment in which British producers and government had lost their way: ' (the British) appreciation of their situation was faulty. The fundamental secrets of the success of the Americans were opaque to them. They put it down to chicanery rather than strategy.'44 Nevertheless, the corporate and financial difficulties experienced towards the end of the decade should not deflect attention from the considerable achievements of the industry under quota protection. The heterogeneous nature of film as a commodity implies, even under quota regulations, an element of choice on the part of the distributors and exhibitors. The fact that the latter were compelled to take increasing proportions of domestic footage does not mean that they were indifferent to them. As argued earlier, distributors and renters preferred to handle films which were popular, given an environment in which the opportunities for consuming alternative programmes were readily available to urban communities. The quota legislation, hence, provided domestic producers who wished to operate at the quality end of the market the incentive of a protected market segment to make films which people wanted to see. The POPSTAT results indicate that such films were made in large numbers during the 1930s. Our understanding of the British film industry during this decade ought to be based upon these films and the fact that they were made, together with the corporate forms and configurations, human and physical capital formation which made them possible. From the viewpoint of the moribund state of the industry in the mid-1920s these developments appear nothing short of remarkable.

The Age of the Dream Palace, Jeffrey Richards states that films are IandNentertainment produced by a conveyor-belt mass production process 'often represent considered decisions made by men not actually involved in translating the script into visual images but who nevertheless retain the final say in the production [i.e. producers].'1 He points out how, for instance, at London Films, producer Alexander Korda provided the 'unifying intelligence'. Yet the pivotal role played by the producer is largely overlooked, most probably because it is difficult to specify precisely where his influence operates and how it takes effect, given the absence of any direct input into a film. It is fairly easy to connect other contributors to particular facets of a film: the cameraman and the art director are responsible for the look, the writer provides the story, the editor controls a film's pace. For most people, 'the unifying intelligence' is provided by the director. Yet without the producer the film would not be made, for it is he who provides and sustains the environment necessary for making the product. He raises the finance, chooses the directors, finds and approves projects. He oversees those non-film activities associated with businesses in general, such as marketing and administration. He also acts as a link between the film studio and those other industry branches – distribution and exhibition – responsible for getting the completed film to its audience. In a way which is difficult to define, the producer sets the tone of the studio he runs. Producers in the 1930s fell largely into two categories. There were the businessmen who had made their money in other areas but who saw film-making as a potentially lucrative field into which they could extend their activities. These, as personified by John Maxwell, tended 37

to stay away from the studio but, while leaving the day-to-day running to others, still set the parameters. Then there were the wheeler-dealers who started off with very little except a certain flair, a talent for selling and enormous ambition and drive. They got caught up in film-making in its early days and did whatever came their way: they sold films, handled publicity, and acted as general managers before setting up on their own. These tended to be more flamboyant and colourful characters, whose whole life revolved round film-making and who in the end overshot their mark. This group included Alexander Korda, Herbert Wilcox and Julius Hagen. Hagen was born Julius Jacob Kleimenhagen in Hamburg in 1884 and came to Great Britain as a child. He started out on the stage and was an actor with the Fred Terry and Julia Neilson London-based company which put on lightweight popular plays such as The Scarlet Pimpernel. First entering the film trade in 1913 as a film salesman for Ruffels Pictures, by 1917 he had become a partner with H. F. Double in his own company. Although this started out as a distribution company, an early indication that Hagen was really interested in production came when he started making Kinekature Komedies, a series of shorts starring top musichall artist Lupino Lane at Eel Pie Island. In 1919, like many other companies around this time, it went into bankruptcy but Hagen was in no way discouraged. There followed a couple of difficult years when Hagen and his wife lived in one room in Clapham. He did odd jobs and travelled through Britain hawking films which nobody else wanted to handle. Hilda Hagen later recalled that cinema-owners would tell her: 'He's a nice man but I wish you would try to keep him away. He is always selling me films I don't want.'2 He was a natural salesman, flamboyant and gregarious, and willing to take chances. From the beginning he loved show business and the film industry. Lacking any technical skills which would have allowed him to become a film practitioner, he nevertheless possessed considerable flair and a relish for making deals, qualities vital for a producer. He also possessed stamina, determination and the ability to pursue relentlessly whatever he wanted, oblivious to any setbacks and at times flying in the face of common sense. Once he set his mind on something, he usually got it. In the early 1920s Hagen was taken on as a production manager at Stoll Studios, a big new production outfit operating from a converted aircraft hangar in Cricklewood. This was Hagen's first experience of large-scale film production run on factory lines and it was here he really learned his trade as producer.

In 1926 another film industry depression led to major cutbacks at Stolls and once more Hagen found himself looking for work. However, his luck held and he was taken on as a general manager by Astra National for whom he co-produced with Henry Edwards The Flag Lieutenant (1926). Thanks in no small part to Hagen's skilful exploitation, this film starring Edwards, then Britain's most popular screen actor, was one of the box-office hits of the year; this at a time when British screens were saturated with American films and British film production was verging on extinction. So serious was the situation that, in 1927, in response to vociferous demands from production interests and, more importantly, the powerful Empire lobby, the government passed the Cinematograph Films Act (1927) which made it compulsory for cinemas to show a proportion of British films. Once a market had been guaranteed for Britishfilms,the theory was that finance would follow. If distributors were going to continue to earn the very substantial profits previously made largely from handling American films, then they had to establish a supply of British films. Always quick to recognise an opportunity when one presented itself, and with the right experience behind him to capitalise on the new legislation, in April 1927 Hagen formed Neo Art Productions with Henry Edwards. After a gap of ten years Hagen was back running his own company. There was little agonising over what their first film should be; they quickly concocted The Further Adventures of the Flag Lieutenant (1927),

blatantly capitalising on their previous hit. Although a competently made film which had a reasonably successful release, the most significant thing about The Further Adventures of the Flag Lieutenant was that it took

Hagen to Alliance Studios, Twickenham, which for ten years became his home. Over the next 18 months Hagen was involved in a series of complex deals while he struggled to establish himself as a major player in the British film industry. During this time he issued a series of press releases which tended to be vague about what he had definitely agreed, and, probably deliberately, gave a false impression of the progress of various negotiations. In January 1928, the trade press announced that Hagen was the prime mover in the formation of a '£250,000 company', as yet unnamed, which in the near future would make a public share issue.3 It would appear that at this point he was negotiating for the acquisition of Twickenham Studios, realising that if he was to be anything more than one of a plethora of independent production companies scrambling for contracts on the strength of quota legislation, then he had to gain control of the studio.

The hyperbole accompanying the introduction of a quota requirement had led to the wildly unrealistic expectation that British films would be able to earn the kind of profits made by their Hollywood counterparts. During the early period of euphoria a spate of independent production companies had floated themselves on the Stock Exchange and found their share issues being massively over-subscribed. However, investors soon discovered that not only did British films make much smaller amounts than anticipated, but also the costs of what amounted to establishing a new industry from scratch had been woefully underestimated. Within months these companies were making huge losses, the bottom dropped out of the market and, as a consequence, Hagen's proposed flotation was unable to go ahead. With City finance no longer forthcoming, Hagen recognised that his best, indeed only, course of action was to try to woo those distributors who suddenly found themselves encumbered with the legal obligation to handle a proportion of British films but had no production facilities of their own. At the beginning of May, he was able to announce that he had won a contract from Argosy Films, a small British distributor, to produce two films, the first – The Passing of Mr. Quin, an adaptation of an Agatha Christie story – going into production immediately. From then on other contracts began slowly to trickle in. Hagen worked indefatigably to establish his new company and came up with a variety of ingenious solutions for keeping his venture afloat. For instance, in that pre-talkie era, through the relatively cheap process of inserting foreign-language intertitles, the potential audience could be widened from a domestic to an international one, thus introducing the possibility of attracting overseas finance. At the end of November, shortly before Ringing the Changes went into production, Hagen returned from Berlin where he had sold the German rights. Consequently, Henry Edwards, who had been lined up to star in the film, found himself with a German leading lady, Margot Landa. To win the contract, he must have committed himself to a quick delivery of a completed film because Bioscope reported: 'Some hustler this man Hagen! Had his company out at St. Margaret's at 10 o'clock last Saturday morning and they kept at it till 5 a.m. on Monday.'4 If necessary, Hagen was prepared to work through the night and over the weekend, and expected his staff to do likewise. While there was little other activity on the production side, with just three films being made by Hagen's company that year, there had undoubtedly been a lot of hard bargaining going on behind the scenes. In December 1928 Hagen was finally able to announce he had secured the lease of Twickenham Film Studios.

Hagen scarcely had the opportunity to congratulate himself on pulling off this impressive coup before he was confronted by a major new challenge: 1929 saw the arrival of 'talkies' in Britain. The popularity of the new medium was such that he realised that his newly acquired studio had to be converted for sound production if it was to remain viable. On 22 April 1929, therefore, Julius Hagen signed a contract with Radio Corporation of America for the immediate equipping of Twickenham Studios with RCA Photophone apparatus. According to the critic A. Jympson Harman, Hagen later confessed that 'he was in the middle of a silent film To What Red Hell starring Sybil Thorndike, when he saw Sonny Boy one night. The next day he had a headache. The world was breaking up for him. So he went out and brought up the second talkiemaking machine. The deposit was £1,000. He hadn't got it. But just in the nick of time he found the money.'5 Needing to generate income quickly and with sound facilities still in short supply, he made certain that any producer looking for a studio floor knew that space was available at Twickenham. Although in the long term Hagen wanted to keep the Twickenham stage busy with Twickenham productions, letting out floor space in the interim helped to cover immediate debts and expenses. As pointed out in the Daily Telegraph: 'His capital was tiny. To equip a new studio, or even to rent one on ordinary terms, was out of the question. He solved the problem by hiring the Twickenham studios by night while others used them, by day.'6 From Hagen's standpoint, the quota film was the only effective means of building up his company and it was a device he was not ashamed to use. Given the fact that City money had completely dried up, independent producers had no alternative but to turn to the US distributors who were prepared to make only minimal finance available – average budgets appear to have been around £6,000. Films of this era were often disparagingly referred to as 'quota quickies'. Whereas a handful of producers were interested only in their fees and put no effort into making their films, the majority, like Hagen, put everything they had into making decent films despite the limited resources at their disposal. This did not mean that Hagen refrained from pursuing any other potential source of finance. During 1929, with talkie fever at its height, there was much wishful talk of Britain becoming the co-production capital of Europe. Hagen, as was so often to be the case, could be found in the forefront of exploiting a newly perceived opportunity. In October, At the Villa Rose was made at Twickenham in English and

French, and proclaimed as the very first bilingual film to be made in England. The practicalities involved in making multi-lingual films turned out to be more problematic than envisaged – the costs were high, the end product inferior – so after that one experiment Hagen dropped the policy. His lack of capital meant that he could not proceed with any venture which did not deliver an immediate profit, unlike the British major, BIP, which spent large sums on making a series of high-cost, multi-language films despite initially discouraging results, in the hope that, over the long term, profit levels would improve. Any disappointment Hagen might have felt over this hiccup would soon have been forgotten when, at the end of 1929, he won hisfirstbig contract with an American distributor: he was to make six films for Warner Brothers. This was to mark a turning point in his career: Hagen had finally managed to put Twickenham on a solid footing. Although progress up to then had been painfully slow, the early 1930s witnessed a phenomenal expansion in his level of operation, and 1930 was the last year he needed to take in a substantial number of outside lets to cover overheads. Other US renters had obviously been impressed by the way Hagen fulfilled his contracts for Warners because between1931and 1933 he won contracts with MGM, Radio, Fox, United Artists and Universal. He made 12, 15 and 20 films respectively in those years. In its review of 1931, Kine Weekly reported: 'Not only has the consistently high standard of its product been maintained, there have been produced at Twickenham the second largest number of films from any British studio this year. Julius Hagen stands out among independent British producers as the man who has achieved more than any other unaffiliated to the renter–exhibitor section of the industry, to forward British films at the box office.'7 By 1932 Twickenham was so busy that the practice of late-night shooting became formalised and the studio employed both a day and a night shift.8 Ray Elton, a camera assistant, recalled that when he arrived in the morning the camera would still be hot from being used all night.9 Hagen established a reputation for making films on time and within budget. Equally, his films were popular with the public. As A. Jympson Harman observed five years later: 'Since he has been an independent producer he has concentrated on making films that the masses want. He has no time for us critics and our highbrow ideas. We laughed at his In a Monastery Garden, The Rosary, The Lost Chord and such-like simple

sentimental dramas. But millions about this country of ours loved them.'10

The ability to turn out so many popular and entertaining films while operating under the most daunting circumstances can be attributed to the quality and cohesiveness of the Twickenham team which Hagen had put together very early on. Its principal members were James Carter (art director), Sydney Blythe and Basil Emmott (cameramen), Cyril Stanborough (stills), Baynham Honri (sound), William Trytel (music), H. Fowler Mear (script) and Jack Harris (editor). Leslie Hiscott was a regular director; Maurice Elvey, Henry Edwards, George Cooper all did long stints at the studio. Hagen's technical team showed enormous loyalty in an industry where it was common practice to jump from company to company, and they stayed with him till the end. Given that pressure of time often prevented technicians from referring to the director for specific instructions, teamwork was an essential factor in maintaining output levels. This was particularly important as Twickenham budgets allowed little scope for rehearsal and retakes. Familiarity with each other's working habits cut down the need for explanations both between fellow technicians and between the director and technicians. In addition Carter, Emmott, Stanborough and Harris were among the best technicians working in their field. Director Berhard Vorhaus described Cyril Stanborough as the best stills man in England and recalled the quite amazing art director Jimmy Carter, who managed to get an amazing quantity of sets overnight ... He had an amazing effective plaster department with a tremendous number of moulds. He would whip up scenes with elaborate plaster Tudor beams, trees, God knows what, which were quite out of proportion to the meagre resources in general. He was extremely adept as were the men who worked for him.11 Even those technicians who were competent but uninspired, such as Fowler Mear and Trytel, were perfectly tuned in to the demands of popular audiences and were good at churning out material non-stop. Hagen fully realised that the quality of his films reflected the quality of his film-makers. Later, when Hagen went into higher-costfilms,Ray Elton recalled that while he was a £4 a week camera assistant, his boss Curt Courant was earning £120 a week.12 While wages generally at Twickenham were low, Hagen was always prepared to pay well for key staff, not just on the technical side; Vorhaus also recalled that Hagen would use expensive actors as long as it was for a limited period.13 Already by 1933 it was possible to observe that British producers, including Hagen, were beginning to make better films. British studios, which now had good quality equipment, and Britishfilm-makers,who

now had acquired the neccessary technical skills, were eager to take on more ambitious projects than hitherto. Moreover, the American majors, badly hit by the depression, had cut back on their own production schedules with the result that some companies, such as United Artists, found themselves with insufficient films to fulfil their distribution obligations. Consequently they were prepared to pick up a small number of films from outside sources. The charming comedy / Lived With You (1933) provides a good instance of the different calibre of film beginning to be made at Twickenham. It starred and was written by Ivor Novello, one of the most important stars of the West End who would have commanded a princely salary. Hagen paid over £2,000 for the film rights alone. There was also The Wandering Jew (1933), with the charismatic German actor Conrad Veidt, described by Kine Weekly as 'the most ambitious and spectacular subject yet attempted at Twickenham'.14 Both these films were made for distribution by W & F, a subsidiary of Gaumont, but it would seem that they were partly financed by Gaumont and Hagen himself. Also in 1933, after falling out with Basil Dean, who up to then had been making their quota films at Ealing, Radio asked Hagen to produce This Week of Grace (1933) with Gracie Fields, then the top-earning and most popular female British star who, as such, merited quality vehicles. Admittedly, the majority of the 20 films Twickenham turned out during 1933 were typical quota fare; nevertheless, it is possible to identify a handful of films that did not come into the 'churn them out quick and cheap' category. Nineteen thirty-four was a landmark year not just for Hagen and Twickenham but for the entire British film industry. Up to then British films, with only a handful of exceptions, were made for domestic release, the majority being financed by American distributors who wanted to keep expenditure to a minimum. The hugely successful US release of Alexander Korda's The Private Life of Henry VIII in late 1933 was attributed to this film's unusually high production values and established a myth that if other British producers made high-cost, 'quality' films, they too could break into US markets. Throwing off its former wariness of the film industry, the City was persuaded that production could yield high returns with little risk. By the middle of the decade, City institutions, particularly insurance companies, were falling over themselves in the rush to tie up established producers, and the industry was deluged with money. This was the opportunity Hagen had been waiting for. While prepared to grind out low-cost films for American producers to build up his operation, five years after setting up his own company he still had no

real independence. Being totally reliant on the readiness of the US distributors to renew their contracts, Hagen had no bargaining power whatsoever – he either accepted the terms being offered or they went elsewhere. As these terms incorporated a flat fee rather than a percentage of box office, the opportunities for making a profit were very limited. The alternative source of finance offered both independence from the Americans and the possibility of earning really big money. Hagen, like many producers, had a strong gambling streak. So far, following his instincts had served him well and here was his chance to step into bigtime production of mainstream films. Furthermore, because his take would be based on a percentage of profits earned in what were perceived as the lucrative US markets, his potential earning capacity skyrocketed. Wealth and respectability beckoned. In January 1934, Hagen announced he was embarking on the production of films targeted at the international market.15 As yet Hagen was not able, nor altogether ready, to abandon the type of production on which he had so successfully built up his company. He still had a number of contracts negotiated during the previous year and it was not until the middle of 1934 that the finance was definitely in place. Initially he planned to raise finance through a public issue in May 1934, but in the end this proved unnecessary. As has been seen, around this time insurance companies were investing heavily in film production and Hagen was able to get the finance he needed from the insurance company C. T. Bowring (later absorbed by the Prudential). By the beginning of 1934, Hagen found that his large production schedule could no longer be accommodated at Twickenham itself, and work began in February on building a new studio floor with extensive outbuildings. Concluding a report on the progress of construction, Kine Weekly commented: 'this remarkably active organisation becomes a formidable rival in output to Elstree and Shepherd's Bush.'16 In fact, 1934 was to see production at Twickenham reach its peak with 21 films being made there (another three films were also made at Merton Park). The new studios, which Hagen claimed had cost £100,000, were officially opened on 17 September 1934. Hagen excelled at publicity and maintained very cordial relations with the press, particularly the trade press. He would regularly supply stories for them to use and journalists were always made welcome. He was also generous with his hospitality and the announcement of any major new venture would be accompanied by a lavish dinner or party. At the opening of Twickenham Studios, Kine Weekly observed: 'Few people in the Trade throw a better party than the Twickenham people

and Monday's celebration surpassed even the high standard set by Mr Hagen.'17 This was not a trivial matter. For an independent producer who lacked the influence to demand and the budget to pay for good press coverage, a friendly and personal relationship with the press was essential. Equally, when trying to win financial backing, a portfolio of very positive write-ups about his dedication, business acumen, reliability, and so on proved very useful. Early 1935 saw Hagen exuding optimism about the future of British films and stressing Twickenham Studios' total commitment to the production of 'quality' films. He asserted in Kine Weekly: 'Our pictures are no longer sneered at by foreign buyers or contemptuously spoken of by audiences. The way is now clear for British films of the future to enter the world's theatres, and it is up to every one of us to see that the films shown are of the type of which we can be proud.'18 His plans for the year included the production of over 30 films, most of which would be 'on a larger scale', and the artists signed up for these films included Betty Balfour, Stanley Holloway, John Garrick, Jane Carr, Ian Hunter and Seymour Hicks. While none of these was a major cinema star, they were all first-rate artists. For instance, Seymour Hicks was one of the foremost names of British theatre, John Garrick was a hugely popular singer of the day and Ian Hunter was an urbane and polished player who was quickly snapped up by Hollywood. Hagen's plans for expansion were not restricted to production; in May 1935 he set up his own renting organisation, Twickenham Film Distributors Ltd. In Britain, at any rate, the film industry was dominated by the distribution sector which provided the finance for production and then laid claim to the largest slice of box office. Hagen undoubtedly felt that if he was to become a major operator in his own right, he had to set up his own distribution arm. He saw this as something which would give him real autonomy: If I make pictures for other companies, as I have done for the past few years, it is inevitable that others should have a right to discuss the type of films to be produced. Now I am making films for myself and the company I control, I have complete ruling over the subjects chosen and also over the stars and directors employed. I can spend what money I think adequate on each picture.19 Furthermore, even if a major distributor could be persuaded to handle Hagen's films, it was unlikely they would promote them as vigorously as their own. Hagen was an excellent salesman and had previously worked in distribution. It was a logical stop for him to take over the selling of his own films.

Hagen put considerable effort into wooing his customers, the exhibitors. He placed great stress on personal contact and his staff toured round the country canvassing individual cinema managers rather than negotiating with the circuit head offices, though this would indicate he was dealing to a larger extent with the independent cinemas rather than the circuits. He saw publicity as an important weapon in the success of his company. Twickenham Film Distributors produced press books which, while failing to meet the standard of the full-colour booklets put out by the American distributors, were lavish for an operation of its size. He told the trade press: 'I have realised the full value of a forceful publicity campaign in gaining the attention and appreciation of the public and exhibitors.'20 He held regular sales conferences at which he both boosted the morale of his salesmen and exhorted them to do better. If good marketing skills had been a factor in the company's success, Twickenham Film Distributors would have done very well. In October 1935, Hagen experienced his first major setback when a fire completely destroyed the old studio building at Twickenham. The fire was spotted by Jack Dexter, a night telephone operator, who saw smoke coming from a camera room. Thirty men working in the studio at the time escaped, but despite the fire brigade's efforts the flames spread and gutted the entire building. The camera equipment and the sound recording department were completely destroyed. Cyril Stanborough, the studio's stills cameraman, lost 15 years of work, but fortunately no film negatives were destroyed. Although the labels on some tins were burnt, the reels inside were unharmed. (During the much later bankruptcy proceedings, it was revealed that the insurance company paid out only £50,000, whereas Hagen himself put the estimated loss at £100,000.) This in no way slowed Hagen down. By the end of the month he had acquired Whitehall Studios, Elstree, which provided him with alternative floor space. A new company called J. H. Productions was formed to make films in the newly acquired studio. Maurice Elvey, who had directed for Hagen during the early 1930s and had a proven record of turning out commercially successful films, was made head of production. All the films made under the J. H. label were intended to be 'quality' productions and were given appropriate budgets. At the end of May, to crown all his other achievements, Hagen announced that the legendary D. W. Griffith had been signed to remake his silent classic Broken Blossoms. (Although Griffith was brought over to England, alcoholism had taken too strong a hold of him and Hagen had to find another director to make the film.)

THE UNKNOWN 1930S

On the surface all seemed to be going well. At the first sales conference of Twickenham Film Distributors, its managing director, Arthur Glavering, made encouraging noises: 'I am pleased to say that since our incorporation which is less than five months ago we have reached a position ranking equal to any of the major renting companies.'21 A number of its films had won enthusiastic reviews: Scrooge, a version of Dickens's A Christmas Carol with Seymour Hicks, whose performance as Ebenezer Scrooge has yet to be surpassed; She Shall Have Music, a pleasant piece which was really an excuse to feature one of Britain's top dance bands (Hagen paid Jack Hylton and his band over £1,000 a week and Hylton was to receive a percentage of the film's profits); A Fire Has Been Arranged, featuring a rich selection of Flanagan and Allen routines and songs; and 'The Last Journey, a portmanteau film set on a runaway train with director Bernard Vorhaus winning fine performances from a particularly good cast which included Hugh Williams and Godfrey Tearle. In April 1935 with the handing over of Inside the Room to Universal, Twickenham made its final 'quota' film. While this could be interpreted as Hagen moving on and up as a producer, it nevertheless meant that from that point on his income now depended on his films getting cinema bookings. The following month he declared: 'I am being backed so confidently that I can make as many films as my studio floor space and shooting schedules allow.'22 In fact, this was far from the case, and from around this time it is possible to detect a marked decline in output. Yet in public Hagen remained bullish. In December 1935, reporting a conversation with Hagen, journalist Jympson Harman wrote: 'His name is so good among his City colleagues and his plans are so inspiring that they have £500,000 ready for him to spend.'23 Nevertheless, during 1936 the number of films produced by Hagen dropped to 11. To a certain extent the reduction in output can be attributed to the fact that Hagen had taken the decision to make fewer but better-quality films which required a longer shooting schedule. But in the past Hagen had always pushed his resources to the limit, so if he produced only 11 films, he had finance for only 11 films. Though Hagen was now following a policy of 'quality' production aimed at a wider market, it needs to be pointed out that Hagen never indulged in the kind of extravagances associated with Korda's London Films or Max Schach's Capitol group of companies. According to Hagen, the six J. H. films cost around £200,000 while Gaumont's The Tunnel (1935) cost that alone.24 In a Kine Weekly article entitled 'Pictures that Pay their Way – Quality but Not Extravagance', Hagen reasserted his

STUDIOS

commitment to making films aimed at the international market but not to unlimited expenditure. He declared: I feel strongly on the question offinance.I do not intend to spend fantastic sums in order to compete with film companies who do not consider a film worthwhile unless it costs anything up to £100,000. I shall spend freely, but not extravagantly, during 1936, as I believe it quite possible to make box-office winners without running up exorbitant and noncommercial production costs. In this way I am certain that I shall get my money back on each film.25 The J. H. films were staged and carefully scripted. Sufficient studio time was allocated to create a finely crafted film. In the first half of the decade, Twickenham technicians were almost exclusively British, as were the on-screen personnel, but from the middle of the decade there were an increasing number of European and American artists and technicians to be found at the studio. These included Edward Everett Horton, Richard Barthelmess, Lupe Velez, John Brahm, Curt Courant and the British-born but Hollywood-based Cedric Hardwicke and Boris Karloff. Hagen wrote: 'When I consider an American artiste or Continental technician can do a particular job of work better than anyone else. I shall not hesitate to employ him. In this way I hope that I shall make our product welcome in every country of the world.'26 Technically, the films were far superior to anything the company had made in the early 1930s. However, money still had to be spent carefully. Battle sequences, for instance, would be replaced by an intertitle announcing the result. It should have been possible to recover the cost of these films from a good British release, and even a modest level of overseas earnings should have yielded handsome profits. The first indication to the outside world that all was not well came in February 1936 when Arthur Clavering resigned as joint managing director of Twickenham Film Distributors. His departure, however, was accompanied by a plausible explanation: he was leaving to manage a cinema group he had acquired. Any lingering unease would have been assuaged when Hagen revealed new plans for a major expansion of his operation. In March 1936 Hagen announced that Twickenham Film Distributors had acquired the assets of Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) which included Triumph Studios, Hammersmith. A new stage was being constructed at J. H. Studios, Elstree, which meant Hagen would soon have at his disposal five large shooting stages. As late as September 1936, at a Twickenham Film Distributors' sales conference, Hagen was

5O

optimistically forecasting that before long Twickenham would be in a position to supply exhibitors with one film every fortnight. Yet just three months later, the week before Christmas, it was announced that in future Twickenham product would be released through Wardour, Twickenham Film Distributors would disappear as a separate renting entity and the sales force would be disbanded. Hagen stated: 'I am taking this step because although the bookings on my films have been so far quite satisfactory, I am of the opinion that the huge cost of a renting organisation cannot be justified with the limited number of pictures that are produced at my studios.'27 While undoubtedly a serious setback, it was not seen as one which would affect the core business. Hence the industry was totally unprepared for the announcement on 8 January 1937 in the Daily Film Renter of 'Receiverships For Three British Companies! – Twickenham Film Distribs., J.H. Productions and Twickenham Studios.' There was widespread shock that, after so many years of hard work building up the Twickenham operation into a really solid success, it should apparently crumble almost overnight. The trade paper Kine Weekly gave expression to the general dismay under the heading 'The Twickenham Tragedy'. It observed: It is a serious thing when a concern with such a fine steady production record over a long period comes to grief. The irony of it is that Hagen is the very last man who can be accused of that prodigal studio waste which has existed in one or two other enterprises. Twickenham has successfully followed a policy of well-organised expenditure on films planned and carried out with the minimum of delay. Hagen himself is a big-hearted, hard-working chief of real experience, and on that score I cannot re-call any personal failure in the Trade being received with more sympathetic regret.28 It was not immediately apparent that the Twickenham failure signalled the end of the film boom and the beginning of a general collapse of film production in Britain which lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Daily Telegraph, for instance, sanguinely observed: 'it is not expected that the failure of the group of independent film companies will have any serious repercussions.'29 The receiver was appointed to Twickenham Film Studios on behalf of the Westminster Bank and to Twickenham Film Productions and J. H. Productions on behalf of the insurance companies which had been guaranteeing the finance for Hagen's various activities. Initially Hagen showed his usual buoyancy. Within a few days the

Evening News reported that Hagen was about to form a new production company whose films would be released by John Maxwell of Associated British Pictures Ltd.30 The new company was to be based at Twickenham Studios and the original Twickenham unit was to be re-ernployed. This scheme was largely dependent on Hagen's being able to go into voluntary bankruptcy and Hagen pledged a proportion of profits would be used to repay debtors over the next five years. Although the majority of debtors were in favour of accepting the scheme, including Bowring (the biggest debtor), a minority, headed by the Westminster Bank, insisted on proceeding with compulsory winding up. A petition was submitted in the Chancery division on 22 February 1937 by Betty Balfour who was owed £59. The Official Receiver's report which finally appeared in September 1937 observed that the crisis was brought about by the sudden withdrawal of promised support by an insurance company before the director could obtain financial assistance from other sources. It revealed that, while to the outside world the end had appeared with brutal suddenness, in fact Hagen had been negotiating with creditors over a long period and the insurance companies had been seriously considering pulling out for some time. Film companies have always tended to be rather circumspect about their finances, either because they want to hide the size of their profits, as in the case of the American distributors, or because they want to hide quite how shaky their position is, as in Hagen's case. The receiver's report revealed that Hagen's various companies had built up around £370,000 of debt (£269,409 relating to J. H. Productions). His financial affairs turned out to be extremely tortuous, with, for example, one of his companies lending money to another. Assets had been substantially over-valued. For instance, the sale of Twickenham Film Studio assets valued at £75,000 fetched only £36,369 16s. 2d. The collapse of Hagen's business was attributed 'to heavy salaries paid to the directors, particularly Mr. Hagen, to the excessive optimism of Mr. Hagen regarding the value of film production and the omission of the directors to make proper provision for the capital necessary to finance the programme on which they embarked.'31 The Official Receiver's report revealed that Hagen drew out between 10 and 20 per cent for studio rental on every picture the company produced, plus 25 per cent of the company's net profits. Rachael Low compares Hagen unfavourably to Michael Balcon at Gaumont Studios,32 but it should be remembered that Balcon was simply an employee of Gaumont. The company's owners, the Ostrers, would have been taking far more out

of the company. Twickenham was Hagen's – without him there would have been no company. During the bad times he had ploughed back the profits to build up the company. During good times, it was quite acceptable for him to earn a generous portion of profits. Moreover, however generous the salary, this would not have been a major contributory factor to the company's huge debts. The accusation of the over-optimistic valuation on the earning power of his films was true, but it was not a policy Hagen deliberately followed to defraud investors; he was genuinely convinced that his films would make substantial profits. The company's lack of capital, however, was an important factor, one which has been responsible for driving many small producers into bankruptcy. Hagen had always chosen to expand rather than accumulate reserves. He saw his world as being made up of opportunities for him to build a bigger and better company. No sooner had he achieved one goal than he would set out in pursuit of another. Over-commitment of finance was almost a way of life at Twickenham. With the arrival of talkies in 1929, he had over-stretched himself to buy sound equipment; but on this occasion the gamble paid off handsomely. In the mid-1930s, he similarly stretched his resources to the limit, spending on films, a distribution company and studios. However, this time the gamble went badly wrong and he found his income dropping dramatically. The lack of reserves meant that he had nothing to offer creditors which might have bought him time to restructure his operation or ride out market fluctuations. The receiver's report, however, was that of an accountant looking at the immediate mechanics which led to the collapse of Hagen's empire and it refrained from looking at the wider context within which the failure occurred. In the late 1920s/early 1930s, low-budget films made for quota purposes provided the economic base upon which Twickenham, and a substantial section of the British film production industry, was built. Although today low budget is automatically associated with independent and large budget with major, this was not then the case. The output of most production companies in this period was predominantly made up of low-budget films. These allowed an industry which was short of both film-making facilities and trained personnel to make good this deficiency. By the mid-1930s, things were moving on. An astute observer like Hagen could deduce that the type of film on which he had concentrated had had its day. Audiences were becoming more sophisticated. Britain had built up a number of strong cinema circuits which had the bargaining power to demand good supporting features. Other companies with which Hagen had to compete were moving over to higher-cost production.

There was now a pool of skilled and experienced personnel along with first-class production facilities; so the excuses which were previously used by US distributors to justify the small sums made available for their British films were no longer valid and, given the pressures being put on the government, it seemed very likely that either a cost or a quality test would be added when the 1927 Films Act came up for renewal in 1938. Hagen had to change with the times if his company was to remain viable. While it is possible to argue that Hagen's move into higher-cost film production was a logical step from the standpoint of operating in the British industry, he was not altogether motivated by logic, having been swept away by the euphoria then affecting the film industry. He was presented with an opportunity to transform his company into a largescale operation and for the first time he had access to the kind of finance which would allow him to give full vent to his ambitions. After the collapse of Twickenham he openly admitted that on being told that The Private Life of Henry VIII had opened the American market to British pictures for ever, he had 'joined the gold rush'.33 Ironically, the very ambition and drive which accounted for his success prior to 1935, now led Hagen to over-reach himself. It did not take long for disillusionment to set in. Like Gaumont, Korda and Wilcox, Hagen discovered that the US film industry had successfully devised a means of sabotaging British films not sponsored by the Hollywood majors in the US market. He related, for instance, how the Americans had told him they wanted 140 prints of Scrooge and, when they arrived, he was informed they were too late for Christmas distribution. As has been shown, Hagen always kept a strong rein on expenditure and although the films he made in 1935–36 were considerably more expensive than his earlier output, the average budget appears to have been around £31,000. Unlike Gaumont, Max Schach or Korda films, which cost four or five times as much as Hagen's and which were financed on the basis of earning sizeable revenues in overseas markets, the Twickenham films could have broken even if they had received a good UK release. Not being able to get a proper British release was as much responsible for Hagen's losses on the film-making side as not being able to break into the US market. Hagen revealed that the earnings of the first three J. H. films to be released came to the astonishingly low amount of £256, showing the extent to which Hagen's films, once he had lost his tie to the US distributors, had failed to get even a modest domestic release.34

54

THE UNKNOWN 1930S

In an interview with Seton Margrave following his bankruptcy, Hagen commented on how he had found it much harder to persuade exhibitors to take his films than had been the case when he had worked in distribution companies 20 years earlier.35 This could be directly attributed to the decline of the independent exhibition sector and the growth of combines. Whereas even in the late 1920s there were a large number of small independent cinema circuits, by the mid-1930s exhibition was dominated by three major circuits which accounted for most premier sites. A successful release became dependent on being picked up by one of these, and a system of informal but ironcast 'understandings' resulted in practically all bookings being allocated to the British and American majors. There no longer existed a clear-cut correlation between the quality of an individual film and its ability to win bookings. In fact, the films Hagen made for American distributors had a better chance of being screened than did the generally better films made for his own distribution company. The situation was exacerbated in the mid-1930s by a surfeit of good quality British films against which Hagen's films were having to compete. The problem of finding outlets for his films resulted in cash-flow difficulties and he lacked the capital which might have allowed him to sit out a period of losses. Hagen's failure can be compared with Rank's success. The major difference between the two was that Rank had a fairly large family fortune on which he could call to cover his early losses; once established, he then acquired his own circuit when he discovered, like Hagen, he could not get his films booked by existing ones. Hagen had faced major problems in the past, including an earlier bankruptcy, and had overcome them, but not on this occasion. The last ten years had used up too much of his energy and the nature of the film industry had changed so it no longer offered a sympathetic environment for independent producers such as himself. By 1937 the British industry was already heading into a major slump and the situation was exacerbated by the Cinematograph Films Act of 1938. The possibility of Hagen returning to the production of low-cost films in order to rebuild his operation was no longer an option. Production never again returned to the volume levels of pre-1937 and independent producers found themselves scrambling for one-off commissions from American distributors. The mid-1930s assault on overseas markets was not simply motivated by the desire to make large sums of money. Had British producers been able to secure new markets the additional revenue could have been used to finance their production programmes and free them from being

financially dependent on the US and British majors. This was seen as vital if Britain was to have a powerful independent production sector, since the experience of the early 1930s had demonstrated that the US companies were not interested in promoting good British films and the British majors lacked the resources to back more than their own production schedule. It had been a gamble with high stakes and one lost at a high cost, not only to Hagen personally but to the entire independent production sector; in the future, it was only through being sponsored either by US distributors or by one of the British majors that films made by independents could gain access to the cinemas. What happened to Hagen can be seen as reflecting the major weakening of the independent production sector then taking place. At the end of the 1930s, the monopoly control over the British film industry was far tighter than it had been in 1927. Just how important Julius Hagen was to the production offilmsat Twickenham can be seen from the fact that once he lost heart and gave up the fight, there was no one else from within the company who could step forward and retrieve the situation. He had been the dynamo which gave the operation life and without him it could not survive. Julius Hagen had been Twickenham Films. Although Hagen made several efforts to start up again, the odds against him were just too steep and years of overwork, stress and disappointment had taken their toll. On 8 February 1940, P. L. Mannock reported in Kine Weekly that Julius Hagen, who had been in poor health for some time, had died suddenly at his home from a stroke. Praising the 'sporting spirit' in which he took his reverses and 'his courageous attempts' to make a comeback, the tribute concluded: 'Hagen's record, over dozens of pictures, was one of real achievement, and his withdrawal from the field made a serious difference to British output.'

Hollywood and Britain: MGM and the British 'Quota' Legislation H. Mark Glancy

cinema of the 1930s was shaped by two Acts of Parliament, the 1927 Cinematograph Films Act and the 1938 Cinematograph Films Act. Both were designed to bolster the British film industry, which had almost ceased to exist in the mid-1920s. The primary problem for Britain's film-makers was that American films took the vast majority of Britain's box-office revenues, while the British industry was faced with a shortage of investment and a cinema-going public that seemed content with American films. The Cinematograph Films Acts sought to redress this by requiring that British film distributors and exhibitors handle a certain percentage, or 'quota', of British-made films. The Hollywood studios distributed their own films
