        "text": "A film about writing a book is quite a hard undertaking and a tough sell – how did you balance the quest element of Isabel’s writing journey with the intellectual heft of her ideas?\n\nIt made it easier to think about writing a movie about a woman on a journey. I’m not smart enough to write a movie about Caste. Making it about the character as opposed to about the subject matter allowed me to create a story that might be compelling and emotional, but also to let myself off the hook from writing a movie about a big anthropological theory.\n\nHow did you first come to Isabel Wilkerson’s book?\n\nThe book was being passed around and talked about in the summer of 2020. This is the first summer of the pandemic, the summer that George Floyd is murdered. So there was a lot of introspection, a lot of heightened emotion. So I read it with all those emotions swirling around and was compelled to share the ideas with others.\n\nThe book was almost bookended by racial violence – with the impetus to write the book coming from the verdict in the Trayvon Martin murder case?\n\nI never thought of it that way. The bookends of the two cases, the impetus for her writing it, a lot of that came from her reaction to the to the Trayvon Martin verdict and then it comes out the summer of George Floyd’s murder. The tragedy of that bookending is heartbreaking.\n\nAre you hoping to change minds with this film – and did the process of making Origin change you?\n\nThe ideas in the book gave me new language for things I deal with socially and culturally. But the way it changed me was much more personal. To be able to organise my thoughts about myself, my place in the world, the way I see other people. And to challenge that notion of the way I see other people. To understand that in some rooms, I would be considered the dominant caste, in other rooms I’m considered a lower caste – it’s that constant negotiation. So many of us occupy these multiple identities, but do those identities really pinpoint who we are inside? These identities are shells, constructed by us and for us, and really inhibit us from getting to the core of ourselves and other people. That was deeply personal.\n\nDid it change your way of working?\n\nI went into the filmmaking with a new openness to applying the things I’ve learned to the filmmaking process. Whether it was the way we structured our production or ways in which I was interacting with different people or the depth of the exploration with actors. All of it kind of went into a stew and it was an extraordinary experience.\n\nWhat was the exploration you undertook with the actors?\n\nAll the actors perform on a level that goes way beyond the surface. They had a beautiful, deep connection to the mission at hand, which was to bring these very muscular ideas to the public in a very accessible way. To do that, you have to know the detail of the idea. So everyone went to school, you know? And the most glorious example is Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor – everything she’s saying, writing, reading in the film, she’s actually doing. She’s actually studying. And she brought all those layers to the work.\n\nIt’s frustrating her performance has not been acknowledged more widely in awards season…\n\nHer performance will stand the test of time. The goal is for people to discover it and it’s such wonderful work that it’ll be around for a while.\n\nThe moment Isabel finds out the Nazis used US Jim Crow laws as a blueprint for the laws that created the Holocaust is shocking…\n\nWhen reading the book, I was astounded by it. And I was also angered. I was upset that I did not know it. How is this not taught in school? Why is this not a part of the American educational landscape – to understand the good, the bad, the ugly of the place where we live? The idea that the very protocols and processes and procedures of one of the greatest atrocities in human history were predicated on my country’s own history, specifically, victimising a group of people I am a part of – black folks – was startling. And it was something that really called to me to be amplified.\n\nAre you on a quest that mirrors the one we see in the film? To share your learning in a way that is accessible, intelligent, entertaining?\n\nWhen something grabs me and I want it to be known, I use the tools at my disposal to amplify them. So with 13th I was learning about mass criminalisation in the prison industrial complex and felt there was no real understanding of the political, cultural and social structures around incarceration. Same with Caste. We shot this film in 37 days on three continents. It spans seven time periods, across 400 years. And it doesn’t matter where in the world you are, or what time period it is. We put certain people above other people based on a set of random traits. It doesn’t have to be that way. But in order to untangle it, you have to be able to identify it and define it.\n\nDid you have a deadline in mind – with it being election year in the US?\n\nThe election year was a big part of my thinking. Both elections in the United States but also internationally. There are 64 countries having an election this year – that represents almost half the global population. So there are a lot of decisions being made. The hope is that a contemplation of Caste might get people thinking about these things in ways we need right now.\n\nWhat do you see as the power of film to change thinking?\n\nEverything is a story. Whether it is what we tell each other about our society, our politics, our faiths, our place in the world, it’s all about stories. If you change stories, challenge stories, amplify certain stories, you can shift the way we think about ourselves and one another. That’s why movies are such a huge tool for narrative change. And narrative change can change the world.\n\n‘Activism and organising is kinda sexy!’: Colman Domingo on Rustin, Oscar buzz and the Obamas\n\nJodie Comer: ‘I really want women to see themselves depicted in a truthful light’\n\nTV historian David Olusoga: ‘My family were driven from our home by the National Front’\n\nOlivia Colman and Jessie Buckley: ‘Why the hell are we still judging someone on how they look?’\n\nWhat films have changed the way you view the world?\n\nThere are so many examples that have shifted the cultural zeitgeist. But a film called Sankofa by the Ethiopian filmmaker Haile Gerima completely up-ended what I had been taught in school about slavery, which was minimal and one-sided towards the dominant culture. So it allowed me to examine slavery as an experience of people who were enslaved and who resisted.\n\nDo you see a thread through your work?\n\nIt’s a hard thing to do to make a film the way we make them, which is very all-consuming. So when the film is done, I want it to mean something and say something, I want it to stick to your ribs. And I want it to be the kind of film you think about after you’ve left the theatre. That doesn’t need to be a large historical or anthropological thesis, but is has to have meaning for me as the artist. So if that takes the form of a Disney movie like A Wrinkle In Time, a limited series, like When They See Us or a documentary like 13th, I stay open to where inspiration strikes.\n\nWere there people whose work inspired you to take the leap into filmmaking?\n\nThere were filmmakers I respected. But it’s hard to say I want that person’s career when there’s no one doing it that looks like you. A black woman director with a thriving career who was able to choose projects she was compelled by and make those projects consistently at a certain level did not exist. Were there women who made films? Yes. But was there anyone with the career of a Sidney Lumet or a Mike Nichols or a Spielberg, Coppola or Lucas? No. There are incredible women who have made incredible films periodically but were unable to have the access and opportunity to make films consistently. That’s a new part of our history as African-American filmmakers. And something I hope other people can look up to and be inspired by.\n\nAre you working with this next generation of filmmakers too?\n\nI am. But I look at my counterparts making films who don’t have to have those concerns. Mr Nolan, Mr Villeneuve, Mr Chazelle – they don’t get that question. Because it is assumed that they don’t, or don’t need to. It’s not anything they have to speak to or have the additional labour of performing. But my answer is yes!\n\nOrigin is in cinemas now\n\nThis article is taken from The Big Issue magazine, which exists to give homeless, long-term unemployed and marginalised people the opportunity to earn an income.
