        "text": "The “tale as old as time” is one we know well thanks to the kingdom of Walt. And if you grew up with a video home system—what was once called VHS—you can pretty much recite the whole thing verbatim (“Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!”). The plot, the characters, the rhythms of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” are so ingrained in us, the answer to “More beer?” (“What for? Nothing helps”) is a foregone conclusion. So why spend the money to see a musical you already know by heart?\n\nCortland Repertory Theatre’s production of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” is a case study of why live theater beguiles, enchants, and delights like no other form of entertainment. It’s the movie one better, because when you breathe the same air as the characters—whom you know and love and who deliver exactly what you expect—it is deeply comforting, reassuring, and satisfying in a way few things are once you become an adult. Live theater recreates a magic we knew intimately as kids but have almost forgotten as adults."
