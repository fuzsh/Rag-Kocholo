        "text": "John Hughes (born February 18, 1950, Lansing, Michigan, U.S.—died August 6, 2009, New York, New York) was an American film director, writer, and producer who in the 1980s established the modern American teen movie as a genre. Hughes successfully portrayed the reality of adolescent life while maintaining a funny and lighthearted tone.\n\nAs a teen, Hughes moved with his family to Chicago, the city whose environs would later serve as the setting for many of his films. He attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, left before graduating, and returned to Chicago to work as an advertising copywriter. He began his comedy career writing jokes for stand-up comedians such as Rodney Dangerfield. His film career was launched when he began writing screenplays for movies produced by National Lampoon magazine.\n\nAfter finding success as a screenwriter for Class Reunion (1982), National Lampoon’s Vacation (1983), and other comedies, Hughes wrote, directed, and sometimes produced the string of teen-oriented films that would make him famous; he founded his own production company in 1985. Sixteen Candles (1984), followed by The Breakfast Club (1985) and Pretty in Pink (1986), made stars out of a group of young actors—Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson, among them—who collectively became known as the Brat Pack. (This name was a play on the Rat Pack, a close-knit group of celebrities of an earlier era that included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr.)\n\n(Discover “12 Essential Brat Pack Flicks.”)\n\nHughes also found success with Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986), a movie famous for the lead character’s “breaking of the fourth wall,” looking straight into the camera and talking directly to the viewer, and a film he wrote, directed, and produced. Starring Matthew Broderick as a boisterous hooky-playing high-schooler, the film typified the “us versus them” mentality of Hughes’s most beloved films. Hughes collaborated with the well-established comedians John Candy and Steve Martin in Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (1987); Candy later appeared in the Hughes-penned Uncle Buck (1989)."
