Mr. Kamen even assures us that, so far from being dropped, there is a distinct probability that Mickey will soon be produced in all the glory of colour. Personally, I was sceptical of reports that Disney contemplated a quiet burial of the world's most famous cartoon character in order to concentrate on the more ambitious \"Silly Symphonies.\" The Richest Rodent Apart from the fact that I cannot believe that Disney feels he has exhausted Mickey's possibilities, the little fellow is too valuable commercially. Its creator at present is stated to derive more revenue from royalties on Mickey Mouse' novelties than he has done from the films themselves. Nevertheless, the future of Mickey has been causing me some anxiety of late. A Temporary Lapse ? My own observations and the presence of an increasing number of complaints in the Picturegoer letter bag point to the conclusion that not only is the scintillating brilliance of recent \"Symphonies\" overshadowing the mouse star, but that the latter cartoons are definitely falling off in quality. That, of course, may be a temporary lapse due to the fact that the cartoonist has been in the throes of experimenting with and perfecting the exploitation of the new three-colour process. One hopes so rather than that it has been decided as a definite matter of policy that Mickey be entirely subordinated to his more spectacular stable-mate. Mr. Disney's greatest danger at the moment is being adopted by the highbrows who a few years ago invested Mickey with Freudian complexes and inhibitions and are, now that they have found a new love, clamouring for his extinction along with his \"bourgeois barnyard\" companions. Room for Both Very few screen artistes have survived the acclaim of the self-appointed intelligentsia. Mr. Disney, I hope, will not take their flattery as seriously as they take themselves. There is surely room, indeed almost a need, Bright and Joan Marion, who appear in ''Take a I Chance.\" 137 (New Series). Vol. 3. January 6, 1934 Editorial Offices: 93 Long Acre, W.C.2.

ON SALE EVERY THURSDAY, 2d. on the screen for both the Silly Symphony in the form in which it is now developing and the roystering, rowdy, vastly amusing Mickey Mouse we knew until recently. I have already paid my tribute to the artistic brilliance of the new colour films, but in spite of the fact that one of our more learned critics has pronounced them the greatest pictures ever made, they are by no means above criticism from the point of view of the average film fan. No \" Belly Laughs \" ' I 'he coming of colour has changed the form of JL Disney's creations. One detects in most of the new \"Symphonies\" a temptation — probably due to the immaturity of the new medium — to paint \"pretty\" pictures, to tickle the palate rather than amuse, to give us a quietly and innocuously pleasant charm rather than hearty entertainment and a happy smile instead of the old \"belly laugh.\" And I am not at all certain that with all the modern improvements we are getting a fair exchange for the grandly rowdy irresponsibility of the Mickey Mouse cartoon of nights gone by. Sufficiently uncertain, at any rate, to hope that Mr. Disney will accept our solution of the problem by providing us with both. Two Guineas for Ideas We have a fascinating new two-guinea compe- tition for you this week. The Picturegoer Weekly has, through its various departments, developed an unrivalled service of screen news, views and reviews for the fans, but we are not satisfied to rest there. In accordance with our policy of giving the film public what it wants, we ask you to make your own suggestions as to what you want to read in your Picturegoer. What new features would you most like to see ? Have you any suggestions for extending the scope of existing ones ? Picturegoer will award a prize of two guineas for what in the opinion of the Editor is the best letter on the subject received. There will also be several smaller prizes. Letters should not exceed 150 words and should be addressed to \"Suggestions,\" Picturegoer, 93, Long Acre, W.C.2. Ramon Novarro must be nearly the last of the species, although among the Reno widowers, Bill Powell, Richard Dix and one or two others are footloose and fancy-free at the moment. In the meanwhile, Gary Cooper has received a gift from Charles Laughton that has kept him busy trying to think up the answer. The other day the postman arrived with a large box bearing a British stamp. On opening it, Gary found an elegant bust of himself and this note : \" I found this while strolling along Piccadilly Circus. I think it's revolting. Love, Charlie.\" Les Miserables \" Again Gary*s Marriage The marriage of Gary Cooper to Sandra Shaw will make life a little easier for the film gossip writers. It also removes from Hollywood's happy hunting grounds one of the few remaining eligible screen bachelors. One of the most interesting production announcements of the week is the news that Twentieth Century is to tackle the Victor Hugo classic, Les Miserables, as a starring vehicle for Fredric March, one of the studio's most recent acquisitions. March is scheduled for the Jean Valjean role. Physically, he is not, I am afraid, the popular conception of the character, and only an out- standingly good performance on his part will convince me that it is good casting. March on the screen usually gives an impression of sensitive intellectuality rather than the rugged brute strength one associates with the Hugo hero. Pre-talkie picturegoers will recall the version produced some years ago by one of the French studios. It was one of the classics of its day. Pauline Frederick M Broke \" While the Roosevelt salary axe hangs over the heads of the movie Midases, the news arrives that Pauline Frederick is \"broke.\" Miss Frederick, once one of the biggest salaried players on the screen, occupied in her heydey the throne on which Garbo now sits. When she made pictures here in the early days of talkies she was \"the highest paid star ever to have worked in British films.\" Now she is reported to be unable to meet debts of £645. Recently she has been playing in stock. I don't think it is generally remembered that Pauline started one of the feminine beauty fashions that changed the faces of the world's women — plucked eyebrows. Few Film Fortunes Some of the big stars of other days — and days not so very far away — have managed to hold on to their money, but you could count the great movie fortunes on your fingers to-day. {Continued on page 6) PICTUREGOER Weekly January 6, 1934 (Continued from page 5) Chaplin, Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Marion Davies, Thomas Meighan, Colman, Garbo and one or two others will never find themselves in the position of Miss Frederick. But in the cases of most of the others who once earned thousands a week, the money has vanished as quickly and as easily as it came. Conrad Nagel and Lewis Stone, two players who have never been in the really big money but who have carefully avoided the extravagances associated with film fame, are among Hollywood's wealthiest citizens. Perhaps their case affords an explanation of why stars \"go broke.\" Stories v. Stars The latest studio to put its hand on its heart and make that annual resolution about concentrating on stories rather than stars is Columbia. Such pronouncements are usually received with polite scepticism and quietly forgotten by every- one concerned. However, the company whose fortunes are guided by Mr. Harry Cohn, one of the three cleverest producers in the business, has always maintained a policy of good story value in its productions, and has never overdone star exploita- tion. The present proposal, therefore, must be regarded as possessing some significance, particu- larly as Ray Long, one of America's most success- ful editors, has been installed as chief of the scenario department with complete supervision over the selection and preparation of stories. Elissa Landi's Future One interesting development is the possibility that Elissa Landi may appear in the leading role of a filmisation of her latest novel, as yet unpublished. Ancestor. Those of us who have seen most of the films producers have given Miss Landi will sympathise with her belief in the theory that if you want a thing well done do it yourself. The progress at Columbia of Miss Landi, one of the players who, despite a promising start, just missed greatness, is being watched with interest by the film world. The studio has a reputation for investing stars with a new lease of life. The film city had largely lost interest in Barbara Stanwyck when Columbia put her in Forbidden. The recent Lady for a Day elevated May Robson, who had been playing small parts for years, to the front rank of screen names. The company also brought Lee Tracy to success when that actor quarrelled with Warners. The Girl on the Cover. , Britain's Latest Hollywood Import / HE film career of Britain's latest ^fC\\ Hollywood importation is a Cinderella story that has not yet contrived to catch up with the happy ending. It really started when she was seventeen and almost unknown in the studios and John Barrymore chose her from sixty candidates to be his \"Trilby\" in Svengali because she looked like Dolores Costello (Mrs. Barrymore). She gavt an excellent account of herself in that and subsequent offerings like The Mad Genius, The Road to Singapore and Five Star Final. Her progress since, however, has been checked by two handicaps. The one was ill health in the last year or two and the other that she was rushed into stardom in Under Eighteen before she or the public was ready for it. Marion was born on British soil — in Trinidad— but was taken to America, when she was ten. She attended the famous Hollywood High School, which has produced several famous stars, and got into pictures via the extra route. She had risen to a small contract by the time Barrymore discovered her. Miss Marsh is now at work on her first British picture. Love at Second Sight — a comedy romance with music. Her real name is Violet Kranth. Her mother has accompanied her on her present trip. filmy garment that will serve to satisfy those who object to nudity.\" The Sex Cycle A few weeks ago I predicted that 1934 would be a more sexy screen year. I was rather interested, therefore, to note that my views have been confirmed by Jay Brien Chapman, a well- known Hollywood film writer in the current American Screen Book. Mr. Chapman also advances the same reasons : the Mae West influence and the growth of the nudist vogue in the States. \"Producers must make at least part of their forthcoming pictures hotter than ever,\" he writes, \"or quit and close up shop. And stars — the ladies particularly — from Mae West all the way to Greta Garbo are entered into a vamping compe- tition they can't stop. \"The one who cools off, or fails to raise her rival's latest ante simply loses her place in films.\" Profitable \" Nudies Some of the critics are rather fond of telling us how they discovered Jean Harlow's acting ^nm'pt ^orioc ability in Dinner at Eight. Mr. Cohn and one or two other people, including The Picturegoer, discovered it a long time ago when he rescued her from the fate of being a one-picture actress after she was \"all washed up\" at United Artists. It was her work in Platinum Blonde and other Columbia offerings that attracted the attention of the Metro moguls. The American public, he adds, is forcing producers, against their will and judgment, to put out warmer stories, plots, situations, songs and dialogue. The writer goes on to point out, as I did, that there are hundreds of nudist colonies now in existence in the States and that nudist pictures shown in 1933 \"cleaned up at the box-office.\" He advances the further interesting theory that the recently completed recognition of Soviet Russia will be another major contributory factor in the loosening of movie moral standards. Hollywood evidently believes that the Soviet's 600,000,000 movie fans must be wooed with films which get away from \"old-fashioned\" custom so far as sex is concerned. Joan's ** Strip Dance M Well, Joan Crawford does her \"strip\" dance in Dancing Lady. Or, rather, she starts to do it. The producers have tactfully got over the difficulties of presenting the number by introducing a police raid on the theatre before the proceedings have got very far. In the meanwhile the latest news from the Bolero lot, where Sally Rand is doing her fan waving, is that the actress \"wears a very Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young are teamed in\" A Man's Castle.\" One definite result of the new friendly political relationship between America and Russia will be a cycle of films dealing with life in the Soviet. One of the first and most important is Red Square, now in production under the direction of Lewis Milestone, who told me something of his plans for the picture when he passed through London on his return from Russia, where he shot considerable footage for the film, a few weeks back. Over at Metro they have again got Soviet — a story they have had for some years and which has been announced at intervals as a starring vehicle for players on the pay role as widely divergent as Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow — down from the shelves. Authentic Picture Mr. Milestone, a Russian himself, is enthusiastic about Red Square, which is based on a novel called The Life and Death of Nicholas Courlov, by a prominent young Russian novelist named Ilya Ehrenbourg. The story, the director states, is a dramatic, sympathetic, but not idealised tale of an O.G.P.U. agent in the hectic days when counter-revolution and foreign intervention made this sinister body so vital to the existence of the U.S.S.R. The producers, I understand, have been given considerable assistance by the Soviet authorities. Laurence Stallings, of What Price Glory ? fame, who is doing the adaptation, also spent many weeks in Russia studying conditions. These factors and the records of Milestone and Stallings make one hopeful that at last the screen will be able to give us a reasonably authentic picture of the world's greatest social experiment. De Mille Disappointed ? Hitherto, Hollywood's attempts to portray Soviet Russia have been notable chiefly for some of the worst films ever screened. I still have painful memories of The World and the Flesh, in which Mr. George Bancroft (now happily restored to the screen, after two years' absence, in Blood Money) did his heaviest he-man act in the role of a Bolshevist sailor. Douglas Fairbanks, jun., and Nancy Carroll did Scarlet Dawn, which did not even have the merit of good melodrama. The Old Master, Mr. Cecil B. De Mille, who weighed in with Forgotten Commandments, reversed January 6, 1934 the Milestone process by making his film first and then going there to see if the Muscovites were living up to his film ideals. He was, according to unkind critics, terribly disappointed. New Dix in Pictures Jack Oakie started something when he persuaded Paramount to let his mother play the role of his screen mother in Too Much Harmony. Since then Dietrich's little daughter Maria has been launched on a film career to play the part of Marlene's child in her new \"Catherine the Great\" picture. And now it is announced that Mary Ellen, Richard Dix's little daughter, is to make her screen debut with her father in his next vehicle. Mary Ellen is about the same age as Baby LeRoy. Another newcomer with a famous name I am looking forward to seeing shortly— in Trigger— is \"Nan Sutherland,\" better known as Mrs. Walter Huston. When Mae West was Rejected Mention of the name of Mae West causes a painful jar in the executive offices of the Burbank and Movietone studios. It appears now that a little whde ago the services of the actress who has become the greatest monev spinner in pictures were hawked round Hottywrlbd and nobody would look at her. Charles Walsh, brother of Raoul Walsh, the well-known director, was so impressed by Miss West on the Broadway stage that at his own j& expense he made a screen test of her. With his can of film under his arm he toured the studios. Fox, where brother Raoul was then working, did not even bother to see the \"test\" run through. Warners consented to look at it but that was the last he heard. Eventually he \"sold\" her to Paramount for that supporting role in Night After Night. Gloria's Come-back Gloria Swanson, I am glad to note, is not making the mistake of many former feminine stars in her new come-back attempt. Most of them can never forget that they were once ingenues. The Motion Picture Relief Fund is at the moment support- ing at least one well-known actress because she will not accept offers of mature roles. Miss Swanson, however, is to play the role of a mature motion-picture actress in her new film Twentieth Century. Gloria, of course, is by no means old except in the sense that she has been on the screen for many years. The proposal for her to appear in a biographical film of Bernhardt appears to be hanging fire, but it has already inspired the wisecrack that Sarah Bernhardt acting the real story of Swanson's life would be rather more interesting than Gloria in the life of Sarah. Short Shots Ida Lupino is now being described as a new rival to Jean Harlow — Mae West's fan mail, which has leapt in a few months to 2,500 letters a week, is now claimed to be the heaviest in Hollywood — Lewis Stone has bought a 105-ft. schooner — Schnozzle Durante has patented his name— Marie Dressier has just turned down a ^40,000 offer for thirteen radio broadcasts — Charles Farrell has found a new screen sweetheart in The Big Shake- dotvn in Bette Davis — Mrs. Borritt, the much- discussed woman announcer, is to appear as compere in a series of shqrts about B.B.C. personalities — The latest report on the Chaplin- Paulette Goddard romance is that they are to be married in England in June — Garbo is house- hunting because her address was made public in recent court proceedings in which a gate-crasher was charged— Gene Raymond composed the music of the new song hit, \" Brief Moment.\" A New \" Henry \" Book The Alexander Korda film has created more interest in the character of Henry the Eighth than all the historians have been able to conjure up in the last three centuries. Some further revealing sidelights on the personality of the much-married monarch are provided by \"The Love Letters of Henry the Eighth,\" a new book edited by Ladbroke Black and published by the Blandford Press at 2s. M. It is dedicated to Charles Laughton — surely the first film star to be honoured in this way. Kinema Couplets This week's half-guinea prize is awarded to James A. Joslin, of 30, Gilbey Road, Tooting, S.W.i 7, for:— The Fire Raisers Tell England Half-crown prizes are awarded to : — Mr. A.

Garrett, 18, Graham Road, Hackney, E., for : — The Miracle Man He Learned About Women D. Nicholson, 7x5 Avenue, Blyth, North, for : — Broadminded The Good Bad Girl Elissa Landi and Paul Lukas in a scene from their new film, \"By Candlelight.\" Hard Hit British Stars British stars in Hollywood are, I hear, being hit by the current rates of exchange. Diana Wynyard who sends money home to England is one of the chief sufferers. Lilian Harvey also invests her savings here, and is finding that under present conditions her salary is two-fifths less than it was a year ago. There is even a possibility that unless the exchange rates improve Lilian may pack up and go back to Germany. Some of the Continental stars are even more badly off. Greta Garbo, as is well known, sends every cent home to Sweden. A year ago she could buy 100 Swedish cronen for 23 American dollars. Now they cost her something like 29 dollars. Talent \"Drought\" The dearth of new screen talent is causing furrowed brows and greying heads among the movie moguls. There seems to be little doubt that the talkies have shortened the screen lives of the stars, and PICTUREGOER Weekly now with all the usual sources temporarily exhausted the shortage is assuming serious proportions. Major producers, it is learned, are strengthening their \"scout\" forces and have issued orders to \"dig deeper than ever for possible bets.\" The next few months will see an intensive comb out for entertainers in radio, night clubs, vaudeville and amateur dramatic societies. Beery as Barnum It is now settled that Wallace Beery is to play the role of Barnum in the Twentieth Century picture of the great showman's life. The studio has something of a weakness for Wallace. 'It \"borrowed\" him from M.-G.-M. a little while ago to star in The Bowery and, inci- dentally, gave him the best part he has bad for months. Beery will not find characterising the ballyhoo king a new experience. He played Barnum with great gusto a few years ago in support of Grace Moore when the singing star did Jenny Lind. \" Mauve \" Movie Cycle The success of Little Women seems certain to let loose the inevitable avalanche of similar subjects, and for the next few months the screens will be flooded with tender * sentiment. All the scenario chiefs are busy brushing the dust off the best-sellers of the \"mauve decade.\" Both Radio, which sponsored Little Women, and Metro are reading Little Men and Jo's Boys by the same author. Over at Fox they are talking of Anne of Green Gables as the next Janet Gaynor vehicle, while another possibility, also for Janet, one imagines is Pollyanna, in which Mary Pickford charmed us back in 1920. Will Rogers is already busy on David Harum. Shock for Society Beauties The exclusive society circles of Rio de Janeiro have a shock coming to them, when Radio's musical extravaganza Flying Down to Rio reaches Brazil. For the exterior scenes of this picture, Roy Hunt, one of Radio's crack cameramen, was sent to Rio de Janeiro. With the co-operation of the pro- prietors he arranged to film the cream of Rio de Janeiro society as they lounged and bathed on the beaches and terraces of the exclusive Hotel Copacabana. Three naval aeroplanes were stunting over- head and Roy Hunt filmed the upturned faces as they watched. In tie completed film, however, the crowd will be shown watching the arrival by air, of Fred Astaire and his dancing girls called in the film \"The Yankee Clippers.\" But they were not aware of that when they so condescendingly allowed themselves to be filmed ! This Week's Great Thoughts The doctors have told me that my particular brand of singing is due to a little unobtrusive growth between my vocal cords. — Bing Crosby. I love Johnny Weismuller because he is the only real, natural man in this town of Hollywood. — Lupe Velez. After I make my first Hollywood picture then I will talk. — Anna Sten. Although I have been in the headlines more than any other star I actually live a more unex- citing life than any of them.— -Clara Bow.

PICTUREGOER\" presents the first English film interview with the great German actress whose genius is now the talk of London's theatre land. Two interesting studies of Elizabeth Bergner, who makes her British talkie debut in \" Catherine the Great.\" ✓SUDDENLY she stood before /\"^j me, out there X— y in the spacious studio at Elstree. The \"great\" little Elizabeth Berg- ner. It was while she was completing her first British picture, Catherine the Great, and she had only a very few minutes to spare for her talk with me as she was deep in her work. And, of course, everybody knows what that means for a film actress; concentration, excitement, nervous tension and, in addition, living oneself into one's part. \"Come along quickly,\" she whispered to me as she seized me by the hand ana led me aside. I followed her, in her wonderful blue brocaded robes and her charming white perruque, into a corner of the studio. \" I am so very, very happy, you know, to be able to act here in England,\" she enthused. \"Do you know, I had offers from all the chief countries; I could have gone to Hollywood, and in Vienna, too, I might have acted. . . .\" At the word \"acted\" she broke off. It is now, of course, history that she has scored a big success on the stage in Escape Me Never, the play that Margaret Kennedy wrote especially for her. Miss Bergner continued: — \"You would hardly believe what a fever for work possesses me and how excited I am to see whether I shall really be able to win over the British public. \"But please,\" continued little Elizabeth, almost in tears, \"please don't talk to me about politics. Unfortunately, I have suffered too much through them during the ■ last few weeks, and now I must concentrate entirely ' on my work.\" Yes, it is true. Politics in Germany have, in the last few months, dealt very hardly with Elizabeth Berg- ner. She is a Jewess and, as is well known, Hen- Hitler no longer has any use for Jewesses, however valuable their services to Germany. I can recall how, for many years, the Berlin play-going public, spoiled though it was through seeing the greatest actresses and film stars in the world, was at the feet of Elizabeth Bergner. She drew tremendous crowds to the theatres and aroused the enthusiasm of men and women of all ages among the art-loving popu- 91 lation of the capital. f She made Shaw's Saint ■ Joan, a huge box-office suc- ■ cess, and through her Shaw I secured a place among those A L J authors whose plays are m.- most often produced on the ■SI German stage. All Germany flocked to the kinemas to see her films, of which A riane and Dream- ing Lips are reckoned among the consummate achievements of German filmcraft. She made all her pictures under the direction of her husband, Paul Czinner, himself one of the leading producers in the German film industry and who is also directing Catherine the Great. From the little, lovable, clinging young woman of Dreaming Lips — and through her great suc- cess in this she will be best remembered by the London film-going public — she has in her latest film suddenly grown into a dominating ruler, ener- getic, greedy for power, driven by the wild scourge of passion. She plays the great Russian Czarina, Catherine. Elizabeth Bergner told me that she had become so wrapped up in her part that it sometimes seemed to her quite comic that she should have to speak in English. \" Russian,\" she said with a little laugh, \" Russian is what I ought to speak. But f have to struggle a little with my English,\" she went on, \"though what one learns in childhood is not easily forgotten. \" You see, we had an English governess at home, and what she taught me comes back now and helps me. I had to wait a comparatively short time before I was able to start working in English. \"But every day I had an English lesson and even now I still continually have my lines heard, so as to perfect my English. At the same time I have to work at my part and to rehearse and discuss how we shall work it out with my partner and with my husband. Yes, yes, it's a hard life — but marvellous I \" Iasked Elizabeth Bergner about her plans for the future, but at this stage she could not tell me anything about them. \"It's hard to say,\" she told me. \"And, as I have said, it depends very much on what success I have here in London. \"But now you must let me get back to my work; I still have rehearsals to-day, until late in the evening.\" And just like a Utile schoolgirl, with a look of real regret in her eyes, shyly and not at all like a prima donna, she gave me her hand. \"Good-bye,\" she said, \"Auf Wiedersehen I \" And rustling in her magnificent court robes she moved away. But, fascinated, I followed her, and I will let you into the secret of what I saw. Just like a little schoolgirl, prim and demure, Elizabeth Bergner sat down on a hard little stool that happened to be there in the studio. An elderly lady came up to her and Elizabeth Bergner began to go over her part. Over and over again. Obviously the lady was her English teacher. And the expression in Elizabeth Bergner's eyes was really quite pathetic when she had to go over her words again because her strict teacher had found some fault or other with her diction. But both these women were as if in a different world ; they were blind to the rehearsals and shots that were in progress all round them, they were deaf to the shrill signals and the shouting of the technicians. The two women just sat there and went on with the English lesson. Elizabeth Bergner was regarded as one of the cleverest actresses in Germany; and who can doubt that she will also succeed in making a conquest of the British public ? She has already made the first step through her performance in Dreaming Lips, with which she charmed London's film devotees. Catherine the Great may establish it. One of Germany's most illustrious novelists, inspired by her artistry, made her the central figure of one of his most beautiful books. In London a famous authoress has written a play especially for her. The tradition of admira- tion, interrupted for a brief space by the machinations of politicians, has been re-estab- lished. C. B. Cochran has called the German artiste 'the greatest actress in the world,\" and perhaps Elizabeth Bergner's art proves more conclusively than • anything else that art knows no national boundaries. — P. Wit.

The old cry of \"prosperity is just around the corner \" had developed into the proverbial cry of \"Wolf,\" but just as that call eventually proved true— in a somewhat disastrous manner — so is the former slogan proving true but with this difference, that people are ready to heed it and support it. Last year saw the finest prestige picture that has been turned out of a British studio. The Private Life of Henry VIII. It bas caused comment throughout the film world and it looks as though it is going to be followed up. Again, Rome Express, which was released this year, and Channel Crossing show that our studios have nothing to learn in the matter of ingenuity of setting and imaginative camera work from the other side. But more important even than these isolated examples is the fact that the technique of British pictures as a whole has improved immeasurably. I omit some of those quota \"quickies \" which are still something of a blot on production over here. And talking of quotas reminds me that exhibitors as a whole have far surpassed the required legal percentage. People are definitely going to see British pictures because they like them. There was a time not so very long ago when the reverse was the case. Patrons stayed away if a British picture was billed. All that is changed now, and while there is certainly still room for improvement — especially in story values — our product is progressing and becomes a competitive force with which to be reckoned. Below, the production chiefs of two of our biggest studios detail their 1934 plans for you. They are ambitious and far-reaching in effect. There is a wide diversity of subjects, and several are planned on a big scale which augurs well for the future. My own impressions concerning the vital needs of British pictures generally are that more attention must be paid to story construction. Technical qualities, settings and camera work are now on a well-establishe.; standard, but story values and continuity are still apt to be weak. We concentrate too much on comedies or drawing-room dramas. More vital themes are needed, stronger drama, and plots with a topical flavour. The English countryside and towns still need to be put on the map. Picturegoers are more familiar with the skyscrapers of New York or Chicago than they are with the time-mellowed buildings of London or the spires of a cathedral town. They have lived, pictorially, more in the vast prairies of the West than in the soft pastures of the west country. These things will, I feel sure, come in time; filmgoers have been asking for them long enough 10 to have their wishes acceded to. Gaumont-British are launching forth on a large scale. They are^j varying their topics very considerably, ^ and judging by the titles in the list of subjects presented by Michael Balcon, there is going to be something to ^ suit all tastes. They are beginning to line up stars and ^ exploit them fully. One of the biggest assets ^ in American studios has been the way the execu- tives have seen to it that stellar names count Maybe one day we shall be able to dispense with such adventitious aids to box ofl&ce success but, at the moment, there can be 110 doubt that names \" count very considerably. If the stellar vehicle is not worthy of the star who appears in it, I agree that he or she may prove ineffective, but given all things equal all round stellar prestige plus production value is better than production value on its own. It is merely a question of human nature. You create interest in some personality and we picturegoers are going to see that personality quite apart from the other merits of the enter- tainment offered. Tf we are disappointed we shall feel a little put -i- out, but we shall probably go again to see if the defect has been remedied in the star's next vehicle. If it is not, our depression, like the B.B.C. weather reports, will probably deepen, but we shali go a third time — just to see what it is all about. After that, the star, so far as his or her name is concerned, is finished — that is if we are once again let down. That is when the star system is working. If, on the other hand, we go to see a picture with players whose personalities have not been strongly brought to our notice, we see that picture and then if it is bad, we decide that we do not want to see the people participating in it again. A case of once bitten, twice shy, and no love for anyone concerned to make us wish to go again and see if we shall be caressed instead of bitten. This is all rather by the way, but I have felt very strongly that the creation of some personal contact through the publicity department is one of the things that is sadly lacking in British films generally. It is, I think, going to be altered. There is a distinct tendency to introduce us film fans to the people who work in our studios and make us conscious of their personalities ; make us feel for them and like them quite apart from their histrionic ability. And do not misunderstand me. If that ability is not there we shall not like them very long ; that has been proved in dozens of cases from the other side. We may feel sympathy with their rocket- stick downfall, but we just do not go to see them. It is ability that counts all the time; but ability plus personality is better. London Films are introducing into their organisation several names which will draw us to see their productions. Apart from those mentioned in Alexander Korda's article there are, I believe. Rend Clair, the most successful of talkie musical directors Milestone, the famous sponsor of All Quiet on the Western Front, and Lubitsch, whose Chevalier pictures have evoked world-wide enthusiasm just as his brilliant silents led the way in technique and imagination. These are directorial stellar names, and they have won their place in the front ranks by results. Fans would do well to follow the directors of films rather than the stars in many cases, and these three provide a A'ery good example of the reason why. Meanwhile the accompanying programmes and aspirations as set forth by Michael Balcon and Alexander Korda make one feel that we are in for an entertaining and prosperous film New Year. — L. C. What London Films Are Doing — by Alexander Korda ATy chief aim and hope in 1934 is to continue to produce films of the quality or, if possible better than Henry VIII and The Rise of Catherine the Great, which will further the prestige of the British film industry in foreign markets. London Films has an extremely ambitious programme, and will produce six films of world- wide importance this year. The first will be Exit Don Juan, directed by myself, and will star Douglas Fairbanks in a very original story by Lajos Biro and Arthur Wimperis. A brilliant cast will support Mr. Fairbanks and will include four young star girls under contract to London Films. Following this, Douglas Fairbanks and his son will appear together for the first time in one film entitled \"Z,\" based on the popular romantic screen figure, \"Zorro,\" created in silents by the former. This will be made on a large scale and will have certain exterior scenes made in Spain. This Year looks like a bumper year for British studios. Below we publish \"with an introduc tion \" the aspirations and pro duction plans of our two largest studios, written by Alexander Korda and Michael Balcon Alexander Korda, the presiding genius of London Film Pro- ductions. Walter Forde, one of our most versatile and talented direc- tors, who can also act with the best of our screen comedians. It is intended to produce something really outstanding. Maurice Chevalier, who will make six pictures during the next three years, will appear in three of them for London Film Productions, and at least one Maurice Chevalier super picture will be produced in the 1934 programme. Charles Laughton will make five pictures exclusively in this country for us during the next three years, and one or two super pictures starring him will be put into production in 1934. Other prominent actors of world-wide reputation will also be seen in our pictures. Doug. Fairbanks, jun., as Peter III in \" Katharine the Great,\" in which he appears with the great German artist, Elizabeth Bergner My brother, Zoltan Korda, will direct Kongo Raid, which will contain magnificent African sequences, and it is hoped that it will be one of the most sensational films of this year. This film is based on the late Edgar Wallace's famous character, Sanders of the River. H. G. Wells, undoubtedly England's greatest imaginative author, is writing a screen story specially for us which is based on his book, The Shape of Things to Come and other of his works. This film will deal with the world in the future, and will be a complete departure in technique from previous British productions. It will be planned on a big scale. I am not interested in producing a large programme each year. I want to make only a few films each year, but those will be of world-wide importance and cost not less than ^50,000 each. What Gaumont-British is Doing — by Michael Balcon The year 1933 for Gaumont-British and Gainsborough marked a stage of progress and consolidation in that progress. The next and inevitable development from this position must be tov/ards a wider field, both of output and of interest, and our keynote in 1934 wiU \"expansion.\" Douglas Fairbanks, sen., whose initial appearance in this country will be in \" Exit Don Juan.\" A glance at the programme we have scheduled for production will confirm this. During the forthcoming year our programme will include the following subjects : Chu Chin Chow, Brown on Resolution, Rhodes, Magnolia Street, Mary, Queen of Scots, My Old Dutch, Road ho use, Brave New World, Little Friend, A Cup of Kindness, A Bit of a Test, Covent Garden, The Camels Are Coming, and Soldiers Three. Here is every variety of topic. The ground covered includes subjects that deal with the Navy, the Army, with the Empire, musical spectacle, history and with life at home — both in the light of drama and comedy. Our object will be to make these pictures to appeal, not only over a wider range of interest, but also with an increased standard of entertain- ment within that interest. For the first time ar number of our directors will be going to various parts of the Empire to make pictures. Brown on Resolution will be made In Malta, and Walter Forde, on the completion of that picture, will go to India to make Soldiers Three. Victor Saville will be leaving for South Africa to make a film with Cecil Rhodes as its subject, while Robert J. Flaherty, who made Man of Aran actually in the Aran Islands, will be going to Australia. Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge have left for Egypt, to make their next picture, The Camels Are Coming, under the direction of Tim Whelan. These facts, in themselves, justify our claim that 1934 will be beyond everything a year of expansion for Gaumont-British and Gainsborough. The choice of subjects scheduled for production in the studios at home include an ambitious and spectacular version of the famous musical play, Chu Chin Chow, a film version of Roadhouse, more Tom Walls— Ralph Lynn comedies— including A Cup of Kindness and A Bit of a Test — and two sides of London life in My Old Dutch and Covent Garden. In Magnolia Street, from the famous novel by Louis Golding, there is a film with a particular appeal to the north of England. It has been our announced intention to make a picture of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, and this year will see the realisation of this. This, then, is our programme and while the immediate work in hand is in progress, the films which have been made in 1933 will be finding their way round the world and will be part of our progress in 1934. The progress in British films has been such that we can confidently look forward during 1934 *° an even greater consolidation of the position we now hold on the screens of the world.

She will probably make a personal appearance tour here and in Paris. It will be the first time she has crossed the Atlantic. Her busy, struggling life has left her little time for recreation. \"A good many persons who have known me oply since I have been acting for the screen seem to feel that success has come to me overnight,\" she told me wistfully one day; \"that it was a case of being touched by the magic wand of Hollywood and, presto — the whole world knew me. \"That's not true. \" I have had the hardest kind of a struggle all my Ufe. In fact, it is the literal truth that I have been working, hoping, planning and wishing for something like my present recog- nition ever since I was four and a half years old. \"That was the occasion of my debut as an actress. I have been acting, either in stock, vaudeville, musical comedy, or my own plays ever since. \"For how many years? Well — more than twenty.\" Mae is perfectly frank about her battle for fame. \" I've never gone hungry, walked the tracks when stranded, or had to do any of the picturesque things other Thespians have endured for their art,\" she confesses, \"but I have worked twenty hours a day, many times. \"I have rehearsed for twelve hours at a stretch, and then lain in bed for hours more repeating, improvising, even adding new lines and business. \"I have taken criticism from persons who sought to curb my originality and to repress my personality. \"I have sacrificed everything for a career, have passed up pleasure and good times, even travel, because I found myself on a fascinating merry-go- round and wanted to know where it would carry me. \"I believe in fate and destiny and things like that, but nothing has happened to me through accident. My whole life has been like an orderly, logical chain of events leading to the present. \"Even the new fashion vogue which the style magazines credit me with starting, after those Frenchmen saw She Done Him Wrong, was something I deliberately wished for, ever since, as A striking new study of Mae West, who in real life is a \"smaller, daintier woman than yon wotdd expect to meet.\" a small girl, I used to admire the lovely gowns worn by Lillian Russell. Those Gay 'Nineties gowns, emphasising the hour-glass waist, I wore in She Done Him Wrong were designed at my suggestion. \"Perhaps the most terrifying thing about fame, however, is the burden it imposes. One has to live up to it. I've found all my Ufe that one can't rest on past laurels.\" Nevertheless, Miss West can now spare a little time for relaxation. Her European trip, for instance. It will have to wait a little while, of course. She has her new picture, It Ain't No Sin, to complete, and after that she is due for a personal appearance tour of America. Recently the broadcast studios made her extremely tempting offers. One offered her £1,000 each for a series of thirteen fifteen-minute broadcasts. She has rejected all of them because it is her working creed to concentrate on whatever she is doing. She believes that you cannot do well two things at the same time. Mae West, although a charming and even fascinating companion, has never had her name linked with those of men — even in Hollywood, where, as everybody knows, the gossipers work overtime. There has, incidentally, never been the slightest suggestion against the conduct of her private life. But you only have to work with her to know how deep is her knowledge of masculine human nature. One reason for her detached attitude to men was her close attachment for her mother, . who died three years ago after a long illness. \"My mother never seemed to like any of the men I cared for,\" she says, \" and now I think she was right. I'd have probably been married and divorced a number of times if I hadn't listened to her. Then when I grew old enough to make up my own mind I took care of my mother.\" Mae West, however, has definite views about the type of man that makes the best husband, and it is not the \"sheik\" type, she declares. She has a preference for \"big masculine-looking men of the not-so-handsome type.\" \"Those guys,\" Mae adds, \"have more sex appeal. Besides, they're not so hard to keep.\" Mae West in real life is a smaller, daintier woman than you would expect to meet after seeing her on the screen. She is five feet four inches tall, and weighs 116 to 120 pounds. Her face is round and dimpled. She has a peaches-and-cream complexion, and beautiful teeth. She wears ankle-length dresses, and clothes which while being smart and up-to-the-minute are contrived to make the most of those famous Now let me tell you something about Mae West's future. Mae likes pictures and Hollywood very much indeed, and is flattered by the amazing success which has rewarded her efforts. She expects to continue in pictures indefinitely. She attributes her great vogue in part to the fact that talkie audiences have reached that point in their mental development where they are prepared to hear matters of sex, love and morals discussed in a frank but humorous manner. She herself believes in referring to a spade as a spade, and thinks that the public to-day appreciates this. Fame seems to have come overnight to Mae West, but, as a matter of fact, it has long been denied her. She has built on strong foundations, surely, and Hollywood expects her to continue her reign for many years to come, because she is the first movie \"queen of sex \" who also has been gifted with a sense of humour and real acting ability. *3 PICTUREGOER Weekly Let our Film Critics who really see the pictures guide you. DOUBT whether it is possible to (g film Lewis Carroll's two books at all — . m satisfactorily, and I am certain that K^r this melange of Alice Through the Looking Glass and Alice in Wonder- land put out under the latter title does not capture the spirit of clever nonsense which is inherent in both. It was once mooted that Walt Disney should do a cartoon version of Alice's adven- tures with a central human figure; this, I consider, would have been eminently fitting. Directly you attempt to bring Carroll's words and Tenniel's drawings into human shape with human artistes in heavy disguise and elaborate robes you ruin the whole illusion. And you cannot for one moment divorce Carroll from Tenniel any more than you can divorce Gilbert from Sullivan. This picture has the air of a hurried effort. It has certainly clever technical effects; the make- ups are ingenious but grotesque rather than familiarly ridiculous and worst of all Alice — and several of the long cast — speak with a devastating American accent which strikes a thoroughly incongruous note. Carroll's essays into the ridiculous are put over — or rather they try to put them over — as wise- cracks and they will not work that way. The sins of omission — a lot has necessarily had to be left out and the theme and continuity in each book has been completely lost — are as bad as the sins of commission, where the director has sought fit to elaborate or emphasise on the author's original work. It is definitely a 'question of \" Alice Where Art Thou ? \" and the answer is very assuredly and definitely — in Hollywood. As Alice, Charlotte Henry looks even if she does not speak the part; at times, indeed, when she is driven to the verge of tears she reminds one forcibly of Zasu Pitts. She wanders in a haphazard manner through the mixed adventures with the chess characters of \"The Looking Glass,\" the card character of \"Won- derland,\" and the various beasties which are encountered in both. I found that the director, Norman McLeod, had erred on the side of thel grotesque. His\" Duch- ess\"— played by Alison Skipworth — was not just hideous, but thoroughly repulsive. Tweedledee and Tweedledum played respectively by Roscoe Karns and Jack Oakie, were also more grotesque tl:. in funny. Incidentally the recital of the \"Walrus and the Carpenter \" was done in an indifferent cartoon ; but it was a straw in the wind that showed that it is as a cartoon that Carroll's works would best take a pictorial form. Neither the White Queen played by Louise Fazenda nor the Red, played by Edna May Oliver, seemed to approximate to childhood memories, while the Queen of Hearts of May Robson was a vague shadow of the original. Perhaps the best character of all was the White Knight, played by Gary Cooper — he fell off his horse so well. But even he seemed to lack the \"foolish gentieness\" the part required, and his accent was a distinct handicap. This same criticism applies to W. C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, while Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter and Charlie Ruggles as the March Hare overdid the fooling by being thoroughly conscious that they were meant to be mad. Altogether a not too happy an effort, hurried in effect, lacking in even the coherence of the ridiculous. Children may be pleased with it, but I think that any of those who are well acquainted with the book will be disappointed. — L. C. Kay Francis, with John Halliday, \" The House on $6th Street,\" which will be fully reviewed next week Dancing Lady lthough in nett sum and sub- stance Metro's ma j or contribution to the back-stage musical cycle amounts to little more than that story of the promoted chorus girl who scores a first night triumph and saves the show, served up with different music and ensembles and a new batch of wisecracks. Dancing Lady is so skilfully and luxuriously \"put over\" that it has excellent claims to be considered the best song and dance show of the current series. Indeed, only the absence of the really strong hit song numbers that were a feature of its dis- tinguished predecessor makes one cautious about predicting for it the popularity that Broadway Melody achieved five years ago. The plot, slight and familiar as it is, is — miracu- lously for this type of talkie — made reasonably credible and interesting by the polished direction of Robert Z. Leonard. In it we see Joan Crawford as Janie, a dancer in a cheap burlesque show, who, through the interest of Tod Newton (Franchot Tone), a wealthy society man, is given an oppor- tunity in the chorus of a Broadway show produced by Patch Gallagher (Clark Gable). The latter, though impressed by her dancing talent, tries to stifle any other interest in her. He promotes her to the \"top spot,\" but in order to take Janie, now torn between a career and a successful society marriage to him, on a respectably chaperoned trip to Havana. Newton has the financial support of the play withdrawn. However, Janie comes back in time to save the show and score a triumph, and, as we expected 14 January 6, 1934 all along, Great-Lover Gable gets his girl in the end. Joan Crawford, if still emaciated, exotically made up and inclined to be soulful at the slightest provocation, is much more at home in this type of thing than she has been in some of her recent more ambitious flights into serious drama, and she gives us the most apealing Crawford portrayal we have had for many movie moons. The role, of course, also provides her with an opportunity to demonstrate her not inconsiderable skill as a dancer, although the simple \" routines \" she performed for the most part might make the captious critic sceptical about Janie's claims to Broadway stardom. The best work in this depart- ment, as was only to be expected, comes from Fred Astaire, who contributes several excellent numbers. Most of the spectacle is reserved for the final reel, a logical and merciful device which prevents it getting entangled with and holding up the action. Moreover, it is some of the most strikingly and ingeniously effective \" spectacle \" I have seen. Clark Gable's performance in a role to which be was well suited, like the entire production, showed very few signs that it was interrupted by illness. Franchot Tone is engaging enough as the play-boy lover, although he appeared to be in doubt whether or not the character should be in a state of mild but permanent inebriation. May Robson, Winnie Lightner, Nelson Eddy (one of Culver City's \"musical \" white hopes) and Robert Benchley make the minor characters interesting. — M. D. P. The World Changes A film with Paul Muni and Aline MacMahon is always certain to have my patronage. It is also likely to make me super-critical because I cannot bear to see two such fine artistes in anything but good pictures. I will first relate the story of the film before telling you of my own reaction to it. Orin Nordholm and his wife Anna are two of those pioneers whose praises America — and rightly so — is never tired of singing. Their wagon is lumbering towards the West some time about 1854. Anna who is about to have a child, selects the spot on which they will pitch their tent — a magnificent piece of acting — and with the passing of time we see the log cabin and Orin II. A meeting with Buffalo Bill gives young Orin an ambition to blaze a trail of cattle driving and in little time he becomes partner in a big Chicago packing business and marries Virginia, his partner's daughter. We now arrive at the third generation. Virginia is a social climber and is ashamed of her husband's business, from which she insists on keeping their two sons. One becomes engaged to Jennifer Clinton, the daughter of an aristocratic family. To impress the Clintons, Virginia stupidly announces that her husband is retiring from business. Orin tells his wife what he thinks of her and she, flying into a rage, becomes insane. Orin weathers a financial crisis, but the death of his wife takes all the fight out of him and he retires from business. He goes to New York and buys his son, Richard, a brokerage business. The world again changes and we arrive at the fourth generation — the Clinton Nordholms. Natalie, daughter of Richard and Jennifer, is engaged to Sir Phillip Ivor, an English baronet. The grandfather protests, because Sir Phillip is a waster, twice divorced, and is told by his daughter- in-law to mind his own business. Enter Anna, great-grandmother, who decides to visit New York, for the wedding, taking with her Selma, a granddaughter of the girl who was the first real love of Orin II. The father of the bride is in financial difficulties, the mother of the bride has been carrying on with a lover, a brother of the bride has embezzled a large sum of money. The only decent person is Orin III, the other brother of the bride, who appears worthy to bear his grandfather's name. The marriage does not take place. While the bride is in church waiting for her father to come, he commits suicide, and with this tragedy comes also the end of Orin II. We end on the happy note of Anna, great- grandmother, and two young lovers Orin III and Selma III, down on the farm in Orinville. So really the world has changed very little, as far as men and women are concerned. There is so much that is good in this picture, and there is so much that could have been better, that it makes me furious to think how chances of turning out a superlative picture are thrown away. Personally, I would like to have seen more of Anna, because of the brilliance of Aline MacMahon. Her acting in the opening sequences is superb. An occasional scene in Orinville would have helped the film and been a contrast. I should like to have seen how that speck in the Great World had been faring all those years and how much it had changed. I am certain we could have been spared the insanity scenes, and the English baronet is* the most absurd person I've met for many a long day. Just as ridiculous as one of the sons who is supposed to be at Oxford. The baronet may have been stuck in to please the uninitiated American patrons, but it is an insult to the intelligence of an audience in this country. Of course, the producers and director may say that such people do exist, but that is no excuse for so libellous a caricature. The gem is reached when the baronet, bolting from church, puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle a cab. There were chances to include scenes that would have made this film memorable, but they were thrown away for unreal melodramatic stuff. Paul Muni, who plays Orin II, is really fine from his time as a young pioneer to his end as a tragic grandfather. But was it beyond the im- agination of the pro- ducers to give him a great scene with his mother, especially as she was Aline MacMahon. Of Aline I have already written. I need only add that I commend Warner Brothers who decided to make a star of her after this picture. PICTUREGOER Weekly The large cast includes such well-known names as Mary Astor (looking like a dishevelled Lady Macbeth in the insane scenes), Allan Dinehart, Guy Kibbee, Margaret Lindsay, Jean Muir, Henry O'Neil, Anna Q. Nilsson, Patricia Ellis, and Alan Mowbray (to whom I extend my sym- pathy for his Sir Phillip). In spite of certain severities in my criticism, I recommend you to see this picture. There's Muni and MacMahon. — M. B. Y. Service It is becoming increasingly more apparent that the best stories of English life come from America. It is certainly a queer topsy-turvy state of affairs, but there it is. You have only to cast your mind back to such pictures as Cavalcade, Berkley Square, and so on to realise the truth of that statement. And now here is another. Service, a stage play has been exceptionally well adapted to the screen with a wholly convincing English atmosphere. Clarence Brown, the director, has completely caught the spirit of tradition which is the dominant theme of this story of the managing director of an old-established store which is threatened with extinction in the slump, and is nearly bought up by an enterprising but cheap-jack firm. How Service, with the help of his son and daughter, who grow suddenly aware of the honourable business their ancestors have built up, saves the situation by detenmining to carry on in face of all odds, is thoroughly interesting. But there is a lot more to the picture than that. It shows the love his children have for him brought out by adversity, and also depicts the life of a big shop with a wealth of detail and realism. The employee's point of view is expressed through Benton, an old and valued servant of the company, who is discharged after forty years service. He in turn has to get rid of his daily help, so that the ramifications of unemployment are clearly expressed. Incidentally, this maid of all work, unnamed in the cast list, gives a performance that will bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened and cynical picturegoer. Benton takes his dismissal hard but faces the facts, and with the help of his wife, his son and daughter, who also rally round him, starts a pastrycook's business which proves successful. It is indeed partly due to his example, and — in spite of his treatment — unswerving loyalty to the firm that employed him that Service decides to carry on. Another factor in his decision is the underhand methods of forcing a sale used by the firm that is in the market to buy up Services. Service, however, is not so lucky in his wife as Benton . She is a young woman he married after his first wife's death, and spends her time at variance with her step-children and going out with a man-about- town. When she learns of the impending crash she deserts him. A touch of romance is introduced with a love affair between Service's efficient but shy young secretary and his daughter. As a whole, Clarence Brown gives us a microcosm of the world with its loves and hates, hopes and fears as mirrored by the people connected with the old-established firm. At times the sentiment is apt to be over-stressed, and there is a symbolical ending — Service sees in a rainbow which appears after a storm the sym- bol of prosperity not only for himself but for the world — which strikes a note of bathos. Generally, however, the picture is sincere and human and very well acted. Lionel Barrymore, dispensing with his more familiar mannerisms, gives a brilliant study of the elderly clerk. It is one of the best things he has done this year. Lewis Stone is sincere and thoroughly convincing as Service, while Elizabeth Allan, who appears to be steadily on the starward path, is delightfully ingenuous and human as his daughter, Caroline. As Service's wife, Benita Hume looks beautiful, but she puts no life or enthusiasm into the part. Colin Clive is not well cast as Caroline's lover; he does not suggest a romantic attachment at all well. Phillips Holmes, however, is good as Service's son. All the minor characters are well cast, and there is an atmosphere of realism which makes the picture a wholly convincing and entertaining one. — L.

Filmland's celebrities have been in the habit of dashing gayly over to the southern republic and returning in a few days, triumphantly waving divorce decrees. Among those who secured Mexican divorces are Sally Eilers, Zita Johann, Richard Dix, Lenore Ulric, Jack Holt and Max Baer. Sally Eilers recently married Harry Joe Brown. Friend or Foe ? Los Angeles police are trying to determine whether Harry Voller is a friend — or an enemy — of Mae West. Voller was at the wheel DeVOted Wife of Mae West's car, when the actress was held up by two bandits and robbed of $3,400 in money and $16,900 worth of jewellery. Voller and his wife had won the friendship of the star, and she was loath to believe that he could have had anything to do with the robbery. However, he was arrested in Chicago, and has been brought back to Los Angeles to stand trial with the two hold-up men, who are now in gaol. The little star publicly defended her mother so emphatically and attacked her father with such energy that Mr. Kosow decided to withdraw his action. He said he undertook legal proceedings in order to demonstrate to Sylvia in open court that h was not responsible for the estrangement whir! separated him from his wife and daughter. He- declares he withdrew the suit when he discovered his daughter's hostile attitude. Hard Luck Connie Cummings had an unfortunate ex- perience at Palm Springs, where she was sojourning for a few days with her husband, Benn Levy, the noted English playwright. While riding in the desert, she was thrown from her horse and several bones in her wrist were broken. The wrist was put in a cast, where it remained for two weeks. A Good Samaritan A genuine human interest document, received by the city editor of a Los Angeles newspaper, has been forwarded to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. It reads : \"A word of praise is sometimes considered cheap flattery, but I, as one in a party of four who were looking for employment, became stranded at Cameron, Arizona. All tyres were down to the last fabric. One gallon of gasoline was left. We had no money and were hungry. I want to show my appreciation in this way, as at present I cannot repay the money. \"Mr. Ramon Novarro, who is starring in Laughing Boy, was our benefactor to the extent of money, tyres, hotel, gasoline, and a smile that only a humanitarian could give. His only request was that he wanted us to pray for him, which was taken lightly by our party, but there was no doubt in my mind that he really meant it.\" The letter was signed and a Los Angeles address was given. Wedding Bells Alice White has finally taken the fatal step. She recently became the bride of Sidney Bartlett, scenarist, at Magdalene, Mexico. The ceremony was performed by a Mexican judge. Senor Rodriguez Galles, Governor of Baja, California, was one of the witnesses. A Deep Secret Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone have returned from New York, where they attended the premiere of the actress's latest production. While Tone makes no secret of his affection for Joan, the latter will not admit that marriage is contemplated. Her divorce decree from Douglas Fairbanks, jun., does not become effective until next April. Every indication points to a marriage soon after that date. Joan also declares that she was not in a private sanatorium in the East, under an assumed name, undergoing medical treatment. Sylvia Wins Sylvia Sidney scored a victory when her father, Victor Kosow, withdrew a court action whereby he sought to set aside the adoption of the actress by her step-father, Dr. Sigmund Sidney. Irene Dunne has a very agreeable arrangement with the Radio studios, to whom she is under contract. The studio is required to give her notice ten days in advance of the starting time of a production in which she is to appear. As soon as the film is completed, she is free to depart for New York, where her husband. Dr. Francis Griffin, resides. Irene always takes advantage of the vacation clause in her contract. She returned a few weeks ago from a reunion with her husband. A Studio in Turmoil Comedies sometimes fail to be funny, not only to audience, but often also to the actors. The Educational studio recently started pro- duction on The Fur Flies, a comedy wherein excitement is caused by the appearance of three skunks in a certain scene. The animals were supposed to be minus their potent weapon, but, as in \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" someone had blundered. When the animals were released from their cage, one of them promptly went into action and soon the stage was filled with an odour almost as terrifying as the gas used during the World War. Director, players and workmen fled madly from the stage. Eleanor Hunt, the leading lady, fell and sprained her ankle. It was an experience the actors will not soon forget. A Rumour Denied Jean Harlow indignantly says that there is no foundation for stories that she and hei husband, Hal Rosson, are considering divorce proceedings. The actress and her husband have been married only a few weeks, and appear to be very devoted to each other. Miss Harlow has a handsome home at Bel-Air and an apartment, dividing her time between the two homes, which may account for the divorce rumours. Hostile Pets On her arrival in Hollywood, Pat Patterson, London musical star, under contract to the Fox studio, on invitation took up temporary quarters at the home of her friend, Heather Angel, also from London. Miss Patterson brought with her a vivacious Scotch terrier, which immediately proceeded to attempt to make friends with Heather's two \"Peke \" dogs and her pet kitten. The \" Pekes \" and the cat proved most in- hospitable. The trio turned tail on their guest and fled for safety to a haven under a davenport. At last reports they were still under cover, and consistently refusing to extend a paw of welcome. \\ RocheUe Hudson makes the most of a fox fur. Her latest picture is \"Dr. Bull.\" A Sister's Chance Joan Blondell is in the hospital, recovering from an appendicitis operation, so is unable to play opposite James Cagney in The Heir Chaser. The Warner officials have taken tests of Joan's sister Gloria, and may assign the role to the latter actress, who is a most attractive young lady. Something New A trained steer plays an important role in Wheels of Destiny, Ken Maynard's latest Universal picture. Ken discovered the animal on a ranch at Pawnee, Oklahoma, where he saw it jump over a fence. Upon inquiry he learned that a cowboy had trained the steer to do the \"stunt.\" The actor brought cowboy and steer to Holly- wood, and both are now headed for screen careers.

The \" inside dope \" on a '* racket \" at which the American studios excel. THAT'S [WOW /-OLLYWOOD, January. . . . ^ m J Perched high in their mountain rE W top observatories round Los C-X \\J Angeles, astronomers sit peering through telescopes searching for new stars. Ensconced in their huge leather chairs, behind vast plate-glass covered desks in executive offices of Hollywood studios, producers pore over photographs and scrutinise \"tests\" in their ceaseless quest for motion- picture stars. Picking prima-donnas is no easy task, and a vast organisation whose ramifications extend to the farthest corners of the globe, is con- stantly on the hunt for new faces, unique and unusual personalities, capable of exploitation to stellar proportions. The development of a kinema star is no haphazard affair. It is not the offhand selection of a pretty face nor a well-turned figure, nor an attractive voice nor a graceful carriage. It is the choice of an entity em- bracing all these qualities plus a personality that can be projected from a strip of celluloid to thrill countless millions in motion-picture theatres all over the world. It means the expenditure of perhaps a million dollars in preliminary training, beauty-enhancing processes, artistic culture, publicity and propa- ganda, then the eventual production costs of a suitably imposing vehicle to turn the budding starlet into a glamorous, irresistible planet. Public taste is changeable. It veers, suddenly and swiftly from the flaming redheads to the raven locked brunettes; from golden blondes to glittering platinum Valkyries. When sound was synchronised and \"movies\" became \"talkies,\" a new element was added and the velvety resonance of Miss Janet Gaynor's low modulated voice started the vogue of the throaty, husky tones now so popular on the radio as well as the screen. Female audiences are particularly fickle. One year they clamour for mystical. Oriental sheiks, dark, desperate and swarthy. Next they switch to handsome, fair-haired Romeos, and then about-face and centre their attentions on the cave- man type, the brutal domineering he-men of a whole cycle of pictures. From that, the natural reaction is to the cate- gory of shy, timid, lovers whose boyish basbful- ness arouses sympathy in the feminine theatre- goers' hearts. Hollywood is the world's melting pot of feminine pulchritude. Like a giant, irresistible magnet the centre of the motion picture industry draws its satellites from all over the earth. The powerful lure exerts its influence over the United States, across the Atlantic, surges over England and Europe, thrusts its urge into Asia and even Africa. Its vibrations beat across the Pacific to the Far East, to the Orient, China and Japan, and against Australia; then radiate on to India, and the great frozen North beyond. Girls and youths from the four quarters of the globe are attracted to this mecca by the siren call of glittering success in glamorous surroundings of fame and wealth and triumph, amid plaudits and recognition from the peoples of the earth. From this premise, it would seem easy for the motion picture magnates to recruit their personnel, to find potential stars waiting on every restaurant table, serving at every soda fountain, on duty at every counter in every sixpenny store. Investigation, however, reveals that such is not the case. On the contrary, curiously enough, the diametrical opposite is true. A vast majority of the stars, present and potential, is gleaned from the distant byways, from regions far removed from the boulevards, of Hollywood, and the golden hordes of dazzling girls who haunt the casting offices and agents' bureaux in this sunshine flooded city. Here in these studios which deal in feminine charms as a commodity, the old adage that \"beauty is only skin deep,\" has been tested and proven to be correct. An attractive face and a good figure are not considered sufficient assets to warrant the risk of a million dollars for the creation of a star Talking pictures have complicated matters and added a new requisite to the necessary factors which must go to make up a featured player. The talkies have added voice and the audible reaction of theatre-goers to the former essential of a pleasing appearance carrying visual appeal. B esides the timbre of Lilian Harvey, who won star- dom in Germany and is now being glorified by Holly- wood. must be careful enuncia- tion, proper pronuncia- tion, meticulous diction, and appropriate gestures to accompany the spoken word. There must be a suitable tone to the laughter; gleaming teeth and a cupid bow mouth are no longer sufficient. But more than that, deeper than that, there must be innate artistry, a gracious deportment, with a fine elastic stride, a jaunty swing of the shoulders and hips; effortless play of the hands, and a proud carriage of the bead, which training cannot instil, but merely develop. Invariably visitors to Movietone City remark : \"Why, the waitresses in the restaurant on the lot, the secretaries and stenographers in the offices, appear much more pretty and attrac- tive than most of the actresses on the sets.\" Just another common fallacy. Long, expensive experience has taught producers that lenses do not lie. Experiments and tests have taught them, too, that there are three different and distinct phases of beauty. There is the natural form of beauty in life; the actual living and breathing person. Then there is the still photograph, the camera's faithful portrait of that same person. Lastly, there is the moving film of that person in action, talking, gesturing, walking. All three impressions are different. Not so ■Jam c>TARS (1 January 6, 1934 are JWade PICTUREGOER Weekly marked to the layman, perhaps, without an explanation, but exceedingly diverse to the trained eye of the successful producer, who spots at once the elements lacking in the only process which interests him, the motion picture screen test. Basically, probably, it's all a question of a radiation of personality. Personality is that intangible, almost indefinable charm which emanates to a greater or lesser extent, from a human being. It is the aura which in proportion to its develop- ment, lifts the individual from the brute level to the appealing, attractive, lovable and alluring type which can draw countless millions to pack theatres in any city in the world. Certain persons are capable of projecting their latent personality from a still photograph, a portrait. Others, fewer in number, are endowed with the subconscious ability to disseminate this personality and rouse one's sympathy and interest, from a motion picture reel. It is this last category that picture producers seek, persistently, and continually. These are they who draw indiscriminately Chinese coolies, Asiatic nomads, European peasants, African aborigines to picture shows. Winfield Sheehan, one of the most successful of Hollywood's producers in discerning the faint gleam in a potential star, estimates that the public rates its likings on a basis of 25 per cent, beauty and 75 per cent, artistry. This executive who is himself responsible for the discovery- and development of more than twenty stars of the first magnitude, considers beauty in face, form and voice comparatively prevalent, that ambition and determination are fairly com- mon, but that artistry, the ability to act naturally but convincingly, is extremely rare. From his long experience in spotting box office material, Mr. Sheehan has come to the conclusion that Americans and English, and members of the Slav races are, generally speaking, most likely to achieve stardom. Perhaps the mixture of blood from all the nations of the earth for long generations has con- tributed to fitting citizens of the United States for the requirements of the films. To mobility of countenance and vivacity of expression, the Slavs — Russians, Czecho-Slovaks, Poles and Hungarians — add, however, a singular ability to reflect soul and character in their countenances, he finds. \"Perhaps it is the result of centuries of suffer- ing, of generations of oppression and misery in the turmoil of the Old World history that has left the stamp on these peoples,\" says Mr. Sheehan, \"but certainly their artistry arouses sympathy, estab- lishes a definite link and interest for the movie- goer.\" Mr. Sheehan is careful to differentiate the Slav type from the Oriental, which lacks entirely in the appeal, and the allure of his neighbour. Natives of India and China are not photogenique, fail utterly to register satisfactorily on the films. The immobility of their visage, the stolid fatalism of their belief, is probably largely responsible for this absence of expression. Technical and biological reasons have been advanced to account for this difference. The deficiency is ascribed variously to dullness of the eye, chemical composition of the facial epidermis, the missing vibrancy of the voice, the slow or lethargic movements of the limbs. The Slav type is more completely enshrouded with the air of mystery than her more mystic Oriental neighbour. She emanates an elusive illusiveness, a sense of the unreal and unfathom- able, which intrigues the spectator and fires his imagination as to the reality of the figure on the screen. Jan'^t Gaynor is an example of the American type girl which draws universally, not only among her compatriots in the United States, but to audiences all over the world, men, women and children alike. Miss Gay nor 's great appeal is to the heart, to the emotions, through her naive wistful, sympathy-stirring personality. Myrna Loy is an example of the exotic Slav type, almost Far Eastern in her characteristics. Actually she was a school teacher in Montana be- by Yienry WALES fore going into pictures. Miriam Hopkins, despite her Nordic blondeness, exudes the suppressed glamour of the Slav type, although in reality an American girl of Yankee parentage. Miss Lilian Harvey is a cosmopolite. Born in England of Teutonic descent, she studied and appeared first in public in Vienna. Later she made pictures in Berlin, Paris and London, and came to Hollywood to complete her triumphs as a real, inter- national star. Two newcomers to Movietone City are Miss Pat Patterson and Mile. Ketti Gallian. The former, an English girl, is from the town of Sunderland on the North Sea, bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by battleships during the Great War. Her golden hair is a reminder of her Saxon Spencer Tracy, one of the Fox studio's most valuable \" dis- progenitors, themselves neighbours of the warlike Slavs. Mile. Gallian is a brunette irom the Midi of France, a true Gallic type, with the alert, tempera- mental gestures of the Latin, the impulsive.vibrant voice so closely allied with the voc?l characteris- tics of the Slavs. With other youthful aspirants, these two girls will be put through an intensive course of training and preparation at Movietone City. Candidates are groomed physically as well as in speech. Teeth are maae perfect for photo- graphic effect — coiffeurs are arranged to har- monise with countenances. They are taught poise and carriage, walking with long, clean- limbed paces. They learn dramatics, the proper stance for speaking, the development of flexibility of the lips for proper, clear speaking, swift transitions of mood and expressive reactions. One of the earliest of Mr. Sheehan 's successes was Theda Bara, the original \"vamp,\" who rose in fame from an unknown to the highest salaried screen-player of her epoch. A web of mystery was cast about this gorgeous, mysterious creature which thrilled and hypnotised theatre-goers. Charles Farrell was another \"find,\" who shot like a rocket from the unknown to become an international matinee idol. Paul Muni, destined to become the most com- pelling of all the widely contrasting characters so popular on the screen; the two glittering beauties — Barbara La Marr and Dorothy Mackaill ; then Spencer Tracy the likeable \"he-man\" of to-day's sophisticated screen-plays; the dashing Helen Twelvetrees and the siren-like Dorothy Jordan; George Brent and the vivacious Dolores Del Rio; and the inimitable swashbucklers, Victor MacLaglen and Eddie Lowe, are among the other stellar talent discovered by Mr. Sheehan..

I thought my m decoration, my promo- te tions — yours by right — wouldn't matter so much. What are you going to do?\" Tom Holmes, ex-private in the American Expeditionary Force, read agony in the eyes, the whole trembling frame of the man whom cowardice had prevented from doing his duty as a soldier. \"Nothing,\" he mumbled. \"It wasn't your fault you got cold feet and stayed behind in that shell-hole. What did it matter who brought the prisoner in, anyway ? Besides, I ought to have been killed. I should have been if it hadn't been for the German M.O. He got me through, though it took him two years in a prison camp to do it.\" At that moment Tom thought it well worth while by a promise of 22 silence to save a man's reputation, such was the relief that dawned in Major Roger Winton's scared face. \"I'll see you're all right, for cer- tain,\" Roger said. \"My father's just been elected president of Nash- ville City Bank. You will not suffer if I can help it.\" Tom did suffer. To begin with, he hadn't told Roger all. Hadn't told of the portions of shell left in his spine, causing him attacks of physical pain- — unendurable pain that only morphine would relieve. \"Take these tablets, one at a time, when you can't stand it,\" the German M.O. had bidden Tom in excellent English when he had said \"Good-bye.\" He did take them, hating to see how swiftly their number diminished, sensing they would be hard to replace. As bank clerk, work for which he had little aptitude, since it lacked the human touch that was so essen- tial to him, life was dull but bearable. When in pain he couldn't stand it. Under those terrific onslaughts, that drew sweat from every pore, figures reeled, became meaningless, causing the despair of his superiors. Miser- ably right, too, he had been about the replacement of morphine. Once, under an acute attack, he crept away from the bank in office hours ; the local doctor proved adamant. \"My dear fellow, it's more than my place is worth. I daren't issue morphine in that strength.\" \" But can't you see I can't stand this ? I must have it.\" \"Impossible. I'm sorry. Tom struggled back to the bank, where he found the President had sent for him. Roger was in the room keeping his mouth shut, while his father rated Tom for inefficiency. When the white-haired man of business said, \"This isn't war time, you know; can't expect us to get on with peace if you can't work,\" Roger bent over the chair where Tom sat with staring eyes. \"He's been badly shell-shocked, don't forget, dad. I'll look after you, Tom.\" \"You will. Then tell your father what I did to save your disgrace. Tell him I went out and brought in a Hun prisoner and you got the credit for it. Tell him your red tabs and medals belong to me.\" Ashamed of his outburst, Tom got out of the room. He was later thankful to find that Roger's father had attributed his accusations to temporary insanity. He had done with the bank, anyway. Followed two nightmare years for Tom in hospital, from which, after a com- plicated spinal operation, he was finally discharged, cured both of his pain and the morphine habit. America knew many such, but no lonelier man than Tom on the date of his discharge. His father and mother had both died within the past year and, as newcomers to Nashville on the declaration of war, had had few friends. When Tom stepped on to a Chicago station platform and into the streets to look for a job, there was not a voice within five hundred miles to give him a welcoming \" Hullo.\" Liking the look of an eating house in 55th Street, he went in. The inscriptions on the colour-washed walls, \" This is no flopping place, but you can snooze for a while,\" \"No religious discussions allowed,\" and \"Have you written to mother?\" sounded a genial note. So, too, the dark-haired young woman standing by the urn who took his order. Appreciating the quality of the coffee, Tom asked for a vacant room. \"We have one if Pop hasn't given it away,\" she informed, nodding in the direction of a kindly greybeard installed at the counter. \"I believe in folk having a bite for nothing when they can't afford to pay, but Pop's awful that way.\" She took him upstairs, extolling the merits of a spring mattress by practical demonstration, while Tom was more concerned with the pros- pect from the window. \" Bit dark,\" he frowned and was deciding that a brick wall blocking the entire view, was not, under any circumstances, to be borne, when there was a rustle on the stairs. A girl appeared retreating on fear of interrupting. \"Come along, Ruth. You may as well be introduced to our new lodger. I'm Mary,\" announced the would-be landlady. Tom found himself staring at the prettiest face he had ever seen . \" I'd better pay a week in advance, seeing that you don't know me,\" he observed, smiling for the first time in years. The fact that Ruth worked at a laundry was deemed sufficient excuse for finding a post there himself and, having found it, to improve upon it. In view of trade depression, no mere words but a devastating reality in Chicago, Tom, nevertheless, heard with dread that the manager wanted to see him. Mr. Gibson, middle aged with the humanitarian's forehead, spoke from his desk. \" At a time when all my rounds- men are losing business, your round has picked up twenty per cent. How is that ? \"Well, sir, I've started a bonus scheme. Say Mrs. Jones recom- mends Mrs. Smith to the laundry, Mrs. Jones receives a voucher entitling her to groceries. I'm in (Continued on page 23.)

A bit of a crank, I should say; at the same time, the machine he's trying to patent has points to interest you. Would you spare him a half- hour sometime ? Under the conviction that he had scored another round which, if only his fellow-lodger Max would co-operate, would win the game for them both, Tom went home. \"Mary . . . Ruth. . . . Great news I Get on your hats ! We're dining out to-night. . . . Where's Max?\" he rotated in quick fire before he was well inside the hospit- able doors of the coffee-room. Taking Ruth's arm, for he couldn't bear, on this night of nights to let her go, he sought out Max. This somewhat eccentric engineer, having agreed to interview Mr. Gibson any- time, retired into his workshop-cum- bedroom, whence promptly issued animated sounds of chisel and hammer. Tom had meant to wait till the end of the evening to approach Ruth on a subject even more thrilling than his work, but her flush of excited pleasure took him by storm. Locked in each other's arms, he never knew that Mary, attired in her best, was watching them from the open door. \"I'm sorry,\" she faltered. \"I can't come to-night. You two run alon"
