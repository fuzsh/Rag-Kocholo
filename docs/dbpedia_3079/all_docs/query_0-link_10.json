I’ve tried not to think.”\n\nSister Jem-“Have you prayed?”\n\nSister Pamela-“Sister… I’ve prayed for humility and obedience. But there was no answer in my heart Sister Jem… only silence! If I truly belonged here wouldn’t I know wouldn’t I feel it inside?\n\nSister Jem- “You must give yourself time child. These things can’t be hurried.”\n\n———\n\nSister Pamela (Lynley) –“I wish to leave the order reverend mother.”\n\nReverend Mother (Isobel Elsom) – “You can’t know what you’re saying.”\n\nSister Pamela –“I know Reverend Mother.”\n\nReverend Mother –“But you’re not a child sister Pamela. You mustn’t respond to trouble like a child.”\n\nSister Pamela –“I’ve thought about it reverend mother, I’ve thought and I’ve prayed.”\n\nReverend Mother –“When a child is naughty it wants to run away from home- but your home is with God. You cannot run away from him.”\n\nSister Pamela –“I’m not running away from God. I wish to leave the order, Reverend Mother. I’m not suited I’ve known it for some time. Mr. Downey was right about me.”\n\nReverend Mother –“Why should anything that Mr. Downey says effect you?”\n\nSister Pamela –“Because he knew the truth. Some people retreat to God, not advance toward him and that’s what I’ve done. I’ve hidden myself away from the world for what I know to be selfish reasons.”\n\nReverend Mother –“But is that so bad sister?”\n\nSister Pamela –“I haven’t been honest not with myself, not with you, and not with God.”\n\nCinematographer John L. Russell’s camerawork – sets up the solitary landscape of Final Vow.\n\nOn the eve of her taking her final vows, Sister Pamela suffers a crisis of confidence and faith feeling like she is merely hiding from the outside world. And soon finds herself in the deep end as she tumbles unwisely into the sleazy circle of violent thugs who stole it.\n\nDoe-eyed and guileless Lynley puts forth the purity of a young novitiate who has lived an insulated life now, in search of answers is suddenly confronted with evil resembling a violent low-life, thereby from the safekeeping of the convent, Pamela begins her harrowing descent into Hell.\n\nWhile gentle and wide-eyed in manner, Lynley still conveys a miraculous balance of fortitude and grace when holding her own in a hostile environment. An unravished bride of Christ, Sister Pamela learns along her journey outside the sanctuary beyond the walls of the convent, how this story warns of how men treat women.\n\nDuring her lunch break at work, Jimmy (Gulagher) grabs her wrists looking for a wedding ring, insulting her by mocking her prudish ways, and finally manhandling her suggestively at the party. He also knocks his girlfriend Bess around. And worst and most dangerous of all, he assaults and threatens to kill her at the pawnshop, even after he realizes that she’s a nun.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe episode opens with a solemn meal at a convent, as Sister Pamela drops a pitcher of milk that smashes on the floor and unsettles everyone at the table, especially Pamela who is a coiled spring. Like the fragmented glass pitcher, Pamela’s innocence is yet to be shattered when she enters the outside world.\n\nSister Gem (Charity Grace) –“Oh Sister, not tears again, you’ve cried a whole river these past weeks.” Pamela- Sister Gem, I only have myself to blame.”\n\nNote: The wonderful Charity Grace was a very busy character actress on television. You might recognize her as one of the Morrison sisters on The Andy Griffith Show episode Alcohol and Old Lace where she and her sister run a secret moonshine still operation. It’s one of the most hilarious episodes of the series, especially getting to watch Barney Fife muster such zeal in busting up the still with his axe ‘Pow, pow, pow!’\n\nThe older Sister Jem consoles Sister Pamela through her doubts and The Reverend Mother Isobel Elsom believes that Sister Pamela Wiley’s crisis will disappear in time.\n\nAt the request of the Reverend Mother, Sister Pamela is sent to see Sister Lydia in the infirmary, who tells her that she too, once had the same uncertainty as a young novice.\n\nSister Lydia tasks Sister Pamela with a very special mission to meet the once young hooligan now a reformed gangster, William Michael Downey (R.G. Armstrong) from the early days of parochial school – the failed protégé of the Abbess sister Lydia. Sister Lydia never stopped writing to him for over thirty years. She asks Pamela to go in her place in order to “I want you to see what faith and prayer will do.”\n\nDowney has invited Sister Lydia to his mansion after thirty years of silence to give her a very special statue of St Francis to the convent. It’s a gesture of thanks and a very sacred piece of art.\n\nSister Jem accompanies Sister Pamela by train to Downey’s opulent penthouse that commands a spectacular view of the city.\n\n“I suppose you think her prayers have helped me.” “Yes, I do.”Have all your prayers been successful too?”\n\nShe admires his art collection. Downey makes a joke, “Funny isn’t it, an old heathen like me.”\n\nWhile the old gal Sister Jem is out like a light on the balcony in an almost fairytale-like slumber. Lyn Murray’s music underscores Gem’s sleep momentarily with an almost childlike lullaby hinting that her drowse is otherworldly. Sister Pamela and Downey begin a heated dialogue about faith and prayer. And though he wears a classy suit, it cannot disguise his coarse, boorish, and unpolished nature. She rebukes him – “Prayers aren’t business deals.” Still, his words strike at the heart of Sister Pamela’s conflict that she has been living in isolation at the convent in order to hide from the world. Downey is like the serpent’s temptation of Eve, who sows the seed of doubt in Pamela that the convent is not a place of ceremony and service for her but a convenient refuge from life.\n\nDowney enlightens Sister Pamela about the history of the St. Francis statue which is five centuries old, which lived at the Medici Palace and was created by the Italian Renaissance artist Donatello. He hands over the statue of St. Francis to Sister Pamela so that she can take give it to his benefactress Sister Lydia. “I hope this’ll make it up to her.”\n\nNow at the train station, a young man emerges out of the hum of the crowd and offers to help the sisters with their suitcases, one which holds the irreplaceable icon. He quickly vanishes. The sisters go to the police and Pamela notices petty crook Jimmy Bresson in the lineup, who runs a slick little scheme lifting luggage from unsuspecting travelers.\n\nBut Jimmy has an alibi for his whereabouts claiming he was with his girlfriend at the time of the theft. Pamela takes note of his job and his girlfriend’s address and will later track him down at the Gramercy Appliance Co.\n\nSister Pamela returns to the convent and confesses to Reverend Mother that the theft of the statue is a sign that she cannot be trusted and that it is time to leave the order and stop hiding from the world for selfish reasons. The statue was valuable because-“It was a reward for a lifetime of work.”\n\nThe Reverend Mother tells her to take hold of herself but that she’ll have a place there if she should return.\n\nDetermined to recover the priceless statue, the guilt-ridden Pamela leaves the convent. She applies for a job at the Gramercy Appliance Co as a typist where she can follow Jimmy who works in the shipping department, and moves into a modest apartment. Then she injects herself into the small group of friends in order to get closer to Jimmy Bresson.\n\nJimmy -“Princess you’re a nice kid, you gotta relax, you gotta have fun, you gotta have some games, and I know the rules, I’m just the guy to show ya.”\n\nAs Pamela eats her lunch by herself on the loading dock, Jimmy begins to make the moves on her and invites her to a party, which she agrees to. But Jimmy’s girlfriend Bess (Carmen Phillips) gets jealous when he pays too much attention to the lovely Pamela, when he tries to persuade her to come with him, she decides to stay with Bess.\n\nWhile inside the apartment Bess leaves the room for a moment and Pamela soon finds a pawn ticket from Wormer Pawn Ship. Bess tells Pamela that Jimmy does his business out of the shop.\n\nUnder the guise of looking for religious statues, Wormer shows her the stolen statue of St. Francis and asks $20 for it, but calls Jimmy to come because he becomes suspicious of Pamela.\n\nJimmy shows up and finally recognizes her from the train station, realizing that she’s a nun.\n\nAfter roughing her up he and Wormer conspire to do away with her. Though Wormer is superstitious and tells Jimmy that it is “bad luck–robbing a nun.” Before they kill Pamela Jimmy shoves her into the back room and tells Wormer to call Mike the Broker to appraise the value of the statue.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Mike turns out to be Downey who signals to Pamela to keep quiet. He tells Jimmy and Wormer that the religious relic is a piece of junk. Downey clarifies to the bumbling pair of thugs that what has no material value can be priceless to the religious who consider the objects to be blessed and convinces them to let Pamela go. Downey gives her the statue and tells her to go and throws Wormer the $20.\n\nEscaping her ordeal, she hurries out into the bright light of day breaking free of the darkness. Out into the open streets holding onto the small treasure with her life when Downey pulls up and drives her back to the convent. He expresses regret for the things he said to her and sees that she is not hiding from the world at all. “Sister I said some rough things to you that day you came to see me. I just wanted you to know I was wrong. You’re not hiding from anything.”\n\nAs he leaves she journeys back inside the convent with her quest in hand, her questions answered, and faith in herself restored.\n\nCredits\n\n* Final Vow was directed by Norman Lloyd and written by Henry Slesar and was first broadcast on The Alfred Hitchcock Hour on CBS on Thursday, October 25, 1962.\n\n* Lyn Murray’s evocative arrangement is heard frequently throughout the series. Including Hitchcock’s feature-length crime thriller, To Catch a Thief (1955), he scored 35 episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour including The Paragon and What Really Happened.\n\nThe Film Score Freak recognizes Lyn Murray composer of the heart obscurely\n\n*RIDE THE NIGHTMARE s1e11- Gena Rowlands aired Nov. 29, 1962\n\nGENA ROWLAND’S BIO\n\nThe alchemy of Gena Rowland’s acting style is how she integrates her craft with an indescribable beauty and presence that is reminiscent of Hollywood’s Golden Age.\n\nBefore the emotionally distilled and complex actress emerged as an icon, Gena Rowlands set out with her husband John Cassavetes to create a new naturalistic landscape of independent American movies in the 1970s, that inspired generations of filmmakers. She began showing the attractive pull of her strength in dramatic teleplays for early television programming.\n\nShows like Robert Montgomery Presents, Ponds Theater Armstrong Circle Theatre Studio One The United States Steel Hour Goodyear Playhouse General Electric Theater, and of course Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. She had a regular stint on the television police procedural series, 87th Precinct playing cop Robert Lansing’s deaf wife. In 1975 she starred alongside Peter Falk (One of Cassavete’s inner sanctum of actors along with Ben Gazzara) in Columbo’s season 4 episode Playback.\n\nIn feature films, she was cast as Jerry Bondi in Lonely Are the Brave in 1962, in Cassavetes’ A Child is Waiting in 1963, and in Gordon Douglas’ Tony Rome 1967 starring friend Frank Sinatra and Richard Conte.\n\nWorking since the mid-1950s Rowlands began to give shades of the forceful performances to come in the three episodes of Hitchcock’s series, in particular, The Lonely Hours playing off veteran stage actress Nancy Kelly.\n\nGena Rowlands was nominated for two Academy Awards for her performances in director/actor husband John Cassavetes’ films. In 1974 for A Woman Under the Influence and in 1980 for her gutsy portrait of one tough broad in Gloria 1980.\n\nShe was also nominated for eight Golden Globes having won two, and eight Emmys winning three. On November 14th, Gena Rowlands was finally given an Honorary Oscar at the Governors Awards ceremony.\n\n“With her bold bone structure and the curtain of her wheat=gold Jackie O coif, Gena Rowlands is the classic Hollywood icon that got away…. Had she been born into the Studio ear of the 1930s or 1940s, one suspects that she would have sured up a career running across the grand roles, from the tough boots molls through to the stoic others and peppery femme fatales. She has the angular hardness which typifies the best of them in that period- one can imagine her, as easily as Crawford, Davis, Stanwyck or Bacall.” -bfi.org.uk\n\n“I’d never seen anyone that beautiful with a certain gravitas. It was particularly unique in that time, when many women were trying to be girlish, affecting a superficial, ‘I’m a pretty girl’ attitude. It seemed to be the best way to succeed, but Gena did none of that. There was a directness—not that she wasn’t fun and didn’t smolder—but it came from a place that was both genuine and deep.” – Mia Farrow\n\nDirector Sidney Lumet in an interview with critic James Grissom, said: “The highest compliment I can pay to her—to anyone—is that the talent frightens me, making me aware of the lack of it in so many and the power that accrues to those who have it and use it well. And the talent educates and illuminates. She is admirable, which can be said of only a few of us.”\n\nIn Faces 1968, nominated for 3 Oscars, Rowlands plays prostitute Jeannie with director Cassavetes with something like steel and fearlessness behind her eyes asserting a challenge to try and reach her after being crushed by men. Rowland manifests a performance ‘aching with wordless solitude’ (Ebert)\n\nIn the visual poem about loneliness and the feeling of isolation, Minnie & Moskowitz 1971 stars Rowland as the edgy blonde Minnie who perceptively flickers with co-star Seymour Cassel and displays her captivating sensuality under Cyclopean sunglasses.\n\nRowlands garnered her first Oscar nomination for her unforgettable performance as Mabel Longhetti in A Woman Under the Influence 1974 co-starring Peter Falk who is in the grips of Mabel’s mental illness.\n\n“It left me exhausted and depressed-feeling. Some of the time, when you’re walking out there where the air is thin, you just hope you can walk back again.” -Gena Rowlands\n\nAs Myrtle Gordon, Rowlands gives another masterful performance in Cassavetes’ Opening Night portraying a successful stage actress rehearsing a production of The Second Woman in New Haven, whose life is turned upside down after she witnesses a 17-year-old fan’s death outside the theater. She captures the restless energy that imbues the behind-the-scenes world of the theater and the ‘dreary perspective of Myrtle’s uninspiring production she stars in.’ (Chris Wiegand- The Guardian).\n\n“All while descending into a prolonged crack-up involving binge drinking, consultations with mediums, and a repeat hallucination of a young girl… Early on, when Myrtle is first confronted with the hallucination/girl, there’s a closeup of Rowlands’ face that is an example of her unique genius. Even very talented actors feel the need to show an audience “what a moment is about.” Not Rowlands. In that closeup, Myrtle stares at the girl, wondering if she has finally lost her mind, and then she puts an almost welcoming expression on her face, before mouthing the word, “Hello!” It’s hair-raising.” Ebert)\n\nNipping at booze, Myrtle trips between reality on and off stage, drenched in an alcoholic delirium – “Rowlands’ drunkenness in “Opening Night” is in the pantheon of Great Drunks onscreen.” (Roger Ebert).\n\nMyrtle drifts in and out of character conjuring visions of two women who do not exist. Virginia the role for which she is wary of, struggles to portray an older woman for the first time, a character who is aesthetically defined by her age. And embracing the phantom of Nancy, the young girl who died, whose youthful receptiveness is what she seeks to direct, all within an oppressive environment driven by the men she works with, director (Ben Gazzara) and ex-lover co-star (Cassavetes).\n\nHow can you bring a character alive if you don’t believe in them – Myrtle asks playwright Sarah Goode played by Joan Blondell. Myrtle needs to reclaim her identity on stage and for herself.\n\nGena Rowland in Gordon Douglas’ Tony Rome 1967.\n\nIn Gloria 1980 directed by John Cassavetes, Rowlands gets to play the hard-edged gun moll she would have perfected in the best film noirs of the 1940s. Gloria Swenson becomes the reluctant guardian of a little boy whose family is murdered by the mob. The two go on the run in the gritty streets of New York City in possession of a book that the mob wants. Rowland is never fake while she roars and swears at the thugs chasing her on the subway, moving like the wind down the sidewalks of New York in her silk suits, handling her gun like an uncompromising pro.\n\nSource Andrew Key\n\nSource Chris Wiegand The Guardian\n\nSource: Roger Ebert\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nRide the Nightmare is a noirish crime drama with low-lighting, William Marguiles frames Rowlands as if she’s outside looking in on a nightmare.\n\nHelen – ”I’ve been awake all night I’ve been trying to visualize going on… to what?… I can’t Chris.

They come looking for Chris after he runs out, leaving them to take the rap for a holdup.

Someone is outside watching them.\n\nChris begins to panic, yelling at Helen to shut off all the lights “Do like I tell you!” The quiet house turns into a threateningly dark space.\n\nAll the time, Helen switches into survival mode, confused but unrattled when a stranger with a gun breaks into the house and confronts Chris accusing him of being someone else she doesn’t know.\n\nAfter a scuffle in the dark, the gunman reveals that he found ‘Philips’ O’Brian’s real name.\n\nHelen “You’re making a mistake. Can’t you see he’s not the man your after. Our name is Martin.”\n\nFred – “Martin hah, Philips is the name I know him by. You thought you could change your name and we wouldn’t find ya That’s right baby… we. For a while there I thought you did get away. Then I saw that picture of ya in that magazine. You know a picture of you in that bowling thing when you won the state championship. And I said to myself – there’s a picture of my old friend Chrissy boy. And I just got to stop in and say hello.”\n\nHelen –“You’d better get out of here, my husband has called the police.”\n\nFred- “No you didn’t do that did ya? No, you wouldn’t do that would you Chrissy boy? Cause if you called the police they’d send you to jail and you don’t want to go to jail do you Chrissy boy?”\n\nHelen Martin “You did call them (the police) didn’t you Chris?”\n\nFred “You mean you didn’t tell her Chris, ah that wasn’t nice. You should have told her about your wicked past.”\n\nChris- “Shut up! Don’t move.”\n\nFred “Yeah that’s right lady, I’m gonna kill him just like I said I would.”\n\nThe two men struggle in the kitchen. She picks up a knife and is about to come and help Chris fight off Fred, but he shoots and kills him. The life she knew changed in one crazy moment and all she thought she knew was gone. She wanders for a moment in the dark room.\n\nthe ice in the tray the dead body in the kitchen…\n\nThough it’s late in the evening, Olan Soulé, Martin’s drunk neighbor comes over and pushes himself on them, making a nuisance out of himself in order to borrow ice cubes. He almost wanders into the kitchen where Fred lies dead. They manage to get him out of the house. The second time there is an annoyance thrown in as beveling distractions thrown in their way as an obstacle is while at the bank trying to get the money for ransom, one of their neighbors hounds him for the canopy dish Helen had borrowed. The intrusion of the neighbors acts as a narrative mechanism to frustrate all of us.\n\nChris relates the story to Helen: He didn’t tell her because she was so young when they got married after 7 years he figured he might not have to\n\nHe was young, 19 years old working for a bank, picking up deposits from all the big stores in the area. He didn’t get along with his father, so he started hanging around some of the local bars. That’s where he met Fred. He looks toward the kitchen. Later on, he met Steve and Adam the other two who escaped prison.\n\nThey planned a robbery, stealing the deposits from a jewelry store. Chris was a lookout and he was supposed to warn them, but the old security guard triggered the alarm, and he ran when he heard the police. The three armed men killed the old man.\n\nChris – “I drove away til the car ran out of gas came to LA changed his name Met her and that was it.”\n\nHelen –“Chris if you think you can put him someplace where they won’t find him Then do it. Do it!”\n\nThey drive to Topanga Canyon, where Chris buries Cliff’s body by the side of the road.\n\nWhen the other two thugs show up John Anderson as Adam and Richard Shannon as Steve, they make Chris go to the bank to get them money in exchange for Helen who they’ve kidnapped and are holding in a shack.\n\nSince Helen is being held hostage at the shack, Chris must drive there alone. After he shoots Steve, Chris and Helen run off into the brush together as Adam chases them deeper into the canyon.\n\nWhen the couple are cornered Chris sets fire to some brush, Adam becomes trapped by the blaze engulfed in flames, and Chris and Helen climb to safety as fire trucks and police pass them on the road.\n\nCREDITS\n\nRide the Nightmare was directed by Bernard Gerard, and it aired on CBS on November 29, 1962.\n\nRichard Matheson was hired to adapt a teleplay from his story for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, though he found it challenging to condense it to a one-hour television slot. Ride the Nightmare, a paperback original released by Ballantine in 1959, was adapted from Matheson’s short story “Now Die In It.” The story had been previously published in the debut issue of Mystery Tales in December 1958.\n\nMatheson has written some of the most compelling mystery/science fiction & fantasy stories and screenplays – in 1957 with The Incredible Shrinking Man, based on his own novel, The Last Man on Earth 1964 starring Vincent Price and The Omega Man 1971 are both based on his novel I Am Legend.\n\nIn 1959, he expanded his repertoire to include teleplays, and throughout the subsequent decades, he accumulated numerous credits, including writing for The Twilight Zone and receiving an Edgar Award for his teleplay The Night Stalker (1972).

In particular for his work as the voice of Batman in several cartoon series. He can be remembered as the prissy Mr. Masters who directs the choral and cringes at Barney Fife’s tone-deaf caterwauling in The Andy Griffith Show’s The Song Festers and Barney and the Chorus.\n\nJohn Anderson’s extensive credits on TV and in the movies span from 1950 until his death, having appeared in Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) as well as in three episodes of his TV series.\n\n*HANGOVER-s1e12 aired Dec 6, 1962- Jayne Mansfield\n\nJayne Mansfield Bio\n\nJayne Mansfield was an American movie, stage, and television actress, and nightclub singer who was one of the leading sex symbols of the 1950s & 60s considered to be the poor man’s Marilyn Monroe. Her first big break on stage was ‘Will success spoil Rock Hunter?’Later. A voluptuous pixie who was compartmentalized as a blonde bombshell but she had more than just pizzazz and could pull off a dramatic role. Just watch her performance as Gladden in The Burglar 1957.\n\nAlthough Marilyn Monroe was a prominent sex symbol of her era, she was not the only one. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Jayne Mansfield emerged as a significant sex symbol in Hollywood and was deemed by some as the “working man’s Monroe”, being 20th Century Fox’s response to Marilyn. Mansfield is widely regarded as one of Hollywood’s original blonde bombshells, and even though many may not have seen her movies, she remains a highly recognizable actress from the celebrity culture of the 1950s. Mansfield was labeled “working man’s Monroe.”\n\nW. Kellman, the producer of the obscure film noir The Burglar 1957 starring Dan Duryea, was the first to offer her a dramatic role. Her portrayal of Gladden proved that Mansfield was capable of a full range of acting beyond the bombshell image.\n\nIn an attempt to shed her “blonde bombshell” persona and establish herself as a serious actress, she showcased her acting skills in the film “The Wayward Bus.” After the success of “The Girl Can’t Help It,” 20th Century Fox paid a staggering $100,000 to buy out her contract with Broadway and began to promote her. Her first leading role on television was in “The Bachelor.” “Kiss Them for Me” marked her final starring role in a mainstream Hollywood studio film, and she subsequently returned to European films with her performance in “The George Raft Story.” Although her film “Promises! Promises!” faced censorship in Cleveland due to its explicit content, it still achieved great success in other areas, earning her a spot on the Top 10 list of box-office attractions for the year 1963.\n\n31 Flavors of Noir on the Fringe to Lure you in!

She studied acting at HB Studio under Uta Hagen.\n\nin 1959, she was proclaimed “Hollywood’s new Grace Kelly”\n\nDina Merrill in The Young Savages 1961.\n\nMerrill’s film credits included Desk Set 1957, and Operation Petticoat 1959 with Cary Grant who had been married to Merrill’s cousin, the Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. She also appeared in The Sundowners 1960, Butterfield l8 1960 starring Mildred Dunnock as Taylor’s uptight mother, and The Young Savages 1961. She also appeared in made-for-TV movies, such as Seven in Darkness 1969, and The Lonely Profession that same year\n\nMerrill appeared in numerous television series in the 1960s, such as playing the villain Calamity Jan in two 1968 episodes of Batman with then-husband Cliff Robertson. She also made guest appearances on The Bold Ones, Mission: Impossible, The Love Boat, Quincy M.E., and Murder She Wrote.\n\nPatricia Collinge Bio:\n\nPatricia Collinge, is an endearingly beautiful woman, with winsome, kind eyes that glimmer when she speaks. Through her broad sweet-tempered smile, emerges her voice, with a quality that strikes me as distinct, giving the impression of spaces between her words… with her authentically regal and splendid kindness. You will recognize her most often playing sympathetic widows, whimsical mothers, aunts, or vulnerable older women. Collinge was primarily a celebrated stage actress from 1908-1952.\n\nCollinge originated the role of Birdie Hubbard in Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes on Broadway in 1939, probably her most notable performance as well as her film debut is that of the forlorn and fragile, beguiling and heartbreaking interpretation of Aunt Birdie Hubbard in the screen version of Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes 1941, which was a recreation of her role in the original Broadway production in 1939, which she co-starred with Tallulah Bankhead.\n\nPatricia Collinge as Aunt Birdie with Teresa Wright in The Little Foxes 1941\n\nWhile Bankhead was considered to reprise her role as Regina Giddens in the film adaptation, Bette Davis was cast instead. Collinge’s psychologically tortured, neglected, and alcoholic Aunt Birdie is perhaps the most startling performance of the picture.\n\nCollinge’s touching performance won her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and in my opinion, should have delivered her the honor. She lost to Mary Astor for The Big Lie.\n\nAnother memorable role is Collinge’s Emmie Newton in Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller, Shadow of a Doubt 1943 where she plays Teresa Wright’s humble, proud, and chatty housewife who dotes over her baby brother Charlie, The Merry Widow Killer. Collinge also rewrote the scene with Macdonald Carey confessing his love for her in the garage. The cast was reportedly dissatisfied with the dialogue and she was asked to rewrite the script, which pleased Hitchcock.\n\nCollinge is also uncredited for writing some of the other dialogue for Shadow of a Doubt, and having been one of several writers on Hitchcock’s Lifeboat 1944 in which she did not appear as an actress.\n\nShe appeared briefly as Sister William in The Nun’s Story 1959, Collinge also gave dramatic performances in such television series The Web 1953 “Midnight Guest” Celanese Theatre 1952 “Mornings at Seven”, Goodyear Playhouse “The Rumor” 1953, Omnibus “Lord Byron’s Love Letter”, and Studio Ones “Crime at Blossom’s”, The River Garden” and “The Hero”. She also appeared in Armstrong Circle Theater 1955-56 and East Side/West Side 1963 “Creeps Live Here”, and United Steel Hour 1962 “Scene of the Crime”\n\nAs sure as my name is MonsterGirl, this is a Boris Karloff Thriller! “The Storm”\n\nDIALOGUE:\n\nLaura- “Would you mind opening a window, this house smells of…”\n\nRobbie breaks in “Death!”\n\nLaura-“No, the past, which is even worse!”\n\nRobbie-“Sure the whole world is filled with problems Miss Naomi.

There’s nobody that’s gotta puzzle over what we’re supposed to do!”\n\nNaomi-“Oh that’s so clear to me Robbie, you know what to do and you do it… I feel so free! No more aches and pains.”\n\nRobbie – “Well that’s the way you’re supposed to feel. That’s the way I want everybody to feel, I want the whole world to feel just free and light-hearted. Just kind of moves easy. Of course, I’m not so sure about you, I think you’re feeling good because you been belting that wine bottle on the side while I haven’t been looking. Have you?

And I’ll tell ya You look like one too, sit-in’ there with all those candle’s around ya.”\n\nNaomi (pointing at him) – “Well now what about the juice of the grape. Wine’s got your tongue, Robbie. Wine’s got your tongue.”\n\nRobbie –“No no no, I just got an eye for a pretty girl and I always have.”\n\n—-\n\nNaomi- “Oh but I am grateful” (she tears up)\n\nRobbie – “Ok we’re gonna have a new rule around here. From now on, we gonna cry when we peel onions, and we’re gonna laugh when we drink wine.”\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Bonfire are exquisitely brutal. There is a vicious streak that runs through the plot line. To dance an old woman into a heart attack then deny her pills whilst you sip wine. And to dump Dina Merrill’s body inside a trunk and toss it into a burning pit like trash, as he calls it. It’s malefic.\n\nRobert Evans (Peter Falk) is a revivalist preacher who on weekdays drives a cab, having come up from the Pennsylvania coal mines, He now preaches every night in a huge revivalist tent but his dream is to build his own tabernacle. Robbie is charming and attentive, however, Robert has a dark secret. He is a con man who is only interested in Naomi’s money.\n\nHe woos a rich lonely woman named Naomi Freshwater. Robbie romances Naomi, in an effort to win her confidence so that he will inherit the large house, but he can’t wait for his stroke of luck. He seduces her with wine, making her overexert herself by dancing and spinning her around so fast that she has a heart attack.\n\nInnocent of Robbie’s deception, Naomi swoons while Robbie wines and dines her. She tells him that he deserves her house because of all his kindness and regular coming to see her. As she lies dying on the sofa, Falk shot with high-contrast lighting illuminates his malevolence. While she helplessly begs for her heart pills, he watches first as she reaches out clutching her heart, then he stands over her holding the pills and allowing her to suffer. When Naomi suddenly realizes that he plans to let her die, in a moment that causes jitters she cries out, “‘Oh, Robbie! no.”\n\nRobbie is a cold monster.\n\nNaomi’s niece Laura arrives in the town where she grew up. Robbie picks up Laura Freshwater (Dina Merrill) from the train station and offers her a cab, borrowing another cabbie’s car, and takes her to the home of her recently-deceased aunt.\n\nOn the way, she sees the Gospel Mission tent. “I don’t remember a Gospel Mission here? “well it’s here now.” “You mean people are more religious than they used to be?”More anxious ma’ am, they’re more anxious.”\n\nWhen they get to the house, Robbie reveals that he already knows who she is and the kind of friendship he and her aunt shared. That Naomi left the house to him in her will, they were ‘kind of close’ and she ‘toiled right there beside me’ at his Gospel Mission.\n\nRobbie tells Laura: ‘I was with your Aunt Naomi when she passed away.’ Making himself out to be sympathetic and decent but the veneer of his kindness crackles a bit under his self-righteousness as he adds ‘She meant for me to have this house for the Mission. It didn’t work out that way but it was in her heart. She promised it to me.’ Diabolically obscuring the truth he tells her, ’The last word she said was my name.”\n\nLaura needs someone to help her clean out the house in order to get it ready for its sale, and Robbie maneuvers himself to take over the job. “You need a man. I looked around and all I could find was me.”\n\nDuring the following days, Robbie and Laura burn a collection of junk from the house in a huge bonfire out back.\n\nWe see a hint of the hidden danger in Robbie’s psyche when he discovers the garden shed has carelessly been left unlocked by the gardener’s son.\n\nAn oddly uncomfortable yet cozy relationship develops between the carefree divorcee and the intense Robbie who proclaims his past sins were wiped clean and he became a believer while he was trapped when the mine collapsed.\n\nLaura digs a little into Robbie’s life and begins to show off the flowing tongue he use to serenade Naomi with.\n\nHe tells her, “Ma’am, my wife has passed away, and my home is wherever my heart leads me, and my heart takes me where there’s work to be done.” When He figures on digging the fire pit ‘That’s deep enough to burn Sodom and Gomorrah”, he is framed by photographer Margulies in a rectangular hole that warns of a grave.\n\nRobbie narrates the riveting story, as he recollects life in the Pennsylvania mining town and the cave-in that gave rise to his faithful epiphany. Laura visits the Gospel Mission to watch the charismatic Robbie preach.\n\nLater, Laura discovers her mementos inside the old truck stored in the attic. Robbie becomes chillingly intimate with her grabbing her waist and urging her to try on a gold shoe as his hand wanders on her calf. He presumes that she should abandon her life of rambling and that what she needs is to settle down with the right man.\n\nRobbie asks her, “Do you believe in anything?” She answers, “Well, independence mostly.”\n\nBut the blithe and sophisticated Laura is too carefree to take Robbie seriously. He leaves her when he hears the mission bell ring out.\n\n“What was your wife like Robbie?” “Well, she was kinda big, kinda stubborn. She just didn’t believe in me.”\n\nAfter Robbie catches Laura modeling one of her old dresses from the trunk, in front of a mirror, they are seen drinking champagne while Laura sits on the same sofa Aunt Naomi breathed her last breath. Laura wants to hear about his wife he tells her by ”the hand of providence–she wanted me to get back in the mine.” His wife fell to her death.\n\nA specter of the scene with Aunt Naomi, Robert reenacts the same kind of scenario he prepared for the old woman by creating a romantic ambiance embellished with candlelight, the same music, and wine. They indulge in a dance, and Robbie outlines a life together in the house with children, and a woman whose “cheeks are bright with happiness because she’d fed and clothed… she’s got no need to go wandering off to see half the world because she’s got her home right here. Right in this house.” “Another vision Robert?” “Yes maybe. But not from mortal danger from being down in the mines. But from having my hopes up high.” He tells her he’ll make a good husband. But she swore she’d never marry again. “Burn it burn it. Out there in that fire pit.” “I don’t have your faith in a new life Robert.” But I told you once, I got the faith.”\n\nThough she rejects his dream of their future, the two embrace as the scene fades to black.\n\nThe following day Robbie shows up with flowers eager to see Laura again. But something has changed in her mood, and she disarms his kiss. Unsentimental, she tells him she is leaving, but he becomes defiant, believing in the enchantment of the night before and the implication that they would now be together. Once again, it exposes the illusion that he’ll ever take over the house. He argues – “What about the house… she promised it to me.” she promised to stay with him and suddenly it becomes a reality that Laura is an intruder who stands in the way of his plans. The darkness in him rises up, and below the frame, we understand that he is choking her to death. “We’re gonna ask for guidance. Now pray Laura, pray”, he chokes the words out of his mouth.\n\nMargulies’ camerawork focuses for a second time, a high contrast, dark filtered aureole around his face and eyes, only lighting the menace in his eyes. His evil is the light that encircles his head like a dark halo.\n\nThe episode turns purely terrifying, as Robbie is squeezing the life out of Laura, he flashes back to his past life and relives the moment he killed his wife.\n\nSuggested that Robbie has put Laura’s lifeless body in the heavy trunk, he drags it across the attic and struggles to maneuver it down the narrow stairs as the gardener and his son arrive to take care of the grounds.\n\nReminiscent of Hitchcockian irony, touch-and-go, subtle black humor, and nail-biting suspense, the gardener’s son played by Paul von Schreiber rings the doorbell while Robbie, now in the foyer stands alongside Laura’s makeshift coffin.\n\nThe young man asks him for the key to the toolshed, earlier Robbie had lashed out at him for leaving it unlocked. He asks the kid for help moving the trunk and has no idea of what’s inside. “A lot of trash. The house is full of trash.”\n\nRobbie dumps the trunk like garbage into the fire pit and watches as the bonfire begins to overtake it. When the night sets in, he keeps vigil over the secret engulfed in the flames. In a conjuration of hellfire, Laura goes up in smoke.\n\nHe is summoned by the mission bells, his congregation awaits this evening’s preaching. They join in “Shall We Gather By the River” as a heavy shower washes over the high energy of his sermon. The heavens have opened up and the deluge begins to restrain the fire in the pit, white smoke rising out of it but not before it has burned a considerable hole in the side of the trunk, a hole that tells about the contents inside.\n\nThe police pull up outside the tent, the gardener’s son, still anxiously awaiting Robbie’s fury, “Do you have to tell him I left the shed door open. Well, you see it always makes him mad.” He’ll know what he found in the shed after he left the door open a second time. As the police move in Robbie evangelizes “I’m gonna talk to you tonight about adversity, misfortune, and fate. Adversity. Now you take the rain. To some, it’s a blessing. We’ve all been blessed by the rain. (The police sirens sing through the torrent) But it’s when things go wrong, that’s when a man is tested. I seen a couple a things in my life I wish I hadn’t. I’ve been down deep in the mines. And I seen me a vision there. I seen my wife made obstinate by the devil. Yes, I have. To the point where I had to set her straight with these two hands. But I’ll tell you this, whenever you make a promise you gotta keep it.“\n\nCREDITS\n\nThe episode was first broadcast on December 13, 1962, and was directed by Joseph Pevney (The Strange Door 1951, Female on the Beach 1955 with Joan Crawford, and Man of a Thousand Faces 1957) an actor who started out as an actor in vaudeville in the 1920s and had a short career in film actor from 1946 to 1950, he turned to directing and was prolific in television in the 1960s and 1970s.

She also made a more sympathetic impression in films like “Sky Full of Moon” and “The High and the Mighty”, earning an Oscar nomination and receiving a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in The High and the Mighty.\n\nHowever, it was her portrayal of tough, seductive women in films like Caged (1950) where she plays the lovable kite hanger Smoochie, and Ace in the Hole (1951), and Female on the Beach (1955) that truly established her as a Hollywood star.\n\nJan Sterling in Women’s Prison 1955.\n\nBorn in Manhattan in 1921, Sterling pursued a career in acting and enrolled in Fay Compton’s dramatic school in London.

Maybe in some funny Freudian way, it was my way of getting more attention than my baby sister, who was pretty with curly hair. We all have drives we don’t completely understand.”\n\nKnown on stage as “Jane Adriance” until the 1940s. Her stage name was suggested by (Ruth Gordon), whose first suggestion was “Amethyst Adriance” because “you should name yourself after a gem.” Instead, Sterling chose to drop Adriance and shorten her first name to “Jan”; her character’s name in the play in which she was appearing.\n\nDIALOGUE-\n\nBeatrice Bartel (Sterling) “Did you hear what John was telling me?”\n\nBarty “No what was John telling you?”\n\nBeatrice “Nothing much just about one of those divorce cases he was handling.

It’s a sarcastic smile that conveys she’s not vapid, in the way Barty thinks she is.\n\nPeter Harding (Howard Duff) is a corporate executive who is friends with Philip Bartel (Dan Dailey) called Barty, whose stagnant career and lifeless marriage have made him a miserable man. When Harding takes an interest in Barty’s mistress Lorna (Bettye Ackerman), he conspires to steal her away, first arranging for Barty to be sent away on a business trip to San Francisco for an influential training course, leaving Harding behind to woo Lorna and plant the seed that Barty’s wife Beatrice has a heart condition that could prove fatal if Barty should end their marriage to be with her. Harding catches Beatrice having an affair with John. He tells them whatever they do on their own time is their business.\n\nBeatrice “Now let’s get this straight right from the start.

He tells them that his marriage is the one thread that he hangs onto. “If you divorce Barty, it’ll be the end of him,” Beatrice said she knew it all along. But John says just because he ruins everything he turns his hand to, doesn’t mean she should have to be tied to him for the rest of her life.\n\nCinematographer William Marguiles frames Dan Dailey as a giant head on the left-hand side of the screen while Jan Sterling seems to be the machination coming out of his brain.\n\nWhile Barty’s out of the picture, Harding moves in and convinces Lorna to end things with him. He even hints that Lorna has not been the first affair and that Lorna has a bad heart. and\n\nMeanwhile, Barty has gone to the chemists to purchase a poison he saw Harding use as photography chemicals in his darkroom.

Roman is an actress who possesses an authentic, rugged & earthy sensuality that was always a bit edgier than the average leading lady.\n\nShe started out modeling for the covers of pulp fiction True Detective Magazine and by the 1950s she had already appeared in major motion pictures, with an earthy sensuality and a sexy voice like whisky neat, she fits fluidly into the role of a noir beauty with a seductive edge.\n\nShe was the daughter of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman, and laundress. Ms. Roman was proud of her family’s endurance. ”For a while,” she once told a reporter, ”we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn’t pay our rent.”\n\nDropping out of high school during her second year, Ms. Roman pursued her dream of becoming an actress. She worked as a movie usher during the day and acted with the semi-professional New England Repertory Company in Boston at night. With only $200 to her name, she ventured to Hollywood and settled in a boarding house with other aspiring actresses, dubbing their residence the “House of the Seven Garbos.”\n\nFollowing her stage roles on the east coast, Roman moved to Hollywood to pursue a film career. Upon her arrival in Hollywood in 1945, there were many actresses vying for roles as cheesecake queens. However, Ms. Roman’s distinctive allure, a combination of her organic fiery aesthetic and her shapely, dark-haired charisma, set her apart from the rest. In a 1951 profile of her by Collier’s magazine, it was noted that her career had first been established on a “pervasive air of wholesomeness”, an essence that would diverge over time.\n\nShe initially landed uncredited bit parts but eventually secured leading roles in films such as the western Harmony Trail (1944) and the serial film Jungle Queen (1945), where she played the title character, marking her first credited film performance.\n\nBelle Starr’s Daughter (1948) marked Roman’s first lead role on the big screen, and she gained recognition for her performance in The Window (1949), earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. After signing a contract with Warner Bros. in the early 1950s, Following her breakthrough performance opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer’s “Champion,” which was a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prizefighter, Roman was given starring roles in nine films in under two years by Warner Brothers.\n\n“When she auditioned for a part in ”Champion,” she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter’s gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer’s office. But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ”Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,” said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film’s producer.- from The New York Times article\n\nMarilyn Maxwell would wind up getting the role of the floozy and Roman would be cast as Kirk Douglas’ tried and true wife in Champion 1949.

Roman brought a gutsy nerve to her performances in Three Secrets 1950, and paired with Steve Cochran in Tomorrow is Another Day 1951 the heat could peel the wallpaper right off the walls.

The Wadsworths consist of three grown siblings, Marianna Hill, Suzanne Zenor, and their brother ‘Baby’. The sisters along with Roman, dote on the grown man who they treat as a baby, complete with a crib, diapers, and baby bottles.

Whatever for?… Who cares how old I am? Who cares how long it was since I first played Peter Pan?’” (Gladys Cooper, as quoted in The New York Times)\n\n“Miss Cooper’s cool, aristocratic beauty and lovely voice stayed with her throughout her life, and to millions, her porcelain features became the standard beside which British womanhood was judged” – New York Times obit.\n\nThough she began as a vision of an angel she would later materialize in our collective minds as one of her notable roles – cruel, unflinching, and unsympathetic matriarchs in both Now, Voyager 1942 as Charlotte Vale’s (Bette Davis) mother and as Sibyl’s (Deborah Kerr) mother Mrs. Railton-Bell in Separate Tables 1958, both characters “are grasping and haughty and dismissive of all other points of view” “Gladys Cooper plays women who dominate their daughters, preventing them from maturing into adult women. In both films, her characters keep their daughters bound to them, not out of love, but out of a fear of loneliness.” (Kerry Fristoe)\n\nCooper with her regal way of bearing oneself is masterful at summoning an emotional manipulation that betrays frailty in her manner of speech, severe expressions, and choice of words, anyone would sink into themselves in her tyrannical presence.\n\nBette Davis who worked with Cooper in the 1940s said of the great actress that she had been “all the rage” as a young girl in London. Gladys Cooper started out as a delicate beauty, a fashionable trailblazer.\n\nShe was so striking that she was used as a photographic model beginning at six years old.\n\nIn her early life, she wanted to become an actress and started on that road in 1905 after being discovered by Seymour Hicks to tour with his company in “Bluebell in Fairyland”. In 1906, she made her debut on the London stage in “The Belle of Mayfair.” The following year, she left the legitimate stage to join the Gaiety Girls chorus in Frank Curzon’s popular entertainments at The Gaiety theater.\n\nIn 1911, she commenced work on a production of Oscar Wilde’s comedy “The Importance of Being Ernest” and soon landed other roles.\n\nCooper’s fame as an actress led to her being featured as a symbol of feminine beauty in various roles, including Juliet and many others. As the craze for postcards featuring photographs of actors swept through Britain between the 1890s and 1914, Cooper’s popularity skyrocketed and she became a sort of pin-up girl for British soldiers during World War I. Gladys Cooper began a career in the early British silent film industry starting in 1913. joined Frank Curzon to co-manage the Playhouse Theatre, continuing to work on the stage and in film in the early 1920s.\n\nAround this period, she experienced significant achievements as a stage actress. In 1919, she starred in W. Somerset Maugham’s “Home and Beauty” in London, and in 1922, she attained great success with her performance in Arthur Wing Pinero’s “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray”. She also debuted the role of Leslie Crosbie a role that Bette Davis would immortalize in the 1940 film based on Maugham’s story – “The Letter” in 1927.\n\nIn 1934, Cooper ventured into her first sound film in the UK and later brought it to Broadway as “The Shining Hour”. It was well received and she went on to star in various plays until 1938, including “Macbeth”. During this period, her talent caught the attention of Hollywood scouts, leading her to embark on a career in American films that spanned over three decades. Her first American film was Alfred Hitchcock’s debut Hollywood picture adapted to the screen from Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca 1940. Cooper was cast as Laurence Olivier’s genial sister Beatrice Lacy. She was extremely prolific in 1940s Hollywood appearing in films like Kitty Foyle 1940, and That Hamilton Woman 1941.\n\nGladys Cooper, Ginger Rogers, and Dennis Morgan in Kitty Foyle 1940.\n\nIt was her performance as Mrs. Henry Vale in Irving Rapper’s Now, Voyager that stands out as her unforgettable face of austerity. Cooper, as the unforgiving matriarch of the venerable Vale family brings to pass her neurotic daughter Charlotte’s nervous breakdown. Charlotte (Bette Davis) is demoralized and crushed of spirit from years of mental torture by a mother who enslaved her daughter by way of ferocious influence and persecution. Cooper was nothing short of monstrous. For her performance as the domineering and repressive mother, she received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe Iron Maiden, matriarch – Now, Voyager 1942.\n\nIn The Song of Bernadette 1943, she gave a stirring portrayal of Sister Marie Therese Vauzous, a scolding and unsympathetic old woman, cruel and harsh and an intensely envious authoritarian figure at the convent who punishes Bernadette for never having suffered in her life, the only way to attain God’s grace.\n\nShe played the refined Alice Duchess de Brancourt in Mrs. Parkington with Greer Garson. What followed was Green Dolphin Street 1947, The Bishop’s Wife 1947, and The Secret Garden 1949 with Hitchcock actress Isobel Elsom, who played Mme. Dupuis in Madame Bovary 1949. She began her foray into television in American television perfectly suited for dramatic teleplays – she appeared in an episode of The Alcoa Hour 1956 then she was cast in Alfred Hitchcock Presents The End of Indian Summer in 1957 where she plays a delightful black widow Marguerite Gillespie. She followed up with Suspicion, Matinee Theatre, and Playhouse 90.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Cooper appeared in several films and became a familiar face on American television, appearing in teleplays, and a variety of prime-time episodic shows, Ben Casey.\n\nRobert Redford and Gladys Cooper in The Twilight Zone’s Nothing in the Dark 1962.\n\nGladys Cooper in Night Call 1964 for The Twilight Zone.\n\nand popular sci-fi series such as 3 particularly moody episodes of The Twilight Zone- Nothing in the Dark co-starring Robert Redford as Death, Passage on the Lady Anne and Elva Keane tormented by a disembodied voice on the Telephone in the Jacques Tourneur directed episodes – Night Call, one of my favorite of the Series. She also appeared in The Outer Limits episode The Borderland 1963. The other The Alfred Hitchcock Hour Cooper appeared in was Season 3 Consider Her Ways 1964, about a dystopian society.\n\nShe debuted as Mrs. St. Maugham in Enid Bagnold’s “The Chalk Garden” in London in 1955 and brought it to Broadway in October of that year, where it ran until March 1956. In 1963 she played Mrs. Karoudjian in The List of Adrian Messenger and her last major film role was in My Fair Lady (1964), playing Henry Higgins’ mother, and the portrait of a fine lady over Higgins’ fireplace in the film was actually a painting of Cooper from 1922. Cooper also authored an autobiography in 1931 and two biographies in 1953 and 1979. In 1967, she was honored as a Dame Commander of the Order of British Empire (DBE) for her significant contributions to the field of acting. Gladys Cooper passed away in 1971.\n\nANNE FRANCIS BIO:\n\n“Most young blondes in those days [the 1950s] were not taken too seriously. I had wanted to work on a project [directing] all my own from beginning to end for many years. I had managers who said, “Look, you’re an actress. You’re not supposed to do that other business”. And now I look at all the women today who are doing it, and no one’s batting an eyelash.”- Ann Francis\n\nAnne Francis was a winsome American actress and natural beauty who began acting at a young age, modeling at 6 years old, and quickly made a name for herself in Hollywood with her beauty, glowing charm, and innate talent, perfected with her trademark dreamy eyes that are the visible light of the bluest sky, her titillating beauty mark on the right side of her mouth, and her intelligent tone.\n\nFrancis was widely regarded as one of the most talented actresses of her time. She went on to star in a number of successful films throughout her career.\n\nEarly on, she found herself involved with radio soap work and television in New York, and by age 11, she was making her stage debut on Broadway in 1941 playing Gertrude Lawrence as a little girl in the hit show – Lady in the Dark. At this time she was attending New York’s Professional Children’s School. Anne Francis is an alumna of the AADA (American Academy of Dramatic Arts), Class of 1950.\n\nDuring the years following World War II, MGM signed the promising actress with flashing blue eyes and lovely blonde hair. Although Anne appeared in a few minor roles, they didn’t amount to much. Disappointed with the superficial treatment she received in Hollywood, the determined actress returned to New York. There, she made a favorable impression in television dramas during the “Golden Age” and secretly performed in summer stock productions, including My Sister Eileen.\n\nIn 1946, when Anne Francis was 16, she went to Hollywood and was signed by MGM. She made her film debut in 1947 with the drama This Time for Keeps. At MGM she was essentially window dressing in several of their feature films with their influential stars – in 1948 she had a bit more of a substantial role in Rouben Mamoulian’s Summer Holiday with Mickey Rooney, Vincent Minnelli’s, and appeared in The Pirate starring Judy Garland and in 1948 you can only catch sight of her as a girl in the art gallery in William Dieterle’s romantic fantasy Portrait of Jennie starring Joseph Cotten, Jennifer Jones, and Ethel Barrymore. Despite being polished by the studio, she didn’t achieve much success.\n\nIn 1950, MGM loaned Francis out to United Artists to make So Young So Bad, Edgar Ulmar’s trashy low-budget B exploitation film, where she plays the provocative and troubled young teenage prostitute Loretta Wilson who has a baby and is sent to a girl’s reform school. It stars Paul Henreid as a psychiatrist. He and the nurse take action to remove the abusive leaders of a girls’ reform school and help the troubled young women find a better life.\n\nAnne Francis and MGM bid goodbye to each other, released from her contract with MGM. Francis’s performance caught the attention of Darryl F. Zanuck, who signed her to a contract with 20th Century Fox for three years.\n\nShe also started to appear in early television shows in 1949 on an episode of Suspense, Believe it Or Not, and in 1950 in the series – Lights Out and 6 episodes of Kraft Theatre in 1951. One of her memorable performances was as Jean London in Robert Siodmak’s obscure gem The Whistle at Eaton Falls in 1951.\n\nShe was then cast in two comedies with the splendidly acerbic Clifton Webb. Elopement 1951 and she was also cast as an ingenue starring in Jean Negulesco’s 1952 action adventure film Lydia Baily and in a supportive role as Carol Sayre in Dreamboat 1952 which starred Ginger Rogers and actor Jeffrey Hunter whom she would join again in future films.\n\nThe popularity of the films began to put her on the map though she strived to break free of being typecast as a minor actor. She would be cast in Raoul Walsh’s The Lion is in the Streets in 1953 starring James Cagney.\n\nShe continued to appear in dramatic television teleplays for Ford Theatre and Lux Video Theatre.\n\nAnne Francis and Robert Taylor in Rogue Cop 1954.\n\nMGM then offered Francis a role as a femme fatale in the 1954 gritty film noir Rogue Cop. Francis asked for a contract, and ultimately, she got what she wanted and appeared in the film as the fifth-billed actor, following Robert Taylor, Janet Leigh, George Raft, and Steve Forrest. The film was highly rated at the box office. Then she got the second female lead in the romantic comedy Susan Slept Here 1954, starring Dick Powell and Debbie Reynolds\n\nAfter returning to MGM, Francis found starring roles in several major feature films including playing Liz Wirth in Bad Day at Black Rock 1955, Battle Cry 1955, and The Blackboard Jungle 1955. She really had her breakout performance in the volatile drama tackling juvenile delinquency in Blackboard Jungle 1955 playing Glenn Ford’s terrorized pregnant wife Anne.\n\nIn 1956, she starred in what is perhaps her most recognizable role, as Altaira Morbius, the daughter of scientist Dr. Morbius, in the science fiction cult classic Forbidden Planet. The film has a faithful following and is widely regarded as one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare’s The Tempest.\n\nFred M. Wilcox’s science fiction/fantasy pageant – Forbidden Planet 1958 was a landmark sci-fi spectacle portraying the nubile space nymph – Altaira Morbius. A film that brought her international attention. Forbidden Planet was nominated for an Oscar In 1956.\n\nThe posters for the movie promoted the nubile Francis clad in her fashionable mini trying to escape the clutches of metalic-manhandler, presenting a very inaccurate relationship with Robbie the Robot.\n\nHelen Rose designed Anne Francis’s stylish gowns and modern-fashioned minis. Francis’ fashions were also used in Queen of Outer Space. William Tuttle is credited for makeup. When the censors got a look at her clothes before filming began, they deemed them too risqué and a whole new wardrobe was designed for the actress. It was her first of several films with Walter Pidgeon and she was fond of costar Leslie Nielsen. After her splash with Forbidden Planet even with all the hullabaloo, it became Francis’ most legendary role.\n\n🚀 Keep Watching the Skies! Science Fiction Cinema of the 1950s: The Year is 1956 – Part Two: Forbidden Planet\n\nShe made three more movies for MGM then ended her contract with the studio for the second time\n\nThen came the B airline disaster movie –The Crowded Sky 1960 playing a stewardess, and Girls of the Night 1960 director Joseph Cates starred. Anne Francis plays Bobbie a sensitive, lonely call girl who is exploited by her madame, played by Kay Medford. Francis gave a powerful performance, but unfortunately, the film went largely unnoticed. Anne Francis turned down the lead role in the film soaper Claudelle Inglish 1961, with Diane McBain filling that role though the movie bombed at the box office.\n\nDespite co-starring with some of Hollywood’s most desirable leading men, including Paul Newman and Glenn Ford, Anne Francis’s roles highlighted her glamour over the strength of her acting. That’s when her primary focus on television took off in shows like Studio One, Climax, Rawhide, and The Untouchables. In Alcoa Premier and In The New Breed 1961 episode she gave an intense performance as Phyllis Eberhardt who is assaulted by the psychotic Robert Redford in Lady Killer.\n\nNext would put her iconic face back on the map with one of the most recognized episodes of The Twilight Zone – In The After House she plays Masha White the mannequin unaware of who she really is – “Climb off it, Marsha.” She also starred as witch Jess-Belle Stone in the series episode – Jess-Belle 1963.\n\nShe found success and a non-formal groove in several television series. She received critical acclaim for her performances in Route 66 and The Fugitive. She would also appear in television series – Climax!, Rawhide, Studio One, and The Untouchables. The United States Steel Hour, and a particularly powerful performance as a spoiled movie star in the 1961 episode A Million Dollar Property of Dr. Kildare.\n\nDuring the time of Bondmania, In 1965, Francis stepped into another cultural icon, like Altaira that would stay with her, it was the role of the self-sufficient detective in Aaron Spelling’s short-lived cult series Honey West 1965.\n\nStemming from a guest appearance on Aaron Spelling’s ABC detective series starring Gene Barry’s – Burke’s Law the episode Who Killed the Jackpot?, featured Francis as detective Honey West, who engages in a battle of the wits with Barry over cracking the case of a dead wealthy banker, it sparked the spin-off pilot episode. Reaction to the episode was strong from ABC, and Spelling was given the go-ahead for a full 30-episode order of Honey West for the Fall 1965 season.\n\nAnne Francis’ exciting new character and Francis’ real persona broke ground as the outré chic Honey West making Francis a genuine pop icon, and the first proto-feminist television series featuring a comic-book style\n\ndeliciously glamorous female private eye who not only runs her own agency but can go head to head in hand to hand combat with any antagonist she comes up against. Showing off her skill in judo and karate, her mastery of weapons, proficiency in high techno devices, inventive, and a damn cool ocelot named Bruce, made her a private eye and formidable adversary in high demand.\n\nHunky John Ericson as partner Sam Bolt would often find himself grappling with Honey’s impulsiveness and lagging behind Honey’s fast and sleek white convertible AC Cobra, in his Ford Econoline van that was made to look like a TV service vehicle belonging to “H.W. Bolt & Co.” This However, this seemingly innocent van was actually packed with intricate electronic eavesdropping gadgets.\n\nAnne Francis showcased her strong female-centered/driven character which earned her a Golden Globe award for Best TV Star – Female in 1966. And, she actually took karate lessons while starring in the TV series.\n\n“A lot of people speak to me about Honey West 1965. The character made young women think there was more they could reach for. It encouraged a lot of people.”\n\nBased on a series of pulpy thrillers by authors Skip and Gloria Fickling (pen name: G. G. Fickling), Executive producer Aaron Spelling was inspired by Honor Blackman’s character Cathy Gale on another stylish crime series, The Avengers. When Diana Rigg took over as Emma Peel she became another slick, splendid, and savvy heroine of pop culture in the 1960s who could wield a gun, with her skin-tight leather outfit and high kicks, and a deadly serious, though darkly funny talent for catching criminals.\n\nHoney West only lasted one season with 30 episodes. Reportedly when ABC decided to import the British series from 1966-67 after Rigg came into the picture, though the Honey West’s ratings were strong, the network didn’t want competing shows with two trendsetting independent leading lady investigators. After Four Star Productions, bought the U.S. rights to the British The Avengers, because of the perceived similarity in the female leads, Honey West was canceled.\n\nAnne Francis’ portrayal earned her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award nomination. And her character in “Honey West” combined sex appeal with judo throws, karate chops, and modish fashions, showcasing her diverse talents.\n\nThen she was cast in 2 episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents as Julia Reddy and Nyla Foster in Hooked & Season 5 of Keep Me Company.\n\nShe starred in an episode of the series that featured intense stories of psychological turmoil – in 1963 The Eleventh Hour, Francis appeared in season 1 episode Hang By One Hand. She had roles on Kraft Suspense Theatre 1963, Death Valley Days, and Ben Casey, and she played the murderous Gervaise Ravel in two episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nAnd that brings us to Hitchcock in 1963 … The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 3 episodes What Really Happened, Blood Bargain which I’m covering here, and The Trap.\n\nFrancis later replaced actress Joan Hackett on the action/sci-fi thriller The Satan Bug 1965 directed by John Sturges. She appeared in The Invaders 1967-68 and both Mission: Impossible and The Name of the Game in 1969.\n\nAnne Francis was cast originally in a supportive role as Barbara Streisand’s sexy showgirl friend – Georgia James in Funny Girl 1968 her part was greatly reduced to a cameo appearance.\n\nShe was overjoyed to land what she thought would be 3 prominent scenes in the film, including a drunken scene, a performance as a Ziegfeld Girl, and a singing part in “Sadie, Sadie”. Despite her excitement, she later discovered that her scenes had been either completely removed or drastically hacked down by the movie’s release.\n\nFrancis was in More Dead than Alive 1969, a modern western, and in THE LOVE GOD 1969 with the inimitable Don Knotts and a co-star with comedian Jerry Lewis in Hook, Line, and Sinker 1969. None of these gratuitous roles in all three films did much to showcase Francis’ talent or boost her career\n\nin the 1960s she was back on the big screen in the sci-fi thriller directed by John Sturges – THE SATAN BUG and was superb as the slick and scheming Lorrie Benson in Brainstorm 1965, a psychological thriller directed by William Conrad (Cannon). Brainstorm is a little-known thriller starring Jeffrey Hunter who saves Francis from committing suicide by parking her car on the train tracks. She convinces him that her husband Dana Andrews is abusive and after the two fall in love, they concoct a plan to murder him. Hunter figures out a way to beat the wrap by faking insanity.\n\nFrom The Vault: Brainstorm (1965)\n\nIt was the 70s and Walter Grauman’s TV movie came along The Forgotten Man 1971 with Dennis Weaver and Lois Nettleton, Francis appeared in the 1972 TV movie Haunts of the Very Rich.

She passed away on January 2, 2011, at the age of 80. On February 8, 1960, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1611 Vine Street in Hollywood, California.\n\nAside from being a fine actress, cultural icon, and humanitarian contributed her time to charity work. She got her pilot’s license and became involved with the International New Thought Alliance, a metaphysical religious organization pursuing enlightenment.

She referred to it as a spiritual exposé. It shows how she was far more interested in spiritual enlightenment than in the superficiality of show business.\n\nDialogue for –\n\nGLADYS COOPER:\n\nMrs Raydon (Gladys Cooper) ” I think he’s dead you’ve always wanted this to happen.

Eve “I did want him But I couldn’t take care of him I had to find work I didn’t know what to do.’’ Halstead “Yes it was hard wasn’t it all that responsibility on someone young and all alone you need help so you turned to the best friend you had You let Adelaide Strain look after your child and you went off to work as a fashion model.’’ Eve “I was only studying to be a model I wasn’t trained I was making hardly any money at all The hours were long and Addy offered to take care of Gilly for me.’’ Halstead “And when you started seeing Howard Raydon you never told him about the baby.” Eve “I couldn’t I just couldn’t.’’ Halstead “Of course you couldn’t it would have spoiled everything wouldn’t it.’’ Eve “I meant to tell him someday.’’ Halstead “But you never did.

Lyn Murray’s evocative, heartwrenching score is one of the characters in the teleplay, carefully weaving the moments together with such beauty, using his woodwinds, the clarinet, and sympathetic strings to testify to Addie and Eve’s anguish.\n\nIn What Really Happened, Ann Francis plays Eve Raydon a woman accused of poisoning her husband Howard (Gene Lyons) with K-9 liniment placed in his glass of hot milk.
