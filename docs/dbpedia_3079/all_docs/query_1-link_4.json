        "text": "No.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal release date1\"The Best You Can Be\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nMiles Elliot is a copywriter at Pool Branding who lives an ordinary and routine life with his wife, Kate. His job is not going well, and he and Kate are struggling to conceive. A co-worker, Dan, tells Miles he can improve his life by going to a spa called Top Happy Spa. Despite not knowing what the spa involves, Miles decides to take a risk and spends all of his family's savings on a visit. Hours later, Miles wakes up buried in a forest, digs his way out and tries to return home. At home, he finds another version of him. After a small scuffle, the two confused Miles decide to return to the spa, which was the site of his last memory before the grave. There, Miles discovers that he has been cloned.\n\n2\"Made in a Strip Mall\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nAfter waking up in the Spa, New Miles, not knowing he is a clone, feels strange but happy. At work, his coworkers notice a positive change in him, resulting in his job proposal being universally accepted. At home, he is unusually loving and affectionate towards Kate, who likewise notices a change in him. At night, when he goes down to the living room, he bumps into his other self, the original Miles. Following an argument, they both decide to go to the Spa to find out what happened. At the Spa, Miles's clone feels overwhelmed and dissatisfied after learning the whole truth, since he knows neither why he was created nor what his purpose in life is. The original Miles tells him that he can disappear to travel the world and with no worries. The clone decides to accept the proposal, but also feels dissatisfied, since the life he wants is the one that the original Miles has.\n\n3\"Green Tea\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nAfter realizing that his clone had managed to fix his whole life for a moment, Miles decides to change himself to be more like his clone, which causes problems between the two. Miles begins to feel jealous of his clone, since everyone loves his clone but not him. During his presentation at Hillston Telecom, the owner of Hillston awards Miles's company the deal but realizes that the work proposal is not originally Miles's. After leaving Hillston's offices, Miles decides to go to celebrate the deal with his co-workers, but upon arriving at the Fridays bar, sees that his clone has taken his place. Deciding to face it, he reveals to his friends and Kate that there are two of him.\n\n4\"Soul Mate\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nKate, shocked by the revelation that there are now two of Miles, lays ground rules for the both of them, which include New Miles moving into his own apartment. New Miles, who still feels married to Kate, struggles to adjust to single life and takes a sample of her hair to have a clone of her created at the spa, only for the spa employees to reject his offer, fearing what will happen if their corporate headquarters finds out. He then decides to give online dating a try, but Kate shows up as his only match.\n\n5\"Va Bene\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nFive years before Miles's cloning, Kate and Miles suffer a miscarriage. Eager to overcome what they see as a temporary setback, they move to a house in the suburbs and express their hopes and dreams of living happily ever after together. Back to the present, they have become cold, depressed and distant. The cloning day is then shown from Kate's perspective as she has a pregnancy near-miss and fed up with Miles' listlessness decides to try her hand at online dating. After a blow-up at work and a brutal rejection from Miles, she logs on to the online dating site, finds she has matched with the clone and resolutely heads out the door for a face-to-face meeting without telling Miles.\n\n6\"Neighbors and Friends\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nMiles finally goes through with his appointment at the fertility clinic. He finds that the success of the clone's ad campaign hangs on the outcome of a small-town referendum and sneaks into the meeting to gleefully watch it fail. When it becomes obvious his own fate is tied up in the success of the referendum and with the clone nowhere to be seen, he reluctantly intervenes and persuades some of the locals to vote in favor of Hillston. His ploy works, but costs him his friendship with Farmer Ray. He returns home and frantically tries to contact the clone after finding out that he hasn't gone to work all week. Just as he spots the clone approaching, someone throws a bag over his head.\n\n7\"Pi√±a Colada\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )\n\nOne week before Mile's abduction, Kate invites the clone to go with her on her business trip into the city. They sleep together, but after a few days, things become uncomfortable between them, Kate realizes she has made a mistake. The clone goes to the bar to get drunk but runs into Dan and instead decides to take him to the woods and show him what really happened that day in the spa. The next day, the clone buys an abduction kit, and just as he heads towards the house, a van drives up and two men jump out and abduct Miles. The clone walks into the house and begins to impersonate Miles.\n\n8\"Nice Knowing You\"Jonathan Dayton & Valerie FarisTimothy GreenbergOctober 18, 2019 ( )"
