His presence creates chaos in her family's humble Fulham home. At first the others do not believe he is a prince, but he has a locket that Nicholas II, the last tsar, gave to his now-deceased mother. Gladys's father works in the diamond trade and confirms that the jewels on it are valuable diamonds. Felix does not want to sell them for his own sake, but is persuaded by Mr. Wallis to let him do so, as it will benefit the family.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nIvor Novello as Prince Felix Lenieff\n\nUrsula Jeans as Gladys Wallis\n\nIda Lupino as Ada Wallis\n\nMinnie Rayner as Mrs. Wallis\n\nEliot Makeham as Mr. Wallis\n\nCicely Oates as Flossie Williams\n\nJack Hawkins as Mort [Gladys's boyfriend]\n\nBeryl Harrison as Miss Violet Bradshaw\n\nDouglas Beaumont as Albert Wallis [Gladys's brother]\n\nMolly Fisher as May Sawley (as Mollie Fisher)\n\nVictor Bogetti as Thornton [Ada's boyfriend]\n\nDavina Craig as Maggie\n\nHannah Jones\n\nAgnes Imlay\n\nMaud Buchanan\n\nGwen Floyd\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nTV Guide wrote, \"originally a play by Novello, who transplanted almost the entire cast for the filmed version, the main exception to the stage cast being Lupino, who gave a strong emotional performance.\"[3] and the Radio Times wrote, \"it's all directed with a teasingly respectable salaciousness by Maurice Elvey, but of much greater interest to most film fans will be the pre-fame performances of Jack Hawkins and Ida Lupino.\"[2] and BBC Wales Arts wrote, \"this is a riotously funny film and Novello not for the first or last time on screen, operates, tantalisingly, on different layers. He's always aware of his screen spectator in the dark, but don't be misled - this performance doesn't reek of the greasepaint in the least. It's just that Novello has the rare ability to maintain a playful, ironic stance which many critics, even today, seem incapable of appreciating or recognising.\"[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nLow, Rachael.
