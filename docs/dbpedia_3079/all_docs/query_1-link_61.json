        "text": "The way Shakespeare resonates in the lives of five luminaries from around the globe is the subject of the Living Shakespeare series from BBC World Service.\n\nThe series has been produced to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, in partnership with the British Council and The Open University.\n\nAll the world really is a stage as we hear from five luminaries as they explore the playwright’s resonance in their lives - from actor Dr John Kani who recounts his experiences playing Othello in Apartheid South Africa, to Scottish musician Dame Evelyn Glennie who demonstrates how deafness is no impediment to hearing The Tempest.\n\nBollywood actor Kalki Koechlin finds parallels between Hamlet’s Ophelia and women in India today, writer Hong Ying shines a light on sexuality and Shakespeare’s sonnets in contemporary China and choreographer Alissar Caracalla reimagines A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the mountains of Lebanon.\n\nAs well as the contributors featured by the BBC World Service, the British Council has also published essays by other exceptional cultural, social and political figures who share their personal experience with the Bard’s works, including US Secretary of State John Kerry, Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka and renowned Algerian novelist Ahlem Mosteghanemi.\n\nThe Open University is a co-funder of the project, and provided academic consultation and expertise throughout the process.\n\nIn this episode, acclaimed South African actor Dr John Kani recounts his experiences playing Othello at The Market Theatre in Johannesburg during 1987, at the height of apartheid South Africa.\n\nLooking back he takes stock on how far the country has come, but also the continued relevance of the play in a still-divided society.\n\nIn this episode, Hong Ying, author of ‘Daughter of the River’ looks at Shakespeare’s sonnets as they relate to sexuality and love in China.\n\nBanned during the Cultural Revolution, Shakespeare later became a cultural touchstone for Hong Ying and other artists in the 80s.\n\nNow, the sonnets are taking on a new resonance amongst the gay community of China today.\n\nIn this episode, Dame Evelyn Glennie talks us through her unique way of hearing and interpreting Shakespeare’s The Tempest.\n\nAs a musician, she hears the sounds in the words of the characters. And as she just happens to be profoundly deaf, this takes on new meaning as she uses her ability to hear with her whole body to explore the ‘sound colours’ in the text."
