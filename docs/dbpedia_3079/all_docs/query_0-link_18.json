I am enormously grateful to Professor Ted Braun and Sarah Braun, Professor Christine Gledhill, Professor Lynda Nead, Professors Richard Dyer and Richard Taylor, Dr Tag Gronberg and putative Professor Charlie Gere for their support and encouragement way beyond the course of duty. Alison Butler has taught me anything I know about teaching this stuff. Special thanks are due to to Susie Painter, Margaret Deriaz, Aliki Roussin-Croney, Maisoon Rehani, Tamerlan Dzhabrailov, Reimar Volker, PC 1479 (Trinity Road, Bristol) and the paramedics for getting me through the most ghastly bits. Dr Toby Haggith – and as per above and below – of the Imperial War Museum, Dave Berry of the Welsh Film and Television Archive, Elaine Burrows (NFTVA), Jenny Hammerton (British Pathé – I think you’ll find more about knitting here than in any other book on British Cinema), Ine van Dooren (South East Film and Video Archive), Frances Carlyon (University of Bristol Theatre Collection) and the John Rylands Library in Manchester all supplied me with materials. Twentieth Century Flicks is due thanks not only for its extensive back catalogue but for the tolerance of its staff towards my daily grumbles – and yes, Ben, I will buy a DVD player now! At the BFI, thanks are due to Bryony Dixon, Kathleen Dickson, (I.Gotyer) Steve Tollervey, June Macmillan, Janet Moat (Special Materials) and the underappreciated library staff. Stephen Bottomore, Tony Fletcher (Cinema Museum), Pamela Hutchinson, Jeremy Jago, Dr Mike Allen, Dr Jim Ellis and Kate Myers (Academy Productions) all allowed themselves to be cajoled into reading draft chapters; Dr Lawrence Napper, Professor Nick Cull and Sigrid Schnögl undertook the onerous task of reading the whole manuscript (thanks also to Erich and Charlotte). Where I have ignored their sound advice, sheer exhaustion is my only excuse. I am especially grateful to Andrew Lockett, who commissioned the book and put up with an extraordinary amount of bolshiness on my part, and to Sophia Contento, who saw it through to completion.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage vii\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis book is intended to provide a survey of three centuries of film production, distribution and exhibition in Britain. It is also concerned with the larger institution of cinema. It outlines the reception of films by various audiences and various critics (in the trade press, the regular press and journals) and refers to spaces of film viewing (from the fairground to the fleapit, from the dream palace to the multiplex, from home-viewing to amateur and workplace societies, to video-hire, the internet and the gallery). The book mostly covers a selection of films that were actually made and released, although the vicissitudes of intervention from government and other funding and regulatory authorities, to aid and abet this process, are also brought into the discussion. Like most histories, this one is organised chronologically but a number of notions are reiterated across its chapters: the relationship with Europe (the movement of people, ideas and the nature of the marketplace); the relationship with America; certain themes, character types and recurrent models of society (including lodging houses, schools, prisons, hospitals, ships, city streets, villages and the country house). Equally pervasive are certain representations of the social and physical landscape of Britain itself: the town versus the countryside; the country and the coast; the metropolis; the suburbs; the highlands and islands; old industry and new money; regional and class mobility. Consequently, I am as much concerned with a shared imaginative history as with the peculiarities of British life witnessed at any particular point in time. This broader perspective informs the selection of the case studies at the end of each chapter. In chapters devoted to the First and Second World Wars, I refer to later decades in order to demonstrate that subsequent portrayals have owed much to conventions established and affirmed in the duration: as with many historical dramas, these often resort to the use of archival fictional and non-fictional footage to establish their credentials. Sometimes I have taken the liberty of stretching a decade where national or film history seems to require it (for instance, the 1930s begins with the introduction of sound in the 1920s, the 1970s begin around 1968 and 1979 leaks into the 1980s). British cinema is no longer (in the words of Alan Lovell) ‘uncharted territory’. However, I have been especially concerned to integrate the early decades of British cinema into the whole, recognising the artificiality of ‘bracketing-off’ its first thirty years. Few film historians of British cinema (Rachael Low, Christine Gledhill, Charles Barr and Andrew Higson are notable exceptions) have considered the silent period worthy of equal attention to its more recent past. This is a great shame. In terms of the above generic interests and in the personnel involved (directors such as Anthony Asquith, Alfred Hitchcock, Maurice Elvey, Michael Powell, Walter Forde and Noël Coward;\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage viii\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\nviii\n\nproducers such as Herbert Wilcox and Michael Balcon; designers such as Andrew Mazzei and Edward Carrick; actors such as Gordon Harker, Ivor Novello, Raymond Massey and Betty Balfour) the distinction seems entirely arbitrary and merits reappraisal. There is much, I contend, which aligns early cinema programming with current television scheduling and variable viewing patterns; film series and serials of the teens attracted audience loyalty in the manner of previous literary precursors and radio and television successors. I have also sought to re-examine a number of preconceptions about British cinema. With Alan Bennett, I find myself in disagreement with a stance which identifies American policy and practice as a standard for imitation and emulation. Sometimes (as the collapse of British Lion, Goldcrest and Palace Pictures amply demonstrates) such a policy has proven misplaced. Meanwhile, British acting talent (from Victor McLaglen to Samantha Morton) has proven to be one of the native industry’s most successful exports to Hollywood – an achievement that merits celebration. Collaborations with Europe (as in the 1920s, 1930s, 1960s and 1990s) appear a more useful development as a means of ensuring that non-American films secure comparable admission to British screens, both small and large. British cinema has frequently been lambasted for its reliance on other areas of cultural practice for its source material, as if this were a weakness. Indeed, this complaint is frequently voiced in Rachael Low’s multi-volume History of the British Film, which remains invaluable to any contemporary historian, critic or enthusiast. However, this tendency is far from unique to British cinema, as a national cinema, and European and American film-makers have also chosen British material for adaptation (from the ‘classics’ to J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan, from Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley series to Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity and Alan Ayckbourn farces). Broadway has embraced musical versions of The Full Monty (1997) and Billy Elliot (2000); The Ladykillers (1955), Alfie (1966) and The Italian Job (1969) have been flattered by imitation. I am disposed to regard the integration of British cinema in a larger cultural map as one of its strengths and an enormously fruitful area for enquiry. The hybridity and eclecticism of British cinema should be deemed a virtue rather than a vice. Nor should this relationship be regarded as entirely predatory: while cinema has drawn from novels and plays and the visual arts, these in turn have taken cinema as a source for imagery and inspiration (for instance, Forkbeard’s Shooting Shakespeare, Terry Johnson’s staging of Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick, stage versions of The Third Man and Billy Elliot and Matthew Bourne’s choreography of Play Without Words). Both Evelyn Waugh and Edgar Wallace produced novels in which aspects of the British industry feature; Wallace, Arnold Bennett, Alan Bennett, J. B. Priestley, Graham Greene and Ian McEwan have written for page and screen; Coward, Terence Rattigan, Shelagh Delaney, John Osborne, Harold Pinter and David Hare have written for stage and screen; numerous British actors, directors and technicians have moved between stage, television and film, and singers and models have turned actors. In other words, I am keen to stress exchange rather than derivation. Contemporary film and television producers (and gallery installation artists) even assume a familiarity with Britain’s cinematic heritage in their quotation from older texts and established genres (I am thinking of various Aardman Animation productions, Victoria Wood’s Bond spoof enacted in a London Eye capsule, French and Saunders’ evocation of cos-\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage ix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nix\n\ntume dramas set in ‘olden days’, the Trainspotting [1995] Bond girls debate and Steve Coogan’s mountain bike chase through Manchester in The Parole Officer [2001], mimicking The Italian Job). There is also another form of critical segregation which I have attempted to avoid. Subjects, iconography and the careers of personnel often move between different types of film appealing to different audience taste and are shared between ‘high-brow’ (or art house) and ‘low-brow’ (or popular) production, let alone the much (and repeatedly) maligned ‘middle-brow’. Michael Gough can be seen in 1950s Hammer Horror (Arthur Crabtree’s Secrets of the Black Museum), in Ealing’s The Man in the White Suit (1957) and in Joseph Losey’s eminently respectable (and respectful) version of The Go-Between (1970); Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Show (1975) and The Ploughman’s Lunch (1983); Hattie Jacques in repertory in the Carry Ons and alongside Lindsay Anderson in The Pleasure Garden (1952). Martin Campbell’s directorial career can be traced from soft porn (Eskimo Nell [1974]) to a musical (Three for All [1974]) to television (Edge of Darkness [1986]) to Bond (Goldeneye [1995]). The great Billie Whitelaw, muse to Samuel Beckett, filmed for television in Not I (1977) and Happy Days (1979), appears in gritty film noir (Hell is a City [1960]) and quality adaptation (An Unsuitable Job for a Woman [1981]). Often I question the critical usefulness of the inherited categories and vocabulary. The once rigid ‘art-house’ distinction loses much of its status when the omniverous DVD or video renter has freer access to all sorts of different films. What this book is not is a history of box-office hits. In the selection of films recommended and discussed I have been led pretty much by personal preference. However, there are films covered here which, although a popular success when first released, seem to have been critically neglected since (such as Sunshine Susie [1931]). There are often many other films that could serve as examples of the various themes used to organise the chapters: this, in itself, seems to prove their validity. Some very well-known films (such as The Rat series, Genevieve [1953], Victim and Chariots of Fire [1981]) have been largely by-passed because they have been dealt with adequately elsewhere. Nor am I overly concerned with defining the particularity of British cinema as a product distinct from that of other nations. I am more concerned here with interpreting and resuscitating the films themselves than with reiterating the sometimes ossifying academic debates which have accrued around them. I want to convey a sense of why – or, sometimes, why not - British audiences valued and enjoyed them (what they looked like, sounded like and felt like), of the circumstances in which they were experienced and why they continue to be worth watching now.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage x\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 1\n\nChapter 1 Turn of the Century and Tens\n\nThe job of the film maker, is to entertain as many people as possible. The questions of raising tastes and education are there too – but they are asides. Entertainment counts and it is the most difficult thing of all. You can affect an audience three ways – you can make them laugh, make them cry, and make them sit forward in their seats with excitement. You should never degrade them . . . We are in the show business now, and we come from the fairground and the fairground barker. The barkers may have worn checked coats and crude colours, while we are more elegant. But never forget, we are the same. It is show business – and we should make a good show. Alexander Korda1\n\nThe willingness of an international film-maker and entrepreneur of the next generation, such as Korda (see Chapter 5), to embrace cinema’s fairground heritage is both selective and provocative. Certainly, many of his contemporaries (producers, distributors, exhibitors, audiences and commentators) might have preferred to trace other lines of descent – for instance, from music halls, lecture halls and domestic entertainments. Certainly, elements of both ‘realism’ and ‘tinsel’ were present in early film shows, often sitting alongside one another in a single programme, in the manner which continues in much television scheduling today.2 But, at the outset, Michael Balcon’s infamous distinction (see Chapter 7) was less significant than the phenomenon of film itself. While frequently inheriting subject matter and techniques from other, older, areas of cultural practice, the very novelty of film was its first and principal attraction for audiences. As with current commercial television broadcasting, items could be sponsored by manufacturers (as in the 1906 G. H. Cricks and J. H. Martins film, A Visit to Peak Freans Biscuit Works) and adverts were made on film (following the example of lantern slides) for Bird’s Custard, Dewar’s Whisky, Ogden’s Cigarettes, Lever Brothers’ Sunlight Soap and Nestlé; Lever Brothers also provided lecturers and operators for charity screenings and devised various promotional tie-ins.3 Machines which doubled as cameras and projectors (such as Birt Acres’ Birtac – patented in 1898) encouraged amateur use of the new medium, these often produced in a variety of casings to suit different budgets and settings.4 As a novelty, it was also often regarded with some scepticism by competitors and potential investors, and producers and exhibitors sought to sustain the novelty (with the introduction of new subjects and longer formats) beyond its programming as a single item in a mixed bill. As with current hybrid Superimposition in Clarendon’s The Tempest (Percy Stow, 1908)\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n2\n\n‘infotainment’, drama-documentary and ‘docusoap’, it can prove difficult to categorise the products of Britain’s film pioneers. Sometimes these pioneers were more interested in the apparatus than they were in the material projected, this dominating the bill as the principal attraction.\n\nInforming: The Tatler and Tit Bits The first public demonstration of film projection in Britain is usually dated to the showing of the French Lumière cinematograph at Regent Street Polytechnic in February 1896. But on the same day, R. W. Paul (a maker of scientific instruments) exhibited his ‘Theatrograph’ at Finsbury Technical College. John Barnes suggests that Paul constructed his machine following illustrations of the Edison Kinetoscope, shown at the 1895 India Exhibition at Earls Court and previously illustrated in American magazines with a wide distribution in Britain. Paul, in collaboration with the American Birt Acres, then set about manufacturing a camera in order to produce films to use in the projector; Paul also sold equipment to France. Some early British film-makers (a ‘chance agglomeration’, says Rachael Low, ‘of adventurers, crusaders and craftsmen’5), such as the Brighton pioneers, James Williamson and George Albert Smith, and William Friese Greene, came to film from photography. Cecil Hepworth, the son of a photographer (who also wrote about photography), came to film from magic lantern exhibition and lecturing, working for the Warwick Trading Company (an American subsidiary) before setting up his own company;6 the Yorkshire firm, Bamforth, produced slides, then films (notably the Winky series of the teens) and postcards. Certain subjects of early single-reel, single-shot films (such as Acres’ Sea at Dover [1895], Rough Sea [1900], Paul’s Breaking Waves [1900] and Biograph’s blue-tinted 1900 Feeding the Seagulls, showing birds swooping in the wake of a ship’s stern) feature movement within the frame and movement towards or away from the camera as their focus of interest. Others, such as the 1900 Biograph film of Clifton Suspension Bridge and Avon Gorge, take a well-known fixed landmark and employ a camera pan as an additional feature. But even the earliest programmes included newsworthy items, where the subject matter attracted attention. Sporting events contributed topical variety and proved enduringly popular. Regular events in the calendar (such as Henley Regatta, the Boat Race, horse racing, fencing, golf, football matches, cricket matches – including films of W. G. Grace and Ranjitsinhji) were inserted alongside such Tit Bits novelties as boxing cats and kangaroos: such material could be substituted by travelling exhibitors according to particular times and places. People came to see themselves (in the numerous films of sea fronts, factory gates, city streets and spectator sports) and to see celebrities. The life of the former prime minister, William Gladstone, was recorded in Gladstone Sketches and his demise was memorialised in Smith’s film of his funeral. The final years of Queen Victoria’s reign, notes Lytton Strachey, ‘were years of apotheosis. In the dazzled imagination of her subjects Victoria soared aloft towards the regions of divinity through a nimbus of purest glory.’7 While the Prince of Wales’ horse, Persimmon, was filmed by Paul winning the blue riband at the 1896 Derby, and the film of the 1898 Derby was shown at Buckingham Palace within a few hours of its being made, Princess Maud’s wedding was photographed by\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n3\n\nAcres in a series of episodes from ‘The Departure of the Bride from Marlborough House’ to her ‘Arrival after the Wedding’ and ‘Going Away’. The stage paper, The Era, reports that these scenes were shown to large audiences, prompting loud cheers.8 A Royal Command Performance was given at Marlborough House and Acres duly marketed the film on condition that his projection equipment was included in the purchase of the print. Royal Command Performances of the 70mm Biograph were given for the Prince of Wales at St James’s Palace and Sandringham. In 1900, the Queen was filmed on her visit to Dublin; in 1897, the Prince of Wales was filmed yachting in Nice, reviewing Yeomanry at Cheltenham and the Fire Brigade at Windsor. In 1896, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas allowed us into their beautiful home at Balmoral, J. and F. Downey (a Southshields subsidiary of a London firm accustomed to photographing the Queen) taking shots of carriages, children and various dogs. The event was amply illustrated and covered by the Lady’s Pictorial: ‘Her Majesty was delighted with the animated photographs . . . After her Majesty’s departure, some of the Royal children came behind the screen and displayed much curiosity as to the working of the views . . .’.9 Again, a private screening was arranged at Windsor before (with Royal endorsement) the film was distributed to the general public, together with a series of slides to be projected during the change-over of reels. Foreign royalty (Dutch, Russian, Danish) and the Pope also made early appearances, with the crowning of Queen Wilhelmina in Amsterdam being filmed and projected within forty-eight hours in London. In 1897, films of the pageantry marking the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee were greeted enthusiastically. The Optical and Magic Lantern Journal proclaimed that, ‘even in the smallest out-of-the-way villages it would be a difficult matter to find many persons who have not seen this interesting event on the screen’.10 In Bradford, The Daily Argus organised a screening at midnight (to an audience of thousands) of the film made in London by R. J. Appleton and Co. earlier in the day. At the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, the cameras again jostled for prime position along the route of the cortège and Hepworth recalls that he was obliged to print copies of his film ‘night and day’ to fulfil public demand.11 One film, fixing its frame at a bend in the road, captures the procession in the background moving left to right, snaking round to appear again in the foreground moving right to left, recording successive detachments of uniformed riders, groomed and plumed horses, carriages and gun carriages. Such exhibitions of regal and military pomp and ceremony were spectacularly enhanced by the introduction of colour. The Bioscope in 1908 reports the Kinemacolor process (invented and demonstrated by Smith and the American Charles Urban), while Kine Weekly remembers previous experiments with coloured discs performed by Friese Greene. Smith chose a march-past of the Lancers as a subject which would display his system to best effect (scarlet uniforms similarly employed in Technicolor and Technirama for Zulu [Cy Endfield, 1964]).12 But there were also concerns that the film camera might present these elevated persons in an inappropriate manner: Acres inadvertently captured the Prince scratching his head at Cardiff’s Exhibition of Industry and Arts in 1896 and, in 1908, The Bioscope indicates ‘the regulation of access’ of cameras to Sandringham: ‘His Majesty holds no objection to being filmed at public ceremonies but is very strict where his own private movements are concerned.’13 ‘Informal’ films of the Royals, such as The Royal Family\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n4\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\nat Afternoon Tea in the Garden of Clarence House (1897), were, as Stephen Bottomore suggests, staged as a photo-opportunity;14 the 1912–13 tour of industrial Britain and First World War films showing encounters with the King’s troops were conceived as propaganda (see Chapter 3). The Delhi Durbars of 1903 and 1911 were intended to affirm India’s place as ‘the most splendid appanage of the Imperial Crown’ and to acclaim the King of Britain as Emperor. The Dowager Empress of Russia found the Kinemacolor film of the second event ‘wonderfully interesting and very beautiful [giving] one the impression of having seen it all in reality’; in some theatres it ran for more than a year after the event.15 The Viceroy, Lord Curzon, staged the 1903 Durbar with consummate attention to detail and little regard to economy: some commentators accused him of extravagance and a craze for display.16 The Tatler, in December 1902, provided a photo-spread showing the Duke of Connaught, Lord Kitchener (Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army) and their hosts, the Viceroy and Vicereine with pictures of the locations of the ceremony’s principal events; in January 1903 it pictured the 11 foot-high elephant on which the Duke rode in the Durbar and the howdah (made of pure gold and silver) lent by the Maharajar of Benares. Paul’s film of the Durbar records mounted and foot regiments of the Indian Army as they process past the dais, 209 smaller elephants and the Durbar’s honoured guests (the ruling Indian princes\n\nMitchell and Kenyon record Manchester’s Whitsuntide Catholic Procession (27 May 1904)\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n5\n\nwith their attendants). The event also included sports, music and competitions alongside the ceremonials.17 The journal Black and White, in January 1903, shows a society lady in the stalls at London’s Hippodrome watching the film through opera glasses, presumably attempting to identify the indistinct figures in the crowd. More humdrum and regional pageantry was recorded in topical films of actual events in Hackney (the horse and cart parade), Coventry, Carisbrooke, St Albans, Oxford, Romsey and Bury St Edmunds; often one can see someone directing the action in front of the camera. In similar mode, Hepworth’s 1903 film of Lewis Carroll’s 1865 Alice in Wonderland (closely following Tenniel’s illustrations for the original publication – and offered for sale as separate scenes and in its entirety) includes the Queen and her playing-card entourage (played by children) processing past the camera, with his wife as the white rabbit and his cutting-room assistant, Mabel Clark, as Alice.18 Mitchell and Kenyon filmed the Manchester Catholics Whitsuntide Procession (recreated at a smaller scale for the Salford of David Lean’s 1954 Hobson’s Choice) and May Day celebrations and the annual well-dressings in Derbyshire. Films of troops departing for and arriving from service overseas (‘History on Tap’) provided further opportunities for local audiences to recognise themselves and their loved ones on screen (see Chapter 3). Conversely, in Rudyard Kipling’s 1904 short story ‘Mrs Bathurst’ a group of cockney tars holed-up in South Africa discuss the fate of Vickery, who went AWOL in demented pursuit of a touring circus which showed films of ‘Home and Friends’ between the performing animals: London Bridge with the omnibuses – a troopship goin’ to the war – marines on parade at Portsmouth an’ the Plymouth Express arrivin’ at Paddin’ton . . . it was most interestin’. I’d never seen it before. You ’eard a little dynamo like buzzin’, but the pictures were the real thing – alive an’ movin’ . . . We saw the platform empty an’ the porters standin’ by. Then the engine come in, head on, an’ the women in the front row jumped: she headed so straight.19\n\nVickery believed he saw the young Auckland widow, Mrs Bathurst, among the passengers alighting from the train and that she had arrived in London to search for him. There was also evidence of criminals imitating scenarios enacted in films and of others being apprehended as a consequence of being caught on camera.20 Occasionally, the camera is an unwelcome intrusion; more often its subjects prove willing and eager to have themselves photographed and acknowledge its presence. Films of military manoeuvres were sometimes shot as actuality (as in Joseph Rosenthal’s Boer War footage for Warwick and by Frederic Villiers – a newspaper photographer for the Graphic, the Standard and Black and White – and, reputedly, by others in the Sudan in 1898).21 Army and navy exercises and drilling were a recurrent subject. The Bioscope in 1909 advertises an Empire Picture showing the work of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry Corps, with ‘the ladies under War Conditions’. Sometimes (as Stephen Bottomore and Simon Popple have observed) war films were shamelessly fabricated to satisfy an audience’s appetite for stories of current interest, although the Warwick Trading Company maintained that it distributed nothing but the genuine\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n6\n\narticle and warned that the showing of fakes would harm the reputation of an exhibitor.22 Williamson’s 1901 Attack on a Chinese Mission represents the Boxer uprising in China by means of a dramatic rescue narrative. But, as Kevin Brownlow maintains, such staged war films should not be dismissed as merely duplicitous.23 Early factual films match the content of newspapers and periodicals, from the mass circulation Tit Bits to the more exclusive Tatler. True stories proved as popular with viewers as with readers. The first specialised news cinema, the Daily Bioscope, opened opposite Liverpool Street station in London in 1906 (a precursor of the news cinema in Charing Cross Road in which the fugitive hides in They Drive By Night [1938] – see Chapter 7) while newsreels were launched with The Topical Budget in 1911 (see Chapter 4).\n\nEducating: Travellers and Tourists The turn of the century’s World Fairs provided a site for the demonstration of apparatus and material for film-makers. In Warwick Trading Company’s 1900 film of the Paris Exhibition (also documented by Hepworth), the camera, attached to the side of a boat, pans along a line of exotic national pavilions constructed on pontoons and on the river bank. ‘Virtual’ travel was also offered by Hales Tours (introduced to London in 1906) where, from mock railway carriages running on tracks, patrons could watch phantom ride films (photographed by a camera mounted on the front of a train) to the accompaniment of suitable sound effects. Smith, a fixture in the 1900 schedule at the Brighton Aquarium, presented slide shows of an ‘Astronomical Entertainment’ (The Glories of the Heavens, or a Tour through Space) and (inspired by Jules Verne) Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, concluding the bill with a selection of his own short films. H. G. Wells’ 1895 The Time Machine, set in the year 802,701 (in which the protagonist, attempting to convince the assembled journalist, editor, psychologist and medical man of the veracity of his claim to have travelled through time, bemoans, ‘If only I had thought of a Kodak!’),24 was the inspiration for an unrealised project of R. W. Paul, ‘in which animated photographs formed an essential part’: In a room capable of accommodating some 100 people, he would arrange seats to which a slight motion could be given. He would plunge the apartment into Cimmerian darkness, and introduce a wailing wind. Although the audience actually moved but a few inches, the sensation would be of travelling through space. From time to time the journey would be combined with panoramic effects. Fantastic scenes of future ages would first be shown. Then the audience would set forth upon its homeward journey. The conductor would regretfully intimate that he had over-shot the mark, and travelled into the past – cue for another series of pictures. Mr Paul had for a long time been at work on this scheme . . .25\n\nPaul’s 1901 The Countryman and the Cinematograph refers to apocryphal accounts of earlier audiences ducking or fleeing when faced with films of oncoming trains, footage of a dancer, the train and then the country film explainer himself (spooning with a milkmaid) superimposed in the frame.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n7\n\nPaul produced The Arrival of the Paris Express at Calais (1896), in imitation of Lumière’s famous The Arrival of a Train at Ciotat (1895). Train films were regularly inserted into a mixed programme, increasingly with the camera positioned at the side of the train to maximise a panoramic, sweeping view. Many films, locally made, captured views of tramways and streets familiar to their audiences (for instance, Mitchell and Kenyon’s films of Sheffield).26 Some of the tourist films captured the views once often used, as photographs, to decorate the interiors of railway carriages: picturesque views of Bournemouth (filmed in 1911), the Scottish Highlands (1908), the Cornish Riviera (1904). Mitchell and Kenyon photographed holidaymakers in Blackpool, subsequently projecting the films to their subjects. Cricks and Sharp combined natural history with spectacular views in their 1907 film of collectors climbing for birds’ eggs at Flamborough Head. A Holiday Trip to the Clyde Coast of Scotland (1909), made to promote the London and North Western Railway, includes scenes at Glasgow station, the interior of a dining carriage, rural scenery and a shipyard, ‘The Birthplace of Navies’. More adventurous would-be travellers were delighted by scenes of The Great Victoria Falls (1907), The Alhambra, Gibraltar (1911), Life in Jaffa (1905), Native Life in Borneo (1909), Kashmir (1903) and Shanghai (1901). Moonlight Trip on the Nile (1909), directed by Scott-Brown for Hepworth, used colour staining and toning (red for firelight, blue for night) to enhance its exotic appeal. Sometimes, travelogue was combined with an informative record of a particular manufacturing or agricultural process – for instance, whaling or date-farming. These leavened a heavy diet of films recording domestic agriculture, fishing and industry, which, according to The Bioscope in 1909, failed to entertain a considerable percentage of the audience (suggesting that poor explanation of the material was partly to blame), although Kine Weekly reports in 1907 that the Bryant and Mays girls ‘made strenuous efforts to locate themselves and their acquaintances’ in a film of their factory. Hepworth’s 1903–4 A Day with the Hop Pickers portrayed ‘East-end coster women, plain of face but sharp of wit’, with their ‘dishevelled children’, in the annual exodus to Kent (see Chapter 2).27 A Visit to the Sunlight Soap Works (continuing Lever Brothers’ patronage of film) was advertised in 1907, alongside Hepworth’s film of chain-making at Sykes and Son, Cradley Heath (showing iron bars, beating, welding etc.), Gaumont’s From Forest to Fireside (illustrating the production of Lloyd’s News from the felling of timber in Norway to the making of paper from pulp to the setting of print etc.) and Walturdaw’s Making of a Modern Newspaper. In 1905, LNWR sponsored (and exhibited at White City) The Building of a British Railway. A Day in the Life of a Coalminer, produced in 1910 by the Kineto Company (specialists in education and actuality films), punctuates its narrative with titles: ‘The Pit Head’; ‘The Coal Shaft’; ‘Pay Time’; ‘Light after Darkness’; ‘The Belles of the Black Diamond Field’ (indicating the women who push trucks, load wooden props and sort, screen and rake the coal). Part of the process (the men’s work at the coalface) is staged in daylight. The film opens with a coalminer kissing his wife and children goodbye in the morning and finishes, ‘Light after Darkness’, with a child running from the same cottage to greet him; meanwhile, at ‘A Cosy Fireside’ a maid stokes a fireplace for a middle-class family enjoying the fruits of the miners’ labour. A Visit to Peak Freans Biscuit Works similarly uses titles to announce\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n8\n\nBiscuit making at Peak Freans (Cricks and Martin, 1906)\n\nsuccessive episodes in the manufacturing process, progressing from opening general views to concentrate on specific activities (‘Rolling out the Dough’; ‘Making Brighton Biscuits’; packing, weighing, labelling and soldering tins for export). The camera pans left to right, following the conveyor belt which feeds the biscuits into the ovens. An untoward incident (‘A False Alarm of Fire’) provides a dramatic interlude in the morning routine (an engine on a cart is trundled out for practice) before the workhands leave for dinner (walking towards camera, in the manner of earlier factory gate films) and the film ends with Peak Freans vans departing the factory to deliver the goods. The sponsorship of such ‘actuality’ films may be compared, as Rachael Low has observed, with many notable ‘documentary’ films of the 1930s (see Chapter 5), and of the 1950s.28 While film had early established itself in public lecture halls, institutes and clubs, there were also calls in the trade press for its introduction as an educational aid in schools. It would be, said a contributor to The Bioscope in 1908, ‘the newspaper and book of tomorrow’. The journal vaunted the potential of film to portray ‘the natural history, engineering, architectural, commercial and artistic achievements of the rest of the world’.29 In 1907, an exhibition of Colonial pictures (intended for use in schools) was held at the Royal Agricultural Halls. At Warwick Trading Company, the enterprising Charles Urban had produced a popular science series since 1903. The Unseen World\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n9\n\n‘The Belles of Black Diamond Field’ in A Day in the Life of a Coalminer (Kineto, 1910)\n\nused microscopic photography (previously employed in lantern slides) and time-lapse filming, in the manner of BBC TV’s equally celebrated 1995 The Life of Plants. Frederick Talbot, in 1912, refers to films of microbes, flowers, insects and polyps. The exhibition of X-rays (Röntgen rays) had proved a brief but popular success in 1896, commented upon by Warwick Trading Company’s 1897 The X-Ray Fiend, in which A pair of lovers on a seat are approached by a professor with X-Ray apparatus. He reveals their bones, and, having satisfied his scientific curiosity, retreats as quietly as he came, leaving the lovers to continue their spooning quite unconscious of the grotesque figures they have cut.30\n\nFascination with new-fangled science is also treated as a humorous subject in Clarendon Film Company’s A Lesson in Electricity (1909) in which naughty boys (ubiquitous comic protagonists in the tens and teens) watch the demonstration of the hatching of an egg and the peeling of an orange; they then decide that it would be a jolly good jape to seize the apparatus and perform their own ‘experiment’, electrifying a pavement and causing the pedestrians to jump about disconcertingly. Finally, the students receive their comeuppance (as in Vice Versa [1910]): the elec-\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n10\n\ntric current is passed through them, causing them to grimace most horribly. Gaumont’s 1907 The Magnetic Man (‘much applauded at London’s Hippodrome’) shows a coat of mail charged with electricity by mischievous workmen, ‘everything metal which he approaches flies to him including a breakfast tray’. Hepworth provided a variant on the theme of That Fatal Sneeze (1907) with The Professor’s Anti-Gravitation Fluid (1908), where the scientist himself, rather than the boys who have misappropriated his invention, is victimised by an angry mob. Both Cecil Hepworth (in Algiers) and Nevil Maskelyne (in North Carolina) had filmed the solar eclipse of 1900, the latter film screened at the Egyptian Halls in Piccadilly; previous eclipses had been photographed. Sir George Newnes’ 1898 Antarctic Expedition was also equipped with a Kinematograph camera. Some educational subjects were designed to exploit the capacity of the new medium to record time and motion, while in others film replaced still photography. Some films commented on new technology as a source of narrative amusement.\n\nEntertaining: Trick Flicks, Cops and Robbers; Poachers and Gamekeepers; Estranged Lovers and Dead Babies Generally, informative and educational films were interspersed in programmes constructed to make the audience ‘laugh, cry and lean forward with excitement’. Films (shown at fairgrounds and elsewhere) employed camera tricks and devices similar to those applied by Urban to scientific subjects. Smith and Hepworth both made reversal films. Hepworth’s 1900 single frame Bathers (apparently in imitation of a Georges Méliès precedent) shows men stripping down poolside, diving into water and then emerging from the water, feet first, ascending in a graceful arc back to the shore: ‘their clothes are seen to be flying up into their hands, one by one, producing an effect which is weird and extremely comic’. Smith’s The House that Jack Built (1900) shows a young girl building a house from toy bricks which is then demolished by her spiteful brother. A caption (possibly the first in British cinema) is interjected to announce the film’s reversal, showing the blocks re-assembling themselves. In Vice Versa (directed by Dave Aylott for Cricks and Martin) a conjuror entertains a house party, a naughty boy in an Eton collar then stealing his wand and effecting a number of performed reversals (achieved by stop-motion): a shoe-shine boy swaps with a businessman; a policeman and a ruffian change places in a chase; a ‘masher’ and a maid scrubbing a doorstep exchange roles and passing suffragettes are obliged to do the work of men, digging a hole in the ground. In Paul’s The Human Flies (1903) the frame itself is reversed, the ‘trick’ again prompted by a conjuror, tossing his hat then himself into the air; people, recorded in slow motion, appear to float with parasols, somersault and leap from the ‘ceiling’, with the backing flat of the drawing room re-set upside-down. James Williamson’s famous 1901 The Big Swallow uses a tripartite structure, in which the camera itself is cast in the action: a man approaches and opens his mouth until it fills the frame; a camera and its operator are submerged in darkness; the man retreats from the camera, walking backwards, chewing and swallowing. Williamson’s Grandma’s Reading Glass and As Seen Through the Telescope (both 1900) used comic-strip close-ups (cued by a magnifying glass and a telescope and vignetted accordingly) as cut-ins between wider shots, to indicate the object of interest to a\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n11\n\ncharacter in the film. Actual exterior footage of trains (as in the travelogue films) was sometimes cut either side of interior ‘made-up’ scenes (framing an action performed in a single shot with a ‘before’ and an ‘after’), separated by black leader to intimate to the viewer the train passing into a tunnel: numerous versions of The Kiss in the Tunnel scenario were produced in this manner (for instance, by Smith and by Bamforth in 1899).31 Mary Jane’s Mishap (G. A. Smith, 1902/3), with Mrs Smith as the importunate maid, uses a vertical wipe between her ascent up the roof through the chimney and the scene of her final resting place: ‘Here lies Mary Jane who lighted the fire with paraffin – rest in pieces’, her ghost then rising from the grave and returning. Stop-motion photography was used to convey sudden, ‘miraculous’ costume changes and to allow the substitution of actors and/or dummies in motor car accidents (as detailed in Talbot’s Motion Pictures – see Chapter 2). Williamson’s 1905 An Interesting Story (providing an opportunity for much expressive face pulling) presents a man so engrossed in his reading that he falls over a woman scrubbing a step, gets caught in a skipping rope, bumps into a donkey cart and is then flattened by a steam roller: two cyclists re-inflate him with their bicycle pumps before he retreats into the distance, still thoroughly absorbed in his book. In Hepworth’s 1900 The Explosion of a Motor Car, an overloaded car self-combusts and blows its occupants into the sky; a passing policeman picks up the bodies, clothes and limbs which fall to the ground. In his 1902 How to Stop a Motor Car, the policeman himself (a novel twist) is dismembered, while in his How it Feels to be Run Over (1900) a car approaches and passes the camera, hotly pursued by another which runs over the camera: ‘Oh!! Mother will be pleased’ is flashed onto the screen word by word, to indicate the hapless victim of the assault ‘seeing stars’ and the heavens. The ‘?’ Motorist (directed by W. R. Booth for Paul, 1906) employs superimpositions, stop-motion and animation to convey the propulsion of a car (chased by policemen) to Saturn, via the Moon, and its mutation into a horse and trap, before coming to a halt; Paul repeats the gag in The Lady Luna(tics) Hat (1908). Intertitles can serve as an item of interest in their own right as well as contributing towards narrative exposition: Mitchell and Kenyon produced animated titles (for non-fiction films and for ‘made-up’ subjects, such as their 1903 Diving Lucy), the letters jumbled then sorted in the manner of Tit Bits anagrams and acrostic puzzles. Williamson (like Hepworth, an experienced lecturer and lanternist) applied a number of magic lantern techniques to film. Their derivation (and other precursors of cinema, such as shadow puppets, dioramas, silhouettes, thaumatropes and various optical ‘toys’) are amply and pertinently demonstrated in Comrades (1986 – see Chapter 11), directed by the pre-eminent pre-cinema enthusiast and collector, Bill Douglas; a lanternist (as in Warning Shadows – see Chapter 4) serves as narrator.32 Are You There? (Williamson, 1901) uses a curtain to split the screen between parallel action in two distinct places, a man on the left of frame speaking on the telephone to a woman on the right; the call is intercepted by an older man (perhaps the woman’s husband, perhaps her father) while the first (perhaps her lover) unwittingly continues his conversation with nonchalant ease – and is duly thrashed for his impertinence. Both Santa Claus (1898) and The Little Matchseller (1902 – from the Hans Christian Andersen original) employed superimpositions to\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n12\n\nconnotate dreams and visions. Hepworth’s Alice in Wonderland (directed by Percy Stow) introduces the Cheshire Cat as a superimposed image in a hedge and Alice is superimposed in miniature (as she drinks a magic potion); stop-motion allows a baby to turn, instantaneously, into a piglet. Clarendon used multiple exposure to effect a flashback to the wreck (with which the original play opens) in its 1908 abridged and episodic version of Shakespeare’s The Tempest (Stow again combining sets and location filming), with stop-motion employed to transform Ariel into a monkey (to confuse Caliban) and disappearing and reappearing (to confuse Ferdinand). This is a more imaginative and persuasive staging of the Bard than Mutoscope and Biograph’s static 1899 King John, featuring Herbert Beerbohm Tree (but then, as James Agate waspishly noted, ‘as a tragic actor Tree was a farce’): the film’s four scenes were intended to promote Tree’s concurrent stage production.33 In Rescued in Mid Air (1906) Stow, again for Clarendon, returns to the perennial theme of a roadway collision, with a Mary Poppins-style figure, blown skywards and supported by an umbrella, eventually retrieved from a lamppost by a scientist and his wonderful flying machine. However, in spite of cinema’s debt to the lantern, in its subjects and its techniques, Deac Rossell and Richard Crangle have wisely urged caution against histories that posit the lantern as merely a putative (and implicitly inferior) form of cinema, soon to be superseded by cinema proper: certainly, film and the lantern coexisted in exhibition in a number of settings and in the design of apparatus for some time to come.34 Frank Gray has commented on the recurrence of Fire Brigade rescue narratives in slide series and films: the 1890 series, Bob the Fireman, or, Life in the Brigade (consisting of twelve slides and a 1,600-word commentary), proved especially popular.35 For instance, in Williamson’s Fire! (1901), the action cuts briskly from a house with smoke billowing, to Hove Fire Station (with the engines and men rushing left to right), then continues with the horses galloping left to right across frame up the road, to a man in the burning building – where a fireman breaks through the window and hoses down the flames, to an exterior shot of the man being safely lifted out and carried down a ladder. Hepworth suggests that he produced numerous local permutations, ‘all smoke and sparks and perspiring horses’, to satisfy his clients and their audiences.36 But the chase (and the rescue or apprehension) was a theme which traversed non-fiction and fiction, enhancing the momentum of dramatic, comic and pathetic subjects. Here, again, film action finds its precedents in a range of sources. The Miller and the Sweep (Smith, 1898) combines a circus or pantomime slapstick gag (revisited by Will Hay in the 1930s – see Chapter 5) – an argument between the two results in the one getting floury and the other getting sooty – with a chase joyfully enacted by men, women and children pursuing the protagonists out of the frame. The scenario of Gaumont’s 1906 The Story of a Brown Hat or The Missing Legacy (directed by Alf Collins) is wittily elaborated in the 1930s, in The Lucky Number (Anthony Asquith, 1933) and The Twelve Chairs (see Chapter 5). It’s Not My Parcel (Gaumont, 1906) and Pimple and the Snake (1912 – see Chapter 2) indicate, by parody, that the particular object of the chase is immaterial to the interest of the film’s generic subject – in the latter a woman’s feather boa is mistakenly identified and is pursued by an accumulating group of people across successive shots. Policemen (and gamekeepers) chasing robbers (and poachers) and\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n13\n\nfeather boas are as often represented as the butt of humour as the upholders of decent law and order. In That Fatal Sneeze, directed by Lewis Fitzhamon, a boy prankster sprinkles powder on a man’s bed. The man gets up, sneezing, causing pictures and shelves to fall from the walls and furniture to overturn. He leaves the house, followed by the boy, past a hardware store (where baskets are dislodged from their moorings), past Hepworth’s ‘Hepwix’ shop front (incidental branding and advertisement!), the man’s sneezes bringing down a lamppost. A sailor, the hardware merchant and a policeman join the chase, then a woman whose hat and wig are blown off (most unseemly). The man escapes his pursuers up a ladder (and out of frame) only to have it collapse beneath him. Such is the violence of his sneezing that the camera itself reels from side to side. There is a final convulsion and, in stop-motion, the man disappears in a puff of smoke. Jack Shepherd (the notorious criminal, eventually hanged at Tyburn, celebrated in the 1903 Tit Bits series ‘Romances of Newgate Prison’) was adopted as the popular hero for Paul’s 1900 film, The Hair-Breadth Escape of Jack Shepherd. Hepworth, followed in 1913 by British and Colonial, celebrated the career of Dick Turpin and his noble steed, Black Bess, with Samuelson creating a fictional highwayman for its Deadwood Dick series; a girl poses as a highwayman (see Chapter 7) in Hepworth’s 1910 period romance, In the Good Old Days, directed by Fitzhamon, while male convicts sometimes cross-dress as women, like Kenneth Grahame’s Mr Toad, to effect an escape (as in The Convict’s Escape [1903]). William Haggar’s 1905 Charles Peace (a subject also filmed by Frank Mottershaw for Sheffield Photo Company – ‘the Sensational Leap from the Train taken on the actual spot’) similarly returns to a historic figure (immortalised in wax at Madame Tussaud’s and visited by Lupin Pooter in the Grossmiths’ 1892 The Diary of a Nobody – see also Pimple in ‘The Whip’ [1917], Chapter 2), a professional criminal imprisoned in 1879.37 Haggar, a travelling showman in Wales, performed in and produced films with his family, for exhibition at fairs. Haggar stages Peace’s career in a series of tableaux, from his first burglary, to his murder of his lover’s husband, to a dramatic rooftop chase, to another burglary, to his disguise as a parson (foiling the police), to his eventual capture, trial, escape, recapture (following a struggle in a railway carriage), identification by a witness and execution: the fairground public’s continuing appetite for such ghoulish entertainment is witnessed in the fairground of Anthony Asquith’s The Lucky Number and by wide-eyed and open-mouthed children in Lindsay Anderson’s 1953 film of Margate Amusement Park, O Dreamland (see Chapter 8). Clarendon invokes literary precedent in The Downfall of the Burglar’s Trust, advertised in Kine Weekly in 1908 as ‘a hot chase ending in a cold plunge, concluding with the capture of Bill Sikes . . . a lively policeman finds the gem in Sike’s coat pocket’.38 Mottershaw’s vigorous A Daring Daylight Burglary (1903) follows thieves and the police in pursuit, aided and abetted by an alert boy and police reinforcements, continuing the chase from the house, to rooftops, over land and water to a moving train. Haggar’s A Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) augments gamekeepers (shot) with police and substitutes burglars for poachers, but similarly proceeds via rough and tumble and fisticuffs across land (closely passing the camera) and through water before the culprits are apprehended. Mottershaw’s Mixed Babies (1905) – its slapstick comedy enhanced by its implicit pathetic possibilities – opens with a newspaper boy outside a\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n14\n\nshop, with customers leaving prams outside as they enter to make purchases. The boy prankster laughs as he swaps the babies. Realising the mistake, a male customer is chased by a woman, then pursued by a policeman and another boy, on a bicycle; the woman wallops the man (with his baby) then gives it to the policeman (who falls and rolls over onto it) before throwing it over a garden wall (only to have it promptly thrown back at him). Hepworth’s 1905 Rescued by Rover (directed by Lewin Fitzhamon) proved so successful with audiences that he wore out the negative making prints and re-made the subject three times over: it is remarkable for its sustained pace, its construction (parallel and continuity editing) and its unusual length (seven minutes – although Hepworth’s drama, Falsely Accused, also produced in 1905, ran to fourteen minutes).39 His wife wrote the story and appeared as the bereaved mother, with Hepworth himself as the father and the family dog (Blair) as the hero, here and in its sequels (Rover Drives a Motor [1908 – ‘a perfect gem’, exudes Kine Weekly, ‘combining as it does a clever conception and a rare example of animal sagacity’], A Plucky Little Girl [1909] and The Dog Came Back [1909]). For the first time, he cast professional actors, Mr and Mrs Smith assuming the roles of flirtatious soldier and wicked child thief. The film is constructed as an exemplary chase narrative, but equally can be aligned alongside stories featuring intrepid pets (including horses and elephants – praised, in the manner of Landseer paintings and popular prints, as ‘Dumb Sagacity’) and pathetic and moral tales of misplaced babies. As in Hepworth’s 1914 The Lure of London (see Chapter 2) and The Portrait (1911) – in which children are restored to their rightful guardians only years later – tippling, fecklessness and vagrancy are rendered disapprovingly, while in Warwick Trading Company’s The Page Boy and the Baby (1907) a gypsy is found innocent of the theft of a baby hidden in a roll-top desk by (yet another) mischievous boy and in The Miser’s Lesson (1910), directed by Bert Haldane for Hepworth, a gypsy child reforms a miser. Urban revisited the subject in 1908 with Kidnapped by Gypsies, setting the action in ‘delightful scenery of woodland, sea and shore’, to add to the narrative interest. As in Grahame’s 1908 novel, The Wind in the Willows, the middle-class propriety of Badger (as opposed to the ‘not nice’ habits of the weasels, stoats and foxes which encroach upon him in the Wild Wood) is upheld by Rescued by Rover as a virtue. A begging gypsy woman is turned away by a woman with a baby in a carriage, outside a wellappointed suburban house. As the baby’s nanny (Mabel Clark) flirts with a soldier (a theme revisited by Graphic’s 1907 The Tricky Twins – where a policeman saves the baby), the gypsy seizes the child and takes it to her garret. The distraught nanny informs her mistress of the theft and the family dog is despatched to discover the child’s whereabouts. Rover enthusiastically runs out (in one shot), down the road, towards the camera (in another shot), paddles across a river and shakes before resuming his search on the other side. Locating the hideaway by scent, Rover returns (leaping through the window) to fetch the father and the family is duly reunited. Hepworth finds a happy ending for a similar sorry story in his 1907 The Man Who Could Not Commit Suicide: a young man is desperately in love with a pretty girl and declares his passion but is rejected and, becoming despondent, resolves to put an end to his life. His first attempt (attaching a tube to a gas bracket) is foiled by a dog, but, taking this as an omen, he again approaches\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n15\n\nthe girl and is refused. He tries hanging (but the rope breaks) and is again refused. Finally, he climbs into a barrel, intent upon drowning, whereupon the lady relents and carries him off in her arms. Many tales did not end so fortuitously for their protagonists, provoking tears from their audience rather than smiles. Pathos films often drew upon familiar sources, for instance, R. W. Paul’s scenic portrayal of The Poor Orphan’s Last Prayer (1902) and Harrison’s 1902 Little Jim both illustrated well-known songs, while Walturdaw’s Jessica’s First Prayer referred to Hesba Stretton’s bestseller, published by the Religious Tract Society in 1882.40 Warwick Trading Company’s 1900 The Death of Poor Joe (depicting the death of a child crossing-sweeper in the snow) referred to a famously contrived photograph by Oscar Rejlander, staging an incident in Charles Dickens’ 1852–3 series Bleak House, while Clarendon’s 1909 Hard Times invoked the Dickens novel of 1854; Little Nell and Burglar Bill (1903) and Clarendon’s Nancy, or the Burglar’s Daughter (1908) recall characters in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) and Oliver Twist (1837–9). R. W. Paul’s Buy Your Own Cherries (1904) retains the episodic structure and painterly style of the famous lantern slide sequence on which it was based: a workman spends the household income on drink and his children cower in fear of him; a clergyman persuades him to take the pledge (which he honours by by-passing a pub); in due course the children become happier and better dressed (he now brings them presents) and the house better kept and appointed. Many of these pathetic narratives were timely releases prompting charity in the Christian season of goodwill, or served as a didactive inducement to temperance as much as entertainment – for instance, the Sheffield Photographic Company’s 1906 Lost in the Snow. A Grandchild’s Devotion, A Child’s Prayer (in which a poor child’s letter to Santa is blown up the chimney and down into the rich house next door) and Hepworth’s Little Meg and the Wonderful Lamp (in which a rich couple save an orphan who has stolen a pantomime lantern) were released in December 1906; Hepworth’s Poverty and Compassion (depicting a family in a garret) appeared in December 1908 and Tempered with Mercy, featuring a policeman who urges sympathy on a hard-hearted baker who seeks to prosecute a thieving child, was a Christmas release in 1909, along with Cricks and Martin’s The Motherless Waif, featuring a drunkard father and another kindly policeman. In The Little Matchseller, a little girl scampers in the snow trying to sell her wares. She is ignored by a man in a top hat. A boy enters the frame, throwing snowballs at her then stealing her only shoe. The lamplighter ignores her – she huddles to the wall and cries. Lighting a match, she summons a vision of a fireplace (at which she attempts to warm her hands), then a table, heavily laden with annual fare, which disappears as she approaches; then a Christmas tree appears, richly decorated. An angel descends and the girl collapses before being carried upwards as a spirit (an image repeated in The Poor Orphan’s Last Prayer). When a policeman arrives and shines his torch into the corner, he finds her body slumped on the ground. Other unfortunate children serve to reunite estranged lovers or to confirm sibling loyalty. In the 1910 British and Colonial film Two Little Shoes, a man is driven to crime to provide food for his wife and child, but the infant nevertheless dies and the father is sent to prison with only a shoe by which to remember her. On release, he breaks into a house and finds the pair to the shoe and is\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n16\n\nthus reunited with his wife. Williamson’s Orphans (advertised at Christmas 1907 as ‘a story with a moral on the lines of our well-known Stowaway film’) has the brother led astray by bad company while the sister is adopted by a lady of means; fifteen years later the boy breaks into the house of the girl’s benefactor, recognises their mother’s locket and determines to reform, ‘With God’s help and your good example’. A comparable moral (‘it’s never too late to mend’) is served by Nancy, or the Burglar’s Daughter. Cricks and Sharp’s A Woman’s Sacrifice (1906) affords a reconciliation of a father and mother over ‘the little peacemaker’s’ sick-bed, whereas in Hepworth’s 1907 A Lovers’ Quarrel, a boy is despatched to return a lady’s engagement ring to her fiancé, is run over by a motor car but reunites the couple in hospital before dying. For Baby’s Sake (1908), directed by A. E. Coleby for Cricks and Martin, described as ‘a pathetic picture in six scenes’, is given the following entry in the catalogue: A lady and gentleman are talking in a drawing room, their child playing with her doll, when a friend of her husband’s is announced and duly introduced to the wife and child. A telegram arrives making it necessary for the husband to go out . . . so, telling the friend he will not be long away he hurries off. The nurse in the meantime has taken the child and returns for her to say goodnight before going to bed. As soon as the nurse has departed, the gentleman, being in an amorous mood, attempts to kiss his friend’s wife but she indignantly repels him and as she is struggling with him the husband returns and strikes his false friend to the floor. The husband is indignant with the friend and wife and leaves the house. Next we see the mother and child at home, the mother very sad. The child suggests writing to her ‘dear daddy’ and the mother humours her, hoping it will bring him back. The letter is written (copy shown) by the child, addressed and they go together to post it. The gentleman sadly looks at his wife’s portrait. A footman brings the letter from the child. He cannot resist the appeal and returns hastily. A happy reconciliation takes place all due to the little peacemaker.\n\nIn The Motherless Waif the death of the little match-girl brings about the drunkard’s reform: ‘in deep remorse, the father, with hands raised to Heaven, swears never again to touch the cursed bottle and . . . dreams that his beloved wife comes and takes the child with outstretched wings up into the starry firmament’. In Tempered with Mercy, one sister works as a flower-girl to support the other. Two Little Waifs (Williamson, 1905) has a boy in a sailor suit stolen by gypsies and taken to a gypsy caravan; he befriends a little girl at the camp and they escape to his home where the father embraces the boy but rejects the girl, who is then, again, kidnapped. The father and the boy search for the girl, the father eventually saving the girl from a burning building and welcoming her into his own nice family. Films presented as entertainment often drew their material from older narrative and pictorial subjects which audiences could readily recognise. Cinematic devices were used to invest this inherited content with new interest and to advertise cinema itself. Early film-makers frequently took to imitating one another, establishing and reinforcing generic distinctions identified by audiences and exhibitors. Different themes appear intended to appeal to different audiences.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n17\n\nThe Catalogue; the Programme; the Playbill; the Press Kine Weekly, the trade journal founded in 1907, reported the Mammoth Fun City at Olympia, an exhibition which brought the fun of the fairground to the centre of London. Mrs F. Collins’ Kinematograph show is celebrated as ‘the finest in England’, elaborately ornamented and decorated with lamps to attract the punter, with a powerful organ to accompany the entertainment.41 Other seasonal fairs (such as Nottingham’s autumn Goose Fair, recorded by Mitchell and Kenyon) appeared as the subject of films, showing the attractions with which the early cinema (enticingly named ‘Electric Palace’, ‘Wonderland’ or ‘Theatre of Delights’) competed for the punters’ trade and the size of its potential audience, including boxing booths (as seen in Hitchcock’s The Ring [1927] – see Chapter 4) and switchback rides (at Blackpool). Other films, in a variant of the train phantom ride, conveyed the experience of being in a switchback carriage. The supreme showman, ‘Edison’ Thomas, promoted himself and the films he showed by exploiting a confusion of his name with that of the American inventor, Thomas Edison. Hepworth recalls: He plastered the whole town wherever he went (and went nearly everywhere) with tremendous posters in brilliant colours describing his wonderful shows and still more wonderful self . . . He would parade the town in person, mounted high on an open lorry, actively turning his camera on every little knot of people he passed . . . Unfortunately for their hopes the camera had no film in it . . . and if they failed to see themselves on the screen, it was just too bad. The hall was filled and they had a good show for their money, so what’s the odds?42\n\nGeorge Pearson, a schoolteacher who directed his first films in the teens (see Chapters 2 and 5) recalls the boyhood experience which initiated his interest in the new medium: With sixpence to spend I had gone to a funny little shop in the Lambeth Walk where Pollock’s gory melodramas for his Toy Theatres were sold, sheets of characters for a penny plain, twopence coloured. Fourpence went rapturously on Alone in the Pirates’ Lair. With twopence jingling a farewell in my pocket, since the toffee-shop was near, I zig-zagged through the hurly-burly of the busy street, when presto! . . . the great adventure began. It was outside a derelict greengrocer’s shop. The hawk-eyed gentleman on a fruit-crate was bewildering a sceptical crowd. In that shuttered shop there was a miracle to be seen for a penny, but only twenty-four could enter at a time, there wasn’t room for more. His peroration was magnificent . . . ‘You’ve seen pictures with people in books, all frozen stiff . . . you’ve never seen pictures with people coming alive, moving about like you and me. Well, go inside and see for yourself, living pictures for a penny, and then tell me I’m a liar!’ One of my pennies went suddenly; I joined twenty-three other sceptics inside. Stale cabbage leaves and a smell of dry mud gave atmosphere to a scene from Hogarth. A furtive youth did things to a tin oven on iron legs, and a white sheet swung from the ceiling. We grouped round that oven and wondered. Suddenly things happened, someone turned down a gas-jet, the tin apparatus burst into a fearful clatter, and an oblong picture slapped on to the sheet and began a violent dance. After a while I discerned it was a picture of a house,\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n18\n\nbut a house on fire. Flames and smoke belched from the windows, and miracle of miracles, a fireengine dashed in, someone mounted a fire-escape, little human figures darted about below, and then . . . Bang! . . . the show was over. Exactly one minute . . . I had been to the Cinema!43\n\nHowever, such ‘gaffs’ were the cause of much concern to local authorities, and under the guise of protecting the audience (and especially children) against the physical danger of fire (resulting from highly combustible film stock), crushing in inadequate escape exits and the supposed moral danger of some of the material shown (with children truanting from school to attend during the day), legislation was introduced in 1909 to regulate exhibition. Contributors to the parliamentary discussion and the trade press urged that reports of fires (in Britain and elsewhere) were much exaggerated and that the Bill proposed ‘grandmotherly, and in many cases, entirely unnnecessary precautions’.44 They also cited the equivalent potential of cinema to provide ‘moral improvement’ through the types of religious and temperance themes shown in church halls, Salvation Army citadels and schools (to be restricted, by the Bill, to two days per year); others questioned the advisability of county councils holding power over licences and whether films should be singled out for particular discrimination (a debate which continues). Jon Burrows suggests that the 1909 Act was partly the product of ulterior political motives (regulating gatherings of immigrant communities in the East End of London – demonised in Hepworth’s 1905 The Aliens’ Invasion and documented in Gaumont’s 1911 film of the notorious Great East End Anarchist Battle)45 while, on the other hand, the discretion accorded to the London County Council allowed ‘subversive’ imported films (notably from Soviet Russia) to be given limited screenings in the 1920s, even while they failed to secure general commercial distribution (see Chapter 4). The trade press, not surprisingly, suggested that investment in films and in the construction (or adaptation) of premises to designated use was a sound move and broadly welcomed the stamp of respectability which government intervention bestowed. ‘Let us put ourselves on record once and for all’, says The Bioscope in 1908 (not for the first nor last time), that the motion picture furore is not a ‘fad’ and will never meet the fate of business bubbles that have burst as rapidly as they have risen . . . It began with experiment, was tried out as an experiment, slowly grew like an oak, deeply rooted in the affections of the people, reaching upwards to higher levels and branching out into varied fields of interest.46\n\nHowever, Nicholas Hiley has ably demonstrated that caution was well justified in the light of previous forms of entertainment which had promised great returns but which had proved no more than a passing novelty (he draws a specific comparison with the recent skating boom):47 local gazettes, such as The Manchester Programme, convey a sense of the competition, varying from summer to winter. The shift at the end of the 1900s towards the production of longer films and self-standing programmes (dispensing with elephants and variety turns) he therefore aligns with the demands of exhibitors and distributors (now hiring rather than selling – the rate dependent on\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n19\n\nthe age of the film) intent upon attracting patrons prepared to pay for novelty, comfort and for content directed, perhaps, at more elevated tastes. ‘The craving on the part of exhibitors for new subjects rather than good’, continues The Bioscope, is to be deplored; ‘the efforts of manufacturers to uplift the quality of their productions will meet with the warm support of the public’.48 In practice, it seems, producers continued to provide novelty (if only in the form of a variation or adaptation of a familiar theme) alongside quality. Clarendon’s The Tempest, Williamson’s Hamlet, Gaumont’s Romeo and Juliet (‘A Magnificent Gorgeous Cinematic Representation’ claiming to include more than forty London artistes in its cast), Anthony and Cleopatra (proclaiming its presentation ‘by properly qualified actors and actresses’) and Richard III may be indicative of a cultural shift, while also trading on a longstanding popular appetite for the pictorial depiction of Shakespeare. More opportunistically, they contributed towards and profited from a more widespread American and European Shakespeare ‘boom’ in 1908.49 A similar timely release was Hepworth’s The Death of Nelson (shown to the accompaniment of a popular song), produced for the centenary of Trafalgar. Williamson produced a Cromwellian drama, Just in Time, in 1907, proceeded by Clarendon’s pairing of The Cavalier’s Wife and The Puritan Maid and the Royalist Refugee in 1908. For Christmas 1907 Clarendon released The Water Babies, or the Little Chimney Sweep (from Charles Kingsley’s 1863 novel) and The Pied Piper of Hamlin – featuring ‘period costumes and real rats’. Gaumont (the French-based company) advertised a Grand Pantomime (in two versions – as with toy theatres, ‘tuppence coloured, penny plain’) and, for Easter 1908, produced Salome, Nazareth and The Life of Christ. Films which drew upon pre-cinematic precedents, in theme, characters or performances, would seem to require little introduction or explanation to their audiences. The adventures of the cartoon cockney figure, Ally Sloper (a favourite of Bert Smallways in H. G. Wells’ 1908 The War in the Air) was transposed to a series of three films by Williamson, the success of the original prompting Ally Sloper’s Visit to Brighton (1898) and Ally Sloper Batting (1898).50 Dickens proved a perennial favourite, both directly from the novels (themselves originally serialised) and from lantern slide series (such as the pathetic tale of Paul Dombey in his 1848 Dombey and Son). Smith’s 1898 The Corsican Brothers employed double exposure to render the vision of a ghost in Dion Boucicault’s sensational 1852 play, then proving a popular success on stage at the Lyceum. Other films directly recorded stage performances (such as the famous pantomime dame, Dan Leno, the music hall stars Florrie Forde, Vesta Tilley, Harry Lauder and Will Evans, and the D’Oyly Carte production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Mikado, filmed in 1907 by Walturdaw and supplied with gramophone recordings) or documented music hall performers and actors as celebrities (as in Miss Marie Lloyd [Warwick Trading Company, 1898] and Ellen Terry at Home [Warwick Trading Company, 1900]). Many films employ familiar, stock figures as the perpetrators of jokes or as the butt of humour (the largest category of fiction film production). In Gaumont’s 1909 How Percy Won the Beauty Competition, the camera pans across the line of smiling belles; one flirts outrageously and takes a tipple from a flask; the ‘ruse’ is not noticed until the prize is awarded and Percy’s sidekicks reveal the disguise. Women’s dress and vanity are similarly aped (literally) and ridiculed in Cricks and\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n20\n\nMartin’s 1908 Lord Algy’s Beauty Show, The Bioscope commentary advising us that the ‘First Prize is a husband; the Second, a bull pup; the Third, a silk dress with consolation prizes of powder puffs’. The trade press was adamant that good verbal exposition, preferably written by the lecturer himself, could but enhance the experience of a film for an audience, even when it included titles. ‘One of the most urgent requirements to-day is that every picture shall be introduced to the audience in a manner that will ensure the good points of a film being intelligently appreciated’, urges The Bioscope in 1908, ‘the lay mind . . . is quite incapable of seeing and comprehending the inner nature and underlying humanity which are the life and soul of to-day’s greatest creations’: The lecturer should know the picture well before he attempts to explain it to others; he should keep perfect pace with the projection machine, should quietly indicate the inner causes when the outer result is taking place; he should indulge in no stock phrases, no personal reminiscences which the picture may recall, no opaque phrases, no drawn-out windy sentences . . . Above all else, make the story bright and the explanation worthy of a beautiful picture.\n\nWhere appropriate, the lecturer’s exposition could be accompanied by sound effects.51 Elsewhere, there was discussion of accompanying music cueing an appropriate response. Concerning ‘Wordless Pictorial Songs’ (such as sentimental, patriotic and imperial themes) The Bioscope maintained that ‘even the poorest hall affords a pianist who can play popular songs and his modest talents with a few song films or a number of more humble song slides are all that are required’, indicating an amount of audience participation.52 The Bioscope suggested that, where a two-hour programme of films proved wearying for an audience, there was something wrong with the programming ‘rather than with film as such’, again resisting its augmentation by elephants and variety turns.53 French films frequently featured alongside the home-grown product. There was much insistence upon the technical stipulation of clear photography (on the part of producers) and flickerless projection (on the part of exhibitors). It published and commented upon samples of programmes witnessed by correspondents across the country and indicated the balance of actuality, topicality, comedy, drama and pathos which might expected to be well received. The following example is given by Kine Weekly in 1907: A Great Temptation Railway Ride His First Camera A Grandchild’s Devotion Balloon Races at Ranelagh How Jones Saw the Derby Two Little Scamps The Alhambra Serenade\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:02 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n21\n\nThe Negro’s Revenge Clarnico Fire Brigade The Good-Hearted Judge The Launch of a Japanese Battleship Ascending Mount Snowdon Our Ice Supply False Coiners A Visit to Sunlight Soap Works The Villain still Pursued Her54\n\nPathos tends to appear towards the top or bottom of the billing but never opens or closes the show, this reserved for more rousing subjects (thrilling chases, patriotic or sports fixtures). Meanwhile, audience members could drift in and out at any stage or see the programme right through from any point. Hepworth (again, in imitation of lantern slide and stage precedent) produced ‘curtain’ films in 1900 intended to open and close programmes of naval films, showing the furling and unfurling by bluejackets of a ship’s sail from a halyard, a most excellent device ‘for any series descriptive of England’s might, or the lives of her Naval Heroes’. The lecturer’s description of the scenes was often supplemented by a printed programme. For instance, the Biograph’s third anniversary at the Palace Theatre, Cambridge Circus, was marked with a souvenir booklet illustrated with photographs and stills from its Boer War films made by W. K.-L. Dickson, accompanied by extracts from his war diary. The Bioscope suggested souvenir nights and gifts of golliwogs at children’s matinées to encourage trade. Filoscope flick-books (produced from a series of stills from films) were a form of early spin-off, while Nestlé and Lever Brothers subsidised reduced seat prices for filmgoers producing appropriate chocolate and soap wrappers. The programme (and the producer’s catalogue) might provide a lecturer with information which was not apparent in the film itself – the content of a telegram (as in For Baby’s Sake) or (as in A Daring Daylight Burglary) the fact that a telegraph has been sent ahead to inform the police that the thieves have fled by train. Producers’ catalogues and trade journals categorised films and gave synopses to enable exhibitors to order and advertise films to best effect. The longer films produced towards the end of the decade incorporated and combined themes from the earlier simpler scenarios. A successful plot, advises Kine Weekly, ‘must arrest and sustain the audience from first to last’. Urban’s 1907 A Waif of the Sea is advertised as a ‘Pathetic Picture Story of Rescue, Unrequited Love and Magnanimous Renunciation’ (with Normandy coastal scenery as an extra attraction). Clarendon’s 1907 The Soldier’s Wedding (trading on its previous success, The Sailor’s Wedding) is advertised as ‘Romantic, Exciting, Pathetic and Humorous’; The Missionary’s Daughter as ‘Thrilling, Pathetic and Romantic’: the girl is seized by slavers and ‘rescued from an awful death’ by British Tars. Walturdaw’s The Story of a Locket involves a ‘struggle that will grip your audience’ between a son who has done well in the world and the father who fell prey to drink and deserted him years previously.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:03 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n22\n\nIn order to ‘Rope them In’, The Bioscope advocated that posters should be placed all over the town telling ‘briefly and in bold type the kind of story that the film illustrates: e.g. The Auto Heroine – “a thrilling drama of a Motor Race”; Lockjaw – “a rattling good side splitter”’: Bill matter is by far the most important item in a provincial manager’s business. The majority of showmen have pictures chosen for them by a hiring house in London, but it is his own business to see that the greatest possible importance is attached to each picture in the programme . . . keep your bill matter smart.55\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of the films produced in Britain in cinema’s first decade have not survived and publicity material in posters, catalogues and journals are their only record. The evidence suggests that early British film-making was marked by variety and ingenuity. However, these sources are also valuable for the information conveyed about cinema as an industry and a social institution in its early years and the extent to which, from the outset, American and European films and film-making have constituted a large part of the British filmgoing experience.\n\nFacials Often early British producers include primitive ‘facials’ in their lists of films for sale and, subsequently, for hire through distributors; these, it is frequently claimed, require little explanation to the audience, the performers’ contortions providing the primary and sufficient object of interest. But the urge to record fleeting shifts in expression crosses comedy, drama and ‘facials’ proper. Many longer films of the later tens and teens (see Chapter 2) still feature facial expression as an attraction, prompted by a narrative which calls for transitions in a single frame or cumulative changes in a sequence of intercut scenes (Florence Turner’s 1914 Daisy Doodad’s Dial is an excellent example of its use in comedy; Lady Audley’s Secret employs the reading of letters as a ‘setpiece’ thespian exercise). While generally promoted as entertainment, these films also refer to a scientific interest in human and animal physiognomy (see, for instance, Graphic’s 1906 Some of Our Relations), gesture and expression; while apparently essentially visual, these films draw upon the fascination of contemporary popular novelists (such as Marie Corelli and Arthur Conan Doyle) with traits characteristic to nationality and temperament; while recorded in movement (as in theatrical representation) they also recall the concerns of the pictorial and plastic arts (from academy paintings to much-published caricatures) over several centuries.56 Pulling faces for the camera was one of the earliest and most popular forms of film entertainment, with precedent in lantern slide series such as a Fry’s Chocolate advertisement: a small boy ‘expresses’ desperation; pacification; expectation; acclamation; (then, finally, smiling broadly) realisation ‘It’s Fry’s’. R. W. Paul produced The Troublesome Collar (1902), Funny Faces (1904), Spooning (1906) (showing a couple’s expressions as they kiss) and The Fidgety Fly (1907); Smith produced Comic Faces in 1898 (showing an old man drinking a glass of beer and an old woman taking snuff); Goodwin Norton, Expressions in 1899 and Hepworth, Comic Grimaces (1901–2). A Day in\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:03 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nTURN OF THE CENTURY AND TENS\n\n23\n\nthe Life of the Bishop of St Swithin’s (1907) includes ‘a delightfully amusing study of expression’ in close-up, with the Bishop encountering a cartoon of himself in The Westminster Gazette. Meanwhile, a contributor to Kine Weekly in 1907 suggested that animated political cartoons be produced to match those of Punch and The Westminster Gazette, proposing Mr Balfour, Mr Lyttleton and Lord Roberts (a much filmed and photographed Commander-in-Chief in the South African campaign) as subjects and in Smith’s 1901 The Monocle a man attempts to imitate a cartoon of Joseph Chamberlain. Sometimes, a character is shown alone, the audience privy to their undisguised, spontaneous expression of emotion, frequently occasioned by receipt of a missive or the self-absorbed reading of a news item. In Smith’s 1902 Pa’s Comments on the Morning News, father describes in gestures the stories as he encounters them: first, he shows a long, drawn face, thumps the table, mimes a noose around his own neck, twisted around and then tugged until his mouth drops open and his tongue falls forward; he touches his tongue and points to his boiled egg to indicate ‘the taste of death’ in his own mouth. Looking at the next story, he shadow-boxes, indicates a black eye and a broken nose, then claps and thumps the table laughing; such is Pa’s distraction that he puts his hand in his own breakfast. Mutoscope and Biograph’s 1898 The Fatal Letter (produced by the British subsidiary of an American company) shows a single-frame close-up of a man’s face as he reads of his aunt’s death. Ben Nathan plays the nephew, at first respectfully flicking out his cigarette and removing his hat, then opening the letter, drawing away from it as if rejecting its contents, then crying; but he reads on . . . He then folds the letter, smiles, snaps his fingers, sings to himself and kisses the letter. Smith’s 1899 The Legacy similarly shows a beneficiary’s expressions as he reads of a death and his consequent inheritance. The catalogue describes the performance: Another film in which facial expression is vividly depicted. The subject of the picture is going through his correspondence when he comes to a black-edged envelope. He reads with deep concern of the death of a favourite aunt, but when turning overleaf discovers that he is the recipient of a legacy. The change from gravity to extreme joy is most amusing, the delight of the reader being quite contagious. A well-known actor was the subject for this picture.\n\nR. W. Paul’s 1902 Facial Expressions, again providing a minimal narrative pretext for its action, presents: An actor with wigs and face paint making it understood by dumb show that he is impersonating various people, imitates a sanctimonious old man reading then an old woman with wigs and a shawl. The facial expressions are exceedingly funny.\n\nThese single-frame, miniature scenarios require the performer to produce one facial contortion then another in quick succession, not only to display an expression significant of a particular emotion but also then to transform the expression as the reading or action proceeds.\n\nBritishCinemaPages.qxd\n\n10/6/05\n\n3:03 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nBRITISH CINEMA\n\n24\n\nOther films use more than one protagonist, reacting to one another. In R. W. Paul’s Tea: The Twins’ Tea Party (1896) (‘an improved edition of the favourite Twins’ Tea Party’) two children are seen taking tea at table when a quarrel occurs over the cake. ‘One of them gets smacked by the other, causing her to cry vigorously, the expression being very funny.’ Smith’s 1899–1900 ‘Two Old Sports’ (played by the prominent comedians Hunter and Green) perform to each other on several occasions (requiring, notes the catalogue, no description of the action, ‘the expressions of the faces telling the tale’), as do the men in A Good Joke (1899), in Paul’s A Naughty Story, showing characters reacting to and sharing an item in a newspaper or magazine, and Smith’s 1900 Where Did You Get It? (four men passing around a naughty photograph). The Quarrelsome Couple (1902) concerns an argument over a newspaper story. In Smith’s 1900 Scandal over the Teacups, two spinsters gossip while drinking tea, while in The Old Maid’s Valentine (also 1900) a spinster (Eva Bailey) performs to her feline familiar. It tells a tale of hopes raised, then dashed, then of dignity affronted. A woman of a certain age sits sewing, poker-faced, eyes downcast, her mouth tautly drawn and her chin pulled in. She turns and notices the date and sighs. A large envelope is delivered, which she receives with some surprise. She wags an index finger at the cat and taps her nose conspiratorially, smiles then excitedly clenches a little fist to her bosom and fans herself. She laughs flirtatiously as she opens the envelope but her expression turns to horror as she realises the prank. The words ‘JUST LIKE YOU MAMA’ frame a clownish figure of a baby. Putting her hand to her forehead, she drops the letter, shakes her head tut-tuttingly, clasps her hands primly and resumes the original expression. Hepworth’s 1905–6 What the Curate Really Did employs contrasting acting styles to comic effect and, as in The Tell-Tale Telephone (Cricks and Sharp,1906), uses overlays to convey dual meaning. The original event (a young curate giving a little girl a ha’penny in exchange for a bunch of flowers) is performed naturalistically, whereas the proceedings successively elaborated (by Mrs Jones to Mrs Brown, by Mrs Brown to Mrs Robinson, and by Mrs Robinson to the Bishop) are enthusiastically portrayed and narrated in an increasingly histrionic manner, entailing much pulling of shocked faces and matronly flourishing of fans: an overlaid image shows the ‘little girl’ of the original story represented by the gossips as a young woman and the ‘ha’penny’ as a kiss. All is forgiven and peace restored when the little girl is introduced to the Bishop.\n\nNotes 1. Michael Korda, Charmed Lives: A Family Romance (London: Allen Lane, 1980), p. 434. 2.
