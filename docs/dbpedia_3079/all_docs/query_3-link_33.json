If the words that you are including in your research belong to someone else, give credit.\n\nHere is a brief list of what needs to be credited or documented:\n\nWords or ideas presented in a magazine, book, newspaper, song, TV program, movie, website, computer program, letter, advertisement, or any other medium\n\nInformation you gain through interviewing or conversing with another person, face to face, over the phone, or in writing\n\nWhen you copy the exact words or a unique phrase\n\nWhen you reprint any diagrams, illustrations, charts, pictures, or other visual materials\n\nWhen you reuse or repost any digital media, including images, audio, video, or other media\n\nThere are certain things that do not need documentation or credit, including:\n\nWriting your own lived experiences, your own observations and insights, your own thoughts, and your own conclusions about a subject\n\nWhen you are writing up your own results obtained through lab or field experiments\n\nWhen you use your own artwork, digital photographs, video, audio, etc.\n\nWhen you are using \"common knowledge,\" things like folklore, common sense observations, myths, urban legends, and historical events (but not historical documents)\n\nWhen you are using generally accepted facts (e.g., pollution is bad for the environment) including facts that are accepted within particular discourse communities (e.g., in the field of composition studies, \"writing is a process\" is a generally accepted fact).\n\n(From Plagiarism FAQs - Purdue Writing Lab)\n\nThe following chart from the UT Arlington Library Acknowledging Sources tutorial will guide you in your decision:\n\nWhat is common knowledge? This refers to facts well known by many people and verifiable in five or more sources. Examples:\n\nBill Gates is the founder of the Microsoft Corporation.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nColumbus is the capital of Ohio.\n\nThe whole is greater than the part."
