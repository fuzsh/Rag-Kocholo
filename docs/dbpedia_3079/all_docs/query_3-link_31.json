        "text": "In Hollywood, it’s best to approach certain promotional tactics with suspicion, perhaps none more so than any movies that claims to be ‘based on a true story’. In many cases, what that typically means is a filmmaker took a small dollop of truth and stretched it as far as it could possibly go. It’s not a big deal, really – these are narrative films, not documentaries, and sometimes, a liberal sprinkling of creative licence is needed to make a story work on screen.\n\nEvery so often, though, a movie comes along that approaches its subject with something close to a journalistic eye, and those are the ones we’ve chosen to highlight here. Among them are Oscar-winning dramas covering major moments in history, salacious crime stories drawn from magazine articles, bizarre character studies and other wild tales no one would believe if they didn’t actually happen. Sometimes, truth really is stranger than fiction — and in these specific situations, it makes for a hell of a great picture.\n\nRecommended:"
