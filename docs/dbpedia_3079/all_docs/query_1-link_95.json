        "text": "When: Friday, main stage, 10.45pm\n\nThe Prodigy\n\nFollowing the tragic death of Keith Flint in 2019, the Prodigy made their return to Ireland last year, including a date Live at the Marquee in Cork. ATN is their first festival appearance since Flint’s death and their live show sounds as incendiary as ever. The great survivors, they’ve appeared at every kind of festival in Ireland here over the year, from Feile 94 alongside Bjork and Elvis Costello to Electric Picnic 2018, headlining with Kendrick Lamar and Massive Attack. We’re not expecting any new songs but once the opening riffs of Breathe and Firestarter hit, we won’t need or want anything else.\n\nWhen: Sunday night, main stage, 10.45pm\n\nJames Vincent McMorrow\n\nThe versatile Irish artist — we can’t call him a singer-songwriter considering how easily he switches up his styles — returned to the sound of debut album Early in the Morning on this year’s brilliant Wide Open, Horses, his seventh studio album. Fresh off a US tour and with a full band behind him, it sounds like McMorrow is on a hot streak right now. Expect his Chris Isaak cover Wicked Game, which featured in Game of Thrones, to take centre stage in his set. He said of his US tour on Instagram: “[The fact that] after all that time away I could come back and play shows as hype as that, is mind blowing… I think it means I’m doing it the right way so I’m going to keep doing it for as long as people want to hear me sing.”\n\nWhen: Friday night, main stage, 9pm\n\nThe Mary Wallopers\n\nSimply put, one of the hottest live properties going right now. A three-piece from Dundalk who balloon to seven on the stage, their take on Pogues-addled folk and trad is irresistible. They played Glastonbury’s hallowed Park Stage at the end of June, drawing all of the Irish at the festival to their set and, as shown at last year’s Gig for Gaza at the 3Arena, the Mary Wallopers rise to the biggest of stages. They played a tent at ATN two years ago and the reaction was eye-opening, a crush of crowd-surfers and airborne pints. Expect something similar this weekend.\n\nWhen: Saturday, main stage, 7.15pm\n\nNatasha Bedingfield\n\nAfter Sugababes’ sunshine-soaked Saturday evening set at last year’s festival, ATN is banking on a similar reaction for Natasha Bedingfield. The English pop star’s biggest hit, Unwritten, came out 20 years ago and has racked up over 1bn streams on Spotify. She’s only released one album in the last 15 years but will be packing covers for ATN — maybe even a cameo from her brother Daniel for his 2001 smash Gotta Get Thru This.\n\nWhen: Saturday, main stage, 5pm\n\nConfidence Man\n\nCharli XCX has ensured it’s a Brat summer and Australia’s Confidence Man are living the maxim. Their track Firebreak was dropped during Charli’s Partygirl Ibiza Boiler Room show recently and the Australian four-piece release their third album 3AM (LA LA LA) in October. The effervescent Janet Planet and Sugar Bones are the stars, dancing and vogueing through their set — often in tandem and on top of each other, utilising wind machines along the way. Holiday might well be the song of the festival.\n\nWhen: Friday, Lovely Days, 10.15pm\n\nFloating Points\n\nThere’s a great dance element to ATN — a Hot Chip DJ set, Ben UFO, and Ireland’s own Mano Le Tough and Or:la all star over the weekend — and Floating Points aka Sam Shepherd is one of the standouts. He released the incredible album Promises, a collaboration with the late Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra, in 2021 but goes deeper and heavier in his solo work. His fifth album Cascade is due out later this year and the tracks released so far are banging.\n\nWhen: Saturday, Something Kind of Wonderful, 10.30pm\n\nKiasmos\n\nComprising Olafur Arnolds and Janus Rasmussen, Kiasmos released their second album II earlier this summer, a decade on from their debut. Drawing from the former’s experience with film scores and the latter’s global DJ sets, it was crafted over years and across continents, including Bali, and made with an Icelandic orchestra. It’s critically acclaimed, of course, and this rare live show might be one we’re talking about for years to come.\n\nWhen: Friday, Something Kind of Wonderful, 11.45pm\n\nThe Wailers\n\nCelebrating the 40th anniversary of Bob Marley’s Legend, The Wailers return to ATN after playing the festival for the first time in 2019. Led by drummer Aston Barrett Jr, who portrayed his father Aston ‘Family Man’ Barrett (who passed away earlier this year) in the film Bob Marley: One Love earlier this year, expect to hear all the Wailers’ hits as they draw on the essential best-of compilation released in 1984.\n\nWhen: Sunday, main stage, 5.15pm\n\nSoda Blonde\n\nOne of the most dynamic live bands in Ireland, led by the sensational Faye O’Rourke, the four-piece recently headlined the National Concert Hall, selling out a show in collaboration with the National Symphony Orchestra. Formerly members of Little Green Cars, they’ve carved their own space and made their own name in the past five or so years, with both their studio records to date being nominated for the Choice Music Prize album of the year. They were one of the acts prominent in pulling out of SXSW in March over its ties with the US army.\n\nWhen: Saturday, Lovely Days, 4pm\n\nKabin Crew to Marian Keyes: Other highlights at ATN\n\nKabin Crew & Lisdoonvarna Crew: The song of the summer gets an airing at the Belonging Bandstand from 4.55pm Saturday Sing Along Social Main stage karaoke kicks things off at 3pm Saturday. Bring your Riverdance shoes and capes.\n\nGlasshouse Ensemble: The Dublin collective perform the music of Ryuichi Sakamoto at Lovely Day, Saturday, 2.30pm Hidden Sounds Tucked away in the woods, this stage will feature intimate performances from Ireland’s Fionn Regan, Muireann Bradley, David Kitt, Niamh Bury, Oisin Leech and more.\n\nAll Curious Minds: A cultural hub brimming with talks and interviews, Marian Keyes will be discussing her career with Irish Examiner columnist Tom Dunne, while Roger Doyle is in conversation, and RTÉ Radio 1’s Louise Duffy will host a special edition of her show.\n\nRTÉ Concert Orchestra: Performing the music of Sinéad O'Connor, Shane MacGowan, and Christy Dignam on the main stage from 3pm Sunday.\n\nThe Bloom: The Bloom stands 16m high and will be the tallest bamboo structure in Europe. This completely unique environment is specially designed and fabricated for ATN by bamboo artist Joseph Williams.\n\nGreencrafts: The Greencrafts Village hosts a number of jewellery making, wood working, textile workshops and more across the weekend Brunch with Panti Bliss Taking place, well, at brunch time on Saturday, Panti Bliss will help soothe any hungover heads.\n\nKids Together: ATN is a family-friendly affair helped by the tranquil space curated by kids event producer Mel Wilds. Features a disco shed, magic shows, and lifesize games."
