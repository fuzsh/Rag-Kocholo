Contact by Carl Sagan has been my favorite sci-fi since high school.

Itâ€™s a novel that more than a novel. The discussion on the relationship between science and religion inspired me to choose computer science as my major and AI as career.

From Ellie, I saw myself. The conquest of science, the escape from parents, and the questioning and self-doubt in love.

The author Carl Sagan is ranked #2 on my personal idol leaderboard. He taught me an important thing about the cosmos: there is a bigger world outside of the world, and it was made on purpose.
