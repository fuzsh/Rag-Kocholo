        "text": "Simply Awesome\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to Contact the most enjoyable?\n\nIt was a good \"easy listening\" experience - not too slow paced, and not too fast either\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nElly - Her determination and resolve are what make her a unique and powerful character.\n\nWhat about Jodie Fosterâ€™s performance did you like?\n\nShe is an excellent reader with a clear voice - and since she played Elly in the movie was able to pull from that performance to make the reading even more authentic.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nI would have liked to listen to it in one sitting, but it turned out being 3 sittings for me - but if I have time another day I will try and listen to it again in one go.\n\nBrilliant, creative science-fiction novel\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nYes I would, this science-fiction novel truly shows the depth of creativity Sagan has combined with his passion for astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Top it off with an outstanding reading from Jodie Foster and this is hands down one of the best audio books around.\n\nAbridged Audio book\n\nI greatly enjoyed this audio book. The original novel is 14+ hours. Lots of details were cut but I read others struggling to finish the full length book, so I got the abridged version, which was perfect for me. Jodie Foster did a great job on the narration. I recommend this book if you liked the movie but don't want to dive into the long unabridged version.\n\nTHIS is the version I love.\n\nAfter getting the unabridged version (14+ hours) and struggling to get even 6 hours into it, I returned it for this version and LOVE IT. I really loved the movie and wanted MORE of CONTACT, but I wasn't prepared for the excruciating pacing and excessive details offered in the unabridged version. While this version could have used more of the actual first contact moments that I found so thrilling, it does make for a much more exciting and thrilling story by being abridged. Jodie Foster does an amazing job on this as well- her energy is very well received and should place her on a short list of actors that do audio books justice.\n\nExciting after the first chapter\n\nA story that details the exploration and endeavor of contacting alien life, going through time and space, and having scientific insights toward understanding the universe just a little bit further. Mutiple characters. Not like the movie.\n\nContact is wonderful\n\nContact is a great read and a great listen. In typical Sagan fashion, the book not only entertains, it challenges and educates. Jodie Foster does an excellent job reading the book so much so that is it easy to get lost listening to it. My only complaint? I wish there was an unabridged version available.\n\nWonderful!!\n\nContact has long been one of my favorite movies - now I have the book as a favorite too!!\n\nIt is a bit different from the movie, more character insight, the only complaint I have is that it is too short - I wish it was not an abridged version.\n\neye opening.\n\none of the things presented in this book was how infinitesimally small we are on this earth and how infinitesimally large the the universe is. How could a deeply religious person believe that God is confined to this earth only?\n\nAs expected... far better than the movie\n\nI fully expected this book to be excellent with Jodi Foster reading, and I was not disappointed. Her oration was excellent and matched the quality of Sagan's imagination.\n\nThe story is fantastically creative, technical, and detailed, yet remains within the realm of possibilities."
