        "text": "1.\n\nOur Story (intro) 01:38\n\n2.\n\nWe Are Star Dust 03:00\n\n[Neil deGrasse Tyson] We are part of this universe We are in this universe The universe is in us Yes, the universe is in us [Lawrence Krauss] Every atom in your body Came from a star that exploded You are all star dust From a star that exploded [Tyson] Look up at the night sky We are part of that The universe itself Exists within us We are star dust In the highest exalted way Called by the universe Reaching out to the universe We are star dust In the highest exalted way Reaching out to the universe With these methods and tools of science [Richard Feynman] Stand in the middle and enjoy everything both ways The tininess of us; The enormity of the universe [Tyson] The atoms that make up the human body Are traceable to the crucibles That cooked light elements Into heavy elements These stars went unstable in their later years And then exploded Scattering their enriched guts Across the galaxy [Refrain] [Tyson] We are part of this universe We are in this universe The universe is in us Yes, the universe is in us\n\n3.\n\nWaves of Light 03:55\n\nWhy are we here? Where do we come from? These are the most enduring of questions. It’s a story we wouldn’t be able to tell without the one thing that connects us vividly to our vast cosmos: Light. Through light we can stare back across the entire history of the universe, and discover how it all began. Those ancient beams of light are messengers from the distant past. And they carry with them a story. The story of the origin of the universe. Gaze up into the night sky Capture the light And read the story of the universe Isn’t it a wonderful thing We are part of the universe Isn’t it a wonderful thing The story of the universe is our story Carried on waves of light Wave after wave after wave of light All the colors of the rainbow, colors of the rainbow Light can transport us to the past And we have become virtual time travelers Night falls, darker and darker And the universe fades into view Night falls, darker and darker Darker and darker Stars being born in distant realms Alien worlds created by gravity Stars that shine with the light of a thousand suns And vast swirling galaxies These waves of light are messengers from across the cosmos. And through them, we have discovered the wonders of our galaxy, frozen in time. Gaze up into the night sky Capture the light And read the story of the universe Isn’t it a wonderful thing We are part of the universe Isn’t it a wonderful thing The story of the universe is our story Carried on waves of light Wave after wave after wave of light All the colors of the rainbow, colors of the rainbow Billions and billions of suns Shining in the sky The story of the universe Carried on waves of light Gaze up into the night sky Capture the light And read the story of the universe\n\n4.\n\nThe Poetry of Reality 03:05\n\n[Michael Shermer] Science is the best tool ever devised For understanding how the world works [Jacob Bronowski] Science is a very human form of knowledge We are always at the brink of the known [Carl Sagan] Science is a collaborative enterprise Spanning the generations We remember those who prepared the way Seeing for them also [Neil deGrasse Tyson] If you're scientifically literate, The world looks very different to you And that understanding empowers you Refrain: [Richard Dawkins] There's real poetry in the real world Science is the poetry of reality [Sagan] We can do science And with it, we can improve our lives [Jill Tarter] The story of humans is the story of ideas That shine light into dark corners [Lawrence Krauss] Scientists love mysteries They love not knowing [Richard Feynman] I don't feel frightened by not knowing things I think it's much more interesting [Brian Greene] There's a larger universal reality of which we are all a part [Stephen Hawking] The further we probe into the universe The more remarkable are the discoveries we make [Carolyn Porco] The quest for the truth, in and of itself, Is a story that's filled with insights (Refrain) [Greene] From our lonely point in the cosmos We have through the power of thought Been able to peer back to a brief moment After the beginning of the universe [PZ Myers] I think that science changes the way your mind works To think a little more deeply about things [Dawkins] Science replaces private predjudice With publicly verifiable evidence (Refrain)\n\n5.\n\nOde to the Brain 03:40\n\n[Robert Winston] It's amazing to consider that I'm holding in my hands The place where someone once felt, thought, and loved For centuries, scientists have been battling to understand What this unappealing object is all about [Vilayanur Ramachandran] Here is this mass of jelly You can hold in the palm of your hands And it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space [Carl Sagan] The brain has evolved from the inside out It's structure reflects all the stages through which it has passed [Jill Bolte Taylor] Information in the form of energy Streams in simultaneously Through all of our sensory systems And then it explodes into this enormous collage Of what this present moment looks like What it feels like And what it sounds like And then it explodes into this enormous collage And in this moment we are perfect We are whole and we are beautiful [Robert Winston] It appears rather gruesome Wrinkled like a walnut, and with the consistency of mushroom [Carl Sagan] What we know is encoded in cells called neurons And there are something like a hundred trillion neural connections This intricate and marvelous network of neurons has been called An enchanted loom The neurons store sounds too, and snatches of music Whole orchestras play inside our heads 20 million volumes worth of information Is inside the heads of every one of us The brain is a very big place In a very small space No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain We can change ourselves Think of the possibilities [Bill Nye] Think of your brain as a newspaper Think of all the information it can store But it doesn't take up too much room Because it's folded [Oliver sacks] We see with the eyes But we see with the brain as well And seeing with the brain Is often called imagination [Various] [Robert Winston] It is the most mysterious part of the human body And yet it dominates the way we live our adult lives It is the brain\n\n6.\n\nWe Are All Connected 04:11\n\n[Neil deGrasse Tyson] We are all connected; To each other, biologically To the earth, chemically To the rest of the universe atomically [Feynman] I think nature's imagination Is so much greater than man's She's never going to let us relax [Sagan] We live in an in-between universe Where things change all right But according to patterns, rules, Or as we call them, laws of nature [Nye] I'm this guy standing on a planet Really I'm just a speck Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck To think about all of this To think about the vast emptiness of space There's billions and billions of stars Billions and billions of specks [Sagan] The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it But the way those atoms are put together The cosmos is also within us We're made of star stuff We are a way for the cosmos to know itself Across the sea of space The stars are other suns We have traveled this way before And there is much to be learned I find it elevating and exhilarating To discover that we live in a universe Which permits the evolution of molecular machines As intricate and subtle as we [deGrasse Tyson] I know that the molecules in my body are traceable To phenomena in the cosmos That makes me want to grab people in the street And say, have you heard this?? (Richard Feynman on hand drums and chanting) [Feynman] There's this tremendous mess Of waves all over in space Which is the light bouncing around the room And going from one thing to the other And it's all really there But you gotta stop and think about it About the complexity to really get the pleasure And it's all really there The inconceivable nature of nature\n\n7.\n\n[Jacob Bronowski] Man is a singular creature; He has a set of gifts which make him unique among the animals So that unlike them, he is not a figure in the landscape He is the shaper of the landscape [Alice Roberts] We are all children of Africa They say this is where it all began [Bronowski] In a parched African landscape Man first put his foot to the ground [Roberts] Africa was our only home for tens of thousands of years until a small handful of people made their way out of Africa [Carolyn Porco] These beings with soaring imagination Eventually flung themselves and their machines Into interplanetary space [Roberts] We are all children of africa This landscape has been home to humans Two hundred thousand years [Porco] We have come so far All of this is cause for great celebration We have come so far This is a story about us [Roberts] Those early Europeans Were people like you and me But it is humbling When you see the challenges they faced People like you and me Overcame the Neaderthals People like you and me Made it through the ice age [Refrain] [Jane Goodall] We are not the only beings With personalities, minds, and feelings Chimpanzees have very clear personalities [Robert Sapolsky] Take a chimp brain foetally And let it go two or three more rounds of division And out comes symphonies and ideology [Neil deGrasse Tyson] Everything that we are That distinguishes us from chimps Emerges from that one percent Difference in DNA [Roberts] People like you and me Overcame the Neaderthals People like you and me Made it through the ice age [Refrain] [David Attenborough] Using his burgeoning intelligence, This most successful of all mammals Has exploited the environment to produce food For an ever increasing population. Instead of controlling the environment For the benefit of the population Perhaps it's time we controlled the population To allow the survival of the environment\n\n8.\n\n[David Attenborough] How could one species turn into another? [Richard Dawkins] How is it that we find ourselves surrounded by such complexity, such elegance? [Bill Nye] The genes of you and me They're all made of DNA We're all made of the same chemicals DNA - we're all made of DNA [Attenborough] Only the fittest survive And that is the key Natural Selection That is the key [Dawkins] We are surrounded by endless forms Most beautiful, most wonderful Evolution - the greatest show on Earth There is grandeur in this view of life Evolution - the greatest show on Earth [Attenborough] The history of life can be thought of As a many branched tree The five kingdoms of life were established early on Bacteria Protists- amoeba like creatures Fungi Plants And animals [Dawkins] We find ourselves perched on one tiny twig In the midst of a blossoming tree of life [refrain] We are surrounded by millions of other species Walking, flying, burrowing, stalking, chasing, fleeing, Outpacing [Attenborough] Animals strive to reach this one ultimate goal To ensure the survival of the next generation This one ultimate goal To pass on their genes That is what life is all about [refrain] [Dawkins] As we look back on the history of life We see a picture of never ending, ever rejuvinating novelty [Attenborough] Those animals may seem to us to be very remote, strange, even fantastic But all of us alive today Owe our very existence to them\n\n9.\n\nA Glorious Dawn 03:30\n\n[Carl Sagan] If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch You must first invent the universe Space is filled with a network of wormholes You might emerge somewhere else in space Some when-else in time The sky calls to us If we do not destroy ourselves We will one day venture to the stars A still more glorious dawn awaits Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise A morning filled with 400 billion suns The rising of the milky way The Cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths Of exquisite interrelationships Of the awesome machinery of nature I believe our future depends powerfully On how well we understand this cosmos In which we float like a mote of dust In the morning sky But the brain does much more than just recollect It inter-compares, it synthesizes, it analyzes it generates abstractions The simplest thought like the concept of the number one Has an elaborate logical underpinning The brain has its own language For testing the structure and consistency of the world [Hawking] For thousands of years People have wondered about the universe Did it stretch out forever Or was there a limit From the big bang to black holes From dark matter to a possible big crunch Our image of the universe today Is full of strange sounding ideas [Sagan] How lucky we are to live in this time The first moment in human history When we are in fact visiting other worlds The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean Recently we've waded a little way out And the water seems inviting\n\n10.\n\nSecret of the Stars 03:40\n\nSay, do you like mystery stories? Well we have one for you. The concept: relativity. That strange fantastic relationship between time, distance, and mass. Before we're finished, I think you'll agree that truth is stranger than the strangest fiction. Why do the stars shine? Why does the galaxy light up? E equals MC squared That is the engine that lights up the stars Energy turns into mass E equals MC squared - That is the secret of the stars Now listen carefully: The faster you move THe heavier you get The energy of motion turns into M, your mass Energy of motion Energy equals Mass times the speed of light squared An awful lot of energy For a tiny amount of mass Light travels at the same speed No matter how you look at it No matter how I move, relative to you, Light travels at the same speed No matter who is doing the measurement And no matter what direction you are moving The speed of light is the same No matter what direction, or how fast As you travel faster Time slows down Everything slows down Time slows down when you move Time passes at a different rate Clocks run slow It's a monumental shift in how we see the world The beauty, the majesty, The power of the universe Into a single equation (refrain) It's a beautiful piece of science It's a beautifuly elegant theory It's a beautiful piece of science A planet like the Earth is kept in orbit Because it follows curves In the spatial fabric caused By the sun's presence Space and time are bent by stars and planets As things move through this curved space, they bend Now all of this is illustration of the fact that time and space are linked together. As you're moving through bent and curved space and time, You feel like you feel a force (x2) That force is gravity (refrain) That is the secret of the stars\n\n11.\n\nMonsters of the Cosmos 03:25\n\nThere are monsters out in the cosmos That can swallow entire stars Inside these equations, there's a monster Anything that strays too close will be pulled in Gravity is infinite at the center of black hole Time stops - space makes no sense Every galaxy has got one big black hole in the middle And millions of smaller black holes An anomaly of gravity so strange Nothing is more seductive There are monsters out in the cosmos That can swallow entire stars That can destroy space itself Completely invisible Anything that strays too close will be pulled in In the last century, black holes have gone from being mathematical curiosities To real objects in the cosmos Seemingly crucial to the formation of galaxies Nothing can escape it, even light There must be millions and millions of black holes Zipping around our galaxy, nothing there to light them up At the heart of a large black hole is a singularity It's a point of inifinite density The accepted laws of physics break down Black holes form when giant stars run out of fuel And collapse under their own weight Dark remnants of burned out stars Truth is stranger than sci-fi (refrain) Nothing is bigger and scarier than a black hole A boundary between the known universe And a place beyond the reach of science\n\n12.\n\nBeyond the Horizon 04:09\n\nBill Nye: We are at a time in history where we can change the world What do we want to pass on to future generations? That we just stayed here on Earth, that we didn’t look out to find out where we come from and are we alone? No! We want to pass on this joy. This excitement. Neil deGrasse Tyson: When a nation dreams big, everything falls into place. Nye: Beyond the horizon Over the next hill That’s where we make discoveries Tyson: That’s the next frontier Nye: It is in us to look farther and deeper It’s deep within us That is why we are all here Over the next hill, beyond the horizon Tyson: Dream of tomorrow Long for the open seas Call for this adventure Dream big Dream of tomorrow Long for the open seas Emily Lakdawalla: There are lots of huge frozen worlds Caught beyond Neptune Huge frozen worlds Seek out these other worlds Hundreds of other worlds Caught beyond Neptune Seek out these other worlds Tyson: Audacious visions have the power to alter mindsets To change assumptions about what is possible [refrain] Nye: If we are to discover life on another world, It will change the way everyone feels about what it is to be a living thing in the Cosmos. Tyson: Is a virus alive? Is crystal alive? Does life need this, does life need liquid water? Is a virus alive? Does life have metabolism? Does life need, life need, life need, life need this? Is a virus alive? Is crystal alive? They’re asking these questions Bill Nye: Working together I claim we can Change the world! Carl Sagan: There’s just a tremendously exciting prospect called solar sailing And it works exactly as an ordinary sailboat does It takes you to where you wanna go It’s a whole new kind of idea It travels on the wind from the sun X2 Tyson: These dreams prevail in the citizen’s ambitions. It is time to set sail for the 21st Century. [refrain] Tyson: Find your place in space Space is vast and unexplored And there’s a lot of work to do.\n\n13.\n\n[Dr. Alice Roberts] How can we start to come close to animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago? Dinosaurs [Jack Horner] Dinosaurs [Bill Nye] Dinosaurs Di-Di-Dinosaurs [Dallas Campbell] Dinosaurs weren't just giant lizards But a truly unique kind of reptile [Narrator 1] Dinosaurs roamed For more than 150 million years Dinosaurs roamed In amazing shapes and sizes Very few left evidence of their existence And those bones never cease to fascinate us [Roberts] The more we find The more complete our understanding Utterly awe-inspiring The world of the dinosaurs [Campbell] There are always new discoveries out there Waiting to be found [Narrator 2] Tyrannosaurus, the largest flesh eater The world has ever seen Dinosaurs - all the dinosaurs- Followed a well trod trail to oblivion [Narrator 1] Rock layers span the age of dinosaurs The deeper the layer, the older the rock At the top - rock from the Cretaceous Below that, the Jurassic And near the bottom, red Triassic badlands When dinosaurs first appeared (dino breakdown) [Nye] 65 million years ago [Nigel Marvin] A meteorite smashed into the Earth [Nye] Hurtling toward our planet At a hundred thousand kilometers a second [Roberts] If we'd never found their bones, We wouldn't ever have known These ancient animals ever existed (refrain)\n\n14.\n\nThe Unbroken Thread 03:58\n\n[David Attenborough] All life is related And it enables us to construct with confidence The complex tree that represents the history of life Our planet, the Earth, is as far as we know Unique in the universe; it contains life Here plants and animals proliferate in such numbers That we still have not even named all the different species Darwin's great insight revolutionized the way in which we see the world We now understand why there are so many different species [Carl Sagan] Every cell is a triumph of natural selection And we're made of trillions of cells (Within us is a little universe) Those are some of the things that molecules do Given four billions years of evolution (We are, each of us, a multitude) Now how did the molecules of life arise? [Attenborough] It began in the sea Some 3 thousand million years ago Complex chemical molecules began to clump together These were the \"seeds\" From which the tree of life developed They were able to split, replicating themselves As bacteria do [Sagan] The secrets of evolution Are time and death There's an unbroken thread that stretches From those first cells to us (refrain) [Jane Goodall] There isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom It's a very wuzzie line It's a very wuzzie line, and it's getting wuzzier All the time We find animals doing things that we, In our arrogance, Used to think was \"just human\" (refrain) [Attenborough] Its continued survival now rests in our hands\n\n15.\n\nThe Nature of Sound 03:10\n\n16.\n\nOnward to the Edge 03:36\n\n[Neil deGrasse Tyson] The act of moving onward means we pass these sign posts One of them was first leaving earth The next one is hanging out on the moon What's next? The planets Onward to the edge We're moving onward to the edge Here we are together This fragile little world [Brian Cox] This is our sun Just another star in a sea of stars The heart of the solar system Just another star in a sea of stars Mercury is the closest planet This tortured piece of rock has been stripped naked [Tyson] The moon has a sky It has a horizon It's another world It's got earth in the sky Just the way we have the moon in the sky (refrain) We're not the only world to think about Worlds unnumbered We're not the only world to think about Think about worlds unnumbered [Carolyn Porco] There is a powerful recognition That stirs within us When we see our own little blue ocean planet In the skies of other worlds The Saturn system Offers splendor beyond compare Because of its rings And very diverse moons [Tyson] These are no longer abstractions These are worlds Maybe there's life there They've changed how we think about Earth [Cox] A mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam The pale blue dot (refrain) The laws of nature create Vastly different worlds With the tiniest of changes [Tyson] When I reach to the edge of the universe I do so knowing that along some paths of cosmic discovery There are times when, at least for now, One must be content to love the questions themselves\n\n17.\n\nChildren of Planet Earth 04:38\n\n18.\n\nThe Case for Mars 04:02\n\n[Robert Zubrin] Mars is the next logical step In our space program It's the challenge that's been staring us in the face For the past 30 years It has water, it has carbon, It has a 24 hour day It has geothermal energy Mars is a place we can settle [Carl Sagan] There is a giant rift in its surface 5,000 kilometers long There is a volcano as wide as Arizona [Zubrin] So there's the choice in life One either grows or one decays Grow or die I think we should grow [Sagan] Mars is a world of wonders [Brian Cox] It has canyons, river valleys, and giant ice sheets [Sagan] Mars is a world of wonders [Zubrin] It shouldn't be humans to Mars in 50 years It should be humans to Mars in 10 We either muster the courage to go Or we risk the possibility of stagnation and decay We've got cosmic radiation Zero gravity Martian dust storms Back contamination But these are dragons that we can take on [Sagan] In our time we have sifted The sands of Mars Established a presence there And fulfilled a century of dreams [Cox] The Mars rovers have really Captured our imaginations They genuinely are explorers In the old-fashioned sense [Zubrin] If you put out a call For volunteers for the first crew to Mars They'd be lined up coast to coast (refrain) [Cox] Mars is a dry frozen version of our home Covered in red dust and sand [Penelope Boston] At one time In the ancient past Mars was very similar To the conditions of early earth [Zubrin] There will always be people with new ideas On how humans should live together [Cox] We now have \"eyes\" and \"ears\" on the surface [Zubrin] What's left after you go is The good you've left behind You have to believe in hope You have to believe in the future There are more and more people coming around to the point of view that A positive future for humanity requires human expansion to space (refrain) We're at a crossroads today We either muster the courage to go Or we risk the possibility of stagnation and decay\n\n19.\n\nThe Quantum World 03:30\n\n[Morgan Freeman] So, what are we really made of? Dig deep inside the atom and you'll find tiny particles Held together by invisible forces Everything is made up Of tiny packets of energy Born in cosmic furnaces [Frank Close] The atoms that we're made of have Negatively charged electrons Whirling around a big bulky nucleus [Michio Kaku] The Quantum Theory Offers a very different explanation Of our world [Brian Cox] The universe is made of Twelve particles of matter Four forces of nature That's a wonderful and significant story [Richard Feynman] Suppose that little things Behaved very differently Than anything big Nothing's really as it seems It's so wonderfully different Than anything big The world is a dynamic mess Of jiggling things It's hard to believe [Kaku] The quantum theory Is so strange and bizzare Even Einstein couldn't get his head around it [Cox] In the quantum world The world of particles Nothing is certain It's a world of probabilities (refrain) [Feynman] It's very hard to imagine All the crazy things That things really are like Electrons act like waves No they don't exactly They act like particles No they don't exactly [Stephen Hawking] We need a theory of everything Which is still just beyond our grasp We need a theory of everything, perhaps The ultimate triump of science (refrain) [Feynman] I gotta stop somewhere I'll leave you something to imagine\n\n20.\n\nA Wave of Reason 03:41\n\nBertrand Russell: When you are studying any matter Or considering any philosophy Ask yourself only: what are the facts, And what is the truth that the facts bear out Carl Sagan: Science is more than a body of knowledge It's a way of thinking A way of skeptically interrogating the universe If we are not able to ask skeptical questions To be skeptical of those in authority Then we're up for grabs Michael Shermer: In all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory Sam Harris: You don't have to delude yourself With Iron Age fairy tales Carolyn Porco: The same spiritual fulfillment That people find in religion Can be found in science By coming to know, if you will, the mind of God Lawrence Krauss: The real world, as it actually is, Is not evil, it's remarkable And the way to understand the physical world is to use science Richard Dawkins: There is a new wave of reason Sweeping across America, Britain, Europe, Australia South America, the Middle East and Africa There is a new wave of reason Where superstition had a firm hold Phil Plait: Teach a man to reason And he'll think for a lifetime Sagan: Cosmology brings us face to face with the deepest mysteries With questions that were once treated only in religion and myth The desire to be connected with the cosmos Reflects a profound reality But we are connected; not in the trivial ways That Astrology promises, but in the deepest ways Richard Feynman: I can't believe the special stories that have been made up About our relationship to the universe at large Look at what's out there; it isn't in proportion Russell: Never let yourself be diverted By what you wish to believe But look only and surely At what are the facts James Randi: Enjoy the fantasy, the fun, the stories But make sure that there's a clear sharp line Drawn on the floor To do otherwise is to embrace madness\n\n21.\n\nThe Face of Creation 01:38\n\n22.\n\nThe Big Beginning 03:00\n\n[Hawking] We observe that distant galaxies are moving away from us They must have been closer together in the past It was the beginning of the universe And of time itself Anything that happened before the big bang Could not affect what happened after [Dawkins] The poetry of the expanding universe The poetry of the complexity of life We're not normally equipped to understand And science gives it to us Science is opening your eyes To the wonderfulness of what's there Science is opening your eyes To the poetry of the expanding universe [Sagan] The early cosmos was everywhere white hot But then as time passed The radiation expanded and cooled Then little pockets of gas began to grow Steadily brightening, we call them the galaxies [Shears] In the big bang we had equal amounts of matter and anti-matter And as soon as they met each other, They annihilated together And this battle played out Whilst the universe expanded In its first minute of existence [DeGrasse Tyson] It's not all that hard to detect the big bang All you need to do is change the channel Until you come between two stations About one percent of the snow and noise Comes from the big bang itself We're all eavesdropping On the birth pangs of the cosmos\n\n23.\n\n[Narrator] With every century Our eyes on the universe have been opened anew We are witness To the very brink of time and space [Robert Jastrow] We must ask ourselves We who are so proud of our accomplishments What is our place in the cosmic perspective of life? [Carl Sagan] The exploration of the cosmos Is a voyage of self discovery As long as there have been humans We have searched for our place in the cosmos [Richard Dawkins] Are there things about the universe That will be forever beyond our grasp? Are there things about the universe that are Ungraspable? [Sagan] One of the great revelations of space exploration Is the image of the earth, finite and lonely Bearing the entire human species Through the oceans of space and time [Dawkins] Matter flows from place to place And momentarily comes together to be you Some people find that thought disturbing I find the reality thrilling [Sagan] As the ancient mythmakers knew We're children equally of the earth and the sky In our tenure on this planet, we've accumulated Dangerous evolutionary baggage We've also acquired compassion for others, Love for our children, And a great soaring passionate intelligence The clear tools for our continued survival [Michio Kaku] We could be in the middle Of an inter-galactic conversation And we wouldn't even know [Sagan] We've begun at last To wonder about our origins Star stuff contemplating the stars Tracing that long path Our obligation to survive and flourish Is owed not just to ourselves But also to that cosmos Ancient and vast, from which we spring\n\n24.\n\nOur Biggest Challenge 03:47\n\n[David Attenborough]: We are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behavior Now, we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced. [Bill Nye]: The same thing that keeps the Earth warm May make the Earth too warm It holds in heat Methane, Chloroflourocarbons, water vapor and Carbon dioxide - they all trap heat Methane, Chloroflourocarbons, water vapor and Carbon dioxide - they all trap heat [Isaac Asimov]: It is important that the world get together To face the problems which attack us as a unit [Richard Alley]: The evidence is clear [Nye]: The globe is getting too warm [Alley]: We can avoid climate catastrophes We can do this [Nye]: We can change the world [Alley]: Science offers us answers To these huge challenges [Nye]: It's one global ecosystem [Alley]: We can do this [Nye]: We can change the world Every single thing every one of us does Affects everybody all over the world It's one global ecosystem Warm, wet, cold or dry Climates all start in the sky When the C02 is high, the temperature is high Moving together in lock step When the C02 is low, the temperature is low Moving together (refrain) [Richard Alley]: Our use of fossil fuels for energy is pushing us towards a climate unlike any seen in the history of civilization Adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere Warms things up The rise in C02 Comes from burning fossil fuels When you burn them, add oxygen That makes C02 that goes in the air We're reversing the process by which they formed [Asimov]: We're talking about something That affects the entire Earth Problems that transcend nations.\n\n25."
