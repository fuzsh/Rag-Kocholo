        "text": "üëãPre-orders are on for an absolute must-read book of 2024 that will help you find your innermost talents! Written by polymath and philosopher-mathematician Prof. Vijaya Kumar Murty, this book can change the world: critical now more than ever. It will be the first book out under the banner of Sutherland House Experts. Giants in business, philosophy, academia, and the arts offer deserved advanced praise for this remarkable book... üëâHere‚Äôs what Vikas Swarup, author of the international bestseller Q & A, adapted into film as ‚ÄúSlumdog Millionaire,‚Äù winner of Best Film for 2009 at the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards and BAFTA Awards says about this landmark work by Kumar Murty: \"Drawing from the wisdom of Vivekananda and the Upanishads, this enlightening book offers a global audience insight into unlocking their innate talents and navigating the journey of self-discovery.\" üëâRay Sharma, Founder and CEO of Extreme Venture Partners: \"Dr. Murty and this book propose an evolved model of thought‚Äîone that merges science and spirituality without contradiction. He presents a convincing narrative where evolution and spirituality are complementary not competing forces. As asserted in the chapter on good wishes, it is my wish that all who have the good fortune of reading this book benefit from his unique perspective as a thought leader in both mathematics as well as in matters of a spiritual nature.\" üëâMatilde Marcolli, Robert F. Christy Professor of Mathematics and Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech: \"The long philosophical tradition of Vedanta that these reflections are imbued with, from the reading of the classics to the experience of modernity, presents itself as a discipline of individual development, toward the full realization of human possibility.\" üëâArthur Ripstein, University Professor of Law and Philosophy, Howard Beck Q.C. Chair in Law, University of Toronto: \"Kumar Murty is a one-person interdisciplinary university department. In addition to his ground-breaking contributions to Mathematics, he has now given us a fascinating book about human development, spirituality, self-doubt and self-discipline. Patiently developing his ideas in an engaging and accessible way, Murty explores traditional Indian thought as well as modern science.\" üëâGreg Kelly, Executive Producer, CBC Radio IDEAS: \"Until now, I'd never come across a book by a professional mathematician who draws on ancient Indian philosophy and modern research to invite us all to reach for our higher selves. Given how polarized and foreclosed our own epoch too often feels, The Science of Human Possibilities couldn't have arrived at a more urgent time.\" ‚ùÑPre-order now ‚òü and repost widely!‚ùÑ https://lnkd.in/gxqaHcan The Fields Institute For Research In Mathematical Sciences Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto Massey College Sutherland House Books Sydney Druckman Sheila Penton David Ratner Shalomi Ranasinghe"
