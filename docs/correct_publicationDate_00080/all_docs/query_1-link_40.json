        "text": "December 20, 2017\n\nIf you are into astronomy, planetary science, and skepticism, the name Carl Sagan would frequently appear in the texts you're reading or the videos you're watching. Carl Sagan was an astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist, astrobiologist and especially science popularizer. He made his name known by his enthusiasm in explaining scientific concepts in interesting pieces that could be picked up by non-scientist audience, especially the young. His poetic explanations and endless imaginations captured many people's attention and influenced many children and teenagers to peruse their careers in science and technology.\n\n\"Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos\" is a biography of Carl written by William Poundstone. We explore his life from when he was young boy captivated by the nature of stars - the big balls of gases just like our Sun, but far far away. As soon as he was told that be could be paid to be an astronomer interrogating the Universe, his future was set.\n\nApart from his career as professor in Harvard and later Cornell, Carl Sagan was an important figure in SETI, Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. By this status, we would presume he believed in flying saucers and human abductions, but as much as he wanted to confirm the existence of the extraterrestrials, he rigorously questioned everything; he usually said, \"extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence,\" and this philosophy was what he lived by until the end of his life. However, he was usually the one that gave new ideas a chance to emerge and not easily dismissed them just because they were different from his belief. For example, when Carl worked in NASA's Viking I and II mission, he was among the first to be excited by the idea of living microbes being on Mars, the idea that was dismissed by many people. Despite the negative result against the evidence of the Martians, his optimism about extraterrestrial life still didn't die out.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing Carl Sagain did for the scientific community was to raise the awareness of the importance of science and technology in human world. To the public, science was for old white men in laboratories and normal people would not be able to understand it, but he tried to show them differently. His television series \"Cosmos\" was watched by half a billion people worldwide, increasing the public's interest in science and encouraging young people to embark on the similar career.\n\nAnother contribution Carl Sagan did to our society was to challenge superstition and pseudo-science. He didn't immediately dismiss the possibility of those events happening in our world, but the evidence to support their claims are weak and could be proven wrong by science. In his words, “for me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.”\n\nPerhaps the least well-known role he played was his stand against the nuclear war that was on the brink of reality caused by the two superpowers during the Cold War. He and his colleagues did a research on this issue and predict that a nuclear winter would follow regional nuclear wars that could cause catastrophe, especially famine worldwide. Although it turned out that the prediction was not as accurate as it would be in real life, the danger of nuclear winter was still a possibility that could devastate human population. Partly due to his loud concern and actions against the nuclear war and his closeness with the Russians, people from both sides acknowledged the dangers and started understanding and opposing against this madness.\n\nSome scientists disliked Carl Sagan and refused to vote for him to be the member of the Academy of Science, and their reason was Carl didn't do enough science in his career. I am not a scientist (yet), but being the first to predict Venus's atmospheric temperature and the reasons behind it, being among the first to hypothesize the ocean of liquid compounds on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (which was later confirmed by Galileo spacecraft), correctly predicting the seasonal change in Mars causing the color change, being among the first to do a research and experiments on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and many more are quite enough to make Sagan a proper scientist.\n\nCarl Sagan might have a successful career and a happy third marriage, but his first two marriages and the relationship with one of his children were not what he wanted.\n\nI've admired many people in the past and present, but I never consider them my \"idol;\" Carl Sagan is the exception. After reading his 13 books, I managed to alter myself to be a more curious, humble, and open-minded but not too much that my brain falls out. His \"Pale Blue Dot\" speech remains the single most touching and mind blowing writing I've ever heard, and if there is one speech I want every one to listen, it would be that one. Below is the speech I referred to:\n\n“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\n\nThe Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.\n\nOur posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\n\nThe Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.\n\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”\n\nThis book alone is not enough to reveal how important Carl Sagan was. Only after one watched his series and read his books that one would be able to get the whole picture of why people consider Carl Sagan as one of a great homo sepiens. We don't worship Carl Sagan, but we thank him for his contribution to our understanding of the Universe and his hard work to take science out of the laboratories to the public for non-scientist audiences to enjoy the beauty of nature, too.\n\nTwenty one years ago today, Carl Sagan left the Earth, but his enthusiasm and curiousity are still with people who want to learn science, to question the Universe, to wonder what is out there waiting to be discovered, and to be awed by the beauty of nature. So when we ask, \"where are you, Carl?\" Carl is still here.\n\nP.S. I want to express my hearitest appreciation to my idiot Sok Sovanratha for buying this book for me, and my parents for paying it.\n\nMore book review at https://menglongstarstuff.wordpress.com\n\nNovember 7, 2007\n\nMark Twain once said, \"Anybody can have ideas--the difficulty is to express them without squandering a quire of paper on an idea that ought to be reduced to one glittering paragraph.\" The quote couldn't be more apt than when examining this work. I initially started to read this book being interested in Carl Sagan the person and what he had to say. I came away feeling it was a tedious chore.\n\nFirst off, the book is divided into short subsections that make for easy stopping points. The initial happenings start like most biographies do by tracing Sagan's roots starting from his Grandparents on down. It details his early childhood and precocious nature which was evident from the start. The story quickly moves on to his early commitment to be an astronomer even though this wasn't regarded highly at the time. Throughout the book Carl's marriages are also discussed in some detail. My major complaint with the book starts with all of the dreadful descriptions of every single scientific project Sagan worked on. Even after the reader gets the gist the writer continues to drone on and on about what I felt were insignificant details to the extent they were described. For example, Sagan was a big proponent of a nuclear winter theory. The idea being that nuclear war would adversely affect the climate by cooling it and possibly leading to the complete demise of life as we know it. Well, Poundstone elaborates on this for close to 100 pages. At one point I had to flip to the cover of the book to make sure I hadn't picked up a book about nuclear holocaust or annihilation. Poundstone also goes into monotonous detail over every one of the Viking, Voyager, Pioneer, and Seti projects that Sagan worked on. My question would be-is this all there was to Carl Sagan? Was his work more important than who he was as a person?\n\nThe writer's language also does not flow very well. He is far from eloquent. He seems bright enough but everything seems forced and tentative like he is trying to think of what to say and how to say it. Sometimes this leads to non sequitur types of passages. As I was reading I kept feeling like I was missing some punch line. Eventually, I realized I wasn't missing anything but it was simply the writer's inability to communicate.\n\nOne good thing I felt the writer did do was display Sagan's faults and shortcomings. We are led to see that he was often egotistical, dismissing of former close friends, and not always a very good father. His friend's opinions of him are also revealed in somewhat explicit detail. For these reasons I feel the book isn't a complete waste but overall I was left with a feeling of distaste for it."
