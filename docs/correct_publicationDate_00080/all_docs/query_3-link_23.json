        "text": "Reclaiming the dismal science:* The track to becoming an associate professor of economics -- the dismal science -- was sometimes … dismal. In fact, there is research that shows that the more economics classes you take the more selfish you become. After completing all my Ph.D. courses (perhaps at peak selfishness), I met Dr. Elinor Ostrom (the first woman to win the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel). Dr. Ostrom reminded me that throughout the world and across time communities have worked together to manage their resources and their environment to overcome the tragedy of the commons predicted by the dismal science. In this book Dr. Ostrom wrote:\n\n“As long as individuals are viewed as prisoners [such as in the famous prisoner’s dilemma], policy prescriptions will address this metaphor. I would rather address the question of how to enhance the capabilities of those involved to change the constraining rules of the game to lead to outcomes other than the remorseless tragedies” (p. 6-7).\n\nInspired by Dr. Ostrom, I hope that through my tenure at Penn State and research on the design of environmental and land-use policies I can “facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans,”** making economics a bit less dismal in the process.\n\n*Economics was labelled the dismal science by Thomas Carlyle in 1849 because the supply and demand of free market economics did not provide Carlyle the justification that he wanted to promote slavery (Dixon, R. (1999). The Origin of the Term\" Dismal Science\" to Describe Economics. Department of Economics, University of Melbourne).\n\n** Ostrom, E. (2010). Beyond markets and states: polycentric governance of complex economic systems. American Economic Review, 100(3), p.665\n\nMy first homework from the English writing class in my freshman year of college was to write a short essay about the favorite book, and I chose The Thorn Birds. I just read the book that summer and was still somehow lost in it. I wrote about how the book taught me to embrace the full flavor of life and inspired me to go and explore the big world out there. The next class, the professor randomly distributed our essays back and told us to grade one other’s work. My heart skipped a beat when I saw in my assignment the same book being discussed. After class, a girl came by and talked to me. She was the one writing the other essay, and guess what, she was also blindly assigned to grade my work.\n\nNo matter how many new books I’ve read, The Thorn Birds will always remain as the most special one. Thanks to it, I found my better half and soulmate of lifetime. It has been almost twenty years since I first talked with my wife on that sunny, September afternoon. Yet, it feels like only yesterday. Together, we have embraced so many ups and downs in life, and I cannot wait to continue exploring the world with her.\n\nWritten by a biologist and ecologist who viewed ecological systems through holistic means, this book presents an understanding of the actual distribution of vegetation throughout western Europe. This reflects an important step from theoretical ecology, which had previously focused on understanding the fundamental niche, to applied ecology by describing the realized niche—under what conditions vegetation actually occurs on the landscape. As such, it contains an absolute wealth of natural history observations placed within a conceptual framework provided by ecological theory. Further, this work reflect one of the first large-scale efforts to classify and map vegetation, which is fundamental to monitoring temporal change and determining experimentally the impacts of disturbance. Having thus laid the foundation, the author and other researchers were then able to subsequently contrast disturbed and undisturbed communities and begin to recognize the mechanisms responsible for compositional change. What was pioneering work in the first half of the 20th century in Europe remains an important goal in the first half of the 21st century in North America; whereas theory has continued to evolve, the foundational natural history knowledge in this region of the world lags behind. Having been exposed to this book has greatly influenced my outlook on the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nThe Having of Wonderful Ideas by Eleanor Duckworth represents a powerful collection of concepts about teaching and learning that has shaped my thinking about science education. Duckworth was not the first, nor will she be the last, to share these ideas; however, she does so in a way that resonates with educators and speaks to the human spirit.\n\nI have re-discovered this book at several critical junctures in my career. First, as a beginning science teacher in Houston, TX, I was drawn to Duckworth's progressive ideas about children's thinking. Engaging learners with phenomena and supporting them in constructing explanations from evidence is an approach that has transformed my teaching and remains the focal point of my scholarship. I encountered The Having of Wonderful Ideas again as a graduate student at The University of Michigan. This time, my interest came from Duckworth's interactions with prospective teachers, having them participate as learners of science as part of the process of learning to teach science. Most recently, as a teacher educator working in the PSU-SCASD Elementary Professional Development School Program, Duckworth's book has again informed my thinking about teacher development and the role of teacher research.\n\nEach time I have encountered The Having of Wonderful Ideas, I brought a new lens to my reading of it, and each time it has been meaningful to me in different and exciting ways.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to approach difficult times/situations with the “Just do it” way, and I believed it usually solved the problems. As I got older, I realized that the “Just do it” way only minimized the problems without any resolutions to the questions of “Why?” and “How?” The Purpose Driven Life addresses these questions by providing the forty-day journey of enlightening and inspiring biblical-based real-life stories and discussions. Each chapter ends with the “Point to Ponder” and “Questions to Consider.” This book showed me the importance of “the purpose driven life” by providing the big picture of how all pieces of my life fit together. As a Christian, a husband, and the father of my children, this book provided the foundation of my perspectives in guiding our family to live in a “purpose-driven” way. Importantly, this book, at its most fundamental level, also helped me to effectively teach and mentor the next generation of medical doctors and scientists in a “purpose-driven” way.\n\nThis book on many levels represents my path to academic librarianship. As soon as I could read I fell in love. My parents constantly read for both scholarly pursuits and pleasure. They would indulge my curiosity for reading and information by reading and discussing with me historical events and ideologies related to those grown-up books. As I got older, I went from a passive listener to an active learner. My mother, while completing her dissertation in American Studies at St. Louis University, capitalized on my interest and frequently took me to both the university and public library to do research. In these libraries I learned the tricks of the trade, searching magazines and newspapers on microfilm and microfiche or identifying books using the text-based online catalog. When it was time for me to get my first job as a teenager, my mother took me to St. Louis Public Library where I was employed as a shelver. This allowed her to spend even more time in her favorite place, the library. As an undergraduate I worked at my college library, during which time I decided after graduation to pursue a master's degree in library science and become an academic librarian.\n\nMules and Dragons, both in dissertation and book form, was my hands-on introduction to the concepts of primary and secondary sources. I learned the importance of developing a research strategy. I gained an understanding of the concept and importance of interdisciplinary research. Black studies and women's studies became the center of my scholarship, and I brought it to those for whom it was at the margins. I developed a passion for intellectual curiosity and academia. I learned not only to think, but to think independently and ask questions. Most importantly, I forged a scholarly bond with my mother. Dr. Mary E. Young loved research, writing, and libraries. It is with pride that on the event of my tenure and promotion I select her book that she dedicated to me.\n\nWow! Sharing a book with others in this fashion can get personal really fast. Why choose this book? First, Solomon once said that there is nothing new under the sun. This is most true when one considers questions of faith, spirituality, and meaning. For me this book by N.T. Wright has an amazing capacity to discuss timeless questions in a new and engaging way. Why is justice fair? Why are so many people pursuing spirituality? Why do we crave relationship? And why is beauty so beautiful? N. T. Wright argues that each of these questions takes us into the mystery of who God is and what he wants from us.\n\nSecond, I wrestled with the desire to recommend adding a book that would be timeless and selecting a book that was not already part of the collection. It is a risk at this juncture to claim that this book will be enduring, but I can settle in my own conscience that I selected a book that will add further to the breadth and depth of the collection. Finally, it is my hope that like me others will find this book enjoyable, accessible, and meaningful.\n\nBecause the department I am in (Department of Counseling Psychology, Counselor Education, and Rehabilitation Services) is responsible for training school counselors, vocational rehabilitation counselors, and counselors who may specialize in drug and alcohol dependency, this book is of particular interest to me. It does an excellent job in laying the foundation of psychology, counseling, and psychiatry in the United States. More specifically, this book is a must read for students and health care professionals who seek to understand how racism and stereotyping has been a part of the human services (e.g., counseling and psychology) as long as people have been keeping records. The main reason I like this book is because this book displays, through empirical analysis and scrutiny, the roots of racism in the fields that we now call psychology, counseling, and psychiatry. This book also give insight to the many reason pertaining to low utilization rates for counseling services, for example, regarding racial minorities in the United States. A must read for people who like to be challenged!\n\nThe information found in this book will not be found in any of your mainstream psychology texts. Thus, the valuable information for students and professional alike is priceless.\n\nIn 1989, the Voyager 1 spacecraft - then out beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto - was instructed\n\nto turn towards the Sun and take a picture of each of the planets in the Solar System including the Earth. The experiment was motivated by the late astronomer Carl Sagan (1934-1996), author of the bestselling books Dragons of Eden, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, Cosmos, Pale Blue Dot, and many others, who also helped found the premier planetary science journal Icarus and the space-advocacy group known as the Planetary Society. Sagan captivated audiences worldwide through regular appearances on the NBC Tonight Show and in his award-winning 13-episode Cosmos series appearing on PBS in 1980. He was also a powerfully-effective spokesperson for science, scientific literacy, and use of technology for human welfare and world peace. His speech and writing were uplifting and contagious and helped inspire and launch the careers of an entire generation of astronomers. I am a member of the \"Sagan generation\". My research on the habitability of planets was inspired by Sagan who focused his professional attention on origin-of-life scenarios on the Earth, Venus, Mars, and moons of the outer Solar System. Pale Blue Dot was one of Sagan's final books in which he attempted to unify the triumphs and fallacies of all human causes through a single remarkable image captured by the Voyager space probe from the edge of the Solar System in 1989 - an image of a \"pale, blue dot\", the Earth, described by Sagan as a \"mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\"\n\nFrom Pale Blue Dot; Random House; 1994\n\nIt has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.\n\nBut for us, it's different. Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every \"superstar,\" every \"supreme leader,\" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. C. Sagan.\n\nIn A=B, my father and his colleagues presented revolutionary breakthroughs in automating, via computational algorithms, the discovery and proof of a large class of math problems, combinatorial identities. Previously, centuries of labor had gone into proving identities one at a time. The work A=B showed, in very lively and engaging style, that most of the proofs can instead be done by machines, no ingenuity required, and demonstrated that each identity was paired with a counterpart, thus bringing to light large numbers of previously unknown identities. The functions that validate the part and counterpart identities quickly became known as Wilf-Zeilberger (W-Z) pairs.\n\nAn article about my father's role in this work was titled How the Grinch Stole Mathematics (B.A. Cipra, Science 245, 595, 1989). Indeed, A=B opens with the following, bold and absolutely correct statement: \"One of the major themes of the past century has been the growing replacement of human thought by computer programs. Whole areas of business, scientific, medical, and governmental activities are now computerized, including sectors that we humans had thought belonged exclusively to us.\"\n\nMy father believed that knowledge should be freely available to all, and in 1994 he cofounded, with Neil Calkin, The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, which was one of the first electronic journals and also the first open-access journal in mathematics. Originally greeted with much skepticism, that journal now enjoys very high prestige. In keeping with this tradition, A=B itself can be downloaded at no cost, currently at http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html.\n\nI remember well the moments of brilliant insight when my father first made these discoveries, which have inspired me ever since.\n\nThis book has been instrumental in promoting why mathematics needs to be taught with an emphasis on process, reasoning, and making mathematical connections. I have used this book in many of my graduate mathematics education courses to help mathematics teachers see how teaching is a cultural activity. The book compares the methods of teaching mathematics in 231 eighth grade math classrooms in Germany, Japan, and the U.S. What is particularly shocking is learning how the American teachers from the video study emphasize terms and procedures, fail to engage students in mathematical reasoning and proof, and teach mathematics as a set of tedious skills. In my courses, mathematics teachers conduct a critical classroom analysis and look for practices in their classrooms that relate to the description of the typical eighth grade classroom. They are encouraged to describe these practices and look for ways to teach mathematics with a student-centered focus. They begin to see how they need to emphasize reasoning and proof at all grade levels and encourage students to make mathematical connections through inquiry-based activities.\n\nThe Teaching Gap has inspired me to promote effective teaching of mathematics in every mathematics classroom. As a mathematics education professor, I encourage elementary and secondary pre-service teachers to read The Teaching Gap and to see that change in teaching mathematics begins with them.\n\nI chose Christ Stopped at Eboli by Carlo Levi, an Italian Jewish writer and anti-Fascist leader because the novel contains themes intriguing to me personally and professionally. Exiled in 1935 to the remote southern village of Gagliano in the Lucania province of the Mezzogiorno, Levi paints a portrait of a people whose lives are governed by the seasons and a handful of entitled local residents. For the inhabitants of the small village, Christ and the redeeming ideals he embodied did not make it past Eboli, a small town north of Gagliano. For me, the novel asks and sometimes answers universal human questions. How do humans act when they feel abandoned by God, whether stressed by personal failings, bad luck, ill health, or evil dictators? In turn, we often find that of God in ourselves when responding to misfortune. How do we embrace others’ differences with love instead of hatred, appreciation rather than disparagement? Why do life’s misfortunes highlight extreme fragility in some of us and formidable strength in others? How do we incorporate irrational and rational explanations of the same phenomenon? How do insiders view outsiders and vice versa? Levi paints a stark, evocative portrait of the villagers that shows how one isolated spot on earth grapples with these universal questions.\n\n?1991) was a physician and artist who devoted his career to producing paintings that conveyed complex concepts in physiology and anatomy. His paintings are vivid and beautiful depictions of the anatomical consequences of disease, and yet they are not sanitized images which remove the individual person (the patient) from the anatomical system under study. Dr. Netter's paintings inspired me to learn more about cardiovascular function and structure, and each painting provides a guided tour of the system under study. Despite the fact that he completed most of his work over 30 years ago, I believe this book will remain valuable for decades to come. Our names for the various tissues and structures may change over time and our knowledge of their function is constantly developing, but human anatomy itself remains constant. A quote from Dr. Netter captures the care with which he designed his paintings to teach complex concepts. He said, \"the difficult thing about making medical pictures is not the painting at all but rather the study, the thinking, the planning, the creation of a picture so that it says something. Once I have the picture in mind it is easy to put it on paper.\n\nOne painting in particular defines the area of study on which I expect to spend my career. This image (on page 216) is entitled \"Interrelated factors reputedly concerned in the etiology of atherosclerosis. Even 30 years ago, Netter laid out a single model that captured all of the currently important elements in designing preventative strategies for reducing cardiovascular disease. His painting goes beyond the usual listing of cardiovascular risk factors that were known at the time (diet, exercise, smoking, etc) and shows that treatment of cardiovascular disease requires sophisticated understanding of the effects of behavior on biology and an understanding of how multiple risk factors interact to result in disease. The important conceptual breakthrough appears at the bottom of the image. He depicts two major mechanisms that are likely to be responsible for the effects of cardiac risk factors on atherogenesis: changes in lipid metabolism and changes in the susceptibility of the artery wall. The emerging field of interventional cardiology, and my own work, is now focused on reducing the susceptibility of the artery wall to the development of plaques. Dr. Netter's work anticipated this critical development in cardiovascular science and I hope that his paintings will continue to inspire generations of scholars interested in biobehavioral factors that influence human health and physiology.\n\nBuchi Emecheta’s books have inspired me since my grade school days. The Joys of Motherhood is about the African woman negotiating family life in an age that is fast changing; the conflicting cultures of the new vs. the old, where girls are refused education while all of the wealth of the family is invested in the education of the sons. Buchi, who immigrated to Britain as a young woman, wrote many novels while living as a Diaspora African woman writer, becoming the most important and well-known African woman writer of our time. The book and her life as a writer and woman have inspired me in my own career as an African Diaspora woman writer living in the United States. The Joys of Motherhood is about the satisfaction we get from rising above the conflicting cultures of the Africa we so love, and how a woman without much may gain recognition from raising her children well and the satisfaction of motherhood. But deeper still is the theme of a woman’s struggle in a harsh world, about gender issues, issues of tradition and its conflicts placed on ordinary people. Buchi was a pacesetter for us Diaspora women writers from the African continent. I owe much of my own rise as an African Diaspora poet to her prolific talent as a writer and the sacrifices she made to become what she was to us.\n\nRichard Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics for his role in the development of the theory of quantum electrodynamics. Feynman was a masterful teacher, a notorious practical joker, and one of the most colorful characters in physics. He was able to see the universe in a way that is almost magical to everybody else. His 1985 book of reminiscences, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman, was on the New York Times best-seller list for 14 weeks.\n\nAt Caltech, Feynman was asked to \"spruce up\" the teaching of undergraduate physics. After working for three years, he produced a series of lectures for freshman and sophomores, which eventually became the famous Feynman Lectures on Physics. I purchased the Feynman lectures as a freshman physics major, and studied them extensively as an undergraduate. I found Feynman's explanations remarkably lucid and intuitive, and I still find these lectures capivating and inspiring. I have recommended them to many people: from bright high school students to Ph.Ds.\n\nFrom the lectures I also learned the amazing power of mathematics to describe nature. This theme has played a major role in my career as a reseacher and teacher.\n\nI remember picking up this book and reading it after determining that I wanted to conduct qualitative studies in urban and distressed communities. After reading Code of the Street, it opened my eyes to the depth of qualitative research that had been conducted in urban communities and the need for more researchers of color to engage in socially responsible work in these areas. I was fascinated by the eloquence with which Anderson spoke as he described the blueprint of urban life. His culturally relevant research-based text filled in the gaps that were missing from much of the mainstream literature. His words told a very vivid story that inspired me to want to tell the same types of stories in my line of work. As I moved toward building my line of research, I would periodically read a couple of passages to help me keep focused and to know that I was headed down the right path.\n\nI took the course associated with this textbook in the fall of 1982 as an undergraduate chemical engineering student at the University of Akron. The reputation of this course and the high expectations of the instructor who taught the course terrified most students. At the end of thermodynamics from the previous semester the professor advised us to get this book early and study the appendix concerning tensors over the summer. I took his advice and over the summer made the transition from an average passive post high school student to an involved self-directed engineering student. I went on to excel in this course and it changed my whole outlook toward my education. It was due to this course that I understood that I wanted to go on to graduate school.\n\nI have very fond memories of this course and textbook as it represents the first time that I recognized that I could surmount significant academic challenges and could experience the immense satisfaction of doing so.\n\nI remember clearly the first time I heard the name Amartya Sen. He had just won the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \"for his contribution on welfare economics.\" It was a big deal not only for me as a student of economics in Kenya at that time but also to many other economists as his works focus on critical issues of welfare (social and economic justices, freedom, capability, poverty, vulnerability, deprivation, hunger, famine, identity and values) in developing countries. Later in 2001 when I was a graduate student at Western Illinois University, I bought his book -- Development as Freedom -- that was published in 1999. His contribution really touched me when I read the following:\n\nWe live in a world of unprecedented opulence of a kind that could have been hard even to imagine a century or two ago. Yet, we also live in a world with remarkable deprivation, destitution and oppression. There are many new problems as well as old ones including persistence of poverty and unfulfilled elementary needs, occurrence of famines and widespread hunger, violation of elementary political freedoms as well as basic liberties, extensive neglect of the interests and agency of women, and worsening threats to our environment and to the sustainability of our economic and social lives.\n\nProf. Sen is an economist, philosopher and academician with unmatched contributions in welfare economics. He addresses issues that are at the core of ordinary individuals deprived of opportunities in poor countries as well as those marginalized people in advanced countries. The words in this book have not only been my motivation over the years but also my inspiration.\n\nI would not have made it to this point in my academic career, or even had an academic career in the first place, if not for my graduate advisor Mike Schulte. It all began when Mike loaned this book to me a year before I even started graduate school. It was the first textbook I ever read cover to cover, and I learned more from it than any other textbook. Several editions later, this edition is long out of date and may never be taken off the shelf of the library. However, I will smile when I think of it sitting there as a snapshot of the time and a reminder of a simple act that changed my life. Thank you, Mike for everything; you have made more of a difference than you know.\n\nCooked: From the Streets to the Stove, from Cocaine to Foie Gras is the remarkable success story of Jeff Henderson, currently executive chef at Cafe Bellagio in Las Vegas and the first African American to be named chef de cuisine at Caesars Palace Hotel. This riveting memoir is the incredible story of his rollercoaster from high-stakes cocaine dealer to prison inmate to world-class chef. Through sheer determination and desire to “be somebody” once released from prison, Jeff made it his mission to become a chef.\n\nThis book has special meaning to me because while growing up in the small town of Yazoo City, Mississippi, the people of the community often said to the children “You are going to grow up and be somebody.” This testament has gotten me to where I am at today, and carries me on to other aspirations. So choosing this book was natural, as a testament to how when all odds seem against you with perseverance and opportunity, we all can “be somebody,”\n\nOne of the most dazzling minds of the Renaissance --'founder of discursivity' to borrow Michel Foucault's neologism for powerfully original thinkers-- Montaigne has paved the way to transform my conceiving of central issues of the Western philosophical tradition: the status of representation and of imitation, the nature of language and the function of rhetoric, the problematic of the subject. He has shown truth to be a thing of this world --produced, sustained and managed by strategies of power, as Foucault will add-- the relativity of civilizations and the elusive nature of personal identity, the capacity of the written word to embody being, plenitude, and presence. In Montaigne's self-reflexive and encyclopedic Essays I find myself before a distant yet pertinent textual expression that allows me to gain understanding of my own critical activity and to situate myself theoretically. Few authors of the beginning of the baroque area speak to us as directly and immediately as Montaigne does. I consider Montaigne a contemporary fellow whose name engraved on Burrowes Building east frieze is a constant reminder that, indeed, I've got a friend in Pennsylvania.\n\nThere are a number of books on economics that can teach the reader the subject matter of economics--however, this is one of those rare books that can teach the reader how to think like an economist. I used this book in my first graduate-level course in economics and found that it really made me think. Why? Because, as the author states in the introduction, if we can effectively teach physics, mathematics, chemistry and other subjects to our students by assigning them a number of problems with varied levels of difficulty, why not economics? There is a great supply of interesting problems throughout the textbook that get the reader to grapple with the economic issues.\n\nThe first result of having to use this textbook was that I spent a good deal of time and effort on these problems--the credit for the foundation of whatever little I know about economics goes to this textbook. The second result is that it has had a huge impact on how I teach my classes, selecting those textbooks that have a plentiful supply of problems and emphasizing the role of problem solving in learning how to think like a financial economist.\n\nDavid Wang's long-awaited study redefines the parameters of modern Chinese literature. Focusing on the epic mid-century transitions, Wang's monumental ouevre situates twentieth-century Chinese literature in deep historical time by excavating the \"lyrical tradition\" of Chinese writing. Faced with historical changes on a monumental scale, Chinese writers and artists sustained their creative impetus by drawing on and reinventing the lyrical foundations that had supported Chinese literature through the ages. Synthesizing a vast amount of scholarship in both English and Chinese, and all the while re-reading canonical texts and drawing attention to hitherto overlooked figures, Wang's book proposes a scholarly agenda that will occupy the field for many years. I look to The Lyrical in Epic Time as a model of scholarship, and I have drawn inspiration from it for my own work, in which I juxtapose Wang's \"lyrical tradition\" with the \"cosmopolitan tradition\" of modern Chinese literature. Working on a similar period, but from a very different methodological and conceptual angle, I find many productive points of conversation with Wang's line of thought. I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed the slow genesis of The Lyrical in Epic Time; not being a student of Wang's myself, I have nonetheless—like nearly anyone in the field today—benefited from the intellectual generosity of Prof. Wang.\n\nKuttruff's book (4th edition, 2000) was the first title I owned on room acoustics theory. This book was the required textbook for my first architectural acoustics course in graduate school, which was taught by my advisor Lily Wang (’99 PhD). The textbook cost nearly $200, which was a tremendous investment for a first-year graduate student and I admit that I was skeptical if the book was actually worth it, especially since it is relatively short! However, this book has proven to be an invaluable reference over the years for its concise, yet thorough explanations of the theory behind sound propagation in rooms. I had the privilege to meet Prof. Kuttruff in 2008 in Aachen, Germany, who was still coming into his office periodically at RWTH Aachen University as an emeritus professor. It was a true honor to meet such a distinguished researcher in the field and he agreed to sign my copy of his book! I am grateful to my mentor, Lily Wang, for all of her guidance during my graduate studies on the topic of concert hall acoustics and for her continued support post-graduation.\n\nThe clear presentation of data is paramount for the engineer (and in many, many other fields, of course), who must often communicate complex information to a wide audience in limited space or time. This book is the first of a excellent series from the author, each of which beautifully deals with how to accurately, succinctly, yet creatively, communicate data of various sorts. If the reader will use some of the techniques suggested, and more often try to think of interesting but efficient ways to show data, the number of dry, illegible or ponderous tables and graphs, especially in electronic presentations, could be reduced, to the great relief of those in the audience. In addition, digesting the principles of \"graphical integrity\" which this book describes will also make the reader a more critical consumer of the tables and graphs of others, many of which mislead.\n\nMy hope is that this book both inspires my fellow engineers to rise above the data they're representing and free the artist within, and enlightens them to recognize when others have not met their responsibility for clarity in graphical communications.\n\nAlthough not even remotely related to computer science, Guns, Germs, and Steel has been an absolute favorite of mine since the first time I read it. It is — at its core — an exercise in presenting and evaluating models to explain a highly intriguing aspect of human history: why did certain societies (those in Europe and Asia) thrive, while others (Americas, Australia, and sub-Saharan Africa) did not? According to Professor Jared Diamond, this had to do with geography and timing more than the superiority of one race over another. For someone who must understand complicated computer systems and employ creative techniques to model their behavior in both his research and teaching, this book is highly inspirational. Good models balance simplicity and accuracy. Furthermore, they do not hesitate to cast away old ideas and approaches that do not work. Diamond's models do all of this. To top it all off, Diamond's writing makes this work on anthropology approachable even to non-experts.\n\nWhen I first began to explore the dynamics of stories and storytelling in organization settings, most of the literature treated stories as tools conscripted by us into service. The primary discourse around narrative analysis at that time — still popular today — was that it was perfectly okay to dismember and reconstitute stories of others into some composite narrative a la Frankenstein's monster — a sort of undead conglomeration that in its effort to be everyone's story was actually, in the end, no one's. David Boje stood apart from this field of voices with his proposition of living stories, distinct from narrative. If the stories were living, he contended, then traditional approaches to narrative analysis were not an appropriate way to work with them.\n\nHis position echoed my own intuition that stories deserved more care, and could only really be understood as highly contextualized whole cloth. As an emerging scholar, David, his work, and this seminal book in particular, blazed a trail for me. This and David's subsequent works continue to reflexively challenge my ideas and substantiate my instincts to forge ahead in the weird, wide, wonderful world of stories, narrative, telling, and listening between and among humans. The work of David Boje makes me smarter every time I read it. It never wears thin even, as in this case, a decade after its release. There is always something more to notice and that, to me, is a hallmark of scholarly excellence.\n\nJames Carey was a scholar who recognized the significance of culture as part of the communication process. He devoted his life to better understanding how culture and communication were intertwined. Communication As Culture made a profound impact on the field of cultural studies, and Professor Carey, through his generous sharing of his time, inspired numerous individuals to connect culture and communication in their scholarship in ways that did not occur in previous eras. I was fortunate to call Jim a friend. I collaborated with him to edit his work after he gave an address at Penn State for a national-level graduate conference that was organized by the College of Communications in 1999. He served as the keynote speaker for that event and was outstanding. He was a wonderful person, a skilled researcher, and very much a gentleman. When I would attend conferences, we would share a beer, talk about the field, and he would encourage my research well before I was known by anyone. The Cultural and Critical Studies division within the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (AEJMC) has chosen to dedicate the top student paper award to the memory of James Carey. It was a move that I was proud to support after his passing in 2006, and I am now fortunate to head up that division. If anyone wants to truly understand the link between communication and culture, the book I have chosen is an essential text.\n\nI was born and raised on the Dominican side of Hispaniola within 10 kilometers of the Haitian border. As a child, I observed the disparity between Dominicans and our Haitian neighbors, but I was ignorant of its causes and unaware of its pernicious effects on Haitians and Dominicans alike. With her rigorous research and engaging style, Michelle Wucker has offered me novel vistas on the uneasy alliance between the nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In this book, she has encapsulated the profoundly disturbing histories of these two nations and provided me with a framework in which to understand much of my own personal history. This book, then, bears directly on my past and on my current professional development as well. It has inspired a new direction in my research in linguistics, which strives to further the understanding of the situation of Haitians and Dominicans in national and diasporic settings through the lens of sociolinguistics and the sociology of language. Wucker's book has led me to reevaluate my belief system and I recommend it constantly to my family and friends in the hope that it will lead them to reevaluate theirs.\n\nThis book reveals the incredible diversity and power of parasites, which to most peoples’ surprise, dominate most ecosystems, though they usually go unseen. Over evolutionary time, parasites have infiltrated most living species; in fact, as this book reveals, they are thought to outnumber non-parasitic species. Many parasites species have developed complex life histories to access their hosts, and evolved impressive manipulations to maximize their own fitness at the expense of their host. When viewed through the lens of fitness advantages and natural selection, the evolution of many of their strategies and specific tactics are quite remarkable; dome of the examples in this well-written book are hard to believe, and will make you want to share their details with someone! Many parasites are, of course, medically relevant and their ability to adapt and overcome treatments makes them very challenging to manage. Others, however, are worth studying from a very basic perspective, to understand how they evolved and why they are so successful. Still others are valuable as applied research subjects because if we can harness their ability to influence their hosts, perhaps we can use them as allies to help control pests, like insects that attack crop plants. This book reminded me why I became interested in parasites in graduate school and continue to keep these fascinating organisms part of my research program.\n\nRadio frequency (RF) and microwave technology is a key component of modern communication systems such as high speed internet and cell phones, and many books have been written by various experts about this technology from a purely engineering point of view. This book, on the other hand, provides a background on how RF/microwave radiation interacts with human body, and how the use of this technology has contributed to the development of therapeutic applications in areas such as cardiology, urology, surgery, and oncology.\n\nI have selected this book because of its special meaning to me. One day in early 2003, when I was a post-doc at Drexel, Arye Rosen approached me. He spoke with me about this book that he was co-authoring and if I could design some problems for it. I didn't hesitate to accept, since I respected him a lot, and it would add at least one more line to my CV anyway. That moment was the start of a mentorship and collegial friendship that has lasted up to this day. During the course of this relationship, I have learned some of the most valuable lessons of my life, and I have always felt fortunate to benefit from an excellent mentor and a great human being.\n\nOther Ways to Win is a timeless book which highlights the need for students to regain control of their futures. Success can certainly be achieved in many different ways. The premise of this book resonates with me both personally and professionally. A special thank you to Dr. Ken Gray and Dr. Ed Herr for promoting this important message.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey of earning tenure and being promoted to associate professor, I’m grateful to my family, friends and loved ones for being there for me. This was a collective effort. A special thank you to my wife Annette for her love, encouragement and support throughout this process. I am the luckiest guy to have such a special lady by my side. I would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Richard Walter for serving as a mentor and for the valuable lessons he has taught me over the years.\n\nWhen this book first came out in 1989 I was in college and studying abroad in Seville, Spain. I was studying languages—Spanish and Arabic, and history—medieval and art, at the Universidad de Sevilla. I was reading hundreds of pages in Spanish each week and in my exhaustion, sought out an English-language guilty-pleasure read. I bought a copy of this book at a local English-language bookstore and was instantly transfixed. I read the entire book to the detriment of sleep, study and social interaction.\n\nThe book is a long metaphor for the beginnings of the enlightenment and hope for mankind. As the main characters build a new style of cathedral, in which the space is open, filled with light and built on new scientific insights, so is the medieval society in which the story takes place. The book is a story of the triumph of science, reason, ingenuity and perseverance over dogma, fundamentalism and fanaticism. Throughout the book, the main characters find new ways to do, create, and build something that breaks with tradition, yet yields a better practice or product. These same main characters are confronted by evil in the form of religious fanaticism and dogma, traditional blind adherence, greed, and jealousy, and yet persevere in their efforts to build something better. These characters also struggle against the hierarchical structure of medieval society, suffering under the unjust nature of the feudal system and attempting to work around and bend these strictures.\n\nTwenty-one years later, I believe that this book has affected my choice of career. I am now a public informatician, an academic with expertise in social research methods and social theory and I apply these tools to the study of information and communication technologies (ICT) and their context of development, implementation, and use. Technologies are created, adopted, and used by groups, organizations, institutions, and societies in patterned behavior, which has implications for both the institution and the technology.\n\nThese technologies are mediated via stratified groups and often are imbued with power beyond their function. I often see the world in stratified layers and classes, as oppositional and conflicted, and I am comfortable with the role of academic-activist and public agent. My scholarship of public informatics is focused on problems faced by public and non-profit institutions and their work toward a public good. The problems that concern me are those endemic to the public sphere, the lack of and management of scarce resources, sharing materials and information, and increasingly, the need to play competitively alongside private industry.\n\nRarely do lectures intended for freshmen and sophomore students have the appeal to transcend their role as course text books and become the de-facto reference books for an entire lifetime. Ever since I first read them in my late teens, I have been captivated by the style, content, and presentation of Feynman Lectures on Physics. Like many things in life these books seem to have a new meaning each time I have looked back at these. From being the source of everlasting inspiration to pursue science and engineering to using them for teaching physics concepts and analytical thinking, some of these lectures remain deeply etched into my mosaic of learning. In Feynman Lectures on Physics, the simple lucidity and the raw thrill of Physics is told with passion and contagiousness. One can only imagine the thrill of being in the classroom at Caltech in 1962 as a freshman. With great pleasure, I acknowledge the inspiration these books have been to me and this opportunity to share it.\n\nMy selection of Craig Wright's The Maze and the Warrior was motivated by two primary factors, both of which had a strong and direct influence on the early development of my career. First of all, as my Yale University doctoral dissertation advisor, Craig Wright served as an effective mentor, guiding me at all stages of my evolution from a graduate student to a young faculty member. Secondly, The Maze and the Warrior is an example of what I consider to be some of the most exciting recent scholarship. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the book examines the spiritual and symbolic meanings of the labyrinth. Specifically, it traces the theological implications of the maze and investigates their significance in architecture, music, dance, and the visual arts. Although written by a musicologist, The Maze and the Warrior is an exciting example of the type of work that goes well beyond strict disciplinary boundaries.\n\nAs a firm believer in the importance of student mentorship and in the value of interdisciplinary studies, The Maze and the Warrior was an obvious choice when asked to select a book that has had some special meaning. It serves as a reminder of how the excellent example set by a mentor - both as a scholar and as a dedicated teacher - can have a powerful and lasting influence.\n\nThis is one of the first comprehensive books to illustrate the complex public health issue of obesity during the transition to motherhood. I co-wrote the chapter \"Obesity and Physical Activity During Pregnancy and Postpartum: Evidence, Guidelines, and Recommendations\" with my colleague and friends, Drs. Kelly Evenson and Lisa Chasan-Taber, both amazing women working hard to combat the obesity epidemic in women. This book has such important professional and personal meaning to me. I wrote the chapter during a period of time when I had just received my first NIH R01 grant on managing gestational weight gain in obese pregnant women, took on an administrative role as professor in charge of the undergraduate program in the department of Kinesiology, was grieving the death of my father who had just passed away from prostate cancer, and I was caring for our newborn baby (our third child). This book will forever remind me of strength, patience, and persistence. My promotion to full professor would not have been possible without the love and support of my husband, Jon, and our three children, Michael, Brodan, and Ellorie, strength of my soul sister, Amy Frank, and the inspiration of my mentors, Drs. Nancy Williams, Linda Collins, Leann Birch, and Barbara Rolls.\n\nTommy's Honour gives the reader an insight into the early days of golf, demonstrates how sport has acted as a catalyst in the breakdown of social barriers, and puts a face on the lives and times of two of the founding giants of the game.\n\nThis novel is built around the modern history of golf in Scotland, and the relationship between two of golf's most talented founding professionals, \"Old Tom\" and \"Young Tom\" Morris. The story, based on historical fact, takes us back to the mid-1800s and vividly describes the lives and times of a father and son who through their accomplishments became two of golf's most storied and honored figures.\n\nThe book also illustrates the pervasive social-class structure between the landed gentry who were the members of such golf clubs as the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews, and golf professional/greens-keepers who could only be workers and never members despite their level of accomplishment as players. This social dynamic is played out through the relationship of \"Old Tom\" and \"Young Tom,\" as \"Old Tom\" always knew his place and \"Young Tom\" rebelled against the status quo. Over time however, as \"gentlemen\" (amateurs) and \"players\" (professionals) competed with one another, the game helped to narrow the gap between the social classes as the ethos of \"we are all equal on the playing field and in the grave\" helped to break down social barriers, at least in the sporting world. Through competition with the \"gentlemen,\" \"players\" were able to demonstrate that they could adhere to the rules, and also exhibit one of the true characteristics of a gentlemen, fair play.\n\nAccording to legend, Zeus gave rhetoric to the people (demos) so they could settle their differences with words rather than by physical force. At one point, Hermes asked Zeus, “How should I distribute the gift?” Zeus thought for a moment. “Give rhetoric to everyone,” he said, “and distribute its power equally.” It took The Handmaiden’s Tale for me to grasp the form and dimensions of what I had been given. Atwood reveals what happens not only to women who are put under a certain sort of pressure that denies them their voices, but also to the human spirit itself that counts speech as its greatest achievement. Because under stress, the idea of fearless speech as well as the consciousness that rhetoric demands of its practitioners is threatened. I imagine receiving rhetoric as working at the edge of thought where the art can be continually developed, guaranteeing that as the sociopolitical realm changes so too rhetoric can embody its spirit of equality as starkly and as summarily as the gods had presented it to the people. The Handmaiden’s Tale was my rhetorical-democratic-feminist epiphany.\n\nExplicating the meaning of a concept lies at the core of all scientific endeavors. This book tells us how to do that with precision and certainty. This book had a profound influence on me ever since my graduate school days. It transformed me from a journalist to a scientist and from a writer to a thinker. Today, I use this in my research methods class as the primary reference for an assignment asking students to explicate a concept for the purpose of operationalizing an abstract idea so that we can study it empirically. They tell me that this book has not only taught them how to define terms for use in research, but, has also come in handy in other contexts (such as arguing a case in court based on explication of certain terms used in legal doctrines and contracts). Ultimately, this book is about a way of thinking with disciplined clarity and building a sound scientific mind in the process.\n\nI chose this book for two reasons: its accomplishments in tackling and explaining the power that corporations can have over the poor in developing countries, and the inspiring way that it captures much of what has motivated my own research.\n\nI started my career at the World Bank, thrilled to be involved in projects that directly impact the world’s poor. I was working on a Ph.D. in agricultural economics for largely U.S. reasons – our own small farmers have a hard time competing in the U.S. market – but ended up shifting my research toward developing country agriculture. In particular, I grew to understand the agribusiness component of agriculture – mostly the post-harvest activities that involve money and product transformation – and saw how much was controlled by large corporations.\n\nNowadays, my research is more about alternative approaches to farming (organic, GMO-free, locally grown) as well as farmer tactics to seem “big” (e.g. via cooperatives) to the outside marketplace. The current market system rewards many of the wrong decisions too easily, making some of these alternatives particularly challenging. Large-scale corporations play a role in that, and John Madeley’s book really underscores how they have impacted the lives of millions around the world.\n\nI read the original 1999 version, and am intrigued to get the 2009 edition to see what new information has been added.\n\n“She was heaven whilst he pursued her as a star: she cannot be heaven, if she stoops to such a one as he.” Ralph Waldo Emerson – from his essay Nature - 1844\n\nThis is a book written by my academic grandfather. My Ph.D. adviser, Dr. David Kronfeld, received his Ph.D. working with Dr. Max Kleiber at the University of California, Davis. Over my years of studying I've found few if any books that captured the emotion, passion and history that are a part of all scientific endeavors. While this book is one of my favorite on the topic of animal energetics, Emerson’s quote above is why I love science and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nThe topic of animal energetics is also an important part of the history of the study of animal nutrition here at Penn State. If you’ve picked up this book, you should also visit the Armsby Calorimeter Museum here on campus, a facility that was designed solely for the purpose of studying aspects of animal nutrition and energetics for over 60 years, and serves as a monument to that work today.\n\nAll academics are in essence “people of books.” This particular text describes several centuries of wars, including the most recent resulting in my emigration from the former Yugoslavia to the United States, and Penn State, where I have resided for the past decade. This book resonated with the sadness I experienced during the tragedy of this conflict. Furthermore, this text put me in touch with my humanity, and enabled a cathartic process, which was compressed through the years of my vigorous academic endeavors. This particular book presents a perspective of Serbian people, which was incongruent with my experiences as well as the general zeitgeist of the Serbian populous. This dissonance was both painful and instructive as it forced me to acknowledge the necessity for Serbians to take responsibility for what some of our fellow countrymen have done. I personally feel sorry for all people of former Yugoslavia, who attacked each other in a meaningless civil war. More importantly, this book is a reminder that as long as we are in touch with our humanity, all wars are meaningless and our cultural heritage should be protected regardless of our political or religious orientation. Similarly, academics often engage in meaningless conflicts, wrought with vain and animus. We are often disrespectful to each other under the false pretense of academic rigor. Conflict of any nature distorts the human soul. We should all endeavor to preserve the highest aspect of own humanity and in that spirit on we can engage each other in a more productive pursuit of knowledge.\n\nLastly, this book is a fond reminder of my dear colleague, Dr. Michael Horman, who prematurely died at the age of thirty-eight in the classroom at Penn State. He was my age and we both started appointments here at Penn State on the same day. Our life stories have many parallels, as he also crossed the ocean to pursue his ambitions from Australia. He was a deeply honorable person, and embodied a model citizen greatly needed in our academic community. I think of him often as his memory is an anchor to my own humanity. I am certain that he would have earned his promotion on the same day as I did, if he had lived. Sadly, I am left to wonder what book my friend Mike would select on this occasion.\n\nThis book was written by friends and colleagues from my first job after I finished my master's degree. In particular, the lead author, Dr. Val Chobotov, was a very influential person on my career, and a good friend who is no longer with us. Some of my earliest papers were influenced by his work in orbital debris, and I even had the great opportunity to work directly for him for over five years. I will be forever grateful for the guidance Val gave me early in my career, his support in helping me go back to graduate school to get my Ph.D. and his support in helping me become a professor at Penn State. His mentorship continued until he passed away in 2010.\n\nThe rest of the authors also guided my early career, and they all have made significant contributions to the United States through their work on the U.S. military space program. Thanks to Hans for making me a better writer, George for teaching me about orbital perturbations, Jimmy for making me a better computer programmer, Tom for teaching me about Earth-orbit mission design, and Jean for getting me started researching low-thrust trajectory optimization (which later became the subject of my Ph.D. dissertation).\n\nKay Boyle (1902-1992) was one of the last survivors of the so-called Lost Generation of expatriate writers and artists who gathered in Paris in the 1920s. Being Geniuses Together 1920-1930 provides a valuable fresh view of that legendary literary era. Boyle narrates an expatriate experience far different from the more famous chroniclers of the period like Ernest Hemingway and Malcolm Cowley--and different, too, from those of the better-known women of the Left Bank, like Sylvia Beach, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Boyle was a working single mother as well as a committed artist. Her friends included Black Sun Press publishers Harry and Caresse Crosby, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and poet and publisher Robert McAlmon, whose own enormous influence on the literary scene is largely forgotten. In this book, first published in 1968 and expanded in 1984, Boyle attempts to rectify that injustice by resurrecting McAlmon's 1938 memoirs, interleaving chapters of her own to carry on an unusual one-sided conversation with a departed friend.\n\nEarly on, Kay Boyle was considered, in the words of Katherine Anne Porter, one of the most \"portentous\" talents of her generation. Boyle went on to write more than forty books--novels, short stories, poetry, essays, translations, and memoirs. She won O. Henry Awards for Best Short Story of the Year in 1935 and 1941, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She also had three husbands and six children. Her career is a case study in the politics of literary reputation she is a classic example of an overlooked woman writer ripe for \"rediscovery.\"\n\nThis 1993 memoir of author Susanna Kaysen’s struggles with mental illness and the mental health system documents the complexities surrounding psychopathology and treatment. The book provides a raw account of what it was like for Ms. Kaysen to be a patient at a world-renowned psychiatric facility, McLean Hospital, in the late 1960’s. In so doing, it raises countless questions about the nature of mental illness, the boundaries of normalcy, the utility of hospitalization, and the effectiveness of drug treatments. And while I can reflect back on these lessons learned, what I remember most from the first time I picked up Girl, Interrupted is being fully captivated. In reading Ms. Kaysen’s account of her experience and those of her fellow patients, I was transported to another world I found both fascinating and daunting. It was that intrigue that prevented me from putting the book down and inspired me to pursue a career in clinical psychology. Two years later I found myself working as a research assistant in the very same halls of McLean Hospital, in awe that I had managed to transport myself within the pages of this powerful story. It was not coincidence that brought me there, but the love for a field of study sparked by Kaysen’s memoir. The passion for clinical psychology that this book ignited long ago continues to this day in my role as a licensed Clinical Psychologist and Associate Professor in Penn State’s Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program.\n\nJames MacGregor Burns' 1978 book entitled Leadership is considered the seminal work on transformational leadership. Leaders who practice this form of leadership transform their followers into self-leaders, and in doing so, become moral agents. Burns' work is very important because it provided the original idea that the truly outstanding leaders of history do much more than simply provide direction and consideration to followers. They inspire, challenge, coach, and serve as ethical role models for followers, in addition to providing direction and rewards for their success achievement of performance goals. Such behavior is needed today more than ever and shows that transformational leadership is truly timeless. Leadership provided the impetus for Bernard Bass and his colleagues from SUNY-Binghamton's Center for Leadership Studies to conduct their groundbreaking empirical work on transformational leadership. As a Ph.D. student of Bernard Bass and one who has always enjoyed history, I was very much inspired to continue the empirical examination of transformational leadership in my own research at Penn State after reading Leadership. The book is written in a scholarly, insightful, and detailed manner with its very interesting psycho-historical analyses of many of the great political leaders of the 20th century. May this book also inspire you to think great thoughts of motivating your associates to work together to bring out the best in people by displaying transformational leadership behavior.\n\nI read this book as a post-doc, engrossed in the daily juggle of managing a young family and a career. I had an amazing mentor at the time and her influence greatly guided my life's path. Now as a mentor myself, I've found that women often are best supported by seeing examples of how women succeed. This book provides those examples as National Academy women scientists open up honestly about the course of their careers and family/life balance. At an individual level, the focus is on how they approached key decisions and opportunities. As a set, the women highlight the importance of a partner (or social network) and a mentor or role-model who provided a key opportunity at the right time. But, perhaps most strikingly, none of the women had the same path. The idea that each women charted her own course through the complicated maze of academic life somehow makes it all more real and possible and encourages us not to conform or be intimidated by others' choices or timelines. This is freeing.\n\nThe other reason I chose this book is because I can never remember the title. I always confuse it with the saying my rowing coach had during my undergraduate years, which was \"Through the Door\" -- the idea that there is a certain point in life where if you push just a little harder you can see the other side. So, in some sense, the confusion in the title is perfect.\n\nI remember being drawn into this book from the premise: nonfiction author John McPhee took three adventures, including white water rafting, with two people who represented completely different perspectives about the environment. The stories in this book chronicle rich, passionate debates in the presence of the debates’ topics: the natural world itself. This book inspired me to think critically, to observe carefully, to question everything, to remain humble, and to stay fully engaged in practice. In addition, beyond simply chronicling the debate, McPhee takes readers along through the dramatic twists and turns as the three men together try to make it through their adventures, such as getting down the rapids in one piece. (It is fun to read!) Over the years I have found myself in different roles: as a vocal theorist, as the archivist of opinions, and as the instigator of risk-taking \"moments.\" At the end of the day, as a scholar, I hope to leave behind a few essays that engage readers, encouraging them to argue, consider, and challenge themselves and the points of view along the way—while always leaving them to wonder what will happen next.\n\nI was a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering when my father gave me this book in 1987. I assume he thought I'd find it interesting. I don't think he imagined it would change my life.\n\nThe early Media Laboratory was *the* place to be in the 1980s to see how computing could intersect with the arts, education, and all things humanistic. Stewart Brand documented the lab's technologies and the unique, interdisciplinary group of researchers that lived, worked, and played in the building. Both were equally fascinating, as they combined to form a sort of counterculture to established, academic computer science.\n\nIn fact, they were so fascinating that I read the book several times, then went to an administrative office at UCLA and switched my major to computer science and engineering. The remainder of my undergraduate career was dedicated to becoming a graduate student at the Media Lab. I applied in 1991 and was invited for an interview.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't make the final cut. However, I went on to pursue graduate studies at another startup lab, Northwestern's Institute for the Learning Sciences, another life changing move that prepared me for a second invitation to the Media Lab in 1997. The next five years as an assistant professor of media arts and sciences was perhaps the most influential period of my research career.\n\nThe lab has changed over time, and many of the technologies that appear in the book are now mainstream and/or outdated. But it is still relevant, as it tells the story of a young research team that defied tradition to develop new models for interdisciplinary research. It also inspired a generation of young students (myself included) to understand computation as a means to fundamentally improve human lifestyles. As a tenured faculty member, it is my responsibility to inspire a new generation of students to understand that the product of good research is better people. For me, this understanding started with the adventures of the Media Lab pioneers.\n\nDemo or die, invent and iterate, make the future of tomorrow...the night before it's due.\n\nBrown Girl, Brownstones was the first book I read that reflected my cultural duality. Growing up during a time when books by African American authors were published infrequently and typically related the “southern experience,” Paule Marshall provided a welcomed refuge from my search for identity. In the soft cadence of the voices of Bajan men and women, this author provided a fictional depiction of the struggle faced by many immigrants to embrace the host culture and retain one’s cultural identity. While reading this book I relived the smell of my grandmother’s cooking, the sight of sunlight filtering through the stained glass in the parlor, and the sound of that Barbadian lilt that was so familiar to my childhood. It would be many years before I would visit Barbados and come to understand the complexity of leaving home for unfamiliar but promising prospects in a different country. Yet it was through Paule Marshall that I first received context for understanding my past and learning to look forward to my future. Coming of age in the sixties as a second generation American woman with deep roots in the Caribbean, the discovery of Brown Girl, Brownstones was a rare and wonderful find.\n\nThis collection of essays dedicated to the Latin literature of Anglo-Saxon England opened my eyes to new vistas of texts and scholarship. The early English learned Latin as a foreign language in schools, and they took to it with an extraordinary vigor that generated an impressive and distinct body of Latin literature, much of it wonderfully strange and intensely learned. Michael Lapidge’s groundbreaking scholarship on Anglo-Latin texts has set the agenda for a generation of Anglo-Saxonists – indeed many of these essays have informed my own research interests and I am sure that they will continue to do so. I also love the style of Lapidge’s writing, how he lays out his evidence and surprises with his conclusions in a way that reminds me of classic detective fiction. The pieces sensibly click into place and something new comes into view. Michael Lapidge is an aglæca lareow for our own age, and this remarkable and rich book, with its plain little title, represents just a part of his growing legacy in Anglo-Saxon studies.\n\nThis book, published in 2010, the year of my tenure, involves two world renowned statisticians whose careers and approach to statistics have inspired mine. Frederic Mosteller was one of the most eminent statisticians of the 20th century. He encouraged and advocated collaborations and interdisciplinary projects, promoting statistics and probability for their use in everyday life and to the advancement of just about any other science. Stephen E. Fienberg, Mosteller's graduate student and my doctoral advisor, has kept that same spirit alive, and enhanced it by identifying new ways of connecting different discipline and scientists with statistics. The book features insider accounts of work on real-life studies that have shaped our society such as statistical aspects of the pre-election polls of 1948 and the famously inaccurate \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" headline, on evaluating sexual behavior in the U.S. and the Kinsey report, and many others. It offers insights on becoming \"a superb teacher, a prolific scholar, a respected leader, and a valued advisor.\"\n\nMosteller's clear and entertaining voice has been preserved, making this book accessible to a wide audience, and one that will convince readers that statistics is anything but boring.\n\nI cannot say that this book has motivated my statistical research. But it has reminded over the years that as academics we are not only scholars, but teachers, mentors and leaders. We use our past and present experiences to inspire new generations to search for and fulfill their potential, and foremost become good human beings. Jovan Du?i?, a renowned Serbian poet, writer, philosopher and a diplomat during the first half of the twentieth century, through his writings (and especially in “Blago Cara Radovana i Jutra sa Leutara” -- King Radovan’s Treasure and Leutar Mornings) has reminded me that we all search for something but will have different paths to finding the treasures we seek. And even when we do not agree with all that is written or said, it is important to carefully consider and offer respect for effort put forth. To many of you the writing in Cyrillic and the Serbian language will be foreign, so here is one translation that likely applies to us all:\n\n“What our minds build, our foolishness tears down; our goodness is overshadowed by our vices, and the fruits of our wisdom by the outbursts of our temperament. For, beyond and above all, our powers are ruled by our weakness.”\n\n“Što uspemo našom pame?u, pokvarimo našom ?udi, a što uspemo našom dobrotom, upropastimo našim porocima, i, najzad, što postignemo svojom mudroš?u, izgubimo našim temperamentom. Jer ima nešto ja?e i presudnije od svih naših sila, a to su naše slabosti.”\n\nVaneep has a beautiful way of weaving together a whole array of complex human emotions into a beautiful canvas on which she paints a gripping image of a young woman's journey through — and the ultimate conquest of — the world around her. This is the story of a young girl who moves out of her parent's loving and benevolent world and into one where her dreams and hopes fade away into a distant horizon. While it is a sad story of painful betrayals, it is also a story of the eventual triumph of the purity of soul. This indeed is a heart aching tale of searching for love in the wrong places and losing everything in the process, including having one's own identity completely shattered; it is also a story of rebuilding a new life through sheer determination and strength of character. Reading this story of a loving little daughter, a passionate lover, a dreamer, and an optimistic young aspiring woman, you wonder how life can be so harsh to someone. You look at life from a very different perspective. A perspective that makes you appreciate the very essence of human existence in its spiritual domain. You reassess your attitudes and deeds and feel like being more kind and giving.\n\nIt is one of the finest debut works. Vaneep has crafted the story so eloquently that readers will find themselves interlacing their real lives with lives of her story's characters even after they have finished reading the book. A marvelous piece of literature with a great message: \"You are the maker of your own destiny.\"\n\nAlthough many of the issues introduced by Wollstonecraft in this book are not at all controversial in today's society, this certainly was not the case in the late 18th century. Maria, or The Wrongs of Woman, was published posthumously in 1797 and was viewed as a brave critique of how women faired in a male-dominated society. She spoke of the injustices endured by women, but she also juxtaposed those injustices against a backdrop of inflictions placed upon women at the hands of themselves. Wollstonecraft's somewhat harsh call to action on both fronts resonated strongly with me when I first read her work. I had often thought about and encountered both covert and overt sexist attitudes on the part of males, but had not thought as deeply about the self-inflicted wounds that women sometimes impose on themselves, such as allowing one's self-worth to be determined by having a male companion and his approval. Wollstonecraft encouraged women of her generation to seek satisfaction in other relationships as well, such as with one’s children, female companions, and other family members. She also encouraged women to seek some manner of independence and not to get too caught up in emotional and sometimes crippling sentimentality. The author certainly left a mark on the women of her generation and on future generations; to this I can fully attest.\n\nWhen I read The Women's Room in 1978 I had settled down into the stereotypical \"at home\" wife and mother role. I say \"settled down,\" because the 1970s were years during which I was very much involved in self-destructive behavior often associated with that particular time in America's anti-establishment subculture. In 1978, I had married, was raising my son from an earlier teenage marriage that had ended in divorce shortly after his birth, and was pregnant with my second child. Daytime television was my main connection to the outside world because I had shut myself off from it out of fear that I would long to return to it. It was then that I saw Marilyn French interviewed by Phil Donahue, an extremely popular talk show host during that time period. What she said resonated with me at the time, and encouraged me to obtain a copy of the book. As I read the stories of French's female characters, my heart ached for women everywhere who were living out those very types of lives, and most of all, it broke into when I realized that I was one of those women. The book opened up for me a world of new ideas about the roles of women in society, and for the first time, I realized that there truly was a well-oiled machine in place to keep women from advancing beyond the patriarchal-established roles for them. The book also ignited in me a desire, long extinguished by a belief that it was simply impossible to even think about, to obtain a college degree. At the age of 35, and seven years after reading The Women's Room, I, like Mira (the main character in the book), became a non-traditional college student, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWhat should people be permitted to know about their own genomes and the genomes of their future children? What choices should they be empowered to make based on this knowledge? Sadly, the answer many ethicists and fellow researchers give is “whatever a committee of experts decides.” As a father and as a scientist, I have always believed that we can come up with a better answer.\n\nIn 2007, I finally found clues to a better answer when I read the virtually unknown sleeper called Enhancing Evolution: The Ethical Case for Making Better People. Author John Harris rejects the prevailing dogma of genetic exceptionalism, standing out among his fellow bioethicists in his consideration of genetic technologies as extensions of other methods for ensuring one’s own health and the health of one’s children. Harris argues that individuals, not panels of academics, should be trusted and empowered to make their own reproductive decisions, using technologies such as gene therapy, IVF, and embryo selection. In an ethics dialogue that has, for decades, been focused on limiting personal autonomy, policing research, prohibiting technological developments, and restricting available interventions, Harris’s call for freedom is unique. But equally important is his call for responsibility. Non-scientists, Harris argues, should support and participate in the very research that continues to improve human life and reduce suffering. If you’re not at the table; don’t be surprised when no one offers you a meal, to coin a phrase.\n\nAs future biomedical science emerges from yesterday’s scientific speculations, giving rise to an expansive postgenomic present, my hope is that more scientists and non-scientists will come to the table, as Harris urges. And, once they sit down, I hope that they begin by asking themselves, is “what should people be permitted to do?” even the right question? Do individuals not have ultimate ownership of their own reproductive systems? And must we assume our fellows’ reasons for genetic intervention are, by definition, nefarious? If four billion years of evolution have taught us anything, it is that “making better people” is an instinct that is programmed into all of us, whether we realize it or not. This instinct is not only a relic of our past; it is also the promise of our future.\n\nOne author who has substantially affected me was not formally a scientist, a historian, or a philosopher, but a science fiction writer (and in actuality all of the above): Philip K. Dick. A fan of science fiction since grade school, I first encountered Dick in college when the burly owner of a used book store near my university in Stony Brook, New York gave me a copy of Ubik. True to the story, I suddenly began seeing Dick books everywhere and was compelled to read as many as I could, finding important messages within each. For me this has been an ongoing process as Dick was quite prolific, writing 36 novels and more than 100 short stories. As such, it's hard to recommend a single book, and so I have chosen to recommend Counterfeit Unrealities, a compilation of four of Dick's best novels: The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik, and A Scanner Darkly. Dick's characters often have transformative experiences that cause them to reevaluate their self conceptions and other aspects of their most basic understandings of the universe. Such moments are central to the creative process, which is essential to science, art, and even simply developing as a person. Generally, we have some starting perspective (maybe even a very solid and definite view) on whatever issue we are considering, but at the same time, we should not believe our view with too much confidence or at least remember that it can and should change. Science is not just facts and formulae, but just as much a way of thinking (natural and inherent our species) about what might be. The 'scientific method' is simply a formalization of our innate ability to speculate and experiment. Speculating requires that we learn to access the irrational, appreciate the paradox, grok the koan, and ride the mobius strip. Immerse yourself in these stories and follow the master speculator and his troop of empathetic humans, androids, and animated household appliances off into the near future on a search for who we are and from where we've come.\n\nMy first six years at Penn State have given me the gift of working with many outstanding students, faculty, and staff from diverse social and economic backgrounds. Public universities like Penn State are the foundation of our future, because they provide the educational resources youth need to be competitive in adulthood and because they are so successful at bringing together people from diverse backgrounds. Unfortunately, it is also true that these past few years have been marked by the most difficult economic period our nation has faced since the Great Depression. Perhaps for this reason, my time at Penn State has also seen a decrease in federal funding for scientific research and a seeming reduction in public regard for higher education in general. In the face of difficulty, it feels like many of our local and national communities have drifted apart, rather than coming together. Fortunately, we at Penn State are blessed to be part of an extraordinarily strong civic community. In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck reminds us of the need to display compassion for all people, regardless of their social or economic situation. I believe that Steinbeck provides us with a path towards prosperity and affirmation for all people. His message is as resonant today as it was at the time of this important novel's writing.\n\nMy arrival at Penn State never felt predestined, nor have the trials and success of so many colleagues and peers I have met over the years. Very often I have felt like luck and an awareness of when it shows up have the most to say about our path through the world. The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., is widely regarded as a life lesson taught to us through the flawed example of Malachi Constant. Since my first reading of this book in graduate school, I have felt it was more the story of Chrono, the boy from Mars with the lucky strip of metal. Chrono attributes his great successes in life to the luck given him by rubbing his thumb against this special strip, but of course we learn through the unfolding of the story that luck really had nothing at all to do with his journey. I am lucky that I had a hard time finding an undergraduate research laboratory, which led me unexpectedly to my first mentor, Dr. Linda Nicholson. I am lucky that she introduced me to her friend, and my future Ph.D. adviser, Dr. Kathleen Hall. Both of these generous people helped form my life, like Chrono formed the lucky piece of metal. During all of my time at Penn State, I have felt lucky that our great Department of Chemistry was hiring in exactly my discipline on exactly the right year. Maybe it was never luck after all; as Vonnegut would say, “so it goes.” I am deeply grateful to everyone here with whom I have had the pleasure of working, most notably the many wonderful students over the years. This is an exceptional institution and I am lucky to be here.\n\nI’ll confess that it’s been thirty years since my last reading of Terry Southern’s Candy. I’ll admit that I was fourteen years old at the time. I’ll confess, too, that I only read it once even then, although I feel certain that many key passages were reread several times. I’ll confess, lastly, that I’ll probably never read Candy again. Why, then, is Candy a pornographic parody my selection as a book with “some special meaning” to commemorate this auspicious moment, this hurdle, this attainment of tenure at Penn State University? I’ll tell you. When the new kid, a redheaded boy named Robin, slipped me the already dog-eared book under his desk, in the third row of Mrs. Atwater’s homeroom, just before science class, and I flipped to a random page, opened it slyly on my lap, read, blinked, then read again, “Give me the hump! Give me the hump!” it was my first moment of full-on, unchecked awareness of the power of words, of language, of stories. I took the book home, hidden of course, and read it with a fervor and a delicious desperation that I will never ever forget. When I finished the book, I knew that somehow, someday, I wanted to do this stuff with words. And here I am, Associate Professor Steve, with one novel out in nine languages, another nominated for the Pulitzer by the publisher, and (hopefully!) more to come. Thanks, Terry.\n\nKant's Critique of Pure Reason did not inspire me to become a philosopher, but studying it marked an important moment in my training as one. One of the requirements for the philosophy major at my college was a notoriously grueling, year-long course on Kant. I recall writing a paper for this course in my junior year that felt unlike any other I had written. Usually, I treated papers as opportunities to weigh in on whatever I happened to be studying—to announce my own views about life, truth, and the limits of knowledge. But my paper on Kant read more like a technical exercise. I did not personally accept epistemological skepticism, but I pointed out how one of his replies to Hume's skepticism seemed to rely on a circular argument.\n\nAs I wrote it, I felt distanced from its subject, but I also felt as if something bigger than me was writing it—as if it were not so much me writing down my ideas it as the ideas writing themselves, with me simply recording how one claim did or did not follow from another. My professor made a point on returning my paper to announce to the class that for the first time in his career he had decided to award a paper an A+. This announcement encouraged to me to go on to graduate school. More importantly, it confirmed my suspicion that I had learned something important about philosophy—that it is less about defending one's personal beliefs and more about learning how to let ideas write themselves.\n\nI have since reread Kant's Critique many times. My copy has become a visual record of my life over the past fifteen years. Its margins are riddled with notes and diagrams, most of which no longer make sense to me. Entire paragraphs are colored in a now-faded yellow from the first time I read it and highlighted all that I saw. Other passages have been colored red, then blue, and then green on subsequent re-readings. There is something poetic, I find, about the fact that the most difficult passages, those that to confuse me to this day, are now almost illegible because I have highlighted and underlined them so many times.\n\nWe live in an age of digital imagery and computer generated graphics. Any quick perusal of current medical literature confirms that the \"art\" of medical illustration has given way to the stark, overly simplified, cookie-cutter renditions of the digital age. Individualism is lost, usually along with detail, and oftentimes along with accuracy. One wonders if true artistic talent, on par with that displayed by Frank Netter on the pages of this atlas, will ever again be applied with such vigor to the biological sciences.\n\nThe paintings reproduced in this text are timeless classics. Rigorous in accuracy and detail while at the same time beautiful and easy on the eye, each plate is a masterpiece. Many of the works contained herein hold special personal meaning, they resonate in my mind when considering some particular anatomic detail and they are impulsively re-examined when confirmation of some particular structure-function relationship is required. Through his works, Dr. has Netter played a key role in my education and in my professional pursuits and he continues to inspire. If you are viewing these paintings for the first time you are in for an uncommon treat. Take some time and browse for a while, for nowhere is the beauty of the human organism more painstakingly reproduced and more beautifully illustrated. Enjoy.\n\nFirst of all, it is very difficult to recommend a book for Penn State Libraries, for they seem to have just about every book one thinks would be of some value to society.\n\nI got lucky on this book since the Libraries do not seem to have this. I grew up in Madras, South India, so this book by Ambujam Anantharaman is dear to my heart. The book offers a very unique insight—an integrated view of South India's majestic temples from not just an architectural perspective; but with historical, devotional, societal and spiritual facets as well. The author is highly regarded and eminently qualified to write this book. She grew up in Mylapore which is one of the cultural epicenters of South India. The book is written with such integrity of thought that it represents all that is holistic in the practice of craft. I am an engineer and have always wondered at what lay inside a craftsman. This book laid out one perspective for me. There was much to learn for me in terms of the practice of my craft. While I can relate to it because of my background, I trust other readers will find the book thought provoking; and take upon the book as an open invitation to visit South India.\n\nThe adventures of Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger were wonderful stories for me as a child. They remain especially meaningful to me while working in academia. Mole is a gentle fellow, Toad is an ostentatious braggart, and Badger is the reclusive stalwart. But, it is Rat that appeals to me most in adulthood as a researcher:\n\nAs Mole explains, Rat has the sharp sense of reasoning needed for research:\n\n“You argued it out, step by step, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment I fell and cut my shin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself, ‘Door-scraper!’ And then you turned to and found the very door-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. ‘Let me only just find a door-mat,’ says you to yourself, ‘and my theory is proved!’ And of course you found your door-mat. You’re so clever, I believe you could find anything you liked. ‘Now,’ says you, ‘that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There’s nothing else remains to be done but find it!’ Well I’ve read about that sort of thing in books, but I’ve never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where you’ll be properly appreciated…”\n\nAnd Rat’s discourse on boats provides the best explanation I’ve read of life in academia:\n\n“Nothing seems really to matter, that’s the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether you don’t; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you’re always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you’ve done it there’s always something else to do…”\n\nI realize that Penn State has copies of this book - but I would like to make a special case for having copy of this book (two volumes) in the stacks at the Architecture and Landscape Architecture Library.\n\nMy work focuses on machines - specifically the Machine in an architectural context - and finding this book as an undergrad in a used bookstore in Providence, Rhode Island, absolutely set the course for my studies and my research. While there are many references to machines in books of architecture, and many architectural works claim relation to machines and mechanization, the Appleton's books offer the reader an unparalleled look at a world already 'totally mechanized' at the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851. What I think is amazing about the book - beyond its encyclopedic scope/thoroughness - is the invention on display. You can find all of the machines/methods of architectural production, like cranes and sawmills, but one can also find machines related to the making of wallpapers - or see plan, section, elevation of recently mechanized brick kilns. For any student of architecture interested in the long and wondrous relations between Architecture and machinery, this is an essential book.\n\nWhile many may be surprised at this choice coming from an engineer, the book that inspired me in a number of profound ways is the [Gulag Archipelago (Volumes I and II)], by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. First and foremost, the book is a stark and chilling reminder of man's continued inhumanity to man and the need for constant vigilance against any government form that believes it has the right to be the ultimate decider as judge, jury, and executioner. However, the [Gulag Archipelago] also serves to remind us how one person can struggle against such an unjust system and ultimately prevail. From an engineering perspective, the book also provides a stark example of how anyone (even an engineer) can play an important role in maintaining such a system. This reminder comes in a passage that describes Solzhenitsyn’s arrest and being restrained with handcuffs that were designed to painfully cut into the wrist with the slightest movement. Solzhenitsyn asked a question that still haunts me today, in wondering if the designer truly believed that the handcuffs would only be used against bad people who presumably deserved the pain they inflicted. Hence, while engineers may not be able to always foresee all of the possible usages of our work, we should always be cognizant of the potential misuse!\n\nMany years ago I heard David McCullough reminisce about his cherished library card from the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, and I share those same valued memories. Every Saturday morning I would visit the main library near the University of Pittsburgh by bus, and after returning the books taken out from a previous visit, I would take out the maximum number of books allowed. That tattered and worn out library card represented my passage to other times, other continents, and other people's lives. In retrospect, it was not what I read that was important, but the mere fact that reading became and continues to be an important part of my life. I chose Mornings on Horseback, though I could have selected any one of David McCullough's books, as it was my introduction to Theodore Roosevelt and the Victorian age, topics that have remained an ongoing area of interest for me. I dedicate my promotion to professor in orthopaedics and rehabilitation to my mother, who always took pride in my achievements; to my father, who has given me his unwavering support and encouragement; and to my wife and my children, not only for their support, but for their understanding of the demands placed upon and dedication required of those in the medical profession.\n\nCure for sentimentality and antitoxin to the imaginatively impoverished expectation that good books affirm the positive identifications of their readers, Sabbath’s Theater is about what makes life and literature irresistible: rage, sex, desire, hate, excess, love, mischief, joy, resentment, ecstasy, abjection, death. Philip Roth has long been one of our great writers of anger, but Sabbath’s Theater is a masterpiece, a tour de force journey across the dirty knife’s edge where knowledge and morality fall away into each other and make each other impossible and inescapable, where life exposes itself as at its core nothing more nor less profound than rage against what it isn’t. Touring the gravestones in a decaying cemetery where he hopes to intern himself, alone and soon, the novel’s titular character realizes that “Nobody beloved gets out alive.” Failed Whitman and Moses manqué, Mickey Sabbath is a haunting, elegiac, agnostic apostrophe to the burning, unconquerable force of life, catastrophically so in the book’s final line: “And he couldn’t do it. He could not fucking die. How could he leave? How could he go? Everything he hated was here.”\n\nBarth's introduction to this little, edited volume (1969) was a game-changer in anthropology because he examined ethnic groups from the viewpoint of \"the boundary that defines the group, not the cultural stuff that it encloses.\" At the time (and often today) cultures were seen as collections of traits, invariant over time, cohering fully in each member of the culture. Years later, after extensive research on intracultural variation and an emphasis on sociocultural processes instead of timeless cultures, Barth seems to have won the day. But for me this volume is more important as an example of how anthropologists think. After Barth's introductory essay in which he lays out his theoretical approach to ethnicity, there follow seven ethnographic essays that probe how ethnic identities were constructed and maintained in various poly-ethnic societies (Coastal Lappish in Northern Norway, the Fur and Bagarra in Sudan, mountaineers and lowlanders in Southern Norway, the Arsi and Galla in Southern Ethiopia, Chiapan groups in Central Mexico, groups of Pashtuns in Afghanistan and West Pakistan, and various groups in Laos). Each is a richly contextualized presentation of historically conditioned ethnic social practices and beliefs: all related back to the introductory theory. For me, the core of anthropology is fine-grained ethnographic attention to the \"local\" and sustained cross-cultural comparison, and Barth's volume has always been a delightful, paradigmatic example of how it's done (and a pleasure to read!).\n\nNot only love and darkness co-exist within this book, but also fact and fiction, hope and despair, ideology and reality and a personal story written by a child about his parents intertwining with a communal story of national rebirth. And yet, while it is probably the ultimate work of Hebrew literature, Israeli and local in its essence, this book has become an international bestseller, earning acclaim in cultures that share few, if any, commonalities with Israeli culture. Mainly for this reason, I have chosen this book that has affected so much my understanding of Israel and its culture as the one that carries special meaning for me. Amos Oz, who is both one of Israel's most prominent writers and a leading peace activist, is an admirable example of an intellectual who maintains a deep identification with the plight of his people and is proud of his heritage, but at the same time, communicates well with cultures not his own and cares about the plight of others, his nemeses included. The success of this book and its cross-cultural appeal illustrates that cultural uniqueness does not mean cultural closure. As such it helps highlight a central claim in my studies of the institutionalized closure of Israeli culture.\n\nJanet Fitchen's work has fundamental"
