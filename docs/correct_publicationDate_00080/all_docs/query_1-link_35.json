        "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that Americans are an incorrigibly religious people: the overwhelming majority say they believe in God, and most attend houses of worship with some regularity. With the growing shift toward a more conservative social philosophy in the country at large, an appreciation for religion has even begun to invade the consciousness of elite journalists and editors. But in the world of network TV and the movies (as, for that matter, in the world of contemporary American fiction), one would be hard-pressed to find much more than a hint of the significant part played by religion in American lives.\n\nAs far as the movies are concerned, this is not an entirely new phenomenon. True, in the 1940’s and 50’s a sort of sub-genre flourished that did pay respect to inspirational sentiments: the genre included such now-classics as The Bells of St. Mary’s, Miracle on 34th Street, Going My Way, and, the strongest of them all, It’s a Wonderful Life. Nor should one forget biblical epics like The Ten Commandments and their close cousins, the sword-and-sandal spectacles with Christian themes like Barabbas and El Cid. But none of these movies, loaded down as they were with Hollywood bombast and/or Hollywood treacle, had much to do with real piety or a sense of spiritual mission. For that, one would have to turn to a handful of foreign films including Roberto Rossellini’s The Flowers of St. Francis (1950), Ingmar Bergman’s Winter Light (1963), the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky’s exquisite Andrei Rublev (1966), and, more problematically, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964).\n\nSo it is interesting that Hollywood has finally given us a movie, Contact, which appears to take the religious perspective seriously. It is no small movie, either, but a big-budget special-effects spectacular whose theme is the possibility of discovering “advanced civilizations” on other planets. In exploring that theme, Contact purports to stage a head-on confrontation over one of the big issues of our time: the conflict between secularism and religion.\n\nContact is based on a 1985 novel of the same name by the late Carl Sagan, the famous astronomer and gifted popularizer of science. It stars the Oscar-winning Jodie Foster; features the hot new celebrity, Matthew McConaughey; and is directed by Robert Zemeckis, of Forrest Gump fame. Though in box-office terms Contact has not matched the success of the cartoonish Men in Black—which is also about inter-galactic aliens—it has done well enough, with one of the highest per-screen average grosses of this summer’s movies. And if the critical reception has been mixed, those critics who have praised the film have placed special emphasis on the seriousness of its themes.\n\nWould that they were right.\n\n_____________\n\nCarl Sagan is best-known for his teachings about the wonders of space exploration, both in books and in a public-television series, Cosmos, which has reportedly been seen by hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide. Less well-known are his ideological side—during the late stages of the cold war, he was a zealous advocate of (American) nuclear disarmament—and his philosophical views. A lifelong skeptic, rationalist, and agnostic, Sagan wrote frequently about what he saw as the inevitable displacement of religious belief by scientific truth.\n\nReligion, for Sagan (here taking a tacit cue from Freud, among others), was a myth-system created to deal with human uncertainty. But in the early modern era, as scientific methods gained ascendancy, the forces of orthodoxy became increasingly exposed as outmoded bastions of superstition, struggling to hold on to their power by suppressing or distorting the truth about reality. Sagan conceded that religion did give people a kind of hope; but it was a hope based on illusion. In his view, scientific optimism offered a more than adequate replacement for religious hope, just as the sense of wonder inherent in scientific discovery offered a more than adequate replacement for religious awe.\n\nFinally, Sagan was a tireless advocate of searching the heavens for signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life. Applying evolutionary theory to the cosmos as a whole, he reasoned that somewhere in the vast number of potentially life-sustaining planets, natural selection must have found a way to coax other collections of organic molecules into life. Since this would have happened long before the relatively recent birth of our own life forms, there was a distinct possibility that “technical civilizations,” developed beyond our own capacities, existed “out there” in the cosmos.\n\nThe discovery of such alien intelligence would, Sagan was convinced, offer ultimate vindication of the Darwinian challenge not only to the creationist “myth” but to the entire structure of Jewish and Christian teleology. Once human beings were shown to be neither unique nor all that special, the vanity that propped up religious faith—for Sagan, a kind of covert narcissism by which humans projected their own imagined centrality onto an ersatz “supreme being”—would be discredited once and for all. Man, having been demoted, would be able to see clearly at last.\n\n_____________\n\nAnd so we come to Contact, both the novel and the movie. Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) is an astronomer who spends countless hours at her radio telescopes—large, radar-like antennae that focus on regions of space—listening to cosmic static and hoping to discern an intelligible signal. Fighting off both scientific skeptics and the demands of political expediency, Ellie struggles to keep her mission going. And one day, out of the blue, she is rewarded: instead of random noise, she hears a signal of seeming regularity. As astronomers around the world confirm, the signal is of unknown, extraterrestrial origin.\n\nOnce decoded, the signal turns out to contain an elaborate set of instructions for a machine to transport an earthling to the vicinity of the star Vega, 26 light years away. At a cost of hundreds of billions, the machine is indeed built, and after several reversals Ellie is chosen to make the journey. Propelled through the universe via tunnels in space-time, she arrives at last on a lovely beach where she encounters an alien being in the simulated form of her own long-dead father. He informs her that he is part of a cosmic network of similar beings but refuses to enlighten her further, insisting that “small steps” are necessary for mankind.\n\nEllie then returns to earth, where to her dismay everyone is convinced that the machine malfunctioned, and that in fact she has not gone anywhere. Her alleged experiences on the alien planet chalked up to hallucination or lies, Ellie is subjected to humiliating public and private interrogation. In the end, neither vindicated nor disproved, she is left with her own convictions and a number of faithful followers.\n\n_____________\n\nContact, the movie, features several spectacular sequences, including an opening shot that moves gradually from deep space through various star systems and gaseous nebulae to Earth as, on the soundtrack, a babble of radio transmissions suggests how we humans might have made our presence known to alien beings. The sequence depicting Ellie’s “flight” to Vega is another impressive light show, the most elaborate of its kind since 2001 (a movie whose metaphysical aspirations most closely match this one).\n\nThe movie’s human spectacle, however, is not so impressive. Jodie Foster can always be counted upon to evoke her special amalgam of fierce independence and vulnerability; in this sense, her performance here reprises her role as the government investigator in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). But in Contact she errs consistently on the side of independence, with the result that she seems always to be performing at the other actors rather than with them. We are clearly meant to identify with the character she plays; but her self-righteousness—an unwitting reflection of Sagan’s own personality—is a turn-off.\n\nNot, admittedly, for Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), the movie’s representative religious figure: a lapsed seminarian with golden locks and a winning smile, he has a very brief affair with Ellie and then keeps reappearing in her life at unexpected moments. A number of reviewers have complained that the alleged chemistry between these characters seems fake on screen, and so it does. In part, this is no doubt due to the incoherence of the roles they are asked to play. Palmer is there to slow Ellie down with religious tribulations, but (despite the movie’s leisurely pace) Zemeckis is in such a hurry to get Ellie packing off to Vega that no real exchange of views takes place between them.\n\nStill, that may be just as well. Critics who like the film have tended to say (as do, piously, the film’s principals in their publicity materials) that it is even-handed in its presentation of science and religion. But this is nonsense. We first see Ellie, for example, as a young girl living with her widowered father. When he collapses of a heart condition, she fails to retrieve his medicine in time to prevent his death. A well-meaning priest tries to console her by affirming that what happened was God’s will. No, she retorts sharply, it was only poor judgment: if she had stored the pills in a more accessible place, her father would still be alive. The camera lingers on the priest’s scandalized expression: alongside the life-saving potential of science, religion’s solace, we are made to see, is a cheap and impotent thing.\n\nThen there is Palmer Joss. We meet him shortly before Ellie sleeps with him; he is wearing a dirty T-shirt and exudes the phony charm of an egotist. Palmer, however, is on the way up. With his folksy manner, comfortingly bland theology, and the pseudo-intellectual authenticity provided by his divinity degree, he wins national prominence and improbably wheedles his way into a position as adviser to the President. In this capacity, he meets Ellie again when she comes to present her discovery to the White House.\n\nWinning her trust, Palmer vows, despite his own religious doubts about the project, to back her effort to get to Vega; but then he betrays her before an international panel of experts looking for a representative earthling by asking if she believes in God. She can only reply, candidly, that “as a scientist” she lacks proof of divine existence, an answer that disqualifies her with her examiners. Thus is intellectual integrity itself turned into a stick with which unscrupulous religion beats down reason and scientific honesty alike.\n\nWhat keeps Palmer sympathetic is not the sincerity of his religious convictions, for which no evidence is offered, but his apparent love for Ellie. Later on, to make up for his betrayal, he endorses her belief that she really did travel to an alien planet, thus surrendering his own theological convictions for her sake if not for the sake of truth. But lest this seem to sweeten the overall portrait of religious believers offered in Contact, the filmmakers go out of their way to contrive other unattractive images. Thus, Ellie’s scientific mentor is killed in an act of terrorism committed by a Bible-thumping fundamentalist with a long blond mane and crazed stare; and her mission is anathematized by an oily Christian minister with political ambitions who bears the charming name of Richard Rank. This minister is described in the movie’s press kit as “the right-wing leader of a conservative religious coalition,” and somehow it comes as no surprise to learn that in preparing for the part, Rob Lowe, the actor who plays him, consciously modeled himself on the former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed.\n\nWith the various religious figures in Contact trashed for their dishonesty, hypocrisy, bad faith, and fanaticism, it is no wonder that religion itself should emerge in hopeless caricature, and that we glean no hint either of its sources of truth or of its power. Of course, science too does not exactly fare brilliantly in the hands of Contact‘s makers, being reduced essentially to pulp and pop. But at least they know enough to know they need to be respectful. When it comes to religion, Hollywood still has a long way to go if it ever means to catch up with the rest of the country.\n\n_____________"
