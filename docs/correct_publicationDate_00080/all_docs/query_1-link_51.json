I argue that to fully understand these roles we should see reputations as produced by communicative acts, consider how reputations become known about, and study the factors influencing such processes. I reapply James Secord's ‘knowledge-in-transit’ approach; in addition to scientific knowledge, I also examine how ‘biographical knowledge’ of individuals is constructed through communications and shaped by communicative contexts. My case study is Carl Sagan, widely discussed – amongst scientists, media professionals and publics – for his skill as a charismatic popularizer, his perceived arrogance, his political activism, and his debated merit as a researcher. By examining how aspects of Sagan's reputation circulated alongside his scientific work – rather than existing as a static context for his scientific work – I show how different forms of knowledge (biographical and scientific) influence each other as they circulate.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nThe British Journal for the History of Science , Volume 52 , Issue 3 , September 2019 , pp. 467 - 486\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007087419000049 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © British Society for the History of Science 2019\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

(10), p. 177.\n\n78\n\n78 This phenomenon is given a fascinating slant in Mialet, op. cit. (62). Motives behind continuing the ‘glamor-boy of astronomy’ image varied between parties – Sagan and collaborator Gentry Lee wanted to promote flagging public interest in planetary exploration (McCurdy, op. cit. 45, pp. 58, 78); director Adrian Malone wished to ‘make a star out of Sagan’ as he had done with Jacob Bronowski (Shirley Arden in Spangenburg and Moser, op. cit. (10), p. 95); KCET saw Sagan's image as good for marketing (see Poundstone, op. cit. (10), pp. 256–257); for the purported role of Sagan's ego see Lynn Margulis in Poundstone, op. cit.

(10), p. 282. This reputation had been circulating amongst the scientific community for decades – even the largely hagiographic Men of Space profile noted that ‘sometimes, Sagan's air of confidence is provoking. His assurance … has caused rancor’. Thomas, op. cit. (16), p. 186. But responses to Cosmos gave this a vast new audience.\n\n82\n\n82 Glenn Collins, ‘Sagans mix fact and fiction’, New York Times, 27 October 1985, p. 15E. Some have suggested that director Adrian Malone, with whom Sagan had a fraught relationship, deliberately included these shots to embarrass Sagan – see Poundstone, op. cit. (10), p. 260. Despite criticisms, the show was extremely popular. John O'Connor, ‘Putting Cosmos in perspective’, op. cit. (80), noted that ‘in terms of audience ratings, it is among the most popular television series produced for the Public Broadcasting Service’. Davidson, op. cit. (10), p. 318, estimates that by 1999 the show had been watched by over 400 million people.\n\n83\n\n83 See the collected interviews in Head, op. cit.
