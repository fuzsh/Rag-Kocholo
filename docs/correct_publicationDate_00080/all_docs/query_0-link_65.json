        "text": "*I only read through Chapter 12 so this review is not completely accurate*\n\n(The First 12 Chapters of)\n\nby Carl Sagan\n\nFiction, Science Fiction\n\n16+\n\nSeptember 1985 by Simon & Schuster\n\n★★★★★ / DNF\n\nSummary\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky and thought “is there anything out there?” For Ellie, her whole life is centered around this one question, she even built a career out of it, despite having to fight the constant sexism of college as well as the workforce. As a young girl she was always curious, and much smarter than anybody could ever expect. She was reading by three, and began teaching herself calculus in the seventh grade, concepts most high school seniors don’t understand. She’s curious about life in general, so when she gets the Message from Vega, she immediately gets to work decoding it, contacting anyone she needs to help her. She’s sure that this Message is proof that there is extraterrestrial life, and anyone who says otherwise is ignoring the facts.\n\nReview\n\nFrom the beginning I wasn’t a huge fan, it was too detailed and didn’t catch my attention. As someone who typically reads books with a ton of suspense or action, the technical nature of Contact wasn’t a good match for me. I found myself getting distracted a lot during the sciencey parts (which for the record is most of the book) and honestly the romance just seemed forced. *SPOILERS* There was no real build-up to the relationship between Ellie and der Heer, it was just sprung upon us. And we don’t see much of their relationship following that either, as they soon become too busy to be together. *END SPOILER* What’s the point of adding romance if immediately they start having conflict? And can we PLEASE avoid the cliche forbidden love? I don’t ask for much.\n\nAlthough as a general concept the book sucked, the characters were relatable, I’ll say that much. At the beginning (and only the beginning), I found myself relating to Ellie (that didn’t last, she annoys me). She’s just a curious young girl who wants to understand everything, as exemplified when she asks “How could anybody know that the decimals go on and on forever?” (Sagan 6). Not to mention doing calculus in seventh grade, why can’t I be that smart! I’m forever banished to waiting until senior year. Where did my parents go wrong? The best character was Vaygay, at least he was entertaining if not slightly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nRecommendation\n\nFor those of you who’ve been here before, you most likely realize that I rarely DNF books on purpose. I keep reading hoping it will eventually get better (it won’t) or just out of sheer hatred for DNFing. So this is a big moment, I finally did something semi-logical and stopped reading the book (which was for book club and 3/5 group members so we’re movinng on [thank god]). As you can probably (hopefully) tell from my review, most of my issues with Contact was the technical nature of the story. I don’t know anything about space (other than what I learned in Earth Space Science) nor do I understand how radio telescopes work (shocking I know, the genius doesn’t understand not only one thing but two!). Because of this I was lost for a good majority of the book, and also I’m way too lazy to google what I didn’t understand, I’d have to google the google definition! I think Contact would be a great book for people who are interested in extraterrestrial life (read aliens) or studying space in general. But if you’re looking for an action packed book this probably isn’t your best choice, sorry.\n\nAbout The Author\n\n“Carl Sagan was Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences and Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University.
