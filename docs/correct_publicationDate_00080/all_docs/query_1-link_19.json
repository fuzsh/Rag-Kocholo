        "text": "In 1995, Carl Sagan wrote The Demon-Haunted World, and it was published in 1996. The was book intended to dispel myths, explain the dangers of pseudoscience, allow readers to develop their critical thinking skills and above all explain the beauty of science to the world.\n\nIn chapter 2, entitled Science and Hope he writes the following:\n\n\"But there's another reason: science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.\n\nAs I write, the number one video cassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. Beavis and Butthead remains popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning - not just of science, but of anything - are avoidable, even undesirable. We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements - transportation, communications, and all other industries; agriculture, medicine, education, entertainment, protecting the environment; and even the key democratic institution of voting - profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.\"\n\nHe continues to explain the idea of the Candle in the Dark:\n\n\"A Candle in the Dark is the title of a courageous, largely Biblically based, book by Thomas Ady, published in London in 1656, attacking the witch-hunts then in progress as a scam 'to delude the people'. Any illness or storm, anything out of the ordinary, was popularly attributed to witchcraft. Witches must exist, Ady quoted the 'witchmongers' as arguing, 'else how should these things be, or come to pass?' For much of our history, we were so fearful of the outside world, with its unpredictable dangers, that we gladly embraced anything that promised to soften or explain away the terror. Science is an attempt, largely successful, to understand the world, to get a grip on things, to get hold of ourselves, to steer a safe course. Microbiology and meteorology now explain what only a few centuries ago was considered sufficient cause to burn women to death.\n\nAdy also warned of the danger that 'the Nations [will] perish for lack of knowledge'. Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves. I worry that, especially as the millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls.\n\nThe candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.\"\n\nNearly 30 years on, do you think his thoughts still ring true? What do you think he would make of the rise of Trumpism and far right thining around the world? The resurgence of the anti-vax movement and the manner in which the Covid pandemic has been managed? Social media and its dangers?\n\nAnd above all else, the manner in which science is taught around the world, and in some circles treated with disdain?\n\nI was a massive fan of the unexplained: cryptozoology and hauntology and pseudosciences.\n\nI read this book when it came out, having no knowledge of who Sagan was. I thought this was a book explaining supernatural phenomenon so I was very disappointed at first to learn that it was more critical of people who believed in pseudoscience than being a \"fun breakdown of unexplained stuff\".\n\nI could not stop reading however, no matter how mad and bored I was learning it was basically mocking some of the people who wrote books that I was in love with. It helped make me a skeptic, ruined years of \"fun conspiracy stuff\". I kind of hated it for that. But it also made me more interested and fascinated with finding why things happen.\n\nIronically enough, as the title of this thread states, there are people who would never read this book and are now loud and dangerous. My anger at him being skeptical of things like UFOs was absolutely fractional compared to what he really was pointing out: how misinformation and lies can create actual devestating effects on human society if unabated.\n\nRight, I was into conspiracy theories and UFOs as a teenager, and as I got more educated I realized how baseless it all was and wish I could have gone back and grown up with the interest I now have for science. I would have probably ended up with a more fulfilling career. Now imagines how many this could be true for around the world, how much more would we have progressed by now?\n\nYes, I believe this still rings true. This very topic, and Sagan's thoughts in particular, have been on my mind a lot these past few years.\n\nWe live in, despite all the bad new, dangers, etc., what I can't help but feel might be the apex, and golden age, of the human race upon this planet (barring a secret Atlantis, or Battlestar Gallactica past, in our history). Standards of living, science, literature, television, movies, videogames, art, philosophy, etc., all seem, again, at least to me, like they have never been better (not for all, of course, but many). I find myself constantly amazed by what we as a species have accomplished, and are still accomplishing, driving society, progress, invention, creativity ever more forward...\n\nBut no, it's not all good. I could spend all day listing the things that disappoint, worry, or terrify me, from civil rights, to nuclear war, climate change...\n\nBut to adhere to the point of this topic most appropriately? And address what may be, if not at the root of all our problems, than at least, possibly, most? Fear. Anti-intellectualism. Demagogues, and demons.\n\nWe as a species may, in the aggregate, have a reach that has exceeded our grasp. We may have bitten off more than we can safely chew. The wondrous progress, knowledge, and nearly God-like powers we have amassed hold, perhaps, equal or greater risks to us when not used safely, by the right people, with the right mindsets.\n\nDoes that mean I think we will necessarily blow ourselves up, or poison the planet to 100% death, create a terminator scenario, the matrix, planet of the apes, Frankenstein's monster, or become some non-human monsters ourselves? Yes and no. Yes it's possible, but that is not really my worry. As a science fiction fan I want the Star Trek utopia future, or something like it, and the only way to get there is to keep pushing, risks and all.\n\nNo, what I mean is that our education systems have been failing us, and perhaps the base code of our species as well.\n\nChange can be frightening. Very frightening for some. Confusion too. We want to know. We crave knowledge, and the mastery, safety it gives us. As a species we have thrived, set ourselves apart from other animals for 1000s of years because of our hyper inquisitive nature, \"outsmarting\" our so-called lesser, inferior animal neighbors, domination of them and the planet. Knowledge meant prosperity. Ignorance meant death.\n\nBut for many now, sadly, the world makes little to no sense. They don't understand how things work anymore. Heck, they hardly did 100 years ago. Social structures. Self identities. Technology... I mean, I consider myself well educated, a science lover, technology fetishizer, have spent countless hours, days, weeks, months, years of my life studying, reading, researching tech and science, and much of the devices, technologies, and discoveries we have, and are still improving and evolving today boggle my mind.\n\nFor me? It just drives me to learn more, understand better. For others? Without my passions, inclinations and history? Who couldn't escape, unharmed, from repressive homes, peer groups, institutions with more open and adventurous minds in tact? Understandably, there is an impulse to go back. To reverse the clock to when things \"made sense\". To say modern society is wrong, and getting wronger. To want to, perhaps, burn it all down, ala luddites, or fight club, or x y z.\n\nI believe my viewpoint is \"better\", insofar as I am generally more informed than they, process things in a more logical and consistent way, and am supported by healthier, less self destructive impulses. I believe that the achievement of their misguided goals will not make them happy, and is instead just an endless rabbit hole of scapegoating, demagoguery, and decline on all fronts. But a part of me does, at least a little, appreciate their predicament.\n\nChange is scary. Progress is disorienting. Remaining in the same place, static, unchanging, immortal in ideology and lifestyle, has a certain smotheringly safe, stale savor to it, and I mean that in all honesty. There are parts of myself, and likely parts of all of us, even Sagan, that we would never want to change without a fight.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nI still have hope. I still believe in this golden age of hours, warts, scars, self-devouring monsters and all. As a lover of fiction, epic fiction, science fiction and fantasy, our era has something of the tragic and heroic to it. A narrative of conflict, upheaval, dread and glory that appeals to me. Call me naive, but I still think we can pull through. Not that we will, but that it's possible. That we have the tools, knowledge, and brave figures willing to work hard, campaign, and push us all forward. Hell, I even believe the majority still basically want us to, that the opposition is still more a vocal minority than anything else.\n\nCould I be wrong? Possibly.\n\nMight we become idiocracy, or worse, a desolate hellscape devoid of life, or some dystopian nightmare? Possibly.\n\nBut life has never been guaranteed, and never will be, even if we go the route of Children of Time, can clone, upload our consciousness to machines, and achieve pseudo immortality and nearly true godhood.\n\nHeat death. Universal contraction. Gamma Ray's. Alien invasions. Dimensional warping...\n\nAnything could happen. The universe is infinite, maybe anything, everything already has, and will again.\n\nBut I still like our odds. I still relish the struggle. We have come far, almost farther than I can believe, and imagine. Who knows what the future may bring :D\n\nIt's all still on-point enough to remain quite relevant. The specific predictions don't have to be completely accurate to sustain the core point.\n\nAlso, as far as Sagan sounding melodramatic and reactionary when critiquing popular culture - don't forget how commonly people fail to grasp the media they consume. They make heroes of the bad guys and take literally the opposite messages intended by the creators of the entertainment. The underlying point is was the general dumbing down of all media, leading to an overall environment that doesn't challenge people and allows them to easily maintain a dumb perspective on what they consume.\n\nHe was also correct in warning that leaders would become unable to deal with or even grasp the fundamental issues of the day. The details of how that came about might vary, but in the end, yes: they either purposefully obscure the truth of issues to take advantage of the misinformed, dumb, and gullible - or they're so out of touch they genuinely don't understand.\n\nAnd maybe the most pertinent observation to our present moment: everything has come to depend on a technological and technocratic foundation, but almost nobody understands this, or the technology. People are being vastly and helplessly manipulated because they don't grasp how anything works - it's the \"can't even name two government branches out of three\" issue applied to everything. Everywhere I go, if I listen to casual conversation something that now stands out to me is just this:\n\nPeople are baffled.\n\nThere is simply confusion over how and why anything is happening, who is responsible for what, or whatever the fuck. Yeah, yeah, \"people have always been dumb\". Yes, the human animal trends towards just going with the flow and only dealing with whatever it absolutely has to in front it.\n\nBut in prior ages, if the average person didn't have a clue about the court of the king, they could fall back on a world that was understandable in even uneducated human terms. Till the fields, keep the boats patched, haggle in an economy simple enough to be grasped at the ground level, chop wood for the winter.\n\nToday is different. We're at the other end of a century of replacing almost every basis of human life with an artificial and complicated stack of abstractions mediated by technology at every step. And those with power have figured out this is a ripe time for manipulating human beings. Take advantage of psychological habits that occur when there is ignorance.\n\nIt's all still on-point enough to remain quite relevant.
