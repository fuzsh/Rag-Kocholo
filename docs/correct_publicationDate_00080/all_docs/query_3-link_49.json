Ms. Marinaccio is a Creative Director of Design Services and Presentation Strategies at Warner Bros. and founder of Fishbrain, LLC.

She eventually moved on to receive a Bachelor of Fine Art from University of California at Berkeley in 1994. By 2004 she had added post graduate work in Apparel Design at the College of Alameda. As of 2014 she is currently ABT (All But Thesis) for her Master’s in Apparel Design and Merchandising from California State University at Northridge. In all of this time Ms. Healey has run the gamut of medium from crayons and pencil, to acrylic and oils. From paint by number and “panel” sewing to wall sized canvases and fashion shows. She has played with wood and wire in sculpture, and dance and music for movement. She had dabbled with, and dropped, many mediums only to rediscover them when she embraced process over product, and the zen of allowing a piece to unfold and evolve as she worked on it. Along the way Ms. Healey has held a wide variety of jobs, each one in its own way contributing to her artistry; even if only extremely creative organization and cleaning. Somewhere on this path she discovered a love of teaching and applied it to all of her creative endeavors. She has taught computers, color theory, sewing machines, sewing quilts, garments, and home decor, organization, time management, and outside the box ways to market and grow personal business and portfolios. Her teaching career has spanned homes, studios, retail environments, trade shows, and professionally at the college level. In the last decade Ms. Healey has narrowed her interest to all things fiber and ways to combine those elements. She uses dye and other pigments with stitching to create wall or wearable art. She dyes one of a kind yardage, yarns, and painted warps and turns around to use those in garments, paintings, weavings, and knitting. She loves the texture and movement of textiles, the presence in 3 dimensions, and the illusion of 3 dimensions. She works with all of the yummy feeling fibers and fabrics so that she will enjoy the process of creation and others will enjoy the touching or wearing. Ms. Healey takes great delight in the use of color in gradations and variegations, analogous and complementary, warm and cool, bold and subtle. While she has often claimed she has color ADHD, she often works in a limited or even monochromatic palette.

She was raised in Miami, Los Angeles, Oakland and on the open road along Highway 10. Her transitory childhood is an important part of her art practice. Beginning with a simple line, DeJesus creates fantastical representations of autobiographical and imaginary characters and worlds in her drawings. Her pictures reverberate constant movement taking the viewer on a wild ride through her abundant imagery, and concoct a rich soup of play, warmth and darkness that only an individual who has experienced deep loss and love could conjure. Her works, Carrier and Fantasy Car, are two such drawings that explore the ebb and flow of family, friends, lovers and mentors who have left a mark on the artist’s life. They will soon be permanently installed at Foothills Elementary as part of the Washington State Art Collection, a place of great significance for the artist. Veronica DeJesus has had numerous solo shows at galleries in New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco, including a remarkable exhibition of her Memorial drawings at The Berkeley Art Museum. Her work has been featured in publications around the world—notably, People Are a Light to Love, a collection of inspirational drawings spanning 12 years. Veronica is currently the Artist in Residence at the community-based Transformative Arts program and is creating a body of new work for an upcoming solo exhibition at Anglim/Trimble gallery in San Francisco. She holds an MFA from UC Berkeley and a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute.\n\nYury Chudnovsky\n\nYury Chudnovsky is an artist, calligrapher, educator, product designer, and founder of YC Fine Art Studio.
