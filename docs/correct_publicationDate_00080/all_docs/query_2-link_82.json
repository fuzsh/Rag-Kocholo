        "text": "There is so much to say about the many endeavors by professional scientists to explain to us the world. The list is long: Carl Sagan, Harald Lesch, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sabine Hossenfelder, Michio Kaku, and I even saw Roger Penrose and Steven Hawking on tv. The list is - of course - considerably longer than that. Even the subject isn't actually new:\n\nAlbert Einstein: What I most admire about your art, is your universality. You don't say a word, yet the world understands you!\n\nCharles Chaplin: True. But your glory is even greater! The whole world admires you, even though they don't understand a word of what you say.​\n\nYou've probably heard about this quotation (## \\sim## 1932), however, it cannot be verified. Nevertheless, it brings us directly to the matter. For one, the world of communication has changed dramatically ever since, and secondly, nobody apparently cares about whether something can be verified. But even this isn't new. Someone to whom I told an anecdote about a professor we both knew replied:\n\nBrooks Ferrebee: I don't think this story is true. Its charm is that it could be true.​\n\nThat was about forty years ago. There is so much to say about ...\n\nErich Kästner: Es gibt nichts Gutes, außer man tut es. 1950.\n\n(There is nothing good unless you do it.)​\n\n... so I decided to add my two cents to a discussion that frequently turns up on physicsforums.com whenever someone read or watched, better: consumed an explanation of a phenomenon - usually from astrophysics or quantum mechanics, occasionally mathematics - given by someone who is a reputable and respected scientist who tries honestly to share their knowledge with us all.\n\nContinue reading...\n\nImpossible to prove, but Sagan's efforts at popularization probably did hurt him, e.g., the National Academy off Sciences affair. From\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-carl-sagan-truly-irreplaceable-180949818/\n\n\"Sagan’s emergence as the country’s top science popularizer ruffled many of his colleagues. Much of science is, as Sagan himself noted, prohibitive in nature, setting limits on what is and is not physically possible—thou shall not go faster than the speed of light, and so on. Beyond that, the scientific community as a social and even political entity has a number of clear and well-enforced, if unwritten, rules, including, Thou shalt not speculate, thou shalt not talk about things outside your immediate area of expertise, and thou shalt not horse around on late-night TV talk shows.\n\nThe scientific community’s divided opinion about Sagan came to a head in 1992, when Sagan was on the verge of being elected, as part of a larger pool of 60 nominees, to the National Academy of Sciences. A rump caucus of scientists within the Academy made a fuss, saying Sagan hadn’t accomplished enough in his research. After a hot debate, with Sagan supporters defending his hard-science achievements, the frowners prevailed, and Sagan’s name was flicked from the list of the newly anointed. Sagan received condolence letters from outraged colleagues; in an interview with me a few years later he shrugged it off, saying he’d always assumed he’d never get in. But Druyan told me, “It was painful. It seemed like a kind of unsolicited slight.” The Academy tried to salve the wound in 1994 by giving Sagan an honorary medal for his contributions to public understanding of science.\"\n\nfresh_42 said:\n\nWell, I have written a comment, not a pamphlet. It reflects my experiences and does not aim to provoke.\n\nCriticism first and asking second would be a suitable method to answer a pamphlet. It is, however, rude in case of a comment. See, there are a lot of fine lines to draw!\n\nAn example: A mathematician I knew well has written a book about Virasoro algebras, but it didn't make him a string theorist - although he tried!\n\nStill too vague. Look at least to yourself. You have insights into other sciences than in which you earned your degree. Or is this not true? No. Almost certainly it must be true. Other than that, maybe if you 'feel' you do not have insights of other sciences, you know other people in Sciences. You can check with them about what insights they have in other sciences. Some of these people must have those other insights. Further - people who were your professors? Knew any who earned degree in one field and later a degree in a DIFFERENT field? Certainly you knew some.\n\nsymbolipoint said:\n\nStill too vague. Look at least to yourself.

Certainly you knew some.\n\nHow can you even dare to judge what experiences I have or not?\n\nswampwiz said:\n\nAs a precocious lad (no, not in THAT sense ), I had an inquisitive & empirical mind about science, and so when I would be taking a test or doing homework in science, I had always felt that I had to give an answer in keeping with the level of abstraction that the course was about. E.G., in middle-school physical science, there was the topic of the conservation of energy, which really was about the conservation of mechanical energy presuming perfectly elastic collisions, so when I got to the test, I had to remember to \"dumb myself down\" and forget about the extra DOF with respect to inelastic collisions. As my teacher had the moniker \"Coach\", I wondered about whether he even knew about collision inelasticity.\n\nIn middle school……not likely.\n\nApologies if I use too many vague examples below, but I see similarities to the question you pose here, and other activities we all partake in on a day-to-day basis (in my case, music).\n\nIn my opinion, both the criticism of, and the praise of, \"pop sci\" is valid. I'm a musician and I hang out with jazz purists who feel that musicians who explore other arts and \"dabble\" in jazz are only taking away from the art, rather than adding to it. Wynton Marsalis (who won a grammy in both classical AND jazz at age 22) labeled MILES DAVIS, \"a general who has betrayed his country\" for choosing to play alternative genres which were more accessible to American audiences. Miles. Davis. Does Miles deserve this criticism because he no longer heralded jazz as \"something we must preserve\"?\n\nI got a masters in aeronautics and propulsion because I saw Saturn V launch footage on Adult Swim. Literally made up my mind from a YouTube video. I like to say 'never ignore a dumb reason to do something great'. If the \"pop sci\" content adds nothing to your life in STEM other than having some supposed \"fanboys\" hovering around you while you work in your field, so be it. Who cares. I believe we deprive otherwise effective and efficient thinkers from entering STEM when we start caring about whether or not Apollo 11 references should've been in a Pop Tarts ad, Or Neil Degrasse Tyson should've started TOURING with a science show (even I think that's overkill!).\n\nHOWEVER, I make an observation at my work. The greatest technical minds are oftentimes the worst communicators. Should we impose on them ideals of inclusivity and force them to \"leave their corners\" so as to impart their knowledge to everyone? I'd argue not. Let genius minds work as they do, and let the communicators in STEM continue breaking down barriers and hinderances, including the illusion of \"STEM is impossible for me to do, I only got a 3.3 GPA in high school\", which must be broken not for the sake of science, but for the sake of the welfare of mankind!\n\n\"Pop sci\" is a contributing factor to enabling young minds to flip the odds on the casino, say \"yes, I can do this\", and reap the benefits of a career in STEM. I have coworkers, fellow artists, and people on a day-to-day basis who are welcoming of people new to activities. I also know people who are critical of these people, so as to nurture the already thriving sessions of (insert-your-activity-here) they already have going with their controlled group of experts in their activity. A matter of personality, and I'd argue \"live and let live\" comes into play here.\n\nEnd word vomit. I hope my views challenge and are appreciated.\n\nI don’t know if this is the thread for it so apologies if this post is misplaced and delete it if so.\n\nI believe there are different classes of popularizers\n\n1) those who are active in science research and want to reach people and slowly push them in the direction of actual science\n\n2) those who are completely ego driven and do nothing to push people in the direction of studying actual science. But rather feed their ego about understanding the most trivial facts.\n\nI believe the most egregious example of the latter is Neil DeGrasse Tyson.\n\nIn the clip referenced he says that dead bodies feel cold because they are no longer giving off heat as a byproduct of energy breakdown.\n\nWhile this sounds fascinating it’s essentially equivalent to\n\n“Touching a car engine that’s on will burn you while touching a car engine that’s been off for awhile won’t”\n\nHow does this reveal anything new or get viewers to study deeper intricacies (such as the virial theorem)?\n\nIt does nothing but enable NDGT to stroke his ego by revealing middle school facts.\n\nPhDeezNutz said:\n\nI don’t know if this is the thread for it so apologies if this post is misplaced and delete it if so.\n\nI believe there are different classes of popularizers\n\n1) those who are active in science research and want to reach people and slowly push them in the direction of actual science\n\n2) those who are completely ego driven and do nothing to push people in the direction of studying actual science.
