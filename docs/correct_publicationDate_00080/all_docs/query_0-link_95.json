        "text": "Why I Love This Book\n\nEllie Arroway, the main character, is curious. She doesn’t have the courage to deny her curiosity, instead she embraces it square on and digs in no apologies. When her work was dismissed as science fiction, she responds angrily:\n\n“You wanna hear something really nutty? I heard of a couple guys who wanna build something called an “airplane,” you know you get people to go in, and fly around like birds, it’s ridiculous, right? And what about breaking the sound barrier, or rockets to the moon, or atomic energy, or a mission to Mars? Science fiction, right? Look, all I’m asking, is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision. You know, to just sit back for one minute and look at the big picture. To take a chance on something that just might end up being the most profoundly impactful moment for humanity, for the history… of history.”\n\n– Ellie Arroway, Contact by Carl Sagan\n\nBeing doubted relentlessly only increases her determination. She remains an amiable heroine to befriend. Her love interest Palmer Joss is a religious man, and their debates give readers both postures to chew. Her adversaries are colleagues, zealots, politicians, and at times the US President herself.\n\nThe stronghold on science Ellie wields in her defense is often a path through the argument. The antagonists lose ground with readers when her words shift debate to contagious inquisitiveness. It’s also here where Sagan fans realize that the author wrote much of himself into her.\n\nIf part of your reading enjoyment is learning new vocabulary in context, Sagan will deliver. One of the perks of reading the Kindle version is the ability to see the New Oxford American Dictionary’s definition and pronunciation of words you click on. The space machine that is built for travel through a black hole is a dodecahedron. Here’s some other words: ideogram, metallurgy, the Vega system, erbium, dendritic, geodesic, and rarefaction. Sagan’s describes in the book the awe Ellie sees while visiting the cosmic beach as, “An amoeba of blackness leaked out from the zenith, obscuring Sun and blue sky.”\n\nLet’s Talk Movie Differences\n\nCarl Sagan’s novel was much different then the movie. To pique movie watchers’ interest, there were multiple astronauts launched in the dodecahedron with Ellie to the unknown. Two machines were built and known about from the start in Wyoming and Uzbekistan. Ellie was with Drumlin when the explosion caused his fate and the sequence of events very different.\n\nThe 1997 movie, “Contact” stars Jodie Foster who narrates the version of the audiobook I prefer. She plays the heroine, Eleanor “Ellie” Arroway who’s mocked until she makes contact with unknown intelligence. The movie plays on the building of the spaceship from the transmitted plans coming from Vega. It centers around the global controversy that transpired as nations were unsure if it was Pandora’s box. Along the way, she has a tremulous relationship with Palmer Joss, a popular preacher that challenges her atheist beliefs. He’s played by Matthew McConaughey. The imagery, although not in high definition of today, brought to the audience the magnificence of Carl Sagan’s privileged view.\n\nExtraordinary Author\n\nCarl Sagan won a Pulitzer Prize for his book The Dragons of Eden but may be best known for his book and television series, Cosmos. His credentials include includes four degrees in physics, astronomy, and astrophysics from the University of Chicago according to NASA who refer to him as a Planetary Scientist.\n\nSagan’s Legacy\n\nSagan’s numerous scientific contributions and his penning of science fiction taught the world to embrace the possibility of life beyond earth. His numerous lectures and work in prestigious scientific institutions continues to be honored. NASA’s profile of Sagan,\n\n“In his role as a visiting scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif., Carl helped design and manage the Mariner 2 mission to Venus, the Mariner 9 and Viking 1 and Viking 2 trips to Mars; the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions to the outer solar system and the Galileo mission to Jupiter. Carl’s research helped to solve the mysteries of the high temperature of Venus (a massive greenhouse effect), the seasonal changes on Mars (windblown dust) and the reddish haze of Titan (complex organic molecules).”\n\nDedication of the Carl Sagan Center By Leslie Mullen, NASA Astrobiology Institute, November 26, 2001\n\nIn 2001, NASA dedicated a site in NASA Research Park at Moffett Field, California, Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. Cornell University founded the Carl Sagan Institute in 2015 where his search for life in the universe.\n\nCurrent Conversations\n\nCarl Sagan firmly believed in life beyond Earth and so do numerous researchers at SETI.org. In Wired magazine’s 2019 “Astronomer Explains How SETI Searches for Aliens”, Jill Tarter, Chair Emeritus for SETI Research, layouts the argument and research behind the institute’s work. Science has progressed and some of his theories may now be defunct. Relaunches of Sagan’s “Cosmos” television series titled Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey (TV Mini Series 2014) – IMDb and Cosmos: Possible Worlds (TV Mini Series 2020) – IMDb are bringing enthusiasm for understanding our universe back into our homes.\n\nRelated: NASA’s Carl Sagan Fellows to Study Extraterrestrial Worlds (2008); The Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos (Video Coverage 1999)\n\nDon’t Shy Away"
