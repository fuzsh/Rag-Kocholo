        "text": "Smith:\n\nI'd like really to start back with your birth in Brooklyn in November 1908, and ask a little bit about your family background, who your mother and father were, if they had any scientific interests, those kinds of things.\n\nAdel:\n\nAll right. As you indicated, I was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Fifth Avenue, as a matter of fact, on the 22nd of November 1908. My parents were Orthodox Jews who had emigrated with their parents, my mother from Poland, my father from Russia. I know they came when they were quite young, but I don't know how young. I don't know much about my father's parents, but my mother's father, maternal grandfather, was a distinguished calligrapher and scribe, and I venerated him and appreciated his accomplishments. Neither my mother nor my father was trained in any field, and it was therefore expedient for my father to take any work that he could find in order to support the family. He was not entirely successful in New York, and thought that things might be easier, it might be easier to find a well-paying job if he went to an industrialized city like Detroit. He never succeeded in getting into the industries themselves in Detroit, but he did the sort of merchandising that could be offered to those who did work in factories. That wasn't entirely successful, and they moved between Detroit and New York, New York and Detroit, a couple of times at least, until they finally made a permanent move to Detroit, and even then he had to do menial tasks. He knew nothing about science. My mother knew nothing about science. I had, and still have, two sisters and a brother, none of whom have gone into science in any way. My brother, for example, lives in Detroit and he has devoted himself to acquiring used heavy machinery, rebuilding it and selling it back to industry in Detroit, and apparently he's been fairly successful at that. Well, I went through the customary grade school.\n\nSmith:\n\nThis is in Detroit.\n\nAdel:\n\nIn Detroit. And from about age 10 on, I had to find some means of helping the family financially, and so I began by caddying. I remember my beginning at the Detroit Golf Club, and my beginning wage was 15 cents an hour, and if 18 holes took three hours, well, that was 45 cents. If one was fortunate and was caddying for someone who tipped, he might get another dime or 15 cents. And caddies at that time were graded on their efforts. There was a caddy card which was given to the player at the beginning of the round, and he turned it in to the caddy master at the end of the round, and the caddy was marked either excellent, good, fair or bad. I remember one person in particular for whom I caddied, Horace Rackham — he was one of the original Ford investors in Detroit, and later he contributed funds with which the Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the University of Michigan was established. He's the man. Well, I used to caddy for him occasionally. He never tipped. An immensely wealthy man, but he never tipped, and you had to knock yourself out to get a grade of fair or good. No caddy for him was ever excellent. And another person for whom I caddied was Eddie Guest, the popular poet Eddie Guest. People today don't know much about Eddie Guest, but when I was a boy his poetry was very popular. Well, then, I graduated from caddying to having a newspaper route, and also for a time I hustled newspapers on a busy street corner in Detroit. In fact, I remember where it was — Second Avenue and Grand Boulevard, I think. And that was a very tough occupation. One didn't deal; a boy who was selling newspapers on the street corner did not deal, directly with the people who published the newspaper. He dealt with an intermediary, someone who had a contract with the people putting out the paper, and then he hired a group of boys to stand on different corners. It was a very tough occupation. I grew up almost overnight in that job and acquired a second vocabulary.\n\nSmith:\n\nHow old were you?\n\nAdel:\n\nI suppose I was eleven or twelve. I know it was before high school, so I was eleven or twelve, and it was after I'd caddied for a couple of years. And I remember one day, my boss came to see how I was getting along at my street corner, and while we were there, he was approached by a prostitute. I was just a little kid and not supposed to know about these things, but I did, and I remember to this day — gee, she was a beautiful young woman, but he sent her away, and I remember he said, \"It's too much.\" She wanted five dollars and he was willing to pay three. Well, anyway, this gives you an idea of the environment in which I grew up. Oh, I remember, I had another job at a grocery store cleaning out the chicken coops. Anything to earn a few pennies. That's about what it amounted to, in order to help pay for school books, clothing, even coal with which the house was heated. And then, I graduated in '22, 1922, and I can't recall how I spent that summer, but in the autumn of '22 I entered the Cass Technical High School in Detroit. It was not really a trade school. It was one of the regular public high schools in Detroit supported by the Board of Education, and it was a marvelous school. It offered not only subjects dealing with the trades, for example mechanical arts, electrical arts, graphic arts, music, sheet metal and other trades, but it offered also all of the basic courses in liberal arts, mathematics, social studies, history, English. So it was possible to do what one could or might have done in a standard liberal arts high school, and in addition by being willing to go to school from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon, learn a trade, which is what I wanted to do. At that time — today, you know, a youngster is confronted with an almost impossible list of opportunities and possibilities. You can do this or that, study and prepare for this or that. But at that time I felt the only thing open to a young man was engineering, and particularly, since we'd always lived near railroads in Detroit, locomotive engineering. I'm sure this was the dominant thought in my mind. And so I enrolled in the mechanical arts program, a four year course, and during the four years, I'll summarize it, during the four years, I had eight semesters of mathematics. In fact, the last formal course I had at the high school was college algebra, and I remember the name of the book we used, Rietz and Crathorne. To my surprise, as a freshman at the University of Michigan — I didn't go directly from high school to the university, and I'll tell you about that in a moment — but the first course in mathematics I took at the University of Michigan was college algebra from the same book, Rietz and Crathorne. I'd already had the course. So it gives you some idea of the adequate preparation one got at Cass Technical High School. I suppose I took, in fact I know I took only the amount of English, the number of English courses I absolutely had to, and the same would have been true of geography and history and social studies.\n\nSmith:\n\nDid you do any physics?\n\nAdel:\n\nI did have a year of physics, and I remember the professor's, instructor's name: Hoyt. And I also had a year of chemistry, but I don't remember the name of the chemistry instructor. But in the course of the four years, and my emphasis on and my interest in the mechanical things, I had seven semesters of drafting, that is, mechanical drawing. That training went up to and included taking an elaborate piece of equipment and dissecting it and making detailed drawings of each part, and then a drawing showing the assembled unit. I also had several years of foundry practice, including ferrous, regular iron foundry, and non-ferrous, brass and aluminum. In fact, one of the jobs I had at the high school, continuing the theme of working as I went to school, was in the foundry, first as an assistant. It was my job after the cast iron had been poured into molds and the furnace had cooled, the cupola had cooled, to put a hood on and go inside the furnace, with all the jagged materials sticking out of the side, and chip off the slag. That was one of the things I did. I enjoyed that very much. I liked working with my hands, and I particularly liked making patterns and making the molds from the patterns and casting the molds. So that was one job I had. Another job I had in that Technical High School was keeping the lathes in the wood turning shop in order. In those days, lathes weren't built as well as they are today, I suppose, and belts kept coming off. It was my job to arrange the pulleys and things so that the belts wouldn't come off, and I don't know how successful I was in that. But anyway, I had the mechanical drawing and I had foundry practice. I had wood and metal pattern making, the patterns for foundry use, and quite a lot of machine shop practice, lathes, milling machines and so on. And so actually in the four years, I acquired a great deal of experience. I should say that I took off very slowly. In fact, I think I failed the first high school algebra course I took and had to repeat it. I just couldn't get the concepts. And then I failed the second algebra course I took and had to repeat it. But I was determined. And finally, I don't know, it's as though a cloud had cleared from my brain. Finally it began to be very apparent, certainly by the time I took the 7th or 8th semester of mathematics, the college algebra under Mr. Leonard, that I'd become very proficient. There's a story about him, which I should tell you as an example of the change that took place in me, over the course of four years in high school. At the close of the semester, there may have been a day or two left and I was about to not only finish that course but also graduate from high school — Mr. Leonard decided to conduct, to take a poll in class. There were about 35 students in the class. I remember there were about 35 people in the class, none of whom I knew really, because when I wasn't in class I was busy working, and had no opportunity to form friendships. And not only that: considering the social class from which I came, they might not have wanted to be friendly. I don't know. There were some who did show signs of friendship, but I had no time to spend with people, so I knew none of them. Mr. Leonard had us put down on a slip of paper the name of the student we thought had done the best work during this semester of college algebra. And I sat there thinking for a moment and thought, well, I'm sure I'm not going to get any votes from any of these people, they don't even know me, I don't know them, but still I've worked hard and I've been successful. I've been able to solve every problem that Mr. Leonard has assigned. He's often had me go to the board and discuss my solutions. And I think I deserve at least one vote, and I'll vote for myself. This is a very unethical thing to do, but it shows the state of mind. And I did, I voted for myself. Mr. Leonard collected the slips of paper, and counted the votes, and then he announced, the vote was unanimous. And I was terribly embarrassed, of course, because it was a dead give-away that I'd voted for myself, but I was also terribly surprised. I didn't expect them to vote for me. So it wasn't an act of conceit, but rather a realization on my part that I'd made enormous progress from my start there, the two years in which I'd failed the first two courses, to the final year of mathematics at that high school, when I was able to solve any problem in the book and do anything Mr. Leonard had asked. I didn't have enough money to enter the University of Michigan, after finishing high school, because the small sums that I had earned while in high school were just enough to get by. That reminds me — each summer, between high school years, I found factory jobs, and I remember that one summer I worked for a pharmaceutical company in a suburb of Detroit called Hamtramck. It was the summer after either my freshman or sophomore year in high school, I don't remember. Now first I'll tell you how they used to make capsules of medicine at that time. It was very much like a foundry. They had a drag, which is the lower part of a mold, with hemispherical indentations. They put a sheet of gelatinous material on that. Then they poured the medicine of the day onto that gelatinous material, took another sheet of gelatinous material, put it over the first and tacked the edges, so one had an envelope, square envelope filled with medicine. Then the upper half of the mold was brought down, the cope was brought down and it stamped out against the lower part, producing the spherical capsules filled with medicine. My job was to stand at a vat all day long and peal the capsules off of these sheets. I did that for an entire summer. And of course, one had to work fast, so there were a lot of accidents. A capsule would break and I'd be splattered with the medicine. By the end of the day I was generally covered with this medicine, and smelled like it. That was one job I had. In fact they wanted to know if I was there permanently, and I lied. I needed the work. I wasn't going to tell them, I'm going back to school in the autumn. I couldn't have gotten the job if I had. In any event, I remember there was a fellow who worked alongside me. He was older than I was, and he was one of their permanent employees. I remember he chewed tobacco, and he swallowed his cud one day, and he was choking to death. I didn't know anything about the Heimlich maneuver at that time, but I pounded him on the back and he coughed it up. It's amazing what one recalls when one begins to talk in this fashion. But anyway, there was another job I had. I worked for a short time, not very long but for a short time, at the Detroit Grey Iron Foundry. This was one summer, part of one summer. I didn't work there the entire summer. Well, I had jobs of that sort during the summers and earned enough to buy some of the clothing I needed, some of the books, and as I indicated earlier, to help buy fuel for the home.\n\nSmith:\n\nDo you recall at what stage you thought you'd go to college? Was that something that was always in your mind?\n\nAdel:\n\nIt was there at that stage. It was certainly there during my last year in high school. Quite probably it was there before that, but I can't be specific about that: but definitely during that last year. My father was opposed to my going, because it had been tradition in his family that when a son was old enough, he would help support the family. Here I was graduating from high school and he thought that it was time that I found work, found a job and contributed to the support of the family, in a larger way than I had been able to do before. So I was the first member of the family ever to go on to university. Even to this day only two others have, my brother's children. I have no children, but my brother Sid has both a son and a daughter, Mark and Barbara, and Barbara attended the University of Michigan and graduated, and Mark went, where? Wayne University perhaps, somewhere, but anyway got his degree, she in psychology and he in business, I think. But this was long after I went to the university, so I was the first in the family, and did so against great resistance. I'm quite sure my mother was in favor, but my father was very strongly opposed, but I did it anyway because I felt I had to. So, after graduating from high school — I told you something about the jobs I had while in high school — after graduating from high school, I found employment with the American Electrical Heater Co. in Detroit. I was perfectly honest with them, and explained that I needed work so that I could accumulate funds to enter the University of Michigan. Tuition I think at that time was $90 a semester, but I didn't have the $90. And I told them about my background. Now they used to manufacture electric flatirons, electric soldering irons, and electric glue pots, pots in which glue was melted. They would be used by carpenters and so on. The product line was called the American Beauty Line. As it happened, there were two engineers at the factory, a Mr. Thomas and a Mr. Lockwood, and they were both graduate electrical engineers from the University of Michigan. They had a small instrument shop, and the instrument maker was Charlie Hanson, Charles Hanson. I suppose all these people are dead now, because this was 60 years go. And I was hired to assist Charlie Hanson. If he needed a small casting made, then I would use my foundry experience and improvise a way to provide a small casting. I worked on machines, using my machine shop experience, doing the usual things that an assistant in a machine shop would do. I acquired a set of machinists' tools while I was there, purchased them, and I remember one evening after work, Charlie Hanson went with me down to an instrument shop in Detroit somewhere to help me pick out a tool box, which I still have. I still have a little office at the university. It's beneath my desk at the university, so it too is 60 years old. I've given most of the tools away since, but I did use them. In any event, I began work in '26, and then it was in '27 that Lindbergh flew the Atlantic. I remember betting about it with Mr. Lockwood, one of the two engineers. He said, \"He won't make it. “He bet a box of chocolates. I said, \"He will make it,\" and of course he did. Meanwhile, I'd gone up to the University of Michigan while I was working. I went up to Ann Arbor from Detroit, that's about 36 miles, I think, something like that, maybe 30 miles. There used to be an interurban line, a sort of glorified street car that ran between Detroit and Ann Arbor. It's no longer in existence. And I rode that up and spoke to the registrar, and told him that I wouldn't be entering until the autumn of '27, but that I wanted to major in engineering. I still was obsessed with the idea that all one could do was engineering of some sort, and probably and preferably railroad engineering. So he said, \"Well, tell me about your high school work,\" and so I did, and he said, \"Well, because it was a technical high school, you'd have to take some additional work in order to qualify for entrance to the University of Michigan,\" so I said, \"Very well, \"I'm working now, but I can go to night school,\" and so I did. Then I said, \"Would courses in metallurgy, would they satisfy the requirements?\" \"Oh yes.\" So I took two courses, one or two, I think two from a Mr. Patterson, whose father was a doctor, I remember he told us that, in metallurgy in night school. Lo and behold, when they examined my high school transcript at the University of Michigan when I entered, they said, \"This will never do. What you were deficient in was liberal arts courses, language courses, something of the sort.\" So I had to take one year of German at the University of Michigan as a freshman without credit, and I did that. Despite that, I finished at the University of Michigan, my undergraduate work, in three and a half years. Well, anyway, I entered the University of Michigan, enrolled as an engineering major, engineering of some sort, I no longer remember. Now, it was while I was working that I went up to the university and said I would want to register in engineering. I don't know if they made a record of that or not. It really didn't matter. But meanwhile I had been given some problems to solve by both Mr. Thomas and Mr. Lockwood while I was working for American Electrical Heater Co. They looked at the results and they said, \"Your interest is held much more, and your ability shows much more in mathematics than it does in engineering,\" and they said, \"We think you should change your major when you do enroll.\" And so I did; I changed it to mathematics. As a mathematics major, I remember, the first semester I took college algebra, which I had already had in high school. I took physics from Professor Rich, who has long since passed away from diabetes, and I took astronomy. I know the laboratory instructor for astronomy was Hazel Losh, and she died recently, but I can't remember at the moment the name of the man who did the lecturing in astronomy. And there was some other course, and of course gym, gymnasium, and I don't know what else. I was excused from gymnasium after a while. One day we were wrestling and I got a shoulder dislocated. It's a shoulder that has dislocated from boyhood on. But you can't simply go into the director of the gym and say, \"My shoulder dislocates and I want to be excused.\" I suppose you have to demonstrate the fact. So we were engaged in a wrestling match one day and out it came, and he had to set it. Terrible. It had been out any number of times before that. The injury began when I fell down a flight of steps as a very small boy and I think landed on my shoulder, and stretched ligaments and things so that the shoulder never really was strong after that. I had even chipped some bone, as an orthopedic surgeon recently discovered. Now, I was telling you about summer jobs that I had between semesters or years in high school. They were generally across the railroad tracks, to some factory that I was in, and I used to hop freights to get to work and hop freight trains to get back home. One day I slipped one off. I was trying to get onto a freight train going in one direction and there was one on the adjacent track, there was a freight going in the other direction, and I'm very fortunate to have escaped with my life. I slipped. I grabbed the rung on the freight car and I had a lunch pail in the other hand, and I slipped and dislocated my shoulder and fell on the road bed between the two sets of tracks. And I lay there with a dislocated shoulder. At that time it wasn't so bad but what I could set it myself. It was excruciatingly painful, but I could set it, and I got up and completed my journey. I don't know which — I was probably going home then. But anyway, I took gym but was excused from it. Then during that first semester Professor Rich, who lectured in physics, took me aside and he said, \"You know, you shouldn't be majoring in mathematics, you should be majoring in physics.\" Evidently I was doing reasonably well with the subject. It was hard work. I recall something in relation to that which might be of interest to you. I don't regard myself as being bright, but rather determined. Now in those physics courses, we were generally assigned four problems to do over the weekend. I would very often, for that first semester at least, take the interurban back from Ann Arbor to Detroit to my home. Once I got there I would spend all Saturday, all day Saturday and as a rule all day Sunday until it was time to get the interurban back to Ann Arbor, Michigan, working on those four problems. I was never satisfied until I'd solved them. It was, as I used to tell my students when I taught much later on, a valuable experience. I think that to work on something and not succeed is really not very helpful. But no matter how much more time you might have to put in on something, than someone else might have to, if you succeed in the end, it's extremely valuable. You've done something to yourself as an individual. You've rearranged circuits in your brain. You've created new circuits. You've succeeded. And so I worked terribly hard, and I always solved the problems. Eventually Professor Rich took me aside and said, \"You should be majoring in physics, not in mathematics,\" so I switched to physics. As a matter of fact, I took what was at that time enough mathematics to qualify for the PhD, and of course enough physics too, but I wrote the dissertation in physics. So I got my AB in physics.\n\nSmith:\n\nJust for the dates, you got your AB in January of 1931?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, I entered in '27, I graduated from high school in '26, worked until the summer of '27, entered the University of Michigan in '27. Then the summer of '28, which was the summer after my freshman year, I got a job as a machinist with the US Rubber Co. in Detroit. My job was working on an enormous lathe. It stretched from here to the cabinets you can see in the kitchen. I was turning out rollers for the rubber mills of the US Rubber Co. And of course, that's the year, which was the summer of '28 then, which I saved $700. I remember I worked for 50 cents an hour. It was before the Big Crash of '29. I worked for 50 cents an hour, and there was a tremendous amount of overtime. I'd work 14 hours a day, five days a week, and twelve hours on Saturday, and worked possibly eight on Sunday. I don't know, anyway, at 50 cents an hour plus overtime, I saved $700. I was living at home, so that I could save everything I earned, and that got me through my sophomore year. What I'd earned at the American Heater Co. had gotten me through my freshman year at Michigan. What I earned at US Rubber Co. got me through my sophomore year. The next summer, the summer after my sophomore year, was '29. The Crash was already on its way in full swing, but Mr. Raab, I remember his name, was the foreman of the machine shop at US Rubber, Mr. Raab knew that I would be returning to school in the fall. He said, \"There really is no place for you here but I'll take you on. There won't be any overtime,\" and there wasn't. It was still, I think, 50 cents an hour and I saved, what, $500 that summer working like that, but that got me through my junior year, and after that I had fellowships. Well, I had assistantships first, teaching laboratory classes in physics, and then fellowships, university fellowships, which paid $500 for the year. They were very difficult to come by. But Professor Randall, who was the chairman of the department of physics at the time at Michigan, got the university fellowship for me for a couple of years at least, maybe it was three but I think two. And I remember, there was one faculty member who argued against my getting it. He's dead now and I don't wish to malign him, but I remember, I was told this by someone who knew. It was Professor Goudsmit. Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit were the discoverers of the spinning electron. Now, I'd never taken any courses from him at Michigan. He was an import from Holland to Michigan, so was Uhlenbeck, and I didn't take any courses from Goudsmit. I don't know whether he was upset about that or not. But in any event, Professor Randall did get the university fellowship for me. I should point out that, just in passing, to indicate how hard I was willing to work to get an education. The first was while I was working either for US Rubber or for the Foundry Co.; US Rubber, I think. It was a long bus ride from home to the factory, and a very long bus ride home. It was generally in the evening because of all the overtime and I would invariably fall asleep on the bus going home. When I got home I'd be too tired to eat supper, and many nights, many evenings I'd turn in, go to bed without having had supper. And there was one other thing I wanted to mention. In those days, one had to take not only college algebra but trigonometry, a separate course, and analytic geometry, a separate course, and so since it was such a long ride, from home to US Rubber, I bought the trigonometry book that was being used at the University of Michigan at the time, and worked through it solving all the problems, while on the bus going to work. I was too tired to do anything on the way back in the evening. As a result they gave me credit at the university for trigonometry without having to take it. I still have that book, and it's just covered with grease. There are grease prints from my work, of course, greasy hands, all over the book. It's up at my office. I got the fellowships. I got my — now I'm ahead of the game, let me think — when did I get the fellowships? I must have had them, I know I had them when I was in graduate school; but we were talking about undergraduate, when I'd worked for US Rubber the summer of '28 and the summer of '29. Then I had assistantships. It's a little hazy. I know I graduated. I finished my work, my course work in January of '31, after three and a half years as an undergraduate. At some point, there was a transition from assistantships to the university fellowships, I don't remember exactly when, but I had them while I was a graduate student, I do know that. And so I took my AB degree with the class of '31, even though I'd finished at the end of '30 in three and a half years. Then, at the end of '30, beginning of '31, I began my graduate work. I'd already been taking some graduate courses, I remember. In fact, I took the theory of functions of a real variable and the theory of functions of a complex variable from Professor Hildebrand in mathematics, and I did that as an undergraduate. I also took some graduate courses in physics while still an undergraduate. But anyway, I went on then as a graduate student. In that day they didn't have, what do they call them, preliminary examinations. They didn't have those in that day, '31. They had a final examination, and in my case it was an oral examination. I took the necessary courses, you know, mechanics, analytical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, things of that sort — these were graduate courses that everybody took, yes. Then I went and talked with Professor Dennison, David M. Dennison, who is no longer with us either, and he was the outstanding theoretician in infrared spectroscopy worldwide, I asked Professor Dennison whether I might do my thesis work under him, and he thought about it a while, and he asked me a few questions, and then he thought I might. So he wanted me to work on my own, for, how long was it? Half a year, something of that sort. He wanted me to research a problem, and not to bother him. I selected, whether through his suggestion or my own, I don't remember, the carbon dioxide molecule, the infra-red spectrum and the molecular structure of the carbon dioxide molecule.\n\nSmith:\n\nDo you remember how you became interested in the entire area, in quantum mechanics? Was there any particular courses you'd taken that drew your attention to it?\n\nAdel:\n\nLet's see, how did that happen? The university was famous then, of course, for its summer symposia. It brought together the leading physicists from all over the world for summer symposia, Sommerfeld from Germany, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Pauli, who was the man who was famous in magnetism? I can't think of his name at the moment. Van Vleck, the American. And any number of other Europeans whose names at the moment escape me. There's a photograph. You know, not too long ago there was the 50th anniversary celebration of the American Institute of Physics, and there was a publication, was it PHYSICS TODAY or something, and it had, amongst other things, a photograph of some of the attendants at one of these summer symposia, and I was standing next to Oppenheimer in that. Just a young kid.\n\nSmith:\n\nThis was as a graduate student?\n\nAdel:\n\nAs a graduate student, yes. So you can dig up that photograph and you'll see me standing, I think I'm on Oppenheimer's right. And I think of some of the other people who came for these symposia. Oh, Bohr. Bohr was there, yes. And Krammers, surely. I didn't understand everything that was being said, or perhaps much of what was being said, but I was becoming saturated with the feeling. Quantum mechanics was not only in fashion but making tremendous strides at that time, and I knew I wanted to do something with that. Why did I get into it in the infra-red? Oh, I had a job assisting Professor Slater, who was one of the faculty in physics at Michigan, and he very often undertook work from the outside, in infra-red. He was an infra-red experimentalist, and he needed an assistant, and I worked for him. That's one of the ways in which I was brought into infra-red spectroscopy.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo you solved problems like —\n\nAdel:\n\nNo, experimental work. Experimental work. I actually never took a course in infra-red spectroscopy. It's strange, but I never did, nor in atomic spectroscopy. Goudsmit, the man I referred to earlier, taught the atomic spectroscopy, and he may be the reason I didn't take a course in it. But it is surprising that I didn't take a course in experimental infra-red or in infra-red spectroscopy. I don't believe such a course was taught. The principal experimentalists in infra-red there were Barker, Ernest F. Barker, professor of physics, Harrison M. Randall, the chairman of the physics department, and Professor Slater. Who else worked in that field? It doesn't matter. These are the principal ones. And that leads to something you'll notice, you may have noticed or will in the future if you look for it, in Bill Sinton's paper about the history of infra-red spectroscopy. He thinks one of the contributions made by Michigan was the training that people like John Strong and I got from Randall and Barker. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I learned nothing from Randall or Barker. I never went to them for help. See, infra-red spectroscopy was largely a manual dexterity sort of thing. It fit in extremely well with the training that I had at Cass Technical High School, where I'd learned to work with my hands. Infra-red spectrometers in those days could not be purchased. They had to be made. They were homemade. Well, I could do this sort of thing. And I could improve upon the spectrometers that others had made. They were just large boxes that they'd put together with a grating or a prism and mirrors or prism and grating, and I felt very much at home in that field. I was comfortable with the equipment. I could make some of it. I could design what I couldn't make and needed to have someone else build. I could work with it, once it was put together. And because of the training that I had at the high school and in the shops where I'd worked later, and because of my own nature and my own tendencies and inclinations, I developed, for want of a better word, a fastidiousness, a neatness, an exactness. I could never work in a crummy laboratory. Everything had to be picked up and so on and in place and properly adjusted and working well. This was an advantage I had, if one can speak of it as an advantage, over purely academic people in the field who had not had the kind of training I'd had at that Technical High School. Most of the people in infra-red spectroscopy had never worked with equipment or things of that sort. They would realize the essential nature of a prism or a grating, but they might not put things together as carefully as they should. They might not take as much care in building the amplifiers and the spectrometers and such, and in making the measurements. I remember the remark that Professor Barker made to me when I succeeded first time in measuring the width of the absorption line. This was during World War II when I returned to Michigan; Bill Sinton talks about it a little. Nothing like that had ever been done at Michigan, or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, because it required exquisite technique. I don't take credit for innovation or brilliance in this matter, but it took the most meticulous care. It took using an infra-red grating, grazing incidence, it took having everything in tiptop shape. Anyway, I succeeded in doing it. Now Professor Dennison, I remember, had along with Uhlenbeck asked me to work on that problem because a radar had been built which wasn't working. When I told him I thought I'd succeeded, Professor Dennison said, \"Well, I'd like to see. May I come down?\" So he came down and watched me run through a number of lines. And he said, \"You know, I thought I'd never live to see the day.\" So I was glad that he did see it. But what I began to tell you was that Professor Barker then said to me, after I'd succeeded when no one else ever had, he said, \"You know, I could have done that.\" Well, he couldn't have, because his technique was too sloppy. If he'd had good technique, there was nothing magical in what I'd done. If he'd applied himself to see that everything was in perfect adjustment and done a little mathematics to find out how to get the best resolution, he could have done it, of course. Any of them could have done it, but they didn't. What I'm trying to highlight here is the advantage that I think accrued to me as a result of having had certain training prior to going into infra-red spectroscopy. But as to how I got into it, there was the assistantship work with Slater, who was doing outside jobs. There was also the fact that the laboratory — which was known as the Randall Laboratory of Physics — but anyway, its forte was infra-red spectroscopy. That's what the University of Michigan physics laboratory was known for.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo you're imbibing this in the atmosphere, in a way?\n\nAdel:\n\nThat's right. Yes, here I was at a laboratory where virtually everything that was done in the graduate school had something to do with infra-red, so why wouldn't I choose that? So I began work under Professor Dennison. As I said for a half year I was on my own, and then I showed him the results of what I'd done. The carbon dioxide molecule was of great interest because amongst many others there are two energy levels in particular, two vibrations of the carbon dioxide molecule, one of which is almost twice the frequency of the other. So there is opportunity there for a resonance interactions. Now Fermi used to come to the summer session symposia also, and it was Professor Fermi who first picked up on this resonance phenomenon in the carbon dioxide molecule. The frequency ν1 was just about twice the frequency of the vibration ν2, and he did some analytical work showing how small disturbances would perturb the molecule and split the energy levels a little bit, and it's called the Fermi Resonance Phenomenon, I think. Now, was he the first? No, I think even before Fermi, Teller, famous for his hydrogen bomb work and his fight with Oppenheimer, Teller and another Hungarian, he was still in Hungary at this time, and another Hungarian by the name of Tiza I think, Teller and Tiza published a paper on the resonance phenomenon in the carbon dioxide molecule. And then Fermi did some, and I think it was Teller and Tiza first and Fermi later. He did some work on it, and it sounded like not all the bands, not all of the important absorption bands of carbon dioxide had yet been observed, and the energy system had not yet been worked out, so I thought that would be an interesting problem.\n\nSmith:\n\nDid you ever discuss this with Fermi at the summer school?\n\nAdel:\n\nI discussed it with Teller and I mentioned it to Fermi too, yes. They didn't have anything to say, except, you know, here they were prominent theoretical and experimental physicists and I was just a kid working on these things. They acknowledged it. But much later I did have lunch with Teller. They brought him in as a scientist to address an honor group at Northern Arizona University, and I was invited and placed next to Teller, so we had an interesting conversation during the lunch period. He invited me to send some of my work, when I told him about a problem that I was working on. But I didn't bring up the carbon dioxide. This was just comparatively recently, five or six years ago, many many years after I'd done the carbon dioxide work. So I don't know whether the carbon dioxide suggestion was Professor Dennison's, it might well have been, or whether I mentioned it. It really didn't matter. It was a problem that awaited solution. Some work had already been done on it by Teller and Tiza and by Fermi, and the people at Michigan had picked up some of the carbon dioxide bands. But as I said, there were many bands yet that remained to be found in the laboratory, and the energy level diagram had yet to be worked out. So it was agreed I would work on that.\n\nSmith:\n\nThis is when you went away for six months on your own, you worked on the carbon dioxide molecule at that time?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, I was, but not experimentally. In fact, the thesis wasn't an experimental thesis, as it turned out. When I began to get theoretical results, I would pass them on to a Chinese graduate student there at the time, he was from China, Ta Yu Wu. He's back in China, I think, and he's brilliant. He's a brilliant theoretical person, but he was interested then in experimental work too, so whenever I found as I was doing my dissertation work that I could predict new bands, I would tell him about it, and he'd go down and pick them up. So yes, I was away during that half year period, just on my own. It might have been just the summer, I don't know, but I think it was the half year, and Professor Dennison didn't want to be bothered. I came up with some theoretical work; some formulae that I'd developed that I thought would apply to the carbon dioxide molecule, and particularly to the interaction between rotation and vibration. A molecule not only vibrates in various ways but it rotates, if you think of the classical quantum mechanical picture of a molecule, and the two modes of motion interact. Each interferes with the other. That's right, that's the thing I worked on during that period during which I was sequestered from Professor Dennison, and I came up with some very elaborate complicated expressions, describing the interaction. I know that after that Professor Dennison asked me to give a colloquium. We used to have Tuesday afternoon colloquia. A colloquium at which Uhlenbeck was present, and the entire faculty, in fact. I remember, as I was talking about these complicated expressions and putting them on the blackboard, I saw Professor Uhlenbeck look at Professor Dennison, and the feeling I had was, that he didn't see the, I don't know what it was, the solvability or the feasibility or something in what I'd done. It was too theoretical. And I think that I remember Professor Dennison smiling, not to me but to Professor Uhlenbeck. But anyway, I came back down to earth then when I began to work. I made some use of this material in connection with the vibration-rotation interaction later on in my dissertation. But for that moment I set it aside began. I wish I had my thesis here. I don't. I've given it to someone at the university. Anyway, I began working. I set aside the vibration-rotation interaction and began working just with the vibrational spectrum of the carbon dioxide molecule. I succeeded in working out the energy level diagram. Now in fact it was just at that time that Adams and Dunham at Mt. Wilson Observatory had put carbon dioxide into a very long tube, and duplicated the bands that they had found in the spectrum of Venus. They'd found absorption bands in the spectrum of Venus. They didn't know what they were, but they used a very long absorption cell filled with carbon dioxide and picked up these bands. So they knew then that the gas on Venus that was producing these bands was carbon dioxide, but they didn't know which transitions. I'd developed the energy level diagram of carbon dioxide well enough so I could tell them: well, these bands that you've picked up are 5ν3 and 5ν3 plus ν1 and 2ν2. The reason for the plus ν1 and 2ν2 is again that the vibrational frequency ν1 in the molecule was almost exactly equal to twice the vibrational frequency ν2. That's the thing that Teller and Tiza and Fermi and then later Dennison and I worked on. And that appears in my thesis, the identification of the energy levels corresponding to the bands that Adams and Dunham had picked up to discover CO2 in the atmosphere of Venus.\n\nSmith:\n\nDo you recall how you heard about Adam and Dunham's work? Was that through the astronomy people at Michigan?\n\nAdel:\n\nWell, of course, they published in the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL and I may very well have seen it there for the first time. I had a very good friend in the department of astronomy, Ohren Mohler. He died about a year or two ago. Ohren Mohler was at one time chairman of the department of astronomy at Michigan, and was a professor there for many years. He and I got our degrees at just about the same time, he in astronomy and I in physics. We were good friends, and he may very well have told me. He kept in touch with what I was doing, and he knew everything that I had done at Lowell, for example, though of course what I did at Lowell was much later. But Ohren may have known. I don't know. I honestly don't remember how I first learned about it, either by seeing it in the literature or someone in astronomy telling me about it, or perhaps Adams and Dunham may even have written to the University of Michigan, to the physics laboratory about it, because they knew of course of the prowess of the university in infra-red. It may have happened that way. I think it probably did. I think they may well have written, because Barker knew about it, knew about their work. That's right: Barker knew about their work. So that's how that happened. But in any case, I then completed my dissertation work. Working on the energy level diagram I was of course in a position to predict the positions of a lot of bands that had not yet been observed, upper level bands, bands that begin in absorption, not in the ground state but at upper energy levels and go to still higher ones. One finds some of those in many planetary spectra. You won't find them in the spectrum of Venus, because the Venus spectrum hasn't yet been examined at those wavelengths, but one finds such bands in the photographic region of the spectra of the giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and there are some in Venus if one ever observes it that far. As I got it, I gave this information then to Ta Yu Wu, and he'd run down to the lab and pick up the bands. So it was really exciting and fun for quite a while. And then I got my degree in '33, had the oral examination.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo that's I guess just a bit over two years?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, that's right, formally just two years. Formally two years. I received my AB with the class of '31 and got my PhD in '33. I'm not sure that I was as well informed as I should have been as a physicist at that time, but it had been a long hard grind, combination of schooling and work all the time, and I was anxious to get out. And I'm not sure that I could really have absorbed a great deal more even if I had spent more time, formally in graduate school. Now as it turned out, '33 was the very depth, summer of '33 was the very depth of the Depression, and there were no jobs. Oh, there as an occasional job. A colleague of mine who got his degree the same year, Norman Wright (he's now retired in Florida, I can give you his address if you want it) he was the department favorite. He did his work under Professor Randall, his PhD work, and Professor Randall thought very highly of him, took him under his wing. Professor Randall's daughter was very fond of him. Anyway, when a job opened up at the Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Michigan, Norman Wright got the job. Some of the other graduates were kept in mind for academic positions, teaching positions, teaching and research, when such things opened up. They were very few and far between. I know one of them, Lester Earls, who's retired from Iowa State University or the University of Iowa, one or the other. He was professor of physics. Back when he first graduated Professor Randall kept in touch with him, and when a job opened up at either Iowa State or the University of Iowa, he saw to it that Lester, who was teaching at some small school in the Deep South, was given the opportunity to interview for that job and Lester got the job. But somehow, it may have been the time, nothing was open when I needed work, beginning in June of '33. However, the people at Lowell (it may have been Roger Lowell Putnam, the trustee, either he or V. M. Slipher, and I suspect it was Roger, I'm not sure) wrote to the University of Michigan to say that they were interested in finding someone with infra-red training who could apply himself to astronomical problems. The situation was, as Henry (Giclas) may have told you, that there were the three old men out here, V. M. Slipher, C. O. Lampland and E. C. Slipher, who hadn't done anything in years, and hadn't done any research, hadn't published and weren't going to apparently. Roger Lowell Putnam wanted to return the observatory to an active life, as it were, and I must give him credit for realizing that infra-red astronomy was opening up as a new field, and a very useful and productive field. He or someone at his behest wrote to the leading infra-red laboratory in the world, addressed I suppose to Professor Randall, though I never saw the letter. If it wasn't written directly to Professor Dennison it was certainly called to his attention, and then he told me about the opportunity. Now for some reason it was thought that V. M. Slipher would be at a June joint meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the American Physical Society at Salt Lake City. So Professor Dennison suggested that I send in a title based on my thesis, carbon dioxide molecule and its application to the planet Venus, and that I talk about that at the meeting. And so I did. I had no money for transportation, and so Professor Dennison loaned me $100 at no interest to be paid back whenever I found employment at $10 a month or something. And I remember Catharine, with whom I was going at the time, bought me a suitcase. I think it was made out of paper. You know those are probably no longer available, those old rectangular things. And it was my first trip west of Michigan, and I went out to Salt Lake City and it turned out that V. M. Slipher wasn't there. That was the state of affairs at the Lowell Observatory at that time. They were so damned relaxed, you know. They felt that they had no responsibilities toward anybody or anything. I wasn't even notified he wasn't going to be there, though we'd been led to believe that he would be there. But I presented my paper. I remember, Serge Korff — he's the permanent secretary of the Explorers Club in New York City, and he's still there; he's in his eighties but I think he's still active — he was at the meeting, and he took me under his wing, and when I finished my talk I remember him saying to me, and this was 54 years ago, I remember him saying to me, \"That sounded as if you'd memorized it.\" Well, I didn't admit to him that I had, but in fact I had, because I had at that time still, and for some time to come, great difficulty in being extemporaneous. So I returned to Ann Arbor, and I can't remember how — I was indignant, of course, but there was nothing I could do about it. Here I was $100 in debt, and except for having had the trip, I had nothing to show for it. Somehow, and I honestly don't know how — I told Professor Dennison, of course, and whether he found out, or whether I wrote or called Lowell, I don't know, but we learned that V. M. Slipher indeed had been in England at that time, receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his work on the planets, and well deserved too,[1] and that he would be returning by way of Chicago, returning to Flagstaff by way of Chicago, for two reasons. I knew of only one at the time but Henry has since told me of another. First, Roger Lowell Putnam, the sole trustee who was operating the Package Machinery Co., Springfield, Massachusetts, would be exhibiting his products at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1933, June of '33. Second Henry has told me since that David Slipher, V. M.'s son, was working at the Fair that summer, so V. M. stopped to see both Putnam and David, and it was agreed that I would meet with them during V. M. Slipher's visit, with Roger Lowell Putnam and V. M. Slipher. However they didn't tell me where they were at the World's Fair, and it took me a long time to find them, but I finally did run them down. There was a Physical Society meeting going on in Chicago at that time also, and I remember asking the secretary, whose name I can't recall at the moment, he was secretary for a great many years, if he would announce the fact that I was looking for V. M. Slipher and Roger Lowell Putnam. They had nothing to do with the meeting, but I was desperate. And I don't know whether he did or not. He was unhappy about it. I don't think he did announce it. But I finally did find them, and we sat down at a little table out of doors somewhere, and V. M. didn't have much to say, but Putnam talked. He said he wanted to have some research done at the observatory in infra-red. He didn't say that the other men weren't doing anything. He didn't tell me that until much later. He wanted to know something about my qualifications, whether I had any ideas and what I would do if I had the opportunity, and I told him about the equipment I would need. \"Well,\" he said, \"we don't have money to buy anything like that, but we might be able to build some things.\" And he said, he seemed to think that perhaps I could be useful to them. He said, however, that the university would have to pay for everything virtually, provide the laboratory. It was to be a one year contract. He wanted me to do the work at Michigan, they were to provide the laboratory space, all the raw materials, an instrument maker, a glass blower, and an office, and pay for the cost of publications, everything, and the Lowell Observatory would then give me $500 for the year's work. Now, I should have mentioned that even before I got my PhD, because I was — I had only the university fellowship, which paid $500, and I was courting Catharine at the time, I worked as a dish washer.\n\nSmith:\n\nThis is when you were working on your PhD?\n\nAdel:\n\nWorking on my PhD. I worked as a dish washer at the Lincoln Cafe, the corner of State and Packard in Ann Arbor, and all I got for it was my meals. So at the meeting I told Mr. Putnam, \"I've no money and I'm working as a dish washer to keep body and soul together.\" I didn't tell him I'm in debt for my room and in debt for some clothes that I'd purchased because I was going with Catharine. I didn't tell him that, but I said, \"I'm washing dishes to keep body and soul together, but I still won't do what you want for $500. However, if you double it, I will, $1000.\" He said, \"OK.\" And I should have inserted that Professor Randall, chairman of physics, who knew I was going out for the interview, said that any arrangement \"which is acceptable to you will be acceptable to the physics department and to the University of Michigan,\" and I thought that was wonderful. So when I returned from Chicago and I reported to both Professor Dennison and Professor Randall, and indeed perhaps to Professor Randall first, I told him, I got as far as the $500, and he exploded. I never got a chance to tell him that I'd insisted they double it to a thousand. He said, \"Why wouldn't $300 have been enough?\" Can you imagine that? Things were that bad. But of course the people for whom he was getting academic jobs, or jobs at universities, they weren't working for $300 or $500 or $1000, they were getting a lot more, maybe $2000 or $3000 but it was a lot more than $500. So I never quite understood why he felt that I should have settled for $300. I had a PhD. I'd already published a couple of papers. But anyway, I told Professor Dennison that it was $1000. And I had a free hand, an absolutely free hand in the physics department. They let me build the first, I think, of the really very long high pressure absorption cells. It was 22 1/2 meters long. Moreover, the source was at one end, with a mirror at the other, so the light was actually reflected back through the absorption cell, and that made the path length 45 meters, and I introduced gas up to pressures of more than 40 atmospheres. So I had tremendously long path lengths. It was clear, what I was trying to do was get enough gas together so that I could duplicate the spectra of the giant planets.\n\nSmith:\n\nI think I've got a picture of the apparatus, from the PHYSICAL REVIEW, Vol. 46, page 903, figure 3[2] has the apparatus there.\n\nAdel:\n\nThat's it. That's the first thing I did. What I was trying to do is duplicate these spectra. These are spectra that V. M. Slipher obtained, and it's a remarkable achievement, and he did that early on in the century, and I think it's mainly for this that he got the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. So I thought, well, as the first problem, I'll try to duplicate those spectra. Since Jupiter occupies a volume more than 1300 times that of the earth, and has an enormous atmosphere, I'm obviously going to need a lot of gas. So I built this. I had the instrument maker build this absorption cell for me. I designed it and had him build it, and I remember, I used a Hilgar E1 spectrograph. When I got plates I could see that they were indeed duplicating the planetary spectra that V. M. Slipher had obtained. Oh, first of all, before I go on, I should say Rupert Wildt, who was then at Princeton or Yale, one of the two, had done some research using an absorption cell not nearly as long as the one I built, a rather small absorption cell, as it turned out. He discovered that he could identify a couple of the bands in V. M. Slipher's spectra with methane and ammonia, so he's the discoverer actually of the fact that the atmospheres of the giants contain methane and ammonia. Well, I went on from there. He had identified only two bands, and there must be a hundred bands there, whatever it is, I enumerated in my paper. I decided that if I'm going to duplicate these bands, I have to accumulate a lot of gas, get a lot of gas together and a very long high pressure absorption cell. So I built that. And then as I got the plates and saw that I was duplicating the bands, I sent the plates out here to Slipher. I should have kept that correspondence. I'm sorry; I don't know where it is. But I remember him writing back to say that he was excited and impressed to see how much the spectra I was getting looked like the ones he had got. He said, in fact they had exactly the same kind of diffuseness in the absorption bands, the same relative intensities, all that sort of thing. And recently — well, recently, three or four years ago — Bill Baum, the director of the planetary center at the observatory, asked me what had become of those plates. And I said, \"Well, I sent them all to V. M. Slipher, and he wrote back about them. I know he got them, and he was impressed with the appearance.\" But the plates are nowhere to be found at the Lowell Observatory, and I think that's too bad. I took hundreds of plates, because I filled that long absorption cell with methane, with carbon dioxide, each time removing the gas that had been in there, and with ammonia. Ammonia liquefies at a pressure of, I've forgotten, something like seven atmospheres perhaps, but anyway, as much ammonia as I could get into the absorption cell, and each time I filled the cell, I took numerous spectra, and sent these to V. M. Slipher. I examined them myself, of course, and knew that I was actually getting the bands that appeared in his planetary spectra. I sent them to him for inspection. At that time, I was using pressures as high as 40 or 45 atmospheres, and the steel that we were using for the absorption cell, steel or an iron alloy of some sort, developed pinhole leaks, so that I had to take time out to repair those leaks. When the leaks developed, of course, there was cooling due to the expansion of the escaping gas, and when there is a temperature difference of that sort in a gas path, then the index of refraction changes and the light takes the most marvelous and circuitous paths through the absorption cell. But however marvelous, it wasn't very useful for getting spectra, so fixing that took time. But in any case, at the same time I began to work on the theoretical aspects of the problem, fitting all of these bands into an energy level diagram, which is also in that PHYSICAL REVIEW paper. Do you have it?\n\nSmith:\n\nThat's right; we have the energy level diagrams on page 905.\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, that's right. Yes, that was the culmination of that first effort for the Lowell Observatory, the first experiment, building the absorption cell, duplicating the spectra as they appeared in V. M. Slipher's spectra of the planets, and working out the energy level diagram.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo when you put the gas into the cell, then in effect you were trying different amounts of gas, sort of trial and error?\n\nAdel:\n\nDifferent amounts. I wasn't trying to duplicate the intensities that he observed in the planetary spectra, just the bands themselves. If I found a band, I didn't care whether it was as strong as one that he had recorded or not quite as strong. I knew I had the band. For example, there's a band, if I still remember, it's 4860Å, which Menzel thought was due to hydrogen. As it turns out, it's due to a very high harmonic of a methane vibration, and I think it must be listed in that energy level diagram. I know it's listed in that energy level diagram. Maybe I even mention it specifically. It doesn't really matter. 4860Å? Yes.\n\nSmith:\n\nWhich I think you find in Uranus and Neptune.\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, that's right. Yes, Neptune, because there's more methane available for absorption in Uranus and Neptune than there is in Jupiter and Saturn. The ammonia has pretty well condensed out in Uranus and Neptune. But in any case, to encapsulate that first experiment, that first problem that I attempted for the Lowell Observatory was to duplicate the spectra experimentally and then work out the energy level diagrams theoretically, and I did that. And Henry Norris Russell, who was the dean of American astronomers, I remember remarked on it to V. M. Slipher, or possibly he did this in print, but he told the people out here also, he said, \"That was a tour de force,\" the fact that I'd gone through that entire spectrum and showed that virtually everything there was due to methane, a little of it due to ammonia. It didn't mean that I had discovered the methane and ammonia. Wildt did that. But Wildt, on a visit out here, told E. C. Slipher, as a matter of fact, that the origin of the absorption bands in V. M. Slipher's spectra of the giant planets wouldn't have been known except for my work. Well, I told you what Professor Russell said, and then another person who was impressed was an astronomer by the name of Atkinson. He wrote a book on Uranus. Robert Atkinson. There's a reference to it. Did I give you a copy of a paper written by Monica Joseph?[3]\n\nSmith:\n\nYes, I have that.\n\nAdel:\n\nWell, there's a reference in there to it. She found it, I think, that reference. But in any case, the people at Lowell and Roger Lowell Putnam were exceedingly pleased with that work, as well they should have been. It turned out, I had to send, if one looks through the literature, this is only a rough sort of an impression I have — I had to write a small letter or a manuscript for publication almost every month in order to get my paycheck of 80 some dollars. See, the checks went from Springfield, Massachusetts, Roger Lowell Putnam's establishment, to the Lowell Observatory, and then V. M. Slipher had to detach 80 some dollars of that and send it to me at Ann Arbor. I had a devil of a time collecting those, and I found that if I sent something for publication, it helped. In fact, V. M. Slipher skipped one payment and it took me about a year to recover it, but anyway.\n\nSmith:\n\nI was also wondering about the authorship of the papers. I wonder what Slipher's contribution was?\n\nAdel:\n\nNothing. I had to put the names of V. M. Slipher and Lampland on many of my papers.\n\nSmith:\n\nBecause you were using in effect the spectra that Slipher had —\n\nAdel:\n\nBut that was published.\n\nSmith:\n\nYou could have gone to the journals and —\n\nAdel:\n\n— that's right, I did. He didn't give me any unpublished data.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo there's no real reason to put his name, except for the fact of keeping your paycheck coming?\n\nAdel:\n\nThat's right. That and keeping my job. I had to do that, and neither he nor Lampland nor E. C. Slipher, none of them really knew what I was doing, had a real understanding of it.\n\nSmith:\n\nWhat the quantum mechanics was —\n\nAdel:\n\nOh no, no. They didn't know anything about infra-red spectroscopy. They didn't know anything about spectroscopy. They really didn't know anything about this work that I was doing, or the work I did in Ann Arbor. Yes, that's what we're talking about, the work I did in Ann Arbor. In fact, when I was in Ann Arbor I didn't know there was such a person as Lampland or E. C. Slipher. I knew only about V. M. Slipher. But it was expedient for me to add their names. I'm inclined to do that in any case. I can't say they stood over me with a hammer. It was a little more subtle than that. But I'm inclined to do that. Now, at Michigan I did things like that. When was the first one ever to measure the width of an absorption line, Barker had nothing to do with that, but I put his name on it. I was using the laboratory that he in a sense had control of, and so I added his name to the paper. I've done that many times. But it was a little more pointed here, because I knew the older people didn't want me out here, and I'll come to that presently. There was some of this even when I was in Ann Arbor doing these things, the original far infra-red spectroscopy of the sun and the earth's atmosphere, and published papers in the PHYSICAL REVIEW and the Astrophysical Journal which showed a lot of deep absorption lines; the spectra had quite a different appearance but they agree with the spectra I got here at Lowell later. I even put V. M. Slipher's name on that. As you say, it helped to get the checks. OK, then, they were so pleased with the work that they offered me a contract for a second year. There was never anything in writing, just a verbal contract, and Mr. Putnam said they would increase the salary to $1200. That was $100 a month up from $80 (a thousand dollars a year) and I said, all right, because I had other ideas I wanted to try. It was at that point that I wanted to start investigating the far infra-red spectrum of the earth's atmosphere. It had been done as well as could be by Langley and Abbott and F. E. Fowle, but they were way off in their wavelengths, and the location of their absorption bands. They didn't show absorption bands crisply. They showed no fine structure. There was no grating work. They had done some prism work with a rock salt prism, but it wasn't satisfactory. I knew that should be repeated, and then I knew that there should be a grating spectrum. There was one problem. The Randall Physics Laboratory is a building that's four stories above ground, and three stories below ground, and all the infra-red spectrometers were in the second and third sub-basements, and there was no way of getting solar radiation into that without punching a hole in the wall. Now Professor Barker was chairman at the time I think, he succeeded Randall, or maybe Randall was still chairman, I don't know. But I asked Professor Barker, who was sort of in charge of the infra-red, if I might have a hole punched through at the second or third sub-basement level. That would mean drilling down and then knocking a hole of about 15 inches in diameter in what was then a fairly new building, and I was surprised that I was given permission. He said, \"Of course, go ahead.\" I'd already completed this long absorption cell. Maybe he was impressed with that too, I don't know. But I got permission to do that. That meant establishing a mirror device, high up on the building, to capture the rays of solar radiation and then direct them down to a mirror placed outside this hole, and to send them through the hole into the laboratory with the infra-red spectrometers. So I had the instrument shop of the physics department build this heliostat. It wasn't a celostat, it was a heliostat. It rotated at the rate of once every 24 hours and it actually rotated the image of the sun that it produced for that matter. When I built equipment to do that kind of work out here at the university, N.A.U., I designed and had a built celostat that rotates, has a period of 48 hours and does not rotate the image. In any event, at that time I had a heliostat built. I had a hole punched through the wall I think at the second sub-basement level, had optics made that carried the radiation from this heliostat to a mirror outside the hole, through the hole in the wall to mirrors inside the laboratory and ultimately to a prism infra-red spectrometer. The first thing I wanted to do was duplicate what Langley had done, and the work I did in the beginning was pretty rough. there's some of it published in the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL, maybe some in the PHYSICAL REVIEW. But I knew that I was on the right track and I could see at once that Langley had made a number of mistakes in positioning the bands, in saying where they were. The most important band that they had mislabeled was the ozone band at 9.6 microns. Well, I went on and did what I could with the Michigan equipment. I can't remember the order in which I did it, but I know I did both prismatic work and grating work, and the grating work at those wavelengths is something that no one had ever done before. And I published all of that. I published both the prismatic work and the grating work.\n\nSmith:\n\nThere's one paper from the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL[4] in '36, where you're looking at the interval from 77,000 to 110,000 angstroms, and there you were talking about the winter of '34, '35 and summer of '35, you looked first with low resolving power, then high resolving power, starting off with a prism.\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, the prism was the low, the grating was the high. Now, if it was published in '36 — see, I took up residence out here in the summer of'36, September of '36, but that's from the title that you gave me, I would say that's work I'd done at Ann Arbor.\n\nSmith:\n\nYes, the paper is dated July, '36, which I guess is just before you arrived here?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, that's right. That's right. So I made the beginnings of my work in both the prismatic field and the grating field while still at Ann Arbor. Oh, and then, toward the end of the academic year, '34, '35, it was in the summer or spring of '35 —\n\nSmith:\n\nYou've got the year at Johns Hopkins too.\n\nAdel:\n\nThat's right; I was going to tell you that. The end of '35, academic year '35, I hadn't heard from the people at Lowell or from Roger Lowell Putnam. This is the second year on the Lowell contract.\n\nSmith:\n\nThe verbal contract, you hadn't anything in writing.\n\nAdel:\n\nThat's right. No, nothing in writing, but I was finishing the second year of the verbal contract, coming to the end of the second year, exactly, and I needed to know what lay ahead in the way of employment. The people at Lowell had said nothing. It turns out, they assumed that I would continue working for them and that I would even move to Flagstaff to the Lowell Observatory, but no one had bothered to tell me that, you see. And meanwhile Professor Dennison told me, he said, \"Now, there's a fellowship available, a post-doctoral fellowship available under Gerhard Dieke at Johns Hopkins University.\" I guess it was Rockefeller money and it would pay $1500, I think. Professor Dieke at that time was working on the hydrogen spectrum. Well, that's atomic spectroscopy and I knew very little about atomic spectroscopy, but I thought I might be helpful, and so since there'd been no offer from Lowell for another year's work, I decided to accept the offer through Professor Dennison from Gerhard Dieke. Catharine and I had been going together for two or three years by that time, and I said to her, \"I'll be going to Baltimore to the Johns Hopkins University, shall we get married so you can go with me?\" And that was perhaps not much of a proposal, but she said yes, and so we got married and we went to Baltimore. I then learned that the people at Lowell were exceedingly unhappy; Slipher I think was under the gun from Putnum, and Putnam was terribly unhappy, that I had interrupted the work for the Lowell Observatory and decided to spend a year at Johns Hopkins. They said they would give me leave of absence, but they were very unhappy about giving me a leave of absence for that year. Well, as it turned out, I think the observatory gained by it. I was supposed to work for Dieke, and I spent as much time as I could, I did what I could, for Dieke. As it turned out I don't think it was very much. But when Dieke couldn't use me I spent as much time as I could in good conscience with the late Professor Pfund, Alfred Pfund of Johns Hopkins, probably the leading experimental infra-red spectroscopist in the world, and the discoverer of the Pfund series in the hydrogen spectrum. So I learned a lot from him that I later used when I came out here to Lowell to live. He made some filters for me, for example, that I later used out here. So it wasn't a wasted year for the Lowell Observatory. It was a good year for them.\n\nSmith:\n\nYou were developing experimental techniques?\n\nAdel:\n\nDeveloping experimental techniques (filter techniques for the elimination of stray radiation) that I would use here, but not with the time that I was obligated to spend for Professor Dieke. He was after all paying for my post-doctoral fellowship, and I did what I could for him. I remember a very embarrassing incident that occurred while I was working for Dicke. I was at a large comparator measuring the positions, lines in the spectrum of hydrogen, and a guest was brought in to my room as a visitor to the laboratory. They were showing him what was being done at Johns Hopkins in physics, and they didn't introduce me, they didn't tell me who he was, and I didn't know, so I explained to him how a comparator worked, and I offended him deeply. It turned out, it was Professor Percy Bridgman of Harvard, the high pressure physicist who experimented with very high pressures, and so, I couldn't have done more to offend him, I guess. But in any event I measured lines in spectra that Dieke had obtained. I didn't get the spectra. He had gotten them. I was then supposed to do something with analyzing them, and I never did do a great deal with analyzing them because I didn't know enough about atomic spectroscopy. But for me, the year at Johns Hopkins was a very profitable one, and I did in all seriousness and good conscience do as much as I could to help Professor Dieke. Oh, he was very nice about it. He knew that I'd just got married, and he thought I could use added income, so he arranged for me to teach the night course in astronomy. For that course we used a small telescope they had on campus. They may still have it, I don't know.\n\nSmith:\n\nI think that was taken down a while ago.\n\nAdel:\n\nSo we used that, and I taught astronomy for that year, and that was my first course. I had assisted in laboratories at Michigan but this was my first experience lecturing, and it was a difficult experience. I worked hard at it. I think the students got something out of it, possibly an erroneous idea or two also. One of my students was Joseph Ashbrook: it was the first course in astronomy he'd ever taken. Joe Ashbrook later became the editor of SKY AND TELESCOPE, so apparently I didn't completely destroy his interest in astronomy because he went on and did very well.\n\nSmith:\n\nSo this was developing your fluency as an extemporaneous speaker also?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, exactly. However, I got a more thorough workout in that regard when during the war, I found myself, after the first half of 1942, back at the University of Michigan, and I'll tell you about that. So the year at Johns Hopkins came to an end, and I was waiting to hear from V. M. Slipher, since apparently they wanted me to come out here to Lowell. I was waiting for him to tell me to come out, and I wrote him. He was so busy with I suppose his real estate and other interests, furniture store, that he wasn't a good correspondent, but finally I got him to say that I should expect to begin work out here the 1st of September of 1936. I'm not sure that anything was said about the salary, and I can't remember exactly what it turned out to be. However, it wasn't much, roughly $1500 a year, something like that, plus bare bone living quarters, and I'll tell you more about those. So I spent the summer in Ann Arbor taking some courses in astronomy from Dean McLaughlin, professor of astronomy. He's dead now. And then we drove out, Catharine and I, and we were accompanied by her sister Dorothy, as we crossed the country, and arrived here in Flagstaff the 28th or 29th of August, 1936.\n\nSmith:\n\nWas this the first time you'd been to Flagstaff?\n\nAdel:\n\nNo. I'd forgotten about that and I'm glad you brought that up at this point. They were evidently so pleased with the work I'd done for them at Ann Arbor that they brought me out there. It sometime during the second year of my work for Lowell at Michigan. I think V. M. Slipher wanted to expose me to the other senior staff members, wanted me to be seen by them, perhaps he and Putnam had been talking about my coming out here to work, I don't know. So they invited me out and said they'd pay my railway fare. So I came out for a brief visit, and Lampland took me, where did he take me? He took me to Meteor Crater. He may have taken me to the Grand Canyon, I don't remember, but he took me to Meteor Crater. I also met E. C. Slipher, and looked around the observatory, and of course, I was carefully looked over by Lampland and E. C. Slipher and looked over again by V. M. Slipher, and I think I even met Mrs. V. M. Slipher, with whom I became fast friends after a while. And I didn't spend any time with the men at the telescopes at night. I'm trying to remember exactly what I did do. I remember Lampland asked me questions about puzzles, and I'm not good at that sort of thing. I resented being asked, you know, questions of that sort, and I know I didn't answer many of them correctly. He might have told me a little about his infra-red work on the planet Mars, work he and Coblentz had done, and perhaps asked me whether I would be able to make measurements that would help him correct for water vapor in the earth's atmosphere, things of that sort, and I'm sure I told him I thought I could. But as I recall, it was essentially a visit in which we looked each other over, and no work of any kind was done. And then I returned to Ann Arbor. They didn't tell me at that time that they wanted me to continue working for them; otherwise I wouldn't have accepted the post-doctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins. So after the year at Johns Hopkins, we arrived. I spent the summer in Ann Arbor, and Dieke may even have let me out a little early, because I think I'd exhausted what I could do for him. We then arrived in Flagstaff, Catharine, Dorothy and I, 28th or 29th (it was a Sunday, so we can pin down the date) of August, 1936, and I found out where Mars Hill was. I'd forgotten exactly where it was from my first visit. Then we located V. M. Slipher's house, and he was home, as it turned out, and when I identified myself I'm not sure he remembered me, and told him that I'd come to work. He said, \"What, are you here already?\" I was due to begin work the 1st of September and this was Sunday the 28th or 29th of August, which shows again how relaxed and in a sense irresponsible they were. He had promised me a furnished apartment, amongst other things, and when he finally got over the shock of my being there, he said, \"Well, I don't have any place to put you.\" I said, \"What about the furnished apartment that you promised?\" \"Well, I don't have one.\" I don't know whether he thought he was going to put me in a furnished apartment in property he owned or the observatory, but in any case, he said he had nothing, but he said, \"There is a room on the second floor of the administration building, the west end, where the young men were going to display transparencies.\" The \"young men\"' were V. M. Slipher and C. O. Lampland and E. C. Slipher, they were young in Lowell's day, when the young men decided they needed a new building, Percival Lowell said he would go along, they could have one, he'd pay for it, provided one large room was set aside for him in which to display transparencies of the planets. So this was the room, on the west end of the second floor of the administration building, that was set aside for that purpose, and V. M. Slipher said to the three of us, \"Let's go up there.\" So Catharine, Dorothy and I went up, and it was a room that had been built for Percival Lowell, but which he had never got to use. In fact, the area for the display of transparencies hadn't even been completed. Wires were hanging out and so on. The astronomers had used this room as a place to store junk that their wives no longer wanted, so in this room there was an old broken down bedstead with rusty springs, no mattress. Are you old enough to have seen the large round oak dining room tables? Circular, very large, with spaces for additional leaves? There was one of those that had broken down, that was stored there. There was a couch, a studio couch. The upholstery, the stuffing was coming out of it. And then there was the fireplace and some fireplace tools. This was the \"furnished apartment\". Catharine held herself in check until he left, and then she burst into tears. While I had come from not precisely a poverty stricken home but one of very limited means, and we had only the necessities ever, she came from a reasonably well-to-do family, and had been accustomed to the finer things. So I could understand her reaction. And then her sister Dorothy said to her, \"Catharine, look at those beautiful fireplace tools,\" in an attempt to cheer her up. (I've just reached the point, Cathy, where we'd just got into the apartment, the big room. Can you remember where we lived while we ordered furniture for that big room? At Lowell? Did we live in a motel?)\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nWe lived there.\n\nAdel:\n\nIn what? There was that old rusty bedstead and the couch with the stuffing coming out, and the round table, that's right (crosstalk)\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nAnd then there was a little table in the kitchen with white chairs.\n\nAdel:\n\nWas there? You remember that?\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nWe lived there.\n\nAdel:\n\nUntil the Sears and Roebuck furniture came, OK. Then I can continue here. So my head of course was filled with thoughts of, what am I going to do to get started working? I was concerned about the living quarters but there wasn't much I could do about it. So V. M. Slipher left us then, and apparently we did live there until furniture that we ordered from Sears Roebuck came. Across the hall from the large room was a very tiny room, the one that Catharine just mentioned, which had a table and some white chairs, I'd forgotten all about that. It had a sheepherder's stove in it, one of these little truncated conical things that a sheepherder would use in his camp. And there was no hot water, no running hot water. Was there a sink in that room? I don't know. Catharine can tell us whether there was a sink there. And that was it. Then down the hall — see, this was the large room and then across the hall, this little room, and down the hall, what seemed like a quarter of a mile but it was very far down the hall, was another set of rooms. Oh, Cathy, was there a sink in that kitchen?\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nYes.\n\nAdel:\n\nThere was. OK.\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nThere was a little table, and there was sort of a cupboard, open cupboard, then don't you remember, the long cupboard was —\n\nAdel:\n\nIn the little room next door; that was Percival Lowell's pantry. It was a pantry, that's right, and the old sheepherder's stove, OK.\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nThere was a little four burner stove. But you know, a conventional wood cooking stove has a firebox, and then it has a provision whereby the hot air from that firebox goes under the oven, you know, and then up and out —\n\nAdel:\n\nThen flows across the top.\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nBut this didn't have anything going underneath, the fire box was here, and it went over the top of the oven and out the chimney, so there was no heat at the bottom of the oven.\n\nAdel:\n\nJust a sheep herder's stove. In any case —\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nSo you can imagine, what it took to bake something.\n\nAdel:\n\nDown the hall was a room that we could use as a bedroom. Visiting astronomers had used that. I remember Henry Giclas, I think told me that he'd used it. Bill Shaw of Cornell University who used to come out to do astronomy, he used it. And we were told that we could have that as a bedroom. Right next to it was a bathroom with a tub. And that's where Catharine had to do her wash, wash clothes. Also, since there was no running hot water, if we wanted to both bathe on the same day, she would bathe first and I would bathe using the same water. I'd spend half a day heating the water on that little stove. We bought a copper wash boiler and we heated water in that on that stove, and I built a small cart to hold wood, and put it on casters, and we put the hot water boiler on that filled with hot water and rolled it down the hall, emptied it into the bath tub and then in succession bathed in that. But with the furniture we ordered, Katherine made a very delightful living space and place out of the rooms that had been given to us. But we had no stove. Winter was coming. We had no stove for the large room. We had no way to keep warm.\n\nMrs. Adel:\n\nWe had the fireplace.\n\nAdel:\n\nI told him about the fireplace. And that autumn, it was October, V. M. Slipher and Emma, his wife, went back by Santa Fe train to the old homestead in Indiana that he had come from, and I suppose Emma must have asked him, between Flagstaff and Albuquerque, what we were going to do to keep warm. It was the bitterest October I've known in Flagstaff. And he probably said to her, I'm just guessing but he probably said he hadn't even thought of it. So he dropped a postcard in the mail in Albuquerque, didn't bother to telephone, dropped a postcard in the mail in Albuquerque to his brother E. C. Slipher, and said, \"You take Dr. Adel down to Waldhouse's second hand furniture store and pick out a stove like the one in the kitchen.\" I knew then that there was going to be trouble. Such a stove would be totally incapable of heating that enormous room, and I didn't want another stove like that. So I went down to Waldhouse's with E. C. Slipher, and sure enough, there was a stove down there, second hand, just like the sheep herder's stove we had in the kitchen, and it was $5. E. C. said, \"Now, this is the kind of stove my brother wants you to have,\" and I said, \"Nothing doing.\" Equipment was being built for me by Stanley Sykes, the instrument maker in the shop at that time, and we'd invested a lot of time here, but I was ready to pick up and leave. I said, \"If we can't have a better stove than that, I'm not staying.\" He said, \"All right, but my brother Ves won't like it.\" I said, \"I don't care whether he likes it or not.\" There was an old Victoria type stove, square cross section, large, tall and big in breadth and depth with a great fire box. I said, \"That's what I want,\" and he said, \"But that's $10,\" I said, \"Well, I'm sorry, but that's the stove I want, and if I can't have it, I won't stay.\" So he said, \"All right,\" and he repeated, \"My brother Ves won't like it.\" We got that stove and that kept us warm as toast. We could put logs in there at bedtime and they'd go all night long and the place would be toasty warm in the morning. So that was the state of affairs. Now, I didn't know how bad the situation was until the following spring. Roger Lowell Putnam came out for a visit to the observatory, spring of '37, and when V. M. Slipher learned that Putnam was coming out, he immediately went down to his furniture store in Flagstaff and had a modern wood burning kitchen range sent up for our kitchen. I still remember the colors. Wasn't it in cream color and green? Yes, with a warming oven and everything. They took the sheep herder's stove out and disposed of it and put this new stove in, so that Roger Lowell Putnam would see the style that we were living in. And when he came, we invited him to dinner. I had no complaints. I wasn't going to complain to him about anything. He came to dinner. I can't remember what we served but it was a good dinner. After dinner, this was in our apartment in the administration building, he asked, \"how have you been treated?\" And I wondered why he asked, because it had been rough. For example, while I was waiting for my equipment to be built by Stanley Sykes, the instrument maker. I was permitted the use of the 24 inch refractor. That's the one that Lowell did most of his work with. And V. M. allowed me to put the spectrograph on, the one that he'd got the spectra of the planets with, and even the grating, a little grating, a Brashear grating, and I immediately turned it to Venus. I used new photographic plates that Eastman was making, MP and Q plates, I think. These plates had to be hypersensitized with ammonia and one thing and another, and then they became sensitive out to about a micron or so, one mu. So with this equipment, the first thing I did was pick up the bands, the carbon dioxide bands in the spectrum of Venus that Adams and Dunham had discovered at the Mt. Wilson Observatory years before, which meant that V. M. Slipher could have done that. He could have made the discovery of carbon dioxide in Venus at the Lowell Observatory. Well, I didn't pay particular attention to that; it didn't mean anything to me. I was naive enough not to realize how offended he would be if this was called to the attention of somebody, and I inadvertently called it to the attention of people. Dunham came for a visit to Lowell in '37, Theodore Dunham, and I was foolish enough to mention it. I did it out of enthusiasm, not to show anyone up, not to say anything about myself but simply out of enthusiasm. I told him that I had photographed the carbon dioxide bands that he and Adams had discovered in the spectrum of Venus, and I showed him the plates. V. M. was present, unfortunately, when I told Dunham this. After that, I was not permitted the use of any of the telescopes on the Hill. I thought that was bad, and it was. However, I didn't realize how bad things were until Mr. Putnam, following dinner, asked how we had been treated, and I wondered why. He then said, \"Because I put you in here over the heads of the old men.\" Then it all became clear to me. It was apparent to me, they really didn't want me, and they'd have been delighted if they'd found some way to get me out, but I was doing work that was too useful, and it was breaking ground. It was bringing attention to the observatory. It was really the beginnings, I think, of modern infra-red astronomy.\n\nSmith:\n\nPutnam was endeavoring to try to bring the observatory up to date?\n\nAdel:\n\nYes, precisely, he told me just that. He said, \"These people aren't doing anything. Now, there are observatories where they insist that everything be 100 percent right. I'd settle for work that's 90 percent right and published.\" And my work, I think, was more than 90 percent right, and it was published. So he told me, he was very pleased with the work that I was doing here and he hoped I'd stay. By that time, some of the equipment that Sykes was building for me, I don't remember the exact dates, was beginning to come on line. The first instrument he completed for me was a little prism spectrometer, rock salt prism spectrometer, the base. It's the one that's on display today in the rotunda. I don't know that you've seen it, have you? You should look at it before you go. It's in the rotunda. That's the instrument he completed first. Lampland supplied the rock salt prism, and then I was on my own. Oh, I needed a laboratory, of course, and there were no laboratories available for me. However, there was an old junk room, Henry can confirm this, there was an old junk room in the basement on the northeast corner of the administration building. In addition to rats which used it as a home, it was filled with junk. Just any equipment that astronomers wanted to discard they put in there. I was told I could have that room, but of course I'd have to have access to the sun, and so it was agreed that a hole would be cut through the roof of the building and all the way down into that basement room. That was done, and I cleaned up the room, and there were two parts to it. There were two rooms there actually, a south room and a north room. I put the prism spectrometer that Sykes had completed in the south room, on some kind of sewer pipe that Lampland had got for me. He was very helpful that way. When I needed something on which to mount the spectrometer, he got the sewer pipe and he also got some discarded switchboard plates that the electricity company in town had discarded, and we put the prism spectrometer on that. We brought the solar radiation down through pipes that had been installed in holes that had been cut into the building. Each day I would determine the amount of water vapor in the earth's atmosphere, using a technique that Fowle of Smithsonian had developed, and I would also record the near infra-red spectrum of the earth's atmosphere, using the sun as a source. That would run from perhaps 6/10 of a micron out to 3 1/2 microns, something like that. And then I would also observe the far infra-red spectrum of the sun out to 14 microns, from about 4 1/2 out to — 5 1/2 perhaps — then from 5 1/2 out to 14, the limit of transmission. This was before the 20 micron window had been discovered. I accumulated these spectra, and I did a number of things with them. First of all, I demonstrated which absorptions were present, that is, the absorptions produced by the gases in the earth's atmosphere. I located the big ozone band at 9.6 microns correctly. It was off by 10,000 angstrom units, by an entire micron, if I remember correctly, and I put it in its right position. I used those spectra to discover nitrous oxide in the earth's atmosphere. I found a new band and ultimately identified it as nitrous oxide, and again Lampland was helpful there. When I needed nitrous oxide, he went to the hospital (it's used as an anesthetic) he went to the hospital and got me a little bottle of nitrous oxide that I could use. I also made the first observation ever in that 5 1/2 to 14 micron spectrum of heavy water in the earth's atmosphere, HDO, deuterium hydroxide. In other words, it was the first, and I think I say so somewhere, either in the literature or in some of the accounts of my work that have been prepared since, I say that it's the first definitive rock salt prismatics solar spectrum out to 14 microns, and that's true. It's the very first one that defined the spectrum. The earlier attempts by Langley and Abbot and Fowle were very crude by comparison, and were characterized by error in location of the features. They didn't know where the spectrum ended. They didn't know where the bands really were situated and so on. So I was pleased with that. Oh, also I should say that before I did all that work, while I was waiting for the equipment to be built, and when I was denied further use of the telescopic equipment, there was nothing for me to do but some theoretical work. I decided, on the basis of my observations of the CO2 bands in Venus but especially on the basis of published, Adams and Dunham observations, that I would make a theoretical determination of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above the reflecting layer of the planet Venus. No one had done that. There's an enormous amount of carbon dioxide on Venus, probably a hundred times as much as we have in total atmosphere here on the earth, but the CO2 bands are developed in a portion of the atmosphere close to the top. The light from the sun goes down only so far. It's such a turbid atmosphere, it goes down only so far before it's scattered back out into space, some of it coming back to the earth. So I knew I couldn't determine the amount of carbon dioxide in the total atmosphere. However, I could determine it at least in the layer which developed the absorption bands, and so I worked, it was quite a long problem, and I published the results. It involved determining the electric moment in the vibrating carbon dioxide molecule and from that determining the quantum mechanical probabilities for the transition from one state to another, in order finally to determine the intensity of absorption bands. I think it was published in the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL. But at any rate, when I completed the paper as best I could, I submitted it to V. M. Slipher. He didn't understand a word of it. Neither did Lampland or E. C. Slipher. But V. M. Slipher said, \"Now, Bernice, Henry's wife, Bernice Giclas, she was good in mathematics, and she was a high school teacher, and I'll just show her the paper.\" Oh, he showed it to his wife Emma too, and she corrected one word — didn't correct it, I think what I had there to begin with was correct — it was the difference between got and gotten, or something of that sort. Anyway, after showing it to Emma for English, he showed it to Bernice for the mathematics and physics, and of course there were six-fold integrals in it, you know, not triple integrals but sextuple integrals, all sorts of things of that sort. It didn't mean anything to her. So then he said, \"Send it to Professor Dennison before you send it in to the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL for publication,\" so I sent it to Professor Dennison, and he wrote back after he read it. He said, \"I think that's about as well as one can do at the present time.\" I showed the letter to Dr. Slipher and then I sent it to the ASTROPHYSICAL and they published it. So that's in further explanation of how I filled my time between when we got here to the unfurnished apartment, before the equipment that Sykes was building for me was ready. And I think I've gone through essentially the main things that I did with that equipment. Oh, I did one thing of real importance, two other things with that prismatic equipment. I got the first infra-red emission spectrum of the moon out to 14 microns, which was the first one that demonstrated that the moon radiates as a black body. And also, to mount with that prism instrument, I had an absorption cell built, nothing like the one I used at Ann Arbor, but one a couple of meters long perhaps, it may still be at the observatory. Into it I introduced methane first and ammonia or vice versa, carbon dioxide, and ran far infra-red spectra. See, at Michigan I'd done only the photographic region with the Hilger spectrograph, but with this little infra-red prism spectrometer and this absorption cell, I got absorption of methane and ammonia out to 14 microns. I published it, anyway, and however far it was, the Russians got hold of it. I remember reading an account in a paper one of them wrote in a Russian journal, translated into English. The gist of his remarks was, he was convinced that the spectra were authentic. They looked good to him, this Russian, and I know they were authentic, and they showed absorption spectra one would get (perhaps somebody has got them by now, I don't know) in the spectra of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, if he could go out farther into the infra-red. So those were the main things I think I did with that instrument. I got the first definitive rock salt prismatic spectrum, solar telluric spectrum; the spectrum of the moon, that was the first to show that the moon radiated as a black body; discovered nitrous oxide in the earth's atmosphere; and discovered heavy water in the earth's atmosphere. Urey's the one who discovered heavy water. Everyone knows that. But this was the first spectrographic evidence that deuterium hydroxide's in the earth's atmosphere. Then I turned my attention to a grating spectrometer. This might be a good time to break for lunch, or shall we go on until 1?\n\nSmith:\n\nMaybe just one shor"
