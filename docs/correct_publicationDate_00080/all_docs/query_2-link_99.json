This is not a discussion board, but is a kind of compendium of research in the field which will be helpful to interested RF members who wish stay abreast of what is a quickly-developing research programme.\n\nForum Promotional Material\n\nWe often get people coming to the forum and their initial post contains some kind of personal promotional material, such as a link to a blog they wrote or a Youtube channel that they run. While maintaining that this is a forum for substantive philosophical discussion and not one for posting personal promotional material, it would be a shame to turn away those who are genuinely interested in discussion and are simply naive to the fact that what their doing is bad-mannered. This is a board for sharing your website, Youtube channel, blog, etc."
