Robert Lepage is one of Canada's foremost theatre authors and directors. His company, Ex Machina, has toured to international acclaim and he has lent his talents to areas as diverse as opera, film, solo performance, and installation art. His most celebrated work blends through collaborative and multimedia theatricality, and through acute personal narratives with bold global themes. This book is the first to combine: an overview of the key phases in Lepage's life and career an examination of the issues and questions pertinent to his work a discussion of The Dragons' Trilogy as a paradigm of his working methods a variety of practical exercises designed to give an insight into Lepage's creative process. As a first step towards critical understanding, and as an initial exploration before going on to further, primary research, Routledge Performance Practitioners are unbeatable value for today's student.
