        "text": "1. Film Studies -- Oh, Yeah Canada! Week Ten Canadian Auteurs and National Cinema Feature: You decide\n\n2. National Cinema, a crash course “ Canada’s tradition grew out of an institution and a socialist-minded idea, nurtured by the “National Film Board” of showing Canadians honest reflections of themselves. The American, or Hollywood, film tradition began as a collective dream in the minds of several Jewish immigrants who were possessed by a desire to create pure fantasy and to reinvent the American Dream as an accessible, if entirely ethereal, ideal.” From Weird Sex and Snowshoes, Katherine Monk\n\n3. National Cinema, a crash course In “National Cinema” theoretical perspective, we look for common motifs and patterns of meaning that explore the Canadian identity. … the risk in this is it might obscure diversity by leading to attempts to under-represent Canadian film that that does not conform to a pre-conceived notion of what Canadian identity. ( Giannetti 328) That’s why we also look at Canadian film under the lens of the “Auteur Theory.” (Authorship as artistic expression.)\n\n4. Motifs of Canadian Film (from Katherine Monk, Weird Sex and Snowshoes ) . Morality, Passion, Survival. “Creative non-victimhood.” (Monk 26) Weird Sex, Snowscapes, Vast Landscapes, Survival guilt, (did I say weird/disfunctional sex?), Orphans, Fragmented narratives, Pluralism, Passive heroes, Potent women, Outsider stance. Plus … being “Rooted in Realism.” (Plus … we see the “usual suspects.”)\n\n5. Styles and Types (Modes) of Films REALISM CLASSICISM FORMALISM Documentary F I C T I O N Avant-Garde Has Anyone Here Seen Canada Blinkety Blink Mon Oncle Antoine Men With Brooms waydowntown NB. These are not airtight categories and often overlap. styles Types (modes)\n\n6. Zacharias Kanuk — Auteur . What do we know about Zacharias Kanuk? From imdb. Developed love of movies watching 16mm John Wayne films on Saturday nights at the local community center. Grew up in a sodhouse, one of six children of parents who hunted with dog sled and took care of the house in a 400-year-old survival culture devoid of money. Learned English beginning at age 9 when the Canadian government forced indigenous tribal children like him to attend parochial school, in Igloolik, the ancient locale of Atanarjuat. Has never shot film--only shoots digital video. He says the only training in filmmaking he has ever received was when he was shown how to recharge the battery on his camera.\n\n7. Aboriginal Mythologies and Expression Myths embody the common ideals and aspirations of a civilization. According to Carl Jung, myths were developed to help societies deal with natural life processes through fictional intervention. (Monk says) native mythology has more to teach us about our current reality, and about Canadian film, because women and the landscape are both central motifs. (Watch for these motifs.)
