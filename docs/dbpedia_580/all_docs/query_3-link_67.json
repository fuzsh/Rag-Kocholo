        "text": "“We quickly find ourselves with a phenomenal amount of leads, ideas and images to process. So, my first task is to direct the flow of ideas and information. I’m not trying to impose my vision, but rather to create a fertile ground where video, costumes, music, scenography and all the other components of the show can cohabit and inspire each other.” – Robert Lepage\n\nThis September, I am thrilled to spend two weeks observing the early creation of of the new multi-disciplinary circus work, Arène (Working Title) by Robert Lepage, Ex Machina, and FLIP Fabrique in Quebec City (Canada).\n\nThe first of a two-part professional development residency – from early creation to application and production – this is a singular chance to observe and learn from the processes and practices of a internationally renown artist and two leading companies of different approaches and disciplines, of a different Canadian culture, and whose work has greatly inspired the philosophies of my own.\n\nUnder the direction of Robert Lepage, Ex Machina creates, produces and presents multidisciplinary artistic works, most often predominantly theatrical. Twenty permanent employees and a hundred artisans, designers, authors, performers and technicians from Quebec City and its surroundings work each year on the creations of Ex Machina. These works have been seen by millions of people around the world.

FLIP Fabrique, with all its passion and audacity, promises to make it a unique circus event.” – Robert Lepage, director, Ex Machina"
