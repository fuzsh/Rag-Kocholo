        "text": "Quebec actor and director Robert Lepage is said to be working on a new touring show for Cirque du Soleil, set to launch in 2010.\n\nThe collaboration would mark the second time Lepage has teamed up with the Montreal-based circus troupe, according to a report in the La Presse newspaper.\n\nNeither Lepage nor Cirque du Soleil would verify the report.\n\n\"We have not yet announced our projects for 2010,\" said Cirque spokeswoman Chantal Côté.\n\n\"When the project will be confirmed, we will announce.\"\n\nLepage created the $220-million production Ka for the circus company, which opened in 2004. It's still playing at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nThe 50-year-old director is considered a theatrical wunderkind, having staged everything from dramas to opera and musical theatre.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Lepage founded a multidisciplinary production company called Ex Machina and worked on the operas Erwartung and Bluebeard's Castle for the Canadian Opera Company.\n\nHis films include Le Confessional, Le Polygraphe and Possible Worlds, while his theatre productions include The Seven Streams of the River Ota, The Dragons' Trilogy and The Far Side of the Moon.\n\nHis most recent project is the Berlioz opera The Damnation of Faust, which premieres at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on Nov. 7.\n\nThis summer, he staged a projection to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his hometown, Québec City,\n\nThe Image Mill was described as the biggest outdoor architectural projection ever made.\n\nDuring a 40-minute presentation, a series of tableaux celebrates four centuries of the city's development and its residents."
