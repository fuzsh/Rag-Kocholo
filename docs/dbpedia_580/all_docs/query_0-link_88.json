        "text": "MUCH ADO IN TBILISI\n\nThe recent sacking of Robert Sturua, artistic director of the National Theatre of Georgia, cast a long shadow over the Tbilisi International Festival of Theatre, writes Mark Brown\n\nAs I arrived in Tbilisi, the beautiful capital city of Georgia, on Wednesday evening, I knew that (as a member of the executive committee of the International Association of Theatre Critics) I was walking into something of a political storm. In mid-August, Robert Sturua (pictured), the internationally acclaimed artistic director of the Rustaveli National Theatre of Georgia, was sacked by the Georgian minister of culture, Nikoloz Rurua, on a charge of xenophobia.\n\nSturua’s dismissal related to a comment he made to a tabloid journalist about the president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, in May of this year. An outspoken critic of the government, Sturua commented that it was possible that Saakashvili did not love Georgia because he was actually (despite his Georgian name) of Armenian descent. It was, without question, a reprehensible comment; but one which the director’s friends and supporters (such as actors Vanessa Redgrave and Alan Rickman, and theatre producer Thelma Holt) insisted reflected, not an underlying xenophobia, but, rather, renowned provocateur Sturua’s frustration with Saakashvili (who the director believes to have been hiding his Armenian heritage).\n\nIt was in this somewhat febrile context that my IATC colleagues and I attended Thursday night’s performance of Sturua’s production of Georgian dramatist Tamaz Chiladze’s new play The Hunting Season, after which we were to meet with the director himself. When we met Sturua backstage after the show, we found him defiant. He had, he said, been sacked because of his political criticisms of the government. There was, he continued, no question of him being Armenophobic; indeed, he had great respect for the immense contribution made by Armenians to Georgian culture over centuries.\n\nHowever, I was still troubled by the comment he made back in May. I pressed him on the matter. Did he, on reflection, believe that he could have phrased his criticism of Saakashvili in a better way? Did he regret saying what he said? He nodded vigorously. Yes, he regretted the language he used. He harbours no xenophobic feelings towards Armenians or anybody else.\n\nHaving arrived at the theatre deeply worried about our meeting with Sturua (would his established distaste for “political correctness” extend to defending his comment, come hell or high water?), I left mightily relieved. If, in a short meeting, the IATC executive could get from Sturua a statement of regret and a clear assertion of his opposition to Armenophobia, how could the Georgian government not have come to such an agreement with him in the three months which passed between his notorious statement and his sacking? That question is posed by the statement of support for Sturua which the IATC released on Friday.\n\nAll of which, as political scandals in the arts tend to do, made the work on stage seem almost incidental. In the end, Chiladze’s play (a modishly postmodern, obliquely metaphorical drama of the personal and the political) did little to enthuse. Georgia, America and the world unfold from within the life of a Georgian actress, apparently haunted in her flat. Disney’s Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is juxtaposed, uncomfortably (and almost frivolously), with images of the bodies of Nazi Holocaust victims being shovelled into mass graves. When Prince Charming arrives, not with a glass slipper, but a training shoe, it comes as no surprise.\n\nNone of which detracts from the superb acting (which is typical of Georgian theatre), or, indeed, the sweeping vision of Sturua’s production. Nor does it detract from the extraordinary achievement of this, the third Tbilisi International Festival of Theatre, which has – political controversy aside – deservedly established itself as a major event in the world theatre calendar.\n\nThis article was originally published in the Sunday Herald on October 2, 2011\n\nThe IATC statement on Robert Sturua’s dismissal can be found at: http://www.aict-iatc.org/aict-5.html\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nBehind the in-your-face attitude of Slovenian theatre:\n\nMark Brown travels to the festival in Maribor:\n\nTravelling through the tranquil, verdant valleys of Slovenia from the capital, Ljubljana, to the second city, Maribor (which is set to be European Capital of Culture in 2012), one could be forgiven for expecting the Borstnik Theatre Festival – an annual event, which has just celebrated its 45th edition – to be a sedate affair. Indeed, Maribor itself – a beautiful, remarkably quiet little city, full of picture-postcard Habsburg architecture – lulls one into what turns out to be a viciously false sense of security. Although Slovenia – population two million, member of the EU since 2004 – seems like the very image of central European gentility, its theatre has a tendency to aggression.\n\nTypical of the self-consciously “experimental” strand in the country’s theatre is Ivica Buljan’s Ma & Al, a devised work in which two actors, representing a dysfunctional heterosexual couple, crash three monologues (including work by JD Salinger) into an insufferable 75 minutes of pseudo-punk drama. Apparently drinking real booze (they offer some to various audience members), they soon descend into fake domestic violence and rape. Actor Marko Mandi then proceeds, seemingly drunk, to scream texts into a microphone, before climbing, on the backs of chairs, over the heads of the audience.\n\nThe writer-director claims to have created a “new fictive world” in which many and varied subjects – from the death of a child, to the Vietnam War, to “the relationship between classic and modern theatre” – are explored. What it is, however, is hollow, pretentious and outdated (like Dadaism turned sour). Consequently, I’m not sorry that I missed Being Ignacij Borstnik, the other show starring Mandi, in which the actor masturbates, defecates and drinks his own sweat to, by all accounts, no significant purpose whatsoever.\n\nWhich is not to say that the Slovenian theatre in Maribor was made up entirely of puerile posturing. The company of the National Theatre of Maribor itself offered a polished, professional and, initially, creatively humorous take on one of Brecht’s duller plays, the satire A Respectable Wedding (the Marxist equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel). The comedy continued with When I Was Dead, by the National Theatre of Ljubljana, a partly cross-dressed, slightly modernised staging of a silent movie by the prolific, early-20th-century German filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch. A reasonably accomplished piece of vaudevillian slapstick, it was a modest offering as part of the festival’s competition programme.\n\nThe nearest I found to genuinely innovative theatre in Maribor was Manifest K by Sebastjan Horvat’s EPI Centre. Taking The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engelsas its inspiration, the piece begins with a group of glamorous young women guiding the audience through the process of signing individual contracts (we are to give our labour to the theatre company for the duration of the show, for which we will be paid the princely sum of €5).\n\nWhat follows combines the personal (we have small, intimate encounters with strangers) and the political (we form a production line making sandwiches). In the end the property clause of our contract kicks in, with Horvat in the role of a malevolent anti-materialist (part-Marx, part-Satan). Objects of personal value are procured from the audience, which the tooled-up Horvat reserves the right to sell back to us or to destroy.\n\nManifest K drives its point home a little too polemically, but it has sparks of originality. Besides, I can now boast that I am one of very few people in Scotland who owns a copy of the Communist Manifesto in Slovene.\n\nThis article was originally published in the Sunday Herald on 15 November 2010\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nFaust sells his soul in Siberia:\n\nMark Brown visits the Academia International Theatre Festival in Omsk:\n\nWhen it became known that I was going to Siberia, some theatre practitioners in Scotland must have thought their prayers had been answered. Much as I hate to disappoint, however, after a week at the Academia International Theatre Festival in Omsk, I have come back.\n\nOmsk is – contrary to the Western perception of Siberia as a place of perpetual winter – pleasantly warm in September, with the autumn leaves a beautiful mixture of browns, intense yellows and startlingly bright reds. Once home to the great writer Fyodor Dostoevsky (who was sentenced to penal servitude in Siberia by the Czarist regime in 1849), the city has a population of just over a million people and is the meeting place of two rivers, the Om and the mighty Irtysh (which flows from the mountains of China, through Kazakhstan and down into the plains of Siberia).\n\nLed by artistic director Olga Nikiforova, and supported by the government of the Omsk Region, the Academia festival is held bi-annually and began only in 2008. It has already developed a reputation as a significant part of the international theatre circuit, attracting this year such names as the Berliner Ensemble, La Comédie-Française, Stary Teatr (from Krakow, Poland) and acclaimed Lithuanian director Oskaras Koršunovas.\n\nTaking in half of the two-week programme, I was fortunate to see the Berliner Ensemble’s bold and imaginative piece Gretchen’s Faust (pictured), based upon Faust by Goethe. Performed on and around a long table in the grand hall of the Vrubel Museum (one of Omsk’s many handsome municipal buildings), this production finds the eponymous doctor wearing an Andy Warhol wig and bursting into hectoring rhetoric as if he is Adolf Hitler.\n\nHere Martin Wuttke (who both directs the piece and plays the title role), surrounds Faust with a chorus of strident, cocaine-snorting waitresses. True to Goethe’s story, a black poodle appears and proceeds, of course, to bark loudly over Faust’s speech. However, in Wuttke’s existentialist version of the drama, the doctor finds the demonic spirit of Mephistopheles not in the dog, but in his frantic, chain-smoking self.\n\nIn Wuttke’s extraordinary, frenzied performance, Faust is, by turns, a detestable egotist and a vulnerable child. The remarkable chorus multiplies the female sacrifice of the play, giving the piece a powerful feminist aspect.\n\nLess consistent, but impressive in certain moments, is Shakespeare Laboratory, a series of vignettes presented by the Bolshoi Puppet Theatre of St Petersburg. A collectively devised piece, involving more human action than puppetry, this show involves simply too many ideas and (with a cast of 19) too many performers.\n\nThat said, one of the production’s two directors, Yana Tumina, is a longstanding member of superb St Petersburg theatre company Akhe (frequent visitors to the Edinburgh Fringe and The Arches in Glasgow), and her influence is evident in its stronger images. Ophelia, from Hamlet, places a dripping wet, black mask over her face. Lady Macbeth, her naked back to the audience, pulls a white shirt from steaming hot water, before placing a blood-red hand upon the garment. Akhe’s theatre of object and image illuminates an uneven presentation.\n\nThere were memorable images, too, in Michał Borczuch’s Werther (based upon Goethe’s novel The Sorrows Of Young Werther) for Krakow’s Stary Teatr. Krzysztof Zarzecki’s modern-day Werther is tortured emotionally and psychologically not by one woman (as in Goethe’s tale), but by three-in-one. As his beloved Lotte triples his pain, a premonitory cloud hangs over designer Katarzyna Borkowska’s witty and adaptable set.\n\nNow a note to Edinburgh International Festival director Jonathan Mills; if you’re considering bringing the work of Lithuanian director Oskaras Koršunovas to Scotland, I suggest that you try before you buy. Although, by all accounts, some of his productions are superb, the Romeo And Juliet he brought to Omsk is truly rotten.\n\nPlayed on a horribly inflexible metal set – representing the kitchens of the rival Montagues and Capulets – the piece descends into repetitive, heavy-handed metaphor (the covering of an actor’s face with flour repeatedly represents death). Add the most adolescent sexual comedy (like a Carry On film in Shakespeare’s Verona) and some truly lamentable acting, and one can’t help but be astonished by Koršunovas’s misplaced pride in a terribly misconceived piece of theatre.\n\nFinally to the beautiful Omsk State Drama Theatre where the Omsk State Academic Drama Theatre (try saying that after several excellent Siberian vodkas!) is performing a Russian classic, Alexander Ostrovsky’s Late Love. Ostrovsky’s contemplations of human relations tortured by money matters and inequality has, my Russian friends tell me, created new interest in his theatre in post-Soviet Russia. However, although brilliantly acted, this faithful presentation of a work of pre-Chekhovian domestic realism seemed dated and somewhat tired in the midst of an often exciting international festival.\n\nThis article was originally published in the Sunday Herald on 4 October 2010\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nWhen Hamlet stalked the stages of Almada:\n\nMark Brown immerses himself in Portugal’s leading theatre festival:\n\nThe small Portuguese city of Almada, which sits on the south bank of the great River Tagus, seems like a picture of modest urbanism. Certainly, its unremarkable 20th-century tenement blocks can’t compare with the decaying, colonial grandeur and romantic, Moorish streets of Portugal’s beautiful capital city, Lisbon, on the opposite bank.\n\nHowever, despite its seeming normality, Almada boasts the most important international theatre festival in the country. With the financial support of the municipality – which is led by the city’s longstanding mayor, Maria Emília Neto de Sousa, a member of the Portuguese Communist Party – this remarkable festival, which presents work in theatres in both Almada and across the river in Lisbon, might be considered an experiment in municipal socialism.\n\nWhich does not mean that this is a festival full of Brecht plays and lesser works of left-wing agitprop. Joaquim Benite, the director of the Almada Theatre Company, has been programming this fortnight-long festival since its inception 27 years ago, and he does so with a real emphasis on theatrical quality.\n\nThis was certainly true of the programme last time I was in Almada, in 2008, when the late, great Peter Zadek’s Peer Gynt and Chilean maestro Jaime Lorca’s extraordinary staging of Gulliver’s Travels led the bill. It was also the case this year, as I arrived for the closing week of the festival.\n\nIconoclastic Swiss director Matthias Langhoff’s four-and-a-half hour, French-language Hamlet Cabaret is a case in point. Even if one is not convinced of the overall coherence of the piece – which features cabaret music in the style of Brecht’s great collaborator Kurt Weill, a late middle-aged Hamlet and a real horse (which inevitably defecated on stage) – there is no doubting its vitality and virtuosity.\n\nVisually startling at times, it offers a truly brilliant rendering of the famous “to be, or not to be” speech, in which superb actor François Chattot pops up suddenly within the audience and delivers the speech directly to one individual in the crowd.\n\nThe strong French strand in the programme continued with Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota’s staging of Odon von Horvath’s play Casimir And Caroline. Set in a German amusement park in 1931, it is another visually impressive production, even if the physical and vocal performance style is, perhaps, a bit bombastic at times.\n\nA short, painfully sweet taste of fado – Portugal’s most famous style of traditional song – was offered in an unusual show by leading singer Aldina Duarte. Incorporating instruments – such as the harp – which are not typically associated with fado, and using projected images of contemporary dance, she sang a series of the saddest songs, giving spectacular voice to that most Portuguese of concepts, “saudades” (which perhaps translates best, but incompletely, into English as “painful yearning”).\n\nPerformed in Lisbon’s opulent São Luiz theatre, the show put fado in an elevating theatrical context.\n\nFinally, to the National Theatre Dona Maria II in Lisbon, where the wonderful English actress Charlotte Rampling is reading the French text in the Franco-Greek production Yourcenar/Cavafy (which draws on the letters between the French novelist Marguerite Yourcenar and the Greek poet Constantin Cavafy).\n\nIn truth, the piece is barely theatre, and sometimes badly realised at that (at one point Cavafy embraces Yourcenar, only for us to hear his microphone scraping on her back).\n\nThat said, now aged 64, Rampling is an actress of such grace and presence that I, for one, would willingly pay to watch her read the telephone directory.\n\nThis article was first published in the Sunday Herald on 26 July 2010\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nArt can’t heal the horrors of Armenia’s open wounds:\n\nMark Brown travels to Yerevan to watch an overly patriotic play:\n\nLook southwest from the centre of Yerevan, capital city of Armenia, and you will see Mount Ararat, reputed final resting place of Noah’s Ark and the country’s national symbol. However, the great mountain is not only a source of national pride, but also of national pain.\n\nThe Turkish government continues to this day to deny the facts of what historian and journalist Robert Fisk correctly calls “the forgotten holocaust”. This denial not only shames Turkey, it also ensures that the genocide remains an open wound for Armenians, who are forced to fight for the veracity of this most catastrophic chapter in their troubled history.\n\nIt was little surprise, therefore, that the opening production of the recent Armenian theatre showcase in Yerevan (held in conjunction with the world congress of the International Association of Theatre Critics) pertained to the genocide. The Forty Days Of Musa Dagh, a play adapted by director Armen Elbakyan from the famous novel by Franz Werfel, is based upon the true story of the resistance to, and escape from, the Turkish army by the inhabitants of the western Armenian village of Musa Dagh.\n\nWatching the play at the Sundukyan National Academic Theatre proved to be more memorable as an ­anthropological experience than an artistic one. The production is, at best, a two-dimensional dramatisation of history. Heavy on sentimentality and romantic patriotism, and replete with ultra-demonic representations of the Turks, it is as if the Musa Dagh story had been put in the none-too-subtle hands of Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, creators of the stage musical Les Misérables.\n\nRegardless of the aesthetic misgivings of many of the assembled international critics, the overwhelming majority of the Armenian audience meets the play (which premiered last autumn in Yerevan) with enthusiastic acclaim. It is noticeable, however, that the regular outbursts of thunderous applause which punctuate the performance are not appreciations of an actor’s ability or the artistry of the text, but, rather, approval of the sentiments being expressed by the characters. It is as if the audience is reliving the Musa Dagh events directly in the theatre, celebrating the courage of those who resisted and, through the play’s numerous images of Turkish mistreatment of Armenians, feeling once more the agony of the genocide.\n\nOne leaves the Sundukyan Theatre feeling curiously uneasy. In the ongoing dispute with Turkey over the facts of the genocide, Armenia has truth on its side. Yet here, on the national stage, that truth is being somewhat vulgarised, turned into a patriotic spectacle in which the audience cheers on its heroes as if they were at a football match. One’s overriding thought is that the memory of the genocide is not best served by the heavy-laden pathos and mawkishness of the production. The source of the play’s popularity is not difficult to see, but populism rarely makes for good theatre.\n\nHayk Demoyan, director of the Armenian Genocide Museum in Yerevan, has spoken of his determination to remove from the museum inappropriate and polemical elements, such as what he calls “old clichés about Turks”. One can’t help but wish that, in adapting Werfel’s novel for the stage, Elbakyan had taken a similar approach.\n\nThis article was originally published in the Sunday Herald on 28 June 2010\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nPoetry in motion:\n\nThe highlight of this year’s Edinburgh Festival will be Poland’s Song of the Goat Theatre:\n\nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe can seem like a merry-go-round of disposable culture, dominated by controversialising stand-up comedians and penis puppeteers. However, every year at the festival, there is one show of such theatrical skill and emotional resonance that audiences feel compelled to give the sword swallowers a miss and buy a ticket.\n\nIn 2004, that show was Chronicles: a Lamentation, by the avant-garde Polish company Teatr Piesn Kozla, or “Song of the Goat Theatre”. This year, the group’s most recent show, Lacrimosa, is sure to attract similar accolades and audiences when it takes its place in the critically acclaimed visual theatre programme for Aurora Nova.\n\nSong of the Goat was established in 1997 by Grzegorz Bral, a director, and the performer Anna Zubrzycki. The company is based in the south-western Polish city of Wroclaw, which was, until the postwar Potsdam Agreement of 1945, the German Breslau. Wroclaw is now rec ognised as the cultural centre of Poland, but much of its architecture is still distinctively Germanic. To walk around the cobbled streets of the city’s Island of Churches is to feel as if one has stepped into a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nThere is also something timeless about the company’s theatre space, which resides within a wonderfully preserved 14th-century monastery building that sits somewhat incongruously by the major thoroughfare of Katarzyny Street. It seems somehow fitting that Song of the Goat’s modernist yet defiantly spiritual work should be created in an old religious haven in the midst of the traffic and bars of a thriving city.\n\nInspired by the great 20th-century Polish director Jerzy Grotowski, the company has produced just three complete shows in its ten-year existence. Bral explains that, in the manner of Grotowski, the members’ method is to ferment their productions slowly, until they find something which is “not banal”. That is a modest description of Song of the Goat’s artistic method. It has developed a unique process, relying upon lengthy research of the subject matter and the origins of particular forms of music and movement. This culminates in a short, intense and deeply memorable performance (Lacrimosa lasts less than an hour).\n\nThe starting point for the show is the harrowing story of one of a succession of plagues that ripped through the French city of Arras in the 15th century. The company researched this topic, and also studied the music of the Lacrimosa from Mozart’s Requiem. The third of the production’s disparate elements is the physical movement of practitioners of the ancient Greek fire-walking cult of Anastenaria. All three influences are connected, says Bral, by the idea of the human mind being “possessed”.\n\nI saw the show at the Song of the Goat theatre, in the splendid auditorium with its arched ceilings, built in what was once the nuns’ refectory. It was truly unforgettable. Seven performers, dressed in modest gowns, played on a bare set under shimmering light. Their bodies were brilliantly synchronised in intense, deeply concentrated movements. Their voices, which at times burst into polyphonic song, combined in harmony or clashed in discord according to the demands of the performance. The reference to the Arras plague is largely metaphorical and poetic, although an outburst of sickening, vengeful anti-Semitism among the Catholics of the French city pierces the show’s anguished beauty. In defiance of the subject matter, the production is terrifying yet moving and ultimately exquisite.\n\n“It is a non-literal, poetic theatre,” says Anna Zubrzycki. She explains that the company’s work always returns to the Grotowskian idea of a performance that grows, almost organically, from the company’s process of working: “The performance is immersed in the training, and vice versa. Every performance is different, because part of our method is to improvise elements of the production. It’s like playing jazz. Actually, it is jazz; it is improvised, but not chaotic. It is a way in which I, as a performer, can funnel all of my sensations, emotions and understandings at a given moment, but I know that I will never lose control.”\n\nSong of the Goat is a leading company within a discernible group of eastern European troupes specialising in symbolic theatre. Others include Akhe, DOTheatre and Derevo from Russia, the Czech Republic’s Farm in the Cave studio and Fabrik, from Potsdam in eastern Germany. Bral explains that the roots of this trend lie in the Stalinist period. Forced to find ways of getting round the censor, artists became masters of metaphor. Indeed, there are striking parallels between the theatre that developed in eastern Europe under Stalin and the metaphor-laden cinema coming out of Iran today.\n\n“The period of the 1970s and 1980s, during the communist time, was the golden age of Polish theatre,” says the director. “Because of the political repression, theatre could never be explicit. Everything had to be hidden. We continue to produce that kind of theatre. If you are intelligent or sensitive enough, you know what we are talking about. Theatre nowadays is often explicit, because it thinks it can change something. I don’t think theatre can change anything. Its power lies in symbolism. That is what interests me.”\n\nToday, the need for metaphor in Polish theatre has nothing to do with censorship. Instead, Bral feels he is defending theatrical poetry from a new danger: “The very cheap American culture coming to Poland now – the cheap movies, cheap literature, cheap commercials, and so on – is a huge threat to metaphor, subtlety and symbolism. In some ways the enemy is still there. It’s just changed its face.”\n\nThis article was originally published in the New Statesman on 2 August 2007\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nCultural explosion:\n\nWhy go to the theatre during a nuclear crisis? Mark Brown found out at a South Korean festival:\n\nThe South Korean soldiers at the army checkpoint on Kanghwa Island look suitably bemused. Less than two weeks after the claimed nuclear test by North Korea’s “Dear Leader”, Kim Jong-il, they are faced, not with the massed ranks of the Stalinist state’s million-strong army, but with two busloads of theatre critics from countries as diverse as Iran, Canada and Romania.\n\nFaces painted in black and green camouflage, the soldiers, like all their comrades on duty in this border region, are in a state of permanent battle-readiness. This is not a response to Chairman Kim’s recent flexing of military muscle, however; it has been like this ever since the uneasy truce between the two halves of Korea was declared in 1953.\n\nWe delegates to the 50th anniversary congress of the International Association of Theatre Critics and the Seoul Performing Arts Festival are on a day trip to Kanghwa’s shaman temple. The driver of the first bus thinks, mistakenly, that the temple is beyond the first of the three checkpoints that one must pass through to reach the 4km-wide demilitarised zone that divides South from North Korea. Five minutes later, the driver’s error having been discovered, we’re passing back through the checkpoint. The young soldiers wave us through with tired resignation.\n\nAs we leave the militarised area, we look across the lush, verdant mountains of what would have been known as central Korea, had history not intervened so brutally. Our brief encounter with the peninsula’s belligerent peace is marginally less surreal than our being here at all. What the hell are we – journalists and academic theatre critics from around the globe – doing here, watching plays in Seoul theatres while Condoleezza Rice and John Prescott fly in to discuss the nuclear crisis? The phrase “fiddling while Rome burns” springs to mind.\n\nOur host, Professor Yun-Cheol Kim, president of the Korean Association of Theatre Critics, is impressed that we have come – although he is too diplomatic to say whether he considers it bravery or foolhardiness. “I was embarrassed that, just a week before our congress, there was a nuclear test in North Korea,” he says. “I was worried that people might not want to come; but most of them came. The nuclear brinkmanship of North Korea is not taken very seriously in the world. People are joking about it.”\n\nAlthough many people around the globe laughed off Pyongyang’s test because of its apparently small impact, in South Korea it was considered simply the latest in a long tedious catalogue of provocations. “We have been threatened by North Korea so frequently, with such extreme hostility and propaganda, that we are numb to that kind of bluffing,” explains the professor. “It is too often, and always too strong. We don’t pay much attention to it.”\n\nAt the festival itself, it is Korea’s turbulent history, rather than current events, which predominates. From the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, to Japanese occupation in the early 20th, and the disastrous consequences of the 1950-53 war, one is reminded constantly that Korea, like Afghanistan, is a nation cursed by geography. For ever in the path of major powers with imperial ambitions, it has long been considered a battlefield and part of the spoils of war.\n\nIn Youn-Taek Lee’s extraordinary visual and musical extravaganza Three Beautiful Soulmates, a trio of priests choose different life paths as the Mongols attempt to shape Korea. As the performance is played out through traditional dance, song and mask rituals, the commentary upon more recent history is undeniably poignant.\n\nBoth The Fairy Inside the Wall (a South Korean version of a Japanese play based upon a Spanish civil war novel) and Kyunsugi, Kyunsugi’s Father consider the Korean civil war period and its desperate aftermath. In the first play, a former communist has to hide inside the wall of his South Korean home for fear that he will be killed by nationalists. In the second, the absent, feckless father is the product of a history of male absence caused by a series of wars; the mother is the stable heart of the Korean family.\n\nThere is a double pain in contemporary South Korean theatre; an anguish about the absence and suffering of their compatriots in the ruined North, and a mourning for the victims, many of them leftists, of the South’s right-wing military dictatorship, which fell in 1988. “Our memory of pain under the dictatorship, of censorship and political persecution, is strong,” says Professor Kim. “Also, our memory of the Korean war is still relevant, and painful to all of us.”\n\nIn fact, the capital, Seoul, with its 11 million inhabitants, ubiquitous, super-modern high-rise buildings, Starbucks and 24-hour Hyundai traffic jams, is a looking-glass world in which the city seems unreal, while the artifice of theatre restores reality to people’s lives.\n\nIn the foyer of the Arco Theatre, which is a beautiful and enormous modern playhouse, a largely young audience snaps up the last tickets for the Russian company Formalny Teatr’s elegiac visual poem Between Dog and Wolf. Many converse happily while wearing their anti-pollution masks (Jack Straw would hate it here). The theatre offers the people of Seoul a sense of life and history that is fast diminishing in the postmodern metropolis outside.\n\nThis article was originally published in the New Statesman on 20 November 2006\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nIt seems pointless to try to anticipate the subject of the next show by Robert Lepage and his Ex Machina company. Having enthralled audiences in recent years with their magical takes on Hamlet (Elsinore) and architecture and mathematics (Geometry of Miracles), they have quickly become a Sydney Festival hit with The Far Side of the Moon, inspired by the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nAs ever with Lepage, it would take a brave person to say that the play is actually about what is, nominally, its subject. It would be more correct to say that the piece uses the exploration of space and the Cold War rivalry as a vehicle for Ex Machina’s own exploration of the possibilities of theatre and of the vanities and vulnerabilities of the human race.\n\nWritten, directed and performed by Lepage himself, the play interweaves the facts and images of the space race with the troubled relationship between two brothers (one a PhD student, the other a weatherman) following the harrowing death of their mother. Touchingly humorous and subtly evocative, it exemplifies the company’s talent for convincingly combining apparently disparate elements. The high stakes and excitement of the space programme become of a part with the fears, resentments and petty domestic issues of the Quebec City brothers.\n\nTypically for a Lepage show, it is the stage wizardry of his ingenious sets and projected images which lifts the play beyond the reach of most theatre companies. Just as the weatherman’s broadcast spills seamlessly over into a conversation with his brother, so a washing machine door instantly alters into a hatch inside a space station. Repeated over and over, with breathtaking variety, this dramatic inventiveness renders the work a spectacle.\n\nSpectacular though it is, the piece also carries that other Lepage trademark, simplicity. In one of the play’s most hilarious passages, the moustachioed weatherman exhibits the full absurdity of his narcissism as Lepage brilliantly creates the various exercise machines of a gym using nothing but an ironing board. A basis for fabulous comedy it undoubtedly is, but the scene typifies the director’s constant demystifying of his theatrical processes.\n\nGently emotive, and well assisted by Laurie Anderson’s nicely-measured original musical score, The Far Side of the Moon is bound to continue the love affair between Glasgow and Ex Machina when it comes to the Tramway in May.\n\nThis review was originally published in Scotland on Sunday in January 2001\n\n© Mark Brown"
