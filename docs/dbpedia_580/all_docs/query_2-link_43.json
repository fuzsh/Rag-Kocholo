        "text": "About the Artists:\n\nChoreographer and dancer Guillaume Côté is one of Canada’s most celebrated dance artists. He has been the leading male figure of The National Ballet of Canada as a Principal Dancer since 2004 and has choreographed many works for the company including Frame by Frame, Being and Nothingness and Le Petit Prince. He has also been invited to perform at the most prestigious companies in the world like The Royal Ballet in London, Teatro alla Scala in Milan and the New York City Ballet. Côté is also Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur.\n\nRobert Lepage is one of Canada’s most versatile and esteemed theatre artists. His original approach to theatre has won him international acclaim, particularly for his use of new technologies. He is the recipient of the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He is the founder and artistic director of Ex Machina and has directed numerous plays, operas and films including work for Cirque du Soleil.\n\nComposer, sound designer, musician and instrument maker John Gzowski worked on over 250 theater, dance and film productions for which he has composed, created sound designs, performed live foley and live music and acted as musical director. He has played banjo for opera in Banff, studied Carnatic classical music in India and played oud and guitar in jazz and folk festivals across Canada and Europe. His theater work has won him 6 Dora’s, from 18 nominations for companies like Ex Machina, Stratford, Shaw Festival, Luminato, National Arts Centre, the Mirvishes, MTC, the Arts Club, Canstage, Soulpepper, Dancemakers, Red Sky, Tarragon, Factory Theatre and YPT. Gzowski has played on numerous CD’s, with releases with Patricia O'Callaghan, Tasa, and Autorickshaw as well as a Juno nomination with Maza Meze. He has run Canada’s first microtonal group, touring Canada playing the works of Harry Partch, composed and performed with several new music groups and worked as co-artistic director of the Music Gallery.\n\nAbout Ex Machina\n\nLed by artistic director Robert Lepage, Ex Machina creates, produces, and disseminates multidisciplinary artistic works, most often theatrical.\n\nThe company brings together creators from several fields of activity and offers a broad range of artistic production: original plays written and performed solo or collectively, plays based on existing texts, productions in which various disciplines (dance, music, museology) mingle with theater, operas and multimedia productions featuring a predominantly technological dimension. Ex Machina mainly develops its shows in the city of Quebec, then presents them abundantly in Quebec, Canada and elsewhere in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nBeyond their diversity, the company’s projects have some features in common. Anecdotes lead to the exploration of ideas such as the revelation of identity through exposure to the other. Cultural intersections, the nature of the creative act, interrupted communication and states of dependence are recurring themes.\n\nSeveral dramatic situations oppose the quotidian to the extraordinary, the naturalism to the metaphor, and somehow diffident characters to historical figures. The multilingualism, the massive use of images, the reversal of perspective, the variations in scale, the use of narrative codes borrowed from the cinema and the use of technological tools aim to spark meaning and emotion, reflecting a desire to poeticize theatrical expression.\n\nAbout twenty permanent employees and a large number of artists, artisans, designers, authors, performers, and freelance technicians work each year to create Ex Machina’s shows. They are seen year after year by hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nAbout Cote Danse\n\nCôté Danse burst onto the Canadian dance scene in 2019, thanks to the collaboration between Choreographer Guillaume Côté and Producer Etienne Lavigne. Since then, they have been actively presenting a range of original works, films, and immersive dance experiences.\n\nUnder the artistic direction of Guillaume Côté, Côté Danse establishes a unique vision, combining classical dance knowledge with captivating geometries and intense human connections. Their style is characterized by contemporary lines, sleek contours, and refined athleticism, creating a distinct and dynamic aesthetic.\n\nThrough collaborations with a diverse group of designers, artists, and partners such as Robert Lepage, Mirari Studios, and Son Lux, Côté Danse has successfully produced four full-length productions. These creations have garnered significant attention, with over 125 performances, over four years, in more than 20 cities.\n\nAbout Show One Productions\n\nFounded by Svetlana Dvoretsky back in 2004, Show One celebrates 20 years of operations as a leading cultural presenter and producer in 2024.\n\nSince its inception, Show One quickly became well known amongst Canadian presenters and audiences for its commitment to global artists, exceptional taste, and personal touch.\n\nInitially focused on classical music, the company has since expanded greatly and is now a leading North American presenter of international music, and theatre, and dance companies from around the world. Show One has proudly collaborated iconic artists such as Michael Baryshnikov, Guillaume Côté, John Malkovich, Robert Lepage, Sondra Radvanovsky, and other world leading orchestra, theatre, and ballet companies."
