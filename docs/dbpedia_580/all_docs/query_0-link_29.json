        "text": "In the last decades of the twentieth century, Theatre Studies underwent a major paradigm shift under the drive of the powerful concept of performance. Alongside traditional approaches centered on Western notions such as theatre and drama, the interdisciplinary and multi-cultural field of Performance Studies emerged. Aim of the paper is to elucidate some paths along which the “Toronto School” influenced this shift and to suggest how these two intellectual traditions can productively meet and cooperate in the theoretical framework of the post-disciplinary Humanities of the twenty-first century. A key fact, whereby these approaches can be put in relationship, is that both were triggered by the awareness of belonging to a period of rapid metamorphosis in the human sensory apparatus from the age of literacy toward a new set of communication skills and tools supported by electricity. The main difference is that many extensions of the “Toronto School” have investigated especially the world of electric and electronic media; while Performance Studies have addressed especially live embodied practices and behaviors (either artistic or not). However, in a comprehensive “media ecology” approach, this gap is anything but unbridgeable, the linking ground being orality as a cognitive capacity.\n\nThe objective of this thesis is to examine the impact audiences have on the director?s process of creating a mise-en-sc�ne and to understand the ways in which we might begin to understand and articulate such impact. I argue that the influence audiences have on theatre directors&#39; mise-en-scenes have been ambiguous, and therefore there is a lack in a systematic approach to theatre-making. Through a detailed investigation on the arbitrary methods employed by a selected group of theatre directors, I propose that a communicative approach in capturing audiences? expectations is necessary in shaping mise-en-scenes, directly and indirectly. More specifically, this thesis makes explicit these cognitive processes through a technical investigation, a mechanism which I propose and have graphically represented that can be used to harness the impact audiences have on theatre-making. In this thesis, the historical role and influence of the audience is discussed in Chapter One. This is followed..."
