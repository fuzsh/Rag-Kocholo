        "text": "Spencer Novich grew up in Rhode Island, near Providence, “in Barrington, a little suburb that everybody called Borington”. He trained in experimental theatre at New York University, and in Florence and Amsterdam, before joining Cirque du Soleil’s Robert Lepage-directed KÀ at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and performing in the show more than 1,000 times. While there he appeared in the James Cameron-produced Soleil film Worlds Away.\n\nHe won a bronze medal at the 33rd Cirque de Demain festival in Paris and was a comedy designer and performer on the immersive dinner-theatre spectacle Fear and Delight for Strut & Fret, the Australian production company behind Limbo and Cantina. Now Spencer is appearing at London’s Hippodrome Casino in Strut & Fret’s Blanc de Blanc, in which he is also a creative consultant. He chats to Adrian Arratoon.\n\nThe Widow Stanton: Were your parents in showbusiness?\n\nSpencer Novich: No, my mom is a graphic designer and my dad went to an institute of technology and is a very business-y guy. I was sort of the weird one I guess [laughs]. But they enjoyed theatre, loved musical theatre. I had a lot of experiences of being… not… so… athletic [laughs]. I was always skinny and lanky and had an awkward build and at school they wanted to put me in a remedial gym class. So I gravitated toward theatre and it was a different way to, y'know, find your people. I was not very athletic, then I got into the circus!\n\nCan you remember the first time you were on stage in front of an audience?\n\nI was always performing for my family but the first real time was probably in a production of The Music Man at school, in sixth grade, where there wasn’t a role for me so they invented a fifth member of the quartet [laughs]. So we were a quintet and they just made up a name for me. I don’t know how I felt about that back then, probably, [sadly] ‘Oh, OK, they’re making a role for me because I didn’t get any of the other roles in the show’, but I sort of love it now. It probably led me into this fascination I have of creating my own stuff and not necessarily going through somebody else’s creation.\n\nYou trained in a lot of places…\n\nI trained at NYU, in the experimental theatre wing, and the emphasis was on a more physical approach to theatre and also creating your own work. And as part of NYU there are certain studios you can travel with and one of them was the Commedia dell'arte studio in Florence and also an international theatre workshop in Amsterdam, and workshops with clown teachers, sort of everything. I did as many different things as I could.\n\nWhat was it like joining KÀ?\n\nCirque du Soleil was an interesting experience, a real challenge. I was lucky. After doing two days of auditions, and being put into the database, three or four month later they asked me to audition because I fit the similar weird body form that they were looking for. It was a really dramatic role, which wasn’t really what I was doing for them in the auditions. Joining was a massive thing. I was taking over from someone who was much older than me, and he was amazing, Miro Lacasse, who was the originator of the role. He was an amazing mentor to me. Cirque wanted to do more of a narrative show so that was very interesting and operatic.\n\nHow did you deal with the repetition of doing KÀ night after night?\n\nIt was tough. That’s sort of the challenge of making it fresh, and especially since it was a role I was stepping into. It was even a challenge after just 100 shows. Actually, it was less my circus training and more my acting training that allowed me to keep it fresh and deepen whatever emotional journey I was going on. That freshness has to come from me, rather than external things. Working with all these people from different backgrounds helped; that was one of the most amazing things about working for Cirque. My main partner was a German mime, Jeorg Lemke, who was unbelievable. But you keep it fresh by staying in the moment as much as possible. My initial contract was 18 months and after that I had to make a decision to stay on or do other things and I wanted to continue to work with them. They invest so much money and time into you that I thought I should stay a bit longer.\n\nWhen you left you were in Vegas Nocturne at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. in Las Vegas. You must know Laurie Hagen?\n\nOf course! I’m about to go work with her during a small leave here. I’ve created a sound-effects act for us. Everybody loves Laurie! I’m working on two shows with her actually. We’re doing a workshop together, and I’m working with my friend’s new company, called Hideaway Circus, which is Brooklyn-based. They’re developing a new show and she’s the lead in it. I’m on it as sort of a comedy guide to work with her, as an outside eye.\n\nHer dog keeps appearing on our website…\n\nOh, Sally!\n\nHaving left Soleil, is it exciting for you to be doing smaller shows?\n\nI’m all about the grass being greener, and having balance is huge for me. I’ll be in a tiny little theatre and feel like I need a big theatre, then when I’m in a big one I’ll want a small one because I can’t see anybody. KÀ was massive. The stage is the star of that show. It’s a literal void that you’re performing in. It was in a 2,000-seat venue and I must have been 20-30ft from the first row at some points in the show. I was a speck in that show. Incredible to have to perform so you reach 2,000 people with your body. Then to go from that to little intimate theatres where everybody can see you and to have to be on and emotionally present is exciting and exhilarating.\n\nI was watching your Cirque de Demain performance. Calixte de Nigremont sends his regards…\n\nOh my gosh! Wow, he’s so sweet. I remember showing up to that festival with a CD and, like, an undershirt, and that was what I went with on stage. I felt a little bit like everyone was thinking: “What the heck is this guy doing here?” I don’t know if I knew the stakes, because Demain is massive, it’s a thing everybody guns for. I’d applied one year, didn’t get in, worked hard to get a better showreel and the next year I got accepted. He made me feel so comfortable. I do something that a lot of theatre people see and they think 'circus’, and a lot of circus people look at it and throw me into theatre. lt’s quite a weird position to be in. Again, Cirque Phenix is massive and there was only me in the ring. Also, I was by myself and everybody had coaches and their family and friends with them, I didn’t have a team behind me and everybody else had.\n\nDidn’t you do something with Ryan Gosling?\n\nHe had a Hallowe'en band, Dead Man’s Bones, with awesome music. And as part of the tour they were doing this homegrown talent show. I sent in a little tape of an eccentric dance-and-hat act I was doing and as part of the opening of the show they had all this funny, really cool stuff: a woman who was 70-plus who was a contortionist; a whole children’s choir would join them wherever they went; there was a really cool vibe about it. He came up to me and we had a few words but there were lots of cameras on us and I kind of shut down!\n\nHow did you become involved with Blanc de Blanc?\n\nI’ve worked with Scott Maidment from Strut & Fret, from the conception of the show. We were working on a show called Fear and Delight in Brisbane and this opportunity came up for him to crate a show for Sydney Opera House. I enjoyed working with him so much, and the freedom he gave me was great; he really trusts his performers to give input. I hadn’t felt trust to that degree before. I pitched him ideas and I’m not sure if he just didn’t want to say no or if he liked the ideas but I’d have this crazy idea and he’d say: “Let’s try it.”\n\nWhat should people expect from the show?\n\nOh, my gosh [laughs], a lot, a lot of me, and not just me on stage but a lot of me [indicates his body – I imagine there’ll be some nudity!]. It’s fun and crazy. What’s so exciting to me about it is how far we go without alienating the public. We do some really out-there things, some really edgy fun things that I think a lot of people might not have seen, and somehow it’s packaged into this fun, frivolous present that didn’t turn too many people off…!\n\nShould we bring a change of clothes?\n\n[Laughs] You might want to bring a couple of changes of clothes. Yes, almost certainly. But it’s all very playful and good-spirited.\n\nAnd finally, what’s your ambition?\n\nI love to create; that was the challenge of working in a show 1,000 times. I think as long as I can keep creating I’ll be happy.\n\nSpencer Novich appears in Blanc de Blanc at London’s Hippodrome Casino until 28 August 2016.
