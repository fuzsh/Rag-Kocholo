        "text": "Part of Palgrave's Approaches to Adaptation in Theatre and Performance series, this book theorizes auteur Robert Lepage’s scenography-based approach to adapting canonical texts. Lepage’s technique is defined here as ‘scenographic dramaturgy’, a process and product that de-privileges dramatic text and relies instead on evocative, visual performance and intercultural collaboration to re-envision extant plays and operas. Following a detailed analysis of Lepage’s adaptive process and its place in the continuum of scenic writing and auteur theatre, this book features four case studies charting the role of Lepage’s scenographic dramaturgy in re-‘writing’ extant texts, including Shakespeare’s Tempest on Huron-Wendat territory, Stravinsky’s Nightingale in a twenty-seven ton pool, and Wagner’s Ring cycle via the infamous, sixteen-million-dollar Metropolitan Opera production. The final case study offers the first interrogation of Lepage’s twenty-first century ‘auto-adaptations’ of his own seminal texts, The Dragons’ Trilogy and Needles & Opium. Though aimed at academic readers, this book will also appeal to practitioners given its focus on performance-making, adaptation and intercultural collaboration.\n\n￼How do theatre practitioners translate an existing source into performance? What role does theatre play in the perpetuation of inherited narratives and traditional practices? And what relationship is there between adaptation, performance and change? In this diverse collection of seventeen interviews, the multiple meanings and processes of theatrical adaptation are explored. Covering myriad approaches to adaptation (including live art, puppetry, playwriting, children’s theatre, musical and visual theatre) from a wide range of European, Asian, African and American cultural contexts, Theatre and Adaptation features an exceptional line-up of contemporary practitioners in conversation about their work, including: • Adrian Kohler, Jane Taylor and Mervyn Millar of Handspring Puppet Company on their stage adaptations of War Horse and the testimonies of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission • Katie Mitchell on her stagings of Woolf’s The Waves, Strindberg’s Miss Julie and the Grimm Brothers’ Hansel and Gretel • Ivo van Hove on Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s multimedia stagings of canonical plays by Eugene O’Neill and Tennessee Williams, and stage adaptations of film scripts by Bergman, Antonioni and Cassavetes • Romeo Castellucci on his work with Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio appropriating Dante’s Divina Commedia and Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar • Noh actor and master Udaka Michishige about his interpretations of canonical Noh plays and compositions of new Noh • Simon Stephens on his stage adaptation of Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and his translations of Ibsen and Jon Fosse This ground-breaking collection reveals the pivotal role each practitioner has played in expanding current understandings of adaptation, its relationship to performance and the cultural changes that it might engender."
