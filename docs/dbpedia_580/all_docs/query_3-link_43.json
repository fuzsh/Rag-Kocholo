        "text": "As suggested by its title, Geometry of Miracles is at the intersection of two basics avenues - materialism and spirituality - as incarnated by two great gurus of our century : the American Frank Lloyd Wright, a scholarly architect, and the Russian George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff an epicurean philosopher, both surrounded by a throng of devoted disciples.\n\nA particularly fertile thematic melting pot, the meeting of the two masters and their followers gives us the opportunity to explore both the conformity and disparity of two approaches which, after the fashion of the theatrical creation, merge while seeking a balance between the individual and the group.\n\nRobert Lepages approach to the theater has followed two clear paths : on the one hand is his work with classical, (mainly Shakespearean) texts, but also with contemporary authors such as Brecht, and on the other hand is the creation of a new work forged hand in hand with the elaboration of the actors performance; a collective work which makes use of the performers as much to define their characters as to treat the sources of inspiration (The Dragons Trilogy, Polygraph, Tectonic Plates, The Seven Streams of the River Ota).\n\nGeometry of Miracles takes the second road, but like all of Robert Lepages work, there is never any repetition of method.\n\nOf course there are some recurrent elements from previous works, such as the game of clichés, this recycling where the unlived, the  retrieved  is always one step ahead of lived experience, as if a reflection of our own inability to go beyond the simple absorption of knowledge through modern media, as if we were irreparably forbidden to live, to directly feel, with information replacing consciousness (yet another cliché). The clearest example is still the opening line of The Dragons Trilogy where the heroine claims to have never been in China, even though the entire play will take place in the Far East.\n\nThe group: the response to the desert...\n\nBefore starting upon the technological cabaret Zulu Time, his most hi tech project to date, Geometry of Miracles will also be the occasion for Robert Lepage to try his hand at the relinquishment that Wrights desert seems to summon.\n\nWhere in the past, he would have made use of a technical trick like that brilliant, long reverberation which signifies the passage of time in a restaurant (Polygraph), here he leaves it up to the very essence of the theater : the bodies of the actors, of which Robert Lepage has rarely asked so much, and their song, two human emanations by which he favors collective expression.\n\nThus we will have what Robert Lepage had never apprehended apart from a few short moments from his historic plays (Macbeth): the ancient chorus.\n\nOne after another - a swarm of wax magnate Johnsons secretaries, a ring of Gurdjieffs disciples, a group of Wrights apprentice architects - this group dynamic which seems so incongruous within the framework of this triumphant and individualistic America but, if we take a second look, adapts itself rather well to the image of these companies vaunting their dynamism through their armies of secretaries studiously lined up behind their typewriters, a pattern in an infinite patchwork. This expression of the group is one of the driving forces behind the seduction of these new gurus, each with their own style, who were Gurdjieff and Wright.\n\nThrough his heavy emphasis on the body and song of the actors, Geometry of Miracles may turn out to be Robert Lepages most  choreographic  work yet, in every sense of the word.\n\nAbout the characters:\n\nThis is the first time that Robert Lepage draws upon characters who really existed, not by conjuring them up or making them play their proper texts or music as for Cocteau and Davis in Needles and Opium, but by imagining them in their everyday lives.\n\nThe question is one of professors and students, of mentors and disciples, of gurus and victims, and of the affirmation of the identity of individuals who must sometimes confront their masters with thought, as in the case of Frank L. Wrights disciple, hostile to Gurdjieff but mentally prepared to find in him a new master and who, ironically, ends up with Le Corbusier, Wrights brilliant enemy.\n\nAs a backdrop, the architecture of Wright and the teachings of Gurdjieff, which are based on the clash of individuals and on the theories of repetitive movement.\n\nAround Frank Lloyd Wright and Georgi I. Gurdjieff gravitate Olgivanna, Wrights third wife and admirer of Gurdjieff, Herbert Johnson, the Johnson Wax magnate who commissions a building from Wright, and Wes and disciples of the architect.\n\nAnd in counterpoint to the simultaneous absence and omnipresence of Wright is the invasive lecherous presence of Gurdjieff."
