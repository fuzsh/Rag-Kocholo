        "text": "Two ingenious theatre artists, Michael Levine and Robert Lepage, talked to NOW just before premiering their challenging new work, Tectonic Plates (about couples separating, cultural dissent, the continental divide), which they claimed they’d created “by intuition” in two weeks.\n\nAt the time, we were calling Lepage a performance artist. Now, with 19 plays, five movies and 12 roles on his resumé, we’d say he’s an actor, film director and one of the world’s most inventive creators for the stage, heading up his own production company, Ex Machina. He debuts his latest play, SPADES, the first of his four-part Playing Cards series, at Luminato starting Wednesday (June 13). luminato.com.\n\nRead the issue here."
