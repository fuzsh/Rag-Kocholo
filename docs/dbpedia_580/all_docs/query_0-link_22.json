        "text": "In his film La face cachée de la lune (2003), Robert Lepage uses reflexive strategies to question the transparency of representation and reflect on the relevance of conventions and boundaries. More particularly, this article examines Lepage's explorations of the boundaries between two cultures: science and art. First, it looks at the ways in which this film distinguishes analogical modes of thinking from empirical knowledge. Then, I examine the parallels that Lepage establishes between both modes of inquiry. By emphasizing the optical properties of the cinematic device, Lepage suggests that both the scientific and the cinematic modes of representation construct only partial visions of the world. However, I argue that Lepage's blurring of worldviews is not merely a meta-representational exploration of the poetics of cinema: it can also be interpreted as a discursive strategy to encourage cultural exchange. Ultimately, Lepage's highlighting of boundaries and optical processes invites spectators to broaden their horizons.\n\nVision and Its Double. Cinema and the Revelation of Movement Merleau-Ponty’s Course at the Collège the France in 1953 In this paper, I will try to demonstrate, through the analysis of several films realized between 1920 and 2000 and of a few significant essays from important film theorists, that a phenomenology of movement and space tacitly appears in films, as cinema is the art of motion on screen and so the art of intersubjectivity par excellence. Moreover, I shall try to show that an ontological conception of the chiasm between the Visible and the Invisible (Merleau-Ponty) and of the world as that “something else” that is simultaneously present and absent in every apparition (Patočka), in cinema corresponds to the “présence in absentia” (Bergala) of the off-screen on the screen, that is to say to the opening up of off-screen space by means of eyeline match and by characters exiting and entering the frame. I will finally claim that the use of sequence shot (or long take), of depth of field and of specific camera movements allows to preserve the continuity of reality, and gives the impression that the film is a perceptual experience that happens within reality’s space-time continuum. Keywords: Phenomenology of Movement, Phenomenology of Cinema, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, André Bazin, Erwin Panofsky\n\nMy thesis focuses on the perceptive afflictions caused by alteration of the normal biological functioning of sight and memory. These afflictions are related to the redefinition and disgregation of the classical and postclassical cinematographic characters, and affect cinematographic language, establishing a dialectical relation with the filmic image that contaminates our spectatorial perception. In the first chapter I propose a different reading of a few moments in film history, turning points in which a modification of the ordinary sensorial patterns has been introduced. From the German Expressionism to the late authorial experiments of the 60s, there is a sort of hidden history of film that passes through the continuous redefinition of the audience sensory activity. The different perspective upon broadly studied topics leads to the analysis of contemporary cinema: my thesis tries to investigate the reasons that led cinema to continually increase the representation of perceptive afflictions during the last years, and theses “affected” narratives of afflictions and dysfunctions have interesting effects upon so called “normal” perception of the reality surrounding us. The chapters 2 and 3 respectively analyze memory disorders and different dysfunctions of sight: these elements determine alterations in the ‘normal’ and ‘sensory’ perception of reality. They work as narrative factors changing the visual filmic instruments and redefining the role of the subject (and his/her uncertain definition of identity) in contemporary narratives that show how new technologies are profoundly transforming (and enhancing) the perceptive mechanisms involved in our spectatorial activity. In this work I analyze those films that are mostly committed to a clear and readable narration. My study primarily concentrates on American cinema of the last 30 years – with particular attention to popular Hollywood productions – because Hollywood has become the privileged ‘laboratory’ for the negotiation of gaze and images in the contemporary mediascape (while during the classical era experimental and avant-garde cinema were the “place” in which audience experienced the most important redefinitions of the boundaries between different types of mediated perception.\n\nThe first Transformations in Film as Reality series brought together articles by Komatsu Hiroshi (DB #5), Bill Nichols (DB #6), Michael Renov (DB #7), and Kogawa Tetsuo (DB #8) to explore the history and relationship between film and reality in commemoration of cinema’s centennial in 1995. Over the past decade the YIDFF International Competition has expanded its submission guidelines from film-only to video, and works shot using compact video cameras screen along with films in the festival lineup. Works frequently probe the personal and private and on occasion trigger vigorous debate. Many researchers have written on the relationship between documentary makers and their subjects, but recent current events suggest a relationship increasingly fraught with complexity. And viewers must not be forgotten. In re-inaugurating this series, we have invited writers from diverse backgrounds to address the transformation of documentary and reality in reference to documentarists, their subjects, audiences and outlets (television, distribution companies, film festivals) from different cultural and ethical vantage points. The first installment is by Documentary Box Editorial Committee member Kees Bakker, who addresses ethics in documentaries focusing primarily on Western Europe. —The Editors\n\nEye-tracking studies of film (as well as eye-tracking studies in general) focus on seeing. In this chapter, I shall propose that the human visual system relies not just on seeing, but also on moments of not seeing. That is, I shall argue that moments in which we do not see are not 'fl aws' in a visual system that otherwise strives towards total vision. Rather, such 'fl aws' (moments of blindness) are crucial components of vision and what it means to be human more generally. I shall illustrate this need for temporary blindness by looking at three films that are comprised uniquely (or almost uniquely) of photographs, including Jonás Cuarón's Año uña/Year of the Nail (Mexico 2007), Chris Marker's La Jetée (France 1962) and Jean-Luc Godard's Je vous salue, Sarajevo (France 1993)."
