        "text": "For those who have lived in Quebec City for a long time, the word Courville evokes a village from another era that was located on the outskirts of Quebec City, Canada.\n\nThe name has since disappeared and Courville has been fused into a suburb that merged later on with Quebec City. But some remember what was distinctive about the place: its immediate vicinity to the Montmorency Falls, the highest in North America, and its Ordovician limestone subsoil that created a multitude of more or less giant caves outcropping under an uncertain surface.\n\nCourville also recalls of a more ordinary reality: the Quebec suburbs of the 1970s and their now obsolete bungalows. And, by extension, the concerns of the time. The Cold War, which finds an outlet in exciting hockey tournaments between Canada and Soviet Russia. The sometimes trippy pop of progressive rock. The eternal national psychodrama in which French and English speakers clash, and which will soon be exacerbated. And the beginning of the end of what is called, at that time, the “nuclear family”, this sociological bubble where the mirages of consumption sometimes hide sordid relationships.\n\nOn November 15, 1975, Simon is 17 years old, has his own room in the basement of a pavilion in Courville, a widowed mother mixed up with a shifty uncle, an involuntary and painfully permanent tattoo on his chest, a female friend who woos him without much success and a male friend who is as clueless as he is athletic. The coming year will precipitate things, the social unrest that is gradually taking place will find dramatic and decisive echoes in the life of the young man.\n\nCourville sketches the portrait of a complex adolescence, where the backdrop of collective euphoria cannot occult the torments of sexual awakening, the weight of the look of others or the obsession of appearances. Throughout the show, the ancestral technique of bunraku is used to bring life to puppets of all sizes that embody Simon and his entourage. On stage, Robert Lepage is the narrator of the story.\n\nPremiere / First version with Robert Lepage:\n\n19 September - 10 October 2021: Le Diamant, Quebec (QC, CA)\n\nPremiere / New version with Olivier Normand:\n\n24 - 26 March 2023: National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts, Kaohsiung (TW)\n\nWritten, designed and directed by\n\nRobert Lepage\n\nDesign and Creative Director\n\nSteve Blanchet\n\nAssistant Director\n\nFrancis Beaulieu\n\nManipulation des marionnettes\n\nWellesley Robertson III\n\nCaroline Tanguay\n\nMartin Vaillancourt\n\nAssociate Set Designer\n\nAriane Sauvé\n\nPuppet Design and building\n\nJean-Guy White\n\nCéline White\n\nComposer and Sound Designer\n\nMathieu Doyon\n\nImage Designer\n\nFélix Fradet-Faguy\n\nLighting Designer\n\nNicolas Descôteaux\n\nCostume Designer\n\nVirginie Leclerc\n\nProperties Designer\n\nJeanne Lapierre\n\nProduction: Ex Machina\n\nCo-production:\n\nLe Diamant, Quebec City\n\nLe Volcan, Scène nationale du Havre\n\nLa Comète - Scène nationale de Châlons-en-Champagne\n\nNational Taichung Theater, Taiwan\n\nNational Kaohsiung Center for the Arts (Weiwuying), Taiwan\n\nThÃ©Ã¢tre du Nouveau monde, Montreal\n\nHong Kong Arts Festival\n\nProducer for Ex Machina Michel Bernatchez\n\nAssociate Production - Europe and Japan Richard Castelli - Epidemic\n\nAssociate Production - The Americas, Asia (except Japan), Australia, NZ Menno Plukker Theatre Agent\n\nEx Machina is funded by the Canada Council for the Arts, Quebec's Arts and Literature Council\n\nand the City of Quebec."
