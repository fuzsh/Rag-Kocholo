        "meta_description": "With his incomparable theatrical genius, Robert  Lepage revives the light-and-shadow existence of the master of lyrical abstraction, Jean  Paul  Riopelle. The anchor point: his fresco Tribute to Rosa Luxemburg, which he began the day after the announcement of the death of his soulmate, painter Joan  Mitchell. Thirty paintings like thirty sequences of a torrid love story and an extraordinary life woven into the fabric of a sociocultural revolution. \n\nTheatre is a powerful time machine that Robert Lepage uses to explore the...",

        "text": "The multidisciplinary artist, Robert Lepage is all at once an actor, a director, a playwright and a stage director. Hailed by international critics, his original, contemporary and unusual works, inspired by recent history, transcend borders and challenge the standards of scenic writing, particularly through the use of new technologies.\n\nFrom a very early age, Robert Lepage takes a keen interest in geography, but his growing passion for theatre dictates his choice of career: he enrolls at the Conservatoire d’art dramatique de Québec in 1975. After an internship with Alain Knapp in Paris in 1978, he returns to his hometown, where he develops the great artistic versatility for which he is known.\n\nThe year 1994 marks an important step in his career: he founds Ex Machina, a multidisciplinary creation company of which he is the artistic director. Also under his leadership, the multidisciplinary production center, La Caserne, is created in June 1997, in Quebec City. This last creative space sees the birth of almost all of Ex Machina’s productions until 2019.\n\nRobert Lepage’s visionary side and will to create led him to promote and implement the construction of Le Diamant theatre in the heart of Quebec City. Inaugurated in August 2019, this new and unique cultural venue is intended to be an anchor point for the public, emerging artists and creators from all horizons.\n\nHis most significant works include, the plays, The Seven Streams of the River Ota and The Dragons’ Trilogy; his solos, The Far Side of the Moon and 887; the operas, The Damnation of Faust and Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle; his multimedia works, The Image Mill and The Library at Night; Peter Gabriel’s shows, The Secret World Tour and The Growing Up Tour; and with Cirque du Soleil, KÀ and TOTEM.\n\nEx Machina creative director Steve Blanchet has worked in the arts and culture sector for over 25 years.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2013, he was successively art director and creative director at the Cossette creative marketing and communications agency, where several of his social campaigns won national and international awards. He also worked on a number of publications and short films.\n\nIn 2005, he began working with Ex Machina on the creation of the architectural projection The Image Mill (launched in 2008). He co-created and designed the images until the final edition in 2013.\n\nHe went on to design 887, a solo show by Robert Lepage, and La bibliothèque, la nuit, an immersive exhibition incorporating virtual reality and based on the work of Alberto Manguel, which he creative directed and co-designed with Robert Lepage.\n\nAs a creative director and designer, he has worked on various productions over the last few years, including Shakespeare’s Coriolanus at the Stratford Festival, Frame x Frame with The National Ballet of Canada, Mozart’s opera The Magic Flute at the Festival d’Opéra de Québec, and most recently Robert Lepage’s new solo show, Courville."
