        "text": "Climate Resilience vs Resiliency - A Quibble Back when I started working in climate change nearly a decade ago, the term I came across regularly was ~climate resilience~. To such an extent that if you hop into the IPCC reports and search for 'resiliency', you won't find it with how it is used these days. Despite this, I've been seeing 'resiliency' starting to come up on regular use. I hope this post will convince you to stick to the 'resilience' on a number of points: 1) Respect Your Elders When we look at the origins of the words, both are nouns and both mean roughly the same thing - they are synonyms. But resilience came about several decades prior in the 1600s and is considered the root word of resiliency. If you want to honour our elders, resilience is the word to you. 2) Abstract Meaning The etymology also points to an interesting usage. Resilience has for its roots 'resiliens', which is the present participle of 'resilire', meaning to rebound in latin. On the other hand, resiliency ends with the suffix -cy, which is used for abstract nouns. Resiliency therefore represents the 'concept of rebounding', whereas Resilience is the 'action of rebounding'. So when you talk about 'resiliency', are you discussing a concept or are you trying to affect change? If your work is trying to create change, resilience is the word for you. 3) Highfalutiness We should cringe when we see words like 'utilize' or 'heretofore' when simpler words convey the same meaning; verbosity often comes off as pretentious. Resiliency adds an extra, completely unneeded syllable. If you want to stave off the heat death of the universe by being more efficient with words, resilience is the word for you. Summary: So I hope that this is post is enough to convince you to stick with 'resilience' over 'resiliency' (unless you are intentionally talking in the abstract). The usage of the term has been niggling at me for a while, but I wasn't fully able to put it into words until I came across a great article by Nina Flagler Hall (Northern Emergency Management Assistance Compact). This post would not exist without the original article (link: https://lnkd.in/gmqEMkji). This is merely my summary for LinkedIn viewership."
