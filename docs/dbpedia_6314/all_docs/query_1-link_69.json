        "text": "Introduction to American Studies\n\n26.050.501.01 – M/530-810PM\n\nMary Rizzo\n\nHow has the field of American Studies been defined since its inception in the mid-20th century? This reading seminar will introduce students to the methods, theories, and approaches of this interdisciplinary field. We will examine a combination of classic and cutting-edge texts ranging over a variety of critical topics, such as cultural studies, race, gender, and sexuality. Through this course, students will become familiar with major issues in American Studies, preparing them for graduate work in the field.\n\nResearch Seminar – Cultural History Across Borders\n\n26.050.502.01 – T/6-9PM\n\nRuth Feldstein\n\nThis graduate seminar considers scholarship and primary sources that engage with transnational cultural history in the decades since World War II. How have scholars made sense of the transnational flow of cultural commodities, and related questions about politics, production, consumption, reception, and desires? How can a transnational approach to culture shape (or reshape) scholarly understandings of US history, domestic activism, migration, and more? How can a cultural approach to transnational history shape (or reshape) scholarly understandings of diplomatic and political history, space and place, encounters, and power dynamics that are not anchored in a specific nation state? And how can a transnational focus inform how we analyze primary sources—from written texts to film, photographs, and music? Important note: For students who have taken an earlier version of this (or related) courses, note that many of the readings will be different and you are welcome; please reach out to the professor to discuss further.\n\nTopics in American Studies: History of Women\n\n26.050.521.01 – T/530-810PM\n\nBeryl Satter\n\nIn this course, we will read recent and classic works in U.S. women’s history, covering the period from the 1600s to the present. In addition to providing a rough chronological survey of U.S. women’s history, this course focuses on three themes: reproductive labor, coalitions and political activism, and constructions of gender, race, sexuality, and marriage in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Food in Global History\n\n26.050.521.02 – R/530-810PM\n\nHabtamu Tegene\n\nThis seminar will explore the central role of food in shaping global history chronologically, from 1500 to the present. The course considers food both as a tool for investigating global history and the relationships between human beings, and as a very basic human need. The course has two main themes: globalization and food cultures and the interactions between the two. It explores how on the one hand, globalization created a worldwide system of food production, and, on the other, how food served as a marker of social, racial, gender, ethnic, cultural and national identities in world societies.\n\nGeographically, it revolves around Africa, although paying serious attention to the interactions between African food, cooking and culinary culture with those of Europe and the Americas. To understand the interaction of globalization and the change in food culture we will look at some special developments and institutions, most notably: the Colombian Exchange, the slave trade, empire, migration, which followed World War II; and the creation of institutions like restaurants. The readings for critical discussion and review include scholarly works of history, anthropology, and nutrition studies as well as cookbooks. We will go on some excursions to restaurants and grocery stores in Newark for gaining insights about the current trends in food cultures for course discussion.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Disability Studies\n\n26.050.521.03 – T/230-510PM\n\nAli Howell\n\nThis foundational course in disability studies and theory provides students with a broad interdisciplinary introduction to the field. Drawing upon a wide range of multimedia materials from cultural theory, the humanities, the social sciences, education, the arts, and other areas of inquiry, the course takes as a premise the idea that disabilities are social and cultural, and thus environmental as well as individual. Disabilities and disability identities, as aspects of human diversity, are underscored as vital facets of the tapestry of experiences on our campus and throughout our world. Students will enhance their critical reflection and writing skills, read literary and media texts via a disability theory set of “lenses,” imagine and experience maximally inclusive higher educational settings, consider the relationships between disability and other identity markers (including race, class, gender/sexuality), and articulate their own roles within movements for disability justice.\n\nTopics in Race and Ethnicity: Readings in African American History\n\n26.050.530.01 – M/ 530-810PM\n\nMelissa Cooper\n\nThis course explores foundational and groundbreaking historical monographs in African American history. Paying close attention to methodological approaches and strategies, this course examines both African American history and the making of historical monographs about the Black past.\n\nTopics in Urban Cultures: Theories and Concepts in Urban Geography\n\n26.050.540.01 – R/ 230-520PM\n\nEva Giloi\n\nAt its heart, urban geography is about place-making. As a discipline, urban geography draws on a broad range of scholarly fields in the social sciences and humanities to examine how spatial processes, embodiments, mobility and affect shape the built environment. While urban geographers approach these questions from a variety of angles, in this course we will focus on the symbolic, affective and discursive creation of cities as places of meaning, of socio-spatial inclusion and exclusion, of everyday life and spatial experience. This course presents its theories and concepts on three levels. First, it engages students with some of the classic theoretical texts about how cities are experienced, focusing on issues of embodiment, mobility, and the habitus of space, including texts by Michel de Certeau (Walking in the City), Pierre Bourdieu (Outline of a Theory of Practice), Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities), David Harvey (The Right to the City), Henri Lefebvre (Rhythmanalysis), and Gernot Böhme (Atmospheres). Second, it examines concepts currently used by urban geographers to think about how cities and their inhabitants’ situational identities are delineated, including limits and margins, the phenomenology of space, sound environments, mapping, mobility, embodiment, and more. Third, it surveys specific case studies in which scholars have applied these concepts to real-world examples in global cities.\n\nTopics in Urban Cultures: History of Newark\n\n26.050.540.90 – W/6-9PM - Online\n\nSteven Elliot\n\nThis course will examine the history of Newark from its origins in the 17th century to the present. Our goal will be to gain a better understanding of the critical themes in the development of the city as well as the changing approaches of historians in their studies. We will cover Newark’s history chronologically and thematically, giving space to different perspectives, communities, and methods to craft a deeper understanding of the city’s past. Newark’s rich history allows for the exploration of such subjects as race, ethnicity, gender, labor, and the environment. In addition to reading and discussing books and articles, students will use the Newark Archives Project to develop an understanding of the city’s rich primary source base and craft a research proposal.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Experimental Scholarship and Creative Practice\n\n26.050.550.01 – T/6-9PM\n\nKate Doyle\n\nHow do we want scholarship to be, now? This course considers scholarship as practice with potential for creativity, humility, precision, purpose, change, rigor, activity, activism, and adaptation. Through conversation and exercises for enactment, the course will provide models and engagements for scholarship that asks deep questions of method, structure, and style. Participants will be invited to develop both independent and collectively constructed inquiries and experiments in form and content. Topics and forms-for-exploration will include: archiving, art practice, books, collaboration, conceptualism, curation, cybernetics, digital products, documentation, environment, epistemology, 'failure,' hand-made products, institutional critique, institutions, languages, movement, music, photography, pictures, poetics, politics, publishing, radical practice, recording, social systems, sound, subjectivities, travelogues, video, writing.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Curating Jazz History\n\n26.050.550.02 – R/230-510PM\n\nAlex Chang\n\nThis course will focus on finding and interpreting the holdings of the Institute for Jazz Studies (IJS). Students will learn to navigate an archive, find primary sources, and interpret them for a public audience.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Culture and the Global War on Terror\n\n26.050.550.03 – T/530-810PM\n\nAmir Moosavi\n\nThis course examines cultural representations of The Global War on Terror (GWOT) and its related wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond. Students will primarily investigate how the legacies of these wars are remembered and debated in different forms of cultural production, with an emphasis on film and fiction. In bringing together different perspectives on the GWOT, it asks students to think about how literature and film put forth different, sometimes conflicting, narratives about the regions and peoples affected by America’s “Forever Wars,” crossing the Americas, the Middle East, and South Asia. In so doing, students will learn about the diverse perspectives on the intersections of contemporary culture and politics, how cultural producers have attempted to make sense of trauma, violence, and war, and how literature and film remain important arenas for debate, meaning-making, and cross-cultural understanding. The course will also deal with theorizations of cultural memory, the GWOT’s effects on the racialization of Muslims and securitization in the U.S., and representations of gender, empire, and the very concept of terror itself. Some of the authors whose historical and theoretical texts will be read and discussed include (among others) Faisal Devji, Lisa Hajjar, Alex Lubin, Achille Mbembe, and Jasper Puar. Students will analyze literary and cinematic works by Sinan Antoon, Kathryn Bigelow, Hasan Blasim, Omer Fast, Phil Klay, and Jamil Jan Kochai, and others.\n\nStudents enrolled in the course should expect a discussion-driven seminar. Course requirements include short weekly reflection papers, an in-class presentation, and a final research paper. This graduate-level seminar is open to upper-level undergraduate students who receive the instructor’s permission to enroll.\n\nManaging and Leading Public Humanities Organizations\n\n26.050.562.90 – Asynch/Online\n\nBob Beatty\n\nAmerican historical and cultural institutions are founded on the principle of serving the community through the preservation of and access to the traces of the past. They typically achieve this through their collections, exhibitions, public programs, and other manners of public engagement. These organizations most often operate as nonprofits, and must do so in a manner that is sustainable in the long-term. Explore the principles of managing these important, but complex, organizations including: mission and planning, nonprofit status, transparency, governance, public programming, leadership, finance, fundraising, facilities, legal and ethical issues, technology, and audiences, among other subjects.\n\nResearch Seminar: U.S. History, 1945-1990s\n\nDr. Beryl Satter\n\n26.050.502.01 – M/530-810PM\n\nThis seminar is devoted to researching and writing a substantial, footnoted research paper (approximately thirty pages in length, typed and double spaced, approximately 250 words per page) on some aspect of U.S. history, 1945-1990s. We will spend the first few weeks reading articles about this period, to give you a sense of the questions, methods, and sources that historians use in article-length studies. Class meetings will lead you through the step-by-step process of writing a research paper, including primary source research and analysis, the presentation of polished project proposals and the creation of outlines of your thesis. Some class sessions will be set aside for individual conferences, and others for group discussion.\n\nYour research paper will be due in draft form well before the end of the seminar, so that it can go through several major revisions. Since revision is a process that is crucial to effective historical research and writing, we will devote class time to discussion of each of two drafts of your research project that you must complete a few days before the dates indicated in the syllabus below. Students will meet with the professor on an individual basis to discuss their projects and revisions and also work together on their papers, meeting in small groups with other students to discuss and critique each other's work.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Fate of the Humanities\n\nDr. Wendell Marsh\n\n26.050.521.01 – M/6-9PM\n\nThis course surveys scholarly debates on the value, history, and future of the humanities. Broadly construed, “the humanities” refer to a conglomeration of fields and disciplines that are dedicated to the study, interpretation, and appreciation of expressions of the human mind. This understanding of the humanities includes such diverse works as literature, history, music, and even mathematics and computer code. More of an attitude than an aptitude, more of a mode than a method, a style than a subject, it is through the humanities that the perennial question “what does it mean to be human?” is asked. Such inquiry is as timely as ever as artificial intelligence begs the question with new urgency. After considering foundational statements on the nature of humanistic knowledge, we will read critical histories of knowledge formation, examinations of disciplinarity in the modern university, Black studies critiques of the human, and examples of emergent forms of humanistic scholarship.\n\nTopics in American Studies: U.S. in the World\n\nDr. Kornel Chang\n\n26.050.521.02 – W/4-7PM\n\nThis reading-intensive seminar focuses on U.S. empire-building, examining how it evolved from a white settler society to a global hegemon in the twentieth century. Drawing on both canonical and more recent scholarship, the course pays close attention to the ideals, rationales, and policies that animated and justified American imperialism over the course of two centuries. Students will track the evolution of American power, comprehending its shifting logic and contradictions, and examining how it has changed over time and space. This will involve studying the American Empire from the vantage point of class and political economy, race and gender, policing, development, and the environment.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Creating and Funding Public Humanities Projects\n\nBob Beatty\n\n26.050.521.90DU – Asynch\n\nThe operating expenses of a museum, history, or humanities organization come from a variety of sources including earned income (payment for services, gift shop revenue, admissions, licensing, etc.) as well as philanthropy (grants, corporate support, individual donors, etc.) Because so few generate a majority of their income from earned revenue, fundraising efforts are critical to keeping the doors of any museum open, from the local historical society to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In this class you will learn some fundamental elements of museum fundraising, including individual giving, campaigns, fundraising events, and grants.\n\nTopics in Race and Ethnicity: African Diasporas and Black Migration\n\nDarien Davis\n\n26.050.530.01 – W/5-740PM\n\nIntroduction to Digital Humanities: Black Digital Humanities\n\nMary Rizzo\n\n26.050.533.01 – T/530-810PM\n\nThis graduate course will explore the growing field of Black Digital Humanities. What is the relationship between digital humanities and African American Studies? What can each field learn from each other? In addition to reading and discussion, students will learn digital technologies, which may include blogging, social media, mapping, and archiving in lab sessions, applying theory to praxis. Students will conceptualize a black digital humanities project through writing a grant proposal for the course, gaining experience in grant writing.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Literary Journalism\n\nGaiutra Bahadur\n\n26.050.550.01 – T/230-520PM\n\nIn his manifesto for “New Journalism” in the 1970s, Tom Wolfe announced the death of the novel as the highest, most aspirational literary genre in the United States. It used to be, he argued, that writing the Great American Novel was the secret hope of enough Americans to make it one embodiment of the American Dream. Boldly, he declared that New Journalism had knocked the novel off that throne. Half a century later, his claim is debatable. Still, even if few Americans pursue the American Dream by practicing literary journalism, many have been called to the genre who interrogate the idea of America as Dream.\n\nThis semester, we’ll focus on work that illuminates the exercise of U.S. power at home and abroad in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The required reading includes six nonfiction books about the Vietnam War, the 1967 Newark uprising, undocumented migrants, and the role of the United States in the Salvadoran civil war and magazine profiles of a Guantanamo detainee, a victim of police brutality, and a white supremacist. We’ll focus on innovative writers for whom subjectivity, memory and imagination react in alchemical ways with reporting and research, including Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, Roberto Lovato, Ron Porambo, Luis Alberto Urrea, Alex Tizon, Mitchell Jackson, and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah. At the heart of our inquiry will be the questions: What’s the real nature of America’s power, as idea or armament? What unique dilemmas do factual storytellers confront, and what special potentials do they possess, in revealing it? And, finally, how might writers at the margins, reinventing the canon, embody the idea of America?\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Contemporary American Culture\n\n26.050.550.02 - R/530-510PM\n\nKyle Riismandel\n\nIn this reading seminar, we will focus on works detailing the emergence and maintenance of the conditions of contemporary America from neoliberalism and consumer capitalism to the carceral state, white supremacy, and the culture wars, among others. Though we will not cover every important aspect of modern America, ultimately, our goals will be to understand recent approaches to studying American culture in making sense of the contours of American life since 1970. In addition to the readings on the syllabus, students will have the opportunity to read and write about themes, topics, and works of your choice as well as pick books on the syllabus.\n\nPreliminary Reading List (subject to change, likely to be shorter)\n\nDrew McKevitt, Gun Country: Gun Capitalism, Culture, and Control in Cold War America\n\nKathleen Belew, Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America\n\nPaul Renfro, Stranger Danger: Family Values, Childhood, and the American Carceral State\n\nMelinda Cooper, Family Values: Between Neoliberalism and the New Social Conservatism\n\nEric Harvey, Who Got the Camera?

Sufian, Familial Fitness: Disability, Adoption, and Family in Modern America\n\nMargot Canaday, Queer Career: Sexuality and Work in Modern America\n\nElizabeth Hinton, America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s\n\nJohanna Fernandez, The Young Lords: A Radical History\n\nMarcia Chatelain, Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America\n\nKeith Wailoo, Pushing Cool: Big Tobacco, Racial Marketing, and the Untold Story of the Menthol Cigarette\n\nMelani McAlister, The Kingdom of God Has No Borders: A Global History of American Evangelicals\n\nKristing Kobes du Mez, Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation\n\nDestin Jenkins, The Bonds of Inequality: Debt and the Making of the American City\n\nInternship: Newark Water Coalition\n\nDr. Liz Sevcenko\n\n26.050.619.02 – Contact Instructor\n\nIntroduction to American Studies\n\n26.050.501.01 – M/530-810PM\n\nMary Rizzo\n\nHow has the field of American Studies been defined since its inception in the mid-20th century? This reading seminar will introduce students to the methods, theories, and approaches of this interdisciplinary field. We will examine a combination of classic and cutting-edge texts ranging over a variety of critical topics, such as cultural studies, race, gender, and sexuality. Through this course, students will become familiar with major issues in American Studies, preparing them for graduate work in the field.\n\nResearch Seminar – Arts and Urban Development\n\n26.050.502.01 – T/530-810PM\n\nMark Krasovic\n\nAs arts-based development strategies play prominent roles in cities throughout the world, including here in Newark, a consideration of past practices, ways of thinking, and outcomes is timely. Cities have been artistic hubs for millennia. But when did the arts become a prominent sector of urban economies? When was that sector recognized and organized as such, whether through labor unions or professional organizations? How have the arts been mobilized (often cynically) to attract capital and residents? What role have they played in urban inequality and gentrification? In what ways have artists benefited and been harmed by these uses? And how have they and others imagined the arts and development beyond the economic, as, say, forms of community-building and organizing, dissent and protest, solidarity and movement-building? Through all these processes, how have aesthetic traditions shaped and been shaped by these concerns?\n\nTo explore such questions, we will be using classic and current scholarly essays and book chapters as model texts, defining their possibilities and limitations, establishing central historiographical questions and debates, studying their sources and methods, and identifying the traditional “moves” of academic writing. These reading practices will provide a firm foundation for thinking through our own class research projects – journal-length scholarly essays – that will be the course’s major product. You are encouraged to pursue your own interests under the class’s broad themes, and we will collectively – in workshop fashion – move through key steps in forming topics, collecting and analyzing relevant sources, and writing.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Feminist Theory\n\n26.050.521.01 – R/530-810PM\n\nTheresa Hunt\n\nThe objective of this graduate seminar is to engage critically with the foundational concepts of feminist theory and some of its most historically contentious conversations. We will examine feminism as an evolving set of intellectual and activist movements, grounding its theories in social and historical contexts. This will aid in our efforts to understand the paradigm shifts in feminist theory that have taken place in modernity, and to consider the ways in which discourses of “Western” and “non-Western” philosophies have come to influence feminist debate.\n\nTopics in American Studies: History of the Future\n\n26.050.521.02 – M/530-810PM\n\nBeryl Satter\n\nThis class, primarily an intellectual history, surveys critiques of the current order and dreams of a new future from the late 19th century to the present. Our readings include social criticism as well as utopian and dystopian novels. Our starting point, however, is Thomas More’s Utopia (published in 1516). This work appeared in the midst of Europe’s transition from a feudal to a capitalist social order within which racism, misogyny and class exploitation were refigured in new ways, ways that would be challenged by later intellectuals and utopian critics. We then shift to utopian/dystopian critiques of the late 19th century, during a heyday of industrial capitalism; of the 1930s, focusing on technology, fascism, and sexuality; of the 1960s, focusing on progress, consumerism and bureaucracy; and the 1980s and onward, focusing on gender, technology, the state, and “the commons.”\n\nTopics in American Studies: Managing and Leading Public Humanities Organizations\n\n26.050.521.03 – Asynch/Online\n\nBob Beatty\n\nAmerican historical and cultural institutions are founded on the principle of serving the community through the preservation of and access to the traces of the past. They typically achieve this through their collections, exhibitions, public programs, and other manners of public engagement. These organizations most often operate as nonprofits, and must do so in a manner that is sustainable in the long-term. Explore the principles of managing these important, but complex, organizations including: mission and planning, nonprofit status, transparency, governance, public programming, leadership, finance, fundraising, facilities, legal and ethical issues, technology, and audiences, among other subjects.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Food Cultures and Globalization\n\n26.050.521.04 – R/530-810PM\n\nHabatamu Tegene\n\nThis seminar will explore the central role of food in shaping global history chronologically, from 1500 to the present. The course considers food both as a tool for investigating global history and the relationships between human beings, and as a very basic human need. The course has two main themes: globalization and food cultures and the interactions between the two. It explores how on the one hand, globalization created a worldwide system of food production, and, on the other, how food served as a marker of social, racial, gender, ethnic, cultural and national identities in world societies.\n\nGeographically, it revolves around Africa, although paying serious attention to the interactions between African food, cooking and culinary culture with those of Europe and the Americas. To understand the interaction of globalization and the change in food culture we will look at some special developments and institutions, most notably: the Colombian Exchange, the slave trade, empire, migration, which followed World War II; and the creation of institutions like restaurants. The readings for critical discussion and review include scholarly works of history, anthropology, and nutrition studies as well as cookbooks. We will go on some excursions to restaurants and grocery stores in Newark for gaining insights about the current trends in food cultures for course discussion.\n\nTopics in Race and Ethnicity: Race, Gender, and Medicine in Latin America\n\n26.050.530.01 – T/6-9PM\n\nRosanna Dent\n\nThis course will focus on technologies of knowing, documenting, and transforming the human body from early colonialism to the present with a strong focus on the late nineteenth to twenty-first centuries. Topics will include medicine's role in European expansionism, slavery and nation building; visual representations in print and painting; anthropometry, anthropology and photography; eugenics and architecture; public and maternal health; plastic surgery; and human genetics. This course incorporates Latin American theorizations of race and identity, and draws on both historiographic and ethnographic writing.\n\nTopics in Urban Cultures: History of Newark\n\n26.050.540.01 – W/6-9PM\n\nSteven Elliot\n\nThis course will examine the history of Newark from its origins in the 17th century to the present. Our goal will be to gain a better understanding of the critical themes in the development of the city as well as the changing approaches of historians in their studies. We will cover Newark’s history chronologically and thematically, giving space to different perspectives, communities, and methods to craft a deeper understanding of the city’s past. Newark’s rich history allows for the exploration of such subjects as race, ethnicity, gender, labor, and the environment. In addition to reading and discussing books and articles, students will use the Newark Archives Project to develop an understanding of the city’s rich primary source base and craft a research proposal.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Queer Latina/o/x Theory and Cultural Narrative\n\n26.050.521.01\n\nFrank Garcia\n\nThis course introduces students to foundational and contemporary queer Latina/o/x theory and its interpretation of Latina/o/x cultural narratives materializing in a range of forms, such as in film, television, poetry, essays, novels, music, and (new) media. In studying these subjects, we will consider a range of topics, including but not limited to the meaning of “Latinx,” the emergence of queer of color critique, trans Latina/o/x literature and performance, the role of gay Latino literature in third wave feminism, female masculinity, Latina sex workers, queer Latina/o/x engagement with British post-punk, and the queer criminalization of Latino athletes like Sammy Sosa and Aaron Hernandez. Tentative primary texts may include: Ana Castillo’s poetry collection My Father Was a Toltec, Felicia Luna Lemus’s novel Like Son, Arturo Islas’s novel The Rain God, Justin Torres’s novel We the Animals, and the films Southwest of Salem, La Mission, Gun Hill Road, and Bruising for Besos. Tentative scholarly texts may include the work of: Francisco Galarte, T. Jackie Cuevas, Cherríe Moraga, Emma Pérez, Michael Hames-García, Richard T. Rodríguez, Juana María Rodríguez, José Esteban Muñoz, Laura Grappo, and more.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Cultural History and Cultural Studies\n\n26.050.550.02 – W/530-810PM\n\nRuth Feldstein\n\nThis graduate seminar explores cultural history—and the history of this field- from a variety of perspectives. We ask how scholars from different disciplinary and interdisciplinary “homes” have made sense of cultural history; we consider older and more recent debates in (and about) cultural history as an approach and method. We also consider relationships between cultural history, American Studies, and cultural studies and the theoretical frameworks that inform these (sometimes) overlapping areas of inquiry. NOTE: The focus of this seminar is scholarship and not primary sources; however, I am glad to discuss with students the option of taking this class as a research seminar on a case by case basis.\n\nInternship in American Studies: Newark Water Crisis\n\n26.050.619.02\n\nLiz Sevcenko\n\nDevelop your skills in mutual aid organizing, community-based storytelling, and digital media production through this internship course hosted by the Humanities Action Lab at Rutgers-Newark and Newark Water Coalition. Interns will work with members of Newark Water Coalition–a local advocacy organization–and Humanities Action Lab staff as the two organizations jointly launch Newark Community Voices, a new community-based media project focused on environmental justice issues in the city’s “frontline” communities (those hit hardest by environmental injustice and COVID-19).\n\nThrough workshop-style training sessions and on-the-ground practice with a professional videographer and veteran organizers, interns will gain tangible experience:\n\ndistributing vital resources to local residents through Newark Water Coalition’s mutual aid network\n\nconducting public outreach and developing organizing relationships in frontline communities\n\ncollaborating with local residents to identify potential stories about the environmental challenges, material needs, and public policy priorities of Newark’s frontline communities\n\ncreating short video documentaries about the above issues for audiences in frontline communities and in collaboration with community members.\n\nResearch Seminar: Wealth and Poverty\n\n26.050.502.01 - Monday/530-810PM\n\nBeryl Satter\n\nThis seminar is devoted to researching and writing a substantial, footnoted research paper (approximately thirty pages in length, typed and double spaced, approximately 250 words per page) that focuses on some aspect of the history of wealth and poverty in America since 1865. For our purposes, “wealth and poverty” is a shorthand for any aspect of inequality in the U.S. since 1865. Since wealth and poverty is intertwined in complex ways with other hierarchies in the U.S. (those of race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and disability, for example), topics incorporating those perspectives are welcome and encouraged. We will spend the first few weeks reading articles that present a variety of approaches to the question of wealth, poverty, and inequality in America. Class meetings will lead you through the step-by-step process of writing a research paper, including primary source research and analysis, the presentation of polished project proposals, and the creation of outlines of your thesis. Since revision is a process that is crucial to effective historical research and writing, your research paper will be due in draft form well before the end of the seminar, so that it can go through several major revisions. Students will meet with the professor on an individual basis to discuss their projects and revisions and also work together on their papers, meeting in small groups with other students to discuss and critique each other's work.\n\nCreating and Funding Public Humanities Projects\n\n26.050.521.01 - Asynchronous/Online\n\nBob Beatty\n\n(Counts toward American Studies Public Humanities Requirement)\n\nThe operating expenses of a museum, history, or humanities organization come from a variety of sources including earned income (payment for services, gift shop revenue, admissions, licensing, etc.) as well as philanthropy (grants, corporate support, individual donors, etc.) Because so few generate a majority of their income from earned revenue, fundraising efforts are critical to keeping the doors of any museum open, from the local historical society to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In this class you will learn some fundamental elements of museum fundraising, including individual giving, campaigns, fundraising events, and grants.\n\nSuccess in fundraising includes several key skills:\n\nUNDERSTANDING TYPES of FUNDRAISING INITIATIVES museums use (individual giving, annual campaigns, grants, fundraising events) and how to implement them to support your organization;\n\nIDENTIFYING FUNDERS using technology and data research for each initiative to provide support to your organization;\n\nTELLING THE STORY and effectively communicating your organization's purpose (mission, activities, data sets, accomplishments) to tell your organization’s unique story;\n\nCRAFTING THE BEST MESSAGE TO SUPPORT EACH INITIATIVE TYPE and AUDIENCE using critical thinking to understand what information to convey at what time and to what audience – i.e. a foundation will require different information than an individual donor. This course is designed to help you to understand and to begin to master these skills.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Gender and Sexuality\n\n26.050.521.03 - Wednesday/530-810PM\n\nTim Stewart-Winter\n\nThis graduate seminar will examine how transnational approaches have reshaped scholarly understandings of the history of sexuality and gender in the twentieth-century U.S. How does the past look different when we pay particular attention to the flow of people, capital, goods, and knowledge across national borders? How does decentering the nation-state as a category of historical analysis change the way we interpret pleasure, danger, embodiment, and desire? Some key themes in our readings include migration, colonialism, war, social movements, public health, and popular culture.\n\nTopics in Urban Culture: Space and Place in Contemporary America\n\n26.050.540.01 - Tuesday/530-810PM\n\nKyle Riismandel\n\nThis is a readings seminar that gives graduate students a foundation in the questions, methods, evidence, and modes of analysis related to the interdisciplinary study of post-1970 American space and place, broadly conceived.\n\nThrough critical engagement with secondary sources, students will understand how to research and write about American spaces including not only studies of cities and suburbs but also prisons, cyberspace, office parks, commercial centers, and more.\n\nThat work will inform and aid students in researching, writing, and revising their own critical genealogy of scholarship related to the study of space and place. As part of that process, we will work collaboratively to help each other including practice giving and receiving constructive feedback. Ideally, each student’s work will be related to their field of study and stage in their degree program and/or career such as a preparation for Master’s essay, capstone, thesis, dissertation, comprehensive field exam, teaching in a particular subject area, etc.\n\nDraft Reading List (subject to change):\n\nKemi Adeyemi, Feels Right: Black Queer Women and the Politics of Partying in Chicago (Duke University Press, 2022)\n\nLucas Bessire, Running Out: In Search of Water on the High Plains (Princeton University Press, 2022)\n\nMegan Black, The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power (Harvard University Press, 2018)\n\nLawrence Brown, The Black Butterfly: The Harmful Politics of Race and Space in America (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2021)\n\nBrett O.

The course is taught as a colloquium. Each week we will discuss an assigned book. Class attendance and active participation in discussions is required of all students. Our class discussions will examine the major issues addressed by scholars of the history of urban education, how these issues reflect the changing views in America of the purpose and quality of schools in cities, and the implications of historical scholarship for contemporary urban education policy. Students will write a research paper based on some aspect of the history of public education in Newark or some other local community, or an historiographic essay on some aspect of the historical literature on urban education.\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: Experimental Music, Art, and Performance\n\n26.050.550.01 - Tuesday/230-520PM\n\nKate Doyle\n\nSyllabus\n\nIn this course, we will explore art practices as potential models for the unfolding performances, ontologies, and organizations of life, including the fabulously-complicated system we call \"culture.\" In the interest of participant agency and movement toward models of learning based on heuristics (experimentation, self-discovery), expectations for actions and artifacts (projects, documents, etc.), will be (to a reasonable degree) self-directed (note: directions will be agreed upon by participants and must fall within some constraints of university standards/expectations). That said, class participants may initially expect to practice critical interpretation of historical and contemporary texts and media while developing their own inventive practices in analysis, creative processing, documentation, and curation.\n\nBroad goals for the course include the development of skills in project management, organizational strategy and ideation, curation, data visualization, creative archiving, media production (including writing), curriculum building, teaching practice, and conversation design. While developing these skills, class participants will likely acquire significant knowledge of avant-garde and experimental American arts after 1900 (and the cultural/social/scientific theories and histories that influenced them); however, the specifics of this knowledge will depend upon particular participant's interests and self-direction\n\nTopics in Cultural History and Artistic Production: EcoArt\n\n26.050.550.01 - Thursday/230-520PM\n\nAlexandra Chang\n\nThis course will introduce students to the history of EcoArt from the 1960s-70s Land Art movement to contemporary global EcoArt activisms. We will explore current issues and thematics in environmental and climate art activism— studying the work and practices of artists based in the New Jersey/New York area to those working across the U.S. and globally. This class will also delve into the current literature on human relationships to nature and the environment including on the topic of climate disaster. The course will incorporate intensive arts writing practice, critical reflections, and hands on curatorial practice. Students will gain experience working on projects with artists and will participate in the curation of an exhibition related to the Rutgers Honors Learning and Living collection in collaboration with two other collaborating Rutgers classes. The class will also engage in special visits with artists engaged with EcoArt practices and have outside visits to spaces in relation to the curatorial project. The course can be taken by those who have little to no background in art history.\n\nInternship in American Studies: Humanities Action Lab & Newark Water Coalition\n\n26.050.619.02 - Friday/830-950AM\n\nLiv Sevcenko\n\nDevelop your skills in mutual aid organizing, community-based storytelling, and digital media production through this internship course hosted by the Humanities Action Lab at Rutgers-Newark and Newark Water Coalition. Interns will work with members of Newark Water Coalition–a local advocacy organization–and Humanities Action Lab staff as the two organizations jointly launch Newark Community Voices, a new community-based media project focused on environmental justice issues in the city’s “frontline” communities (those hit hardest by environmental injustice and COVID-19).\n\nThrough workshop-style training sessions and on-the-ground practice with a professional videographer and veteran organizers, interns will gain tangible experience:\n\ndistributing vital resources to local residents through Newark Water Coalition’s mutual aid network\n\nconducting public outreach and developing organizing relationships in frontline communities\n\ncollaborating with local residents to identify potential stories about the environmental challenges, material needs, and public policy priorities of Newark’s frontline communities\n\ncreating short video documentaries about the above issues for audiences in frontline communities and in collaboration with community members.\n\nIntro to American Studies – Monday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.501.01\n\nMary Rizzo\n\nHow has the field of American Studies been defined since its inception in the mid-20th century? This reading seminar will introduce students to the methods, theories, and approaches of this interdisciplinary field. We will examine a combination of classic and cutting-edge texts ranging over a variety of critical topics, such as cultural studies, race, gender, and sexuality. Through this course, students will become familiar with major issues in American Studies, preparing them for graduate work in the field.\n\nResearch Seminar: Sexuality and Culture – Wednesday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.502.01\n\nWhit Strub\n\nThis course will begin with several weeks of readings to provide a foundation in the US history of sexuality, with extensive attention to the methodological questions of how historians construct their published work. From there, we will shift into independent research projects, with the goal of composing a scholarly article-like piece of original scholarship. Class meetings will be used to workshop, peer review, and share strategies. Topics students write on can include anything under the broad umbrella of sexuality and culture, so might include slavery and gender; urbanization and sexual regulation; the so-called \"white slavery\" panic of the 1910s; abortion and contraception; pornography and obscenity; the sexual politics of television, the Black freedom struggle, feminist activism, etc.; HIV/AIDS representation; LGBTQ cultural production; queer theory; or anything else of interest. Students are encouraged to think of their projects as parts of M.A. theses or dissertations, potential journal articles, or simply freestanding works of research.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Feminist Theory – Tuesday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.521.01\n\nTheresa Hunt\n\nThe objective of this graduate seminar is to engage critically with the foundational concepts of feminist theory and some of its most historically contentious conversations. We will examine feminism as an evolving set of intellectual and activist movements, grounding its theories in social and historical contexts. This will aid in our efforts to understand the paradigm shifts in feminist theory that have taken place in modernity, and to consider the ways in which discourses of “Western” and “non-Western” philosophies have come to influence feminist debate.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Latinx Literature\n\nLaura Lomas\n\n26.050.521.02\n\nTopics in American Studies: Race and Politics – Thursday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.521.03\n\nDiane Wong\n\nIn this seminar, we start with the basic premise that race matters. How do we understand the conceptualization of race across time? How has the production of racial difference shaped our own experiences and relationships to the American state? What are the connections between racial power and protest — what are the possibilities for change? Together we will survey the literature in political science, sociology, anthropology, history, urban studies, ethnic studies, and other fields to explore how race and racialization processes are articulated in the production of everyday life and entangled with other social structures including gender, class, sexuality, nation, empire, and colonialism. We will spend the first half of the semester interrogating the roots of race and racism in the United States, discussing the intersecting histories of the Transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, migration, and borders. The second half of the semester will focus on resistance and political agency — emphasis will be place on contemporary moments for racial justice from the movement for Black lives uprisings to recent calls to #StopAAPIHate. Topics include but are not limited to ethnic and panethnic identities, diasporic intimacies, immigration, spatial segregation, incarceration, displacement, solidarity and abolitionist futures. Texts include Lisa Marie Cacho‘s’ Social Death: Racialized Rightlessness and the Criminalization of the Unprotected, Thi Bui’s The Best We Could Do, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor’s From Black Lives Matter to Black Liberation, and more. As we read these texts together, you will be exposed to intersectional, comparative, and emergent approaches to the study of race, power, culture, and politics that can inform contemporary movements for racial justice.\n\nTopics in American Studies: Our Planet Crisis – Tuesday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.521.04\n\nJack Tchen\n\nScientists - thousands of them, the best in the world, correlating big data - are projecting we earthlings have a T-minus five to ten-year window to radically zero carbon emissions into the air and waters before our ozone layer become like swiss cheese.\n\nWhat’s the science behind the UN IPCC extrapolations?\n\nWhat does it mean for our water, air, and soil – our food?\n\nHow can Indigenous Local Knowledge guide us in our region?\n\nRather than lead our daily lives as usual, we have to rewire and hack our lives to start making a difference. And we need to start with understand The Land, and the history of HERE.\n\nThis research seminar opens up social justice questions beginning with our lives then to the whole campus, to our families, and to our communities. Our research seminar will become a lab reimagining our power to understand and act in and outside the Zoom-o-sphere.\n\nAll of us, Indigenous, descendants of the enslaved, neighbors, newcomers, and strangers in all shapes, sizes, will need to combine our strengths and insights to grapple with the most important threat to our future.\n\nTopics in American Studies: The Inhumanities: Culture, Space, and Inhuman Identity\n\nTuesday, 230-520PM\n\n26.050.521.05\n\nRachel Mundy\n\nDebates about what it means to be a “person” have been both rich and vexed in recent decades. In this course, we will explore the ways that certain sounds, city spaces, images, and narratives have been classified as “inhuman.” From jazz in the concert hall to Octavia Butler’s Lilith’s Brood, from the strains of the humpback whale to Planet of the Apes, this course draws on artworks and recent writings in the fields of critical identity studies, philosophy, animal studies, science & technology studies, gender studies, sound studies, and music studies to examine the past century of inhumanity.\n\nTopics in Race and Ethnicity: Readings in African American History - Wednesday, 530-810PM\n\n26.050.530.01\n\nMelissa Cooper\n\nThis course explores foundational and groundbreaking historical monographs in African American history. Paying close attention to methodological approaches and strategies, this course examines both African American history and the making of historical monographs about the Black past.\n\nTopics in Urban Culture: Theories and Concepts in Urban Geography - Tuesday, 230-520PM\n\n26.050.540.01\n\nEva Giloi\n\nAt its heart, urban geography is about place-making. As a discipline, urban geography draws on a broad range of scholarly fields in the social sciences and humanities to examine how spatial processes, embodiments, mobility and affect shape the built environment. While urban geographers approach these questions from a variety of angles, in this course we will focus on the symbolic, affective and discursive creation of cities as places of meaning, of socio-spatial inclusion and exclusion, of everyday life and spatial experience. This course presents its theories and concepts on three levels. First, it engages students with some of the classic theoretical texts about how cities are experienced, focusing on issues of embodiment, mobility, and the habitus of space, including texts by Michel de Certeau (Walking in the City), Pierre Bourdieu (Outline of a Theory of Practice), Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities), David Harvey (The Right to the City), Henri Lefebvre (Rhythmanalysis), and Gernot Böhme (Atmospheres). Second, it examines concepts currently used by urban geographers to think about how cities and their inhabitants’ situational identities are delineated, including limits and margins, the phenomenology of space, sound environments, mapping, mobility, embodiment, and more. Third, it surveys specific case studies in which scholars have applied these concepts to real-world examples in global cities.\n\nInternship in American Studies: Humanities Action Lab and the Newark Water Coalition\n\n26.050.619.01\n\nLiv Sevcenko\n\nDevelop your skills in mutual aid organizing, community-based storytelling, and digital media production through this internship course hosted by the Humanities Action Lab at Rutgers-Newark and Newark Water Coalition. Interns will work with members of Newark Water Coalition–a local advocacy organization–and Humanities Action Lab staff as the two organizations jointly launch Newark Community Voices, a new community-based media project focused on environmental justice issues in the city’s “frontline” communities (those hit hardest by environmental injustice and COVID-19).\n\nThrough workshop-style training sessions and on-the-ground practice with a professional videographer and veteran organizers, interns will gain tangible experience:\n\ndistributing vital resources to local residents through Newark Water Coalition’s mutual aid network\n\nconducting public outreach and developing organizing relationships in frontline communities\n\ncollaborating with local residents to identify potential stories about the environmental challenges, material needs, and public policy priorities of Newark’s frontline communities\n\ncreating short video documentaries about the above issues for audiences in frontline communities and in collaboration with community members.\n\nNJIT Courses – Contact History Dept. to Register\n\nHistory 656 / 26:510:656\n\nTopics in the History of Health: Inequity in American Health Care - Thursdays 6-8:50 pm\n\nStephen Pemberton\n\nRacial health disparities in the United States are a deeply unsettling issue for American medicine and healthcare today; after all, their persistence suggests that there is something about American medicine and health institutions that contribute significantly to racial health disparities while doing less than they might do to remedy the problem.\n\nThis course examines the enduring problem of racial health disparities in American healthcare while introducing students to the social histories of medicine, health, and disease in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present. The focus on racial inequity in American medicine and healthcare will provide students with opportunities:\n\nto engage how medical and health issues reflect and illuminate matters of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality in American society\n\nto discover how social movements have influenced efforts to deliver medicine or otherwise promote health (e.g., Jacksonian populism, progressivism, civil rights, feminism, gay liberation, AIDS and other disease-based activisms, consumer advocacy, and contemporary anti-racist actions)\n\nto explore how industrialism, big business, consumerism, law, and health policy have structured experiences of health, disease, and American medicine"
