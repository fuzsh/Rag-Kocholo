        "text": "Essential Question\n\nHow were American’s divisive opinions over the Vietnam War articulated by musicians in the 1960s and early 1970s?\n\nOverview\n\nIn the years following World War II, a brief period of American euphoria gave way to fear of a new antagonist: communism. Though the U.S. and the Soviet Union were allies during the war, Soviet efforts to rebuild Eastern Europe in its own image led to an American fear of ever-spreading communism and caused a rift between the two countries. Allies no longer, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in an indirect conflict known as the Cold War from 1947 until the communist government collapsed in 1991.\n\nRegardless of tensions, the United States and the Soviet Union, now the world’s two nuclear superpowers, knew that a direct war would lead to “mutually assured destruction” in which both countries would lose. Therefore, each nation sought to pursue its aims “by proxy” in other nations. In 1956, with the aid of the Soviets, the League for the Independence of Vietnam overthrew the U.S.-supported French colonial government in Vietnam, leaving the country divided into a Soviet-backed communist North and U.S.-backed republic South. Fighting erupted between the two sides in the early 1960s.\n\nWhat began as an envoy of U.S. “advisors” to South Vietnam in 1964 quickly escalated, and by 1969, 500,000 U.S. troops were involved in the conflict. As the American body count rose–nearly 17,000 U.S. soldiers died in 1968 alone–Americans became divided on the war’s merit. The pro-war “Hawks” feared loss in Vietnam would signal a victory for the Soviet Union, and that protecting the United States from the perceived “communist threat,” wherever it might appear, was one’s patriotic duty. The anti-war “Doves” felt the war was barbaric, and the casualties on both sides served little to no purpose. In 1970, division over the Vietnam War reached a point of crises: in May that year, the National Guard shot and killed four anti-war student protesters at Kent State University.\n\nToday, the tragedy at Kent State might not be best remembered through a news article, but a song: Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young’s “Ohio,” which powerfully articulates the moment when the violence of the Vietnam War was turned inward, upon American students. But “Ohio,” was one of many songs in the 1960s and 1970s that signified the cultural division between the Hawks and Doves.\n\nIn this lesson, students examine how Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young’s “Ohio,” Merle Haggard’s “Okie From Muskogee” and Edwin Starr’s “War” articulated the divisive feelings Americans had about the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s. To supplement these songs, students will also watch clips from CNN Soundtracks and analyze polling data, news articles, and photographs from the era.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nSeminal events during the Vietnam War, including the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, The Tet Offensive, the My Lai Massacre, the election of Richard Nixon, and the Kent State shootings\n\nThe feelings Americans had about the Vietnam War, including the division between the “Doves” and “Hawks”\n\nThe way popular music either directly contributed to discussions about the Vietnam War, or was appropriated by pro- and anti-Vietnam War groups\n\nMastery Objective:\n\nStudents will be able to define the differing political viewpoints Americans had during the Vietnam War by examining the music, journalism, and photography of the era.\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nPass out Handout 1 – “4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops” and read the article aloud as a class. Ask students to clarify the “5 Ws” of this event:\n\nWhat is being discussed in this article?\n\nWhere did the shootings occur?\n\nWhen did they occur?\n\nWho were the principal actors in this event?\n\nWhy did the shootings occur?\n\nPlay Clip 1, “Ohio,” and ask students:\n\nWhat does the story of the song “Ohio” say about the effect the Vietnam War era had on musicians?\n\nIn what ways do you think the song “Ohio” might have been a more effective method of expressing shock and opposition than any journalism could have been? (Encourage students to consider the emotional power of a song, the ability to sing “four dead in Ohio” as the chorus, and the power of popular culture.)\n\nDisplay Image 1, Ohio Lyrics on the board and ask:\n\nWho might Neil Young be referring to in the line “found her dead on the ground”?\n\nWhat do you think Neil Young means in the song with the lyric “we’re finally on our own?”\n\nIn what ways does this song represent an “in your face” protest? What is it calling into question? (Encourage students to consider the placement of the President of the United States as a predator towards his own citizens; the war has been shifted from Vietnam to Ohio.)\n\nDo you think everyone agreed with Neil Young’s view of what occurred at Kent State? Why do you think “Ohio” might have also been a “touchstone of opposition” for people that supported the Vietnam War?\n\nProcedure:\n\nShow Image 2, Poll on Vietnam. Ask students:\n\nWhat is this chart showing?\n\nWhat does the orange line represent?\n\nWhat does the blue line represent?\n\nWhat do the numbers on each line represent?\n\nWhat general trajectory do you see in this chart? What is happening over time?\n\nShow Image 3, Vietnam Poll with Timeline. Read over each timeline entry as a class. Then ask:\n\nAt what point does the public view on Vietnam change? What events might have prompted that change?\n\nWhy might have Americans been increasingly against the Vietnam War after 1968? What sort of events occurred which might have furthered their disapproval?\n\nTell students that during much of the Vietnam War, Americans were split between groups known as the “Hawks,” and the “Doves.” Ask students:\n\nBased on the label, what might have the “Doves” believed about the Vietnam War?\n\nWhat line on the chart might have been represented most strongly by the Doves?\n\nWhat might have the “Hawks” believed about the Vietnam War?\n\nWhat line on the chart might have been represented most strongly by the Hawks?\n\nAccording to the poll, when were there more Hawks? When were there more Doves?\n\nDivide students into groups, and pass out to each student Handout 2 – Comparing Hawks and Doves. Tell students they will be watching clips from Soundtracks and doing a Gallery Walk to examine more closely how the Hawks and Doves differed.\n\nPlace the Hawks and Doves Gallery Walk images around the classroom, and show Image 4, Gallery Walk Guiding Questions. Have students examine each image and make notes on their handout on the differences they see between the Hawks and Doves, using the questions displayed as a guide.\n\nPlay Clip 2, “Okie From Muskogee,” and then display Image 5, Lyrics to Okie From Muskogee. Ask students:\n\nThe clip mentions that Nixon, in his election, made an appeal to the “Silent Majority.” What kind of people might he have been referring to with this term? What sort of people was he NOT referring to?\n\nHow might Merle Haggard’s “Okie From Muskogee” also speak for “The Silent Majority”?\n\nCraig Werner describes the song as “Directed against the excesses of the Anti-war movement.” Based on the lyrics, how does Merle Haggard describe such excesses? How does he characterize the anti-war movement?\n\nDo you agree with Craig Werner’s assertion that the song was not a pro-war song, but an anti-anti-war song? Is there a difference between these two type of songs? Why or why not?\n\nPlay Clip 3, “War.” Ask students:\n\nAs Roger Steffens mentions, Richard Nixon campaigned for president on the promise to end the war in Vietnam. According to the clip, what happened instead? (Nixon expanded the war by invading Cambodia).\n\nAccording to the clip, was Kent State the only school in which the national guard shot students? Where else were students shot?\n\nDisplay Image 6, Quotes by Edwin Starr and Muhammad Ali. Ask students:\n\nWhat might Edwin Starr be referring to when he says “neighborhood and racial wars?”\n\nWhat might Muhammad Ali mean when he says “We’ve been in jail for four hundred years.” Who is he referring to?\n\nBased on the quotes and the clip, how might the anti-war movement had particular relevance to African Americans? Are there any ways it might have been less relevant for them?\n\nBoth Edwin Starr’s “War” and Merle Haggard’s “Okie From Muskogee” were not originally intended to be about the Vietnam War. What was it about the songs that led to their appropriation by the Hawks and Doves?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nAsk student groups to review the notes they took on Handout 2, and complete the following sentences:\n\n“The Doves opposed the Vietnam War because. . . .”\n\n“The Hawks supported the Vietnam War because. . .”\n\nHave each student group read their sentences out loud, and discuss the ways the statements between groups may be similar or different.\n\nExtension Activities:\n\nWatch the full Soundtracks episode on Kent State and the Vietnam War here. Choose another song discussed in the episode, and some further research on it. Did it represent the feelings of the Doves, Hawks, or neither?\n\nHumans have a strong, powerful, and motivating need to belong. Throughout history, this need has caused some to ignore factual information that contradicts their beliefs, searching instead for opinions that support their own views. This concept can be illustrated with these six psychology terms. Research and apply one to three of these Social Psychology concepts to the polarization occurring during the Vietnam War. How might have these concepts strengthened the divide between the Hawks and the Doves?\n\nConfirmation bias\n\nBelief perseverance\n\nAvailability Heuristic\n\nFixation\n\nConformity\n\nGroupthink\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – “4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops” Handout 2 – Comparing Hawks and Doves Hawks and Doves Gallery
