        "text": "The Vietnam War is often viewed as a stain on the fabric of America. Domestically, the nation was divided. The country was split between the hawks in favor of war and the doves seeking a peaceful resolution. Anti-war protests spread as the conflict escalated, and more American soldiers returned in body bags. The economy suffered as government funds were diverted away from social programs and dumped into the military and defense sectors. Ultimately, the revolutionary forces of Vietnam rejected western democratic and capitalist beliefs and ultimately banded together under the communist banner to defeat their foreign aggressors. With regard to world affairs, the United States position as a world superpower was put into question at the conclusion of this bloody war. The once powerful veil of American military superiority was shattered with the defeat in Vietnam.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Vietnam War, there was an opportunity for America to begin the healing process. However, this was a slow and arduous process. It did not occur immediately after the conflict. There was a period where very few individuals wanted to discuss the war. Feelings were repressed and buried under the rug. Politicians stepped back and shifted foreign policy strategies and goals. Eventually, time wore on and painful feelings connected to the war subsided for some, allowing them the chance to begin a new dialogue about the Vietnam War. Film makers then and now use the backdrop of the Vietnam conflict as a vehicle to tell stories. Below are the Vietnam War related films that I feel tell the best stories about the human condition during one of the bloodiest conflicts in the modern era:\n\nWhy Am I Qualified to Create This List\n\nI’m not a film critic, nor am I attempting to be. Despite that I have an extensive background in the Vietnam War and have visited Vietnam on multiple occasions. To read more about that matter please read the “My Vietnam Story” section on the Vietnam travel page. Additionally, I have taken a variety of film courses throughout my studies. I could have created a highly complex chart with a variety of categories that I rank and then average out to determine the order of the films. Instead, I am listing the films in order of my personal preference with particular considerations. That being said, I find films with the highest levels of historical accuracy to be the most relevant and well done. I can spot inaccuracies down to extras wearing the wrong boots. The actors ability to connect to the audience is also extremely important when making the war come to life on screen. I also have considered the director’s ability to incorporate a variety of war related themes during the storytelling process. All of these factors have been considered when developing this list.\n\nThe List – Teacher Trekker’s Top 10 Vietnam War Movies\n\nFor each film on the Top 10 List I have included a variety of information you may find useful. I have included a summary of the plot line with attention to the most relevant themes from the war associated with the film. I have also provided information about how to incorporate these films into high school (& possibly college) classrooms. Additionally, I have included the release year, notable actors and the director. Finally, each film title and/or movie poster are hyperlinks that will send you to the IMDB page and a plethora of other information. On to the list…\n\n# 10 – Heaven & Earth (1993) – This is the third and final film in the Oliver Stone Vietnam War trilogy. The film is an adaptation based on the life of Le Ly Hayslip who authored the books When Heaven and Earth Changed Places and Child of War, Woman of Peace. The movie tells the story of a Vietnamese woman who manages to survive a life of hardship despite the tragedy of war. At various points she is the target of both the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) and Vietcong forces. Eventually she becomes the wife of a US. Marine and is able to move to America, but little gets easier with the move. When I examined this film in college, we were required to write a paper explaining the position that the film used Hayslip’s relationships with men as a metaphor that represented Vietnam as the feminine and the United States as the masculine. This film does not often make your typical list. Perhaps it’s due to the film’s original mixed reviews. Personally, I enjoy the film, because it discusses many themes that are often left out of most Vietnam War films, most importantly the experience of Vietnamese women who fall in love with American GI’s, only some of whom were allowed to migrate to America at the conclusion of the war and their difficult transition to the American lifestyle.\n\n(Notable Actors: Tommy Lee Jones; Director: Oliver Stone)\n\nTeaching Moments: The interaction between Le Ly Hayslip and her future Marine husband highlights the interactions between GIs and locals. Showing scenes after Hayslip escapes Vietnam and makes it to the United States will tell the immigrant experience and allow for connections to the Boat People.\n\n# 9 – Born on the Fourth of July (1989) – This is the second film in the Oliver Stone Vietnam War trilogy. It is a biographical film about Ron Kovic, a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat. The movie does a good job of portraying the negative attitudes of much of American society towards soldiers returning home from the war. Kovic loses himself, but eventually recovers to become an anti-war and pro-human rights activist. It sheds light on the experiences of war and the physical and emotional damage inflicted on soldiers years after the battles end. The film was co-written by the director and Kovic. It is one of the best films that develops the theme of the post war veteran experience.\n\n(Notable Actors: Tom Cruise; Director: Oliver Stone)\n\nTeaching Moments: I have shown the film in its entirety as it coincided with an interdisciplinary unit with an English teacher whose class read the book. If you’re looking for shorter scenes, I would recommend the veterans hospital scene with themes about the living victims of war, post traumatic stress disorder, and the putrid conditions returning injured veterans experienced upon returning home. There are also a number of other scenes about the anti-war protest worth showing if that is a topic you want to examine in more detail.\n\n# 8 – Hamburger Hill (1987) – Between May 11-20 1969, the U.S. Army’s 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division ‘Screaming Eagles’ engaged NVA regulars in a fight for control of Ap Bia Mountain in the A Shau Valley near the Laotian border. The film tells the story of members of B Company who for ten days repeatedly failed to take the heavily fortified mountain referred to by US military records as Hill 937 (who named all the mountains in the area based on their height in meters). The battle was brutal and bloody, so much so, that afterwards it was unofficially renamed “Hamburger Hill” demonstrative of the impact that high powered machine guns with large caliber bullets had on human flesh. It’s a telling story about the resilience of man and the sacrifices made by brothers in arms.\n\n(Notable Actors: Don Cheadle, Dylan McDermott, Steven Webber; Director: John Irvin)\n\nTeaching Moments: There are many scenes that show battle tactics, use of military technology, and the reality of jungle warfare. Other sequences include very emotional dialogues that demonstrate the camaraderie amongst soldiers. If you’re looking to show battle scenes and the soldiers’ experience, this is a good option, but you may want to try #7 to #1 instead.\n\n# 7 – We Were Soldiers (2002) – The film is based on the New York Times best-seller We Were Soldiers Once… And Young by Lieutenant General (Retired) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway who both experienced the battle. The film details the events leading up to and including the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley on November 14, 1965, which is viewed by most historians as the first major battle between the US military and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and signified a major shift in the conflict. Although the film is not as good as the book, it does a good job of explaining the incorporation of helicopters as part of military tactics, the escalation to full US engagement in the conflict, and the Vietnamese perspective of the war. The film is a good adaptation of an excellent book.\n\n(Notable Actors: Mel Gibson, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper; Director: Randal Wallace)\n\nTeaching Moments: There are many scenes that show battle tactics, Vietnamese tunnel systems, and much more. There is a very good sequence about the introduction of helicopters and their use in modern warfare that can tie into technological advancements in military equipment. Finally, there are a few scenes about the experiences of the wives and families left behind while their loved ones fight in Vietnam.\n\n# 6 – Casualties of War (1989) – The film was inspired by a New Yorker article and later book that told the true story of war crimes committed on Hill 192 in 1966. A local Vietnamese woman is kidnapped and raped by 4 American soldiers, but there was one man with them who refused to take part in the atrocity. He reports the incident to his superior officers, but his actions left him alone, outcast by his unit and in fear of his safety. The film escalates to the eventual court marshalling of the soldiers in question to determine what really happened that day in the jungle. The film uses this single event as a larger analogy for the atrocities and realities of war, not just the Vietnam War, but all armed conflicts.\n\n(Notable Actors: Michael J. Fox, Sean Penn)\n\nTeaching Moments: If you are looking to discuss war crimes, then there are many scenes in the film worth showing. Keep in mind the subject matter is quite serious and students must be aware of this prior to viewing. The trial sequences are extremely powerful and could be shown in their entirety. There are a number of combat scenes that you can also show, but I would show a film with a higher level of combat authenticity.\n\n# 5 – Jacob’s Ladder (1990) – This film is probably much higher on my list than almost every other Vietnam War film list you may encounter. For me this is the film that deviates from the standard Vietnam War film list. The story follows Jacob who is a Vietnam War veteran who is managing to cope with a great deal of tragedy in his personal life and his prior experiences in combat. As the film progresses he experiences increasing levels of disassociation, flashbacks and hallucinations that make it more a psychological thriller and/or horror film than a war film. His condition is the result of military experiments that were performed on his unit without their knowledge. This idea of building super soldiers has been retold many times, and this is one spin on it using the Vietnam War as a part of the background story. The film tracks his efforts to make sense of his altered reality. Be prepared to be creeped out!\n\n(Notable Actors: Tim Robbins; Director: Adrian Lyne)\n\nTeaching Moments: WARNING: Do NOT show this film to students. The same if not similar themes can be viewed in other films that you can show at greater length. Due to its graphic nature, showing this movie is you asking to get into trouble.\n\n# 4 – Deer Hunter (1978) – The film tracks the story of three factory workers from steel country Pennsylvania who enlist into the Army to fight in Vietnam. Prior to shipping out, one of them gets married and the (unnecessarily long) wedding party also becomes a going away party for the men. Eventually, the three men are captured by the Vietcong and sent to a prison camp. In the film’s most recognizable and emotional scene they are forced to play Russian roulette against each other. One of them makes it possible for their escape, but they will remain haunted by their experiences for the remainder of their lives. The film provides a graphic description of the prisoner of war/missing in action (POW/MIA) experience, which is an often less publicized theme from the war.\n\n(Notable Actors: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep; Director: Michael Cimino)\n\nTeaching Moments: WARNING: Although this is one of my favorite Vietnam War movies, and there are many individual scenes that might be used for teaching purposes, this is another film on my Do NOT show to students list.\n\n# 3 – Full Metal Jacket (1987) – The film is separated into two main acts. The first half of the movie follows Marine recruits in boot camp preparing for their coming tour in Vietnam at the hands of borderline insane Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey). The second half of the movie tracks the experiences of Joker, a free spirited rabble rouser who has transitioned from recruit to war correspondent for Stars and Stripes magazine. While out on assignment he is caught in the opening of 1968’s Tet Offensive and finds his way into combat with fellow Marines in an effort to locate and eliminate a sniper in the war damaged city. The film accurately delves into dimensions of the military mindset and darkest realities of war.\n\n(Notable Actors: Matthew Modine, R. Lee Ermey, Vincent D’Orfino; Director: Stanley Kubrick)\n\nTeaching Moments: This is a very graphic film making large portions of the film NOT classroom friendly. However, there are a few boot camp scenes that I would show about the preparation for war and the brainwashing, sorry, I mean mental readiness introduced in these early training phases. Others should be avoided due to excessive levels of profanity. When the film begins the second act, there is a sequence about the Tet Offensive, the holiday and Vietnamese justification for attacking on what was once a cease-fire holiday. The sniper scenes, although gory, demonstrate the role of snipers, urban warfare and guerrilla tactics.\n\n# 2 – Apocalypse Now (1979) – The film is considered one of the greatest movies of all time despite losing the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. It did win many other awards like the Palme d’Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. The film is very loosely based on Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and updated to the Vietnam War era. The film takes place during the full escalation of the conflict and tracks U.S. Army Captain Willard, who is sent on a secret mission to locate and assassinate Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, who has organized an army of local indigenous people that is conducting unauthorized missions against the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army (NVA). Military intelligence indicates that Kurtz has gone insane. It was Willard’s job to travel up the Nyung River into Cambodia on a U.S. Navy patrol boat and eliminate the threat. After a series of enemy engagements and silly antics, Willard reaches Kurt’s camp, but is captured and held as the Colonel’s prisoner. Can Willard find a way to escape or will he be killed by Kurtz?\n\n(Notable Actors: Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall; Director: Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nTeaching Moments: Like Deer Hunter, although this is one of my favorite Vietnam War films, I would NOT recommend using it as a resource when teaching your students about the conflict. The film is extremely long and convoluted making it pointless to show in its entirety. Many scenes are very cryptic and infer that viewers have a working knowledge of the war. Not having this background information makes comprehending a single scene much more complicated for students. I have not shown any scenes of the film with the exception of the Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault scene.\n\n# 1 – Platoon (1986) – This is the first film in the Oliver Stone Vietnam War trilogy. The story is narrated by Chris Taylor, a young volunteer who turned down college to serve his country. He details his experiences in letters to his grandmother. He arrives at his new platoon as a replacement, and is treated as such until he earns the respect of his fellow soldiers. As his tour passes, he is welcomed as a brother in arms, but his unit is divided. This only becomes more apparent after war crimes were committed by some of the platoon, and it rips the platoon in half. As Taylor struggles to cope with the experiences in war he is caught in two conflicts, one against the enemy and the other within their platoon.\n\nThe director Oliver Stone actually served and fought in Vietnam as an infantryman. He was also the first Vietnam veteran who wrote and directed a major Hollywood motion picture about the subject. His intimate first-hand knowledge of the conflict and experiences in the field helped him craft an exceptional film with powerful characters and interwoven storylines. His observations about his time in country are poignant, but strikingly real. The film’s narration feels like they came from the letters the director sent home when he was in the field many years prior. The film won multiple Academy Awards including Best Picture and Director in 1986.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, the superb storytelling and ability to intertwine countless themes specific to the conflict and generalizations about war, as well as the high level of historical accuracy and authenticity, Platoon is of a much higher caliber than most other Vietnam War era films. Where some films miss the mark, Stone made sure his personal connection to the film and subject carried through during the writing and filming process. Combining those factors together has made it my favorite Vietnam War film.\n\n(Notable Actors: Charlie Sheen, Willem Defoe, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, Kevin Dillon; Director: Oliver Stone)\n\nTeaching Moments: I could teach almost every theme connected to the Vietnam War through this movie. The few exceptions are all connected to domestic America as the film only refers to what is going on back at home and takes place solely in Vietnam. Watch the film and edit it down based on your needs and grade levels. I teach high school juniors and seniors where I can basically play the film in its entirety, with the exception of some drug use scenes that I fast forward through. Instead, I briefly explain the connection with marijuana and heroin use in the field and the increase of drugs in America. Watch the film before you show it, so you can create a graphic organizer that connects to the themes you are planning on teaching.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe films listed above are what I consider the best Vietnam War era films. I feel this way for a variety of reasons. First and most obviously, these are the films that I feel are the best in terms of storytelling and cinematography. Since we are talking about films, it is vital for these elements to be properly incorporated for its success. Second, I am concerned about historical accuracy and authenticity. I notice minor details like incorrect uniforms and badge placement. I’m sure you’ve heard it’s the little things that count, and this is no exception. Well if the extra in the back is in the proper fatigues down to the last button or badge, then it’s more likely than not that attention to detail was taken in all other aspects as well. It’s fair to say that there are varying levels of inaccuracies in all of the films, but that is true of all movies based on real events and personal stories. What is important is that the films on the list above do a better job at presenting as accurate a portrait as possible.\n\nThere are many universal themes that can be viewed in all of the films on the list. The list also covers a wide range of subtopics connected to the war that allow viewers to best choose what films they find to be the most appropriate for their purposes. In addition to a plot summary and basic cast and crew information, I also included some suggestions on what scenes (and their corresponding themes) are worth showing to students if you are teaching about the Vietnam War and looking to include additional resources and visual stimuli to your classroom.\n\nThe Best of the Rest\n\nThere are more Vietnam War movies than I could possibly list. There are some I’m sure I’ve not seen. Below is a list of additional films that could be added to the list had I chosen to expand the list beyond the Top 10. If you have a passion for the Vietnam War era or a particular subtopic, then some of these films may be appropriate for your viewing. Perhaps you enjoy a particular actor or director and may seek out films they work on. Either way, here are additional films that may spark your interest. However, if you haven’t seen all of the movies on my Top 10, I would wait to complete them before moving on to this list.\n\nAir America (1990) – The film tells the story of two Air America pilots who flew missions in Laos during the Vietnam War. When the pilots discover they have been transporting heroin, they must avoid being caught and framed as drug smugglers. It’s a cheesy film full of historical inaccuracies, but the story of Air America, a covertly owned dummy corporation for the CIA to conduct operations is quite real. (Notable Actors: Mel Gibson, Robert Downey Jr.; Director: Roger Spottiswoode)\n\nThe Boys in Company C (1978) – This film follows five young Marine recruits as they begin boot camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in 1967 and continues through a tour of duty in 1968. It’s dated and films like Full Metal Jacket and Tigerland follow similar plot lines, but it was the first of its kind in the Vietnam War era film genre. This film is the first of a trilogy by director Sidney J. Furie, but I would skip the other two films. The film also includes R. Lee Ermey’s first role in film. (Notable Actors: R. Lee Ermey; Director: Sidney J. Furie)\n\nComing Home (1978) – The film tells the story of a soldier’s wife who falls for a paraplegic that just returned from battle. At the same time, her husband suffers a tough tour of duty. The film highlights the realities of soldiers and their struggle to integrate back into society after returning home from war, the majority of which returned mentally and physically damaged. (Notable Actors: Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, Bruce Dern; Director: Hal Ashby)\n\nForrest Gump (1994) – The film is about the fictionalized main character Forrest Gump’s life and integrates key events throughout U.S. history particularly the 1960’s and 1970’s. This includes a number of scenes that involve the Vietnam War abroad and at home. The movie should not be viewed for its historical accuracy, but does highlight some of the challenges that soldiers faced in the battlefield and after returning home. (Notable Actors: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field; Director: Robert Zemeckis)\n\nGo Tell the Spartans (1978) – The film depicts the tale of an Army Major who takes over the command of a remote outpost in rural Vietnam in the early 1960’s. Interestingly, the film goes a very good job of highlighting how the obstacles that U.S. military advisers faced in South Vietnam were the same problems that the French military encountered the decade prior.\n\n(Notable Actors: Burt Lancaster; Director: Ted Post)\n\nGood Morning, Vietnam (1987) – The film tracks the story of a comedic Army radio disc jockey from the Armed Forces Radio Service who is sent to Vietnam in 1965. Although his antics are a hit with the troops, he manages to upset every commanding officer he encounters. Hands down this is the funniest film that deals with the Vietnam War, but in terms of historical accuracy and relevancy the film is lacking. Take it for what it’s worth. If the list was a Top 11 then this film would be on it. (Notable Actors: Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker; Director: Barry Levinson)\n\nHoa Binh (1970) – This French film tells the story of the Vietnam War through the perspective of a young Vietnamese boy who experiences the horrors of war. Finding it may be a bigger issue.\n\n(Notable Actors: None; Director: Raoul Coutard)\n\nReturn of the Secaucus 7 (1980) – This is a low-budget film that grew in popularity with the public, and told the story of seven college friends who reunited for a weekend to reminisce about their involvement in the anti-war protest movement.\n\nThe Siege at Fire Base Gloria (1989) – The film tells the story of a Marine unit who fought from a military outpost against the Vietcong during the Tet Offensive of 1968. R. Lee Ermey’s portrayal of Hefner is worth the hour and a half if you enjoy dated war films. (Notable Actors: Wings Hauser, R. Lee Ermey ; Director: Brian Trenchard-Smith)\n\nTigerland (2000) – The film tracks a group of Army recruits, particularly one disorderly draftee who was opposed to the war, as they go through Advanced Infantry Training at Fort Polk, Louisiana in 1971. Referred to as Tigerland, the base was the final stop before thousands of soldiers were being shipped off to Vietnam. (Notable Actors: Colin Farrell; Director: Joel Schumacher)\n\nUncommon Valor (1983) – The film takes place years after the Vietnam War and focuses on a retired military officer and his efforts to rescue his son he believes is still being held at a prison camp in Laos. Honestly the film is poorly done in terms of historical accuracy and authenticity, but it discusses the problems associated with soldiers missing in action (MIA) and prisoners of war (POW). (Notable Actors: Gene Hackman, Patrick Swayze)\n\nMy Least Favorite Vietnam Movies\n\nI wouldn’t wish these two movies on my worst enemies. The first was one of the poorest attempts at a Vietnam War film I’ve ever witnessed, and its level of authenticity is tragic considering its source.\n\nA Bright Shining Lie (1998) – The film is a HBO made for TV movie based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam (1988) by former New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan about the experiences of retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann who served as a military advisor during the Vietnam War. The book details how Vann’s outspoken nature had sidetracked his military career despite his keen and truthful observation of a mismanaged and unwinnable war. It evoked his fear and mistrust of our supposed allies, the South Vietnamese military. Essentially, Vann said in 1965 what we all know now. That was the book. The movie on the other hand was a pathetic attempt to cram a 900 page Pulitzer Prize winner into a two hour film. The action sequences are low budget and riddled with inaccuracies. Everything about the movie is a cheap B version (I give it a D-) of a Vietnam War film. It’s amazing how such an amazing book could be turned into such a bad film.\n\n(Notable Actors: Bill Paxton; Director: Terry George)\n\nRescue Dawn (2006) – The film tells the story of an American pilot who in 1966 was shot down while on a combat mission. It tracks his escape to flee communist controlled territory and make his way back to safety. It is actually based on an adapted screenplay written from a 1997 documentary film entitled Little Dieter Needs to Fly. Skip the movie and find the documentary. The film is classic Herzog, so if you’re familiar with his style then be prepared for one of the slowest movies ever to hit the screen. This film makes me wish I was in the prison camp in the film, because the torture would have been a welcome change over viewing the motion picture. You have been warned!\n\n(Notable Actors: Christian Bale, Steve Zahn; Director: Werner Herzog)\n\nA Final Thought\n\nMake some popcorn and watch something off the Top 10 List! To the educators if you have any questions regarding incorporating Vietnam War films in your classrooms please feel free to email me. Happy Viewing!\n\nShare this:"
