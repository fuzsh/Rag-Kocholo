        "text": "April 30, 2024 marked the 49th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, a moment that's been represented in various films and TV shows as a critical turning point in the country's history. The lasting effects of the Vietnam War are as potent a part of pop culture in 2024 as the unfolding war was itself in the late 1960s. Though the war has been over for nearly 50 years, its particularly poignant impact on film and television might have something to do with the fact that it was the first war to be fully televised. People from all over the world were able to tune in and not only see some of the shocking events taking place thousands of miles across the globe but also express their views about the war in new ways.\n\nA litany of films was released in reaction to the Vietnam War both in the immediate years after it ended and while the war was still raging onâ€”some films were even shot on location in close proximity to active battle zones. These films harbor differing sentiments toward the war itself, some choosing to focus more heavily on the honorable sacrifices made by brave men and women; others on the damaging mental and emotional effects of battle; or the inadequacy of the U.S. government response to assisting veterans and the damage done to the native Vietnamese people.\n\nIn 2020, the hurt inflicted upon many by involvement in the Vietnam War still lingers and colors the experiences of people who are still alive. Just because battle ended in 1975 does not mean the battle has ended for those still suffering from trauma and PTSD, in addition to the enduring influence on politics, social justice, human rights, and foreign policy. People still carry stories that demand to be told, and the war has successfully immortalized itself within pop culture because of this."
