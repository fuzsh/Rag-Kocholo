        "text": "In 2022 – we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Throughout the year, we’ll be highlighting lists of 40 things related to the Vietnam war/era.\n\nThroughout history, music has covered an array of subjects, such as war and peace. There are songs that are more broadly patriotic and songs that highlight critical problems in our country. During the Vietnam War, we saw music mimic the public’s support, disillusionment and then rising disapproval. The Vietnam era set a precedent for music as a public space to reflect perspectives on war, with critical perspectives being acceptable and even popular.\n\nHere we take a look at 40 songs about the Vietnam era.\n\n1. “We Gotta Get Outta This Place” – The Animals (1965) – while not explicitly about Vietnam, the song’s themes became a popular anthem with the troops.\n\n2. “Feel Like I’m Fixin To

Mary ​(1967) – Not written about the war directly, but it again became a song associated with departure for Vietnam.\n\n4. “War” – Edwin Starr (1970) – A clear anti-war song which rose in popularity

events at the time, including Nixon’s urge to escalate the war effort in Vietnam.\n\n16. “All Along the Watchtower” – Bob Dylan (1967) – Many have interpreted the song’s lyrics as a reflection of the

in war.\n\n18. “Bungle in the Jungle” – Jethro Tull (1974) – Because of the song’s lyrics about spending time in a jungle, many interpret the song to be about Vietnam.\n\n19. “Draft Morning” – The

Tour performances with it.\n\nSince the Vietnam era, music has been used to reflect a range of perspectives on war, a tradition which continues into the 21st century. This dialogue has included reflections on the post-war experience of remembering the fallen at The Wall. In 2014, Bruce Springsteen released a song titled “The Wall” which tells the story of visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to reconnect with a friend. The song was written after Springsteen visited the Memorial and decided to write a song in honor of his friends and fellow musicians Walter Cichon and Bart Haynes who died in the war."
