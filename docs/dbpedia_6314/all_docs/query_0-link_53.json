However while Tri-X is well known to be a film of choice for photographers at the time (and place), it was kinda hard to find information on colour films. What did they use? Kodachrome? Ektachrome?

Color films of the era were less saturated than they are today. You may get something close to the look by playing with the processing. And Ektachrome fades with time, like memories.\n\nLast edited: May 20, 2021\n\nPieter12\n\nJoined\n\nAug 20, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n6,491\n\nLocation\n\nMagrathean's computer\n\nFormat\n\nSuper8\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\n#6\n\nMost probably Ektachrome. Most photojournalists sent their film back to the home office for processing and turnaround speed was essential except for monthly publications. ASA (now ISO) speed of Ektachrome was faster and could be pushed, more suited to action photography.\n\nAlex Benjamin\n\nJoined\n\nAug 8, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n1,695\n\nLocation\n\nMontreal\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\n#7\n\n\"She and her friend soon discovered old slides — film that was intended for projection onto a screen using a slide projector — that were taken by her father during the war.\"\n\nThat quote from the Business Insider article blew my mind when it made me realize that we do live in a time where we have to explain what slides are.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAlexP\n\nJoined\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\nLeubertsy\n\nFormat\n\nDigital\n\nLachlan Young\n\nJoined\n\nDec 2, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,651\n\nLocation\n\nGlasgow\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\n#9\n\nDepends on who was bankrolling the job - Larry Burrows is recorded as using High Speed Ektachrome (ASA 160, officially pushable to 400 from 1968) and Kodachrome II (ASA 25) for his Vietnam War stories for Life Magazine in the mid-1960s.

And in searching for film emulsion names, largely the emulsions used were generally not included information, and the biographical comments by notable photographers of the times had commentary about the experiences of the conflict, wth no one mentioning favorite emulsion, with a sole exception of someone mentioning Ektachrome 64.\n\nLast edited: May 21, 2021\n\nLachlan Young\n\nJoined\n\nDec 2, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,651\n\nLocation\n\nGlasgow\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\n#17\n\nFunny, I used to drop K'chrome off at Fairlawn in the morning, not too late, and pick it up late afternoon for the regular price. K'chrome dropped off in the Cambridge store behind the Grace building came back the next day.\n\nYeah, but my point was about the costs of getting it from wherever news was happening in the world to Fairlawn or Hemel Hempstead etc to get same-day/ overnight process in time to hit press deadlines for the magazines etc (press deadline for a Sunday magazine printed in rotogravure might be Tuesday simply to allow enough time to go through pre-press and print the sheer number of copies - even at the very high impression rate of rotogravure). And photographers/ TV crews often seem to have been prepared to get important film/ 16mm footage back for publication or broadcast by persuading people flying from the scene of action to London, or NYC (or wherever the film needed to go) to act as a 'pigeon'.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAlexP\n\nJoined\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\nLeubertsy\n\nFormat\n\nDigital\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\n#18\n\nI believe fast-made high-contrast B&W pictures were intended for newspapers while color for magazines like Life, Time etc.\n\nPieter12\n\nJoined\n\nAug 20, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n6,491\n\nLocation\n\nMagrathean's computer\n\nFormat\n\nSuper8\n\nMay 21, 2021\n\n#19\n\nI believe fast-made high-contrast B&W pictures were intended for newspapers while color for magazines like Life, Time etc.\n\nNewspapers actually want flat images.

I don't think Kodak or Fuji films, colour negative or transparency, will recreate that look.\n\nOf course the easiest way to do so in a software programme like Photoshop.\n\nMaybe have a look at some of the Lomography colour negative films. Check out their samples photos on their site and see what catches your eye.\n\nLomoChrome Metropolis colour negative is one example.\n\nLomoChrome Purple colour negative another example.\n\nYou could also try some of the \"new\" Silberra film.\n\nAFAIK, the Lomography Colour Negative 100, 400, 800 are Kodak films and I don't think they will give you the look you are after.\n\nI think shooting in 35mm would better suit your project.\n\nIf you do proceed, can we see some of your results, please?\n\nJoined\n\nJul 27, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n251\n\nLocation\n\nSF Bay area,\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nMay 21, 2021\n\n#21\n\nUS soldiers and marines also had Kodacolor-X available. ASA 80, less contrast and less saturated than modern print films. I recall greens were a lot more muted than Ektachrome. Most of the pix in albums are showing their age with color shifts.\n\nAndrew O'Neill\n\nJoined\n\nJan 16, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n10,931\n\nLocation\n\nCoquitlam,BC Canada\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nMay 21, 2021\n\n#22\n\nI asked a FB friend who is Vietnam vet, and he said \"all of us and Stars and Stripes only used Tri-X.

The color shots were mostly done for magazines like Life, which did not have daily deadlines, and were equipped for routinely printing color images.\n\nColor photos by US photographers during the Vietnam years could have been Kodacolor-X, or Ektachorme-X or High Speed Ektachrome. or Kodachrome\n\nLast edited: May 21, 2021\n\nJoined\n\nAug 2, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n23,009\n\nLocation\n\nWest Midland\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nMay 22, 2021\n\n#24\n\nAll the colour images I've seen from the Vietnam war look like High Speed Ektachrome, or plain Ektachrome. Personally I never likedthevE3/4 Ektachrome prefering Fujichrome and that would have been available in the region as well particularly as S troops and foreign war correspondents were frequently in Japan.\n\nIan"
