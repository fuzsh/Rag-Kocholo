        "text": "contributed by Melissa Lucas, senior staff writer\n\nThere’s no arguing that the War in Vietnam was unlike any other war in which Americans fought, either before or since. The cause of our involvement, the circumstances under which the military operated, the warfare they faced, and the sentiment of the American public regarding the war combined to create a truly unique experience for those deployed to Vietnam. It makes sense then, that Vietnam War Films would be unique, as well.\n\nMost of the other top military movies in our series focus on the wars’ action. Vietnam war movies tend to be a little bit different. In fact, on our list of the best movies about the Vietnam War you’ll find very few that depict the war itself. Many are commentaries, many illustrate brutality outside of battle, and all of them seem to leave the audience in awe of, and often disbelief at, all that our soldiers experienced when they were sent to fight in Vietnam.\n\nThat said, here are our picks for the 10 best Vietnam War movies on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu (and one that’s only available on DVD)."
