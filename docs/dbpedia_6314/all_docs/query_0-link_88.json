        "text": "THE VIETNAM WAR is a ten-part, 18-hour documentary film series\n\ndirected by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick that will air on PBS in\n\nSeptember 2017.\n\nIn an immersive 360-degree narrative, Burns and Novick tell the epic\n\nstory of the Vietnam War as it has never before been told on film. THE\n\nVIETNAM WAR features testimony from nearly 80 witnesses, including\n\nmany Americans who fought in the war and others who opposed it, as\n\nwell as Vietnamese combatants and civilians from both the winning and\n\nlosing sides.\n\nTen years in the making, the series brings the war and the chaotic\n\nepoch it encompassed viscerally to life. Written by Geoffrey C. Ward,\n\nproduced by Sarah Botstein, Novick and Burns, it includes rarely seen,\n\ndigitally re-mastered archival footage from sources around the globe,\n\nphotographs taken by some of the most celebrated photojournalists of\n\nthe 20th Century, historic television broadcasts, evocative home\n\nmovies, revelatory audio recordings from inside the Kennedy, Johnson\n\nand Nixon administrations and more than 100 iconic musical recordings\n\nby many of the greatest artists of the era.\n\nThe film will be accompanied by an unprecedented outreach and public\n\nengagement program, providing opportunities for communities to\n\nparticipate in a national conversation about what happened during the\n\nVietnam War, what went wrong and what lessons are to be learned. In\n\naddition, there will be a robust interactive website and an\n\neducational initiative designed to engage teachers and students in\n\nmultiple platforms."
