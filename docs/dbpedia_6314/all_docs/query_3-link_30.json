        "text": "It's the most-visited memorial on the National Mall in Washington, attracting more than 5 million people each year – the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The most prominent feature of the memorial is a massive wall that lists the names of the more than 58,000 servicemen and women who lost their lives during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe memorial also features the Three Servicemen statue, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, the In Memory plaque, and a flagpole with an etching of the insignia of what were then the country's five military branches.\n\nKeeping watch over the wall are three figures in a statue honoring those who fought and returned from the war. The Three Servicemen Statue was unveiled on Veterans Day in 1984, two years after the wall was dedicated. The servicemen depicted in the sculpture stand 7 feet tall upon a base that is a foot tall. Artist Frederick Hart used patina to give the bronze statue some color variation.\n\nKeeping watch over the wall are three figures in a statue honoring those who fought and returned from the war.

A third kneels behind the sandbags, holding a helmet in her hand.\n\nArtist Glenna Goodacre said the young serviceman is saved by the actions of these women - in a monument to the living."
