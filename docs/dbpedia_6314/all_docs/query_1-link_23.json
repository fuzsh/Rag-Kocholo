        "text": "Home — Special Collections — Exploring Vietnam War Stories — The Media\n\nThe Media\n\nVietnam was the first âtelevision warâ in the United States. Though the press had covered wars before, the uncensored and intensive coverage of the war in Vietnam was new, and it had a significant impact on many Americansâ views of the conflict. Although some claim that unrestricted coverage of the war eroded public support, studies are inconclusive in this. Early coverage of the war was generally positive and upbeat, which reflected American opinion. Following the Tet Offensive, stories about the Vietnam conflict frequently became more negative; troops began to withdraw and public opinion dimmed as well. It is unclear whether the media was contributing to public opinion, or merely reflecting it.\n\nStandards\n\nTips for using this module in your classroom\n\nResources\n\nDocumentary Clip"
