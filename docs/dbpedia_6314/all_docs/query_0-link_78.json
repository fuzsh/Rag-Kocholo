Twenty-five years later, she sets out to uncover their story. Her father, a former South Vietnamese major, confronts his political differences with his brothers, whom he never mentioned to his children. Meanwhile, Hoang tries to reconcile her own survivor guilt with her half-sister, who was mistakenly separated from the family during the escape.\n\nOne of the rare Vietnam War documentary films made by a Vietnamese-born director, Oh, Saigon gives a Vietnamese perspective of the Vietnam War and its end."
