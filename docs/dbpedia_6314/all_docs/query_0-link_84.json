        "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C. -- A Greensboro writer and filmmaker is embarking on a brand new project, the biggest undertaking in his career so far.\n\nPhil Blattenberger is working to bring a new take on the Vietnam War to the big screen. He says itâs the Vietnam War movie Hollywood wonât make.\n\n\"In all of those films, we found that none of them have properly addressed or even brought up in a tangible way the Vietnam War experience for black GIs,â said Blattenberger.\n\n\"This is not out there. That was the most compelling thing...this story is not being told. And it is an absolute fresh take on an important subject,â said Dan Black, casting director and executive producer.\n\nâPoint Manâ addresses the experience of African-American soldiers fighting in Vietnam.\n\n\"When I read the whole script I said, 'Wow, this story is something that needs to be told. People need to know about this,'â said Christopher Long.\n\nLong plays Casper, a political dissident drafted into war left wondering whatâs he really fighting for and why.\n\n\"When I first read about him, he is a tough guy, like Phil said, he is political. He is always about conspiracy, who really runs it, who really makes the decisions,â said Long.\n\nSet in April 1968, Point Men takes place just after the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, a time when a fight was also raging back home, the fight for civil rights.\n\nIn his research, Blattenberger learned the Vietnamese were masters of propaganda and psychological warfare. They exploited the climate back home to demoralize black GIs. Â\n\nâThey would call out every time they saw an African-American GI and say, 'Hey soul brother, go home. This is not your fight,ââ said Blattenberger. âImagine, you are a black GI, 1968, your country would not fight for your rights back home, they assassinate the guy whoâs actually doing it...and they ship you thousands of miles to kill other people, and those people are telling you, 'Why are you even here?'â\n\nThat's exactly the reality about African-American soldiers in Vietnam the film crew wants audiences to understand.\n\nâI think what the movie challenges to do is really ask yourself, 'Do you understand or donât you? Do you identify yourself with Casper?'â said Black.\n\nBlattenberger says black GIs were put âon pointââ at higher rates than their white counterparts.\n\nIn war, being on point means to assume the first and most exposed position in a combat military formation."
