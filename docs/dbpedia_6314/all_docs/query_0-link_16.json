        "text": "Jeremy Collier is a returning Vietnam War hero whose haunting experiences leave him unable to adjust to the quiet realities of small town life. His father Bob is the emotionally detached parent who insists Jeremy put his unpleasant memories behind him and get on with his life. Conversely, his mother is the unusually cheerful woman who pretends nothing is wrong. The film lays bare the hidden costs of war on the soldiers who fight, and kill, not for the rightness of their cause, but simply to survive.\n\nCredits\n\nDirector\n\nEmilio Estevez\n\nCast\n\nEmilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, Kathy Bates, Carla Gugino, Kimberly Williams\n\nWriter\n\nJames Duff\n\nDistributors\n\nTouchstone, Miramax\n\nWatch It Now"
