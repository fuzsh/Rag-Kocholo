        "text": "In movies, even documentary movies, where everything, including truth, is a matter of appearances, being \"real\" is not enough. Reality often looks faked or simply unimportant. The camera can lie. In the wrong hands it has an unfortunate way of shifting emphasis to the non-essential detail that illuminates nothing.There are currently playing first-run in New York four new documentary features, more than at any time that I can remember, including the late 60's when some thought that the documentary form was about to revolutionize the cinema. Though I doubt that these films signal any particular trend, they do define particular values and limitations. It's apparent from the four films — John Lowenthal's \"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\" Ira Wohl's \"Best Boy,\" Glenn Silber and Barry Alexander Brown's \"The War at Home\" and Maxi Cohen and Joel Gold's \"Joe and Maxi\" — that the promised revolution has had more to do with the technology of lightweight movie equipment than with the esthetics of cinema. Like the good fiction film, the good documentary film still demands a guiding intelligence, a filmmaker with a point of view.Of the four new pictures, two (\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" and \"The War at Home\") belong to the kind of general-subject documentary that at one time was represented almost exclusively in this country by the old March of Time series, but time has certainly marched on.Both \"Best Boy\" and \"Joe and Maxi\" recall the work of Albert and David Maysles, who, in the 60's developed camera and sound equipment of such portability that the Maysles brothers could enter the private lives of their subjects and record the details with a minimum of self-consciousness. Without the Maysles, whose films (\"Salesman,\" \"Gimme Shelter,\" etc.) owed much to the pioneering films of Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker, I doubt whether there would ever have been a \"Best Boy\" or a \"Joe and Maxi.\"\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" and \"The War at Home\" each explores a particularly dismaying chapter in recent American history, and if \"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" is the more moving and provocative of the two, it's largely because Mr. Lowenthal, a lawyer-turned-filmmaker, has a protagonist he can see in heroic terms. But \"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" is much more than the story of Mr. Hiss's two 1949 perjury trials, his nearly four years in prison and his subsequent efforts to clear his name. It's the record of fashions in American political thinking, adventurous and repressive, from the Great Depression through the years of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the administrations of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, the Cold War and the Korean War, the Vietnam War, on through Watergate and the Watergate-prompted backlash represented by the Freedom of Information Act. This act, Mr. Lowenthal is convinced, has forced the government to make public previously classified material that raises serious questions about the manner in which Mr. Hiss was prosecuted.I suspect that Mr. Lowenthal believes that these disclosures are the most important elements in his film. To the rest of us — to those of us who are not experts on the contradictory details of the Hiss case — the power of the film is not in the proven innocence or guilt of Mr. Hiss but in its recapitulation of history as recorded then, principally in newsreels, and as remembered now, in interviews with Mr. Hiss and with other survivors of that era. This perspective, the gift of time, invests \"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" with an appreciation for the uses of history that is rare in a documentary movie and virtually non-existent in most of our contemporary fiction films.\"The War at Home\" is a much less complex film about a subject that — today, anyway — is nowhere near as controversial as the Hiss case still is. In \"The War at Home,\" Mr. Silber and Mr. Brown recall the radicalization of students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the years between 1963 and 1973, from the first peaceful protests against the Vietnam War to the culminating violence on campuses all over the country as the war came to an end.If \"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\" being centered around a compelling, complicated character who has defied time and fashion, is like reading fiction at its best, \"The War at Home\" is a little like thumbing through the news magazines of the decade it covers. It has no particular focal point, no hero, no revelations of spirit that contradict what we believe or throw new light on the events it remembers. It's a perfectly adequate film, not especially surprising, a walk down Memory Lane.Both \"The Trials of Alger Hiss\" and \"The War at Home\" are examples of a kind of journalistic film that, all other things being equal, must take its scope from the subject. More than a quarter of a century of remembrance is the true subject of \"The Sorrow and the Pity,\" Marcel Ophuls's classic film about France during its occupation by the Nazis. Mr. Ophuls was no less a filmmaker when he later made \"A Sense of Loss\" about the war in Northern Ireland. \"A Sense of Loss\" is a painstaking movie, but it's not an especially satisfying one. The subject, being current, resists the kind of conceptualizing required in art but which is difficult for a filmmaker attempting to keep an open mind. The Vietnam War had only recently ended when Peter Davis completed his \"Hearts and Minds,\" but his feeling of unmistakable fury, which prompted the film's production in the first place, gave it shattering life as a movie.\"Best Boy\" and \"Joe and Maxi\" are documentaries of an entirely different order, being about ordinary citizens with whom, in each case, the filmmakers have relationships that predate the production of the film.\"Best Boy\" is a wonderfully gentle, wise and sympathetic portrait of Mr. Wohl's cousin Philly, a retarded 52-year-old man who, in the course of the production (and possibly as a result of it), begins to make some initial progress in self-reliance. The film is also about the other members of Philly's family, particularly his mother and father; and because Mr. Wohl is a filmmaker in command of his craft and his camera, his movie successfully conveys his love and concern.Love and concern are, surprisingly, the two qualities most conspicuously absent from \"Joe and Maxi,\" which is about Maxi Cohen's father Joe, a well-to-do, self-made entrepreneur on the Jersey Shore who, in the course of the movie, learns he has cancer and, near the end, dies. This is not, I'm sure, because Miss Cohen does not have love and concern for her father but because as a filmmaker she and her collaborator were not able to express those feelings in any way that we can share. Because \"Joe and Maxi\" is all about Maxi's frequently expressed feelings, the movie has the effect of giving short shrift to everyone else, especially her father.Miss Cohen and Mr. Gold were undoubtedy photographing real family get-togethers, real anxieties and real sorrows, but \"Joe and Maxi\" looks like an ego trip. True doesn't look real.In the heady, home-film boom of the 60's all sorts of unlikely people took up the camera to capture truth at 24 frames per second. Norman Mailer, in a brief sabbatical from what he does best, produced three feature-length psychodramas, culminating in his \"Gone With the Wind\" called \"Maidstone.\" Andy Warhol, with the expert assistance of Paul Morrissey, pioneered a sort of impromptu fiction that might be called docu-camp. Canadian filmmaker Allan King, who made \"Warrendale,\" a fine, comparatively straight documentary about disturbed children, took his camera crew and more or less moved in with a married couple (both of whom happened to be failed actors) to make a film about a \"real\" marriage. It was called \"A Married Couple,\" and it looked less like a real marriage than like a couple of married actors trying their best to act like real people.Though \"Best Boy\" works nicely, the camera isn't a reliable tool for therapy. It keeps getting in the way. In \"David Holtzman's Diary,\" Jim McBride's classic send-up of the camera-mad 60's generation, the best friend and editor of the movie-obsessed hero, who is filming his own life to get a fix on it, criticizes the hero's use of his girlfriend as the girlfriend in the movie-within-the-movie. \"She's ridiculous,\" the friend says. \"She's trite. She behaves melodramatically. She's just not credible.\"\"David Holtzman's Diary,\" which was made in 1967, is still the last word on the so-called \"real\" cinema.Correction: In my daily review of \"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\" I mistakenly reported that Whittaker Chambers, after he left the Communist Party, embraced Roman Catholicism. He didn't. He became a Quaker."
