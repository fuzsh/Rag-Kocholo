        "text": "Cease Fire (1985)\n\nTom Johnson Stars as a Vietnam Vet trying to cope with his life and relationships after the war. Mick Hawkins tells us that our own Larry Ashlock (\"D\" Company\") was also in this movie and helped with the technical end. Reviews invited. Vietnam-Television History (1983)\n\nPublic Broadcasting System, Produced by Dick Ellis\n\nThis remarkable and essential seven-volume series--six years in the making and originally broadcast on public television in 1983. I guess it's reasonably balanced, the war really was big and messy. Many of the combat clips really brought \"my war\" back, and the other clips made me realize how limited the perspective of the grunt was, and had to be! Reviews invited. Deer Hunter (1978)\n\nDirected by Michael Cimino\n\nAll-star cast (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Savage).\n\nMy wife considers this the best film about war... any war... but I'm not so sure despite 5 Academy Awards; still the film got us talking about Vietnam! She calls the parts I find unrealistic \"metaphor\". Hmmm. Still, there's lots to like about this realistically filmed, well-acted human drama - not least of all the camaraderie! Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nAll-star cast (Brando, M.Sheen, Duvall, etc.).\n\nPathetic, depressing, morose and pretentious huge budget anti-war film showing signs of copious amounts of drugs allegedly consumed during filming. Predictably, adherents argue it is a \"metaphor\": the script was lifted from Heart of Darkness with no resemblance to anything (but Robert Duvall's performance stands out). The Green Berets (1968) Directed by Ray Kellogg and John Wayne\n\nAll-star cast (really).\n\nMuch maligned film classic made at Fort Benning and the Florida Ranger Camp (while I was there) which attempted to \"realistically\" portray the complexities of Vietnam as only John Wayne could. Forget the plot which varied significantly from Robin Moore's book, but marvel at the look and feel of the times (pine trees?) and shed a tear for little Hamchuck. The Anderson Platoon (1967)\n\nProduced by Pierre Schoendorffer\n\nDocumentary (cast of real-life grunts).\n\nIn the fall of 1966, French documentarian Pierre Schoendorffer spent six weeks with an American infantry platoon in the 1st Cavalry Division. This is the real war... although some scenes look a bit staged. A sobering film. 84 Charlie Mopic (1989)\n\nDirected by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Vietnam Vet)\n\nCast of unknowns.\n\nExcellent fictionalized first person view on a Long Range Recon Patrol in Central Highlands in late 1969. In the opinion of this and other Vietnam veterans, this film looks and feels like a real documentary filmed for the troops being trained for combat in Vietnam, not like a staged movie. If realism and a good feel for that war is what you are looking for then get or watch this film. Hamburger Hill (1987)\n\nDirected by John Irvin\n\nAnthony Barrile, Michael Boatman\n\nRealistic, no-frills look at the deadly siege on Hill 937 in the A Shau Valley, where soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division engaged the enemy over the course of eleven brutal assaults between May 10th and 20th, 1969. I was surprised when I saw this film that it didn't pontificate or editorialize (unusual for Hollywood) but lets the action speak for itself. Platoon (1986)\n\nProduced and Directed by Oliver Stone (Vietnam Veteran)\n\nBerenger, Defoe, C.Sheen\n\nFirst-person account of a young soldier who in a short period is unlucky enough to experience every bad thing that ever happened in the ten years of war. Despite the heavy-handed politics, there are fine performances from an excellent cast. Full Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick\n\nMatthew Modine, Lee Ermey\n\nA two-part drama that begins at a Parris Island boot camp and abruptly switches to Vietnam. Stanley Kubrick's films aren't noted for logical development, and metaphors fly fast and furious, with Kubrick's main point being that depravity and fulfillment are intertwined in war. Maybe I just didn't need to learn that. Distant Thunder (1988)\n\nDirected by Rick Rosenthal\n\nJohn Lithgow, Ralph Macchio\n\nEmotionally troubled (PTSD) Vietnam vet (well acted by Third Rock's Lithgow), who has retreated to live as a hermit in the wilderness, and whose abandoned son (Karate Kid Macchio) sets out to find him. Casualties of War (1989)\n\nDirected by Brian de Palma\n\nSean Penn, Michael J. Fox\n\nBased on a New Yorker article, Michael J. Fox is a straight-shooting soldier in a depraved squad led by Sean Penn. While on patrol, the squad kidnaps and rapes a Vietnamese woman and murders her. Fox refused to participate and reports it, finding that he is in deeper trouble then the miscreants. This all sounds pretty clear-cut, but the film doesn't seem sure what points it wants to make.\n\n2007 UPDATE: Website Committee member Jim Sheppard adds: New documentation has come to light on this TRUE STORY. Upon obtaining two new books;It took Heroes and It Took Heroes II, by Claude D. Newby, of which the latter documents our own Charlie Company CO, CPT Jay Copley, I read the account of the author, an Army Chaplain who, quite coincidentally, was the Chaplain that Michael Fox's character finally got to pay attention to his account of a squad's abduction and brutal rape of a Vietnamese girl. Not only was the film correct, but they neglected to portray that the Vietnamese girl, who was ultimately killed by the men of the squad (On a Long Range Recon Patrol), was 5 months pregnant! We must accept that not all stories of Vietnam are \"Lilly White\"....we had our black sheep...as attested to in the well documented My Lai massacre. With this new knowledge, the original review no longer seems to be slightly \"left wing\", but rather a depiction of actual events. With this in view, I have given the film a \"neutral\" rating. I will admit...the first time I saw this film, without Claude Newby's verification of the facts, I also felt the film was \"slanted\". I now feel it is an accurate depiction of the events...although names and units were changed for the film. In Country (1989)\n\nDirected by Norman Jewison\n\nBruce Willis, Emily Lloyd\n\nA Vietnam veteran with PTSD helps his teenage niece who's just graduated from high school find out more about her father who died in Vietnam before she was born. The movie is really a character study about family as the two quite credible characters bond leading up to a powerful ending at the Wall. A well-acted, decent film. Bring Kleenex. Siege of Firebase Gloria (1989)\n\nDirected by Brian Trenchard-Smith\n\nWings Hauser, R. Lee Ermey\n\nA minimalist B movie that tells a straightforward story about Marines defending a disorganized isolated outpost in Vietnam during Tet 68, featuring brutalities on both sides and making the statement that the VC were just the same as us. Oh well, that passed for balance in the 1980s. Platoon Leader (1987)\n\nDirected by Aaron Norris\n\nRobert F. Lyons, Michael Dudikoff\n\nA down-to-earth film about how a green platoon leader who gets a firsthand education on the battlefield, fighting more than just the enemy. Makes an honest attempt to fairly authentically portray slang, mannerisms, and feel of Vietnam combat without left-wing political hype. The Boys in Company C (1978)\n\nDirected by Sidney J. Furie\n\nStan Shaw, Andrew Stevens\n\nShaw whips green Marine recruits into shape for Vietnam in a film that focuses on the hypocrisy and stupidity of brass and the demoralization of the soldiers. In the unlikely event that you want to learn what American youth of the post-Vietnam era have been taught about the Vietnam War, this is the film for you, with its 20/20 hindsight! Vietnam - The Ten Thousand Day War (1980)\n\nWritten by CNN correspondent Peter Arnett,\n\nNarrated by Richard Basehart\n\nWhile Ted Turner's CNN wasn't the bastion of journalistic purity, this excellent documentary's 13 episodes trace the entire course of the conflict from the close of World War II to the fall of Saigon in l975. It's worth it for the extensive archival footage and interviews with participants on both sides. \"Vietnam\" is reasonably objective journalistic history. If you don't like the narrative, turn the sound off and let the pictures speak for themselves. Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam (1988)\n\nDirected by Bill Couturié\n\nRead by Harvey Keitel, Matt Dillon, Kathleen Turner, many others.\n\nThis is a semi-documentary with real letters, newsreel footage, still photos and 60s music combining to present a human story of the war and reveal real people in real situations trying desperately to explain or understand. This powerful documentary is a crossover film that, while basically anti-war, is not explicitly anti-veteran. BAT 21 (1988)\n\nDirected by Peter Markle\n\nGene Hackman, Danny Glover\n\nFighter pilot Hackman hangs onto his radio when shot down and maintains contact with Danny Glover. Hackman must rely on his own instincts with long-distance help from Glover, to evade and escape. While theoretically based on a true story, only good acting from the stars saves the film. Go Tell the Spartans (1978)\n\nDirected by Ted Post\n\nBurt Lancaster,\n\nBurt shines as \"advisory group'' commander who in 1964 is already starting to have his doubts about the conflict. More realistic in dialogue and situation than other, more publicized, popular films on the subject. Wendell Mayes's cynically funny script is right on target. Based on Daniel Ford's novel Incident at Muc Wa. A solid film. Hanoi Hilton (1987)\n\nDirected by Lionel Chetwynd\n\nMichael Moriarty,\n\nThis has to be a decent film, because the New Republic called it \"filth\" and other reviewers panned it as \"one-sided\" for trying to tell the truth about Americans held in the infamous Hoa Lo prison in North Vietnam, the one Jane Fonda visited and found humane. Vietnam Veteran John Puzzo wrote, \"This film, produced by Lionel Chetwynd, whom I interviewed for one of my radio shows, was one of the only films that exposed the anti-war movement collaborators for what the were (and remain). In the film the woman 'activist' is not Jane Fonda, she is Cora Weiss... Chetwynd was quite nearly blackballed in Hollyweird after the fim came out. So much for freedom of expression...\" Return With Honor (1987)\n\nDirected by Jacqueline Shearer\n\nDcoumentary\n\nA documentary from PBS's American Experience series that uses intervies, vintage footage, including propaganda films shot by their captors, and other documentary techniques to bring to life the experiences of men held for up to 8-1/2 years as North Vietnamese prisoners of war. Reviews invited. Coming Home (1978)\n\nDirected by\n\nJon Voight, Jane Fonda\n\nI couldn't rate this film because I refused to see anything by Jane on Vietnam, so I asked for assistance, which was forthcoming from John Puzzo. While some have said that the film was a quasi-apology by Jane to us, don't believe that for a second! I saw a brief bit that had Jane playing out an insulting one-dimensional parody of a Vietnam Vet's wife... not surprisingly, Viet Vet Puzzo was none too complimentary. Lost Command (1966)\n\nDirected by Mark Robson\n\nAnthony Quinn\n\nQuinn stars as maverick French Paratroop LTC Raspeguy, first in Indochina at Dien Bien Phu, hardened (and bonded) even more as Viet Minh POWs, and later applying their no-holds-barred approach against Algerian Arab guerilla fighting for independence from France. Based on Jean Larteguy's excellent novel \"The Centurians.\"\n\nUncommon Valor (1983)\n\nDirected by Ted Kotcheff\n\nGene Hackman, Patrick Swayze\n\nBased on a true story, Hackman is a retired military man who gets tired of government inaction in tracking down the whereabouts of his MIA son, so he gathers and trains a rough group of Vietnam vets to launch his own mission into Laos. This film had some memorable and enjoyable moments. Missing in Action (1984)\n\nDirected by Joseph Zito\n\nChuck Norris\n\nWhat can I say? Chuck Norris is, well, Chuck Norris (aka Braddock) the one-man army single-handedly winning the Vietnam War this time. Chuck the diplomat negotiating for MIA release is unfairly accused by the North of foul play, so he puts on his ninja suit and... well, if you like Chuck Norris, this is almost as good as Octagon! First Blood (1982)\n\nDirected by Ted Kotchoff\n\nSylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy\n\nGreen Beret Medal of Honor winner John Rambo wanders into a small town to find a fellow 'Nam buddy and gets the living heck kicked out of him by the local law (Viet Vet wannabe Brian Dennehy). Rambo simply applies his defensive skills and leads a fight through the local mountains (why wouldn't they just leave him alone?). After almost a decade of pussy-footing around, Rambo let a Vietnam Vet be a hero again (well, an anti-hero at least) in an interesting film. Rambo: First Blood Part 2 (1985)\n\nDirected by George Cosmatos\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nIn this sequel, disillusioned Vietnam vet John Rambo returns to Vietnam on a Black Op to (what else) rescue MIAs and kicks Asian (and Russian) butt, taking Rocky-style punishment along the way. Purple Hearts (1984)\n\nDirected by Sidney J. Furie\n\nCheryl Ladd, Ken Wahl\n\nNavy medic and nurse fall in love. Vietnam intervenes. This is more a love story (or soapy) than a war story, but grunts weren't the only people affected by the war. The watchable film gives a good sense of the feel of the day for people in uniform and, as a female reviewer on Amazon said, \"Don't watch this movie without your Kleenex\". A Rumor of War (1980)\n\nDirected by Richard T. Heffron\n\nKeith Carradine, Jeff Daniels, Brian Dennehy, Laurence Fishburne\n\nPossibly the best ever war movie title (from Vietnam Marine veteran Philip Caputo's 1977 book), the Marine LT hero diligently performs his duty in battle after battle while questioning America's involvement until he suffers a nervous breakdown. The film trumpets the brutalization and depersonalization of troops in Vietnam, so Hollywood picked up the film rights and made the film without delay. Born on the Fourth of July (1989)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone\n\nTom Cruise\n\nOliver Stone did it again, he must have hated his tour in the Army! He managed to take a very good book, paralyzed Viet Vet Ron Kovic's \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and draw a few original but politically correct (for the day) conclusions that the book somehow \"missed\". Kovic was a gung ho Marine who came home from Vietnam paralyzed from the chest down who went through mental and physical hell before finding new meaning in the antiwar movement,. This is a powerful film, but it doesn't do the book justice. Gardens of Stone (1987)\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nJames Caan. Anjelica Huston,James Earl Jones\n\nThis film makes more sense when you understand that Coppola's son Giancarlo had recently died in a boating accident. This is a drama about the Old Guard who patrol and serve at the funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. Burned out James Caan tries to pass his cynicism onto a young man in the unit who (of course) doesn't listen, goes to OCS then Nam as a butterbar, and predictably returns to Arlington, but I won't give away the glum, gloomy plot. The Odd Angry Shot (1979)\n\nDirected by Tom Jeffrey\n\nGraham Kennedy, Bryan Brown, John Hargreaves\n\nAustralian film about Diggers in Vietnam that avoids much of the Hollywood hype (because it wasn't made in Hollywood) to realistically portray what it was really like. It follows four Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam. The title alone gives it some credibility. The Killing Fields (1984)\n\nDirected by Roland Joffe\n\nSam Waterston, Haing S. Ngor, John Malkovich\n\nA fascinating study of the brutal impact of the Khmer Rouge upon Kampuchean society. Winner of 3 Academy Awards. Anyone who doesn't believe in the Domino Theory should be forced to watch this film until they concede this painful reality might possibly be a domino! Good Morning Vietnam (1987)\n\nDirected by Barry Levinson\n\nRobin Williams, Forrest Whittaker\n\nBased on the story of AFVN radio announcer Adrian Cronauer in Vietnam. Like most Hollywood films about Vietnam, political correctness overcomes a good story and fine acting; in this case, there are really two films - the excellent first half which degenerates to make all the political messages Hollywood wanted to make during the weak second half. Air America (1990)\n\nDirected by Roger Spottiswoode\n\nMel Gibson, Robert Downey Jr\n\nAn action comedy that tries out a whimsical look at the CIA's covert smuggling operations during the Vietnam War, this film never reaches very far towards its black comedy potential."
