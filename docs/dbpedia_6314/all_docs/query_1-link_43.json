        "text": "History Through Film: The Vietnam War – Syllabus\n\nHIST A375 | USC Aiken | Maymester 2021 | M–F: 12:30–4:00\n\nDr. Sarah King | Email: Sarah.king@usca.edu\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course will explore the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement, and the war’s contested legacies through television and film clips, documentaries, and feature films. We will consider both American and Vietnamese perspectives of the war, and discuss how the war affected Americans and Vietnamese along lines of race, class, gender, and nationality. A key theme of the course is Hollywood’s role in shaping Americans’ memory of the war.\n\nThis is a 3-credit course. It can be applied to the Humanities general education and History major/minor requirements.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThis course involves not only learning about historical developments, but also developing critical reading and historical thinking skills. Throughout the course, students will:\n\ndemonstrate course-specific knowledge of the Vietnam War, including its historical context, as well as key actors and major developments\n\ndiscuss a range of American and Vietnamese perspectives\n\ndemonstrate close reading and critical analysis of written primary and secondary sources\n\ncritically analyze films in terms of representation and argument\n\ncritically analyze the ways in which sources are shaped by their authors, intended audiences, and historical context\n\npractice speaking and writing clearly and with reference to evidence\n\npractice listening respectfully to peers and engaging in respectful debate\n\ndemonstrate their understanding of academic honesty by selecting and accurately citing sources in original written work\n\nAssessment of Course Objectives\n\nThe course objectives will be assessed using different graded evaluation tools: discussion, daily writing assignments, two film reflections, and one film review.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThe course will combine lecture, discussion of readings and films, and in-class film screenings. Students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings in full. Readings and assignments are listed underneath the day they are due. Readings should be completed before class, and students should alwaysbring the assigned readings to class.\n\nRequired Texts\n\nRobert J. McMahon, ed., Major Problems in the History of the Vietnam War, 4th ed (Boston: Cengage Learning, 2008).\n\n*** Additional readings on Blackboard and linked on the syllabus\n\n*** Students will need access to a Netflix account to watch one film in week 2. Students will also need to watch one additional film of their choosing (see the list of eligible films on p. 4). This may entail paying to stream or rent the film.\n\nGrading Breakdown\n\nAttendance and Participation — 30%\n\nDaily Readings Summaries (10 x 3%) — 30%\n\nReflection on film from week 1 — 10%\n\nReflection on film from week 2. — 15%\n\nReflective film review (due May 28) — 15%\n\n*** Students must complete the three major assignments and attend at least 60% of classes in order to pass the course.\n\nA) Attendance and Participation\n\nClass attendance is mandatory and attendance will be taken daily.\n\nI will excuse absences on a case-by-case basis if you are seriously ill or have a family emergency. Except in emergency situations, out-of-town trips cannot be excused. If you are quarantined and cannot attend class, but are well enough to work from home, you are expected to keep up with the readings and make up missed classes. (See section “D” below for information on making up missed classes so they do not count as absences.)\n\nYour attendance and participation grade is based on both your attendance and your contributions to class discussions. To participate effectively, you must be prepared, which means that you have completed the readings before class begins and you have the readings with you. Blackboard readings should be printed out and read ahead of time or be accessible on a device (not a phone) you bring to class.\n\nYour participation grade is also dependent on showing respect for others in the classroom. It is important to listen attentively when others are speaking and to silence your phone and not check it during class. If you have an emergency and need to check your phone, please let me know before class begins. Lateness will also affect your participation grade. If you know that you will be late or need to leave early for a particular class, please inform me ahead of time.\n\nB) Assignments\n\nIn this course you will write ten daily summaries of the readings due each day. These summaries are due at the beginning of class; they cannot be submitted after class. You have 11 opportunities to write 10 of these summaries. These should be 1 page, single-spaced.\n\nYou will also write 2 reflections on films we watched in class. You are encouraged to write these soon after the film so the material is fresh. These should be 2 to 3 pages, double spaced, and should respond to the “Film Reflection” prompts on Blackboard.\n\nYour final assignment is to write a film review. You may choose any film from the attached list. (See section “C” below.) You will need to stream, rent, or buy the film, watch it on your own, and write an original review of the film. Your review should be 3 to 4 pages, double spaced, and it should respond to the prompt and guidelines titled “Film Review” on Blackboard.\n\nThe reflections and review must be submitted to Safe Assign (via Blackboard) on the due date. Each day that an assignment is not uploaded to Safe Assign will count as late.\n\nThe reflections and review should use Chicago-style citations. Please use the citation guide within the Film Review instructions on Blackboard. You may also use this link to the Chicago-Style Citation Quick Guide.\n\nYou must seek permission to use outside sources. As a rule, you should not consult websites for definitions, ideas, or facts. If you need to define a term or provide historical context, use the textbook or your lecture notes or email me with questions.\n\nLate assignments will receive a 3% deduction per weekday.\n\nC) List of Eligible Films for the Film Review Assignment (due May 28, 15%)\n\nThe Green Berets (1968)\n\nM*A*S*H* (1970)\n\nWinter Soldier (1972)\n\nHearts and Minds (1974)\n\nLittle Girl of Hanoi (1975)\n\nComing Home (1978)\n\nThe Deer Hunter (1978)\n\nApocalypse Now (1979)\n\nFirst Blood [Rambo I] (1982)\n\nRambo: First Blood Part II (1985)\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nHamburger Hill (1987)\n\nGood Morning, Vietnam (1987)\n\nCasualties of War (1989)\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1989)\n\nHeaven & Earth (1993)\n\nWe Were Soldiers (2002)\n\nThe Quiet American (2002)\n\nD) Making up Missed Work/ Obtaining Extensions\n\nIf you have an absence that is not excused under the attendance policy (see “A”), you may, in consultation with me, make up your absence by submitting a 1-page, single-spaced summary of the film we watched that day. You are responsible for renting the film if it is not available through the library. Please note that by submitting a summary you are still missing lecture content and the benefits of discussion, so this is not a perfect substitute for attending class; however, it does allow you to make up missed classes in terms of your attendance and participation grade.\n\nIf you think you might need an extension on a film reflection, ask for an extension ahead of time.\n\nE) Bonus Points\n\nBonus points will frequently be awarded to students who have the required readings with them in class. Having the readings with you, therefore, will not only help you participate more effectively, but will result in bonus points added to your daily participation grade.\n\nF) Letter Grades\n\nContent Advisory\n\nWe will be reading, watching, and discussing historical events that are disturbing. While I will try to provide specific content warnings, students are advised that numerous sources in this course discuss or depict disturbing events or mature content.\n\nPlease note: In this version, I have removed several boilerplate, Covid-related, and institution-specific sections from the actual syllabus, including Communication Policy, Accessibility, Academic Integrity, and Additional Rules and Guidelines, and a Covid-19 Addendum.\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nWEEK 1\n\nMonday: Introduction; The Vietnamese Struggle for Independence to 1960\n\nIn-class film: The Vietnam War: A Film by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick (2017), Episode 1 (85 minutes)\n\nTuesday: Postwar American Society, the Cold War, and the Best and the Brightest\n\nIn-class film: WWII film clips; The Vietnam War, Episode 2 (86 minutes)\n\nReadings:\n\nMajor Problems, “Eisenhower Explains the Domino Theory, 1954” (p. 84-5); “Eldridge Durbrow Assesses the Diem Regime, 1957” (p. 89-90); “An Early U.S. Army Advisor Remembers His Experiences (1962-63), 1981” (p. 126); Seth Jacobs, “The Religious Roots of U.S. Support for Ngo Dinh Diem” (p. 104-11)\n\nJohn F.
