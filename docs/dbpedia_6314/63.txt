THE VIETNAM WAR is a ten-part, 18-hour documentary film series

directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick that will air on PBS in

September 2017.

In an immersive 360-degree narrative, Burns and Novick tell the epic

story of the Vietnam War as it has never before been told on film. THE

VIETNAM WAR features testimony from nearly 80 witnesses, including

many Americans who fought in the war and others who opposed it, as

well as Vietnamese combatants and civilians from both the winning and

losing sides.

Ten years in the making, the series brings the war and the chaotic

epoch it encompassed viscerally to life. Written by Geoffrey C. Ward,

produced by Sarah Botstein, Novick and Burns, it includes rarely seen,

digitally re-mastered archival footage from sources around the globe,

photographs taken by some of the most celebrated photojournalists of

the 20th Century, historic television broadcasts, evocative home

movies, revelatory audio recordings from inside the Kennedy, Johnson

and Nixon administrations and more than 100 iconic musical recordings

by many of the greatest artists of the era.

The film will be accompanied by an unprecedented outreach and public

engagement program, providing opportunities for communities to

participate in a national conversation about what happened during the

Vietnam War, what went wrong and what lessons are to be learned. In

addition, there will be a robust interactive website and an

educational initiative designed to engage teachers and students in

multiple platforms.
