This Friday marks the Chicago run of “The War at Home,” the 1979 documentary about the antiwar movement in Madison, WI during the Vietnam War. Directed by Glenn Silber and Barry Alexander Brown, the film has just received a 4K restoration by IndieCollect, upgrading the film’s original 16mm format. Since the New York Film Festival, the restoration of “The War at Home” has been traveling the country, previously playing in New York City, San Francisco, Detroit, Berkeley, Los Angeles and Portland.

The movie played Chicago back in 1979 as part of the Chicago International Film Festival, and would go on to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Roger praised the film after its first screening in the city, saying that “‘The War at Home’ is an extraordinary documentary about the last time we needed to overcome.”

Co-director Glenn Silber will be present at the Gene Siskel Film Center for the Friday and Saturday weekend screenings. He’ll be joined by director Bill Siegel (“The Trials of Mohammed Ali”) and political organizer Heather Booth.
