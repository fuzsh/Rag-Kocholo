        "text": "Charles Francis Adams III (born Aug. 2, 1866, Quincy, Mass., U.S.—died June 11, 1954, Boston, Mass.) was an American lawyer and businessman, government official, yachtsman, and philanthropist who made Harvard University one of the most abundantly endowed academic institutions.\n\nAdams was the son of the lawyer and historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. (1835–1915), as well as great-grandson of the sixth U.S. president and great-great-grandson of the second. He was educated at Adams Academy in Quincy and at Harvard (A.B., 1888; LL.B., 1892) and took up the practice of law in Boston, specializing in estates and trusts. From 1900 until his death he served as director on the boards of dozens of American banks and corporations.\n\nIn 1898 Adams was elected treasurer of the Corporation of Harvard College, and for the next 30 years he had charge of the school’s capital funds. During his tenure Harvard’s endowment grew from $15,000,000 to $120,000,000, largely as a consequence of his financial and managerial skills. When he resigned as treasurer in 1929, Harvard was well prepared to face the ensuing Great Depression. Later, Adams was president of the Harvard Alumni Association (1933–34) and of the Harvard Board of Overseers (1937–43)."
