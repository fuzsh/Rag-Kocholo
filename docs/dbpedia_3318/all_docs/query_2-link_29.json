        "text": "Detroit — For decades, the Rev. Charles Gilchrist Adams was one of the most prominent preachers in the country, building a following with resonant sermons and community-based initiatives that attracted thousands to Detroit’s historic Hartford Memorial Baptist Church.\n\nThroughout that time as a formidable force in Michigan's largest city, the revered orator known as the \"Harvard Whooper\" for his alma mater and a signature, thundering preaching style addressed audiences around the globe and gained the attention of U.S. presidents.\n\nSome said they believe that manner and approach was as divine as his message.\n\n\"Reverend Adams was no ordinary reverend; he was a warrior for justice and a beacon of hope for many, extending beyond his congregation at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church for over 50 years,\" Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield said in a Thursday statement.\n\n\"Rev. Adams has had an impact that stretches far beyond Detroit, touching the lives of countless individuals and leaving an indelible mark in our nation's history through his community service initiatives and advocacy work.\"\n\nThe city icon died Wednesday following a long bout with pneumonia and after cardiac arrest, said his sister, Edith Clifton, who added that he was surrounded by his family. He was 86.\n\n\"He was my only sibling and my best friend,\" said Clifton, 88. \"We talked almost every day.\"\n\nAppointed Hartford's third pastor in 1969, Adams pushed the house of worship to become one of the most popular in the Motor City.\n\nMembers said his richly delivered sermons and community focus swelled attendance from 400 to nearly 10,000 at its peak. The church had to relocate to its current location, near the Lodge Freeway, in the late 1970s.\n\nHartford, which Michigan historical officials have recognized as the first church for African Americans on the city’s northwest side, became a desirable funeral site for high-profile singers, educators, activists and others.\n\nThe site also witnessed a string of politicians greeting attendees on the campaign trail.\n\nThe death of the church's award-winning preacher came four years after he officially retired and his son, the Rev. Charles Christian Adams, replaced him as the head of Hartford.\n\n“Detroiters have lost a great champion and a great man,\" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe Rev. Adams, the mayor added, \"was a tireless fighter for the people of Detroit, in particular our seniors and children.\"\n\nA storied start\n\nBorn in Detroit on Dec. 13, 1936, the Rev. Adams was raised in Hartford Memorial.\n\nAs he once recalled in an interview with The Detroit News, the Rev. Adams believed he was born to preach and told his mother so at age 4. As a teen, he attended services there and at neighboring New Light Baptist.\n\nHe attended Detroit Public Schools and graduated from Cass Technical High School.\n\nThe future leader went on to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, a historically Black college and university, for two years, then transferred to the University of Michigan and Harvard Divinity School. After graduating with honors from both institutions, the Rev. Adams became a doctoral fellow at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.\n\n\"He shared with me all the scholarly things that he was involved in,\" Clifton said. \"All of the time that he was at Harvard and he was away. We would read the same books.\"\n\nThe Rev. Adams emerged in the religious community in 1962 when he became pastor of the historic Concord Baptist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Boston, Massachusetts, according to relatives.\n\nBack home in Detroit, he nurtured his flock and community, his followers said ― forming an impressive foundation of relationships.\n\n\"Our family has been intertwined with the Adams all of our lives,\" said Cynthia Harris, 75, who organized celebrations for the pastor's 50th anniversary with the church and remains involved as a trustee, usher and assistant clerk.\n\n\"My mother taught Pastor Adams how to tie his shoes. My mother's sister and Pastor's mother were best friends. And Pastor's grandmother and my grandfather were very good friends.\"\n\nAfter her grandfather's death when she was 12, Harris said she vividly remembers the Rev. Adams comforting her at the funeral procession. \"I can remember 'Sonny,' what we used to call him back then, standing on the corner with his hands up praying, telling me that it was going to be OK,\" she said.\n\nThe pastor's sermons were memorably moving, Harris said.\n\n\"It was just a feeling that you got listening to him that he wanted to share God's word,\" said the Hartford congregant of more than 60 years. \"And it was wonderful.\"\n\nSheffield recalled his \"preaching brought the heavens down to earth and brought countless souls closer to God!\"\n\n'A social justice warrior'\n\nThe Rev. Adams' tenure was also marked by a stream of efforts to boost the community, including meal deliveries for seniors; a Head Start program that once had 1,000 youths; as well as tutoring, a bible studies institute and renting homes to families.\n\nAmong Hartford's most successful ventures was purchasing nearby land on Seven Mile, which sparked redevelopment and the arrival of restaurants and businesses such as the Home Depot. Members said hundreds of jobs were created.\n\nThe Rev. Adams also spearheaded a collaboration with the Presbyterian Villages of Michigan to launch the Hartford Village senior community.\n\nThe pastor \"did more than offer words of hope and inspiration from his pulpit; he created opportunity by purchasing and developing land around Hartford, including the Hartford Village senior citizen community,\" Duggan said Thursday. \"We were fortunate to have him in our city and in our lives, and he will be greatly missed.\"\n\nThe reverend earned renown for calling attention to pressing issues affecting his flock and the world at large, in addition to supporting social justice initiatives.\n\nThe Rev. Adams became the Detroit Branch NAACP president in 1984 and led a boycott against Dearborn businesses in protest of city policies barring non-residents from its parks.\n\nUnder him, the NAACP went to court and the discriminatory measure was overturned, Hartford Memorial officials said.\n\nFor several years before her death in 2005, Hartford paid the rent of civil rights icon Rosa Parks — an act the Rev. Adams facilitated, The News reported.\n\nChurch members said they were instrumental in helping South African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela visit Detroit in 1990 after his release from prison. Some even visited South Africa in 1994 to observe the nation’s first multiracial election.\n\nHartford also worked to raise money to provide clean water in Gambia. In 2016, Hartford joined regional churches to deliver 6,000 bottles of water to Flint during the city's lead-tainted water crisis.\n\nEbony magazine named him one of the nation's greatest Black preachers and most influential African Americans in 1994.\n\nHis dedication to outreach and service amazed his congregants and associates.\n\n“If it was a need, if it was a call, he was out there. He was a leader, like Martin Luther King Jr. — a fighter out there fighting for what he believed in,” said Audrey La Salle-Brown, a longtime friend and trustee at Hartford, where she has attended since 1977.\n\n“He just was a giver. The most giving, loving person I’ve ever seen.”\n\nLasting legacy, influence\n\nOver the years, Adams' stature grew enough that he was summoned to speak around the world.\n\nThe former president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention addressed the United Nations on South African apartheid in 1989.\n\nIn the next decade, he accompanied President Bill Clinton for the signing of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty. The Rev. Adams later went to the White House to meet with President Barack Obama.\n\nAt his home pulpit or elsewhere, he also eulogized notable figures and dignitaries such as Parks, former Detroit Mayor Coleman Young and singer Ortheia Barnes-Kennerly.\n\nOver the years, his church has welcomed then Vice President Al Gore, Metro Detroit attorney Geoffrey Fieger and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nIn 2007, the Rev. Adams returned to Harvard as its first William and Lucille Nickerson Professor of Ethics and Ministry.\n\nHe earned many honors in his lifetime.\n\nThe Urban League of Detroit and Southeastern Michigan named him a Distinguished Warrior. In 2019, he received the Detroit Branch NAACP James Weldon Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award. The News also named him a Michiganian of the Year.\n\nHis taped sermons gained popularity online, forging relationships between worshipers everywhere. Hartford members recalled meeting worshipers across the country who knew him from those appearances or word of mouth.\n\nHe retired from the iconic church in 2019 after more than 50 years in the pulpit.\n\nNews of the Rev. Adams' death spread quickly on social media, where people shared memories, photos and tributes honoring the beloved \"pulpit giant.\"\n\nLeaders among Detroit's Black church community described him as \"a preacher's preacher\" and a \"prince of the pulpit.\"\n\n\"Adams could start a message, and within five minutes, the people would be on their feet; that's just how impactful he was,\" said the Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit Branch and pastor of Detroit’s Fellowship Chapel. \"I pray for his son, Christian, and his family and church. I know he had been out of the pulpit for a while, but the pulpit was always in him.\"\n\nIn addition to his sister and son, the Rev. Adams is survived by his wife, Agnes Adams; and daughter Dr. Tara Adams Washington.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, relatives said.\n\nAnthony said the Rev. Adams would be remembered most as \"an uncompromising voice of that what was courageous, rooted in justice, and using the Black Church as a voice to uplift people.\"\n\nBishop Charles H. Ellis III, senior pastor at Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, called Adams a \"social justice warrior for the marginalized.\"\n\nEllis' church hosted the Parks funeral, where the Rev. Adams was remembered for a speech that was punctuated by reciting \"thank you\" in different languages.\n\n\"A true friend indeed to the Ellis and Greater Grace Temple families,\" Ellis said, adding that the two congregations were neighbors for more than 20 years while his church was located at Seven Mile and Schaefer Highway before moving near Telegraph in 2002.\n\nTo his countless parishioners, the Rev. Adams was a \"man born to be a minister\" and remained an unforgettable figure whose efforts inspired them.\n\n\"He was a friend, he was a mentor, he was a public figure, he was a brother,\" Harris said. \"... Just a man of all seasons, and that's what we considered him.\"\n\njaimery@detroitnews.com\n\namunoz@detroitnews.com\n\nmhicks@detroitnews.com"
