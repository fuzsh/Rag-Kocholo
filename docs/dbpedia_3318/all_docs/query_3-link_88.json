        "text": "The Rev. Dr. Charles Gilchrist Adams, BD ’64, the former William and Lucille Nickerson Professor of the Practice of Ethics and Ministry at Harvard Divinity School, died November 29, 2023, at the age of 86.\n\nAdams was one of the country's most influential preachers, and practiced ministry for over half a century. As the head of Hartford Memorial Baptist Church (HMBC) in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan, Rev. Adams grew his congregation to over 10,000 members and organized many more to provide improved social support for people throughout the Detroit area. One of many examples of such support is the Hartford Agape House, where members of the HMBC can access programs for medical and legal referrals, college preparation, and an array of other services for community members ranging from children to seniors.\n\nHDS Interim Dean David Holland said Adams lived a full life in service of others.\n\n“Reverend Adams was a renowned religious leader, community advocate, and honored graduate of Harvard Divinity School—as well as a deeply loving family man and dedicated friend to many. He was also an exemplary and beloved member of the HDS faculty,” said Holland in a message to the HDS community. “Most assuredly, the projects he began will go on because of the lives he touched and the legacy he leaves.”\n\nAfter earning his Harvard degree in 1964, Adams returned in 2007 to HDS where he taught for five years. An exceptional pastor, leader, and brilliant scholar, he was recognized by HDS as a Gomes Distinguished Alumni Honoree in 2017.\n\nAt HDS, a professorship is named in honor of Adams. Terrence L. Johnson, the Charles G. Adams Professor of African American Religious Studies at HDS, recalled how Adams was an influential leader not only in the Black church, but also in Detroit.\n\n“Rev. Adams was a mouthpiece of the biblical prophets to the historic Black church. In his sermons, he skillfully weaved together histories of tragedy and biblical narratives of hope and resistance to remind the church of its obligation to heal and transform the body of Christ,” said Johnson. “He will be remembered as one the most brilliant preachers of the late-twentieth century. But he was also an outstanding visionary leader in Detroit, where he shepherded the establishment of new businesses, schools, and housing in African American communities ignored by influential developers.”\n\nAdams was fondly remembered at HDS and beyond, with leaders in Michigan mourning his passing. More information on Adams’s life and impact can be read in an obituary by The Detroit News.\n\n—by Amie Montemurro and Michael Naughton"
