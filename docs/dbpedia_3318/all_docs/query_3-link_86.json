        "text": "Last Updated on May 1, 2021 by\n\nGeorge H. Adams, of Hill, the senior proprietor of the Hill Needle Factory, was born at Haverhill, Mass., son of the late Harrison Adams, the founder of the needle industry in this place. The first of the Adams family in this country was Enoch Adams, the great-grandfather of George H. He came to America from England, and settled, first in Newbury, and afterward in Salisbury, N.H. His last years were spent in the western part of the latter town, near Kearsarge Mountain. His son, Russel, after his marriage with Susanna Fifield, moved to Hill, where a family of eight children were born to him. Of these the only survivor is Enoch, who resides in Belmont, N.H.\n\nIn early life Harrison Adams was a shoemaker and worked in Massachusetts. Subsequently on account of failing health he returned to Hill and carried on a farm here for about fifteen years. He moved into the village proper in 1866, after which he had no regular occupation for several years. He then started the needle business with his sons and others, and afterward retained an interest in the concern until his death at the age of seventy-five years. He was the second Republican to represent this town in the State legislature, and he served in the capacity of Selectman and in other town offices. A devoted member of the Congregational church, at the time of his death he had been senior Deacon, for some time. His wife, in maidenhood Margaret Morse, was the mother of George H. and Charles F. Adams.\n\nGeorge H. Adams, the elder son of Harrison Adams, has always been a progressive and active man. Educated in the public schools, he afterward worked on a farm and then in a grocery store at Charlestown, Mass. Subsequently, after working for six years on the farm of his wife’s father, he bought an interest in the needle factory, and has made that his chief object of attention since. In 1868 he married Miss Abbie Shaw, of Sanbornton, N.H. Mr. and Mrs. Adams have had four children, of whom Erving died when a little more than three years old. The others are: Mary K., Abbie J., and Frank B. Mr. Adams represented the town in the legislature in 1891. He is a Mason and is affiliated with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Like his father, he is an esteemed member of the Congregational church. In politics he is a Republican, and he cast his first vote for General Grant in 1868."
