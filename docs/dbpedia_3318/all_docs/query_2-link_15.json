        "text": "85, after a courageous battle with cancer, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, surrounded by his loving family.\n\nCharlie was born on June 29, two minutes after his identical twin brother, Stanley, who he remained close with until the last moment. He was a member of the U.S. Navy for four years and often talked about his love of photography beginning during that time. He continued his love for photography by working with film during his career at Eastman Kodak Company. He retired in 1991 and after a short stint with boating began bi-annual trips to Maui continuing through 2017. Known as a loving and funny person, Charlie could melt away anybodyâ€™s bad day with one joke or funny story. Our favorite story will always be how he met and had his first date with the love of his life, whom he married in November of 1957.\n\nIn addition to his cherished wife, Evelyn (Benton) Adams, Charlie is survived by four daughters, Cheryl (Jeff) Luke, Karen (Jim) Scott, Wendy (Fred) Castiglione, Lisa (Tim) Moore; 13 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren; brothers Stanley Adams and Richard (Helen) Adams; sister-in-law Mary (Benton) Lennon; many cousins, nephews, nieces and special friends.\n\nCharlie was preceded in death by his parents, Stanley and Estelle (Wenzel) Adams; sisters, Nancy (Don) Francis and Barbara Adams; brothers-in-law Raymond (Jane) Benton and Jim Lennon.\n\nTo celebrate his life, a memorial mass will be held for Charlie on Saturday, June 19, 2021, 11:00am, at St. Charles Borromeo Church, 3003 Dewey Ave, Rochester, NY 14616. Masks are required to enter the church. Vaccinated attendees may remove their mask once seated. Non-vaccinated attendees will remain masked throughout the service and seated in a specified section.\n\nBurial will be private.\n\nIn the absence of calling hours, we invite you to share with us a favorite memory and/or story at CharlieAdamsStories@gmail.com."
