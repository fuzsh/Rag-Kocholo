        "text": "For other people named Charles Francis Adams, see Charles Francis Adams.\n\nCharles Francis Adams Jr. (May 27, 1835 – May 20, 1915) was a member of the prominent Adams family, and son of Charles Francis Adams, Sr. He served as a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he was a railroad regulator and executive, an author of historical works, and a member of the Massachusetts Park Commission.\n\nEducation and Civil War service[]\n\nAdams was born into a family with a long legacy in American public life. He was the great-grandson of United States President John Adams, and the grandson of president John Quincy Adams. His father Charles Francis Adams, Sr.[1] was a lawyer, politician, diplomat, and writer.\n\nAdams graduated from Harvard University in 1856.\n\nAdams served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry on December 28, 1861. He was promoted to captain on December 1, 1862. He fought with distinction during the Gettysburg Campaign, where his company was heavily engaged at the Battle of Aldie. When the regiments 3-years enlistment ended it was reduced to a battalion; and Adams was mustered out of service on September 1, 1864.[2]\n\nOn September 8, 1864 he was commissioned as the lieutenant colonel of the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry (officially designated \"5th Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry\"). He was promoted to colonel and assumed command of the regiment on March 14, 1865, shortly before the end of the war.[3][4] When he assumed command the regiment was assigned guarding Confederate prisoners of war at Point Lookout, Maryland. Adams, who wished to lead his regiment in combat, was able to get horses for his regiment and had it reassigned to front line duty during the closing days of the campaign against Richmond. Adams wrote in his autobiography that he regretted having his unit reassigned since he came to the conclusion that the regiment's black soldiers were ill suited for combat duty. He led his regiment into Richmond shortly after it was captured in April 1865. Adams returned to Massachusetts in May due to illness (probably dysentery) and resigned from the Army on August 1, 1865.\n\nOn July 9, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Colonel Adams for the award of the rank of brevet (honorary) brigadier general, United States Volunteers, \"for distinguished gallantry and efficiency at the battles of Secessionville, South Carolina and South Mountain and Antietam, Maryland and for meritorious services during the war\" to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U. S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.[5][6]\n\nAdams was a Veteran Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS).\n\nPost–Civil War activity[]\n\nOn May 8, 1865, he married Mary Elizabeth Ogden, daughter of Abram Ogden of New York City, NY. The couple had three daughters and twin sons: Mary Ogden (\"Molly\") Adams, Louisa Catherine Adams, Elizabeth Ogden (\"Elise\") Adams, John Adams (1875–1964), and Henry Adams (1875–1951), both of whom graduated Harvard in 1898.[7][8][9]\n\nFollowing the Civil War, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Railroad Commission. There he attempted to persuade (rather than coerce) railroads into compliance with accepted business norms. Thomas McCraw called Adams's approach to regulation \"the Sunshine Commission\" since the purpose of the commission was to expose the corrupt business practices in hopes that, once out in the open, the businessmen would be shamed into mending their ways. It was in this vein that he wrote Chapters of Erie. However, true to his regulatory philosophy, he favored the protection of businessmen over that of the consumers. He saw regulation as necessary to protect investors and other businessmen from the capriciousness of a hostile public or the machinations of other unscrupulous stock jobbers.[10] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1871.[11]\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad[]\n\nAdams was president of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1884 to 1890, having previously become widely known as an authority on the management of railways. However, he left his office due to financial problems.[12] Among his writings are Railroads, Their Origin and Problems (1878).\n\nMassachusetts Park Commission[]\n\nFrom 1893 to 1895 he was chairman of the Massachusetts Park Commission, and as such took a prominent part in planning the present park system of the state.[4] He was influential in establishing the Blue Hills Reservation and the Middlesex Fells Reservation.\n\nSingle-tax supporter[]\n\nIn 1900, he wrote a letter to the President of the Massachusetts Single Tax League, declaring himself a supporter of the reform Henry George had proposed. An excerpt of that letter appeared in The Outlook, December 15, 1900.\n\nHistorical writings[]\n\nAfter 1874, he devoted much of his time to the study of American history, and in recognition of his work in this field was chosen president of the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1895, and of the American Historical Association in 1901. His writings and addresses both on problems of railway management and on historical subjects frequently gave rise to widespread controversy.[4] Adams also wrote an autobiography which he completed in 1912 and which was published posthumously in 1916. At the beginning of the autobiography is a memorial address about Adams written by Henry Cabot Lodge.\n\nRelations[]\n\nHis siblings include: older sister Louisa Catherine Adams, wife of Charles Kuhn, of Philadelphia; older brother [Hon.] John Quincy Adams II, father of Charles Adams, III; historian Henry Brooks Adams,;[7] Arthur Adams, who died young during their childhood; Mary Adams, who married Henry Parker Quincy, of Dedham, MA; and historian Peter Chardon Brooks Adams, of Beverly Farms, MA. who married Evelyn Davis.\n\nDeath and burial[]\n\nAdams died May 20, 1915, a week shy of his 80th birthday. He is buried in Mount Wollaston Cemetery in Quincy, Massachusetts. His grave can be found in the Old Section, Lot 337.[13]\n\nWorks[]\n\nChapters of Erie, and Other Essays (New York, 1871), with brother Henry Adams\n\nRailroads, Their Origin and Problems (New York, 1878)\n\nNotes on Railroad Accidents (New York, 1879)\n\nRichard Henry Dana: A Biography (Boston, 1891)\n\nThree Episodes of Massachusetts History (Boston, 1892), a work which gives an account of the settlement of Boston Bay, of the Antinomian controversy, and of church and town government in early Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts: Its Historians and Its History (Boston, 1893)\n\nAntinomianism in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, 1636-38 (1894).\n\n“Imperialism” and “The Tracks of Our Forefathers” at Project Gutenberg (1898).\n\nLife of Charles Francis Adams (Boston, 1900), in the American Statesmen Series\n\nLee at Appomattox, and Other Papers (1902)\n\nCharles Francis Adams, 1835-1915: An Autobiography (1916)\n\nFamily tree[]\n\nThe following is a selective family tree of notable members of the Adams family relative to Charles Francis Adams Jr.:\n\nPresident John Quincy AdamsLouisa Catherine JohnsonPeter Chardon BrooksAbigail Brown Charles Francis Adams, Sr.Abigail Brown BrooksGeorge Caspar CrowninshieldHarriet Sears Charles Francis Adams Jr.John Quincy Adams IIFrances Cadwalader Crowninshield John Quincy Adams IIIGeorge Caspar AdamsCharles Francis Adams IIIFrances LoveringFrances C.
