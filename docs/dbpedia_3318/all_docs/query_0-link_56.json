Other pioneers named Searls, Searl, and Searles had preceded Robert to the New World: John Searles of Springfield Massachusetts by 1637. Philip Searl of Roxbury Massachusetts. A John Searls married Elizabeth on 09-19-1780 in the Church of Christ in Salem (Westchester) New York. This John may be a nephew to ancestor John. A Lott Searls and Martha Miller, executrix of the estate of Silas Miller, of Bedford (Westchester) New York, sold real estate to Lemuel Light on 12-29-1787. John's father may have been John. The father John supposedly had at least three sons: Adam (who had six children), John (the ancestor), and Caleb.

A list of North Castle residents who enlisted as soldiers in the War of the Rebellion included a Daniel M. Searles and a Benjamin D. Searles.

In extreme northwestern North Dakota is the town of Sarles. In 1910 the population was 28. The town was named after the ninth governor of North Dakota, Elmore Yocum Sarles. He was born 1859 in Wonewoc WI and died 1929 in Hillsboro ND."
