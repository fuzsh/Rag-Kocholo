        "text": "Published by The University of the State of New York/The State Education Department from 1887 through 2010, the New York State Museum Bulletin was the Museum’s flagship, peer-reviewed publication series. Bulletins presented the results of original research in archaeology, biology, ethnology, geology, history, and paleontology by Museum staff and scientists and historians from other organizations. The series included monographs and compiled volumes.\n\nSince 2010 the Museum has changed its primary publication standard to its open-access, electronic series including the New York State Museum Record and Cultural Resource Survey Program series.\n\nMost of the Museum’s Bulletins are now available freely on-line as scans of the original documents via the New York State Library’s on-line catalog. Clicking on the title will take you to the Bulletins catalog which allows downloading of the Bulletin’s scan. Some of the more recent Bulletins are available as pdfs made from the original electronic files. Clicking on those titles will initiate the download."
