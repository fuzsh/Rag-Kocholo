        "text": "Abate v. County of Erie, 152 A.D.3d 177, 54 N.Y.S. 3d 821, Appellate Division, Fourth Department (June 30, 2017) - A request for 911 recordings was made by petitioner via CPLR Article 31 discovery. While court acknowledged that such recordings may not be disclosed in response to a FOIL request, the court “thus join[ed] our colleagues in the Second Department in concluding that County Law § 308 (4) ‘is not intended to prohibit the disclosure of matter that is material and relevant in a civil litigation, accessible by a so-ordered subpoena or directed by a court to be disclosed in a discovery order’ (Anderson, 134 AD3d at 1062).”\n\nMatter of Abdur-Rashid v. New York City Police Dept., 31 N.Y.3d 217, 2018 N.Y. Slip Op. 02206, Court of Appeals (March 29, 2018) - Petitioner requested documents from the NYPD and police commissioner pertaining to investigations and surveillance activities of the NYPD. Respondent provided a “Glomar” response (neither acknowledging nor denying existence of records). The Appellate Division held: “we do not suggest that any FOIL request for NYPD records would justify a Glomar response. \"An agency resisting disclosure of the requested records has the burden of proving the applicability of [a FOIL] exemption\" and must submit \"a detailed affidavit showing that the information logically falls within the claimed exemptions\" and \"the basis for [the agency's] claim that it can be required neither to confirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records\" (Wilner, 592 F3d at 68 [internal quotation marks omitted]). In view of the heightened law enforcement and public safety concerns identified in the affidavits of NYPD's intelligence chief, Glomar responses were appropriate here.” The Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division and stated: “Thus, in the circumstances presented here, when confronted with a targeted FOIL request of this nature, a police agency must be permitted to give a uniform response —to decline to confirm or deny the existence of responsive material in either scenario—on the rationale that whether or not it is investigating a particular person or organization constitutes information that is itself statutorily exempt from disclosure.”\n\nMatter of Acme Bus Corp. v. County of Suffolk – 136 A.D.3d 896 (2nd Dept. 2016). February 17, 2016 - The petitioner bus company submitted a proposal in response to respondents request for proposals for transportation services but was not successful. Sought records relating to the request for proposals, but was denied access because it “would impair present or imminent contract awards or collective bargaining negotiations.” Petitioner filed an Article 78 but prior to the decision the respondents disclosed the documents, which left only attorney’s fees issue to be decided. Held that a petitioner may be entitled to attorney’s fees when it substantially prevails and the agency had no reasonable basis for the denial or did not respond within the statutory time. In this case, since all the proposals were submitted and acted upon at the time of the request, there was no reasonable basis for denial and attorney’s fees were awarded.\n\nAlbany Custom Floors, Inc. v. O'Shea, (pdf) Supreme Court, Albany County, January 28, 1977 -- Customer list of competitors involved in competitive bidding held available in conjunction with §174 of the State Finance Law. Original Law: §88(3)(a), (d) and (e), §88(7), §88(1)\n\nAllen v. Strojnowski, 129 AD2d 700, 514 NYS2d 463 (2nd Dept 1987); appeal denied 70 NY2d 871, 523 NYS2d 493 (1987) -- Held that physical evidence, such as tools, clothing, does not constitute a \"record\"; affirmed denial of names and addresses and statements of confidential witness and certain investigative techniques used for processing a homicide scene; Court cited opinion of Committee; has been appeals to Court of Appeals.\n\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Siebert, 110 Misc.2d 744, 442 NYS2d 855 (New York County 1981) - ABC News was granted access to names and business addresses of the principals of check cashing businesses licensed by Banking Department; other aspects of license applications, such as residence addresses, were denied on the basis of §87(2)(f) in order to protect the lives and safety of applicants and their families. Current Law: §87(2)(f)\n\nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets, (pdf) Supreme Court, Albany County, May 10, 1989 - Overturned agency's denial of a request for names and addresses of mink and fox farmers; Court agreed with opinion of COG advising that provisions concerning privacy can be asserted only with respect to personal information relating to natural persons and held that \"the names and business addresses of individuals or entities engaged in animal farming for profit do not constitute information of a private nature, and this conclusion is not changed by the fact that a person's business address may also be the address of his or her residence.\"\n\nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Board of Trustees of State University of New York 184 AD2d 508, 584 NYS2d 198 (2nd Dept 1992) - In related decision regarding Open Meetings Law, Appellate Division found that entity's powers and functions were derived from federal law and that, therefore, it was not subject to that statute; using same reasoning, it was held that the entity is not subject to Freedom of Information Law.\n\nAnonymous v. Board of Education for Mexico Central School District, 162 Misc.2d 300, 616 NYS2d 867 (New York County 1994) - Teacher sought to enjoin District from disclosing any portion of settlement agreement pursuant to which charges of misconduct had been settled, citing lower court decision in LaRocca, which has since been modified. Court held that any confidentiality agreement in conflict with FOIL would be void as against public policy, that there is no blanket exception in the FOIL regarding personnel files, that the settlement is not an \"employment history\", that the agreement \"is not information in which petitioner has any reasonable expectation of privacy where the agreement contains the teacher's admission to much of the misconduct charged\", that the agreement is \"tantamount to a final agency determination.\" See LaRocca, Geneva Printing, Buffalo Evening News.\n\nApplegate v. Fischer, 89 AD3d 1303, 936 NYS2d 239 (3d Dept. 2011) - Court held that copyright concerns were insufficient to justify a denial of access to manufacturer's training manuals concerning maintenance and testing of urinalysis machine. Also, agency failed to justify denial of request for tester's log book information.\n\nArchdeacon v. Town of Oyster Bay, 12 Misc.3d 438, 813 NYS2d 289 (Nassau County 2006) - Citing opinion of Committee, court held that financial disclosure statements filed with Town are available for inspection and copying, despite local law indicating that the statements were available for inspection only. Agreed with Committee opinion that FOIL governs, not Executive Law, which pertains to State Ethics Commission.\n\nArrow Electronics v Long Island Power Authority, Supreme Court, New York County, February 28, 2002 – Substantial competitive injury would likely flow to agency if agency were required to disclose negotiated terms, pricing details, boundary rights, pricing and costs, where agency negotiates in the electric power spot and futures market, is engaged in actual competition in the wholesale and retail electric markets, and has demonstrated that such information is otherwise unavailable. Substantial competitive injury would likely flow to submitting commercial entity if agency were to disclose cost confidential proprietary and pricing information, and project term sheet, which would unfairly benefit competitors, giving them an unfair competitive edge in the market place.\n\nMatter of Asian American Legal Defense & Education Fund v. New York City Police Dept., 125 A.D.3d 531, Appellate Division, First Department (Feb. 24, 2015) - A request asking for record keeping and retention, policy guidelines and statistics pertaining to the surveillance of Muslim individuals, businesses, and organizations throughout New York City and surrounding areas is exempt from disclosure. Such a request is exempt because it reveals sources and methods that, if revealed, could create a risk to the safety to officers and their sources. Also, since the vast majority of records do not include racial, religious, or ethnic classifications and there is no set of search terms that would encompass the universe of responsive documents, the requests fail to reasonably describe records of the agency, and the terms are insufficient for the purposes of locating and identifying the documents sought. Upheld by Appellate Division. Motion for leave to appeal denied by Court of Appeals.\n\nAurelius Capital Management v. Dinallo, 22 Misc.3d 1122(A), 881 NYS2d 361(U), affirmed 70 AD3d 467, 898 NYS2d 448 (1st Dept 2010) - Aurelius requested from State Insurance Department spreadsheets submitted to the Department by MBIA, a competitor detailing nearly 3000 transactions that MBIA insures. MBIA claimed trade secret status, and Department denied request by Aurelius. Citing Encore and distinguishing Markowitz, court upheld Department denial, finding that Department was the only source of the information, that MBIA would be damaged by disclosure and that, unlike Markowitz, the likelihood of damage was not merely theoretical, but rather was real.\n\nAustin v. Purcell, 103 AD2d 827, 478 NYS2d 64 (2nd Dept 1984) - Consultants' reports, and in this instance, an opinion of outside counsel, \"treated as intra-agency material, even though prepared by an extragovernmental entity\". Current Law: §87(2)(g); see also Sea Crest\n\nBabigian v. Evans, 104 Misc.2d 140, 427 NYS2d 688, affirmed 97 AD2d 992, 469 NYS2d 834(U) (1st Dept 1983) - Court unanimously upheld lower court decision holding that the Office of Court Administration is an \"agency\" subject to the Freedom of Information Law; Supreme Court also found that Law does not require agency to tabulate statistics, but access to information in computer should not be restricted merely because it is not in printed form; agency argued unsuccessfully that disclosure of list of employees who were awarded back pay would \"impair\" collective bargaining negotiations; cited opinion of Committee. Current Law: §§86(1) and (3), 87(2)(c) and 89(3); see also Quirk\n\nBader v. Bove, 273 AD2d 466, 710 NYS2d 379 (2nd Dept 2000) – Village demonstrated that, to honor request, “the one full-time employee of the Village Clerk’s office would have to manually search through every document filed with the Village going back over 45 years”, and that, therefore, the request did not reasonably describe the records as required by §89(3). See Konigsberg.\n\nBaez v. Brown, Supreme Court, Queens County, January 2, 2013 - Documents and photographs provided must be legible and clear copies. Photographs are not required to be reprints nor are they required to be enhanced. Where the documents provided were not legible or clear they must be reprinted without expense to petitioner.\n\nBahnken v. NYC Fire Department, 794 NYS2d 312, 17 AD3d 228 (1st Dept 2005), appeal denied 6 NY3d 701, 810 NYS2d 415 (2005) - Issue involves propriety of Department’s contention that “contract provisions relating to compensation, patient billing, insurance and hospital quality assurance programs” should be withheld under FOIL’s “trade secret” exception. Lower court upheld agency’s denial, but Appellate Division reversed, stating that “any potential inquiry was not substantial enough to fall squarely within the exemption”, §87(2)(d).\n\nBarrett v. Morgenthau, 74 NY2d 907, 549 NYS2d 649 (1989) - Petitioner directed request to district attorney and was denied in a letter signed by the records access officer. Petitioner brought suit and court held that: \"Inasmuch as the district attorney failed to advise petitioner of the availability of an administrative appeal in the office (see 21 NYCRR 1401.7[b]) and failed to demonstrate in this proceeding that procedures for such an appeal had, in fact, even been established (see, Public Officers Law §87[1][b]), he cannot be heard to complain that petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies\". Court cited Committee's regulations.\n\nBaumgarten v. Koch, 97 Misc.2d 449, 411 NYS2d 487 (New York County 1979) - Records of committee designated to assist in recommending judges deniable as predecisional; necessity for confidentiality also permits denial under public interest privilege; overriding public interest confidentiality of judicial selection process. Current Law: §85 et seq.\n\nBaynes v. Fairport Central School District, (pdf) Supreme Court, Monroe County, November 1, 2006 - Union president attempted to block disclosure pursuant to FOIL following request for emails stored on school district computer relating to union activities. Court held that emails sought are clearly “records” and that union lacked standing, “has no remedy” and or basis for bringing a “preemptive proceeding to prevent disclosure.”\n\nBeechwood Restorative Care Center v. Signor, 5 NY3d 435, 808 NYS2d 568 (2005) - Applicant, a nursing home closed by the Department of Health, requested records and was largely ignored. Department disclosed hundreds of records only after lawsuit was initiated and with prodding from the court. Closing of the facility resulted in several newspaper articles, and applicant applied for award of attorney’s fees. Although Court of Appeals found that “DOH’s failure to follow FOIL’s requirements necessitated this lawsuit, a result that could have been avoided had DOH discharged it statutorily-mandated disclosure obligations in a more thorough and timely fashion”, it rejected request for attorney’s fees because the records sought were not of “clearly significant to the general public.” Although the closing of the facility might have been of significant interest to the public, the records sought, i.e., those involving employee training, job descriptions, correspondence with DOH and the like, would not be of significant interest to the general public.\n\nBellamy v. New York City Police Department, 272 AD2d 120, 708 NYS2d 5 (1st Dept 2000) - Conclusory statement that agency could not locate records without indication that person so stating was involved in the search was inadequate, as was failure on the part of agency to indicate contents of records withheld; lower court in those circumstances should have conducted in camera inspection to determine propriety of redactions. See Key, Cuadrado, Gould, Johnson v. NYCPD\n\nBello v. Department of Law, 208 AD2d 832, 617 NYS2d 856 (2nd Dept 1994) - Request involved records obtained during the course of a civil investigation. Court held that agency could not meet the burden of proving that records would if disclosed interfere with investigation, that promise of confidentiality would not serve to enable agency to withhold, but that one of the records could be withheld under §87(2)(d), a letter that \"digests the results of customer surveys.\" See also Washington Post\n\nBelth v. Insurance Department, 95 Misc.2d 18, 406 NYS2d 649 (New York County 1977) - Computer programs and mathematical models submitted to Insurance Department by insurance company held deniable on the ground that the information constitutes a trade secret. Current Law: §87(2)(d)\n\nBelth v. NYS Dept. of Insurance, 189 Misc.2d 508, 733 NYS2d 833 (New York County 2001) - Petitioner publishes a newsletter and requested names and titles of employees of life insurance companies earning above a certain level. The information is required to be filed and has been routinely disclosed since 1986. Upon learning that petitioner disclosed the information on the internet, various companies expressed opposition to disclosure. Court held that disclosure would not constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that the employees “are non governmental should not ipso facto shield their salary from public view”; Because insurance industry is “highly regulated”, those identified “do not have a greater expectation of privacy rights than would government employees. Filings since 1906 intended to “discourage political corruption and nepotism” in the insurance industry, and “balancing the public interest against non-disclosure”; held that information should continue to be disclosed. Claim that “internet dissemination can have a deleterious result” found to be “conclusory and unsupported.”\n\nBensing v. LeFevre, 133 Misc.2d 198, 506 NYS2d 822 (New York County 1986) - Attorney representing inmate sought names of inmates housed with his client in a segregated housing unit. Court held that record is available, rejecting claim that disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; similarly, the Court rejected a denial based upon the Personal Privacy Protection Law. Current Law: §87(2)(b); also, Personal Privacy Protection Law, §95(6)(c)\n\nBerger v. New York City Department of Health and Hygiene, Supreme Court, Queens County, December 2, 2013 - The Jewish Daily Newspaper sought records including the name of the Mohel who infected an infant with herpes during the Orthodox Jewish practice of Mtzizah B’Peh in 2012. The newspaper argued that the Mohel was acting in a professional capacity and therefore, disclosure could not constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Background: in September 2012, the NYC Board of Health mandated informed consent for the ritual in which a Mohel or circumciser uses his mouth to draw away blood after the surgical removal of the foreskin, to “cleanse” the circumcision. The court found that because the confidentiality provision contained within New York City Health Code §11.11(a) is not a state or federal statute, the exemption under §87(2)(a) is inapplicable. The court further found that “A person with herpes or any similar communicable disease suffers the same privacy concerns whether or not his business or personal life is concerned”, that public awareness of the potential dangers alleged to be inhered in this practice can be effectuated without compromising the name of the individual mohel who is infected, and that the identity of the mohel can be withheld as disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of his personal privacy.\n\nBernier v. Mann, 166 AD3d 798, 563 NYS2d 158 (3rd Dept 1990) - Inmate request for records regarding other inmates involved in a disturbance was denied based upon institutional safety and inmate privacy considerations. Current Law: §87(2)(f); see also Barrett\n\nBernstein v. City of New York, (pdf) Supreme Court, New York County, NYLJ, November 7, 1990 - Petitioner requested records of maintenance, inspection, repairs and complaints dealing with the FDR Drive on October 20, 1989; receipt of request was acknowledged November 1; no further response was made, and petitioner sent a second letter, receipt was acknowledged again, and second letter was treated as if it were initial request; petitioner sued, court found that failure to grant or deny access represented a constructive denial of access; although agency argued that petitioner had not exhausted administrative remedies, court found that agency failed to comply with §89(3), for acknowledgments did not include approximation of when request would be granted or denied and that agency's \"actions and/or inactions placed petitioner in a 'catch-22' position\"; Court refused to dismiss, ordered agency appeals officer to respond within 10 business days as required by §89(4)(a) of FOIL. See Robertson and Lecker\n\nBeyah v. Goord, 309 AD2d 1049, 766 NYS 2d 222 (3rd Dept 2003) -- Court rejected nearly all of the agency’s contentions. Inmate involved in an incident at correctional facility and sought records relating to the incident. Held that employee accident reports could not be withheld as unwarranted invasion of privacy, for they described the “general nature of the correction officers’ injuries...[and] do not reveal details of any existing medical condition” and, therefore, could not beconsidered part of a medical history. Employee interviews available, because agency could not establish that they would be relied upon in evaluating performance or therefore exempt from disclosure under 50-a of Civil Rights Law; similarly the records did not include confidential source or reveal “nonroutine criminal investigative techniques or procedures” deniable under §87(2)(e)(iii) or (iv). Same result regarding “reports of complaint progress, index sheets and receipt of complaint.” Although employee training records “are personnel records” subject to §50-a and are “clearly relied upon to evaluate performance”, citing Daily Gazette, held that agency failed to demonstrate “a substantial and realistic potential *** for [their] abusive use against the [correction officers]”. One agency directive found to be available, the other deniable because disclosure could endanger life or safety. Rejected request for attorney’s fees because records were not of clearly significant interest to the general public.\n\nCity School District of the City of Binghamton v. Civil Service Commission, Supreme Court, Albany County, September 15, 1976 - Insurance experience data in possession of State Civil Service Commission held to be available; Civil Service Commission was found not to regulate commercial enterprise; detriment to the public interest could not be proven. Original Law: §§85, 88(7)(b)\n\nBloomberg v. Hennessy, 99 Misc.2d 958, 417 NYS2d 593 (New York County 1979) - Accident reports of Commissioner of Transportation not exempt from disclosure under §117 of the Transportation Law, but rather accessible under §83 of the Transportation Law and the Freedom of Information Law; in camera inspection made. Current Law: §87(2)(a)\n\nBly v. City of Yonkers, (pdf) Supreme Court, Westchester County, March 17, 2009 - Involved request for records concerning 1952 murder of labor leader that \"was never solved, and the murder investigation remains open.\" Request was denied \"in its entirety\" based on section 87(2)(e)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Court emphasized an agency's responsibility to meet the burden of proof, stating that: \"While there is precedent for delaying disclosure of police reports until the completion of a pending law enforcement investigation or prosecution of criminal charges, the Court finds that under the facts and circumstances of this case, Respondents have failed to articulate sufficient reasons why the requested documents are exempt from disclosure\", citing Gould and rejecting a \"blanket\" denial of access. Respondents' \"justification of the claim to exemption consists mostly of conclusory and generalized policy concerns.\" See also Markowitz regarding burden of proof.\n\nBoard of Education of the City of New York v. Regan, 131 Misc.2d 514, 500 NYS2d 978 (Albany County 1986) - For audit purposes, State Comptroller sought to subpoena computer list of certain students who might be eligible for an aid program. Board of Education motion for modification was granted based upon confidentiality restriction imposed by federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC §1232g).\n\nBoddie v. Goord, 251 AD2d 799, 674 NYS2d 466 (3rd Dept 1998) - Portions of NYS Department of Correctional Services Employee Manual pertaining to \"the supervision and security of inmates\" could justifiably be withheld on the ground that disclosure would endanger life or safety. See also Howard v. Malone\n\nBoni v. Mills, (pdf) Supreme Court, Ulster County, February 27, 2003 - Citing school district’s memorandum, Court dismissed based on finding that petitioner “failed to allege any FOIL violation which occurred when the District decided to provide her with copies of the District Treasurer’s monthly reports in lieu of the considerably more voluminous monthly bank statements which she had sought”; district’s memorandum indicated that there was no significant difference between 295 monthly reports and 2880 pages of bank statements, that those two kinds of documents “included virtually the equivalent information”, that the Treasurer’s reports were readily available in a file drawer, but that the 72 months of bank statements would involve the assignment of an employee to make redactions.\n\nMatter of Bottom v. Fischer, 129 A.D.3d 1604, 10 N.Y.S.3d 786 (4th Dept. 2015). - Petitioner appeals the decision of the lower court granting his FOIL requests for documents but denying his request for attorney’s fees. Held that a petitioner who “substantially prevails” against a petitioner who lacked a “reasonable basis” for it is denial entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees incurred.\n\nBrightley v. Lai, 266 AD2d 131, 698 NYS2d 487 (1st Dept 1999) -- Held the Petitioner \"failed to meet his burden of establishing by admissible evidence that the documents requested had not been provided to the attorney who had represented him at his criminal trial or that they were no longer available to him.\" See Moore, Scarola, Swinton\n\nVillage of Brockport v. Calandra, 191 Misc.2d 718, 745 NYS2d 662 (2002), affirmed 305 AD2d 1030, 758 NYS2d 877 (4th Dept 2003) -- Court denied motion for declaratory judgment regarding proposed responses to “FOIL” request was denied, for it would be equivalent to advisory opinion, which could have been requested from Committee on Open Government. Motion for summary judgment by Village seeking declaration of its rights in relation to disclosure of settlement agreement was granted; disclosure of agreement with former Chief of Police could have resulted in liability under §50-a of Civil Rights Law. Settlement agreement included confidentiality clause that “directly conflicts with the public policy of FOIL.” Court cited Committee opinion 12423 and found that §50-a and provision dealing with unwarranted invasion of personal privacy were inapplicable and did not permit withholding of “financial retirement arrangement” or diminish right of access to “information regarding public expenditure.” Found that agreement “did not evaluate...performance or contemplate...continued employment, rather it specifically provided for...orderly separation from service”, and that therefore, §50-a did not apply. Village and others were “relieved of their obligation to maintain confidentiality.” Court awarded attorney’s fees to newspaper, but not to pro se litigant; Appellate Division affirmed and found that award of attorney’s fees was not abuse of discretion.\n\nBrooklyn College Alumni Association, Inc. v. Murphy, Supreme Court, Kings County, Dec. 18, 1986, affirmed 136 AD2d 973, 523 NYS2d 331 (1st Dept 1988) -- Court granted access to Brooklyn College's alumni mailing list sought by not-for-profit corporation; found that list would not be used for commercial or fund-raising purpose. Current Law: §89(2)(b)(iii)\n\nBrown v. Town of Amherst, 195 AD2d 979, 600 NYS2d 601 (4th Dept 1993) -- Police Department denied access to all records regarding murder of decedent of applicant for the records. Appellate Division found that lower court \"erred by denying summarily plaintiff's demands for records\", that not all records compiled for law enforcement purposes are necessarily exempt, and that agency failed to meet its burden of proof; remitted to Supreme Court for in camera inspection to determine rights of access.\n\nBrown v. Goord, 45 AD3d 930, 845 NYS2d 495 (3rd Dept 2007) -- Request involved records that included material that could properly be redacted. Citing several Committee opinions, Court held that petitioner had no right to inspect at no charge, and that before making records available, agency could redact and charge requisite fee for copies.\n\nBrown v. New York City Police Department, 264 AD2d 558, 694 NYS2d 385 (1st Dept 1999) - Petitioner charged with rape, sodomy and assault, but only convicted for assault. Held that records no longer exempt from disclosure “on the ground of their being the subject of an ongoing investigation or judicial proceeding”, and further that Department could not rely on §50-b of the Civil Rights Law, for charges involving sex offenses were dismissed.\n\nBrown v. Yalem, 195 AD2d 979, 600 NYS2d 601 (1993) -- Appellate Division unanimously reversed lower court decision that denied request by Administratrix of Estate for police department records regarding murder of deceased; “Not all material compiled for law enforcement purposes is exempt from disclosure”; “defendants are not entitled to a blanket exemption from disclosure absent a showing that the materials requested fall squarely within a statutory exception. Affidavits that merely parrot the statutory language of the exemption are not sufficient.”\n\nBrownstone Publishers, Inc. v. New York City Department of Buildings, 146 Misc.2d 376, 550 NYS2d 564, affirmed 166 AD2d 294, 560 NYS2d 642 (1990) -- Petitioner sought computer files maintained by agency on computer disks, asked that data be transferred to computer tapes and offered to pay actual cost and personnel time; Court found that the agency, \"apparently intending to discourage similar requests, agreed to provide the information only in hard copy, i.e., printed out on over a million sheets of paper\" at great cost in money and time to agency and petitioner; held that FOIL requires that the information be transferred onto computer tapes.\n\nBrownstone Publishers, Inc. v. New York City Department of Finance, 167 AD2d 166, 561 NYS2d 245 (1st Dept 1990) -- Petitioner sought information from real property tax returns; lower Court granted most of the request, and Appellate Division found that secrecy provision of NYC Administrative Code did not constitute a \"statute\" that exempted records from disclosure; in 1989, State Legislature enacted provision to make provisions of Administrative Code a statute for purposes of FOIL; instant case represents application to renew and reargue; Court refused to permit same due to language of enactment and final determination earlier rendered by Supreme Court.\n\nBrownstone Publishers, Inc. v. New York City Department of Finance, 150 AD2d 185, 540 NYS2d 796, appeal denied 75 NY2d 791, 552 NYS2d 92 (1990) -- Court granted access to statistical and factual records concerning transfers of real property, including condominiums and apartment numbers; held that names of buyers and sellers could be withheld.\n\nNOTE: Although court found that records could not be exempted under secrecy provision of the NYC Administrative Code, §11-2115, because a code provision does not constitute a \"statute\", Chapter 714 of the Laws of 1989 provides that §11-2115 shall be deemed a \"state statute\" for purposes of §87(2)(a) of the FOIL.\n\nBrusco v. NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal, 170 AD2d 184, 565 NYS2d 86, appeal dismissed 77 NY2d 939, 569 NYS2d 611 (1991) -- Agency directed landlord to refund overcharge to tenant and made an administrative appeal. Landlord contended that since request to agency for records was made after appeal was denied, the agency's determination should be overturned. Court held, however, that in review of rent appeal, it could not consider arguments or evidence not contained in the records. As such, failure to comply with FOIL was not relevant to rent proceeding.\n\nBuffalo Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. City of Buffalo, 126 AD2d 983, 511 NYS2d 759 (4th Dept 1987) --Court unanimously reversed Supreme Court decision and held that \"tape recordings of certain communications broadcast over police radio\" must be disclosed. Agency failed to meet the burden of showing that the records could be withheld under §87(2)(g), particularly provisions involving \"instructions to staff that affect the public\".\n\nBuffalo Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. New York State Department of Correctional Services, 155 AD2d 106, 552 NYS2d 712 (3rd Dept 1990) -- Television station sought videotapes taken at Attica in 1987 and 1988, and tapes relating to uprising at Coxsackie Correctional Facility, all of which were taken after the uprising; agency said tapes of Coxsackie were transferred to State Police; Court held that transfer of tapes did not relieve agency of responsibility under FOIL, for definition of \"record\" includes information \"produced\" by an agency; held that conclusory allegations regarding unwarranted invasions of personal privacy and interference with law enforcement investigations were insufficient, particularly since agency had not reviewed the tapes; held that inmate \"has no legitimate expectation of privacy from any and all public portrayal of his person in the facility\", and that a blanket denial on security claims under §87(2)(f) is inadequate to sustain burden of proof; ordered agency to redact portions of tape that would \"invade an inmate's expectation of privacy or create a serious safety consideration\", with a written justification to permit court to determine applicability of claimed exemptions. See Lonski, Bensing, Dobranski\n\nBuffalo Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. NYS Department of Correctional Services, 174 AD2d 212, 578 NYS2d 928 (3rd Dept 1992) -- When court previously heard case (155 AD2d 106), it rejected claim of blanket exemption following request for videotape of uprisings at correctional facilities; agency reviewed tapes and made various redactions under §87(2)(f) on ground that disclosure would endanger safety of inmates or correctional personnel; affirmed lower court's to disclose \"scenes witnessed by the general prison population\", to withhold tapes involving \"strip frisks\" based on privacy considerations, techniques for storming a cell and administration of tear gas, and portion of tape \"showing the security system switchboard\"; stressed that \"claims to the safety exemption would not prevail as to matters depicted on the tapes which would have been readily observable by the inmates, unless there was additional support for the claim 'either by a visual demonstration from the tapes or by other evidentiary facts'.\"\n\nBuffalo Broadcasting Co. Inc. v. County of Erie, 190 AD2d 1086, 593 NYS2d 706, affirmed 203 AD2d 895, 612 NYS2d 1009 (4th Dept 1994). Held that \"The fact records of the Erie County Sheriff's Department are in the temporary possession of the U.S. Attorney for presentation to a Federal Grand Jury does not warrant dismissal of this action to compel production of the records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law\", remitted to lower court to conduct in camera hearing after records returned to determine validity of claimed exemptions.\n\nBuffalo News v. Buffalo Enterprise Development Corp., 84 NY2d 488, 619 NYS2d 695 (1994) -- Issue involved status of a not-for-profit local development corporation, and Court held that the entity in question is a \"governmental entity\" that performed a governmental function for the City, that its purpose \"is undeniably governmental\" for it was created by and for the City and that it is subject to FOIL.\n\nBuffalo News v. Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority, 163 AD2d 830, 558 NYS3d 364 (4th Dept 1990) -- Newspaper sought employee payroll, attendance and disciplinary records, including employee name, job title, charges brought, disposition of charges, penalty imposed, and level of adjudication; held that records sought are available, except portions containing \"medical information or family situation which is not relevant to the work of the agency.\" See Sinicropi, Scaccia\n\nBuffalo Teachers Federation v. Buffalo Board of Education, 156 AD2d 1027, 549 NYS2d 541 (4th Dept 1990) -- Union sought to prohibit Board from providing one of its members with names, home addresses, titles and salaries of all employees; Court held that although agency is not required to disclose home addresses, \"it may, should it choose, grant access to information which is exempt from disclosure under FOIL\". See Capital Newspapers v. Burns\n\nBuilding a Better New York Committee v. NYS Commission on Government Integrity, 125 Misc.2d 829, 525 NYS2d 488 (Albany County 1988) -- Records prepared pursuant to an investigation by the State Board of Elections constituted \"public safety agency records\" for purposes of Personal Privacy Protection Law. Also, for purposes of §96(1)(k), held that compulsory legal process pertains to court ordered disclosure.\n\nBuono v. Brodsky, Supreme Court, Albany County, December 30, 2004 -- Buono as chairman of Thruway Authority et al. sought to quash subpoenas served by Brodsky, chair of an Assembly standing committee, based assertion of “‘inter-governmental office communication’ privilege as it pertains to communications between the Governor’s Office and the Canal Corporation”, a subsidiary of the Thruway Authority. Also cited “executive privilege.” Court found that assertion involved §87(2)(g) of the Freedom of Information Law and concluded that there is “no legal authority for petitioners’ proposition that Public Officers Law §87(2)(g) applies to information sought pursuant to a legislative subpoena” and that FOIL has no application. Court also discussed the “deliberative process privilege”, holding that it “is ‘deliberative’ if it is actually... related to the process by which policies are formulated”, and does not protect “a document which is merely peripheral to policy formulation.” Found that petitioners could not demonstrate that documents were either predecisional or deliberative in nature.\n\nBurke v. Yudelson, 81 Misc.2d 368 NYS2d 779, affirmed 51 AD2d 673, 378 NYS2d 165 (4th Dept 1976) -- Accessible records sought by litigant under the Freedom of Information Law remain available to litigant notwithstanding his status or interest; if documents available under Freedom of Information Law, access is not restricted solely because applicant is also a litigant. Original Law: §§85-89, §§88(1)(d), 88(7)(a)\n\nBursac v. Suozzi, 22 Misc.3d 328, 868 NYS2d 470 (Nassau County 2008) -- County Executive’s actions in publishing name, mugshot and identifying in information regarding DWI, arrest on county’s website, (“the Wall of Shame”), which results “in limitless and eternal notoriety”, despite being accessible under FOIL, represents “stigma plus” and violates due process rights. Ordered that DWI arrest record be removed from press release maintained on County’s website. NOTE: Likely wrong! Any person could acquire same records and do with them as he/she sees fit.\n\nBurtis v. New York Police Department, 240 AD2d 259, 659 NYS2d 875 (1st Dept 1997) -- Petitioner requested records of investigation of harassing phone calls to her at her house and office in the United Nations; lower court upheld denial of access, but Appellate Division unanimously modified, ordering disclosure of various investigative reports following deletion of location of telephone taps under §87(2)(e)(iv), as well as phone numbers and names of those recorded and interviews with them based on privacy concerns. Current Law: §§87(2)(b), (e)(iv).\n\nBurton v. Slade, 166 AD2d 352, 561 NYS2d 637 (1st Dept 1990) -- Agency conceded that it was abuse of discretion to deny requests without first reviewing records sought and \"stating, with particularity\", the reasons for denial; Court ordered agency to review records and disclose or deny access, with reasons for any denial. See Cornell University\n\nCanandaigua Messenger, Inc. v. Wharmby, Supreme Court, Ontario County, May 11, 2001, affirmed 292 AD2d 835, 739 NYS2d 508 (4th Dept 2002) – Issue involved status of Canandaigua Recreation Development Corporation (CRDC), a not-for-profit corporation, under FOIL and Open Meetings Law. CRDC was formed to finance and construct the “Roseland Waterpark”, and bonds were issued on behalf of City and City pledged money to finance capital improvements. All members of CRDC Board were appointed by the City, and court questioned claim that the City lacks control. City has option to purchase and will take title when bonds are paid in full. Citing Buffalo News v. Buffalo Enterprise Development Corp., court referred to “CRDC’s intimate relationship with the City and the fact that the CRDC is performing its function in place of the City necessitates a finding that it constitutes an agency...and therefore is subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Law.” Found that appeal was timely made and that failure to respond to appeal deemed a denial of the appeal, citing DeCorse and VanSteenburg (see also Floyd). See Stoll, Farms First. Appellate Division affirmed regarding substance of lower court holding, but reversed order of award of attorney’s fees. Found that lower court “abused its discretion” in awarding attorney’s fees under the Open Meetings Law. Note: Court seems to confuse attorney’s fees provisions in the FOIL and Open Meetings Law.\n\nCanty v. NYS Department of Correctional Services, 30 Misc.3d 705, 913 NYS2d 528 (Albany County 2010) -- Inmate requested accident reports pertaining to correction officers injured during riot at correctional facility. Court reviewed them in camera in accordance with 50-a of Civil Rights Law and rejected application of that statute, for records “have not been shown to have any relevancy to the respective officers’ continued employment or promotion.” Held that portions of the report in which employees described accident or injury were accessible, but that Facility Health Services Report exempt from disclosure under HIPAA, section 18 of Public Health Law, and as unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\n\nCapital Newspapers v. City of Albany, 15 NY3d 759, 906 NYS2d 808 (2010) -- Newspaper sought \"gun tags\" associated with police officers' purchase of weapons in 1990's and issue involved section 50-a of Civil Rights Law concerning police officers' personnel records. If applicable, records are confidential and exempt from FOIL. Held that \"conclusory affidavit did not establish that the documents were 'used to evaluate performance toward continued employment' as required by that statute.\" Consequently, FOIL applied. Court left open issue of 50-a applies when persons are no longer police officers. See Brockport.\n\nCapital Newspapers v. Bruno and Silver, (pdf) Supreme Court, Albany County, October 23, 2006 --Involved access to names of state legislators who sponsored “member items”, the appropriations maintained in a pool of funds totaling $170 million distributed as discretionary expenditures. Note that access to records of State Legislature is governed by §88(2), which lists categories of records deemed available to exclusion of all others. Held that disclosure did not affect or unconstitutionally impair Legislature’s ability to legislate and that names did not consist of “deliberative” information, but rather statistical or factual tabulations available under §88(2)(e). Cited Weston.\n\nCapital Newspapers v. Burns, 67 NY2d 562, 505 NYS2d 576 (1986) -- Court of Appeals held that a \"lost time report\" pertaining to a specific police officer that indicated the number of days and dates of sick leave used are available, notwithstanding claim of confidentiality made under §50-a of the Civil Rights Law and contention that disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Although §50-a requires confidentiality of certain police officers' personnel records, a review of its legislative history indicated that confidentiality was intended to be asserted only when records were sought in the context of litigation. Court stated that there must be \"a clear showing of legislative intent to establish and preserve\" a claim of confidentiality based upon a statute other than the Freedom of Information Law. Also held that burden of proof could not be met relative to an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Current Law: §§87(2)(a), (b); see also Bahlman, Gannett v. James\n\nCapital Newspapers v. Poklemba, (pdf) Supreme Court, Albany County, April 6, 1989 -- Request involved all conviction records maintained by Division of Criminal Justice Services. Although the records are available from the courts, a review of the legislative history of applicable provisions of the Executive Law resulted in conclusion that the records were exempted from disclosure by statute.\n\nCapital Newspapers Division of the Hearst Corporation v. Whalen, 69 NY2d 246, 513 NYS2d 367 (1987) -- Court of Appeals unanimously reversed decision of Appellate Division and held that \"Corning Papers\" kept or held by City of Albany are \"records\" subject to Freedom of Information Law, including those characterized as personal or which pertained to former mayor acting in a political party capacity; to enable agency to determine which documents are not \"records\" would thwart the objective of the Law. Current Law: §86(3); see also Washington Post, Westchester Rockland v. Kimball, Warder\n\nCapruso v. NYS Police, Supreme Court, New York County, NYLJ, July 7, 2001, modified 300 AD2d 27, 751 NYS2d 179 (1st Dept 2003) -- Request involved “operator’s manual for any radar speed detection devise used” and “State Police Radar and Aerial Speed Enforcement Training Manuals.” Following in camera inspection, court rejected claim that disclosure would interfere with effective law enforcement, stating that agency’s “arguments fail to establish a causal link as to how release of the information in the manufacturers’ operational manual would enable a speeding driver to avoid detection.” Reached same result regarding State Police Manuals and cited Committee opinion, “which while not binding, is nevertheless to be given deferential consideration”, citing Kwasnik. See also Fink; Appellate Division modified, dismissing proceeding against State, which is not a “body or officer”, but affirming essential holding after in camera review, finding that there is no expectation of secrecy regarding documents that are “freely traded in public commerce.”\n\nCarnevale v. City of Albany, Supreme Court, Albany County, November 17, 2008, affirmed 68 AD3d 1290, 891 NYS2d 495 (3rd Dept 2009) -- Petitioners' son was fatally injured after being hit by vehicle involved in a police chase, and they requested records gathered by the City during and after the incident. Held that proceeding was timely commenced, for agency failed to inform petitioners of their right to appeal an initial denial of access. Because agency assured petitioners that it \"was working to provide a further response and informing them that more documents may become available once the law enforcement investigation was concluded\", petitioners \"reasonably concluded that respondent's earlier letters did not constitute final and binding determinations of their FOIL request.\" That being so, \"the statute of limitations did not begin to run when those letters were sent.\" Court emphasized agency's obligation to meet the burden of proof and held that \"Conclusory statements are insufficient to deny access, as are categorical assertions that all law enforcement investigations will be harmed if witnesses' names are available through a FOIL request in this situation.\" No proof that release of witnesses names or addresses would endanger their lives or safety or constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Also held, however, that police officers' statements could be used to evaluate their performance and were exempt from disclosure under section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law. Found that lower court did not abuse discretion denying application for counsel fees.\n\nCarter v. County of Erie, 255 AD2d 984, 680 NYS2d 768 (4th Dept 1968) -- One several issues involved finding that records pertaining to an incident in County medical center or disciplinary action taken against nurse were not exempt from disclosure under Education Law, §6527(3), for that exemption “pertains only to medical review functions.” Also held that those records are “discoverable in certain circumstances”, citing §96(1)(k) of the Personal Privacy Protection Law; Note: PPPL applies only to state agencies and would have no application to a county facility.\n\nCastle House Development, Inc. v. City of New York Police Department, 24 Misc.3d 1222, 897 NYS2d 668 (New York County 2009) -- Lengthy decision involving a variety of excuses for nondisclosure offered by the NY Police Department. Petitioner’s employee was involved in an accident and brought a civil action against owner of construction site. Request made for copy of investigative reports and photos relating to the incident. Even though “there was no continuing law enforcement proceeding extant”, the Department denied request and appeal on the ground that disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement purposes would interfere with law enforcement investigation or judicial proceeding. Petitioner brought Article 78 proceeding, also claiming that disclosure could deprive a person of a fair trial. Court wondered in print why the Department “took it upon itself to get involved in the civil action and take on the mantel of guardian of other parties’ interest.” Later in the proceeding, Department for the first time claimed that records were sealed pursuant to §160.50 of the CPL. Court was clearly upset with that new allegation, found that the records were indeed sealed and ordered Department to indicate when it knew of sealing order in consideration of the expenditure of time and money by petitioner, as well as a hearing concerning petitioner’s motion involving sanctions and/or the award of costs. Also distinguished and rejected Department’s contentions based on Hawkins, Pittari and Farbman.\n\nCAT ASI v. NYS Insurance Dept., 195 Misc.2d 456, 760 NYS2d 284 (New York County 2002) --Petitioner failed to gain award following submission of proposal in RFP process and requested winning proposal, all attachments and “bid evaluation and tabulation materials.” Agency failed to respond to request or appeal in timely manner but contended in verified answer that records could be withheld under §87(2)(c) and (g). Court rejected petitioner’s argument that agency’s failure to claim exemptions due to its failure to respond should result in full disclosure, citing Floyd. However, also held that petitioner exhausted administrative remedies and that “once a contract is conditionally awarded to a bidder, the terms of the successful bidder’s response to the Request for Proposal could not longer be competitively sensitive’” and rejected grounds for denial. See Cross Sound Ferry, Contracting Plumbers\n\nCatskill Alliance Heritage Alliance, Inc. v. Office of the Governor, (pdf) Supreme Court, Albany County, March 5, 2010 -- Records sought involved three agencies, the Office of the Governor, Office of the Attorney General, and Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). AG withheld 25 documents, and after in camera review, court agreed that they were properly withheld under section 87(2)(g) as intra-agency materials; documents withheld by Governor on basis of 87(2)(d) addressed the price of and terms for acquiring certain parcels of land. Court ordered release, for agency offered no explanation as to how disclosure would cause substantial injury to competitive position of any entity and also found that none involved a competitive process. DEC withheld 2,000 documents. Court found claims of attorney work product and attorney-client privilege unjustified, and that CPLR section 4547 concerning records of settlement negotiations did not apply to request under FOIL (see Waterford; no basis for claim under 87(2)(c); also failed to justify assertion of 87(2)(g) and held that \"in those instances where an intra-agency exemption is asserted but the document was circulated outside the 'agency' realm, the claim of exemption is rejected.\" Many records disclosed because no exemption claimed. Despite these outcomes, court found that \"award of counsel fees is not justified.\" Catskill Heritage, September 13, 2010 attached.\n\nCatskill Heritage Alliance, Inc. v. Office of the Governor, Supreme Court, Albany County, September 13, 2010 – FOIL “does not contemplate necessary release of any record for which an agency has failed to explain the reasons for denying access”; the Legislature chose to motivate compliance by exposing an agency to the risk of an assessment of attorney’s fees and other litigation costs.\n\nCentury House Historical Society v. State of New York Public Service Commission, 237 AD2d 844, 655 NYS2d 182 (3rd Dept 1997) -- Unanimously found that “when an interagency or intra agency document, or a portion thereof, is expressly relied upon as a basis for a final determination, the relevant portion of each report becomes subject to disclosure under §87(2)(g)(iii).\n\nCharles v. Abrams, 199 AD2d 652, 604 NYS2d 1013 (3rd Dept 1994) -- Claim of attorney-client privilege by Attorney General was rejected regarding documents concerning policy applicable to litigation in general, rather than any particular lawsuit.\n\nChatham Towers, Inc. v. New York City of Management and Budget, 25 Misc.3d 1243, 901 NYS2d 905 (New York County 2009) -- Request involved \"any and all documents and other records prepared in connection with, concerning, or otherwise related to the planned Joint Operations Center at 109 Park Row...\" Held that agency's \"bare refusal to provide the documents, based merely on conclusory formulaic reiteration of the statutory language, is insufficient...\" In initial denials and appeals, the reasons were not given \"in sufficient fashion to allow the petitioners to know, in at least a general fashion, what each document represented.\" Held that \"We know that e-mails are involved, and 'documents', but, what types of documents, to whom they were sent, and why, or any other type of description, has not been expressed. See also West Harlem.\n\nChebere v. Johnson, 3 AD3d 365, 770 NYS2d 357 (1st Dept 2004) -- Reversed lower court’s denial of request, which involved prosecutor’s interview notes containing witness’s statements made prior to giving testimony during trial. Held that agency failed to show how disclosure would “additionally endanger the witness, whose identity was known at all times by petitioner”, and remanded for in camera inspection and determination as to propriety of denial.\n\nChittenden v. Novack, (pdf) Supreme Court, Westchester County, NYLJ, July 12, 2001 – Several holdings. Initial denial by records access officer failed to inform petitioner of right to appeal, and petitioner initiated proceeding. Notwithstanding failure to do so and holding in Barrett, court dismissed due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies since evidence indicated that petitioner made other appeals and was aware of identity of appeals officer. Even if no dismissal, held that response denying request was proper. First, while statistical records involving attendance of public employees (i.e., time sheets) are available, citing Capital Newspapers v. Burns, ”medical reason” for absence, “medical condition and/or treatment for disabilities” would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if disclosed, citing Committee opinion. Second, citing Committee opinion, records access officer is not required to answer questions or respond to interrogatories. Third, there is no obligation to create or disclose records that do not exist. And fourth, tape recording of conversation could not be withheld as unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, but due to its contents, could properly be withheld as intra-agency material.\n\nChurch of Scientology v. State, 61 AD2d 942, 403 NYS2d 224 (1st Dept 1978), affirmed 46 NY2d 906, 414 NYS2d 900 (1979) -- Where investigation resulted in no further action and there was no intent to commence further action, records held to be available; files concerning complaints accessible except to the extent that names of parties making complaints could be withheld based on privacy provisions, also, agency cannot merely assert grounds for denial, but rather must prove that a ground for denial is appropriately cited based on effects of disclosure. Current Law: §§87(2), 89(4)\n\nCitizens for Alternatives to Animal Labs v. Bd. Of Trustees, 92NY2d 357, 680 NYS2d 205 (1998) –SUNY contended that records kept pursuant to federal law were outside scope of FOIL; court unanimously disagreed, stating that SUNY is an agency and that purpose for which records are produced, function to which they relate, or limitation based on \"federal purpose\" for their custody are irrelevant; distinguished holding under the Open Meetings Law in which it was held that entity created to comply with federal law was not a \"public body\" subject to that statute (see ASPCA v. Board of Trustees of SUNY); see Capital Newspapers v. Whalen, Encore, Russo.\n\nCoalition of Landlords, Homeowners and Merchants v. County of Suffolk, (pdf) Supreme Court, Suffolk County, February 14, 2005 -- Issue involved “the capacity to retrieve the information sought by petitioner from the Suffolk County Clerk’s Office and the Suffolk county RPTSA without the necessity of creating a new record.” Hearing was held and credible testimony established that agency would be involved in creating a record. “According to the uncontroverted proof”, the record sought “would require approximately 171 days (or 34 weeks) worth or technical ‘man hours’”, and that “the issue is not simply one of merely redacting confidential with keystroke or two...nor is the issue one of merely ‘changing technology’...The evidence is clear that the agencies in question would be required to create a record at considerable expense to the tax payers.”\n\nColeman v. New York City Police Department, 723 NYS2d 494, 282 AD2d 390 (1st Dept 2001) – Petitioner requested records in February, 1998, and receipt of request was soon acknowledged, indicating that records sought, including ballistics reports, were “at least partially disclosable”, and that determination “would probably take 120 days.” Response made on September 14 with disclosure of certain records, but no mention of ballistics tests. Petitioner initiated Article 78 on September 22, before he knew of September 14 response, based on a claim of “complete noncompliance with the FOIL request.” Department moved to dismiss as moot or, alternatively, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Lower court granted motion, but Appellate Division reversed, stating that request should have been remanded regarding request for ballistics reports. “Given the incomplete, belated response to the FOIL request, which neither turned over nor explained the failure to turn over the ballistics reports, the petition cannot be view as moot.” Also held that failure to appeal did not merit dismissal, for petitioner “waited months longer than the outside time frame set by respondent’s agent.” See Newton Collier County Publishing Company v. Office of the District Attorney of the County of New York, (pdf) Supreme Court, New York County, October 5, 2000 -- Request involved records made available to defense counsel in discovery in cases pending under indictments arising out of an investigation. Committee opinion advised that initial denial did not contain sufficient articulation of justification to overcome presumption of access. Although it was found that courts should defer to Committee opinions, facts upon which opinion was based changed and altered issues. Court held that \"the specificity required of an agency to justify non-disclosure will be less when it involves the application of §87(2)(e)(i) to a pending case or investigation.\" Note that agency did not inform applicant that records included \"several truckloads\" of materials or that some of the materials were made available to some defendants but not others. Nevertheless, court found that due to volume of request and supervision that would be needed to allow public to view the records, disclosure would interfere with investigations or judicial proceedings \"by straining resources and threatening the integrity of this evidence.\" See also Gould; Legal Aid Society v. NYPD.\n\nCollins v. New York City, Supreme Court, New York County, January 7, 2013 - A reviewing court can consider grounds for denial of disclosure not previously raised. No basis in law or evidence to support agency’s argument that disclosure would interfere with judicial proceedings involving defendants other than petitioner.\n\nCollins v. NYS Division of Parole, 251 AD2d 738, 674 NYS2d 145 (3rd Dept 1998), appeal denied 92 NY2d 811, 680 NYS2d 457 (1998) - Held that individual's parole records could be withheld pursuant to rules based on statute. Held that: \"While not specifically establishing a FOIL exemption, Executive Law [section] 259-k provides a clear legislative intent to establish and maintain the confidentiality of parole records...To that end, Parole Board has promulgated rules prohibiting the release of the information sought...Given that Executive Law [section] 259-k directs that parole case record information be confidential, we conclude that the information and documents...are not subject to disclosure...\"\n\nNOTE: decision appears to conflict with Morris and Zuckerman\n\nCommunity Board 7 of Borough of Manhattan v. Schaeffer, 150 Misc.2d 770, 570 NYS2d 769, affirmed, 183 AD2d 422, 585 NYS2d 1010 (1st Dept), reversed on other grounds 84 NY2d 148, 615 NYS2d 644 (1994) - Draft of restrictive declaration being negotiated between NYC Planning Department and Trump Organization was denied under §§87(2)(c) and (g). Court reject both arguments, stating that §87(2)(c) is irrelevant because \"there is no bidding process involved where an edge could be unfairly given to one company\" and \"since the Trump organization is the only party involved in these negotiations, there is no inequality of knowledge between the parties.\" Section 87(2)(g) found to be inapplicable because communications were between city agency and private firm outside of government; Court of Appeals reversed without commenting on previous decisions interpreting FOIL, but rather regarding authority of Community Board to bring an Article 78 proceeding; held that it did not.\n\nCOMPS, Inc. v. Town of Huntington, 269 AD2d 446, 703 NYS2d 225, (2000), appeal denied 95 NY2d 758, 713 NYS2d 522 (2000) - Request involved inventory for parcels referenced on Town's assessment roll. Even though Real Property Tax Law, § 500, specifies that inventory records must be disclosed, court held that denial of access was proper, for the data would be used for commercial purposes and therefore may be withheld under §89(2)(b)(iii). Note: decision seems to ignore §89(6) of the FOIL, which states that if records are available under a different law, they remain available notwithstanding FOIL. See Siegel, Fenchel & Peddy\n\nConnolly v. New York Guard, 175 AD2d 372, 572 NYS2d 443 (3rd Dept 1991) - Petitioner sought mobilization plans and documents prepared for annual training exercise. After in camera review, court held that portions of the records would if disclosed \"present the possibility of endangering the safety of the members of the Guard or others.\" Current Law: §87(2)(f)\n\nContracting Plumbers Cooperative Restoration Corp. v. Ameruso, 105 Misc.2d 951, 430 NYS2d 196 (New York County 1980) - Unsuccessful bidder granted access to successful bid proposal, records reflective of basis for determination to accept successful bid proposal, as well as agency's findings, reports and memoranda; agency could not sustain burden of proof; successful bidder must have expectation that bid proposal will be open to public; application by successful bidder to intervene was denied. Current Law: §87(2)(c)\n\nMatter of Cook v. Nassau County Police Dept., 110 A.D.3d 718 (2nd Dept. 2013) October 2, 2013 - Petitioner wanted unredacted documents of an internal affairs investigation of an officer but was denied under §50-a. Held that when access to an officer’s personnel records is sought, nondisclosure is limited to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent potential use of information in litigation to “degrade, embarrass, harass or impeach the integrity of the officer.”\n\nCorbin v. Ward, 160 AD2d 596, 554 NYS2d 240 (1st Dept), appeal denied 76 NY2d 706, 560 NYS2d 988, reargument denied 76 NY2d 983, 56 NYS2d 770 (1990) - Court held that proceeding was time barred, for request involved challenge to a second denial of access on same grounds as first denial, without any apparent change in circumstances. Petitioner could not support his speculative contention that not all documents concerning incident had been disclosed.\n\nCornell University v. City of New York Police Department, 153 AD2d 515 appeal denied, 544 NYS2d 356, 75 NY2d 707, 554 NYS2d 476 (1990) - Records sought involved investigation into sexual assault upon a student by a security guard employed by Cornell in conjunction with civil lawsuit to be brought against Cornell. Security Guard had pleaded guilty to criminal charge. Supreme Court held that the records were available, except information regarding the complainant, witnesses and a description of the acts committed. Appellate Division modified holding that agency failed to meet its burden of proof, that witnesses were not promised confidentiality, and that details concerning acts perpetrated against victim could not constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See also, Hawkins\n\nCorwin Solomon & Tanenbaum v. NYS Division of Lottery, 239 AD2d 763, 657 NYS2d 803 (3rd Dept 1997) - Lottery withheld press release identifying winners of prizes over $500,000 as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; court disagreed and ordered disclosure due to previous release of information and Lottery’s own regulations; also found that intended use of the records was irrelevant, citing Committee’s opinion; see also Empire Realty.\n\nCouncil of Regulated Adult Liquor Licenses v. New York City Police Department, 300 AD2d 17, 751 NYS2d 438 (1st Dept 2002) - Court found that disclosure would not frustrate law enforcement activities and that §87(2)(e)(i) and (iii) would not apply to documents containing “primarily statistical information concerning the law enforcement history of certain nightclubs....over a period of a few months.” Information was nearly two years old and required to be disclosed; however, “to the extent that the documents refer to prospective police activity, those references should be redacted.” Applicants reasonably described the records, for they used terms “nearly identical” to those used by agency in labeling documents. Citing Floyd, held that administrative remedies were exhausted when agency failed to determine appeal within ten business days.\n\nIn re Crawford v. The New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Supreme Court, New York County, March 20, 2014. - Petitioners asserted that low-income minority neighborhoods have either limited or no access to Internet, unlike high-income neighborhoods that receive high-speed Internet speeds. To support these assertions, petitioners requested information on conduits owned and operated by Empire City Subway, a subsidiary of Verizon, and contracts between New York City and Empire City Subway. The requests were denied by the respondent citing Public Officers Law §§ 87(2)(f) and 87(2)(i), contending that disclosure could endanger life or safety and that it would jeopardize the agency’s ability to guarantee the security of information technology assets. The maps requested had information that would jeopardize the safety of information technology. Held that if information requested need not be disclosed due to safety concerns, the agency is required to conduct a diligent search to locate other responsive documents that contain non-sensitive and non-exempt general information.\n\nCross-Sound Ferry v. Department of Transportation, 219 AD2d 346, 634 NYS2d 575 (3rd Dept 1995) - Initial request involved records relating to background of RFP; second request involved proposals received in response to RFP. No response was given to the first, and the second was denied on the ground that disclosure would impair present or imminent contract awards. After Article 78 proceeding commenced, agency disclosed several records regarding first request, and agency moved to dismiss due to mootness; before decision on the motion, agency made conditional award and disclosed portions of winning proposal, and petitioner withdrew request as it related to unsuccessful proposal. Court held that matter of original request was moot, ordered disclosure regarding second request, held that agency acted arbitrarily on both requests and awarded attorneys' fees. Appellate Division rejected claim under §87(2)(c), stating that once the contract was awarded, the RFP response \"could no longer be competitively sensitive\"; agency also raised \"trade secret\" exception for first time, and court rejected it, stating that it could have been raised earlier and that there was no support for its contention. Upheld award of attorneys' fees relative to initial request, but reversed award regarding second, stating that agency's position was \"substantially justified even though it was not correct.\"\n\nCrown v. Danby Fire District, Supreme Court, Tompkins County, March 18, 2011 - Former employee filed FOIL for training records, yet refused to pay copying fees and requested to utilize own copier. Since employee was fired for document tampering allegations, court denied request for private copier and ordered disclosure of records upon receipt of payment.\n\nD., Rowland v. Scully, 152 AD2d 570, 543 NYS2d 497 (2nd Dept 1989) - Inmate sought forms containing information designed to assist officials in determining placement of inmate in appropriate facility. Following in camera review, court held they \"are exempted as intra-agency material, inasmuch as they contain predecisional evaluations, recommendations and conclusions concerning the petitioner's conduct in prison.\" See also DiRose (2).\n\nDaily Gazette Company v. City of Schenectady, 93 NY2d 145, 688 NYS2d 472 (1999) - Court of Appeals reversed Appellate Division and held that names of police officers reprimanded in “egg throwing incident” are exempt from disclosure under §50-a of the Civil Rights Law. Found that status and purpose of person seeking records is not determinative of whether FOIL or §50-a applies, for the latter “unambiguously defines the records that are immune from indiscriminate disclosure.” Section 50-a “was designed to prevent abusive exploitation of personally damaging information contained in officers’ personnel records—perhaps most often in connection with a criminal defense attorney’s FOIL application for purposes of general cross-examination of a police witness in a criminal prosecution. Undeniably from the legislative record, however, the legislative objective went beyond precluding disclosure on behalf of defendants in pending criminal cases….The legislative purpose was to prevent disclosure of officers’ personnel records except when a legitimate need for them has been demonstrated sufficiently to obtain a court order, generally upon a showing that they are actually relevant to an issue in a pending proceeding.” Found that “the decisive factor in determining whether an officer’s personnel record was exempted from FOIL disclosure under Civil Rights Law §50-a was the potential use of the information contained therein, not the specific purpose of the particular individual requesting access, nor whether the request was actually made in contemplation of litigation.” Records having remote or no such potential use fall outside the scope of §50-a, as in Capital Newspapers v. Burns; to rely on that statute, “the agency must demonstrate a substantial and realistic potential of the requested material for the abusive use against the officer or firefighter.”\n\nDaily Gazette Company v Schenectady City School District, Supreme Court, Schenectady County, January 29, 2010 – Petitioner’s appeal for access to factual information from investigator’s report and intra-agency emails denied. Court held that report redacted in accordance with advice from COOG. Court held summaries of interviews with witnesses consisted of consultant’s recollection of interviews, not factual information. Disclosure of names of witnesses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy due to extraordinary nature of allegations, that information was not relevant to the agency, and witnesses had expectation of confidentiality. Court affirmed District’s refusal to disclose intra-agency emails “compiled” by a private company pursuant to a subpoena, the disclosure of which would have interfered with the investigation and will now interfere with future judicial proceedings.\n\nDaily News, L.P. v. New York City Office of Payroll Administration, 9 AD3d 308, 781 NYS2d 3 (1st Dept 2003), appeal denied 3 NY3d 609, 786 NYS2d 812 (2004) – Newspaper requested first and last names, titles or positions, annual pay or hourly rates of pay and current ages and zip codes of residence relating to employees of an agency. Court ordered disclosure, stating that agency did not meet burden of proving that disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that “attorney’s affirmation is insufficient to establish that the employees provided their ages or zip codes in confidence.” Agency reliance on Committee advisory opinions suggesting that ages could be withheld was insufficient to sustain its burden of proof; ages and zip codes are not matters of “clearly significant interest to the general public”, and request for attorney’s fees was rejected. Appellate Division briefly affirmed, stating that: “Respondent’s answer, simply parroting Public Officers Law §89(2)(b)(v), claims exemption from disclosure because ‘[t]he ages and zip codes of BOE employees is information that is personal in nature, reported in confidence to the BOE, and is not relevant to the work of the BOE,’ but is utterly devoid any factual basis for these conclusions.”\n\nDaily News Publishing Co. of Memphis, Tennessee v. Office of Court Administration, 186 Misc.2d 424, 718 NYS2d 800 (New York County 2000) –Petitioner sought OCA database that stores data extracted from court records. Court referred to Babigian and Quirk, acknowledging that OCA is an “agency”, not a court, and distinguished between records maintained by OCA as an agency carrying out administrative functions and records “provided by those persons performing adjudicatory functions”, the latter of which are court records not subject to FOIL. In footnote, court referred to Committee opinion that reached same conclusion and stated that “[w]hile not controlling, formal opinions of the Committee on Open Government are viewed as authoritative in interpreting FOIL”, citing Kwasnik.\n\nDaily Racing Form, Inc. v. State of New York Racing and Wagering Board, (pdf) Supreme Court, New York County, November 20, 2003 - Agency took four months to determine to grant access of portions of the request and denying others. Held that “Racing Board’s practice of notifying every entity it supervises of a FOIL request for records and arranging a prior review and screening of the Board’s response, is in direct conflict with the Public Officers Law and so delays production of records that it vitiates the public access right it is intended to implement.” Appeal process also found to conflict with FOIL, for “Rather than releasing the requested records to petitioner as the law provides, [the agency] referred the issue back to the records access officer for reconsideration...” Found that contracts and financial statements of Catskill OTB accessible; other documentation available as objective, “factual” information.\n\nD'Alessandro v. Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, 56 AD2d 762, 392 NYS2d 433 (1st Dept 1977) - Compilation of subject matter list does not require that opinions of an agency be indexed; final orders issued by agencies need not be indexed into topics or components; a list identifying only broad variety of records maintained must be created. Original Law: §88(4)\n\nData Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 NY3d 454, 849 NYS2d 489 (2007) - Primary significance of decision is that it laid the groundwork for amendments to FOIL enacted in 2008 (see Ch. 223, Laws of 2008). Key points include reversal of Appellate Division holding that petitioner had to prove that agency acted unreasonably and Court of Appeals confirmation that burden of defending secrecy rests on agency. Confirmed that FOIL does not require person seeking records \"to show any particular need or purpose\", citing Farbman, and that Data Tree's commercial motive is irrelevant and constituted improper purpose for denial of access. Only instance in which purpose is relevant involves §89(2)(b)(iii) concerning sale or release of list of names and addresses for commercial or fund-raising purposes constituting an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Found, however, that Data Tree sought \"public land records for commercial reproduction online\", not to \"solicit any business.\" Note: provision as amended pertains to lists...used for \"solicitation\" or fund-raising. Also confirmed that FOIL deals with records maintained electronically and that \"A simple manipulation of the computer necessary to transfer existing records should not, if it does not involve significant time or expense, be treated as creation of a new document\". That holding is also reflected in Ch. 223.\n\nDavid v. Lewisohn, 142 AD2d 305, 535 NYS2d 793 (3rd Dept 1988), appeal denied 74 NY2d 610, 546 NYS2d 554 (1989) -- Notations contained in real property transfer data provided by New York City to the State Board of Equalization and Assessment indicated whether particular transfers were considered \"significant\" or \"insignificant\" (\"S\" or \"I\" notations). Court held that the notations do not denote facts, but rather were \"nonfinal recommendations\" and opinions and upheld denial of the notations.\n\nMatter of Davids v. King, Supreme Court, Albany County, February 5, 2014. - Parents of children attending New York City schools challenged the sharing of student’s personal information with outside contractors for the purpose of creating the mandated student portal. Held that personal information can be disclosed in the exercise of discretion of the agency if it is necessary to the performance of the duties and purpose of the agency. However, a reasonable basis must be shown for entering into the agreement and that the disclosure and transfer of data is for a legitimate purpose.\n\nDavis v. Scott, (pdf) Supreme Court, New York County, NYLJ, November 23, 1999 - In earlier proceeding, court found that no diligent search for records was made, ordered such a search. After \"inordinate and unacceptable delay\", witness testified that she does not maintain the records and that they are kept at a different agency facility. She later phoned the facility, which located the records \"within minutes.\" Court held that agency acted in \"bad faith\", that its affirmation constituted \"frivolous and misleading conduct”; also stated that Assistant Corporation Counsel, who assured that he would be personally responsible for compliance, failed to return calls to judge. NYC Departments of Correction and Law both fined $5000; contempt hearing held to determine whether additional sanctions should be imposed. See Key; C.B. Smith\n\nDawkins v. David, (pdf) Supreme Court, New York County, 2009 Slip Op 30609 - NYPD denied request initially, and following appeal, added three more. Request related to incident concluding in conviction that was appealed, and Department cited 87(2)(e) as basis for claim that disclosure would interfere with judicial proceeding. Court found that contention unacceptable, citing Legal Aid and Pittari, both of which involved requests made prior to termination of trial. Here, \"discovery has been completed, and the trial concluded well over a year ago.\" Also, none of the requested documents were presented at trial.\n\nDay v. Town Board of Town of Milton, (pdf) Supreme Court, Saratoga County, April 27, 1992 - Held that public employees' W-2 forms are available after deleting personal information, i.e., social security numbers; court cited and relied upon Committee advisory opinion.\n\nDealy-Doe-Eyes Maddux v. New York State Police, 103 AD3d 1056, 959 NYS2d 772 (3rd Dept. 2013) – An appeals court can only overturn an award of attorney’s fees if there is a clear abuse of that discretion.\n\nDeCorse v. City of Buffalo, 239 AD2d 949, 659 NYS2d 604 (4th Dept 1997) - Short decision with many principles. Victim of assault requested records of complaints of criminal conduct at her apartment building during preceding two years, copies of some “60 incident, investigation and follow-up reports.” City redacted personal information with no reason; on appeal, City said names and addresses would be used for commercial purpose, i.e., to sue owner of building. Court held that City failed to respond to initial request within five business days and “that failure deemed a denial”; that petitioner was not obliged to serve subpoena pursuant to CPLR §2307, for “the provisions of the CPLR relating to discovery in civil actions do not apply to FOIL requests”; that use of information in a civil action is not a commercial purpose; and that city did not meet burden of proof that disclosure could result in unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\n\nDe Oliveira v. Wagner, 274 AD2d 904, 711 NYS2d 592 (3rd Dept 2000) - Some aspects of records were deleted from records, and court upheld denial of access, stating that portions of records could be withheld, despite petitioner's claim that he knew the identities of those interviewed during criminal investigation; also held that records of communications with victims relatives and others could be withheld as unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that disclosure of some aspects of the records could \"reveal nonroutine procedures utilized by law enforcement personnel in conducting investigations and gathering information.” See Johnson v. NYPD, Mulhall, Spencer\n\nMatter of Delvecchio Family v. City of Cortland – Supreme Court, Chenango County, July 20, 2012 - Petitioner sought access to a file regarding property at a certain address and attorney fees after access was wrongly denied. After a denial of access to the records, respondent appealed but was constructively denied access after not receiving a determination. Held that failure to respond in writing within ten business days to a written appeal constitutes a denial which may be reviewed in an Article 78 proceeding. Held that a court may assess attorney’s fees when a petitioner substantially prevails and an agency had no reasonable basis for denying access or the agency failed to respond within the statutory time period. Held that both conditions were present and attorney fees were awarded.\n\nDeZimm v. Connelie, 64 NY2d 860, 487 NYS2d 320 (1985) - Denial of request for all State Police regulations concerning an officer's duty to record conversations while wearing a monitoring device upheld. Some procedures contained in the Manual were not \"routine\" and could \"allow miscreants to tailor their activities to evade detection.\"\n\nDillon v. Cahn, 79 Misc.2d 300, 359 NYS2d 981 (Nassau County 1974) - Checks and account records relative to travel and other reimbursable expenses of District Attorney's office are available; a mere assertion that records are \"confidential\" is insufficient. Original Law: §86 et seq., §88(1), (7), (8)\n\nDJL Restaurant Corp. v. Department of Buildings, 273 AD2d 167, 710 NYS2d 564 (1st Dept 2000) - Petitioner sought \"a particularized justification for denying the requests, issued on a document by document basis, including a reasonable identification of the person who prepared the document, the addressee and each actual recipient thereof, and the title and a general summary of the contents of each document.” Lower court held that \"a document-by-document explanation for denial was unnecessary\", but Appellate Division found that \"Affidavits merely repeating the statutory phrasing of an exemption are insufficient to establish the requirement of particularity\", citing Gould and Brown v. Town of Amherst, and that when an agency claim of an exception cannot be evaluated on the basis of the documentation submitted, an in camera inspection is \"likely necessary.\"\n\nDobranski v. Houper, 154 AD2d 736, 546 NYS2d 180 (3rd Dept 1989) –Inmate sought all documents in a file compiled during an investigation leading to his conviction. Records were disclosed, with the exception of identikit papers, personal reference cards regarding other inmates who were in a lineup with him, handwritten notations identifying inmates in his cellblock and a criminal complaint filed against him that was not pursued. Court held that disclosure of the identikit papers \"might alert prospective criminals to characteristics important and thus encourage them to tailor their appearance to evade detection\", found that the materials are \"not routine\" and upheld denial under §87(2)(iv); reference cards were found to contain information publicly available via arrest and conviction records and were found to be available for there would have been no invasion of privacy, except those portions not typically disclosed in arrest and conviction records, i.e., names of next of kin, dietary requirements, etc.; notes identifying other inmates found to be available; name and address of complainant held to be exempt due to possibility of endangerment; inventory list of evidence used against him made available. See Buffalo Broadcasting v. Department of Correctional Services\n\nDoe v. City of Schenectady, 84 AD3d 1455, 923 NYS2d 241 (3d Dept. 2011) - Civil Rights Law § 50-a neither speaks of, nor was intended to prohibit public police disciplinary hearings. Whether these hearings should be conducted in public or private is a policy decision for the Legislature, not the courts, to make. FOIL §§ 89(2) and 96 do not operate to close publically held police disciplinary hearings.\n\nDoolan v. BOCES, 48 NY2d 341, 422 NYS2d 927 (1979) - Court of Appeals held that salary and fringe benefit data compiled by one agency for the use and information of another are available; disclosure would not impair collective bargaining negotiations; factual compilation available. Current Law: §§87(2)(c), 87(2)(g)\n\nNOTE: Court of Appeals appears to have abolished the \"governmental privilege\" [see Cirale v. 80 Pine St. Corp., 35 NY2d 113 (1974)], stating that \"[T]he public policy concerning governmental disclosure is fixed by the Freedom of Information Law; the common-law interest privilege cannot protect from disclosure materials which that law requires to be disclosed...Meeting the public's legitimate rights of access to information concerning government is fulfillment of a governmental obligation, not the gift of, or waste of, public funds.\"\n\nDuncan, Matter of, (Bradford Central School District), 90 Misc.2d 282, 394 NYS2d 362 (Steuben County 1977) - Rights of access to school district records not limited to qualified voters of a school district; regulations of school district must comply with those promulgated by Committee on Public Access to Records. Original Law: §§85 et seq., 88\n\nDunlea v. Goldmark, 85 Misc.2d 198, 380 NYS2d 496 affirmed 54 AD2d 446, 389 NYS2d 423 (3rd Dept), affirmed 43 NY2d 754, 401 NYS2d 1010 (1977) - Budget examiners work sheets are accessible and the use of the word \"statistical\" or \"factual\" data does not exclude such information merely because an opinion is based thereon; a request need not identify information sought down to the last detail. Original Law: §§85 et seq., 88, 88(1)(b), (d)\n\nDwyer, Matter of, (Fire Department, City of New York), 85 Misc.2d 104, 378 NYS2d 894 (New York County 1975) - Fire chief's report is accessible on the ground that it constitutes a final opinion of the agency. Original Law; §§85 et seq., 88(1)(a)\n\nEhrich v. New Roots Charter School, Supreme Court, Madison County, January 11, 2011 - Charter School failed to respond to requests and appeals. Court awarded attorney’s fees to applicant despite agency providing records before appearing in court\n\nEisenberg v. Goldstein, (pdf) Supreme Court, Kings County, February 26, 1988 - Court held that Kingsborough Community College Foundation Inc., a not-for-profit corporation formed to promote the interests of the College, is an \"agency\" subject to the Freedom of Information Law, citing Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, held that \"the Foundation would not exist but for its relationship with the College\"; held further that the documents sought were maintained by the college and constituted \"records\" subject to the Freedom of Information Law.\n\nElentuck v. Green, 202 AD2d 425, 608 NYS2d 701 (2nd Dept) appeal denied 84 NY2d 809, 621 NYS2d 519 (1994), reargument denied 85 NY2d 858, 624 NYS2d 326 (1995) - Intra-agency reports and \"unsatisfactory lesson observation reports\" found to be deniable under §87(2)(g) as predecisional, advisory, evaluative.\n\nEmpire Center for Public Policy, Inc. v. NYC Office of Payroll Administration , 158 A.D.3d 529, 68 N.Y.S.3d 716, Appellate Division, First Department (February 15, 2018) - Petitioner’s request for payroll information regarding all NYC employees was granted in part, but the agency denied access to records reflecting undercover officers’ salaries, contending that disclosure would pose a security threat to those officers. A January 17, 2017 Supreme Court decision held that agency failed to demonstrate how the disclosure of the payroll information, without any accompanying identifying information, would pose a security threat to the officers. Supreme Court ordered disclosure. Respondents appealed and Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the petition on the ground that petitioner had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Petitioner had administratively appealed an alleged constructive denial, but did not appeal the agency’s determination regarding rights of access.\n\nMatter of Empire Ctr. For New York State Policy v. New York State Teacher’s Retirement Sys. – 23 N.Y.3d 438, 15 N.E.3d 271, 991 N.Y.S.2d 516 (2014) – May 6, 2014. Held that FOIL only exempts home addresses, not names, of retirees who receive benefits from the public employee’s retirement system.\n\nEmpire Golf Management, LLC v. Olivieri, 18 AD3d 334, 794 NYS2d 649 (1st Dept 2005) - “The winning proposals should be disclosed since the submission process had ended, the winning proposals were identified, and contract negotiations were well underway. Given these circumstances, the winning proposals could no longer be considered ‘competitively sensitive’ and therefore exempt from FOIL disclosure under Public Officers Law §87(2)(c)”; see Cross-Sound Ferry.\n\nEmpire Realty Corp. v. NYS Division of the Lottery, 230 AD2d 270, 657 NYS2d 504 (3rd Dept 1997) - Request involved list of names and city of residence of lotto jackpot winners and was rejected as unwarranted invasion of personal privacy by agency; agency’s regulations includes authority to publicize winnings and name and city of residence of winners; even though list would be used for commercial purpose, court ordered disclosure due to regulation authhorizing publicity, because address merely involved “city of residence” and because of lack of expectation of privacy; court limited disclosure to information “already the subject of a publicly disseminated press release”; cited Committee opinions; see Corwin.\n\nMatter of Empire Wine & Spirits, LLC v. New York State Liquor Authority, Supreme Court, Albany County, October 28, 2015. - After being served a Notice of Pleading for allegedly shipping wine to customers in different states, the petitioner submitted a FOIL request for communications in various forms pertaining to the petitioner and the interstate shipment of alcohol. The request was partially denied under §87 (2)(a), that it was material that constituted attorney work product for pending litigation. Held that to be considered attorney work product and therefore exempt under FOIL, the record must be a confidential communication that reflects legal analysis, conclusions, theory or strategy. Emails unrelated to a pending investigation or judicial proceeding are not exempt. Also to be considered an “agency” for purposes of inter-agency exception, an agency must be an entity of state or local government; see Waterford.\n\nEncore College Bookstores, Inc. v. Auxiliary Service Corporation of the State University, 87 NY2d 410, 639 NYS2d 990 (1995) - A branch of the State University (SUNY) contracted with the Auxiliary Service Corp., a not-for-profit corporation created to conduct various functions for SUNY, including operation of a campus bookstore. When request was made for booklist kept by the bookstore, the not-for-profit said it was not subject to FOIL, and SUNY said that it did not have possession of the list and that FOIL did not apply. Court of Appeals held that SUNY is an \"agency\", and citing definition of \"record\", found that the booklist was \"kept\" or \"held\" by the bookstore for SUNY and was an \"agency record\" subject to FOIL. However, Court found that the record could be withheld under §87(2)(d) because the requester, Barnes & Noble, a competitor of the entity that developed the booklist, \"would enable Encore to obtain the requisite information without expending its resources, thereby reducing its cost of business and placing Barnes & Noble at a competitive disadvantage.\"\n\nEngels v. Town of Parishville, 86 AD3d 889, 929 NYS2d 187 (3d Dept. 2011) - Attorney-client documents are confidential. Simply because records could not be found does not lead to the conclusion that records are being illegally withheld. Agency demonstrated that records could not be found after diligent search.\n\nIn re Energy & Environmental Legal Institute, et al. v. Attorney General of the State of New York, 162 A.D.3d 458, 75 N.Y.S.3d 45, Appellate Division, First Department (June 7, 2018) - Appellate Division held that trial court had “correctly found that respondent's right to invoke the inter- or intra-agency exemption to FOIL as to an email message sent to respondent was not waived when the sender added a third party to the ‘cc’ field of the email and instructed the third party to print attached materials and deliver them to respondent, in the absence of any expectation that the third party would review the substance of those materials or disclose them to others.”\n\nEspiritu v. Vance, 39 Misc.3d 1214, 975 NYS2d 365 (Table)(New York County, 2013), modified on reargument Supreme Court, New York County, May 31, 2013 – The death of applicant’s criminal defense attorney, from whom copies of records could no longer be obtained, is sufficient, under Moore, for inmate to require duplicate copies from agency subsequent to payment of appropriate copying fees and absent the application of an exemption. An agency cannot claim a blanket privilege of “public interest” but must instead justify claimed exception with some specificity. Agency’s claim that documents “do not exist in the case file” insufficient; must clarify that records never existed or that they were not found after diligent search. Modified: autopsy report confidential pursuant to New York City Charter §557 and Mitchell.\n\nMatter of Exoneration Initiative v. New York City Police Dept., 39 Mis.3d 962, Supreme Court, New York County, June 11, 2013 - Petitioner was entitled to attorney fees after substantially prevailing in the July and March cases against the Department. The NYPD contended that petitioner was a pro se litigant and not entitled to attorney fees and that the fees charged were excessive in both time and amount per hour. Held that public interest legal organizations are entitled to receive attorney fees after substantially prevailing as a named litigant. Also held that rates charged far attorney’s fees must fall within the range of hourly rates charged by private sector attorneys of similar experience in the community. The petitioner was awarded all but $780 for which they billed. Note: reversed on other grounds.\n\nThe Exoneration Initiative v. The New York City Police Dept. – 114 A.D.3d 436, 980 N.Y.S.2d 73 (1st Dept. 2014). February 6, 2014. Held that disclosure of identities of witnesses could endanger life or safety, INDEX- Witness Statements\n\nFappiano v. New York City Police Department, 95 NY2d 738, 724 NYS2d 685 (2001) - Section 50-b of the Civil Rights Law prohibits agencies and courts from disclosing records insofar as records identify victims of sex offenses. Held that an exception in §50-b authorizing disclosure to persons “charged” with a sex offense did not apply to those seeking post-conviction relief. Consequently, records sought were specifically exempted from disclosure by statute. Court was careful to point out that §50-b does not authorize a “blanket denial” of access and that it applies only to records which if disclosed would identify the victim of a sex offense. See also, Karlin\n\nM. Farbman & Sons v. New York City Health and Hosps. Corp., 62 NY2d 75, 476 NYS2d 69 (1984) - Court of Appeals reversed Appellate Division and held that \"access to records of a government agency under the Freedom of Information Law...is not affected by the fact that there is pending or potential litigation between the person making the request and the agency\"; Court distinguished Freedom of Information Law from Article 31 of the CPLR, finding that access under Article 31 depends on status and need\", while \"Freedom of Information Law's mandate of open disclosure requires that an agency's public records remain as available to its litigation adversary as to any other person\"; held that CPLR Article 31 is not a statute specifically exempting records from disclosure; also found that records are \"reasonably described\" when the agency \"may locate the records in question\". See also Brady, Burke, Fitzpatrick, Moussa\n\nFarrell v. Village Board of Trustees, 83 Misc.2d 125, 372 NYS2d 905 (Broome County 1975) - Reprimands of particular police officers following investigation of off-duty employment held to be available; disclosure resulted in permissible, not unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Original Law: §§88(1), (3), (7)\n\nFederation of New York State Rifle and Pistol Clubs, Inc. v.
