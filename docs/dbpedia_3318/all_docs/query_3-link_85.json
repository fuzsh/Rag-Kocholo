He was the oldest child of five children. John’s father was a remarkable leader in the Revolution and Second President of the United States. His mother Abigail was a remarkable woman who was bright and resilient. He did not have a typical childhood. His family crissed crossed the Atlantic Ocean in sailing ships, despite the trip would take five weeks and was dangerous. They were as comfortalible in the embassies and palaces of Europe as they were in Massachusetts. John was raised to lead. His parents made sure that John was well educated and knew important people from which he could learn from. At the age of ten, he accompanied his father to France and the Netherlands. During this time, John learned Dutch, German, and French. He had started working for the government as a translator at the age of fourteen. His life was one of public service until his death in 1848.Along the way, John was a diplomat, Secretary of State, President of the United States, State Senator, U.S. Senator, and member of the house. John toward the end of the Revolutionary war, witness the signing of the Independence. John studied law for two years with Theophiles Parsons long before becoming a lawyer. He met Miss. Louise Catherine Johgon, daughter of the U.S. Consul in London. They married the 26th of July 1797, even though Abigail John’s mother opposed. Through this union, Louise was pregnant fourteen times, losing nine due to miscarriages. Louise raised five children and a daughter of John’s sister. John and Louise had a very difficult marriage. He was also leaving to do services for his country leaving Louise alone. She blamed her miscarriages on his absence. John’s eldest son committed suicide. Louise blamed her husband for this also. Although he enjoyed the practice of law, the challenge of politics soon led him back into government service. His father had become Vice President of the United States in 1789. So he was never far from the family enterprise. When President George Washington issued his neutrality Proclamation in 1793, trying to avoid participation in the wars of French revolution inspite of European depredation on U.S. shipping, many important people criticed him, including members of his own political party, the federalists. John Quincy Adams supporting Washington’s decision in a series of articles, written the articles and was so impressed with the ability of John Adams that he appendicle diplomatic reprehensive to the Netherlands. It was while he was visiting London in 1799, members from petitioning about slavery. Adams fought it, believing that members of Congress should have the right to discuss issue. As secretary to his father in Europe, he became an accomplished linguist and diarist. After graduating from Harvard College, he became a lawyer. At the age 36 he was appointed Minster to the Netherlands. Later being promoted to the Berlin Legation. In 1802, he was elected United States Senate. Six years later President Madison appointed him Minster of Russia. Serving under President Monroe, Adams was one of amercing great secretaries of state. Arraigning with England for the Joint occupation of the Oregon Country obtaining from Spain the recession of formatting with the President the Morne Doctrine. In 1814, he headed the US delegation of Henry Clay, J. Bayard, Jonathan Russel and Albert Gallatin, to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain to end the War of 1812. The treaty of Ghent was signed in December 1814. Adams said it was only a truce. He was rewarded by President Madison by sending him as the US envoy to Great Britain, a post he held until James Monroe named him Secretary of State in 1817. This position was a stepping stone to the Presidency. In political tradition of the early 19th century Adams as Secretary of State was considered the political heir to the Presidency. In 1848, he collapsed on the floor of the House from a stroke and was carried to Speaker’s room, where two days later he died. He was buried with his parents. John was an extremely complex person. To many who knew him including his son Charles. His feelings seemed impenetrable, as if he were hiding behind an “ Iron Mask”. Because of his recurring depression he often appeared angry. Nevertheless, he had an outgoing, social, even joyful side as well. He was a man of diverse interests among them gandening and silvilcature, religion and church often dancing, walking and swimming, poetry and astronomy. In there he found some relief from the pressures of public life.John in many respects paralleled the career as well as the temperament and viewpoints of his illustrious father. John also financed scientific expeditions and the erection of an observatory. He urged the United States to take lead in the development of a national university. John strongly showed his interests in science, development, and education. We benefit from John Quincy Adams through his leadership.He was a great Senator. He made numerous attempts to stop slavery. He was always engaged in a fight against civil liberties. He was known for being a great Congressman. During this occupation he passed the gag rule providing that the House automatically table petitions against slavery. I think the most impressive thing about John Quincy Adams is his ability to be a good speaker and leader. He showed people the will to succeed and expand. He displayed how working hard can achieve goals. John Quincy Adams inspires me because I am a relative of Him. He was a good leader, Senator, and a Prime Minister. He shows an ability to adjust to diverse situations. He shows the importance of learning and strong education. Through all of this he show that no matter of one’s education or upbringing you are still just a man.\n\nJohn Wesley Adams\n\nChaplain John Wesley Adams, son of John and Mary (Taggart) Adams, was born in Townsend, Massachusetts, May 23, 1832, and is the seventh generation from Henry Adams, the ancestor of the Presidents.

In 1883 he was poet of the veterans' reunion at Weirs, New Hampshire. By request he read. an original poem at the dedication of his regiment's monument on the Gettysburg battle-field (1885). He always enjoyed the affection and confidence of General Marston, and was chosen to make the dedicatory address when the general's monument was presented to the town of Exeter by the veterans of the Second Regiment, May 30, 1891. In 1890-91 Mr. Adams made a five-months' tour abroad, visiting many of the most interesting localities in the British Isles, the continent of Europe, Greece, Syria, Palestine, and Lower and Upper Egypt.
