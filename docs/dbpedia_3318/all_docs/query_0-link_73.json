Harvey MYERS, a prominent lawyer of Covington, Kentucky, who was brutally murdered by Col. W. G. TERRILL, of that city, on account of questions asked by the former in a divorce suit in which he was employed against Terrill, was a former resident of Chenango county. The Union gives the following brief sketch of his career: \"Mr. Myers was born in Bainbridge, in this county, in 1828. His parents were poor, and he had but few advantages in early life, his education being such as the common schools of his native town afforded. He moved to Kentucky in 1851, and taught school for a short time, meanwhile pursuing the study of law. In 1858 he entered a law office in Covington, and was admitted to practice in 1854. As a lawyer he was one of the most prominent in the State of Kentucky, having a large practice in the Court of Appeals and in the U. S. Courts. He frequently acted as Judge pro tem in the Circuit Court, when cases were before that tribunal in which the Judge of the Court was interested. He was elected to the State Legislature in 1865, but declined to serve, on the ground that the election was not a free one but that the voters were under the coercion of Federal bayonets. In 1872 he ran for Congress on the Republican ticket, and was defeated by Judge Arthur. In business he was successful, having amassed a considerable estate from a large and remunerative practice, estimated at $65,000. He leaves a wife and six young children. MARRIED.

After a trial of four years in this highly responsible office, he was re-elected in 1859 and continued to discharge its duties until the close of December, 1863, a period of eight years.

The people of West Oneonta were startled on Sunday morning last, by the announcement that Daniel BEMUS, a young man twenty three years of age, employed in the railroad shops of this place, had been drowned while bathing in a small branch of the Otego creek, near Culver's pond. Two or three companions were with him at the time, and from their statements we learn the following facts. Before going into the water, which was about 14 feet deep, Bemus informed them that he was going to touch bottom. He then dove into the deepest part of the hole, and never came up. Help was at once summoned, but the water was muddy, and it was between two and three hours before the body would be found. He was a married man, and leaves a wife and one child. MARRIED.

No Married or Died Notices. 7/3/1874 A coroner's inquest was held on the body of Mrs. larissa HILL, who died at Burdick settlement, in the town of Lincklaen, on the 3d ult. Deceased was a lady 69 years of age, and died under circumstances that led to the suspicion that she had been poisoned by her step-daughter. No traces of poison were to be found. Mrs. Clara SANFORD, living with her son-in-law near Dean's Corners, Del. Co., committed suicide on the night of the 23d ult. She retired with the family, evidently in good spirits. Not appearing at breakfast in the morning search was made, and she was found hanging in the kitchen chamber. Deceased was sixty-five years old, and highly respected in that community. No cause can be assigned for the suicide. On Wednesday, (24th ult.), about eleven o'clock, report came that Christopher KELTENBACK, of Roxbury, had committed suicide by hanging. He had been a cripple for over ten years, and had been cared for by his brother Frederick. This was the day appointed for the wedding of one of Frederick's daughters, who had taken all the care of him during his sickness. He had often said to her, \"When you go, I am going too.\" One of the girls was sent to tell their uncle to come in and see the wedding; she soon returned with the news that he was hanging by a rope in the barn. After his body had been taken to the house, and the wedding ceremonies performed, Coroner Street was at once notified, who held an inquest in the evening, and the jury decided that \"Deceased came to his death by hanging.\" Deceased was about seventy years of age. - Andes Recorder.

There is a gathering at the residence of Mr. Cyrus DeFOREST in this city, a family reunion such as, we believe, has few parallels. It consists of the 5 sons and 3 daughters of Gideon DeFOREST and wife, all born in Edmeston, Otsego county, the youngest of which is now sixty-one years old, the eldest being seventy-nine. Their family circle has never been broken, except by the accidental death of a son two years ago, and this meeting of all its members, whose homes are in various parts of the country, some living in Wisconsin, some on Staten Island, and the others widely scattered, seems quite remarkable. The names of this family, given in the order of the ages, are as follows, Abel Birdsey DeForest, born December 30, 1795; Lee DeForest, born August 7, 1798, Sally DeForest CAMPBELL, Cyrus Hawley DeForest, Maria DeForest SNYDER, Charles Augustus DeForest, Tracy Rob DeForest and Harriet DeForest FULLER, the youngest born July 28, 1813. The father and mother of the family moved from Connecticut and settled in Otsego county when it was a perfectly uninhabited wilderness and there the family was reared, the primitive mode of their living doing much to give them their robust constitutions and thus prolong their lives. The father died in 1840 and the mother in 1844. Fourteen years ago a reunion of this same family took place at the residence of Lee DeForest, who then lived on part of the old farm in Edmeston.

He was to all appearances as well as usual in the morning, and had gone to his mill as was his custom. About 11 o'clock he was seized with an attack of heart disease, to which he had been subject for many years. He was in the act of giving some direction to one of the workmen and spoke but once after the attack, saying, \"catch me,\" and expired at once. Mr. Goodyear was born in New Haven, Connecticut, July 20th, 1792, and was consequently over 82 years old. His father emigrated to the town of Locke, Cayuga county, and became a neighbor of the father of Milliard FILLMORE. Here young Goodyear and young Fillmore commenced their education in one of the few log school houses then found in that pioneer neighborhood. Both these families lost their farm through failure of the title. The senior Goodyear, with an ox team, moved his family and settled on what was then to be the great thoroughfare between Albany and Buffalo, about 14 miles west of Albany. He was the oldest of a family of six children and early learned that he was to aid in the business of getting a living. When only thirteen or fourteen years of age he carried on a small store, the goods being furnished by a merchant at Albany, and he selling them on commission. Subsequently his father purchased a farm at or near Lawyersville, where he carried on the business of farming and merchandising. Here they were again injured financially, by a fire which destroyed their saw mill. In 1822 Jared married Ann Eliza, the only child of Peter COLLIER, and he was the first Postmaster at Colliersville, an office which he continued to hold for thirty-five years. Within a year, he received information that he had overpaid his account, and there was a balance due him from the department, and in due time he received a check for $25, he having given one half for collecting-the whole amount being $50-showing that Mr. Goodyear was one of the old time officials who did not rob the government. He was Supervisor of his town for several years, and was at one time Vice President of the A. & S. Railroad. He in fact saved the road by his vote at one time , and was the back bone of the project; so that the people of Susquehanna Valley are under lasting obligations to Mr. Goodyear for some of the greatest improvements they have ever had. It is said that he was never known to oppose the poor; but had greatly aided many young men in the commencement of their career. The funeral took place on Monday, from the residence of the deceased and was attended by a very large number of people. Among those present were many of the old and present directors of the A. & S. Railroad company. Superintendent Morse provided a special train free from Oneonta to Colliers and a large number of our citizens availed themselves of the opportunity of paying their last respects to the memory of the deceased. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. H. H. All"
