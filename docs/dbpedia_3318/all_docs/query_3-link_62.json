After receiving his bachelor's degree at Dartmouth College, he accompanied his astronomy professor, Edwin B. Frost, to Yerkes Observatory, where he began graduate study. After two years there and one more year of study at Munich, he was summoned by his Yerkes director, George Ellery Hale, to help establish the",
