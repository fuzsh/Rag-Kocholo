        "text": "There can be little doubt that Serena Williams is the best women’s tennis player of this and maybe any era.\n\nThere could be no finer choice than Serena Williams to light the cauldron at the opening ceremony if Los Angeles wins the 2024 Summer Games. Now the dilemma. By herself? Because maybe there could be an even better choice: with sister Venus, too?\n\nBoth are Olympic champions. More, both have shown not just great but unwavering commitment to the Olympic movement and, indeed, the Olympic spirit. Most important: the Williams sisters are proof positive that you can dream and big dreams can take you anywhere and everywhere. Isn't that what the Olympics are about?\n\nSerena Williams confirmed Wednesday she is 20 weeks pregnant. That means she was already close to two months pregnant when she won her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, the Australian Open on January 28.\n\nUnderstandably, the cauldron suggestion is maybe getting just a little ahead of things, because the International Olympic Committee won’t select the site of the 2024 Summer Games until September 13, Los Angeles and Paris the two contestants, and it’s hardly an overhead slam that LA will prevail.\n\nBut if LA wins:\n\nThe opening ceremony would be July 19, 2024. That's a Friday if you're, you know, a planner.\n\nIt would begin with a torch relay down the row of columns of the LA Memorial Coliseum, which played host to the 1932 and 1984 Games. About 70,000 people would likely be in the Coliseum for a Hollywood-style spectacle and virtual reality experience of what’s to come next.\n\nWhich is:\n\nThe relay would pass landmarks on the streets of LA until it reaches the new NFL stadium, which would hold 100,000 people.\n\nWho, at the end, would light the cauldron?\n\nSurely there are many — for emphasis, many — luminaries deserving of consideration.\n\nJust for starters: Magic Johnson. Allyson Felix. Kerri Walsh. Michael Phelps. Ashton Eaton. Katie Ledecky. Mia Hamm. Abby Wambach. Apolo Ohno.\n\nSerena and Venus Williams grew up Compton, California. The LA84 Foundation — the legacy initiative from the 1984 Games, which funds youth sports in Southern California — has underwritten the exact kinds of programs that helped give the Williams sisters their start.\n\nPlaying doubles together, Venus and Serena Williams won gold at the 2000, 2008 and 2012 Games.\n\nAnyone who saw Serena Williams power to gold in the Olympic women’s singles tournament at Wimbledon in 2012 will tell you: it was a virtuoso performance.\n\nIn the final, Serena Williams thrashed — just crushed — Maria Sharapova, 6-0, 6-1.\n\nThe London 2012 victory made Serena Williams only the second woman to achieve a Golden Slam. Steffi Graf won at the Olympics in 1988 after sweeping all four major titles.\n\nRemember the dance Serena Williams danced at that medal ceremony after she put on her Team USA jacket?\n\n\"I don't think I've ever danced like that,\" she said then. \"I don't even know where the dance came from.\"\n\nRemember last year in Rio? When a number of the world’s top golfers were, like, nah, don’t want to go? Serena Williams battled injuries throughout 2016. Where were the Williams sisters during the Rio Games? In red, white and blue, in Brazil, representing the United States. Where, it should be noted, Venus Williams won a silver in mixed doubles with Rajeev Ram, her fifth Olympic medal. Venus Williams is the Sydney 2000 women’s Olympic singles winner.\n\nSerena alone at the cauldron? Serena and Venus together?\n\nBoth are great, and deserving, champions.\n\nBoth have answered the call for their country.\n\nIf this moment goes from possibility to reality, and again the disclaimer, it's right now just an if -- it would be a great call for their country, in service to the Olympic dreams of little girls and boys everywhere, to do the right thing on that Friday night seven years from now in July.\n\nWithin hours after the release by Russian hackers of U.S. athletes’ doping results, Victor Conte, the Bay-Area based figure at the center of the BALCO scandal, a guy who knows what’s what when it comes to the doping scene, sent out a note Tuesday to a wide email circle. It said, in part, “This is gonna get ugly.” Gonna get ugly?! This is ugly from the get-go. And it’s likely to stay ugly for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis hack operates on a staggering number of levels. There are so many threads to pull: here, there, seemingly everywhere. The whole thing is designed not just to stir public opinion but to stir up nothing less than chaos in world sport and, perhaps, more — to agitate and antagonize governments in public as well as private diplomacy.\n\nThe basics:\n\nFollowing World Anti-Doping Agency reports over the past several months that asserted widespread and state-sponsored doping in Russia, about a third of the Russian Olympic delegation, including virtually the entire track and field team, and the entire Russian Paralympic squad ended up banned from Rio 2016. The Paralympics are still ongoing.\n\nOn Tuesday, WADA confirmed that its database had been breached. At issue: confidential medical records of athletes who took part in last month’s Rio Olympics.\n\nWADA further said that hackers gained access via an International Olympic Committee-created account.\n\nThe perpetrators, accordng to WADA: Fancy Bear, a Russian entity suspected as well of breaching the Democratic National Committee’s computers.\n\nOn Monday, Fancy Bear released information on four American athletes: the gymnast Simone Biles, basketball standout Elena Delle Donne and the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams.\n\nThe documents show that each of the four had permission to take prescription drugs. In some cases, those drugs were used during the Games.\n\nSome of the drugs contained banned substances.\n\nBut nobody is facing a doping case.\n\nThe reason: the anti-doping rules specifically say that there can be exceptions for certain medicines. Athletes can use a variety of stuff that might otherwise lead to a positive test if, one, they get a doctor’s note and, two, they file the appropriate paperwork.\n\nThat paperwork is called, in the jargon, a “therapeutic use exemption.”\n\nTo emphasize: there is no suggestion that any of the four have done anything wrong.\n\nU.S. officials have linked Fancy Bear to GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. For what it’s worth, the Russian government said Tuesday it had no connection to Fancy Bear.\n\nThis is the backdrop. From there, the super-obvious starting place:\n\nWithin Russia if not elsewhere, many will be tempted to draw the conclusion that the Americans, who won the Olympic medals count in Rio going away, are doping.\n\nIt is already widely believed that considerable numbers of U.S. athletes take advantage of TUE exemptions.\n\nTo stress: obtaining a TUE is within the rules.\n\nIt is also the case that, as in many things, perception is as important than reality, if not more so. Indeed, a Fancy Bear statement declares that U.S. athletes “got their licenses for doping.”\n\nNext:\n\nTension is high between the IOC and WADA over the Russians. This is sure to add to that. To reiterate: the hack came through an IOC-created account. If you want to appreciate the delicious irony there, or maybe the hackers’ knowing instigation, go right ahead — a WADA hack through an IOC account. Who to blame, and for what?\n\nThere’s this:\n\nLegally, do any of the four athletes, American citizens all, have recourse in the U.S. or Canadian court systems (WADA is based in Montreal) for money damages now that private medical records have been breached? Who is responsible for not safeguarding the sort of records that everyone knows — if you have ever been to even one American doctor’s office — is supposed to be private? For this sort of breach, what might be an appropriate remedy?\n\nThen there another super-obvious follow-on:\n\nEvery single sports federation and national Olympic committee anywhere and everywhere in the world ought to be wondering: is my data safe?\n\nThen there is the timing:\n\nIn mid-August, details emerged about the hack of Russian athlete and whistleblower Yulia Stepanova.\n\nNext week WADA plans a post-Rio “think tank” to explore how it is the anti-doping campaign got into this crack, as well as others. Fancy Bear: “We will also disclose exclusive information about other national Olympic teams later.”\n\nBut, to start, there’s the central fact: these are Americans.\n\nSo why these four? Could it have anything to do with the fact that three are African-American while Delle Donne earlier this month disclosed she is gay and engaged to be married? Maybe these facts mean nothing. Or maybe it's naive to pretend otherwise.\n\nBiles, moreover, carried the U.S. flag in the Rio Olympic closing ceremony.\n\nThe Williams sisters? When Maria Sharapova, the Russian tennis star, who carried the Russian flag into the London 2012 opening ceremony, is in the midst of a two-year ban for meldonium?\n\nSharapova’s appeal is due to be decided in early October. And WADA has walked back the rules in a number of other meldonium cases because of uncertainty over how long the stuff, which is made in Latvia and is designed to help patients with certain heart-related issues, stays in the body.\n\nBiles acknowledged after the leak that she takes Ritalin or its equivalent for ADHD. It is \"nothing to be ashamed of,” she said in a tweet.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Simone_Biles/status/775785767855611905\n\nAt the same time, it would be a huge surprise if hackers didn’t intend for a parallel to be drawn — and, importantly, distinctions, too — between her and U.S. sprinter Justin Gatlin.\n\nGatlin has — unfairly — been made into the poster guy for U.S. Olympic scene doping. Truth: he is far more a victim of circumstance.\n\nSo: Biles takes Ritalin (or, again, its equivalent). Gatlin took Adderall for ADD. It’s naive once more to pretend someone looking for connection would not see something there.\n\nAt the same time:\n\nShe gets nothing. He got a year. Why the difference? How can any sort of “fair” system allow such discrepancies? Returning to the Sharapova matter and meldonium: same question.\n\nThis is not just about American athletes, meanwhile. It’s about the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, too.\n\nUSADA chief executive Tygart, who is a very smart guy, has arguably made himself over the course of this year into the loudest and longest voice for an outright Russian ban.\n\nThis would thus seem to be as much about an attempt to embarrass Tygart as it is the four athletes.\n\nIn a statement, Tygart said, “It’s unthinkable that in the Olympic movement, hackers would illegally obtain confidential medical information in an attempt to smear athletes to make it look as if they have done something wrong.”\n\nPlease. It’s not unthinkable. If revenge is a thing, it’s totally rational if not foreseeable.\n\nFinally, this, and this is where you have to really wonder how this is going to end up.\n\nIf none of this had come to pass, if WADA had been left alone, WADA — this is the dead-bang truth — can help the Russians.\n\nIn the context of getting back onto the track, for instance: what do the Russians want if not need? Answer: to get complaint again with all the rules so that Russian athletes can compete normally.\n\nFor its part, WADA wants, maybe even needs, to get the Russians compliant. And as soon as possible.\n\nThe tough sell is getting the rest of the world to believe the Russians are compliant.\n\nThat just got a lot, lot tougher.\n\nEUGENE — The women’s 100 hurdles here Friday at the 2016 U.S. Olympic Track Trials proved one of those rare sports events that truly lived up to expectations. It was the race of the meet: Brianna Rollins winning in 12.34 seconds, the second-fastest Trials final ever.\n\nThe second- through seventh-place finishers made for the fastest finishes for place in Trials history. Kristi Castlin took second, in 12.5, Nia Ali — just 14 months after giving birth to a son, Titus — 12.55.\n\nThe immediate aftermath made the race all the more memorable. Castlin, given a moment on NBC, said this:\n\n\"I really just want to dedicate this race to every single family, every person who has to go on after losing someone they love to gun violence,\" adding, \"It really was heavy on my heart, so I really wanted to dedicate that to everyone in the world who's had to deal with that.”\n\nMany will say that sports are, or ought to be, separate from politics. Indeed, it’s tempting here in snug little college-town Eugene -- and, more, within the track and field bubble that is historic Hayward Field, with a stadium-record 22,847 jammed in on Saturday -- to deem events in Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas far away.\n\nThis ignores reality.\n\nAs the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach put it in a speech in South Korea in 2014, “In the past, some have said that sport has nothing to do with politics, or they have said that sport has nothing to do with money or business. And this is just an attitude which is wrong and which we can not afford anymore.\n\n“We are living in the middle of society and that means we have to partner up with the politicians who run this world.”\n\nHe also observed, in a speech at the United Nations in November 2013, that it “must always be clear in the relationship between sport and politics that the role of sport is always to build bridges,” adding, “It is never to build walls.”\n\nTo that end, sports stars can have a powerful impact in advancing precisely the sort of dialogue we — all of us — need as we head further into the heat of a summer that, with two potentially volatile political conventions coming up, increasingly seems to evoke the discord and discontent of 1968.\n\nAcross the United States, Saturday saw protests tied to police shootings of black men: in Baton Rouge, San Francisco, Chicago, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nThe flag at the southern end of Hayward Field has been flying this second half of these Trials at half-mast — in unspoken testimony to our country’s unhealed wounds connected to race and policing.\n\nIf anyone needs a living reminder of how far we have come and how far we have yet to go — John Carlos, whose black-gloved left fist along with Tommie Smith’s right made history at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, has been here in Eugene this week, a powerful reminder of how we can all do better.\n\nIf Friday's women's 100 hurdles was spectacular, so too was the bang-bang-bang sequence that closed Saturday's run: the men's 5000, won by 41-year-old Bernard Lagat; the men's 200, won by Justin Gatlin, who earlier in the meet had taken the 100, with 400 winner LaShawn Merritt running second; and the men's 110 hurdles, won by University of Oregon star Devon Allen.\n\nPunctuating that brilliance: an appeal from Gatlin, over the Hayward loudspeakers that we all do better by each other.\n\n\"There is a lot that has been going on in America the last couple days,\" he said a few moments later, in the press tent. \"It's sad that it happens around the 4th of July, when we should all be proud to be Americans.\n\n\"I just told everyone in the stadium, I said, I challenged them: 'Love someone. Leave the stadium, because there's so much love in this stadium the last couple days. Take that love with you. Just give it to somebody you have never loved before.' Go up to them and say, 'Hey, I love you for being an American.'\n\n\"We need that as Americans. When we are overseas, sometimes you don't see an American flag. Maybe sometimes you see one American flag. Those people holding up American flags are so proud to be Americans. And I want everybody to understand that when we go down to Rio, we are representing the United States of America. We want to represent with pride. It's just so sad to see everything that is happening right now. I just want everybody to be happy.\"\n\nGun violence has been a scourge on the American landscape for far too long.\n\nIn Kristi Castlin's case, the issue is deeply personal.\n\nHer father, Rodney Castlin, was shot to death on December 7, 2000. He was the night manager of a motel in Kennesaw, Georgia, killed in a robbery that produced $304. He was just 36.\n\nJust weeks ago, James Lorenzo Randolph, now 34, was convicted of multiple felonies in connection with the shooting, including murder, and sentenced to three consecutive life terms plus 35 years. He was connected to the case in 2012 by a fingerprint finally run through the FBI's national database.\n\nKristi Castlin turned 28 on Thursday. She was just 12 when her father was murdered.\n\n\"I definitely know first-hand now it feels, not just to be a child but to lose someone you love to gun violence,\" she said in an interview, adding, \"Things that money buys, all the material things -- when you lose someone that you love, it’s really hard. It’s just sad whether black, white or indifferent, people treating lives like they are disposable.\"\n\nWe need more of this.\n\nMore stories about the real-life impact of gun violence.\n\nMore real people -- and that includes athletes -- to speak up about what's so obviously right.\n\nWe need initiatives like the one the NBA launched last December — with stars such as Stephen Curry, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Joakim Noah lending their voices to a pubic-service announcement in support of Everytown for Gun Safety. It ends with Curry, the Golden State Warriors star, saying, “We can end gun violence.”\n\nIn the same vein, LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers star, has been outspoken on the matter. He took to Twitter Thursday with this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KingJames/status/751288463375233025\n\nSerena Williams, the tennis star, won the Wimbledon women’s singles title on Saturday, a record-tying 22nd Grand Slam; later Saturday, Serena and sister Venus Williams won the Wimbledon women’s doubles championship, a 14th Grand Slam doubles title together.\n\nHere was Serena Williams a few months ago in Wired magazine:\n\n\"So to those of you involved in equality movements like Black Lives Matter, I say this: Keep it up. Don’t let those trolls stop you. We’ve been through so much for so many centuries, and we shall overcome this too (see “Get Up, Stand Up”). To other people, I say: When someone’s harassing someone else, speak up! J.K. Rowling spoke up for me this summer, and it was an amazing feeling — I thought, 'Well, I can speak up, too.' ”\n\nTo be clear: it’s not that every athlete, whether on the Olympic team or not, has a responsibility to speak up.\n\nNo one is saying that is an imperative.\n\nBut it’s also the case that the U.S. track team, along with the U.S. basketball teams, makes for the picture of the diverse and multicultural America that we genuinely are in these early years of the 21st century.\n\nWith that comes opportunity.\n\n\"We have a voice,\" Gatlin also said. \"We should be able to use that voice with love and caring.\"\n\nAnd unlike the basketball teams — in particular, the NBA stars — track and field athletes are way more often built like most of us, meaning the intimidation factor for the average fan is way lower. Also, the track stars tend to be remarkably accessible.\n\nBefore Saturday’s action at Hayward, the distance standout Mary Cain was walking down Agate Street, stopping — just like everyone else — at the long light at Franklin Boulevard.\n\nA few minutes later, Matthew Centrowitz — it would be shocking if he isn’t top-three in Sunday’s men’s 1500 final — went jogging by on Franklin, out for an off-day slow run.\n\nDeeDee Trotter, the three-time Olympian at 400 meters, bronze medalist in 2012 and two-time gold winner in the relays (2004, 2012), saw her 2016 bid get as far as the semifinals.\n\nOn Saturday, she posted to Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DTrott400m/status/751858033832046592\n\nSimilarly, Hazel Clark, three times an Olympian at 800 meters, said on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hazelclarktv/status/751887521513177089\n\nMichael Tinsley, London 2012 silver medalist in the men's 400-meter hurdles, said Friday after posting the top qualifying time, 49.15, in the event semifinals, “I want to start off saying that black lives matter. My condolences to the people who lost their lives to cops and condolences go out to the cops that were killed in Dallas.”\n\nJason Richardson, London 2012 silver medalist in the 110-meter hurdles, gold medalist in the event at the 2011 world championships, took to Twitter earlier this week to tell a story about how, when he was 17, he was stopped by police and given a traffic ticket.\n\nRichardson posted: “Only after closing the truck did I realize the officer was standing at his door, hand on gun …” And: DON’T tell me what to wear, how to speak, or what to do until something like this happens to you.”\n\nAnd this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JaiRich/status/750930222111797249\n\nThe next day, Thursday, he posted a follow-up:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JaiRich/status/751081933535227904\n\nLike Trotter, Sanya Richards-Ross, the London 2012 400 gold medalist (five medals in all over three Games, four gold), saw her competitive career come here to an end. Battling injury, she started but could not finish the first round in the 400.\n\nShe has already made the smooth transition to broadcasting. On Instagram this week, she posted this:\n\nThe flag fluttered softly in the breeze Saturday at Hayward.\n\nBefore the Olympic Games in Rio comes the Republican convention, the week of July 18 in Cleveland, and the Democratic convention, the week of July 25 in Philadelphia.\n\nWe all — athletes and the rest of us — have the chance to speak up.\n\nJust as Robert F. Kennedy did on April 4, 1968, in Indianapolis, upon learning of the death of Martin Luther King Jr. Here is what the senator said, just two months before he himself would be killed by gun violence:\n\n“Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love, and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In this difficult day, this difficult time for the United States, it’s perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are, and what direction we want to move in.\n\n“For those of you who are black — considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible — you can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.\n\n“We can move in that direction as a country and greater polarization, black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another.\n\n“Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, [with] compassion and love. He died in the cause of that effort.\n\n“What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.\n\n“So I shall ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King, that’s true, but more importantly, to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love — a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke.\n\n“We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We’ve had difficult times in the past but we — and we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it’s not the end of disorder; it’s perhaps well to ask what kind of nation we are.\n\n“But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.\n\n“Dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world,\" a reference indeed to the Olympic ideal.\n\n“Let us dedicate ourselves to that,\" Senator Kennedy said in conclusion, \"and say a prayer for our country and our people.”\n\nFriendship, excellence and respect — these are the key values underpinning the mission of the International Olympic Committee, indeed the Olympic enterprise worldwide. Moreover, the IOC likes to say that athletes are at the center of everything everyone in the Olympic movement does. Two episodes over the weekend raise serious questions about whether both are true, or just so much lip service. And with the IOC’s policy-making executive board meeting later this week in Switzerland, the issue becomes what — if anything — the IOC is going to do about it.\n\nThe first:\n\nShamil Tarpischev, the head of the Russian tennis federation and an IOC member since 1994, got caught saying on a talk show that sisters Serena and Venus Williams were “brothers” and and “scary” to look at.\n\nHe denied any “malicious intent,” according to Associated Press and said his quotes had been taken out of context.\n\n“The IOC will directly contact Mr. Tarpischev to ask him for a full explanation of his comments,” a spokesman said Monday in response to a request for comment.\n\nThe second:\n\nMany runners at Sunday’s Beijing Marathon opted for particle-filtering surgical masks to cope with the oppressive smog blanketing the city. The smog was so bad the U.S. Embassy rated the air quality hazardous.\n\n“Actually, on a normal day, nobody would run in such conditions,\" Liu Zhenyu, a runner and computer engineer, told Associated Press. “But the event is happening today, so what can we do?”\n\nEven the People’s Daily China acknowledged conditions were bad.\n\nTo be clear, the IOC itself had nothing to do with the Beijing Marathon.\n\nBut — Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan, are the only two cities in the world that are left in the race for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nSo here are the choices:\n\nBeijing, where the air is so bad — and this, six years after the 2008 Summer Games, amid promises then by the Chinese authorities that it was going to get better, instead of worse — that runners are wearing surgical masks to try to get through the running of a marathon?\n\nOr Almaty, where remarks last week from the director of the ice rink in Astana proved unusually revealing. The Asian Winter Games in Kazakhstan in 2011 split time between Astana and Almaty; the 2022 plan, at least for now, is to focus solely on Almaty.\n\n“We have to formulate our bid something like this: ‘The Olympic Games in Almaty — the cheapest, thriftiest, smartest Games,” said rink director Nail Nurov.\n\nHe went on to say, referring to the $51 billion figure associated with the 2014 Games, “What the Russians have done in Sochi is a serious problem,” because by spending so much, “they raised the bar to “unbelievable organizational heights.” The perceived “rule” that each edition of the Games must better the preceding one was, he said, probably why Oslo, Munich, Krakow, St. Moritz/Davos, Stockholm and Lviv had said no thanks to 2022.\n\nOh, and in 2013 voters in Austria said no to a 2028 Summer Games bid as well.\n\nIf you were writing a slogan, and at the risk of being perhaps overly glib, what would you have?\n\nBeijing 2022: “Most Polluted Games Ever And No Mountains Remotely Close.”\n\nAlmaty 2022: “Cheapest Games Ever.”\n\nTo use an American saying: this is no way to run a railroad.\n\nThree times in recent weeks, after Oslo dropped out, reducing the number of purportedly viable candidates from three to two, this space has urged the IOC to consider whether the 2022 campaign as it stands now is best practices, and to put the whole thing on pause for six months.\n\nThe IOC has said it is committed to its process.\n\nIn ordinary times, that would be a defensible position.\n\nAs this space has pointed out, however, this is an extraordinary situation, and extraordinary times call for an extraordinary re-think — and leadership.\n\nLest all this be seen as the promotion of a 2022 late-stage bid by the U.S. Olympic Committee from Denver and Salt Lake City — there is no signal that is in the works. The USOC is intent on 2024, if that still seems do-able after the IOC’s all-members vote on President Thomas Bach’s “Agenda 2020” review and potential reform plan in December.\n\nWhat has to be asked, however, is why other cities aren’t even being given a chance to see if they might be interested. Is the IOC quietly doing due diligence? Shouldn’t it be?\n\nTo reiterate: the IOC has $880 million to give to the winning city, which would cover nearly half, if not more, of a prudent organizing committee’s operating costs.\n\nWhen Oslo dropped out, the IOC said it intended “to communicate, to communicate, to communicate” about the advantages of bidding for the Games.\n\nIt has been nearly three weeks now.\n\nThere has been no such communication.\n\nThere has been an announcement that the IOC intends to meet with sports officials in Norway about what went wrong there.\n\nWhy meet with sports officials? If you want a debrief, fine. But in this context, what authority do such sports officials have? It was the government that pulled the plug. The politicians are the ones paying the bills. If you want to do something constructive, meet with the politicians, as awkward, weird, uncomfortable, whatever it might be.\n\nRemember: the Lillehammer Youth Games are in 2016. Who’s paying for those?\n\nAs Bach said in September in South Korea at the Asian Games — and it is a profound mystery why more people have not picked up on this huge statement — sports and politics absolutely do mix.\n\nWhich leads, in its way, back to Tarpischev.\n\nTarpischev is close to Russian president Vladimir Putin. When Bach was elected IOC president, the very first call he — that is, Bach — took was from Putin.\n\nSo whatever is going to happen is going to be complex and layered.\n\nTarpischev, 66, has already been fined the maximum $25,000 and banned from the WTA Tour for a year.\n\nAccording to RT.com, Tarpischev appeared Oct. 7 on a show called “Evening Urgant” — the host’s name is Ivan Urgant — with former WTA player Elena Dementieva.\n\nThis was part of the dialogue:\n\n“I was at the Olympics and saw Maria Sharapova play her … him …,\" Urgant said.\n\n“… One of the Williams brothers,” Tarpischev finished.\n\nCan there be little question that his remarks were not only insensitive but also sexist and racist?\n\nSerena Williams certainly thought so, adding, “I thought they were, in a way, bullying.”\n\nSharapova, who has played Fed Cup for Russia throughout her career, said of Tarpischev’s comments, “I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled-for, and I’m glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA. It was very inappropriate, especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport but being part of the Olympic committee. It was just really irresponsible on his side.”\n\nTarpischev said, according to RT.com, “I am sorry that the joke which was translated into English out of its context of a comedy show drew so much attention. I don’t think this situation is worth all the hoopla because those words were said without any malice.”\n\nHe also lamented, the website said, that the situation was “hyped to an absurd level,” adding that Russians do not file complaints when there are jokes elsewhere about “vodka, balalaika and bears.”\n\nFriendship, excellence and respect is a long way away from vodka, balalaika and bears.\n\nTolerance and making the world even just a little bit better — this is what the International Olympic Committee, indeed the entire Olympic movement, piece by piece, day by day, person by person, is (supposed to be) about.\n\nWhether or not Tarpischev intended to hurt anyone is not entirely relevant. In this case, the person whose feelings are at issue is Serena Williams. She is a big person and doesn’t need anyone to defend her in this sort of context but, honestly — four Olympic gold medals, three in doubles with her sister, and then of course the thrilling singles victory at Wimbledon in 2012?\n\nRemember, the athletes are at the center of everything, right?\n\nTarpischev, whether he or Putin like it or not, has to be held to a higher standard. Too often the IOC is criticized for reaching for a utopia of sorts in which sport can not make a difference in showing the world how to get along. This incident offers a teachable moment.\n\nTo begin, the International Tennis Federation has been deadly silent on this issue. That is indefensible. The WTA has taken strong action. So should the ITF.\n\nSo, too, the IOC.\n\nEuropean soccer has been marked by ugly incidents of racism. Here is the perfect example for the IOC to demonstrate that words, even if meant in jest, which these arguably were not, can be just as hurtful as, say, throwing a banana on a soccer pitch.\n\nIn a world in which racism and sexism are regrettably yet virulent, the IOC can, and should, provisionally suspend Tarpischev.\n\nYou want the legal hook? He has brought the IOC into disrepute with his remarks. The IOC ethics commission can take it from there.\n\nYou want common sense? Everyone knows that hurtful words are the trigger for more.\n\nAnd that saying something was just a joke is often just a lame way of covering up.\n\nAgain, extraordinary times call for extraordinary leadership. If the IOC means what it says, then there has to be more than just lip service."
