        "text": "She’s taking one of her other talents to the next level!\n\nTennis legend Venus Williams has ventured into the world of artificial intelligence-based interior design, co-founding the innovative startup Palazzo. Fast Company reports the platform, launching in beta, aims to revolutionize how individuals approach home design by offering a seamless and accessible AI-driven experience. Williams, known not only for her unparalleled tennis career but also for her ventures in design and entrepreneurship, brings her expertise to Palazzo. The co-founders, including tech-forward minds Raffi Holzer and Edward Lando, envision Palazzo as a comprehensive solution for all things home.\n\nThe platform’s unique proposition lies in its ability to transform any room through a simple process. Users upload a photo of their space, engaging in a conversation with an AI chatbot. Subsequently, the system renders a convincing makeover, providing users with a tangible vision for their redesigned room. While Palazzo’s current features may be considered “barebones” in the beta phase, Williams and her co-founders have grand ambitions for the platform. “Our vision is to create a space where everything home is in one place,” expresses Williams, sharing the team’s commitment to making design enjoyable and accessible.\n\nPalazzo not only caters to individual design needs but also introduces a social component to the platform. Users can share their designs, invite feedback from friends, and even open them to the public. This collaborative feature adds a communal touch to the design process, turning Palazzo into a space for shared inspiration and creative exchange.\n\n“We’ve just found this space where a lot doesn’t exist. And we get to have our say on it and make that mark,” she shares, underlining the platform’s commitment to filling a void in the realm of interior design.\n\nAs Palazzo continues to evolve, Venus Williams and her team strive to create a platform that not only transforms individual spaces but also fosters a community passionate about design—a place where every voice has a valuable say.\n\nCover photo: Venus Williams Becomes Co-Founder of Palazzo, an AI-Based Interior Design Company / Credit: Photo by Dave Kotinsky"
