        "text": "With seven Grand Slam titles, four Olympic gold medals and a former world number one in both singles and doubles, Venus Williams is rounding out her impressive resume with a venture into jewelry. The athlete partnered with Reinstein Ross on the Diamond Match collection, which was released on Tuesday.\n\nThe collaboration marks the legendary athlete’s first-ever jewelry collection, featuring an array of luxury 20-karat gold and diamond pieces inspired by her longtime love of pavé.\n\n“The collection was inspired by a ring that I have worn so often in my matches,” Williams told WWD, later adding, “I sweat for a living and I still want to feel fabulous. That’s why I practice wearing these big pavé rings and hoop earrings on the court because it’s an expression of self.”\n\nA closer look at the Diamond Match collection includes the Pavé Dome Doubles Link Small Bracelets ($15,000) in 20-karat peach gold; the Pavé Trio Dome Doubles Link Necklace ($20,000) and the Pavé Link Large Drop ($8,500)(earrings).\n\nAlthough Williams is revered for her skills on the court during tennis matches, the star has always been inspired and equally obsessed with jewelry, she said.\n\n“If I wasn’t buying it [jewelry], I was always looking at everything: every collection, all the brands; it was just something I’ve always loved,” Williams told WWD, elaborating that the process of creating the collection was intimate, “from drawings to inspiration.”\n\n“Working hand in hand was an incredible experience because you wouldn’t have an opportunity with every organization to do that. A lot of it may be out of your control, or feedback may not be heard, but to have this opportunity to sit in that creative seat and work with people who have the same vision has been fantastic,” Williams said.\n\nThe news of the collection launching comes just months after Williams attended the 2023 U.S. Open in August, which marked her 24th appearance at the prestigious championship. This time around, the star athlete showcased more of her maximalist style, including a flower-adorned Willy Chavarria blazer with a ruffled Alaïa skirt.\n\n“I feel like my style is always changing and evolving. Being able to work with different stylists like Solange Franklin Reed with my U.S. Open entrance look, that was so fun,” Williams said about the outfit.\n\nWilliams’ had also styled her hair in a high ponytail, which featured blush pink highlights. “I always wanted to do that and I never did for 20 years, because I didn’t want it to distract from tennis,” Williams said, ultimately taking the risk. “This is what I’ve always wanted to do, I’m going to do it!”\n\nThe Diamond Match collection is currently available on ReinsteinRoss.com and in-store at Reinstein Ross’ new flagship in New York."
