        "text": "Transcript\n\nWho is Serena Williams?\n\nSerena Williams is an American athlete whose powerful play has made her one of the top tennis players in the open era.\n\nFor more than twenty years, she dominated the court, spending 319 weeks ranked number one by the Women’s Tennis Association.\n\nHowever, her success wasn’t always guaranteed. Williams faced many obstacles, including serious knee and foot injuries, that kept her sidelined for months at a time.\n\nBut with each setback came a dramatic return to the top.\n\nAfter missing almost a full year battling various health issues, Williams won the singles gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, becoming the second woman ever to win a career Golden Slam.\n\nSERENA WILLIAMS: I love a challenge, and I love holding up trophies. And so I guess if ever I feel that I can’t do that, then maybe I won’t play anymore.\n\nIn 2017, Williams won her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, the most of any athlete in the open era.\n\nShe gave birth to a daughter later that year and returned to the court six months later, placing second at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon in both 2018 and 2019.\n\nAlong with Williams’ success in singles events came 14 grand slam doubles titles with her sister Venus, the second most for a pair in the open era.\n\nSerena William’s incredible level of success has earned her a place as one of the greatest tennis players in history."
