        "text": "The Williams sisters embraced the metallic trend on Monday’s Met Gala 2024 red carpet in New York City.\n\nSerena arrived first at the event, wearing a custom gown by Balenciaga. Her dress was made of gold-coated silk taffeta and featured a long sash forming a train. She paired the look with black opera gloves that matched her pointy shoes. Serena was accessorized with Messika earrings and ring.\n\nVenus wore an equally shining outfit, opting for a custom Marc Jacobs dress. Her strapless look featured a sheer panel with mirrored paillettes throughout.\n\nThe sisters have been invited to the Met Gala since the early 2000s. Serena debuted on the event’s in 2004, wearing a jewel-toned purple dress. Since then, she has worn Oscar de la Renta and Versace at the event. Meanwhile, Venus’ first Met Gala happened in 2008, when she wore a bronze Carolina Herrera gown. In 2022, she wore a tuxedo by Gabriela Hearst at the event.\n\nThe Met Gala raises funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and celebrates the Costume Institute’s annual exhibits. This year’s theme, “The Garden of Time,” nods to the “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibit, which will open to the public on Friday. The 2024 event is notably cochaired by Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour.\n\nClick the gallery below to see more looks on the Met Gala 2024 red carpet."
