        "text": "These tennis stars are telling the stories of women trailblazers!\n\nVenus and Serena Williams have had many hits on the tennis court and the big screen! The sisters put on their producer hats for the making of King Richard; now, they’ll be putting those hats back on to create a new documentary on the historic Women’s World Cup tournament in 1971.\n\nThis documentary, COPA 71, is centered around the monumental soccer event that involved women from all over the world competing at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Over 100,000 people watched as Denmark took home the trophy against Mexico. No matter how pivotal this moment was for women in sports, the 1971 tournament marked the last tournament since the inception of FIFA in 1991.\n\nIt’s a Dogwoof and New Black Films production directed by James Erskine and Rachel Ramsay. There’s no word when the film will be released; however, Serena shared with Variety that Copa 71 “tells the story of one of the most inspirational and significant moments in women’s sports history.”\n\n“It’s an honor to partner with my sisters and Westbrook Studios to help bring this magical story to light, which has been buried for far too long,” she continued.\n\n“When I heard about the 1971 Women’s World Cup, I couldn’t believe this incredible story was erased from our history books. I’m excited to team with my sisters and Westbrook Studios to help elevate and empower fellow female athletes and their accomplishments, and to make sure these women have their voices heard through this inspiring documentary,” Venus added.\n\nIn 2020, Serena became part-owner of the National Women’s Soccer League Los Angeles Angel City FC team, who played their first game last year. Williams also made Olympia an owner, making her the youngest person to own a professional sports team!\n\nWe know that their hearts will be in it, and we can’t wait to see it!\n\nPhoto: MICHAEL TRAN/AFP VIA GETT/ Kevin Winter/Getty Images"
