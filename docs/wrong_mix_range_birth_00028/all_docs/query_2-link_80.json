        "text": "Venus Williams has exited the US Open after losing her first round match.\n\nThe older Williams sister lost 6–1, 7–6 to Belgian-born Alison Van Uytvanc at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and exists the women’s singles tournament in unceremonious fashion, while her sister, Serena, will continue on to the second round after winning on Monday, after beating Danka Kovinić of Montenegro.\n\nWilliams fell early in the match, as she dropped the first set to Kovinić by a lopsided 6–1 margin. She managed to put up a better fight in the second set, but ultimately lost in a tie-breaker that saw Kovinić win 7 points to Williams’ 5.\n\nKovinić took the match 6–1, 7–6.\n\nThis year marked Venus’ 23rd US Open in 25 years, where she had won twice — in 2000, and then again in 2001. She has won 7 major titles in her career.\n\nTuesday marks the first time that Venus Williams has been bounced from the US Open in the first round.\n\nThis will not be the last time that US Open fans can see Venus, as she will be playing alongside her sister in the women’s doubles tournament, beginning on Thursday.\n\nFor more coverage of Venus Williams and the US Open, head to amNY.com.\n\nTogether, the two Williams sisters have secured 14 Grand Slam doubles titles in their careers."
