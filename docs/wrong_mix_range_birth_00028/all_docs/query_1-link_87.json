        "text": "Venus and Serena Williams are a dominant pair on the tennis court, and now the sisters are teaming up to contribute to their hometown of Compton, California, by opening up a community center to support residents affected by gun violence.\n\nThe Yetunde Price Resource Center, named after their sister, who was murdered by a gang member while riding through Compton with her boyfriend in 2003, will serve as a support system and place where people can get the help they need. The center will also recruit volunteers and play a key role in bettering the community and surrounding areas.\n\nAccording to a homicide tracker posted by the Los Angeles Times, 30 people have been killed in Compton in the past 12 months. The youngest victim was 1 year old. With the start of the center, the Williams sisters hope residents will be able to devise plans to combat the violence and use the resources that are available to them.\n\nThough the Williams sisters have always been philanthropic and have shown individual support for various charities, this is the first venture through their joint organization, the Williams Sister Fund.\n\n“This is an incredible investment and commitment by Serena and Venus Williams, and I commend them for their desire to help children and families in Compton thrive,” said Compton Mayor Aja Brown. “The resource center will serve as vital support to existing nonprofits and organizations that provide critical services to our community.”\n\nThe center is set to open Nov. 12."
