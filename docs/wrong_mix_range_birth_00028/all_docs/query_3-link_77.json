        "text": "SERENA and Venus Williams are the most iconic sisters in tennis history.\n\nHowever, they have several half-siblings on their mother's and father's sides of the family who are less well-known to the public.\n\nWho are Venus and Serena Williams' siblings?\n\nThe tennis stars have three half-sisters on their mother’s side: Yetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price.\n\nYetunde Price died in 2003 at 31 years old after she was mistakenly killed in Compton, California, near a suspected gang house, according to reports.\n\nShe was the oldest of the Price children, a mother of three, a nurse, and a hair salon owner.\n\nAt times, she also worked as a personal assistant for Serena and Venus.\n\nLyndrea Price is a creative costume designer for Venus' clothing brand, Eleven.\n\nIsha Price is an American lawyer and producer. She is one of the producers of 'King Richard,' a film following the father and coach of famed tennis players and daughters.\n\nSerena and Venus also have at least seven half-siblings on their father’s side: Sabrina, Richard III, Ronner, Reluss, and Reneeka with former wife, Betty Johnson, Dylan with recently divorced wife, Lakeisha Juanita Graham, and son Chavoita LeSane.\n\nRichard Williams had Serena and Venus with Oracene Price.\n\nThey divorced in 2002 after allegations of domestic abuse, which Richard denied.\n\nRichard walked out on daughter Sabrina and her four siblings when she was only eight years old.\n\nRichard, who has been married three times in his life, married Sabrina's late mom, Betty Johnson, in the early 1960s.\n\nSabrina Williams, half-sister of Serena and Venus has slammed the biopic King Richard saying he was \"only a king in his head,\" she told the U.S. Sun in an exclusive 2022 interview.\n\n\"Truth be told, those girls rose to the top while his other children had to suffer because of the choices my dad made, we were raised in poverty after he left,\" Sabrina added.\n\nWho are Venus and Serena Williams?\n\nSerena is often regarded as the best female player in the history of tennis, but Venus, too, has cemented herself as a legendary tennis champion.\n\nThe sister-duo has made quite a name for themselves.\n\nVenus has earned 49 singles titles, seven Grand Slam titles, and four gold medals. She also is reported to be worth around $95 million.\n\nSerena's net worth, on the other hand, is estimated to be around $260 million, as of July 2024, according to Forbes.\n\nShe is one of the world's richest tennis players and launched her own clothing line, S by Serena, in 2018.\n\nSerena has won the second most Grand Slam titles of all time, with 23 Grand Slam tournament victories.\n\nHowever, on August 9, 2022, Serena announced her plans to retire after the upcoming US Open in a first-person piece in Vogue.\n\n\"I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give,\" she told the outlet.\n\n\"I have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people.\n\n\"Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.\"\n\nSerena officially called an end to her tennis career in August 2022 after a stunning 27-year stint on the court.\n\nSerena is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The couple married in 2017 and share two daughters, Olympia and Adira.\n\nWhen did Serena and Venus play their last doubles match?\n\nOn Thursday, September 1, 2022, Serena and Venus starred as a doubles duo at Arthur Ashe Stadium—the first time a first-round doubles match was held at the Queens location.\n\nThe sisters faced Czech duo Lucie Hradecka and Linda Noskova but fell short of winning.\n\nThe match was their first US Open appearance as a doubles team since 2014.\n\nSerena and Venus have won a total of 14 doubles titles together."
