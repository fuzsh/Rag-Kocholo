        "text": "Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is a retired American professional tennis player. She is listed among the greatest tennis players of all time. She won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time.\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, to Oracene Price and Richard Williams. She has three half-sisters and one full older sister, Venus. She also has at least seven half-siblings on her father's side.\n\nWhen the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California. Serena began playing tennis when she was four and was coached by her parents.\n\nWhen Serena was nine, her family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida, so she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home.\n\nCareer\n\nSerena turned professional in 1995 and won her first major singles title at the 1999 U.S. Open. Since then, she has won many more tournaments and four Olympic gold medals. Three of her gold medals are in women's doubles—an all-time joint record shared with her sister Venus.\n\nSerena holds the most combined major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles among active players, with 39: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles (all with her sister, Venus), and two in mixed doubles. She became the first tennis player to earn a career Golden Slam (winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and a gold medal) in both singles and doubles.\n\nOn September 1, 2017, Williams gave birth to a daughter named Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr. She is commonly called \"Olympia.\"\n\nOn December 30, 2017, Williams played her first match since giving birth. She has not won as many games since returning to tennis after her daughter was born. She began doing better in 2018.\n\nSerena improved in 2019, and in 2020, she won her first first singles title as a mother. 2021 brought more injuries and more withdrawals from tournaments.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn August 2022, Williams wrote an article for Vogue, in which she announced her plans to 'evolve away' from tennis after the U.S. Open. She said her reasons were her growing family and her other ways of making money. After her announcement, many fellow players including Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if it weren’t for her.\n\nEarnings\n\nSerena is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time. She was the world's highest-paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million, and again in 2017, earning $27 million. In 2021, she was ranked 28th on Forbes' World's Highest-Paid Athletes list.\n\nPlaying style\n\nSerena's serve is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. It is known for its speed and accuracy. Her ball toss allows her to serve to any position on the court without giving a clue with the toss of the ball before the serve.\n\nWilliams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.\n\nEven though Williams plays aggressively, she is also an excellent defender who can move quickly across the court. She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit on the court.\n\nLegacy\n\nWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. Along with her sister Venus, Williams has been said to help increase diversity within the sport of tennis.\n\nFor their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Crystal Dunn chose the name of Serena Williams.\n\nIn December 2019, The Associated Press named Williams Female Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.\n\nIn September 2022, Twitter said that Williams was the most tweeted-about female athlete ever.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWilliams is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. He proposed to her on December 10, 2016, in Rome. On December 30, 2016, Williams announced their engagement in a Reddit post. They married on November 16, 2017, in New Orleans.\n\nIn September 2017, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr, who is often referred to as \"Olympia.\" She posts many pictures of her and her daughter on the tennis court with rackets. Serena announced that she is pregnant for the second time in May 2023.\n\nWilliams was raised a Jehovah's Witness, but states she has \"never really practiced it.\"\n\nOff-court activities\n\nEquipment and endorsements\n\nSerena has had endorsement deals (a deal in which a company pays an athlete to wear their product or use their business) with many companies. They include: Puma, Nike, Wilson, Gatorade, Delta Air Lines, Audemars Piguet, Aston Martin, Pepsi, Beats by Dre headphones, Mission Athletecare, Berlei bras, OPI Products, OnePiece, IBM, Mini, Intel, Tempur, Aston Martin, and Chase Bank.\n\nFashion\n\nWilliams has been noted for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. She had special clothing lines with Puma and Nike. Since 2004, she has run her own line of designer apparel called \"Aneres\" - her first name spelled backward. In 2009, she began selling a collection of handbags and jewelry called Signature Statement. In February 2019, Serena Williams was appointed to the board of directors of the online fashion marketplace Poshmark. In the fall of 2019, Williams launched the first collection of her sustainable clothing line, \"S by Serena.\"\n\nActivism\n\nWilliams has become more involved in social change, using social media to share her opinions.

They live near each other in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is about an hour's drive from the Dolphins' stadium. They are the first black women to hold any amount of ownership in an NFL franchise.\n\nCharity work\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Serena and her sister, Venus, visited hospitals and played several tennis matches to raise money for the local Ronald McDonald House charities. They chose cities in which most of the citizens are black people. Williams has also been involved in clinics at schools and community centers, particularly those that have programs focusing on at-risk youth. She is a supporter and contributor of First Serve Miami, a foundation for youth who want to learn tennis but cannot afford formal lessons.\n\nSerena began the Serena Williams Foundation that built schools in Matooni, Kenya and Trelawny Parish, Jamaica. It also provides college scholarships for underprivileged students in the United States.\n\nIn 2016, in their childhood home of Compton, California, Serena and Venus teamed up to found the Yetunde Price Resource Center, in honor of their late sister.\n\nWriting\n\nThe Williams sisters, with author Hilary Beard, wrote a book titled Venus & Serena: Serving From The Hip: 10 Rules For Living, Loving and Winning, which was published in 2005. Williams released her first solo autobiography, entitled On the Line, after the 2009 U.S. Open.\n\nSoccer\n\nOn July 21, 2020, Williams was announced as part of a nearly all-women investors' group that was awarded a new franchise in the National Women's Soccer League. Serena's husband Alexis is the only male in the ownership group. The team, Angel City Football Club, began playing in 2022.\n\nSerena Williams quotes\n\n\"Everyone's dream can come true if you just stick to it and work hard.\"\n\n\"I love who I am, and I encourage other people to love and embrace who they are.\"\n\n\"I’ve thought it would be cool to have a baby young. There’s always something you have to give up for success. Everything comes at a cost. Just what are you willing to pay for it?\"\n\n\"I’ve grown most not from victories, but setbacks.\"\n\nInteresting facts about Serena Williams\n\nSerena Williams won the U.S. Open at the age of 17.\n\nShe studied fashion at The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale from 2000-2003.\n\nSerena Williams holds the most combined major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nShe also won four Olympic gold medals: 3 in doubles tennis with her sister Venus and one in singles tennis.\n\nSerena Williams was the highest-paid female athlete in the world in the years 2016 and 2017.\n\nSerena has played 60 Grand Slam Tournaments in her entire career.\n\nShe is the oldest female tennis player to reach the No.1 ranking.
