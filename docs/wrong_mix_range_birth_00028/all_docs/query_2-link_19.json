        "text": "Young tennis prodigies were no strangers to the covers of Sports Illustrated and other popular magazines in the early '90s. But the spotlight was cast even brighter on Venus and Serena, due largely to their humble beginnings in California's rough and tumble Compton neighborhood. Here the two pose with Jennifer Capriati.\n\nAll five of the Williams sisters were exposed to tennis at an early age, but Venus and Serena seemed to display the most interest and strongest prospects. Here the sisters stand with President Ronald Regan and his wife, Nancy.\n\nCiting the intense pressure of the youth tennis circuit system, Venus' father pulled her out of junior competitions. Some criticized the move, wondering how Venus would grow without playing against other skilled athletes.\n\nDespite his desire to see Venus succeed in tennis, Richard Williams told Sports Illustrated in 1991 that he still wanted his daughter to have a real childhood. \"Venus is still young. We want her to be a little girl while she is a little girl. I'm not going to let Venus pass up her childhood. Long after tennis is over, I want her to know who she is.\"\n\nVenus was the first of the Williams sisters to make her mark on the tennis world. Armed with a staggering serve that topped 100 mph, Williams turned pro at 14 and went on to defeat 25-year-old and 59th ranked Shaun Stafford in her first pro contest, the Bank of the West Classic in 1994.\n\nAt the tender age of 15, Venus signed a five-year, $12 million endorsement deal with Reebok. In 2000 she signed another deal with the sneaker giant, this time raking in $40 million. The deal was one of the most lucrative endorsements for a female athlete in history.\n\nVenus quickly achieved another milestone in 1997, as she became the first unseeded women's tennis player to reach the finals of the U.S. Open in nearly 40 years. Unfortunately, Venus would ultimately lose the championship to Martina Hingis. It would be another three years before she would snag her first Grand Slam title.\n\nWith more than two dozen Grand Slam titles between them, millions in endorsement deals and legions of fans, Venus and Serena Williams are one of sports' most dynamic duos.\n\nVenus and Serena became the first sisters to win professional titles in the same week in 1999. The duo scored victories in Oklahoma City and Rome on the same day in February of that year.\n\nThe turn of the century proved to be for Venus and Serena as the two beat out Lisa Raymond of the United States and Samantha Stosur of Australia 6-2, 6-2 for the Grand Slam title in women's doubles. The win came after Venus had beaten out her younger sister in the singles final.\n\nDespite their undeniable skills and stockpile of titles, the Williams sisters have been accused of slacking off when pitted against each other in competition. Venus and Serena have vehemently denied those claims.\n\nVenus Williams received an Honorary Degree of Citation of Achievements from Howard University. She was so moved by the gesture that she reportedly began to cry during her speech in front of the 2002 graduating class.\n\nPictured with Laura Harring and David Coulthard, Serena helped present the 2003 Comeback of the Year Award to soccer phenom Ronaldo. Serena would receive the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year award several years later.\n\nVenus and Serena have both been ranked as the sport's top player by the Women's Tennis Association. Venus claimed the honor in 2002, only to be ousted by Serena that same year. It marked the first time sisters had been ranked in the top 2 at the same time.\n\nIn 2002, Venus took her talents off the court to start her own interior design company, V Starr Interiors, based in Jupiter, Fla. Williams has said that once her tennis career ends she would like to focus on her design business.\n\nSeen here playing with her two dogs, Bambi and Jackie, Serena struggled through 2005 as a variety of injuries caused her to have her first non-Top 10 finish since 1998.\n\nThe Williams sisters haven't limited their focus to just tennis. In 2009, the pair purchased a stake in the Miami Dolphins, becoming the first female African-Americans to own a stake in an NFL franchise. Here Serena poses with reality stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and rapper Common.\n\nThough the sisters may have missed out on individual gold medals, they scored their second consecutive gold medal in the women's doubles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, beating out the Spanish pair of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-2, 6-0.\n\nBoth Venus and Serena have said their mother, Oracene Price, has played a huge role in shaping them. \"It’s almost like they were raised on the court,\" Price has said of her two daughters with Richard Williams.\n\nVenus and Serena hold up their trophies after the finals of the Lipton Tennis Championships. Venus defeated her sister in the finals, 6–1, 4–6, 6–4. It was her third title of the year and 10th of her career.\n\nVenus and Serena, pictured here with Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles, helped lead the U.S. in its 4-1 Federation Cup victory against Russia in 1999.\n\nSerena and Venus Williams pose for a photo before their quarterfinal match at the U.S. Open on Sept. 8, 2015."
