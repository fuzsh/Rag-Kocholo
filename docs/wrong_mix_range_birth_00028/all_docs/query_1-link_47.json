        "text": "Venus Williams and Serena Williams were born in Compton, California. But the duo and their family moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, to pursue their tennis career. In fact, they aren’t the only American players who moved to Florida to attempt to thrive at tennis. Several players, including Andy Roddick and Coco Gauff, moved to Florida in order to make their name in the sport. Venus explained why it happens in a Q&A on her Instagram page.\n\nThe Williams sisters were first taught tennis by their father, Richard Williams. Eventually, Richard contacted Rick Macci to come to California to give his daughters a chance. Macci gave it a shot and discovered new talents which ultimately led the Williams family to move to Florida.\n\nVenus Williams clarifies the popular Florida move\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nVenus Williams and her sister Serena were learning tennis and thriving in Florida, but they ended up moving to West Palm Beach in the Sunshine State. The two are not alone in this regard; several American tennis players have moved to Florida in their younger years in order to thrive in the racket sport.\n\nWhen asked why most of the tennis players ended up moving there, the elder Williams sister stated that most tennis academies are there. Therefore moving is eventual. The seven-time grand slam champion said, “All the tennis academies were there in the 80s and 90s and even now. Tradition I guess?“\n\nCoco Gauff, Andy Roddick, Reilly Opelka, and more have done the same. As per the US Tennis Association, over 1.5 million tennis players live in the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRead More – ‘Got Them a $92,000 Motor Home’- Venus and Serena Williams’ Childhood Coach Rick Macci Reveals Lavish Money Spent Based on ‘King’ Richard’s Confidence\n\nWilliams dubs it a tradition as she and her younger sister also moved to the state with their family later. For the most part of their childhood, Richard Williams and his ex-wife, Oracene Price, were the coaches of the two stars. When Macci eventually saw them play, he knew he had found the next big tennis players. He invited them over to his academy and spared no expense to make sure the girls became some of the best players in the history of the sport.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe move worked perfectly, as they will now be remembered as some of the best in WTA history."
