Venus, the elder of the two sisters, was born in June 1980, with Serena following in September of the same year. Their upbringing occurred in a challenging environment, where success was far from guaranteed. The sisters, the youngest of five children with their other siblings stemming from separate marriages, were introduced to tennis by their father, Richard Williams. Remarkably, Richard Williams had committed to training his daughters to become the world's finest tennis players even before they were born. Despite his lack of tennis experience, he crafted homemade rackets to initiate their training. Tennis swiftly evolved into an all-encompassing passion, with Richard orchestrating a strict training regimen that consumed their lives. Although some might argue that the dominant trait of their father might have been excessive, others saw it as a means to secure a better future for the girls given their challenging circumstances.

As the girls' talents began to take shape in their childhood, Richard Williams orchestrated a move to Florida, where they received professional training from a well-known coach. The girls continued their education at home while focusing intensively on tennis. This period saw Venus turn professional in 1994, with Serena following suit in 1995. Their entry into the world of professional tennis generated significant attention, both positive and negative. They faced adversity, particularly due to their age and gender, in a predominantly male-dominated sport, compounded by racial discrimination during their early years.
