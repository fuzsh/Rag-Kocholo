THE DEFINITION OF "VINTAGE" IS DESCRIBED AS ANYTHING BETWEEN 20 AND 100 YEARS OLD THAT REPRESENTS THE ERA FROM WHERE IT'S FROM. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO KELLEY SMITH, THE FOUNDER OF HIS VINTAGE BRAND KILROY VTG.

WORDS BY RICK SCOTCH

Kilroy VTG sells dope vintage rings, a variety of military items from the Korean and Vietnam wars, vintage t-shirts, cool novelty items like thought-provoking postcards that date as far back to the early 1900s, old posters, original photographs and a variety of other pieces that are charmed with pinup dolls. Kelley recently introduced his very own modern goods line, a production of American made T-shirts and his very own designed vintage-inspired rings.

Before he even started Kilroy VTG, Kelley had been collecting vintage items for years and always had an interest in the story behind each of the pieces he came across. In this short doc, Kelley talks about his childhood connection with his grandpa and how he was always amazed in his grandpa's old military items.

I really enjoy making people happy for having something cool that they wouldn't find normally and that's a cool feeling.

Kilroy VTG is a true lifestyle business. One of many things that I love about Kelley is he’s built his business based on his lifestyle, curating vintage products that he loves and shares in his sense of style. I believe entrepreneurs and creatives sometimes get distracted with building businesses solely focused on the opportunity versus creating something that they are genuinely passionate about. It's like they say about doing something you love and are excited about..."You'll work harder like you never have before, but yet you'll never work a day in your life; it's all about loving what you do."

If you're looking for some dope original vintage products with cool vibes, Kilroy VTG is your vintage store to check out.

Enjoy this short doc about Kelley Smith and his business Kilroy VTG.

Life can take you down a path that we don't necessarily know why we went down but ended up somewhere that we didn't want to be. It takes self-realization and the courage to stop and walk away to do what you want to do. Well, let me introduce you to one man that has done this, Drew Hash.
