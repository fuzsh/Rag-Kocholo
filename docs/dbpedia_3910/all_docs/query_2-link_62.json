        "text": "At 85, Rancho Bernardo resident Jack Bloom does not look thetype who fearlessly scours inner-city streets, hangs out with gangmembers below interstate bridges or jumps fences to get a glimpseof a city’s seedier side.\n\nReaching for one of his many black photo albums, the retiredinsurance agent reveals the inspiration for his escapades. Whereother amateur photographers his age might have stored proudpictures of grandchildren or black-and-white memories of decadespast, Bloom has page after page of colorful graffiti.\n\n“I think these are the pulse of a city,” Bloom said, looking athis collection.\n\nGraffiti can be a blight to a neighborhood, an assault ofvulgarity and a glorification of gang turf wars. But it is alwayshonest, sometimes inspirational and often, in its own way,beautiful, Bloom has found.\n\nSome of the estimated 2,000 colorful photos in his collectionhave whimsical images. Others are disturbing. Some are murals withpositive messages. Some have cryptic, serpentine lettering andcoded messages Bloom that does not understand.\n\n“Graffiti is something that’s mostly disliked in society,” Bloomadmitted, citing its gang connection and the omnipresent work ofcompetitive “taggers” who leave their initials or monikers on anysurface they can mark with spray paint or ink.\n\n‘The history of our time’\n\nBut graffiti just as often can be a social statement, and Bloomsees the work as historically significant. Photographing thetransient work is a way to capture a moment of history before it ispainted over, fades away or disappears in the rubble of urbanrenewal.\n\n“I felt that I was recording the history of our time,” Bloomsaid of his passion.\n\nHe is far from alone in his appreciation of graffiti. TheBrooklyn Museum and two galleries in New York last summer featuredthe works of several graffiti artists; several Web sites chronicleits history and heroes; and urban anthropologists see the paintingsas a study of contemporary society.\n\nAfter two decades of photographing graffiti in severalcountries, Bloom suspects he may have one of the more interestingand comprehensive collections ever assembled. He keeps his photosand negatives in an orderly collection, but Bloom isn’t sure whatwill ultimately become of them.\n\n“Everyone’s been after me to publish them,” he said.\n\nBloom’s friend Mike Opper, also of Rancho Bernardo, is an arthistorian who has taught at Columbia University and Fresno StateUniversity, and he believes the collection is worth displaying.\n\n“Some archivist should get it,” Opper said. “It could go forfuture studies. There will be people doing a lot of research inthis area for another 50 years, and he’ll have thedocumentation.”\n\nOpper said he has seen tremendous talent in graffiti.\n\n“There’s a lot of history involved with graffiti artists,” hesaid. “And it started right at the roots, where the people are.It’s a people-form of expression.”\n\nJonathan Marion, an anthropology professor at Cal StateUniversity San Marcos, also sees social relevance in graffiti.\n\n“Like any type of expressive behavior, it always comes fromwithin a societal cultural context, and is always responsive todifferent issues and culturally salient values of the place andtime,” he said.\n\n“It’s a visual expression that comes from within a socialcontent,” he said. “Graffiti, like any other visual art, is of nouse if it doesn’t communicate anything.”\n\nGraffiti is historical\n\nThe modern era of graffiti is believed to have begun inPhiladelphia in the early 1960s, although the practice of scrawlingimages on walls is as old as mankind. Bloom, a native New Yorkerwho landed in the Normandy invasion in World War II, remembersseeing the iconic “Kilroy was here” graffiti throughout Europe inthe 1940s.\n\nAfter the war, Bloom bought a camera to take pictures of hisnewborn son. He later turned his camera on nature, and then to thecity, capturing images of aging New York buildings destined to berazed.\n\nOne day on his walks around the city, Bloom’s attention wasdrawn to a defiant spray-painted message, sliced like so manypieces of bread from the shadows cast by an overhead grating.\n\n“It said, ‘Kill hippies,'” Bloom said about the message paintednext to a crudely drawn skull and bones. “They were in favor of theVietnam War. I thought, ‘My, that’s exciting.'”\n\nFrom then on, Bloom focused on graffiti as his main photosubject. Graffiti exploded in New York during the 1970s and 1980s,and Bloom walked the neighborhoods and boroughs in search of itsexpression.\n\nHe still has the “Kill hippies” photo, but in a heartbreakingloss, all his other photos were lost when he retired and moved toRancho Bernardo 18 years ago. Bloom estimates he lost about 2,000pictures.\n\nA universal language\n\nUndeterred and with more free time, Bloom started his collectionanew during his retirement years, expanding it to include graffitiphotos from Lisbon, Portugal; Barcelona, Spain; Israel, Poland andother countries.\n\nHe found graffiti was a universal language, and often thegraffiti of one country could not be distinguished fromanother.\n\n“There is a slight difference,” he said. “In Europe, it was moredefined, more leaning toward the mural aspect of it, and theydidn’t do as much ‘tagging,'” he said.\n\nIn Argentina, he photographed graffiti in the mountain regionsthat had bold colors in distinctive blocks. In Israel, he foundwhimsical and minimalist black and white cartoon drawings, and inLisbon, colorful monstrous creations.\n\nAdventures in art\n\nBloom has collected his photos almost without incident. Once,oblivious to traffic while standing in a street to photograph awall, he was yelled at by his wife, Esther, as honking cars wereapproaching. He gave his wife and traveling companions anotherscare in a foreign country when he stood on railroad tracks to takea picture as a train was approaching.\n\nBloom has met young local graffitists who have taken him to viewsome of their favorite work. One excursion led him to a bridgebelow Interstate 15 near Hidden Meadows, where Bloom said he founda “mother lode” of artwork.\n\nA mugger once grabbed the camera from around his neck inBarcelona, but besides that one incident, Bloom has never beentouched by anyone. Two men followed him in Harlem once, but Bloomturned around to tell them he had nothing they wanted.\n\n“I came home from World War II in the infantry and figured I wasahead of the game,” he said. “I’m not afraid of anything.”\n\nOnce when photographing graffiti in the Logan Heightsneighborhood of San Diego, Bloom brought Esther, but left herlocked in the car for safety.\n\nIn the Spanish Harlem neighborhood of New York, Bloom once wasadmiring a portrait painted on a wall when some gang membersapproached him. Bloom explained that he only wanted to take a photoof the portrait, whom he learned was a fallen member of the men’sgang.\n\nAfter telling them he was frustrated because he couldn’t get aclear shot with the portrait because a car was blocking his way,the gang members quickly accommodated him. They broke into the car,hot-wired it, and drove it out of the shot."
