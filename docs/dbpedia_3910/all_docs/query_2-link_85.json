        "text": "Museum Collections in the National Park Service\n\nRosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historical Park's museum and archives collections are a tangible link through which visitors and researchers may understand the diverse stories of the US WWII Home Front. The collection is one of the most diverse varieties of WWII home front items in the country and includes: written narratives, oral histories, defense industry equipment, artifacts and ephemera, photographs, and personal belongings from the WWII home front.\n\nCollections at Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front NHP\n\nThe collection at Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historical Park consists primarily of stories and memorabilia donated by individuals who experienced the WWII home front era firsthand. This collection represents a highly personal, unique narrative of everyday life on the home front. Donations have come from cities across the nation and represent a diverse array of experiences from men, women, and children of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. As of January 2016, the collection numbers over 5,000 historic artifacts and over 15,000 archival documents and continues to grow.\n\nExplore some of the collections\n\nWhat Can I Find in the Museum and Archives Collection?\n\nIncluded in the museum and archives collection are:\n\nFirst-person written memories\n\nPhotographs from individuals and companies\n\nWork-related documents such as training certificates, identification cards, and paystubs\n\nPrinted matter such as ration coupons, handbills, flyers, and magazines\n\nArtifacts including period clothing, industrial work equipment such as riveting guns and welding gear\n\nOriginal artwork, jewelry, production awards, badges, and other personal or household items\n\nImages from the museum collection are available on Facebook, Google Arts and Culture, and the NPS Web Catalog Exhibit.\n\nHow Do I Find Out About Donating My Story or Memorabilia to the Collection?\n\nEmail the Cultural Resources Staff\n\nThe park collects stories and memorabilia related to many different aspects of life on the WWII home front. Common topics include:\n\nIndustrial workers (both men and women)\n\nChildren and day care centers\n\nVictory gardens\n\nRationing\n\nCivilian defense\n\nVolunteer programs such as the Red Cross and the USO\n\nThe park focuses on how the war affected and changed daily life for civilians. Please note that the park does not collect objects or archival materials of a strictly military nature, although it may collect items documenting the interaction between military and civilians on the home front.\n\nHow to Donate Your Story or Memorabilia to the Collection\n\nAll objects are reviewed before full acceptance into the museum and archives collection. For more information on donating your memorabilia and writing memories for the collection, visit our Stories page or email the museum collection staff with information regarding your possible donation.\n\nHow to Complete Research of the Collection\n\nSome of the museum collections and archives can be viewed on Facebook and the NPS Web Catalog Exhibit. The museum and archives can be accessed in person by appointment only. Researchers are encouraged to complete preliminary research at other archives, libraries, and museum collections with a broad topical focus before approaching the holdings of Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historical Park. Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front NHP has limited reference staff and resources that must be made available to researchers whose work focuses on materials available only at this park. Access to materials is dependent upon their physical condition and the level of processing by park staff. If you would like to inquire about researching the collection or set up a research appointment, please email the museum collection staff.\n\nImportance of Museum and Archives Collections in the National Park Service\n\nMuseum and archives collections play a vital role in the mission of the National Park Service. Nearly every unit of the National Park Service has some form of museum and archives collection, which may include historic objects, natural history specimens, archaeology, and archives. These collections offer tangible evidence of who we were and who we are as a society and are available to the public through exhibitions, web exhibits, and research."
