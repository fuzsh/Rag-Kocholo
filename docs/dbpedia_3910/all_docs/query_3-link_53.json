        "text": "This website is offered to you by KILROY. Below you can read our Privacy Policy.\n\nFirst and foremost, we want you to know that your privacy concerns us, and we take seriously the responsibility you directly or indirectly have entrusted us.\n\nThis policy explains how the KILROY Group collects customer data, use the data and in which situations and to whom the data is disclosed.\n\nKILROY is part of a European group of companies that operate within travel, educational counselling and student benefits as subsidiaries of KILROY International A/S. Collection and processing of personal data is an unavoidable and necessary part of conducting this kind of business and to fulfil the purposes described in this privacy policy. KILROY is data-responsible for the processing of personal data for these purposes.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or to our handling of your personal data, our address is:\n\nKILROY Travel UK Ltd.\n\n1 Chapel Street, Warwick, United Kingdom, CV34 4HL\n\nThe head office address of the KILROY Group, is:\n\nKILROY International A/S\n\nNytorv 5,\n\nDK-1450 Copenhagen K\n\nDenmark\n\nMore information about the processing of customer data at KILROY can also be obtained by writing to [email protected]\n\nProtection and safety is important to us\n\nResponsible handling of personal data collected as part of the operation of our business, is crucial to our business objectives and reputation. In this privacy policy we will account for how your personal data is collected and used when you are a customer, supplier, or business partner and how you can gain access to you own personal data.\n\nWhat is personal data?\n\nPersonal data is any kind of data about an identified or identifiable living individual. An identifiable individual is understood as a person, who directly or indirectly can be identified, among other things, by an identification number or one or more elements, that are particular to a given person’s identity.\n\nWhat type of personal data are we processing and why?\n\nYour personal data will be used for different purposes in relation to your position as customer and the operation of KILROY. The data collected may vary, depending on whether you are a customer, supplier or business partner, but in general it will be data regarding customer administration, supplier administration, direct marketing and data regarding KILROY’s rights and obligations.\n\nFailure to provide personal data on your part may mean that KILROY is unable to fulfil its obligations towards you as customer or supplier.\n\nAs a rule, KILROY only collects and processes regular personal data. In specific cases of booking a trip, it can be necessary for us, to a limited extent, to process sensitive personal data (e.g. information regarding special meals or special needs assistance during your trip), as well as information regarding social security numbers (e.g. in connection with collecting passport copy for visa applications), but only when it is necessary for booking the trip and assistance you require.\n\nKILROY will typically gather the following information:\n\n3.1 Information concerning our customers\n\nThe information provided to us when booking a trip or creating a customer profile with us, e.g. online via the webpage or by contacting our customer service / travel consultants, including contact details (first name, middle name(s), surname, address, telephone number, email address, title and job position), social security number (for visa applications etc.), passport number, bank details, debit and credit card details, information you provide regarding special preferences during your trip (e.g. information on dietary restrictions, special needs assistance due to disability or illness, etc.), health information (when booking trips for health or medical treatments, sports trips, etc.), information regarding your height, weight, clothing and shoe size (for booking equipment on ski trips, sports trips, etc.), purpose of travel, information regarding which languages you speak, citizenship, contact information of your next of kin, requisition (in the case of business or health trips), information regarding your marketing and communication preferences, along with information you have given us if you contact us with questions, to report a problem or when you contact us with reference to your customer relationship, information regarding student, teacher, youth card issuance photo, place of study (applies only for ISIC), place of work (applies only for ITIC), promotional code, card validity, date of issue, card number, information regarding fees payment (price, type of payment, date, payment confirmation).\n\nThe personal data processed in relation to management of event or contests is: the information about the event (title, content, date, time, place, price of the ticket); information regarding participant of the event (first name, last name, email address, phone number (optional), IP address (in case of webinars)); questions asked during the event or webinar as well as the communication via email/phone regarding the event (optional); payment handling information (first name, last name, price/fee, date of payment, method of payment).\n\n3.2 Information concerning our suppliers and business partners\n\nInformation you provide when entering a contract or agreement with us, including contact information (job, job title, first name, middle name(s), surnames, addresses, telephone number, email address), information regarding your marketing and communication preferences, as well as information you have given us if you contact us with questions, to report a problem or when you contact us with reference to your customer relationship.\n\n3.3 Information concerning collection of applications for universities and organisations\n\nWhen you decide to apply for an internship, studies, or academic courses via KILROY, we act on behalf of the institution providing an internship, studies or academic courses. Thus, KILROY processes the personal data for the purposes stated by the institution – collection of applications. Thus, an institution (university, organisation, other institution) processes data as a controller and KILROY processes personal data as a processor on behalf of the institution. For detailed information about your data processing, please read the data privacy policy of the institution you apply to.\n\nWhat do we use your personal data for?\n\nKILROY processes your personal data to fulfill the purposes stated below. Notice that not all purposes, categories of information, recipients of information and types of procedures are applicable to you in all cases.\n\nKILROY exclusively processes your personal data to the extent necessary for you as customer, supplier or business partner (as specific interests in each case, are taken into account) or in accordance with existing law.\n\n4.1 Customer administration\n\nKILROY processes your personal data when establishing and administering your customer relationship with KILROY, as a part of the operation of our company, including booking trips and delivery of our different products (e.g. management of contests and events, visa application, travel insurance, transfer service, student, teacher, youth card issuance, etc.), maintenance of our customer registers, billing, marketing, statistics, etc.\n\nAll statistics and analysis are compiled in anonymised form and therefore do not contain information that can lead directly back to you as a person.\n\n4.2 Administration of supplier and business partner relationships\n\nKILROY processes your information when co-administrating supplier and business partner relations, where you are the supplier or business partner, or contact person with a supplier or business partner, which KILROY is working with as a part of the operation of our company, including maintenance of our CRM-registry with information about our contact with each supplier and business partner.\n\n4.3 Compliance with current laws and regulations\n\nKILROY processes your personal data in compliance with the laws and regulations that KILROY is subject to with respect to the operation of the business or for filing different liability and disclosure requirements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. KILROY does not use your personal data to make decisions that are solely based on automatic processing, except for profiling. Profiling is a form of automated processing of your personal data. We use profiling and data modelling to be able to offer you specific services and products that meet your preferences for marketing purposes.\n\nKILROY strives to guarantee that all personal data we process is correct and up-to-date. We therefore always ask you to inform us regarding possible changes in your personal details (e.g. change of address, name, phone number or payment) so that we can guarantee that your personal data is always correct and up-to-date. You should update your personal data immediately in case of changes.\n\nHow long do we keep your personal information?\n\nKILROY will retain information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with the Services or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).\n\nThe data processing retention period for establishing and administering customer relationship with KILROY is 36 months after the provision of the services or expiration of the product you have purchased (e.g. visa expiration, travel insurance expiration, transfer service has been provided, student, teacher, youth card expiration, date of arrival, date of an event or a contest, etc.) whichever comes last. When you decline a proposal that you have asked for, the personal data is stored for 12 months after the proposal expires.\n\nWe use your personal data for direct marketing purposes for 40 months after you have subscribed for newsletters or after receiving your consent. Your personal data is also used for direct marketing purposes for 24 months after you have bought products or services at KILROY. Your data shall be deleted after we have received and executed your request to delete your personal data or you have unsubscribed from newsletters.\n\nThe personal data for the purposes of administration of supplier and business partner relationships is stored for 3 years after the expiration of business relations.\n\nKILROY processes personal data accordingly to the retention periods provided by the laws and regulations. The data retention periods are never prolonged unless it is based under specific law and regulation.\n\nLegal base for processing your personal data\n\nKILROY essentially processes your information on the following grounds: (1) Your consent (ex. Direct marketing), (2) Entering into and fulfilling contractual agreements with KILROY (ex. Customer administration, Administration of supplier and business partner relationships, management of events and contests), (3) Consideration for the legitimate interests of KILROY, as described above (ex. Fraud prevention, Direct marketing), (4) Fulfilment of legal duties that KILROY is required to meet (ex. Billing, Anti-money laundering prevention), (5) Protection of your or another physical individual’s vital interests (ex. Customer administration), (6) The processing is necessary, in order for a legal claim to be established, enforced or defended (Ex. Customer administration), and (7) The processing is necessary to comply with KILROY’s or your employment, health and social rights, that arise from national law or EU law.\n\nIn addition, there may be situations where we treat your personal data for the sake of KILROY’s or third parties' legitimate interests with regard to the purposes described above, unless consideration for your interests is deemed more important (ex. Direct marketing, Customer administration).\n\nSharing of Personal Data\n\nKILROY only discloses data to the extent necessary for the operation of our business, including to provide your trip and the other products you have purchased with us in connection therewith.\n\nKILROY will typically pass personal data to the following recipients when booking a trip and related products:\n\n7.1 Global Distribution System (GDS)\n\nA GDS is an IT network system owned or operated by a company that allows transactions between the travel industry's service providers - mainly airlines, hotels, car rental companies and travel agents.

A qualified offer is a type of offer, in which a preliminary reservation of the desired trip is made for you when preparing the offer. This allows you to reserve space on the desired departures for up to three days before deciding whether a ticket should be issued for the preliminary reservation or it should be annulled.\n\nIn order to create a qualified offer, we provide information about you and the requested reservation to a GDS (as mentioned above), which makes the preliminary reservation at the airline, the hotel, etc.\n\nAs a part of obtaining a qualified offer, personal data is passed on to several new independent data controllers (GDS, airlines, hotels, etc.). Your information may be retained by these recipients after the expiry of the offer, also in case the offer is annulled.\n\nFurthermore, KILROY may disclose your personal data to other suppliers and service providers as a part of normal operation of the company, e.g., in connection with external administration of our IT systems, analysis reports, marketing, debt collection, credit rating, audit, legal assistance, etc.\n\nFor further information regarding our suppliers’ and partners' processing and protection of your personal data, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.\n\nKILROY strives to limit the disclosure of personal data in personally identifiable format to the maximum extent possible, thereby limiting the cases where information can lead back to you personally.\n\nKILROY does not disclose your personal data unless it is necessary to perform our business or meet your needs.\n\nInternational transfers of your personal data\n\nDue to the nature of KILROY’s business, your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the EU / EEA when booking a trip with us. In order to be able to deliver our services to you, we have to use partners and suppliers outside the EU/EEA in certain cases.\n\nWithout the possibility of transferring your information to recipients outside the EU / EEA, KILROY will be unable to deliver certain travel arrangements. This applies if booking your trip requires that information is sent to recipients outside the EU/EEA, for example, to book flights, hotels, etc., at your travel destination.\n\nData protection legislation in these countries may be more lenient than it is in Denmark and in the rest of the EU/EEA, as in most cases there will be countries where the EU Commission has assessed that the data protection level is not at par with the data protection level within the EU/EEA.\n\nIn the event that it is practically possible for us, the transfer of your personal data will be based on the standard transfer contracts developed by the European Commission, which are specially prepared for this purpose. As far as transfers to the United States are concerned, they will, as far as possible, be done on the basis of Privacy Shield. Privacy Shield is an agreement between the EU and the United States, which establishes a strong set of data protection rules and security measures that US companies, who have joined the agreement, are obliged to comply with when processing personal data.\n\nHowever, in certain cases it may not be practical for KILROY to enter into a standard transfer contract or use Privacy Shield as a legal transfer basis. In such cases, the transfer of the information will be carried out pursuant to Article 49.1(b) of the Data Protection Regulation, as the transfer of your personal data to a certain country is necessary for the purpose of fulfilling the contract between you and KILROY (the booking of your trip) or for the purpose of executing measures at your request prior to entering such a contract (e.g. in the case of a qualified offer as mentioned in section 6.13). It is therefore important that you are aware that transferring your personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA when booking a trip with KILROY means that your personal data will not enjoy the same protection as when subject to Danish or EU laws and regulations.\n\nWhen transferring data there is a potential risk that there are no clear, precise and accessible laws and regulations in the country in question regarding access to personal data by the authorities of the country; that there are no laws and regulations that the access of a country's authorities to your information must be necessary and proportionate; that the country does not have an independent and effective supervisory authority and that the country has no available and effective legal remedies for the registered.\n\nIf you do not wish that KILROY sends your personal data to recipients outside of the EU/EEA, please advise us at the latest when booking your trip. KILROY does not, in any case, pass your personal data to recipients outside of the EU/EEA, unless this is necessary to carry out our business and meet your needs e.g. by delivering the requested trip.\n\nData integrity and security\n\nPersonal data will be stored no longer than necessary in order to fulfil the purpose for which they have been collected, unless the storage is required to comply with national legal requirements, including statutory storage periods in connection with bookkeeping, etc.\n\nIt is KILROY’s policy to protect personal data by taking adequate technical and organisational security measures. When your personal data is no longer needed, we will ensure that they are deleted in a safe manner.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou are entitled to access to any personal data we have registered and use, information on where it comes from and what we use it for. You can obtain information about how long we store your data, who receives data about you and to what extent we disclose data in Denmark and abroad. Your right of access may, however, be restricted by legislation, protection of other persons’ privacy and consideration for our business and practices. Our know-how, business secrets, as well as internal assessments and material, may also be exempt from the right of access.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to object to our processing your personal data. This is the case, for example, when the processing is based on our legitimate interests.\n\nObjection to direct marketing: You have the right to object to our use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling that is related to this purpose.\n\nIf the data is incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant, you are entitled to have the data corrected or erased with the restrictions that follow from existing legislation and rights to process data. These rights are known as the “right to rectification”, “right to erasure” or “right to be forgotten”.\n\nIf you believe that the data we have registered about you is incorrect, or if you have objected to the use of the data, you may demand that we restrict the use of these data to storage. Use will be restricted to storage only until the correctness of the data can be established, or it can be checked whether our legitimate interests outweigh your interests.\n\nIf you are entitled to have the data we have registered about you erased, you may instead request us to restrict the use of these data to storage. If we need to use the data we have registered about you solely to assert a legal claim, you may also demand that other use of these data be restricted to storage. We may, however, be entitled to other use to assert a legal claim or if you have granted your consent to this.\n\nYou can withdraw your consent at any given time. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to offer you specific services or products. Note also that we will continue to use your personal data, for example, to fulfil an agreement we have made with you or if we are required to do so by law.\n\nIf we use data based on your consent or as a result of an agreement, and the data processing is automated, you have a right to receive a copy of the data you have provided in an electronic machine-readable format.\n\nIf you wish to claim one or more of your rights, please contact us at [email protected]. Your request will be processed in accordance with the data protection legislation currently in force.\n\nComplaints about the processing of your personal data by KILROY can be made to:\n\nUK – Information Commissioner’s Office\n\nWycliffe House, Water Ln, Wilmslow SK9 5AF, England Website: https://ico.org.uk/\n\nDenmark - Datatilsynet\n\nBorgergade 28, 5. 1300 København K Denmark E-mail: [email protected]\n\nFinland - Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman\n\nPO Box 315, 00181 Helsinki.
