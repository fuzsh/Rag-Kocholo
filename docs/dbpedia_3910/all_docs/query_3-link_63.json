        "text": "Isabel Barnes (Hermione) is 18 and a senior this year. She has previously performed in The Yellow Star, Amy Carmichael, & Sherlock Holmes, and decided to try something new working backstage in Memora. In addition to acting and working with the Wholesome Life crew, she enjoys baking delicious treats for friends and family, plays volleyball for WCA and serves in her church. After graduation, she will continue expanding her culinary skills and hopes to open her own allergy-free bakery. Isabel would like to thank her family for their support and the endless trips to practice; and also to her sister for always being in her corner and having her back.\n\nTate Cockman (Joe Kilroy) is an 18 year old senior. He has been doing Chatt since he was in the third grade. He enjoys art, work, hanging out with friends, and serving at his church, Bible Baptist Church of Wilmington. He has plans to attend Pensacola Christian College in August in order to further his education and knowledge of God. He also plans on participating in their musical theater program on top of his schooling. He would like to thank his parents, who have supported him all along, as well as his friends who have always been by his side no matter what he finds himself going through. Tate will greatly miss CHATT, as it has been a very big part of his life over the last 9 years. Finally, he’d like to thank The Lord for showing him his talents and allowing him to use them for His glory.\n\nRomans 12:1\n\nJacob Coyne (Harry) is 18 and this is his 7th CHATT performance. He has always helped with the backstage in the past so this is his first time ever acting. He likes steak, rice, Jesus Christ and would like to thank his friends for making his experience much more enjoyable.\n\nIsaac Dockins (Dale) is a 17 year old senior in high school. This is his third play, the first being Horizons of Gold earlier this year, when he played a character that had no name to share. When Isaac isn’t acting, doing schoolwork, or hanging siding, he really loves to go fishing, kayaking, kayak fishing (obviously), and fishing from kayaks. Isaac wants to thank his family, friends, and especially his directors for all of their support, their great advice, and all of the fun memories!!\n\nAlex Ervin (USO Entertainer Dean) is a senior. He has had various roles. He played Jimmy in Amy Carmichael and Sid Prince in Sherlock Holmes. He always enjoys making the crowd laugh. His hobbies are playing the didgeridoo and xylophone…just kidding, it’s playing the piano. He wants to thank the Lord for the talents He’s given him. He also wants to thank his biggest fans, his parents.\n\nMax Hougland (Mr Wilcox)is 17 and a senior. This is Max’s third time working with Wholesome Life Productions, he was backstage in Horizons of Gold, and then debuted his acting in Inheritance where he played a Swedish engineer, Joseph Beck. Max likes playing volleyball, playing piano, painting, thrifting with his mom, collecting vintage clothing which he costumed much of the cast with, Max would like to thank the directors for investing their time and energy and to the fellow actors and actresses for being so wonderful to work with.\n\nKina Lamb (Edith) is 19, home educated, and marrying her sweetheart in 77 days. This is her first and last play with CHATT, and she enjoyed seeing the BTS of a theatre production and playing Edith. Kina is a professional photographer and enjoys playing the piano, cooking, memorizing Scripture, making Scripture calligraphy signs, writing, learning, and thinking in her spare moments between wedding planning. She loves spending time with her special people and living life to the fullest. She believes that Jesus Christ will be victorious and wants everyone to know that He has promised to be the believer’s Husband.\n\nBlake Mandelstein (Leo Pickford) is 18 years old and a senior in High School. He has been with CHATT since 2019 but only started acting in 2021 for Sherlock Holmes. It’s sad that this is his last play with CHATT but he is forever grateful for all of the friends He’s made over the years and all the fun and great performances he has been a part of. He wants to thank God first and foremost for giving him the ability to perform. He is also thankful for Mrs Rambeck, Ashley, and Sanchez for being such kind and supportive directors. He would also like to thank his parents and siblings for being there with him every step of the way!\n\nAlanna Sanchez (Audrey Taylor) is 18 and in her senior year of high school. Kilroy Was Here is her 6th performance with CHATT/Wholesome Life Productions. Alanna enjoys playing volleyball, going hiking, and spending time with her friends and family. She is truly grateful to all the directors who put so much time into their theater kids."
