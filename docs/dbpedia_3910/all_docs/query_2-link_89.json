        "meta_description": "The War Murals Project is an initiative that aims to preserve and share the stories and artwork of servicemembers who have served in the Global War on Terror, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. The deployment art created by servicemembers, often in the form of murals and graffiti on T-Walls and barriers, serves as a powerful and unique way to connect with the history and experiences of those who served.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor over 20 years, these pieces of art have been ubiquitous on military bases and outposts around the world, but are frequently overlooked and forgotten once the servicemembers return home. Many of these pieces of art are now in a state of decay or have been painted over as bases closed and the mission changed. The War Murals Project is working to collect, catalog, and share these pieces of art and the memories they represent before they are lost forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe War Murals Project is also building a searchable digital museum to make it easy for anyone to view, search and engage with the artworks.
