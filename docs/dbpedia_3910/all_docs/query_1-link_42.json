        "text": "QUINCY – Kilroy is here again.\n\nIt's played host to the farmers market, a beer garden, ribbon cuttings and a restaurant patio in the last year, but the history of Quincy's newly dubbed Kilroy Square goes far beyond its modern use.\n\nKilroy Was Here, a slogan that started at the Fore River shipyard and became a common expression among World War II soldiers, is being revived in the city where its worldwide following was born.\n\nQuincy has named a new courtyard downtown – accessible from the city parking garage, The Fours restaurant and Cottage Avenue – Kilroy Square to connect Quincy Center's recent redevelopment with the city's storied industrial past.\n\n\"We kicked the question around a little bit as we built out the square, 'How do we identify the different areas for people?' \" Mayor Thomas Koch said. \"We had a bit of the military theme already going with the Generals Park and the city's shipbuilding history was just for the war effort. Kilroy Was Here is a nod to that history, but we're having some fun with it.\"\n\nThe catchphrase originated at the Fore River shipyard in the early 1940s when inspector James Kilroy, of Halifax, wrote it on ships and equipment he had inspected. At its busiest during the war, more than 50,000 people worked at the shipyard.\n\nA tale of two Quincys: Unbridled growth in a city rich with history\n\nRed Line anniversary: Quincy's development boom arrived 50 years ago\n\nSee inside: 25 most expensive South Shore homes recently sold - $3.5 million antique in Duxbury No. 1\n\nWorld War II soldiers and sailors in Europe scrawled Kilroy Was Here on walls, tanks, ships and anything that would stand still as a show of pride and to show that they had been there first.\n\nAt some point, the cartoon of a long-nosed man with big eyes peering over a wall became linked to the saying.\n\nKilroy Was Here has endured in both the popular and military culture and has even showed up in recent history on walls in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThis isn't the first time efforts to revitalize the phrase have picked up steam in Quincy.\n\nThe city's tourism bureau, Discover Quincy, in the early 2000s launched a postcard campaign to get the catchphrase emblazoned on a U.S. stamp and a Navy ship. The Quincy-born icon was a finalist to become a stamp in 2008 and again in 2015, but never made the cut. A locally run website, kilroywashere.org, still pushes for the honor.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, the oldest of Kilroy's nine children, Margaret Kilroy Fitzgerald, was 75 years old. She spoke to The Patriot Ledger as she wondered how her father, who died in the 1960s, would have reacted to knowing his unassuming scribble was now in the running for a national nod.\n\nDetails on upcoming new Quincy brewery: 8 beers to start, Skee-ball, 1980s-style arcade games\n\nRivalries with lots on the line: VOTE - South Shore High School Football Game of the Week\n\nOvertime scandal: Former Boston cop from Quincy, a former union leader, admits to fraud\n\nFitzgerald recalled him saying he was “honored” by all the fuss. Fitzgerald said her father owned a moving business and a gas station, but when World War II hit, his businesses slumped and he started a 20-year career at the shipyard.\n\n“He never tried to capitalize on it,” she said. “He had no intention of starting a legend. He said he was just doing his job.”\n\nThe USS Salem, Discover Quincy and the Quincy Sun newspaper hosted a Kilroy Was Here photo contest in 2005 that drew more than 320 entries from five continents.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, the Ohio Historical Society hosted a Kilroy Was Here exhibit with life-sized family scenes from before, during and after World War II, complemented by videotaped recollections of Ohioans who lived during the era. The exhibit reflected on American life in the 1940s.\n\nPut 'em up: Quincy man will enter the ring to raise money for cancer research\n\nLittle puppy Kitts: Stuffed animals sold to support memorial for slain Braintree police dog Kitt\n\nDante: So many plans to honor Weymouth 17-year-old who died of cancer - including from the Revs"
