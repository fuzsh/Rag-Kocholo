        "text": "On this day in 1965, Kilroy was here. Disney’s first four-part story, Kilroy, aired on Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color, telling the story, as Walt Disney explained, “of an ex-Marine named Kilroy, who, on his discharge from the service, decides to visit the hometown of his best friend in the Marines. Well, Kilroy arrived just in time to walk into another war. This one was called the War at Wilton Junction, and it involved a bunch of boys, this cannon, City Hall, and all the neighbors. Now how can an ex-Marine stay out of a fight like that?” The role of Oscar Kilroy is just one of countless starring roles portrayed by Warren Berlinger. Fans of classic television in particular will instantly recognize him from his guest spots such as Chief Engineer Dobritch in Operation Petticoat, Herb in Too Close for Comfort, Army Sergeant Betchler, and other roles throughout the years in Happy Days and countless other shows, such as Laverne and Shirley, Murder, She Wrote, CHiPs, and Disney’s limited-run series Small and Frye and Herbie, the Love Bug."
