        "text": "Kviteseid Old Church in Telemark, Norway, is a medieval stone church with murals of a seemingly informal character. These depictions consist of ships, figures, individual letters, and longer inscriptions, apparently randomly placed on the interior chancel walls. By studying the painting techniques, the stratigraphic structure and the motifs of the paintings, the authors explore the intentions behind these motifs. They argue that, although of simple manufacture and unprogrammatic, they were an important part of the late-medieval and post-Reformational church experience. Several of the images and inscriptions may have had a memorial intention. This study provides a new understanding of a type of murals found in several medieval churches in Norway and abroad that has often been (mis)interpreted as graffiti.\n\nLeaving one’s personal mark at a site of cult is an age-old practice attested in several religions, including Christianity from its earliest phases onwards. This article asks to what degree scratching graffiti into church walls was accepted behaviour in Western Europe during the medieval and early modern period. It seeks to complicate the view that disapproval of graffiti is a predominantly modern sentiment, by examining examples of both acceptance and resistance to graffiti at sacred sites. The attempts of Counter-Reformation bishop Carlo Bascapè (1550-1615) to root out what he perceived as impious vandalism at the sacro monte of Varallo in Northern Italy, combined with an analysis of the graffiti on the glass panes of the Ecce Homo chapel postdating Bascapè’s ban, together serve to suggest new directions for the study of the pre-modern significance of, and particularly resistance to, graffiti.\n\nThe survey location sits within the historic city of Chichester; the Cathedral was constructed as a part of the urbanisation of Diocesan seats following the Norman conquests and later became the site of pilgrimage to St Richard, a former bishop of the Cathedral. A visual survey was undertaken at Chichester Cathedral to identify and record the pre-reformation graffiti marks present within the body of the cathedral church. Following this initial recording a total station was used to plot the locations of these marks, this confirmed the initial findings that much of the graffiti was clustered in specific locations. These points within the cathedral relate directly to the veneration of St Richard. It is the distribution of the graffiti marks at the entrance to the cathedral used by the pilgrims, at both veneration sites and at a single location between the two that marks out a probable route for the pilgrims to be moved round the cathedral. As a preliminary work this raises questions as to the likely distribution of marks at other pilgrimage sites, the nature of these marks within the medieval world and the implicit permission granted in allowing such marks to be placed on the walls of the cathedral.\n\nThe relationship between text and image in later medieval art is complex and has a growing literature. Wall paintings in two churches in South Wales suggest ways in which text could inspire sophisticated programmes of paintings. At Llandeilo Talybont, a sequence telling the story of the Crucifixion through the Instruments of the Passion relates to medieval devotions to the Instruments and to readings from the Holy Week liturgy. At Llancarfan, a medieval satirical poem on fashionable clothing and a verse translation of the life of St George suggest links between the wall paintings of Death and the Gallant, the Seven Deadly Sins and St George. Apparently random collections of wall paintings may therefore reflect a process of interaction between public art and public knowledge of texts."
