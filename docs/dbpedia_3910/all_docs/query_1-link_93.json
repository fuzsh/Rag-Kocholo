Specifically, this stanza:\n\nThe light on the breast of the Moon's jagged crust,\n\ngave a luster of green cheese to the gray lunar dust.\n\nWhen what to his wondering eyes should appear,\n\nbut a Burma Shave sign - saying \"Kilroy was here.\"\n\nBlackarrow\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 3174\n\nFrom: Belfast, United Kingdom\n\nRegistered: Feb 2002\n\nposted 04-29-2020 03:16 PM I've never heard this, and I would be very surprised if it happened. We know that Gene Cernan traced his daughter's initials (\"C.D.C.\") on the moon, but I can't see any of the astronauts frivolously taking time to trace out an 11-letter graffito, not easy in a pressure-suit.\n\nThat's not to say it is impossible: the astronauts always had to get back to the vicinity of the LM in good time to leave a significant safety-margin, particularly on the \"J\" missions. Once back, there was time to play a little golf, or do a few \"Olympic\" jumps, or a \"hammer and feather\" demonstration, but all of those activities had variable degrees of scientific merit (particularly the \"hammer and feather\") whereas taking time to scrawl \"Kilroy was here\" would have been time squandered.\n\nIf it was done, I would say it was by the astronaut who said \"Good luck Mr Gorsky.\"\n\nRick Mulheirn\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 4219\n\nFrom: England\n\nRegistered: Feb 2001\n\nposted 04-29-2020 06:11 PM \"T.D.C\" Geoffrey surely... unless Gene had another daughter.

I thought Gene Cernan wished he had done that (at the huge boulder when hurriedly scooping dirt off a ledge) if heâd had more time, and Al Bean subsequently granted his wish, in one of his paintings. oly\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1008\n\nFrom: Perth, Western Australia\n\nRegistered: Apr 2015\n\nposted 04-30-2020 08:29 AM From Gene Cernan's oral history project interview.\n\nThere have been people who want to believe in the fantasy or the conspiracy, whatever, that it was all done in Hollywood, we never really walked on the Moon. Well, if they want to have missed one of the greatest adventures in the history of mankind, that's their choice. But once my footsteps were on the surface of the Moon, nobody, but nobody, could ever take, and to this day can take those footsteps away from me. Like my daughter's initials I put into the Moon during that three days we were there. Someone said, \"How long will they be there?\" I said, \"Forever, however long forever is.\" I'm not sure we, any of us, understand that.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 43686\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-30-2020 08:39 AM Cernan had intended to write his daughter's initials near a large boulder at Station 6, and that boulder became known as \"Tracy's rock.\" (And yes, Bean later painted that scene.)\n\nBut having missed that opportunity, he said he made up for it later in the mission. An excerpt from his autobiography:\n\nI drove the Rover about a mile away from the LM and parked it carefully so the television camera could photograph our takeoff the next day. As I dismounted, I took a moment to kneel and with a single finger, scratched [my daughter] Tracy's initials, \"TDC,\" in the lunar dust, knowing those three letters would remain there undisturbed for more years than anyone could imagine."
