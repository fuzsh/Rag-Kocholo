The magnificent former home of Houston philanthropist and collector Ima Hogg, the 1928 John Staub–designed house is situated on 14 acres of organically maintained gardens in the historic River Oaks neighborhood.\n\nIma Hogg (1882–1975) devoted her life to Houston's early civic, educational, and cultural institutions. She was also an astute and ambitious collector, determined to assemble the finest examples of American material culture from 1620 to 1870. In 1957, she donated her home and collections to the MFAH. Bayou Bend opened to the public in 1966, quickly establishing itself locally and nationally as a cultural treasure.\n\nToday, nearly 2,600 objects installed in 28 period room settings showcase the evolution of American taste from the Colonial through the Victorian eras, including furnishings, paintings, silver, ceramics, and glass. Outside, visitors stroll through surrounding woodlands and a series of gracious and beautiful gardens intended as outdoor rooms for living and entertaining, not just views to be admired from within the house. In 2010, Bayou Bend opened a visitor center designed to be a modern gateway to the historic collections and gardens. The house is just a short walk away, through a bird sanctuary and over a suspension bridge that spans Buffalo Bayou.\n\n► Learn more about each of Bayou Bend’s period rooms.\n\nLocation\n\n► Map & Directions\n\nFunding has been provided to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021."
