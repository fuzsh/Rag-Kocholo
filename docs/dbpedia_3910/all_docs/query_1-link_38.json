        "text": "Kevin Smith is back at it again!\n\nThe filmmaker, author and podcaster shared a new photo from Kilroy Was Here set on Twitter, captioning it: “Starting 2018 the fun way: on a movie set!” Actress and daughter of Smith, Harley Quinn Smith, is featured in the photo.\n\n‘Kilroy is here’ was an American pop-culture expression that became popular phrase during World War II, which was typically seen in graffiti. This horror anthology movie will be the first time Smith has shared a writing credit with anyone for one of his movies, as Andrew McElfresh (White Chicks) co-wrote the script for the movie.\n\nIn a press release, Smith describe the film as a “monster movie in the sense of a classic morality tale.”\n\nNo one wants to see you spill the blood of innocents, but when someone crosses the line and goes bad, you get to make them pay in horrible ways, and the audience cheers.” Like The Twilight Zone, Killroy is full of ironic twists and grisly moments. We wanted to make an anthology film in the vein of Creepshow.\n\nA release date for the movie has not been set as of late.\n\nExcited to see Kevin step back into the horror-genre? Let us know in the comments below!"
