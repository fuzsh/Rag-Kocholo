How many times have you heard the term “Kilroy Was Here”? I’ve personally never seen a WWII or Korean War photo depicting the infamous graffiti, but now have a copy in my own collection. The recent acquisition of a 987th Armored Field Artillery negative grouping uncovered this little gem. I also like the grammatically incorrect North Korean proclamation slathered across the wall. Enjoy!
