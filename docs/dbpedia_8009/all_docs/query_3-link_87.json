        "text": "A conversation with the writer and technology activist Cory Doctorow has something of the rollercoaster about it, weaving and swaying like the theme park rides which feature in his new novel, Makers. When we meet, the fast-talking Canadian rattles through concepts, politics, theories and people at breakneck speed, leaping up from his armchair to grab things that illustrate his points. His cosy den of a London office, lined with book-crammed shelves, pictures, bits of technology and random paraphernalia from a loudly ticking cuckoo clock to a hoover/toaster robot, provides him with plenty of things to grab.\n\nIt bears an unmistakable similarity, in fact, to the junk-filled garages in which Perry and Lester, the hacker-heroes of Makers, kickstart a new economic system based on a boundlessly optimistic creative mash-up culture and the crazy things that can be invented using 3D printers, from seashell robots that make toast to Boogie Woogie Elmo dolls that drive cars. The revolution they lead, based on small cells of technology entrepreneurs working on rapid micro-projects, transforms America, creating an economic bubble documented by a journo-blogger, Suzanne, and a cartoon-ily vicious British tabloid hack, \"rat-toothed Freddy\". Inevitably, the bubble bursts and Perry and Lester have to make their way through the ensuing depression in an adventure that takes in interactive theme rides, a jealous Disney corporation, a parody of the Atkins diet (\"Fatkins\"), a Goth cult and an avalanche of lawsuits. It's not easy to describe because, like his conversation, Doctorow's novel fizzes with ideas and jumps with breathtaking speed from one technological breakthrough to another until you're no longer sure what's based on reality and what's purely a figment of his inventive mind.\n\nIt's the kind of SF that, as Doctorow has it, \"predicts the present\" rather than imagines the future. \"I like to take something that already exists but isn't very mainstream and write about it as though it's being invented next year,\" he explains. \"Then as the thing you've written about becomes more mainstream everyone assumes that you invented it, rather than having been inspired by the nascent invention you've just heard of.\"\n\nThis approach does inevitably rely on readers coming to the book with a certain level of natural geekiness, and Doctorow appears to make few concessions to an audience that doesn't, for example, regularly browse Wired magazine or keep up with the latest online developments. Nor does he apologise for this. \"I really think that books today are meant to be read with Google next to you – that anything that you come to where you think, hmmm, that really does sound interesting: I'd like to know if it's real, I'd like to know how it works, how it fits into the story – you go to Google,\" he says. \"It's like a little Easter egg in the book, to go to Google and see that this stuff is real to some extent or another.\"\n\nDoctorow's optimism about the technology of the present and the near future is infectious and comes across not only in his books but also through his hugely popular technology blog, Boing Boing. He writes prolifically about technology and digital rights – in blog posts, lectures and comment pieces (he's a regular on the Guardian's technology pages and Comment is free) as well as his novels – and I wondered how far he has to change his mindset when it comes to writing fiction about technology rather than posts and polemics.\n\n\"As I move around the world I pick up pieces of puzzles. I don't know how many puzzles there are or what the box art is or if they are all part of the same puzzle, and the way that I lay them on my puzzle table is by blogging them,\" he says. \"Writing it up is a mnemonic; it helps me to remember, and to think it through a little. And every now and then I find a corner and a piece of it snaps together and it becomes a speech or a short story or an article.\"\n\n\"It's like filling the world's biggest spice rack,\" he goes on, \"and when it's time to make soup you pick the 18 spices or the four or two you're going to put in, but it's nice to have them all arrayed before you. You pick the ones that go together but, like in cooking, it's often the unexpected that gives you wonderful results.\"\n\nOne of those puzzle pieces was a talk Doctorow heard which became an early inspiration for Makers. The head of the music industry trade body the BPI warned that every business would be \"dead in the water\" because of trademark infringements once everybody's desk has a 3D printer on it. Doctorow was outraged at the lack of imagination.\n\n\"If he thinks that the major consequence of a 3D printer is going to be trademark infringement, well, it's like saying 'you just wait until the railroad comes along and all you people who rely on your income sewing up oat bags for horses' noses are going to be out of business',\" says Doctorow. \"I mean, it's true but it's totally trivial. Printing AK-47s is so much weirder and more interesting as a futuristic effect of the 3D printer than printing trademarked objects will ever be. It's so incredibly parochial and small-minded to say 'oh my gosh, 3D printers are going to bankrupt our business by making moulded Mickey Mouse heads'. It's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nIn Makers, 3D printers are used to run off everything from homes for squatters to the fairground rides that cause the plot-twisting showdown with Disney. But, typically for a Doctorow novel, it's not as far-fetched as it might sound: the 3D world is already here. He jumps up to show me a 3D museum object, part of a bear's jaw, that was scanned and printed in six hours, and explains that he's waiting for the post to bring one of the first 3D-printed objects he's ordered online (\"a beautiful big steel cross that looks like a nun's cross except that the tips are screwdriver tips and it's actually a multi-driver and it hangs around your neck from a leather thong!\") \"We'll have 3D printers which will make the world weird and they will beget something even weirder. 3D printers are just for starters!\" he says, gleefully.\n\nDespite his success in fiction – last year's young adult novel Little Brother was a New York Times bestseller and he has previously won the Locus award and been nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards – Doctorow is better known in some quarters for his political activism around digital freedom and open rights. He's the former European director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group that defends freedom in technology law, policy and standards; he co-founded the UK Open Rights Group; and he's currently campaigning on the government's draconian digital rights bill. Both sides of his work come together in his novels, not just in terms of subject matter but in the way they are distributed. Although published by mainstream presses, Doctorow also releases all his books for free download from his website under a creative commons licence, and talks enthusiastically about the uses people have made of these free online versions of his books, from foreign translations and student films to a teacher in a Detroit school for the blind who was able to run the download of Little Brother through the school's Braille embosser for her students without having to painstakingly retype the whole book first.\n\nFor Doctorow, the freedom to share and copy is a basic moral proposition that he argues for with a passion. \"Sharing your work product for other people's review and improvement is the soul of the enlightenment,\" he says. \"It's the difference between alchemy and science. Every alchemist discovers for himself that drinking mercury is a bad idea. Scientists only have to discover it once because they publish. We all copy and it feels moral to be able to drop the pretence that I am wholly original and you are a copyist. The first self-replicating molecule that boiled out of chemical soup four billion years ago set us on a course of copying that led to us – we are that which copies. Without it we would be gone. Copying is the thing that distinguishes dumb matter from life.\"\n\nAs for the practical side of it, he shrugs. \"Well, I can't prove that it's financially good for me, though it seems to be, and I'm capable of enjoying a solid, middle class living from the proceeds of my books. Even if it is costing me something – and I don't think it is – I'm still able to get by and the nice thing about it is that I'm able to get by without doing things that I think of as anti-social or immoral or hypocritical or bad art.\"\n\nHe admits he does \"get a kind of 'Vichy writer' vibe\" from some fellow writers that he sometimes finds \"a little distressing\" but accepts that \"it's hard to transcend that kind of narrow fear-based view of the world and try to think about what's the best thing to do, both ethically and economically. It's hard to take risks. Not everyone who is artistic is entrepreneurial, although most successful artistic people are, because otherwise you don't have any time to do art.\"\n\nThis entrepreneurial spirit is at the heart of the pioneers Doctorow celebrates in Makers, and who were inspired by his experiences living in San Francisco at the height of the dotcom bubble and then documenting the fallout as the economy collapsed and the investors fled town.\n\n\"What was interesting were the people who stayed,\" he says. \"They just kept making. So they were going on, doing Blogger, doing all the proto-web 2.0 stuff, just all this really interesting technology that wasn't about chasing money but was about chasing the thing that scratched your itch; that kind of hacker ethic of thinking 'I want to make something great because it would be great to make it, not because I believe it will bring riches'. So when I sat down to write, that was what was in my mind – this thought of a city that had been monied and was now teetering on the brink but where authenticity had remained.\"\n\nA few years on, the maker movement has spread beyond the tech world. There's a Maker's Manifesto – \"if you can't open it you don't own it\" – a magazine, Make, and while there are clear parallels to punk in the 1970s and its DIY ethic, Doctorow argues that punk used DIY to reach a destination, to accomplish something – a look, or music – whereas with Making it's the process that matters. Technology enables makers to network like never before and provides the tools – cognitive, social and physical – that allows them to share ideas to improve and build on their inventions.\n\n\"There has never been a better time to be a maker because finding the people who know how to fix the thing that's broken has never been easier. Finding someone else who has done 80% of what you want to do, and sharing the things you have done with other people, has never been easier. A maker is someone who is of and in the 21st century.\" Which pretty neatly sums up Doctorow himself."
