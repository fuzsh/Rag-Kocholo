        "text": "For a list of comics, see Comics featuring Cory Doctorow.\n\nCory Doctorow is a Canadian-British blogger, journalist, and science fiction author who served as co-editor of the blog Boing Boing. He is an activist in favour of liberalising copyright laws and a proponent of the Creative Commons organization, using some of its licences for his books. Some common themes of his work include digital rights management, file sharing, and post-scarcity economics. In xkcd, he wears a red cape and a pair of goggles and blogs from a high-altitude balloon. He would later wear the costume in real life while accepting a Hugo Award on Randall's behalf. He has also been mentioned in the title text of the second image of the what if? article Facebook of the Dead, which say: \"An elderly Cory Doctorow cosplaying by wearing what the future thinks he wore in the past.\"."
