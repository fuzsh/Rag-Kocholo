        "text": "Facebook is struggling to retain users, fending off regulation, trying to pivot to VR, and paying a massive wage premium to attract the workers it needs to make any of this happen. The company is on the ropes\n\nTechnology is making the world more unequal. Only technology can fix this\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nThe inequality of badly-run states is boosted by technology – but technology also makes it easier to destabilise them. So: which future will prevail?\n\nDRM products are defective by design. Time to tell users what they're buying\n\nCory Doctorow in Los Angeles\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation is calling for the labelling of products encumbered with digital rights management. It’s increasingly important as we trust technology with our lives\n\nDon't buy it? When tech firms get it wrong, that's not enough\n\nCory Doctorow in Los Angeles\n\nWith big tech business making regular political and ethical blunders, it is our responsibility to complain – and let them know they must do better\n\nWhy the future of web browsers belongs to the biggest tech firms\n\nCory Doctorow in Los Angeles\n\nChanges made to browser standards will make it harder for new companies to disrupt the status quo and cement the power of Google and Apple\n\nForget Apple's fight with the FBI – our privacy catastrophe has only just begun\n\nCory Doctorow in Los Angeles\n\nThe privacy crisis is a disaster of our own making – and now the tech firms who gathered our data are trying to make money out of privacy\n\nThe FBI wants a backdoor only it can use – but wanting it doesn’t make it possible\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nMuch like climate change denialists, politicians continue to debate encryption – ignoring the consensus of experts that it must not be compromised\n\nWhy is it so hard to convince people to care about privacy?\n\nEvery week or two, from now on, will see new privacy disasters, each worse than the last"
