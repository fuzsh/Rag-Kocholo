        "text": "Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist, and journalist. His latest book is Red Team Blues.\n\nCory Doctorow’s Vision for a Just Tech Revolution\n\nWe talked to famed tech writer Cory Doctorow about his new book, The Internet Con; the fight against Big Tech; and how technology itself isn’t the problem — it’s about who holds the reins.\n\nCory Doctorow Explains Why Big Tech Is Making the Internet Terrible\n\nThe internet is increasingly a miserable place to be. As Cory Doctorow explains, Silicon Valley CEOs and grifters are working hard to keep it that way.\n\nCory Doctorow Wants You to Fight Big Tech\n\nWe talked to author and activist Cory Doctorow about his new book, Chokepoint Capitalism, copyright scams, surveillance capitalism, the lies of Big Tech, and the fight for the freedom to create.\n\nNovelist Cory Doctorow on the Problem With Intellectual Property\n\nPatents were once seen as a temporary reward for inventors. Now, as novelist Cory Doctorow tells Jacobin, they’ve become supposedly inviolable “intellectual property” rights that simply enrich people like Bill Gates."
