        "text": "Cory Doctorow was born in Toronto, Canada. He attended alternative schools and worked at Bakka Bookstore, dropping out of high school at age seventeen. That year, he also sold a story to Canadian speculative fiction magazine On Spec: “2,000 Year Check-up.” He briefly moved to Mexico to write and dropped out of four universities in two years. In 1992 he attended Clarion, and sold a few more stories, which led up to his first pro sale: Aurora and Sturgeon Award finalist “Craphound” in Science Fiction Age (March 1998). Shortly after, he received the Campbell Award for Best New Writer.\n\nDoctorow has worked as a CD-ROM programmer, website designer, volunteer in Central America, CIO for a film company and an ad agency, founder of a software company, and eventually joined the Electronic Frontier Foundation—“a non-profit civil liberties group that defends freedom in technology law, policy, standards and treaties.” He also continued to sell stories. In 2003 he published his first collection, Sunburst Award winner A Place So Foreign and Eight More (Four Walls Eight Windows)—the same year as his Nebula Nominated and Locus Award winning debut novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom (Tor).\n\nDoctorow quit his day job in 2006 to write full time. He stayed on as a special consultant to the EFF. In 2007 he was the Fulbright Chair at the Annenberg Center for Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California. He holds an honorary doctorate in laws from York University (Canada) and an honorary doctorate in computer science from the Open University (UK), where he is a Visiting Professor. He is also an MIT Media Lab Research Affiliate and a Visiting Professor of Practice at the University of North Carolina’s School of Library and Information Science.\n\nTo call Cory Doctorow “prolific” would be an understatement. Besides a veritable mountain of nonfiction, he has a slew of shorter fiction out. Notable entries include novelette “I, Robot” (The Infinite Matrix, February 2005), which was nominated for BSFA and Hugo awards, and won a Locus Award; novelette “When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth” (Jim Baen’s Universe, August 2006), which won a Locus Award; novella “After the Siege” (The Infinite Matrix, January 2007), which won a Locus Award; novella “True Names” (Fast Forward 2 from Pyr in 2008, co-authored with Benjamin Rosenbaum) which was a Hugo, Locus, and Sturgeon finalist; novella “The Man Who Sold the Moon” (Hieroglyph: Stories and Visions for a Better Future from William Morrow in 2014), which was a Locus finalist and a Sturgeon winner; and many others.\n\nDoctorow has also published several novels, many of them racking up awards nods of various kinds. Among his hits are young adult bestseller Little Brother (Tor, 2008), which won the Campbell Memorial Award, Prometheus Award, and Sunburst Award, and was shortlisted for the Hugo and SFWA Nebula Awards—it was even adapted as a stage play; and Walkaway (Tor, 2017) which was a Locus Award finalist and won a Dragon Award. In 2020 Doctorow was one of three authors inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association’s Hall of Fame. In 2022 he earned the Sir Arthur Clarke Imagination in Service to Society Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nCory Doctorow has a number of recent and upcoming projects, including nonfiction title The Internet Con recently published by Verso, The Lost Cause due this month from Tor, and The Bezzle due from Tor in February of 2024.\n\nYou’ve been publishing short fiction since the nineties, and your debut novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, came out in 2003. What has changed about your writing since then, whether craft, approach, or something else, and to what do you attribute those changes?\n\nNot long after my first novel, my (other) professional life took off—first, it was co-founding a venture-backed tech startup, then it was serving as EU director for a digital human rights group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. My work schedule became very intense: I was on the road twenty-seven days per month, in thirty-one countries over three years. I wrote two novels during that period, and to do so, I had to learn a new discipline: I had to figure out how to write when I felt uninspired, or worse, like everything I was writing was terrible.\n\nWhat saved me was the realization that while there were days when it felt like the writing was great, and days when it felt terrible; and though there were passages that, in retrospect, were great, or terrible, that these were not correlated. Instead, the most reliable correlate of how I felt about my work was everything except the writing: stress, jetlag, low blood sugar . . . That realization let me write my two hundred and fifty words (on later books, this expanded to as many as two thousand words) every day, no matter where I was or how I felt. I learned to write crouching by the only electrical outlet in a departure lounge, under a water-fountain, next to the bathroom entrance. To write on escalators coming up out of the subway, or in the back of cabs, or with my laptop perched on a bollard while waiting for a meeting to start.\n\nLuckily, it took me ten+ years to realize the corollary: that the days when I felt great because the words seemed wonderful were just as likely to be illusory as those days when the writing felt terrible, and maybe those seemingly wonderful words would all end up in the trash. After that, it’s been a little bit of a struggle to keep it all from being utterly anhedonic.\n\nBack in 2017, in your Locus interview, you described Walkaway as an “optimistic disaster novel.” Library Journal described The Lost Cause as “a message of hope in a near-future that looks increasingly bleak.” Is hope an important element for you to have in your fiction and is it something you often come back to?\n\nHope is something I really value—as opposed to optimism (notwithstanding that Locus quip). Hope is the idea that, if you take some action, you can materially improve your circumstances and attain a new vantage point from which you can espy formerly occluded courses of action that will improve things further. You may not be able to see all the territory, much less map a route from where you are to the apex you want to achieve, but you can follow a gradient of making things better and seeing what new moves are available when you do.\n\nBy contrast, optimism is a species of fatalism, the belief that things will get better no matter what you do. It’s a first-cousin to pessimism, one that denies human agency.\n\nIn fiction, we like active characters who solve problems. Thirty+ years ago, at Clarion, Nancy Kress told me that the protagonist of your story is the person with the most at stake, and who changes the most. That makes fiction and hope closely related to one another. A protagonist who is a prisoner of destiny and can’t improve their situation is weak, passive, and uninteresting.\n\nBut my fiction tends towards characters who solve their problems by forming and cultivating groups, who work together to make things happen. That reflects my own ideology: that the world is changed by movements, not charismatic leaders or heroes.\n\nThe Lost Cause is set in the 2050s and has generational political divisions as one of the world-building elements: older folks who are mostly conservative, against younger folks who are more liberal. Some of the conversations in various communities center around the idea of “didactic” fiction. What makes something didactic, if delivering messages of various kinds is inevitable in fiction, where is the line and what are the “acceptable” ways to cross it?\n\nI think that prohibitions against things like “being didactic” or “being expositive,” etc., are misplaced, and stem from the difficulty—or maybe the impossibility—of understanding why a piece of writing isn’t gelling for you.\n\nWhich is to say, it’s easy to say, “I’m not liking this story,” but when you try to figure out what would make it better, it’s a crapshoot. Many’s the time an editor identified a story of mine that wasn’t working and requested a specific revision, only to say, “Dang, that didn’t fix it.” Stories are mysterious.\n\nThe “rules” about what you shouldn’t put in a story are really a kind of list of things that are hard to do well. I love exposition—that chapter in Crytonomicon describing the platonically ideal way to eat a bowl of Cap’n Crunch just kills me. I love didacticism: those meetings in KSR’s Mars trilogy? I want a whole goddamned book of them.\n\nBut both of these are things that are hard to do well and easy to screw up. When writing teachers, or critiquing circle peers, or editors, come across a piece of work that isn’t gelling, they’ll reach to this list of no-nos and see if any of them appear in the story, and suggest that the writer swap out these hard-to-do/easy-to-flub elements for things that are easier to pull off. Like a lot of troubleshooting, editorial advice is a matter of informed guesswork.\n\nWhat was the initial inspiration for this book, and how did the story change or develop over time and the drafting/editing process?\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking about old grievances. I’ve been an antifascist campaigner since my teen years, and it’s obvious to me that defeating your adversary doesn’t extinguish their cause. The losers of every conflict are capable of nursing grudges, even across multiple generations—and even when the losers were objectively in the wrong.\n\nThe climate emergency was manufactured by greedy corporate executives, protected by venal politicians, and given cover by right-wing culture warriors who believed and amplified every lie about the link between greenhouse gases and the Earth’s habitability for generations. These people took actions that they knew—or should have known—could kill billions of people. They did something monstrous.\n\nIt seems evident to me that even if we “win” the climate wars and reorient our productive capacity to remediating generations’ worth of climate inaction, the losers of that fight will not accept defeat. Like the distant descendants of American Confederate traitors, their bitterness will fester for generations to come.\n\nThe Lost Cause was the outcome of this line of thinking—wondering what it would be like to fight these people as defenders of a new status quo, where we are taking climate seriously, and not as insurgents, hoping to make a new world where we stop pretending the world isn’t on fire.\n\nPublisher’s Weekly calls the romance element a “distraction”—is romance in this book just as important as other narrative elements, does it serve a function that some readers might miss?\n\nWith respect, I think PW is wrong. Love and care for each other is the center of all solidaristic projects. The romance at the center of this book is a microcosm for the besotted, terrified, head-over-heels commitment that the characters make to saving this planet and the people and animals who call it home.\n\nFolks who come across your work from a variety of avenues probably think of you as someone who has strong opinions and isn’t afraid to share them. Are there things about this book that may surprise some readers?\n\nI don’t think so! This is a very, very Cory Doctorow kind of novel. Like Bill McKibben said, it’s “a chronicle of mutual aid that’s politically perceptive, scientifically sound, and extraordinarily hopeful even amidst the smoke.” That’s basically my brand.\n\nWhat is central or essential for you about this story, what do you want readers to know about it, beyond blurbs and reviews?\n\nWe’ve clearly shot past many of the deadlines for action on the climate. There’s therms sunk into the ocean that aren’t going to go anywhere until they’ve done some serious work on the ice-caps. We are going to face deadly and destructive storms, pandemics, flooding, and fires. It’s too late to avoid them.\n\nBut it’s not too late to take them seriously—to engineer a soft landing for people who fall off these many cliffs.\n\nThe Lost Cause is a book about taking climate change seriously too late—but better late than never. It’s about envisioning a future in which we don’t despair over the missed chances to avert disaster, but rather, apply ourselves to ensuring that disaster never becomes catastrophe.\n\nAnyone who lives with a chronic illness, or has lost a loved one too soon, or has passed through any other one-way transformation into a world they never wanted to inhabit, knows that there comes a point when you need shift your focus from mourning to adaptation. This is a book about what happens when our species does that.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite sparkly SFF ideas or (somewhat near) futuristic tidbits from this book that you don’t mind “spoiling” for readers?\n\nI’m very interested in what it means to treat materials as scarce and energy as abundant, which is the true nature of these things, and the opposite of how we work with them today.\n\nIt would take just 0.4% of the solar energy that reaches the Earth’s surface to give every person on the planet the energy budget of a Canadian (we Canadians are basically cold Americans, which gives us the worst energy footprint on Earth). We get a fresh delivery of energy every time the sun rises, and another one every time the moon rises.\n\nBy contrast, the Earth has a decidedly finite supply of materials, and we only get new materials when a meteor survives atmospheric entry.\n\nAnd yet, we throw things away because it would be too energy-intensive to decompose them back into the material stream.\n\nThis is exactly backwards!\n\nMuch of the peripheral technological background of The Lost Cause is about a re-factoring of all our energy and material usage to provide real abundance and comfort to the whole world, by making smart, effective use of our abundant energy to stretch our materials to infinity and beyond.\n\nThe Bezzle brings readers back to character Martin Hench from Red Team Blues. In the first book, some commented that Martin was an unusual choice for a “hardboiled detective” style protagonist, being a 67-year-old forensic accountant. Red Team Blues was also just a few steps into the future, whereas The Bezzle jumps back to 2006. Why a 67-year-old forensic accountant?\n\nA typical noir detective is basically an unlicensed cop: someone who searches the places the cops can’t search and asks impertinent questions of people the cops can’t touch. But by the end of the story, that detective realizes that these weren’t things the cops couldn’t do—they’re things the cops wouldn’t do. Solving the crime would mean unraveling the status quo, and the cops’ first job is preserving the order, not solving crimes. Crimes are sometimes features, not bugs.\n\nMarty Hench is a noir forensic accountant, which means he’s an unlicensed tax investigator—another kind of cop. He, too, goes places and asks questions the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board can’t ask, and he, too, is constantly learning that it’s not that the tax authorities *can’t* do these things, they just won’t, because they, too, are first and foremost guardians of the social order.\n\nThe Bezzle is set in the moment in which the curdling of the dream of a better world of digital tech became undeniable—the era when Yahoo! was buying and killing every promising Web 2.0 startup, using billions pumped into it by the capital markets. Marty Hench is the Zelig of tech scams: he’s been in Silicon Valley since the early PC days of the eighties, and he’s had a front-row seat to every phase in the constantly mutating tech/finance scam. I also lived through most of those scams, and revisiting them through Marty’s eyes is a productive—and entertaining—way to understand how we got to this moment, and how we can interrupt the cycle of enshittification that has snatched technological defeat from every near-victory.\n\nAre there important underlying similarities between Martin and Brooks Palazzo, the main character from The Lost Cause? Are there inspirations or perhaps interesting intentions behind these two people?\n\nNo one in the history of the human race has ever known what anyone else was thinking, much less what it was like to be someone else. Every character a writer creates can only be a reflection of that writer, because that’s the only person it could reflect. So all of my characters are necessarily related in the sense that they all represent my own projections of how other people must feel.\n\nMarty and Brooks are both romantics, though Marty has had some of the innocence beaten out of him over the years. As a young man, Marty dreamed of a world transformed for the better by idealistic young people like him; Brooks is living in a world where that’s genuinely happening. Both struggled with the conservative, angry, authoritarian men who raised them. Both became Californians and never left. I’m sure there are other similarities.\n\nBoth books take on important issues, but they also deliver tension and plot. In terms of writing craft, what is the key to good pacing and tension, even while developing characters and discussing heavier topics?\n\nAs mentioned above, I think—to quote Goldman—no one knows anything about plot. We know what is hard to do, plotwise (e.g. long, meandering expository sections), but no one has a formula for reliably producing great plots.\n\nBut that said, there’s a general method that works often enough, which AJ Budrys called “The seven-point plot outline.” He taught it to Kris Rusch and Dean Smith at Writers of the Future, and they taught it to me at Clarion in 1992. It goes like this:\n\n1. A person\n\n2. In a place\n\n3. With a problem\n\n(all ideally in the opening sentence)\n\n4. Tries intelligently to solve that problem, and fails through no fault of their own,\n\n5. Things get worse, creating a new problem (GOTO 4)\n\n(repeat try/fail/heightened stakes until you run out of ways for things to get worse; this is the)\n\n6. Climax\n\n7. Denouement (tie up loose ends here)\n\nThis immediately attracts the reader’s attention, works hard to create the illusion that the imaginary person with the made up problem matters enough to continue paying attention to, and pretty much guarantees rising tension, which escalates until a climax is reached.\n\nWhat is most important to you about The Bezzle, what is at the heart of the story?\n\nThe heart of The Bezzle is the tension between technology as an unstoppable force for liberation and technology as an unimaginably ghastly force for oppression and control. The captive audience of prisoners being subjected to technological exploitation are the first stage in the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve, whereby the worst technological ideas as first imposed on the people with the least wherewithal and social capital, then slowly progressed up the privilege gradient, smoothed over by smashing it repeatedly into prisoners, then mental patients, then immigrants, then kids, then blue collar workers, then air travelers, then white collar workers. Twenty years ago, if you ate dinner under a CCTV camera it was because you were in a supermax prison. Today, it’s because you shelled out thousands of dollars to Apple, Google, Facebook, or Amazon for a “smart home” device.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the next book in the series?\n\nPicks and Shovels (Tor [Canada/US]/Head of Zeus [UK/commonwealth, Jan 2025]) is the third Marty Hench book, and chronologically the first (the series goes back in time). It tells Marty Hench’s origin story as an MIT dropout who becomes a CPA, follows his hacker roommate out to the Bay Area in search of glory, falls in love with a Unix programmer he meets at a Dead Kennedys show, and gets his first gig: working for Three Wise Men. 3WM is a PC company owned by a Mormon bishop, a Catholic priest, and an orthodox rabbi. It is also—as Marty swiftly discovers—a predatory scam that rips off faith groups. When Marty figures out he’s working for the bad guys, he switches sides, going to work for three women who defected from the company to start a rival business: a nun who’s become involved with the liberation theology movement that is resisting the Central American dirty wars; an orthodox woman who was rejected by her family for being a lesbian; and a Mormon woman who quit the faith over the LDS’s opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nYou also recently published The Internet Con, a nonfiction book which is “the disassembly manual we need to take back our internet.” Who is this book for, who are the folks that need to read this, and why?\n\nThe Internet Con distills my twenty-plus years of fighting for a free, fair and open internet. It reveals and dissects the policy choices that transformed the internet into “five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four” (to quote Tom Eastman), analyzes the way that tech firms maintain a grip on our technology, and presents a shovel-ready plan to reclaim our technological self-determination. It isn’t just a counsel of despair, it’s a manual for getting a better future and a new, good internet that is a worthy successor to the old, good internet, a platform from which we can fight all the crucial struggles of the coming century: addressing the climate emergency, ending discrimination based on race, gender, and identity, and dismantling the oligarchy that emerged through the failed neoliberal experiment of the past forty years.\n\nWhat else are you working on, what do you have coming up that you’d like Clarkesworld readers to know about?\n\nI wrote NINE books during lockdown. Three are out already (Chokepoint Capitalism, Red Team Blues, The Internet Con), and The Lost Cause and The Bezzle are four and five. The remainder—all coming out between now and the end of 2025 or so—are: a graphic novel adaptation of my novella Unauthorized Bread, a Little Brother short story collection, Picks and Shovels, and a collection of my columns from Medium."
