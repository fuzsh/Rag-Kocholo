EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures has acquired the feature rights to Little Brother, the New York Times bestselling novel by Cory Doctorow, for Angry Film producers Don Murphy and Susan Montford. The plan is to create a successful, reality-based YA franchise for the studio with the book that follows a teenage Edward Snowden-type of character who, after a terrorist attack on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, finds himself wrongfully pursued by a corrupt Department of Homeland Security agent. Using technological tricks that are very much based in reality, he must elude capture while exposing the truth. Angry Films’ VP Cory Kaplan will co-produce.

Murphy, of course, was the originating producer of the Transformers franchise, which started at DreamWorks and has been the bread and butter for Paramount. The franchise has made $3.77 billion at the worldwide box office to date. Nice.

Doctorow is a well known writer of science fiction and fantasy for both adults and young adults. He is one of the co-owners and moderators of popular blog site BoingBoing.net.

Paramount’s Allison Small brought in the project to the studio and Jon Graham and Gabriele Canton will shepherd the project as they endeavor to start a new franchise. Doctorow has already written and published one book sequel to Little Brother called Homeland, in what is expected to be a series of books.
