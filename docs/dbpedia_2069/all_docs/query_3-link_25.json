Other steps towards sainthood are declarations of Venerable, Blessed and Canonisation.\n\nThe proclamation ordaining the German-born nun was made by Kannur Archbishop Varghese Chakalakal at a function attended by the faithful in Snahnikethan chapel, adjacent to the Sabha at Pattuvam near Taliparamba here last evening.\n\nBorn on June 14, 1924, Mother Petra, who took post-graduate degrees in Biology, Zoology, Human Anatomy and Psychology, set up the Sabha on June 1, 1969 after Catholic heads approved her plea to set up a home for the destitutes.\n\nThe Mother died in a road mishap at Kuthuparamba in the district on June 5, 1976.\n\nThe proclamation comes at a time when the Sabha is observing its 41st anniversary and the Mother's 33rd death anniversary.\n\nOn June 9, the Catholic Church had declared Father Antony Thachuparambil, popularly known as 'Missionary of Chelakkara', as 'Servant of God'.\n\nThe declaration was made by Thrissur Archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath at St Mary's Forane Church at Chelakkara near Thrissur."
