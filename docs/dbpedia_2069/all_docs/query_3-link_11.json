        "text": "Thrissur: The Catholic church on Tuesday declared Father Antony Thachuparambil, popularly known as 'Missionary of Chelakkara', as 'Servant of God'.\n\nThe declaration was made by Thrissur Archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath at St Mary's Forane Church in Chelakkara near Thrissur on Tuesday morning.\n\nFather Francis Aloor, spokesman for the Archdiocese, said the Pope's 'bull' (document from Vatican) was read out by the Senior Vicar General Father Raphael Thattil during a high con-celebrated mass led by Thazhath, Archbishop Emeritus, Mar Jacob Thoomkuzhy amid a large gathering of faithful and laymen.\n\nDeclaration of a faithful as 'Servant of God' is the first step for canonisation under the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOther steps towards the sainthood, are declarations of Venerable, Blessed and Canonisation, Aloor said.\n\nFollowing order of 'No-objection' in this regard, the work of the Tribunal for the canonisation of Thachuparambil would be initiated by the Postulator Father Paul Pulicken, he said.\n\nBorn in 1894 at Chalakudy, Thachuparambil had served about three decades since 1930 in Chelakkara, an extremely backward forest area.\n\nHe had made immense contribution for the overall development of Chelakkara, serving all sections of the society irrespective of caste, creed, colour and religion.\n\nThachuparambil has established a school, Balabhavan for orphans and a church in the 1930s. He died on June 9, 1963."
