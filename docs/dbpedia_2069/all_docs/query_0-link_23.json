        "text": "Origin of St. Thomas Christians\n\nAccording to tradition Christianity was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Tamilakam in AD 52 and established Christian communities in different parts of India and died at Mylapur in 72 A. D. Traditionally, he founded seven churches or communities in Kerala; at Kodungalloor, Niranam, Kollam, Chayal, Kottakkavu (North Paravur), Gokkamangalam and Paloor(Chattukulangara).\n\nEast Syrian relationship\n\nFrom early centuries the Church of St. Thomas Christians came into communication with the Christian communities that came to be known as the Church of the East. The Christians of St. Thomas kept their distinctive character especially in Church administration and socio-cultural and ascetic-spiritual life. At least from the 4th century until the end of the 16th century the Bishops of the Church of Malabar were sent from the East Syrian Church, appointed by the Patriarch of the Church of the East. While the bishops originally hailing from Persia who arrived here were placed in charge of liturgy, the administration of the church remained under the control of the local Archdeacon, who was also the head of the local community. Ancient prayers and customs of the Syro-Malabar Christians partially deny their alleged Nestorian connection.\n\nThe bishops who came from the East Syrian Church, were concerned with spiritual matters. Essentially, the Thomas Christians followed three distinct ways of activity in their religious sphere: their liturgy was of the East Syrian Rite: their culture was purely Indian as their origins, they also they had their own style of life.\"The governance of the Church was through Palliyogam, Synod, etc. as was prevalent in Oriental Churches.\n\nArrival of Portuguese in Malabar and formation of Catholic Church in Malankara\n\nThe Portuguese Admiral Vasco da Gama arrived in Calicut on 20 May 1498. When Gama and the Portuguese missionaries arrived they found no Christians in the country except in the Malabar Coast (modern day Kerala). The Christians they found were St. Thomas Christians. The Christians were friendly to Portuguese missionaries at first; there were exchanges of gifts between them, and these groups were delighted at their common faith.\n\nLater, due to certain differences, mainly in the sacraments including liturgy, the relations between the missionaries and local St. Thomas Christians became increasingly strained. Under the Padroado (patronage) agreement with the Holy See the Portuguese missionaries started to interfere in day-to-day operations of the church and things took a turn for the worse. They accused the Indian Christians of heresy and schism (also see: Schism in Christianity); and attempted to introduce the Catholic Roman Rite customs and Latin Church manner of ecclesiastical administration, severing the East Syrian connection. These reforms included secret confession to priests, a change of the Lent starting day from Sunday to Ash Monday, and the introduction of the veneration of Sts. Syril and Gregory instead of Theodorus and Nestorius, as directed by the Portuguese Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes. Together, these changes made the Malankare church more Eastern and Oriental Orthodox than East Syrian churches.\n\nThe Portuguese established a Latin Catholic diocese in Goa (1534) and another in Cochin (1558) with the hope of bringing the St. Thomas Christians under Catholic jurisdiction, misunderstanding and accusing them of Nestorianism. At a Goan Synod held in 1585, it was decided to introduce the Catholic Roman Rite liturgy and practices among St. Thomas Christians. Confessions to priests were introduced. During the Synod of Diamper of 1599, Menezes succeeded in bringing the indigenous church under the Latin Catholic fold and formed a catholic diocese in Malabar. The Malabar church became more Eastern Orthodox and Oriental than East Syrian churches, due to Menezes' directions. He appointed a Catholic bishop in the newly formed Catholic Archdiocese of Angamaly-Kodungallur to govern the St. Thomas Christians. The Portuguese padroado was extended over them. The strife between the Portuguese missionaries and the indigenous Christians and their Mesopotamian prelates was of an ecclesiological and jurisdictional character. Attempts to resist the Latinization process were branded as heretical. Under their Archdeacon, the Thomas Christians resisted, and, consequently, the once united Church in full communion with the East Syrian Patriarch ended up in various denominations. Thus, the Portuguese split the St. Thomas Christian community and brought Catholicism in Malabar.\n\nDivisions among Saint Thomas Christians\n\nA protest took place in 1653 with the Coonan Cross Oath. Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit bishops or Pope of Rome.\n\nRome sent Carmelites in two groups from the Propagation of the Faith to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655. He began to deal directly with the Archdeacon, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of Palliveettil Mar Chandy, Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Mar Thoma I, who had been defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of Cranganore, before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Mar Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church(Jacobites),the Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Mar Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), Syro Malankara Catholic Church have originated.\n\nIn 1665 Mar Gregorios, a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him. Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop Mar Gregorios of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syrian theological and liturgical tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch of Mar Gregorios became known as the Jacobites or Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara,\" the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the Syro Malabar Church from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola(1787) later became Latin churches.e.g.Mathilakom(Pappinivattom),Maliankara,Thuruthipuram etc.One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned Chaldean Syrian Church when an Eastern Syrian rite bishop came to evangelize them in 1701.\n\nRestoration of the Syro-Malabar hierarchy\n\nAfter the split in the church community, the Catholics of the Malabar coast faced an identity crisis and thus some priests and laymen attempted to persuade the hierarchy to improve the identity of the local church and for the appointment of bishops from local priests. To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics Joseph Kariattil and Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar went to Rome in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of Kodungalloor Archdiocese. While journeying home, they stayed in Goa where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at Angamaly. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to Vadayar dodging the invasion of Tippu Sultan. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, Ramapuram.\n\nAfter being under Babylonian Assyrian(Catholic faction of this church is known as Chaldean Catholic church from 1681AD) bishops earlier and under Latin Church Roman Catholic bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896.They were known as Catholic Chaldean Syrians during the period from around 1787(Angamaly Padiyola) to around 1911. They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and Latin Church Catholics in Kerala.They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala. The Indian East Syrian Catholic Hierarchy was restored on 21 December 1923 with Mar Augustine Kandathil as the first Metropolitan and Head of the Church with the name Syro-Malabar.\n\nTime line of events\n\nTime line of events\n\n1 Ancient Era\n\n2 Portuguese Era\n\n3 Era of Divisions\n\n4 Arrival of the Protestants and further splits\n\n5 Era of Self-governance\n\n6 A Sui iuris Church.\n\nSyro-Malabar identity\n\nSyro-Malabar Historian and theologian Fr. Placid Podipara describes it as \"Catholic by faith, Indian by culture & East Syrian/Syriac/Oriental in liturgy.\" Today, the Syro-Malabar Church finds herself as the second-largest Eastern Catholic Church in the world with 4.5 million worldwide.\n\nFaith and communion of Syro-Malabarians\n\nThe St. Thomas Christians got their bishops from the Assyrian Church of the East/Chaldean Church from ca. 300 AD till the end of the sixteenth century, until it was stopped by the Portuguese Roman Catholics (Catholics) in 1597, after the death of Mar Abraham.\n\nLiturgy\n\nAs per the East Syriac tradition, liturgical day of the Syro-Malabar Church starts at sunset (6 p. m.). Also the worshiper has to face the east while worshiping. Not followed after Latinization\n\nAccording to the East Syriac Orthodox tradition which was prevalent before the induction of Catholicism, the following are the seven times of prayer:\n\nRamsha or the Evening Liturgy (6 p. m.)\n\nQuta-a or the Supper Liturgy (9 p. m.)\n\nLelya or the Night Liturgy (12 a. m.)\n\nQala d-Shahra or the Vigil Liturgy (3 a. m.)\n\nSapra or the Morning Liturgy (6 a. m.)\n\nQuta'a or the Third Hour Liturgy (9 a. m.)\n\nEndana or the Noon Liturgy (12 p. m.)\n\nThe Holy Mass, which is called Holy Qurbana in East Syriac Aramaic and means 'Eucharist', is celebrated in its solemn form on Sundays and special occasions. During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\nRestoration of East Syrian liturgy\n\nEast Syrian liturgy has three anaphorae: those of the Holy Apostles (Saints Addai and Mari), Mar Nestorius, and Mar Theodore the Interpreter. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the Epiphany and the feasts of St. John the Baptist and of the Greek Doctors, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from Advent to Palm Sunday. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syrian sources, was approved by Pope Pius XII in 1957 and for the first time on the feast of St. Thomas on July 3, 1962, the vernacular, Malayalam, was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana. Currently they celebrate the Divine Liturgy of Addai and Mari and the Anaphora of Mar Theodre in Malayalam, Syriac, Tamil,Hindi or English.\n\nBesides the Anaphora of Mar Addai and Mari being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Mar Theodore and Anaphora of Mar Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Mar Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it upto 1896) is being used again in Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Mar Theodore and Mar Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Mar Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora. It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.\n\nThe Latinization of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 Ladislaus Zaleski, the Apostolic Delegate to India, requested permission to translate the Roman Pontifical into Syriac. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the East Syrian Rite and West Syrian Rite pontificals. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 Pope Pius XI stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among Eastern Rite Catholics. He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the oriental nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syrian sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several Bible translations into Malayalam.\n\nLiturgical calendar\n\nSyro Malabar Church has its own liturgical year. It is ordered according to the flow of salvation history. It focuses on the historical life of Jesus. There are nine seasons for the liturgical year.

Later, on 27 May 1995, it was shifted to new premises at Mount St. Thomas near Kakkanad, Kochi. The newly constructed curial building was opened on 3 July 1998.\n\nThe administration of the Syro-Malabar Church has executive and judicial roles.
