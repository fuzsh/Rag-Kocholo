Mother Petra, founder of Deena Sevana Sabha, set up for the destitute and unprivileged, has been ordained as a 'Servant of God'.

Declaration of a faithful as 'Servant of God' is the first step for canonisation under the Roman Catholic Church. Other steps towards sainthood are declarations of Venerable, Blessed and Canonisation.

The proclamation ordaining the German-born nun was made by Kannur Archbishop Varghese Chakalakal at a function attended by the faithful in Snahnikethan chapel, adjacent to the Sabha at Pattuvam near Taliparamba here last evening.

Born on June 14, 1924, Mother Petra, who took post-graduate degrees in Biology, Zoology, Human Anatomy and Psychology, set up the Sabha on June 1, 1969 after Catholic heads approved her plea to set up a home for the destitutes.

The Mother died in a road mishap at Kuthuparamba in the district on June 5, 1976.

The proclamation comes at a time when the Sabha is observing its 41st anniversary and the Mother's 33rd death anniversary.

On June 9, the Catholic Church had declared Father Antony Thachuparambil, popularly known as 'Missionary of Chelakkara', as 'Servant of God'.

The declaration was made by Thrissur Archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath at St Mary's Forane Church at Chelakkara near Thrissur.
