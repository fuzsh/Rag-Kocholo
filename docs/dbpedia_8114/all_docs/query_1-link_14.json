Subsequently he studied architecture in the University of Guayaquil and got the degree of architect with a major in urban planning in 1970.\n\nProfessional life\n\nFor 15 years Vera Arrata worked as architecture professor at the University of Guayaquil. At the same time, he worked as an urban planner at the consulting firm CONSUR.\n\nSince 1976 he works at the Guayasamin Foundation as a leading executive due to his family ties to Oswaldo Guayasamín (Vera Arrata is married to his daughter Saskia). He brought forward the materialisation of the La Capilla del Hombre (\"The Chapel of Man\") and furthermore, the development of painture in Ecuador.\n\nPolitical life\n\nAlready as a student, and partially due to his family upbringing, Alfredo Vera had a big interest for politics and even got to be vice president of the National Students Association (FEUE) in Guayaquil. In addition, he was also a leader of the Movimiento Unión Revolucionaria de Juventudes Ecuatorianas, a leftwing revolucionary student association. He paid this with liberty and exile: In 1963 he left Ecuador and went to other Latin Américan countries, among them Chile and Cuba. The dictatorial regime imprisoned him for a year after returning illegally to Ecuador.\n\nSince 1984 he is a member of the Party of the Democratic Left under which he served in 1986 as congressman for the Province of Guayas and as education minister from 1988 to 1991. In 1992 he served as a member of Congress, in 1998 as a member of the Constituent assembly for Pichincha and as member of Quito's city council. 2008 he served as National Anti-Corruption Secretary under President Rafael Correa. Also during the presidency of Mr. Correa he served at the Ministry of The Interior for almost six months in 2011.\n\nPublications\n\nHistoria de un Triste Banano (1970)\n\nInvestigación Social en la Arquitectura (1974)\n\nEl Lleve de la Perimetral (1987)\n\nEl Contrajuicio (1991)\n\nEnigmas de la Educación (1998)"
