        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nGuayaquil (pronounced [ɡwaʝaˈkil]), officially Santiago de Guayaquil (English: St. James of Guayaquil) (pronounced [sanˈtjaɣo ðe ɣwaʝaˈkil]), is the most populous city in Ecuador, [2] with 2,578,201 people [3] in the metropolitan area. It is also the nation's main port. The city is the capital of Guayas Province and the seat of Guayaquil canton.\n\nGuayaquil is on the west bank of the Guayas River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Guayaquil.\n\nHistory[]\n\nGuayaquil was founded on July 25, 1538[4] with the name Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil (Most Noble and Most Loyal City of St. James of Guayaquil) by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Orellana. Even before it was founded by the Spanish, it already existed as a native village.\n\nIn 1687, Guayaquil was attacked and looted by English and French pirates under the command of George d'Hout (English) and Picard and Groniet (Frenchmen). Of the more than 260 pirates, 35 died and 46 were wounded; 75 defenders of the city died and more than 100 were wounded.\n\nIn 1709, the English captains Woodes Rogers, Etienne Courtney, and William Dampier, along with a crew of 110, looted Guayaquil and demanded ransom; however, they suddenly departed without collecting the ransom after an epidemic of yellow fever broke out.\n\nOn October 9, 1820, almost without bloodshed, a group of civilians, supported by soldiers from the \"Granaderos de Reserva\", a battalion quartered in Guayaquil, overwhelmed the resistance of the Royalist guards and arrested the Spanish authorities. Guayaquil declared independence from Spain, becoming Provincia Libre de Guayaquil, and José Joaquín de Olmedo was named Jefe Civil (Civilian Chief) of Guayaquil.\n\nOn July 26, 1822, José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar held a famous conference in Guayaquil to plan the future of the independent South America.\n\nIn 1829, the city was invaded by the Peruvian Army, which occupied it for seven months.\n\nIn 1860, the city was the site of the Battle of Guayaquil, the last of a series of military conflicts between the forces of the Provisional Government, led by Gabriel García Moreno and General Juan José Flores, and the forces of the Supreme Chief of Guayas, General Guillermo Franco, whose government was recognized as possessing sovereignty over the Ecuadorian territory by Peruvian president Ramón Castilla.\n\nLarge portions of the city were destroyed by a major fire in 1896.[5]\n\nOn July 8, 1898, the Guayaquil City Hall \"Muy Ilustre Municipalidad de Guayaquil\" officially recognized the anthem written by José Joaquín de Olmedo in 1821, with the music composed by Ana Villamil Ycaza in 1895, as the \"Himno al 9 de Octubre\" Canción al Nueve de Octubre, most widely known now as the \"Himno a Guayaquil\" (Guayaquil Anthem).\n\nEconomy[]\n\nGuayaquileños' main sources of income are: formal and informal trade, business, agriculture and aquaculture. Most commerce consists of small and medium businesses, adding an important informal economy occupation that gives thousands of guayaquileños employment.[6]\n\nThe Port of Guayaquil is Ecuador's most important commercial port; most international import and export merchandise passes through the Gulf of Guayaquil. As the largest city in the country, most industries are located either in the city or its peripheral areas.\n\nOngoing projects seek urban regeneration as a principal objective of the growth of the city's commercial districts, as the increase of capital produces income. These projects in the city driven by the recent mayors have achieved this goal after investing large sums of money. The current municipal administration aims to convert Guayaquil into a place for first-class international tourism and multinational businesses.[7]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nGuayaquil's current mayor is Jaime Nebot. He began a campaign of construction projects for the city in the early 2000s to attract tourism, that included the \"urban regeneration\" plan which reconstructed the city's main tourist streets' sidewalks and upgraded the city's chaotic transit system with multiple infrastructure projects (speedways, bridges, overhead passages, tunnels, etc.).\n\nIn August 2006, the city's first rapid transit bus system, Metrovia, opened to provide a quicker, high-capacity service. One of the main projects was called Malecón 2000 [maleˈkon doz ˈmil], the renovation of the waterfront promenade (malecón) along the Guayas River. Another project was the creation of the Nuevo Parque Histórico, a park in a housing development area that is called Entre Ríos because it lies between the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers (which merge to form the Guayas River), in a mangrove wetland area. The park cost the city about 7 million dollars.\n\nIn 2013, the national government led by Rafael Correa built two pedestrian bridges connecting downtown Guayaquil, Santay Island, and the town of Durán, to allow people to make ecotourism trips on a same-day return basis. The two bridges were a big addition to the Guayas River scenery.\n\nGeography[]\n\nGuayaquil is the nation's largest city and the capital of Guayas Province. It is on the Guayas River about 40 miles (60 km) north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, near the Equator.\n\nGuayaquil is constantly facing tsunami and major earthquake threats due to its soil stratigraphy and location near the Gulf of Guayaquil and the south of North-Andean subduction zone.[8] The city can be easily damaged by earthquake as its weak and compressible soil stratigraphy is composed of deep soft sediments over hard rocks and deposits in a brackish environment. Also, the city itself is strongly affected by the subduction of the active Ecuadorian margin, an intraplate region where active faults locate; and the Guayaquil-Babahoyo strike-slip fault system, formed as the North Andean Block drifts northward.[9] The tsunami threat is caused by the nearby Gulf of Guayaquil which also is one of the major locations on the Earth where earthquakes tend to happen all the time. It has complex tectonic features such as the Posorja and the Jambeli –two major east-west trending detachment systems; the Puna-Santa Clara northeast-southwest trending fault system; and the Domito north-south trending fault system; that have developed since the Pleistocene times. Tsunami threats are only predicted for coastal farming zones, not the main populated areas.[10][11]\n\nGuayaquil city sectors[]\n\nGuayaquil City Territorial Organization\n\nNumber of the sector in reference with the City Map # Sectors # Sectors # Sectors 1 9 de Octubre Este 25 Febres Cordero 49 Prosperina 2 9 de Octubre Oeste 26 Floresta 50 Puerto Azul Norte 3 Abel Gilbert 27 La Florida 51 Puerto Azul Sur 4 Acuarela 28 García Moreno 52 Puerto Lisa 5 Los Álamos 29 Garzota 53 Quinto Guayas Este 6 Alborada Este 30 Guangala 54 Quinto Guayas Oeste 7 Alborada Oeste 31 Guasmo Este 55 Río Guayas 8 Los Almendros 32 Guasmo Oeste 56 Roca 9 Las Américas 33 Huancavilca 57 Rocafuerte 10 Atarazana 34 Isla Trinitaria 58 La Saiba 11 Ayacucho 35 Kennedy 59 Samanes 12 Bastión Popular 36 Letamendi 60 San Eduardo 13 Batallón del Suburbio 37 Luz del Guayas 61 Los Sauces 14 Bellavista 38 Mapasingue 62 Simón Bolívar 15 Bolívar 39 Miraflores 63 Sopeña 16 Los Ceibos 40 Monte Bello 64 Sucre 17 Centenario 41 Olmedo 65 Tarqui 18 Cerro del Carmen 42 Las Orquídeas Este 66 Unión 19 Cóndor 43 Las Orquídeas Oeste 67 Urdenor 20 Cuba 44 Paraíso 68 Urdaneta 21 Del Astillero 45 Pascuales 69 Urdesa 22 Estero Salado 46 Pedro Carbo 70 Los Vergeles 23 Los Esteros 47 Las Peñas 71 Ximena 24 La FAE 48 La Pradera 72 Mirador Norte\n\nHere you can find the list of Neighborhoods and Parishes of Guayaquil\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical Populations Guayaquil City\n\nCompared with Guayas Province, Canton of Guayaquil, and Guayaquil City[12] Census Guayas Province Canton of Guayaquil Guayaquil City 1950 582,144 331,942 258,966 1962 979,223 567,895 510,804 1974 1,512,333 907,013 823,219 1982 2,038,454 1,328,005 1,199,344 1990 2,515,146 1,570,396 1,508,444 2001 4,509,034 2,148,779 1,985,379 Source: Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos\n\nPercentage Population Growth of Guayaquil City\n\nCompared with Guayas Province, Canton of Guayaquil, and Guayaquil City.[12] Census Guayas Province Canton of Guayaquil Guayaquil City 1950–1962 4.34% 4.49% 5.67% 1962–1974 3.77% 4.06% 4.14% 1974–1982 3.52% 4.50% 4.44% 1982–1990 2.63% 2.10% 2.87% 1990–2001 2.49% 2.38% 2.50% Source: Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos\n\nClimate[]\n\nGuayaquil features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw). Between January and April, the climate is hot and humid with heavy rainfall, especially during El Niño years when it increases dramatically and flooding usually occurs. The rest of the year (from May through December), however, rainfall is minimal due to the cooling influence of the Humboldt Current, with usually cloudy mornings and afternoons, and evening breezes. Guayaquil, along with most of the coastal region, was impacted by the April 16, 2016 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude. A bridge that was above a major artery, Avenida de las Americas, collapsed in the early evening of April 16, killing two people.\n\nClimate data for Guayaquil Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 37.2\n\n(99.0) 35.4\n\n(95.7) 37.3\n\n(99.1) 35.8\n\n(96.4) 35.2\n\n(95.4) 35.0\n\n(95.0) 34.1\n\n(93.4) 34.7\n\n(94.5) 34.4\n\n(93.9) 35.1\n\n(95.2) 35.4\n\n(95.7) 36.7\n\n(98.1) 37.3\n\n(99.1) Average high °C (°F) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 32.2\n\n(90.0) 32.0\n\n(89.6) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 29.8\n\n(85.6) 29.1\n\n(84.4) 29.7\n\n(85.5) 30.5\n\n(86.9) 30.2\n\n(86.4) 31.1\n\n(88.0) 31.8\n\n(89.2) 30.8\n\n(87.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 27.1\n\n(80.8) 27.3\n\n(81.1) 28.0\n\n(82.4) 27.8\n\n(82.0) 26.9\n\n(80.4) 25.7\n\n(78.3) 25.0\n\n(77.0) 25.2\n\n(77.4) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.6\n\n(78.1) 26.2\n\n(79.2) 27.1\n\n(80.8) 26.5\n\n(79.7) Average low °C (°F) 23.0\n\n(73.4) 23.4\n\n(74.1) 23.7\n\n(74.7) 23.5\n\n(74.3) 22.6\n\n(72.7) 21.5\n\n(70.7) 20.8\n\n(69.4) 20.7\n\n(69.3) 20.5\n\n(68.9) 20.9\n\n(69.6) 21.3\n\n(70.3) 22.4\n\n(72.3) 22.0\n\n(71.6) Record low °C (°F) 20.0\n\n(68.0) 15.8\n\n(60.4) 19.9\n\n(67.8) 19.4\n\n(66.9) 18.5\n\n(65.3) 17.6\n\n(63.7) 17.0\n\n(62.6) 17.2\n\n(63.0) 17.2\n\n(63.0) 17.8\n\n(64.0) 17.0\n\n(62.6) 18.0\n\n(64.4) 15.8\n\n(60.4) Precipitation mm (inches) 200.7\n\n(7.902) 332.0\n\n(13.071) 315.7\n\n(12.429) 207.7\n\n(8.177) 62.6\n\n(2.465) 34.0\n\n(1.339) 15.6\n\n(0.614) 1.2\n\n(0.047) 1.5\n\n(0.059) 5.6\n\n(0.22) 29.1\n\n(1.146) 68.0\n\n(2.677) 1,263.2\n\n(49.732) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 12 14 15 10 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 2 59 Source #1: World Meteorological Organization[13] Source #2: NOAA[14]\n\nFood[]\n\nTypical Guayaquil cuisine includes mostly seafood dishes such as encebollado and ceviche. The most traditional dish of Guayaquil is Arroz con Menestra y Carne Asada (rice with lentils and grilled beef).[15] Churrasco is also a staple food of Guayaquil.\n\nDuring breakfast, Patacones and Bolon de Verde (fried plantain with cheese mashed and given a rounded shape) play a big role. Pan de yuca is a typical snack in Guayaquil. Local cuisine is heavily influenced by the diversity of Guayaquil's ethnic groups which includes Italian, Spanish and West African origins.\n\nNotable people[]\n\nArtists[]\n\nEcuador is known for its artists and its place in art history.
