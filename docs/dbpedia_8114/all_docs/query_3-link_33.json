        "text": "Short description: City of Ecuador\n\nGuayaquil (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡwaʝaˈkil] ( ); Quechua: Wayakil), officially Santiago de Guayaquil, is the largest city in Ecuador and also the nation's economic capital and main port. The city is the capital of Guayas Province and the seat of Guayaquil Canton. The city is located on the west bank of the Guayas River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Guayaquil.\n\nName\n\nThe origin of the name of the city of Santiago de Guayaquil has been much discussed, although historians agree that it is pre-Hispanic. Since the founding of the city in 1534, it is linked to the name of Santiago in memory of its patron saint, Santiago, apostle of Christ, who is also patron saint of several other Spanish American colonial cities, such as Santiago de Chile, as he is of Spain itself.[3]\n\nOne of the theories, based on a romantic legend, transmitted orally from one generation to another, attributes the origin of the name Guayaquil to the joining of the name of a leader named Guayas and of his wife Quil, symbols of the local resistance that—according to local tradition—chose to fight to the death (and as a final act, set fire to the town), rather than surrender to the Spanish conquerors.[4]\n\nThe existence of a town with a name similar to Guayaquil, located near the city of Durán (Autopista Durán-Boliche km. 23), has brought investigations by archeologists and historians, who agree that the town, when it was conquered, was ruled by a man named Guayaquile.[5] What was not decided was whether the name was given by the man to the town, or the town to the man. But the researcher Ángel Véliz Mendoza, in his book on the man Guayaquile, states that there are at least seven references to the toponym in pre-1543 documents.[6] It is believed that the name Guayaquil is taken from the population's final home, in lands of the chief Guayaquile. This region was occupied by the \"chonos\" people whose archeological name is (in Spanish) Cultura Milagro-Quevedo.[5]\n\nAfter several location changes and fires, the city was finally founded in 1547, and named the \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil\" (\"Very noble and very loyal city of Santiago de Guayaquil\"). After the city's independence in 1820, the words \"very noble and very loyal\" disappeared as the city was no longer part of the Spanish Empire. Today, the official name of Santiago de Guayaquil is seldom used outside of official contexts.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\n\nGuayaquil was founded on 25 July 1538[8] by Spanish conqueror Francisco de Orellana in the location of a native village and given the name Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil (\"Most Noble and Most Loyal City of Santiago de Guayaquil\").[9]\n\nOn 20 April 1687, Guayaquil was attacked and looted by English and French pirates under the command of George d'Hout (English) and Picard and Groniet (French).[10] Of more than 260 pirates, 35 were killed and 46 were wounded; 75 defenders of the city died and more than 100 were wounded.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1709, English captains including Woodes Rogers and William Dampier, along with a crew of 110, looted Guayaquil and demanded ransom; however, they departed suddenly and without collecting the ransom after an epidemic of yellow fever broke out.[citation needed]\n\nIn colonial times Guayaquil was the chief Spanish shipyard in the Pacific, although some navigators considered that Valdivia (now in Chile) had better conditions.[11][12]\n\nGuayaquil was a stopover point in the commerce between Asia and Latin America conducted by Philippines-based Manila galleons, which had links to Acapulco in Mexico and terminated with a node in Callao, Peru.[13]\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, the majority of slaves in the region were located in Guayaquil, where their life and work were conditioned by a practice called jornal. The owners were in charge but the jornalado slaves had \"considerable independence\"[14] in exchange for paying their owners a fee (the jornal) every day. Slaves like María Chiquinquirá, local hero because she successfully went to court in 1794 to argue her freedom, would work inside urban homes. Many slaves worked alongside free workers in the shipyards. By the turn of the nineteenth century, slaves had fought for their freedom in increasing numbers, and together formed a social group known as the plebe.[14]\n\nOn 9 October 1820, almost without bloodshed, a group of civilians, supported by soldiers from the \"Granaderos de Reserva\" battalion quartered in Guayaquil, led by the Peruvian Colonel Gregorio Escobedo, overwhelmed the resistance of the Royalist guards and arrested the Spanish authorities. Guayaquil declared independence from Spain, becoming the \"Provincia Libre de Guayaquil\", and José Joaquín de Olmedo was named Jefe Civil of Guayaquil.\n\nDeparting from Guayaquil, General Antonio José de Sucre, sent by Simón Bolivar and supported by a division promised by José de San Martín, led the allied independence army in the Battle of Pichincha that sealed the independence of the Gran Colombia and also what would become the future Republic of Ecuador.[citation needed]\n\nOn 26 July 1822, generals José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar held a meeting in Guayaquil to plan how to the complete the independence of Perú and with it all of Spanish South America. In 1829, the city was invaded by the Peruvian Army, which occupied it for seven months.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1860, the city was the site of the Battle of Guayaquil, the last of a series of military conflicts between the forces of the Provisional Government, led by Gabriel García Moreno and General Juan José Flores, and the forces of the Supreme Chief of Guayas, General Guillermo Franco, whose government was recognized as possessing sovereignty over the Ecuadorian territory by Peruvian president Ramón Castilla. Moreno's forces were victorious, countering Peruvian influence over Ecuador.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1896, large portions of the city were destroyed by a fire.[15]\n\nOn 8 July 1898, the Guayaquil City Hall Muy Ilustre Municipalidad de Guayaquil officially recognized the anthem written by José Joaquín de Olmedo in 1821, with the music composed by Ana Villamil Ycaza in 1895, as the Himno al 9 de Octubre or Canción al Nueve de Octubre, most widely known now as the Himno a Guayaquil (Guayaquil Anthem).\n\nIn 1922, workers in the city went on a general strike lasting three days, ending after at least 300 people were killed by military and police.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2020, the city was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Its medical and mortuary services were overwhelmed to the point where bodies lay in the streets.[16] Almost 6,000 more deaths were recorded in the first two weeks of April than the average for the same period in other years.[17]\n\nEconomy\n\nGuayaquileños' main sources of income are formal and informal trade, business, agriculture and aquaculture. Most commerce consists of small and medium businesses, adding an important informal economy occupation that gives thousands of guayaquileños employment.[18]\n\nThe Port of Guayaquil is Ecuador's most important commercial port; most international import and export merchandise passes through the Gulf of Guayaquil. As the largest city in the country,[19] most industries are located either in the city or its peripheral areas.\n\nGovernment\n\n(As of 2020) Guayaquil's mayor was Cynthia Viteri, the second elected female mayor in the city's history, the first being Elsa Bucaram in 1988. The previous mayor, Jaime Nebot, endorsed her. A campaign of construction projects for the city began in the early 2000s to attract tourism. The \"urban regeneration\" plan reconstructed the city's main tourist streets' sidewalks and upgraded the city's chaotic transit system with multiple infrastructure projects (speedways, bridges, overhead passages, tunnels, etc.).[20]\n\nIn August 2006, the city's first rapid transit bus system, Metrovía, opened to provide a quicker, high-capacity service. One of the main projects was called Malecón 2000 [maleˈkon dos ˈmil], the renovation of the waterfront promenade (malecón) along the Guayas River. Another project was the creation of the Nuevo Parque Histórico, a park in a housing development area that is called Entre Ríos because it lies between the Daule and Babahoyo rivers (which merge to form the Guayas River) in a mangrove wetland area. The park cost the city about US$7 million.\n\nIn 2013, the national government led by Rafael Correa built two pedestrian bridges connecting downtown Guayaquil, Santay Island, and the town of Durán, to allow people to make ecotourism trips and return the same day.\n\nGeography\n\nGuayaquil is the nation's second largest city[21] and the capital of Guayas Province. It is on the Guayas River about 60 km (40 mi) north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, near the Equator.\n\nGuayaquil faces major earthquake threats due to its soil stratigraphy and location on the ring of fire and the south of the North-Andean subduction zone.[22]\n\nThe city can be easily damaged by earthquakes as its weak and compressible soil is composed of deep soft sediments over hard rocks and deposits in a brackish environment. Also, the city itself is strongly affected by the subduction of the active Ecuadorian margin, an intraplate region where active faults locate; and the Guayaquil-Babahoyo strike-slip fault system, formed as the North Andean Block drifts northward.[23]\n\nThe tsunami threat is caused by the nearby Gulf of Guayaquil which also is one of the major locations on the Earth where earthquakes tend to happen all the time. It has complex tectonic features such as the Posorja and the Jambeli – two major east–west trending detachment systems; the Puna-Santa Clara northeast-southwest trending fault system; and the Domito north-south trending fault system; that have developed since the Pleistocene times. Tsunami threats are only predicted for coastal farming zones, not the main populated areas.[24][25]\n\nGuayaquil, along with most of the coastal region, was impacted by the 16 April 2016 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude. A bridge that was above a major artery, Avenida de las Americas, collapsed in the early evening on that day, killing two people.[citation needed]\n\nClimate\n\nGuayaquil features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw). Between January and April, the climate is hot and humid with heavy rainfall, especially during El Niño years when it increases dramatically and flooding usually occurs. The rest of the year (from May through December), however, rainfall is minimal due to the cooling influence of the Humboldt Current, with usually cloudy mornings and afternoons, and evening breezes.\n\nScript error: No such module \"weather box\".\n\nGuayaquil city sectors\n\nGuayaquil City Territorial Organization\n\nNumber of the sector in reference with the City Map # Sectors # Sectors # Sectors 1 9 de Octubre Este 25 Febres Cordero 49 Prosperina 2 9 de Octubre Oeste 26 Floresta 50 Puerto Azul Norte 3 Abel Gilbert 27 La Florida 51 Puerto Azul Sur 4 Acuarela 28 García Moreno 52 Puerto Lisa 5 Los Álamos 29 Garzota 53 Quinto Guayas Este 6 Alborada Este 30 Guangala 54 Quinto Guayas Oeste 7 Alborada Oeste 31 Guasmo Este 55 Río Guayas 8 Los Almendros 32 Guasmo Oeste 56 Roca 9 Las Américas 33 Huancavilca 57 Rocafuerte 10 Atarazana 34 Isla Trinitaria 58 La Saiba 11 Ayacucho 35 Kennedy 59 Samanes 12 Bastión Popular 36 Letamendi 60 San Eduardo 13 Batallón del Suburbio 37 Luz del Guayas 61 Los Sauces 14 Bellavista 38 Mapasingue 62 Simón Bolívar 15 Bolívar 39 Miraflores 63 Sopeña 16 Los Ceibos 40 Monte Bello 64 Sucre 17 Centenario 41 Olmedo 65 Tarqui 18 Cerro del Carmen 42 Las Orquídeas Este 66 Unión 19 Cóndor 43 Las Orquídeas Oeste 67 Urdenor 20 Cuba 44 Paraíso 68 Urdaneta 21 Del Astillero 45 Pascuales 69 Urdesa 22 Estero Salado 46 Pedro Carbo 70 Los Vergeles 23 Los Esteros 47 Las Peñas 71 Ximena 24 La FAE 48 La Pradera 72 Mirador Norte\n\nHere you can find the list of Neighborhoods and Parishes of Guayaquil\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical Populations Guayaquil City\n\nCompared with Guayas Province, Canton of Guayaquil, and Guayaquil City[28] Census Guayas Province Canton of Guayaquil Guayaquil City 1950 582.144 331.942 258.966 1962 979.223 567.895 510.804 1974 1,512,333 907.013 823.219 1982 2.038.454 1.328.005 1.199.344 1990 2,515,146 1,570,396 1,508,444 2001 3,309,034 2,039,781 1,985,379 2010 3,645,483 2,350,915 2,291,158 Source: Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos\n\nPercentage Population Growth of Guayaquil City\n\nCompared with Guayas Province, Canton of Guayaquil, and Guayaquil City.[28] Census Guayas Province Canton of Guayaquil Guayaquil City 1950–1962 4.34% 4.49% 5.67% 1962–1974 3.77% 4.06% 4.14% 1974–1982 3.52% 4.50% 4.44% 1982–1990 2.63% 2.10% 2.87% 1990–2001 2.49% 2.38% 2.50% 2001–2010 1.12% 1.69% 1.71% Source: Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos\n\nFood\n\nTypical Guayaquil cuisine includes mostly seafood dishes such as encebollado, ceviche, cazuela, and encocado (shrimp or tuna with a coconut sauce and rice).\n\nDuring breakfast, patacones and bolon (fried plantain with cheese mashed and given a rounded shape) play a big role. These plantain dishes are often accompanied with bistec de carne or encebollado de pescado.\n\nAnother prominent breakfast dish are empanadas \"de viento\" made with wheat flour and stretchy cheese or empanadas \"de verde\" plantain based with mozzarella cheese.\n\nPan de yuca similar to pão de queijo usually served with \"yogur persa\" is a typical snack in Guayaquil. With the rise in middle eastern migration, shawarma shops dot the city.\n\nChifa or Chinese-Ecuadorian dishes like arroz chaufa, tallarin saltado, and sopa Fui Chi Fu are common fast food options.\n\nSome other original dishes of Guayaquil are the plantain ball soup (based on peanuts and green plantains creating a green plantain ball filled with meat and other ingredients). Bollo, analogous to hallaca, is another typical dish of this city that also the main ingredient is the green plantain and seafood. Just to mention others are the biche, sango de mariscos, and arroz con pescado frito (rice with fried fish)\n\nArroz con menestra y carne asada (rice with stew and roast meat), churrasco, Guatita, Caldo de mondongo, Humitas, Maduro lampriado, Maduro con queso, Tripita, are some more dishes included in the great and diverse gastronomy of the city.\n\nNotable people\n\nArts and literature\n\nDaniela Alcívar Bellolio (b. 1982, Guayaquil)\n\nFélix Arauz (b. 1935, Guayaquil)\n\nTheo Constanté (1934–2014, Guayaquil)\n\nJosé de la Cuadra (1903, Guayaquil – d. 1941, Guayaquil)\n\nAlfredo Pareja Diezcanseco (1908, Guayaquil – d. 1993, Quito)\n\nCarmen Febres-Cordero de Ballén (b. 1829, Guayaquil – d. 1893, Valparaíso)\n\nAraceli Gilbert (b. 1913, Guayaquil – d. 1993, Quito)\n\nEnrique Gil Gilbert (1912, Guayaquil – d. 1973, Guayaquil)\n\nJulio Jaramillo (b. 1935, Guayaquil – d. 1978, Guayaquil)*\n\nJoaquín Gallegos Lara (b. 1909, Guayaquil – d. 1947, Guayaquil)\n\nNuma Pompilio Llona (b. 1832, Guayaquil – d. 1907, Guayaquil)\n\nDemetrio Aguilera Malta (b. 1909, Guayaquil – d. 1981, Mexico)\n\nLuis Miranda (b. 1932, Guayaquil)\n\nLuis Molinari (b. 1929, Guayaquil)\n\nElisa Ortiz de Aulestia (b. 1909, Guayaquil – 1991)\n\nXavier Blum Pinto (b. 1957, Guayaquil)\n\nJosé Martínez Queirolo (b. 1931, Guayaquil – d. 2008, Guayaquil)\n\nVíctor Manuel Rendón (b. 1859, Guayaquil – d. 1940, Guayaquil)\n\nEnrique Tábara (b. 1930, Guayaquil)\n\nJorge Velarde (b. 1960, Guayaquil)\n\nJuan Villafuerte (b. 1945, Guayaquil – d. 1977, Barcelona, Spain)\n\nEugenia Viteri (b. 1928, Guayaquil)\n\nOthers\n\nOlga Álava, Miss Ecuador Earth 2011, Miss Earth 2011\n\nNoralma Vera Arrata, ballerina and choreographer\n\nFrederick Ashton, British choreographer and dancer\n\nGeovanni Camacho, football player\n\nMaría Elisa Camargo, actress\n\nDanilo Carrera, actor and model\n\nFernanda Cornejo, fashion model and Miss International 2011\n\nFelipe Caicedo, footballer\n\nMaría Capovilla, oldest person\n\nJorge Delgado, swimmer\n\nBeatriz Parra Durango, opera singer\n\nJenny Estrada, writer\n\nJorge Perrone Galarza, politician\n\nKarina Galvez, poet[29]\n\nGerardo, rapper\n\nAndrés Gómez, tennis player\n\nCatalina de Jesús Herrera, nun and writer\n\nMike Judge, American animator and television writer\n\nGuillermo Lasso, former President of Ecuador\n\nRita Lecumberri, writer\n\nDemetrio Aguilera Malta, writer\n\nRoberto Manrique, actor\n\nDebbie Mucarsel-Powell, American politician\n\nFrancisco Nazareno, footballer\n\nAdalberto Ortiz, poet\n\nAlbert Paulsen, actor\n\nJoao Plata, footballer\n\nJorge Saade, violinist\n\nHugo Savinovich, wrestler\n\nPancho Segura, tennis player\n\nMaría del Tránsito Sorroza, midwife and formerly enslaved woman\n\nJan Topić, businessman\n\nBenjamin Urrutia, academic\n\nPedro Jorge Vera, writer\n\nAlex Jimbo Viteri, violinist\n\nRosa Borja de Ycaza, writer\n\nPresley Norton Yoder, archeologist\n\nEducation\n\nBiblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil (Municipal Library of Guayaquil) serves as the public library of Guayaquil.[30] The city has several universities, including the University of Guayaquil (founded in 1867), the Universidad Catolica de Santiago de Guayaquil, the Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral (ESPOL), and the Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo.\n\nReligion\n\nThe largest religion in Guayaquil is Christianity.\n\nSports\n\nThere are two major association football clubs; the Barcelona Sporting Club and the Club Sport Emelec. Each club has its own stadium; the Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha is the home of the \"Barcelonistas\" while the Estadio George Capwell is the home of the \"Emelecistas\". These two teams have a long history of rivalry in Guayaquil and when these two teams play against each other the game is called \"El Clásico del Astillero\".\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Francisco Segura Cano; and Andrés Gómez and Nicolás Lapentti, Ecuador's two most successful tennis players, now both retired. The \"Abierto de Tenis Ciudad de Guayaquil\" is a tennis tournament organised in Guayaquil by Gómez and Luis Morejon, and held annually in November.\n\nAnother major event in the city is the Guayaquil Marathon, which has been held every year on the first weekend of October since 2005. These race is certified by the (AIMS) Association of International Marathons and Distance Races.\n\nThe sports & Ecological Park called Parque Samanes de Guayaquil is a park with courts for soccer, tennis, volleyball, and basketball, two lakes, a soccer stadium and an amphi theatre for open air concerts and events. It is connected to a forest reserve with trails for cycling and walking, as well as installations for climbing and zip-lining.\n\nUniversities\n\nSome of Guayaquil's main universities are:\n\nEscuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral\n\nUniversidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo\n\nUniversity of Guayaquil\n\nUniversidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil\n\nUniversidad Laica Vicente Rocafuerte\n\nUniversidad Casa Grande\n\nUniversidad Tecnológica Ecotec\n\nUniversidad Santa María\n\nBlue Hill College\n\nUniversidad Del Pacífico – Ecuador\n\nInstitute of Graphics Arts and Digital Science\n\nUniversidad Politécnica Salesiana\n\nTransport\n\nGuayaquil is located along national Highway 40 and is near Highway 25.\n\nAmong Guayaquil's major trading points are the seaport, the largest in Ecuador and one of the biggest handlers of shipping on the shores of the Pacific; and José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport.\n\nJosé Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport, though using the same runways, had its passenger terminal completely rebuilt in 2006 and was renamed.
