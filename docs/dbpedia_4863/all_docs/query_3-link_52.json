Henry Apleby of Apleby, Leicestershire 1. Sir Edmond (or Henry) Apleby (a 1268) A. Sir William Apleby i. Sir John Apleby (a 1330, 1353) a. Sir Edmond Apleby We speculate that this was the Sir Edmund Appleby (a c1350) who is shown by Visitation (Derbyshire, 1569+1611, 'Longford of Longford') as father of Margaret & Alice by ... m.

Joyce Curson (dau of Thomas Curson of Croxhall, m2. Thomas Lewes of Manceter) ((1)) Richard Apleby ((A)) issue - Francis (a 1605), Nevill, Barbara (ii) Joan Appleby probably of this generation m. John Langham of Gopsal (a 1448, 1458) (2) Margaret Appleby possibly fits here m. Sir Nicholas Longford of Longford (3) Alice Appleby possibly fits here m. Sir Thomas Stafford B. Alice Apleby m. John Hardwick of Lindley (d before 1309) Foster identifies the arms of the following family as \"Azure, six martlets or, three, two and one\" thereby indicating that it was closely connected to the family above. Bryan Appleby of Clove Lodge m. Ann Skaife of Asby Grange 1. John Appleby of Clove Lodge m. Elizabeth Midleton (dau of Thomas Midleton, sister of Ambrose of Barnard Castle) A. Thomas Appleby of Clove Lodge & Lartington in Romaldkirk (a 1612) m. Dorothy Smithson (dau of Christopher Smithson) i. Ambrose Appleby of Lynton-upon-Ouse (Linton-on=Ouse) (d c1649) m.

(Margaret) Salvein (dau of George Salvein of Croxdell) (1) Margaret Appleby (d 1672) Dugdale shows daughters of this generation as Mary & Margaret (d young). The online copy we have seen of Surtees's work is not clear exactly how the Margaret who married Thomas Maire connected to this family, although it does clearly identify her as \"dau. and sole heir, of Fran(cis)\" so we presume that she was the Margaret mentioned by Dugdale. m.
