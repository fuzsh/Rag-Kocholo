        "text": "Marjorie E. Brooks, 92, of Sulphur Springs entered into Eternity with her Savior on Saturday, May 28, 2022.\n\nShe was born in Bucyrus on September 20, 1929 to the late Wesley and Bessie (Durigg) Yaussy. She was Valedictorian of the Bucyrus High School Class of 1947. Marge became a born-again Christian in her late teens and enrolled at Bob Jones University. While attending BJU, Marge met Jeffrey Brooks of Bluefield, W.Va. while waiting tables together. They found themselves on the same bus as they headed home for the holidays. He got off in Bluefield and she went on to Ohio. They began a two-year courtship and were married on June 6, 1953. After moving to Ohio in 1964, Marge began teaching at Col. Crawford Schools. She earned a master’s degree from Bowling Green State University and had doctoral studies as well. Her teaching career took her from the junior high classroom to elementary school Principal, impacting many students and teachers with her loving, firm, and passionate approach.\n\nMarge was feisty, independent, intelligent, generous, conservative, active, kind, and sassy. She was a woman of devout faith in her Savior and firm in her decisions and convictions. She was an avid reader, gardener, and collector. Marge also was a competitor. She played softball in her younger years, picked a team to support in every sporting event she watched, and she could be heard at some distance while rooting loudly for the Buckeyes and Browns. She and Jeff also had the good fortune to travel to several parts of the North America and Europe. Marge always wanted good things for her grandchildren. She was present at every event or program she could and bought thoughtful gifts for birthdays and holidays. Marge worshiped at Bucyrus Bible Church and remained active as a volunteer for elections, in the courthouse, and for hospice. She looked forward to visiting with fellow retirees and family both near and far.\n\nMarjorie is survived by three children, Bruce (Donna) Brooks of Nova Scotia, Canada and their children, Shannon (Adam) Owens, Christina (Josiah) Mendoza, and Kyle Brooks; Michael (Carla) Brooks of Michigan and their children, Melissa (Steve) Springer, Jordan (Ellen) Brooks, and Tyler Brooks; and Lori (John) Lowman of Ashland and their daughters, Lauren (Oron) Wilcox, Alaina Lowman, Deandra Lowman (fiancée Laura Huthmacher), Shannon (Andrew) Cuffman, Devan (Tyler) Lefever, and Jasmin Love. She also leaves nine great grandchildren and her sisters, Marcele Yaussy, Dorothy Wood, and Vera Swinehart, along with many extended family.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband of 58 years, Jeff Brooks; their son, Eric Brooks; an infant great grandchild, Brooks Wilcox; brother, Harold Yaussy; and sister, Vivian Appleby.\n\nServices for Marge will be held on Wednesday, June 1 at Wise Funeral Service in Bucyrus. Her family will receive friends from 11 am – 12:55 pm and her funeral will begin at 1:00 pm with Pastor David Layton officiating. Burial will follow in Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nMemorial donations can be made payable to Bucyrus Bible Church or a charity of the donor’s choice and given though the funeral home. Memories and photos can be shared on Marge’s Tribute Wall."
