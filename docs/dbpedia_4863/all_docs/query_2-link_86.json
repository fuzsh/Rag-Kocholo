        "text": "More\n\nThe de Applebys of Appleby Magna\n\nLand ownership in Briton was completely revolutionised by William the Conqueror after the Norman Conquest of 1066. From the time of Williams reign, land was held in return for military service within a feudal hierarchical structure under the King. The lord of the manor held his land by knight service through an intermediate tenant-in-chief. Appleby Magna's tenant-in-chief was the Earl Ferrers who lived at Tutbury castle; in return for his land he provided fully mounted and trained knights for the Kings fighting force when required. The knights were his sub-tenants; the de Applebys were appointed as knights and functioned as Lords of the Manor.\n\nThe information preseted below follows only the line from which the Applebys of Bathurst are descended, and does not include other family branches of de Applebys of Appleby Magna. Historical documents from which the information has been drawn are not only sketchy and incomplete, but the details tend to differ greatly from one source to another. As a consequence, our list is given as a general guide with no guarantees.\n\nAppleby Manor\n\nAntekil (Anthony) de Appleby appears to have held the manor at Appleby Magna at a date between 1114 and 1166. A legal document in the Burton Abbey Register shows that the Abbeys half of Appleby Magna was governed by the Abbot of Burton, the other half by Antekil. Although there is no date given for Antekil, the sequence of extracts from the Burton Register appears to put it in the first half of the 12th century. A reference to the latter's 'heir' (son) refers to him as Radulphus (Ralph/Randolph), an old Norse name meaning \"shield of a wolf\". Information about Radulphus has yet to be found.\n\nWilliam de Appleby I is recorded as being the first person to be living at the Manor after Antekil, from about 1166, and had a stone house built, surrounded by a moat. This, however, conflicts with other records that have him being born in 1175. More than likely, the first person to be living at the Manor House was the father of William de Appleby I, the first authentic bearer of the title, Lord of the Manor of Appleby. He appears to have been either Waleran de Beaumont, Count of Meulan, Earl of Worcester (1104-1166), or his son, Waleran de Meulan. Waleran de Beaumont was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth de Vermandois, and the twin brother of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and belonged to one of the greatest Houses of the old Normandy baronage.\n\nWaleran's father, Robert de Beaumont, was a powerful Norman nobleman, and one of the 15 proven Companions of William the Conqueror specifically referred to in surviving documents as having fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 under William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, who was his cousin. Revered as one of the wisest men of his age, he was granted immense land-holdings in England (mainly in the Midlands) by William the Conqueror and by Henry I and was created Earl of Leicester. His service earned him the grant of more than 91 English manors confiscated from the defeated English, as listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, of which Aplleby Magna was one. It stands to reason that the Earl of Leicester would have appointed family members as Lords of the English manors he was granted, and that Walleran de Appleby I would have been one of them.\n\nWaleran's descendants took the name of the lordship as their family name, a common practice with feaudal lords, indicating the locality was named Appleby before Waleran's arrival, and that Appleby was not his family name prior to becoming Lord of the Manor. When his descendants moved to other locations, they kept their Appleby surname but the \"de\" - meaning \"of\" - was dropped, no doubt because they were no longer \"of Appleby\".\n\nWilliam de Appleby I\n\nBorn (1175-1258), Appleby Magna, Leicestershire, England\n\nFather of Sir Walter de Appleby II (1200-1280)\n\nBrother of Roger de Appleby (1196-1222). Roger's son was Geoffrey George de Appleby b. 1225. Roger's daughter, Eva De Appleby (1222-1244), married Robert Touchet (1218-1248) in 1244 in Buglawton, Cheshire, England. Their son was Sir Thomas Touchet (1240-1314), Lord of Ashwell.\n\nWalter de Appleby II\n\nBorn (1200-1280), Appleby Magna, Leicestershire, England\n\nFather of Sir William de Appleby II (1225-1280); Henry de Appleby I\n\nSir William de Appleby II\n\nBorn (1225-1280), Appleby Magna, Leicestershire, England. Died 1280, Appleby Magna.\n\nFather of Sir Henry de Appleby II (b.1250) Brother of Walter de Appleby III, 1200 - 1280, Appleby Magna, Leicestershire, England\n\nSir Henry de Appleby II\n\nBorn (1250-1296), Over Appleby (Appleby Parva), Leicestershire, England\n\nFather of Henry de Appleby III (b. 1275); Lady Alicia Napton (nee Appleby), born 1277, Appleby Magna, Leicestershire. Married Sir Adam Napton (1245 - 1292)."
