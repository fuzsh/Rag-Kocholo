        "text": "BAUGH, Dorothy Margaret Isabel (nee Imison) Gently on the wings of a spring afternoon, Dorothy passed away peacefully in the arms of her loving daughters, April 21st, in her 95th year. Beloved wife of the late John, dearest mother of Elisabeth (Bruce Ross) and Beverley (John Appleby). Treasured \"Gummy\" of John (Sheri), Josh (Melanie), and Heidi Bednar, Emily Lee (Ryan), John and Timothy Appleby. Great-grandmother to Chloe, Matthieu and Toby. Predeceased by her siblings Charles Imison (Muriel), Marjorie Johnson (Jim), Helen (Nell), Dagg (Earl). Dear sister-in-law to Howard Baugh, Beatrice Dawson, and Dorothy Baugh. Remembered with much love as \"dearest Auntie Dot\" by many nieces and nephews. Dorothy was born in Shawville, QC, youngest child of Harry and Olive Imison. Dorothy married John in 1941, and they settled in the Montreal area where they lived for 25 years and raised their family. Dorothy enjoyed her career as a legal secretary and was very active in the Anglican Church. In 1969, she and John moved to Cardinal, ON where Dorothy was secretary at Benson Public School until her retirement in 1979. A move to Morrisburg in 1988 brought time for family, quilting, seniors group and church work. Many thanks to friends and thoughtful staff at Orchard View Living Centre where Dorothy has thrived the past 3 years. She could always be found enjoying the musical afternoons and dancing. Special friend there to Terry, Alda and Andre. Dorothy's sweet smile and wonderful disposition will be remembered by all who have met her. Her delicious pies were second to none. No visitation. Memorial Service at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, 2372 Church Street, North Gower on Saturday, April 26 at 2 p.m. Donations in Dorothy's memory may be made to Holy Trinity Church, P.O. Box 29, North Gower, ON K0A 2T0, or to a charity of your choice. The heavens will be rejoicing, the angels will be smiling with Dorothy in their arms."
