        "text": "Case Study: Farmer’s Row Almshouses – Roof Project\n\nPart of the service The Almshouse Association offers it’s member charities is to help support them with grants or loans if they do not have sufficient funds to carry out necessary works to their almshouses.\n\nFarmer and Lemmion-Cannon Charity applied to The Almshouse Association for a loan of £100,000 to support the extensive roof repairs needed on their almshouses. Now that the work is complete, the trustees have kindly put together a case study to demonstrate how the funds have been spent and the difference it’s made to their residents’ lives.\n\nBackground\n\nFarmer’s Row is a row of 10 small almshouse cottages (five ground floor and five first floor) that provide single living accommodation to residents. It is named after James Farmer, a local businessman and philanthropist, who originally constructed them as charity houses circa 1850. He left the row of cottages to provide accommodation to local elderly people who are in need of affordable accommodation.\n\nThe cottages have grade II listed status meaning that care is needed when undertaking works. This also limits the type of work that is permitted, and leads to high cost maintenance and upgrading. Occupancy levels are high and the cottages are in high demand. The main source of income for the charity is weekly maintenance contribution income from the properties.\n\nChallenges\n\nDue to age, the roof was in need of significant attention.\n\nVarious repairs had been made in recent years but it was becoming increasingly expensive to repair.\n\nWater ingress had become commonplace affecting not only the roof structure itself but the upper floors of the cottages, and impacting on the quiet enjoyment of the residents.\n\nA new roof\n\nHaving assessed the various options open to them to rectify the problems, it was decided that the installation of a completely new roof was the best and most economical way forward. This would safeguard the future integrity of the building structure, improve the living experience for residents and, over time, be the most cost effective resolution.\n\nVarious quotes were received and it was decided to instruct a local roofer, which was also in the spirit of using local tradespeople and therefore benefiting the locality – reflecting the intention of James Farmer to help the local community.\n\nFinancing the project\n\nThe windows and the roof are expensive projects; the quote for the windows stood at approximately £30,000 – £60,000, depending on the requirements of the planning authority and the roof works were estimated to cost £130,000. While the charity has funds held in reserve, to undertake both of these major projects using reserves would not have been viable. The roof became the urgent project.\n\nThe trustees had been actively looking for grants for expensive upgrading work required for all windows at the properties and they were able to secure £10,000 from a community fund at East Midlands Airport, which is nearby, but no other grant applications were successful.\n\nThey then applied for a loan from The Almshouse Association and received a loan of £100,000. This allowed the roof works to be undertaken in full in late 2023 and also means that it is likely that the windows can be replaced in stages over the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe Charity writes that,\n\n“This support has been nothing short of utterly game changing and will be instrumental in ensuring these expensive, but important projects are completed in good time. Not only will this safeguard the future of the building, it will also enable the trustees to agree a long term financial strategy to ensure this sought after low cost accommodation is preserved for the community for many years to come.”\n\nWork commences\n\nThe Charity advises that the work went largely according to plan, which was the result of significant due diligence and survey work undertaken prior to commencement. It included\n\nmajor scaffolding\n\nremoval of the roof\n\nreplacing all wood work\n\ninstalling a new breathable membrane under the tiles\n\ninstalling new tiles\n\nremediation work to chimneys where necessary\n\nflashing, guttering and ridge tiling\n\nnew insulation in the roof space.\n\nBenefits\n\nApart from the roof, the thermal performance of the building has been enhanced with the insulation and membrane. This will benefit residents in that it will cost less to heat the building.\n\nThe residents were very appreciative of the work undertaken and the trustees received many favourable comments. The local Parish Council was made aware and were supportive of the project.\n\nClick here to find out how you can help us support almshouse charities build new and renovate older almshouses, ensuring safe, warm and affordable homes in friendly communities are available for people who need them for many years to come .\n\nposted June 2024\n\nA glorious day for Girton Town Charity who welcomed HRH The Duke of Gloucester on Thursday 13 June 2024 for a special visit.\n\nGirton Town Charity welcomed our Royal Vice Patron, His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester to their new award-winning “Passivhaus” almshouse development in the heart of Girton in Cambridge.\n\nHis Royal Highness was warmly received by His Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire Julie Spence, Nick Phillips, CEO of The Almshouse Association, Willie Hartley-Russell, Chairman of The Almshouse Association, and Ann Bonnett, Chair of Girton Town Charity.\n\nThe Duke was introduced to trustees and staff at Dovehouse Court, after which he embarked on a tour of the UK’s first fully accredited Passivhaus almshouse development.\n\nDuring the tour, Ian Bramwell, Director of Mole Architects and the mind behind the development showcased the interior of one of the new almshouses. The Duke also had the pleasure of visiting resident Diana Henderson in her home and sharing some homemade pastries and cakes with residents.\n\nThe event was commemorated with the unveiling of a plaque and Ann Bonnett expressed the Charity’s gratitude to The Duke, saying\n\n“it has been a great pleasure to show you around our new almshouses so you could see first-hand these homes for the future.”\n\nAnn then presented His Royal Highness with a signed copy of local photographer Martin Bond’s new book, ‘Cambridge: Town & Gown.’\n\nBefore departing, The Duke remarked,\n\n“I am delighted to have been able to come to Dovehouse Court today to see and hear about your ground-breaking development. It is very impressive that your charity, which has a 500-year history, is now looking to the future with these inspiring homes which have preserved the principles of traditional almshouse design with shared gardens and a community courtyard.”\n\nNick Phillips, CEO of The Almshouse Association, added,\n\n“We are very honoured to receive HRH The Duke of Gloucester at one of our member charities, particularly to show off the first example of a new Passivhaus-certified almshouse development. The Duke seemed very interested in how the charity blended historic design with cutting-edge environmental engineering around a welcoming community courtyard, synonymous with almshouse architectural design.”\n\nEarlier this year, Dovehouse Court was highly commended in the Best New Building Over £2 Million category at the 2024 Greater Cambridge Design and Construction Awards, hosted by the Cambridge Forum for the Construction Industry (CFCI) at Pembroke College.\n\nPassivhaus is a leading international low-energy design standard, offering a proven and cost-effective method to achieve carbon reduction targets. Its key features include high levels of insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, strict airtightness, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, resulting in low energy costs and improved indoor air quality.\n\nposted 21 June 2024\n\nD Day Veteran Phil Sweet is attending the Royal British Legion Service of Remembrance to mark D-Day 80, at the National Memorial Arboretum today, Thursday 6 June 2024\n\nWe are proud to announce that Phil Sweet who is a resident of an almshouses in Stratford-upon-Avon is attending the Royal British Legion Service of Remembrance to mark D-Day 80, at the National Memorial Arboretum on Thursday 6 June 2024 .\n\nPhil who is now 99 recalls the following about his war time experience:\n\n“I was sent to a place called Lochailort in the Highlands where I did six weeks of hefty nautical and ability training. Those six weeks were the toughest I have experienced in my life both physically and mentally. At the end of each week you had exams and if you were not good enough you would be dropped. But I lasted and was appointed an officer then sent to Troon for officer training for another six weeks and then appointed to a tank landing craft ready for the D-Day landings.\n\nThe war had been going for quite a considerable period of time for my training was in readiness for the D-Day landings the time of which we did not know then.\n\nI was part of the initial wave that landed at the village of La Rivière as part of the Gold Beach landings. I was in a flotilla which were the first to go into the beach with two tanks on top of each other on the landing craft so that they could bombard the beach with shells as they were coming in to land. We didn’t lose anybody that day although the landing craft was damaged by the underwater objects as we were going in.\n\nThen following the landing we were offloading equipment to the beaches and whilst doing so I had to go to the tented hospital at Bayeux with suspected peritonitis which turned out to be appendicitis.\n\nI was sent to Plymouth to HMS Foliot, running all the movement of landing craft. We were tropicalizing (adding refrigeration and air conditioning) landing craft ready for the Far East but of course that collapsed because they dropped the atomic bomb.”\n\nTo all the men and women who served in the war and those who sacrificed their own lives for our freedom – we are forever grateful.\n\nposted 6 June 2024\n\n‘Art has been and still is my life’: 93-year-old commissioned to create huge artwork using drawings from sketchbook\n\n24 May 2024 Claudia Lee for South London Press\n\nA 93-year-old who has spent her life teaching and creating art has covered the panels outside her former home with drawings from her old sketchbooks as part of a special commission.\n\nJenny Adams, who is a resident of Hopton’s Almshouse in Hopton Street, Southwark, was set the task to make a site-specific artwork for the hoardings in Blackfriars Road and Nicholson Street, as part of Tenderground and Southwark Charities art programme.\n\nMs Adams’ large-scale drawings are enlarged from several sketchbooks which documented her daily life living in Edward Edwards House, the almshouse behind these hoardings.\n\nShe said: “My first experience with art was a jumble of nothingness.\n\n“Then the colours hit me in my eyes, now I get the joy of smelling, touching and tasting, through art.\n\n“Everything is a beauty. Art has been and still is my life.”\n\nSouthwark Charities’ almshouses offer self sufficient, low-cost community housing for elderly people in the borough. Tenderground is a commissioning programme for the almshouses of Southwark Charities.\n\nThe works, designed in collaboration with graphic designer Charlie Noon, record the often overlooked details of Ms Adams’ daily life – plants, the stages of decaying fruit, roadworks happening outside her window or flowers picked in the garden and left on her windowsill by a neighbour.\n\nMs Adams was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1932. She attended Central Art School in Holborn from 1950 until 1954, and worked as a commercial artist, illustrator and designer for John Lewis.\n\nNow in her early 90s, Ms Adams continues to sketch every day.\n\nAs well as celebrating its residents, Ms Adams’ work marks the next phase of the Edward Edwards House, which is currently under development by Southwark Charities in partnership with developers JTRE London, to create a new almshouse and office building.\n\nThis hoarding installation is the first public commission from Tenderground, directed by Laura Wilson and Clare Cumberlidge.\n\nMs Wilson said: “We are thrilled to be working with artists and the residents of the almshouses to deliver a programme of world class art to Southwark.\n\n“We are lucky to have an artist as inspirational as Jenny Adams amongst the residents and are proud to launch the programme with her work.”\n\nSouthwark Charities has occupied the site in Blackfriars Road since 1752. For more than 250 years it has been home to Edward Edwards House, an almshouse for the people of Southwark.\n\nCaroline Croft, Southwark Charities Chairwoman of Trustees, said: “I am delighted that our charity has embarked upon an art strategy that is so ambitious and creative.\n\n“Tenderground is already showing that high-quality art can make a positive difference to the lives of our beneficiaries and the wider community. I’m so excited by the programme and what is to come.”\n\n[Pictured top: Jenny Adams and The commission marks the next phase of Edward Edwards House, which is currently under redevelopment (Picture: Tenderground/Southwark Charities)]\n\nposted 4 June 2024\n\nA representative from the NEWWAY Project recently got in touch with Association CEO, Nick Phillips to talk about their project and their hopes to set up a new almshouse charity.\n\nThey are seeking land or property, ideally within the London Borough of Newham, to build a community of accommodation for 6-15 single adults who have a history of rough sleeping or in vulnerable housing situations. The offer will be around 12- 24 months, but dependant on levels of needs and move-on options. These beneficiaries will be supported by the community and team from NEWway. They will help them build on networks that include health services, training, employment and education, volunteer opportunities and household management/financial skills. These supports will allow for a move on from their services, that ensures their rough sleeping is non-recurrent.\n\nAngie Allgood, Director at NEWWAY Project tells us her story\n\n“Mine is an unusual story. I am the fourth of six generations to live, work and worship in a small corner of East Ham called Bonny Downs.\n\nI live in the same street that my great-grandparents raised their thirteen children to adulthood. Their cottages were bulldozed as part of the post-war slum clearance.\n\nMy Nan and Grandad moved their family one road down, to council-owned flats, and lived out their days thankful to post-war welfare reforms.\n\nMy Nan knew poverty.\n\nShe shared stories of severe overcrowding, being ‘kicked out’, hiding from the ‘rent man’, fearing homelessness, insecure and irregular employment and the heartbreak of children going to bed hungry.\n\nNEWWAY Vision\n\nWe want for everyone to receive a dignified, compassionate and supportive response which enables a successful and sustainable move away from rough sleeping in the London Borough of Newham.\n\n“I had absorbed her stories and entwined them with my own. In 2013, I walked those same streets, haunted that the destitution of her past life which was quickly becoming our present reality. Rough Sleeping, homelessness, food poverty and insecurity was on the rise.\n\nMyself, and other locals sought the support of Newham churches, and the expertise of Housing Justice to respond to an Isaiah vision to shelter the homeless and feed the hungry in our community.\n\n“In 2013, we opened our first winter night-shelter and formed our charity NEWway Project (1165966).\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have continued to respond to the needs of the homeless community around us. We have grown to provide a commissioned Day Centre- (NEWday) and Employment Social Enterprise- (NEWlife). https://newwayproject.org/\n\nWe see large numbers of single men, mostly under the age of 35. Many have been granted the sanctuary and refuge of status in the UK but are faced with no prospect of housing.\n\nHomelessness prevention teams are overwhelmed, and our guests are found as non- priority. Social Housing is non-existent to this group. Private rents are high and unattainable.\n\nMany have a desire to work but become trapped in exploited situations and find it hard to sustain work when they have no place to call home. We see people coming out of homelessness becoming institutionalised by the systems that are designed to support, but often trap people in expensive welfare benefit options.\n\nNEWway have been seeking a model of housing that focuses on the strength of community in providing support, and empowers individuals to lead purposeful and fulfilled lives, which include gaining and sustaining employment.\n\n“We believe that people coming through homelessness are resilient and courageous and have much to contribute to our community. We want to ensure that those who wish to remain in our borough, have better options to do so.\n\nWe are excited to be exploring almshouses as our answer.\n\nWe are forming a new charity, that aligns with the almshouse principles. This will allow us to provide genuinely affordable community-led housing. We want to provide a place of sanctuary and support, where our guests can recover from the traumas of homelessness and rebuild their lives by contributing within a safe and supportive community.\n\nWe are seeking land or property, ideally within the London Borough of Newham, to build a community of accommodation for 6-15 single adults who have a history of rough sleeping or in vulnerable housing situations.

We visit the latest example, designed to provide community and security\n\nWhen most people hear the word almshouse, they think back to Victorian or medieval times — rows of pretty cottages around courtyards or greens, built by the church or charities to house the elderly poor. But I attended the opening of a brand new almshouse last week in Bermondsey, southeast London. Not only am I hoping it signals an almshouse revival, I found myself hoping that I end up living in one in my sunset years.\n\nAppleby Blue, the new almshouse, has 57 flats and 65 residents, and is a welcome addition to an ancient British tradition of low-cost housing for the elderly. The oldest almshouse still in existence is thought to be the Hospital of St Oswald in Worcester, founded circa 990 by the Bishop of Worcester to create 21 homes for the sick and the poor. Almshouses flourished in Victorian England, as philanthropists felt it their duty to house retired workers or the elderly destitute. But in the 1950s, with the rise of council houses and the welfare state, new supply dried up; philanthropists assumed the state would take over. The ancient ones endure, however: there are currently (1,600 almshouse charities,) 30,000 almshouses in England and 36,000 people living in them, says Nick Phillips, the CEO of The Almshouse Association.\n\nDesigned in weathered brick by Stirling prize-winning architects Witherford Watson Mann, Appleby Blue carries on with the courtyard tradition — the 57 flats look down onto an enclosed communal garden filled with foxgloves and a babbling water feature; elderly residents tend to their rhubarbs and strawberries in another rooftop garden. But Appleby Blue is not a cloistered world: the glass-fronted garden room opens directly onto the high street, so elderly residents can sit and watch the world go by. This is a far cry from many retirement homes, which are hidden in dull suburbs, rather than in the heart of a bustling city.\n\nTo prevent loneliness, residents’ kitchen windows look onto internal glazed walkways — no institutional corridors here — so they can wave at neighbours as they pass; benches outside their doors encourage chatting. Appleby Blue also has a cooking school that is open to the public and residents alike, so the oldies still mix with the outside world.\n\nAppleby Blue is managed by United St Saviour’s Charity which was founded in 1541 and has two other almshouses in London. Residents must be over 65, in financial need and live locally. They pay about £850 a month: most residents’ costs are covered by housing benefit. Many residents were empty-nesters living alone in three or four-bedroom council houses, simply because they couldn’t find anywhere to downsize. So almshouses are a useful valve to relieve housing pressure: five times as many people are housed if you build homes for elderly people, because it frees up family houses down the chain, said Lord Best, who declared Appleby Blue open at the ceremony last week.\n\nThey’re also better for the wellbeing of the elderly than social housing, says Phillips. He cites a 2023 study by Bayes Business School that concluded that a 73-year-old male entering the Charterhouse almshouse in London would live 2.5 years longer compared with his peers from the same socio-economic group.\n\n“They encourage the model of the good neighbour, which you sign up to when you come in,” Phillips says. “It creates an environment of companionship to eradicate isolation. And they are led by volunteer trustees who take an interest in the welfare of the residents.”\n\nHe cites one example of a resident who stopped coming to social events. When the warden checked up on him and inquired why, the man said he was embarrassed by his dirty clothes — his washing machine had broken, so the charity paid to have it fixed.\n\nWith the current dearth of council houses, and the government’s depleted coffers, we clearly need more almshouses to help pick up the slack. “There’s a time bomb of older people living in market-rented property — what will happen when they hit retirement?” said Stephen Burns, the chair of trustees at the charity. “They won’t be able to pay.”\n\nBut how do you fund new almshouses? This one was developed by United St Saviour’s Charity in collaboration with the developer JTRE, which recently completed Triptych Bankside, a development of luxury flats in the borough. Instead of building the required quota of affordable housing in its luxury scheme, JTRE came to an agreement with Southwark council to develop this almshouse on the site of a derelict care home, on land owned by the local authority. It’s a model that should be replicated, says Phillips, who says there is a revival of interest in almshouses in recent years, as housing pressures increase — he estimates 400 were built last year.\n\nNow we just need a new generation of philanthropists to step up and fund more of them — where are all the future Peabodys and Guinnesses? “I read an article about Jeff Bezos going to the moon and billionaires wanting immortality,” says Chris Wilson, the CEO of Southwark Charities. “If they want immortality, fund an almshouse. Your name will live forever.”\n\nIndeed, this new almshouse is named after Dorothy Appleby, a pub landlady who died in 1682, and left her money to the poor through United St Saviour’s, all those centuries ago. Cheers to Dorothy.\n\nFor older readers who are homeowners, this week’s reader question is: if the government cut stamp duty for downsizers, would you consider moving to a smaller home? Why or why not? I’d love to know why you’d be happier remaining in the family home or making a fresh start in a retirement home or bungalow.

But although he lived a lavish lifestyle at his impressive estate at Tongs Wood – now home to St Ronan’s School – he was also a generous benefactor to his village.\n\nWhen he died, Sir Thomas (1657 to 1718) left land in Hawkhurst with a large bequest and instructions that almshouses should be built there, along with a boy’s school and a house for the schoolmaster. The result was the Dunk’s Almshouses that still stand in a prominent position in the Highgate end of the village, and which still provide subsidised accommodation for those in need.\n\nThis year, the Dunk’s charity which runs the almshouses will be celebrating its 300th anniversary, with events including an exhibition about Sir Thomas and the history of the almshouses and the school he created.\n\nHowever, what would have been the centrepiece of the exhibition – contemporary portraits of Sir Thomas and his wife – have been missing for more than 70 years. The portraits, the only known images of Sir Thomas and Lady Cornelia (1668–1717), hung for more than two centuries in the almshouses he created.\n\nBut in 1927 the Dunk’s trustees asked Hawkhurst Parish Council to hang the paintings in the Victoria Hall – then Hawkhurst’s main village hall (now The Kino cinema) – so they could be admired by more members of the public. They are known to have still been there in 1950 but around 1951 the hall was refurbished and somehow the paintings disappeared.\n\nAs a consequence, the charity does not have a single image of its most generous benefactor and has no idea what happened to the artwork.\n\nA spokesman for the trustees said: “We really haven’t a clue. It would be complete speculation after all this time. But we’d dearly love to know.”\n\nIt was not until Elizabeth Clark began researching the history of the charity in 1989 and found references to the paintings that it was even realised they were missing. Sir Thomas came from a family of “great clothiers” with their wealth derived from centuries of textile production. But it was Sir Thomas who diversified into iron-making using the rich timber from Hawkhurst’s woods to fuel the furnaces to smelt the iron ore. He received his knighthood from Queen Anne.\n\nHe and his wife had no surviving children but Sir Thomas also owned a large house in London and a further estate in Chieveley in Berkshire. He left the latter to William Richards (1690–1733), who is believed to have been an illegitimate son, on condition that he changed his name to Dunk. William had a daughter Anne, who, in 1841, married George Montagu, 2nd Earl of Halifax, who also took on the surname Dunk, finally making the family part of the aristocracy.\n\nSir Thomas had served as Sheriff of London in 1711 and was also a governor of St Thomas’ Hospital in the capital. His initial bequest provided for six almshouses in Rye Road but over the years they have been expanded and there are now 10 one-person flats and four bungalows.\n\nSir Thomas is buried at St Laurence Church at The Moor in Hawkhurst.\n\nHe also provided for a school, initially for 20 pupils. Two other famous sons of the village were educated there – William and Reginald Rootes – who went on to establish the Rootes Motorcar Company.\n\nBut the school closed in 1923. The school hall remains and is let out for village meetings and events, the income from which is used by the Dunk’s Educational Foundation to support the education of Hawkhurst’s children with grants where needed.\n\nThe Dunk’s charity will celebrate its tercentenary with an exhibition open from 10am till 4pm each day in the old schoolroom over three days from June 20 to June 23.\n\nChildren from Hawkhurt’s three schools – the primary school, St Ronan’s and Marlborough House – are also taking part in an art competition to reflect its long history. There will also be a grand raffle.\n\nThe chairman of trustees, Nigel Collinson, said, “By making a bit of a splash in celebrating the 300-year milestone, the trustees are hoping to spread the word about Hawkhurst’s great son and to encourage active involvement from the wider community so that Dunk’s can sail safely through the turbulent waters of the next 300 years.”\n\nAnyone with any information is asked to contact the trust’s clerk, Lisa Panting, by email to dunksclerk@outlook.com, or call 01580 388973.\n\nposted 28 May 2024"
