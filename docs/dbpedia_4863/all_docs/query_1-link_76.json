        "text": "Situated in a bend of the beautiful River Eden - Cumbria's longest river, Appleby was the former County town of Westmorland. Upon the creation of the 'new' county of Cumbria, the town adopted the former county name to become know as Appleby-in-Westmorland in order to reflect the town's heritage and preserve the name of the ancient county.\n\nAppleby offers a wealth of places to visit, Appleby is steeped in history with an array of places to explore the heritage of this former county town. The beautiful scenery offers many opportunities for walkers and nature lovers and for garden lovers there is no shortage of nearby beautiful gardens and nurseries to explore.\n\nIf you are looking for an active holiday, whether it's swimming, tennis, squash, bowls or enjoying a round of golf, trout fishing in the River Eden, or a tranquil riverside walk amid the breathtaking scenery, Appleby-in-Westmorland offers something for everyone whilst on holiday.\n\nIn addition to this Appleby's award-winning train station, a short stroll from the town centre lies one of Britain's most spectacular railways - The Settle - Carlisle Line. Throughout the year there are many events but none more famous than Appleby Horse Fair - which takes place in early June. This is an extremely popular event and accommodation at Appleby Manor Country House Hotel during this week is in high demand, therefore it is essential that you book well in advance to avoid disappointment.\n\nAppleby Manor Country House Hotel is located only a short drive from the quaint market town of Penrith. Penrith is a bustling town with specialist and traditional shops and shopping arcade - perfect for anyone who enjoys shopping. Each month there is the Cumbria Farmers' market selling a wide range of locally produced foods - which are fully traceable. The market is held in the historic setting of the market square.\n\nThe historic town of Penrith is rich in history and perhaps the best place to start a tour of Penrith would be at the Penrith Museum and Tourist Information Centre - prominent not only because of the information available regarding the history, geology and archaeology of the area and the tourist information relating to accommodation, attractions, transport etc but most notably because they are housed in the former Robinson's School; an Elizabethan building which was altered in 1670 and used as a school.\n\nIn the 9th and 10th Centuries Penrith became the capital of Cumbria. The ruined 14th century castle has a captivating history and is cared for by English Heritage. Above the town there is Beacon Hill tower - this is where warning fires were lit during the Border Wars, on a clear day one can enjoy spectacular views to the Lake District Fells and across the Eden valley.\n\nWhilst walking around the town look out for the building which overlooks St Andrews Church (currently a restaurant) this was the Dame Anne Birkett School where William and Dorothy Wordsworth and Mary Hutchinson (who later became his wife) attended. The churchyard of St Andrew's has an ancient 'Giant's Grave' where Owen Caesarius the 10th Century Cumbrian ruler is supposedly buried. Also keep your eyes open for the two oldest streets; Burrowgate and Sandgate, which date from the 13th Century.\n\nFollowing a busy days sightseeing and shopping around Penrith retreat back to the relaxing surroundings of Appleby Manor Country House Hotel. The hotel has its own leisure facilities, where you can take a swim in the plunge pool, enjoy the sauna and turkish steam rooms. The Hotel's comfortable lounge and bar offer the perfect place to relax and plan the next days activities in the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales or one of the many nearby attractions, before enjoying a delicious meal in the Hotel's award-winning restaurant.\n\nAppleby Manor Country House Hotel is nestled amongst the rolling Pennine Hills, a few miles North lies England's largest 'area of outstanding natural beauty' - the High Pennines.\n\nThe North Pennines was designated as an area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1988. It is the second largest AONB at almost 2000 square kilometres of un spoilt and undiscovered countryside, with miles of quiet paths to walk and explore.\n\nWhilst staying at Appleby Manor Country House Hotel there are plenty of places to explore in the Pennines and the area is rich in history, wildlife and culture. It is also unrivalled countryside for walking, cycling and watching the wildlife in its natural habitat.\n\nNorth of Appleby, sample some of the many organic treats available at the Village Bakery, in Melmerby. Famous throughout Britain for its highest quality, locally produced, organic food. There is a shop and also an exhibition. Continue on to Hartside Viewpoint which is high on the Pennines fringes overlooking the Vale of Eden. It is a stunning vantage point where you can see the spectacular Lake District fells beyond. Continuing explore Alston, England's highest market town, with quaint cobbled streets and interesting shops and galleries. Continue on to the splendour of Hadrian's Wall, before returning via the delightful Teesdale and High Force waterfall reputed to be England's largest waterfall plunges over the Whin Sill to a deep pool 69 ft below.\n\nWalking Holidays & The Pennine Way The Pennines is a great place for days out walking or walking breaks and holidays. The Pennines provides challenging long distance routes such as the Pennine Way, and Appleby Manor Country House Hotel is located a short distance off the route of the Pennine Way and provides comfortable hotel accommodation after a long days walking.
