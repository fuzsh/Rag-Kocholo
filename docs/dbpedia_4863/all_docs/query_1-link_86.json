        "text": "Frank Vlasic, age 88 of Elizabeth Twp., passed away on Thursday, November 28, 2019 at Mt. Vernon of Elizabeth Assisted Living. Born May 27, 1931 in Yugoslavia, he was the son of the late John and Ana (Bogovic) Vlasic. A retired steelworker for US Steel - National Tube Works in McKeesport, he joins his wife, the late Dorothy Jane (Vugrincic) Vlasic, who passed away September 3, 2018. Frank lived in White Oak for almost 50 years before having to give up his beloved home and yard where he loved to spend his days outside cutting grass, planting flowers or working on cars. Frank was an active member of CFU Lodge 146 in Versailles for more than 60 years. Frank will always be remembered for his strong work ethic, his outgoing personality, willingness to always lend a helping hand to anyone who needed it and of being a proud Croatian! His heritage meant everything to him and he never hesitated to tell anyone who would listen how he was Croatian and then would try to teach them his native language. Frank loved his job as a mill wright and was always proud to say he worked at National Tube for 30 years. He always had a story to share about the steel mill and his friends and colleagues he so enjoyed working with. After retiring from the steel mill, Frank continued to stay busy working part time at K Mart and doing odd jobs around the house. He especially took pride in working with his hands to maintain his well-manicured lawn, working on his car, neighbors cars or any house or yard task that required hard work, Frank was always up for the challenge. When Frank and Dorothy moved to Mount Vernon, he was immediately well-liked by the staff, residents and all who visited for his outgoing personality and eagerness to help with chores. He came to love his new life and home at Mt. Vernon of Elizabeth and considered everyone to be part of his Croatian family. The family would like to thank Dr. Antoncic, Nurses Sue Urban and Leitha, Billy, Marcia, Lisa W and all the staff at Mt. Vernon for all of their loving care and support the last two years. In addition from Hospice 365 Nurses Becky and Niki with an extra special thank you to Melissa for all the exceptional care they took of Frank the last few months of his life.

Vlasic of Cumming, GA, his grandchildren Alexandra Rose and Timothy Matthew Appleby, sister Caroline Barone, niece Nada Novosil , nephews Frank and Zelijko from Croatia, sister in law and brother in law Joe and Kathy Vugrincic.
