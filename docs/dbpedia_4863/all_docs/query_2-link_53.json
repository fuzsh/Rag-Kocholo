If your submission has not been included, please allow 1 working day before contacting us regarding its whereabouts. Thank you.\n\nLiz Cooke Condolence Book\n\nPeggie Rimmer\n\nLiz and I didn’t meet very often because I left Somerville for CERN in 1967, having been a JRF, and have lived in Geneva ever since. I can’t recall why and when we met for the first time, but our friendship grew over the years and we enjoyed many happy times together. I remember Liz with enormous affection, admiration and respect. I will sorely miss her.\n\nNeeta Patel\n\nI first met Liz shortly after she had joined the College in an alumni relations role and was immediately taken by her energy, warmth, kindness and a real desire to connect with alumni and also connect alumni to each other. She must have met and connected with thousands of alumni during her time at Somerville, and each of us has special memories of how she was kind and helpful to us. I am honoured to have called her a friend, and it was particularly good to see her in June last year when she attended our Holtby group’s 40th Anniversary reunion lunch hosted by Jan Royall, even as she was unwell. She will not be forgotten and I will miss seeing her smiling face at future events. May she rest in peace.\n\nTimothy Lloyd\n\nThe opportunity to celebrate Liz’s life and memory is welcome, although to my great regret family obligations prevent me from attending the event in College. I offer some memories from almost 60 years since we first met, when up at Oxford, both of us reading History and each aiming to become a barrister, as members of the Middle Temple. Liz was a year ahead of me at Oxford and at the Bar, and we took up very different types of legal practice. Even so we became and remained good friends ever since, sharing interests including opera, cinema and good food. James was already very much on the scene at Oxford and my diaries record a series of dinners and other occasions over the years, including visits to Charlbury and later to Great Tew which were always special events in terms of hospitality. I remember once when my wife and I stayed with them at Charlbury and Liz had created a homemade framboise liqueur, which we consumed in large quantities. The arrival of a letter addressed in Liz’s elegant and highly individual italic handwriting, which might well contain an invitation of some kind, was always to be welcomed.\n\nMemories of visiting or staying at Great Tew are more vivid. The guest bedroom was dominated by a four poster bed, with a bedcover and hangings in crewelwork embroidered by Liz herself, copying originals in the V&A. It also housed some of her many collections, in particular of shells and of insects. Elsewhere in the house one saw her collections of jelly moulds, of blue and white china, and of paintings in traditional style. One might also observe the carefully constructed shelving in her snug, constructed for her by a local joiner to house her books in the neatest possible manner and her many LPs, and note also the absence of a television.\n\nHer love of the house and its garden and her adherence to traditional values and attitudes was exemplified by her generous and warm hospitality. Among so many I mention one, some 15 or 20 years ago in August, at the time of the Perseid meteor shower, which could be seen particularly well that year. At the time we had a cottage not far away from Great Tew. Liz invited us and others over for dinner and to view the Perseids from her garden after dinner. We all lay in the garden after dinner, digesting a delicious meal and enjoying the company while looking up at the amazing sight in the sky for a long long time.\n\nWe miss her so much.\n\nErika Fairhead\n\nWhen I came up to Somerville the historians in the year above me were among my friends, partly through the kindness of a girl who had been at school with me. Among them was Liz Cooke. I couldn’t understand why such a talented and glamorous creature should make me feel so special! In later years I understood that her gift for friendship extended to everyone. Thank you, Liz.\n\nJane Sayers\n\nLiz Cooke – what a marvellous person she was!\n\nI came to Somerville as a research student and only met her once when she welcomed me warmly. She personified the best of Somerville, always ready to help and to facilitate and to make people happy, taken from her family and friends far too early in life.\n\nEric Southworth\n\nLiz — hospitable, alert, perceptive, diplomatic, not self-seeking. What an ambassador for the Society to which she was devoted, winning affection without having to ‘try’ – attentive to the whole picture *and* to detail, sensitive to the concerns of others. Supportive to so many people, not least when life got tough for them. She embodied Charity (in the sense of Caritas), and the other theological virtues, Faith and Hope.\n\nHer house and garden in Tew were an expression of that lovely spirit, too.\n\nWhat a joy to have known her; her memory is a blessing; may she rest in peace.\n\n(Adrianne Tooke would have echoed every word of this, I know.)\n\nSusan Bright\n\nIt is hard to imagine Somerville without the wonderful Liz Cooke. I first got to know Liz through the Somerville Lawyers Group. She would travel up to London for our regular meetings and attend our events. She was unfailingly enthusiastic and supportive of all our efforts and kept us up to date with the ongoing life of college. I will miss you, Liz: your lovely smile, your wise counsel and solving the world’s problems over a glass or two of wine with you.\n\nMargaret May\n\nLiz was the friendly, welcoming face of Somerville at all the reunions I attended, and was unfailingly helpful and caring over every enquiry, whether on writing an obituary or advising on my grandson’s Oxford application. Her dedication, warmth and commitment will be much missed.\n\nMargaret Casely-Hayford\n\nLiz made each individual feel welcome as she remembered specific details about each of us; and her magic was the way in which she linked all of our specialisms into a clever chain that established our continued engagement with College through imaginative events and essential development, but always felt like caring and never felt like hectoring. She cared, so we cared. She’ll be very much missed.\n\nSamantha Sebastian Dieckmann\n\nThank you for your strength and wisdom, Liz. You were a model Somervillian, and have been greatly missed.\n\nKristin Payne\n\nI will always remember your warm welcome and personal concern every time I was able to attend a Somerville event. Thank you, Liz. We will miss you greatly.\n\nWinnie Man\n\nDear Liz\n\nI remember you making a point of introducing yourself as a fellow historian.\n\nYou made me feel seen, and your belief in me inspired my belief in myself.\n\nYou are missed – and your light shines in your legacy of connection.\n\nFarewell.\n\nWinnie\n\nHistory, 1994\n\nSusan Lourenco\n\nWithout Liz, I would never have returned to Somerville in spirit or in fact. It was she who encouraged me although I lived far from England, and it was she who motivated many of us to do what we did with and for the College. Liz encouraged original ideas, and it saddens me that to commemorate her remarkable contributions the special initiative is a History fellowship, not such an innovative idea! I, too, read Modern History, appreciate that it enabled many of us to think creatively about the past. But what was so remarkable about Liz was her deep interest and loving concern for the future.\n\nMaya Slater\n\nYou have been a friend to all us alumnae. We will miss you greatly.\n\nMark Torok\n\nDear Liz, thank you for having been the beating heart of Somerville, a true pillar of maintaining relationships and links with the College. You’ll never be forgotten and always remembered, rest in peace.\n\nMaggie Biss (Hunt)\n\nHappy memories ‘64-‘67\n\nAntoinette Finnegan\n\nI have such fond memories of working with Liz during my time at Somerville; it is hard to imagine the College without her.\n\nSheena Carmichael\n\nLiz was always so helpful with any problems that alumni had. She will be sadly missed.\n\nClare Roskill\n\nLiz seemed to know all of us Somervillians and was at so many events I attended in London, warm, welcoming and reassuring. What an amazing steadfast presence she was. She was to me Somerville personified, Somerville “on legs” so to speak because she was always willing to travel from Oxford or her home in Great Tew. How lucky we were to have her. Every college needs a Liz Cooke.\n\nWe were also both members of the Somerville Book Group, still run so well by Ruth Crawford. Liz’s thoughts, whether in person or on Zoom, were considered and frank. I was puzzled when she suddenly resigned from the group, having no idea she was so ill. It was, however, typical of Liz to leave with no fuss and not long after I learnt with great sadness of her death. We shall miss her hugely.\n\nLeanda Dormer\n\nI remember her kindness and warmth and am sorry to hear of her death. May she rest in peace, with love\n\nMary Stewart\n\nLiz and I came up to Somerville at the same time (1964) and both to read history. She was our Scholar, I a lowly Commoner. Yet we became fast friends, and I learned so much from her that was beyond my academic education, notably opera, good food and wines, and later the necessary interest in cooking. She introduced me to other friends who added film, modern music and art, and more wonderful conversation. I have moved to Canada in 1973, and our connection became more tenuous, but the image of her in our college years is still vivid.\n\nElliot Falvert-Martin\n\nWhen I initially joined the office, I was told about the ‘gentle titan’ within the team. While our backgrounds were very different, she never made me feel out of place and always took the time to listen. I reflect upon (and will continue to) the memories I shared with you with great fondess. Liz, I miss you already but I hope you’ve found the peace you deserve. I know that movie nights for a lot of people will never be the same 🙂\n\nChristine Shuttleworth\n\nLiz was always so kind to me and despite all the people she must have had to deal with, she always made me feel special. She simply was Somerville to me.\n\nJonathan Whitehouse\n\nThank you Liz for all efforts to keep Somervillians around the world updated on the latest news. You will be greatly missed.\n\nMK Lee\n\nDeeply saddened to hear the passing of Liz… I’ll always remember her warmth, passion and the remarkable contributions she has made to the College. May you rest in peace.\n\nCharlotte Morgan\n\nIt was a pleasure and privilege to work with Liz on the City Group meeting programme when I was Co-chair with Nicola. Liz had very wide ranging interests and contacts, she took a lively interest in finding new topics for meetings, and was generous in making introductions to alumni or other personal contacts who might contribute. Her warmth and tact put everyone at ease, she could relate to alumni and guests of different generations whatever their career or academic background, creating lifelong links with Somerville for many of us. One of my happiest memories was visiting her for lunch in Great Tew during the short summer break from lockdowns in 2020, I admired her resilience in living apart from her family and from college during those difficult times, and also her courage in returning to college events in more recent years despite her illness. Many condolences to her family, I will miss her.\n\nElizabeth Reid\n\nFarewell, Liz. You were a wonderful person to know and so very welcoming to Somerville.\n\nRebecca Jenkins\n\nMy impression of Liz Cooke was of indefatigable kindness and enthusiasm. Whether through efficient research or an amazing memory, she always remembered my name despite my fleeting presence. I can still see her welcoming smile. May she rest in peace.\n\nSusan Farnsworth\n\nLike all who knew Liz and who benefitted from her care and concern, I remain so appreciative of her extraordinary contributions to the Somerville community and so grateful for her warmth and kindness across the decades. We were “fellow” students of Dr. Agatha Ramm, a bond that established the basis for friendship and solidarity. While I’ll be in the US in April and unable to attend the Memorial Service, I want to extend my deepest sympathy to Liz’s family and multitudes of friends, in honor of a life of generous service and true meaning. She will be long remembered.\n\nNaomi Layish (Shepherd)\n\nWhen I returned to the UK after a lifetime abroad I was doubtful as to whether I could renew my links to my old college. A son had graduated from Merton years later, relatives still taught at Oxford, but my generation would surely, I thought, have been forgotten. I wrote to Liz. She could not have been more friendly, making me feel that indeed I still belonged to Somerville, and the college was still a part of my life. Many visits followed, the last a dinner when – to my amazement – Liz had organised a place for me at the high table – an unexpected honour. I am sad that she has gone.\n\nChris Grant\n\nShe was the person who got me returning to Somerville renions always so welcoming, Somerville owes her a lot and she will be dearly missed\n\nLucinda Terry\n\nWith gratitude for all her knowledge and hard work.\n\nMay she rest in peace and rise in glory.\n\nJenifer Wates\n\nI shall never forget the warmth and genuine interest with which Liz greeted us on every visit to Somerville, making each of us feel totally special. On one lovely occasion she invited my partner and myself to a wonderful lunch in her garden, when she was organising a ‘vide-grenier’ sale in her garage, in aid of a local charity. Entirely typical of her wide-ranging concern for others and her huge generosity of spirit. Her presence at events always made them feel so welcoming – it will be hard to come to Somerville and not see her smile of recognition. Heartfelt thanks to you, Liz, for all your loving care.\n\nPriscilla Baines\n\nA wonderful friend to so many Somervillians for many years. She is greatly missed.\n\nSusan Karamanian\n\nFor many Somerville alumni, Liz was a precious link to the College. She was attentive and reliable. She was always connecting us to others. Liz’s spirit of community and devotion to Somerville never waned. Not too long before her death, Liz came to the College for a luncheon that the Principal had organized to celebrate a gathering of the Holtbyites, a group that had lived in or was associated with Holtby Hall in the early 1980s. In advance of the luncheon, Liz had made sure that the College had a room for me. She was full of life at the luncheon, the usual Liz, and that is how I will remember her. Rest in Peace, Liz, and thanks for your kindness and care.\n\nVirginia Ross\n\nThe love Liz’s friends feel for her would displace the Pacific Ocean. Liz had a charming way of engaging anyone who met her, so that one and all felt close to her. As Jan notes, Liz was “in so many ways, the quiet, beating heart of Somerville”.\n\nLiz’s observant eyes kept watch over the Somerville community, encouraging our engagement and welcoming us back – no mean feat since some students left the college feeling antipathy or alienation.\n\nLiz, while making each of us feel special and appreciated, endlessly conjured ways Somervillians could connect with the college and with one another: celebration teas and literary lunches, jolly family gatherings, regional and professional alum groups, annual commemoration services for fellow Somervillians and their families.\n\nI am immensely indebted to Liz and will celebrate Liz’s remarkable life whenever and wherever the Somerville community gathers and on April 27th, 2024.\n\nFrancis Wynne\n\nAfter a long period without any communication on my part with the college I emailed Liz about potentially visiting Somerville with my fiancee at the time and was truly touched by the familiarity, kindness and warmth she greeted us with. Liz was a lovely lady and I wish her family and friends solace in all the kind messages that have been written about her.\n\nJames Liu\n\nLiz, you are the very fabric and the solid foundation of Somerville. You will be missed and thank you.\n\nAlannah Osborough\n\nI was shocked to hear about Liz – I probably haven’t been on top of messages.\n\nShocked because she has always been, for me, a face and name of Somerville. I remember fondly when she took my children around my old rooms (at no notice). I am grateful for all her work there.\n\nDeepest sympathy to her family and friends. A loss for everyone for now of a lovely soul.\n\nRuth Savage\n\nWith thanks for the legacy she has left in the lives of so many Somervillians I send my heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. It won’t be the same without her, but how much we can take forward. May she rest in peace.\n\nThomas Wide\n\nI utterly adored Liz – and not just because she saved my bacon when I was a penniless graduate student in the US and she somehow summoned funds at a moment’s notice to support my living expenses. She was so curious about the world, so humble, and so wise, and she seemed to live for others. We corresponded fairly often over the years and I am sad I did not get to see her one more time to tell her how important she was to me. I treasure her memory and send my deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\nAnn Liebeck\n\nSincere condolences. Liz was a very supportive figure to me. Thinking of her family in this very sad time.\n\nCaroline Cracraft\n\nIn heartfelt grief for Liz who devoted herself to Somerville and enriched our links with our old college.\n\nEternal rest give unto her, Oh Lord! And let perpetual Light shine upon her! May she rest in peace. Amen.\n\nHelen Goodman\n\nLiz’s commitment to Somerville shone through her energy and dedication to the Association. She had a huge amount of energy and warmth and always displayed genuine friendship towards former members. She made everyone feel special. It is difficult to imagine future meetings without her.\n\nHannah Mortimer\n\nDearest Liz – what a legacy you leave and we will truly miss you. Liz contacted me in 2003 when Barbara Craig was spending time in our local cottage hospital inviting me to be a North Yorkshire arm of the Somerville family for Barbara. My husband and I have felt truly part of that family ever since. She enfolded us and made us welcome with several wonderful visits to her home and garden (what an extraordinary collection of old stoneware and jelly moulds!). How she remembered us all and found a way to make us all feel welcomed and included was a rare gift. Garry and I send our warmest wishes and condolences to Ollie and his family.\n\nRoz Morris\n\nLiz was such a wonderful person and a tremendous asset for Somerville. Always helpful and practical when organising events and with huge knowledge of so many Somervillians. She was terrific when we ran our Somerville Media Days which I was delighted to chair for several years. I can’t believe she’s gone and I really miss her and send my condolences to her family.\n\nVictoria Glendenning (née Seebohm)\n\nIt was a shock to hear that Loz had gone. She represented so much that was ‘Somerville’ always welcoming, wise and kind, remembering or seeming to remember veryone, always ready to help, and apparently unfflappable, though her role was complex and demanding. We wom’t forget her.\n\nIrene Lynch Fannon\n\nIn the old days Liz sent me handwritten notes in black ink to thank me for the most meagre of contributions to Somerville. Her thoughtfulness and dedication to Somerville inspired many of us to give more and to plan to give more as life goes on and we find we can do so.\n\nShe brought the alumni community together and was forever optimistic about the support this vibrant group could give to the many worthwhile initiatives that have meant Somerville continues to flourish.\n\nQuite simply Liz was a very impressive, dedicated, hardworking person, with a real sense of commitment to the college.\n\nMay she rest in peace.\n\nWith warmest wishes to the college community on this sad occasion.\n\nPenny McCarthy (née Gee)\n\nWhat a loss to the community of Somerville, tying past and present together. Liz was so welcoming, cheerful, lively, warm. She will be greatly missed.\n\nGianna Neuman (née Chadwick)\n\nPlease accept my sincere condolences on the sad passing of Liz. I met her in the early 2000’s. She was so friendly, keen to get to know everyone and full of energy. Sending my best wishes to her friends and family at this difficult time.\n\nFareda Banda\n\nDear Liz,\n\nIt is hard to believe that you have gone on ahead and that we won’t be hearing from you. Seeing Somerville popping up in my mail inbox always meant a note from you, reconnecting us to College and reminding me of one of the happiest periods of my life. I should have let you know more often how much I appreciated receiving these missives and seeing what was going on.\n\nI will forever be grateful to you for allowing me to write an obituary for my late headmistress, Dorothy Twiss for the Report. Her daughter, Stephanie was touched to receive it and to be invited to the online memorial service that was held during COVID. You were unerringly kind and accommodating in the planning.\n\nOne of my favourite hymns in high school (with Mrs Twiss terrifying us) was “In the Morning of my Life” (my name for it). It ended:\n\n“In the evening of my life I shall look to the sunset,\n\nAt a moment in my life when the night is due.\n\nAnd the question I shall ask only I can answer.\n\nWas I brave and strong and true?\n\nDid I fill the world with love my whole life through?”\n\nLiz, by keeping our Somerville family linked, you touched us deeply. Thank you.\n\nHamba Kahle (Go well)\n\nFareda\n\nElizabeth Bingham\n\nLiz – a close friend for forty years. What fun we had on the Appeal Committee in the 1980s! Our ambitions were initially modest since at first we had failed to realise that fees fixed by the Government were not intended to cover costs. Fortunately for Somerville, Liz grasped the problem and bit by bit the money began to roll in. Her contribution to Somerville must be valued in millions. And she will be sorely missed by her many many friends.\n\nJulia Griffin\n\nI am so saddened to hear of the death of Liz Cooke: one of the kindest, friendliest, sincerest people I have ever known. She was a great friend to my late mother, Miriam Griffin, and to me. Somerville will not be the same without her warm and cheerful welcome.\n\nIt is a joy to have known her. May her memory be a blessing.\n\nMargaret Clark\n\nRemembered with gratitude as a fine example of the History School, a dedicated Somervillian, and always so kind to arriving alumnae at whatever function she had so effectively arranged. I shall always be glad to have known her.\n\nMary Foote\n\nLiz has been a wonderful ongoing link with the college over many years, always ready to welcome us at every gathering, so warm and friendly and ready to help. Her passing is a great loss to us all.\n\nAnita Howard\n\nIt was a great honour to have known Liz, and to have worked with her in even the smallest capacity. Her kindness and encouragement were unfailing from her first contact with me to her last, shortly before her passing. May she rest in peace, and my deepest condolences to her son and family, her friends, and her colleagues at Somerville who continue to honour her legacy.\n\nDebottam Bose\n\nI recently found out the sad news and my heartfelt condolences to the family and everyone at Sommerville who knew here over the years. I was fortunate enough to meet Liz at a number of alumni events and she always remembered me and we shared wonderful conversations. Warm, engaging and always being herself and welcoming. You shall be missed.\n\nPauline Seymour\n\nThanks for all the work you did with the Somerville Association.\n\nAuriol Miller\n\nI was so very sorry to hear in the summer that Liz had died and I know she will be greatly missed by all of us who have kept in touch with Somerville over the (many) years since we graduated. Liz had that extraordinary knack of being genuinely interested in whatever you were doing, and whenever she welcomed you back to College, she made you still feel very much part of the extended Somerville community. A great gift used always for others. Deepest condolences to her family and friends, who will be feeling her loss so very much.\n\nMiranda McCormick\n\nI was so sad to hear that Liz Cooke is no longer with us. Although I failed to attain the professional status of so many of my contemporaries (1968), and consequently still felt somewhat intimidated every time I attended an event at Somerville in comparatively recent years, Liz intuitively understood this, and made me feel equally, or even more, welcome. I shall never forget her kindness.\n\nJacky Rattue\n\nLiz had time for everyone, and, to her, no one was insignificant. She had an extraordinary ability to make you feel valued, and she genuinely cared about every one of us, doing it it in such an understated way that you only realised afterwards how very widely her support was felt. She embodied that best Somervillian attribute, of enabling us to feel held; she nurtured a very strong sense of belonging, which, for me, has been an irreplaceable source of strength. She leaves a legacy her family can be very proud of. Thank you, Liz.\n\nAngela Morgan\n\nI will miss you, Liz. Always cheerful and ready to help.\n\nNatasha Robinson\n\nI miss Liz deeply both as a friend and as my anchor at Somerville. Her depth of knowledge of almost every Somervillian within living memory was extraordinary and made each and every alumna who returned to the College feel welcome and valued. If it had not been for her encouragement I might never have re-engaged with the College. Her determination to keep the Somerville Medics group running, and her commitment to the annual Commemoration Service were just two of the many events that she supported so effectively in a way that made Somerville a focus for alumni. We shared a love of opera and I shall cherish happy memories of the opera evenings at Great Tew which ran on into the early hours – we had only just begun planning the next one shortly before she died.\n\nLara Payne\n\nAmong my strongest memories of Somerville was that of being in the company of Liz. From the student open days, matriculation, formal halls, graduation and then alumni visits, Liz was a red thread of integrating welcome at Somerville. She was also full of ideas and supportive to good purposes, helping in many practical ways with fund raising, and instilling in us a sense of acheivement and happiness in our endeavours. My condolences to her family and friends.\n\nKaren Richardson\n\nLiz was a true one-off. How can one summarise her amazing qualities when so many pages of tributes have been written, listing just a few of her positive characteristics? And there just didn’t seem to be any negative ones!\n\nShe was a true one-off. I knew her through so many different facets of Somerville life, when I was Chairman of Somerville Lawyers, President of the Somerville Association, a member of the Somerville London Group, and also just as a warm, hospitable and reliable friend.\n\nShe was so proud of Ollie. How proud he can be of her!\n\nSomerville, and all of us privileged enough to know her, are so lucky to have had her in our lives. We will always remember her.\n\nSamantha Knights\n\nDear Liz: You enriched the experience of so many Somervillians in a multitude ways with your extraordinary ability, energy, and warmth. The sheer depth and variety of alumni events was astonishing under your tutelage, and College the richer for it. It brought people together, generated discussion, debate and formed new friendships.\n\nYou were a dear personal friend to me having found me many years after I left Somerville and very much thanks to you that I re-engaged with the College.\n\nYou will be sorely missed by those near and far but your legacy will be an everlasting one.\n\nThoughts and deepest condolences to Ollie, family and friends.\n\nZoe Fannon\n\nI was very sorry to hear of Liz’s passing. Her exceptional ability to remember individuals and the links between them created a real sense of Somerville community amongst the alumni and between alumni and students. She is a great loss to the college.\n\nCarol Morrison\n\nAfter Somerville I moved to Canada, and Liz Cooke was always very interested in what I accomplished in my new job. She provided a wonderful way to keep in touch.\n\nNeil Spring\n\nI was deeply saddened to learn of Liz’s passing. She was a great ambassador for our college and I am grateful to her for all her work over the years.\n\nCharlotte Beatson\n\nWhen Liz succeeded me as Somerville’s Appeal Secretary in 1987 I am sure that she never imagined that she would remain at the heart of alumni relations for the next 36 years. The fact that she did is a reflection of the enormous energy she put in to building the Somerville family and keeping in touch with so many of us.\n\nI was deeply saddened to hear of her death and send my deepest condolences to Ollie and her family.\n\nGillie Evans\n\nI am very sad to hear that Liz has died. Her warmth and welcome was such a feature of Somerville over the past 40 years, firstly during my time as College Doctor in the early 1980s and since then at many Medics Days and alumni events. I will miss her very much indeed.\n\nHilary Newiss\n\nI was so shocked at this news – typically, Liz had taken the trouble to email to congratulate me on an appointment only late July, when she must have been ill herself (of which she made no mention). She was an amazing force of nature, good humour and deep knowledge where alumni were concerned. Somerville were so fortunate to have her and will miss her sorely.\n\nHelen Dyson (Rice)\n\nI was terribly sad to hear this news. For so many years an email or letter from Liz meant that I was about to reconnect with Somerville and she did indeed have a gift for connecting people and place. Sincere condolences to her family and friends.\n\nEsther Rantzen\n\nLiz was a wonderful ambassador for Somerville and a tremendous friend to me and the three Somervillian members of my family. She will greatly missed. We send our deepest sympathy to her family and friends.\n\nBen and Louisa Price (Chambers)\n\nLiz was a lovely person and a true Somervillian. We always enjoyed getting her emails and updates about life at the College that holds such happy memories for us. She will be very missed indeed.\n\nNiels Kröner\n\nLiz was wonderfully warm, witty, perceptive and able to make so many, often unusual connections. How can we thank her properly for all she has done for Somerville (though what I know is probably only the tip of the iceberg)? As long as all the people who have met through Liz are alive, she will live on in our thoughts. I am grateful for all Liz has done, grateful for knowing her, and my condolences go out all her friends and family.\n\nAnna and Roman Walczak (Senior Research Fellow)\n\nLiz was a wonderful friend. She was making you feeling welcomed and belonging to Somerville regardless of your formal connection to the College. Whether Somerville or Great Tew, her hospitality was legendary. Memories of Liz and great time we had with Liz will stay with us forever.\n\nLindsey Richardson\n\nReading these condolence messages has brought home to me such a sense ofLiz’s warmth and vitality. Although we never met, she and I exchanged many emails to track down some ‘missing’ old Somervillians living here in the US. Even over email, her personality and kindness shone so brightly. Among many others, I am grateful to her for reconnecting me with Somerville after nearly 50 years and am only sorry not to be able to thank her in person at the reunion next week. What a truly wonderful lady.\n\nNicola Ralston (Thomas)\n\nDear, dear Liz, how to put into words what you did for the College and for so many individual Somervillians, old and young? Your remarkable understanding and vision of what the College community could, and should be has come to pass: it was truly a lifetime’s work. All we can say is a heartfelt “thank you”.\n\nSophie Forsyth\n\nA woman of quiet distinction whose work on behalf of our very special college has been no less than transformational. An inspiration since my undergraduate years rather more time ago than I care to remember – sorely missed but always in our hearts.\n\nHilary Manning\n\nI was so sorry to hear that Liz has passed away. I last spoke to her at the Memorial Service in June, where she was busy talking to as many people as possible, with her usual warmth and kindness. She was always so interested in everyone.\n\nSo many of us have become more involved with College because of Liz’s enthusiasm and all her work in alumni relations. We will all miss her hugely. I will also miss her contributions to our book group and her encyclopaedic knowledge of all things Somervillian.\n\nRuth Rostron (Treloar)\n\nLovely Liz. How I admired you with your curly red hair, sweeping around college in your scholar’s gown!\n\n‘We are the lucky ones’ you said not long ago, and how very lucky I feel to have had my life enriched by the gift of your friendship, encouragement and support for nearly sixty years.\n\nThank you, dear Liz.\n\nMy sincere condolences go to Ollie, her family and all who will miss her deeply.\n\nLouise Whitaker\n\nLiz was the kindest warmest and most thoughtful of people. She went out of her way always to welcome me and my family to Somerville. I shall miss her very much and will always remember her especially when I return to her (and my) beloved Somerville. Rest in peace, lovely Liz.\n\nCaroline Barron\n\nI am devastated to learn that Liz has died: she seemed the sort of person who would be able to overcome all obstacles. She was a remarkable Somervillian whose energy, intellect and warmth successfully encouraged many of us to reconnect with our College. Liz was a conduit of good will: she remembered who we were and what we were doing, but at the same time she was completely unsentimental. She was crisp, direct and yet completely compassionate. The love and admiration we all felt for Liz was refracted onto our College. I am so glad that I knew her, and I think she knew, although she would not have admitted it, how much we all loved her.\n\nAmanda Goodman\n\nOne of the main reasons I kept coming back to Somerville, helping with Media Days and the college magazine was Liz Cooke. Her kindness, energy and support were unsurpassed. She was a great ambassador for our college and a valued friend.\n\nElizabeth Philipps (Black)\n\nI was very sad to hear of Liz’s death. I have read the many tributes to her and what is so marked is the appreciation of her kindness, her incredible commitment to Somerville and how she could involve us as alumnae in the continuing life of the College. I had contact with Liz when I was part of the London Lawyers Group. She was always so friendly but not ingratiating or ever insincere. I always enjoyed meeting her. I send my condolences to her son Ollie and we will all miss her.\n\nSarah Wyles (Ryle)\n\nLiz’s talent for making so many people feel they have a unique contribution to bring, her wisdom, judgement and sense of humour, have created a community of Somervillians undoubtedly greater than the sum of its parts. At a time when even the older, male-r colleges were only beginning to wake up to what an alumni community could be, Liz put Somerville ahead in this respect. She was never too busy, and always interested: no wonder so many have commented that she made them feel as if they were part of an extended, college family.\n\nLiz has been a constant (in both senses), respected and treasured presence to me for more than three decades: I will miss her incredibly and always remember her with love and affection.\n\nNiluka Kavanagh\n\nLiz was a hugely kind lady who had some mighty wit, too. Her complete dedication to Somerville was something I saw from student to alumna – she was always so responsive and willing to help. As part of the Somerville fabric, I know she’ll be hugely missed. May she rest in peace.\n\nCatherine Oppenheimer\n\nWe remember Liz with great affection and respect. She was brilliant at keeping contact, with kindness and persistence, with the less gregarious alumni among us, always making them feel welcome and appreciated at College events.\n\nFiona KA Gatty\n\nI had lunch with Liz very recently in College. She was thin, and frail, but as ever she was bright as a button, encouraging and supportive, full of news and ideas, and good book recommendations. We made a plan to meet again next term, so it was a shock to read that she had passed away so suddenly, even though it was clear to both of us she was ill.\n\nI was an undergraduate at Somerville in the eighties, so only got to know her as an alumna; then more recently when I came back to do my graduate studies between 2006-14. It was then I got to know her, and I was also lucky enough to visit her in Great Tew. She was fun, bright and really liked people – and they really liked her. During my time as Chapel Director she was supportive and encouraging, and I will really miss her and our occasional lunches. I know she was the force behind Somerville’s Alumni Relations, and that it had a huge impact on the college, and the broader university, but she was modest and self-effacing about it, which is one of the reasons why she was so admired and liked by everyone.\n\nWhen we last met, she recommended a book to me. It is sitting on my bedside table as a material reminder of her presence, her charm and her intelligence. I will miss her enormously, and send my deep condolences to Ollie, and to the Somerville community to whom she was such an integral part.\n\nHelen Johnson\n\nI was so sorry to hear of the passing of dear Liz Cooke.\n\nShe was so wonderful and was a great asset to Somerville. She took time for everyone she knew. I remember when I first started at Somerville, she sat me down and had a lovely chat with me. She was a lovely, lovely lady.\n\nShe will be sadly missed by everyone who knew her.\n\nJenny Pares\n\nI am so sorry to hear this sad news. Liz and I were tutorial partners when we came to Somerville in 1964. We worked through British history together and I had to be on my toes to keep up with her.\n\nHer love for and commitment to Somerville were clear in her work, but as lightly worn as her scholarship. Having ‘our’ Liz keeping us in touch made the contact so much more personal and warm – and it will be greatly missed.\n\nEileen Gartside\n\nSo very sorry to hear that Liz has passed away. She was a lovely, gentle and warm person who enriched the lives of all those who met her. She will be greatly missed by all and my sincere condolences go to her family. God bless and rest in peace now, Liz.\n\nMadeleine Ruehl\n\nLast time I attended a Somerville event, I was deeply saddened to hear how seriously ill Liz then was. I was therefore not surprised to hear the news when she passed on, but I became aware of an empty space where she used to be. Alumni events will never be the same without her calm efficiency, her welcoming smile and her gift for recognition and inclusion. Over the years she provided a continuity which will prove hard to replace.\n\nI would like to offer my condolences to her family, close friends and colleagues. I was never all that close to Liz, but I can imagine that she will be very sorely missed by those that were.\n\nSarah Gibson\n\nA year ago I enjoyed an email conversation with Liz about swifts. I’d told her about my book – Swifts and Us – and she was thrilled as she loved these birds. She wrote of when she moved to her home in north Oxfordshire 43 years ago when ‘it was one of life’s great pleasures to sit in the garden in the evening watching and listening to the dozens of swifts swirling overhead’. Now, she wrote, there were none. I suggested she put up a swift box or two and she sounded really keen to try this. It was lovely to talk with her and share our love of these extraordinary birds.\n\nCaroline Willbourne\n\nLiz and I were young barristers together at a time when the profession was male-dominated. She had a sharp tongue which she used to good effect in recounting court anecdotes.\n\nI always found her stimulating and fun to be with, but I owed her a particular debt of gratitude when she took me in after I had been made temporarily homeless by a flood. I spent a lovely month with her in her flat in West Kensington and came to know the area quite well. I had been living in trendy Islington, so this was a culture change for me.\n\nI lost touch with her more recently although we did have tea together (usually at Somerville) whenever I was in Oxford. Her death is sad news indeed.\n\nHazel Lucas (Craddock)\n\nThank you Liz for being so warm and friendly, making me feel welcome and that I belonged, even after a long absence. You have done a superb job and will be sorely missed.\n\nLinda Salt\n\nLiz was such a good friend, warmly welcoming all of us at Alumni events. Her smiling encouragement was very helpful to me over many years, and I will remember those conversations, especially during Covid over Zoom.\n\nMy sincere condolences go to her family and assure them that Liz will be remembered by so many Somervillians with fondness.\n\nRuth Crawford\n\nLiz was a truly extraordinary person. She had an encyclopaedic memory of generations of Somervillians and always welcomed us with warmth and a genuine interest in our lives. I marvelled at her ability to bring people together and her tireless devotion to College. I was fortunate to get to know Liz better during my time as a member of the Somerville London Group committee and the group’s book club and it was always a pleasure to spend time in her company. She gave so much to so many and will be sorely missed. My condolences go to Ollie and her family and to her colleagues at Somerville.\n\nHelen Haddon\n\nI have many affectionate memories of Liz, from working with her on the Somerville London Group in the 1990s to enjoying her warm and welcoming presence at countless alumni events in Somerville and London. It is surely very much thanks to Liz, and her tireless work over the years that the college continues to play a part in the lives of so many of us long after we graduated. Thank you Liz.\n\nGinny Stacey\n\nMy best wishes to Liz’s family and to the college. Liz was a lovely person to engage with as an alumni of the college and as a year rep. Gentle, thoughtful, attentive. A loss indeed.\n\nKati Whitaker\n\nLiz has been a wonderful supportive member of Somerville for many years. She encouraged me to participate as an alumni particularly with the media group. Always interested in what everyone was doing. She was a fixture at any Somerville event but most importantly the most generous, warm person. We will miss you, Liz.\n\nJudith Buttigieg\n\nI feel so privileged to have known Liz and counted her as a dear friend for many years. I was deeply saddened to hear of her passing and will miss her terribly.\n\nIt seems inconceivable to imagine Somerville without Liz – she both embodied and enriched the college and our alumni community in a profound way. Somerville will never be the same without her but her immense legacy will live on, never forgotten, and ever testimony to the wonderful and amazing person that was Liz.\n\nRest in peace, Liz. My heartfelt condolences to Ollie and family.\n\nYolanda Powell\n\nI was shocked and saddened to learn that Liz had died. I knew her mainly from her role with the alumni and always found her to be enthusiastic, very helpful and enormously encouraging. One of her great gifts was her genuine interest in people – she listened well. Her warmth, positive outlook and indefatigable work for and on behalf of alumni will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nSally Prentice\n\nI was deeply saddened to read that Liz’s life has come to an end, and offer my deep condolences to Ollie, Liz’s wider family, close friends and everyone at Somerville, but especially the Alumni team.\n\nI will miss Liz enormously and treasure my memories of Liz’s generosity, kindness and shrewd observations of people, places and events. In January 2022 Liz cooked me a delicious lunch at Great Tew: smoked salmon, coq au vin and chocolate mousse. I also remember being somewhat surprised by Liz’s comments about the passenger footbridge at Charlbury Station, which she considered an unnecessary expense: in decades gone by, passengers disembarking from the train had simply walked across the track when there were no trains approaching!\n\nThis vignette captures what I will most miss about Liz: her politics were different from mine, but we could nevertheless have an enjoyable and interesting discussion on many issues.\n\nI came to know Liz well through the Somerville London Group Book Club, where she was brilliant company – whether contributing interesting facts about well-known Somervillians by their number of lovers or who was the only person to refuse an honorary degree, or indeed being clear when standards were not being maintained. With one non-fiction book Liz, was very clear that the annotation on the maps and the quality of the index was not up to scratch: subjects I confess to having never given much thought to.\n\nI admired Liz’s exceptional people skills, her high standards and her resilience – there must have been times when running the Somerville Association was not straightforward – but above all I thought Liz was one of the most astute people I had ever met. Her approach to the Somerville Association, focusing on excellent speakers, friendship and fun, was far sighted, laying an excellent foundation for fundraising, but retaining an important distinction between the two. From conversations with friends at other colleges, this does not feel universal.\n\nIt was a privilege to know Liz and her legacy is remarkable one.\n\nFrances Stewart\n\nLiz was an amazing ambassador for Somerville among alumni, providing a warm and enthusiastic link with the College. I attended many alumni events in London and she was invariably present, seemed to know everyone, have time to talk to everyone and make everyone feel valued. Her dedication, energy and warmth are irreplaceable. She will be much missed in the College and across the alumni.\n\nGordon Hamilton\n\nSeeing Liz Cooke was always one of the great joys of coming back to Somerville over the years. Her warmth and kindness were so genuine and, as many have already written, she always took a deep interest in everyone. She was an exceptional person and the College will not be the same without her. She will be much missed. I send my sympathies to her family.\n\nAnne Seaton\n\nLiz’s death is very sad news. She had a special knack of turning Somerville contacts into friendships, so that a lot of Somervillians will feel her death personally. Her organisational skills were admirable, though unobtrusive – being involved with her in setting up the occasional event was always an enjoyable experience.\n\nSarah Stepney\n\nIt was with great shock that I read of the sad passing of Liz Cooke. She was the first person at Somerville who I had contact with after accepting my place and she answered the, probably very gauche, questions of someone who was the first in her family to go to university with tact and grace. She was at every alumni event that I attended over the years and was always so welcoming. I now wish that I had attended more. The last time I “saw” her was on a Zoom Call that college had set up as part of one of the virtual Alumni weekends during lockdown, so that we were still able to connect with fellow Somervillians. I remember commenting that I did not feel that I had achieved as much as some others in my year group and she reassured me that everyone’s contribution matters. Hers more than most as she touched so many lives. Next time circumstances permit that I can attend a future alumni event, there will be a void where she should be and they will never be quite the same again.\n\nFrank Prochaska\n\nFurther to Alice’s message, we have lost a dear friend who will be greatly missed by the College and her countless admirers, as witnessed by the exceptional number of messages of condolence. We had lunch with Liz a few weeks before her death and she was, as ever, on sparkling form despite her illness.\n\nSusan Mary Anthony (Farrow)\n\nI am deeply sorry and shocked to hear that Liz is dead. I Have never known anyone more truly and self-effacingly welcoming and kind. She made Somerville still feel like home 60 years after leaving.What shall we all do without her?\n\nAngela Gillibrand\n\nMany thanks to Liz for getting me more engaged with the Somerville community and back in touch with fellow students. I will miss her.\n\nNiloufer Markler Reifler\n\nLiz was always welcoming, always kind and always there.\n\nShe will be much missed.\n\nAlmut Suerbaum\n\nLiz was an extraordinary colleague: a committed Somervillian to the core, gently puzzled by those of us who had not been students at Somerville, yet bringing us all into the fold. She was both very private and welcoming to everyone; pragmatic and practical as well as kind and warm; direct, with a wry sense of humour yet also a model of diplomacy. She rarely talked about herself, preferring just to get on with things, though the delight she took in her family and her beautiful garden shone through all conversations with her, and her skill in bringing people together and giving them a sense of belonging was legendary across the university. We will miss her so much – but the sense of community she forged at so many levels will be her lasting legacy. Remembering her with gratitude, admiration, and love.\n\nSophie Agrell\n\nLiz was a Somerville contemporary of my mother, Kamini Wickremesinghe (MCR 1964) and went out of her way to make me feel welcome and at home when I came up to Somerville in 1992. Her door was always open. I used to visit her in her small office when I, an only child often ill at ease with my peers, felt the need of some adult company. I found her warmth and kindness reassuring and she always made me feel she had time – a rare gift. Her long distance friendship continued intermittently by email for 30 years. She was invariably interested, kind and warm. I, like so many others, shall miss her.\n\nSheila Mawby\n\nSuch devastating news. Liz has been such a constant and supportive friend to me for so long, it is hard to imagine Somerville without her welcoming presence. She had an amazing talent for remembering and taking an interest in all alumnae / alumni , of all ages and status, and making us all feel that we belonged to the wonderful community of Somervillians. (Never ‘Ex-‘ ! ) She was, indeed, a tower of strength at the heart of the Somerville community and will be greatly missed by us all. Condolences to her family and to all at Somerville.\n\nAnna Barber\n\nAs for so many others, Liz Cooke was my “address” at Somerville during all of the four decades since my studies there. I live in a less-than-tranquil place, and she stayed in touch, even sending a personal letter of concern when things were more unsettled than usual. On my few return visits to Oxford, we communicated before and during. (Little did Liz know she had also taken on the role of accommodation consultant!)\n\nIt was very moving to see her less than two months ago, when my fellow Holtbyites and I had the opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation in person. Her memory will be cherished by Somervillians near and far, myself among them.\n\nToni Coffee\n\nMy life in Oxford was enriched beyond measure by knowing Liz Cooke and it is truly painful to imagine what it will be like without her.\n\nI was introduced to Liz by the wonderful Dame Anne Warburton who thought that, as an American who was a part-time resident of Oxford and past editor of my own college magazine, I might be helpful to Liz by writing articles for the Somerville alumnae publication. Over the next several years I had the pleasure and privilege of interviewing dozens of remarkable Somervillians who were happy to talk with me as soon as they heard that Liz had suggested it. She knew everyone and everyone knew and loved her.\n\nI think I was indeed helpful to Liz (and to Somerville), but my help cannot approach the value of what I gained from her. Her warmth and charm and generosity of spirit were without limit and she went out of her way at every opportunity to assure my welcome in the Somerville community. It is a connection I shall always treasure and her friendship is a gift I can never replace. She was a magnificent human being and I am shattered by her loss.\n\nDominique Vaughan Williams\n\nLiz Cooke provided the thread which kept me tied to the Alumni events over the last 40 years.\n\nShe was at the events, ready with an open smile which made me feel recognised and welcome – something increasingly precious over the years.\n\nI will remember her with great fondness and send my condolences to friends and family.\n\nRosemary Raza\n\nLiz was hugely important in drawing Somervillians back to the college, and maintaining close relations. Always interested, always friendly and kind, she was a focal point for so many reunions. On a personal level, I will greatly miss her interest and support. Thank you, Liz, for everything.\n\nMargaret Mann\n\nI met Liz through our joint connection with Somerville and she quickly became a friend. Her warm interest in Somerville and its students was unfailing. I shall miss her enormously.\n\nJacky Clements\n\nI was deeply saddened to read of Liz Cooke’s death. She was warm, enthusiastic and welcoming, not to mention quietly efficient – qualities much in evidence when I helped to organise the 1969 “golden reunion”. She had the remarkable gift of making those of us who left the College nearly 50 years ago feel as though we still mattered to it.\n\nMark Ealey (Lodge Manager)\n\nI’m very saddened by the passing of Liz. She was always such a delightful, pleasant and caring person, an absolute asset to Somerville who was always so totally professional. Sleep well, Liz.\n\nJenny Bacon\n\nI was so saddened to hear that Liz Cooke had passed away. What an inspirational lady. Unfailingly warm, friendly, good humoured and genuinely loved hearing news and welcoming us all back to Somerville. It will never be the same without her but how lucky we have all been to have her presence at Somerville. She will be sadly missed at our upcoming Gaudy in a few weeks but I am glad I had the chance to see her last year for Dame Fiona Caldicott’s Memorial. RIP, Liz, and thank you for everything you did to enrich the college experience for so many of us.\n\nRose Briant\n\nThank you, Liz, for your unstinting support, warmth and interest; so very much appreciated.\n\nVicky Maltby (Foundation Fellow)\n\nIt is virtually impossible to imagine Somerville without Liz, and I echo the many tributes already on this page. Her death is a great shock, yet it seems somehow appropriate that she never retired, and was continuing to contribute to College life to the end. Her legacy is immense, and will influence alumni relations and College development far into the future. My condolences to Ollie and her wider family.\n\nLiz was my constant contact with Somerville since 1956 and she was my friend. I will miss her warmth and generous spirit. I last saw her in May for the 1953 reunion. She was there for us despite battling ill health, always positive and caring. I feel so grateful to have known her. My heart goes out to Ollie and all those who bear this loss.\n\nI had been only tangentially in touch with Somerville for many years when I contacted Liz with a proposal for a little art exhibition at the college. I was almost taken aback by how (quietly) kind and positive she was. I have seen a bit more of her in recent years and her calm friendliness has been entirely consistent. I am truly sorry to hear she has left us.\n\nLiz Cooke did so much for the Somerville community, keeping the Alumni connected. She was always such a warm and welcoming presence. She’ll be greatly missed.\n\nWill I ever be able to go back to Somerville knowing that Liz would not be there to welcome me?\n\nI am so sorry to hear about Liz Cooke’s death. She was such a warm, friendly & vital person that it does not seem credible that she has died. I remember her particularly in connection with organising & being present at many, very enjoyable events held by the Somerville London Group. She was an excellent organiser in an unobtrusive way. She always displayed an intelligent & real interest in what one told her. But most of all, I shall remember her smile & her great courage in facing serious illness.\n\nDear Ollie,\n\nI am so very sorry to hear of Liz’s death. I knew that she was ill and deeply regret not visiting her over the last few months. I came to Somerville in the 1990s, not having been an Oxford alumna before that, and she became a real friend. We shared several interests, particularly Wagner, and her involvement in Medical alamnui events was always discrete but clearly evident and absolutely essential. As I am sure you will hear repeatedly, she was a remarkable and much loved figure around the College and will be very sorely missed.\n\nWith sincere condolences to you and all other members of Liz’s family,\n\nAngela Vincent (Bruno’s mother)\n\nEmeritus Fellow\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Somerville without her – thank you for all your great work Liz. Lisa, losing a colleague you have worked so closely with for many years is like losing a family member and I know how much you are going to miss her – all my love, Elenore\n\nLiz Cooke’s warm welcome always added to the pleasure of return visits to Somerville.\n\nIn memory of a wonderful woman!\n\nThank you for being a constant in the ever-changing world\n\nRIP.\n\nIt seems unthinkable that Liz’s warm welcome, with a smile and a hug, will no longer be available at every Somerville event.\n\nMany will pay tribute to her devotion and commitment to Somerville; cumulatively, they may add up to nearing the full extent of her contribution to alumnae (and alumni) relations. Her formidable memory for people and her ability to focus on the individual she was speaking to was extraordinary, and was at the service of the College for so many years. The full extent of her efficient organisational skills will be known only to her colleagues, but could occasionally be glimpsed by the rest of us when an inevitable glitch arose and she quietly slipped away to sort it out.\n\nIt was a privilege to be her friend. We held polar opposite views on most things like politics and religion, but that was by-passed by the essence of friendship and mutual respect. She created a wonderful home in her amazing house and beautiful garden at Great Tew.\n\nThe void at our sixtieth reunion in 2024 will yawn. For all that Liz did for the College, for the year of 1964, she was ‘ours’.\n\nAs I come to this page only twenty-four hours after it appeared, I’m struck by the wonderful messages — so very many of them already, and Liz would have been totally astonished. Each name would have brought a reminiscent smile to her face.\n\nI wrote to her just last week, with a message from the three living Somervillians in my family (my sister, my daughter and me) and she wrote back appreciatively. Here’s a slightly edited version.\n\n“We want you to know, just in case you don’t already, how fantastically you are valued by the Somerville community. Claire was saying, this afternoon, what an amazing job you have done of creating this community – not just fostering it, but really making it work in the first place. She said, ‘Do you think Liz knows how much she is valued? Does she know what she has achieved?” – and then gave me examples, of which the most recent in her experience was the work you put into the commemoration of Katherine Duncan Jones.\n\nMy own experience of the way you have made this community of alumni and supporters work is huge – and too much to tire you out with chapter and verse. I’ll just say a few things. First of all, when I became Principal, quite a few people both within the College and from the alumni community, said anxiously to me “You *must* make sure Liz Cooke stays on.” I counted it one of my first tasks, to make sure that you had no doubt of being needed, wanted and immensely valued, and I was proud that you did want to stay when I was Principal (2010-17). I know Jan feels similarly proud now.\n\nYou have made generations of Somervillians feel they are valued and welcome as part of this exceptional college community. They amount to thousands. Your diligent work with them, and your interest in them (not to mention very considerable patience with some!) is what accounts for their loyalty to and love for the college. When I arrived as Principal in 2010, I very soon learned that you are legendary among the alumni officers of the Oxford colleges. A friend who for some time chaired the St Hugh’s alumni association, speaks envyingly of your reputation – and she is only one example. Nermeen and her predecessors, of course, are very much aware of what an extraordinary asset you are. There is something quite special about the way Somervillians connect with the history and future of this exceptional college – a beacon in the life of the University and also – and this is what you have so brilliantly exploited and developed – a wonderful influence in the life of our alumni. You have played a huge part personally in making that happen – more than any other individual.\n\nI don’t want to embarrass you and I don’t want to make this email even longer … but Claire and Elizabeth and I, just three of your admiring fans, do want to make sure you realise what a very special contribution you’ve been making, over these many years.\n\nI just wanted you to know that you are very much in the minds of very many Somervillians.”\n\nI shall miss Liz, too. She has been a calm and warm figure at some key moments in my life. Take her response in 2010 to my having a baby at the age of 52; this seems to me to sum up her wonderful qualities:\n\n“How lovely to hear from you! Many congratulations on Esme – she looks adorable. Are you OK? Tired, I’m sure! But it’s really a wonderful story and I am sure lots of other Somervillians would find it inspiring, if you would eventually care to write about it. I shall look forward to seeing you before too long; take care of yourself in the meantime. Warmest good wishes. Liz”.\n\nAs so many others have written, Liz was the face of Somerville, a vital link to the college for those of us who live abroad. We met infrequently – the last time was the 1969 50-year reunion – but it was always a pleasure. And between times, there was that familiar name on the correspondence. I will always remember her with affection and gratitude.\n\nTo her family, my sincere sympathy.\n\nI knew Liz from the time she came up to Somerville. She was always friendly and helpful to deal with and having someone at college like her formed part of the links which were forged so long ago. She will be greatly missed by everyone.\n\nLiz was such an inspiration! Her careful attention to nurturing the special relationships she had with Somerville’s alumni had me in awe….. She was warm and generous with her time and knew just how to make each alumnus/a feel special and highly valued. Somerville is such a special place and much of that is down to Liz and her long-standing commitment to the community.\n\nWe were so very sorry to learn of Liz’s death. The term, ‘beating heart of Somerville’, really encapsulates her role over the past quarter of a century or so. Liz often said that she simply enjoyed talking to Somervillians. Her welcoming smile was a constant feature of events at Somerville and elsewhere, and made us all feel truly included in the Somerville family.\n\nIn practical terms Liz’s amazing role in extending alumni relations must have been of key help to the Development Committee, and have played a significant role in their successful fundraising campaigns to improve the College’s endowments.\n\nIt is fitting that Liz died in her beautiful cottage where I was once privileged to stay overnight. My husband Edmund and I, remembering inter alia Liz’s hospitality at A Burns Night supper about 20 years ago, send our deepest condolences to her son and other family. I very much hope to be at her College Memorial Service when we can all pay public tribute to a dear and very distinguished Somervillian.\n\nSuch wonderful memories of Liz over many, many years. She did a great job keeping in touch with us, always recognising us and welcoming us so warmly at Gaudys, garden parties and memorial services. We shall miss her dearly.\n\nLiz was the kindly, welcoming face of Somerville at alumni gatherings for so many years. Being close to her in age and interests (we were History scholars in successive years), and living in the same area of West Oxon., I counted her as a personal friend and feel bereft at her loss.\n\nSo very sorry to hear of Liz’s death. She will be much missed, not least for her cheerful good sense, kindness, and sheer likeability. A great asset to Somerville, and a great advertisement for the College.\n\nVery sorry to hear this sad news about Liz. She was also so kind when I contacted the college. Sending lots of love to her family, friends and colleagues.\n\nI was very saddened to hear of the death of Liz Cooke. I knew her in the context of the medics group during the last 20 years and more recently the anniversary of the 60th year of matriculation in 1962. She was such a considerate and great organiser and so loyal and proud of Somerville. She represented a generation of Somervillians who battled such prejudice as women but she was always positive. A lovely person who will be missed.\n\nIt was such a joy to know Liz, and I will miss her cheerful welcome at events. Liz became a role model for how to sustain consistent friendships and never wavered in her positive support to me and so many others. From the City Group through to countless London Group meetings and ideas, Liz brought people together quietly and thoughtfully. Sending condolences to Ollie and the family, as well as Liz’s close friends and colleagues.\n\nI am truly saddened to learn that Liz has left us. My deepest sympathies to her family. Liz has been so important to me and to my late mother Nan Steedman (Saunders, 1936) – and, I’m sure, many others – in her encouraging and robustly downplayed kindness. Liz had a gift for welcoming, for helping senior members overcome diffidence (in my case) about attending events at Somerville and for being a huge part, with the Principals, of making Somerville kinder and warm and interesting. She saw how people felt and I hope she realised how much we loved her.\n\nI ever remember Liz appearing on the village green in far North Yorkshire for my mother’s funeral in 2007, bringing Nan’s great friend Jean Wilks (1936) by car and bearing condolences from Somerville. She was the most helpful of women, seemingly unflappable and humorous, so kind and intelligent and, when I last saw her, brave.\n\nDear Liz, I can’t believe that we shall not see you anymore. You represented Somerville to me on so many occasions, not least my late husband’s funeral. I’m not sure what Somerville will feel like now that you will no longer be there. I am so sorry; your wise, gentle, approachable and friendly nature will be missed by those who knew you for all time.\n\nI am so sad to read this. Liz was a wonderful person, who seemed to make everyone she met feel really valued. Her work for Somerville, both as an ambassador and quietly behind the scenes, will be very hard indeed to replace.\n\nI hardly knew her as an undergraduate, but got to know her better over the last few years, once we had discovered that we lived only about 20 miles apart. We met sometimes for lunch, and quite apart from her wide-ranging conversation, her house and garden were such a pleasure to visit. I will miss her as a a friend, and Somerville as a part of its spirit.\n\nLiz, you did so much to keep us in regular touch with Somerville. Your welcoming smile was part of almost every visit. We will miss you so much.\n\nWhat very sad news. I much enjoyed Liz’s company in College, over the years, and, like so many, I hugely appreciated her uniquely devoted, brilliant and indefatigable work for the entire community of Somervillians. It was always a delight to meet Liz in College or at a Somerville event, and to catch up and share thoughts and opinions – hers always clearly and vigorously expressed. She’ll be so much missed by us all. Deepest sympathies to Ollie and her family.\n\nI shall miss your warmth and wicked and wry humour, Liz. From the moment I arrived at Somerville, as the first “mixed” fellow in 1992, until we last talked, earlier this year, you have shown such kindness and interest in our science and in each of us associated with our beloved College\n\nShe will be missed a lot….. Sleep well in another peaceful world. My heart breaks….\n\nI am so sorry to hear this. Liz was so kind, so energetic, so thoughtful, so positive. Her enthusiasm was infectious, her sense of fun vivid, her love of our college unconditional. It was a pleasure and an honour to know her. She will not be forgotten.\n\nLiz really was at the heart of Somerville for so many years. She made a significant contribution to the College and College life.\n\nLiz will be much missed by me and so many others. Her family and friends will be in my thoughts.\n\nSad news indeed. During my years of retirement I have come to appreciate Liz as a key figure who helped to build on my enthusiasm and affection for Somerville, and, I’m sure, that of many others also.\n\nLiz was wonderful and organised so many good events at Somerville She\n\nlived near me and often mentioned that I should visit her. I finally got there last summer to a wonderful lunch in her beautiful garden. I am really sad to hear the news. My condolences to her family and all her friends.\n\nSo sad to hear this news. Liz was the reason I got back involved with Somerville College, having left in 1987. Her warmth, kindness, and inclusivity to all alumni was inspiring and inviting. Thank you, Liz. Rest in peace.\n\nA truly lovely person, and a wonderful asset to the College\n\nLiz was lightness and brightness and pure beautiful welcoming warmth.\n\nShe was an electromagnetic force attracting Somervillians back to the mothership, reminding us we were always welcome and that we would always, always belong.\n\nShe made me more of a Somervillian. I think she made many of us more of a Somervillian.\n\nWhat a gift.\n\nLiz will be greatly missed. Every time I had dealings with her, she was exceptionally friendly and helpful. She even tracked down my old bedroom so that I could stay in it again on a return visit many years later.\n\nVery sad to hear this news-will be forever grateful to Liz Cooke for her thoughtful and sensitive response to my late husband Gavin ‘s passing. My condolences to her family.\n\nA beacon of Somerville continuity. She will be much missed.\n\nI was shocked to hear of Liz’s untimely passing. Liz was an amazing individual, doing so much for so many people.\n\nWhen I was in the City Group, she came to meetings in London and helped organise events. She was always kind and generous with her time, in particular with my aunt Christina Roaf, who was one of Somerville’s elderly emeritus academics for many years.\n\nLiz was definitely a one-off and a major loss to Somerville and us all.\n\nSo very sad to hear of Liz’s death. She was such a lovely person – she embodied all that was special about Somerville. She was amazing in the way she remembered us all, knew all about us and cared so much. She was immensely good to my mother and me when we attended alumnae events. It’s hard to believe she’s no longer there: she will not be forgotten.\n\nI am very sorry to hear of Liz’s passing. She did so much to create a warm Somerville community for those of us who had left. I will particularly remember her warmth when Michala Emmett was tragically killed and the support she gave setting up the memorial fund. Thoughts with her family.\n\nLiz was a fixed point at Somerville, *the* fixed point. She was the same cohort as me (1964), and so I was surprised that she had been alumnæ/i officer only since 1988—it seemed that she had always been there, kind, helpful and, I don’t know, *knowledgeable*? And she was a good friend. She was irreplaceable and will be much missed.\n\nLiz could not have been more helpful as well as interested every time we were in touch.\n\nShe helped me apply for and win an Alice Horsman grant when setting up Shakespeare in Italy.\n\nMy questions never seemed to faze her.\n\nIndefatigable and understated, to me Liz epitomised a gentle, kind and ever-hearing voice. She was a rare person in the white noise of today’s world.\n\nWhat a loss to Somerville, but how lucky to have had her amongst us.\n\nI only met Liz Cooke once, at a Somerville event. She went out of her way to chat, and could not have been more friendly and welcoming. I think also she did a great deal to make us old Somervillians feel part of the Somerville family.\n\nSo sad to hear the news about Liz. I always appreciated the warm greeting she gave at Alumni events and the time she had for everyone. She loved Somerville and worked tirelessly for the Somerville community. She will be much missed. My thoughts are with her family in their loss. Kathy Fricker.\n\nWith heartfelt thanks to Liz for all her dedication to the Somerville Association and making sure all the alumni continued to feel part of the Somerville community.\n\nLiz Cooke will be very much missed. She did a marvelous job of efficiently organising so many alumni events and became everyone’s friend.\n\nThank you so much, dear Liz, for all your welcoming, which made us feel known and valued across the years, and for your appreciation of what we had to offer. Thank you too for your hospitality, and for your beautiful garden. You really did enrich the world.\n\nWith love from Jenifer\n\nThank you, Liz, for all you did for alumnae and alumni relations. You brought home to us the importance of our time at Somerville and the influence it has had on our whole lives.\n\nYour accuracy and swiftness of response and circulating information were admirable. I was also very pleased that you were a fellow Oxford historian!\n\nHeartfelt thanks and congratulations for all you did, for all of us, for all those years. You will always be in our minds and hearts.\n\nLove, Judith\n\nI am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Liz. She was such an incredible and instrumental force at the development office. Her legacy, her work, her spirit, will always stay with us in memory.\n\nI remember my last conversation with Liz in Singapore circa 2015-2016, where she was energetic and enthusiastically speaking on the development and recent changes at Somerville.\n\nThe development’s office work is deeply critical in fostering our strong sense of identity as a “Somervillian” and we will forever be grateful in having this lifelong sense of community and friendship around us.\n\nRest in Peace.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRilly Chen\n\nI have very fond memories of Liz . She was always so warm and welcoming to us all when we returned for reunions or just dropped by in college to say hello. She had a phenomenal memory for names and an ability to recall events in all our lives which made conversations with her very special. Please give my heartfelt condolences to Ollie and to her family . Liz will be missed and loved always in our memories.\n\nLiz has been so wonderful helping me maintain my connection with Somerville, I have always been glad to see her name pop up in my emails.\n\nSending my condolences to her family and to Somerville – she will be greatly missed.\n\nMy heart is heavy today. Liz befriended me when I returned to Somerville as a mature graduate student after an abortive career in law. She, too, had given up the bar after successfully practising for some years. She summed up what is best about Somervillians: strength, elegance, keen interest in other people, concern about the world. I will cherish memories of laughter-filled conversations at Formal Halls, being driven to London for alumni events by Liz (ace driver that she was), candlelit Christmases at Great Tew, watching films in her ‘bothy’ along with Katherine Duncan-Jones. It feels as though something fine and irreplaceable has passed with her. I will miss her dreadfully, and send my condolences to Ollie and the rest of her family.\n\nLiz was an amazing and passionate Somervillian and was for many years, single- handedly responsible for nurturing the alumni and organizing interesting events for us all. She will be much- missed and having sat with her and Lisa for lunch at this years Medical day, I have a recent personal reminder of her quiet intelligent charm.\n\nAlways calm, always helpful, always knowledgeable, and with a wicked sense of humour. Thank you for all you did for us Somervillians – even the awkward squad like me. Somerville really isn’t the same without you there. Rest in peace, dear friend.\n\nI got to know Liz so much more after our time as students. Whenever I met her, for college events , or projects, or just popping in, she was always curious, interested, encouraging and energetic; her presence full of kindness but also a perceptive intelligence that let you know where she stood! There is now a Liz-shaped gap at Somerville.\n\nI only met Liz a few times but was on each occasion delighted and impressed by her warm friendliness. I shall miss her in the future.\n\nVery sorry to hear of the death of Liz Cooke. I will miss her warmth and friendship. She will be irreplaceable.\n\nLiz was one of the very nicest, most helpful and friendly people I have known. When I was teaching Somerville medical students in the 1990s a lunchtime conversation with her led to the start of the annual Medics Day which continues to link Somerville medical alumni to the College to the benefit of all. It was Liz who did much of the organising of this among her many other tasks.\n\nShe arranged and hosted our year’s 60th reunion in 2014–a very happy occasion and just one of very many alumni events which benefited from her sure touch.\n\nI feel I and the College have lost a true friend and send my sympathy to her family and all who knew her.\n\nAlthough I only met Liz a couple on a couple of occasions she made a lasting impression with her wonderful warm welcome. I am so sorry to hear the sad news and join with many others in sending my condolences to her family and to the Somerville community. I am sure her loss will be felt very deeply.\n\nI can hardly believe it: Liz took so much trouble to make it easy for us real oldies to stay in touch, to appreciate change, to understand where today’s College has come to and is going. It is a privilege to have known her: I shall always be grateful.\n\nAffectionate memories of Liz, who knew so many of us and remembered so much.\n\nIt is difficult for me to believe that Liz will no longer be with us all, supporting Somerville as she did for many years. I feel so sad. Please give my condolences to her family.\n\nI never met Liz in person but came to know her through her letters. She really cared for Somerville and for us, the alumna. Her letters were warm, personal, encouraging, thoughtful, regular. I will miss her.\n\nI only got to know Liz in the last few years but it has been one of the real pleasures of returning to Oxford. She was so friendly, intelligent and interesting, and hospitable in her beautiful Great Tew home and we discovered that we had so many common interests. With her enormous personal warmth, enthusiasm, and unswerving commitment to Somerville she was a wonderful ambassador for it, making us all feel a valued part of the Somerville community. She will be greatly missed by so many of us.\n\nThis is very sad news. Liz was always there, keeping links between Somervillians, and it is very hard to imagine college life without her. Every message from her felt like a warm personal contact. She will be very much missed.\n\nSo sad to hear if Liz’s death. She was a good friend to many of us, and created such a feeling of fellowship. A lovely person.\n\nShe was a wonderful link to the college for alumni like myself. She was a credit to the college and will be fondly remembered.\n\nSad to know about her.\n\nLiz was one of my most loyal and longstanding friends. I only knew her slightly at Somerville, but after I moved to New Zealand 23 years ago we kept in regular email contact, and often met when I was back in Oxford. We had many common interests to talk about, including a love of cats. In September 2022 I attended the memorial for Fiona Caldicott, which she was helping to organise. I could see then that she was unwell, and she told me her diagnosis. Before leaving the country a few days later I had lunch as her guest at High Table, a very pleasant occasion and my last memory of her. I know she made a huge contribution to the life of the College, continuing to work for as long as possible despite her illness, and will be very much missed.\n\nPlease accept my deepest condolences.\n\nLiz Cooke was such a nice person, very kind and always helpful to me while I was in the College and after I returned to Japan. I miss her deeply.\n\nI am shocked and deeply upset that the wonderful Liz is no more. She was a very special person who was dedicated to serve the interests of Somerville College. She will be sorely missed by all those who knew her. My sincerest sympathies to her family.\n\nRemembering Liz as a deeply warm, kind and caring Somervillian, always reaching out in helpful ways to continue the alumni connection with Somerville.\n\nMy meetings with Liz were so warm and wonderful. I will miss her.\n\nLiz was very kind and always very welcoming. I attended some wonderful alumni events hosted by Liz in London. She updated me about Barbara Craig’s health over the years which I greatly appreciated. May her soul rest in peace.\n\nJudith Grossman (Spink)\n\nLiz Cooke was the essential person who kept me linked to the Somerville community, for many decades – and living in the U.S. as I do, that has meant so much to me and many others. I wish I ‘d had more opportunities to thank her for sustaining these connections. We’ll all remember her with much gratitude.\n\nGeoffrey Nyakeriga\n\nYou’ll be greatly missed Liz. Shine on with the angels.\n\nMichele Roberts\n\nDearest Liz, your often expressed love for Somerville was inspiring and moving. Whatever changes happened, you were there, supportive and generous. I remember you with admiration. I am very grateful to have been involved in college events you organised. You had a welcoming humanity that is rare. Love from Michele\n\nCaroline Cracraft\n\nSo very, very sad to learn of Liz’s death.\n\nShe did SO much for Somerville.\n\nRIP\n\nJane Darcy\n\nDear Liz, you were a wonderful woman. I’ll never forget your kindness to me when I was first at Somerville in the 1970s, anxious and lost. You made me feel so at home. And I’ve been touched through the years that you’ve always remembered me. How sad it is to say goodbye to you.\n\nNadine Brummer\n\nI was shocked and sad to hear of Liz Cooke’s death having had recent warm contact with her over the proposed seventieth reunion of our year. She was so attentive and responsive to events in the lives of Somerville’s alumnae and conveyed in person and in her communications a real sense of our continuing connection with the college .\n\nDiana Bennett\n\nShe was always so kind, helpful and efficient-a great loss\n\nSophie Mills\n\nI am so sad to receive this news. I always enjoyed communications from Liz and seeing her at Somervillian functions when I was able to return to England. Rest In Peace, best of Somervillians.\n\nRachel Phipps\n\nSo very sorry to hear of Liz’s death. She was unfailingly kind and hospitable and invited me to Somerville several times, gently bringing me back into the fold. I liked her very much.\n\nPauline Wickham\n\nOh Liz, what a beautiful and wonderful person you are! I write in the present tense because you are alive in our hearts, and will always remain so.\n\nJo Magan\n\nDeeply saddened by this news. Liz was the beating heart of alumni relations and will be greatly missed. Her friendly and genuine interest was very much part of my continuing relationship with Somerville and I feel this as a personal loss. My condolences to Ollie and her Somerville family.\n\nChia-Ching Dawson (née Chang)\n\nFor me, Liz’s outstanding characteristic was her great concern for & interest in the people she encountered. Her friendship will be much missed.\n\nGeraldine Lynch\n\nLiz was a fantastic point of contact after we left Somerville in 2006. She helped me apply for a postgraduate grant and helped my husband organise a surprise daytime birthday do at Somerville. Always keen to help us keep in touch, Liz was Somerville to us after we left and she will be very much missed.\n\nKate Wentworth\n\nCondolences and sympathy for the family and for Somerville. She achieved so much for Somerville and was such a lovely person.\n\nJudy Staples\n\nSo sorry to hear that we have lost Liz. A really exceptional lady: warm, friendly, efficient and very human. She seemed able to recognise and remember so many of us – quite phenomenal. She was especially helpful and proactive on the occasion of our cohort’s 50th anniversary celebrations, to which I was pleased to contribute in a small way. We will miss her very much.\n\nAnne Madden\n\nI’m so very sorry to read this sad news. Liz was always such a welcoming figure at Somerville. She kindly arranged lunch for me and my partner when I visited college a few years ago. She also took me to see inscriptions I contributed to in the new ROQ accommodation block. A great loss to Somerville. From a fellow Historian xx\n\nAlison Wolf (Honorary Fellow)\n\nLiz was just wonderful. Somerville was so, so lucky that she devoted herself to the College and to its alumni. She was also super-determined. From the moment that she decided I might make a good President of the Somerville Association, there wasn’t really the slightest possibility that I would turn the honour down! Equally, a huge benefit of serving was that I got to know Liz better, and appreciate her amazing warmth, kindness, effectiveness and patience, and her staggering knowledge of Somervillians. It’s hard to imagine that she is gone, and miserable to think of Somerville reunions without her, but she leaves a huge legacy.\n\nChristina Le Moignan (Somerville 1960-65)\n\nI greatly appreciated Liz’s effective keeping us in touch with today’s Somerville in a way that would not have been possible otherwise. We are much in her debt. With my thanks, I offer my condolences to all who will miss Liz most.\n\nSonja Ruehl\n\nSo sorry to hear that Liz Cooke has died; pleased that hers was a peaceful departure.\n\nLiz had a dry sense of humour which I much appreciated.\n\nHarriet Proudfoot\n\nDear Liz, very special respectful and thankful memories of all you made possible\n\nfor alumnae/alumni and your always quiet, warm welcome. With love from Harriet (and thanks for returning my hat!).\n\nDebbie Megone\n\nLiz was always warm and full of life. She started many initiatives to keep Somervillians in touch with each other and the College. Our online book club encouraged by Liz and started in lockdown, is still going strong!\n\nRosalind Erskine\n\nLiz was a lovely welcoming introduction to the Somerville Association and a constant presence. So very sorry to lose her.\n\nCatherine McLoughlin\n\nWhat a warm and likeable woman she was.\n\nJane Everson\n\nI am very sorrow to hear of Liz Cooke’s death. Somerville Alumni will not seem the same without her, even though I know the association will continue all the good work she did over so many years. She was always so ready to facilitate contacts, return visits to college, introductions to new fellows and alumni, and always so enthusiastic and interested in one’s doings. May she now rest in peace, and may we carry forward her legacy of support for each other.\n\nMandakranta Bose\n\nI am very sorry indeed to hear the news of Liz’s passing. Over the many years of our friendship she kept alive for me a very personal sense of belonging to the Somervillian community by her personal warmth and her own sense of responsibility to the College. The pandemic kept us apart for the past few years but her memory will remain alive for me.\n\nWith sympathy for her family,\n\nMandakranta Bose\n\nMary Shorter\n\nWhat a shock to hear of Liz’s death! I think of her as such a young Somervillian! A whole seventeen years behind me at Somerville! If that is a recent picture of her, she has certainly changed a lot since I last saw her at the funeral of Nancy Rowlinson in Headington Quarry church in 2012. Of course, she invited me to lunch in college next day. I could write more, but apparently I’m being told to submit.\n\nAnne Kirkman\n\nLiz was an extraordinary woman whose interpretation of her role in the Development Office convinced me and I’m sure many others that she was genuinely interested in Somerville alumnae and not just in the business of fundraising. I shall really miss her kind concern and friendly approach.\n\nCynthia Floud\n\nLiz was such an invaluable member of the Somerville community, with her inviting smile and easy manner; no wonder alumni relations thrived with her great contribution. It is hard for me to imagine Somerville without her.\n\nI appreciated her encouragement to attend and report on funerals of old members when she was unable to attend herself. Thank you, Liz\n\nSue Canderton (Hutchison)\n\nI am so very sad to hear of Liz’s passing. She has been an absolute stalwart of Somerville alumni relations for more years than I can remember – a delightfully familiar presence at so many events, in College and further afield. And, recently, I had the pleasure of joining her for wonderfully interesting discussions in the Somerville London Book Group – what a privilege. I considered her a friend. Somerville has a truly wonderful alumni programme. 36 years since I first stepped through those great wooden doors as an undergraduate, I have never felt so much part of this precious family – and Liz played a huge part in that. Thank You, Liz, you will be very much missed. May you rest in peace.\n\nDakota Hamilton\n\nShe wasn’t just the “face” of Somerville – she WAS Somerville. My deepest condolences to her family.\n\nAnn Rolinson\n\nSo sorry to hear the news. It’s a loss for all of us. She was the soul of College, and very wise and sensitive. It was a great privilege to know her. College won’t be the same without her.\n\nSally Browne\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Liz. A wonderful advocate for Somerville and for all alumni. Alumni events won’t be the same without seeing her. Sincere condolences to her family.\n\nMoira Black\n\nWhat sad news.\n\nI only came across Liz through the Somerville Association but she was always helpful, cheerful and a delight to spend time with. She was very valuable to the College in furthering the development of the Association. I shall miss her enormously.\n\nHer family have my very deepest sympathy.\n\nFiona Green\n\nI am very sad to hear this news. I really didn’t know Liz well but I always so enjoyed her company when I met at Somerville events. She worked incredibly hard for us all and will be much missed.\n\nJane Dickers\n\nSo very saddened to hear the news of Liz’s death. It is difficult to imagine Somerville without her. She absolutely embodied our College values and gave unhesitatingly of her warmth, kindness and knowledge to all. Sending condolences to her family and friends.\n\nRose Karen\n\nLiz was a real connector. I live in the US and always felt after I moved here that she wanted me to know that it still mattered that I kept up my Somerville connection. Thank you , Liz. You will be missed.\n\nSuzan Griffiths\n\nCondolences, Liz was wonderful in maintaining contact with Somervillians\n\nSusan Scholefield\n\nSuch sad news, but I will treasure all the time I spent with Liz, her commitment to Somerville and her wise advice and friendship.\n\nNadine Majaro\n\nLiz was always a kind, welcoming face at Somerville. Her interest in the lives of all alumni and her extraordinary memory for every one of us made everyone feel part of the Somerville family. She will be a very hard act to replace for the college, but there are many people who feel they have lost a good friend.\n\nCornelius Grupen\n\nLiz was my lifeline to Somerville ever since I left almost thirty years ago. May she rest in peace.\n\nOnora O’Neill (Honorary Fellow)\n\nConversation with Liz was always a great pleasure. I last saw her early in the pandemic at her house in Great Tew. We sat (duly distanced!) in her garden among her many evergreen shrubs and hedges and kept more or less warm. We ranged across numerous topics, and the time sped past. Like many others, I shall miss talking with Liz.\n\nCaroline Alexander\n\nI was very sad to hear this news. I had known Liz since the 1970’s, when I was a student, and never imagined a time when I might come to Somerville and not see her. There had been changes of Principal, Librarian and many other staff, but through the 1970s, the ’80s, the 90’s, and all through the 2000s until 2023, Liz was there. She was unfailingly cheerful, always warm, always remembered one and one’s classmates, always down to earth. I miss her already and will all the more on my next visit to Oxford. My condolences to her family.\n\nCynthia Norris Graae\n\nI grieve at the news of Liz’s death. I was at Somerville (1962-64) just before Liz. I got to know her through Somerville alumni activities. She was an important part of Somerville and a great help to the Washington DC group for many years. She became a good friend to me and my late husband Steffen. I will never forget our wonderful visit to her house in Great Tew. I send my condolences to all who grieve at this loss, especially to Oliver.\n\nOliver, please know that your mother was well loved.\n\nCynthia Graae\n\nDeborah Loudon\n\nI was so sad to read this news. Liz and I had been due to have lunch recently, which was then postponed. I got to know her when she began her alumni role and she was always so warm, and so competent. Through our mutual friendship with Katherine Duncan-Jones we were more in touch and I grew to admire her more. My deepest sympathies are with her family.\n\nLinda Appleby\n\nYou are unforgettable, Liz.\n\nYou gave me belief in myself in dark times.\n\nYou made Somervillians a family to which we would always belong.\n\nYour influence must last for ever.\n\nYou are worthy of heartfelt thanks.\n\nMay you rest in peace\n\nxxxx\n\nAnne Cowan\n\nSo very sorry to hear the news of Liz’s death. She was a constant reminder of Somerville, so active with connecting and reconnecting people with the college. I met her in person a few times after the pandemic and sat with her over lunch at several recent events. RIP Liz, you were a very special Somervillian.\n\nMargaret Casely-Hayford (Honorary Fellow)\n\nWhen so many people pass through an institution, annually, it’s hard for most to make a mark, but Liz Cooke didn’t forget any of us and made each feel that we had truly left an indelible mark on College. In reality it was Liz’s capacity to welcome and embrace each of us that will mean that she has left a truly lasting mark.\n\nI for one will never forget her and will remember her with immense fondness and huge gratitude.\n\nJennifer Hindell (Thomas 1952)\n\nLiz was the best organiser for old Somerville events, really bringing warm friendliness to every occasion.\n\nSuzanne E Dawes (nee Cooper)\n\nIn the years since I left Somerville, Liz has been my main connection on alumnae matters. On one occasion, I recall arriving at the lodge, jet-lagged from Canada. I was immediately greeted by LIz. She first made sure I had my room information and then invited me to join her in the SCR for refreshments and a chat. My condolences to her family and the Somerville community.\n\nJane Doorly\n\nMany condolences to Liz’s family. She had a rare and magical ability to make things happen. Somerville will be much the poorer with her passing.\n\nClaire Barwell\n\nDearest Liz, you will be so much missed, mourned and lamented. Your unfailing kindness has been an inspiration to us all and your contribution to Somerville is legendary.\n\nAll your friends are weeping. Sending condolences and sympathy to your family.\n\nJudith Mitchell (Bainbridge) PPE 1967\n\nMy fondest memories of Liz come from many meetings of the Somerville London Group.\n\nAlso , back in the days when our newsletters were printed and posted, from visits to College to collect the boxes of labels to facilitate this process.\n\nLiz would always offer me lunch (and a view of the Ivon Hitchins paintings) and the friendliest of chats over coffee afterwards.\n\nGwyneth Pettit\n\nLiz Cooke was the ever-professional and always-efficient heart of the wider Somerville family. We felt that there was someone who, however long ago we graduated, would instantly recognise and greet us whenever we came back to college. She will be greatly missed by all Somervillians.\n\nDr Karimjee Shabu\n\nI just can’t imagine Somerville without you. Thank you so much for your encouragement and support over the last 52 years\n\nCarolyn Williams\n\nThank you, Liz, for holding so many of us together for so long.\n\nJacqueline Watts\n\nSo sorry to hear she has died. Sympathies to those closest to her.\n\nJane Robinson (Senior Associate)\n\nLiz embodied Somerville’s humanity to me: she was welcoming, witty, inspiring, warm-hearted without being sentimental, innovative, proactive, endlessly supportive and brilliant company. Because of her quiet energy and natural modesty we may never know how much we owe her, both collectively and individually, but it’s certain that without her the college would not have become the inclusive community we know and love today. And without her, it’ll never feel quite the same. I’ll miss her.\n\nGina Alexander\n\nLiz was a wonderful friend. Visit to Great Tew were highlights of my year. Liz was Somerville, I will miss her hugely. Please pass on my deepest sympathy to her son and his family.\n\nNicola Davies (1965, Modern History)\n\nI would like to offer my condolences to Liz’s family. Always kind, friendly and efficient.\n\nRoz Morris\n\nDear Liz, we will all miss you so much. Your quiet efficiency was phenomenal and I will always appreciate you asking me to run Media conferences for the College and being so good at getting speakers. As Rolling Stone said about Janis Joplin – one of our aircraft is missing. I am so sad to hear that you are no longer with us and I will really miss you. My condolences to Ollie and Liz’s family family and colleagues.\n\nLucinda Kowol\n\nLiz was very kind to me when I was widowed and we had some lovely lunches together. She was a great force for good in the village. Always interested and kind.\n\nPeter and Catherine Oppenheimer\n\nWe are so, so sorry. A lovely person. We had no thought that this was imminent.\n\nPauline Ashall\n\nTo me, and to so many other alumnae, Liz was for so many years the face and voice of the College, symbolising everything that the College stood for. She had so much charm and enthusiasm, a phenomenal memory, and showed a genuine interest in all of us. She will be so greatly missed.\n\nRuth Finnegan (Honorary Fellow)\n\nWith my love and respect, dear Liz – your memory and your work and your beloved Somerville and Somervillians will live on, not least because of you.\n\nAll blessings as angels sing you home\n\nRuth xx\n\nJacqueline Young\n\nThank you Liz for encouraging me to come back to visit Somerville in 2009 for the first time in nearly 40 years, following which I have made many happy and enjoyable visits to the college for the interesting activities that you have played such an important part in hosting. I will miss our chats about our gardens! Thanks from the bottom of my heart for all your hard work and dedication, re"
