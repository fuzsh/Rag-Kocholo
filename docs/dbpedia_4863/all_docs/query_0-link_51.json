The Modern Screen Magazine She cried when told her fault was^B.O. 95 {Body Odor) — but that frank talk brought her happiness HEN the office nurse called me into her little private room and, in her kindly way, warned me about 'B.O.' — body odor— I was so surprised, so humiliated, that I began to cry. \"But she explained so nicely how anyone might offend and not know it. Our pores give off a whole quart of odor-causing waste daily, she told me. We become so used to this ever- present odor that we don't notice it in our- selves. But we. instantly notice 'B.O.' in other people, and it is always offensive. So easy to be safe \"How glad I am that I followed her advice and adopted Lifebuoy as my toilet soap. For now I have many more friends than formerly. Girls in the office and outside. Boys, too, invite me to the movies and to dances— and I frankly admit that they never used to! \"Do you wonder that I adore Lifebuoy? I love its rich, creamy lather and its pleas- ant, extra-clean scent that vanishes as you rinse. And I feel so clean after a Lifebuoy bath— so safe from 'B.O.' For Lifebuoy's abundant lather is gently antiseptic. It puri- fies pores — removes every trace of odor.\" The finest of complexion soaps! Lifebuoy is wonderfully bland and mild for the face, yet marvelously cleansing. Its creamy, searching lather floods tiny pores — gently loosens clogged impurities — freshens dull, sallow skins— brings back healthy, glow- ing radiance. Adopt Lifebuoy today.

Today all women can know at all times the poise and the peace of mind that come from perfect protection. Active, athletic women, too, can be free today to pursue their sports at any time. Free, to wear filmy frocks on any occasion. For there is now an utterly new and totally different hygiene for women. Not merely another sanitary pad, but an immaculate and complete protection! A san- itary napkin that is New in design; New in material; New and remarkable in the re- sults it gives. It is so unique that we want to send you a sample free of charge (in plain wrapping, of course). So you can examine it fully. Judge for yourself its two distinct advantages that have never before been offered to women. Ends All Chafing — All Irritations! Made under rigid U. S. Patents, it is pure Rayon cellulose filled. And you will find it as gentle as fluffed silk. This softness comes because of its totally new construction — as well as its rayon cellulose filler — as you will note the moment you see it and compare it with any other pad. You see at once why it is preferable. For it is not made from mere layers of crepe paper as in old-type sanitary methods. Once the discriminating woman tries one, she never goes back to old ways. Its name is Veldown. Most stores can now supply you. Effective Hours Longer It also has another important feature. It is absolutely protective for the reason that the outer side has been specially treated to make it moisture-proof and impenetrable. This innovation makes Veldown 5 or more times more absorbent than other sanitary methods. And it gives Complete Safety and protection Hours Longer than other ways. Hence a danger that every woman carries in her mind is absolutely eliminated. And no other protective garments are nec- essary. It is specially treated with a deodorant — and thus ends even slightest danger of em- barrassment. Discards, of course, easily as tissue. Accepf Trial Go today to any drug or department store.

You can argue both sides of the subject indefinitely. But whether women cook for men or for other women is no question at all. Women cook for men — to please men — and the true value of any dish is measured in terms of what the men of the family think of it. In planning her menus, however, the true homemaker must think not only of what her men like to eat, but what is good for them to eat. She must think, too, how she HOME SERVICE DEPARTMENT MODERN SCREEN Magazine 100 Fifth Avenue, New York, N. Y. Kindly send me the recipes for June for which ! enclose 4c to cover cost of Immediately above is the gentleman of France whose tastes in food are responsible for this month's recipes. The large picture across the top of the page shows a perfectly equipped kitchen; in just such a one as this the modern hostess tests each recipe. This month's recipes were prepared for Chevalier— try them on your men folks can contrive to give them what they want and what they should have, and still stay within the family food budget. In short, she must combine flavor with digestibility, appetite appeal with nutritional value, novelty with economy. No easy task, this, and because we realize it is not easv, this department is going to specialize in recipes for foods that we know men like because they have told us they like them. We are going to tell you what your favorite men screen stars like to eat, and just how to make these dishes for the delight of your own folks. For this, our first Hostess Department page, we went to Maurice Chevalier, that famous and popular ambas- sador of good will from France — the land of good cook- ing— and asked him what lie liked to eat. We found him in his costume for his newest picture, which is called, aptly enough, \"The Smiling Lieutenant.\" \"Well,\" said Monsieur, in reply to our query about his favorite foods,, \"I like a chop, nicely grilled.\" \"But,\" we remonstrated, \"that is a typical American or English dish.\" \"Certainement,\" responded he. \"for when I am in America I eat as Americans do. Would you go to France and seek out an American restaurant?\" \"No,\" we admitted, \"we should want to have the pleasure of tasting those delicious dishes for which your country is so famous.\" \"Yes indeed,\" he said, \"you would want to eat a cas- serole of meat in a delectable (Continued on page 116) The MODERN SCREEN Directory (PICTURES) \"Inspiration,\" Greta Carbo's latest picture, is by far her best talkie effort to date. She seems to have completely overcome her self-consciousness. Robert Montgomery does his best. ALONG CAME YOUTH (Paramount)— Charles Rogers as an American boy stranded in England who, in order to make a living, bluffs his way into a chef's job. Stuart Erwin and William Austin assist in ex- cellent form. Good — suitable for children. ANIMAL CRACKERS (.Paramount)— The Marx Brothers in their second talkie riot. Excellent — suitable for children. THE BACHELOR FATHER (M- G-M) — Marion Davies in a talkie adaptation of the famous stage play. Somewhat sophisticated stuff. Marion is excellent. Very good — but not suitable for children. THE BAT WHISPERS (United Artists)— Chester Morris and others in a thrilling mystery story. Good. BEAU IDEAL (Radio)— A Foreign Legion story of the \"Beau Geste\" type but not up to the standard of that excellent .yarn. Fair. BEHIND OFFICE DOORS (Radio)— Reviewed in this issue. THE BIG HOUSE (M-G-M) — An exciting prison picture with Chester Morris, Wal- lace Beery and Robert Montgomery. Very good — nor suitable for children. THE BIG TRAIL (Fox) — An epic of the early old days in \"The Covered Wagon\" man- ner. Excellent — suitable for children. BILLY THE KID (M-G-M) — A somewhat sen- timentalized version of the life of the famous old-time bandit. Good. THE BLUE ANGEL (Paramount)— Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in a grim story about love in a vaudeville troupe. Very good — but not suitable for children. BODY AND SOUL (Fox)— Reviewed in this issue. THE BOUDOIR DIPLOMAT ( Universal)— All about a diplomat of a mythical country whose chief duty was to make love to a certain cabinet minister's wife. Fair — not suitable for children. THE CAT CREEPS ( Universal) — A thrilling mystery story with sliding panels, valu- able jewels and all the trappings. Neil Hamilton, Helen Twelvetrees and Lilyan Tashman are in it. Good. Starting this month we are making an innovation in our directory of pictures. Those pictures which are particularly suitable for children we are marking accordingly. And those which are unsuitable for children— either because the subject is not desirable or merely not interesting to young ones — we are also indicating. This ought to be an excellent guide for anybody who is interested in finding satisfactory and pleasing entertainment for children. CHARLIE'S AUNT (Columbia)— Charles Rug- gles in the talkie version of the famous old play. Good — especially suitable for children. CIMARRON (Radio) — A picturization of the tremendously powerful Edna Ferber novel. This picture is of the epic type and has some of the biggest scenes ever filmed in it. Excellent — suitable for children. CITY LIGHTS (United Artists)— Charlie Chaplin's latest comedy — it needs no introduction. Excellent — especially suit- able for children. THE CONNECTICUT YANKEE (Fox)— Re- viewed in this issue. THE CRIMINAL CODE (Columbia)— An underworld story with Phillips Holmes and Walter Huston in the leading roles. Very good. DANGER LIGHTS (Radio)— A railroad story with some wonderful shots of railroad goings-on. The late Louis Wolheim, Robert Armstrong and Jean Arthur have the leading roles. Good — suitable for children. DERELICT (Paramount) — A sea story with George Bancroft and William (Stage) Boyd in the leading r51es. Good. DEVIL TO PAY (United Artists)— A clever, sophisticated story about the adventures of a charming ne'er-do-well. Excellent. DISHONORED (Paramount)— Reviewed in this issue.

Your response has made me truly grateful. Don't forget— you can say what you please, favorable or unfavorable, and I will print it if there is room and if your letter seems truly sincere. No prizes are offered. As I have said before, fans write to me because they have something to say. Are you glad that Pola Negri is back? Do you agree with me that Robert Montgomery's elevation to stardom is his just reward for fine work in many roles? Do you disapprove as highly as I do of advertisements being worked into pictures? Does anyone share my opinion that the one actress in pictures who should (and someday will) be starred is ZaSu Pitts? I should like to see Lois Moran given a role on the screen that gives her a real chance, as did her recent stage part in New York, to show what a truly competent and able little actress she is. I should like to see the technique of \"The Last Laugh\" (the psycho- logical study of one character) applied to a talking picture and I suggest Joseph von Sternberg as the director. I'd be overjoyed to have a Carbo film end happily. 1 think Neil Hamilton is des- tined to be at the top of the heart-breaker list in the ensuing months. I think Maureen O'Sullivan is better looking off screen than on and that some director and cameraman should give her a break. And to close this opinionated paragraph, I'd like to men- tion that my biggest moments in movie theatres these days are when one of the \"Silly Symphonies\" is being shown. By next month I'll have thought up some more. Au revoir. Isn't that just what Joan is doing? It is one thing to publish an article called \"Joan Crawford Rebels\" by Adele Whitely Fletcher, but quite an- other to sit clown and read it without feeling the urge of a come-back. In the first place, can anyone pos- sibly fathom a likeness between Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo? It seems to be a fad to find someone who either resembles or is trying to mimic the Great Garbo. Joan Crawford has no more chance of attaining the heights of La Garbo than Clara Bow would have. Just a line to Joan — why burn up your energy and scatter your forces in raving over what is broadcast 12 about yourself? Just be yourself, keep within the boundaries of your own type, aim to make your type distinctive. Mrs. Homer H. Peters, Pueblo, Colorado. Much still being said on both sides Faith Baldwin's article concerning Garbo and Marlene is the cleverest yet to be found in this famous con- troversy. One can see Miss Baldwin's fairness and knowledge in analyzing these stars. Oh ! would that only- half of the fans would see that those two are not alike and are not trying to be ! Greta is fascinating in her cold glamor and alluring awkward- ness. Marlene is heavenly in her com- plete womanliness, with all the fem- inine wiles and charms present in her being. And while talking of the matchless Marlene, let me give bouquets and deep admiration to the marvelous Elissa Landi . . . her performance in \"Body and Soul\" was magnificent and her strange beauty is extraor- dinarily impressive. Diana T. Schroeder, Houston, Texas. All right, Mary, \"what do you want for a dime?\" In your new magazine, do we have to take the bad with the good ? The interesting with the dull? Faith Baldwin may disagree with Elinor Glyn as to the screen's most attractive man, but who cares ? Your readers have minds of their own. Tell us about our movie idols, but please, please don't dish us personal opinions and expect us to eat them up with much enthusiasm. The future is certainly coming for its all. Why guess at Robert Mont- gomery's or Marlene Dietrich's? The present is complicated and interest- ing enough to worry with. Modern Screen is certainly sprouting all the earmarks of a suc- cessful magazine. And legitimately, too. Would it be too much to ask for more such exquisite pictures as that of Norma Talmadge in the March issue? And more pictures of the stars' wardrobes? And more fashions? And more film gossip? I — I'm sure I represent a large group of fan readers — enjoy them so. There's never enough to these de- partments. If this letter is published, will you head it \"What do you want for a dime ?\" Mary Ray Little, Cincinnati, Ohio. We'll have to struggle along with two or three fashion departments for a while, Nancy (See pages 70 and 92 in this issue) In the Modern Screen Magazine there isn't enough about styles — not only dresses, but coats, shoes and so forth.

Is it worth anything — everything} Which is the truest love ... a life- time of sacrifice to an ideal — or an hour of mad emotion? Love stripped Lady Isabel of all she loved; crushed her and cast her to the depths. Yet love like hers could not be quenched. That immortal romance, East Lynne, is one of the world's most intense love stories. On the screen it was an emotional triumph. The fiction version of the screen story will hold you in its spell from the first page to the last. It will make you smile; it will make you cry. From her country home at East Lynne, Lady Isabel is thrust into a wide, friendless world, by a cruel prank of fate.

SCREEN MAGAZINE FILM GOSSIP OF THE MONTH Dolores Del Ri'o's contract with United Artists on account of difficulties occasioned by her persona with Edwin Carewe. MLLE. GABRIELLE CHAXEL is in Holly- wood ! After much publicity hubbub the famous Paris designer and fasbion dictator arrived under contract to Sam Goldwyn. And at the tea tendered her, the worst-dressed woman that attended was Mile. Chanel herself. We guess that is just as good a publicity gag as anything else. Chanel will create gowns for such famous United Ar- tists stars as Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, Norma Talmadge, Ina Claire, Lily Damita and several others. Goldwyn is very enthusiastic about his latest importation. As a mere cordial gesture he spent thousands of dollars redecorating and rear- ranging the wardrobe de- partment at the studio — to make it almost a rep- lica of Chanel's Paris fashion studio. There are work rooms, fitting rooms, reception rooms, and a gorgeously remod- eled style salon. This salon will contain a stage with lighting equipment, drapes, dressing rooms and in it mannikins will stage style shows of the gowns Chanel creates for the stars. Also in this building is a luxurious apartment to which she can retire for rest or study. Anyway, however fa- mous this lady has be- come as a fashion expert, she hasn't lost her sense of humor. The other day, Goldwyn was giving sev- eral new players screen tests — while Chanel looked amusedly at the proceedings. After it was all over, she begged Sam to let her try her luck in front of the \"davil camera.\" She decided she would be a comedienne, and kept everybody on the set in roars. If she ever decides to give up the designing business, maybe she could team up with her countryman, Maurice Chevalier. AN up-and-coming young actress who came to Holly- . wood via musical comedy had a date the other night with one of her fellow-workers at the studio. The night of the date the young fellow telephoned her to find out what time he should call for her. \"I'm awfully sorry,\" the girl frankly said, \"but I just made another 'date with Mr. (an executive at the studio). I knew vou'd understand.\" He did, and is 'telling everyone that not many girl- are honest enough not to have made up a cock-and- story about a headache or retakes at the studio. mil LAST MINUTE NEWS Joel McCrea seems to have quite supplanted Henri de la Falaise with Constance Bennett. George Bancroft will receive $100,000 per picture under his new Paramount contract. We hear that just as soon as Paul Whitcmaris divorce becomes final, that big band master from Chicago will marry Margaret Livingston. We were as surprised as you are! MONA MARIS, who for a while was squired about by John Gilbert — and very attentively, too — seems to be concentrating on Clarence Brown.

Last Friday we saw Lilyan Tashman in a gorgeous outfit of pale blue, and there was a sparkle in her eye that challenged anyone to maintain that she wasn't the best-dressed woman there. Not far away was Connie Bennett in an extremely chic dark suit. To add to the picture, Kay Francis sat in the same section of the stadium, dressed smartly in a tailored outfit. And the fighting spirit prevailed ! You simply don't know your Hollywood if you haven't read this 15 International International International Louella Parsons, famous newspaper writer and mother of Harriet Par- sons, gave Ben Lyon and Bebe an airplane send-off recently. Robert Montgomery recently ar- rived in New York with his young wife for a short vacation before beginning his next picture. Statistics show that there are seven and two-eighths marriages to every divorce in Hollyzvood. Tzvo-cighths of a marriage sound strange — even for Hollywood ! LITTLE Robert Coogan, age 5, went to the preview of \"Skippy\" the other night with his mother. Robert, you know, is the younger brother of Jackie Coogan. Mrs. Coogan told us that Bobbie laughed so hard at the picture that she almost had to take him out of the theatre. Afterwards, when he was asked how he liked it, he considered a minute and said, \"It's all right, but it's just like the rushes out at the studio!\" YOU remember that Hugh Trevor was in the insurance business before his pal, Richard Dix, persuaded him to become an actor. Well, Hugh hasn't been satisfied with the parts he has been getting, so he plans to leave pictures altogether and go back to stocks and bonds. Hugh is an exceedingly handsome fellow, and with the proper roles there seems no reason why he shouldn't be one of the screen's most popular leading men. But we guess he just got tired of waiting for his big break. Anyway, there's one thing that we're sure Hugh still likes about the picture business, and that's Betty Compson ! IRENE RICH disproves the saying that actresses are not business-minded. The other day Irene told us that she keeps a memorandum book»-now worn by much usage — in which she has recorded the starting and finish- ing dates, and the salary she received on every picture she was ever in. She first started this when she was a $3-a-day extra, \"when even those small entries weren't any too frequent !\" MARION DAVIES and her nephew, Charles Lederer, celebrated St. Patrick's Day by giving a small din- ner party down at Marion's beach home — or \"The Davies Hotel\" as some call it, it's so large. The table was all green and white, with different kinds of St. Patrick's favors. After dinner, the main diversion was watching \"The Front Page,\" which Marion showed for her guests. Alexander Penrod (sewing), the cameraman lost with the Viking, worked with Elmer Clifton (behind) in \"Down To The Sea in Ships.\" Of course, Howard Hughes was there with Billie Dove, who looked simply gorgeous in a shade of deep blue.

Everyone that feels run-down from overwork hies himself to Malibu to recuperate, so he can return and overwork again. Wesley Ruggles, the director, is among those \"resting quietly\" down there — swimming a little but lolling in the warm sand most of the time. Evelyn Brent is just finish- ing a picture and is hoping and praying there won't be any retakes. Evelyn wants to go down to her beach cot- tage and \"do nothing\" for a while. The shooting schedules for her last two pictures have been almost unbearably heavy — and as a result, she hasn't been feeling up to par. Dorothv Lee is en joying a six-weeks' vacation in good old New York, while her liusband of six months, Jimmy Fidlcr, adapts a story for RKO.

WHEN a person as thin as Gary Cooper loses thirteen pounds in a short time — it's time to do something about it. For a long time Gary has been rushing from one picture to another with hardly any lay-off in between. That is the price you have to pay for screen popularitv. Although he hadn't been feeling so well lately, nobody took much interest in the fact — not even Gary !

When he returns to Hollywood his usual healthy, tanned self, he will start work on \"The Roundup.\" The other day a certain reporter called a studio and asked to speak to a certain producer. After waiting about five minutes, a secretary informed the zvaiting reporter, \"I'm sorry, but Mr. can't be disturbed right nozv. He's on the verge of a conference !\" H ERE'S good news for Richard Cromwell's friends. For a time it looked like Dick would do a Betty Bronson and disappear from view after making a first big picture. But when we inquired about Dick out at the studio, they assured us that he starts work very soon in \"Fifty Fathoms Deep.\" That made us feel lots better, because Dick is one of the most sincere youngsters in Hollywood. HERETOFORE, if you saw Will Rogers, he was wearing either the blue suit or the brown suit. But in his latest picture he must don full-dress and formal morning attire, wear spats, boutonnieres and carry canes. So Fox persuaded Will to visit Hollywood's most ex- clusive tailor. Wrhen we asked him how he liked to be all dressed up, Will replied, \"Wal, to tell yuh the truth, every time I pass a mirror, I blush for shame.\" On top of this, he injured his arm playing polo and has to wear a cast. However, the cast is removable and every time Will is needed in a scene, he just slips it off. ONE of Warner Brothers' stars (we promised we would mention no names) told us this one at lunch the other day. It seems that Hollywood wise-crackers can't seem to forget about Warner Brothers signing up several of Paramount's leading players. So it happened that a bright boy went to W'arners' Studio to interview a prominent star. \"But he's not here,\" said the information clerk. \"He works at Paramount.\" \"Okeh,\" said the writer. \"Ell wait.\" Phillips Holmes is not onl\\< getting more and more popular with theater-goers, but sooner or later all the Hollyzvood girls succumb to his blond charms.

Somborn calls Wallie \"brother-in-law.\" Mack Sennett was there too, with his favorite actress, Marjorie Beebe. Also Buster Collier and Marie Prevost (this romance threatens to break all previous records). Up at the Embassy Club, Ann Harding and her hus- band, Harry Bannister, chatted gaily over their salads. And as usual, Lothar Mendez and Lady Inverclyde were eating together. Also Neil Hamilton and his wife, Elsa, and Adolphe Menjou with Katherine Carver.

But of course you've heard of her. Pola Negri is the shorter, more vivid name by which this lovely, tempestuous lady is known to her public. Do you remember \"Hotel Imperial\" ? And \"The Woman From Moscow\" ? And \"The Loves of an Actress\" ? Do you remember Pola as Carmen — a fiery, taunting, greedy and utterly superb Carmen? Do you remember her with Emil Jannings in \"Passion,\" her first film to be shown in this country? But if these names and titles have slipped from your memory with the passing of years, you of course remem- ber Pola herself. Always portraying the \"good-bad\" woman. Always mysterious, always lovely. Frequently in the headlines. And enough of a power in Hollywood to make even Gloria Swanson jealous. What happened to her when the talkies came to Holly- wood ? Well, she had the good sense to realize immediately that she was through — unless she learned to speak English. Her contract was not renewed — and it would take a long time to learn English. So she left Hollywood, bravely and uncompromisingly, without one backward look. AND after that — well, the Prince Mdvani happened. . He married Pola and for a while life was just one of those blissful honeymoons you read about in books. Pola was quite content to give up her career. But princes of ancient and honorable families and Polas who are used to being as temperamental as they please sometimes come to grief. The Prince and Princess Mdvani agreed to disagree, as the saying goes — and Pola looked about her to find something to take the place of happiness. Ah, yes — there was that career she'd so nonchalantly given up. It stood her in good stead now. She bolstered it up with an excellent command of the English language. The London and Paris vaudeville stages offered her an opening. She took it. And then Hollywood offered her a contract — with RKO-Pathe. So Pola Negri will return in May. Her vivid, dramatic portrayals will be welcomed by the American public again. And her voice, speaking excellent English — with, perhaps, just a fascinating suggestion of an accent — will be heard for the first time on the talking screen. We are happy to recommend to your attention a beauti- ful story about the Princess Mdvani by Princess Radziwill which appears in the next issue of this magazine. 18 PORTRAITS Gloria Swanson is now known profession- ally as Gloria Swanson, Incorporated. The rumors persist that Gloria is going to marry Gene Markey, celebrated writer, but Gloria herself will neither verify nor deny them. Here's something you didn't know about her: she usually eats lunch in her town car on the way to her various appointments. 19 Photograph by Preston Duncan The last picture which Gavin Gordon com- pleted was \"Shipmates,\" in which Robert Montgomery is being starred. The re- port is still going the rounds that Gavin is the victim of an unreciprocated love for Greta Garbo. Gavin, however, vigorously denies it. And if you persist in the asser- tion he gets fighting mad. But the report goes annoyingly on— Bebe Daniels recently finished \"A Woman of the World\" for Warner Brothers. Bebe has decided to take a flyer in the business world by going into the cosmetic business with Jim, Hollywood beauty specialist. If Bebe can make her custom- ers look as beautiful as she does, her success is assured even before she starts- she's amazingly smart-looking.

Her next picture will be \"Never The Twain Shall Meet\"— she's working on it now. John Garrick, who has been playing lead- ing man roles for Fox for some time, will come into his own, as far as publicity is concerned, when he appears opposite Janet Caynor in \"Merely Mary Ann.\" This was the story in which Charles Farrell was to have played opposite Caynor again— until his honeymoon intervened. Sort of a pretty good break for the Garrick lad, eh? Richard Dix has just finished \"Big Brother\" and is now at work on \"Marcheta.\" From now on Dix will appear only in serious dramatic stories, which means he will not be seen in any more comedies or ordinary \"program\" pictures.

And no matter what the world may say about Clara, Elinor Glyn will always have a tender regard for the little star I AM far away in England and have not read any of the American reports or criticisms about Clara Bow, so I cannot say who is right or who is wrong over the late affair — and by the time this gets into print the whole thing may have been settled amicably. But I feel that I want to tell my story of the dear little girl who played in my \"It\" in 1927. Everyone can be wise after an event, and alas ! most people have a tendency to wait to see how the wind is blowing before they say anything nice about any person whose fate may be in jeopardy, so I think that now is the time for me to speak ! Whoever breaks rules, or will not listen to warnings, obviously must pay the price, so I am not suggesting a word of criticism about any decisions which producers (Left) The famous star as she is today. (Above) As she was back in 1927 when she appeared in \"It\" with Antonio Moreno as her leading man. She has changed since then— as Elinor Glyn discovered.\" may have come to in regard to the popular little star. My story is merely upon my personal knowledge of Clara. I HAD only seen her in one picture before she played in \"It,\" but the roguish face and intelligent acting de- lighted me.- Paramount bought the title of my story \"It,\" which came out in the Cosmopolitan, and it was arranged that I should write an entirely' new one for Qara under I bat title in which the characters should be reading that magazine and wondering if they had \"It.\" Clara was to express the mysterious quality — and believe me, she did ! We met for the first time in Mr. Schulberg's office. (Above) On the \"It\" set where the fine friendship between the woman of England and the girl from Brooklyn was formed. Clara was a little suspicious of Mrs. Glyn's English reserve at first— but it soon wore off. Clara was hatless, her flaming head tied up with some kind of scarf. She was frightfully dressed. This was the more remarkable because every little extra in the studios seems to have some clear idea of the \"note\" of the moment. But in spite of shocking clothes and ridiculous scarf, Clara exuded immense attraction. Her large, lovely eyes flashed with life, her tiny figure seemed all alive with a desire to go, just as race horses strain before starting their race. She expressed vitality. She talked in the toughest vocabulary I had ever heard in the film colony ! but it was apt and very funny. WE had a long chat afterwards in my office, and I began to have an impression of her life. She was perfectly genuine, and did not pretend to have come from anywhere grand, but just from the poorest class. This naturalness drew me at once, then I saw the pathos always lurking in her great big eyes. She seemed to have no memories of a home, or a lov- ing mother's care. It appeared that she was just a waif of fortune with nothing to lean upon but her own talent and scintillating fascination. As we talked I realized how intelligent her mind was with almost no education ; she saw at once every point I wanted her to bring out in the new picture we were going to make together. She was a little suspicious at first. She had not met 27 any English people perhaps and could not quite fathom our rather stiff manners. But soon that wore off and we became friendly. Never have I had anything to do with a better actress. Clarence Badger was a broad- minded, generous director, and was in perfect sympathy with me in my — what shall I call it? — perhaps spiritual direction, of Clara Bow on the set. I used to explain to her just what I wanted her to feel and think in every scene, and then he used to do the actual direction, and we both concentrated upon what would bring out Clara's best points each day, as we invented new twists upon my original scenario. THE dear little thing used to look at me like a child before she began, her huge eyes blazing with under- standing, and she used to whisper, \"Now, Madame, keep watching me. I seem to feel it and it helps.\" And indeed I did \"watch\" her and with every day stronger admiration for her talent — her pluck in the horrid cold water when the yacht capsized and threw her overboard for the last scenes of the picture ! — her gaiety ! — her good humor ! But underneath there was always this note of pathos, as though her soul was not content and desired something finer. I do not know who were her companions in those days — but her quaint little father came' to me one after- noon on the set, and asked me to try to use my influence to get her away from them, as they were not helping her to go up — but pull- ing her downwards. I used to talk to her often and try to interest her in books — and I remember I gave her Van Loon's \"Story of Mankind,\" and she promised to study it. I always had a sort of \"mother\" feeling for her. I longed to protect and guide her — for whatever she may appear to have become now, Clara was then a perfectly sweet and dear char- acter. I could have done anything with her if we had been longer together. I used to get glimpses of such an unhappy, comfortless past, ut- terly neglected as far as training in any domestic virtues went. And yet all of her impulses were good. I REMEMBER I asked her to one of the parties I had for some foreign celebrity — I cannot remember which now — and she came re- markably dressed, not just in the perfect taste of the other stars. I noticed there was a slight looking down the nose at her, and no one was very kind to her except Marion Davies, whose golden heart is always kind to everyone. However,, all the men of the party admired Clara! and she never showed that she perceived that she was not a 'persona grata'. 28 Her nerve never failed her — and, I know, never will. In those days I do not remember seeing her drink any- thing intoxicating. She appeared just a high spirited little girl out to enjoy her success. About half way through \"It\" I happened to see \"Chil- dren of Divorce\" run, in which Clara had had a very tragic part — and then I could see her great aptitude for the expression of sorrow. And once or twice in her dressing-room I found her crying — and when I asked her why, considering she was so successful, she would say that she did not know — only she was sad — and she felt there was something else in life than all this, and would she ever find it? 1 Says Elinor Glyru \"Her large, lovely eyes flashed with life, her tiny figure seemed all alive with a desire to go, just as race horses strain before starting their race.\" TOLD her then that if she worked and read and thought and educated herself, she could one day be a great tragic actress. \"Ah! if that would come true;\" she used to answer. I left Hollywood after we finished the picture, and I had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps there would be no pne to go on taking care of her and influencing her to enjoy finer things, and that perhaps she might be set upon by the decadents who batten on to successful stars. I did not see her again until two years ago in New York, when she came to see me in my apartment on top of the Ritz Tower, and I remember the old wistful soul peeped out when we looked from that vast height over the wonder world of illuminated New York. \"Say, it's like being up in the stars here and seeing how small everything below is,\" she sighed. Then — she had creme de menthe instead of tea, and started being very gay and amusing. There was a change in her — her bril- liant green dress matched the liqueur — her laugh was harder. I don't know why but she made me sad. I felt that she might be drifting — where? SHE stayed for only a short time and there were other people there, so that I could not talk to her alone, and that is the last- 1 saw of her as I left for Europe that Spring. And now, judging by paragraphs I read in English newspapers, the dear little girl, capable of so much good if fate had been kinder to her, must be going through a distressing time — and realizing the inexorable law of the boomerang. How I would love to see her make a splendid come-back! If I were a millionaire producer this is what I would like to do with Clara. I would send her to Europe to travel for a year with a really culti- vated, clever companion who would guide her interests and polish her mind, and let her have peace and beauty. And then I would find a really sorrowful story for her, like Hans Anderson's \"Little Match Girl\" — and get the very best author to elaborate it into an exquisite tragedy. Then ] when Clara's spirit was soothed and rested I would encourage her to give the highest of her art to the part and present her to the public once more — and as a great tragic actress. I am certain she would come up to my expectations and belief in her. But I just want to say in conclusion that however her fortune goes, up or down, she will always find a friend in Elinor Glyn.

By GLADYS HALL AT precisely 8.35 p. m. on the night of January 25, 1931, Harold Lloyd, Junior, was born. ^ He weighed two pounds and fourteen ounces. The doctors said, \"He has a fifty-fifty chance.\" And that little hyphen between the fifty-fifty symbolized the dearest dream of Harold Lloyd's heart.

But they never made love in real life. Theirs was a friendship born of similar natures and ancestry, no more. Says this author: \"Garbo knows — knows instinc- tively, I think, and has always known it— that the illusion of oneness of two beings which is created by a great love is an illusion and nothing more; that in reality these two must remain sep- arate beings forever. . .\" 30 In the days when Greta Garbo and John Gilbert were two names always linked together both on the screen and in real life. There were many reasons why Garbo could not love John. It was through Mauritz Stiller, as you probably know, that Greta Garbo became such a tremendous success. She respected, admired— even worshipped Stiller. But she was not in love with him, ever. A great many writers have told what they considered the truth about Garbo's love life* Here, for the first time, are the real facts By HARRIET PARSONS WHY has Greta Garbo never fallen in love? Why has she, who of all women seems created for love, been .cheated of her birth- right— the birthright of every woman from shopgirl to queen? Is it fame, the merciless spotlight which plays upon her, which has cheated Greta Garbo of her share of love? Or is it the fundamental disillusionment of her nature which has kept her from falling in love as other women — even famous women do? Both, perhaps. You can count on the fingers of one hand the men whose names have been linked with hers. There was Mauritz Stiller, the Swedish director who discovered her. There was John Gilbert, idol of millions, who wooed and lost her. There was Nils Asther. And young Prince Sigmund of Sweden. And Sorenson, who Hollywood whispered was a prince but who turned out to be the son of a Swedish box maker. Of them all only two — the first two — really touched her heart. And of those two one is dead because Garbo did not love him and the other broken in spirit — perhaps for the same reason. ASTHER, young Sigmund, and Sorenson really do not count. After her split with Gilbert, Garbo used to see Nils occasionally. They were countrymen and they shared in common a moodiness and a love of solitude. It was natural that they should sense a sympathetic under- standing in one another — that they should meet and find things to talk about. There was never more than a casual friendship between them. But the press, robbed of the choice morsel which the Garbo-Gilbert romance had long offered, sought to present Asther as Gilbert's successor — sought to create a new romance where none existed. And Garbo lost a friend. Nils has since married the woman whom he loves. As for the youthful and royal Sigmund — another bit of press whimsy. During her visit to Sweden after Stiller's death Garbo was seen in public with the prince- ling— which was quite enough to start tongues wagging. Garbo is so rarely seen in public with anyone — and when that anyone happens to be a prince ! It was even whispered that the Swedish authorities had had words with her on the subject, according to report. Her own single and succinct comment on the rumor when she returned to America was, \"I don't play around with kids.\" Sorenson, the tall blond young Swede who wasn't a prince, was in love with Garbo. But Garbo wasn't in love with him. And it takes two to make a romance — everywhere, that is, except in the press. Son of a millionaire Swedish box manufacturer, he was drawn to 31 Greta Garbo— the woman so closely associated with the expression of love on the screen— has known remarkably few men in her life. Mauritz Stiller, John Gilbert, Nils Asther, Prince Sig- mund, and Sorenson. Did she love any of them? This writer tells us. Hollywood by Greta's tales of that amazing colony. And quite possibly by Greta herself. During the months that he spent here he was constantly in her company, and it was apparent that she liked him immensely. Liked, not loved. And so when his passport expired he went back to Sweden and boxes. The prince charming legend subsided like a pricked balloon. And the world was thwarted once more in its attempt to construct a romance for its reigning queen of hearts. But what of Stiller and Gilbert? Surely, you say, one of these two must have quickened love in that inscrutable, secret heart of Garbo's. I do not think so. Even though Garbo fainted at the news of Stiller's death. Even though she once almost eloped with Gilbert. WITH Stiller it was the old Svengali-Trilby story. He was the master, she the pupil. Everyone knows how Stiller forced the Metro-Gold\\»yn-Mayer studio, be- cause of their eagerness to secure his directorial genius, to accept his young acolyte also. Everyone knows how Garbo rose to world- fame through her achievements in the studios of Hollywood while Stiller returned defeated and humiliated to die in Sweden. It is already an old wives' tale. Stiller's broken heart was not the result solely of his professional failure. He was jealous, hopelessly jealous of John Gilbert. Gilbert, handsome, young, gallant, could offer Garbo what he, for all his magnificent brain and wise, tender guidance, could never give her. It must have torn his heart to think of the two of them together. The sight of his own plain face must have filled him with an agony of loathing and despair. For the master had fallen in love with the pupil. Garbo respected, admired — -even worshipped Stiller. But she was not in love with him. The shadow of his lonely death still hangs over her, has deepened and pointed her fundamental sadness. And it is doubtless partly be- cause of that shadow that she is unable to surrender her heart completely to any man. SHE holds herself irrevocably and inexcusably account- able. One day a woman friend was visiting her at her home. Garbo insisted upon playing over and over a collection of melancholy Swedish records. \"Why do you play that sad music?\" asked the friend. \"It must depress you frightfully.\" \"Yes,\" said Garbo. \"It reminds me of one I hurt — one I murdered. But that is good — it is right that I should remember.\" No one else in the world would dream of saying that Garbo killed Mauritz Stiller. No one could possibly hold her responsible that a man died because she did not love him. John Gilbert, too, was doomed to find only unhappiness in his love for Garbo. Garbo was drawn to him — he was her first real friend in America. His spirit of gaiety, his dashing good looks, his obvious infatuation for her, must have created in her at least the illusion of being in love. And yet, in the last analysis, Greta Garbo was not in love with John Gilbert. Once, it is true, he persuaded her to elope with him — but at the last moment she ran awav and fled back to Hollywood alone. The factors which kept Greta Garbo from surrender- ing to the man who came nearest of any to winning her were three. There was that ever-present shadow of Stiller — Stiller who hated John Gilbert. There was fame — the relentless, avid curiosity of the public and the press which has spoiled so many things for Garbo. A romance with John Gilbert could never be anything other than common property. Any romance of Garbo's would be that — but particularly so if the man happened to be equallv in the limelight, equally the idol of millions. And Gilbert was then riding the crest- of his popularity. What chance would those two have had for happiness?

But for this position I nominate Will Rogers. Will's recent flying adventure which not only took up a good deal of his time and, theoretically at least, risked his life, is stirring enough, for it was an undertaking BALDWIN made solely in the name of charity — and he certainly got returns as few men have been able to do. He went over the top, in more ways than one, but I do not base his candidacy for the job of American Hero upon this feat of endurance and courage and great-heartedness alone. I base it upon the fundamental make-up of the man himself — upon his fineness and genuineness. To me, Will Rogers perfectly exemplifies the traits of character and the twists of personality which, summed up, are wholly American ... or at least he possesses some- thing which all of us like to think is as American as baked beans, apple pie, an<i ice cream. I know very little more of his background and ancestry than I have read in the various magazines. I know, for instance, that he is a Westerner but he might easily be a Down East Yankee. His particular type belongs to no one part of the country. Shrewd, illuminated by gener- osity and mother wit, drawling, slow spoken, careless, he demands no sectional background for his setting. He is as Western as plains and cow ponies and as Yan- kee as Calvin Coolidge! This is the remarkable personality which, some years ago, stepped out on a Ziegfeld stage and, surrounded by Miss Baldwin asserts, with per- fect truth, that Will Rogers is one of the few motion picture stars who has remained quite American in speech in manners and in approach. Will Rogers is purely American in his rangy build, his pleasant, quite un -Arrow - Collar face. The sort of American we all wish we were, says this writer. the glamor of youth, beauty, exposure and theatricalism, twirled a rope and chewed a wad of gum and gradually, quite by chance, worked up his act into one which in- cluded a running, if slow, fire of exceptionally shrewd and humorous comment upon contemporary events. The extraordinary thing about this business was that Will Rogers remained himself. He took on no color from his surroundings; his idiom did not change; he did not change. His head remained unturned and his stand- ards remained as they had been. He appeared to me, when I first saw him, as some mobile Rock of Gibraltar around whose firmly planted feet the tides of song and dance, of tulle and satin, of rouge and powder, of per- fume, of heat, of applause and wisecracks frothed and broke — making no impression upon him whatsoever, and , 36 \"He is, to my mind, the pioneer type. Today, lie marches out on stage and screen ... he talks, in his own fashion, over the mysterious ether... but put him back a few generations ... and he would be perfectly at home.\" in no way altering his personality, or, more significant still, his character. This is a man who wears what he pleases, speaks as he pleases, does as he likes and is not concerned with the changing standards of the world about him. This is a man who may, if he likes, smite a King or a President upon the startled, but not offended, back, and proffer each some good homely advice. He may, if he so desires, hail Royalty by its sacred first name and he will get away with it. In his entirely democratic I-am-who-I-am — who- are-you? attitude toward people and things there is no display of bad taste as there might be in a man of a dif- ferent type. Will Rogers may commit minor crimes ac- cording to the Book of Etiquette but he can never commit one according to the Book of the Human Heart, which is very much more important and much more widely read. HE is the epitome of the things we like to think of as American. He stands for tolerance, he stands for humor, he stands for a certain calmness in every situation, for poise, for an inborn dignity, for wit, and for a great and charitable heart. He also stands for the standards of American home life which, even today, are not forgotten — standards of decency and fidelity, of fine fatherhood. No, they are not forgotten, although to some of us who read the daily papers and listen to the conversation of our neighbors, they may have taken on the outlines of a noble, bygone legend. And speaking of legends I wonder, sometimes, if Will Rogers is not, in himself, a living legend, a sort of folk lore story, a saga of American life — of what we consider the best in American life? \"I imagine that he has very big loyal- ties and enduring friendships . . . would be a good woodsman and a good camper. And a darned good scout in every sense of the word.\" He is, to my mind, the pioneer type. Today, he marches out on stage or screen, he soars above the common streets in airplanes, he talks, in his own fashion, over the mys- ter'ous ether. But put him back a few generations and set him a-hunting with Daniel Boone, set him to sailing over great seas and land him on Plymouth Rock, in order that he might defend his homestead and his freedom and he would be perfectly at home. He is therefore ageless. He does not belong any more to this generation than he belongs to the generation to come or the generation which is to be. Many of our motion picture stars have become ex- ceedingly Anglicized, in speech, in manner, in approach. This may be the Rod Colman influence, who knows? Many have gone Continental. What Chevalier and others have to do with this, I do not know. But few of our masculine picture stars have remained American, if they ever were. Rogers has remained so. He can do no other. THERE is a certain cTaze for youth, at the moment . . . for voungsters like Lew Ayres, Douglas Fairbanks, Junior, Robert Montgomery and many others. Their popularity and fan mail increases by leaps and bounds. Youth is, at the moment, brilliantly in the ascendant. Yet time alone can prove the enduring value of these charming young people to the stage and screen. Rogers is not young; he is not romantic in the accepted sense; he is certainly far from being handsome. But I have a curious notion that he will ' remain unthreatened while others will come and go. Speaking of Fairbanks, Junior, reminds me of Fairbanks, Senior. The older Fairbanks, particularly in his stage days and the days of his earlier pictures, was considered very American. That is, he played his parts and performed his antics in the very tempo of American life . . . he was quick on his feet, smiling through, undefeated, laughing, the very soul of the Go-Getter, the Young Man who gets ahead. After which, taking to the costume pic- ture, he preferred to adapt that tem- po to sheer romantic adventure. But Rogers' Americanism goes deeper than stories of Young Men Who Make a Million Over Night,- or who rescue maidens in mythical kingdoms or who are magnificently acrobatic. It is an Americanism which does not at all depend upon the type of story in which he must play. An American- ism which is never all contingent upon lines or situations or temporary manifestations of \"American\" life. For many manifestations are temporary. We flit from one fad or fancy to the next, and resenting the European criticism that we are \"commercial\" we become avid in our search for \"culture,\" so called. Rogers is completely unaffected. He is, I think, the living incarnation of what even the least sentimental of us like to think of at times, as the American Soul. And the American Soul is not necessarily a Babbitt ! WILL ROGERS is not negative. He has virtues which are not negative virtues. I doubt very much if he has vices. I am sure he has faults and that they are not negative, either. He has strength, but strength with- out the usual sort of dramatic trappings. When I heard that he was to do \"A Connecticut Yan- kee\" for the screen I emitted the equivalent of three cheers and a tiger. I cannot imagine a more suitable personality for the part of the Yankee who wandered into a strange land and a stranger generation, and who set both land and generation by die ears. I understand that on the screen, as on the stage, Rogers is permitted to ad lib, when he so desires. I can fancy that, in such a case, he might slow up the dramatic action of the story, but who cares — he'd probably stimulate the mental action of his listeners. If Will Rogers is, as I imagine him to be, a bona fide hero, he is one without any borrowed fuss or feathers. He is very purely American in his type of slow wit — ■ which isn't, really, wisecracking, after all, for there is too much shrewdness in it to permit it to be a mere ephemeral spark, thrown off to get a laugh, and then fading into darkness. He is purely American in his rangy build, his pleasant, keen-eyed, lantern- jawed, quite un- Arrow-Collar face ; and in his private life he is the type of Ameri- can that, no matter what we do ourselves, we wish Rogers with Brandon Hurst in a scene from \"The Connecticut Yankee.\" Miss Baldwin feels that there is no more suitable personality for the part of the Yankee who wandered into a strange land and stranger generation. we were — or that every single one of our friends were. I KNOW he is generous. I fancy he is thrifty. Where business is concerned I'll bet he can drive a hard, but not unjust, bargain. I imagine that he has very big loyal- ties and enduring friendships. I'm perfectly sure he would be a good woodsman and a good camper. And a darned good scout in every sense of the word. I don't know how much influence he has, politically, through his newspaper connections. And I sometimes think that he certainly rushes in where super-angels would fear to tread. But I have the feeling that when he scolds a little he does it with a certain understanding of human frailty and temptation. I have been listening to him, re- cently, over the radio, (Continued on page 119) 37 Says Loretta: \"When I stop to look back on that impulsive elope- ment of ours, I wonder if I ever was in love with Grant. I was deeply infatuated, yes. I thought he was the most attractive and interesting boy I had ever met. But I was too young to realize that the strong physical attraction we held for each other could possibly be anything but love. I thought the exciting emotion I felt for Grant was the kind that meant marriage, home and a life partnership. I was mistaken. If I had been a little older. . .\" LORETTA YOUNG'S OWN STORY Hollywood was delighted when it heard of the elope- ment of Loretta Young and Grant Withers a year and a half ago. It was so romantic! Too bad that the ro- mance didn't last. In this interview, exclusive to MODERN SCREEN, this famous young actress tells in her own words why her marriage to Grant Withers was an unhappy failure By WALTER RAMSEY MY marriage was the greatest mistake of my life. It is probably the greatest I shall ever make !\" With these two terse sentences, 'Loretta Young herself spoke finis to one of Hollywood's most romantic and youthful marriages. She was sitting again in the comfortable living room of her own home — the home of her sisters, Sally Blane and Polly Ann Young; the gay and laughing home her mother had begged her not to leave the day she and Grant Withers slipped away to Arizona for that sensational elopement- marriage of a year and a half ago. The marriage that is quite definitely and thoroughly over now. It was an easy matter to sense the happiness of the little family at having her back with them once more. It is in the atmosphere that greets you as you step into the spacious and dimly lighted rooms that have remained unchanged in the many months of Loretta's absence. She found the house was stil"
