        "text": "Put the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.\n\nAdd the cold water and stir with a wooden spoon until mixed. Do not attempt to knead the dough. It will appear very sticky and ragged. Only mix long enough to ensure that all the dry ingredients are incorporated.\n\nCover the bowl (I use a large dinner plate) and put it to rise on the kitchen bench (no need to put it in an especially warm place) and leave it to rise for a minimum of 8 hours.\n\nWhen ready to bake the bread, take a spatula or bench scraper and turn /flip /fold the bread dough over in the bowl. This just prepares the dough for its final rising in the oven. Cover the bowl again.\n\nPut the prepared pot (lightly oiled and with a circle of baking parchment in the base) on the bottom shelf of the cold oven, and turn on the oven to 250 C.\n\nWhen the oven has reached 250 C, sprinkle the bench with a selection of grains, seeds and porridge oats. (Sunflower, flax, sesame, etc) Tip the dough out onto the seeds, flip it over to coat well.\n\nNow take the red-hot pot out of the oven, using thick oven gloves, and place it on a heat-proof trivet or something else that protects the bench. Remove the lid (careful of the heat!) and lift and drop the dough into the pot. You may hear it sizzle as the dough hits the oiled surface. Replace the lid and place the pot back in the oven.\n\nImmediately, lower the temperature to 200 C, and bake for 45-55 mins. Remove the lid the last 10 mins to get a crispy crust.\n\nCheck for doneness by knocking on the bread as usual.\n\nTip the bread out onto a cooling tray.\n\nTempting to taste straightaway but wait at least 30 mins before tasting!\n\nI usually cut the loaf in half and cut small slices. It cuts best that way, in my opinion.\n\nThe bread has good keeping qualities, and in my household there’s never a scrap left!\n\n< Back to Recipes"
