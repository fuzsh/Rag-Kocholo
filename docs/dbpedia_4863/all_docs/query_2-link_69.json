        "text": "Fresh Pandemonium for 2019!\n\nThree Stooges fans expect to see comedic pandemonium on the big Alex screen, and for the twenty-second edition of The Three Stooges® Big Screen Event! we’ve dug deep into the vaults to present six shorts that we’ve never shown before. While not exactly premieres — Pardon My Scotch was first released in 1935 — it’s safe to say that this is the first time that this particular lineup has screened theatrically anywhere. So for those of you that make this an annual holiday tradition, you can look forward to not a single repeat at Glendale’s historic Alex Theatre on Saturday, November 30th, with shows at 2:00 and 8:00 PM. As always, the shows are presented in association with C3 Entertainment.\n\nThe program will include gorgeous 35mm prints of classic Stooges shorts, courtesy of Sony Pictures.\n\nPardon My Scotch (1935)\n\nDirected by Del Lord. With Nat Carr, Al Thompson, Symona Boniface and Billy Gilbert. The Boys mix up a concoction they pass off as Scotch to a liquor salesman who then wants to pass off the Stooges as Scotsmen to convince his boss to order the booze…\n\nSo Long Mr. Chumps (1941)\n\nDirected by Jules White. With Dorothy Appleby, John Tyrrell, Eddie Laughton and Vernon Dent. The boys are street sweepers who find an envelope full of valuable oil stocks which they return to the owner who asks them to search for an honest man to manage the funds. The Boys are having a hard time finding a virtuous man until they hatch a plan to break into prison where they’ve been told they find the fellow they are looking for.\n\nThree Pests in a Mess (1945)\n\nDirected by Del Lord. With Vernon Dent, Snub Pollard and Christine McIntyre. Trying to get a patent for their fly catching invention, the Stooges need to catch 100,000 flies, but gangsters think they have just won $100,000 dollars. While hiding from the crooks they are convinced they have accidentally killed someone. Trying to bury the “body,” they sneak into a nearby pet cemetery. The owners arrive, dressed for a masquerade party (of course!).\n\nSaved By the Belle (1939)\n\nDirected by Charlie Chase. With Carmen Laroux, Leroy Mason, Vernon Dent and Gino Corrado. The Stooges are not doing well as fur coat salesmen in a tropical, earthquake-prone country. To make matters worse, they are accused of attempting to assassinate the president. A beautiful revolutionary helps them escape, but they don’t have any more luck with the rebels. Facing a firing squad, does a sudden quake provide the break they need?\n\nStudio Stoops (1950)\n\nDirected by Edward Bernds. With Kenneth McDonald, Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre and Joe Palma. Yet more mistaken identities as the boys, exterminators, are hired as publicity agents for the studio’s new star actress. As a stunt, they decide to stage a kidnapping but the cops don’t believe them when some gangsters have more nefarious plans.\n\nDizzy Pilots (1943)\n\nDirected by Jules White. With Richard Fiske, Harry Semels and Al Thompson. Moe, Larry and Curly are the Wrong Brothers. They’ve got a military deferment while they complete “The Buzzard,” their new aircraft prototype. Of course, there are many pitfalls in getting the Buzzard off the ground and when they finally do take off, things don’t go well. So badly, in fact, that they are drafted into the Army, where the rest of their problems happen on the ground.\n\n(Program is subject to print availability)\n\nVisit The Three Stooges Official Web Site\n\nThe Three Stooges ® is a registered trademark of C3 Entertainment, Inc.
