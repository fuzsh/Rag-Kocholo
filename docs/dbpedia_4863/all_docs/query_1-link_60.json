        "text": "SUDBURY – Cambrian College is renaming one of its Health Sciences simulation labs after a long-time advocate for the nursing profession and community living.\n\nThe nursing lab at Cambrian will now be known as the Dorothy Winters Health Sciences Lab.\n\nDorothy Winters spent decades working as a nurse, first in hospitals in Toronto and Thunder Bay, and then in retirement homes. Even in retirement, Dorothy Winters advocated for better living, by remaining active with Ontario Special Olympics and the Lakehead Association for Community Living.\n\nCambrian College is delighted to pay tribute to the enduring legacy of Dorothy Winters. This idea of recognition arose because of the remarkable contributions made over the years by Dorothy’s son, Jesse Winters, who generously supports Cambrian College nursing students by providing bursaries through a substantial endowment each year. These bursaries have been instrumental in alleviating financial stressors by covering various expenses such as tuition, supply kits, textbooks and more.\n\n“My mother dedicated her life to serving others, and she instilled in us the belief that we should also give back to the community,” says Jesse Winters.\n\n“I am so proud that my mother’s legacy to health care and community living is being honoured by Cambrian College in this manner.”\n\nThe Dorothy Winters Health Sciences Lab provides in-depth and hands-on learning experiences for health sciences students at Cambrian’s main campus. Using medical mannequins and other front-line health care technologies, the lab simulates various health care settings such as emergency departments, hospital rooms, and labour/delivery rooms.\n\n“The Winters family has had a long and extensive relationship with Cambrian College, and I am so proud to know the Dorothy Winters Health Sciences Lab will play a key role in training the next generation of nurses,” explains Shawn Poland, Interim President of Cambrian College. “Dorothy Winters was devoted to her family and to the profession of nursing, and we are proud to honour her dedication to helping others by having her name as an enduring part of our nursing program.”"
