He went to New York but didn't stay long ( I found him on the passenger list) You have named on here some of his brothers and sisters which is great. My father John Appleby is still alive and living in Blackpool he also has a living brother Graham.\n\nI will write to Mrs Appleby and enclose some info.\n\nI will write to Jessie"
