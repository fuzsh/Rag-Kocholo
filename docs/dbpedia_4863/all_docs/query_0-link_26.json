        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI am looking for info on Arthur Frank Furr born c1910. He was the first husband of my Grandmother, Dorothy Emily May Cook 1905 - 1970. I believe he was from Hitchin Hertfordshire. In 1933 the couple had their second child, a daughter named Muriel Evelyn Furr. In about August Dorothy had taken their son, Trevor Ainsley Furr 1931- to the circus. Whilst there Arthur apparently MURDERED Muriel who was 7 weeks old. He claims that he dropped her.\n\nI have found newspaper articles dated 29th Aug 1933 and 6th Sept 1933, but nothing for later. I would like to know if he got sentenced, pleaded insanity etc. No one in the family knows what happened to him after the murder and we are now interested to find out. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis looks to be him in 1911:-\n\n1911 England Census about Arthur Furr\n\nName: Arthur Furr\n\nAge in 1911: 1\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1910\n\nRelation to Head: Grand Son\n\nGender: Male\n\nBirth Place: Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n\nCivil Parish: Hitchin Urban\n\nCounty/Island: Hertfordshire\n\nCountry: England\n\nStreet Address: 18 Bedford St, Hitchin, Herts\n\nRegistration District: Hitchin\n\nRegistration District Number: 136\n\nSub-registration District: Hitchin\n\nED, institution, or vessel: 5\n\nHousehold Schedule Number: 55\n\nPiece: 7594\n\nHousehold Members:\n\nName Age\n\nJames Wiggs 65\n\nAnn Wiggs 68\n\nMinnie Furr 33\n\nArthur Furr 1\n\nMaybe you could try and contact others searching this family to see if they know what happened to him?\n\nEngland & Wales, FreeBMD Marriage Index, 1837-1915 about Frank Furr\n\nName: Frank Furr\n\nDate of Registration: Jul-Aug-Sep 1908\n\nRegistration District: Hitchin\n\nInferred County: Hertfordshire\n\nVolume Number: 3a\n\nPage Number: 1425\n\nRecords on Page:\n\nName\n\nxxxx Frank Furr\n\nxxxx Minnie Wiggs\n\nClara Woodman\n\nThomas Worbey\n\nMaybe he remarried do you know when he and Dorothy divorced?\n\nMarriageFinder: Arthur F Furr married Maggie Macdonagh\n\nName: FURR, Arthur F\n\nRegistration district: Hendon\n\nCounty: Middlesex\n\nYear of registration: 1938\n\nQuarter of registration: Jul-Aug-Sep\n\nSpouse's last name: Macdonagh\n\nVolume no: 3A\n\nPage no: 2111\n\nName: MACDONAGH, Maggie\n\nRegistration district: Hendon\n\nCounty: Middlesex\n\nYear of registration: 1938\n\nQuarter of registration: Jul-Aug-Sep\n\nSpouse's last name: Furr\n\nVolume no: 3A\n\nPage no: 2111\n\nSo if this is him he wasn't in jail etc\n\nThis could be Frank Furr?\n\n1911 England Census about Frank Furr\n\nName: Frank Furr\n\nAge in 1911: 46\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1865\n\nRelation to Head: Head\n\nGender: Male\n\nBirth Place: Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n\nCivil Parish: Hitchin Urban\n\nCounty/Island: Hertfordshire\n\nCountry: England\n\nStreet Address: 9 Lancaster Road, Hitchin, Herts\n\nMarital status: Married\n\nOccupation: Carpenter Builder\n\nRegistration District: Hitchin\n\nRegistration District Number: 136\n\nSub-registration District: Hitchin\n\nED, institution, or vessel: 2\n\nHousehold Schedule Number: 151\n\nPiece: 7591\n\nHousehold Members:\n\nName Age\n\nFrank Furr 46\n\nFred Furr 12\n\nMildred Louise Furr 11\n\n............states married for 2yrs.\n\nSame person in 1901 with first wife:-\n\n1901 England Census about Frank Furr\n\nName: Frank Furr\n\nAge: 36\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1865\n\nRelation to Head: Head\n\nGender: Male\n\nSpouse: Louisa Furr\n\nBirth Place: Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n\nCivil Parish: Hitchin\n\nTown: Hitchin\n\nCounty/Island: Hertfordshire\n\nCountry: England\n\nStreet Address:\n\nOccupation: Journeyman Carpenter\n\nNeighbors: View others on page\n\nHousehold Members:\n\nName Age\n\nFrank Furr 36\n\nLouisa Furr 33\n\nFrank Furr 6\n\nFrederick Furr 2\n\nMildred Furr 1\n\n...................................Just a few more names you can put in \"search trees\" to see if you can find a connection.\n\n@patchem......Yes I have Dorothys 2nd marriage certificate and it says she was divorced from Arthur, so we know he was alive in 1938. I to saw the change of name article and wondered if it was the same man. Am going to look further into it.\n\n@Catherine... Good idea, I will look for other families etc who were connected to him, but from the looks of it he was either orphaned or adopted out to family members, but its something to look into.\n\n@All the other wonderful people...You have all given me some ideas which I will investigate, but what I really wanted to know was what happened to him after the death of his daughter Muriel.\n\n:-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D\n\n@Shirley.....No I havent got Muriels death certificate yet, but its an idea to get it. Just cant afford to keep buying certificates and have just ordered two.\n\nAlso yes those details you found is def my Grandmother Dorothy.\n\nI wonder if Arthur changed his name after leaving prison or something, but only changing one letter is not very adventurous, lol.\n\n;-) ;-) ;-) ;-)"
