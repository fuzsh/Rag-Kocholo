The trustees of the charity have kindly shared it below:\n\nSanctuary\n\n150 years of Mrs de Lannoy Cottages\n\nFour gables, proud on Beacon Road,\n\nproclaim their birth: 1, 8, 7, 4.\n\nToday, the heart of Crowborough presses round:\n\nhouse agents, pizzas, chapel, doctors, pub;\n\nhedge filtering the daily traffic’s hum\n\nand evening visits from the kebab van.\n\nIt wasn’t always so, when Mrs D,\n\nreplete with widow’s unexpected wealth,\n\nendowed this house, this sanctuary,\n\nraised high upon a Wealden ridge.\n\nA refuge, shelter, second chance\n\nfor “inmates with a Protestant belief”.\n\nNot all was perfect in that quiet retreat.\n\nThe trail to toilets down the garden path\n\nnow rectified by all mod cons within\n\nand water paid for, faults repaired\n\nbeneath the watchful eye of those\n\nwho oversee and delegate such things.\n\nSo here they came, expectant eyed,\n\nand found a welcome they did not presume;\n\nin hugs, warm words and friendships dear.\n\nA garden to bring peace, a plot to tend\n\nand, more than this, a hint of springtime\n\nin the autumn of their days.\n\nStill stands that need, and still they come\n\nas widows, spinsters, married pairs\n\nto live content in Beeches’ Haven Homes\n\nor in Swift House, the latest of the line.\n\nA time of rest before the evening dims.\n\nA shaft of sunlight before shadows fall.\n\nPeter Charles Jackson June 2024\n\nYou can also watch the service on YouTube here – To Celebrate 150 years of Crowborough Almshouses (youtube.com)\n\nFor 150 years, the charity has been helping elderly local people and those from further afield to find independent living in a safe and secure place in one of four almshouses.\n\nThe Crowborough Almshouses provide a friendly and caring community where older people are encouraged to live full and active lives within the setting of high quality housing, support, comfort and security.\n\ntop photo – screen shots from YouTube video detailed above\n\nposted 24 June 2024\n\nGirton Town Charity welcomes HRH Duke of Gloucester\n\nA glorious day for Girton Town Charity who welcomed HRH The Duke of Gloucester on Thursday 13 June 2024 for a special visit.\n\nGirton Town Charity welcomed our Royal Vice Patron, His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester to their new award-winning “Passivhaus” almshouse development in the heart of Girton in Cambridge.\n\nHis Royal Highness was warmly received by His Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire Julie Spence, Nick Phillips, CEO of The Almshouse Association, Willie Hartley-Russell, Chairman of The Almshouse Association, and Ann Bonnett, Chair of Girton Town Charity.\n\nThe Duke was introduced to trustees and staff at Dovehouse Court, after which he embarked on a tour of the UK’s first fully accredited Passivhaus almshouse development.\n\nDuring the tour, Ian Bramwell, Director of Mole Architects and the mind behind the development showcased the interior of one of the new almshouses. The Duke also had the pleasure of visiting resident Diana Henderson in her home and sharing some homemade pastries and cakes with residents.\n\nThe event was commemorated with the unveiling of a plaque and Ann Bonnett expressed the Charity’s gratitude to The Duke, saying\n\n“it has been a great pleasure to show you around our new almshouses so you could see first-hand these homes for the future.”\n\nAnn then presented His Royal Highness with a signed copy of local photographer Martin Bond’s new book, ‘Cambridge: Town & Gown.’\n\nBefore departing, The Duke remarked,\n\n“I am delighted to have been able to come to Dovehouse Court today to see and hear about your ground-breaking development. It is very impressive that your charity, which has a 500-year history, is now looking to the future with these inspiring homes which have preserved the principles of traditional almshouse design with shared gardens and a community courtyard.”\n\nNick Phillips, CEO of The Almshouse Association, added,\n\n“We are very honoured to receive HRH The Duke of Gloucester at one of our member charities, particularly to show off the first example of a new Passivhaus-certified almshouse development. The Duke seemed very interested in how the charity blended historic design with cutting-edge environmental engineering around a welcoming community courtyard, synonymous with almshouse architectural design.”\n\nEarlier this year, Dovehouse Court was highly commended in the Best New Building Over £2 Million category at the 2024 Greater Cambridge Design and Construction Awards, hosted by the Cambridge Forum for the Construction Industry (CFCI) at Pembroke College.\n\nPassivhaus is a leading international low-energy design standard, offering a proven and cost-effective method to achieve carbon reduction targets. Its key features include high levels of insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, strict airtightness, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, resulting in low energy costs and improved indoor air quality.\n\nposted 21 June 2024\n\nLevel 4 Housing Qualification with the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH)\n\nClerk’s personal experience of the new Housing Qualification\n\nA clerk of a registered almshouse charity with 16 properties is nearing the completion of her Level 4 Housing Course with the CIH and thought other members may find it useful to hear about her experience of the course so far. Note, the qualification is only applicable to Registered Providers.\n\nShe writes:\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThe basic year-long level 4 Housing Course with the CIH comprises 6 modules on various aspects of housing management and is delivered through ‘Moodle’ (an online training package).\n\nAround 8-9 weeks is allowed to complete each module with no breaks in study unless modules are completed before the due dates.\n\nThere is limited online contact with the other course attendees via online forum- based activities.\n\nCompletion of each module comprises a written assignment of around 2-3000 words plus quick online activities to submit via Moodle.\n\nProvisional pass or fail results (not grades) are released around a month after the closing date of each assignment, with three attempts allowed to complete each stage.\n\nThe course guidance suggests that 8 hours a week study is needed to get through each of the modules that comprise the course, but this may not be enough.\n\nCosts\n\nThe basic package which currently costs £2410 (costed £2250 in September 2023) includes limited contact with a tutor via Moodle messaging.*\n\nThe deluxe package with 6 online study days with a tutor costs £2930. *\n\n*Note, prices vary from approved centre to approved centre\n\nClerk’s Personal comments\n\nIt has been hard to complete the course whilst still working and at times the charity’s work has suffered. My trustees have been extremely supportive through this process increasing my hours to cover the extra work.\n\nWhilst I have cursed a lot at the volume of reports and housing law to read, the course has been interesting and I feel more confident about my responsibilities and can see where the Charity needs to make changes for the future.\n\nThank you Tina, for sharing your experience.\n\nNote: The Almshouse Association has argued hard for longer periods for clerks to qualify and an exemption for trustees, proposing that our members have 4 years from April 2024 to start the qualification and 4 years to complete the course.\n\nThe consultation with Government is still not confirmed.

Those six weeks were the toughest I have experienced in my life both physically and mentally. At the end of each week you had exams and if you were not good enough you would be dropped. But I lasted and was appointed an officer then sent to Troon for officer training for another six weeks and then appointed to a tank landing craft ready for the D-Day landings.\n\nThe war had been going for quite a considerable period of time for my training was in readiness for the D-Day landings the time of which we did not know then.\n\nI was part of the initial wave that landed at the village of La Rivière as part of the Gold Beach landings. I was in a flotilla which were the first to go into the beach with two tanks on top of each other on the landing craft so that they could bombard the beach with shells as they were coming in to land. We didn’t lose anybody that day although the landing craft was damaged by the underwater objects as we were going in.\n\nThen following the landing we were offloading equipment to the beaches and whilst doing so I had to go to the tented hospital at Bayeux with suspected peritonitis which turned out to be appendicitis.\n\nI was sent to Plymouth to HMS Foliot, running all the movement of landing craft. We were tropicalizing (adding refrigeration and air conditioning) landing craft ready for the Far East but of course that collapsed because they dropped the atomic bomb.”\n\nTo all the men and women who served in the war and those who sacrificed their own lives for our freedom – we are forever grateful.\n\nposted 6 June 2024\n\nRomsey Municipal Charities – Kents Almshouses, Middlebridge Street, Romsey\n\nAccommodation\n\nOne bedroom first floor unfurnished flat (with stair lift)\n\nSituated in a small friendly scheme for a single female only of retirement age and with a connection to Romsey\n\nAccess to well-maintained gardens and in walking distance of Romsey town centre\n\nCriteria\n\nResidents must be able to live independently as no care is provided by the charity\n\nApplicants should be in housing, financial or other significant need\n\nNo pets are allowed and no smoking on any part of the site\n\nContact Details\n\nApplication form and further details available from:\n\nCharity Administrator to Kents: kentsromsey@gmail.com\n\nor post an enquiry to: Mrs Carolyn Finch, Charity Administrator,\n\nKents Almshouses, c/o Romsey Town Hall, 1 Market Place, Romsey SO51 8YZ\n\nDeadline for applications: Monday 1st July 2024\n\nTAA Board Key Decisions: a record\n\nYou must be logged in to access this page - Members Login Website Registration\n\nTrustee and Chairman – Winchester\n\nThe Friends of St Cross Hospital Winchester is a sister charity (No 1143173) to the Hospital of St Cross and raises funds for it through memberships and other fund-raising activities.
