        "text": "Serving Families Since 1998.\n\nSerenity Funeral Homes was opened in 1998, as a family owned and operated firm and still continues to be family owned and operated. In today’s world of the large corporations buying up the small firms, and taking the personal and home town atmosphere out of the funeral profession, we are proud to say that we continue to be not only a friend to the families we serve, but also a neighbor in their community. Our motto from the beginning has been that “We treat every family as if they were a member of our own family.”\n\nWe are very proud of our community and are honored that each family we have had a chance to serve can know that their loved one has been treated with the utmost respect and dignity.\n\nWe have a modern facility with ample paved parking off the street, for your safety and convenience. The interior of the facility is spacious with a large Entrance to better fill the needs of each family."
