I know the people who live there are friendly but there is something unique about Uttoxeter itself and it may be to do with its architecture and layout with several streets leading into the historic Market Place making it a natural focal point with its old buildings, pubs, shops and narrow alleys like Back Lane (was Queen Street) and Market Street tempting you to have a wander down them. I only lived there for five years in the 1990s but have been visiting it on and off for nearly thirty years and have witnessed many changes in that time.\n\nPostcard courtesy Roy Lewis. Market Day Uttoxeter circa 1950s.\n\nFortunately the town centre itself has not changed that much in that time but the Cattle Market behind the Town Hall is gone replaced with housing, a supermarket, shops and a car park, Balance Street has lost its balance in a way and some old houses which were derelict for years have been demolished and replaced with modern houses. Thankfully the lovely old houses at the western end are still standing. Carter Street hasn’t fared too badly in comparison. I think perhaps Uttoxeter is unspoiled and the centre would probably be recognisable today – give or take a new building or two – to someone who lived here 100, 200 and possibly 500 years ago. Anyway in this blog I am going to try and record the things I like about Uttoxeter past and present, people and places in words and pictures and hopefully other kindred lovers of the town whether Uxonians or not, will enjoy them. There are some interesting old properties some still standing and some lost for ever and I am going to try and share some of my research on these. Although I’ve been researching local history for years I am only a novice at writing a blog but I am hopeful that I will get better at posting with experience. Instead of writing a book I am doing a blog which I can add to or amend at any time. Uttoxeter has an interesting and forgotten social past and I am going to try and uncover it. I have as yet to discover how to make the best display of the photos so for the moment I am going along with what WordPress does in this matter. I’m afraid that sometimes when I update the post some of the headings seem to do their own thing so I apologise and hope to master it one day. So if you see some things that don’t look quite right put it down to my lack of digital skills.\n\nI am keen to freely share photos, information and research with anyone interested in Uttoxeter’s past but would ask that if you use any of the contents on a public site that you acknowledge this site as your source and credit the authors or owners of any images, articles or information just as I have tried to do on this blog. We are only temporary custodians of these artefacts and there are many many people long gone who have helped to contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the past. I would like to acknowledge my debt to them all here. Contributions and suggestions are welcome and please feel free to comment. I think everyone should have a blog about the places and things they like and especially if they own a unique property. Uttoxeter is a great place to start with and Word Press is free. If you see anything on this blog which infringes copyright in any way please let me know and I will remove it or acknowledge the owner or copyright holder. I am hoping to add new items, new information and make amendments and additions where required, so keep checking. Please feel free to pass share this blog.

They weren’t far away though.\n\nUTTOXETER\n\nOriginally called Wotocheshede an Anglo-Saxon settlement possibly meaning Wuttuc’s homestead on the Heath. In 1066 it had been an Anglo-Saxon settlement held by Earl Algar when the Normans under William the Conqueror invaded England from France and subjugated the country. He quickly organised the detailed recording of every piece of land he had conquered. It was published in 1086 and called the Domesday Book.\n\nMaps and site by Anna Powell-Smith.

If you are lucky you will find other people who are searching for your ancestors and have compiled a Family Tree. You may need to scroll through lots of pages and there’s no guarantee that there will be anything. Family History research is a slow process and is forever.\n\nI also have a search on Family Search the Latter Day Saints site which is free but you need to register.\n\nThe 1881 census is free to explore. The Lost Cousins online site uses the 1881 census as the starting point for anyone searching for their ancestors and hopefully connecting you to cousins also searching for them.. Lost Cousins – Putting Relatives In Touch\n\nIt is worth joining the Uttoxeter Facebook Pages to flag up your particular interest.

I would recommend anyone starting in Family History Research to join such a society. I think Uttoxeter would come under West Midlands Group of Family History Societies | Facebook\n\nCurious Fox is another useful site which you can browse for free but need to subscribe to post or request – about £5 I think – CuriousFox UK genealogy message boards – villages, towns, local history, UK maps\n\nBull-Baiting in Uttoxeter\n\nBull-baiting it seems was a popular ‘sporting’ tradition once a year in Uttoxeter. In her memories of Uttoxeter My Own Story or Auto-biography of a Child published in 1845 and again in 1863 Mary Howitt recalls the bull-baiting which occurred in the autumn. Mary’s family lived in Balance Street and their maid’s name was Nanny not short for Nancy or a term of her role.\n\n“A custom of the town was the annual bull-baiting – a practice which our father combated for many years, and at last succeeded in entirely putting an end to. This bull-baiting occurred in the autumn. At the fair at that season a handsome bull was bought, and a day or two before the baiting was lead round the town decorated with ribands, and attended by a rude rabble of men and boys. The patrons of the sport on this occasion gave money, some more some less: at our house, of course, nothing was ever given. We watched with a kind of horror the passing of this procession from our nursery window, and Nanny, who seemed not to have by any means the abhorrence of the thing which we had been taught to feel, took the liveliest interest in it, and even once, to the great scandal of the whole household, threw out a riband for the bull’s horns. On the morning of the bull-baiting, towards four or five o’clock, the inhabitants of the town were awoke in their beds by the bull’s chain being struck violently against the walls of their houses and on the pavement before them. In the early, chill grey of the morning it came – a sort of yell and a banging of this heavy iron chain, and a rattling, and a grinding, another yell, and then they went on.\n\nAgain the bull, decorated with garlands and ribands, was led round the town, accompanied by all the rabble of the neighbourhood, hallooing and shouting like so many savages. We always watched the processions go, and always felt a kind of curdling horror. At ten o’clock the bull was fixed to the stake in the market-place, and such of the higher class of the inhabitants as patronised the sport occupied the upper windows of the houses, and market-place itself was thronged with people, leaving a space in the middle for the poor creature and his tormentors.\n\nWhile we were playing in the garden on the three days that this lasted we heard the barking and yelling of the dogs, the roar of the bull, and the shouts of the people. Sometimes, too, the creature broke his chain, and ran furiously through the streets, driving everything before him, and often doing much damage. If the bull came as far as our house, we never failed to see it, for to us,of course, this was a very fearful, but interesting spectacle, and furnished enough talk for a week.\n\nAfter the third day’s sport the bull was shot. This seemed to me like a short of murder, and I remember very innocently saying what I really felt, that I wondered that old William Woolley, who shot the bull, was not afraid of being haunted by his ghost. I said this gravely, meaning what I said, before grown-up people, and I could not conceive why everybody burst into a fit of laughter.”\n\nG F of Endon relates his memories of a bull-bait at Uttoxeter about 1818.

The original disappeared some years ago gone without trace. Below is a photo of a watercolour painting that was hanging in the headteacher’s office at Alleyne’s in 2016 when I was invited to visit the school by headteacher Mrs J Rudge. I had been hoping to see the original but after looking at it I knew that it was a recent watercolour because of the brightness of the colours. I would have expected the colours to have faded a bit after 170 odd years. A faded copy of a newspaper article on the back of the painting confirmed that this was not the original. The wording on the bottom left of the original ‘The Grammar School in Uttoxeter of Thomas Allen MD Priest’ does not appear on the copy nor does the school logo with three talbots. The ‘sun’ in the photo is the reflection of the flash on my camera but you can see that the painting is not the original.\n\nW G Torrance in The History of Alleyne’s Grammar School 1658-1958 commented on the painting which was then (1958) hanging in the school hall.\n\nSchool’s search for Missing Picture\n\nTwenty three years ago in 1994 Peter Davies, the then headteacher of Alleyne’s, put an appeal in the Uttoxeter Post and Times asking for information about the missing picture. He believed that the painting had been done by headmaster Rev. John Kinder back in the 1840s or by his successor Rev W W Harvey. Having seen some of the paintings done by John Kinder I think it was more likely to have been painted by him or even his sister. At the time of my visit to Alleyne’s I took a quick photo of a newspaper article on the back of the painting in the head’s office which unfortunately is blurred. It reported that the painting used to hang in the school’s Trinity Hall but it had not been seen since and once again the photo is blurred so it could be 1984. What ever the year, it’s been missing for a long time and should be returned to its rightful owners Alleyne’s High School, Uttoxeter. It may be hanging on a wall in someone’s house or office and they are not aware of its heritage or its true home. It could be forgotten in someone’s attic or a cupboard. Maybe it’s already been sold at some auction house somewhere. Keep an eye out for it on e-bay or on auction sites. It would be great to see the old watercolour back where it belongs Alleyne’s it’s true home.\n\nUnveiling a plaque in Bridge Street Uttoxeter June 11th 1958 to mark the site of the original Alleyne’s Boys’ Grammar School on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the school in 1558.

Previously it had been called Bank House. It had been a private house and a was used as a private school for young ladies in the early 1800s. Rev John Kinder, the master at Alleyne’s Grammar School, lived here between January 1847 and 1855, with his sisters Sarah and Charlotte Kinder and their mother Fanny. The school was still in School House Lane present day Bridge Street. The Rev Kinder resigned his post in 1855 and emigrated to New Zealand in July of that year.\n\nView of the Master’s House (Bank House) Uttoxeter circa 1845/1850 by Sarah Kinder, Rev John Kinder’s sister.

Photo David Whitmore.\n\nThe area and shops on both sides of Uttoxeter War Memorial was once known as Bear Hill. It is shown on Lightfoot’s 1658 map of Uttoxeter and he called in Bare Hill. (Map below). Where the memorial stands bottom right there was a block of several shops with living accommodation above which backed onto Bridge Street and again they are shown on the 1658 map. On either side of the block of houses was a narrow lane leading into Bridge Street. In later years after the houses were demolished the area was called Market Square. The original Alleyne’s Grammar School was on the site where the buildings with the large roofs are.\n\nBridge Street showing the houses in the area known as Bear Hill jutting out into the road top left. Many years later the houses and shops were knocked down and the war memorial built there.\n\nA view of Bear Hill Uttoxeter showing the Red Lion Hotel, part of St Mary’s Parish Church and Mr W Wood’s shop where the War Memorial now stands. It was somewhere near here that Samuel Johnson’s father is said to have had his bookstall and that Johnson spent an hour in the rain on the market day doing penance for his refusal to take his father’s place when he was too ill to attend his stall. The building on the right was demolished in the late 1920s and a War Memorial was built on the site which you can see in the postcard below.\n\nThe above view of Market Square looking west taken some time circa 1950s-60s shows the extent of Market Square and the area once known as Bear Hill. The building on the right with the two women in front was the Red Lion Inn or Hotel. The Market Place is further west. The lane on the left was known as Back Lane and renamed Queen Street much later.\n\nUttoxeter Lost Generation\n\nUttoxeter Lost Generation is an online site dedicated to remembering Uttoxeter’s War Dead of World War 1.

It’s probably a lot older as in the mid 1700s a law was enacted obliging Turnpike Trusts to erect mile distance markers. I’m amazed that the inscription is in such good condition when you compare it to the one outside Manor House round the corner in High Street. You can see both in the excellent report on Staffordshire Mile Markers – link below. It is called A Sylloge of Mile Markers in Staffordshire and the Uttoxeter section was written by John Higgins in 2008. He mentions a mile post in New Road which unfortunately I’ve never seen. The one near Checkley below is quite visible as you drive along but not as old.\n\nMile Marker at Checkley Photo Jim Foley\n\nFor some reason the link below is not working even though I have updated it.

The area by the War Memorial was at one time called Market Square and it was near here that Samuel Johnson was said to have done his penance. Photo David Whitmore from his book Gently Thru’ Life: The Old Vicarage, Uttoxeter to the Arabian Empty quarter and Kind Hussain’s Jordan.\n\nThese photos of Uttoxeter taken from the spire of St Mary’s are two of my favourites as they show so much. In the first the roofing of the JCB factory top right on the Stafford Road by the Hockley is amazing. Who’d have ever thought that one day it would be gone. Balance Street where Mary Botham, married name Howitt, lived as child runs parallel with the factory. Where the war memorial stands bottom left we are told is where Samuel Johnson’s father had his bookstall and it was here Samuel in 1784 is said to have spent an hour atoning for his pride in refusing to help his father out one day when he was ill fifty years earlier in 1734. Of course it would have been beneath the dignity of a learned like him to run a bookstall in the Market Place in Uttoxeter. The three story building facing the Market Place with the black strips on a white wall was once the site of a pub called The Nag’s Head later renamed The Vine Inn. It was here in 1863 that the American author Nathaniel Hawthorn had a good lunch when he came to visit the site of Johnson’s penance and was disappointed when no one could tell him where the site was. Sources to follow.\n\nIt seems it was also here that the pig market was held, where the stocks were kept to punish offenders and even a pond to duck cuckolds. Redfern’s history main source for this.\n\nThe large open space at the bottom of Bridge Street in the above photo now has the large Waitrose supermarket and car park on it. The white gable end of the building on the left side is that of The Wheatsheaf pub. Again in those days you never thought of things changing. The original Alleyne’s Grammar School was on the right of Bridge Street approximately where the newish building with the large expanse of roofs are.\n\nThe Good Old Days in Uttoxeter\n\nWe think things are bad today in 2017 and hanker back after the good old days but looking through old newspapers Uttoxeter had its own problems with crime and anti-social behaviour back in early 1800s. One flinches though at some of the punishments inflicted for what to us would be a petty crime. Did such harsh punishments deter others one wonders? I doubt it.\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 27 January 1798\n\nBy kind permission of the British Newspaper Archive.\n\nOxford Journal – Saturday 23 July 1825\n\nBy kind permission of the British Newspaper Archive.\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 07 January 1832\n\nWolverhampton Chronicle and Staffordshire Advertiser – Wednesday 17 October 1832 By kind permission of the British Newspaper Archive.\n\nStaffordshire Gazette and County Standard – Saturday 26 October 1839\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 19 May 1849 By kind permission of the British Newspaper Archive.\n\nUttoxeter’s Hidden Gem\n\nThe Hall, Alleyne’s High School, Dove Bank\n\nOnly a small number of pupils and teachers from Alleyne’s High School and not many inhabitants will know about Uttoxeter’s hidden gem right in the centre of the school. Most of them will pass it everyday and not give it a second thought. It really is Uttoxeter’s best kept secret. The four storey Georgian building is tucked away in the grounds of the school hemmed in by school buildings some built right up to it and others so near it that it is difficult to get a photo of the whole building. At one time this mansion stood proudly in its own grounds with a sweeping drive surrounded by gardens with its own pastures and stables and wonderful views over the Dove Valley to the east. The main office and foyer of the school now stand on what was once the drive to the house or mansion once known as The Hall, Dove Bank. In 1922 it was bought by Staffordshire County Council as the new premises for recently renamed Uttoxeter Girls’ High School which had previously been the Manor House School for Girls on High Street. In 1964 Alleyne’s Boys’ Grammar School and Uttoxeter Girls’ High School were amalgamated and The Hall became part of the new Alleyne’s High School. At one time around the 1990s this magnificent building was neglected but fortunately someone in Staffordshire County Council recognised it as unique building and it was refurbished. In February 1996 The Hall was reopened and named Ross House after the last Head Mistress of Uttoxeter Girls’ High School. and it has been a Grade 2 Listed Building since 1976.The Hall on Dove Bank which became the home of Uttoxeter’s Girls’ High School in 1922 and in 1974 became part of Alleyne’s High School. Photo courtesy John Woodward of Fole from a 1928 Uttoxeter Girls’ High School souvenir brochure. This photo is of the rear of the property which faces east.\n\nThe online Listed Buildings site has the following description: “the three storey building with basement now forming part of Alleyne’s High School is late 18th century Roughcast with stone and stucco dressings, two storeys, attic and basement, mid-19th century gabled ashlar porch projects at centre with moulded frieze and cornice and a sash window in moulded architrave with cambered head; two sash windows to the left of this and one to the right, in moulded stucco frames with cambered heads, bands at ground and third floors, quoins, moulded stucco eaves. Porch doorway has rusticated surround with segmental arched head and keyblock, double panelled doors, side-lights and plain fanlight, slates. Good rear elevation formerly to garden, interior has good pine staircase and Adam-style decorations done early 20th century”. Listing NGR: SK0933633756.\n\nIn September 2016 I had the privilege of being allowed by Head Teacher Mrs Rudge to visit Alleyne’s High School and allowed to have a look round the inside of The Hall. In the short time I was there I took as many photos as I could with my small camera but I am sure I missed a lot. It would need someone more competent than me with more time and suitable equipment to fully capture the exquisite features of the interior and exterior of this lovely Georgian property. Any students at Alleyne’s with an aptitude or interest in art, architecture or photography have a most suitable subject here as a focus and expression for their work. Possibly it has already been done but the unique features of the property could do with being recorded perhaps on an online blog for all the world to see, something which Alleyne’s High School could be truly proud of.\n\nPhotos below courtesy Jim Foley\n\nStaff at Uttoxeter Girls’ High School 1928\n\nUttoxeter Girls’ High School The Hall Dove Bank in 1928 showing what was then the main entrance.

Ever since I read the notification in the Derby Mercury of March 5 1789 that Thomas Gardner Uttoxeter builder and architect was moving to his old house in Balance Street I was convinced that it had to be Leighton House because of its similarity to Bank House in Church Street. Bank House was built by him about 1776-7 in partnership with Derby builder Thomas Freeman for Uttoxeter banker Thomas Hart. Leighton House was the name given to the house in Balance Street by the Bamford family who once lived there but in the 1911 census Henry Bamford called it The Old House.\n\nSince then I have been looking for evidence that can confirm my theory that Leighton House is Thomas Gardner’s house. In 1789 Thomas Gardner advertised in the Derby Mercury that he was moving to his own house in Ballance Street. Derby Mercury March 5 1789\n\nImage reproduced by kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nThomas Gardner died in 1804 and was obviously a man of some importance as he was buried in the crypt at St Mary’s Parish Church.\n\nMary Howitt, nee Botham provides an important piece of evidence in her biography My Own Story Auto-biography of a Child published in 1843. The Botham family lived in the house now known as Howitt Place the next house on the right of Leighton House at 57 Balance Street. Mary who would have been six or seven at the time describes their neighbour, a builder’s widow, on the left hand side. “On the left of us stood a handsome house, which belonged to and was inhabited by, a Mrs Carpenter, the widow of a considerable builder in the place. She was a very proud and stately lady, and had it was said, great connections in London. Before she married Mr Carpenter she was the widow of an officer in the East India Service; she had been abroad and had much property. There was, according to our childish notions, something quite grand about her house; it was tall and handsome, with lofty windows, and a large door, and a vast many offices about it, which however were in her days rather old and tumble-down. But the lady lived in the grand house, and we used to see her driving out in her heavy, lumbering coach, or else walking with a very dignified air in her large handsome garden, which adjoined ours, with a huge black calash on her head, and clogs on her feet.” Mrs Carpenter is of course a pseudo name for Mrs Gardner who fell out with Mrs Botham when she put her washing out to dry on a day when Mrs Carpenter was expecting guests. From that day forth they were on cold terms.\n\nIn January 1805 Mrs Gardner advertised that the yard and workshops of her late husband in Balance Street were to be let. “The premises belonging to the late Mr GARDNER, Architect and Builder, situated in the Balance Street, Uttoxeter, consisting of a large convenient Yard, large Workshops, Drying Kiln, Saw Pit, and every Requisite for carrying on the Building Business, or may be converted to various other purposes.” She didn’t live for long after her husband’s death and she died after a short illness while on a visit to London on September 1st 1806. Her body was returned to Uttoxeter where it was buried in the family crypt. In October the contents of the house were advertised for sale and soon after the house must have been put up for sale but as yet I have not found an advertisement.\n\nSoon after it seems the house was bought by a Captain Taylor as a family home for his wife and two children. It was autumn 1806. Again I am indebted to Mary Howitt. “One morning before the sale we were told that a gentleman and lady were expected to take luncheon at our house. They came; he a stately looking man in volunteer uniform; she a most quiet and elegant woman, and with them came two sweet children about our own age, a boy John and a girl Sara. The children informed us that their father was going to buy Mrs Carpenter’s house and they were coming to live here, and that we would be good friends when they came. The sale took place as expected, Captain Taylor bought the place. In a few weeks the gentleman and lady and their servants came, but not the children: they were now with some friends, and were to come later when the house was in order.”\n\n“There was great excitement in Uttoxeter at the planned arrival of the first stage coach ever to pass through it. Previously letters had been brought to the town by a boy who went to a neighbouring town – Lichfield – on a little lean horse to collect it. Now it would arrive by coach. Mary and her sister Anna were taken by their maid Nanny to see its arrival outside the White Hart Hotel. Mary wrote “Children who have seen stage-coaches all their lives, can have no idea what an event this first stage-coach really was. I never felt so excited in my life as when it came dashing down the street – Carter Street – all covered with ribands, and flags flying, and a French-horn blowing, for in those days stage-coaches had their guards. All the town was up; people hurrahed and waved their hats, and were quite enthusiastic. Horses now-a-days are changed in a coach in three minutes but then it was not so then; they must have been a full twenty minutes over it, but that was all the better for there was more time to notice everything thoroughly.” Mary and her sister were astonished to learn later that their new neighbours’ children had arrived on that first stage coach to pass through Uttoxeter. What we cannot be certain of is whether the name Taylor is fictional or not. You can read more about the two families in the online version of Mary Howitt’s My Own Story.\n\nIn the Derby Mercury of February 4 1824 a valuable property in Balance Street is advertised to be sold by auction at the White Hart and Star Inn. It was the residence of Mr Enoch Hand.\n\nImage reproduced by kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nIn the sales details above Lot 2 describes a plot of land for sale opposite Mr Enoch Hand’s house. On John Wood’s 1828 plan of Uttoxeter the house is shown next to the Botham House and the piece of land is shown on the opposite side of Balance Street. This is another pointer to this being Thomas Gardner’s old house.\n\nEight years later in 1832 the house was advertised for sale in the Staffordshire Advertiser 17 November at an auction at the White Hart Inn. It is described as having been built by Mr Gardner, one of the most eminent architects of the day, for his own occupation adding another piece of the jigsaw linking Leighton House to Thomas Gardner. The description is practically word for word from the earlier sales details eight years previously but in addition gives the room dimensions. This time Mr Hawthorn, surgeon is the owner.\n\nLot 1 All that substantial and well-built Messuage or Dwelling-House situate and being in Balance Street, in Uttoxeter, the residence of Mr Hawthorn, Surgeon, with a walled garden, planted with the choicest fruit trees, and pleasure grounds lying behind the same to the south aspect; a convenient Surgery, with store room over, a spacious room adjoining, (well calculated for an Attorney’s Offices), corn chamber, mangle room, piggery, saddle house, and stabling for two horses with loft over the same.\n\nThe house consists of an extensive hall, 23ft. by 8, dining room 19 ft. by 17, drawing room 17 ft. by 15, and breakfast room 12 ft. by 11, excellent kitchen, back kitchen, butler’s pantry, Brewhouse, wash-house, with hard and soft water pumps, and commodious arched cellars; on the first floor are four airy and highly finished lodging rooms with closets and on the second floor are three servants’ rooms; the whole in most complete repairs, and it for the immediate reception of a genteel family.\n\nN.B. The building on Lot 1 was erected by, and under the immediate direction of the late Mr Gardiner, one of the most eminent architects of the day, and for his own occupation, consequently any further comments as to its conveniences, is considered superfluous.\n\nFurther details for Lot 2 again pinpoint the location of the house. Lot 2 All that Plot or piece of ground in front of the said dwelling-house, and on the opposite side of Balance Street aforesaid, now used by the said Mr Hawthorn, as a kitchen garden, together with the building erected thereon (now converted into two convenient dwelling-houses) with the addition of a two stalled stable and carriage-house adjoining thereto.\n\nOn John Wood’s 1828 Plan of Uttoxeter Mrs Stubbs is shown as living at the house next door to Thomas Gardner’s old house. Mrs Stubbs could possibly be the widow of the Rev Jonathan Stubs curate of Uttoxeter who died in December 1810 as a result of a fall from a gig a type of horse drawn vehicle.\n\nThe 1839 Uttoxeter Tithe Map show the house in Balance Street as Plot No 225 and the Awards show that the house and garden are owned and occupied by Mary Herring with some offices occupied by CL Greaves. Her neighbour at the house marked Plot No 224 is Ann Stubbs. Her neighbour on the other side in Samuel Botham’s old house is either George Alsop or Thomas Fradgley. The confusion arises as Samuel Botham owned two houses here, his own house and the one next door later called Mayfield House that he bought as an investment.\n\nThere is a bit of a puzzle with identifying which Mary Herring was living in Thomas Gardner’s house. In 1781 the Rev Athanasius Herring Vicar of Uttoxeter aged 82 married Miss Mary Carr aged 22 a rich young woman also of Uttoxeter. This would mean she was born in 1759. They had four children twins Mary and Elizabeth baptised 1782, Priscilla baptised 1786 and John baptised 1789 all at St Mary’s Parish Church Uttoxeter. The Rev Athanasius Herring died in 1791 and was buried on January 8 in the graveyard of St Mary’s. In his will he left his estate at Woodgate, Uttoxeter to his wife Mary with one of the executors being named as Thomas Phillips a widower who married Mary Herring on September 11, 1794. Mary Herring nee Carr b.1758 was the widow of Rev. Athanasius Herring (1721–1791) vicar of Uttoxeter 1768 -1791. Their son John later Colonel Herring became famous for his exploits in with East India Company in India.\n\nThe 1841 census shows that Mary Herring, 53, is single, and of independent means. There are two young children living with her John and Camilla Herring both aged two and three female servants. Who was Mary Herring and who were the two young children? She was the daughter of the Rev. Athanasius Herring Vicar of Uttoxeter 1768 -1791 who married Mary Carr a rich woman from Uttoxeter. There was a lot of gossip when they were married in\n\nUttoxeter in 1781 with the newspapers saying that Rev Athanasius Herring aged 82 had married Mary Carr a rich woman aged just 22.\n\nIn 1841 Mary Herring 53 a single woman of independent means is living at Thomas Gardner’s old house. This Mary would have been born in 1788. So who is she and what relation is she to Mary Herring, nee Carr born 1759? There are two young children living with her John and Camilla Herring both aged 2 as well as three female servants. Whose children are they? The Herrings’ son John married to Eliza Ann had two children twins John and Camilla baptized August 6th 1839 Uttoxeter and these have to be the children living with Mary Herring. Ann Stubbs 65 of independent means is still living in the house next door on the left. George Alsop surgeon 65 and his family are her neighbours on the other side in Samuel Botham’s old house.\n\nThe couple had four children, Mary Herring and her twin sister Elizabeth, born in 1782, Priscilla born in 1786 and John born in 1789. Rev Athanasius Herring died in January 1791 aged 70 meaning he was 60 when he married Mary Carr. He was buried on January 8 in the graveyard of St Mary’s Uttoxeter. One wonders if the Herring family ever lived in the vicarage opposite St Mary’s Parish Church in Church Street for in his will Athanasius Herring left his estate at Woodgate, Uttoxeter to his wife Mary with one of the executors being named as Thomas Phillips a widower.\n\nOn September 11, 1794 three years after her husband’s death Mary Herring married Thomas Phillips widower. Mary Philips died on June 11, 1826 aged 72 which means she was 29 when she married Rev Athanasius Herring in 1781. The twin children staying with Mary Herring in 1841 in Balance Street were the children of her younger brother John Herring an officer with the East India Company being Lt. Colonel ofthe 37th Regiment Bengal Native infantry who was murdered in India in 1839. He had married Eliza Ann Loveday in India in 1834. She had been born in what is now Indonesia. They had three children all born in India, Mary Augusta, and twins John and Camilla, all baptised on August 6th 1839 at St Mary’s Parish Church Uttoxeter. I am grateful to Neil Deaville Uttoxeter local historian and co-administrator of the Uttoxeter Facebook page Memories of Uttoxeter\n\nand surrounding villages, who spotted Colonel Herring’s tombstone while walking in St Mary’s Church graveyard. and posted the information he had found.\n\nIn the 1851 census Mary Herring’s widowed sister in law Eliza A Herring, 39, Gentlewoman,Annuitant, with her daughter Mary A Herring aged thirteen are shown living in the house withtwo female servants. On the census Mary Herring 64 is shown as living with her widowed brother in law William Philips, 63, at Springfields House, Stramshall, near Uttoxeter. Eliza Herring’s neighbour on the right in Samuel Botham’s old house, now Howitt Place, is Edward Alsop 36 surgeon and, in the house, next to him possibly Mayfield House is Thomas Fradgley 49 Architect & Builder with his wife Clara 41 and one servant.\n\nIn the 1861 census Eliza A Herring, 49, widow, born Perlang India is shown living in Thomas Gardner’s house with two servants. Her neighbour on the right in what appears to be Samuel Botham’s old house is Ann Shelton widow aged 57 a House Proprietor which could mean she was running a Boarding House?\n\nOn 1871 census Eliza Herring, 59, was not at the house in Balance Street and the house has just a cook and a housemaid in residence. I found her boarding in a house in Greengate Street Stafford. Her details show she has a pension from the East India Company.\n\nIn the 1881 census Eliza Herring, 69, is shown still living in Mr Gardner’s old house with a female companion, a cook and a housemaid. Living in the house nearly opposite, at what is now No 38 Balance Street, was Henry Bamford 62, founder of the famous Bamfords Agricultural Machinery Business and Uttoxeter’s main employer, with his wife Julia 58 and their adult children John, Julia, Frances, Charles, Joseph and Robert.\n\nIn 1891 census aged 79 Eliza Herring is still living there with a lady companion, a cook and a housemaid. Henry Bamford widower, now 73, was living at No 38 now called Enville House. Living with him were his adult children Julia, Robert and Frances. Henry was a widower his wife Julia having died in 1886.\n\nEliza Herring, widow of Colonel John Herring, died on May 29 1895 aged 83. She had lived in Thomas Gardner’s house for possibly 54 years or more. She as buried in Uttoxeter Cemetery.\n\nEliza Herring’s headstone in Uttoxeter Cemetery. Photo Neil Deaville.\n\nIn September 1895 Eliza Herrings house was sold to her late neighbour across the road Henry Bamford Snr., founder of Bamfords Agricultural Machinery Company.\n\nIt seems it was Henry Bamford who gave the name Leighton House to No 55 Balance Street probably naming it after his nearby factory the Leighton Iron Works. He only lived there for just over a year as he died there on October 27th 1896.\n\nPhoto Marion Bamford’s book A Staffordshire Family.\n\nIn the 1900 and 1904 Directories Henry Bamford’s daughter Miss Julia Bamford is registered living at Leighton House. Her brother, Thomas Bamford, was living across the road at her old home Enville House, No. 38 Balance Street. In September 1904 when Miss Bamford advertised the house for sale it was described as a commodious Freehold Family residence, known as Leighton House, Uttoxeter with the adjoining cottage occupied by Mr Charles Bond – this would be No 55. In October she advertised that she was selling the furniture at an auction on 10th and 11th October as she was giving up housekeeping. At an auction for the sale of the house on 30th November the highest bid was £1250 when the auction was stopped. Miss Julia Bamford went to live with her married sister Mrs Lynch in Walsall. She died there in August 1938 and was buried in Uttoxeter.\n\nIt looks as if Leighton House was not sold on the open market but sold within the family and renamed The Old House by the new owners. A report in the Burton Chronicle of Thursday 16 August 1906 stated that the newly married Henry Bernard and Mrs H B Bamford took up residence at the Old House, Balance Street.\n\nWhen the couple arrived back at Uttoxeter Station on the London train they were met by there by the groom’s parents Mr and Mrs Samuel Bamford of Hawthornden Manor who had arrived in their horse and carriage to take them to their new home. A huge crowd people from the town and workers from Bamfords’ factory had arrived to greet them. The horses were unhitched from the carriage they were due to travel home in, and many willing hands pulled the carriage with the couple and Mr and Mrs S. B. Bamford, up Bridge Street, through the Market Place, along Carter Street and into Balance Street to the Old House.\n\nIn the 1911 census Henry Bamford 34 agricultural engineer is listed living at The Old House, Balance Street with wife Madeline 25, daughter Madeline 3 and son Henry 7 months alongwith a cook, a housemaid and a nurse. At some stage Henry called his house Leighton House. Marion Bamford in her book A Staffordshire Family reveals a rather disturbing side to Henry’s father Samuel Bamford.\n\n“Although Samuel was regarded as an upright and good citizen, of some importance in the town, he showed a very different character to his family. At times he was over-bearing and dictatorial, and could be diabolically cruel, such as the time he smashed his son Henry’s photographic plates, of which he had a fine collection being a keen photographer. He also expected Henry on his marriage – (when he moved into the house in Balance Street)\n\n– to keep an establishment far beyond their means, being anything but well paid by Bamfords at that time. Henry’s wife Maddelena told me they often sent the bacon and eggs back to the kitchen so the staff could have a good breakfast, and that she refused invitations as she could not afford new gowns, and Samuel would have been the first to remark if she wore the same dress too often. Samuel told her to bring her pony and trap to Uttoxeter on her marriage, promising to stable and feed it, which he did not do.\n\nMany other petty tyrannies were perpetrated by the seemingly genial man. It was only due to Henry and Maddelena’s extreme frugality, and Henry’s later position in the firm after his father’s death, that he was able to restore the fortunes of his family and educate his children, and in his later life live in a comfortable style that should have been his from the beginning of his married life. He eventually became Chairman and Managing Director of the firm”.\n\nSometime after 1912 Henry Bernard Bamford and his family moved from Leighton House to The Highwood on the road to Marchington. Henry died in 1955. He and his wife Maddelena are buried together at The Hockley Cemetery.\n\nVarious trade directories over the years give the occupants of Leighton House.\n\n1912 Henry Bernard Bamford The Old House Kelly’s Directory.\n\n1914 The Girls’ Friendly Society held a garden fete in the grounds of Leighton House by the\n\nkind permission of Mrs J C De Ville.

John Herring was born in 1789 a couple of years before his father’s death. He grew up to follow a military career with the East India Company in the subcontinent. He joined the 37th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, a regiment of the East India Company’s Bengal Army, which had only become a separate regiment in 1824, and was later to become one of the regiments which took part in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at Benares in 1857.\n\nHe married Eliza Ann Loveday (1813–1895) who had been born in Perlang, in what is now Indonesia. They were married on 12 February 1834 in Nusseerabad, Bengal, India. They went on to have three children Mary Augusta Herring 06 Aug 1837, Agra, Bengal, India, Priscilla Elizabeth Herring 04 Mar 1839, India and John William Herring 04 Mar 1839, India. He grew up to follow a military career with the East India Company in the subcontinent. He joined the 37th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, a regiment of the East India Company’s Bengal Army, which had only become a separate regiment in 1824, and was later to become one of the regiments which took part in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at Benares in 1857.\n\nIn the book ‘Recollections of the first Campaign West of the Indus and of the subsequent operations of the Candahar Force’ by Major General Sir W. Nott G.C.B., it describes the incident of Herring’s death in 1839 “Soon after the arrival of the troop at Cabul Lt Colonel Herring, of the 37th Regiment Bengal Native infantry, was cruelly murdered near Hyder Khail, whilst marching from Candahar with a detachment towards headquarters. He and several officers in his regiment had strolled in the evening a short distance from camp, when they were suddenly attacked by a body of armed men.\n\nThe junior offices effected their escape, but Colonel Herring was surrounded; and though he, defended himself resolutely with a walking stick for some time, his assailants at length succeeded in cutting him almost to pieces before succour could reach him. He was interred in the Armenian burial ground at Cabul. He had been with the regiment thirty-four years. There is a memorial to him in the churchyard of St Mary’s Parish Church, Uttoxeter.\n\nIn the 1851 census Eliza A Herring 39 Gentlewoman Annuitant born in India widow of John Herring is living there with her daughter Mary A Herring aged thirteen also born in India. Two female servants also live in the house. Her neighbour in Samuel Botham’s old house is Edward Alsop, 36, surgeon and in the house next to him before the Shrewsbury & Talbot pub is Thomas Fradgley, 49, Architect & Builder with his wife Clara, 41, and one servant. This could be the house known as Mayfield House.\n\nOn the 1861 census Eliza A Herring widow 49 born Perlang India is living there with two servants. Her neighbour in what appears to be Samuel Botham’s old house is Ann Shelton widow aged 57 a House Proprietor. Does this mean that she was running a form of Guest House?\n\nOn 1871 census Eliza Herring was not at home and the house is occupied by a cook and a housemaid. I tracked Eliza Jane Herring, widow 59, to a house in Greengate Street Stafford where she was boarding. Her details say she has a pension from the East India Company. What confirms that we have the right property is the neighbour Mary Clewley annuitant aged 50 and single. What is interesting is that the property next to or adjoining Leighton House is entered as a Day School and unoccupied.\n\nIn the 1881 census Eliza Herring 69 is living there with a female companion, a cook and a housemaid.\n\nIn the 1891 census Liza Herring 79 is living there with a lady companion, a cook and a housemaid. Mary Clewley 76 is still her neighbour.\n\nEliza Herring died on May 29 1895 aged 83.\n\nI have yet to find the property or its occupiers in the 1901 census.\n\n1900 Miss Bamford Leighton House,\n\nIn the 1911 census Henry Bamford 34 agricultural engineer is living at The Old House, Balance Street with wife Madeline 25, daughter Madeline 3 and son Henry 7 months along with a cook, a housemaid and a nurse. At some stage Henry or one of his family renamed the house as Leighton House presumably after the Bamford Leighton Works behind the property.\n\n1912 Henry B Bamford The Old House (Kelly’s), 1936 Thomas Bagshaw Veterinary Surgeon, Crossley De Ville (Kelly’s), 1940 Thomas Bagshaw, Crossley De Ville Jun., De Ville & Bagshaw Veterinary Surgeons,(Kelly’s).\n\n57 Balance Street, Howitt Place, Home of Mary Howitt, the Botham Family Home\n\nHowitt Place No. 57 Balance Street the childhood home of Mary Howitt, nee Botham\n\nHowitt Place Balance Street the Botham family home where Mary Howitt grew up. Photo courtesy John German Estate agents Uttoxeter. The houses on the right were built on the site of Mayfield House which was once owned by Samuel Botham.\n\nThe Bothams’ House\n\nMary Howitt, nee Botham’s great niece Amice Lee, in her book Laurels and Rosemary The Life of William and Mary Howitt Oxford University Press 1955 relates that Mary Howitt’s childhood home had been built by her paternal great grandfather John Shipley during the reign of Queen Anne between 1702-10. His daughter Rebecca had first married a man named Summerland with whom she had two sons. Sometime after his death she met and married John Botham a fellow Quaker on December 31st 1755 at the Friends’ Meeting House in Carter Street. Their first son was born in 1756. Samuel Botham, Mary’s father, was born in 1758 in the house in Balance Street which belonged to his mother Rebecca. Her husband John Botham, Mary’s grandfather, was a herbalist and an expert in making vegetable drugs and salves and was also a preacher at the Friends’ Meeting House nearby in Carter Street.\n\nRebecca’s sons from her first marriage the Shipleys were not very happy at losing their inheritance when their mother remarried and the fall out between the Shipleys, the Summerlands and the Bothams was to continue for many years. Unfortunately Rebecca’s husband John Botham was not very good at managing the family finances or investments and unwisely she had left it to him to manage the family finances. On his mother’s death Samuel inherited the family home but had to let it out with other of the family properties in order to pay for the mortgages his father had unwisely accrued.\n\nSamuel Botham married Ann Wood in 1796 in South Wales and they lived at the L-shaped house in Balance Street Samuel’s mother had left him. They had to share the house with Samuel’s father John who had the parlour and the bedroom above at the front of the house facing the street which had its own staircase. It was in the downstairs front room that he mixed his herbs, made up his renowned snuff and stored his medicines. Ann Botham’s health was badly affected by the herb particles in the air and the pungent smells from her father-in-law’s working place but he did not seem to care. The Bothams’ first child Anna was born here in 1797. In 1798 the family set off for Coleford, Gloucestershire where Samuel was to start a new venture as a partner in an ironworks. It turned out to be a disaster. It was a most inopportune time for a baby to be born but their second child Mary was born there on March 12th 1799.\n\nThe family returned to the house in Balance Street about a year later and it was here that Mary and her sister Anna grew up along with their later siblings Emma born 1806 and Charles born 1808. Mary lived here with her beloved older sister Anna between 1802 and 1821 with brief periods away at Friends’ schools in Croydon and Sheffield. It was while living here that Mary and Anna listened spellbound to the fairy stories, ghost stories and Uttoxeter anecdotes and gossip told to them by their maid Nanny Wooding. One wonders if Nanny was the inspiration for much of Mary’s future writings. Many of Nanny’s anecdotes appear in My Own Story The Autobiography of a Child published by Mary in 1845. It was from their home in Balance Street that they went to Mary Parker’s ladies’ private school in the house next door which was also owned by their father. Much later it was called Mayfield House. They joined in the lessons taught by Mrs Mary Parker but sitting at the back as their father a strict Quaker did not want them to mix with the other girls. Although the Mary and Anna were told by their father to leave the class during religious instruction the girls sometimes stayed on and listened. In this way they learned The Lord’s Prayer and the Ten Commandments for the first time. Mrs Parker made a great impression on the two girls and on their parents too. Mrs Parker also acted briefly as a governess to the girls after school and took them on walks into the countryside during which she gave them lessons in botany until she left in 1809 to be with her daughter. It was from her parents’ house in Balance Street that in 1821 Mary Botham left to marry William Howitt from Derbyshire in the little Friends’ Meeting House in Carter Street. Just a few years later in December 1823 Samuel Botham died at his home.\n\nJoy Dunicliff in her book on Mary Howitt The Traveller on the Hill-top wrote that soon after Samuel died his wife Ann moved next door to the smaller property which her late husband had bought and rented out her house and other properties that had belonged to her husband. The smaller house next door was probably Mayfield House. It seems that her husband had been misled into bad investments by local solicitor James Blair and as a result lost his savings.\n\nHouses in Uttoxeter did not have numbers in those days and very few had names so it is difficult to pinpoint their location. Mrs Dunicliff wrote that Mr Kennedy a surgeon was the first person to rent the house in 1824. He had moved from a property known as Mount Pleasant on Stone Road which was later renamed The Mount. It looks like he later moved from Howitt Place to Stafford where he died about 1831.\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 11 December 1824\n\nImage reproduced by kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive\n\nIn the 1841 census George Alsop, 65, surgeon is shown living there with his wife Susanna, 55, and children Mary Ann, 25, Susanna, 20, and Edward, 20. They also have a male and female servant living in.\n\nIn 1845 Ann Botham moved to live with her daughter and son in law Mary and William Howitt at The Grange, Upper Clapton, London and died there in May 1848 aged 85.\n\nIn the 1851 census Edward Alsop, 36, surgeon and general practitioner is living there with a female servant and a groom.\n\nIn the 1861 census it looks like Ann Shetton, 57, widow born Snelston, Derbyshire living there and giving her occupation as House Proprietor. Does this mean she was taking boarders I wonder? She has one female servant living in.\n\nIn the 1871 census it looks like the house was occupied by Ann Stretton, 66, annuitant a widow born in Doveridge. Her niece Elizabeth Deaville, 13, and a servant are living with her.\n\nDerby Mercury – Wednesday 31 March 1875\n\nImage reproduced by kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nIt is difficult to be certain about which house is the Bothams’ old house in the 1881 census. I have used the pub the Shrewsbury Arms on the corner of Balance Street and The Hockley as my starting point and worked down Balance Street from there but in the 1881 census I found an extra occupied property between the pub and Mrs Herring’s house 53-55 Balance Street. It could be that Mrs Herring was letting out the property at the side of her house.\n\nIn the 1881 census it looks as if Bothams’ house was occupied by Henry Hawthorn 74 surgeon and his wife Susan 74. Their daughters Frances 33 and Mary 24 live with them as well as a female servant and a groom.\n\nIn the 1891 census it looks like Susanna Hawthorn 80 widow living on her own means with her nieces Anne Hawthorn 49 and Frances Hawthorn 38 and a female domestic servant.\n\nIn the 1911 census Mr T H Fletcher 53 Physician and surgeon is shown as living at Howitt Place with his wife Florence. They have been married for 24 years. Also living with them as a boarder is Louisa Botham 69 a widow of independent means and also a cook and a housemaid living in.\n\nDerby Daily Telegraph – Saturday 03 January 1914\n\nImage reproduced with kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 07 March 1914\n\nhttps://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000252/19140307/358/0012\n\nKelly’s Directory of 1916 lists George Robert Hankinson 57 Balance Street.\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser – Saturday 02 November 1918\n\nhttps://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000252/19181102/116/0005\n\n1921 Kelly’s Directory George Robert Hankinson 57 Balance Street.\n\nDerbyshire Advertiser and Journal – Friday 25 July 1924\n\nImage reproduced by kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nDr Coventry followed by Dr Fox\n\n1936, 1940 Charles James Coventry Physician & Surgeon, (Kelly’s), Miss Hawthorn 1900, 1896 (Kelly’s),\n\nDove Bank\n\nThe Hall, Alleyne’s High School, Dove Bank.

On the 1839 Tithe Map of Uttoxeter there is a field where St Mary’s Mount is today.\n\nIn the 1891 census Henry Bamford 41 Agricultural Instrument Manufacturer was recorded living at St Mary’s Mount with his wife Mary, nee Sandy, 45 and four young daughters. He is recorded ten years earlier in the 1881 census Henry Bamford 31 Iron Founder/Iron Monger living on The Heath with his wife Mary and a young son and daughter. No name is given to the house but it is possibly the same house. Henry also known as Henry Bamford Junior was the second son of Henry Bamford founder of Bamfords travelled for the company and later took on the purchasing and advertising. In 1901 he and his family moved to Park House, Stafford from where he would commute daily by train to Uttoxeter.\n\nIn 1898 St Mary’s Mount was advertised to let. It was occupied by Henry Bamford and contained a billiard room, large music saloon, three reception rooms, eight large bedrooms with the usual domestic offices. There was a tennis lawn, good garden, orchard and paddock with newly erected stabling. Kelly’s Directories of 1900 and 1904 show that the house was occupied by a Frank Lawrence Ward.\n\nIn 1908 Joseph Bamford fourth son of Henry Bamford returned to Uttoxeter from Lichfield to join the Board of Directors at Bamfords Ltd. where he took up residence at St Mary’s Mount. He had lived in Lichfield since 1883 where he set up the Lichfield Agricultural Company. In the 1911 census Joseph Bamford 49 Agricultural Engineer was recorded living at St Mary’s Mount with his wife Ellen, nee Emery and sons Cyril 26, Gerald 22 Agricultural Engineers and daughter Winifred 20 all born Lichfield. Joseph would live there until his death in 1936. In 1914 Joseph Bamford purchased The Parks for £2775. His son Cyril Joseph married to Dolores Turner lived there and in 1916 their son Joseph or Joe was born there. Joe who like his father and grandfather worked as an engineer for Bamfords would go on to create his own business with the world famous JCB digger the initials being those of his name Joseph Cyril Bamford.\n\nAt one time the Bamford families owned quite a number of properties in Uttoxeter. In 1916 when Joseph Bamford was living at St Mary’s Mount his son Cyril Bamford was living at The Parks, his other son Gerald Bamford was living at Moorlands, his brother Charles Bamford was living at The Nook, Balance Street, his brother John Bamford was living at Oldfield Hall, his brother Robert Bamford was living at Weaver Lodge, his brother Samuel Brassington Bamford was living at Hawthornden Manor which he had built and named after his first wife Dorothy Hawthorn, and his brother Thomas Bamford a doctor was living at Enville House, Balance Street. In 1917 Charles Bamford who previously had lived at The Nook purchased The Hermitage across the road from St Mary’s Mount for £1210. By 1921 Joseph’s son Gerald had moved from Moorlands to Eversley a house not far away on Stone Road.\n\nJoseph Bamford 1860-1936 of St Mary’s Mount was the inventive genius of Bamfords Uttoxeter Ltd. and had taken out hundreds of patents in connection with the firm’s products. He was one of the pioneer patentees of the self-registering cash register. He was of a quiet and retiring disposition, but most thoughtful and kindly, and generous to a degree for charitable objects and needy cases. He had seen the Uttoxeter firm grow from a small beginning to a huge concern with a works covering twenty-eight acres and employing 700 hands. He was Chairman of the Managers of St Joseph’s Catholic School, Uttoxeter. He was appointed Justice of Peace for Staffordshire in November 1920 and was a generous supporter of St Mary’s Catholic Church, Uttoxeter and of all social and sporting activities. He was fond of the gun and had the reputation of being a good shot. He died aged 75 in a nursing home in Newcastle U Lyme on December 21 1936 after a short illness. Mrs Bamford died aged 80 at St Mary’s Mount on October 25 1940.\n\nIn April 1941 a Children’s Wartime Nursery Centre was opened at St Mary’s Mount for the reception of children under five from “blitzed London”. It was established through the generosity of Mr S H Elkes M.B.E. who had many alterations made to the premises and bore most of the administrative costs. It closed in August 1945 and during its time it had been the home of 73 children.\n\nSt Mary’s Mount was advertised for sale in September 1945 and in September 1946 was purchased by the Staffordshire Red Cross for use as an Old People’s Home. It was formally opened by the Countess of Harrowby in July 1947 having been purchased for £8000 including alterations carried out to make it suitable as a Home. There was accommodation for 19 residents including one or two couples. The residents had to pay £2.5s per week had bed-sitting rooms which they furnished themselves and there were communal dining and sitting rooms and a sun parlour. Miss K M Bullock, a well-known Staffordshire Red Cross worker who was Commandant of Sandon Hall Auxiliary Hospital during the war was the first warden of the Home.\n\nStaffordshire Advertiser Saturday 01 March 1947\n\nMrs Bamford 1940, Joseph Bamford 1921, 1912 (Kelly’s), Lawrence Ward Frank 1900 (Kelly’s), Henry Bamford (Jun) 1896 (Kelly’s)\n\nWeaver Lodge, previously Newfields House Weaver Lodge Photo Maurice Birks\n\nI believe that Weaver Lodge was once known as Newfields House and apart from Robert Bamford some well-know Uxonians lived here. 1896 Newfields Heath Frederick G Johnson (Kelly’s) 1912, 1921 Weaver Lodge Robert Bamford (Kelly’s), 1900 Henry Norris House not mentioned, 1940 Frank F F Hawthorn (Kelly’s)\n\nThe Limes, Cheadle Road The Limes Cheadle Road Photo Maurice Birks\n\n1940 Mrs Foxwell (Kelly’s)\n\nThe Parks, New Road The Parks Photo Maurice Birks\n\nCyril Bamford 1940,1921, Mrs Need 1900, 1896 (Kelly’s)\n\nOldfields Hall, Stone Road was Oldfield Hall Oldfields Hall Stone Road Uttoxeter was Oldfield Hall McCann postcard.\n\nCapt.

By trade he was a carpenter and his forbears had been carpenters and farmers in Leicestershire for at least a century. In 1763-4 he was still a journeyman joiner aged 26 working on the Derby Assembly Rooms under Joseph Pickford at 2s. a day. After the work on the Assembly Rooms was finished Pickford took him on as an assistant and Thomas Gardner worked for him at Etruria Hall and the Etruscan Works for Josiah Wedgwood and at Sandon Hall 1770-1771 for Lord Archibald Hamilton which later became the home of Lord Harrowby. Thomas Gardner stayed with Pickford for nearly ten years. In 1772 after the death of his father he had sufficient capital to set up in partnership with Thomas Freeman a builder of Derby. The partnership was dissolved in March 1776 and for the remainder of his life Gardner carried on an independent business as an architect and builder at Uttoxeter. Thomas Gardner designed several country houses in the vicinity in a plain Georgian style. After Joseph Pickford’s death in 1782 aged 42 Gardner took on many of his old workmen and appears to have known and employed Pickford’s subcontractors and suppliers including sculptor George Moneypenny who made and designed monuments and memorials. Thomas Gardner died on 8 October 1804 aged 67 and is commemorated by a tablet in the parish church of St Mary erected by his wife Mary. She died while on a visit to London in September 1806 and was buried alongside her husband at St Mary’s Parish Church Uttoxeter. They had one known son William George Maxwell who had a tablet erected in the church in his mother’s memory. Thomas Gardner’s wife had been a widow when he married her so William could have been Thomas’ stepson. The memorials to Thomas Gardner and his wife Mary in St Mary’s Parish Church have been attributed to George Moneypenny.\n\nThomas Gardner’s House 53-55 Balance Street Uttoxeter which he designed.\n\nInformation from an article by Edward Saunders in Derbyshire Life August 1972 and from his book Joseph Pickford of Derby, A Georgian Architect published in 1993.\n\nIn A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840 published in 1978 Howard Colvin gives the following information on the works of Thomas Gardner.

In 1789 he returned to live in his house in Balance Street which I believe is the house now known as Leighton House 53-55 Balance Street. In 1832 an advertisement for the sale of the house notes that it was built by Thomas Gardner for his own use. His name has been misspelt by Redfern as Garner and Gardiner. As far as I know he was not related to the Gardners of Uttoxeter House which has been called Manor House since the late 1800s after the Ladies’ School Manor House School which occupied it.\n\nForgotten Uttoxeter Authors\n\nGeorge Wakefield 1821-1889\n\nRedfern in his History of Uttoxeter published in 1865 gives George Wakefield a one line entry as the author of Pictures of the Lowly. He also mentions two lithograph views of Uttoxeter Church and Alton Towers though it is not clear if Mr Wakefield is the engraver of these. The book gets a brief promotion in an advert in the Derbyshire Advertiser and Journal of Friday 11 February 1859 with the sub-title Sketches of Character published by Norris and Son, Uttoxeter. “This is the production of a working man living at Bromshall near Uttoxeter, and is very creditable to the writer. The contents seem to be the result of personal experience or observation, and if every “journeyman shoemaker” for such the author declares himself to be on the first page, turned his leisure time to so good an account, he would not be the less efficient as an operative, and, the probability is, far abetter as a citizen, and more useful as a member of society.”\n\nGeorge born in Uttoxeter in 1821 was the son of George Wakefield, a joiner, and his wife Margaret. He had it seems a twin sister Hannah. In the 1841 census he is an apprentice shoemaker 21 living with his parents in Carter Street. In 1844 when he married Sarah Ann Kidd at Marchington he gave his occupation as cordwainer – a shoemaker. In 1851 aged 30 he and his wife are living with their four children, two girls and a set of twin boys in Balance Street where he is still a shoemaker. In the 1861 census aged 39 he is stationmaster at Bramshall and there are now five children. In 1871 aged 49 he is station master at Froghall Station.\n\nThis forgotten Uttoxeter author was rediscovered in 1930 as can be seen in the following letter in the Notes & Queries column in the Derbyshire Advertister of August 22nd 1930. Charles Wigfull, a regular contributor to Notes & Queries, thought that George Wakefield had been a schoolmaster but he was in fact a stationmaster as was pointed out in a follow-up letter by J G Statham.\n\nDerbyshire Advertiser and Journal – Friday 10 October 1930. By kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nBy kind permission of The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk)\n\nGeorge Wakefield died on 7th March 1889 at Blythe Bridge after a short illness. His wife had died a few years earlier after a long and painful illness. The funeral took place at Forsbrook Church. An obituary appeared in the Staffordshire Sentinel on Saturday 09 March 1889.\n\n“If the life a man has lived and the work he has done, in aid of Christianity, humanity, and temperance is any criterion as to the interest taken in his past life, we have no doubt that short sketch of the work the late Mr Wakefield has done in the surrounding districts of Blyth Marsh and Forsbrook will be interesting to many readers. Mr Wakefield was born in Uttoxeter in 1823, and in his youth went to Stafford with his parents, where he learnt the trade of shoemaking. At a young man, he took an active part in the Chartist movement of 1842, while living in Stafford, and he has been connected more or less with every measure of reform since that time. At the age of twenty-seven or twenty-eight he was porter and ticket collector at Uttoxeter and afterwards stationmaster at Bromshall and Sudbury. While at the latter place he wrote short sketches, the titles of which are Pictures of the Lowly, Lizzy Bell, Sketches of Character, Are the results the same?, A country wakes, a book of Miscellaneous Poems &c. These were all sketches from life characters. and were considered of local interest and possessing considerable merit. He was also stationmaster at Froghall, at which place he was mainly instrumental in raising a Primitive Methodist chapel at Kingsley Holt, whence he came to Blyth Bridge in 1872, where he commenced a most energetic and meritorious work amongst the lowly and poor, being a Wesleyan and a total abstainer of twenty-five years’ standing at that time. He was one of the principal promoters of the movement which resulted in the building of the Wesleyan Chapel at Blyth Bridge. About his first work was to inaugurate a Band of Hope, while persistently seeking out drunkenness wherever he could, and exhorting the people to take the pledge. To enable him to do this work he rented a school as a kind of mission-house, where he provided entertainments, and gave lectures twice a week. He also collected money for the last twelve years for the distribution of coal to some seventy poor people during the severest weather, and it is said that since he came to the district of Blyth Bridge he has collected upwards of £1000 for charitable purposes. His solicitude for the poor and needy was unbounded. He would turn out at any hour of the day or night and enter a house striken with with fever with a courage possessed by few men, to aid in prayer or to administer the necessaries of a closing life. that he will be a missed man in the district all who knew his goodness will admit.” One of pall-bearers was Mr Mellor, stationmaster of Uttoxeter along with Mr Ellerton stationmaster at Blyth Bridge. How wonderful it would be to find copies the works of of this once renowned Uttoxeter poet and author.\n\nIn the 1900 and 1904 Directories Henry Bamford’s daughter Miss Julia Bamford is registered living at Leighton House. Her brother, Thomas Bamford, was living across the road at her old home Enville House, No. 38 Balance Street. In September 1904 when Miss Bamford advertised the house for sale it was described as a commodious Freehold Family residence, known as Leighton House, Uttoxeter with the adjoining cottage occupied by Mr Charles Bond – this would be No 55. In October she advertised that she was selling the furniture at an auction on 10th and 11th October as she was giving up housekeeping. At an auction for the sale of the house on 30th November the highest bid was £1250 when the auction was stopped. Miss Julia Bamford went to live with her married sister Mrs Lynch in Walsall. She died there in August 1938 and was buried in Uttoxeter.\n\nIt looks as if Leighton House was not sold on the open market but sold within the family and renamed The Old House by the new owners. A report in the Burton Chronicle of Thursday 16 August 1906 stated that the newly married Henry Bernard and Mrs H B Bamford took up residence at the Old House, Balance Street.\n\nWhen the couple arrived back at Uttoxeter Station on the London train they were met by there by the groom’s parents Mr and Mrs Samuel Bamford of Hawthornden Manor who had arrived in their horse and carriage to take them to their new home. A huge crowd people from the town and workers from Bamfords’ factory had arrived to greet them. The horses were unhitched from the carriage they were due to travel home in, and many willing hands pulled the carriage with the couple and Mr and Mrs S. B. Bamford, up Bridge Street, through the Market Place, along Carter Street and into Balance Street to the Old House.\n\nIn the 1911 census Henry Bamford 34 agricultural engineer is listed living at The Old House, Balance Street with wife Madeline 25, daughter Madeline 3 and son Henry 7 months alongwith a cook, a housemaid and a nurse. At some stage Henry called his house Leighton House. Marion Bamford in her book A Staffordshire Family reveals a rather disturbing side to Henry’s father Samuel Bamford.\n\n“Although Samuel was regarded as an upright and good citizen, of some importance in the town, he showed a very different character to his family. At times he was over-bearing and dictatorial, and could be diabolically cruel, such as the time he smashed his son Henry’s photographic plates, of which he had a fine collection being a keen photographer. He also expected Henry on his marriage – (when he moved into the house in Balance Street)\n\n– to keep an establishment far beyond their means, being anything but well paid by Bamfords at that time. Henry’s wife Maddelena told me they often sent the bacon and eggs back to the kitchen so the staff could have a good breakfast, and that she refused invitations as she could not afford new gowns, and Samuel would have been the first to remark if she wore the same dress too often. Samuel told her to bring her pony and trap to Uttoxeter on her marriage, promising to stable and feed it, which he did not do.\n\nMany other petty tyrannies were perpetrated by the seemingly genial man. It was only due to Henry and Maddelena’s extreme frugality, and Henry’s later position in the firm after his father’s death, that he was able to restore the fortunes of his family and educate his children, and in his later life live in a comfortable style that should have been his from the beginning of his married life. He eventually became Chairman and Managing Director of the firm”.\n\nSometime after 1912 Henry Bernard Bamford and his family moved from Leighton House to The Highwood on the road to Marchington. Henry died in 1955. He and his wife Maddelena are buried together at The Hockley Cemetery.\n\nVarious trade directories over the years give the occupants of Leighton House.\n\n1912 Henry Bernard Bamford The Old House Kelly’s Directory.\n\n1914 The Girls’ Friendly Society held a garden fete in the grounds of Leighton House by the\n\nkind permission of Mrs J C De Ville.

John Herring was born in 1789 a couple of years before his father’s death. He grew up to follow a military career with the East India Company in the subcontinent. He joined the 37th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, a regiment of the East India Company’s Bengal Army, which had only become a separate regiment in 1824, and was later to become one of the regiments which took part in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at Benares in 1857.\n\nHe married Eliza Ann Loveday (1813–1895) who had been born in Perlang, in what is now Indonesia. They were married on 12 February 1834 in Nusseerabad, Bengal, India. They went on to have three children Mary Augusta Herring 06 Aug 1837, Agra, Bengal, India, Priscilla Elizabeth Herring 04 Mar 1839, India and John William Herring 04 Mar 1839, India.
