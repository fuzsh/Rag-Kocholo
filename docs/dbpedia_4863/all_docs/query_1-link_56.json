        "text": "Dorothy Sorensen passed away on July 17, 2014, at the age of 88 after a long illness. She grew up in Springfield, graduating from Central (Senior) High School in 1943. Dorothy met her beloved husband, Lyle, at O’Reilly Hospital, where he was stationed in the US Army. They were married January 16, 1944. Married for 30 years, Lyle preceded her in death on August 19, 1974.\n\nDorothy’s family was the most important thing in her life, and her home was her “castle”. She was a great confidante and listener. As her family grew and evolved they loved sharing the happenings in their lives. Always ready to hear the latest stories about her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she would listen with rapt attention to every detail. She loved the opportunity to share stories with interested others, and had a fun sense of humor.\n\nMost of Dorothy’s life journey was full and active, and she appreciated her many dear friends. She was a long time member of Central Christian Church. During her working years, she was a friendly “voice” to many, serving as a switchboard operator at Sweetheart Cup, St. Johns Hospital and Great Southern Bank. Dorothy enjoyed singing with the Sweet Adelines for a while, and many will remember her love of dancing. Another of her greatest joys was following the St. Louis Cardinals baseball games. She tuned in to most all of the telecasts.\n\nDorothy is survived by her daughters and sons in law, Sally and Lynn Rowe; Susie and Harry Appleby; loving grandchildren Brent Appleby and wife Jenny; Angie Coulter; Scott Cook and wife, Jennifer; and Stacy Viehage and husband, Tony; six great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter. Dorothy also leaves behind her sister, Betty Doran, her brother, Larry Miller, brother-in-law, Bob Sorensen, three nieces and three nephews.\n\nOne of Dorothy’s greatest attributes was her generosity and compassion for others. So it follows that she felt most grateful for the compassionate care she received during her illness from the nurses and staff at both Integrity Hospice and Ameripride organizations. Daughters, Sally and Susie, always felt a great deal of comfort knowing their mother was attended to by such competent and kind professionals. They would like to extend their deep appreciation to them at this time. Much gratitude to her special friends who cared for her in her most challenging days, Debbie Peterson, Patty Hendry, Lucretia Long, Jennifer McCullough and Harry Beckett.\n\nVisitation will be held at Greenlawn Funeral Home South on Friday, July 18, 2014 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. A private graveside service will be on Saturday, July 19, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. in Maple Park cemetery in Springfield. In lieu of flowers, donations are requested to be made to: The Child Advocacy Center, Inc. 1033 E. Walnut St., Springfield, MO or to: Christ Church Unity, 2214 E. Seminole, Springfield, MO."
