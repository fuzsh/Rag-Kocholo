Abstract

‘An Evening Without Cary Grant’, commemorating the anniversary of Cary Grant’s death with Douglas J Miller who was there when he died, 29 Nov.

On 29 November 1986, Cary Grant died in Davenport Iowa on tour with his A Conversation With Cary Grant show. Join Cary Comes Home Festival director Charlotte Crofts for an informal chat with J Douglas Miller, to mark Cary Grant’s death anniversary and how our plans to take the festival to Iowa have been delayed by the global pandemic.

According to Scott Eyman (2020), ‘Cary Grant typed out his wishes for his funeral in capital letters: “LIKE GROUCHO MARX I AM ADAMANT ABOUT NOT WANTING EITHER FLOWERS OR EULOGIES WHEN I’M GONE”‘

So, we don’t get too sentimental, but we do light a candle and have a moment to pay our respects to the “best and most important actor in the history of Cinema” (David Thomson).
