1970 Lifetime Achievement Archibald Alec Leach (January 18 1904 &ndash; November 29 1986), better known by his stage name, Cary Grant, was a British-born American actor. With his distinctive Mid-Atlantic accent, he was noted as perhaps the foremost exemplar of the debonair leading man, handsome, virile, charismatic and charming. He was named the second Greatest Male Star of All Time of American cinema, after Humphrey Bogart, by the American Film Institute. He was well known for starring in classic films such as "The Philadelphia Story", "North by Northwest", "Notorious", "His Girl Friday", "To Catch A Thief", "Bringing Up Baby" and "The Bishop's Wife".

Early life and career

Archibald Alec Leach was born in Horfield, Bristol, England in 1904 to Elsie Kingdom and Elias Leach. [cite web | url = http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=987018 | title = Elsie Kingdom | accessdate = 2008-07-12] [cite news | url = http://www.carygrant.net/articles/epitome.htm | title = Movies' Epitome of Elegance Dies of a Stroke | author = Eric Pace | work = New York Times | date = 1 December 1986 | accessdate = 2008-07-12] An only child, he had a confused and unhappy childhood, attending Bishop Road Primary School. His father placed his mother in a mental institution when he was ten and his mother never overcame her depression after the death of a previous child. His father had told him that she had gone away on a "long holiday" and it was not until he was in his thirties that Leach discovered her still alive, living in an institutionalized care facility.

He was expelled from the Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol in 1918. He subsequently joined the "Bob Pender stage troupe" and travelled with the group to the United States as a stilt walker in 1920, on a two-year tour of the country. When the troupe returned to England, he decided to stay in the US and continue his stage career.

Still under his birth name, he performed on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri, in such shows as "Irene" (1931); "Music in May" (1931); "Nina Rosa" (1931); "Rio Rita" (1931); "Street Singer" (1931); "The Three Musketeers" (1931); and "Wonderful Night" (1931).

Hollywood stardom

After some success in light Broadway comedies, he went to Hollywood in 1931, where he acquired the name Cary Lockwood. He chose the name Lockwood after the surname of his character in a recent play called "Nikki". He signed with Paramount Pictures, but while studio bosses were impressed with him, they were less than impressed with his adopted stage name. They decided that the name Cary was OK, but Lockwood had to go due to a similarity with another actor's name. It was after browsing through a list of the studio's preferred surnames, that Cary Grant was born. Grant chose the name because the initials C and G had already proved lucky for Clark Gable and Gary Cooper, two of Hollywood's then-biggest movie stars.

Having already appeared as leading man opposite Marlene Dietrich in "Blonde Venus", his stardom was given a further boost by Mae West when she chose him for her leading man in two of her most successful films, "She Done Him Wrong" and "I'm No Angel" (both 1933). [Encyclopedia Britannica, Cary Grant biography ] "I'm No Angel" was a tremendous financial success and, along with "She Done Him Wrong", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, saved Paramount from bankruptcy. Paramount put Grant in a series of indifferent films until 1936, when he signed with Columbia Pictures. His first major comedy hit was when he loaned to Hal Roach's studio for the 1937 Topper (which was distributed by MGM).Grant starred in some of the classic screwball comedies, including "Bringing Up Baby" with Katharine Hepburn, "His Girl Friday" with Rosalind Russell, "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Priscilla Lane, and "Monkey Business" with Ginger Rogers. His role in "The Awful Truth" with Irene Dunne was the pivotal film in the establishment of Grant's screen persona. These performances solidified his appeal, and "The Philadelphia Story", with Hepburn and James Stewart, showcased his best-known screen persona: the charming if sometimes unreliable man, formerly married to an intelligent and strong-willed woman who first divorced him, then realized that he was&mdash;with all his faults&mdash;irresistible.

Grant was one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for several decades. He was a versatile actor, who did demanding physical comedy in movies like "Gunga Din" with the skills he had learned on the stage. Howard Hawks said that Grant was "so far the best that there isn't anybody to be compared to him".
