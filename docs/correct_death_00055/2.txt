Cary Grant was a legendary actor. A household name from the late 1930s until, for many, this very day. The star of classic films like North by Northwest, Arsenic and Old Lace, His Girl Friday, and oodles more. Never disgraced, never "canceled", Grant was able to act in dramas, comedies, and musicals without questions or concerns about his acting chops. So, what was Grant doing in Davenport, Iowa on the day he died back on November 29, 1986? Preparing to act, of course.

Cary Grant was set to appear in a questions and answers show

In the mid-80s, the Bristol, England born Grant began touring the U.S. hosting a one-man questions and answers show. Dubbed A Conversation with Cary Grant, Grant was set to do his Q&A at the famous Adler Theater in Davenport. Accoridng to the book Cary Grant In Name Only he appeared to be sick when he arrived to the theater in the afternoon.

Grant was eventually taken back to his hotel where he'd been staying with his wife. A doctor was called and it was quickly determined Grant was suffering a stroke. He refused to go to the hospital, and as a result he slipped into a coma. He was then transported to St. Lukeâ€™s Hospital where he eventually died at age 82. His body was returned to California and he never had a funeral, which was at his own request.

Certainly not a happy piece of Iowa history, it still stands as one unique piece of Hawkeye State history. A legendary actor know worldwide sadly suffered a stroke and passed away while on tour in Iowa. Sad, yes. But Carry Grant worked at his craft quite litterally 'til the day he died.
