        "text": "From Bette Davis jokingly calling the place a dump, to Dave Chappelle seriously eviscerating a couple of hecklers, Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall has attracted a rich and varied roster of stars since opening with a production of “Fiddler on the Roof” on Jan. 5, 1970.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the city-owned venue on Sarasota Bay — named after local philanthropists Lewis and Eugenia Van Wezel — here’s our look at the 50 biggest stars to play Van Wezel.\n\nWe’ve chosen luminaries from the worlds of opera, jazz, pop, theater, stand-up comedy, film and television, with their appearances taking place from 1971 to last year.\n\nBeverly Sills\n\nMarch 22, 1971\n\nThe famed opera singer impressed Sarasota as much with her singing prowess as her star power at this show, and again when she returned during her last tour in 1980. After telling Van Wezel executive director Curtis Haug she hated purple before her Sarasota debut, she signed his guestbook: “I’m tickled purple to be here.”\n\nDuke Ellington\n\nMarch 8, 1974\n\nThe jazz master canceled his January 1974 date at the Van Wezel due to lung surgery, but returned in March with a full, two-hour concert concluding with him at the piano playing “Lotus Blossom.” Later that month he gave his final public performance. Ellington died on May 24, 1974, at age 75. Ellington’s last words were reportedly, “Music is how I live, why I live and how I will be remembered.”\n\nBette Davis\n\nMarch 24, 1974\n\nAfter attendees were shown about a dozen clips spanning her film career, Davis, cigarette in hand, looked at the audience and said, “What a dump” — a fun callback to the famed line she utters in the 1949 film “Beyond the Forest.” She followed her opening remark with entertaining anecdotes about working with Hollywood greats like James Cagney and Spencer Tracy.\n\nDizzy Gillespie\n\nNovember 22, 1975\n\nAcclaimed across the globe as one of the greatest jazz artists of all time, Gillespie perplexed at least one Van Wezel audience member, according to a published account, at this show that trumpeter, bandleader and composer gave at age 58. Gillespie, who died in 1993, returned to a half-empty Van Wezel a few years later.\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nNovember 25, 1975\n\nTouring in support of her acclaimed live album “Ella in London,” Fitzgerald did her singing and scatting in front of a sold-out hall during a program called “A Legend in Her Own Time.” The Tommy Flanagan Trio featuring trumpeter Roy Eldridge accompanied her.\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\nMay 27, 1976\n\nMaestro Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic received a standing ovation despite a flawed opening performance of George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” which featured Bernstein as the soloist conducting from the piano. In the guestbook, Bernstein wrote, “To Curt Haug, with thanks for the great acoustics, which exposed so cruelly my misplayed notes, every good wish.”\n\nJimmy Buffett\n\nFebruary 17, 1977\n\nLess than a month after releasing his breakthrough 1977 album “Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes,” featuring the hit single “Margaritaville,\" Buffett became one of the first rock/pop acts to play the Van Wezel. “A standing-room crowd of 1,780 last Thursday heard one of the best Jimmy Buffett concerts ever given,” wrote Bob Ross in the St. Petersburg Times. “It was a historic first for the purple palace, where rock ’n’ roll is usually not welcome because of the rowdiness of pop fans.”\n\nRay Charles\n\nNovember 8, 1977\n\nLess than a week before hosting “Saturday Night Live,” Brother Ray arrived here for a show that almost did not happen. The Van Wezel provided his manager with a City of Sarasota check instead of the cashier’s check called for in the contract. Charles, one of the most important figures in American popular culture thanks to his role in pioneering soul music, did not leave his private jet at the Sarasota airport until he got the specified form of payment.\n\nLiberace\n\nFebruary 7, 1978\n\nSix complete outfit changes, the Herald-Tribune reported, describing the first of several Van Wezel performances by the glam pianist. “Everything matched and glittered — even his shoes,” read the review. “Perhaps the most dazzling garment he wore was a full-length black diamond mink cape, completely lined with cut rhinestones.”\n\nSteve Martin\n\nFebruary 15, 1978\n\nOn his way to superstardom, Martin played Van Wezel the same year he won a Grammy for his debut comedy album “Let’s Get Small.” Before the show, Martin told the Herald-Tribune he was working on a couple films. He became a Hollywood star the next year with the release of “The Jerk.” Martin played Van Wezel again in 2017 on his joint tour with Martin Short, which returns Jan. 23.\n\nBob Newhart\n\nFebruary 3, 1979\n\nDecades before a new generation met him through the film “Elf,” and just months after the final episode of “The Bob Newhart Show” aired, the everyman entertainer performed his lauded stand-up act. “It was a night of comedy which left the Venice Hospital fundraisers smiling,” read a review in the old Sarasota Journal.\n\nBob Hope\n\nMarch 15, 1980\n\nFollowing a cameo the previous summer in the blockbuster “The Muppet Movie,” the 76-year-old Hope delivered an uninterrupted hour and a half of stand-up comedy gold, prompting the Herald-Tribune to write, “The only problem with his show was that the audience roared with laughter from the punch line of one joke as Hope was beginning the next story.”\n\nB.B. King\n\nOctober 25, 1980\n\nThe same year King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, he made his first of several memorable Van Wezel visits. The highly influential guitarist, singer and songwriter would go on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in ’87 and then in ’88 King had a rock/pop hit with “When Love Comes to Town,” a collaboration with U2 that introduced the King of the Blues to the MTV Generation.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti\n\nDec. 15, 1980\n\nThe Italian opera singer was already considered the greatest tenor of his generation when he made his third appearance here before an overflow crowd that included seating right on stage. An estimated 4,000 fans were unable to purchase tickets.\n\nCary Grant\n\nNov. 27, 1983\n\nThe leading man in classic films such as “His Girl Friday,” “Notorious” and “North by Northwest” unveiled one of the earliest performances of “An Evening with Cary Grant” on Sarasota’s stage. It featured film clips and an audience Q&A. The success of the show led to dates in about 30 cities. Grant died in 1986 at age 82 of a stroke while in Davenport, Iowa, for a performance.\n\nWynton Marsalis\n\nJan. 24, 1985\n\nThe trumpeter made his Van Wezel debut at age 23 in between Grammy wins for best solo jazz performance and best classical soloist. Alas, “many older people hustled for the exits while Marsalis introduced his ensemble members,” noted our glowing review of his performance. The ensemble included his sax-playing sibling and future “Tonight Show” bandleader Branford Marsalis.\n\nLucille Ball\n\nNov. 21-22, 1985\n\nThe “I Love Lucy” star came to Sarasota the same month that “Stone Pillow,” a dramatic TV movie starring Ball as an elderly homeless woman, aired. During the Q&A part of her second appearance, an audience member stood up and introduced herself as a childhood friend. Ball, clearly moved, invited the woman backstage.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers\n\nMarch 3, 1986\n\nTrailblazing TV personalities Tommy and Dick Smothers brought their comedy act of sibling rivalry here for two sold-out shows and returned numerous times. Dick eventually became a Sarasota resident, and the duo recently reunited for their first publicized show together in nearly a decade at McCurdy’s Comedy Theatre.\n\nSammy Davis Jr.\n\nApril 25, 1986\n\nOne of the greatest entertainers to grace any stage, Davis filled the hall twice in one evening with a performance that found him in fine voice. He sang everything from “Mr. Bojangles” to “The Lady is a Tramp.” He also did impersonations of Jerry Lewis, Humphrey Bogart and others while delivering engaging monologues.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nNov. 4, 1986\n\nCash enjoyed a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1980s thanks to his work with supergroup The Highwaymen, which found him singing with Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings (who played Van Wezel in 1994) on several albums starting in ’85. In the summer before visiting Van Wezel, Cash had just released the album “Heroes” with Jennings, Cash’s highest charting release before teaming with super producer Rick Rubin in the 1990s.\n\nCarol Burnett\n\nJan. 9, 1987\n\nIn her Van Wezel debut, Burnett had been nearly a decade removed from her hit TV variety show and had recently starred in the miniseries “Fresno.” She’s returned to the venue over the decades, including a visit last year shortly after the Golden Globes named a television achievement award after her.\n\nHerbie Hancock\n\nJan. 12, 1989\n\nThe pianist and composer first made history as part of Miles Davis’ quintet in the 1960s, helped pioneer jazz fusion as a bandleader in the 1970s and even scored an international pop smash in 1983 with the single “Rockit.” But his music wasn’t a big hit in Sarasota. He led his trio in front of a hall that was less than half-full in ’89, the same year he did the music for the Eddie Murphy comedy “Harlem Nights.”\n\nGeorge Burns\n\nNov. 30, 1991\n\nThe comedian, Oscar-winning actor and best-selling writer was closing in on his 97th birthday when he played our purple palace. “I never get tired of performing because the audience loves it,” he told the Herald-Tribune. Burns would continue to entertain until shortly before his death in 1996 at the age of 100.\n\nSmokey Robinson\n\nMay 22, 1992\n\nThe Motown singing and songwriting maven came here not too long after receiving several major honors, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Robinson has returned several times since, each time filling the hall.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nNov. 9, 1992\n\nThe hottest ticket of ’92, Dylan made his Van Wezel debut after releasing “Good As I Been to You” and participating in his all-star “30th Anniversary Concert Celebration” at Madison Square Garden. For his Sarasota show, local resident Dickey Betts, on a break from touring with the Allman Brothers Band, played lead guitar on “Cat’s in the Well,” a rocker from Dylan’s ’90s album “Under the Red Sky.” Dylan finally came back to the Van Wezel in 2018 for a triumphant sold-out show that included a stirring new arrangement of his classic “Like a Rolling Stone.”\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nFeb. 28, 1994\n\nJust a couple of years removed from an IRS debacle, Nelson performed in support of his hit album “Across the Borderline,” which featured songs written by co-producer Paul Simon, John Hiatt, Peter Gabriel, Dylan, Lyle Lovett and Nelson. Fellow country outlaw Billy Joe Shaver opened the show. Nelson most recently returned to the venue for an impressive, sold-out show in 2017.\n\nTony Bennett\n\nFeb. 19, 1995\n\nBennett has been selling out the Van Wezel since the 1970s, but what makes this show extra special is that it occurred about a week before the singer won an Album of the Year Grammy for his “MTV Unplugged” record. “When everyone was putting MTV down, I saw something there I liked,” Bennett said. He’s remained relevant ever since, working with modern pop stars like Lady Gaga and visiting Van Wezel just last month.\n\nGregory Peck\n\nMarch 15, 1996\n\nAt age 79, the star of such classics as “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Roman Holiday” and “The Omen” discussed his remarkable career and shared clips from his favorite movies. The Hollywood legend told the Herald-Tribune that he began doing his “Conversation with Gregory Peck” appearances at the suggestion of Cary Grant.\n\nGregg Allman\n\nDec. 26, 1996\n\nWhile Gregg Allman lived in Manatee County during the 1980s and ’90s, he had moved to San Francisco by the time of this show, which took place about a year after the Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Allman, who would continue to play memorable Sarasota shows at various venues through the decades, died at age 69 in 2017.\n\nLittle Richard\n\nOct. 18, 1997\n\nOne of the architects of rock ’n’ roll, the piano-pounding singer with an equally potent fashion sense launched the 1997-98 season on a soaring high note. “From the moment he leaped on top of his piano, tossed his hair and declared, ‘The beauty is on duty!’ Little Richard had a packed Van Wezel audience in the palm of his hand,” reads a Herald-Tribune review.\n\nDon Rickles\n\nFeb. 5, 2004\n\nBefore the beloved insult comic packed the hall, he gave a great interview to the Herald-Tribune. “If anybody ever asked me to tone it down, I just wouldn’t be working for them,” he said. “I throw my best punch, and that’s Don Rickles. That’s what got me to the dance, and I’m not about to change.” Rickles passed away in 2017 at age 90.\n\nLiza Minnelli\n\nJan. 17-18, 2006\n\nThe daughter of Hollywood royalty became her own star with charming roles in the now-classic films “Cabaret” and “Arthur,” the trendsetting TV special “Liza with a Z” and on stages like this one. “My mother always told me to be a first-rate version of myself, not a second-rate version of anybody else,” she told the crowd at this Van Wezel Foundation gala.\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nDec. 8, 2006\n\nThe groundbreaking comedian made the last of several packed performances following his HBO special “Life is Worth Losing,” in which he mentioned his newfound sobriety and riffed on topics such as suicide, genocide and humans’ inferiority to other animals. “My first purple hall,” he wrote in the guestbook during his first Van Wezel date decades earlier — pretty clean for Carlin. He passed away in 2008 at 71 years old.\n\nStephen King\n\nNov. 16, 2009\n\nWhen the author from Maine who has written such classics as “The Stand,” “It” and “The Shining” took the stage with the Herald-Tribune’s Susan Rife for a sold-out talk, it marked his first major local appearance since buying a winter home on Casey Key in 2001. “We liked Sarasota because it was funky,” King told Rife.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nOct. 16, 2011\n\nHow popular is Parton? With tickets priced between $110 and $200, she easily sold out the place. Her show included self-penned classics like “Jolene,” “9 to 5” and “I Will Always Love You,” plus an interesting selection of covers including Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven.”\n\nAudra McDonald\n\nNov. 6, 2011\n\nThe actress and singer already had four Tony Awards when she performed what she described as songs by “a mix of new, young composers and really established and well-known composers.” Today, she has six Tonys — more than any other performer — as well as two Grammys and an Emmy.\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nFeb. 25, 2012\n\nDuring two sold-out shows, the comedian kept the crowd cracking up with his witty brand of observational humor. After a standing ovation, he came out to answer a few questions from the audience and ended the evening with his trademark “Hello ... Newman” from his TV show. Seinfeld has continued to visit Van Wezel, most recently in 2018.\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nMarch 30, 2013\n\nThe Van Wezel finally hosted its first hip-hop act, but Queen Latifah didn’t actually do any of the rapping that made her a Grammy-winning star in the 1990s. Ever since her Oscar-nominated performance in “Chicago,” Latifah has largely eschewed spitting rhymes for singing blues, pop and standards, which is what she delivered here.\n\nDiana Ross\n\nSept. 11, 2013\n\nSarasota’s then-Vice Mayor Willie Shaw presented the original pop diva with a key to the city along with City Manager Tom Barwin and wife Margaret Bailey after Ross’ sold-out performance. Ross has been a Van Wezel regular in recent years, thrilling full houses with Supremes and solo hits that span half a century.\n\nMerle Haggard\n\nJan. 29, 2014\n\nHaggard could have run through his No. 1 country hits and made the sold-out crowd very happy. Instead, he chose songs that meant something to him over his 50 years of recording; offering touching renditions of the originals “Footlights” and “Thirty Again,” a pair of meditations on aging. Hag also paid tribute to his heroes with superb covers of songs by Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills and Johnny Cash, as well as choice material by Blaze Foley and Townes Van Zandt before closing the show with a fun, tongue-in-cheek version of his anti-hippie anthem “Okie from Muskogee.” Haggard died in 2016 at the age of 79.\n\nJay Leno\n\nFeb. 7, 2014\n\nThe night after his final show as host of “The Tonight Show,” Leno visited Van Wezel in his first performance there since 1988. “When you do ‘The Tonight Show,’ you do different jokes in the same place every night,” Leno told the Herald-Tribune. “On the road, you get to do the same jokes in different places every night.” Leno has continued to play Van Wezel since, most recently last year.\n\nJoan Rivers\n\nMarch 15, 2014\n\n“Truthfully, and no jokes, I love what I do and I care about my audience,” Rivers said during a fun phone interview with the Herald-Tribune before her Sarasota performance. ”They’re paying (expletive) good money to get a good show and I’m going to work to make them have a good time.“ Sure enough, the rules-busting comic elated an eclectic crowd. Alas, this show would prove to be one of her last. Rivers died Sept. 4, 2014 at age 81 following a vocal-cord procedure.\n\nJohn Legend\n\nApr. 27, 2014\n\nOne of the biggest contemporary stars to play Van Wezel, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist visited the venue just before his single “All of Me” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Legend has since won an Emmy, Oscar and Tony — making him one of only 15 “EGOT” winners — and was just recently named People’s Sexiest Man Alive.\n\nRingo Starr\n\nFeb. 24, 2015\n\nStarr embarked on a solo career within months of our purple palace opening, lending a touch of serendipity to the Beatle making his premiere during the Van Wezel’s 45th anniversary celebration. The youthful sounding and looking then-74-year-old drummer, singer and songwriter entertained with relaxed charm in front of a packed house, with solo hits and songs he originally sang with The Beatles.\n\nBrian Wilson\n\nSep. 11, 2016\n\nThe Beach Boys mastermind visited Van Wezel during a 50th anniversary tour performing 1966’s “Pet Sounds,” widely considered one of the greatest records ever made. Two years later, he played another full-album show there, performing “The Beach Boys’ Christmas Album.” Both times, he was joined by a band including fellow founding Beach Boys member Al Jardine.\n\nDave Chappelle\n\nFeb. 11, 2017\n\nDave Chappelle’s Sarasota debut at Van Wezel, one of two almost instantly sold-out performances at the venue on the same evening, found the comedian in top form, even when dealing with hecklers. It’s a long story covered in our review, but it definitely made for a memorable evening, especially when Chappelle uttered his famed Rick James catchphrase from his hit series “Chappelle’s Show” that he had retired years earlier.\n\nIdina Menzel\n\nMay 27, 2017\n\nThe voice of Elsa in Disney’s “Frozen” films and a Broadway star for her roles in “Rent” and her Tony-winning turn as Elphaba in “Wicked,” Menzel made her Van Wezel debut in 2017. During the nearly two-hour concert, Menzel sang several tracks off her then-newest album “idina.,” as well as favorites from “Wicked,” “Rent” and “Frozen.”\n\nBarry Manilow\n\nFeb. 16, 2018\n\nThe pop singer behind such enormous hits as “Mandy” and “Copacabana” performed a dazzling Van Wezel Foundation gala concert, complete with glow sticks handed out to the audience. Though Manilow is comfortable headlining arenas, he told the Herald-Tribune he prefers venues like Van Wezel, saying, “I like the smaller ones better. What I do is more intimate.”\n\nWhoopi Goldberg\n\nApr. 27, 2019\n\nOne of the 15 esteemed “EGOT” winners and current co-host on daytime talk show favorite “The View,” Whoopi Goldberg took to Van Wezel’s stage for a stand-up show. The tour was called “Back from the Dead with a Smile” after a month-long battle in the hospital with double pneumonia and sepsis that endangered Goldberg’s life.\n\nJulie Andrews\n\nNov. 14, 2019\n\nThe iconic stage and screen star known for her roles in “Mary Poppins,” “The Sound of Music” and “My Fair Lady” visited Van Wezel for “An Evening of Conversation with Julie Andrews.” Andrews showed a video montage and shared stories from her decades-long career, territory she also covered in her new book “Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years.”"
