Alexander, 60, of Culbertson avenue, publicity director of the Ohio Good Roads Federation, former publisher of the Zanesville Signal and postmaster of this city, under the administration of President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nDeath was very unexpected and was due to a heart attack caused, it was said, by over-exertion in delivering an address before a meeting of the Zanesville Presbytery in Mt. Vernon Presbyterian Church. The address was very forceful and as Mr. Alexander concluded, he turned to sit down amid the plaudits of the congregation when he suddenly toppled to the floor.\n\nIn the confusion incident to the attack, several minutes elapsed before a physician could be summoned. Restoratives were administered as quickly as possible but without success.\n\nThe body was taken to the Presbyterian manse across the street from the church and later, the Mader funeral home was notified to have the body brought to the family home on Culbertson avenue, pending funeral arrangements.\n\nRev.

Alexander purchased the Zanesville Signal which they published in partnership for several years, after which the brother sold his local interest to James R. and purchased the Columbus Dispatch and later sold his Columbus interests to purchase a newspaper at Trenton, N.J.\n\nMr. Alexander published the Signal until in 1918 when it was combined with the Times Recorder by the Zanesville Publishing company.\n\nAppointed Postmaster-In 1912, James R. Alexander was appointed postmaster of Zanesville by President Woodrow Wilson and served in that capacity until 1920 when President Harding defeated James Cox and the office changed to a Republican appointment.\n\nRetired from the postoffice, Mr. Alexander chafed under inactivity and re-entered the newspaper field as publisher of the McKeesport Journal but he did not remain long in that position and disposed of his interests to become publicity manager of the Ohio Good Roads Federation with offices in Columbus.\n\nHe was always prominently identified with Democratic politics in Zanesville and Muskingham county and served many times on the Democratic Central committee. He also had been a candidate for Congress to represent the Fifteenth District of Ohio.\n\nWhile connected with the Good Roads Federation, he was a strong advocate of improvement of county and township roads with gravel and worked untiringly to the end that all roads be improved to make better communication through rural communities.\n\nActive In Church-He also took active interest in the affairs of the Central Presbyterian church here, and besides his church membership, he was interested in the Brotherhood and the Mens Bible Class.\n\nFraternally he was a member of the Masonic Lodge of Amity No.5, this city. He was a charter member of the Rotary Club and a few years ago\n\nHe was voted into honorary membership in the organization.\n\nIn 1897 he was united in marriage to Miss Nellie Hunter of Columbus, a former resident of Woodsfield, and to this union three children were born, two of whom survive. They are, Mrs. Elizabeth R. Leslie and James Jr., at home. Three sisters; Misses Clara and Mary Alexander of Philadelphia and Mrs. George B.

Adamson from the Plainview Church of Christ.\n\nTouching each of these who have gone to the far away home of the soul I believe we can justly say, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.\n\nMay the dark shadow of death that has fallen so heavily upon this once united happy home serve to urge and keep us all nearer the cross than we ever before have lived. May the Lamb that is in the midst of the threne guide us into fountains of living waters of life; where God shall wipe away every tear from our eyes.\n\nCard of Thanks-Not in a formal way but in a sincere and most earnest grateful way do we desire to express the deep gratitude that we feel in our hearts to all the kind neighbors and friends for every thoughtful ministry rendered during the sickness and death of our precious loved ones.

Death is the conqueror. It is no respecter of people. It takes the young and the old.\n\nIt enters the palaces of the rich and the hovels of the poor. There is no table around which there is not an empty chair. What a comfort for us to know there is a place where there is no death. A place where no crepe hangs from the door; where no farewells shall ever be spoken; where no partings are ever said and where no funeral cars ever rumble over the golden streets. Toward that land of endless day and eternal life the people of God are all journeying.\n\nDeath is everywhere and it shall come to every living thing. We all do fade as a leaf. We suffer pain. The body is racked, the mind clouded and the spirit troubled.\n\nHeaven is a land of health. There is no disease in the air, no germ in the water.\n\nForrest M. Berry, son of Thomas and Lena Berry was born July 7, 1882; passed thru the portal which men call death(but Jesus calls sleep) early Saturday morning at the Martins Ferry hospital, having had an early pilgrimage of 47 years, 2 months and 28 days.\n\nHe was united in marriage to Sadie Davis February 20, 1907 and to this union were born two sons, Lee and Robert.

Creighton, of Beallsville, and Bertha A. Berry at home. He also leaves a host of relatives and friends who will sadly miss him.\n\nEarly in life he confessed his faith in Christ and was baptized by Brother Will Harkins, and at the time of his death was a faithful member of the New Castle Church of Christ.\n\nAnother soldier of the cross has fallen. The ranks have again been broken. He has been promoted from the church militant to the church triumphant. Sadie has lost a devoted husband and will be lonely a she travels the rest of the journey alone. The boys have lost a loving father and will miss his words of counsel and advice. Father and Mother, sisters and brothers, Sadie and the boys, have our deepest sympathy in their sad bereavement. May the Lord sustain and keep you for He doeth all things well. Listen Tis the voice of your God, I love thee, I love thee, pass under the rod.\n\nFuneral from the Presbyterian church at Jerusalem on Monday afternoon in charge of Brother Fred Dennis of the Church of Christ.

He had been an invalid for a nmber [number] of years but his death was unexpected and came as a great shock to the family and friends. Besides the parents several brothers and sisters survive.\n\nFuneral services were conducted on Wednesday morning by Rev. Joseph Finan in St. Josephs Church, Burkhart, and burial was made in the church cemetery at that place.\n\nBishop, Martha Bishop\n\nBishop, Miranda Bishop\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, January 9, 1929\n\nOne Sister Dies While Funeral Services Are Held For Other\n\nShortly after funeral services started Sunday at the Methodist Church at Somerton for Martha Bishop of near there, word came that her sister Miranda had just passed away and the services were postponed for a double funeral on Monday afternoon.\n\nBorn within two years of each other, they died within two days of each other in the home where they were born and had always lived. Side by side they lay during their fatal illness and side by side they were buried Monday afternoon in the same grave at Somerton Cemetery.\n\nMartha, who was 83, died Friday afternoon at 4 0clock and Miranda, aged 81, passed away at 2 p.m. A song had been sung and a prayer made by the pastor at Marthas funeral when word was sent to the church that the other sister had passed away.\n\nJust a few minutes before the younger sister had looked for the last time on the face of her older sister and whispered God Bless Her as the body was taken away for the funeral at the church.\n\nPneumonia caused the death of both. During most of their illness they were alone in their lonely log home situated on the ridge between Somerton and Boston. Neighbors offered help, but they were told that this was not needed and the seriousness of the aged sisters condition was not realized until the door was pried open Friday afternoon.\n\nThe critical condition of the older sister was quickly apparent and a physician was summoned. Before he could reach the home the older sister had died. A short time before this, she had fallen on the floor of the home, where she remained all night, the younger sister, ill at the time, being unable to do more than throw a cover over her. Neighbors found her the next morning and placed her in bed.\n\nThe incident occurred on one of the coldest nights of the winter and undoubtedly hastened the death of the older sister.\n\nFor many years the two sisters lived alone, supporting themselves by stringing tobacco. Both were members of the Harmony Methodist Church and they were greatly interested in things religious. They were devoted readers of the Bible and were able to quote much of the Scriptures.\n\nRev. Ray Smith, the Methodist pastor at Somerton, conducted the interrupted services Sunday, but he was taken suddenly ill and was unable to conduct the double funeral service Monday. This was in charge of Rev. H.H.\n\nAdamson of Woodsfield.\n\nThe sisters have no near relatives and some of the distant relatives live in Barnesville. Barnesville Enterprise of Jan. 1st.\n\nBlair, Mr. David Blair\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, March 13, 1929\n\nThe passing of a friend and neighbor, such as Mr. Blair calls for more than a casual mention, as he had lived more than his allotted time, reared five respectable children, all settled in successful life, then quietly and peacefully died in the full assurance of the Masters welcome to come up higher for duties well done. But physical weakness denies me the privilege of more than a brief eulogy such as his life merits.\n\nA modest unassuming nature was not generally recognizednot even by himself as a diamond in the roughnot brilliant but genuine as God made it untouched by mans tarnish of selfishness and greed. In earlier life he was a farmer, carpenter and stone mason, a most efficient workman in each occupation, being noted for his thoroughness in small jobs as well as large, always doing more and better than was expected of him. He never hunted jobs, they were always hunting him and for such he was invaluable. Tho of recent years, failing years, failing health prevented heavy work, but even when not able just for accommodation to friends, he would help out when the exertion must have been fraught with physical suffering. After the elder children were settled he moved to town with his only son Guy, our local architect, and the youngest daughter, Miss Marthaboth since married and with his wife prepared to enjoy declining years. The wife who was Isabelle McConnell, daughter of the Pioneer John McConnell died later, leaving him and Miss Martha to enjoy happiness together several years. The latter marrying, he was left alone in the home for several years. The son lived adjoining. Then he married Miss Carrie Bell, daughter of Dr. John Bell and sister to our townsman, Tom Bell, with whom he spent a few happy years, she dying two years since.\n\nHe was a reader and a thinker and kept in touch with current events. As a Bible student he frequently occupied the local pulpits nearby, Sunday School official, class leader of the M.E. Church and interested in every good work, but never ostentatious, always effacing self, that only those closest or benefited realized his true worth until hes gone from us.\n\nEmpty will be his place in home-coming, which he has filled since its organization by extending the keys with his genial welcome. Hail and farewell to one who made earth better for having lived in it.[submitters note- David died February 22, 1929]\n\nBlazer, Emma L.

McCOMAS\n\nE.L. LYNCH\n\nR.M. GRAHAM\n\nCommittee\n\nBuskirk, Dennis Buskirk\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, January 16, 1929\n\nDeath of Dennis Buskirk\n\nDennis Buskirk, former editor of the Spirit of Democracy, died at his home on West Marietta Street, Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 oclock after a few weeks serious illness from complications due to advanced age. He had been living retired for several years during most of which time his health had not been rugged.\n\nDuring this time he was tenderly cared for by his aged companion by whom he is survived.\n\nMrs. Buskirk came to Woodsfield in 1866 and became an apprentice in The Spirit of Democracy office. He was faithful, dependable and thorough and was eventually promoted to editorship of the paper, filling that position for nineteen years ending with his retirement about eight years ago.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Thursday afternoon at 1:00 oclock at the residence. Religious rites will be conducted by his pastor, Rev. John Fleming Cash. The I.O.O.F. Lodge will also conduct their ritualistic service both at the home and at the Pioneer Cemetery where interment will be made.\n\nBuskkirk, Dennis Buskirk, 2nd obit\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated January 23, 1929\n\nIn this paper last week, a brief mention was made of the death of Dennis Buskirk, its former editor and manager. In like simplicity, in compliance with his own desire and that of his aged companion, do we want to write simply and plainly of one who was born, served, achieved and died, the epitome of the life of man.\n\nTo men and women who are past middle age, present or former residents of Monroe County, what is written of Mr. Buskirk is of necessity largely reminiscent. To younger men and women of the younger generation his life is another chapter in biography of a man beginning life with little but a commendable ambition to serve, and make his own way in the world, and an indomitable will which held him to his purpose. Few, if any young people begin life today with less equipment or have so long a road to travel; and perhaps still fewer have a record of longer faithful service to so great a number of people. What he did and achieved ought to inspire any normal young man or woman of today to say, I can and I will.\n\nMr. Buskirk was born near Round Bottom on January 4, 1852, a son of Oliphant and Sarah Buskirk and was the last surviving member of his family. The late Dr. N.P. Buskirk of Round Bottom was a brother. On July 2, 1866, he walked into Woodsfield and asked for a job at The Spirit office, the paper being then owned by Jere Williams and Henry West. A search of the next two issues does not reveal that his advent was considered important enough to mention as it was thought that this shy, awkward country boy would not last long. And perhaps it is not to much to say that Abraham Lincoln on his first appearance in Springfield took no longer step into a wholly different life than did Dennis Buskirk in his fourteenth year when he came from Adams tp to Woodsfield. No such barriers exist today in our country. But often the potential qualities of mind and heart lie hidden and the new employee stuck to his case for three years as an apprentice learning the trade at little or no salary.\n\nOther employees came and went, editors came and went but he was a fixture and gradually was promoted from one responsibility to another.\n\nFor fifty-three and a half years he was with the paper, becoming its editor in 1907 when it was incorporated as The Spirit of Democracy Printing Co. On January 10, 1920, he was compelled by declining health to retire, and his resignation was reluctantly accepted by the company. Most of the past four years, at his home on West Marietta-st. he put up a brave fight for health against the toll of time, both he and his faithful wife looking continually toward the sunset of life, and leaning on each other and taking comfort in the consciousness of life of rectitude and service.\n\nIn November 1871, he was united in marriage to Miss Mattie Murphy, daughter of Benjamin and Mary Murphy. Their entire married life was spent in Woodsfield, their home always on the same lot where the present residence stands. One son, Willie, was born to them but he died at the age of 9 years in 1881.\n\nMr. Buskirks death occurred on Tuesday, January 15 at his home following a few days serious illness from complications incident to the advanced age of 77 years and 11 days. Funeral services were held at the home on Thursday in charge of his pastor Rev. John Fleming Cash, of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Both the religious services and those of the I.O.O.F. Lodge were characterized by simplicity and brevity. He had been a faithful member of both the church and Lodge for over forty years. Interment was made in the family lot in Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nMr. Buskirk had his limitations and weaknesses and none knew them better or regretted them more than he did. But he practiced principals of strict honesty and his word once given was good as a bond. He gave his life in service through his paper and its files contains thousands of kind comments on achievements and interests of Monroe County people. Thirty had been written for a man whose record in newspaper service is out-standing in the history of the state.\n\nAmong those from a distance in attendance at the funeral were: Mrs. Robert Tilton of Steubenville; Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mayer and Mrs. Hazel Thomas of Warwood.\n\nCard of Thanks-Most sincerely do I wish to thank our neighbors and friends for the many considerations and kindnesses shown us during the illness and at the time of death of my dear husband, Dennis Buskirk.Mrs. Mattie Buskirk\n\nCard of Thanks-We acknowledge with appreciation the many kindnesses and words of sympathy shown us by neighbors and friends during the illness and the death of our beloved wife and mother, Mrs. Martha L. Feisley. It is a comfort to know we have your sympathy in our great sorrow.

Mrs. Carpenter was 72 years of age and had been ill for a long time.\n\nBefore her marriage 56 years ago to David Carpenter, she was Ella Peeper and was born at Beallsville November 20, 1859. She was the mother of ten children of whom seven survive; Mrs. George Burchfield, with whom she has been making her home; Mrs. Charles Campbell, Mrs. Oswald Pierce, Mrs. Harold Smith, Frank and John Carpenter, all of Beallsville, and Mrs. E.R. Reed of New Waterford, Ohio. She is also survived by a number of grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nMrs. Carpenter was a member of the Main Street Methodist Church at Barnesville, and was highly respected and loved in her community. She had lived a busy, useful life.\n\nThe funeral services were held on Thursday at the Burchfield home at 2:00 oclock conducted by Rev. W.C. Patterson and Rev. J.R. Jones.\n\nBurial was made in Southern cemetery.\n\nCarpenter, Lawrence Carpenter\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, October 16, 1929\n\nLawrence, fourteen months old son of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Carpenter of Summerfield route 1, died Thursday evening following a brief illness from bronchitis.\n\nBesides the parents the following brother and sisters survive; Willis, Paul, Carl, Grace and Thelma of the home, and the grandparents, Mrs. Emily Carpenter of near the home and Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Stephen of Woodsfield route.\n\nFuneral services were conducted on Saturday morning by Rev. J.D. Kaho at the home and burial was made in the Calais cemetery.\n\nCashman, Ethel Cashman (nee-McGovern)\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, January 16, 1929\n\nMrs. Ethel McGovern Cashman, aged 42, died Wednesday morning of last week at her home in Columbus. Death was due to pneumonia, following influenza.\n\nFuneral services were held at St. James Catholic Church at McConnelsville last Friday.\n\nShe was a cousin of Mrs. Lucy Danford and Mrs. Rose McEntee of Woodsfield.\n\nChristman, Jacob J. Christman 2nd obit\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, April 10, 1929\n\nJacob J. Christman, prominent and well-to-do farmer, of near Lewisville died at his home Saturday, April 6. He was about 62 years of age, strong and capable physically, having had little or no illness in his entire life.\n\nSometime ago he contracted influenza, and apparently as is apt to be true of a person who has never been ill, he thought he could wear it out.\n\nInfluenza is apt to attack severely the intestinal tract, the lungs or the brain, and in Mr. Christmans case, it probably was the latter involving the brain centers.\n\nBesides his widow, he is survived by the following children; Mrs. Bertha Neuhart and Mrs. Ruby Mann of Lewisville; Mrs. Gilbert Ludwig of Woodsfield; Mrs. Edna Young of Lewisville; Elmer of Lewisville, Misses Zelda and Gladys of the home.\n\nFuneral services were held at Middle Church Tuesday morning in charge of Rev. Edward Brueske, of Lewisville and were largely attended.\n\nChristman, Jacob John Christman\n\nThe Spirit of Democracy Issue: Woodsfield, Ohio, Wed., April 24, 1929\n\nJohn Christman was born June 5, 1867, and departed from this life April 6, 1929, at the age of 61 years, 10 moths, and 1 day. He was at St. Peters Evangelical Church, Lewisville, Ohio, in early youth. Later his membership was transferred to St. Johns Evangelical Church of Summit township, where he was a member until death. He was the son of Jacob and Fredrica Pfalzgraf Christman.\n\nHe was united in marriage March 13, 1894, to Rachel Matz and to this union were born eight children: Mrs. Bertha Christman Neuhardt, Mrs. Edna Christman Young and Elmer Christman, of near Lewisville; Mrs. Oneida Christman Ludwig of Woodsfield; Mrs. Ruby Mann, Zelda and Gladys Christman of the home; one son preceded him in infancy.\n\nHe had been in failing health for several months but an attack of influenza caused complications which could not be overcome. Mr. Christman was a prosperous farmer, good neighbor, a devoted husband and father and not only will his loss be keenly felt in the home but in the entire community as well.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted Tuesday morning at St. Johns Evangelical Church of Summit township by his pastor, the Reverend Chester Guam in the presence of a large number of friends and relatives. The remains were laid to rest in the beautiful cemetery there. At the grave the services were conducted by the Barnhart Grange No. 1850 of which he had been a member for many years.\n\nMany beautiful floral offerings attested the sympathy of friends and relatives.\n\nHe leaves to mourn his departure besides his faithful wife and children, ten grandchildren, and ten brothers, and sisters as follows: Mrs. Barbara Jackson, Mrs. William Ackerman, Louis Christman, of Woodsfield; Mrs. George Weber, Mrs. Fred Weber, Mrs. Louis Heft, Misses Tillie and Louise Christman, George and David Christman all of the vicinity of Lewisville.\n\nGod moves in a way that is very mysterious to us and so often we cannot understand but if we only trust Him, His grace will ever be sufficient for us. The family has the heartfelt sympathy of the entire community and we pray that God may send his comforter to those who mourn. V. L. F.\n\nChristy, Luvina Christy\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, February 27, 1929\n\nLuvina Christy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Christy was born Sept. 7, 1928 and died February 17, 1929, being at the time of her death five months and ten days of age.\n\nHer last illness was of short duration. She contracted pneumonia and medical skill and tender care could prolong her life but a few hours.\n\nHer visit with us though short, was sweet and pleasant and the attachment so strong that we should so suddenly be called away. Our loss is Heavens gain and we are comforted by the words of our Saviour, Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not for such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nShe leaves to mourn her sad loss; father, mother, one sister, two brothers, two grandmothers, two grandfathers, one great-grandmother and a large number of relatives and friends. One brother died in infancy about two years ago.\n\nFuneral services were held at Hartshorn Ridge Church of Christ February 18, 1929 at 2:00 oclock with Elder Earl Ward in charge.\n\nChristy, Luvina Christy\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, April 17, 1929\n\nOne more little lamb has entered into the fold. In remembrance of our darling baby Luvina, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Christy, who was born September 7, 1928 and passed away February 17, 1929 being at the time of her death 5 months and 10 days of age.\n\nHer last illness was of short duration. She contracted pneumonia and everything that medical aid and loving hands could do was cheerfully done to relieve her suffering and prolong her life, but all in vain. At six oclock Sunday morning she was called to a bright and happier world where sorrow and pain never come.\n\nWhile here on earth she withstood much pain and discomfort but amidst it all she has given us such sweet smiles as are a joy and comfort. The last hours of her life were so hard for her to bear, but she was so patient, kind and gentle and her eyes yet dim seemed to search for hope. Her stay with us so short that it seemed impossible to give her up. But there is one consolation, that we know she is sleeping in peace and without pain and suffering and like a bud she will bloom and be with Jesus in that Beautiful Land where pain and sorrow are no more.\n\nShe leaves to mourn her sad loss, father, mother, one sister, Dorothy, Grandfather and Grandmother Smith, Grandfather and Grandmother Christy, Great grandmother Nan Hartshorn, and a large number of relatives and friends.\n\nFuneral services were conducted at the Hartshorn Church of Christ Feb.19th, at 2:00 oclock by Elder Earl Ward, where she was laid to rest beside her infant brother who died about two years ago.\n\n.\n\nWe have lost our darling baby\n\nShe has bid us all adieu,\n\nShe has gone to live in Heaven\n\nAnd her form is lost from view.\n\n.\n\nWe loved her, yes, we loved her,\n\nBut the angels loved her more;\n\nAnd they sweetly called her\n\nTo yonder shining shore.\n\n.\n\nThere is an angel Band in Heaven\n\nThat was not yet quite complete,\n\nSo, they sweetly called Luvina\n\nTo fill that vacant seat.\n\n.\n\nShe has gone and left her loved ones\n\nOur tears we cannot dry,\n\nBut some day we hope to meet her\n\nIn the Home beyond the skies.\n\nFather, Mother and Sister\n\nCard of Thanks-We desire to take this means of thanking our friends and neighbors for the help and tender care in the sickness, death and burial of our darling baby. Also the relatives for the beautiful flowers. Such kindness will never be forgotten.Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Christy\n\nClaus, Adolph H.

Claus, aged about 76 years, died at his home near Miltonsburg, Thursday evening, death being due to a complication of diseases following an attack of influenza.\n\nBesides his widow he is survived by four sons, and two daughters, Fred and John at home; Oscar and W.G. Claus, of Woodsfield R.3; Mrs. Charles Mann, of Miltonsburg; and Mrs. George Mann, of Jerusalem.\n\nFuneral services were held Sunday afternoon and were largely attended. Rev. Chester Gaum had charge of the services at the Evangelical Church at Miltonsburg, the church being to small to accommodate the large number of relatives, friends and neighbors present.\n\nAn obituary notice will be published later.\n\nClaus, Adolph Henry Claus\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, May 29, 1929\n\nAdolph Henry Claus, son of Henry and Elizabeth Claus, was born May 25, 1852 near Monroefield in Malaga-tp., Monroe county, Ohio, and departed this life on Thursday, May 2, 1929 at the age of 76 years, 11 months and 7 days.\n\nMr. Claus had not been in good health for the past four years and a few months ago he suffered an attack of influenza from which he did not fully recover, and in fact with a complication of ailments, he grew gradually weaker instead of regaining his customary good health.\n\nMr. Claus grew to manhood in the community in which he was born and in 1879 was united in marriage with Elizabeth Fleahman. To this happy and blessed union were born six children, four sons and two daughters as follows: Frederick and John of the home; William of Woodsfield R.3; Mrs. George (Katie) Mann, of Jerusalem; Mrs. Charles (Lucetta) Mann, of Miltonsburg; and Oscar, of Woodsfield R.3, all of whom survive him as do also his widow, two daughter-in-law, Mrs. William and Mrs. Oscar Claus of Woodsfield R.3, two sons-in-law, George Mann of Jerusalem, and Charles Mann of Miltonsburg; also two brothers, Justus Claus, of Lower Salem, Ohio; and Fred Claus of Monroefield. There are also eleven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nAll his life, Mr. Claus was in some way connected with the church. In his fourteenth year, he was confirmed into St. Peters Evangelical church at Miltonsburg and in 1879 was elected a member of the church and remained active even to his last days. Two weeks before his death he went to Miltonsburg to visit his daughter, Mrs. Mann and attend church, but found after reaching her home he was unable to proceed further.\n\nIn 1899 Mr. Claus was elected a trustee of the church and for twenty years he was president of the congregation. Since 1884 he was a continuous and interested reader of The Friedenshote the syndodical church-home magazine.\n\nFuneral services were held on Sunday afternoon at St. Peters Evangelical church of Miltonsburg in charge of his pastor, Rev. Chester Gaum and were largely attended. Seldom is a private citizen more highly honored by the presence of a wide acquaintance of neighbors to whom he was a true and steadfast friend. He was a good husband and father and not long ago, the family celebrated the fiftieth wedding anniversary of their father and mother.\n\n.\n\nI expect to pass thru this life but once\n\nIf therefore there is any kindness I can show,\n\nOr any good I can do to any fellow-being;\n\nLet me do it now, let me not defer it or neglect it\n\nFor I shall not pass this way again.\n\n.\n\nCard of Thanks-We wish to express our heartfelt thanks and sincere gratitude to the relatives and many friends for their expression of kindness, sympathy and help during the recent illness and death of our dearly beloved husband and father, Adolph Henry Claus.\n\nWe especially thank the pastor, the choir for their beautiful selections, the donors of the beautiful flowers and all who were kind to us in many ways.- Mrs. Elizabeth Claus and Family\n\nClaus, Elizabeth Claus nee Fliehman 2nd obit\n\nSpirit of Democracy, Woodsfield, Ohio, dated, August 21, 1929\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Claus (nee Fliehman) was born in Summit-tp., Monroe county, Ohio, of February 28, 1851 and died at her home near Miltonsburg on Wednesday, July 24, 1929 at the age of 78 years, 4 months and 26 days. She was the oldest daughter of Philip and Catherine Fliehman, former residents of Marr, Ohio.\n\nOn February 16, 1879 she was united in marriage to Mr. A.H.

They are; Fred and John, of the home; William and Oscar, of Woodsfield R.3; Mrs. George Mann , of Jerusalem and Mrs. Charles Mann, of Miltonsburg. There are also one brother and two sisters; H.H. Fliehman and Miss Catherine Fliehman, of Woodsfield; and Mrs. E.E. Morrison, of Sycamore Valley, Ohio; besides eleven grandchildren; five great-grandchildren, many other relatives and friends.\n\nIn her fourteenth year, Mrs. Claus was confirmed into the Evangelical faith at Harrietsville, Ohio. She remained a faithful member all through life. She willingly met all demands for service of her Master until illness prevented her active part in worship and church work.\n\nIn 1904 Mrs. Claus and several other members originated the Ladies Aid Society of St. Peters Evangelical Church of Miltonsburg, and as a charter member of that organization, she was active in its work until the serious illness of her husband whose death occurred just twelve weeks before her own.\n\nOnce more these two souls are united, this time never to part, never again to suffer the trials of earthy life, this time free from sorrow, sin, and strife. Their task on earth, it is complete, they lay their trophies at Jesuss feet. In a little while ye shall see me no more and yet in a little while ye shall see me.\n\nMrs. Claus was a kind and loving mother, a devoted wife and a true friend. The community mourns with the family the death of one of its oldest and truest members and friends. We commend all those into the loving care of Him who said, Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted.\n\nFuneral services were held at the church at Miltonsburg on July 27, at 2:00 oclock in charge of her pastor, Rev.

Perhaps in our present-day hurry and effort, nothing so often catches our attention and reminds us of the love and sacrifice of the Savior of us all as does the faithful service, sacrifice and love of a devoted mother, whether she be in a humble home or pretentious mansion.\n\nSometimes, the mother-heart goes out in love and service beyond her own fortunate household and comforts and serves those in sorrow in other homes in her community. Truly does she thereby prove that the more we give, the more we have, and fulfills the poets statement that To live in hearts we leave behind, is not to die.\n\nSuch a mother was Mrs. Margaret Claus, whose death occurred on Friday, November 8, 1929, after a few days illness, at her home on Woodsfield, Route 3, near Miltonsburg. On Tuesday she was stricken with an intestinal ailment which ran a quickly fatal course in spite of medical skill and the devoted ministrations of her that was humanly possible to save the life of her who would have gladly given her life for any one of them. She had lived beyond her allotted span of three score years and ten, and her wish that her last days be not spent in a long period of helpless suffering was fulfilled. The following obituary was read at the funeral service, held at Miltonsburg Evangelical Church on Sunday, November 10, where hundreds of her friends and neighbors gathered to pay a tribute of respect to her memory:\n\nMrs. Margaret Claus nee Miller, was born near Miltonsburg, on June 21, 1853, and died at her home on Friday, November 8, 1929, at the age of 76 years, 4 months, and 17 days. She was a daughter of John and Mary Miller and grew to womanhood in the Miltonsburg community. On January 26, 1875 she was united in marriage to Henry Claus who preceded her in death on May 20, 1906, twenty-three years ago.\n\nA family of six children were born to them, four of whom are living: Dora at home; Mrs. Gertrude Weber and Mrs. Anna Christman, of near Lewisville. A son died in infancy and a daughter Mrs. Matilda Feldner, died three years ago. Two sisters; Mrs. Mary Lohri, of Trail Run, Ohio; Mrs. Elizabeth Pfalzgraf, of Parkersburg, W.Va.; and one brother, John, in California, survive her. There are also 24 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren and two step-sisters, Mrs. Charles Chapman, of Beaver, Pa.; and Mrs. George Rich, of Bridgewater, Pa.\n\nMrs. Claus was confirmed in the Evangelical church at the age of fourteen years and was a faithful follower of Him who gave His life for others. Modestly capably, in season and out, gladly and unselfishly, she gave and ministered both from her heart and hand in service to neighbors and friends. In sickness and sorrow and even tragedy, she was the faithful neighbor who never failed those who depended upon her. In faithfulness to her Master in the way of church attendance she was an example to her family and friends.\n\nThe absence of flowers at this service was in accordance with her wish expressed many times and in line with her philosophy of life that while people are living is the best time to show and express our love for them, and that is what she did. Out of full hearts those whom she loved and served came to pay tribute to her memory. And if to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die, then truly does Grandma Claus live here and now and will live with her Lord and Master, Jesus Christ throughout all eternity.\n\nServices at the home in charge of her pastor, Rev. Chester Guam, were followed by final obsequies at the church. The pastor was assisted by Rev. Otto G. Meyer, of Woodsfield. Six stalwart grandsons were pallbearers. Interment was made in the family lot in Miltonsburg cemetery.\n\nAged friends of her childhood days won by her loyalty and charm of youth, young people of another generation held by the love of the great mother-heart, and children who instinctively love the good and pure in heart were all her friends. And but little less-than those who miss her loving, ministering, ever patient spirit of her presence in the home they regret the transition from earthy life to life eternal of one whom they will always remember most kindly and whose life will ever inspire a belief in truth, goodness and righteousness.\n\nAmong those attending from a distance who attended the funeral were: Mrs. Mary Lohri, Mr. and Mrs. John Lohri and daughter, Mrs. Lawrence Baker, Mr. and Mrs. William Ridgeway, of Trail Run; Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Lohri, Mr. and Mrs. Ed Peters, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ridgeway, of Wheeling; Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Pfalzgraf, Mrs. Claremont Pfalzgraf, Mr. and Mrs. John Lemmon, Parkersburg; Mr. and Mrs. John Riemenschneider, Mr. and Mrs. Holland Riemenschneider, Mr. and Mrs. Ed Riemenschneider and Ernest Riemenschneider of Barnesville; Lawrence Christman of Bucyrus; Mr. and Mrs. Robert Nowell of Niles, Ohio; Mr. and Mrs. Ed Lohri and daughter Edra of Sistersville; Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Lohri of Marietta.\n\nCard of ThanksWe desire to express publicly our appreciation of the many kindnesses of friends and neighbors and of the service of ministers and choir at the time of death and funeral of our dear mother, Margaret Claus.
