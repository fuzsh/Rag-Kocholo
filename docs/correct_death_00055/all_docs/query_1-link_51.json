        "text": "Happy Birthday, Cary Grant\n\nAlthough his speech and demeanor suggested something quite different, Grant came from a blue-collar working-class family. Life was not always easy for the star. When he was nine years old, he came home from school one day to find his mother gone. Told she was visiting a seaside resort, the truth was that she was in a mental institution, and Cary would not see her again until his late 20s.\n\nComing to the United States in 1920 to play in the Broadway show Good Times, Grant stayed on when the show closed. He joined Paramount Studios in 1932, but when his contract was up, he became an independent. This allowed him to choose his own scripts and he chose wisely. What followed was a long succession of tremendously successful screwball comedies like Bringing Up Baby, with Katharine Hepburn and My Favorite Wife with Irene Dunne.\n\nIn the 1940s and 50s Grant also developed a close relationship with Alfred Hitchcock. He appeared in several highly acclaimed Hitchcock films such as Suspicion, Notorious, To Catch a Thief, and North by Northwest."
