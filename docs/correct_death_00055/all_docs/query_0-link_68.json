        "text": "World War II\n\nWorld War II (WW II or WW 2), also known as the \"Second World War\" (after the recent \"Great War\"), was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, though related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations - including all of the great powers - eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.\n\nIt was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (during which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers (during which approximately one million people were killed, including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\n\nThe National World War II Memorial honors the 16 million who served in the armed forces of the U.S., the more than 400,000 who died, and all who supported the war effort from home. In addition to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., the organization has also created the World War II Registry to preserve the memory of America's World War II generation. It contains a listing of Americans who contributed to the war effort in uniform and on the home front.

MISS - When someone in the newspaper business dies, we tend to doff our hats to them, knowing something of what their life has been like. So in accord, we'd like to pay our respects to Bill Burleson, a reporter who worked his way up to editor and publisher of the Gridley Herald, a newspaper owned by his family. Burleson, who died Dec. 14 at the age of 78, was an old-fashioned kind of newspaperman, who didn't mince words when it came to criticizing government failings or complimenting a community's strength. Being the third generation of a newspaper family gave him a taste of what a community newspaper should be. He worked at the Gridley Herald for 48 years, ending in 1998 when he retired after selling the newspaper to Liberty Group Publishing, a chain of small community newspapers based in Illinois. We'd like to extend our sympathies to his family, many of whom are still in this area.\n\nKenneth Nelson (I1006681) (27 FEB 1926 - )\n\nHe is in the U.S. Navy at Pensacola, Fla.
