This bridge was the first of its kind to span the Mississippi, and right from the start riverboat captains had trouble getting used to the innovation.\n\n1856—The steamboat Effie Afton hits a piling and sinks, causing the steamboat company to sue the railroad for obstructing the river. The railroad company hires lawyer Abraham Lincoln from Springfield, Illinois, to represent them. In 1862, the Supreme Court rules in “Hurd vs. the Railroad Bridge Company” that if a bridge is for public use and enough room is left for navigation, it is not an obstruction.\n\nSeptember 28, 1858—The steamer Fannie Harris collides with a pier and sinks.

Check shall be numbered in the regular corresponding order of the registry book. 1875 charge was $1.30. By 1879, newspaper accounts list the City Marshal as the person to register dog licenses. In 1875, an owner who put a fake dog check on their dog would face a $5.00 fine. Dogs without checks could be shot on sight by the Marshal or police.\n\nElectrical Utilities\n\nElectric service was organized May 1, 1882\n\n(Source: Growing Up with the Tri-Cities – SC333.7932 Gro)\n\nTurkey Notes: A Davenport Thanksgiving Tradition\n\nTurkey Notes are said to date back to about 1890 (though this cannot be confirmed), and are considered to be strictly a local custom.\n\nThe origin of Turkey Notes is unknown. One theory is that a local family wrote them for a large Thanksgiving dinner, and the guests and/or the adult children took the idea home to use the following years. Another claims that German immigrants brought the tradition to Davenport and used it to celebrate their first truly American holiday. A third suggests that an enterprising teacher invented the Notes in order to keep her holiday-minded students under control.\n\nHowever the first Turkey Note came to be written, there are now basic rules to be followed in creating new ones:\n\nA Turkey Note is a short, three- or four-line poem, using “Turkey” as the first word of the first two lines. Purists use colors for the second word of these first lines, but this is not strictly necessary. The poem can be a compliment, an insult, or just funny (depending, of course, on your sense of humor):\n\nTurkey Red,\n\nTurkey Blue,\n\nTurkey says,\n\n“I love you!”\n\nOr\n\nTurkey green,\n\nTurkey yellow,\n\nThere’s always room\n\nFor pumpkin jello!\n\nOr\n\nTurkey Samuel\n\nTurkey Sam\n\nTurkey cries, “Please choose the ham!”\n\nThe poem, which is usually left unsigned, is rolled into a tube and wrapped in colored paper, which is tied at both ends with string, yarn, or ribbon. These Turkey Notes are left by the side of each plate at Thanksgiving dinner or are passed out to friends, like Valentines.\n\n___________________\n\nSources:\n\nFeeney, Bob. “Those Turkey Notes.” Times-Democrat.
