        "text": "Background\n\nArchibald Alec Leach was born over a century ago, on January 18, 1904, in northern Bristol, England, to Elias James Leach and Elsie Maria Leach. His father worked at a factory, and his mother was a seamstress. Grant had a traumatic childhood. Before he was born, his brother died from tuberculosis; his father struggled with substance abuse and alcoholism, and his mother suffered from clinical depression. When he turned four, his mother took him to the cinema, taught him some songs, and wanted him to learn the piano. However, Grant’s mother did not know how to give nor receive affection, which significantly impacted his relationships with women. It didn’t help that his father placed his mother in a mental institution when he was nine but told him she had left and later died, causing him to resent her. However, this Capricorn later learned she was alive when he turned 31. Apparently, Grant had a hard-knock life before his success. He reunited with his mother in 1938.\n\nGrant made some money as a performer in New York City before his debut film appearance on “This is the Night” in 1932, after officially adopting the new name, ‘Cary Grant.’ In 1933, he appeared in “I’m No Angel” and “She Done Him Wrong,” which gained recognition. After the former film, his weekly salary increased from $450 to $750. In 1937, after he did “Topper,” his career started to take off. In 1938, he starred in “Bringing Up Baby” next to Katharine Hepburn. More flourishing and not-so-successful films followed before he appeared on “Suspicion” in 1941, which was the first of the four movies he did with Alfred Hitchcock. Grant also transitioned from comedy to drama during his career. From “Only Angels Have Wings” in 1939, to “Penny Serenade” in 1941, and “None but the Lonely Heart” in 1944.\n\nGrant starred in several more movies, including the 1963 “Charade” with Audrey Hepburn. He retired in 1966 as a naturalized American citizen, which he received in 1942. At the time of his retirement as one of the wealthiest stars in Hollywood, Grant was on marriage number four with Dyan Cannon, who became the mother of his daughter, Jennifer. He was married five times and had several affairs before his demise in 1986. Grant lived a full life. He was friends with some of the most successful people in Hollywood and owned multiple properties in Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, and Malibu."
