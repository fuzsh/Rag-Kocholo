        "text": "Cary Grant's Movie Colony compound, one of the oldest of Palm Springs' Old Hollywood estates, is back on the market, asking $3.495 million.\n\nLas Palomas, as a sign outside identifies the property, covers 1.5 acres just west of Ruth Hardy Park. At its center is a Spanish Andalusian farmhouse, which was designed by Spanish Colonial revivalist John Byers, AIA, and completed in 1930. The 5,300-square-foot house still has its original shutters, now painted royal blue, and its wood-burning fireplaces.\n\nCary Grant bought the house in 1954, after the success of films like \"His Girl Friday\" and \"Arsenic and Old Lace.\" He intended to retire — but according to The Agency, a brokerage co-listing the house, Alfred Hitchcock often stayed in Grant's guest wing. Local lore claims that, during one of his visits, Hitchcock convinced Grant to come back to the movie business and star in the films that defined his career, like \"To Catch a Thief,\" \"An Affair to Remember\" and \"North by Northwest.\"\n\nAccording to The Agency, other frequent guests included: Howard Hughes, Sophia Loren, Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly and Clark Gable, several of whom had Palm Springs homes themselves. Grant's two wives, Betsy Drake and Dyan Cannon, also lived here during the nearly 20 years Grant owned the house.\n\nRAT PACK IN PALM SPRINGS: Read the series about Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and company\n\n\"He spent weeks here,\" said Guy Burrows, a local doctor and former mayoral candidate who has owned the house since 2012. \"He called this his cathedral. He said, 'this is where I come to be at peace.'\"\n\nThe main house is covered in white stucco, accented by tall blue-shuttered windows from which light pours into the home. Its roof is subdued Spanish tile. Inside, accents include exposed ceiling beams, French doors and 40-foot ceilings in the great room. Terracotta floor tiles, art deco bathroom tiles and custom cabinets are all original to the house, according to The Agency.\n\nBurrows and his wife bought the house in 2012 and began a painstaking restoration. For missing light fixtures, they traveled Southern California looking for iron pieces from the late 1920s and early 1930s. To add storage, they found wood from other 1929 buildings and had carpenters build custom cabinets. They even searched the globe for a toilet that matched one original to the house, but had to settle for one by the same designer from the 1950s.\n\nThe Burrows family also added kitchenettes to both casita spaces, updated electric and plumbing systems and had replacement roof tiles made by the same Corona, Calif. facility that made the originals.\n\n\"When you own a property like the Grant estate, you're the custodian,\" said listing agent Eric Lavey. \"(Burrows) has gone through the entire property very meticulously, systems updated, true to form, the way it would've been but with a modern touch.\"\n\nCELEBRITY REAL ESTATE: Visit the Dinah Shore house, now Leonardo DiCaprio's\n\nAfter Grant sold the house in 1972, it passed to bodybuilder Frank Zane, famous for defeating Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1968 Mr. Universe contest. Zane turned the property into a private health resort for about a decade.\n\nThe 1.5-acre grounds include a stone terrace and a variety of trees — eucalyptus, agave, citrus, date, pomegranate and Japanese plum, to name a few, according to The Agency.\n\nIncluding the guest wing designed by Wallace Neff in the mid-1950s, the estate includes six bedrooms and six bathrooms.\n\nCELEBRITY REAL ESTATE: Sinatra's Villa Maggio down to $3.95 million\n\nListing agent Lavey said the house is generating interest, giving him \"a busy couple of weeks.\" The buyer, he thinks, will likely be someone familiar with Palm Springs' Movie Colony neighborhood, who's been eyeing this street-to-street lot and celebrity pedigreed home.\n\nPalm Springs \"is truly becoming the Hamptons,\" said Lavey, who owns a William Krisel-designed house in Palm Springs himself. \"Palm Springs, we all know, has come into its own — to say 'renaissance' is probably a cliche at this point, to say 'resurgence' is a cliche.\"\n\nThe house's furnishings are not included in the list price, but are negotiable outside of escrow.\n\nView the listing here.\n\nRosalie Murphy covers real estate and business at The Desert Sun.
