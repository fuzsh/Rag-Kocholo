        "text": "True Hollywood Story: E! teases brand new series\n\nIt was to be a triumphant homecoming. Formerly known as Archie Leach, he had been expelled from school aged 14 and ran away to join an acrobatic troupe. But now he was rich, famous and under contract to Paramount Pictures, which had given him his new name. “No one’s going to pay money to see a movie starring a guy called Archie Leach,” studio executives had told him. He embraced the name and the identity that came with it. In the depths of the Great Depression, he was earning $750 a week – more than many people made in a year.\n\nHe lived in a mansion with a swimming pool and views over Los Angeles. With his tall, toned physique, sleek black hair, deep brown eyes and dimpled chin, he made a perfect co-star for Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus (1932) and Mae West in She Done Him Wrong (1932) and I’m No Angel (1933).\n\nThese leading ladies looked even better for having such a handsome co-star on their arm.\n\nThe trip to Bristol was prompted when his father, Elias Leach, phoned him at Paramount, asking him to come home.\n\nIn the 1930s, the journey from Los Angeles to London took more than a week by liner, but Cary readily agreed.\n\nHis fiancée actress Virginia Cherrill, was planning to go to London to make a film. He would join her there, and they could spend Christmas with his family.\n\nHe travelled with his best friend, fellow Paramount star Randolph Scott, and all three – Cary, Virginia and Scott – stayed in suites at London’s Savoy Hotel, and appeared together on a BBC radio programme celebrating Cary’s success in Hollywood.\n\nBut when Cary travelled to Bristol alone he was taken aback by Elias Leach’s appearance. At the age of 61, he had the jowly, haggard appearance of “an old broken-down alcoholic”.\n\nThe actor wasn’t surprised when his father insisted they talk at a nearby pub. After getting the pints in and sitting awkwardly for a moment, Cary got the surprise of his life.\n\n“It’s about your mother,” his father suddenly said, looking down at his glass. “She’s not dead.” Cary couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “What is that supposed to mean?” he demanded of his father.\n\nThe guilt that Elias Leach had been harbouring for so many years now spilled out.\n\n“I was trying to protect you,” his father insisted over and over again, as a bewildered Cary broke in to ask, “Are you telling me my mother is still alive?”\n\nHe had last seen his mother Elsie on February 3, 1915, when he was 11 and left for school just like any other day.\n\nBut when he returned home, she wasn’t there. He was distraught when his father told him she had gone to the seaside for a rest. Why didn’t she say goodbye?\n\nAnd why couldn’t he go with her?\n\nWhen she did not return for days, and then for weeks, his father refused to discuss it.\n\nTiring of his questions, his older cousins told him his mother was dead. Her disappearance cast a long shadow over what remained of his childhood. He had been the focus of Elsie Leach’s life.\n\nShe had aspirations for herself and her son that could not be fulfilled on her husband’s factory-worker wages, but she instilled good manners in Archie and made sure he always looked neat and well presented.\n\nElsie ensured he did well in class too, and he was the top pupil in his year at Bishop Road School while under his mother’s care.\n\nBut when she vanished, he was left alone, hungry and cold, most days.\n\nHis father gave up the family home in Cotham Brow and moved into rooms in a shared house with Archie’s paternal grandmother in the tougher neighbourhood of St Paul's.\n\nHis grandmother was an alcoholic who took little interest in him, and his father stayed out carousing many nights.\n\nArchie had won a scholarship to Fairfield Secondary School but, without parental influence, all too often skipped classes.\n\nInstead, he spent his days wandering the streets of Bristol, looking for work and buying fish and chips and cinema tickets whenever he could afford them.\n\nEventually, he found work in the city’s music halls as a backstage runner and fell in love with show business.\n\nHe was fascinated by the shows and thrilled to meet the performers, who paid more attention to the neglected, lonely boy than his own family had done.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nWhen he was expelled from school after missing too many classes, he eagerly auditioned for the Bob Pender Troupe of acrobats, an act featuring stilt-walking, gymnastics and exotic dances.\n\nPender took him on and trained him, and the troupe became Archie’s new family.\n\nHe spent seven years touring with Pender and similar music hall troupes, first in Britain and then on the American vaudeville circuit.\n\nHis new life was one of constant travel, seeing the world from train windows, staying in boarding house lodgings, and performing several shows a day.\n\nIt was not until he was in his mid-twenties that he left acrobatics behind to play speaking roles on stage.\n\nHis good looks ensured he could play the matinee idol, first in Broadway shows and then in Hollywood films.\n\nNow, having travelled all those miles from Bristol and returned for a homecoming, he finally learned the truth about the day his life changed in 1915.\n\nHis father told him he had committed his mother to the Bristol Lunatic Asylum and she had been institutionalised ever since, insisting: “I had to put her away.”\n\nSuddenly, the penny dropped. Through all the years that Cary trusted him, his father had been lying to him.\n\nThrough all the years he felt betrayed by his mother, it was actually his mother who had been betrayed and abandoned.\n\nThrough all the years he had sought adventure and wealth and fame in the world away from Bristol, she had been locked away, alone and seemingly forgotten.\n\nAs the full force of the realisation hit him, he could only flee from the pub. “You should thank me!” he heard his father bellowing after him. “I did it for you.”\n\nHe meant he had tried to save his son from the stigma attached to mental illness, but it was the worst thing he could say.\n\nCary would spend the rest of his life wondering if his father had his mother committed simply to be rid of her. He did not discover for years that his parents had another son who died in infancy, and Elsie had never quite recovered from the loss.\n\nHe did know that his parents had an unhappy marriage, arguing frequently about money (the lack of it), and he knew that his father had taken up with another woman once Elsie was out of the way.\n\nCary would wonder, too, if he should not have done more to find his missing mother.\n\nWhen he fled from the pub, he went on a bender so prolonged that it ended with him spending weeks in a private hospital in London, where he dried out over the Christmas and New Year holidays.\n\nThen he returned to Bristol to see his mother on her 57th birthday, February 8, 1934.\n\nHe could not help but imagine her as she had looked 19 years earlier, with thick black hair and smooth olive complexion.\n\nSo he scarcely recognised the prematurely wizened old woman, with white hair and missing teeth, whom he met in the asylum.\n\n“Who are you?” she asked him, because he bore so little resemblance to the 11-year-old schoolboy she had last seen.\n\n“I’m your son,” he replied, “I’m Archie.” She stared at him blankly as he tried to explain he had only just discovered she was alive.\n\nElsie could not believe this fully grown man – who told her his name was now Cary Grant and that he was rich and famous and lived in America – was her Archie.\n\nThey were strangers to one another, and yet Cary’s screen image as the perfectly dressed, debonair charmer had its roots in the care Elsie had taken with his early upbringing.\n\nShe had a profound influence on him even in her absence, and henceforth he would look after her.\n\nWhen Elias Leach died in 1935, Cary became his mother’s legal guardian and arranged for her release from the asylum.\n\nHe supported her financially until her death, at the age of 95, in 1973, and they gradually got to know one another again over the decades.\n\nFriends and family observed that, on his many visits to Bristol over the years, Cary and his mother could be stiff and awkward with one another.\n\nThey seemed to have difficulty reconnecting. The many letters that they wrote to one another, however, tell a different story.\n\nFull of love and longing, the letters tell the story of a mother and son bewildered by their lengthy separation and eager to re-establish their bond after so many years apart.\n\n• Cary Grant, the Making of a Hollywood Legend by Mark Glancy (Oxford University Press, £22.99) is out now.
