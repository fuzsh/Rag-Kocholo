I parked my car in the driveway crooked. I shouldn’t be so friendly to the postman because he might get the wrong idea, or to the maid because it was good to keep a distance.”\n\nDyan was pressured to take LSD with Cary – but she has also admitted she left plenty of scandals out of the book.\n\nShe added: “The thing that was really challenging for me in writing the book was what to say and what not to say.\n\n“Cary had so many people who loved him and I didn’t want to take the stars out of their eyes… (mine) disappeared for a while but, curiously, the stars are back in my eyes again.”\n\nDyan’s autobiography has been made into a four-part miniseries now streaming on Britbox about Cary’s life called ‘Archie’ – as the actor’s real name was Archie Leach.\n\nHe grew up poor in Bristol, England, and when Archie was aged nine, his dad placed his mother in a mental institution and told his son she had died.\n\nCary – who changed his name in 1941 and died in 1986 at the age of 82 – did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31 and was left with abandonment issues that coloured his relationships with all other women."
