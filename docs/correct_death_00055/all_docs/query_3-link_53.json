        "text": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - While Caitlin Clark made the #22 famous in Iowa City, she isn’t the first Iowa women’s basketball player to wear the number. Susan (Koering) Orvis wore the number from 1993 to 1997 for the Hawkeyes.\n\n“I am from just up the road small town Stanwood, Iowa, I played six-player basketball in high school we were one of the last small schools to play that until they mandated that change in 1994,″ Orvis said. “I had a lot to learn you know I didn’t play AAU basketball I really had zero five-on-five experience so it took me some time.”\n\nSusan arrived in Iowa right after Vivian Stringer led the Hawkeyes to the program’s first Final Four.\n\n“The games were fun, we competed at a high level,” Orvis said.\n\nDespite the remarkable success the program was achieving, the interest from fans was far from what it is today.\n\n“I would say we were probably averaged three to five thousand most nights a lot of the nights where we had a bigger crowd we were in the 9 to 10 range and that was pretty neat,” Orvis said.\n\nPretty neat, but a far cry from a sold-out arena every night with 15,000 fans.\n\nFor Orvis to see the way number 22 has elevated the Iowa program and all of women’s basketball is surreal.\n\n“I think what I really appreciate about Caitlin is obviously she’s a homegrown Iowa kid, she stayed home she said I want to take Iowa to the next level and committed to that and I think this is also a day and age where we’re seeing a lot of transfers she stayed home,” Orvis said.\n\nLike so many who have worn the Iowa jersey, Orvis and Clark share an extraordinary passion for the game and the Iowa program.\n\n“I am somebody that has really big dreams goals and aspirations but to put it on this level and this magnitude that would be crazy for me to say. I would say no, but I dreamed of doing really big things and playing in front of a big crowd and going to the final four. Maybe not quite on this level that is really hard to dream. You can always exceed expectations and I think that’s been one of the coolest parts,” said Clark.\n\nCaitlin Clark wasn’t the first Hawkeye to wear number 22, but she should be the last.\n\n“My husband even jokes with me a little bit he says you know 22 is gonna be hanging in the rafters and I just you know I have to smile at him and be like well it’s not because of anything that I have done,” said Orvis who coached for 12 seasons at Muscatine after her playing career."
