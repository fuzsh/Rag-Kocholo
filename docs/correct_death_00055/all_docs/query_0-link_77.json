        "text": "Hello everyone! This is part four of my “Lives of the Packard Women” series. In this post, I’ll focus on over 90 other women, their children, and other cousins. This post is part of an effort I’m implementing in an effort to reverse the previous male-centered nature of this blog. My plan is to focus more on women’s stories on my other blogs (Millin’ Round Ireland, Digging for Italian Roots, and Decoding my Transylvanian roots, or any other blogs I decide to create) as well. Anyway, if you want to read the previous parts of this series, see parts one, two, and three. With that, let me begin.\n\nLet me first say that there are some women which will not be covered in this post, either because I have written about them before (like Elizabeth Dwight Packard), or because there is very little information them. [1] I tried to choose women to profile in this post that I could at least establish the basic facts for. With that, let me go onto the first woman who will be focused on in this post: Mary Packard. She was one of the first Packards to come over to North America with Elizabeth, and her father, in 1638 on the Diligent. It is generally established that that she was born in 1636 or 1637 in Wymondham, Suffolk, England, where she, her mother, and father were living. It is generally understood that she began living in Bridgewater, as did the other Packards, like her 10 siblings, including four sisters: Hannah (1648-1727), Deborah (1648-1725), Deliverance (1652-1708), and Elizabeth (1668-1729). The number of children Mary’s mother raised was said to number twelve in all, as stated in a poem by Mrs. Nethiah Hayward Thayer, like in the following verse:\n\nOur history fails to mention the name\n\nOf Samuel’s wife, who has little fame;\n\nWe honor her too. She clothed and she fed.\n\nTwelve children to her their daily prayers said.\n\nInformation about Mary is sketchy, in contrast to her father, a landowner in Bridgewater. It is known that she married into the Philips family in either 1654 or 1656. [2] It is also established on Find a Grave that she had at least five children, including one female infant who didn’t even live a year, reportedly named Avis, and four sons. Other evidence show she had five other children, including four more sons, and a daughter: Mary (1660-1739). Information on some of them is sketchy. Beyond this, her date of death is disputed. Family trees on Ancestry state she died on June 7, 1697, but cite either bad sources or no sources for this date. Even worse, Find a Grave states that she died in 1684, since her husband remarried to Elizabeth Edson in 1692, citing her husband’s will as evidence. I had previously stated that she lived past Dec. 15, 1697, using a signature on a document to support that assertion, but I’m not sure I agree with that anymore. In case, the specifics of Mary’s later life remain a bit of a mystery. [3]\n\nThis brings me to Mary’s sister, Hannah. She was born in 1648, first marrying into the Briggs family in 1669, and then into the Randall family two years later. With her second husband, she would have at least two children, including a daughter named Deborah in September 1683. Deborah would die many years later, in November 1760. As for Hannah, she would live until April 1727. While there is a Hannah Randall who wrote a will in October 1726, this is not her. [4]\n\nThat brings me to the two other sisters of Hannah: Deliverance and Elizabeth. The former was reportedly born in Hingham, many years after the family had immigrated to North America, from England, and she had the same mother. In She was born in July 1652, and at the age of 32, she married into the Washburn family, sometime in 1684. Her husband had been married one time previously, to Abigail Leonard. She would have at least seven children per her husband’s will in 1729, including three daughters: Patience, Deliverance, and Elizabeth. [5] She would die in July 1708.\n\nThis brings me to Elizabeth, who I mentioned earlier as the sister of Deliverance and Hannah. I mentioned her on this blog previously in July 2018, stating that “Elizabeth Packard…reportedly married Thomas Place of Boston on November 14, 1665, a fact which cannot be confirmed within available online town records”. There is more to her life than that anecdote. For one, she was born in 1639, seemingly in Hingham, and she married into Augur family in November 1665 in Taunton/Boston, proving that the date asserted for the person she reportedly married was incorrect. [6] Furthermore, I’m finding nothing showing she even married that man is incorrect, or that she even married into the Place family at all! There are some family trees on Ancestry.com which claim this, but provide no sources to back up this claim. She would reportedly die in 1729 and is likely buried somewhere in Bridgewater. More than this, she would be involved in her father’s will, which distributed his land, including to her son, her sisters Deliverance, Mary, Hannah, and Deborah, and many others, as I wrote in July 2018. [7]\n\nI’ll be jumping ahead to Lydia Smith, the wife of my 8th great-granduncle. She married a Packard sometime before 1682, and had thirteen children, including nine daughters (Margaret, Sarah, Faithful, Hannah, Deliverance, Lydia, Mary, Deborah, and Elizabeth) and four sons, including one who was infamously a slaveowner. I’ll start with Margaret Packard. Born in 1682, she married into the Washburn family at age 28, either in 1709 or 1710, with the ceremony officiated by John? Keith, a minister in in Bridgewater. [8] She would go on to have eight children, including three daughters: Margaret (1718-1743), Jane (1722-1793), and Content (1724-1807). She would die at the age of 61 in December 1743 and be buried in Bridgewater’s First Cemetery.\n\nSome would have little information about them, like Sarah, who was confused with Sarah Howard Packard (born in 1684). The same could be said about Faithful, who was born in 1687. She was the mother of seven children, including at least one daughter (Rebecca), after she married into the Vaughn family. She would die in April 1753. Then there’s Hannah. She was reportedly born in Bridgewater in 1670 or 1671. In June 1722, she would marry into the Mowry family. It is not known when Hannah would die. There is a profile for a Hannah Mowry who died, but she is an infant. It is asserted that she had two husbands, both in the Mowry family, and that she had two children from her first husband, including one daughter, Lydia (1727-1805). [9]\n\nThis brings me to the other five daughters of Lydia Smith: Deliverance, Lydia, Mary, Deborah, and Elizabeth. Starting with Deliverance, a lot of her life is sketchy. Some say she was born sometime between 1680 and 1689, in 1677, or even, as some assert, in 1690. But, it appears is that she died in January 1776, in South Bridgewater. [10] Other records seemed to confuse her with other Deliverance Packards. Apart from that is the story of Lydia Packard. She was born in either 1686 or 1694, married into the Howell family in April 1718, and died, it is reported, in 1737. [11]\n\nThen, there’s still Mary, Deborah, and Elizabeth. The first of these three, Mary, was born in 1695. At the age of 23, in September 1721, she would marry into the Leonard family. She would have four sons, and no daughters. She would die many years later, in March 1790. In comparison, the life of Deborah is much more sketchy. She was reportedly born sometime between 1700 and 1709, and married into Mitchell family in December 1725 (not in 1728 as some have asserted). It also appears that she died in 1744, as according to a probate document that year, and administration document showing that she died sometime before April 2, 1744. [12] It is even more speculative for Elizabeth, who is asserted as living from 1702 to 1744, but no information is provided!\n\nI’d like to go ahead many years to Julia Packard, the mother-in-law of my second great-grandaunt. In a funny twist of fate, she was the grandmother-in-law of Hattie Belle Mills, my 2nd great-grandaunt, and the sister of Dorothy “Dora” Ann Mills, who married into the Packard family, and is my primary connection to the Packards as a whole! Hattie married into the Beals family and specifically to one of Julia’s sons. To be more specific, Julia had ten children, including six daughters (Parmelia Carpenter, Elizabeth “Betsey” Annis, Julia, Emeline Frances, Harriet Cordelia, and Abby Alsa), all with the surname of Beals, as she had married into that family in November 1830, at the age of 19. She would have her last child in 1855. By 1860, she was living in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, 917 miles away from Goshen, Massachusetts, where she had lived only five years before with her farmer husband and children! Also there at the time were three other individuals, one of whom had the last name of Russell, who would marry her daughter Emeline six years later. The reason for this movement is not currently known. Strangely enough, the family had moved back to Massachusetts five years later, specifically to Easthampton, which was about 20 miles south of Goshen. [13]\n\nJulia and her family remained in Easthampton, where census enumerators only cared to say she was “keeping house”. She even lived with the family of her son and his family, which included a wife named Ellen Elizabeth Noble and daughter named Mabel Cynthia. This all changed after Julia’s husband died in May 1886. Only a few years later, she would be living in Northampton, about five miles Northeast of Easthampton. as a widow. [14] She likely returned to the former city, and lived out her life there until the end of her life in August 1895.\n\nThere’s more to her story, and that is contained within her husband’s will, written in February 1874, some years before his death. In that will, in which he gives her “use and improvement” of his estate, as one of the executors. That is definitely something of note. A screenshot from that page is shown below:\n\nI’m going to focus on yet another Packard, many connections away, specifically Elizabeth Derby Packard (herein, my fifth cousin four times removed. She had three siblings, including two sisters: Frances Elizabeth and Martha Walcott. She was the daughter of Elizabeth Derby Wolcott and she would die at the age of eight in July 1885.\n\nIt was different when it came to Elizabeth’s sister, Frances Elizabeth. She is not to be confused with Frances Appleton Packard, daughter of Elizabeth Frances Appleton. More specifically, Frances Elizabeth was born in May 1880 in Providence, Rhode Island. She would grow up there with her sisters and stay there until 1900. A few years later she would marry into the McClellan family. By 1910, she was living in Haverhill, Massachusetts with her daughter Elizabeth, two sons, her mother, two servants (Josephine Cloonan and Mary E. Killoran), and hired man (Joseph Koluski). [15] She may have made trips across the Atlantic during this period, as she did cross do so with her father in December 1898, traveling to “Gibraltar, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Malta, Egypt, Palestine, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Constantinople, Greece and Italy”. [16]\n\nFrances Elizabeth would continue living in Haverhill until at least 1914. Six years later, she would have moved to Andover, Massachusetts. She would stay there until the end of her life. However, after her husband died, she would have another source of income. Elizabeth would survive until over age ninety-one in September 1971. [17] Her obituary in the Boston Globe would add that she was an “accomplished painter” (as was one of her sons) but primarily defined her as the daughter of her father, who was a “noted” intellectual. She would also own 332 South Main Street in Andover, a house described as having “a large porch along the whole front (west side) of the house…[and] enclosed with glass – individual glass frames, all vertical stripes”. As it turned out, Frances went on various trips, even to France (as she did in September 1932 and visited her daughter Elizabeth there), for her painting, as evidenced in newspaper articles, some of which describe her as a “skilled watercolorist”. [18] Frances Elizabeth was not alone in this. As I noted in Part Two of this series, Mabel Blanche Packard, daughter of Mary Augusta Penfield, was an accomplished artist in her own right as well.\n\nThis brings me to Martha Walcott, the sister of Frances. She some of her entire life in Masachusetts, beginning with her birth in Salem. However, by 1880 she would be living in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school. Twenty years later, she would still be in the same town, and was living with her parents and siblings. [19] This changed in 1910. By that time, she was living in Boston. She was a lodger on 7 Walnut Street in a lodging house run by Helen A. Todd, a 64-year-old widowed woman, along with many other people. Census enumerators described her as social worker for a church. There were other lodging houses and families on the same street, either working as wait staff, private security, typewriters, teachers, lawyers, cooks, or maids. The same was the case on the nearby Mt. Vernon Street and Beacon Street. [20] As it turns out, 7 Walnut Street is nearby Boston Common, a historic public park in the city of Boston. The location is not within the Walnut Park Historic District.\n\nIn later years, she would move to Andover, living with her mother. A 51-year-old lodger named Laura Black, who was a teacher, was there in the household in 1920. This changed in 1930, when she was living by herself. Ten years later, she would live in Andover with her brother and an English servant/working housekeeper named Francis E. Mangill. In the last census she would appear in, in 1950, she would be living with a 71-year-old Irish maid named Roseann Racine. [21] She would die six years later and be buried in Andover, Massachusetts. Like some other Packards, she never married. This could imply something about her as a person, perhaps, and it could be something to research more in-depth in the future, for another post.\n\nWith that, I’ll be focusing on the sisters of Clarissa, who I mentioned in the first part of this series, and daughters of Ruth Nash. The first of these was Nancy, born in 1796. Little is known about her life, apart from that fact that she married into the Townsend family, as his second wife, and lived in Jericho, Vermont. [22] This is because she married into the family in 1856, then died the following year in 1857.\n\nThe second daughter of Ruth Nash I wish to mention is Lavina Packard. Born in November 1798, she would marry into the Whiton family sometime before 1850, living in the same household as her mother and other Packards. Ten years later, she would be living with her husband, son, and daughter Emaline. [23] She would die two years later in January 1862. She also had a daughter named Melvina, born in 1830.\n\nThat brings me to the last two women of this grouping: Mehitable and Azariah Rouse. The first of these, Mehitable, born in March 1804. At age 21, she would marry into the Mead family. She would have three children, including one daughter named Clarissa M. She would die at the young age of 41 in June 1845. After her death, her husband would marry again to a woman named Caroline Rogers. [24] Azariah Rouse was different, as family stories say she was born in November 1817, but provide no other information.\n\nWith that, I’m focusing on someone entirely different: Ida Martha Packard, my first cousin three times removed. A daughter of Julia Emeline Beals, and with nine siblings, including two sisters: Rachel Alice (1896-1989) and Ruth Emeline (1899-1981). She was born in September 1892 in Goshen. But, she would grow up her early years in Cummington, and would be going to school with her siblings in 1900, including her sisters Rachel and Ruth. In February 1912 this would change as she married into the Kenney family in Williamsburg, Massachusetts. By 1920, Ida would be living with her husband, a refining company driver, and her sister, Ruth, a winder at a magnet company. She would still be living in Springfield, as she did in ten years earlier, but with her brother, as she worked as a short-order cook, while her husband was a truck driver.\n\nThis would be no different in 1940, living in Springfield throughout the 1930s, on 18th East Hooker Street. The difference that year is that census enumerators said she had “housework” while her husband was a truck driver for a sewer project. The same was the case in 1950, however, and they were still living in Springfield. [26] She would live for another 23 years after that, and pass in February 1973, dying in Williamsburg, Massachusetts Through it all, she would never have any children, which could say something about her relationship with her husband and perhaps herself.\n\nRachel Alice (1896-1989) and Ruth Emeline (1899-1981) had lives differing from Ida, despite some overlap, as I’ve noted earlier. For Rachel, she was born in West Cummington in August 1896 and would grow up in Cummington. By 1910, however, she would be living in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, with her siblings, parents, and a boarder named George Blake. Seven years later, she would marry into the Pratt family in Goshen, while she lived in Northampton. By 1920, she would be living over 13 miles away in Chesterfield, which was northwest of Northampton, with her husband, and daughter (and only child at the time) Alice Elizabeth. [27]\n\nIn later years, this would change. She would have three other children, including two daughters: Elisie A. (in 1920) and Rose A. (in 1922). In addition, she would be back in Goshen, with her brother even living with her family at one point. Census enumerators would say she would be doing “home housework”. She would be living in Goshen until at least 1950. After that, her life is sketchy. It is recorded that she last residence was in West Brookfield, Massachusetts, and she died in Northampton in February 1989. [28] Otherwise, an obituary in the Daily Hampshire Gazette provides some details:\n\n…Rachel A (Packard) Pratt…died Wednesday at the Pioneer Valley Nursing Home in Northampton[.] Born in Cummington Aug 4 1896 she was the daughter of the late Benjamin F and Julia (Beals) Packard. She had lived in Goshen and Cummington all her life. Mrs Pratt was a member of the Goshen and Cummington congregational churches and was active in the Women’s Fellowship of both churches. She was also an honorary member of the Cummington Grange. Mrs Pratt was the widow of Horace N Pratt who died in 1972 She leaves two sons…three daughters Alice…Elsie…and Rosa\n\nWith that, I’d like to talk about her sister, Ruth Emeline Packard. Born in December 1899, she also grew up in Cummington and moved to Williamsburg like the rest of her family. At age 21, she married into the Bohn family, when she was living with her sister Ida in Springfield, Massachusetts. [29] She would have six children, including four daughters: Dorothy, Evelyn, Elizabeth A., and Phyllis Ruth.\n\nRuth would continue living in Springfield with her husband, a gas station attendant at first, and family until at least 1951. Her life after that point is sketchy. It is know that she died in November 6, 1981 in Palmer, Massachusetts. [30] However, there are various photographs of her posted by John Bohn on Ancestry.com, including with her children, husband, and more. Most valuable, beyond that, is an obituary which describes her as a former cafeteria employee at Wesson Memorial Hospital, along with a member of the Ladies Guild, and First Unitarian Universalist Church. It also notes that she was a member of the Adelphi Chapter of Eastern Star, Supreme Council Order of Amaranth, Ladies of the Orient, the Valley Swingsters Swing Dancers, and Morning Star Rebekh Lodge, while stating that her husband died in 1959.\n\nMoving many ancestral links away, I’d like to focus on Sylvia H. Packard, my third cousin six times removed. Born in June 1811 to Sarah Hayward, she had seven siblings, including four sisters (Olive, Sally Perkins, Sarah, and Elmira) and one half-sister (Ruth). At the age of 22, she married into the Howard family in Brockton, Massachusetts, the town where she had been born. By 1850, she would be living in North Bridgewater with her carpenter husband and son. She would remain in North Bridgewater, while her husband would become a cabinet maker. By 1860, this would change as a 53-year-old woman (and common school teacher) named Sally Packard, likely a cousin, would be living in the same household as her, along with her mother-in-law Huldah. In the years that followed, she would continue to live in North Bridgewater, until sometime after 1870. I say this because, by 1880, she was living in Brockton. [31]\n\nSylvia would live in Brockton for the rest of her life, in the years after the death of her husband in October 1891, and would be listed as a landlady in 1900 by census enumerators. She would die later that year, in November 1900, at the age of 89, from senility, and her original parents were not even mentioned! [32] Sylvia’s sisters were different. Apart from Sally Perkins who didn’t even live a year, one sister was born before Sylvia: Olive. She was born in September 1795. At the age of 22, in December 1818, she would marry into the Shaw family, in Bridgewater. [33] She had one child who didn’t even live a year and died three years later in August 1822, at the age of 26! Similarly, Elmira died at the age of nine the same year. The same was the case for her half-sister, Huldah, who only lived to age 37, but had six children, only two of which grew to adulthood (two sons) who far outlived her.\n\nWhen it comes to Sylvia’s other sister Sarah and half-sister Ruth, they lived much longer lives. Born in October 1806, Sarah would be living with her mother in the 1850s in North Bridgewater. She would be living with her sister Sylvia in 1860, described as “Sally” by the census enumerator, which answers my question of who “Sally Packard” (who I mentioned earlier) was, and would be a school teacher, as noted earlier. In 1878, she would write her will, with the probate decided many years later, in 1892, by her siblings, who were living in Brockton. In the years before her funeral and the distribution of her inventory, and assets (numbering over $5,200.00), including money in the Brockton Savings Bank, her will would hint at some wealth. [34] She would give:\n\nThree hundred dollars to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a well-known Christian missionary organization\n\n$100.00 each to her four nieces: a single-woman named Olive Southworth (daughter of Ruth), Martha Packard (unknown relation), S? April Kingman (unknown relation), Phile? White (unknown relation) and three nephews, with the same given to her three surviving siblings, including her sister Sylvia\n\nTwo shares of the First National Bank of Independence in Iowa each to her sister Mary, two nephews, and two nieces (Hannah A. Davidson, Mary C. Noyes)\n\nHer personal estate/residence to her sisters Mary and Sylvia, to be equally divided, so both can reside there\n\nShe appointed Sylvia’s husband as an executor of her estate. [35] The reason for this is obvious: she was likely living with Sylvia at the time, as she is in the same household as Sylvia in 1880, living in Brockton. She would die ten years later, at the age of 85, remaining a single woman for her entire life and never marrying. Likely some of her money came from when she lived in Iowa and was working in a teaching school, living with the Noyer family. [36] It is said she died of old age, if family stories are correct, in April 1892, and was buried in Brockton. Even though she had no sister named Mary (unless this Mary Packard born in Brockton in 1817 was somehow her sister), as far as I’m aware at this present time, perhaps Mary was the same as Mary W. Noyes, who she lived with while in Iowa. The other people mentioned I’m not sure who they are are this present time, as I’ll need to do more investigation into that.\n\nThis brings me to Sylvia’s half sister, Ruth. I’ve mentioned her before. Born in September 1789, her mother was Sarah Perkins, who died when she was eight years old. At the young age of 21, in April 1811, she married into the Southworth family in Bridgewater. She had four children, including one daughter: Olive, who had the middle name of Packard, as the story goes. Her other daughter, Jane, died at the age of 22 in North Bridgewater. [37] Olive would never marry, interestingly enough. As for Ruth, she would remain in North Bridgewater her entire life, working as a shoe fitter at one point, until her death in November 1863. [38] Otherwise, it is worth noting that the father of Ruth, Huldah, Sally Perkins, Sarah, Sylvia H., and Elmira married three women over his life time: Ruth Barrell, Sarah Perkins, and Sarah Hayward.\n\nWhile I could keep going on, I’ve mentioned over 90 women in this post alone, and this post is over 8,100 words. As a result, I’m moving all the other people I was originally planning to examine in this post in another part of this series, so as to not bog down the post. As always, comments are welcome.\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

He states that Elizabeth died before October 1684, probably in Easton, married into the Alger family in November 1665, and lived in West Bridgewater. He goes onto say that Hannah married in 1667 into the Briggs family, then into the Randall family in 1671, with the man she married previously marrying to Joan Drake. As for Jael, he states that she married into the Jones, White (possibly), and Smith families, having six children, including two daughters: Deborah and Hannah. He also notes that Deborah was born in Hingham, died after July 1725, married into the Washburn family, and had six children including Hannah. He further states that Jane and Abigail “probably died young” and that Deliverance married into the Washburn family and had six children, including Elizabeth, Patience, and Deliverance. After reading his page, I decided to add Jael, Jane, and Abigail to my family tree.\n\n[8] Massachusetts, U.S., Compiled Birth, Marriage, and Death Records, 1700-1850 for Margret Packard, Bridgewater, New England Historical Genealogical Society; Boston, Massachusetts; Massachusetts Vitals to 1850, Image 639 [Page 279]; Massachusetts, U.S., Town and Vital Records, 1620-1988 for Margret Packerd, Bridgewater, Town Records, with Births, Marriages, and Deaths, Ancestry.com.

This is undoubtedly the case with female ancestors, something which can be “quite the challenge” to examine, as acknowledged by Family Tree magazine. Writing about such ancestors has even inspired some to follow their dreams or others to feel their weight. As for me, although I’m a cisgender White man, I am encouraged to tell these stories more on this blog. This post is part of telling some stories of my female ancestors, making Packed with Packards! more gender-balanced, talking about formidable, and non-formidable, ancestors, countering patriarchal bias, exploding myths, challenging stereotypes, and more that I first talked about on here in November 2019. It is also part of writing critical family history, which I discussed back in October 2021. In this post, which is part one of my series focusing on female ancestors, entitled “Lives of the Packard Women”. I’ll be focusing on my first cousins, including Eva, Bertha, Bessie, Laura, and beyond.\n\nThere are various first cousins I’d like to focus on. Some were married and others were unmarried. For the purpose of this post, and this section I will only be focusing on the women. There will not be any mention of their husbands, if they had them, nor any mentions of the names of men, as part of a way to gender balance this blog.\n\nMy first group of ancestors I’d like to focus on are four sisters who were all born in Clinton County, Missouri, seemingly all in Cameron: Eva L. Packard on August 10, 1876, Martha Elvira Packard on February 5, 1880, Elizabeth “Bessie” A. Packard on August 10, 1883, and Laura Dean Packard on September 23, 1886. All four are my first cousins four times removed, and were offspring of my progenitor’s brother and Araminta Utter, from the well-established Utter family, which had roots in Ohio and New Jersey. Two of them married and the other two did not.\n\nEva, the first born, never married. In fact, she is buried alongside her sister Martha in Packard Cemetery in Cameron, Missouri, with her sister dying ten years before her. By the age of 24, in 1900, she was going to school, and living with her family in Shoal, Missouri, where she had been living, almost since her birth. It is an area named after Shoal Creek, a stream that is a tributary of Grand River. Her younger sisters, Bessie and Laura, were also students as well, while Martha was working as a stenographer. [1]\n\nIn later years, Eva would move to Excelsior Springs and become a school principal, boarding with other female teachers. She would later move to Kansas City, where she taught as a math teacher from 1913 to 1944, using what she learned from her education from the University of Missouri, Colorado University, and Wisconsin, and be a member of the American Association of University Women and the historically White-majority “patriotic” organization, the DAR. Through all of this, she never married and was always noted by census enumerators as single. She would occasionally live with her sisters, parents, or cousins, as she did in 1920. [2]\n\nShe would even travel abroad to study, like in June 1922 to Southampton, England, or returning in August 1935. For the 1922 trip, she would apply for a passport, noting she was traveling for three months so she could study in Italy, France, Belgium, and many other places, such as Holland and Morocco. A teacher named Mary A. Miller, who had known Eva for five years, and lived at 107 North Lawn in Kansas City, Missouri, would testify on her behalf for the passport application. Her sister, Martha, would also vouch for her. A photograph, and her address at 4212 Windsor Ave. would be noted. [3]\n\nShe would later live with her sisters Martha and Bessie in Kansas City, with Bessie as a physician and Eva as a public school teacher. Eva would seemingly be retired by 1950, while Martha had possibly retired earlier, by 1940. She would die at age 90 on March 14, 1967 from a problem with her pancreas. [4]\n\nHer sister Martha would go a very different path. As noted earlier, in 1900, she was working as a stenographer. She would be rooming with 28-year-old Emma Walker, another stenographer, by 1910. She would become an assistant surveyor at a loan company by 1920, living with her parents, her sisters (Bessie and Eva), and a niece named Ruth Mary (my second cousin 3x removed). Ruth would be an associate fashion editor of the Ladies Home Journal for twenty years and later be a fashion writing instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. In 1930, it was no different, as she lived with her father, her married sister, Bessie, and a boarder. She would continue living with her sisters for the rest of her life, until her death on April 12, 1957 from hypostatic pneumonia, after being confined to bed for a year, with her information provided by her sister, Eva. [5] She would be unmarried like her sister Eva, and was member of a Christian church.\n\nOn January 28, 2024, Dina DuBois, a Packard descendant, provided some corrections, saying that the photograph I had associated with her from a yearbook in San Antonio, was incorrect, adding she “was born in San Antonio but graduated from high school in Kansas City before attending first Smith college and then the University of Missouri journalism school.” She also noted she had put her mother’s name in because she “wanted to see what it said about her in the 1920s in Greenwich Village” and my genealogy came up as a result. I’m glad to receive that correction, but wish it had been sent through the feedback on this site, rather than on my main personal WordPress.\n\nThis brings me to Bessie. At first, census takers would not record any occupation for her, implying she was a housewife just keeping house, and later as nothing after her husband died. She would later be noted as an osteopathic doctor/physician who worked into her 60s. [6] She would die on March 23, 1973 and be buried in San Antonio, Texas, even though she died in Phoenix, Arizona because her husband was buried there. Her obituary would note her graduation from the Kansas City of Osteopathy in 1920, after her husband’s death, memberships in a local church, and of the Women’s City Club.\n\nIt would be very different for the final sister, Laura. She would marry in her 20s, like her sister Bessie, in Cameron, Missouri. Census enumerators, predictably, never listed her with any occupation other than being implied as being a housewife who kept house, when she lived in Platte Township, Carroll Township, or elsewhere within Missouri. [7] They only noted the occupation of her husband as a farm manager, who narrowly pre-deceased her. Her obituary simply noted she had come to Phoenix 21 years earlier from Missouri, and said little more than this, giving even less information than her sisters, and much less than that of her husband in the same publication! She did not, interestingly, have any children, which is a bit unusual.\n\nThat brings me to Emma E. Packard who was born on March 3, 1870. She had five siblings, consisting of two sisters and three brothers. Her sister Etta Blanche Packard was born December 28, 1877, while her other sister, Susan Janet “Jennie” Packard, was born in on . All three are my first cousins 4x removed, and nieces of one of my progenitors. Born in Cameron to a father who ran a mill and mother, Ellanora G Vining, of the Vining family which was well-established in Western Massachusetts for years, she would be living with her sister Etta in Grand River, Missouri by 1880. By 1900, at the age of 30, she would be living with her father, and her siblings, including her sisters Etta and Susan, in Mansfield, Arkansas. In the years that followed, the census takers would never bother to outline an occupation for her, whether she was living in Sugarloaf, Arkansas in 1910 or Oklahoma City in 1920 and 1930. [8] Through it all, she never married and her sisters often lived with her. She would die in April 1934 and be buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Oklahoma City. Her obituary would explain why she hadn’t been listed with any occupations: she was physically disabled her entire life! Even so, it said she had a “sweet disposition” which caused to her to have many friends, and noted that her sister, Etta, cared for her after their parents died.\n\nEtta would be different. Born seven years after her sister, Emma, she would be a school teacher, first in Mansfield, Arkansas in the early 1900s, then in Oklahoma City by 1910. In the latter case, a fellow piano music teacher named Amanda O’Connor would be a lodger in the same house she was staying in. By 1920, she would again be listed as a teacher, still in Oklahoma City, with another teacher, named Lucy Bolton, as a roomer. Ten years later, in 1930, she would be noted as a public school teacher, and would be heading the household, which included boarders who were salespeople or lumber laborers. She would continue working as a teacher into her 60s, and would move to Cass, Missouri, by 1950, and be living with her brother. [9] She would die 26 years later on December 3, 1976 and be buried in Memorial Park Cemetery in Oklahoma City. Her obituary in The Daily Oklahoman would describe her 98 years of life:\n\nMiss Packard, a long time teacher and educator, died Friday in Fort Smith. She was a graduate of Kansas Slate University, Emporia, and of the University of Oklahoma. She first taught in Mansfield. Ark., in the 1890s. After teaching there and In Richmond Kan., she came to Oklahoma City before statehood and continued until she retired in 1944. She then moved to Missouri and returned to Arkansas in the 1950s. She was a Methodist and a life member of the Oklahoma Education Association and the Retired Teachers Association. She was former secretary of the Packard Association of America, Marion, Ohio.\n\nEmporia is a reference to Emporia State University, located in Emporia, Kansas. It has a teachers college, while Kansas Slate University pioneered the study of home economics for women, and University of Oklahoma currently has over 150 majors.\n\nIt would be fundamentally different for Susan. She would, first be living in Mansfield, Arkansas with her sisters and family, in 1900, and then in Wyanotte, Kansas, by 1905. After her marriage in 1907, census enumerators would never list her as having an occupation, clearly only seeing her as an appendage of her husband. She would have a few children with him, two of whom would be daughters: Olga Janet (b. 1911), and Helen Margaret (b. 1913). [10] Olga would marry first into the Coe family, then into the Hettrick family, having no children from her first marriage, and have at least two children from her second marriage before her death in 1985. Helen, on the other hand, would marry into the Harker family. By the time of her death, in 1970, she would have no children. She would be recorded, over the years, as an elementary school teacher in Healton, Oklahoma, much more than what her tombstone said: “devoted wife”. [11]\n\nSusan would unsurprisingly never be listed with an occupation by census takers, showing their patriarchal mindset. She would be said to be doing housework, and nothing more, no “occupation” in their minds. Those who compiled the census directories would say the same thing. By the time of her death on May 1, 1964 in Phoenix, her husband had pre-deceased her. She would die a widowed woman, never said to have any occupation by any of those recording her information. [12] She wold have an obituary in the Arizona Republic which said little more than noting her daughters, sister, grandchildren, and that she had moved to Phoenix in 1950. She would be buried in Greenwood Memory Lawn Cemetery in Phoenix.\n\nThat brings me to my 1st cousin 5x removed, Cornelia Lillie (1850-1932) and her five sisters, who are all my 1st cousins 5x removed: Vesta (1833-1877), Mary V. (1835-1909), Ellen P. (1836-1903), Rosamond (1841-1916), and Viola Susan (1847-1919). She would also have four brothers, but they are not the focus of this post. Her father, my 4th great-granduncle, is the son of one of my progenitors. Her mother, Susan Bird (1809-1890), hailed from the Bird family, which had roots in Windsor, Massachusetts, and the Snow family. The latter was the family of Susan’s mother, Susannah Snow (1789-1843), who was born in Cummington.\n\nCornelia would be the last born of these sisters. She would marry into the Bliss family at the young age of 19 in October 1869. She would have four children, including two daughters: Coral Blackwell (1870-1955) and Jessie Viola (1872-1938). Predictably, census takers would list no occupation for her, as they have done for other women I’ve noted in this article. She would likely anchor the household and care for her children as they lived in Racine, Wisconsin, over the years. [13] In February 1896, her husband wold die. She wold live for another 36 years without him. She would first petition the court alongside her children, noting the personal property he left behind which was worth $1700, that he wrote no will, and that they paid $300 a year to rent the homestead in which they lived. It is a unique time where we can see her speak, while also noting the land in which they occupied in Racine and the appraisal of the property in which was owned as part of the estate calculations. It notes the payments and that by the end of the estate settlement in May 1897, she gained rights to the homestead, while her children got rights to the other tracts of land. By 1900 she would be living on the homestead with her two sons, with the census taker describing her as a “capitalist” who owned a farm, who could read, write, and speak English. [14] Whether she described herself personally that way or the census enumerator came up with that, I do not know. Doing a search akin to the one that Stuart Blandon Traiman did for the word “partner”, using the tool put together by Steven Morse:\n\nPeople described as “capitalist” by census year*\n\nYear Number of people Link 1900 54,775 Ancestry.com Record search 1910 2341 Ancestry.com Record search 1920 1243 Ancestry.com Record search 1930 738 Ancestry.com Record search 1940 173 Ancestry.com Record search 1950 13 Ancestry.com Record search\n\n*For 1930 and 1950, the “occupation field” can’t be searched, so this is just a rough calculation using the “keyword” field.\n\nThis topic has been discussed on genealogy forums before, and a person pointed to one definition: “investor, providing capital for commerce” while another pointed to the definition as an investor who “provided private capital or wealth for the production and distribution of goods.” Census enumerators were told to list, according to one appendix, those people (mostly men) who receive their “income, or most of it, from money loaned at interest, or from stocks, bonds, or other securities”. This is different than how it is defined in radical terms, by Marxists, as a person who uses the labor power of workers, measuring their profit made producing a given commodity in “proportion to the total capital invested”, but must keep up with changing technology, while profiting off extra labor of workers in the process.\n\nIn later years, she would continue living at the homestead at 724 Lake Avenue in Racine, and would be described as an employer in the hardware thinner industry. She would be listed as with her son in Milwaukee in 1910, but back in Racine in 1914, implying that she was only visiting her son for a short time, not permanently living there. By 1920, she would be rooming in Racine, and said to have no occupation, with the same in 1930, when she was living in the household headed by her daughter Cora, and her daughter’s children (Jocelyn), and granddaughters (Helen K., Patricia A., and Helen K. II). [15] She would die on February 20, 1932 at the home of her daughter, Cora, and be buried in Mound Cemetery, having her own headstone, not sharing one with her late husband, interestingly enough. Her obituary in The Journal Times on March 1, 1932, some days after she died, would describe her life:\n\n…Mrs. Cornelia Packard…died yesterday morning at the home of her daughter…[Cornelia] resided in this city for about 75 years. She was born in the city of Burlington Aug. 31, 1850, being the youngest of 10 children born to Roswell D. and Susan Bird Packard, being also the last survivor of that family. She was but a few years old when her parents brought her to Racine and established a home here. She lived here continuously since that time. While she was still in her last year in the Racine high school, she was chosen by CoI. John G. McMynn to teach in the Fourth Ward school, now the Janes, which position she held up to the time of her marriage…Surviving are three children…six grandchildren and four great 1 grandchildren.\n\nHer sisters Vesta, Mary V, Ellen P, Rosamond, and Viola Susan were different. Viola, born On March 12, 1868 in Timberville, Ohio, would marry at the age of 21 into the Morley family, which had its roots in Vermont, to a man who was a Civil War Veteran and a Mason. By 1870, she would be living with her husband, parents, and brother in Racine. Census enumerators would only describe her as a “house keeper” while she lived with her children, which included a daughter named Edith Viola (1871-1936), in Racine. By 1910, she would be widowed, living in Racine, with her daughter Edith, who was working as a school teacher and a 18-year-old servant from Wisconsin of German heritage named Lillian Marten. She would live out her last nine years in Racine and die on Mackinac Island on September 18, 1919 from a heart attack building on past disease. [16] She would be buried in Mound Cemetery in Racine.\n\nHer daughter, Edith, had an interesting life. She would live her early years in Racine and go to school there. She would become a school teacher in Racine, at the Garfield School, often living with her mother, siblings, and rooming with others in the area, while she lived in the city. [17] She would die on March 13, 1936 from an unnamed illness and share a headstone with her mother in Mound Cemetery. Her obituary in The Journal Times would explain her contribution to Racine, and talk about her life:\n\nA kindergarten teacher in Racine public schools for the last 45 years, Miss Edith Viola I Morey, 63, died Friday night at her home, 1335 S. Wisconsin street. Miss Morey was born in Racine Nov. 24, 1872. After attending public schools here, she went to a kindergarten college in Chicago, and following graduation she was given a position at the Lincoln school here. From the Lincoln, she was transferred to the Garfield, Winslow and Washington schools…and up to the time of her illness she was at the Washington. Racine was always her home…She was a member of St Luke’s Episcopal church, charter member of the Order of Eastern Star, and a member of the D. A. R.\n\nIt would make her the fifth teacher I’m related to who has been featured in this post so far! The others are Eva L., Emma, Etta B., and Susan. There are a few teachers I’m not related to who are also featured, like Mary A. Miller, who was a friend of Eva L., and Lucy Bolton and Amanda O’Connor who lodged / boarded with Etta B. in Oklahoma City in 1910 and 1920 respectfully. It is interesting she would be a member of a historically white organization like the DAR, similar to Eva, despite the fact the organization was racially exclusive, and discouraged Black members for many years, which it has been pressured to accept due to more action from Black citizens. As for Order of the Eastern Star, it is a Masonic body for men and women which was established in 1850.\n\nI’d still like to focus on the four remaining women, specifically Vesta, Mary V, Ellen P., and Rosamond. Vesta would only live 44 years. During her short lifespan, she would marry into the Porter family at age 20 in Racine, and stay married to him for three years until his reported death in 1856, as claimed by family trees on Ancestry. He could be the same as the person of a same name killed in 1859 reportedly by indigenous people. By 1860, she would be working as a seamstress, with her two children in the household. This would continue in 1870, when she was noted as a dress maker. [18] She would die on October 17, 1877, and be buried in Racine’s Mound Cemetery.\n\nVesta is not to be confused with her sister, Mary Vesta. She was born on February 11, 1835 in Plainfield. She would live in Racine with her sisters, brothers, and parents in Racine, and would move to Alma, another town in Wisconsin, after marrying into the Prindle family, which was rooted in New York and Connecticut. By 1880, Mary would be living in Alma with her husband and her children, which included a daughter named Ellen, who is also known as Mary Ella. [19] In 1899, Mary’s husband would die.from a strangulated hernia. The following year, she would be living with her two sons in Alma, and would be noted as a farmer. The same would be noted in 1905, with another Prindle family nearby. [20] Mary would die nine years later and pass on August 31, 1909. She likely missed her kind, intelligent, and loving mother, as an obituary in The Journal Times described her in July 1890.\n\nBefore moving onto Mary’s sisters, Ellen P. and Rosamond, I’d like to talk about Mary’s daughter, Mary Ella, who is my second cousin 4x removed. She married at the age of 20 into the Comstock family. Born on December 18, 1864 in Meridan, Wisconsin, She had previously attended school and lived in Alma, Wisconsin. By 1900, she had born two sons with her husband, both of whom were attending school. [21] As the years went on, census takers would call her a “house keeper” and nothing more, while her sons, and husband were noted as farmers.\n\nHer husband would die in November 1919, leaving her widowed by 1920, when she was living with her son, his wife Lela E. Steele (1892-1969), his son, and his daughter Vesta (1919-2013) in Alma, Wisconsin. Vesta would have three daughters Patricia J., Mary L., and Betsy. By 1930, Mary Ella would be a practical nurse who did private laundry, while in 1940 she listed by census enumerators with no occupation, in 1950 as living with her mother-in-law, Ella M. [22] She would die on December 14, 1956 and be buried in Merrillan’s Oakwood Cemetery. Her obituary in The La Cross Tribune would describe her as one of the earliest residents of Jackson County, Wisconsin, while noting that her father established one of the area’s first fruit farms, while her mother (Mary Vesta) was noted as a teacher. She would be noted as running a hardware store in Merridan and later as a practical nurse, with the latter noted in the 1930 census.\n\nWith that addressed, I’d like to move back to Mary’s sisters, Ellen P. and Rosamond. I’ll start with Ellen P. who was born on October 18, 1836 in Chatham, Ohio. She would live her early life in Racine, Wisconsin, and be working as a teacher. She would, at the age of 34, in 1870, marry into the Wait family. At the time, he had two daughters from a previous marriage with with Maria Louisa Coburn: Ida Rowena (1859-1876) and Cora Louise Whittier (1867-1937). She would soon be noted as keeping house, and Ida and Cora would almost become like her children. [23] She would also have a birth daughter of her own, Minnie Belle (1871-1961). Minnie would marry into the Nicholson family. She would have one son, and one daughter, the latter named Mary Eleanor (1916-2000). Mary would marry into the Dorman family, having one son, and a daughter named Nancy D., before her death in January 2000.\n\nEllen P. would continue living in Traverse City with her daughters, sons, and husband. This would continue until her death on May 9, 1903. She would often be living with female servants in the household, along with her family. For instance, in 1880, a 17-year-old servant named Jenny Denster, from Michigan, was said to be engaged in housework, while in 1900, a 19-year-old German servant named Fannie Kneblenski was in the household. In the case of the latter, she had been in the U.S. for 15 years, immigrating at the age of four from Germany. Ellen P., in her death certificate, would simply be described as a “druggist’s wife”, having no occupation in the minds of the examiners except that tied to her husband. [24]\n\nLast but not least is Rosamond. She was born on September 28, 1841 in Chatham, Ohio. She would live her early life in Racine, Wisconsin, working as a school teacher like her sister Ellen P. She would marry into the Fish family sometime before 1870, when her first son was born, and continue to live in Racine. [25] She would have three children, including a daughter named Jessie Ethel (1872-1859), who would marry into the LeClair family, and another named Nellie, who would, as family lore states, live only from 1865 to 1868. As for Rosamond, her husband would die in December 1899, leaving her widowed. One of his obituaries would not even mention her. However, his will would do so, in which he gave Jessie five shares of stock in his company, and the remainder of his property, which he hadn’t distributed to Jessie or his son, to Rosamond, who he also appointed as executrix of his his estate. [26] Another obituary would just call her “a wife” and not name her, nor any of the children. In January 1900 she would ask for a probate of the will, with her children signing a petition to that effect at one point. The court would rule in her favor on January 15, 1900, stating that the will is valid and reaffirming her as executrix. [27]\n\nRosamond would continue living in Racine until the late 1900s, when she would move to Lewiston, Idaho, living at 701 6th Avenue. By 1910, she would be living with her daughter Jessie and her family. [28] She would die on August 18, 1916 and be buried in Racine’s Mound Cemetery with her own tombstone. Jessie would be executor of her estate, and Rosamond would die at her home. At the time of her death, she had an estate of $4,000, and has property from her marriage. In her will, she would give Jessie’s husband $1,000 but give Jessie the homestead she was living in, along with furniture, personal effects, and a sum of $15,000, and set up a trust fund for her, as mentioned in a will which was written four years before her death. [29]\n\nDespite this generous contribution in the will, census takers would not list her with any occupation, only doing so for her husband and her children, and the various lodgers living with her, and her family, in 1920. This included a 30-year-old lodger from Bohemia named Anna Kazda, and two teachers named Helen A. Dolan and Margaret A. David. This would change by 1930, when Jessie had moved to Seattle and was living with two of her sons. She had moved back to Lewiston, Idaho in 1940, was living with another of her sons. He would marry Mary Margaret Rosebaugh (1910-1990), a few years later. By 1950, Jessie was living by herself, and still in Lewiston, only noting that she owned something and rented property. [30] She would die on August 17, 1959 in Seattle and be buried in Idaho’s Normal Hill Cemetery. Her obituary would not her as a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and a local church, and point out that she lived her last seven years in Seattle, but in Lewiston from 1904 to 1952.\n\nWith that, I move onto another group of Packard women. First of them is Ada A. Packard, my first cousin 6x removed. Only living for fourteen years, she was the daughter of my fifth great-granduncle and Mariah P. Compton (1804-1859). She lived in Lenawee County, Michigan. She was buried at Hunt Cemetery in Michigan. [31] She had nine siblings. Of those, she had three sisters: Nancy Jane (1831-1911), Sarah Ford (1834-1914), and Emeline “Emma” Baldwin (1840-1916). All are my first cousins 6x removed, so I’ll talk about each one. Some family trees had floated other sisters, like Amanda M, Sarah B., or Adaline C., but they could not be confirmed as correct.\n\nLet me start with Nancy Jane. She was born on August 31, 1831 in Michigan. Based on where her father was living in 1840, in Fairfield, Michigan, she was undoubtedly with him, and continued to live there until she was first recorded in the census in 1850. By then, the family had moved to Center, Indiana. Nine years later, she would marry into the Thompson family. [32] She would have eight children, including two daughters: Allie Mae (1864-1950) and Emma (1865-1946). Allie would marry three times. First she would marry into the Tall family, until her husband’s death in 1907, while only 56 years old. Then, she would marry into the Spencer family, before her second husband died in January 1910. Finally, she would marry into the Lane family in September 1910. She would be with him until his death in September 1956. Interestingly, she only had children with her second husband, not any of her others, while she lived in Michigan, then Toledo, Ohio, for much of her life. This would include one son, and five daughters: Maude Emma (1885-1957), Mabel Claire (b. 1887), Nellie Hazel (1889), Gladys (1891-1951), and Alice Araminta (1901-1988). The latter married to at least four men during her lifetime, the first of whom, from the Cooper family, she divorced due to extreme cruelty. Nancy’s third husband may have seen her daughters from her second marriage as his own, just as much as she saw them as her flesh and blood. [33] Nancy would die on June 26, 1950, and be buried in Ohio’s Toledo Memorial Park.\n\nSarah Ford and Emeline Baldwin would be different. Sarah was born on September 10, 1834 in Fairfield, Michigan. She would marry three times, once into the Linfield family (in 1851), another into the Gestwright family (bef. 1870), and also into the Parker family (bef. 1880). Through these marriages she would bear five children, including two daughters: Nettie K. Gestwright (b. 1859) and Ella Parker (1853-1889). She would live in Michigan from the 1850s to the 1870s, in Indiana in the 1880s, then again in Michigan in the 1900s until his death on July 6, 1914. [34] Her death certificate, as noted on her online memorial, does not name her parents but says she is a nurse.\n\nThen we get to Emeline “Emma” Baldwin. She lived in Fairfield, Michigan in her early life, married first into the Carpenter family, then into the Tuttle family, until her second husband died in 1870. She would work as a seamstress, living in Gilroy, California by 1880, and marry into the McClure family last. She would be living by herself in 1900 and said to be a “house keeper”. This was somewhat explained by the 1910 census which noted that she was divorced, something I’ve never seen in a census document. [35] She would die on December 15, 1916 and be buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Her online memorial, written by Merrilly Lawson, adds more about her life:\n\n…No evidence was found to substantiate the dissolution of the Carpenter marriage. Why was Emma in Calif in Oct 1867 to marry [into the Tuttle family] and why did she return to Michigan to give birth to Mattie Belle, only to return to California where she remained until her death. I learned that [her first husband]…relocated to Iowa, remarried and had a second family and never, ever spoke of his first marriage…[her marriage to] McClure…ended in a divorce. According to a granddaughter, Emma left Michigan with her 3 daughters and “sailed around the tip of South America to California.” After her arrival in Gilroy in 1869, she had a home built for her family. The home is on the historical register but is not open to the public. It is almost certain she had inherited sufficient funds from her father’s estate after his death enabling her to make the long trip and eventually have a home built.\n\nTen years later, in 1880, Florence would re-appear, living in the household of her widowed mother Almera (whose husband had died in February 1876) and her brother. Census enumerators would only say she was “at home” and not specify what that meant. When her father had died in 1876, she had got $200.00 from her father, along with the “provisons and privileges” of a home, while Almera was granted, and bequeathed, his real estate. In later years, Florence would live with her farmer brother in Worthington, and then in Northampton until her death in February 1929. [40]\n\nFrom his will I learned about another of Almera’s daughters: Julia A. (who got 25 dollars from her father), who was born on December 16, 1835, and married into the Reed family in January 1856. She would have eight children, including Julia Amelia (1865-1922), Mary Isabelle (1873-1955), and Helen (1873-1962). Julia A. would live in Cummington and be noted as keeping house in 1880, while many of her children would go to school. She would die from complications of tuberculosis on April 13, 1900. [41] By time of her death, she had no granddaughters, as Julia Amelia never had children, nor did Helen, as she never married. However if she had lived, she may have met the five daughters of Mary Isabelle, specifically Rena (b. 1904), Rachel (b. 1906), Geraldine (b. 1907), Thelma G. (b. 1911), and Janice (1916-1994).\n\nAs for Almera, she would die at the age of 74, on September 28, 1884, and be buried in Worthington. Her death record would note that she died from old age, nothing more, nothing less. [42] By the time of her death, in 1884, two of her sisters were living: Selina Fobes (would die in 1891) and Jane Augusta (would die in 1888). One sister, Roxanna, died in 1869. I’d like to focus on Roxanna here, briefly. At the age of 32, in 1832, she married into the Lyman family. She would have five children, including two daughters: Agnes Susan (1834-1892) and Flora Jane (1840-1905). Until her death, she would be living in Cummington with her husband and her children. She would die in Amherst of heart disease. [43] Agnes would go on to live in Cummington, marrying into the Tower family until her death in 1892, having one daughter named Edith (1858-1894). Roxanna’s other daughter, Flora, would marry into the Streeter family. She would have no daughters, only two sons. Flora would die, on May 23, 1905, of chronic periodontitis and anemia, exacerbated by an abscess in the liver, in Plainfield. [44]\n\nSelina Fobes and Jane Augusta were different. Selina would marry into the Sennett family at the age of 24, in April 1843. She would have three sons. Over the years, she would live in towns of Massachusetts like Cummington (in the early 1850s), Worthington (late 1850s and early 1860s), and Peru (late 1860s to 1891). [45] Never once was she listed with an occupation by census enumerators other than saying she “keeps house”. Only once, in 1880, would a woman, other than herself be living in the house: a daughter-in-law named Jennie Ellen Holden (b. 1859), a wife of one of her sons. Selina would die at the age of 72 on April 15, 1891 in Peru, Massachusetts. Her death record would say she died from paralysis and describe her as a housewife. [46]\n\nThat brings me to the last one of Almera’s sisters: Jane Augusta. Born on September 19, 1822, in Cummington, she married into the Bates family at the age of 20. Like her grandniece, Julia Amelia Reed (1864-1922), a daughter of one of Almera’s daughters (Julia A. Sampson), she never had any children. Jane would live her entire life in Worthington. In 1850, a 16-year-old farmer named Milton Brewster was in the household, but his relation (if any) is unknown, while another Bates family was nearby. By 1855, Milton was still in the household, as was another man, William Reed. They were living next door to a household where Almera was living! There were many other Bates families nearby, curiously enough. [47]\n\nBy 1860, the situation had somewhat changed, even though they were still in Worthington. William and Milton were not living in the household. A mechanic named Nelson Cook was living in the household, and Almera was living nearby, along with a Packard man and his wife, Mary. Families of Almera and Jane were living next to one each other in 1865, along with others with last name of Bates in the household, with their relation not known at this time. In 1870 it would be little different, as Almera’s family was nearby, along with another Bates family, while Jane was noted as “keeping house”. The same could be found in the 1880 census, noting Almera’s family, consisting of a now-widowed Almera and her two sons, was next-door, and another Bates family was curiously nearby, while census enumerators said Jane did “house keeping”. [48]\n\nThings would change in March 1887. On the 18th day of that month, Jane’s husband would die and would be buried at Worthington’s North Cemetery. She would, on November 30, 1888, she wrote her last will and testament, saying she did so because of the “uncertainty” of her life, i.e. that she may die soon. This is unique as many women did not write one. She mentioned two Bates family members, with their relation not currently known, and bequeathing her gold watch and chain to a Katie B. Fields, then all her note, bonds, and balance of her bank accounts to her nieces Julia A. Sampson (daughter of Almera), Florence A. Sampson (daughter of Almera), nephew, and others. She would also give her household goods, her personal property, to Florence. Sure enough, on December 12, she would die, and be buried in Worthington. Her death record notes she died of an unknown cause. [50] While the death record describes her as a “housewife”, I wonder whether the marriage she had with her husband was a marriage of convenience, i.e. a marriage/union/cooperation entered into for political, social, pragmatic, or economic advantage instead of for “mutual affection”. There are no indications the marriage was a sham, nor enough evidence if it was a lavender marriage. The latter refers to when gay people marry someone of the opposite sex to “give the appearance of being straight”. It can refer to a marriage to mask sexual orientation of “one or both partners”. Proving that can be tough.\n\nThere are some other first cousins I’d like to focus on. Let me start with Clarissa, the daughter of Ruth Nash. She was born in February 1817 and grew up in Vermont. In January 1845, at the age of 27, she married a man who was 22 years older than her! He had been previously married to a woman named Laura Hard, who died in 1843. The 1850 census states that her husband, his two presumed brothers were farmers in Underhill, Chittenden, Vermont. While no occupation is listed for her, she likely was “keeping house”, but also could have been helping on the farm. It also stated that she had one child: Clara, who was born in October 1845. Sadly, Clara died at age 12, for causes not yet known. Even worse was the fact that Clarrissa had to live with two children, seemingly born during her husband’s previous marriage. She also had one other son living with her in 1850, who was born the same year. [51]\n\nBy 1860, there had been changes. Her husband was now a shoemaker, and the Brown family was living in the same household, as were some others. Only ten years after that, she was living alone with her husband, in the same place in Vermont as previous years, and her husband had the same profession. She would die in April 1880 at the age of 63 years and two months. Before her death, she received items from her husband’s will, written in November 1858, as her husband died in 1875, including all his household furniture, clothing, and bedding, along with his personal property, and some of his land. Other allocations were given to her sons. [52]\n\nThat brings me to six other first cousins, some many times removed: Joanna Packard, Bettie Packard, Alice Cornelia Packard, Cynthia Cordelia Packard, Mary Polly Packard, and Betsey M. Packard. The first of these, Joanna, was reportedly born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, to Susanna Kingman in November 1725. She would marry at age 19 into the Allen family. She would have three children, including one boy, and two girls: Martha (1748-1816) and Molly (1755-1800), who would marry into the Niles and Washburn families respectfully. She would die in November 1787 and be buried in East Brid"
