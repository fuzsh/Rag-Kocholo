        "text": "Cary Grant's life:\n\n1904, Birth in Bristol\n\nCary Grant was born in Horfield, Bristol, a city in South West England, and started performing with a troupe named \"Penders\" since age six.\n\n1920s: From Vaudeville to Broadway\n\nAt age of 14, Cary Grant was expelled from school and rejoined \"Penders\" troupe, thus starting his vaudeville years. In 1921, while on tour with the troupe to USA, he decided to stay in New York with a few other performers.\n\nIn the next 10 year, Cary Grant performed with different companies in variety shows as well as musicals, and it was one of the musicals Nikki that got him his first screen test.\n\n1930s: Journey to Hollywood\n\n1931: Becoming Cary Grant\n\n​\n\nOn December 7, 1931, Cary Grant signed his first Hollywood contract, with Paramount Pictures general manager B.P. Schulberg. Soon afterwards, Cary Grant was requested to change his name from Archibald Leach.
