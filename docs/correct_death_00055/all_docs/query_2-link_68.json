        "text": "Cary Grant’s only child has addressed long-standing rumours of his sexuality, shutting down ideas that he was gay.\n\nBorn in Bristol before eventually moving to Hollywood and becoming one of the greatest stars of the Golden Age for his roles in films including His Girl Friday, To Catch a Thief, and North by Northwest, Grant died aged 82 in 1986.\n\nFor decades it has been rumoured that like several of his contemporaries, including Rock Hudson, Grant might have also been gay.\n\nHowever, his daughter Jennifer, herself an actress, has now shared her thoughts ahead of the release of the ITV drama Archie, which tells the life story of Grant, who was born Archibald Alec Leach.\n\nReferencing her father’s style, which she defined as ‘elegant masculinity’, Jennifer believes that was a factor that threw people off.\n\n‘If you’re around your parents a lot, you see them in ways that almost no one else does,’ she explained.\n\n‘And I never saw a hint of that. I think I would have picked up on it – not that I would’ve cared.\n\n‘But I have to speak the truth of the matter: Dad was charming, and he had great friendships, but he wasn’t flirtatious with men,’ she added when speaking to The Guardian.\n\nShe added: ‘A friend of mine sent me a picture the other day of Gregory Peck, my father and Mervyn LeRoy and they’re good buddies. But I never got that hint. Perhaps earlier in his life he had an affair [with a man]. I’ll never know, but if he did, fantastic. I hope he enjoyed it.”\n\nIt’s a subject Jennifer previously addressed in her 2011 memoir, Good Stuff: A Reminiscence of My Father, Cary Grant, which detailed her relationship with her father, who was 62 when she was born and who died 20 years later.\n\nWhen she pushed back against the gossip about her father’s sexuality in her memoir, Jennifer said she received hate mail saying she was ‘anti-gay, which couldn’t be further from the truth’.\n\nThe drama series based on Grant’s life was announced last year, with Jason Isaacs set to star as the Hollywood great.\n\nTold over four episodes, it will follow the actor as he embraces America and transforms into one of film’s most recognisable leading men.\n\nIsaacs previously said he would ‘never be foolish enough to try to step into his iconic shoes’, but when it came to Archie Leach, he ‘couldn’t be further from the character he invented to save himself’.\n\nArchie will air on ITV.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : ‘In the 80s I was told an openly gay man like me couldn’t front the news’"
