        "text": "In this comprehensive composition about famous people who died of AIDS, the common thread is both heartrending and illuminating. This list comprises notable individuals from various professional fields like music, film, fashion, and literature, who faced the devastating finality of AIDS in the prime of their lives. The choice to feature these luminaries springs from our desire to shed a more personal and humane light on this ruthless epidemic that has claimed many lives, reminding the world that it spares no one, not even the brightest stars.\n\nFreddie Mercury, iconic frontman of Queen, with his larger-than-life stage persona and enigmatic songs, is a name impossible to omit when discussing celebrities who battled AIDS. Another renowned artist was Keith Haring, whose sharp-lined, vibrant-coloured graffiti made him a mainstay of 1980s New York street culture. Liberace, the flamboyant piano entertainer, and Rock Hudson, Hollywood's leading man in the '50s and '60s, also experienced firings from AIDS, as did Rudolf Nureyev, a ballet icon spotting his way into history with defiant leaps. Indeed, this list cannot be complete without the British fashion designer and couturier, Leigh Bowery. From well-known actors and singers to lesser known celebs, each of these individuals left their mark in their respective fields, their struggles with AIDS manifesting different aspects of their strength and vulnerability.\n\nWhile death from AIDS is largely shared in their stories, the chronicle of their lives before and after diagnosis is vastly different. Their professional accomplishments, personal journey, community contributions, and ultimately the impact of their loss vary significantly. This article aims to delve into these variations, offering a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and the global AIDS issue.\n\nIn conclusion, we invite our readers on this significant journey. Gain a deeper insight into the lives of these icons who fell before the might of AIDS. Perhaps their stories might help inspire further actions, research, treatment breakthroughs, and policy changes to combat this globally pervasive health issue. More importantly, we hope that their stories will continue to humanize the face of AIDS, fostering empathy and understanding in addressing a condition that has affected so many lives.\n\nRanked by\n\nDec. at 45 (1946-1991)\n\nBirthplace : Zanzibar City, Tanzania\n\nProfession : Record producer, Pianist, Musician, Singer-songwriter, Singer\n\nCredits : Metropolis, Ted, Shaun of the Dead, Moulin Rouge!\n\nBorn as Farrokh Bulsara in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, Freddie Mercury is globally celebrated for his exceptional talent and charisma. He moved to England at a young age where he studied art and design at Ealing Art College, London. This education would later influence many of Queen's album covers that he designed himself. In 1970, Mercury teamed up with Brian May and Roger Taylor to form the rock band Queen, which soon became an international sensation. Mercury's distinctive voice had a remarkable range that spanned over four octaves. His flamboyant stage presence and powerful vocals made him one of the most beloved entertainers in rock music history. As the primary lyricist for Queen, Mercury penned numerous hits including \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Somebody to Love\", and \"We Are The Champions\". These songs not only topped charts during their time but continue to be classics even today. Despite his early demise due to complications from AIDS at the age of 45 in 1991, Mercury remains an iconic figure in popular culture. His life was immortalized on screen through the biopic Bohemian Rhapsody which won multiple awards worldwide. Today Freddie Mercury continues to inspire millions with his music legacy - a testament to his unparalleled contribution as a musician, performer and cultural icon.\n\nDec. at 59 (1925-1985)\n\nBirthplace : Winnetka, Illinois, USA\n\nProfession : Actor\n\nCredits : Giant, Pillow Talk, Send Me No Flowers, McMillan & Wife\n\nRock Hudson, born as Roy Harold Scherer Jr. in Winnetka, Illinois on November 17, 1925, was one of the most popular and well-known American actors of his time. He began his acting career in Hollywood in the late 1940s after serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Despite facing initial rejections due to his inexperience, Hudson's persistence eventually led him to Universal Pictures where he was given a new name and image, thus beginning the transformation into the charming leading man known and loved by audiences worldwide. Hudson's breakthrough role came in the 1954 film, Magnificent Obsession, which established him as a romantic lead. His performance in Giant (1956), alongside Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, cementing his status among Hollywood's elite. Throughout the 1960s, Hudson continued his success with a series of romantic comedies with Doris Day, including hits like \"Pillow Talk\" (1959) and \"Lover Come Back\" (1961). These films showcased his comedic timing and versatility as an actor, further expanding his appeal. Off-screen, Hudson's life was marked by personal struggles and secrecy. In a time when homosexuality was stigmatized and concealed, Hudson was forced to hide his sexual orientation. It wasn't until near the end of his life that he publicly acknowledged being gay, becoming one of the first major celebrities to do so. His subsequent battle with AIDS and his decision to disclose his diagnosis brought much-needed attention to the disease. Rock Hudson passed away on October 2, 1985, leaving behind a legacy of iconic performances and a significant impact on the visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in Hollywood.\n\nDec. at 26 (1960-1986)\n\nBirthplace : Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nProfession : Fashion Model, Model, Supermodel\n\nGia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960 â€“ November 18, 1986) was an American model during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Considered by some to be the first supermodel, she was featured on the cover of fashion magazines, including multiple editions of Vogue and Cosmopolitan, and appeared in advertising campaigns for such fashion houses as Armani, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent.After she became addicted to heroin, Carangi's modeling career rapidly declined. She died of AIDS-related complications at the age of 26, becoming one of the first famous women to die of the disease. Her life was dramatized in the television film Gia, starring Angelina Jolie, which debuted on HBO in 1998.\n\nDec. at 72 (1920-1992)\n\nBirthplace : Petrovichi, Russia\n\nProfession : Biochemist, Historian, Novelist, Author, Essayist\n\nCredits : Bicentennial Man, I, Robot, Gandahar, Nightfall\n\nIsaac Asimov (; c. January 2, 1920 â€“ April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification.Asimov wrote hard science fiction. Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the \"Foundation\" series, the first three books of which won the one-time Hugo Award for \"Best All-Time Series\" in 1966. His other major series are the \"Galactic Empire\" series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with Foundation and Earth (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"future history\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He also wrote hundreds of short stories, including the social science fiction novelette \"Nightfall\", which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery. He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, history, biblical exegesis, and literary criticism. He was president of the American Humanist Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars, a Brooklyn elementary school, and a literary award are named in his honor.\n\nDec. at 57 (1926-1984)\n\nBirthplace : Poitiers, France\n\nProfession : Sociologist, Writer, Philosopher\n\nPaul-Michel Foucault (UK: FOO-koh, US: foo-KOH, French: [pÉ”l miÊƒÉ›l fuko]; 15 October 1926 â€“ 25 June 1984), generally known as Michel Foucault, was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, social theorist, and literary critic. Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, and critical theory. Activist groups have also found his theories compelling.Born in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the LycÃ©e Henri-IV, at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, The History of Madness (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced The Birth of the Clinic (1963) and The Order of Things (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology\". From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the CollÃ¨ge de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society. Foucault died in Paris of HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory.\n\nDec. at 67 (1919-1987)\n\nBirthplace : USA, Wisconsin, West Allis\n\nProfession : Pianist, Actor, Singer\n\nCredits : Another World, Misery, Ocean's Eleven, Liberace: A Valentine Special\n\nWÅ‚adziu Valentino Liberace (May 16, 1919 â€“ February 4, 1987) was an American pianist, singer and actor. A child prodigy born in Wisconsin to parents of Italian and Polish origin, Liberace enjoyed a career spanning four decades of concerts, recordings, television, motion pictures, and endorsements. At the height of his fame, from the 1950s to the 1970s, Liberace was the highest-paid entertainer in the world, with established concert residencies in Las Vegas, and an international touring schedule. Liberace embraced a lifestyle of flamboyant excess both on and off stage, acquiring the nickname \"Mr. Showmanship\"."
