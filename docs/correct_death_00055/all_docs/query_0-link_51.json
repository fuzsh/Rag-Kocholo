        "text": "​A special little monument depicting a child praying recently introduced me to an equally interesting man named William L. W. Seabrook. The Seabrooks are buried not far from the entrance of the cemetery in Area A, within plain sight of the Francis Scott Key Monument in one direction, and the aptly named Key Memorial Chapel in another. Here also, the visitor will find Mrs. Harriet Philipina (Thomas) Seabrook buried along with five additional young children who died rather young between the years of 1863 through 1872. The fore-mentioned child figure monument marks the grave of an infant simply known in our records as L.S. I’ve deduced this to denote the name of Luther Stanley. Four siblings of L. S. can be found in separate graves—all sharing a central miniature obelisk.\n\n​Interestingly, the least appealing grave monument in this plot belongs to the family patriarch and original purchaser (of the cemetery ground). His name was William L. W. Seabrook and his life story and accomplishments are very impressive. Seabrook's obituary in the Frederick News, American Sentinel, Baltimore Sun and Gettysburg Times and several other regional papers in September 1916 reads as a well-crafted biography. I will include that here later, thinking perhaps that this man, himself, could have been responsible for writing it as he made his mark as a long-time newspaper editor.\n\nColumbia Democrat (Oct. 6 1838)\n\n​The Gettysburg Railroad line which Mr. Seabrook was building was also known as “Tapeworm Railroad.” It had been planned by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who began his law career in Gettysburg. The transportation line was given this odd nickname by opponents who ridiculed its planned lengthy serpentine layout (of switchbacks) connecting several forges and furnaces. One of these was owned by Mr. Stevens himself and called Maria Furnace. Its ancient remains can still be found around the Green Ridge of South Mountain.\n\nThis very early railroad, not to mention its connections to Thaddeus Stevens, intrigued me. In 1836, a man named Herman Haupt had surveyed the \"road from Gettysburg across South Mountain to the Potomac\" and in 1838, the rail \"bed\" was \"graded for a number of miles, but never got further than Monterey.” No train ever traveled on \"the Tapeworm,\" and no rails were ever laid but the route was surveyed and graded in Adams County.\n\nThe right-of-way was later used by the Susquehanna, Gettysburg and Potomac Railway and its successor, the Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway to build a line from Gettysburg west to Highfield, Maryland. Some may recognize a highly visible part of this line on the northwest portion of the Gettysburg Battlefield property at McPherson Ridge with its memorable railway cut through surrounding reddish-brown sandstone. Heavy fighting during the battle took place here, and also around the Seminary Ridge railway cut, on July 1st, 1863.\n\nThe railroad and cut at McPherson Ridge (Gettysburg) shortly after the time of the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 (above). At the time of the battle, no rails had been laid. Current day view of the railroad (below).\n\n​As for Thaddeus Stevens (1792 – 1868), he was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, being one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the freedmen. He was a fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against black Americans, and sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, leading the opposition to U.S. President Andrew Johnson.\n\n​I found this fascinating as our subject, and his father, were acquainted with this man, especially considering their respective ties to Gettysburg and the Republican Party as you will soon learn. William L. W. Seabrook would also have a strong connection to another Republican politician with indelible ties to Stevens, the abolition of slavery, and Gettysburg—Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThaddeus Stevens\n\nStevens and Lincoln\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n​Let’s get back to Fairfield and the childhood days of our subject. Nearly six years after the death of his father, William L. W. Seabrook’s mother, Harriet P. (Beckenbaugh) Seabrook, made the decision to move back to her former home in Frederick County’s Creagerstown. The boy, now 10, would attend school here and work on the family farm. He would also learn to perform clerk duties in the store of his uncle, Michael Beckenbaugh. The family attended the Lutheran Church there.\n\n1850 US Census showing the Seabrooks in the home of his uncle, Michael Beckenbaugh\n\nEarly Creagerstown photograph\n\nOld Creagerstown Lutheran Church and Cemetery\n\nGrave of Marie Seabrook (1807-1893) in Creagerstown Lutheran Cemetery\n\n​Around 1850, William L. W. Seabrook moved to Gettysburg and learned the printing trade under a gentleman named Robert Goodloe Harper, Jr. Harper published the Adams Sentinel. Two years later, at age 19, Seabrook continued his foray into publishing by purchasing an interest in a newspaper in our neck of the woods entitled the Frederick Herald. He would become its editor in chief in 1852.\n\nIn 1855, William L. W. Seabrook married a local Frederick girl named Harriet Philippina Thomas. She was the daughter of Robert Levin Thomas (1786-1842) and Elizabeth (Dill) Thomas (1800-1866). Her name likely was given as a result of being born on the Mount Philip plantation located west of Frederick City and accessed by the road that today still carries its name. The original builder of this estate at the foot of Catoctin Mountain was a relative, Dr. Philip Thomas, one of Frederick’s earliest (and legitimate) physicians. Dr. Thomas was also highly active in the war for independence.\n\nThe children of this union mentioned at the outset of this article, buried as youngsters in the family plot here in Mount Olivet, include: Stanley (d. 1861) at 5 months old; Stanley Charles (d. 1863); Frankie (d. 1864 at 3 months old); L. S. (d. 1867); and Claude (d. 1872 at 5 months old).\n\nTwo sons, born earlier than the others, reached adulthood and had full lives. William Levin Seabrook (1856-1931) became a noted Lutheran minister and later state’s attorney for Carroll County. Clarence Seabrook (1859-1924) moved to Syracuse, New York and followed in his father’s footsteps by having a career in the newspaper business.\n\nIn March of 1856, Frederick diarist Jacob Engelbrecht notes that William L. W. Seabrook was elected teacher of the Primary School No. 72 located on the east side of North Market Street. I assume he performed this job in tandem with that of the newspaper which naturally would pull Mr. Seabrook into the wonderful world of politics. In 1857, William L. W. Seabrook left the teaching and newspaper professions as he would be elected commissioner of the Maryland State Land Office, and was subsequently re-elected six years later in 1863. This also precipitated an eventual move to Annapolis.\n\nBaltimore American (Sept 25, 1863)\n\n1860 US Census showing the Seabrooks living in Annapolis\n\nAnnapolis 1861\n\nSeabrook's workplace in Annapolis as Maryland's Land Commissioner\n\n​This was his lot during the period of the American Civil War, in which Seabrook staunchly supported the Union through his Republican leanings. I guess you could say that William L. W. Seabrook had more than “leanings,” as he campaigned on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln throughout the entire state. I found that he wrote a book on his experiences in state government service during the Civil War. Most interesting was his relationship with Gov. Thomas Holiday Hicks who made the decision to move Maryland's General Assembly sessions to Frederick in the summer of 1861. Seabrook used this opportunity to praise his political party for keeping Maryland, a staunch Democratic state, in the Union and not seceding to the south.\n\n​One of William L. W. Seabrook's chief claims to fame is that he had a warm friendship with Abraham Lincoln. He would serve as an advisor over the pulse of Maryland during the Civil War, culminating in playing an important role as a delegate to the national convention which re-nominated President Lincoln in the election of 1864. Seabrook was the Maryland member of the notification committee, and would live to be the last surviving member of the 14-person Maryland delegation to that 1864 presidential convention, and has been said to have possibly outlived all the men that took part in the entire convention.\n\nFront Street Theatre (Baltimore, MD) site of the Union Convention June 7, 8, 1864\n\n​I found a detailed review of Seabrook's experiences of that time, written in his own hand. (NOTE: I will include at the end of this story). Seabrook voted against Lincoln’s running mate Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, for Vice President in 1864, and this explains why Seabrook’s position as Land Office commissioner would be terminated in 1868 by the action of the Democratic convention of 1867. You may recall that Andrew Johnson ascended to the presidency following the April, 1865 assassination of President Lincoln, and would hold the office until 1869.\n\nIn that same year, however, Seabrook became part owner and editor of the American Sentinel newspaper of Westminster. He would work here for seven years before reselling his interest in the paper to the former owner in 1874. William L. W. and Harriet had resided in Westminster at the Montour boarding house during this time, but I also found them associated with a house in Creagerstown. This could have been his mother's house, but kept in W. L. W. Seabrook's name.\n\n1870 US Census showing the Seabrook family living in Westminster\n\nNote the W.L.W. Seabrook house in lower right on the south side of town here shown on the Titus Atlas Map of 1873\n\nWilliam would switch professional gears completely becoming superintendent of public stores and bonded warehouses for the United States Customs Service in Baltimore. He would soon move on to a job with the Port of Baltimore in the role of \"United States weigher, measurer and gauger.\"\n\n1880 US Census showing Seabrook family living in Westminster\n\n​In 1886, our subject returned to the newspaper business and Westminster to serve a second tenure as editor of the American Sentinel. He finally settled into this career, and life in Carroll County. He was active in civic life, and especially the Masons, where he would serve in several leadership positions.\n\nAmerican Sentinel (May 26, 1888)\n\nIn 1900, Seabrook ran unsuccessfully for Congress’ second district here in Maryland, but lost in the primary. He would continue to work as editor at the American Sentinel and was highly respected for his standing as one of the country’s oldest newspaper men, in age and experience.\n\nBaltimore Sun (March 28, 1907)\n\n​William L. W. Seabrook lost his beloved wife, “Pina,” in 1907. She would be buried in Frederick in the family plot where the couple’s children had been buried nearly 40 years earlier. Just days later, Seabrook would learn of a second death, that of his brother.\n\nBaltimore Sun (March 30, 1907)\n\nIt was around this time that William would be joined in Westminster by his son, William L. Seabrook, the Lutheran minister. Rev. Seabrook helped his father with his household, and the newspaper. A few years later, William L. W. would call it quits. Nearly 60 years after first entering the newspaper business, Mr. Seabrook would retire in November of 1909 after 41 years with the American Sentinel.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt speaks to a crowd in Westminster (MD) assembled before the American Sentinel building while on the campaign trail in 1912. (Note the framed picture of Lincoln hanging over first floor windows.)\n\nAmerican Sentinel (Nov 6, 1909)\n\n​Surrounded by family, William L. W. Seabrook would live out his final years in Westminster. His death would come on September 11th, 1916. His obituary would appear in newspapers near and far, as he was a well-known, and respected, figure in his field. The Frederick News would be among this group, and I’m sure the Delaplaine brothers were acquainted with their fellow industry-man. Their paper would run a detailed article in their September 14th addition chronicling the scene in Westminster and Mount Olivet on the occasion of Mr. Seabrook’s funeral services, handled by the Masonic Fraternal Order.\n\nGettysburg Sentinel (Sept 12, 1916)\n\nFrederick News (Sept 12, 1916)\n\nWestminster Democratic Advocate (Sept 15, 1916)\n\nFrederick News (Sept 14, 1916)\n\n​Though not buried here, I became interested in two grandchildren mentioned in Mr. Seabrook’s obituary. Both would have their names in the Frederick newspaper in the months immediately following their paternal grandfather’s death. First would be William B. Seabrook, as he would successfully escape death twice during the time of his grandfather's passing. Raised for a time by William L. W. and Harriet Seabrook in Westminster, William would participate in World War I. While on the French warfront, his first encounter involved being wounded by deadly gas. Removed from the front, he almost got killed on his way back home to America.\n\nFrederick News (Oct 11, 1916)\n\n​I want to say more about this man in a minute, but let me complete my earlier thought by relaying that William L. W.’s granddaughter made the Delaplaine’s newspaper pages with an announcement of her engagement in November of 1916. Her name was Frances Seabrook and she wed Ralph Whitman, a civil engineer in the US Navy. He would eventually achieve the rank of Rear Admiral and had a storied career and much notoriety in military duty, and the pair are buried at Arlington Cemetery.\n\n​\n\nSpeaking of careers and notoriety however, let's get back to Frances’ brother William. His career would be an evocative one as I found myself going down the proverbial rabbit hole after seeing countless references to him after a simple Google search. To my surprise, I found that he is more famous, or shall I say infamous, than his namesake grandfather. He’s been labeled as having been terrible, a drunkard, abominable, tormented, perverted, crazy and an all-out whacko. Oh, how I wish he was buried here in Mount Olivet!\n\nWilliam Seabrook in 1933 taken by Carl Van Vechten\n\nIn her article for Atavest Magazine, author Emily Matchar describes the grandson of William L. W. Seabrook as \"the writer who introduced zombies to America.\" The following link to her online article is a great resource, as it paints a picture of Harriet P. (Thomas) Seabrook. It reveals that William B. \"Willy\" Seabrook held his grandmother “Piny” in high regard, although his assessment of his father and grandfather was not kind. Here is a link to that article: https://magazine.atavist.com/the-zombie-king/\n\nWilliam Buehler Seabrook was born in Westminster in 1884. Apparently his father (William L. Seabrook) and mother left him in the care of his grandparents when he was eight years old. He had great resentment for this action (and his parents in general) based on the gentleman's later writings. He wasn't overly crazy about William L. W. Seabrook either.\n\nThe only family member for whom William B. Seabrook had any affection was his grandmother, who he called \"Piny,\" (pronounced \"pee-nee\") a nickname stemming from her middle name of Philippina. Our cemetery records back up this claim, however ours incorrectly reads as \"Ponie.\"\n\nWilliam B. Seabrook described his grandmother as being a soul barely of this world. He wrote in his memoirs:\n\n\"She was born on a Maryland plantation in the caul (the amniotic sac unbroken around her, which was said to impart on a child a supernatural aura), and nursed by an Obeah slave girl. Piny possessed “visions and powers” since childhood but was married off as a teen to Seabrook’s “white-bearded” grandfather, who brought her to Westminster and forced her to live an unhappy life among the tedious bourgeoisie. To feed her opium addiction, she hid a bottle of laudanum in the crook of a backyard tree.\"\n\nSeabrook believed that his grandmother saw something in him (self described as \"her odd, morose grandson\"). They were kindred spirits, and he went on to say, “Another little soul which, like herself, found normal, ordinary life unbearable.” It was through his beloved Piny that he had his first experience with the “unexplained,” and supernatural. This would serve as a subject that would occupy his mind for the rest of his life.\n\nMs. Matchar illustrates in her article that, \"He and Piny would often walk together in Shreiver’s Woods, just outside Westminster. Seabrook knew the woods well; he would often go there to gather chinquapin nuts or fish for minnows in the stream. But one day, Seabrook wrote, while he was strolling with Piny, the woods became strange. They arrived at a clearing he didn’t recognize. Suddenly, the trees surrounding him were not trees but the legs of 'beautiful bright-plumaged roosters, which were as tall as houses.' Taking him by the hand, Piny led him beneath the legs of the roosters as the enormous birds shuffled and crowed.\"\n\nI assume that \"Willy\" Seabrook was here in Mount Olivet's Area A/Lot 95 for the funeral of his grandmother in 1907. Perhaps she brought him here on occasion to visit the graves of the children \"Piny\" lost decades earlier? Maybe he visited his grandfather's grave after returning from the war?\n\nRegardless, this is some strange stuff indeed, but get ready for tales of cannibalism, witchcraft and human bondage.\n\n​William B. Seabrook began a respectable career as a reporter and City Editor of the Augusta Chronicle in Georgia, worked at the New York Times, and later became a partner in an advertising agency in Atlanta. He is well-known for his later writing on, and engaging in, cannibalism. Seabrook's 1929 book The Magic Island, which documents his experiences with Haitian Vodoo in Haiti, is considered the first popular English-language work to describe the concept of zombies. That’s right, the grandson of William L. W. Seabrook and wife Harriet Philippina (Thomas) Seabrook is responsible for what we know as zombies. Cue Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” and fire up a Netflix binge-watch of the Walking Dead.\n\n​William B. Seabrook would die of suicide by drug overdose in 1945. ​There is plenty written about this man to be found on the internet, and many of his books, and a few biographies are available in print. Be sure to check eBay because they have a great selection to choose from.\n\nIf anything else, I guess the old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" surely fits the gravestone and life story of William B.'s grandfather, William Luther Wesley Seabrook.\n\n​This week's \"story\" will be about our latest class of inductees into our Mount Olivet Monument Hall of Fame. Plenty more on that in a moment, as I would be remiss not to remind our readers that this blog is uniquely inspired and influenced by gravestones week in, and week out. That reminds me of something I must make sure you know:\n\nMount Olivet Cemetery sells and designs grave monuments! It's true, and not just a shallow marketing pitch.\n\nNow this may be something that many Fredericktonians and Frederick Countians (and beyond) are well aware of, yet there are some folks that likely have no idea. It's understandable as a rival monument dealer is strategically located directly across from our cemetery front gate-a brilliant marketing move which continues to illustrate the real estate mantra of \"location, location, location.\"\n\n​Custom grave marker sales is something Mount Olivet has been doing for about 20 years now. Our staff has designed, and placed, hundreds of memorials over this period. You certainly have your choice to choose from and shop around, and we get the same \"rocks\" from the same US quarries as our competitors. We also have had special orders involving the utilization of exotic stone from overseas locations. A key selling point lies in \"the one-stop shop approach.\" Since we work with the customer on purchasing their burial plot, and related grave opening-closing services, why have them deal with an outside firm for the memorial/grave monument that will be placed here? Mount Olivet staff will also be the ones excavating and providing the appropriate cement foundation (for a stone marker), while having the ultimate responsibility in providing overall care and maintenance for the customer's burial lot, and surrounding cemetery, into perpetuity.\n\nAs is the case with the thousands of grave monuments on our hallowed grounds, the Mount Olivet Cemetery corporation will always be here as it has been since 1854. We don't plan on going anywhere in the future. More than that, money spent on a stone at Mount Olivet doesn't go to a business owner or shareholder, but is solely used in operating and enhancing the cemetery. Doesn't it make sense to obtain a gravestone from us as well?\n\nIt's interesting to see the variety of choices to memorialize loved ones. You just need to drive or walk through the cemetery to see our vast showroom of models. And that is exactly what some people do. Customers in the form of Mount Olivet lot-holders often take pictures of gravestone shapes, styles and sizes that interest them. They present these images when meeting with our sales team of Meghan Murphy and Rick Reeder. Many times, they will accompany the customer on sightseeing sojourns where the customer can point out aspects of existing stones that they like. Meghan and Rick can easily incorporate these ideas and examples into a design for a custom stone. They also have at their disposal thousands of designs and styles that are available from our vendors and can share these during meetings and appointments.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing and designing a grave monument, remember the old adage, if you can dream it, you can do it. If anything else, shop your preferred stone design idea to different vendors for estimates, but please give us a chance to show you what we can do for you.\n\nNow, since we are on the subject of monuments, I promise that you won't find a larger and eclectic collection in central and western Maryland than Mount Olivet Cemetery. The only one that comes close is our sister-\"garden cemetery\" of Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown. We boast an evocative \"museum of marbles\" and \"gallery of granites.\"\n\nBack in 2017, we launched the Preservation and Enhancement Fund of Mount Olivet Cemetery, a 501 © (3) nonprofit entity with a goal of showcasing and securing our amazing cultural landscape. As many know, we possess a unique blend of nature, art, and architecture symbolically memorializing the human condition. With the assistance of cemetery staff and our Friends of Mount Olivet (FOMO) membership group (begun in Spring, 2020), the non-profit's mission is to preserve the cemetery's historic records, on-premises house and chapel structures and, most noticeably, thousands of vintage gravestones and monuments.\n\nOur hope is to educate visitors and Frederick residents alike by sharing the fascinating background of Mount Olivet and those who reside in it, numbering nearly 41,000. The “Friends” group is active in related activities designed to generate enthusiasm in not only history research and gravestone preservation, but continued fundraising while spreading community awareness of this special place. We attempt to accomplish this through engaging and entertaining educational lecture programs, walking tours, special events and anniversary commemorations. ​\n\n​Two summers back, our Friends group established the Mount Olivet Monument Hall of Fame. We inducted seven monuments, including our most famous in Francis Scott Key, as part of the inaugural class.\n\n​In talking with colleagues and other members of our Friends group, we found it best to frame this new “Hall of Fame” on the look and design of the monuments, themselves, and not on the person(s) buried beneath. So, it is the above-ground masterpiece of art and craftmanship that provides the criteria for consideration, nomination and election to our “Mount Olivet Monument Hall of Fame.”\n\nUnlike other \"Halls of Fame\" (ie: sports, music, etc.), we didn't have to build a gallery on our grounds, as we already have one! The memorials are already in place, some for well over a century and a half already. All inductees appear in the form of a virtual gallery on the MountOlivetHistory.com site.\n\n​\n\nIn 2022 and again this past summer, we put the task of Hall of Fame voting to our Friends of Mount Olivet. A nominating committee within the Friends group was formed in early summer and headed up by Mike and Sheila Schaden. Nominees (put forth by Friends members) were submitted throughout the summer and a narrowed down list of 20 was officially introduced at this year's annual picnic in late August. The voting commenced with both in-person, online and mail-in ballot from our FOMO membership.\n\n​\n\nThe votes have been tabulated and certified as we proudly share our class of 2023 inductees for the Mount Olivet Monument Hall of Fame.\n\nSeabrook \"Praying Child\" Monument\n\nLocation: Area A/Lot 95\n\nDate of Placement: after 1902\n\n​Decedents: L. S. Seabrook\n\nThis appears to be a small monument of a naked child praying. In doing a little online research, I found this same design displayed in several other cemeteries such as Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, New York's Albany Rural Cemetery in Albany and Schenectady's Vale Cemetery, Green-Wood Cemetery in New York City Brooklyn's vast Green-Wood, and Union Grove in Canal Winchester, Ohio, Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Forest Hill in Boston, Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit, and Mount Auburn (the original \"garden\" cemetery). Examples also appear in Ireland and England. Some of these figures were marble, one was white zinc. ​\n\nHenry Ruggles (d. 1863) grave in Brooklyn, New York's famed Green-Wood Cemetery\n\nBradley family monument with praying child statue atop in Vale Cemetery, Schenectady\n\nAnderson Monument at Albany Rural Cemetery\n\nAuthor Paula Lemire of a blog entitled \"Beyond the Graves\" wrote of this design in an April, 2016 blog:\n\n\"The little figure was originally the work of Florentine sculptor Luigi Pampaloni (1791-1847). Created around 1826, the figure was originally one of a plaster pair; a sleeping girl and a kneeling boy beside her. On a visit to Pampaloni's studio, Countess Anna Potocka commissioned a marble copy of the boy for the grave of her young daughter Julia in Krakow.\n\nThe statue, which shows a child kneeling with one knee raised and one foot tucked behind, clasped hands, an upturned face, and long curls, became quite popular and copies some appeared in gardens and cemeteries. Appealing to popular sentimental taste, plaster, alabaster, and porcelain examples could be found in parlors and drawing rooms. Some examples include wings. In some versions, the child kneels on a cushion, where others omit the cushion.\"\n\n1870 Albany (NY) Commercial & Business Directory\n\nThis was a popular design of the era and well known to lovers of art and sculpture. Ms. Lemire, in her blog, included a few vintage newspaper advertisements in the 1870 Albany Commercial & Business Directory for monument dealers. These competing stone-carvers distinctly show \"the praying child\" as a familiar option for funerary art.\n\nThis monument in Mount Olivet is not used as a larger monument topper, as can be found in many of the places mentioned above. Here it marks the grave of L. S. Seabrook, an infant who died in 1867. Not much more is known of this child belonging to William L. W. Seabrook and wife Harriet P. Seabrook. I venture to say that the baby's name could have been Luther, as that is one of his father's middle names (Luther Wesley). A few feet away in this lot, four other Seabrook children are buried under a miniature obelisk with respective names on each of four panels. Two have the name of Stanley, so perhaps that name (Stanley) could have been the \"S\" in L. S. Seabrook?\n\nNationally renowned cemetery restoration expert Jonathan Appell put the Bopst monument back together again\n\nBopst Family Monument\n\nLocation: Area L/ Lot 192\n\nDate of Placement: after 1901\n\n​Decedents: Bion Eugene Bopst, Mary E. (Bruchey) Bopst, Grace E. (Orem) Bopst, Annie Betson\n\nThe Bopst monument is among the most beautiful in the cemetery. In my first year on the job here, I took several pictures for use in marketing materials for Mount Olivet such as brochures, our website and Facebook. Ironically, I also used a beautiful fall time photograph I had taken for a title page within a PowerPoint presentation I often give on the preservation mission we have here at the cemetery. How's that for some foreshadowing? I'm so pleased to have it recognized in our Monument Hall of Fame.\n\nThis monument in Area L, not far from the rear of the Key Memorial Chapel, is a pleasant sight for sore eyes and restoration success story. For quite some time, earlier this year and the fall of 2022 that preceded it, the Mourning Woman statue that adorns the top of the Bion E. Bopst family plot marker was \"out for repairs.\" This certainly topped its previous \"headless\" condition throughout the previous three years—the result of damage from a falling tree during a violent thunderstorm that hit the cemetery in April, 2019.\n\nThe day after the Bopst monument \"beheading\" by a tree (2019)\n\nThe \"Mourning Woman\" is derived from Classicism and its association is with ancient Greece and Rome. When it comes to Victorian era cemeteries, these sentinels have been on duty for well over a century and a half. They patiently watch over and grieve for the departed. Each represents an eternal mourner, often with a veil covering her head and swathed in flowing robes as she keeps vigil.\n\n​Our Mourning Woman here in Mount Olivet even holds a wreath in her arm to symbolize a \"victory over death and, moreso, remembrance.\" A like statue can be found in our inaugural Hall of Fame Class of 2021 and located in Area R where it memorializes the John H. Williams family. Mr. Williams was a prominent banker who gave Frederick \"Charity\" the dog, an iron statue in front of his former home on South Market Street.\n\nThe Bopst \"Mourning Woman\" in Area L/Lot 192 was placed over a lot purchased by Mr. Bion Eugene Bopst in 1901 as a place to re-inter his first wife, Mary E. (Bruchey) Bopst. Mary had died five years earlier in November of 1896, at the tender age of 37. She was originally buried in Utica Cemetery in the quaint hamlet north of Frederick City and along Old Frederick Road that boasts one of the county’s oft-photographed covered bridges. Today, the adjoining church is known as St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran.\n\nI don’t know what prompted this move to Mount Olivet, but I deducted that her burial at Utica could have been precipitated by the presence of relatives tied to her mother's (Margaret Jackson Bruchey) Jackson family that had ties to the Woodsboro area. Regardless, Mary Elizabeth (Bruchey) Bopst was re-buried here in Mount Olivet on November 14th, 1901.\n\nI could not find any further information on the exact date of the memorial placement of our “Mourning Woman” on Area L, but I would surmise that it went in at the time of Mary’s re-interment, which would have generated a central “family” monument with her last name to give proper context to her individual, raised foot stone. Read more about this monument and its restoration with the original \"Stories in Stone\" article from March, 2023.​\n\n\"Our Darling Adelaide\" Memorial\n\nLocation: Area H/Lot 361\n\nDate of Placement: after July 1890\n\n​Decedents: Adelaide Derr\n\n​At 10 months and 18 days of age, it should come as no surprise that Adelaide Derr's parents chose to adorn her grave with a statue of a child. The figure is holding a cross with a flower atop, almost like a parent would cradle a baby.\n\nI couldn't find an exact duplicate of this design, but did locate simarly-themed grave markers including one in Memphis, Tennessee's Elmwood Cemetery.\n\nChild statue in Elmwood Cemetery\n\nAdelaide was born on August 18th, 1888. She was the daughter of Millard (later Milton) Taylor Derr and wife Mary C. Smith. She did not have a long life at all, but it was one that hopefully brought joy to her parents throughout the duration. Not all children received obits, however \"darling\" Adelaide did. The obituary for our decedent claims that she died at exactly 1:50am on June 30th, 1890.\n\nFrederick News (June 30, 1890)\n\nSanborn Insurance Map of 1887 showing vicinity of West Patrick (left) at intersection with DeGrange Street\n\nAdelaide's father worked as a butcher (as did his father before him). The family lived at 308 West Patrick Street (west of Bentz Street). A Sanborn Insurance map from 1887 shows a sausage making facility in their backyard, as well as a slaughter house next door and behind (Millard's father) Daniel Derr's house. Note that today's Degrange Street was originally known as Derrs Street or LeGrange Street. The Derr sausage factory backs up to the Frederick County Jail, which once fronted on West South Street. Today, the old jail is home to the Frederick Rescue Mission. That neighborhood has a tradition of being lively!\n\n​The Derrs had had one other child, Millard Arthur Derr (1882-1956). He was a veteran of World War I and spent 30 years in Detroit after the war working as a civil engineer. Millard Arthur died in Detroit but was buried in Salisbury, Maryland's Parsons Cemetery with his wife Nancy (Hooper) and her family, not in Mount Olivet with his sister and parents.\n\n​Mother (Catherine Michael) Monument\n\nLocation: Area H/Lot 397\n\nDate of Placement: after 1858\n\n​Decedents: Catharine (Bernhart) Michael\n\nThis monument has been featured in FaceBook posts on Mother's Day for good reason as it is a memorial ode to a maternal figure. The sentiment near the base of this stone reads \"Rest Sweet Mother Rest.\" Above this, a bible passage (Philippians 1:21) is featured in which the apostle Paul said: \"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.\" Another verse appears beneath but is hard to make out.\n\nThe decedent here is a woman named Catharine Michael (born Catharine Bernhart on January 4th, 1804).\n\nCatharine was married three times. Her first husband was John Coe. The couple was married in 1820 and apparently lived in the Mechanicstown area. Coe died in 1833 and is buried at Israel's Creek Meeting House Cemetery in Walkersville. She next married John Baker in 1835 and had daughters Caroline (Baker) Mory (who is also buried in H/397), and Sarah. They lived in the Middletown District.\n\nAfter John Baker died in 1837, Catharine, serving as executor, sold his 78.5 acre farm and his 42 acre farm. She bought a half-lot in Middletown located just east of the Lutheran Church on Main Street. She later bought a half-lot at what is now 108 W. Main St. In 1850, Catharine married Isaac Michael, a farmer in the Middletown Valley who is shown on the 1858 Bond Atlas map living on Burkittsville Road.\n\nCatharine died at age 54 on February 28th, 1858. It is highly likely that Catharine's daughter, Caroline (Baker) Mory (1836-1896), is the one responsible for the sentiment on the stone's face. A draped urn completes this monument as the vessel itself is a representation of those used to carry the remains of the dead, while the fabric symbolizes the veil that separates the living and the dead, and the thin line that separates them.\n\n​Kintz Tree-Cross Monument\n\nLocation: Area H/Lot 156\n\nDate of Placement: after 1922\n\n​Decedents: Dorothy A. Kintz\n\nDorothy Arbelinan Kintz did not have the opportunity to celebrate her \"Sweet 16\" birthday, as she would pass five months prior at Frederick's City Hospital from peritonitis. The daughter of Jacob Kintz and Johanna Christiana Heinrich was born August 8th, 1906. Dorothy's father was a metal worker, and her mother a German immigrant who kept house. The family lived at 228 East 7th Street. Dorothy traveled to Germany when she was five years old to spend two months with relatives. She was an employee of the Union Knitting Mills at the time of her death.\n\n1920 US Census showing Dorothy Kintz living with her family in Frederick\n\nCross memorials appear regularly in cemetery art and ornamentation. They generally denote Christians, and more specifically Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. This monument is truly different as it is crafted in marble as if it were made out of tree limbs. On top of this, faux ivy covers this cross. Stone-tree memorials like this usually symbolize eternal life or fertility. This seems to be a fitting memorial for this young lady on the cusp of womanhood.\n\nFrederick News (March 17, 1922)\n\nFrederick News (March 21, 1922)\n\nFrederick News (March 21, 1922)\n\nFrederick News (May 29, 1922)\n\n​Kehne Children Monuments\n\nLocation: Area L/Lot 36\n\nDate of Placement: after 1902\n\n​Decedents: Helen E. Kehne, Blanche M. Kehne, John Edgar Kehne, Pearl C. Kehne\n\nThere are many cemetery symbols of iconography that seem to be ubiquitous—the lamb is certainly one of them. When traversing a graveyard, if you see a tiny lambs on a stone, you most likely have the grave of a child. These lambs come in many sizes and positions—usually you will find these straddling small tombstones or foot stones.\n\nThe lamb is the symbol of the Lord, the Good Shepherd. The animal also represents innocence, likely the reason for this motif commonly adorning the tombstones of infants and young children. Most often the lamb is lying down, often asleep and sometimes with a cross incorporated into the design.\n\nIn a few places within Mount Olivet, one can find clusters of graves topped by lamb monuments. Area L is one of these, and boasts four such monuments (topped by this animal) in the family plot of William Richard Kehne (1879-1945). Kehne worked as an engineer with the Ox-Fibre Brush Company located on East Church Street extended. He married Blanche Virginia Cutsail and the family welcomed their first child in 1907. He was named William Cutsail Kehne in honor of both parents.\n\n​The family lived nearby William's worksite, residing on Wisner Street in the 1910 Census, and at 501 East Church by the 1920 Census. During the teens decade in between, the Kehnes would gain three more family members, but lose four. These children constitute the row of lamb-topped gravestones that have been chosen for Hall of Fame induction. The four are shown below. Please note that Helen Kehne passed first, and a different marble mason/company appears to have been employed by the family as the sheep, shape of dye, design and vital information is completely different than the other three.\n\nFrederick News (Feb 28, 1910)\n\nFrederick Post (Aug 2, 1913)\n\nFrederick News (July 15, 1912)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 24, 1917)\n\nIt goes without saying that the loss of a child is excruciatingly difficult for any parent to deal with. This couple dealt with the loss of four children over a seven-year span. One is too many for most to deal with, but this was a time a century ago when children mortality was high and medicine was not what it is today. As you just read, the Kehne children died of such maladies as pneumonia, infant cholera and meningitis. These can be handled more routinely by the physicians of today, and the highly improved treatments and recovery regiments currently available.\n\nI'm sure the Kehnes cherished their three remaining children (William, Arthur and Thelma) who would grow into adulthood. It's a sad thing to see those small groupings of baby sheep at a cemetery. This is just one more example. God bless, and hold, parents such as William R. and Blanche Kehne. Those who endure (and survive) the loss of a child are certainly the strongest among us.\n\nStull Family Monument\n\nLocation: Area T/Lot 66\n\nDate of Placement: around 1920\n\n​Decedents: Singleton Stull and wife Emma J. (Conrad) Stull\n\nThe monument on Area T/Lot #66 belongs to a couple by the names of Singleton (1851-1930) and Emma (Conrad) Stull (1851-1920). I wrote an article about them back in April of 2023.\n\n​Their monument could be the work of local stonemason Howard G. Taylor (1875-1961), buried a few short yards to the north. This large and hearty stone features an ancient building, seemingly a temple, in a state of free-falling collapse. Carved by hand, the structure is crafted to appear as if enshrined within the shell of the larger boulder. On exterior of the outer shell, we find second artistic element, and another can be found as well on the temple. One is a strand, or vine, of flowers in full bloom, and the other is a lone feather.\n\n​Since we can easily judge the architecture depicted on the Stull monument as ancient, I thought the answer would either lie in Greek or Roman history, the Bible, or both. I had someone mention to me that it may signify Pompeii, a victim of Mount Vesuvius. I didn’t see the symbolism in a destructive volcano wiping out civilization being something you’d want to put on your grave marker, unless of course you were a victim of said Vesuvius—and those poor souls didn’t have much of a say in their burial as it happened without warning.\n\n​Another individual offered the story of Joshua and the Wall of Jericho. In the case of Jericho, the bible lesson here reminds us that walls can be a source of imprisonment and division, but God fulfills what He promises. Is this a “shout out” to the promise of heaven to the faithful? I re-read some interpretations of this Bible story and learned that some scientists have theorized that the walls of Jericho were destroyed by an earthquake and not seven priests blowing trumpets. Regardless, the depiction on the Stull stone looks more like the famed Paestum Temple in Salerno (Italy) than an ancient city wall in Palestine's West Bank.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n​\"STORY IN STONE\"\n\n​​Thomas Floral Monuments\n\nLocation: Area F/Lot 24 & 26\n\nDate of Placement: after 1902\n\n​Decedents: William Hamilton Thomas, Susannah Thomas, Martha Ritchie (Hanna) Knight\n\n​The floral carvings on these monuments are amazing, exhibiting expert craftsman skills by the talented stonemason who performed this work. These lasting memorials were likely quite expensive, but based on other stones in this lot and those adjacent, money was no object. Within feet is an earlier inductee of the MOC Hall of Fame with the Celtic Cross marker of John Knight McDannold made by Tiffany's of New York around 1899, the year of the decedent's passing.\n\n​Susanna Hanna (Knight) Thomas was raised in Indiana but later in life moved here. A few of my earlier \"Stories in Stone\" blogs focus on her grandnephew, John Knight McDannold, and also her brother, John Knight. This latter gentleman has a large, impressive monument a few feet away in an adjoining lot, and was very wealthy at the time of his death in 1864. As a matter of fact, Mr, Knight died in Biarritz France, and his body was brought overseas for burial in Mount Olivet --something rarely done at the time for monetary and public health reasons.\n\nSusannah's husband, William Hamilton Thomas (1835-1917), had roots in Frederick, as did his wife, and had done very well for himself going into his father Edward C. Thomas’s oyster and fruit packing business. This was started several decades before in Baltimore. The couple had three daughters: Florence, Fannie and Marcia Virginia. Marcia Virginia Thomas was featured in a past \"Story in Stone\" feature as she died due to a terrible drowning accident while the family was vacationing at Rangeley Lake, Maine in 1892.\n\n​Recently, the Friends of Mount Olivet monument restoration and repair team \"up-righted\" Susannah's mother's monument as it had been face down from a fall several years ago. This was Martha Ritchie (Hanna) Knight (1811-1887). Mrs. Hannah's gravestone was the model for the same floral design and craftsmanship that would be employed for both Susannah and William's stones.\n\nMartha Ritchie (Knight) Hanna was the daughter of James Knight and Mary McCleery who married in Frederick in 1804, but moved to Indiana shortly thereafter. Sources vary as to where Martha was born, some say Maryland and others Indiana. She married a John N. Hanna and lived in Brookeville, Indiana with had daughters Elizabeth and Susannah. By 1840, Mr. Hanna ( some sources refer to him as Gen. Hannah) had apparently died, leaving as Martha with her two daughters to raise.\n\n​In 1841, Andrew McCleery\" in consideration of the natural love and affection which he hath and beareth to Martha, as also for the better maintenance, support, livelihood and preferment of her\" sold her part of the \"Old Shop Lot\" on the north side of the eastern end of the market house ground. Martha sold this lot in 1852 to the Mayor and Common Council of Frederick. She apparently rented housing after that. Daughter Susannah married William Hamilton Thomas in Frederick in 1859. Susannah bought 19 South Stricker Street in Baltimore in 1871. By 1880 Martha was living there with William and Susannah Thomas.\n\nThomas residence in west Baltimore on the corner of Hollins and S. Stricker streets\n\nWilliam Thomas died in 1917, and his wife died three years later. Another signature element included on these three monuments is a draped cloth atop the stone. This represents a veil, or curtain, that separates the living from the dead. The old expression \"It's curtains for you\" was derived from the world of dramatic stage production, when the final 'curtain' was drawn across the stage at the conclusion of a performance. I'd say it's time for me to draw the curtains on this article.\n\n​​So there you have it, the Class of 2023 for the Mount Olivet Monument Hallof Fame.

Two years prior, he was busy planning for a one week county fair in October. In 1861, the fears and anxieties associated with a Civil War put the \"Kabosh\" on a successful run of annual exhibitions because the fair's local home would be needed for the war effort.\n\nThe particular week, and those to follow September 17th, 1862 saw hundreds of newcomers coming to Frederick. These were not the annual fairgoers, but rather wounded soldiers. You see, September 17th, 1862 marked a significant date that would go down in history. It remains that of the deadliest single-day battle in American history with 3,675 killed and total casualties numbering 22,717. We know it as Antietam.\n\nSharpsburg, Maryland, the scene of battle, was only 30 miles away, and Frederick's residents would see casualties brought to town to local hospitals. This had actually begun happening a few days earlier as the Union and Confederate armies had squared off in pitched battles on September 14th at three mountain gaps atop South Mountain, dividing line between Frederick and Washington counties. Fittingly, this conflict, the first battle on northern, or Union, territory, became known as the Battle of South Mountain.\n\nBattle of South Mountain (Fox's Gap) September 14, 1862\n\n​The Confederates had come to Frederick after crossing the Potomac River in that first week of September, and stayed here for about five days before departing on September 10th. With an invading army in town, the last thing on the mind of residents was the annual county fair and the livestock competitions, food and amusements that comprised an agricultural fair at the time.\n\nNow this was certainly not “Fair Week,” as our annual agricultural exhibition was generally held in October, corresponding with traditional Oktoberfest time, as a celebration of the end of growing and harvest season. The frivolity of the agricultural exhibitions here had actually been slightly challenged back in 1859, as the community was still abuzz with talk and sentiment regarding John Brown’s recent raid on Harper’s Ferry. It was also that fall, Frederick County received the distinct honor of hosting the 20th Annual Exhibition of the Maryland State Agricultural Society from October 25-27, 1859.\n\nFor those not familiar with the ill-fated insurrection attempt by John Brown, he and his band of followers orchestrated a deadly raid on the Union military arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Brown had been staging for this event at the Kennedy farm, just over the Washington County line in Pleasant Valley. When he put his plan into effect on the night of October 16th, word reached Frederick by rail the next morning and the nation was alerted of the events from here. Members of Frederick’s fire companies/militia units who regularly performed drills and displays at the annual fair, now had to put their military training to practical use as they were hurried to Harpers Ferry by train, among the first responders on the scene. They would assist Col. Robert E. Lee, Capt. JEB Stuart and the U.S. Marines in the successful capture of Brown and his surviving men.\n\n​Amidst the local and national excitement this event would have on the local citizenry, the Maryland State Fair commenced at the Frederick Barracks Grounds on October 25th and dictated an excellent exhibition with banner attendance. Hotels were filled, and county residents extended their hospitality, and their business goods and inventories, to throngs of tourists. Of particular interest during this event were the simultaneous benefit events being held by the Ladies auxiliaries attached to fire companies of Frederick. A newspaper account from October 26th reported that the United’s had “on exhibition the hat and a pistol belonging to “old” Brown, a Sharp’s Rifle and a Litchfield Spear, captured by the Guards at Harper’s Ferry.”\n\nMeanwhile the Junior Defenders performed military drills for audiences with the accompaniment of The American Band. I haven't seen proof of this anywhere, but I'm sure one of the most popular citizens to attend the fair that year was George Brengle Shope. The Frederick resident was working a carpentry job in Harpers Ferry at the time of Brown's raid, and unfortunately found himself among those held hostage in the engine house. He lived to tell his tale, and would testify in Brown's trial. (NOTE: George Brengle Shope is buried in Mount Olivet's Area H and you can read more about him in an earlier Story in Stone titled \"John Brown's Hostage.\")\n\nThe Seventh Exhibition of the Frederick County Agricultural Society was held in October 1860. Unfortunately, the return of the Frederick County fair was clearly overshadowed by the rhetoric and anticipation tied to the hotly contested U.S. Presidential election between Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, John Breckinridge and John C. Bell. Southern Democrat, and former vice-president John C. Breckinridge ran on the slavery platform and was Maryland's winner with 45.93% of the vote (42,482), edging out Constitutional Union candidate John Bell who garnered 45.14% of the vote (41,760 votes). As for the other candidates with much greater name recognition today than the previous candidates, Stephen Douglas received 5,966 votes (6.45%) from Marylanders, and in distant fourth place, Abraham Lincoln had 2,294 votes (2.48%). I read somewhere that Lincoln only received 17 votes in Frederick County. When reviewing results like these, it's not hard to understand the effect of politics and the volatile mood of the country at that time.\n\n(L-R) Lincoln, Douglas, Breckinridge, Bell\n\nThe city militia units performed drills during the fair, and were joined by county companies such as the Linganore Mounted Guard, Liberty Riflemen, Carrollton Manor Mounted Guard and three others from beyond the county. Soon, these men would be split apart by politics, having to choose respective sides. The military pomp and circumstance displayed at the recent fairs would certainly be an omen of things to come. However, the pageantry would be missing as the goal would be kill, or be killed.\n\n​Within weeks of the 1860 Frederick agricultural fair, residents would see Abraham Lincoln elected as their new president. (Interestingly, they would eventually see their man John C. Breckinridge four years later, leading Rebel troops here under Jubal Early during the Battle of Monocacy in July, 1864).\n\nSouthern states would immediately start seceding from the Union in the months to follow. The official first shots of war occurred on April 12th, 1861 in Charleston, South Carolina as Fort Sumter was fired upon. Virginia would join the Confederacy less than a week later and on April 19th, an angry mob in Baltimore attacked federal troops from Massachusetts who were trying to make their way through town. The city would be placed under martial law by the federal government.\n\nFrederick would soon become the state capital during the spring and summer 1861. In August, the Potomac Home Brigade was formed as local Union men enlisted for military duty. Others fled south to join the confederacy, such as former Junior Defender Bradley Tyler Johnson, who would take an active part in forming the 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA. The Frederick County Agricultural Exhibition’s home of the Barracks Grounds was permanently commandeered for its intended purposes and would be converted into a Union Military Hospital.\n\nEnter the fore-mentioned Edward Buckey as president of the society, ascending to the position in that year of 1861. His role would be eased as there would not be another Frederick Agricultural fair until October of 1868. However, concerns of local farmers would be heightened during the multiple-year “War Between the States.”\n\nThe Barracks Grounds on South Market Street had served home to the county fair through the 1850s but was taken over by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Barracks were constructed to create Union Hospital #1 and would provide care for sick and wounded soldiers of both armies throughout the conflict.\n\n​Edward Buckey\n\nI randomly chose Edward Buckey and the Frederick Fair here as an interesting lens to view world events at that time. This annual rite of fall, the Great Frederick Fair, is a traditional staple of Frederick County. The more things change as Frederick continues to grow, we can count on our history and events such as the fair and Civil War sites to ground us. In the Frederick Fair's realm, it's something that can serve as a time capsule of not only \"great\" memories for us all boasting the sights, sounds, smells, and thrills of the fair, but also the essence of comaraderie and community. Sadly, that wouldn't be afforded at three distinct times over the past 160 years. One was the period of the Civil War, with a second being the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic. Of course, more recently, the third cancellation of the Great Frederick Fair occurred in September, 2020 thanks to the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nLet's take a look at Edward Buckey, shall we? Born March 7th, 1797 in Libertytown, Edward Buckey was the son of Peter Buckey (1775-1848) and Mary Salmon (1778-1864). His paternal grandfather, Matthias Buckey (1727-1794) immigrated to America around 1750 from Minfield, Rhineland-Pfalz, Germany. Matthias first settled around New Windsor, and eventually bought properties in, and around, Frederick. I was pleased to learn that one of these was land near Little Tuscarora Creek, destined to become the Cloverhill II development off Opossumtown Pike (just north of Frederick Community College).\n\n​Edward Buckey's father (Peter) was one of eight siblings born to Matthias and wife Mary (Hoffman). Two of these were John and George Buckey who would be responsible for helping to create the crossroads town south of Frederick that bears the family name-Buckeystown. John was a tavern-keeper and blacksmith and George was a tanner.\n\nEdward was the oldest of five children, and only son of Peter and Mary. His father bought 13 town lots in Libertytown on South Street and a 30-acre tract in 1812. He also operated a tannery here that would become known as the Angel Tannery and boasted 36 vats according to a newspaper ad in the Frederick Town Herald in 1823. It is assumed that Edward Buckey grew up on the family farm and was apparently educated in local schools. I will say here that in writing an earlier Story in Stone on Elihu Rockwell (namesake of Rockwell Terrace), I learned that Libertytown had an Academy on the east end of town in which Mr. Rockwell was once headmaster.\n\nInformation about Edward's early life is scarce, but an obituary from the Baltimore Sun states that Edward Buckey was a captain during the War of 1812. This has not been confirmed as yet, and we don't not have him labeled in our cemetery records as such. A cousin, Daniel Buckey, however is part of our Mount Olivet collective of War of 1812 veterans numbering 110.\n\nEdward Buckey was an ardent member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. His father was a trustee of the church in Libertytown and had a hand in purchasing land used for the congregation's structure. Edward would move to the Frederick area around the time of his 21st birthday when Peter Buckey bought a 197-acre farm in 1818, said to have been located west of Frederick on \"the Old Middletown Road.\" After tracing the deeds forward, my land research \"secret weapon\" Marilyn Veek found that this farm (one day owned by Edward Buckey) was located on the south side of Butterfly Lane between Mount Philip Road and Butterfly Ridge Elementary School. Most of this farm property is now the \"Emerald Farms\" development, while part of it is under I-70, and another part of it is south of I-70 (currently undeveloped and landlocked).\n\nI'm jumping ahead in the story but to explain the farmstead a little more in detail I direct your attention to the following newspaper ad from 1866. This was the sale of the property which was known as \"Bloomfield Farm.\" The article describes it as being located \"three miles from Frederick\". When Edward later sold all the farm animals, crops, household goods, etc. the farm is identified as being two and-a-half miles southwest of Frederick. We are pretty sure that Butterfly Lane is today is what was referred to here as \"Old Middletown Road\" as opposed to the National Pike/Patrick Street.\n\n1858 Bond Atlas Map showing Edw. Buckey along current-day Butterfly Lane. Col. Maulsby was owner of Prospect Hall at this time.\n\nMaryland Union (Jan 5, 1865)\n\nMaryland Union (Feb 16, 1865) Sale of farm and household goods by Edward Buckey\n\nI found that Edward always listed his occupation as that of farmer in census records. He never married and lived on the family homestead and continued farming. He was appointed an officer for the newly formed \"Farmers' Club\" organized on November 22nd, 1849. ​\n\nConstitution and Bylaws Farmers Club Nov, 1849\n\n1850 US Census\n\nWe first see Edward appearing in the 1850 US census living with his mother. This was two years after the death of his father. Meanwhile Edward kept busy with work as one of the trustees of the Methodist Church. He also served a term in the Maryland House of Delegates.\n\nOn January 12th, 1853, \"in obedience to the call of many farmers, there was organized 'The Agricultural Club of Frederick County,' which was to hold annual exhibitions, and monthly meetings for instruction, discussion, etc.\" It adopted the constitution and bylaws of its predecessor, \"the Farmers' Club.\"\n\nResult of Farmers Club Mtg held on April 6, 1853 (Frederick Examiner)\n\n​Not much more would change over the next decade (of the 1850s) as Edward and his mom would still be co-habitating on the family farm a decade later.\n\n1860 US Census showing Edward living with his mother\n\nI found that Edward Buckey did participate in the Mass Union Convention that occurred in Frederick City in March of 1861. This took place at the Frederick County Court House (today's City Hall) just two weeks after President Lincoln's inauguration. Although a slave-holder, Edward's name appears on the famous handbill that listed Frederick citizens supporting the Union and the president. Could he have cast one of those 17 votes for \"Honest Abe?\"\n\nEdward Buckey's name can be found as the 16th name in the second column\n\nAs I said earlier, the Agricultural Exhibition was canceled in 1861 because of the Civil War and primarily because it had lost its location at the Barracks Grounds south of town. Instead of seeking an alternative space, it was best best thought to concentrate on safety. That summer, Frederick would see senators and delegates from around the state come here to participate in sessions of the General Assembly, having been moved from Annapolis. Things were a bit \"too hot and agitated\" in Annapolis with its southern leanings, so the governor proposed Frederick as a conservative temporary home that summer and early fall.\n\nFrederick at the time of the Civil War (looking north over Market Street)\n\nThe following years saw the Maryland Antietam campaign (battles of South Mountain and Antietam) occur in 1862 as already chronicled, and the summer of 1863 brought another major battle just up the road at Gettysburg. Soldiers were plentiful in Frederick before and afterward, but thankfully for Edward these were Union boys. As if the Civil War wasn't stressful and upsetting enough, Edward had an ailing mother to care for. She would pass in March of 1864, and he and his siblings had her body buried in Mount Olivet within the family plot in Area F (#33) where his father was laid to rest in June, 1848.\n\nGrave of Mary (Salmon) Buckey\n\nGrave of Peter Buckey\n\nFour months after his mother died, Edward's farm would be along the route that Confederate Gen. Jubal Early would bring his invading army into Frederick in early July, 1864. The ensuing Battle of Frederick occurred nearby at the vicinity of Linden Hills, and the Battle of Monocacy down at the railroad junction the following day. Throughout this episode, Frederick would be ransomed for $200,000. Thankfully, local banks paid up and the town was spared. Obviously, there would be no fair in the fall 1864, and even though the war ended in April, 1865, the hospital center would still be in use.\n\nI'm curious as to the lack of a fair held in the fall of 1866, but some activity took place the following year that would redefine the annual exhibition that had been sidelined since 1861.\n\nFrederick's Hessian Barracks\n\nNew Home\n\nIn Spring of 1867, the Frederick County Agricultural Society was re-formed with the selling of 139 life membership tickets. After tasking a special committee with finding a new permanent home for the Agricultural Exhibition, the Society purchased 21 acres of land from its own Treasurer, Gen. Edward Shriver, former leader of the Frederick militia that quelled the John Brown raid. A neighbor, and later Society president, William H. Falconer would also sell land for the “new cause.” I also found that Mr. Falconer was also a member of the Mount Olivet Cemetery Board.\n\nBought for $4,500, these properties were located about a half mile east of Frederick on the north side of the Baltimore Turnpike. Almost immediately, substantial buildings were erected and a race course track was laid out. The Frederick Agricultural Grounds now came into being.\n\nTitus Atlas Map (1873)\n\n​Edward was able to complete his term as president with this great accomplishment under his belt. He would turn the reins over to C. Keefer Thomas as Board president. The Ninth Annual Fair of the Frederick County Agricultural Society was held October 12-15th, 1868. Interestingly there was a definitive Civil War theme. The return of livestock was accentuated with a tremendous entry of cattle, sheep and poultry specimens. Fittingly, the guests of honor were national Civil War heroes in the form of President Ulysses S. Grant and Gen. William T. Sherman, among other members of the President’s Cabinet. The president’s visit on the 14th drew a larger than normal audience as was expected, but this added to the greatest attended fair that the county had ever seen.\n\n​\n\n“I have great pleasure in visiting for the first time the city of Frederick of which I have heard so much during the period of the late rebellion, and which, too, stood up manfully for the maintenance of the whole Union. I expected to visit this city some years ago but found myself unable to do so but now have found so many friends, and have been gratified with what I have seen of your Fair and enjoyed of your hospitality, I hope at some future time to visit you again.”\n\nUlysses S. Grant\n\nOctober 14th, 1868\n\n​\n\nPresident Grant and his party dined at the Fairgrounds and watched the newest feature to the Frederick event…harness racing, a horse competition in which the animals race at a specific gait (a trot or a pace) while pulling a two-wheeled cart called a sulky. Among the many trials of speed held during this fair, was a $500 premium that went to the horse “Patchen” from Philadelphia who made the mile in 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Owen Bowie, the Governor of Maryland was also on hand for the 1868 event. An avid horseman and breeder of thoroughbreds, Bowie would be responsible for bringing Pimlico Race Track to the state thanks in part to a successful gambling wager made by himself and associates.\n\n​\n\nPresident Grant would keep his promise, and returned to Frederick and the next fair in October of 1869. In addition to members of his cabinet, a host of former governors and the mayor of Washington D.C., the president was accompanied by the United States Marine Band. From Frederick’s B&O Station on Market Street, the band headed a procession of carriages that carried the distinguished visitors to the fairgrounds. President Grant would visit the fair for two days . ​\n\nIn the years to come, Edward Buckey continued working with the Frederick Agricultural Society and put his efforts toward serving his beloved Methodist Episcopal Church. After settling his deceased mother's estate, the farmstead was sold, and Edward moved in with his widowed sister, Mary (Buckey) Getzendanner and his three nieces in a townhouse located on Frederick's East Church Street.\n\n1870 US Census\n\nEdward Buckey would experience plenty more fairs during the following decade of the 1870s. I'm sure the ten-year anniversaries of the Civil War battles were remembered vividly by the citizenry. Meanwhile the fair grew stronger and larger. Edward Buckey wouldn't live to see the 20th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam in 1882. He had passed nearly a year earlier on October 7th, 1881 at the age of 84. His obituary also provided a first initial of \"J,\" which I hadn't seen before. My money is on \"John\" or \"Jacob.\"\n\nFrederick Examiner (Oct 12, 1881)\n\nThe house where Edward Buckey was living at the time of his death was at what is now 202 East Church St. It belonged to his niece Mary Getzendanner, who bought it in 1865. Interestingly, I lived there in a first floor apartment from 1995-1998. Perhaps we slept in the same bedroom?\n\nIt's a beautiful monument. In need of a good cleaning, yes, and that will come soon. From here on out, when I see this particular gravestone in Mount Olivet, it will surely conjure up thoughts thoughts of four things for me: the Great Frederick Fair, the American Civil War, the Buckey family and my old apartment on Church Street. Every monument in a cemetery has the power to do so, as long as you have the time to research the life of the decedent further.\n\n202 E Church St was the last residence of Edward Buckey (red brick building two doors east of Chapel Alley)\n\nSo, we had a little “fun run” in Mount Olivet back on Thursday evening, August 24th. This event was put on with the help of two, local partners, and supported our ongoing preservation efforts by the Friends of Mount Olivet membership group. One of these partners was Charm City Run, a running & walking specialty company with one of its eight retail locations here in Frederick. In addition to helping guide us in this particular endeavor, Charm City sells shoes with personalized fittings and various other necessities for runners from apparel to athletic gear. The group handled the technical logistics of the course through our “garden cemetery,” along with aspects of marketing and execution of the run.\n\nCapped at 75 runners and called “The Distillery Dash,” $750 was raised through entry fees, and Charm City Run matched the amount thus creating a total donation to our FOMO group of $1,500. This money will go to the continued repair and restoration of old and ailing monuments in our historic section as I’ve discussed before within this blog.\n\n​Yours truly shook off the rust, and participated in the 2-mile run around the cemetery. It wasn’t my first rodeo, and I finished with no incident. I quite enjoyed the opportunity to participate with others in this “fun run” format. I, however, did not enjoy being taunted by my 17-year-old son who made the point several times over that he finished minutes ahead of me. Since it was not an official timed event, I reminded him that the only way he could have beaten me is if he actually had considerably more fun than me, since it was marketed as a “fun run.”\n\n​That brings me to our second partner, and an explanation for the name “Distillery Dash.” This was McClintock Distilling, a relatively new craft distillery of over six years in town located between West Patrick Street and Carroll Creek. It can be accessed from Carroll Street in the historic confines of the old Ideal Buick Garage location of the early 20th century. The firm distills vodka, gin and whiskeys from 100% organic grains and features tours and tastings at their location showing mastery of adaptive re-use architectural practices.\n\nAfter-race party at the McClintock Back Bar\n\nI soon learned for myself that McClintock’s “tasting room,” along with others of its ilk in downtown Frederick, is a popular spot for the running set including recreational joggers, competitive sprinters and awe-inspiring marathoners. Of greater interest, I soon realized that Mount Olivet is also a favorite recreational destination for the local running community to traverse with its peaceful and contemplative surroundings bisected by eight miles of roadway.\n\n​\n\nSo that covers the purpose, and name, for “the Distillery Dash,” but where does the name McClintock come from? You will soon learn that it is a moniker as inventive as its namesake— the glue, or elixir, that holds all of this together.\n\n​McClintock Young was a former resident of Frederick, and long-time resident of Mount Olivet, buried in 1913. He is a very interesting figure to study in context to the annals of Frederick history. Mr. Young holds the distinction of being a successful businessman, but is commonly heralded as Frederick’s greatest inventor. At the time of his death in 1913, he had filed over 100 patents for his creations. He would be responsible, in part, for giving work to hundreds of local residents thanks to his inventive genius.\n\n​McClintock Young, Jr. was born June 25th, 1836 in Washington, D.C. Here is where he lived his early years, and began his scholastic career. Our subject’s father, McClintock Young, Sr. (1801-1863), was a politician and received an appointment to the position of Chief Clerk of the United States Treasury. He would be called upon to be Acting Director of the Treasury several times during the Andrew Jackson administration. Ironically, the senior Mr. Young briefly worked under short-lived Secretary of the Treasury, Roger Brooke Taney, whose wife and three daughters are buried in Mount Olivet’s gated Potts lot.\n\n​\n\nMcClintock’s mother, Susan Bird Newman (1805-1836), was the daughter of Col. Francis Newman of England, and she hailed from Upper Marlboro in Charles County, Maryland. Her father had given up a baronetcy back home in favor of American citizenship (c. 1800). Mr. Newman served as a colonel in the War of 1812 and afterwards became a revenue collector for Washington D.C.\n\nHannah Fryers Newman (1779-1855)\n\nCol. Francis Newman (1759-1818)\n\n​The progenitor of the Young family was McClintock’s paternal grandfather, Hugh Young, a Scotch-Irishman and resident of Londonderry, Ireland. He was implicated in the rebellion of 1798, and to escape persecution, fled to the United States in that year, and settled in Baltimore, where he would spend the remainder of his life. He was a great admirer of Andrew Jackson, and is said to have entertained the rough and tumble president in his home in “Charm City.”\n\nInterestingly, Hugh’s son, McClintock Young (Sr.), would be appointed chief clerk of the United States Treasury by Andrew Jackson, a position Young, Sr. would retain for a number of years as mentioned earlier. McClintock, Sr. and wife Susan had two boys, McClintock, Jr. (b. 1836) and Alexander (b. 1830-1862).\n\nTaney may have influenced the elder McClintock Young to send his sons to Frederick to attend the Frederick Academy (also called Boy’s High School), once located on Council Street. Both boys can be found living here in town within a boarding house run by a lady named Teresa Jamison in the year 1850. This is thought to have been on East Second Street.\n\nThe Young brothers in the 1850 US Census living in Frederick\n\n​McClintock Young, Jr. was a tinkerer from a “young” age. In 1849, at 12 years-old, he constructed a fire engine that could throw a stream of water more than 40 feet in the air. He did this without the aid of technical or mechanical training. McClintock, Jr. went on to attend St. John’s College in Annapolis, and receive teaching from Benjamin Hallowell (1799-1870) who had opened a boarding school in Alexandria, VA. Mr. Hallowell had quite a reputation, and one of his former students was Robert E. Lee. Mr. Hallowell went on to be the first president of the Maryland Agricultural College, later to change its name to the University of Maryland.\n\nBenjamin Hallowell (left) and the Hallowell School in Annapolis (above)\n\n​McClintock Young, Jr. opened a foundry in Frederick on the east end of Patrick Street adjacent the bridge that crosses Carroll Creek. He engaged in the agricultural implement and machinery business from 1856-1870 with a business name of the Vulcan Iron Works, originally started with partner Ezra Doub. In the early 1860s, Young was running the Vulcan Works by himself and produced items such as stoves and related items. The partnership dissolved by century's end, as Mr. Young began getting noticed for his success in gaining patents for new inventions.\n\nMaryland Union (May 12, 1858)\n\n​Along the way, McClintock Young married Louisa Mary Mobberly of New Market in 1862 and started a family. She was a relative of Frederick Revolutionary War hero, et al. Thomas Johnson, Jr.\n\n1870 US Census\n\nWashington DC Daily Morning Herald (April 11, 1873)\n\n​Young continued to make the world better through mechanized means, earning patents for steam engines, saw mills, and sewing machines. He also designed such useful things as a box-making machine and an ink eraser. His big invention came with a “self-rake” mechanism that he sold to the McCormick Harvester Company. This would remain a pivotal part of the firm’s famed reaper machines for more than half of a century.\n\nMaryland Union (Sept 2, 1858)\n\nFrederick Examiner (June 11, 1863)\n\nMaryland Union (Sept 7, 1859)\n\nFrederick Examiner (June 11, 1862)\n\nIt's not quite known how McClintock spent the American Civil War in Frederick, a definitive crossroads of war. He registered for service as was mandatory, however did not serve. Meanwhile, his brother died as a result of the conflict. Alexander served with the Confederacy and was killed above Richmond (VA) at the Battle of Hanover Courthouse on May 27th, 1862. McClintock’s father would die less than a year later in early May, 1863. He is buried in a crypt in Washington, D.C.’s impressive Congressional Cemetery.\n\nYoung brothers Civil War registration\n\nThe Causten Family Crypt, final resting place of McClintock Young, Sr. at Washington's Congressional Cemetery\n\n​McClintock Young's wife, Louise, bought the property that is today labeled as 124 North Court Street in 1865. The family would live here, and a lasting reminder can be found directly across the street in the form of a coal chute cover with McClintock’s name as a maker’s mark.\n\nSadly, the Young’s first two children died in infancy: Louisa Newman (1870) and McClintock Young (1868)\n\nGravestone of McClintock Young's children who died young (Louisa and McClintock)\n\n​McClintock Young would earn a great payday in 1870 from the Diamond Match Company, who purchased his patent for an automated match-making machine. This mechanism cut splints from a block of wood, spaced for dipping without shifting the block or cutters, and stuck them into the holes of a perforated plate, in which condition they were dipped in the composition, and, when sufficiently dry, pushed out by small punches, corresponding to the holes in the plates.\n\n​Young also invented machines to manufacture hinges, and, (previous to 1870) obtained several patents including such things as knife sharpeners and others covering the principles of the modern bicycle with pedals powering rear wheels instead of the existing early technology of the late 1800s featuring “front-wheel drive.”\n\nMaryland Union (Aug 1, 1867)\n\n​Meanwhile, a unique relationship grew between McClintock Young and executives of the Diamond Company. One such was John K. Robinson, the primary founder of the Palmetto Brush Company here in Frederick in 1886. Young had come up with a machine that could turn palm trees into scrub brushes, and would design several more variations on his original.\n\nFormerly, this trade had to be performed by hand. McClintock’s invention spaced, bored, inclined and tufted the holes automatically, allowing each tuft (of brush bristle) to be secured by a wire staple. Two machines of this type, run by one operator, could create 70,000 tufts in 10 hours.\n\n​\n\nMcClintock Young’s original foundry location on South Street soon became the home of the Ox Fibre Brush Company, with McClintock being named company vice president. Due to the business’ great success with customers here and abroad, a new plant would be built on East Church Street extended.\n\nMcClintock's brush machine used by the Ox-Fibre Company\n\nOx-Fibre (c. 1909) on East Church St. extended\n\n1905 advertisement for Ox-Fibre brushes\n\n​Young’s “brush with success” led to him being well respected here, and elsewhere, throughout his life. He traveled abroad to Canada and England to patent his inventions interantionally. McClintock Young labored, so others would not have to in the manufacture of products that would further assist the laborer. At a time when there were few sports and entertainment stars, an inventor of his reputation carried a level of celebrity and was revered by colleagues and neighbors alike.\n\n​\n\nAside from that, Young was highly involved in the civic and fraternal clubs of town. He was an active Mason, and member of All Saints’ Protestant Episcopal Church. Most importantly, he was said to have been a stellar parent, raising three daughters into adulthood, especially challenging after his wife died in 1886. These included: Helen Young (married Baker Johnson), Elizabeth Bird Young (married Dr. Arthur Williams), and Eloise Newman English (married Arthur English). One thing that brought great happiness to Frederick’s grand inventor was the time he spent at his mountain cabin.\n\n​This retreat was procured before the conception of the resort colony at Braddock Heights thanks to another brilliant innovation started in Frederick by George William Smith with his interurban trolley system (the Frederick & Middletown Railway) in 1896.\n\nOf course, that particular area was made famous and took its name from Braddock Spring, once used supposedly by British Gen. Edward Braddock in 1755. Keeping a spring-like theme, McClintock’s cabin was located in the Bootjack Springs area northwest of Frederick City, mountain land wedged between Yellow Springs and Indian Springs, both having roads named for them.\n\n​\n\nI, myself, grew up just below said cabin in the Bootjack Springs Estates. My father even hung an antique bootjack in our house’s central hallway. The bootjack was more commonly used in earlier times by gentlemen to assist in the removal of boots. I don’t know how the Bootjack Springs area got its name for sure, but I was once told that the land parcel (that contained the principal spring of this vicinity), was shaped much like a bootjack. I recently learned that one of McClintock Distilling's signature concoctions is \"Bootjack Rye Whiskey.\"\n\nIt’s hard to keep a good man down, but the brilliant light within McClintock Young, Jr. finally faded on August 1st, 1913. Supposedly, a three-year illness was to blame for his demise at the age of 77, his troubles were initiated, in part, years earlier by a severe fall from a horse in November,1913.\n\nMcClintock would be buried in Mount Olivet next to his wife Louisa in Area H/Lot 483. McClintock Young’s funeral was well attended by a great number of family, friends and admirers.\n\nFrederick News (Aug 2, 1913)\n\neditorial in the Frederick News (Aug 2, 1913)\n\nThe Ox-Fibre Company would long \"outlive\" Mr. Young into the mid-1900s. In 1912, just before McClintock's death, the company apparently foiled a plot to place a spy among its workers and steal plans for McClintock Young's patented machines. This location would later serve home to Goodwill Industries, and now is the site of luxury apartments.\n\n​I recently learned through the writings of a man married to a descendant of McClintock Young. This man is named Robert K. Guthrie. During the time of the inventor’s infirm state, the Ox-Fibre Brush Company re-incorporated the business to Delaware. To this day, his family believes that the company and his related amazing inventions were stolen from him.\n\nMcClintock Young and his dog from Robert K. Guthrie's book \"Til Death Do Us Part\" about McClintock's daughter Eloise English\n\nBeing familiar with the photo to the left, this clipping from the Baltimore Sun and dated Nov 9, 1906) brought particular interest to me. This event occurred months after McClintock's accident in May, 1906 which left him with a broken leg.\n\n​McClintock’s daughters sold his house on North Court Street in 1914. However, Eloise would receive the mountain cabin as a gift from her father. It would be the setting for a major event in the life of Eloise and her children three years after McClintock’s passing. I wrote about this in “Stories in Stone,” under the title \"Auld Lang Syne and the Inventor's Daughter\" for one of my first blog pieces in which I had wanted to chronicle the life of this special man. It’s now taken me six and a half years to finally follow through.\n\n​However, I only have one thing to say—researching and presenting history is not a race, but more like a \"fun-run.\" As long as you make it to the finish line, and have enjoy the pursuit and learning along the way, that’s all that matters. I do, however, now suddenly feel the need for a nice drink for my labors as we enter Labor Day weekend of 2023. Perhaps I can find something with Bootjack Rye Whiskey so I can salute the old inventor, himself.\n\nThe family lot in Mount Olivet's Area H is not far from Confederate Row on the cemetery's west side. It holds the remains of McClintock, wife Louisa who predeceased him, along with his two infant children (McClintock and Louisa) that passed in the late 1850s. Daughters Helen and Eloise are also buried here, along with three of Eloise' children, and another from Helen.\n\nBy design, the finish of the recent fun run was placed just past McClintock's gravesite. Participants paid their respects, to a man who certainly used his time here in Frederick, and on Earth, to its fullest. Thank you McClintock Young, and thanks Charm City and McClintock for your kind support of our ongoing historic preservation of Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE: Special thanks to Coach Kristen Watkins of Charm City Run for her work in pulling us all together. This was certainly a reverent and inventive endeavor that benefits our cemetery in many ways.\n\nOne thing you will surely find in a cemetery are dates. Now I'm talking day of the month and year here, certainly not a social or romantic appointment (date). Birth and death dates are evident by the tens of thousands on the faces of marble and granite gravestones, or etched upon bronze plaques. Our cemetery records are filled with the same, and also include burial dates of those interred here as well.\n\nWe can't promise that all are correct, but it's certainly our hope. Where a cemetery can generally guarantee a burial date's accuracy, and obituaries can be researched for proper death dates, birth dates of early decedents can sometimes be problematic. In many cases, these were provided by family members and associates, leaving room for error when no birth certificate or church record/family Bible entry was ever made.\n\nThe date of August 9th is an important one this year for Mount Olivet Cemetery. It marks something a little bit different for us, in addition to supposedly being a famous decedent's birthday. In this particular case, this day marks the official unveiling and dedication date of a magnificent monument at Mount Olivet. The year was 1898, and this was no ordinary tombstone—no sir! This is the most famous gravemarker and site in a cemetery containing over 41,000 souls, so to speak. I'm talking about Francis Scott Key--\n\nauthor of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nFor this article, we are more interested in the monument itself, and the day of its official unveiling moreso than Francis Scott Key the man, lawyer, songwriter, and patriot. It is an inaugural member of our Mount Olivet \"Monument Hall of Fame,\" and got there easily through its merit as a true work of art. Interestingly, the monument's namesake, Mr. Key, had been dead for 55 years already before its placement. \"Better late than never\" I guess, as they say.\n\nI'm not overly interested in re-hashing the history of Francis Scott Key (1779-1843), or how he came to write his song in Baltimore Harbor during a 27-hour bombardment of Fort McHenry in September, 1814, here in this particular article. You can find that saga on another page of this very website. Interestingly, this story has been told at the Key monument site in Mount Olivet hundreds, perhaps thousands of times since the mid-19th century. Eager ears have included school children, tour groups and senior center outing participants. I know this from first-hand experience, because I am among the latest to do so over the last two decades. I've also had the good fortune to share FSK's story at special commemorations at the monument site including such events as the annual Memorial Day ceremony put on by the American Legion, and our local Francis Scott Key Post #11.\n\nFrancis Scott Key\n\n\"O' say can you see?\"\n\nIn the last 40 years, we've had some great events here. In 1987, the monument was refurbished, its bronze figures having been tarnished over its first 89 years. Worse than the outer appearance of these sculptures, was the internal rust and corrosion that was happening, as the infrastructure was fast deteriorating. The multiple sculptures were sent to the studio of Eleftherios Karkadoulias in Cincinnati, Ohio. One of the top bronze sculptors and restoration artists in the country, Mr. Karkadoulis did an amazing job and the statuary figures were put back in place \"as good as new.\" A fine event was held by the Francis Scott Key Memorial Foundation to welcome them home after an 8-month sojourn to the midwest.\n\nThe monument's bronze figures were looking quite tarnished by the 1970s\n\nIn 1998, Frederick County celebrated its 250th anniversary. One of the signature events of that year took place here in Mount Olivet as citizens commemorated the 100th anniversary of the original unveiling of the monument on August 9th, 1898. It was a fine event, full of pomp and circumstance.\n\nThe Columbia statue at the base of the monument is packed in a U-haul trailer bound for Cincinnati with MOC Foreman Tyrone Hurley\n\nRededication program 1987\n\nMount Olivet superintendent Ron Pearcey (left) and Mr. Karkadoulias (center) inspect the poor condition of Francis Scott Key's \"pointing arm\" while at the Karkadoulias Studio in Cincinnati (1987)\n\nFront page newspaper clipping from the Key Monument Centennial commemoration in 1998 from Frederick News-Post edition of August 10th, 1898\n\nIn more recent history, two events were held in 2013 and 2014 to celebrate the bicentennial of the Battle of Baltimore and the writing of \"the Star-Spangled Banner\" as a major part of Maryland commemorative activities associated with the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. We marketed these as \"Anthem & Author Reunited\" and \"Home of the Brave.\"\n\nI worked for the Tourism Council of Frederick County at the time and we worked in advance to make sure that visitors would have products here in Frederick to assist in interpreting Francis Scott Key's connection and ties to town. This came in the form of interpretive displays, with Mount Olivet Cemetery being our prime location to tell his story. We also concocted a great scheme in taking the unique opportunity to bring Key's original song manuscript to his former hometown.\n\nKnowing that the latter task would be nearly impossible in the actual anniversary year of 2014, our local planning committee set its aims on obtaining the document for Flag Day, 2013. In case you didn't know, Key's \"Star-Spangled Banner\" manuscript resides at the Maryland Historical Society. We knew it would be displayed at Fort McHenry during the anniversary.\n\nPermissions and grant funding (for transport and security) were obtained and the 2013 \"Anthem & Author Reunited\" event became a reality for a special three-day commemoration in mid-June a decade ago. The priceless document was brought to Frederick, where it first went on public display at Frederick City Hall on Friday the 12th. Here, thousands of visitors had the opportunity to view the document under glass as it \"laid in state\" within the first floor hearing room under the watchful eye of a ceremonial guard provided by both Frederick City Police, The Frederick County Sheriff's Office and Maryland State Police. The latter held the role of escorting Key's manuscript to Frederick from \"Charm City.\"\n\nVisitors eager to see the original \"Star-Spangled Banner\" manuscript in line outside Frederick City Hall on June 12th, 2013. (below photo) The City Hall public hearing room where the document was on display until Sunday, June 14th when it was brought to Mount Olivet.\n\nVarious activities throughout the three-day event ushered in a new collection of interpretive panels placed around Frederick City to help explain Francis Scott Key's importance here as the third point of a \"Key Heritage Triangle,\" if you will. Baltimore is the home of Fort McHenry and the manuscript, and Washington, DC served as residence and primary employment site to Key in adult life and the Smithsonian Museum of American History is the site where you can find the original flag that flew over Fort McHenry on that fateful day of September 14th, 1814. But little old Frederick and Mount Olivet hold the literal, and figurative, \"key\" to the story, as the first, and eternal, home of the author. This is also where he started his highly successful law career.\n\nInterpretive exhibits, skillfully produced with the help of David Guiney (Interpretive Direction), Ruth Bielobocky (Iondesign) and artist Richard Schlecht were unveiled all over town at places such as Courthouse Square, the Hessian Barracks (Maryland School for the Deaf), Harry Grove Stadium, and the Frederick Visitor Center where the exhibit enshrines one of the legendary British bombs that \"bursted in air.\" These would be unveiled in separate ceremonies on that opening day of the 2013 celebration, and on Saturday the 13th.\n\nCourt House Square was the site of FSK's first court appearances (c. 1801)\n\nFrederick's Hessian Barracks saw plenty of 1812 troops, as well as having its original ties to the American Revolution for which it was built\n\nFrederick Visitor exhibit contains a shell fragment excavated at Baltimore's Fort McHenry\n\nThe grand finale occurred at Mount Olivet Cemetery on Flag Day itself as the manuscript was mightily escorted through the streets of Frederick by the US Army's ceremonial Old Guard Unit, aka the 3rd U.S. Infantry. You may know them from their work with memorial affairs missions, most notably funerals and ceremonies held at Arlington Cemetery. On this day in June, 2013, the contingent made quite a scene as they marched from Frederick City Hall through a number of city streets before turning down South Market and into the cemetery's front gate. The soldiers stood at attention in front of the Key Monument as the original manuscript came as close as possible to its original author. An estimated 1000 spectators were on hand. If you believe in spirits and the afterlife, I would guarantee that Francis Scott Key was smiling down with greatest admiration on the scene that day. But there were others as well.\n\nSuperintedent Ron Pearcey and Col. George Lewis oversee the ceremonial flag-raising for the \"Anthem & Author\" event. This flag was flown over Fort McHenry a few days earlier.\n\nThe Fort McHenry Guard performed at the \"Anthem & Author Reunited\" event\n\nProfessional opera singer (and Gov. Thomas Johnson High School alum) Tracey Luck sang \"the Star-Spangled Banner\" at the monument (June 14, 2013)\n\nA few more \"banner\" days that brought smiles to more than just Francis Scott Key were September 13th and 14th, 2014. This was the anniversary of the Battle of Baltimore and the event titled \"Home of the Brave.\" We not only celebrated Key on that day, but also those who he said to have been the true inspiration for his writing of the song originally entitled \"The Defense of Fort McHenry.\" While visiting Frederick on August 6th, 1834, Francis Scott Key made a speech at Courthouse Square during a large ceremonial banquet. Many veterans of the War of 1812 were in the audience and this would be one of a few rare occasions in which Key discussed his remembrances associated with writing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Key would give credit to these former soldiers:\n\n\"The song, I know, came from the heart, and if it has made its way to the hearts of men, whose devotion to their country and the great cause of freedom I know so well, I could not pretend to be insensible to such a compliment.\n\nWith it came an inspiration not to be resisted; and even though it had been a hanging matter to make a song, I must have written it.Let the praise, then, if any be due, be given not to me, who only did what I could not help doing; not to the writer, but to the inspirers of the song!”\n\n…I again thank you for the honor you have done me; but I can only take the share of it. I was but the instrument in executing what you have been so pleased to praise; it was dictated and inspired by the gallantry and patriotism of the sons of Maryland. The honor is due, not to me who made the song, but to the heroism of those who made me make it…\"\n\nWe have 109 of those War of 1812 veterans buried here in Mount Olivet, the second highest concentration of 1812 soldiers in all of Maryland, second only to Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore. We used the occasion to properly mark these men with special plaques found throughout our grounds and made possible thanks to funding from the Maryland State War of 1812 Commission and the Francis Scott Key Memorial Foundation.\n\nThe cemetery hosted a two-part commemoration at the Key monument including a Saturday night luminary event recognizing those very 1812 vets called out by Francis Scott Key at that 1834 event at the courthouse. Boy Scouts with Tiki torches were positioned at the 109 graves of 1812 veterans in Mount Olivet, and a procession led by horse and carriage winded its way through the cemetery making 15 stops to here from re-enactors portraying former Frederick residents at their respective gravesites. This was followed by a solemn roll call of their names, capped with a fine fireworks display at Grove Stadium behind the silhouette of Francis Scott Key atop the monument.\n\nThe next morning at sunrise, a choir sang all four stanzas of the national anthem, and a crowd of 300 were entertained by re-enactors depicting Francis Scott Key, Abraham Lincoln and James Monroe.\n\nA Francis Scott Key living historian speaks at \"Home of the Brave\" (Sept. 14, 2014)\n\nLooking back, these events were quite memorable and I consider myself so very lucky to have participated in the planning and execution of a few of them. the lasting legacy of course is the interpretive exhibits left behind in the form of NPS-standard tabletop information displays. Mount Olivet was the recipient of a few of these as well, and they continue to assist tourists that come each and everyday to learn more about the man responsible for writing our national anthem, and taking their selfie with Frederick's most famous monument.\n\nThe author (left) and Mount Olivet superintendent Ron Pearcey (right) stand by one of the newly installed interpretive exhibits in September, 2014.\n\nSpeaking of which, none of the events just recounted compare to the grand excitement generated back in 1898 when the monument was first revealed to an audience of thousands.\n\nI want to tell you about the genesis of the monument itself, and how it came to be. A good starting place is the 1860s and the American Civil War. Fifty years after its initial writing, there was not an opportunity to celebrate \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" with a fancy commemoration. You may recall that Baltimore was under martial law. Meanwhile, here in Frederick, on September 14th of 1864, the feeling was more one of relief than nostalgic patriotism as we had just witnessed a small skirmish west of town on July 8th, and a day later, a full-pitched battle down at Monocacy Junction, south of town. In fact, we were lucky that the banks paid a ransom levied by Confederate Gen. Jubal Early, keeping our town intact and not in ruin by the torch. Just ask nearby Chambersburg, Pennsylvania how they were feeling after their town was burned to the ground in the early morning hours of July 30th.\n\nThe song and its author were re-remembered however through the war. Union military bands and musicians, in search of patriotic music, curiously blew the dust off the sheet music of the old song, and it became an instant favorite of both the players as well as the rank and file themselves. By war's end, the song had regained the interest, and adoration (at least in the north), as it had first enjoyed in 1814. People of Frederick began recalling the Key family and in particular, Francis' time spent here as a youth, and again as a fledgling lawyer. This led citizens to ask if Key was still alive, or not? When realizing he had died in 1843, folks began to search for his gravesite, ultimately disappointed to learn that he was reposing in Baltimore and not Frederick. Many questioned why he was not buried in our beautiful new garden cemetery of Mount Olivet?\n\nThe answer was simple —at the time of Key's death, there was no Mount Olivet. This land, south of downtown Frederick City, was nothing more than rolling farmland along the"
