        "text": "An Evening Without Cary Grant – with J Douglas Miller\n\nZoom, Sunday 29 November 2020, 7.30pm GMT\n\nTHIS EVENT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED\n\nOn the anniversary of Cary Grant’s death we discuss his last day in Davenport Iowa with J Douglas Miller who was there.*\n\nOn 29 November 1986, Cary Grant died in Davenport Iowa on tour with his A Conversation With Cary Grant show. Join Cary Comes Home Festival director Charlotte Crofts for an informal chat with J Douglas Miller who was there, to mark Cary Grant’s death anniversary and how our plans to take the festival to Iowa have been delayed by the global pandemic.\n\nAccording to Scott Eyman (2020), ‘Cary Grant typed out his wishes for his funeral in capital letters: “LIKE GROUCHO MARX I AM ADAMANT ABOUT NOT WANTING EITHER FLOWERS OR EULOGIES WHEN I’M GONE”‘\n\nSo, we don’t get too sentimental, but we do light a candle and have a moment to pay our respects to the “best and most important actor in the history of Cinema” (David Thomson).\n\n*Due to a technical hitch Douglas had to dial in via phone but you can hear him load and clear.\n\nWhat is “Pay what you feel”?\n\nWe want to make our events accessible whatever your budget, but for those that can afford it, we’d really appreciate it if you can give generously to keep the festival afloat in these difficult times.\n\nWe rely on ticket sales as our main source of income, but Covid-19 has made this impossible this year, creating a huge shortfall in our finances. We’re a biennial festival so we’re hoping by 2022 we’ll be able to return to live events, but in the meantime we’re determined to celebrate Cary Grant as best we can virtually. If you’ve enjoyed watching this event, please consider donating.\n\nYou might also be interested in….\n\nCelebrating Bristol’s status as a UNESCO City of Film, in recognition of the city’s vibrant screen heritage, of which Cary Grant is one of our brightest stars."
