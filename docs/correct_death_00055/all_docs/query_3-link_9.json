        "text": "On a recent damp spring morning, I stopped by Davenport's Oakdale Memorial Gardens in search of the grave of a man I'd recently read and written about, Ernest Oberholtzer.\n\nAt the cemetery office, manager Deb Millhollin gave me a map and directions to the cemetery's oldest section. Eventually I located the grave I was looking for, but before I did, I bumped into -- figuratively speaking, anyway -- many well-known folks.\n\nAll around me were the final resting places of people I'd read and heard so much about while growing up in the Quad-Cities: Bix Beiderbecke, Nicholas Fejervary and Phoebe Sudlow, among others. There were the family plots for the Davenports, the Bettendorfs, the Putnams and the Von Maurs. If I'd had time to venture into other sections, I'd have been able to rub granite with author Octave Thanet (Alice French), artist Paul Norton and chiropractic pioneer David Palmer.\n\nThe list went on and on -- a virtual Who Was Who of the famous dead of the Quad-Cities.\n\nOakdale Memorial Gardens opened in 1857 and is one of the oldest cemeteries in the Quad-Cities. In it -- as well as in City, Pine Hill and Mount Calvary cemeteries in Davenport, Chippiannock Cemetery in Rock Island and Riverside Cemetery in Moline -- Quad-Citians can get as up close and personal as is humanly possible with many of our famous forefathers.\n\nIf you're in the mood to pay a visit this Memorial Day weekend, well, join the crowd.\n\n``We still have the most visitors to the cemetery this weekend,'' said Ms. Millhollin. ``This is like our Christmastime.''\n\nThe most-visited grave?\n\n``Most of the visitors are for Bix,'' said Ms. Millhollin. ``Then it's the Civil War people.'' (Three Union brigadier generals and the recipient of a Civil War Medal of Honor are buried here.) ``We get a lot of visitors.''\n\nAs for Mr. Oberholtzer -- a canoe explorer and early environmentalist -- ``he's gotten really popular here,'' said Ms. Millhollin.\n\nIt actually took me two trips to find Mr. Oberholtzer's grave -- partly because I was sidetracked by the other graves and partly because, even with a map, finding an old grave in an old cemetery can be difficult.\n\nArmed with a vague reference to the location of Ober's grave that I'd read in a book, I returned, hoping for some type of intervention to guide me. As I approached what I thought might be the area of his plot, I flushed a lone robin from the ground. It flew ahead of me about 60 feet and briefly lighted on a gravestone. As I got nearer to this stone, I could read the inscription ``Atisokan'' -- the Indian name given to Mr. Oberholtzer by the Ojibwe people he befriended.\n\nI stood for a while before the grave and pondered the serenity. Not a bad place to rest in eternity, I decided. Such an outcome still is an option for those who want to be buried alongside the area's rich and historically famous.\n\n``Everyone thinks that our cemetery's full, but we're only half full, so if they want to be buried with the pioneer families of the Quad-Cities, there is plenty of space available,'' said Ms. Millhollin.\n\nWho Was Who and where to find them\n\nHere's a list of some of the historically famous people of the Quad-Cities and where to find them this Memorial Day weekend -- or any weekend, for that matter.\n\n--Chippiannock Cemetery, Rock Island: Col. George Davenport (veteran of the War of 1812, who was murdered in his home on what is now Arsenal Island); Ben Harper (former mayor of Rock Island, whose Harper House Hotel was said to have been the most luxurious hotel west of Chicago); Frederick Weyerhaeuser (lumber magnate); C.C. Knell (invented America's first easy chair).\n\n--Mount Calvary Cemetery, Davenport: Antoine LeClaire (co-founder of the city of Davenport); Hal Skelly (stage and screen actor); John McMullen (first bishop of the Diocese of Davenport and founder of St. Ambrose University).\n\n--National Cemetery, Arsenal Island: Gen. Thomas Jackson Rodman (Civil War officer and commanding officer of the Rock Island Arsenal from 1865 until his death in 1871).\n\n--Oakdale Cemetery, Davenport: Bix Beiderbecke (jazz legend); Joseph and William Bettendorf (co-founders of Bettendorf Axle Company); George C. Davenport (Col. George Davenport's son); Jacob M. Eldridge (pioneer and namesake of the city of Eldridge); Nicholas Fejervary (pioneer settler whose homestead is now a park); Arthur Davison Ficke (poet and friend and lover of poet Edna St. Vincent Millay); Paul N. Norton (nationally known watercolor artist); Mary Louisa Duncan Putnam (scientific publisher and historian); Phoebe Sudlow (first female public-school teacher in the United States); and Alice French (under the pen name Octave Thanet, a well-known author of the late 1800s/early 1900s).\n\n--Riverside Cemetery, Moline: John Deere (founder of Deere & Co.) and his family; W.L. Velie (automotive manufacturer); Warren Giles (former National League baseball president); Francis Jeffrey Dickens (son of author Charles Dickens).\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n1\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
