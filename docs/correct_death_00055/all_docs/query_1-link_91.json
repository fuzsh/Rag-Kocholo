        "text": "Today in History\n\nToday is Wednesday, Nov. 29, the 333rd day of 2023. There are 32 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn Nov. 29, 1981, film star Natalie Wood drowned at age 43 while boating off California’s Santa Catalina Island with her her actor husband Robert Wagner and actor Christopher Walken.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1864, a Colorado militia killed at least 150 peaceful Cheyenne Indians in the Sand Creek Massacre.\n\nIn 1910, British explorer Robert F. Scott’s ship Terra Nova set sail from New Zealand, carrying Scott’s expedition on its ultimately futile — as well as fatal — race to reach the South Pole first.\n\nIn 1924, Italian composer Giacomo Puccini died in Brussels before he could complete his opera “Turandot.” (It was finished by Franco Alfano.)\n\nIn 1929, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Richard E. Byrd, pilot Bernt Balchen, radio operator Harold June and photographer Ashley McKinney made the first airplane flight over the South Pole.\n\nIn 1947, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the partitioning of Palestine between Arabs and Jews; 33 members, including the United States, voted in favor of the resolution, 13 voted against while 10 abstained. (The plan, rejected by the Arabs, was never implemented.)\n\nIn 1961, Enos the chimp was launched from Cape Canaveral aboard the Mercury-Atlas 5 spacecraft, which orbited earth twice before returning.\n\nIn 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson named a commission headed by Earl Warren to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn 1986, actor Cary Grant died in Davenport, Iowa, at age 82.\n\nIn 1987, a Korean Air 707 jetliner en route from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok was destroyed by a bomb planted by North Korean agents with the loss of all 115 people aboard.\n\nIn 2001, former Beatle George Harrison died in Los Angeles following a battle with cancer; he was 58.\n\nIn 2008, Indian commandos killed the last remaining gunmen holed up at a luxury Mumbai hotel, ending a 60-hour rampage through India’s financial capital by suspected Pakistani-based militants that killed 166 people.\n\nIn 2012, the United Nations voted overwhelmingly to recognize a Palestinian state, a vote that came exactly 65 years after the General Assembly adopted a plan to divide Palestine into separate states for Jews and Arabs. (The 2012 vote was 138 in favor; nine members, including the United States, voted against and 41 abstained.)\n\nIn 2013, a police helicopter crashed onto a pub in Glasgow, Scotland, killing 10 people.\n\nIn 2017, “Today” host Matt Lauer was fired for what NBC called “inappropriate sexual behavior” with a colleague; a published report accused him of crude and habitual misconduct with women around the office.\n\nIn 2018, in a surprise guilty plea, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen confessed that he lied to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal he pursued on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that New York City would reopen its school system to in-person learning, and increase the number of days a week many children attend class, even as the coronavirus pandemic intensified in the city.\n\nIn 2021, a federal judge blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a coronavirus vaccine mandate on thousands of health care workers in 10 states that had brought the first legal challenge against the requirement.\n\nIn 2022, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy for a violent plot to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential win, handing the Justice Department a major victory in its massive prosecution of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Blues singer-musician John Mayall is 90.
