        "text": "The Movie Colony estate that once belonged to Oscar-winning actor Cary Grant has sold for $3,400,001, to someone \"well known\" in the entertainment industry, listing agent Eric Lavey told The Desert Sun, remaining tight-lipped on identifying the person by name.\n\nThe sellers received multiple offers on the 1.5-acre property and the sale closed Wednesday, Lavey said.\n\n\"I can tell you right now, there is a strong demand for historical properties in Palm Springs specifically,\" said Lavey, an agent with Beverly Hills-based brokerage The Agency.\n\nLavey said a number of local agents told him the house was overpriced. It sold for $95,000 under list price, or about 97 percent of the $3.495 million asking price.\n\n\"Both of these buyers (who made offers) were L.A.-New York people, bicoastal, they were both in entertainment,\" Lavey said. \"Like I say, we're the West Coast Hamptons. Palm Springs is on the map for big sales.\"\n\nCELEBRITY REAL ESTATE: Visit the Dinah Shore house, now Leonardo DiCaprio's\n\nSTEPHAN'S FOLLY: Red velvet-covered 'time capsule' asks $864K\n\nThe sprawling property just west of Ruth Hardy Park features a 5,300-square-foot Spanish Andalusian farmhouse designed by Spanish Colonial revivalist John Byers, AIA, and built in 1930.\n\nGrant bought the house in 1954, and frequent visitors included Alfred Hitchcock, Grace Kelly, Katharine Hepburn and Clark Gable, according to local lore.\n\nTwo decades later, the six-bed, six-bath property passed to local doctor Lewis Baldwin and then to bodybuilder Frank Zane, who turned it into a private health resort for about a decade. According to a website the most recent owners maintained for the property, Jane Smith purchased it in 1988, undertook its renovation and spearheaded its application for Palm Springs Class I Historic Site status.\n\nSeller Guy Burrows, a local doctor, bought the house in 2011 for $1.3 million, according to the MLS.\n\nRosalie Murphy covers real estate and business at The Desert Sun.
