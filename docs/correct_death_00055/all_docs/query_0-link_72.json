        "text": "What do Colgate toothpaste and the telegraph have in common, and why should we be concerned with either subject? The answer is found in TORRENCE and Allied Families, by Robert McIlvaine TORRENCE, as we follow the later generations of the family of the Rev. Samuel FINLEY.\n\nRobert FINLEY m Margaret Mary LAUDER. Their second child, Michael, m Ann O'NEILL, and emigrated to America in 1734 on the Eagle Wing.\n\nAccording to TORRENCE, their second son was Samuel FINLEY, b 2 Jul 1715, Co Armagh, Ireland; m (1st) 26 Sep 1744, Sarah HALL, d 30 Jul 1760; m (2nd) 13 May 1761, Ann CLARKSON, b ca. 1730, d 1807; d 17 Jul 1766, Philadelphia, PA. His will was dated 25 Jun 1766; proven 22 Jul 1766, in Somerset Co, NJ. The executors were Samuel BREESE and Richard STOCKTON.\n\nHe landed at Philadelphia on 28 Sep 1734, along with his father and eight brothers and sisters. TORRENCE says, \"His parents had given their children every possible educational opportunity available in their native country. Samuel FINLEY, from childhood, had determined to study for the ministry, and it was arranged that he should attend Tennent's Log College, which was in Bucks Co, PA.\n\n\"After graduation, he was licensed to preach, August 8, 1740. He was ordained by the New Brunswick Presbytery, October 13, 1742. In 1743, he went to Milford, Connecticut. He became pastor of the Nottingham Presbyterian Church, at Nottingham, Cecil County, Maryland, in June of 1744, where he remained, from 1744-1761, establishing a great reputation in preparing young men for the ministry. The College of New Jersey conferred upon him, in 1749, the honorary degree of Master of Arts. In 1751, he was elected a trustee of that institution. In July of 1761, he was chosen President of the College of New Jersey, at Princeton, New Jersey, now known as Princeton University. In 1763, the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n\"Among the sermons and theological discussions published by him were 'Christ Triumphing and Satan Raging' (1741); 'A Refutation of Mr. Thomson's Sermon on the Doctrine of Conviction' (1743); 'Against the Moravians, Being the Substance of Several Sermons, Showing the Strength, Nature, and Symptoms of Delusion,' (1743); 'A Charitable Plea for the Speechless,' (1747); 'Vindication of the Charitable Plea for the Speechless, or a Particular Consideration and Refutation of the Objections Made Against Infant Baptism,' (1748); 'Sermons at the Ordination of the Reverend John RODGERS,' (1749); 'On the death of the Reverend Samuel BLAIR,' (1751); 'On II Cor. Chap. 4 verse,' (1754); 'The Curse of Meroz, or the Danger of Neutrality in the Cause of God and Our Country,' (1757); and a 'Sermon at the funeral of the Reverend Gilbert TENNENT,' (1764). He edited the sermons of Samuel DAVIES, his discourse 'On the Death of President DAVIES,' (1761) being afterward prefixed to an edition of the latter's works.\" Albert Finley FRANCE adds the following information: \"West Nottingham Academy, Colora, MD, established in 1741 had its beginning before our country itself was fairly in the making; before George WASHINGTON had first won fame by saving a remnant of BRADDOCK's army at Fort Duquesne; before Patrick HENRY had thrilled the Colonies with his speech before the Virginia Assembly; before the embattled farmers of New England had chased the British back from Lexington. \"It is not only the oldest preparatory boarding school for boys in America, but is also the oldest existing Presbyterian Educational Institution of any kind in the new world. The founder of the school, then a log building, near the village of Rising Sun, MD, was the Rev. Samuel FINLEY, then pastor of the West Nottingham Presbyterian Church, which had been established some 17 years earlier. That Dr. FINLEY was a man who combined high scholarly attainments with marked administrative ability is attested by the fact that he was later called in 1761 to become president of Princeton College. \"Attracted by Dr. FINLEY's fame as a scholar and his character as a man, boys came from all parts of the Colonies and the subsequent careers of many of them bear eloquent testimony to the soundness of the training received. Among these early students was Benjamin RUSH of Philadelphia, later to become a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a surgeon in Washington's army and first professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; Richard STOCKTON of New Jersey and John ARCHER. \"Among the students in 1747 to 1750 we find the names of John and James FINLEY, sons of James and Margaret (JOHNSON) FINLEY of Rising Sun, MD. John later served as captain in the Revolution and lived in 1790, East Wheatfield Township, Westmoreland Co, later Indiana Co, PA. He was the father of Isabella FINLEY KINTER, who married John KINTER, Revolutionary soldier and died in Indiana Co, 1853; both buried in Washington Presbyterian Church Yard, near Chambersville, Indiana Co, PA.\" What neither TORRENCE nor FRANCE acknowledge is that the Rev. Samuel FINLEY's views were controversial for his time. In HANNA's The Scotch-Irish, originally printed in 1902 (reprinted in 1968 by Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore), Vol. 1, P. 93, he states: \"Reverend Samuel FINLEY, a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, afterwards president of Princeton College, was arrested and imprisoned in Connecticut in 1742-43, because he ventured to preach in that colony without an invitation from a minister of one of the established churches.\" In Vol. 2, P. 24, he is next found in Connecticut: \"In 1743, at the request of the congregation, the New Brunswick Presbytery sent them, as supply, the Rev. Samuel FINLEY, afterwards president of Princeton College. He preached at Milford on August 25th and at New Haven on September 1st. \"For this offense, he was prosecuted, tried and condemned. For disturbing the peace of the community, Governor Law ordered him to be transported as a vagrant, by the constable, from town to town, out of the colony. \"This treatment was considered by some of the foremost citizens of Connecticut and of the city of New York to be so contrary to the spirit and letter of the British Constitution as to work a forfeiture of the colonial charter. After this, the Rev. Mr. POMEROY preached at Milford occasionally, but he also was arrested, and carried to Hartford, to answer to the General Assembly for his conduct.\" Returning to the original question posed at the beginning of this section, the Rev. Samuel FINLEY's descendants had better fortune. The first child of the Rev. Samuel and Sarah HALL FINLEY was Rebecca FINLEY, b 28 Jun 1745, Nottingham, Cecil Co, MD; m Princeton, NJ, w Samuel BREESE; d 1770. The third child of Samuel and Rebecca FINLEY BREESE was Elizabeth Ann BREESE, b 29 Sep 1766, Wall Street, New York City, NY; m 14 May 1789, the Rev. Jedidiah MORSE, b 23 Aug 1761, Charlestown, MA, d 9 Jun 1826, New Haven, CT; d 28 May 1828, MA. Their children were (1) Samuel Finley Breese MORSE, b 27 Apr 1791, Charlestown, MA; m (1st) 6 Oct 1818, Lucretia P. WALKER, d 7 Feb 1825; m (2nd) 10 Aug 1848, Sarah Elizabeth GRISWOLD; d 2 Apr 1872, New York City, NY; (2) Sidney Edward MORSE, b 7 Feb 1794, Charlestown, MA; m 1 Apr 1841, Catherine LIVINGSTON; d 23 Dec 1876, New York City, NY; (3) Richard Cary MORSE, b 6 May 1797, Charlestown, MA; m 1826, Sarah Louise DAVIS; d 1868. The first son is perhaps the most famous one in this branch of the family. According to TORRENCE, Samuel Finley Breese MORSE \"graduated from Yale University in 1810; studied art in England in 1811 under Benjamin WEST; returned to America, and for several years, was a portrait painter. After another period spent in Europe, he returned, in 1832, and began working on apparatus, the result of which was his discovery and invention of the telegraph, for which he received a patent in 1840. The first message sent over the wire, from Baltimore to Washington, on March 24, 1844, was, 'What God hath wrought!'\" Sidney Edward MORSE graduated from Yale University in 1811; established the Boston Recorder; was editor of the"
