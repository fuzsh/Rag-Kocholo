        "text": "I’ve been a fan of Cary Grant for a very long time. I love his smooth and debonair style, his handsome and tanned good looks and that rather languid transatlantic brogue of his.\n\nIn the TV series Archie currently streaming on ITV X they seem to be saying that all of that was an invention, an invention by an Englishman called Archie Leach who transformed himself into a successful Hollywood film star named Cary Grant.\n\nGrant was born Archibald Leach in Bristol, England in 1904. He had a poor upbringing and his mother suffered from depression and his father was an alcoholic. The young Archie was interested in the theatre and performing and his mother was keen on him having piano lessons. His older brother had died before reaching the age of one and this perhaps made his mother a little over protective of the young Archie. Even so, his mother was not a woman who was able to give or receive love easily and the older Cary Grant blamed his childhood relationship with his mother for his problems with women in later life.\n\nWhen Archie was 9 years old his father placed his mother in Glenside Hospital, a mental institution, telling his son that she had gone away on a long holiday and later, that she had died.\n\nArchie befriended a group of acrobatic dancers known as The Penders and he was able to eventually join them and there he trained as a stilt walker and became part of their act. Later the group toured America and Archie decided to stay, following in the footsteps of others before him like Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel who had made their way to the USA in an almost identical way.\n\nOn Wikipedia they mention that on the trip over to the USA Archie met Douglas Fairbanks and was greatly impressed by him, so much so that Fairbanks became a role model for the young Archie Leach.\n\nIn New York Archie worked in vaudeville with various comedy and theatrical groups. He joined the William Morris theatrical agency and began to pick up many theatre roles. In 1932 he had his first screen test and was given a five year contract with Paramount Pictures. B P Schulberg the general manager of Paramount decided that Archie Leach was not a good enough name for films so Archie came up with the name Cary Grant taking Cary from a stage character he had played and Grant chosen randomly from a telephone directory.\n\nCary Grant worked hard at his profession and in the TV series Archie they claim that Cary was a role or a part that Archie built up over time. Jason Isaacs who plays Grant says Cary would never be filmed or recorded during an interview because then he was being himself not playing at being Cary. The actor tracked down a recording of Grant made secretly by a student journalist who interviewed Cary over the phone and felt that for the first time he was hearing the real Archie who came over in the recording as very English rather than the usual mid Atlantic voice that we are used to hearing.\n\nIt seems to me that many stars who use a different name in the film world are in a way creating a character which they present to the public. You could argue that Marilyn Monroe was a similar personality and that she was a creation of Norma Jeane in the way that Cary Grant was created by Archie Leach.\n\nA breakthrough role for Grant was starring with Mae West in the film She Done Him Wrong and the follow up, I’m No Angel. Grant went on to star in many famous films and amazingly, even though he was a star in Hollywood’s golden years, he was actually the first big star to not be a part of the studio system. He was a freelance actor, not contracted to any studio until 1937 when he signed a four-picture deal with Columbia.\n\nIn his early years in Hollywood, Grant shared a house with actor Randolph Scott leading to claims of the two being gay lovers. Still, young bachelors sharing a house with others is not uncommon. David Niven famously shared a house with Errol Flynn and we can hardly class those two as being gay.\n\nSomewhere in my fairly huge book collection I have a biography of Cary Grant but despite an intensive search I couldn’t find it. I also have a copy of David Niven’s Bring on the Empty Horses which if I remember correctly has a short chapter on Grant. Now where did I put that book?\n\nI did do some quite considerable research to produce this blog post. Firstly, I had to watch the four episodes of the TV series Archie, currently streaming on ITV X. That wasn’t anything difficult of course, it wasn’t a chore, in fact it was very enjoyable. Archie is a wonderful four part series and Jason Isaacs plays an outstanding part. He doesn’t try to impersonate Cary but he did manage to create a look of the late star and he caught Grant’s voice and enunciation perfectly. Most of the series follows Cary in later life when he becomes involved with and later marries Dyan Cannon, Dyan was his fourth wife and she was the mother of his only child Jennifer and she and her mother co-produced the series which is definitely well worth watching.\n\nNext, I searched for the biography I had of Cary but despite searching the entire house I couldn’t find it. Oh well, I have a few copies of Bring on The Empty Horses about the house so I thought ok, I’ll grab that and have a read of the chapter on Cary. Once again, I searched through the entire house but could I find that book? No! Eventually I started to put everything back where I had found it and it was only after idly looking in a box of books that I had only recently packed away and had earlier dismissed, that I finally found it.\n\nAnyway, I had a break from writing to look for that book and after a while when I couldn’t find it I popped the TV on. I wasn’t altogether surprised to find there was a Cary Grant film showing. It was An Affair to Remember, a love story in which Grant’s character, a playboy type meets Deborah Kerr on a transatlantic voyage and the two fall for each other. On arrival in the USA they decide to have a 6 month break from each other as they are both in other relationships and then meet at the top of the Empire State building in New York. It’s not really my cup of tea, in fact it’s overtly sentimental but then, sometimes a small dose of sentimentality is good for you. Cary Grant plays, well, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr plays a very English New Yorker.\n\nI have two of Grant’s other films on DVD, To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest, both directed by Cary’s favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nOK, enough TV watching for now. Getting back to Bring on the Empty Horses, David Niven wrote about Cary Grant in a short section of his book called Long Shots and Close Ups where he gives his readers a quick sketch about various film people. The section on Cary is only three and a half pages and not the full chapter I was expecting but Niven clearly liked the man and in those three and a bit pages, picked up on some essential elements of Grant’s character. Niven remembers Cary Grant as an intelligent man, particularly with money and he listed people like multi millionaire Howard Hughes among his friends. Grant invested his earnings well and became one of the richest people in Hollywood. He had an obsession with his health, embarking on various health pursuits and then moving on to the next one. Niven remarks that once when Cary was taking swimming lessons to learn the crawl, Niven mentioned that Cary could already swim the crawl. Grant answered ‘yes but I want to swim the crawl perfectly!’ Cary gave up smoking by hypnotising himself and Niven also mentions his use of LSD during his treatment by a psychiatrist which is also brought up in Archie.\n\nCary Grant retired from films in 1966 the year his daughter was born and he and Dyan Cannon divorced in 1968. Many tried to bring him out of retirement for various films including his favourite director Alfred Hitchcock but he declined. He must have wanted to keep on working though because he did accept a position on the board of Fabergé.\n\nHe died in 1986 aged 82 and left behind an estate reputedly worth around 80 million dollars. Archie is a well made and quite fascinating piece of TV. Look out for it, it’s well worth watching.\n\nWhat to do next: Here are a few options.\n\nShare this post on your favourite social media!\n\nHit the Subscribe button.
