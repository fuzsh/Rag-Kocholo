        "text": "Hotel Blackhawk in Davenport, Iowa, was first built in 1915 and has played host to many notable names throughout history including Cary Grant who checked into the Blackhawk one Saturday night in 1986 and, sadly, never checked out again.\n\nCary Grant, born Archibald Alexander Leach, known for his comedic flair, debonair style and effortless classic finesse.\n\nHe was born in Gloucestershire England in 1904 and, tragically, died right here at the Blackhawk Hotel on November 29th, 1986.\n\nThe English/American actor had suffered a fatal stroked whilst attending a fundraiser in the ballroom.\n\nHe was 82 years old.\n\nIt is alleged his spirit lingers here today.\n\nStaff have reported unexplained phantom piano music emanating from the ballroom when empty and a tall dark mysterious shadow figure walking various rooms.\n\nCould this be the ghost of Grant himself?\n\nIs this our most famous alleged haunting to date?\n\nThe star was known for enjoying the piano, and he was over 6ft tall, so you just never know.\n\nWhat we do know is that Cary Grant was of most enduring and captivating stars the world ever saw and will always be fondly remembered."
