        "text": "(1952-2004)\n\nWho Was Christopher Reeve?\n\nChristopher Reeve had various stage and television roles before becoming the star of Superman and its sequels. In 1995 he became paralyzed from the neck down following a horse-riding accident. He founded what became the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation in 1996 to promote research on spinal cord injuries. He died of cardiac arrest in 2004.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nChristopher D'Olier Reeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City. He studied at Cornell University and the Juilliard School in New York, before landing roles in the Broadway play A Matter of Gravity, alongside Katharine Hepburn, and the soap opera Love of Life.\n\n'Superman' and Other Films\n\nThe actor catapulted to stardom when, following a two-year casting search, he was selected to play the titular superhero of (1978). The popularity of the film, and Reeve's winning portrayals of the Man of Steel and his alter ego, Clark Kent, spawned the release of Superman in 1980, 1983 and 1987.\n\nReeve also starred in (1980), (1982), (1985) and a TV movie adaptation of (1985), during which time he developed a fascination with horse riding. His post-Superman films included (1992), (1994) and (1995).\n\nInjury and Paralysis\n\nIn May 1995 Reeve became paralyzed from the neck down when he sustained a severe cervical spinal injury in a horse-riding accident. Despite being confined to a wheelchair and needing a respirator to assist with his breathing, he became heavily involved in campaigns supporting handicapped children and paraplegics, testifying before a Senate subcommittee in favor of federal funding for stem cell research.\n\nReeve tirelessly sought to overcome the limitations of his condition, undergoing an experimental operation in 2003 that enabled him to breathe for hours without use of his respirator.\n\nFoundation\n\nAfter launching the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation in 1996, the actor merged his organization with the American Paralysis Association in 1999 to create a powerful advocate for the disabled in the quest to raise awareness, fund spinal cord research and forge medical breakthroughs. The organization was renamed the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation in 2007.\n\nDirecting and Books\n\nReeve continued to work after ongoing rehabilitation. He returned to acting in a television production of (1998), for which he picked up a Golden Globe nomination, and directed two television films with health themes, (1997) and (2004). Reeve also penned two autobiographical books, (1998) and (2002).\n\nDeath\n\nReeve died from cardiac arrest on October 10, 2004. He was survived by his wife Dana and son William, as well as his two children, Matthew and Alexandra, from his previous relationship with model Gae Exton.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Christopher D'Olier Reeve\n\nBORN: September 25, 1952\n\nBIRTHPLACE: New York, NY\n\nDEATH: October 10, 2004\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Libra\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.
