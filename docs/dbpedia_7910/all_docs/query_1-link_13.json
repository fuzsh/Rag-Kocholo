        "text": "Standup Entertainer Stars At Special Sunday Evening Sail April 29\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, FL – (April 17, 2012) What do you get when you combine a world class entertainer with a high quality casino cruise? An electrifying, out of the ordinary evening you’re certain to tell all your friends about.\n\nVeteran stand up comedian and actor Christopher Reid stars on board Victory Casino Cruises “SaiLebrity Night” on Sunday, April 29. The highly-acclaimed and multi talented showman will meet passengers, sign autographs and perform a free show in Big Norm’s Club V where he’ll do comedy and sing with Khamelien. Victory, which typically does not sail on Sunday evenings, is adding a special 7:00 P.M. cruise for this exclusive event. A dockside party begins at 3:00 P.M.\n\nReid’s thriving show business career spans the hip hop musical act Kid ‘n Play in the late 1980s/early 1990s to a number of television programs including Martin and Sister, Sister. Known for his hi-top fade hairstyle, he has also starred in amateur contest shows including Your Big Break and It’s Showtime at the Apollo. In 2008, Reid was on the VH1 reality magician game show Celebracadabra. Last May, he released a rap music video, “Why Don’t You Stay.” He also appeared in War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave. The New York city native recently wrote the theme song to HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nApril 29 is also Double Down Sunday! Sail Victory on both the day and evening cruises for just one boarding fee. The first cruise sails at 12:00 noon and the SaiLebrity Cruise embarks at 7:00 P.M. Victory Casino Cruises tickets are on sale by calling toll free 855-GO-VICTORY or locally in Brevard (321) 799-0021. Skip the lines and reserve online! Print your web to gate boarding pass at www.victorycasinocruises. com.\n\nThe Victory 1 Casino ship offers 13 cruises weekly with over 600 dazzling and state of the art slots, 30 table games together with Craps, Roulette, Blackjack, EZ Bac, 3 card Poker, Ultimate Texas Hold ‘Em, Let It Ride as well as the only Sports Book in Florida! Exceptional guest service includes dining, a high energy nightclub that continues the party into the wee hours on weekends as well as live entertainment."
