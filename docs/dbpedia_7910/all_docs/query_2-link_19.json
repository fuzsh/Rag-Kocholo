        "text": "Christopher Sean Reid was born in Yakima, Washington, to Laurie and Norman Reid, both owners of a gymnastics school. He's one of three children. His childhood was full of physically demanding sports such as gymnastics, rock climbing, mountaineering, and windsurfing. Chris found his love of theatre and acting when going to school at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. From there he was accepted into a competitive apprenticeship at Actors Theatre of Louisville. One of Chris' first experiences in front of the camera was playing a soccer player on Robert Rodriquez's set of Matador. Soon, after a number of small roles on television, he was cast in a leading comedic role on the long-running Nickelodeon show, Power Rangers. With his gymnastics background, stunts naturally became a career along with acting and modeling. Chris was married to Caitlin Reid in 2016. They currently live in Los Angeles."
