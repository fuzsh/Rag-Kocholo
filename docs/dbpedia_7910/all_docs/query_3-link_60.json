        "text": "Christopher Reid, the “Kid” in 1980s hip-hop duo Kid ‘n Play, was arrested at his home Tuesday (Aug. 9) for missing multiple court dates tied to 2010 DUI arrest, according to reports.\n\nThe 47-year-old rapper-turned-actor, who has had a warrant out for his arrest since Aug. 2, was taken into custody and booked into the Los Angeles County Jail around noon. Bail was set at $26,000, and upon his release later Tuesday he told TMZ the whole thing was a “clerical error.”\n\nPhoto Gallery: 50 Musician Mugshots\n\nReid was arrested July 8, 2010 for driving with almost double the legal alcohol limit and later pleaded no contest and was ordered to seek counseling and pay fines.\n\nHe was also sentenced to three years probation and his failure to show up to court hearings on at least two occasions brought on the arrest warrant.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nAlong with Christopher “Play” Martin, Reid delivered a positive, feel-good brand of hip-hop in the late 1980s until the gangsta rap era arrived. The group’s last album, “Face the Nation,” was released in 1991. They are perhaps best known for transitioning their act to the big (“House Party” films) and small (Saturday morning cartoons) screens."
