        "text": "Noah Nicholas Reid is a Canadian-American actor, musician, and former voice actor. He has performed in several films and television series, including the CBC comedy Schitt's Creek. In 2016, he received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Original Song for his work in the feature film People Hold On. In 2019, he received a Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for his work on Schitt's Creek.\n\nStarting as a child actor, Reid voiced the title character in Franklin from 1997 to 2004.[9] He also played Tommy Settegren in 1997's Pippi Longstocking, and has since co-starred in Strange Days at Blake Holsey High (2002-2006). Reid provided the voice for Gunther in the animated series Jane and the Dragon[10] and Eddie in Marvin The Tap-Dancing Horse, as well as various characters in Little Bear, Redwall, Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, Timothy Goes to School, The Berenstain Bears, Babar: King of the Elephants, and Bad Dog.\n\nIn 2005, Reid played the role of Darrell Fox in the made-for-television movie Terry which dramatized Terry Fox's historic run for cancer research. In 2007, he appeared in the Naturally, Sadie episode \"As the Whirly Turns\". In 2009, Reid guest-starred in the Degrassi: The Next Generation episode \"Danger Zone\".\n\nReid's first leading role in a feature film was Farley Gordon in Score: A Hockey Musical, which premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. He then played several guest roles on television, including in the police drama Rookie Blue (2012) and the drama series Cracked (2013). In 2013, he also appeared in the CW web series Backpackers. In 2015, he played the lead role in the ABC Family comedy series Kevin From Work. The series was canceled after one season.\n\nIn 2016, Reid was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award for Best Original Song for his work in the feature film People Hold On (2015), in which he also starred. He also released a self-produced full-length original album, Songs From a Broken Chair.\n\nIn 2017, Reid played the recurring role of Patrick in the third season of the CBC series Schitt's Creek. That year, he was also cast in the independent film Cardinals, opposite Sheila McCarthy, which premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2018, Reid was promoted to a series regular on Schitt's Creek, beginning with the series' fourth season. He also performed in a production of Hamlet at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto in the same year. He starred in the film Buffaloed, which was released in February 2020. Reid later embarked on a tour across North America to support his then-upcoming second album, however, a number of the original dates had to be indefinitely postponed midway through the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album, titled Gemini, was released on May 29, 2020."
