        "text": "Christopher West, MD, is a fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon specializing in primary and revision hip and knee replacement and adolescent/young adult hip preservation.\n\nDr. West offers a variety of treatment options to his patients based on their activity level and joint health. His comprehensive approach to the hip focuses on treatments that allow patients to maintain their desired activity level. His knee practice focuses primarily on the treatment of arthritis with knee replacement. Dr. West also treats previously done replacements that have failed or suffered complications with revision hip or knee replacement.\n\nDr. West grew up in Salt Lake City and received his bachelorâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering at Brigham Young University and his Doctor of Medicine at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston. He completed an orthopedic surgery residency at the University of Iowa before heading to Missouri, where he completed a fellowship in joint replacement, preservation, and resurfacing at Washington University in St. Louis. During his fellowship, he also served as an attending orthopedic surgeon at Barnes Jewish Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital in St. Louis, MO. He received the Hip Preservation Society (ISHA) Global Traveling Fellowship, where he extended his learning from pioneers in hip preservation and reconstruction techniques, which took him to Boston Children's Hospital, University College London Hospitals in England, and Switzerland at Inselspital (Berne), Shulthess Klinik (Zurich), and the University of Freiberg.\n\nDr. West is a member of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, The Hip Preservation Society (ISHA), and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. He has presented clinical research at the state and national level and has published his research in peer-reviewed medical journals.\n\nChris and his wife, Britt, live in Salt Lake City with their four children and enjoy time together skiing in the winter and camping in the summer. Chris (with Britt's patient support) recently fulfilled a lifetime dream of building a treehouse that the entire family thoroughly enjoys."
