        "text": "Chris brings a wealth of professional and business expertise to his real estate practice. He has over 15 years experience in the banking industry and is a licensed attorney. After many years of visiting family and vacationing in Pawleys Island it became a dream to make the permanent move to the Grand Strand area. Several years ago the dream a became a reality for Chris and his family. It has been a wonderful experience and Chris enjoys welcoming and introducing new residents to the area. Whether it is the many beaches (Litchfield, Pawleys, Surfside, Garden City), the world class golf courses (True Blue, Caledonia, Willbrook, Heritage, TPC Myrtle Beach etc.), the wonderful restaurants at the Murrells Inlet Marshwalk, boating and fishing in the Waccamaw River, or just enjoying the sunshine and fresh air at Brookgreen Gardens, we have something for everyone to enjoy. For those that are already here but looking to downsize or maybe buy that dream house, Chris can assist you with the process of listing and selling your existing home. Most importantly, Chris will listen to your real estate goals and work tirelessly to help you achieve them with integrity, honesty, and respect. Chris resides in Pawleys with his wife (Celeste) and two children. Celeste is a middle school teacher for Georgetown County School District. In his spare time Chris serves as a volunteer board member for the Montessori School of Pawleys Island and attends Precious Blood Catholic Church. He is an avid golfer and sports enthusiast."
