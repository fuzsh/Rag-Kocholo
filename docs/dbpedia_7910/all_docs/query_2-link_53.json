        "text": "Chris is a valued strategic partner to emerging companies and the institutions and individuals that invest in them. He serves as primary counsel to entrepreneurs and venture capital funds, including extensive work in the technology and life sciences sectors.\n\nChris provides reliable guidance at each stage of investment, and has led financings ranging from small seed equity rounds to equity financings in excess of $50 million.\n\nDrawing on his significant corporate and securities experience, Chris works closely with entrepreneurs to come up with practical solutions to their key legal problems: Structuring financing rounds, hiring, incentivizing and managing employees, and building strong relationships with directors, customers, vendors and other key stakeholders. He also frequently counsels executives on issues outside the legal realm, including financing strategies, supplier and customer management, and stockholder relationships. As one client remarked to the St. Louis Business Journal, \"Chris operates like an entrepreneur. He's creative, sharp and responsive.\"\n\nIn his investor-side work, Chris represents institutional and angel investors looking to invest in companies across the country. He has advised investors on a wide variety of financings, from traditional preferred equity financing rounds to convertible note financings and SAFEs, and everything in between.\n\nHaving worked through a number of business cycles, particularly in the start-up and venture world, Chris has experience guiding clients through all types of fundraising environments. He looks for win-win solutions and leads transactions in a calm, constructive manner that reduces friction and results in highly efficient deals."
