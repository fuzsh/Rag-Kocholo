        "text": "An Open Letter From: Christopher 'Kid' Reid and Christopher ‘Play’ Martin (a/k/a \"Kid N Play\") February 27, 2012 Dear Extended Family, Friends & Fans of Kid N Play: 2012 year marks the 22nd Annual Reunion of Kid N Play: House Party. Wow, how does time fly, when you’re having fun. It just seems like yesterday, when we did our first kick-step and House Party hit the big screen. The past few years have been very busy and exciting from touring to teaching and being on a number of television shows - click the following link to watch a Kid N Play live performance clip on the George Lopez Show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8QVZGT869g&feature=related . We are writing you today to let you all know that we have been working on two things: (1) shooting a series of us traveling from coast-to-coast (Los Angeles to New York to Miami to Atlanta and every-in-between; and (2) shooting a film pilot for a movie entitled ‘SkyKapz’ (see project synopsis online at: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kidnplay/346669831?token=17d0af86 ). SkyKapz is an inspiring and entertaining story of two lifelong friends as they work and play together at a major metropolitan airport while struggling to break through in the entertainment industry. Christopher “Kid” Reid and Christopher “Play” Martin (a/k/a “Kid N Play”) will play the lead roles, while experienced Hollywood actors will be placed in key supporting roles and cameos from some of the leading figures in the comedy and hip-hop industries. Kid N Play Films is surveying shoot locations in Atlanta, Georgia, due to community support of video productions and incentives. If you are reading this correspondence and you are a fan of Kid N Play and you would personally like to support us in achieving the two objectives of shooting: (1) Kid N Play: Coast-to-Coast; and (2) Kid N Play: SkyKapz: The Movie, then there are three (3) things that you can help us with: Tell everyone that you know that Kid N Play are looking to do this biggest House Party ever and are enlisting the support of the community, extended family, friends and fans worldwide.
