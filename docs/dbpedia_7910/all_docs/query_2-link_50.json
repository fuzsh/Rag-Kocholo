        "text": "Surrounded by his family, Christopher Marion Reid, 41, of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, beloved husband of Tiffany and cherished father of Max and Lucy, entered into eternal rest Wednesday, November 1, 2023, the day after Halloween, one of his favorite holidays.\n\nBorn on January 12, 1982, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Chris graduated from the Northwest School of the Arts in 2000. He then moved to Cullowhee, North Carolina to attend Western Carolina University. He returned to Charlotte to complete his college degree at Central Piedmont Community College. In 2008, Chris met Tiffany, the love of his life, and moved to the Charleston area in 2009. He settled in Mt. Pleasant with his family in 2012, where he was well known as the ‘tax guy’ during his career at the Charleston County Auditor’s office until 2021. Outside of work, Chris was a gifted artist, creating colorful and energetic paintings for family and friends, and specializing in commissioned pet portraits that truly captured the essence of their spirits. Never one to sit still, Chris also started Lowcountry Lawncare in 2020, helping out neighbors and friends with landscaping.\n\nChris was an involved and active Dad to Lucy and Max, he loved taking them to the beach, the movies and to his favorite vacation destination, Disney World. He encouraged Lucy’s artistic spirit, enjoyed watching her theater performances and delighted in working on paintings together. He built countless Lego sets with Max and enjoyed taking him fishing after school. Chris was also a huge movie buff, with a particular love for Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars and Marvel movies. He never passed up a chance to enjoy a showing at the local theater with his kids and a huge bowl of buttered popcorn.\n\nChris was an active sports enthusiast from a young age, playing soccer from the age of 10, even traveling as far as Costa Rica to play, as well as showcasing his talents as a kicker on the football team of West Charlotte High School. Fueled by his favorite beverage, coffee, Chris continued to be incredibly active into adulthood. He could frequently be seen running the Isle of Palms Connector or paddleboarding the waterways of Charleston. His drive and determination were never more evident than in his two year battle with brain cancer, where his warrior spirit fought until the very end with grace and dignity.\n\nChris was blessed with a generous spirit and touched the hearts and souls of everyone he met. In all ways, he embraced his family, friends and the magic of the world around us, telling his wife “Life is what you make of it” just a month before his passing.\n\nChris is survived by his wife of 11 years, Tiffany Reid and his children Christopher Maxwell and Lucy Charlotte; his parents, Billy and Tonya Reid and Vickie and Doc Wilson; his twin brother, Scott Reid (wife Jenn, nephew Sawyer and niece Ruby) brothers, Alex Reid (wife Lindsay) Porter Metzler, and step sister, Lynsey Wilson. His in-laws, Lisa and Pat Nelligan, Charles Murray, Christina Sustaita (husband Leo and nieces Lillian and Angelina) Adrienne Meismer (husband Tommy and niece Myra Mae) and Rebecca Hinkle.\n\nChris is predeceased by his grandparents Martha & Bill Reid and Evelyn & Bill Overcash, as well as his beloved dogs, Ginger and Ryan.\n\nHis funeral service will be held Thursday, November 9th at 11am in the chapel of Seacoast Church, 750 Long Point Rd, Mt. Pleasant, SC. Interment at Mt. Pleasant Memorial Gardens, 1308 Mathis Ferry Rd. Mt. Pleasant, SC, will directly follow the service. A celebration of life will be held the same day at Holy City Brewery in North Charleston from 1:30pm – 3:30pm.\n\nThe family is grateful for the excellent care Chris received at MUSC, especially by the Neuro-Oncology team at Hollings Cancer Center.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made online to MUSC Hollings Cancer Center -Select the Glioblastoma research fund. Checks can be mailed to MUSC Foundation: 18 Bee St. MSC 450 Charleston, SC 29425."
