        "text": "Dr. Reid's journey into medicine began in 1991 when he decided to leave a successful career in electrical engineering to pursue a career in medicine. With the support and help of his wife Melissa, Dr. Reid attended medical school at East Carolina University School of Medicine. He graduated from medical school with high honors in 1997. Chris and Melissa moved to Charlottesville, Virginia in the fall of 1997 to begin a new chapter in medical training at the University of Virginia. They spent the next six years of their lives at the University of Virginia. Dr. Reid completed a residency in Internal Medicine, a Chief Residency and Fellowship in Nephrology during his six years in Charlottesville.\n\nDr. Reid and his family chose the Panhandle of Florida as their home in 2003. They moved to the area to be closer to family and to take advantage of the wonderful opportunity to practice medicine in this community. Dr. Reid began his journey with Renalus Center for Kidney Care, formerly Pensacola Nephrology, P.A. He enjoys working with such a diverse group of physicians, employees and patients.\n\nDr. Reid has been instrumental in the growth of the Renalus practice throughout the Panhandle and southern Alabama. His philosophy has always been to treat his patients with the level of respect and compassion that he would give to his own family.\n\nDr. Reid is board certified in Internal Medicine and Nephrology. When he is not working with patients, Dr. Reid enjoys spending time with his family, running, sailing, fishing and time at the beach."
