        "text": "<br>ROSE, Okla. (AP) _ Authorities are trying to determine the relationship between an heiress to the Dresser Industries fortune and the man they believe shot her before killing himself. <br><br>Ina Louise\n\nBy: News On 6\n\nROSE, Okla. (AP) _ Authorities are trying to determine the relationship between an heiress to the Dresser Industries fortune and the man they believe shot her before killing himself.\n\nIna Louise Dresser died about 10 p.m. Monday from a gunshot to the head after she called neighbors from her home to say she was in danger and needed help, Delaware County Sheriff Lenden Woodruff said.\n\nWhen the neighbors arrived, they found her body on the floor and Randy D. Dover, of Springdale, Ark., lying dead next to her, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nDresser, 51, was the granddaughter of the late Lawrence L. Dresser, founder of Dresser Industries, a major provider of integrated services and project management for the oil industry worldwide.\n\nHalliburton acquired Dresser Industries in 1998 for about $8 billion, said Stewart Ye of Dresser Inc. in Dallas. Dresser Inc., a privately held company, is no longer owned or operated by the Dresser family.\n\nJames Dresser, who owns and operates the 1,800-acre Flying-D Ranch near Talihina, is Ina Dresser's father.\n\nJessica Brown, a spokeswoman of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, said Dover shot Dresser with a 30-30 Winchester rifle and then shot himself.\n\nIt is unclear why Dover shot Dresser or how the two knew each other, Brown said. The two had been acquaintances, but it is uncertain what the nature of their relationship was.\n\nNeighbors told investigators that Dresser had been ``getting a little worried about him (Dover), but nothing that would indicate he'd do something like this,'' Brown said.\n\nDover had an Arkansas address but had been living in California, she said."
