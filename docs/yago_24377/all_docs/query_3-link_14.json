        "text": "Description\n\nThis portrait of actress and vaudeville performer Louise Dresser (n√©e Louise Josephine Kerlin) is autographed to John Morrisey, 1910. Louise Dresser (October 5, 1878 - April 24, 1965) was an American actress of both silent film, talkies, and vaudeville. She is best known for her roles in which she played the wife of Will Rogers such as the film \"State Fair\" and \"David Harum\". She retired in 1937 and moved to Southern California, where she stayed until her death in 1965. The photograph was taken in San Francisco, likely around the time she was transitioning from a traveling vaudeville performer to Broadway."
