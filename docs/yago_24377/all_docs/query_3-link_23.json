        "text": "Description\n\nType: Signed card\n\nDescription: (b. Louise Josephine Kerlin, 1878-1965) American actress best known for her roles in the many films in which she played Will Rogers’ wife, incl. State Fair and David Harum.\n\nDresser took her professional last name from Paul Dresser, a friend of her father. Upon finding out Louise was William Kerlin’s daughter, he launched her as his younger sister, and she took on his last name. She worked as a burlesque dancer and a singer at the Boston Dime Museum then made her vaudeville debut in 1900. She formed a team, “Louise Dresser and Her Picks”, a singing act backed by a chorus of African-American children. In 1906, she began to play New York vaudeville stages, and in that year was in the hit musical About Town with Lew Fields. In 1907, she was in the hit Girl Behind the Counter, which ran for 260 performances.\n\nAfter vaudeville, her success continued on Broadway, starring with DeWolf Hopper in Matinee Idol (1910-12), and appeared in Broadway to Paris (1912), Potash and Perlmutter (1913), and Hello Broadway! (1914); her last Broadway show was Have a Heart (1917).\n\nDresser made her film debut in The Glory of Clementina (1922), and her 1st starring role was in The City That Never Sleeps (1924). In 1925, she starred in The Eagle, opposite Rudolph Valentino and Vilma Banky as Catherine the Great, and played the title role in The Goose Woman with Jack Pickford. During the 1st Academy Award presentations in 1929, Dresser was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for A Ship Comes In. In 1930, she acted as Al Jolson’s mother in Mammy, and portrayed Empress Elizabeth in The Scarlet Empress (1934). Her last film was Maid of Salem (1937).\n\nOn television, she appeared in an episode spotlighting Buster Keaton on Ralph Edwards’ This is Your Life; she had known Keaton since he was a small boy with his parents in vaudeville. After retiring in 1937, Dresser worked as a volunteer at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. In 1950, Dresser attempted to make a comeback, but was unable to get any screen roles, which she blamed on rumors of her being deaf.\n\nSigned 2 ¾ x 4 card dated March 17, 1924 by her, also adding Los Angeles, Calif."
