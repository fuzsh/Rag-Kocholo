His maternal grandparents were Susan Elizabeth (née Fish) LeRoy (1808–1892) (the daughter of Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant) and Daniel LeRoy (1799–1885).\n\nHis sisters included Edith Stuyvesant Dresser, who married George Washington Vanderbilt II and Natalie Bayard Dresser Brown, who married John Nicholas Brown I. Two other sisters married Mr. George D. Merrill of Stockbridge, Massachusetts and Viscount Romain D'Osmoy of Paris respectively.\n\nHe was a graduate of Columbia College in 1889 and a member of the New York Yacht Club and the Seawanhawka-Corinthian Yacht Club.\n\nHe was president of the Trust Company of the Republic which failed in 1903 due to the financial failure of United States Shipbuilding Company. He was also president of the Merchants Association and of the silk commission house of Dresser & Co.\n\nIn 1908, he was the leader of the Progressive Party in Rhode Island.\n\nNear the end of his life he had patented a steam generator but was unable to attract investors to bring it to market.\n\nIn November 1889, he married Emma Louise Burnham (b. 1870) at St. Luke's Church in Matteawan, near Newburgh, New York. She was the daughter of Douglass Williams Burnham (1843–1893) and Hannah Elizabeth Blodgett (b. 1845). Together, they had two children: Susan Fish Dresser (b. 1890) Daniel LeRoy Dresser, Jr. (1894–1950) Emma divorced Dresser in 1908, citing Mr. Dresser's mental instability, since the failure of the Trust Company of the Republic in 1903.\n\nOn December 22, 1914, he married for the second time to Mrs. Marcia Walther Baldwin, an actress and pianist.\n\nOn July 10, 1915, shot and killed himself with a .38 caliber revolver at the Delta Psi Fraternity house on Riverside Drive in New York City."
