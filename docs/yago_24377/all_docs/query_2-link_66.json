        "text": "Jack Norworth (5 January, 1879 - 1 September, 1959) was a U.S. songwriter, singer and vaudeville performer. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Norworth is credited as co-writer of a number of Tin Pan Alley hits. He wrote the lyrics of the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" in 1908, his most long lasting hit. But it wasn't until 1940 that he actually witnessed a baseball game. His \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\" was an even bigger hit at the time. There is some disagreement about Norworth's involvement in the latter. Broadway historian John Kenrick credits Edward Madden and Gus Edwards, while the family of Follies songwriter Dave Stamper [ [http://nfo.net/cal/ts8.html#Stamper Dave Stamper] ] claims he wrote the song while working as pianist for Nora Bayes, the credited co-writer.\n\nOther popular songs credited to Norworth include \"Back to My Old Home Town\"; \"Come Along, My Mandy\"; \"Dear Dolly\"; \"Good Evening, Caroline\"; \"Holding Hands\"; \"Honey Boy\"; \"I'm Glad I'm a Boy/I'm Glad I'm a Girl\"; \"I'm Glad I'm Married\"; \"Kitty\"; \"Meet Me in Apple Blossom Time\"; \"Over on the Jersey Side\"; \"Since My Mother Was a Girl\"; \"Sing an Irish Song\" and \"Smarty.\" \"Turn out Your Light, Mr. Moon Man\" is a sequel to \"Shine on, Harvest Moon.\"\n\nIn 1908 he married Nora Bayes, with whom he performed in vaudeville. Following the Ziegfeld Follies (1909), Norworth appeared in a number of Broadway theater productions and was heard on early radio, such as his March 1928 guest appearance on \"Acousticon Hour\".\n\nAfter Bayes, he was married to actress Louise Dresser. He appeared in early sound films with his third wife, Dorothy Adelphi. An inductee in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Norworth died of a heart attack in Laguna Beach, California. He was portrayed by Dennis Morgan in the musical film \"Shine on, Harvest Moon\" (1944).\n\nReferences\n\nListen to\n\n* [http://www.archive.org/details/JackNorworth Jack Norworth (five songs)]\n\nExternal links"
