        "text": "I know I said vaudeville playbills were seldom seen, but I did come across a modest example at an antiques mall a couple weeks ago. Because it’s not illustrated and its size and typeface are so small, I’d say it was a program rather than a real playbill. But a little research turned up some interesting stories, so I’m glad I spent the $8. Go down the list with me and I’ll tell you what I discovered.\n\nStart at the top. This program comes from Benjamin Franklin Keith’s Theatre on Washington Street in Boston, a top quality theater showing Big Time vaudeville acts. Here is a view of the interior. Keith’s Theatre was built in 1894, so it was pretty new in 1905 when these acts played there. (Sadly, it was demolished in the 1950s, but it was the first of Keith’s empire of vaudeville theaters.) It was Keith’s idea to develop a chain of theaters into a circuit through which vaudeville acts would circulate. Imagine what an improvement this was from the old system of each theater having to book each of 9 acts individually, each and every week. Keith brought order to vaudeville chaos. Now it was the goal of every act to be part of a circuit, preferably a Big Time circuit like Keith’s.\n\nHow can there be 17 individual acts? In traditional vaudeville, 8 or 9 acts made up an entire show. Well, it turns out some theaters ran continually and this is one of them. Look at the top: “Performance Continuous Until 10:00 P.M.” From 1:00 in the afternoon until 10:00 at night, these 17 acts ran in a continual loop, one after another, over and over.\n\nLook at Act A. What’s a Stereopticon? It’s like a slide projector. It was sometimes called a Magic Lantern. In the days before motion pictures, it was a big thrill to see images of far away places, like France and Italy, as shown here. Next came the Holemen Brothers, comedy gymnasts from Europe, followed by Henry Waite, a trick violinist, and Naomi Ethardo, a European Equilibrist. What the heck is that? Think “equilibrium.” Naomi was a rope dancer, sometimes called a tight-rope walker or slack-rope walker, depending on the tension in the rope. Next came Lambert and Pierce, Two Men in Black. Maybe they performed in “blackface.” It was very popular and quite common in those days. But who on earth knows what Marvelous LePage, a “novelty jumper,” did for his (or her?) act? High jumping? Pole vaulting? More likely trick tumbling but your guess is as good as mine.\n\nNow we get to a real headliner. This is Jack Norworth, probably the most famous person on the list. He was a comedian, magician, song writer, and singer who combined all of these talents in his popular act. This is early in Jack’s long career, but he was one of vaudeville’s top acts, having started in show biz as a blackface monologist and singer billed as “the Jailhouse Coon.” Not very politically correct today, but hey, that’s the way it was a century ago. Jack wrote many songs, and you definitely know one of them—it’s sung every day during baseball season: “Take Me Out to the Ballgame (1908).” Some say he had never attended a baseball game in his life! Click on this link for an old recording of the song and a look at early 20th-century baseball. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY8H58Ry_Gw Also in 1908, Jack married another headliner (that’s the vaudeville term for “star”), a singer named Nora Bayes, shown here with Jack. They traveled together in her private railroad car, something unimaginably elegant at the time, like having your own executive jet today. They divorced a few years later.\n\nJump ahead to letter L. That’s Louise Dresser, another headliner who sang and told jokes. For years she had an act called Louise Dresser and her Picks. “Picks” is short for “pickaninnies.” Again, not very PC but using young black children in vaudeville acts was popular and represented a unique employment opportunity for talented kids. They usually sang and danced, and occasionally played musical instruments, as shown here. Bill “Bojangles” Robinson was one of many black performers who got his start in entertainment as a vaudeville pickaninny in 1892.\n\nAnyway, back to Louise Dresser. Louise also married Jack Norworth. They weren’t married when they performed here at Keith’s Theatre in 1905, but they undoubtedly knew each other and watched each other perform. Perhaps they were having a torrid affair. Perhaps they scarcely spoke. We can only speculate. Louise left vaudeville for Hollywood silent movies in the early 1920s.\n\nAfter Jack Norworth’s act came Harry Booker and James F. Corbley who performed what sounds like an Irish skit. Then a violinist for lovers of classical music followed by another short skit by Frank Rae and Gussie Brosche. The next slot was the Agoust Family of jugglers, here in Boston for the first time in 4 years, the program says. Then Louise Dresser (without her “Picks” since they aren’t mentioned) and then the Eight Allisons, European acrobats. Do you see how the word “European” is used to make acts sound more prestigious? These were probably just recent immigrants, but it made them seem exotic.\n\nComedians Smith and Campbell were in position N, followed by Howard’s Ponies and Dogs. Believe it or not, Howard and his pets were pretty well known. His miniature ponies did tricks with the dogs . . . not sure what sort of dogs they were.\n\nThe Kinetograph came next. This was an early motion picture projector developed at the Edison labs that showed very short, rather jerky silent films. Last on the list came Harry Dudley and Alice Cheslyn who sang and told stories. Once those two had finished, it was back to the beginning for Stereopticon Views of France and Italy and so on down the list.\n\nSo now you’ve seen the entire show. Time to leave the theater, unless you want to stay in your seat and watch all the performances again!\n\nLook at these cute boys! How old do you think they were?\n\nIf they were under 7, someone was breaking the law. Although kiddie acts were a mainstay of old vaudeville, the dreaded “Gerry society” tried its best for decades to keep them off the stage.\n\nProperly known as the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Gerry society got its nickname from its founder, Elbridge T. Gerry, who started it in 1875, nine years after the SPCA was organized to prevent cruelty to animals. Its purpose was to protect children from abuse and exploitation. Now that doesn’t sound bad, but in practice, Gerry was far more concerned about stage moms exploiting their children than he was about starving waifs sleeping in the gutters or sweatshop tots working 14-hour days. He thought theater was immoral (amusement parks too) and referred to child performers “child-slaves of the stage.” His influence led to the passing of strict laws in New York state that regulated what minors could do on stage. Children under 16 were prohibited from singing, dancing, juggling, or performing acrobatics; over 7 could have a small speaking part if they had a Gerry society permit but no one under 7 was allowed on stage at all.\n\nThis ruined the livelihood of many performers. The Keaton family, whose son Buster had been the star of their comedy vaudeville act since he was 3, dealt with the law by swearing that Buster was 7. Others tried to pass their children off as midgets. In his memoirs, Buster says that he and his father were arrested nearly every other week. Presumably they paid the fine at the police station or talked their way out of it. In other states, the laws varied and enforcement was uneven. Sometimes vaudevillians could get by without any hassles.\n\nGerry was president or legal advisor of the New York SPCC until his death in 1927. Interestingly, the group exists today. Theatrical producers must still get the Society’s permission for children to go on stage and the group still monitors child actors to make sure they have proper schooling.\n\nI am not a car person. Oh sure, I can tell grey cars from blue cars, and I can identify station wagons, pick up trucks, and convertibles (when their tops are down), but names and makes mean virtually nothing to me because they all look so much alike. So perhaps I am the only person on earth who was surprised to learn what I learned about Model T Fords, the car that my main character drives in my Roaring Twenties stories. (A 1925 version is pictured here.)\n\nDid you know that . . . .?\n\nModel Ts were not even called Model Ts until the middle of the 1920s. People referred to them as Tin Lizzies or flivvers or simply Fords.\n\n15 million of them were manufactured from 1909 to 1927. In the mid-1920s, roughly half the cars on American roads were Model Ts. It was not a luxury car or a beautiful car, but it was cheap, reliable, and within the pocketbook of America’s middle class.\n\nEveryone knows Henry Ford’s famous saying: “You can have any color you like as long as it’s black.” He may or may not have actually said it, but whatever the case, it wasn’t true. Ford factories manufactured Model Ts in several colors. For the first 5 years, customers could choose between red, blue, green, grey, and black. But Henry Ford’s obsession with cost-cutting pushed him to limit the choices to one. From 1913-1925, only black was offered, so perhaps he made that statement in 1913 when they eliminated colors. Why? Because black paint was the cheapest and most durable, and Henry was hell bent on reducing the price of his cars, so black it was. In an attempt to boost sales, he returned to a choice of colors for the last two years of the Model T’s production.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I always thought the Model T referred to a particular car that varied little over its lifetime. The second part of that sentence is true—the design hardly changed from year to year—but there were many different models each year, all built with the same engine and chassis (that’s the frame, for those of you who, like me, didn’t know). The only variable was the body. I discovered that there were roadsters (a la Nancy Drew), speedsters, coupes, coupelets, runabouts, roadster torpedos, town cars, touring cars, and the fordor and tudor sedans (get it? 4-door and 2-door . . . heh, heh.)\n\nNow I need to decide which one my main character drives. Sigh . . . choices, choices . . ."
