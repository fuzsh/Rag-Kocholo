        "text": "Louise Dresser (October 5, 1878 – April 24, 1965) was an American actress.\n\nBorn Louise Josephine Kerlin in Evansville, Indiana, her first film was The Glory of Clementina (1922), and her first starring role was in The City that Never Sleeps (1924).\n\nShe took her professional last name as a tribute to her good friend, songwriter Paul Dresser. Dresser, the elder brother of novelist Theodore Dreiser, was a popular songwriter of the turn of the 20th century. During the first presentations of the Academy Awards in 1929 she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for A Ship Comes In.\n\nShe portrayed Empress Elizabeth in Paramount Pictures's The Scarlet Empress (1934). Dresser's last film was Maid of Salem (1937). On television, she appeared in an episode spotlighting Buster Keaton on Ralph Edwards's program, This is Your Life. She had known Keaton since he was a small boy with his parents in vaudeville.\n\nShe was married twice. First, to Jack Gardner, who died in 1951, and to singer/songwriter, Jack Norworth, whom she divorced. Dresser died in Woodland Hills, California, after surgery for an intestinal ailment, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Dresser died without issue."
