        "text": "Although he and Albert Van Tilzer wrote \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" in 1908, neither man had ever been to a baseball game in person, nor did they go to one for another 32 and 20 years, respectively. On both occasions, they were honored as the composers of baseball's unofficial national anthem.\n\nAlthough famous for writing \"Shine On, Harvest Moon,\" his most popular song by far is \"Take Me Out To the Ballgame,\" which he wrote in 1908. Only \"Happy Birthday\" and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" are sung more often."
