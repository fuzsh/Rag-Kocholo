This is still an evolving section, so some will be either blank or incomplete and in process. Each biography contains some unique bits of information on that individual and their life, often challenging previous versions of their story, all backed up by facts culled from my research. For further information I may suggest certain reference sources, and for an overall view of good references currently available or tucked away in your local library, please check out my Ragtime Books and Ragtime Music Collections pages. I am not trying to duplicate the efforts of anybody else, just enhance some of what is already available in a concise and easy to access format, often with corrections made to historical inaccuracies. Comments are always welcome."
