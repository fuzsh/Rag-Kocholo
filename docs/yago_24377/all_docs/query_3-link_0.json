        "text": "American actress (1878–1965)\n\nLouise Dresser (born Louise Josephine Kerlin;[1] October 5, 1878 – April 24, 1965) was an American actress.[2] She is perhaps best known for her roles in the many films in which she played the wife of Will Rogers, including State Fair and David Harum.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLouise Josephine Kerlin was born on October 5, 1878, in Evansville, Indiana to Ida (née Shaffer) and William S. Kerlin, a railroad engineer who died when she was 15 years old. She had a younger brother, William Lambert Kerlin.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDresser took her professional last name from Paul Dresser, who was a friend of her father. Upon finding out Louise was William Kerlin's daughter, he launched her as his younger sister, and she took on his last name. Many people believed the two were related, and when Paul died, Louise was mentioned in his obituary as a surviving relative.[3]\n\nDresser worked as a burlesque dancer and a singer at the Boston dime museum and then made her vaudeville debut in 1900. She formed a team named \"Louise Dresser and Her Picks\", a singing act that was backed by a chorus of African-American children. In 1906, she began to play New York vaudeville stages, and that year, she was in the musical About Town with Lew Fields, which was a hit. The following year, she was in the hit show Girl Behind the Counter, which ran for 260 performances.[4]\n\nAfter vaudeville, Dresser's success continued on Broadway, where she starred with De Wolf Hopper in Matinee Idol (1910-1912), and appeared in Broadway to Paris (1912), Potash and Perlmutter (1913), and Hello Broadway! (1914).[5] Her final Broadway show was Have a Heart (1917), which received good reviews.[citation needed]\n\nDresser made her film debut in The Glory of Clementina (1922), and her first starring role was in The City That Never Sleeps (1924). In 1925, she starred in The Eagle, opposite Rudolph Valentino and Vilma Bánky as Catherine the Great, and played the title role in The Goose Woman, alongside Jack Pickford.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the first presentations of the Academy Awards in 1929, Dresser was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for A Ship Comes In.\n\nIn 1930, she acted as Al Jolson's mother in Mammy, and she portrayed Empress Elizabeth in The Scarlet Empress (1934). Her last film was Maid of Salem (1937). On television, she appeared in an episode spotlighting Buster Keaton on Ralph Edwards's program This Is Your Life. She had known Keaton since he was a small boy with his parents in vaudeville.[citation needed]\n\nLater years\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter retiring in 1937, Dresser worked as a volunteer at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital.\n\nIn 1950, Dresser attempted to make a comeback, but she was unable to get any screen roles, which she blamed on rumors of her being deaf.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDresser was married twice. Her first marriage was to singer/songwriter Jack Norworth, whom she married in 1898.[5][6]\n\nShe then wed Jack Gardner in 1910, and they remained together until his death in 1950. Neither union produced any children.[3]\n\nDresser died in Woodland Hills, California after surgery for an intestinal ailment. She had lost much of her fortune trying to establish a racing stable. Her gravesite is at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1922 The Glory of Clementina Lena Fontaine Lost film Burning Sands Kate Bindane Lost film Enter Madame Mrs. Flora Preston 1923 The Fog Mrs. Theddon Lost film Prodigal Daughters Mrs. Forbes Lost film Salomy Jane Mrs. Pete Lost film Ruggles of Red Gap Mrs. Effie Floud Lost film Woman-Proof Wilma Rockwood Lost film To the Ladies Mrs. Kincaid Lost film 1924 The Next Corner Nina Race Lost film What Shall I Do?
