        "text": "Baseball is unofficially America's Favorite Pastime, and it's more than just the game.\n\nFrom long home runs to perfect games to even nasty fights, there is never a dull moment. Nothing, however, compares to singing \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" with thousands of strangers. The iconic song has become a staple at stadiums across the United States and is more than 100 years old.\n\nHave you ever wondered how the tune became synonymous with the seventh-inning stretch? There is quite an expansive backstory.\n\nThe History Behind \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"\n\nRELATED: Ladies Won't Stop Storming the Field to Hug This Dodgers Star, Apparently\n\nThe Tin Pan Alley song, written by Jack Norworth and composed by Albert Von Tilzer, was created in 1908. Interestingly, neither songwriter involved in the creative process had ever attended a ballpark before; Norworth was inspired by an ad for the Polo Grounds on a New York subway car.\n\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, the song was written by Norworth as an ode to his suffragist girlfriend, Trixie Friganza, who was also a famous vaudeville actress. Norworth, however, was still married to actress Louise Dresser when he had an affair with Friganza and wrote the song.\n\nNora Bayes, Norworth's wife, was the first person to sing the song, and it became a staple of local vaudeville acts. Bayes had a successful career as a singer and even penned a few herself, including the classic \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\", which she and her husband debuted in the famous Ziegfeld Follies. Beyond \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame,\" Bayes is also known for her rendition of the World War I anthem \"Over There,\" penned by famed showman and Vaudevillian George M. Cohan. This was one of many patriotic songs written by Cohan, who also composed \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and \"You're A Grand Old Flag\" to name a few.\n\nIn addition to the famous chorus about peanuts, Cracker Jack, and (root, root) rooting for the home team, there are two other verses that have been omitted from the modern version sung at ballparks. The main character, Katie Casey, is a baseball fanatic, and she will only go on dates with men if they take her to games.\n\nIt took a while to get mainstream attention in the sports world, but once the song was played for the first time during the 1934 World Series, it became a staple for decades. Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly recorded a famous version, and Chicago Cubs legendary announcer Harry Caray delivered some iconic performances as well.\n\nBaseball players and fans around the world are familiar with this work. It was added to the Library of Congress in 2010, and the original lyrics are on display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nOriginal Lyrics\n\nHere's what Norwoth's original 1908 version looked like as sung by Edward Meeker:\n\nKatie Casey was baseball mad,\n\nHad the fever and had it bad.\n\nJust to root for the home town crew,\n\nEv'ry sou\n\nKatie blew.\n\nOn a Saturday her young beau\n\nCalled to see if she'd like to go\n\nTo see a show, but Miss Kate said \"No,\n\nI'll tell you what you can do:\"\n\nChorus\n\nTake me out to the ball game,\n\nTake me out with the crowd;\n\nBuy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,\n\nI don't care if I never get back.\n\nLet me root, root, root for the home team,\n\nIf they don't win, it's a shame.\n\nFor it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,\n\nAt the old ball game.\n\nKatie Casey saw all the games,\n\nKnew the players by their first names.\n\nTold the umpire he was wrong,\n\nAll along,\n\nGood and strong.\n\nWhen the score was just two to two,\n\nKatie Casey knew what to do,\n\nJust to cheer up the boys she knew,\n\nShe made the gang sing this song:\n\nChorus\n\nThe next time you go to a MLB game, take a look around the stadium and see how many fans sing along to \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame.\" Its prominence still permeates baseball today, and it will be around for decades more.\n\nPersonally, to say that I'm excited for the Major League Baseball season to start would be an understatement. The truncated, 60-game 2020 was fine, but the constant COVID cases and worry about if the season would be shut down took a toll on many fans, myself included.\n\nWith things looking up, fans will be allowed to attend baseball games again in 2021, and when they do, they'll be reminded of everything they missed last year, including the most famous baseball song in history, \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\"\n\nThis article was originally published March 2, 2021."
