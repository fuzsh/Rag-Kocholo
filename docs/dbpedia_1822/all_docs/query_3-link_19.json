        "text": "Comprehensive Advising and Support\n\nA team of helpful ISA staff members is here to support you through the entire study abroad process, from finding the perfect program through re-entry. The Program Advisors will help you choose your program based on your unique objectives. Once you’ve selected your program, you will work with your Program Manager on the application process as well as pre-departure forms and finances. Your Program Manager will also assist with academics, housing, visas, and city-living/cultural guidance.\n\nIn addition to individual advising, you will receive virtual resources to help prepare you for your time abroad. This includes the ISA Student Portal, which houses your program application, pre-departure forms/resources, and the online orientation. The online orientation is a pre-cursor to the on-site orientations and offers city-specific resources about living in your host city, communication, packing, diversity abroad, how to be academically successful, and more.\n\n24-Hour Emergency\n\nThe ISA Health, Safety, and Security team facilitates an in-house on-call system with a U.S.-based employee and manager who are on-call and available in case of emergency 24-7. ISA regular office hours are Monday through Thursday, 7:00am - 7:00pm and Friday, 7:00am - 5:00pm Central Time.\n\nIf you are a parent or student needing assistance in an emergency situation outside of the regular office hours, please call the ISA office at 512-480-8522 to access the ISA emergency contact information for that particular week. Students who experience an emergency while abroad will also have access to on-site staff 24-hour emergency assistance.\n\nAirport Reception\n\nGround transportation is provided from the airport as long as you arrive during the ISA designated arrival date and time and at the appropriate airport. Upon acceptance into your program, you will receive the “How to Book Your Flight” form which outlines the specific details for airport reception.\n\nAirport reception is not provided for most Intensive Month or J-Term programs.\n\nSpanish Visa Support\n\nYour ISA Program Manager will be available to help you with the visa process for Spain, if a visa is needed for your program. They will provide resources, guidance on necessary steps to obtain your visa, and deliver supporting visa application materials to you as needed. A Spanish student visa is required for U.S. students participating in academic programs in Spain lasting 91 days or more. For non-U.S. citizens, you should contact your consulate to verify specific entry requirements.\n\nTo obtain a Spanish student visa, you must:\n\nA) schedule an appointment (where applicable) and apply in person at the consulate, or\n\nB) take part in the ISA Spain Visa Service* (if applicable), where you may pay an extra fee for ISA to schedule and attend an appointment on your behalf.\n\nNote: the ISA Spain Visa Service typically has deadlines well in advance of your program application deadline, often 1 month earlier or more. This is due to the appointment dates the consulate gives ISA. Should you want to use the ISA Spain Visa Service, we encourage you to apply to your program as early as possible.\n\nFailure to obtain a visa for programs lasting 91 days or more could result in you having to cancel or switch programs.\n\nPlease contact your ISA Program Manager for more information regarding the Spain Visa Service or any visa related questions or concerns.\n\nISA Discovery Model\n\nISA programs facilitate learning and development through co-curricular activities. We rely on host universities to provide quality instruction in the classroom, but ISA is the main facilitator of learning outside of the classroom. Efforts to promote student learning are shaped by a teaching and learning framework we call the ISA Discovery Model.\n\nAccording to this model, student learning and development is organized into five areas of discovery: 1. Intercultural, 2. Historical, 3. Sociopolitical, 4. Professional and 5. Environmental\n\nThroughout the duration of your ISA program, we provide you with the opportunity to pursue these five areas of discovery through the Bridging Cultures Orientation, excursions, cultural activities, and references to non-ISA sponsored events and opportunities.\n\nExcursions\n\nOrganized excursions are included with each program to complement the academic component of your abroad experience. These complementary experiences are designed to engage student learning outside of the classroom in the five areas of the Discovery Model. Transportation and guided tours are included, as well as hotel accommodations and breakfast during multi-day excursions. Additional optional excursions may be offered during each program that are not included in the program cost.\n\nExcursions are not included for Intensive Month, J-Term, and some summer sessions.\n\nInsurance\n\nA Blanket Accident and Sickness Policy is included in the program and covers you during the official on-site period of the program. This is not an optional benefit; every ISA participant will be covered by this policy. A full description of coverage can be found on the ISA website.\n\nWe recommend that you maintain comprehensive health insurance while abroad. This is particularly important if you have any pre-existing conditions but is also beneficial if you have an injury or illness while abroad and require further treatment upon your return home. Please be sure to consult with your current insurance provider to confirm coverage policies while traveling abroad.\n\nOfficial Transcript from the Host University\n\nUpon completion of the ISA program, your host university will issue an official transcript with all coursework taken abroad. ISA's Academic Records Department will process and forward the official transcript to the appropriate office at your home university, and a photocopy will be sent to your permanent home address for your records. ISA will provide a cover letter to accompany the transcript with important academic information, including the host university's grading system and recommended U.S. letter grade equivalencies, translated course titles, and credit conversion recommendations."
