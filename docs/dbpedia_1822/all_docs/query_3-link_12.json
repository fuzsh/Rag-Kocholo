        "text": "– This post was written by Layla Duranni –\n\nHave you always dreamed of visiting New York City’s famous Observation Deck, famed for its impressive view? If so, when’s the best time to visit Top of the Rock and snap pics of those spectacular vistas?\n\nRenowned for its stunning cityscape views, it’s a tourist hotspot. Whether you’re new or a regular, when you choose to visit Top of the Rock will dictate your experience – every season and time of day offers something different from New York City’s skyline.\n\nBest time to visit Top of the Rock to avoid crowds\n\n🗓️ Weekdays vs. Weekends\n\nTypically, weekdays will have fewer tourists, allowing you slightly more room to enjoy the fresh air and stunning views. Meanwhile, weekends draw more people, so it’s up to you to decide when planning your NYC itinerary when it’s best for you to see Top of the Rock.\n\n🕒 Morning vs. Evening: See the Sunrise or Sunset\n\nAccording to Top of the Rock, there are two times best for beating the crowd. The least busy time is right after they open at 9 am or later at night, from 8 pm onward.\n\nThe decision to visit in the morning or evening depends on whether you want to see the sunrise or sunset. If you’re an early riser, why not see the city wake up and enjoy a sunrise? If you’re a night owl, no problem, you can watch the gorgeous city transform at sunset instead.\n\n👪 Visiting with Kids\n\nIf you’re going to be visiting with your kids, the morning often provides a great time to start since the kids will be energetic and ready to explore. They’ll love the Sky Shuttle elevator that quickly goes up 200 meters in less than a minute, plus the 45-60 minute (on average) visit time will be just long enough to keep them from getting antsy!\n\n🌆 Sunrise\n\nSeeing the sunrise from the Top of the Rock is amazing. Watch as the skyscrapers and landmarks light up and reflect the early morning sunshine. This is also a great time to take photos without too many people around getting in the way of your perfect shot.\n\n🌤️ Midday\n\nIf you prefer a lively and busy vibe, midday offers something different. The city’s busy with people going about their activities, including tourists visiting Top of the Rock! Expect longer lines at this time of day!\n\n🌇 Sunset\n\nA Top of the Rock sunset is the perfect way to cap your day in New York. You’ll get amazing sunset views of cotton candy pinks and bold oranges washing over the city.\n\n🌃 Night\n\nAfter sunset, a night view from the Top of the Rock is sure to be a memorable one. The bright lights from skyscrapers and bridges create a glittering contrast to the night sky.
