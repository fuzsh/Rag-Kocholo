        "text": "Walking in Catalonia: Overview\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nI’ve been travelling to Catalonia for many years as a guidebook author and, in my opinion, there’s no better way to get to know this corner of Spain than by walking the trails that meander through the region’s natural parks, connect remote villages, and run inland from the coast towards the pre-Pyrenees.\n\nFor enthusiasts there are a number of recommended long-distance paths that make great point–to-point walking holidays. And for the casual hiker you can base yourself near any of the various parks for more accessible day hikes.\n\nThe walking trails in Catalonia are generally well-signposted, and while some trails see a great number of people, especially at weekends, it is possible to find less visited areas. Here’s my expert guide to the best walks and hikes near Barcelona.\n\nCatalonia\n\nMontseny Natural Park\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nLess than an hour from the buzzing city of Barcelona the forested slopes of Montseny Natural Park are criss-crossed with a network of footpaths, with many trails climbing the three highest peaks; Turó de l’Home (1,706m), Les Agudes (1,703m) or Matagalls (1,697m).\n\nThe peaks might be lower than 2,000 metres, but on a clear day, you can enjoy the views all the way to the Pyrenees. Autumn dresses the slopes in spectacular colours, and I find the conditions at this time to be perfect for walking.\n\nCatalonia\n\nSant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nThere are numerous ways to reach the peaks of La Mola (1,103m) and Montcau (1,056m) but surprisingly, many other excellent routes are somehow less trodden in this Natural Park.\n\nOn the Alzina del Salari circular route, you won’t have to share the amazing views towards the jagged mountains of Montserrat with many hikers. And the trail from Matadepera to the Castellasa de Can Torres treats you to amazing views of interesting rock formations.\n\nCatalonia\n\nMontserrat\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nThe monastery with its rock background is a popular destination, and while most visitors arrive by car or the funicular, my favourite way to reach the monastery is by foot, following the occasionally steep trail from the village of Monistrol de Montserrat or from Colbató.\n\nThe Montserrat range is a paradise for rock climbers, but there are plenty of hiking trails among the rounded rocks that you can enjoy without climbing gear. From the monastery, you can climb Sant Jeroni, the highest peak in the Montserrat, or follow lesser paths to long forgotten ruins.\n\nCatalonia\n\nGarrotxa\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nThe volcanic zone, characterised by the forested volcanic cones separated by fertile land, and the mountains of Alta Garrotxa provides some excellent hiking trails.\n\nThe waterfalls of Salt de Sallent and Salt de la Coromina are at their best in the spring, but if you walk to Salt de Brull in the summer heat, you can stop for a refreshing dip in one of the many inviting rock pools.\n\nYou will also find a small church curiously built in the crater of a volcano, a historic trading route, and the remains of a 15th-century monastery, and plenty more in this relatively small area of Catalonia.\n\nCatalonia\n\nCadí-Moixeró Natural Park\n\nBy Nike Werstroh\n\nThe natural park was established in 1983, and there are numerous signposted trails with some excellent views towards the nearby Pyrenees. With a ski station and ski lifts that operate throughout the summer months as well, La Tosa (2,536m) is a busy mountaintop, but the views are just as good from the nearby, less crowded Penyes Altes de Moixeró (2,276m).\n\nIf the scrambling route to Pedraforca is not for you, take the Pedraforca 360 trail from Gósol, that encircles the mountain without climbing it, or enjoy some views of the iconic mountain from the nearby Comabona.\n\nMost hiking routes in the Barcelona region can be walked all year round, but perhaps my favourite months are spring, early summer and autumn.\n\nThe Montseny mountains are cooler than on the coast and you can enjoy some trails even on hot summer days. But when the summer holidays are over, in September, you can enjoy fine weather without the crowds.\n\nThe mountains are higher in the Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park, and the close proximity to the Pyrenees means cooler temperatures and variable weather conditions, so hiking season here runs from June to September. I prefer to visit in June when wildflowers are in bloom and the crowds are still thin.\n\nFrom Barcelona there is a train service to Monistrol de Montserrat, Vic and regular services along the coast. There are buses from Barcelona, Girona, Olot, Berga and Ripoll to other towns, but buses in rural areas are not frequent.\n\nYou’ll need your own transport to reach some of the more remote areas, and if you hire a car from Barcelona you can get better deals by booking in advance online."
