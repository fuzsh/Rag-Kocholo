        "text": "How do I get to Spain?\n\nGetting to Spain depends on where you're coming from, but most travelers fly into one of the country's major airports, as it's typically the quickest way to get here. The largest airports are in Barcelona, Madrid, Málaga, and Mallorca, though there are several other options throughout Spain.\n\nIf traveling from the United States, you have your choice of direct flights to Madrid and/or Barcelona from:\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nDallas\n\nMiami\n\nOther direct North American routes include:\n\nToronto to Barcelona or Madrid\n\nMontréal to Barcelona or Málaga\n\nMexico City to Barcelona or Madrid\n\nThe airlines that fly these routes include American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines, Air Canada, Air Transat, and Aeromexico. Of course, you can get to Spain from other North American cities, but those routes will require a layover.\n\nFor flights within the European continent, nearly every country offers at least one nonstop option to numerous Spanish airports, including from places like London, Dublin, Paris, Athens, Munich, Budapest, Prague, Rome, and many more.\n\nIf you're coming from a nearby country, such as Portugal, France, or Morocco, you could get to Spain by train, car, bus, or ferry. A popular night train connects Lisbon and Madrid, and you'll find plenty of routes from France, including regular journeys from Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse. As for ferries, there are regular sailings from Tangier, Morocco, to southern Spain and Barcelona, plus a few other routes to different Morrocan and Spanish cities.\n\nDo I need a visa?\n\nCitizens of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and most Latin American and European countries, plus a few Asian and Middle Eastern countries, are entitled to stay in Spain for up to 90 days with a valid passport. Other nationalities require a visa and can apply for one at the nearest consulate or embassy.\n\nFrom 2025, non-EU citizens will need electronic authorization, known as an ETIAS, to visit Spain. You'll be able to apply for this online for $7, and it's valid for three years. Find out more in our guide to applying for an ETIAS.\n\nWhat are the entry requirements for Spain?\n\nPlease check here for the latest entry requirements for Spain.\n\nIs Spain a safe place for travelers?\n\nSpain is a safe place to travel, especially compared to other countries. That said, tourism is a cornerstone of Spain's economy, and the country is consistently one of the top five tourist destinations worldwide. Along with tourism often comes a fair share of petty crime, so it's best to always exercise caution when you're out and about. The top two crimes in Spain are bag snatching (often from someone riding a motorbike) and pickpocketing (often in crowded areas and on public transportation).\n\nTo help you avoid any incidences, it's best to\n\nRefrain from overt displays of wealth\n\nSecure any valuables in hotel safes\n\nStay in well-lit areas at night\n\nUse common sense\n\nKeep an eye on your personal belongings\n\nNever leave valuables on display in your car\n\nFor those wearing a purse or crossbody bag, keep it in front of you rather than resting on your back. For backpacks, use an antitheft pack, put locks on the zippers, carry your bag in front of you while on public transport, and, at the very least, don't put any valuables in front pockets.\n\nCan I bring my children?\n\nAbsolutely! Not only can you bring your children, but you should, as Spain is an incredibly kid- and family-friendly destination.\n\nSpanish people and the Spanish culture are warm, kind, and family-oriented, and your kids will surely love all the country's many activities. Some experiences in Spain almost seem made for kids, young and old, such as exploring castles, palaces, and fortresses, hiking in nature, playing in parks, swimming at the beach, and sailing along the coast. As a bonus, Spanish gastronomy can win over any picky eater, as tapas are inherently kid-friendly.\n\nEach city almost feels like an outdoor playground for families. Take Barcelona, for example. Family-friendly attractions include the buzzy La Rambla lined with street performers and kiosks; the Mercat de la Boqueria, where you can pick up smoothies and other goodies from vendors; the incredible works of Antoni Gaudí, including La Sagrada Família and the whimsical Park Güell; the waterfront promenade and port with its walkway over the marina; the cable car that takes you above the city from Port Vell to Montjuïc Hill; and numerous city beaches.\n\nBut there are many other kid-friendly activities throughout Spain, including Flamenco shows in Seville, visiting the Royal Palace of Madrid, spending all day at the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, riding e-bikes in Catalonia, and snorkeling and swimming in Mallorca.\n\nRead more about Spain for families here.\n\nI don't speak Spanish. Can I get around on my own?\n\nOf course! Because Spain relies heavily on tourism, you'll find that locals speak English at all major hotels and most restaurants throughout the country, especially in the cities. Though some basic Spanish could be helpful in rural areas or the countryside, you can still get by in those settings without the local language. Plus, multilingualism is common in Spain, as the country has many spoken languages, including Spanish, Catalan, Basque, and Castillian.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, we recommend brushing up on your Spanish a few weeks before your trip. Even learning some essential words and phrases can elevate your experience in the country, as locals tend to respond warmly if you attempt to speak their language. Even a friendly hola, gracias, or por favor will get you a few smiles!\n\nHow do I get around Spain?\n\nGetting around Spain is a breeze compared to some other countries. The high-speed and standard train system reaches every corner of the country, the highways are well-maintained and modern, and there are over 50 airports in the country, all supporting domestic routes.\n\nBy shuttle service/private transfer\n\nWe recommend using a shuttle service or private transfer for shorter distances. For example, reaching your hotel from the airport or enjoying a day trip out of the city is more convenient and comfortable when using a private service. This option also opens up opportunities to explore more of Spain. Enjoy a day trip and wine tasting in Montserrat from Barcelona, or visit one of the rural villages in Andalusia from Seville or Málaga, all with the help of a private transfer.\n\nThere's an important consideration for families. While child seats can usually be provided upon request, it's essential to note that in Spain, children over five years old are not legally required to be in a child seat. This means that some providers might not automatically include a child seat unless specifically asked. For families with young children, especially those embarking on longer journeys or who prioritize high safety standards, it's advisable to arrange a child seat in advance. You might also consider bringing your own child seat to ensure it meets your safety and quality expectations.\n\nBy train\n\nIf you're planning to visit both ends of the country (say Barcelona and Andalusia) or want to check out the Balearic Islands or the Canary Islands, it's probably best to book a flight. But in other cases, high-speed routes between major cities are typically faster than flying when considering the entire journey time (checking in, security, wait times, etc.). Some of the most common direct train routes in Spain include the following:\n\nMadrid/Barcelona: 2.5 hours\n\nBarcelona/Valencia: 2.5 hours\n\nMadrid/Valencia: 1.75 hours\n\nMadrid/Seville: 2.5 hours\n\nMadrid/Málaga: 2.5 hours\n\nBarcelona/Seville: 5.5 hours\n\nNearly every city in Spain has a train station, and unless you're planning to visit a smaller town, you'll likely find direct routes. Renfe is Spain's national railway company and has a very user-friendly website and app.\n\nPrices vary depending on the route length, the train type, and the travel date. But to give you an example, a roundtrip, high-speed train ticket between Madrid and Barcelona is only about $20 if you book a couple of months in advance. Book your tickets early if you plan to travel around Spain by train, as many routes sell out.\n\nBy plane\n\nFor longer journeys, air travel will be the fastest way to get from one point to the other, especially if you're planning to traverse the entire country or visit the islands. Spain has three domestic airlines that serve the country's airports: Iberia, Vueling, and Air Europa. These airlines also offer international routes, and you'll find plenty of other global airlines.\n\nThough prices fluctuate often, you can find reasonable flights if you book at least a couple of months in advance. To give you a general idea, here are some of the most common routes (roundtrip and nonstop) and their prices:\n\nBarcelona/Madrid (1 hour 25 minutes)\n\n$45 to $100 on Iberia\n\n$50 to $65 on Vueling\n\n$80 to $90 on Air Europa\n\nMadrid/Palma de Mallorca (1 hour 25 minutes)\n\n$120 to $130 on Iberia\n\n$110 to $130 on Air Europa\n\nMadrid/Gran Canaria (2 hours 45 minutes)\n\n$100 to $140 on Iberia\n\n$90 to $130 on Air Europa\n\nMadrid/Málaga (1 hour 20 minutes)\n\n$105 to $170 on Iberia\n\n$100 to $160 on Air Europa\n\nBarcelona/Málaga (1 hour 40 minutes)\n\n$100 to $180 on Vueling\n\nBarcelona/Bilbao (1 hour 15 minutes)\n\n$60 to $80 on Vueling\n\nBarcelona/Seville (1 hour 40 minutes)\n\n$80 to $110 on Vueling\n\nMadrid/Santiago de Compostela (1 hour 15 minutes)\n\n$130 to $170 on Iberia\n\nBilbao/Málaga (1 hour 35 minutes)\n\n$100 to $120 on Vueling\n\nBy car\n\nRenting a car is also an excellent option, especially if you want to explore some of the rural areas of Spain. Plus, having your own car means you have far more flexibility with your itinerary. If you need inspiration for an epic road trip through Spain, these are a few of the most popular itineraries:\n\nWild Canary Islands Road Trip: Tenerife, La Gomera & Madrid - 7 Days\n\nUltimate Andalusian Road Trip - 8 Days\n\nUltimate Northern Spain Road Trip: Madrid, Galicia & Basque Country - 12 days\n\nSpain Off-the-Beaten-Path Road Trip: Madrid, La Mancha & Extremadura - 16 days\n\nGenerally speaking, car rentals in Spain are relatively affordable. Many companies offer insurance plans that cover any damage, so you don't need to photograph and film the car before and after renting it. Prices consistently fluctuate depending on economic factors, plus seasonality, availability, car size, and transmission type.\n\nStill, you can generally find week-long rentals (not including insurance) for under $200 for a manual economy car and under $250 for an automatic economy car.\n\nHow big is Spain?\n\nSpain is the fourth largest European country, with over 47 million people living across its nearly 200,000 square miles (517,998 sq km). Spain has over 3,000 miles of coastline, more than 60 islands, and 16 beautiful national parks. But it's best to view Spain as its 17 autonomous communities, each with a unique identity and government.\n\nExploring these different communities allows you to enjoy a truly diverse trip while staying in just one country. Enjoy hiking along the Camino de Santiago in Basque Country, visit the coastal villages of Catalonia, go wine tasting in La Rioja, explore caves in the Balearic Islands, discover street art in Madrid, and enjoy tapas and Flamenco in Seville.\n\nHow many days should I spend in Spain?\n\nHow much time you spend traveling in Spain depends on your overall goals. If you're considering a two-week trip, you can travel the length and breadth of the country's mainland and see its most iconic sites. If you'd like to add Spain's islands to a country-wide trip or spend more time in each destination, we recommend extending your vacation to at least three weeks.\n\nIf you have just one week, you can still enjoy many of Spain's most popular destinations, such as Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville. For a bit of inspiration, these are a few itinerary options for each time frame:\n\nOne week:\n\nBarcelona, Madrid & Seville\n\nBarcelona & Costa Brava\n\nAndalusia: Seville, Ronda, Málaga\n\nTwo weeks:\n\nMadrid & the Canary Islands\n\nMadrid, Seville, Granada & the Balearic Islands\n\nNorthern Spain: Madrid, Bilbao, San Sebastian Vigo & more\n\nThree weeks:\n\nBasque Country to Andalusia\n\nSpain & Portugal\n\nMadrid, Barcelona, Andalusia & the Balearic Islands\n\nHere's more on how many days to spend in Spain.\n\nIs Spain expensive?\n\nThough more expensive than other global destinations, Spain is one of the most affordable countries in Europe—and one of the least expensive in Western Europe. But remember that Spain is a popular tourist destination, so a lot depends on when you plan to travel and your preferred travel style.\n\nThe average cost of a hotel room in Spain is over $120 a night. If you prefer higher-end accommodation, such as boutique luxury hotels, plan to increase your budget. Here's a breakdown of other average per-person costs in Spain, though prices can (and will) fluctuate:\n\nMetro ride: $2-$3\n\nAverage museum/attraction ticket: $10-$20\n\nSit-down dinner: $30\n\nLunchtime meal: $15\n\nCasual tapas: $10\n\nBeer: $3\n\nBottle of wine at a restaurant: $10-$15\n\nCoffee: $3\n\n50 oz (1.5 l) bottled water: $1.50\n\nWhat currency does Spain use?\n\nSpain uses the Euro as its currency and doesn't accept US dollars.\n\nAre credit cards widely accepted?\n\nYes, credit cards are widely accepted almost everywhere in Spain, including in market halls and small towns. If you plan to spend a lot of time in the rural countryside, it's best to bring some cash with you. Though uncommon nowadays, it wouldn't necessarily be surprising if a small family-owned café doesn't accept credit cards.\n\nHow much cash should I bring with me?\n\nBecause petty crimes like pickpocketing and bag snatching are high in Spain, it's best not to carry a lot of cash with you. You might use a little cash here and there to buy a drink at a stand or for tipping, so you really only need $10 to $20 at any given time.\n\nIs there a tipping culture in Spain?\n\nThe answer to this question is up for debate! Spain doesn't have a tipping culture like the United States, as workers receive a living wage rather than a service wage and don't rely on tips to earn the difference. Still, it's customary to tip in some places in Spain, though only about 5% to 15%.\n\nThere's no need to tip if you're grabbing tapas, drinks, or coffee. If you want to leave something, round up to the nearest Euro, as tipping in cafés and bars is casual. Don't be surprised if the server gives it back to you!\n\nIf you're going out for a nice meal at a restaurant, tipping is normal and how much you give depends on how you liked the service and experience. If the service was average, leave 10%. If the service was outstanding, go with 15%.\n\nBefore leaving a tip, look at your bill, especially if you're dining at a place popular with travelers. In some touristy areas, restaurants might add a service charge, even though it's illegal to do so in Spain; if something doesn't look right on your bill, simply ask. Regarding other tips, it's customary to give your tour guide a little extra on top of the fee (around 10%) and to tip taxi drivers a Euro or two.\n\nWhat will the weather be like?\n\nSpain is a vast country with a landscape that ranges from ice-topped mountains in the Pyrenees to subtropical beaches along the southern coast. Spring and autumn generally offer sunshine and pleasant temperatures with fewer tourists, while summer can see sweltering temperatures and full resorts, especially during Spain's holiday month of August.\n\nYou can find detailed breakdowns of Spain's weather by month in our travel advice section, but here's a general outline of the weather by region:\n\nNorth and northwest Spain: this green, lush region has an oceanic climate that's influenced by depressions moving across the Atlantic. This makes it cooler and wetter than elsewhere in Spain, especially in winter. Summer still brings plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures.\n\nCentral Spain: this region has a continental climate with very hot and dry summers contrasted with cold winters that can also see heavy rainfall. Madrid, in particular, gets scorching in the summer, so locals head to the mountains or coast. Spring and fall offer plenty of blue skies and mild temperatures ideal for exploring.\n\nSouth and Balearic Islands: this region enjoys a Mediterranean climate that brings dry, warm weather, blue skies, and sunshine all year round. Temperatures can soar to the mid 90s°F (34-36°C) in the height of summer but coastal winds bring relief to beaches.\n\nMountains: expect snowy, cold winters and mild summers in Spain's mountainous regions, such as the Sierra Nevada, Pyrenees, and Baetic mountains. The ski season runs roughly from December to March in the Pyrenees, while resorts in the Sierra Nevada region can remain open until May.\n\nWhat should I pack?\n\nWhat you bring to Spain depends on your planned itinerary and in which season you're traveling. Remember that Spain is a large country, so the weather, climate, and terrain vary from north to south. Our packing list for Spain goes into much more depth about how to pack for each season and region, but for a quick list, we've got you covered here:\n\nClothing and shoes\n\nSun protection (sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, etc.)\n\nWarm jacket (in winter)\n\nRainjacket and/or umbrella (in rainy areas/seasons)\n\nLightweight jacket or light sweater\n\nLong pants (especially in winter or if hiking)\n\nShorts, skirts, sundresses (for warmer months)\n\nA mix of short- and long-sleeved shirts\n\nSweaters (in winter)\n\nGloves, hats, scarves (in winter)\n\nBeach and/or water shoes (for swimming)\n\nSwimsuit\n\nSturdy walking shoes (waterproof in winter or rainy seasons)\n\nHiking boots (if hiking)\n\nUnderwear and socks\n\nSleepwear\n\nOther personal items and electronics\n\nToiletries\n\nDaypack or crossbody bag\n\nMedication and medical paperwork (if needed)\n\nPhone and charger\n\nOther electronics and chargers/batteries (laptop, e-reader, tablet, camera, etc.)\n\nTravel adapters\n\nEssential documents (driver's license, insurance card, tickets, reservations, etc.)\n\nPassports (besides travel, many monuments and museums in Spain require passports to enter, including Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, the Alcázar in Seville, and the Prado Museum and Royal Palace in Madrid)\n\nBooks\n\nReusable grocery bag\n\nCredit cards (and remember to notify your bank that you're traveling.\n\nDo I need to bring an electrical adapter/converter?\n\nFor outlets, Spain uses the Type C Euro plug, which you'll find in most European countries (the biggest outliers being the UK and Ireland). You'll need an adapter for those typical electronics, like charging your laptop, camera, phone, etc. You'll need a converter if you use an appliance that requires a different voltage, such as a hair dryer or curling iron. The device should have the voltage listed on it (Spain uses 240 volts), but if it's unclear, check with the manufacturer.\n\nKeep in mind that some tools aren't meant to be used internationally at all, so it's best to check before plugging anything in, as you could break it!\n\nWhat's the Internet like?\n\nYou'll find plenty of free, decent WiFi across Spain in hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Some cities like Barcelona even have free (yet less reliable) public WiFi networks. However, the easiest way to access WiFi while you're traveling is to buy a SIM card with data.\n\nHow do I buy a SIM card?\n\nIf you don't have a roaming package, the easiest way to use your phone in Spain is to buy an eSIM before you arrive. Find out whether your phone has the capability for an eSIM first; generally speaking Google Pixel phones released after 2017, some newer Samsung Galaxy phones and XR/XS iPhone models have built-in eSIMs. Check this list of devices that support eSIMs to find out if your phone is compatible. Here are some of the top eSIMs, that you can buy online:\n\nHolafly\n\nAiralo\n\nUbigi\n\nNomad\n\nAloSIM\n\nIf you can't get an eSIM, stop at an official store to buy a physical SIM card once you arrive in Spain. You'll need to have an unlocked phone and your passport. These top providers in Spain offer the best coverage and plenty of pre-paid SIM options: Vodaphone, Orange, and Movistar.\n\nWhat's the time zone for Spain?\n\nWhen you arrive in Spain, you'll need to set your clock forward, and you should be aware that the country observes daylight savings.\n\nSpain is six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time\n\nSain is seven hours ahead of Central Standard Time\n\nSpain is eight hours ahead of Mountain Standard Time\n\nSpain is nine hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time\n\nWhat is the food like?\n\nSpanish food is arguably some of the best in the world and quite mixed, so it suits numerous tastebuds and preferences. You've likely heard of tapas before, which are simply smaller plates shared among friends and family. This eating style means you can taste more variety and order a range of food to please the entire table (including young, picky eaters).\n\nIf you're vegan, you might have a more challenging time finding traditional Spanish recipes that don't contain animal products, especially if you're traveling out of the major cities. Still, you'll be totally fine in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, San Sebastián, and even Seville.\n\nSome of the most typical tapas include\n\nPatatas bravas (potatoes with a spicy sauce)\n\nPan con tomate (toasted bread topped with grated tomatoes and olive oil)\n\nGambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce)\n\nTortilla española (a thick omelet made with potatoes)\n\nCroquetas (breaded patties stuffed with meat, cheese, and/or vegetables)\n\nJamón Ibérico (thinly shaved ham)\n\nManchego cheese (sheep's cheese from Central Spain)\n\nAlmejas a la marinera (clams served in the shell with a slightly spicy and briny sauce)\n\nPimientos de padrón (small green peppers from Galicia roasted and topped with coarse salt)\n\nChorizo al vino (sausages cooked in wine)\n\nEnsaladilla Rusa (yes, Russian salad!)\n\nBoquerones en vinagre (anchovies in vinegar)\n\nAceitunas españolas (fresh olives)\n\nThat's just a small selection of the many tapas you'll find in Spain. If you're traveling in the northern part of the country, expect to find pintxos instead of tapas, which are simply all these delicious dishes served atop a slice of bread and secured with a toothpick.\n\nOf course, a good Spanish meal goes beyond tapas. Some other must-try dishes include:\n\nPaella\n\nGazpacho\n\nPisto (ratatouille with a fried egg on top)\n\nPollo al ajillo (garlic chicken)\n\nCochinillo asado (roasted pig or lamb)\n\nMarmitako (fish soup)\n\nCocido Madrileño (hearty meat stew from Madrid)\n\nCachopo (breaded fillets of ham, beef, and cheese from Northern Spain)\n\nIf you're on a specific diet or Spanish food doesn't appeal to you, don't worry. All the big cities in Spain have international restaurants, too, so you'll find a lot of variety. One thing to note is that breakfast tends to be very light in Spain, and the most significant meal is lunchtime. So channel your inner Spaniard and relax with a long, leisurely lunch!\n\nWhen do restaurants open?\n\nAh, yes, the Spanish timetable. If you haven't heard of how Spaniards eat, you might be shocked when you go out for dinner and find nothing open. To give you a quick cultural crash course, here's when people typically eat in Spain:\n\nBreakfast: 8 am to 10 am\n\nMorning snack: 11 am to 12 pm\n\nLunch: 2 pm\n\nA light snack: 5 pm\n\nDinner: 8 pm to midnight\n\nOf course, this is a general schedule, and you might find other traditions in different regions. But the key takeaway is that meals (especially lunch and dinner) start much later in Spain than in other countries. That doesn't mean you won't find anything open at 11 am for lunch or 6 pm for dinner, but the bulk of popular sit-down eateries will stick to the country's schedule.\n\nWhy? Historically, Spain follows this unique eating schedule because the country is on Central European Time despite being aligned geographically with Western European Time. That means the sun rises and sets later in the day throughout the year. And because mid-day can be particularly hot, siesta time takes hold after lunch, and locals stay up later to eat and relax in cooler temperatures after the sun goes down.\n\nHow easy is it to travel in Spain with dietary restrictions?\n\nIn cities, tourist destinations, and resorts, you can find restaurants that cater to most diets. However, meat and seafood are a huge part of Spanish cuisine, so traveling as a vegetarian or vegan can be a challenge, especially in small towns and rural areas. You'll find a great selection of world-class vegan and veggie restaurants in places like Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville, though, and there are always local markets selling fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts.\n\nTop Spanish dishes that are naturally vegan and vegetarian friendly or can easily be adapted include: patatas bravas, espinacas con garbanzos (spinach with chickpeas), pimientos de padrón, vegetable paella, olives, salads, and gazpacho. Vegetarians can indulge in Spain's famous tortillas and local cheeses. When you're ordering in restaurants, be clear about your dietary needs, using these useful phrases:\n\nSoy vegetariano (male) vegetariana (female): I’m vegetarian\n\nSoy vegano/a: I'm vegan\n\nSin carne: without meat\n\nSin queso: without cheese\n\nSin huevo: without egg\n\nSin leche: without milk\n\nSin mantequilla: without butter\n\nMany restaurants can also accommodate those with food allergies, just be sure to ask before ordering. Use the phrases sin gluten (without gluten) and sin trigo (without wheat) if you're gluten-free and the phrase: \"soy alergico/a a las nueces\" if you're allergic to nuts.\n\nIs the water drinkable in Spain?\n\nYes, Spain's tap water is safe to drink. Still, you'll notice that many Spaniards prefer bottled drinking water. This is a very common cultural norm throughout Europe, usually due to taste preference. But some countries and cities have done an excellent job keeping tap water tasting delicious, including Madrid, known to be the best water in Spain. Of all the major cities in Spain, you might see people drinking tap water more in the capital.\n\nThis cultural norm is also why you'll notice a lack of tap water in restaurants. If you order water at a restaurant, your server will assume you mean bottled water. If you want tap water, feel free to ask for it. Locals know it as \"agua del grifo,\" usually served in a pitcher.\n\nWhat are the hotels like?\n\nSpain has various accommodation types, but we recommend boutique hotels that give you more of an authentic, local experience. These lodgings aren't typically chain hotels; many are family- or locally owned, and there's a high chance you'll bump into the owner. You'll find plenty of standard, mid-range, and luxury hotels in Spain, so you can easily cater your trip to your budget.\n\nFor the major cities and regions, check out these lists of the best boutique hotels in Spain:\n\nBest boutique hotels in Barcelona\n\nBest boutique hotels in Madrid\n\nBest boutique hotels in Córdoba\n\nBest boutique hotels in Granada\n\nBest boutique hotels in Seville\n\nBest boutique hotels in Málaga\n\nBest boutique hotels in Ronda\n\nBest boutique hotels in San Sebastián\n\nBest boutique hotels in Bilbao\n\nBest boutique hotels in Mallorca\n\nBest boutique hotels on the Costa Brava\n\nAre the hotel rooms in Spain comfortable?\n\nWhen it comes to the best hotels in Spain, you might find that the rooms (especially the bathrooms) are smaller than you're accustomed to, as boutique hotels often transform historical buildings into beautiful and charming accommodations. These buildings range from the 16th to the 20th century, adding to your overall experience.\n\nDon't be too surprised to find less space than in modern buildings, but know that Spanish boutique hotels are comfortable and come with cozy beds and amenities like restaurants, rooftop pools, lounges, bars, toiletries, spas, and more.\n\nIf you need more space or specific amenities, just let us know ahead of time!\n\nAre the hotel rooms in Spain noisy?\n\nSpain has a bit of a reputation for thin walls, which can sometimes make hotel rooms a little noisy, even in mid-range and luxury lodgings. In general, Spain is hot, and the country constructed many buildings and structures to survive the heat, which is where thinner walls come into play!\n\nLikely, noise from your neighbors or the street won't keep you up at night, but you can always ask the hotel for a quieter room. Perhaps one with a window facing the inner courtyard or at the end of the hall rather than by the elevator and stairs will be better for catching Zs.\n\nIs Spain suitable for LGBTQI+ travelers?\n\nSpain is one of the best LGBTQI+ travel destinations in the world. It was one of the first countries to legalize same-sex marriage in 2005, gender change became legal in 2006, and Madrid hosts the second-biggest Pride festival in the world after San Francisco. Progressive laws allow same-sex adoption and protect from hate speech, as well as employment and housing discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nAside from in some extremely rural areas, where attitudes can lag behind, Spain is open and welcoming to LGBTQI+ travelers. Madrid is known as Spain's gay capital and is one of the most tolerant cities in Europe; Pride here regularly attracts over two million people. Many of the best bars lie in Madrid's famous Chueca neighborhood. You'll find thriving LGBTQI+ scenes in most big cities; hotspots include Sitges, Valencia, Torremolinos in Málaga, and Barcelona's trendy Eixample area.\n\nAre solo female travelers safe in Spain?\n\nSpain's infamous macho culture has changed dramatically in recent decades, and the country is regularly ranked one of the world's safest destinations for solo women travelers. There's a general vibe of tolerance and respect, so you're unlikely to receive unwanted attention and can dress however you like, except for in religious spaces where you should cover your shoulders and knees.\n\nIt's extremely rare for travelers to encounter violent crime in Spain, but women can be seen as easy targets for theft, so be particularly careful to conceal your valuables and carry only small amounts of cash. Don't leave your phone or wallet on the table in bars or restaurants, and watch out for street sellers when you're dining al fresco; some will try to distract you so they can swipe your bag.\n\nTake other basic safety precautions while traveling in Spain, as you would anywhere in the world. Don't accept unopened drinks from strangers or walk home alone at night. Use official taxis with their licenses on display in the cab; Uber and Lyft are also popular rideshare options in Spain.\n\nIs Spain accessible for travelers with disabilities?\n\nSpain's cobbled-street cities, beaches, and ancient monuments can be tricky for travelers with disabilities to navigate. However, the country is making strides, with all new buildings required by law to be fully accessible. In the tourism industry, most major hotels have been adapted to cater to guests with a range of additional needs.\n\nYou can find great accessibility examples in big cities like Madrid and Barcelona, where much of the metro system and all of the bus networks are accessible. Most train stations have been adapted with ramps, lifts, and other aids. You can request more help with journeys from the country's main rail provider, Renfe.\n\nWhen it comes to attractions such as museums and historical sites, check the Spain is Accessible website for details. Many museums, like the Prado and Reina Sofia in Madrid, are fully accessible; Madrid's tourist office even offers tours adapted for those with various needs and handy accessible city maps that you can download.\n\nAre there any etiquette rules for Spain?\n\nBe aware that Spain is a diverse country and its culture varies by region. For example, the Basque, Galician, and Catalan people all have specific traditions, languages, and politics that you should respect when visiting. However, universal cultural norms in Spain include observing long lunches and eating dinner late; locals regularly venture out around 9-10 pm, often with kids in tow.\n\nAs well as adjusting to meal times, prepare for shops, restaurants, and attractions to close up for a couple of hours in the middle of the day; many also shut on Sundays and Mondays. Spain enjoys a host of holidays that can also interfere with schedules but on the flip side, often involve vibrant street celebrations. August is Spain's national holiday month when cities empty and beach and mountain resorts fill to the brim.\n\nSpain is a relaxed country where you can dress as you please, but if you're visiting religious buildings—the country is predominantly Catholic and stuffed with churches and cathedrals—show respect by covering up your shoulders and knees."
