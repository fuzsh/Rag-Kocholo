Information current for 2024.\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these important tips for buying European train tickets. They answer all the usual questions, \"Do I need to book in advance or can I buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or a 35 point-to-point ticket?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nPrague to Český Krumlov\n\nČeský Krumlov is the 2nd most-visited place in the Czech Republic after Prague, a lovely picturesque town. It's easy to get there from Prague by train, you can do it as a day trip. For times, fares, photos & tips, see the Český Krumlov page.\n\nCheck train times from Prague to Cesky Krumlov at int.bahn.de or jizdnirady.idnes.cz.\n\nThere are regular departures with a change at Ceske Budejovice onto a branch line train, or there is one direct air-conditioned express every day leaving Prague Hlavni at 09:21, arriving Cesky Krumlov 11:50.\n\nThe fare is 386 CZK (16) in 2nd class or 484 CZK (20) with 1st class travel on the mainline train.\n\nThis is a OneTicket fare, which covers both the CD mainline train and the GWTR branch line train.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nThe branch line trains between Ceske Budejovice & Cesky Krumlov are run by private operator GWTR, but you can buy a through ticket between Prague & Český Krumlov at the Czech Railways website www.cd.cz or at the CD ticket office at Prague Hlavni.\n\nFor more information see the Český Krumlov page.\n\nPrague to Brno, Ostrava, Karlovy Vary & elsewhere in the Czech Republic\n\nYou can buy tickets at the Czech Railways (CD) website www.cd.cz, see my tips & advice for using it.\n\nBooking opens 60 days ahead. You print your own ticket.\n\nWithin the Czech Republic, reservation is unnecessary, you can usually just turn up, buy a full-flex ticket and hop on the next train. Tickets are valid on any train that day, or for journeys over 100km, on any train that day and the following day. Indeed, you can even just hop on a train and pay on board if you find the conductor immediately and don't mind paying an extra CZK 40 (about 1.50).\n\nThe exception is the premier SuperCity (SC) pendolino trains which require a seat reservation in addition to a ticket.\n\nPrague to Brno\n\nPrague to Brno takes about 2h40, full-flex fare about 429 CZK (18) or book an advance-purchase fare from 289 CZK (12). Private operator www.regiojet.com also operates trains on this route, see what Regiojet trains are like here.\n\nPrague to Ostrava\n\nPrague to Ostrava takes about 3h01 using CD's excellent tilting pendolino SuperCity (SC) trains, or 3h25 by slightly slower InterCity or EuroCity trains. The full-flex SuperCity fare is about 530 CZK (22) bought on the day, but advance-purchase fares start at 289 CZK (12).\n\nIn addition to the regular Czech Railways (CD) trains, two good private operators now link Prague and Ostrava, RegioJet (www.regiojet.com) and Leo Express (www.leoexpress.com). Unlike CD's tickets, tickets for both Regiojet & Leo Express automatically include a reservation but are only valid on the specific train you book. What are Regiojet trains like? What are Leo Express trains like?\n\nPrague to Plzen takes about 1h35, full-flex fare about 219 CZK (9), or slightly cheaper if you book ahead.\n\nPrague to Karlovy Vary takes about 3h13 by train, the fare is about 484 CZK (20) or slightly cheaper if you book ahead.\n\nSuggested day trips from Prague\n\nYou can check times for all these trips at www.cd.cz and either buy online or simply buy at the station on the day.\n\nCesky Krumlov: See the Cesky Krumlov page.

See www.zamek-konopiste.cz.\n\nKutna Hora old town: Regular express trains run from Prague Hlavni towards Brno, get off at Kutna Hora Hlavni (main) station outside town and change onto a little 4-wheel railbus train which goes into a siding, reverses, then heads off to Kutna Hora Mesto (town) station for the cathedral and silver mines. See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutná_Hora.\n\nKřivoklat castle: Take a fast train from Prague Hlavni to Beroun, then a little railbus train up the lovely Berounka valley line towards Rakovnik.

Either book the other sleeper train to Zurich or book the Nightjet sleeper from Vienna or Linz to Zurich using www.oebb.at, then buy a ticket from Prague to Linz or Vienna using www.cd.cz. I'd allow at least 1 hour between trains in Linz or Vienna.

Here's how to make sense of what you see:\n\nOption 1, via Dresden with 1 change: This would be my first choice, a lovely journey. You'll see this option every two hours with 1 transfer marked EC, ICE. If you click the Show details link you'll see the change is at Dresden with just over an hour between trains.\n\nI'd choose this option even though it's not the fastest, as it's the simplest with only 1 change of train. It uses a comfortable EuroCity train from Prague to Dresden and a high-quality ICE train from Dresden to Frankfurt, with restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, it takes you over the scenic line along the Elbe river valley between Prague and Dresden, see the photos & video. The bonus? An hour or so in Dresden is enough time for a look-round, the Frauenkirche is 22 minutes walk from the station. Or just have a coffee. What's not to like?\n\nTip: If you'd like a longer stop in Dresden, either a few hours or an overnight stop, click Stopovers, enter Dresden and a suitable length of stay in hours. Dresden is well worth a stop, even for a few hours left luggage lockers are available.\n\nOption 2, via Regensburg with 1 change. This uses an express train then an ICE train. Journey time is similar to option 1, but option 1 would still be my first choice because of the scenery and the better quality train with restaurant car on the initial leg.\n\nOption 3, via Cheb with 3 changes, marked IC, RE, RE, ICE: This is usually the fastest option, using a swish air-conditioned Czech Interjet train to Cheb, then a smart German regional express from Cheb to Marktredwitz to Nuremberg and a superb German ICE train to Frankfurt. You'll see it roughly every couple of hours, The trains are comfortable, scenery pretty enough, you can see what the trains and scenery are like on this route on the Prague via Cheb page. But with an extra change in Marktredwitz needed in 2024, it's just too many changes.\n\nYou can also buy tickets at the Czech Railways website www.cd.cz, but int.bahn.de seems better at offering the route via Dresden.

For the route via Schwandorf Czech Railways only offer full-flex fares (shown as International ticket) for 72 (1796 CZK).
