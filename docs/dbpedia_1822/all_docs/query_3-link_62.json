        "text": "Attire\n\nWhat do I wear?\n\nWhen you’re on a Carnival cruise, should you dress up or dress down? The answer is: YES. While you can always wear what you want — most onboard spots are ‘come as you are’ — there will be certain opportunities for dressing up during your cruise. Some dining and nightlife spots always have light dress regulations (“Cruise Casual”), while on certain nights these spots ask that you go all-out (“Cruise Elegant”). So pack a little of everything when you’re getting ready to set sail.\n\nWhat to wear, and when to wear it? Read on for details.\n\nDoes The Chef’s Table have specific attire requirements?\n\nWe know you want to look your best from head to toe, but when it comes to dining at The Chef’s Table, not all shoes are created equal! Please only wear closed-toe flat shoes that aren’t prone to slipping, since the experience involves a tour through the galley — a fully-functional, professional kitchen environment.\n\nWhat’s Cruise Casual?\n\nFor the ladies — Casual dresses, casual skirts or pants and blouses, summer dresses, Capri pants, dress shorts, jeans (no cut-offs).\n\nFor the gentlemen — Sport slacks, khakis, tailored dress shorts, jeans (no cut-offs), collared sport shirts.\n\nWhat’s Cruise Elegant?\n\nFor the ladies — Cocktail or party dresses, pantsuits, elegant skirts and blouses. If you’d like to show off your evening gowns, that’s great too!\n\nFor the gentlemen — Dress slacks, dress shirts. We also suggest a sport coat. If you wish to wear suits and ties or tuxedos, by all means we invite you to do so.\n\nThe number of Cruise Elegant evenings varies by sailing length — see below for details. Check the Fun Times when you cruise for your sailing’s schedule."
