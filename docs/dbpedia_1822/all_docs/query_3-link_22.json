        "text": "In early 2020, I was very excited: We were going to make travel TV in Iceland!\n\nFor the first time, Rick Steves’ Europe was set to film two brand-new episodes on the land of ice and fire. Rick and I had worked hard on the script, brainstorming wonderful little Icelandic experiences — both grand and intimate, from cinematic glaciers to cute puffins, and from steaming volcanoes to funky back-streets Reykjavík. Producer Simon Griffith was hard at work making arrangements and getting filming permissions from the national tourist board. And camera operator Karel Bauer was all lined up to join us for the two-and-a-half-week Icelandic road trip. It was sure to be an epic adventure…and a fantastic show.\n\nAnd then, of course, it didn’t happen.\n\nAll through COVID, when Rick and I would check in, we’d promise each other that we’d head to Iceland as soon as we could. But it took some time: There was a pandemic to weather; a travel company to keep alive; and then, when things finally opened up, two years of backlog to catch up on.\n\nBut finally, in early 2023, the time came to resurrect our Iceland plans. Rick and I dusted off the script, Simon began to reach out to our Icelandic contacts, and Karel started practicing his drone skills. At long last, we were heading to Iceland.\n\nPre-Production: “It’ll All Work Out”\n\nBut first, we had to make arrangements. And if I’m being honest, Iceland didn’t make things easy. It may be a tiny island — with fewer than 400,000 residents, about the population of Honolulu or Cleveland — but it’s extraordinarily popular. We’re a scrappy little public television crew of four people, making the most of a modest budget. But Iceland is accustomed to multi-million-dollar Hollywood productions, with casts and crews in the hundreds: Game of Thrones, various Star Wars installments, and anytime producers need someplace desolate to stand in for a faraway planet (Prometheus, Interstellar, and so on). It quickly became clear that even if Iceland is a fairly small pond, we were minnows… not whales.\n\nFor our July shoot, we figured making plans in January would give us plenty of lead time — which it would be, for any other location. But Iceland’s tourist season is as short as it is intense, and we were landing right at its busiest point. Even several months out, we struck out finding three or four available hotel rooms in some of the remote corners of the Island. Scrambling a bit, we eventually managed to secure accommodations…just barely, in some cases booking the last few beds we could find online.\n\nIceland’s tourist board connected us with a wonderful local fixer, Sunna, who began reaching out to the many locations where we hoped to film. But progress was slow…too slow. As the shoot approached, we voiced our concerns to Sunna and other Icelandic contacts: Would it all fall into place in time?\n\nWith a striking consistency, they all told us the same thing: Don’t worry! It’ll be fine in the end. Sunna explained that this is something of a national motto: Þetta reddast…literally, “It’ll all work out.” I had heard this phrase from time to time during previous visits to Iceland. But now we were living it.\n\nAnd it makes sense: Iceland has always been a true frontier. The elements are harsh; the winters are long and unforgiving; the landscape itself is constantly trying to kill you, with volcanoes or hissing steam vents or glacier avalanches or sneaker waves.\n\nAnd yet, the Icelanders — those quintessential pioneers, descended from Viking Age settlers who took it upon themselves to tame an uninhabited, seemingly un-inhabitable land — have learned to persevere. Icelanders have no choice but to be flexible, to take things as they come, and to help each other out as needed. One way or another, things work out.\n\nSimon and I — after many stressful weeks of false starts and hurry-up/wait — tried to take this assurance to heart. And in the end, Iceland rewarded our leap of faith. Things did work out, wonderfully. We appreciated this motto, and philosophy, so much that we made sure to film one of our Icelandic friends explaining it to Rick: Þetta reddast.\n\nReykjavík: I’m Soakin’ Local!\n\nIn the waning days of June, we convened in Reykjavík to begin filming our Iceland special: producer Simon, camera operator Karel, and (soon after) Rick. We used our first couple of days, before Rick’s arrival, to run around the city — and into the countryside — to film some b-roll: footage to illustrate what we described in our script.\n\nOn our night of arrival, howling rain flung frigid rain sideways, instantly soaking head-to-toe anyone foolish enough to set foot outside. It was instantly, painfully clear: Even being here in the “peak of summer,” working around the weather would be our biggest challenge.\n\nI got so drenched on my first day in town, I headed to an outdoor outfitter for some extra rain gear. The sales clerk patiently explained (as he clearly had to hundreds of tourists before me) that that “waterproof” is a spectrum, not a binary. A proper pair of truly weatherproof rain pants would cost me upwards of $250. (Instead, I bought an $80 pair, figuring it was better than nothing.)\n\nWe scrambled around Reykjavík, chasing sun breaks in a desperate attempt to make this wet city look as pretty as possible. We lucked into a rare bit of blue sky to show off the landmark Hallgrímskirkja and Iceland’s parliament square — only to have dark clouds close in just as we were wrapping up shooting.\n\nAt one point, when sunbeams gave way to a deluge in a matter of 30 seconds, Simon muttered, “Forget about four seasons in one day…this is four seasons in one block!” This resulted in one of my favorite sequences in the show, as Rick says, “This is Iceland in July” (showing people sunbathing in lawn chairs). “…And so is this” (showing wet people miserably bundled up in Gore-Tex parkas).\n\nOnce Rick arrived, we continued our do-si-do around the weather. We scouted scenic locations where Rick could film his “on-cameras” (talking directly to the viewer).\n\nWe also planned to film a segment with a local guide, who could help Rick (and our viewers) better understand the distinctive lifestyle. Our goal was not simply to wallow in well-trod Icelandic cliches, but to offer real insight into what makes Icelandic culture unique.\n\nSaga, who runs a tour company called Viking Women, joined us on a Saturday morning to guide Rick through the downtown flea market. When she showed him some Icelandic sweaters, his enthusiasm seemed hammed-up for the cameras. But it turns out, it was totally genuine; he even bought a sweater to take home (which left Simon’s jaw on the floor, as Rick almost never buys souvenirs). Rick explained that he has fond childhood memories of visiting relatives in Norway, which left him with a lifelong affinity for Nordic woolens — especially ones with pewter buttons.\n\nThen we headed to the fish counter, where Saga encouraged Rick to sample some local specialties: dried-cod jerky (harðfiskur) and, of course, Iceland’s notorious fermented shark (hákarl) — which tastes like rotten fish with a pungent, lingering ammonia aftertaste. From behind the camera, Simon, Karel, and I were astounded, knowing that Rick had just the night before suffered through a nasty stomach bug…and now was going back for second and third takes on a bite that’s hard to choke down even when you’re feeling tip-top. He’s a true pro.\n\nThen Saga and Rick strolled together through the back streets of Reykjavík. Hitting each point on our “wish list” for this interaction, Saga taught Rick a little Icelandic; showed off some street art, a Reykjavík specialty; explained the brightly painted, corrugated “iron” cladding that Icelanders wrap their homes in; and pointed out the many propped-open windows, which Icelanders use to keep the air moving when things get stuffy (thanks to the abundant natural geothermal energy they use for heating). It wound up being one of the best — and longest — segments in the show.\n\nOne item that didn’t work out quite as planned was the Blue Lagoon. That famous lava-rock spa is a touristic icon of Iceland. But we were torn: While the Blue Lagoon is an unforgettable experience, it’s also extremely expensive and almost entirely frequented by tourists. In our Iceland guidebook, we explain that most Icelanders skip these fancy “premium” spas and instead go for a dip at their community swimming pool — fed by natural thermal springs, just as hot as the Blue Lagoon, more fun and interactive, and about one-tenth the price.\n\nOriginally, we thought we’d film Rick in both settings, to illustrate the range of options. But the Blue Lagoon turned out to be the most restrictive location on our list. When they finally responded to our many requests for permission, they were (understandably) concerned about the privacy of their many paying customers. Therefore, Rick could be swimming in one distant corner of the Blue Lagoon, cordoned off and with zero interaction with other bathers.\n\nMeanwhile, we’d also made plans to film Rick at a very local-feeling pool in suburban Reykjavík, called Árbæjarlaug — my favorite of the half-dozen or so pools I’ve tried in the area. (TV scouting is hard work…but someone has to do it.)\n\nUpon arrival, it was clear that we were the only out-of-towners at the pool — not just that afternoon, but very likely the entire week. It was ideal for showcasing this unique facet of Icelandic life: Rather than heading to the neighborhood pub after work to gather with friends and family, Icelanders convene at a thermal pool. Rick and I got in, splashed around, and made some new friends, while Simon and Karel dutifully filmed. (As if on cue, just as Rick and I slid into the hundred-degree water, the skies opened up in a frigid, pouring rain. Imagine the contrast: Rick and I, swimming around with the Icelanders…piping-hot and soggy; Simon and Karel, huddling under a giant umbrella, desperately trying to keep the camera dry…freezing cold and soggy. We definitely owed them one.)\n\nTo cap this experience, Rick came up with a line to say into the camera — submerged up to his shoulders, positioned next to a waterslide with giggling kids. He explained the difference between premium spas (like the Blue Lagoon) and the neighborhood-pool option, finishing with the line, “And today, I’m soakin’ local!” (“I’m soakin’ local!” instantly joined Þetta reddast as our official motto for the shoot.)\n\nWith all of this wonderful interaction in the can, we realized we didn’t really need to show Rick luxuriating in the Blue Lagoon after all. We’re not shills for private attractions; rather, we’re advocates for travelers, equipping them with a sense of their options so they can make the best decision for their time and budget. So, one evening, we zipped out to the Blue Lagoon to shoot it from a distance, just to acknowledge it, but kept most of our coverage focused on the local pools. In the end, things worked out for the best. As they say… Þetta reddast.\n\nInto the Countryside: Golden Circle, South Coast, and the Westman Islands\n\nWork done in Reykjavík, it was time to head for Iceland’s big draw: its stunning countryside. Up until this point, we’d been dodging bad weather; if you watch Rick’s back-streets Reykjavík tour with Saga, you’ll notice they’re both drenched to the bone. While not ideal, this was acceptable for in-city sightseeing. But we were counting on bright, sunny skies to properly showcase Icelandic natural beauty at its finest. And on that count, we got very lucky: Right around the time we left the capital, the weather shifted, bathing us in sunshine for nearly the entirety of the shoot.\n\nWe drove the full Golden Circle (Reykjavík’s most popular side-trip) twice, on two separate days, to cover it well: the national park at Thingvellir (with a gorge that illustrates the tectonic fissure between Europe and North America); the simmering geothermal field at Geysir; and the thundering waterfall, Gullfoss.\n\nGullfoss was also the location of a particularly memorable mishap. We knew that Karel’s drone would be a must — to capture that epic scenery from a bird’s-eye view. We’d dutifully jumped through the administrative hoops (with Sunna’s help) to make sure we were legal. Before the trip, I read several warnings about the difficulty of using a drone in Iceland, due to the near-constant high winds. But we’d figure it out… right?\n\nWe wrapped up a very long day filming the Golden Circle at the epic Gullfoss waterfall, which tumbles into a narrow, dizzyingly steep gorge. This seemed the perfect occasion to get some aerial views using our drone. Karel set it up and took off, zipping high up to capture unbelievably dramatic footage looking down over the falls and canyon.\n\nBut then, within moments, the controller began to fire off multiple, simultaneous warnings: First, a “High Wind Warning” popped up on the screen. And then the “low battery” signal began to beep insistently. “Hm, that can’t be right,” Karel said, as Simon and I looked on nervously. “The battery was at 100% when I sent it up.”\n\nTo keep the camera steady, the drone makes constant, minute adjustments for the wind. And in Iceland, the wind blows so hard, and so erratically, that the drone’s battery was being drained at a dizzying rate simply to stay stable and airborne.\n\n“Can you get ‘er back?” Simon asked, calmly as he could.\n\n“Maybe,” Karel said. “She’s fighting me.”\n\nWe watched helplessly, holding our breath, as the distant, blinking light in the sky struggled to return to us — now heading directly into the battering wind. As the “low battery” alarm reached a critical point, Karel said, “It won’t make it back here, but I think I can drop it on the far side of the gorge.”\n\nYes, the gorge. We were on one side of the gorge below Gullfoss. And our drone was quickly descending on the far side.\n\n“It’s down,” Karel said, finally. “But I think it’s OK.” We squinted through the waterfall mist and spotted a couple of twinkling lights, in the distant scrub. It was the drone. Not here with us, unfortunately. Not being rushed away by the waters of the Hvítá river far below us, fortunately. But on the opposite side of the gorge…quite inconveniently, just a few hundred yards right in front of us, but possibly unreachable.\n\n“Can we get over there?” Simon asked. I was already on it, panning-and-zooming on Google Maps on my phone. It did appear that we could drive along one bank of the gorge; cross over to the other side; drive back on unpaved roads along the far side; and maybe… possibly… conceivably get to a place where we could park and hike to where we thought the drone had landed. I dropped a pin at its presumed location, we headed back to the car, and we set out.\n\nThe drive itself took close to 30 minutes — much of which was along unpaved, jagged gravel roads that pressed our two-wheel-drive car to its limits. We parked where the road ended and headed out on foot toward that dropped pin at the edge of the gorge, with the waterfall’s mist rising from the horizon.\n\nAnd as we walked, something beautiful happened: We realized we were traipsing through a stunning corner of unspoiled Icelandic nature. We were following a very old, virtually unmarked footpath — one that, clearly, exceedingly few hikers used. It curved between gloriously colorful fields of purple lupine flowers, over rocky but passable terrain, under a big sky.\n\nWe’d had a very long day’s work, so we were tired — but that also came with a sense of deep satisfaction. Whether or not we retrieved the drone, it had been an amazing day. And this unplanned hike through a stunning landscape was a bonus, which may or may not terminate at a treasure. It felt like a true adventure.\n\nAs we approached the edge of the gorge, Karel’s pace quickened. He began to almost run. And then, sure enough, hidden among rocks, there it was: the drone, intact, in one piece, battery depleted but fully functioning.\n\nBetter yet, we were standing directly across the gorge from where we’d started, a good 45 minutes earlier — enjoying a completely different view of Gullfoss and its canyon that 99.9% of tourists will never see.\n\nThat experience taught us a few things about filming in Iceland. First, you must respect nature, here as nowhere else. We attempted to use the drone a few more times, and each time, the “low battery” light would kick on much faster than we expected. (And on future flights, Karel was much quicker to bring ‘er on home.)\n\nBut it also reinforced the idea that things work out as they should. We hadn’t planned for that extra drive and hike at the end of an already very long day. We returned to our hotel much later than we’d have liked. But in the end, we came away with a glorious memory. Once again… Þetta reddast.\n\nThe errant drone was the biggest of just a few bumps we’d encounter on what turned out to be, by and large, a smooth shoot. The weather began to cooperate, and Rick and I had the wonderful experience of turning all of those big ideas about how to share Iceland with our viewers into reality.\n\nOne thing Rick was especially excited for was Thórsmörk (literally, “Thor’s Woods”) — a stark glacial valley accessible only by Super Jeep. We loaded into a monster truck, and our driver expertly forded several glacial rivers as we bounced around in our seats. It is, I believe, the first and only “off-road” experience ever filmed for Rick Steves’ Europe.\n\nWe visited the stunning Seljalandsfoss, Iceland’s most glorious bridal-veil waterfall, on a particularly fine day — with bright blue skies and sunbeams casting rainbows on the mist. And we filmed at the famous black-sand beach of Reynisfjara, just before howling winds kicked up a sandstorm.\n\nOn our final day with Rick, we enjoyed an epic all-day trip to the Westman Islands — a volcanic archipelago just off the South Coast. While Iceland is well discovered, these islands are the closest thing to a “Back Door” — frequented by a manageable number of in-the-know travelers, and within day-tripping distance of the capital (by plane) or South Coast (by boat).\n\nIn one very busy day, we wanted to tell the Westman Islands’ volcanic story — a dramatic 1973 eruption just above the main town — and show off its abundant bird life, especially puffins. Our guide and sidekick was Ebbi, who along with his wife, Íris, runs a local tour company, Eyjatours. With Ebbi’s and Íris’ help, we were able to pack everything in.\n\nWe wanted to show how islanders climb and swing on long, dangling ropes to reach bird nests perched in the crags of sheer cliffs. Ebbi normally demonstrates this for his tours, but we asked if he knew any local kids who might enjoy showing off their skills. Íris contacted a teenager named Aðalbjörg, who met us at the cliffs. Ebbi explained how islanders traditionally used these ropes to harvest sea bird eggs — a rare source of nutrition on this very sparse island — while, in the background, we watched Aðalbjörg swinging back and forth like Tarzan. It’s worth stressing that she was not “performing” for our cameras; young islanders are raised to swing on these ropes…even if, these days, it’s more for cultural heritage than for the eggs. In fact, while we were filming, a few young boys rode up on their bikes and — entirely unprompted by us — began swinging around on a smaller nearby cliff, just for fun.\n\nThen we drove out to the far edge of the island, to a green hillside where puffins roost. We sat on the grassy, hummocky hillside — looking out over the Atlantic — as Ebbi lovingly explained how migratory puffins spend their summers in vast numbers on these islands. We watched as adorable puffins careened through the air above us, then came in for an awkward landing.\n\n“These hills are full of burrows, where puffins build their nests,” Ebbi explained. And just then, I heard a strange, almost otherworldly growling noise coming from below my butt.\n\n“Ah,” Ebbi said. “I think you’re sitting on a burrow. There’s a puffin in there. I imagine he’s not happy.” Sheepishly, I scooted over a few feet, having had the new-to-me experience of irritating a puffin.\n\nReturning to our mainland rental cottage late at night, we were thrilled at having captured the Westman Island and South Coast on film. And now, it was time to head out on the rest of the Ring Road.\n\nThe Ring Road: Europe’s Most Epic Road Trip\n\nBack when we were planning this journey, we knew that — given the long distances, and our ambition to cover Iceland completely and thoughtfully — it would be a longer-than-usual shoot. For most 30-minute TV shows, Rick and the crew spend six days filming. For Iceland, we’d film two such episodes, which would also be combined into a one-hour special. But rather than the standard 12 days, we’d need closer to three weeks.\n\nRick is a very busy man. And much as he’d have enjoyed doing the entire trip, that was more Iceland than he had time for. Early on, we came up with a plan: He’d join us in Reykjavík and its key day trips, including the South Coast and Westman Islands. And then, for the rest of the Ring Road — driving all the way around Iceland — Simon, Karel, and I would set off on our own.\n\nThe question was: How could we explain this to viewers? Wouldn’t they notice that Rick simply disappears three-quarters of the way through the show? Or should we try to “fake it” — film some on-cameras in places that resembled the far corners of Iceland? (This practice is standard for some “travel” TV shows. I’ve been told that at least one host films all of their on-cameras in their own backyard, while the crew does the rest of the filming on location…hostless. But that’s not Rick’s style.)\n\nSimon came up with a solution: We’d be up-front with our viewers, explaining that Rick was heading out — and instead, they’d be following along with me as I did my guidebook-researching rounds. (You’ll notice that, in every shot I appear in, I’m clutching my little black notebook and scrawling notes — a subconscious reminder of why I’m there.)\n\nI was, naturally, extremely nervous about taking on this assignment — including having the camera pointed at me. But Þetta reddast, as always: It worked out beautifully, thanks to Rick’s generous and insightful coaching, and working with the best imaginable crew in Simon and Karel.\n\nThe three of us waved goodbye to Rick and hit the road, circling the entire island counterclockwise on the Ring Road. With Rick, we’d already covered over 100 miles of the Ring, from Reykjavík to Vík. That left nearly 700 miles to go — which we covered in six days. We had many four- or five-hour driving days in a row, interspersed with frantically busy bursts of filming natural wonders and fascinating folk museums, with mostly one-night stays en route.\n\nThis being early July, daylight was endless — making it easier to work and drive late into the evening, but all too easy to not even realize how tired we were getting until we were flat exhausted. Often we’d pull into a hotel at 9 or 10 at night — still broad daylight — only to be told that every restaurant within an hour’s drive was already closed. On multiple occasions, dinner consisted of a trio of hot dogs at the nearest gas station.\n\nThat said, it was a fantastic road trip — fitting for the wondrous Ring Road. Each stop, each day, and each turn in the road was more stunning than the last.\n\nIn the Southeast, we hopped on an inflatable boat for a cruise between icebergs in a glacier lagoon. It was the one stop on the entire Ring where we had rotten weather…and it was still gorgeous. (The family who joined us on the boat were doing the same itinerary as us, but in the opposite direction…and told us they’d had rain and cold every single day.)\n\nDriving up the east coast — along the Eastfjords — we had to be choosy about where we pulled over to shoot the dramatic landscape. Coming around each bend, Karel’s eyes would pop out of his head. “Wow, Simon. That’s a great shot.” Simon, steady behind the wheel and knowing we had a tight schedule to stick to, would give it a quick assessment. If he agreed, we’d pull over and set up the camera. But more often than not, he’d keep on driving… knowing that an even better view was likely to unfold soon. Through a little trial-and-error — and having a clear sense of exactly what we were hoping to capture on film — we developed a good instinct for which views were worth braking for, which merited a U-turn, and which were skippable.\n\nReaching the northeast corner of Iceland — as far as you can get from Reykjavík without a boat — we rounded the bend and looped back west along the North Coast, stopping at Mývatn — a giant lake surrounded by mind-bending geological formations…Iceland’s answer to Yellowstone.\n\nWe took a short detour up to Húsavík, famous for its whale-watching industry. We were greeted by a dynamo named Orly, who serves as a one-man chamber of commerce for his tiny town. Orly explained how the traditional fishing fleet of Húsavík has been transformed into whale-watching boats, as we filmed people gearing up and chugging out to look for orcas and breaching humpbacks.\n\nHúsavík is also familiar to some travelers as the setting of the Will Ferrell/Rachel McAdams Netflix movie about the Eurovision Song Contest — which was nominated for the Oscar for Best Song. In fact, Orly himself produced the live performance of that song, right here in Húsavík, that was broadcast globally during the Oscars ceremony. He took us to a fine viewpoint over the harbor, which also happened to be the location of a surprisingly good museum about the movie and the contest, and the Jaja Ding Dong Café, inspired by the film. The owner and proprietor of all this? Orly, of course.\n\nWhile most of this (aside from the whale watching) was beyond the scope of our show, it illustrates the many fascinating and wonderful Icelanders we met as we toured their island. Even so far from “civilization,” this is a welcoming, endlessly entertaining place. (And I was able to graft some of what got left on the cutting-room floor into the new edition of our Rick Steves Iceland guidebook. That’s only fair, considering that the bulk of our Iceland coverage was shaped by working on that book, over many years.)\n\nOne segment that did make the cut was our visit to the Herring Era Museum, in the fjordside village of Siglufjörður. On a previous visit, I was captivated by the story of how, from 1903 to the 1960s, salted herring powered the Icelandic economy… representing fully one-half of Iceland’s total export income, and arguably leading to financial independence and full sovereignty. Our wonderful local guide Edda met us out front to show us the cutting and salting stations, then brought us inside to tour the dorms where the “herring girls” spent their time, waiting for the fishing boats to arrive so they could do their work. When filming travel TV, it’s so important to include local voices. And hearing Edda bring this obscure-to-us history to life, proudly describing the Rosie the Riveter-style herring girls, made it a segment to remember.\n\nOn our way back to Reykjavík, completing the Ring Road loop, we made a few more stops — including the turf houses at Glaumbær, and the glorious scenery of Snæfellsnes Peninsula.\n\nOur shoot was nearly finished. But Iceland wasn’t quite finished with us. Way back when we began in Reykjavík, we were already hearing news reports of small, mostly undetectable earthquakes shaking the western half of the island. It seemed that the slumbering volcanoes beneath the Reykjanes Peninsula — south of the capital, near the Blue Lagoon and international airport — were about to awaken.\n\nAs we drove around the Ring Road, we kept an eye on the news for the imminent eruption. And a few days before our trip wrapped up, sure enough, the earth opened up and began to spew molten rock. By that time, we were hundreds of miles away; even as our loved ones back home reached out to make sure we were OK (frightened by the “Iceland in Flames!” headlines), we knew that the eruption was distant, isolated, and effectively harmless.\n\nAs we entered the home stretch back to Reykjavík, finishing up our 800-mile journey, we kept our eyes peeled on the horizon. And sure enough, as the skyline of the capital came into view, beyond it we noticed a strange-shaped “cloud” that wasn’t a cloud at all…but a smoke plume from that volcano.\n\nOn our final night in Reykjavík, we watched the distant eruption from our hotel window, about 20 miles away — and marveled at how, even being so close, we felt totally safe. And the next day, our drive to the airport took us within a few miles of the smoldering eruption. Pulling over to get some footage, we realized it wasn’t that exciting, after all…just some distant smoke. It was a good reminder of how, even when an event grabs international headlines, the reality on the ground can be far less dramatic. And it left us with one last example of that motto: Þetta reddast…it always works out.\n\nAfter our return, our ace editor Steve Cammarano stitched together that two-and-a-half weeks of footage into a tight and compelling one-hour tour of Iceland. The rough cut broke a record… tipping the scales at more than six minutes too long. But with a few judicious trims, and Steve’s editorial mastery, we wound up with a show that’s exactly the right length.\n\nAnd that show is about to premiere nationwide on public television, starting on August 11 — check your local listings for air times in your area. In the end, we are thrilled to have captured a well-rounded look at this remarkable hunk of Europe, adrift in the North Atlantic — from volcanoes and glaciers, to puffins and whales, to fjords and mountains, to a fascinating and endearing Nordic heritage shaped by a hardscrabble history. This is Iceland. And I truly hope that you enjoy Rick Steves Iceland as much as we enjoyed making it.\n\nBe sure to watch Rick Steves Iceland, airing in August on public television stations nationwide (and streaming on PBS Passport).\n\nPlanning a trip of your own? Pick up the recently updated new edition of our bestselling Rick Steves’ Iceland guidebook.\n\nI’ve written tons of other blog posts, all about my travels around Iceland.\n\nAnd if you enjoy these behind-the-scenes stories, pick up a copy of my memoir, The Temporary European — with a chapter about making our Romania TV show with Rick, Simon, and Karel.\n\nAs we head into the Fourth of July — during a contentious election year, no less — I’ve been thinking about what makes a country great. “Greatness” can mean strength and power. Or it can signify wisdom, maturity, respect, and an honest reckoning with the past.\n\nIn my travels, I observe a disparity in how various lands think about their history: Some societies acknowledge the more challenging elements of their past, while others only embrace the most flattering version of themselves.\n\nAs fractured as we are these days, I genuinely believe that good, caring, intelligent people can agree to disagree on a broad range of issues. Should the government take a heavy hand, or a light one, in collecting taxes, regulating guns or abortion, and guiding the trajectory of a society? What role should the USA play on the world stage? How much immigration is “too much,” and how should we treat those immigrants? You have your opinions; I have mine; sometimes they don’t align. That’s life in a healthy democracy. That’s what elections are for.\n\nHowever, one thing that I believe is not a partisan issue — or, at least, shouldn’t be — is the fundamental truth of history. Facts matter. What happened, happened. And whether those events were good or bad, the only way for a society to evolve is to be honest about its past, warts and all. That’s why, when those who seek or hold political power begin to selectively reinterpret the past — dispensing with inconvenient truths — I find it alarming, not as a Democrat or a progressive, but as a patriotic American.\n\nThis is not a distinctly American challenge. Every country’s story is filled with both moments of virtue, and moments that are regrettable, even “evil.” As I travel from place to place, I’m struck by how each society makes intentional choices about how to reckon with their history. And over time, I’ve also seen how this can vary depending on the swing of the political pendulum.\n\nAnd so, to provide some international context for the debates we’re having in 2024 USA, join me on a trip to a few case studies of how other societies have gotten this right…and, in my view, ones that have gotten it wrong.\n\nPoland: The Museum of the Second World War\n\nIn Gdańsk — the northern Polish city where World War II began — museum curators designed what was to be Europe’s definitive museum of the Second World War. It told the complicated story of wartime Poland, yes; but expanded its view to encompass a global perspective on the war, and how it affected various lands and peoples.\n\nHowever, shortly before the museum’s scheduled opening in 2017, the ruling Law and Justice government — which felt the exhibit “wasn’t Polish enough” — intervened. They replaced the director with a political appointee, and installed a new mission to stir the patriotic souls of Polish taxpayers. New exhibits, mainly profiling Polish heroes and victims, were hastily squeezed into any available space. The intentionally ambiguous, thought-provoking final room was re-envisioned and now shows a rabble-rousing film (called “The Unconquered”) espousing a naively, almost offensively pro-Polish point of view.\n\nRevisiting the museum not long ago, I stumbled upon one exhibit that I suspect was added by the politicized director. At the entrance to a room filled with portraits of Jews who were murdered by the Nazis in Polish territory stands a wall labeled “Poles in the face of the Holocaust.” Posted information and touchscreens explained how Poles saved the lives of Jews, despite the fact that Poland was the only Nazi-occupied land where such assistance could be punished by death.\n\nThis is an inspiring story, to be sure. And there were many righteous Poles who came to the assistance of their Jewish neighbors. But there were also many Poles who colluded with the Nazis, and many more who turned a blind eye to their atrocities. Is it expecting too much for these facts to be acknowledged in the museum, as well?\n\nSoon after, in 2018, the Law and Justice party made it illegal to state that the “Polish nation” was in any way responsible for the atrocities of the Holocaust, under punishment of prison. Under diplomatic pressure from the US Department of State, the law was later softened to remove the criminal component. However, a civil court can still prosecute “whoever claims, publicly and contrary to the facts, that the Polish Nation or the Republic of Poland is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes committed by the Third Reach.” And so, an important part of Poland’s World War II story goes untold.\n\n(It’s worth noting that Poland’s Law and Justice party was defeated in late 2023 by a centrist coalition; as new, more moderate leadership reshapes Poland, it will be fascinating to see if those changes ripple down to the displays of this museum.)\n\nA few days earlier — at the opposite end of Poland, in the town of Wadowice — I toured the museum at the birth house of St. John Paul II. The slickly produced, inspiring, touching museum did a beautiful job of telling the life story of Karol Woytyła, who lost his parents at a young age, entered the priesthood, and eventually became the spiritual leader of one billion Catholics and a critical figure in the final ideological battles of the Cold War.\n\nThe museum tells this story so well, in fact, that I didn’t realize until after I’d left that it had omitted some important topics — specifically, the child molestation scandals within the Catholic Church that were covered up under Pope John Paul II’s watch.\n\nChatting with some Polish friends about this, I was reminded that these things aren’t as black-and-white as they may first seem. Yes, the Pope should have done more. However, John Paul II recognized that he was in a unique historical position as a high-profile crusader against Soviet oppression, and that he played a critical inspirational role in the democratization of his homeland, Poland. Perhaps there were pragmatic reasons for him to avoid publicly addressing a scandal that would have undermined so much of what he was trying to accomplish.\n\nI’m not entirely persuaded by this reasoning. But it certainly got me thinking more deeply about the full complexity of that chapter in Polish (and Catholic Church) history. I don’t believe “canceling” John Paul II is the answer. Rather, his legacy deserves a complete and nuanced discussion. And I regret that this museum is so reluctant to have that conversation.\n\nHistory is made by “great” people who, like all people, are flawed. Even the greatest among us have blind spots and vulnerabilities; arguably, it’s a person’s ability to navigate complicated realities and make impossible choices that propels them to greatness.So then, why are we so afraid to be honest about those flaws?\n\nGermany: Documentation Centers and Holocaust Memorials\n\nLet’s cross the border, to a country that dispenses with the kid gloves when handling its own history. In my travels, I have encountered few societies that more conscientiously grapple with their checkered past than Germany. Yes, Germany.\n\nEven to this day, when many people think of Germany, one of their first associations is along these lines: backed a lunatic dictator; tried to take over the world; murdered millions through genocide and conquest; destroyed much of Europe.\n\nResenting Germany for their crimes in World War II and the Holocaust is understandable, even deserved. But in my 25 years of traveling around Germany, I’ve been impressed by their willingness to be open, candid, and contrite about their history. They even have a term for it: Vergangenheitsbewältigung, “coming to terms with the past.”\n\nThroughout Germany, I’ve visited perhaps a dozen different “Nazi documentation centers.” That’s a buzzword for a museum that offers a thoughtful, entirely transparent, and no-holds-barred assessment of Germany’s culpability in its crimes of the 20th century. It’s a fascinating exercise in the defendant presenting an ironclad case on behalf of the prosecution. Germany’s documentation centers confront visitors — both German and foreign — with abundant, meticulously collected evidence, always compelling and often gruesome, of their own crimes. No excuses are offered, and there isn’t a whiff of defensiveness — just a matter-of-fact mea very, very culpa.\n\nIn the German capital of Berlin, immediately adjacent to the landmark Brandenburg Gate and just down the street from the Reichstag stands a sprawling monument consisting of 2,711 stony slabs. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, occupying this privileged position in the very heart of Germany’s leading city, is just one of countless memorials, large and small, all across the country, that constantly remind Germans of their historical crimes.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that a country could ever “do enough” to make up for such heinous acts. But as a frequent visitor here, I’m impressed. Even younger Germans — now generations removed from these atrocities — may grow a little weary of these constant reminders. And yet, they recognize that this is their legacy.\n\nThe Netherlands: Dutch Resistance and Colonialism\n\nNext door is a country that was occupied by Nazi Germany: the Netherlands. And on a recent visit to Amsterdam, I was struck both by how the Dutch are honestly reckoning with their role in history…and how they still have a ways to go.\n\nThe recently re-envisioned Dutch Resistance Museum traces the story of the Netherlands under Nazi occupation. It’s an exercise in stirring the Dutch patriotic soul with tales of both suffering and valiant resistance — much like the World War II museum in Poland. But, to its credit, the Dutch museum also owns up to aspects of that story that some might prefer to dismiss.\n\nEarly on, the exhibit takes pains to introduce us to Anton Mussert, who led the NSB, the local version of the Nazis. And it unflinchingly explains that 25,000 young Dutchmen volunteered to join the Waffen-SS, accepting Hitler’s invitation to stand with him in “Germanic Brotherhood.” After the war, at least 120,000 Dutch collaborators were arrested.\n\nOf course, questionable Dutch deeds extend much farther back than the 20th century. As one of Europe’s great colonial powers, the Netherlands was fabulously wealthy in the 17th and 18th centuries. Amsterdam’s ornate city center — with its concentric canals, stately townhouses, grand museums and palaces, and gilded carillons — was financed primarily through plundered resources, the exploitation of human labor at the far ends of the globe, and Dutch participation in the transatlantic trade of enslaved human beings.\n\nThis is an aspect of Dutch history that many visitors (and, until recently, even many Dutch people) gloss over. But that is now changing. In 2023, the former Tropenmuseum (“Tropics Museum,” built nearly a century ago to show off colonial riches to Dutch citizens) was re-envisioned as the “World Museum.” Many of those same artifacts from former Dutch holdings — as far afield as Indonesia (the “East Indies”) and the Caribbean (the “West Indies”) — are still on display. But now they are given proper context, explaining the lives of the people exploited by the Dutch, from their own perspectives.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s impressive to see the Netherlands making these strides: For example, then-Prime Minister Mark Rutte (in 2022) and King Willem-Alexander (in 2023) have both formally apologized for the Dutch role in the slave trade. On the other hand, like any society, not everyone is comfortable with the changing times. The Dutch sidekick to Santa Claus, Zwarte Piet (“Black Pete”), is still usually performed by a white man in Blackface — and in a recent poll, more than half of Dutch respondents continue to support Zwarte Piet’s traditional appearance. And in November of 2023, an anti-immigrant party took the highest total of seats in the Dutch parliament.\n\nProgress sometimes comes in fits and starts…but it’s progress.\n\nNew Zealand/Aotearoa: Waitangi Treaty Grounds\n\nOn a recent trip to New Zealand/Aotearoa, I visited the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on the Bay of Islands. This is essentially the birthplace of the modern nation of New Zealand, where local Māori tribal leaders signed a treaty with emissaries of the British crown to establish formal colonies on the island. Today you can walk across the grassy field where the treaty was signed, but only after you’ve toured a powerful, beautifully curated museum.\n\nThe museum is the best implementation I’ve seen of a “dual narrative” approach — equally weighting the perspectives of both the Māori and the English to tell a complete story. In fact, for most of the exhibit, you see the Māori point of view on one wall, and the English point of view on the opposing wall. It’s fascinating to experience the history of this island through the eyes of its two dominant groups, simultaneously — a parallax view that is both informative and moving.\n\nIn the darkened hall that displays the actual treaty, exhibits detail how the document was translated misleadingly into the Māori language. Key concepts like “sovereignty” were phrased in such a way to give Māori leaders the impression that they, and not the Queen of England, were still essentially in control of their island.\n\nI was impressed and inspired to see a society that — rather than try to spin past events in a way that would present the European settlers in a flattering light — plainly acknowledged their misdeeds: We misled the people who were here first. And we were wrong.\n\nNew Zealand inspires me. It’s perhaps the planet’s most forward-thinking nation when it comes to the rights of its indigenous population. This national conversation began in earnest in the 1970s — on the one hundredth anniversary of the Treaty of Waitangi — and much progress has been made. While “reparations” is an abstract and hard-to-sell idea when it comes to the descendants of enslaved Black people in the USA, in New Zealand, it’s a reality: Vast tracts of the country’s land has been formally returned to Māori control. While there’s certainly more to do, New Zealand is making real strides in owning up to its historical crimes.\n\nAnd this trickles down to everyday life, as well. Increasingly, Kiwis from both Māori and European backgrounds are embracing the indigenous name for their archipelago: Aotearoa. Kiwis, regardless of their background, greet each other with a cheery “Kia ora!” — evoking the Māori origins of the land upon which they all reside together today. As an American, this inspires me to do better — so much better. (And if we need a role model closer to home, we need only look to our northern neighbor — Canada has made impressive gains in better acknowledging the rights of its First Nations peoples.)\n\nHungary: Slide from Democracy\n\nNow let’s cross hemispheres again, to a place that may be one of the worst-case scenarios for a society retconning its own narrative: Hungary.\n\nSince first taking power in 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his party, Fidesz, have aggressively revised history to suit their nativist political agenda. An exhaustive list of examples could fill volumes. But even just as a traveler who drops into the country every year or two, I’ve seen the effects firsthand: streets and squares renamed for obscure historical footnotes; the vast plaza surrounding the Parliament building completely transformed with new monuments and memorials; and, perhaps most alarmingly, a wholesale revision of the national school curriculum to ensure that the version of history taught to every Hungarian student is perfectly in line with the Fidesz agenda.\n\nAnd what is that version of history? Essentially, it’s the most flattering possible view of Hungary. Fidesz history presents the country either as a heroic warrior, or a tragically maligned victim of foreign aggression, full stop. Orbán’s story of Hungary is designed to instill unquestioned pride and patriotism: We have always been in the right, just as we are today.\n\nHere are just three examples:\n\nOn Liberty Square, Fidesz erected a melodramatic monument to the “victims of fascism.” It’s overloaded with symbolism suggesting that Hungary was a peace-loving land, minding its own business, until Hitler invaded in 1944. In front of the monument, locals have assembled their own makeshift counter-monument — documenting how, in fact, Jews were terribly mistreated by Hungarian authorities, and tens of thousands were deported to certain execution by Hungary’s pre-Nazi leadership.\n\nA couple of blocks away once stood a beloved statue of the communist reformer Imre Nagy, casting his judgmental gaze over the Parliament. However, there was a problem: Nagy may have led the 1956 Uprising against the USSR (and was later sham-tried and executed). But he was also a communist himself, who sought reform from within. The Fidesz worldview simply can’t tolerate such nuance. Nagy was a communist; all communists are bad; therefore, we must remove Nagy’s statue from this favored location. Under cover of darkness and without any warning, one night in the waning days of 2018, it was relocated far from the Parliament.\n\nUp at Buda Castle, Orbán has moved his office into the former National Dance Theater and is busily redeveloping the castle quarter, transforming it into his new seat of government. Old buildings — destroyed in World War II and never rebuilt — are being re-created from scratch, with little rhyme or reason. It’s a hodgepodge that randomly juxtaposes buildings from this and that era, based on how pretty or grand or imposing they look rather than their actual role in history — an almost too on-the-nose embodiment of this cherry-picking approach to Hungarian history.\n\nOrbán has become a darling of certain corners of the American right. Perhaps those Orbán supporters should travel to Budapest, talk to Hungarians on the street, and observe how his approach has eroded two decades of fragile progress in recovering from totalitarianism…including the distorted, oversimplified way that Hungarians are encouraged to view their own complicated history.\n\nBristol: The Empty Plinth\n\nA couple of years ago, on a dreary late-winter morning, I wandered around Bristol, England, piecing together the story of Edward Colston. This fabulously successful Bristolian grew the wealth and reputation of his home city, largely through his participation in the slave trade.\n\nColston is one of many historical figures who became a flashpoint during the global Black Lives Matter protests in the spring and summer of 2020. You may recall how a giant statue of Colston was toppled by protesters, dragged down the hill, and dumped into the harbor. (Later, the statue was dredged out of the harbor and displayed in a local museum.)\n\nOn my visit to Bristol, about two years after this event, I found myself following breadcrumbs of Colston’s legacy around the city. The plinth that once held Colston’s statue — and boldly declared him “one of the most virtuous and wise sons of [the] city” — stood empty. In a parish church, stained-glass windows honoring Colston had been removed; a nearby information panel explained this decision. And in a city history museum, Colston sneered out from a composite painting of prominent Bristolians. His image was identified completely, and accurately: “Slave trader; merchant and philanthropist.”\n\nBack home, we’ve had debates about whether and how we should remove statues honoring problematic historical figures, whether they be Confederate generals or slave-owning Founding Fathers. You may believe that tearing down these statues is just as bad as what Poland or Hungary is doing. But observing Bristol’s approach demonstrates that it’s possible, even responsible, to remember these figures — completely and honestly, in all of the ways they both aided and harmed others — without honoring them. The challenge — one that Bristol rose to — is to find a constructive way to preserve history without remaining beholden to it.\n\nShould we replace those statues with carefully worded plaques, offering a more complete and nuanced explanation of their role in history than simply “virtuous and wise”? Should the statues be collected into an open-air museum (as Budapest did with its communist statues, in Memento Park), so those generals can preach their racist ideology to each other, removed from polite society, without needlessly confronting passersby? Should we create a Museum of American Racism — a series of Slavery Documentation Centers — that detail the shameful crimes of our past, as a reminder and a warning to Americans in the present and the future?\n\nAgain, Bristol inspires me to do better.\n\nBack Home: The United States of America\n\nAfter hopscotching around our globe, we return home to the United States of America. With the benefit of comparing notes with other societies, how does the USA measure up?\n\nWhen we’re at our best, we make strides toward reckoning honestly with our past sins. The Museum of African American History in Washington, DC, for example, does a beautiful, complete, and even-handed job of telling the story of Black Americans and their ancestors.\n\nJuneteenth — a celebration that originated in the Black community to commemorate the abolition of slavery — is now a federal holiday, and more and more organizations (including Rick Steves’ Europe) show their respect by closing their offices for the day.\n\nAnd even in my own lifetime, I have observed the USA doing a more honest job of acknowledging our genocide against Native American tribes — though nowhere near to the righteous degree of New Zealand/Aotearoa or Canada.\n\nHowever, in recent years — as the political pendulum swings to dizzying extremes — I fear that we are facing a rising tide of people who would prefer to simply edit out the most uncomfortable details in our national narrative.\n\nIn some states, textbooks are being rewritten to downplay our heritage of slavery and racism. These days, ambiguity and intentional omission trump clarity and specificity in explaining to our children exactly how certain people have been treated by our country, and still are, and why.\n\nCritical Race Theory (CRT), paired with the deathly curse of “woke” — both concepts that originated in the Black community — have been appropriated and cruelly weaponized. Terms like these have become an excuse for (mainly) white Americans to shut down any healthy conversation about our shared national narrative that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nLook: I’m not interested in wading into the “woke culture wars.” In fact, I’m sticking to my guns: The importance of history can and should be a nonpartisan issue. History matters, to everyone, even if they don’t realize it. And an honest and frank acknowledgement of the facts of history, by any society, is always a good thing. History tells us where we’ve been, and it helps us figure out where we’re going.\n\nI believe this even more strongly having traveled to places where people grapple constructively with their history, and to places where people would rather hide from it. And I’m here to tell you: Societies in the first group are stronger, healthier, smarter, more successful, and more respected on the world stage than places in the second group. Honesty can be painful, but it’s how we grow and become better.\n\nIf you believe that contemporary Germans owe it to the world — and the six million Jews their ancestors murdered in gas chambers — to continue to reckon with their past crimes; if you think that child molestation scandals deserve to be acknowledged in a retelling of the life of John Paul II; if you respect the Dutch for including the stories of collaborators along with stories of victims and uprisers in their Resistance Museum; if you admire the Kiwis for acknowledging that their island was deceptively taken from people who’d been on Aotearoa for centuries earlier; if you think it’s a shame that Viktor Orbán removed the statue of a great communist reformer just because he was also, technically, a communist; if you appreciate Bristol’s nuanced approach of remembering Edward Colston without honoring him — then you should also be willing to face the discomfort of teaching our children about America’s shameful heritage of slavery and racism, and so many other topics that deserve open and frank conversation.\n\nWhen you brush aside inconvenient realities, they don’t simply go away. They just fester, impacted and infected. They wait there, only getting uglier and worse, slowly beginning to stink, until they’re eventually kicked up again by some future generation — and have become an even worse problem to deal with.\n\nIt’s very easy to see blemishes when looking at other cultures, from afar. It’s much harder to see them when we look in the mirror. But we owe it to ourselves, and to future generations, to avoid the temptation to slide into denial. So the next time someone tries to dodge a conversation about less-than-noble elements of our past, consider asking them: Why does it make you so uncomfortable to reckon honestly with our nation’s history? Because that’s what healthy, functioning societies do.\n\nIn fact, it’s what makes a country great.\n\nWhen you’re on the road in Europe, sometimes it’s the little differences that resonate the most: pragmatic, clever solutions to everyday problems that inspire you to do better back home.\n\nI was reminded of this recently while updating our Rick Steves guidebook in Amsterdam. On a sunny day, I was enjoying a stroll through Vondelpark when I spotted an unusual garbage can, which appeared to have a built-in beverage caddy.\n\nSuddenly I realized the purpose: In the Netherlands, to encourage recycling, they charge a €0.15 deposit when you buy any drink in a bottle or can; then, when you return the container, you recoup the deposit.\n\nOf course, many places have a similar deposit system, and have for a long time. (Who could forget the classic Seinfeld where Kramer hatched a scheme to take a mail truck full of pop cans to Michigan to claim the 10¢-per-can deposit?) What struck me was the simple wisdom of making it easy to leave unwanted containers so that they’re easier to collect by someone else — presumably, someone who could use the money.\n\nThis little eureka thrilled me. As someone who tries to be a conscientious traveler, I often feel conflicted when finishing a bottle of fizzy water or Coke Zero. The recycler in me hates to stick in the garbage; the efficient traveler in me hates to carry it around (since I typically don’t carry a day bag, it has to jab awkwardly out of my pocket); and the humanitarian in me wishes I could hand it off to someone who’d appreciate the deposit. These “donation rings” (doneerringen) — really just a few pieces of well-designed metal — are a simple, pragmatic, effective solution.\n\nIt solves other problems, too: Elsewhere in Amsterdam, I saw garbage cans (not yet equipped with donation rings) that had been rifled through, with trash strewn across the sidewalk. Clearly someone had gone looking for deposit containers in a way that was degrading to them, while also created a mess. So even if all you care about is a tidy city, donation rings are a no-brainer.\n\nI snapped a photo of the donation rings, spent a few minutes tapping out a post about this little observation, and put it up on Facebook and Instagram, where I like to share these little epiphanies and insights as I travel. The initial response was enthusiastic — similar to my, “Wow, cool idea!”\n\nThen a surprising thing happened. A few days later, in the middle of the night, the post went viral. It’s now been seen by more than 10 million people and “liked” by more than 150,000 — which are ludicrous numbers for someone with my modest following. That photo of a garbage can, and a few short, hurriedly composed paragraphs of text, may be the most-read thing I’ll ever write. (One colleague teased me, “This trash can will clearly be your legacy.”)\n\nThe responses were fun to sift through. Several people (in Portland, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Australia, and elsewhere) wanted credit for having a similar system on their garbage cans. (Noted!) Others pointed out that it would be even better for society to provide a proper safety net, so that people didn’t have to resort to collecting deposit containers. (Agreed! This is a band-aid, albeit a clever one.)\n\nBut the consensus was simply this: Great idea! Wish we had that here. Several commenters even CCed their local authorities. If this little post winds up inspiring a few communities to look into donation rings…I consider that a very good day’s work.\n\nThis whole episode — along with threatening to brand me “the donation rings trash can guy” for the rest of my career — reinforced my sense that when we travel thoughtfully, attentively, and with our mind and our eyes open, we notice little differences in the way societies operate. Some of these ways, we may find impractical or annoying. But many times, they can be an inspiration…even an epiphany.\n\n§ § §\n\nIn my recent travels, I’ve been making a point to tune into these different ways…and, where possible, to share them with others. Here are just a few examples.\n\nJust a few days before flying to Amsterdam, I was waiting for my boat in Venice when I cracked open a much-needed bottle of ice-cold sparkling water. No matter how hard I turned the bottle cap, one little plastic filament stubbornly kept the cap attached to the plastic ring around the neck of the bottle. In that moment, I realized I’d been running into this same hiccup throughout my time in Italy, and that I’d even noticed it the previous fall in other parts of Europe. At first, I chalked it up to faulty design…a defect. But it was so consistent, it must be intentional.\n\nA little Googling turned up the answer: As of 2024, the European Union requires these “tethered caps” on all single-use plastic bottles. It’s intended to keep the entire bottle intact, as one unit, for easier disposal and recycling. Yes, it takes some getting used to. But when you imagine all of those little plastic bottle caps rolling around the cobbles, piazzas, and gutters of Europe — not to mention, getting lodged in the esophagi of untold numbers of woodland critters and sea life — tethered caps seem a very smart solution.\n\nAlso in Italy, I was reminded of the tiered pricing system at cafés: You’ll pay more (in some cases, much more) to sit out on the piazza, rather than if you stand at the counter inside. In fact, even at the grandest of grand cafés in Italy, you can always get a simple espresso (un caffè) at the counter inside for just over €1.\n\nTesting this rule of thumb, I waltzed past the dueling orchestras on St. Mark’s Square — some of the most expensive real estate in all of Italy — and into a venerable café. Inside at the counter, I ordered a caffè macchiato, then stood in the opulent interior as I sipped it. My bill came to €1.50.\n\nAs I left, I checked the price for the very same drink at the outdoor tables: €12, plus a €6 cover charge. If you’re lingering over the amazing views and the music, this is a worthwhile investment. If you just want a quick coffee, those prices are absurd. This “progressive taxation” approach to pricing drinks has a certain pragmatic beauty; you pay based on your experience. (And it’s also a great tip for budget travelers.)\n\nSome of these smart solutions are Europe-wide. The EU has a draconian “Air Passenger Rights” policy that protects travelers from having their valuable time wasted by airlines. Strict guidelines mandate what an airline is required to provide to a passenger whose flight has been delayed or cancelled. If I ran an airline in Europe, this would make me pull my hair out. As a frequent air passenger in Europe…I absolutely adore it.\n\nAnd I have directly benefitted from it. Last year, my wife and I were flying from Seattle to Norway by way of Amsterdam, with a tight connection. The good news: Our first flight was a few minutes early. The bad news: Our connecting flight had already been cancelled due to a technical problem, with no further flights scheduled until the next day. We got nervous, imagining being stranded for hours — maybe overnight — at Schiphol Airport, missing out on reservations we had waiting for us in Norway.\n\nBut the Europeans in the waiting area with us seemed unconcerned. One of them pulled out her phone and called up a page with the details of the EU policy. “No worries,” she said reassuringly to her husband, and to all of us antsy eavesdroppers. “If they delay us for more than three hours, they have to pay each of us €250. They won’t let that happen.”\n\nSure enough, within minutes, they allocated a different plane to take us to our destination, and boarding commenced almost immediately. Soon we were loaded on a bus and zipping across the Schiphol tarmac to our plane. And we wound up arriving in Norway just 45 minutes after our scheduled arrival time — even with the equipment change. Without the financial accountability mandated by that policy, I’m certain we’d have been cooling our jets for much longer.\n\nLet’s head back to the Netherlands, which seems to be one of Europe’s top incubators for these everyday innovations. The Dutch are pragmatic, solution-focused, and early adopters, to the degree that they sometimes leap before they look. When I’m updating our Rick Steves Amsterdam guidebook — as I was on this trip — frankly, it can get exhausting. There’s always some cutting-edge new technology that’s been rolled out. And, often, by the time we come back a couple of years later to do our next round of updates, that Hot New Thing has already been abandoned and replaced with the next trend.\n\nFor example: Contactless or “tap-to-pay” credit card and smartphone payments on public transit are widely used throughout Europe and around the world. But the Netherlands, as far as I know, is the first and only European country where you can pay for every single ride on public transit (whether in-city trams, buses, and Metro, or intercity trains and buses) simply by tapping your existing credit card. Using this system (called OVpay), you never have to buy a ticket.\n\nOf course, I needed to try this out. And it worked well. Starting at the airport, where I wanted to take the bus into town, I was able to skip the tiresome chore of looking for a ticket machine. Instead, when the bus pulled up, I just hopped on and tapped my credit card against the scanner to “check in.” And then, when I got to my destination, I tapped my card again to “check out.” The cost of the ride was automatically charged to my card.\n\nI tried this everywhere I went: on trams, the Metro, even the intercity train to the airport. And it worked brilliantly…another example of Dutch problem-solving making life easier. I can imagine a time, a few years from now, when the very idea of “tickets” for transportation are a thing of the past. You just tap in, tap out, and you’re done.\n\nHowever…\n\nWhen working on our guidebooks, it’s also my job to think through potential pitfalls. And even this ingeniously simple system has some serious caveats: A couple traveling together needs two separate payment cards. Fair enough. But what if you’re a family of four or five? Yes, that means that each family member needs their own credit card, smartphone payment app, etc.\n\nOn a particularly busy afternoon, a French family of five was waiting for the tram next to me. I knew this was going to be a big headache for them. Sure enough, the father wound up having to download a payment app, load up his credit card, use the app to buy five tickets, then scan each one individually. By the time he was done with this agonizing procedure, the family had almost missed their stop.\n\nAnother pitfall: Because the Dutch are all-in on this system, they are largely doing away with other ways of paying. Out in front of Centraal Station, where arriving travelers hop onto a tram to their hotel, there used to be abundant ticket machines. Now these have mostly gone away, with just a few hiding out in the Metro station downstairs. And you can no longer buy tickets once you’re on board, unless you download and set up that app that the French father was fumbling with. If you’re in the very slim majority of people who, for whatever reason, don’t want to or can’t pay by tapping your card…your life just got harder.\n\nHere’s my point: It’s fun to notice these clever solutions when you travel. But it’s also important to avoid a “grass is always greener” naivete. Every system is flawed, and a few flaws don’t make it worthless. That’s just another problem to solve.\n\nSmart people, around the world, come up with smart solutions. And if we all put our heads together, notice what works and what doesn’t, and commit ourselves to improving our societies, there are already a lot of great ideas out there, ripe for the picking. We just need to find them, do our due diligence to think through the pros and the cons, adapt them to be even better, and make them our own.\n\n§ § §\n\nOne final thought occurs to me, in this very heated election year: Effectively all of the solutions I’ve described are spearheaded by some level of government, from federal all the way down to municipal. Observing Europe’s willingness to attempt creative solutions, I’m reminded that it’s largely possible because Europeans, by and large, both trust and expect their government to be proactive and effective in crafting a better society. (And if they aren’t, they face consequences at the ballot box.)\n\nI wonder if Europe is more innovative partly because ambitious solutions like the donation rings, or the tethered caps, or nationwide tap-to-pay must be coordinated by the state? They’re always some naysayer who goes on a crusade against even the best idea — especially in America, where rugged individualism is prized, contrarianism is practically a religion, and many are terrified of the mythical boogeyman of “Big Government.”\n\nAnytime I share observations about Europe’s clever solutions and high-functioning societies (as I did last summer, when I marveled at the slick, well-coordinated infrastructure in Norway), some critics respond that such idealism has no place in America. “Yes, it would be great. But come on! We’d never be able to do that here.”\n\nMy response: Why not? We are our government — federal, state, local. If your leaders won’t take action to seek creative and effective solutions, if they’d rather shout and scold and scapegoat and obfuscate about complicated problems rather than trying to solve them…well, then, vote for someone else.\n\nIn this election year, support candidates and parties who are inspired by fresh ideas that help everyday people, and who are willing to implement them. (If you liked the sound of that EU “Air Passenger Rights” policy — and, frankly, any travelers should — it’s worth noting that our Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, has been in the news for rolling out a similar policy Stateside.)\n\nEuropeans solve problems because they have the will to work together toward those solutions. From all of these specific examples, that may be the biggest takeaway: We can do better. We just have to want it.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite “slice-of-life” little ways that Europe does things differently? Which ones might you like to try out back home?\n\nIf you enjoy observations like these, be sure to Follow me on Facebook and/or Instagram. I’m heading to Europe again soon, and will be sharing lots more.\n\nLooking for something a little different in 2024?\n\nEach year around this time, I brainstorm a list of my favorite European Discoveries. And after another very busy year of traveling to update guidebooks and make TV shows — in Ireland, Norway, Iceland, Hungary, and Poland — as usual, the places that stand out most vividly are not the big, marquee sights; they’re the lesser-known places, with fewer crowds and a more authentic vibe. (You could say they have a high charm-to-tourists ratio.)\n\nAs always, I’m not suggesting these are any “better” than the biggies. If you’re tight on time, I won’t blame you for visiting Kraków rather than Warsaw, or Dingle rather than Derry. Rather, when planning your 2024 travels, think of these as intriguing palate-cleansers.\n\nThink about it: When you look back on past trips, aren’t many of your fondest memories of places where you least expected them? Feel free to share your own Discoveries in the Comments.\n\nLausanne and Lake Geneva, Switzerland\n\nIf a big part of Switzerland’s appeal is its cultural and linguistic diversity, then Lausanne is one of its most rewarding cities. This genteel-feeling city speaks, and feels, French…but with a Swiss accent.\n\nFrom the vineyard-draped shores of Lake Geneva, the city climbs vertically up the slopes; elevators, a funicular-like métro, and steeply uphill hikes are required simply to traverse a few blocks. Updating our guidebook, I went looking for a hotel just up the block…and quickly learned that it was “up” indeed. It felt like climbing a mountain.\n\nBut Lausanne is worth the effort. Visitors enjoy Swiss-French fusion meals in classy brasseries; a historic old quarter oozing with endearing medieval details; a hazy waterfront promenade leading to an excellent Olympics museum; and one of Europe’s most compelling, thought-provoking museums: the Collection de l’Art Brut, which showcases poignant works created by artists marginalized by society, often dismissed or even institutionalized as “insane.”\n\nLausanne is also a prime jumping-off-point for Lake Geneva sightseeing. A quick train ride or ridiculously scenic boat ride (preferably on a historic paddleboat steamer) takes you to Château de Chillon, a stony fortress jabbing out into the lake.\n\nYou can also hike or bike through lakefront vineyards; stop off in Montreux for its stylish waterfront; or take a scenic side-trip (on the “Chocolate Train”) up to the lovely cheesemaking village of Gruyères and a Swiss chocolate factory.\n\nLausanne and Lake Geneva is one of those places that might not “make the cut” on a tight itinerary. But if you go…you’ll want to give it plenty of time.\n\nDerry, Northern Ireland\n\nOn my six-week odyssey to update our Ireland guidebook — scouring the island from tip to toe — something about Derry grabbed me. It has a hard-fought history, both old and recent. Its stout city walls — now enjoyable for a stroll — hint at centuries-ago sieges. And the emotionally charged murals of the Bogside neighborhood testify to the city’s pivotal role in the Troubles, Northern Ireland’s sectarian strife that grabbed headlines from the 1960s through the 1990s.\n\nBut I also found Derry unexpectedly delightful, history aside. The sitcom Derry Girls — which tells the story of local teenagers and their parents during the final years of the Troubles — has become a global hit on Netflix. Locals embrace the show, which captures the world-weary wit that the people of Derry have learned to apply to the highs and lows of life. And, as an outside observer, it seemed to me that Derry Girls is also helping this plucky city turn the page from a hard history to a brighter future: In a sign of the times, the new Derry Girls mural — rather than the important but tragedy-tinged murals of the Bogside — has become the city’s most-photographed.\n\nI sensed a new day in Derry. On a sunny summer afternoon, the Peace Bridge linking the Nationalist and Unionist sides of the river was jammed with people. Across that bridge, the former British military barracks is being converted into a new entertainment and commercial complex, with a big hotel and fine gastro-brewpub, and a state-of-the-art city museum slated to open in a few years.\n\nNot to mention, Derry is a prime home base for side-tripping (in less than an hour) to the Antrim Coast, with Old Bushmills Distillery, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, and the breathtaking Giant’s Causeway. As Derry Girl Michelle put it: “Foreigners f—kin’ love the Giant’s Causeway!”\n\nWarsaw, Poland\n\nThe sprawling Polish capital often gets overlooked by travelers. Kraków is more historic and accessible. Gdańsk is more beautiful. (Shhh…don’t tell Krakow!) And Toruń is more charming.\n\nBut ever so slowly, over 20 years of visits, I’ve watched Warsaw transform from a gloomy, battle-battered, postcommunist eyesore into a place that’s fascinating, engaging, and — yes, really! — actually fun.\n\nWhen we filmed new public television episodes in Poland this summer, the crew was impressed by today’s Warsaw. It has state-of-the-art museums covering everything from Jewish heritage to Marie Curie, and from Polish history to hands-on science exhibits for kids. It’s a capital of culture and music: We filmed two entirely different Chopin concerts, one in a sprawling park and the other in a cozy drawing room, and couldn’t decide which we liked better. It has an outstanding food scene, including one of the best meals our crew says they’ve ever filmed (at Bibenda). It has a thrilling variety of architecture from every era: rebuilt medieval townhomes; imposing communist concrete; graceful Baroque churches; slick, sleek skyscrapers. And it has a history as epic as anyplace in Europe.\n\nMost of all, Warsaw is simply enjoyable. On a balmy Friday night, we did a loop through the city’s up-and-coming entertainment districts. We began at a “post-industrial” entertainment complex (which are all the rage across Poland) — a former brick power plant now refurbished with trendy eateries, bars, and shops.\n\nOutside along their inviting riverfront park, Varsovians from every walk of life were having the time of their lives: promenading along the Vistula; filling giant cocktail-party barges; splashing in playful fountains; relaxing and socializing on park benches. And we enjoyed the heck out of Warsaw, right along with them.\n\nPorto, Portugal\n\nPortugal’s second city is actually several cities in one — and all of them are delightful.\n\nDown along the banks of the Douro River, under the soaring girders of oversized bridges, the colorfully seedy Ribeira district faces a row of port-wine lodges.\n\nFrom there, stair-like lanes twist steeply up to the modern city center, a mix of drab urban streets and pockets of architectural refinement: Pretty churches with spiraling stone towers, clad in finely handpainted blue tiles. The Lello & Irmão Bookstore, with its twisting wood-grain fantasyland of literature. The soaring Clérigos tower, reaching up to heaven between rattling trolleys. São Bento Train Station, with more of those gorgeous blue tiles. The Palácio da Bolsa, a former stock exchange palace that maxes out on neo-historical styles. And, yes, even one of the finest McDonalds on the planet.\n\nAnd maybe the most impressive bit of engineering you’ll find in Porto is its famous sandwich, the francesinha: pork cutlets, sliced sausages, and Swiss cheese wedged between two slices of dense bread, then grilled and smothered with more melted cheese, a fried egg, and spicy sauce. This delicious gut-bomb (you won’t need to eat for a week) is just one example of Porto’s outstanding food scene, ranging from memorable splurges to rustic market stalls.\n\nWhile it may lack the cachet and grandeur of Lisbon, Porto is every bit as enjoyable…and maybe more so.\n\nFjordside Villages of Iceland and Norway\n\nOne of my personal travel themes in 2023 was dropping in on a wide variety of tiny towns on giant fjords, all over both Iceland and Norway.\n\nLooping around Iceland’s Ring Road — the 800-mile ultimate road trip that circles the perimeter of the island — three favorite villages stand out: Húsavík, with its colorful harbor and whale-watching boats; Siglufjörður, an important herring fishery a century ago, which loves to tell the story of the “Herring Girls” in its exceptional museum; and Seyðisfjörður, with a hip, funky, and artistic vibe in a remote and dramatic setting — about as far as you get from Reykjavík while still being in Iceland.\n\nA few weeks later, in Norway, I settled in to a couple more fjordside hamlets. Balestrand, conveniently located along the express boat route between Bergen and Flåm, commands a grand view over the mighty Sognefjord. Its harborfront grand hotel (with its elaborate smorgasbord dinner) and charming Ciderhuset cidery (offering tours, tastings, and pairings with delicious Turkish-accented fare) provided two of my favorite meals of the year. Deeper in the fjord is my favorite fjordside village of all: Tidy, tranquil Solvorn, a cozy burg with historic landmark hotel (Norway’s oldest), multicolored wooden boat sheds lining the shore, and a ferry that putters across the fjord once an hour to one of Norway’s finest stave churches.\n\nIceland and Norway are both best for their natural wonders. And, frankly, many settlements (especially in Iceland) are more functional than charming. But these five towns tempt the just-passing-through traveler to downshift…settle in…and enjoy.\n\nSiracusa and Noto, Sicily\n\nA year ago, the second season of HBO’s The White Lotus put Sicily on many travelers’ wish lists. After doing a guidebook-research road trip around the country a few years back, I really enjoyed seeing many of those places pop up on the show.\n\nThe White Lotus was set in the mega-touristy, off-puttingly upscale tourist town of Taormina. Personally, despite its grand location facing Mount Etna, Taormina left me cold. The place that really sticks out is a couple hours’ drive south: Siracusa, the modern city at the site of ancient Syracuse.\n\nSiracusa feels less “discovered” than many Sicilian towns. I could do endless laps around its old town, the islet of Ortigia, which evokes both the ancient days of Archimedes and the lavish blossoming of Baroque. Ortigia has some of the finest squares and prettiest churches in Sicily. And if you need more substantial sightseeing, you can tour the archaeological museums and ancient sites farther inland. Or just take a dip at the rocky beach.\n\nAnd while you’re in the area, make time for a day-trip to Noto, tucked in the countryside less than an hour’s drive to the southwest. Among Sicilians, Noto is known for two things: its lavish Baroque architecture and its top-quality gelato shops. If I’m being honest, I’m not sure which I enjoyed more.\n\nAntwerp, Belgium\n\nOn Belgian itineraries, Antwerp gets overlooked. Maybe that’s understandable. Bruges is cute, cobbled, and canaled. Brussels is the bustling capital, with the very grand-indeed Grand Place. Ghent mixes charm with urbanity, and boasts an exquisite Van Eyck altarpiece.\n\nAntwerp — lonely Antwerp! — plays fourth fiddle. But those who visit Belgium’s second-biggest city find it to be engaging and rewarding, if lovably gritty.\n\nOn arrival, you find yourself standing in one of Europe’s most impressive train stations — a temple to travel that rivals any in Europe.\n\nFrom there, a grand city spreads out before you. Famous for its funky design heritage and its Art Nouveau architecture, as well as for its diamond industry, Antwerp itself is something of a diamond in the rough. But increasingly, it’s being polished to a high shine. On my last visit, I stepped into the stunning Handelsbeurs — the former stock exchange, with Neo-Gothic flourishes, that evokes the city’s glory days as a trading power.\n\nOn Antwerp’s picturesque main market square — as pleasant as any in the Low Countries — I found plenty of good eateries. But, on a mission to update our Belgium guidebook, I scouted even better ones tucked into characteristic neighborhoods all over the city, especially in t’Zuid, a quick tram ride to the south. There I found, among other great places, Elsie’s — a great opportunity to sample Ethiopian and Etrurian cuisine in this multiethnic city.\n\nAntwerp is that kind of city: One that rewards exploration and curiosity. It makes you work a bit to unearth those gems…but it’s worth the effort.\n\nDublin’s Stoneybatter Neighborhood, Ireland\n\nI’m always on the lookout for fun and funky neighborhoods in great European cities. And while updating our guidebook in Dublin this summer, several leads led me to Stoneybatter.\n\nThis low-key neighborhood is effectively one street at the edge of the city center (a longish walk or quick bus, tram, or taxi ride from downtown). Stoneybatter’s main drag is lined with narrow storefronts, colorful cottages, indie bookstores and boutiques, lively street art, more than its share of stay-awhile cafés, a variety of global food eateries, and some fine dining options.\n\nI ate very well at Grano, an Italian-owned trattoria with a short but tempting menu of authentic choices — the kind of place where, I imagine, each and every dish would be delicious. But walking to and from dinner, I kept wishing I had more time to eat at a half-dozen other places.\n\nPart of Stoneybatter’s charm is its tucked-away-ness. It’s a short walk from the big, slick Smithfield Square, with its giant distillery, industrial-strength youth hostel, and lineup of predictable chain eateries. From there, you can walk just a few minutes northwest, passing The Cobblestone — Dublin’s most respected pub for live traditional music. Stoneybatter, just around the corner feels quirky, locally owned, and fun to explore. It’s the kind of place where I could happily imagine settling in for a week or two at a cozy Airbnb, sampling a different trendy brunch spot each morning.\n\nSlovenia\n\nIf you know me at all, you can be sure Slovenia will wind up on any “Best of” list I write. This year, I mulled over which part of Slovenia merits a “Discoveries” mention for 2024:\n\nThe beautiful, charming, user-friendly capital, Ljubljana, with its stay-a-while ambience and outstanding food scene?\n\nDreamy Lake Bled, with its castle-capped cliff and church-crowned island? Or maybe head higher into the mountains — to the stunning Julian Alps, with some of the most breathtaking cut-glass peaks in Europe?\n\nPerhaps head to the seaside, specifically the charming port town of Piran, with its sleek, marbled square, atmospheric back lanes, delectable seafood restaurants, and all of the charm of small Croatian coastal towns, but tidier and friendlier?\n\nOr maybe we should do a little spelunking? When choosing between some of the most spectacular karstic caves on the planet, should we opt for the hauntingly grand caverns of the Škocjan Caves, or the more accessible formations of nearby Postojna?\n\nOr does heading off the beaten path appeal? Should we explore the outstanding wineries of Goriška Brda, sharing a border with Italy’s famous Friuli wine region, or the arid limestone beauty of the Vípava Valley?\n\nHeading to Europe at Mardi Gras time? Might I suggest paying a visit to Ptuj, with its unforgettable Kurentovanje costumed-beasts processions?\n\nOr — hey, wait a minute! — why not…all of it?\n\nWherever You’ve Been Dreaming of Going\n\nOne of the lasting lessons of the pandemic is a new awareness that we can’t take anything for granted. Time may be shorter than you think. That’s why a popular theme has been “revenge travel” — finally getting to those items you’ve always dreamed of.\n\nMaybe you’ve wished you could hike the Tour de Mont Blanc, around Europe’s tallest mountain. That was on Rick’s list — and it was one of his first trips back after COVID.\n\nIn my case, I can think of several boxes I’ve ticked recently. This past June, I realized a lifelong dream of being in Dublin to celebrate Bloomsday — a celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses. On the date that Joyce’s masterpiece novel is set, his hometown’s streets are full of lit nerds wearing straw boater hats and Edwardian costumes, reading passages from Ulysses, and greeting each other with, “Heigho! Happy Bloomsday!” Totally worth it.\n\nOther items on my lifelong wish list I’ve recently ticked: Exploring some new parts of Italy, from the fascinating, multicultural, coastal city of Trieste; to the culinary heartland of Emilia-Romagna; to the wine and food mecca of Piedmont.\n\nOr ascending Lovćen, a mountaintop mausoleum overlooking virtually the entire country of Montenegro, and hiking up countless steps to a dramatic monument carved by the great sculptor Ivan Meštrović.\n\nSome of these may seem a little obscure…because they are! I’m certainly not advising you to visit Dublin on Bloomsday, or to sample every stuffed pasta in Modena or Parma, or to huff up to the summit of Lovćen. I doubt you’d enjoy those as much as I would. (Well, maybe the pasta.) But I’m sure you have something on your personal wish list that you’d enjoy just as much I loved those experiences.\n\nSo…get to it! You have about 365 days to make it happen in 2024.\n\nBe sure to share your own Discoveries in the Comments!\n\nYou can also look back at my Discoveries from 2023, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018…all still great choices.\n\nIf you’d like to follow along with me on my 2024 travels, be sure to follow me on Facebook and on Instagram.\n\nAnd consider checking out my travel memoir, The Temporary European: Lessons and Confessions from a Professional Traveler.\n\nYou’re heading to Europe. You’ve chosen your destinations. And now you’re starting to daydream about your chance to be a temporary Londoner, a temporary Parisian, or a temporary Roman. The next question: Where should you stay?\n\nAs the 2023 travel season winds down, early birds are already starting to make plans for 2024. Most people get serious about this in January or so. But if you want to get a jump on the “competition” — and have your pick of places to stay — it’s smart to get started now. (And it’s a fun, constructive way to distract yourself as the days get shorter and colder.)\n\nI have some friends who are dong just that: dreaming of a trip with their two teenagers next June in Rome and Athens. They asked me where I’d suggest staying in those great cities. And I thought to myself: That’s an excellent question! But first, I need a little more information: What kind of neighborhood are you looking for?\n\nInspired by that question, I’ve brainstormed my suggested home-base neighborhoods for 10 of Europe’s most popular cities. This intel is hard-earned, from years of scouring these cities for accommodations to recommend in our Rick Steves guidebooks.\n\nThose lists are below. For each city, I’ve broken my choices down into three categories:\n\nCentral and Touristy. This is where you’d stay to have the top sightseeing right outside your door. However, that also means these neighborhoods are touristy, often a bit tacky, very expensive, crowded, and not particularly “authentic” or “local-feeling.” But sometimes having everything close at hand is worth making those sacrifices, especially on a quick, targeted trip.\n\nHip and Foodie. Every city worth its salt has an edgy, “emerging” restaurant and nightlife zone. These can be either central or more remote; either way, they’re typically less polished and more characteristic, and they tend to skew more youthful. If you’re in town primarily to check out all the “destination” foodie restaurants, rather than to sightsee until you drop, and if you’d like to settle in to the local version of Williamsburg, Los Feliz, or Wicker Park…then these neighborhoods are for you. (If you don’t know what those names mean, then these neighborhoods are probably not for you.)\n\nCharming and Residential. If you don’t mind commuting to the main sightseeing and trendiest eateries, it can be worthwhile to stay a little farther from the city center. More sedate and charming than the central districts, these neighborhoods feel “older-local” as opposed to “younger-local.” Because they’re less central and less touristy, lodgings are often more affordable (though certain high-end suburbs can be surprisingly pricey). If the “Hip and Foodie” places are for hipsters, then the “Charming and Residential” places are for yuppies and retirees. Just be prepared for a longish metro, bus, or tram ride to achieve most of your bucket list.\n\nUse the suggestions below as a starting point when searching for accommodations — whether hotels, B&Bs, or short-term apartment rentals (like Airbnb). Many room-booking search engines allow you to enter specific neighborhoods to narrow down your options, or you can search via the map. Read reviews carefully, within these areas, to make sure the lodgings you’re considering match your expectations. And here’s a pro tip: Before booking, go for a little “virtual stroll” of the surrounding area on Google Maps Street View to make sure it looks like a place you’d like to settle in.\n\nLondon\n\nTouristy/Central: Soho and Covent Garden can’t be beat for access to many of the top sights, the West End theater scene, and some of London’s best restaurants to boot.\n\nHip/Foodie: The East End, specifically Shoreditch and nearby, is where hipsters feel at home, with exuberant street art and many of the city’s most interesting restaurants. (Many top London restaurants began with a humble location in Shoreditch before opening a fancy one in Soho.)\n\nCharming/Residential: Try neighborhoods just to the west, surrounding Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens (South Kensington, Notting Hill, Earl’s Court); or to the north, near the British Museum (Marylebone, Fitzrovia). In this vast city, there are countless other choices, depending on how far out you’re willing to travel; Dulwich, to the south, and Ted Lasso’s Richmond, to the west, are each a 30-minute commuter train ride out of the center.\n\nParis\n\nTouristy/Central: It’s hard to resist staying near the Eiffel Tower (ideally with a view from your window); either there, or in the Latin Quarter (near the Île de la Cité/Notre-Dame and Île St. Louis) puts you very close to the sights…and the crowds.\n\nHip/Foodie: For something that’s still quite central, but more funky, consider the Marais, or some of the neighborhoods just beyond it: Try Oberkampf and Canal-St-Martin, just to the north, and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, just beyond Bastille to the east. The famous Montmartre is a strange combination of obnoxiously touristy and achingly bohemian…just as it was a century ago.\n\nCharming/Residential: It’s hard to resist Rue Cler. This quintessentially Parisian, very central market street is that strange “unicorn” of neighborhoods that ticks only the best bits of both the “Touristy/Central” and “Charming/Residential” boxes. Another good option, slightly less characteristic but still handy, is Luxembourg Gardens.\n\nRome\n\nTouristy/Central: It’s a thrill to stay as close to the Pantheon as possible, putting you right in the magical and romantic heart of Rome. For fewer tourists, look in the sleepier, more appealing streets that run from Piazza Navona west, toward the river and Vatican City.\n\nHip/Foodie: I just love the Monti district, tucked in narrow residential lanes basically across the street from the Roman Forum. Testaccio, farther out, surrounds Rome’s most engaging market hall and offers close proximity to restaurants filled with foodies who’ve done their homework.\n\nCharming/Residential: Trastevere, which could arguably fit in any of these categories, is extremely atmospheric, slightly less touristy than the most central parts of Rome, and still within a long but very engaging walk to many of the top sights. The small, quiet zone just behind the Colosseum (to the east) feels a world apart from the touristy chaos.\n\nBerlin\n\nTouristy/Central: The city’s spine, Unter den Linden, has several big hotels but lacks personality. That’s why I enjoy the area around Hackescher Markt, just north of Museum Island, which has a little more character and enjoys about as convenient a location as you’ll find in this sprawling city.\n\nHip/Foodie: Not only the best neighborhood in Berlin, but one of my favorite hipster neighborhoods anywhere, Prenzlauer Berg has oodles of funky Berlin character, outstanding restaurants, a true neighborhood feel, and easy transportation connections around the city. For a deeper dive, consider Neuköln, Kreuzberg, or any number of other cool Kieze (neighborhoods) that Berlin specializes in.\n\nCharming/Residential: The former West Berlin (now called City West) was once a Time Square-like “city center” hub; now it’s a sleepy, sedate, upscale, and charming suburb with relatively easy connections to the big sights. Savignyplatz is the centerpiece of this area, and the surrounding Charlottenburg district has a similar feel.\n\nAthens\n\nTouristy/Central: The Plaka, tucked at the base of the Acropolis (between the Monastiraki transit hub and the busy Syntagma Square), is super-central and super-touristy.\n\nHip/Foodie: Just across the street from Monastiraki, Pysrri is funky, youthful, and foodie, with an appreciation for wild street art and delicious street food, and close proximity to the thriving Central Market without being too far from the central sightseeing zone.\n\nCharming/Residential: The sleepier streets of Makrigianni and Koukaki, on the “far side” of the Acropolis (to the south), make for a comfortable and relatively mellow home base.\n\nAmsterdam\n\nTouristy/Central: If you’d like to have very easy access to the sights (and to endless tulips-and-wooden-shoes souvenir shops), stay somewhere along Damrak or in the nearby streets of the Red Light District.\n\nHip/Foodie: The Jordaan, a short stroll along postcard canals west of the central spine, is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Europe, period. It’s an ideal combination of two categories: Both hip and residential, charming and foodie, it’s a clear winner.\n\nCharming/Residential: If looking beyond the Jordaan, the quiet streets of Southwest Amsterdam, around Museumsplein, tick this box — though the proximity to the Rijks and Van Gogh museums can make it feel quite touristy in places.\n\nBudapest\n\nTouristy/Central: Pest’s Town Center (District V), with the Váci Utca pedestrian drag as its spine, is as central and as touristy as you can get. I prefer the area around the Opera House, along the most interesting stretch of Andrássy Út — just a little farther out, but very well-served by public transit, chockablock with great restaurants, and very close to the Seventh District fun (see next).\n\nHip/Foodie: The Seventh District, which overlaps with the Jewish Quarter just across the Small Boulevard from Pest’s Town Center, is one of Europe’s most engaging hipster neighborhoods. It comes with many of the city’s best restaurants (from street food to Michelin-starred) and the fun and fascinating “ruin pub” scene.\n\nCharming/Residential: Buda, across the river from the modern city center, is sleepier, greener, and more sedate. It takes longer to reach much of Pest…but the views across the river are worth the commute. To stay on the Pest side, consider the streets flanking Andrássy Út once you get beyond the Oktagon, in the diplomatic quarter that heads out toward City Park.\n\nDublin\n\nTouristy/Central: Look no farther than Temple Bar and the nearby streets close to Trinity College, on the south bank of the River Liffey. (As a light sleeper, I’ll suggest checking reviews carefully for noise complaints if sleeping anywhere near Temple Bar.)\n\nHip/Foodie: Earlier this year, I discovered the charming yet hip “village in the city” of Stoneybatter, tucked away beyond Smithfield Square to the northwest. While a bit farther from the center, it has some of the city’s hippest restaurants (especially for brunch) and an “I could live here” vibe.\n\nCharming/Residential: South of St. Stephen’s Green, you encounter fewer tourists and a more local feel. I particularly enjoy the area along the southern canal belt; if you’d like a hipper stretch of this area, try to get close to happening Camden Street and the Portobello area.\n\nBarcelona\n\nTouristy/Central: There’s a good reason many tourists enjoy staying in the city center: near Plaça de Catalunya, in the Barri Gòtic, and along the Ramblas. This is Barcelona at its most vivid, touristy, crowded, chaotic, and fun.\n\nHip/Foodie: To escape some of the crowds of the Old City, head to El Born — an easy walk just east of the Barri Gòtic. This area, with the Picasso Museum and Santa Caterina Market, has a more bohemian feel, including great restaurants.\n\nCharming/Residential: The carefully planned Eixample district, which surrounds the Old City on all sides, has an ritzy “uptown” vibe. This is the place to stay if you’d like to pretend you’re a Catalan urbanite for a few days. Or consider the tight, old-school Barceloneta fishermen’s quarter near the water.\n\nIstanbul\n\nTouristy/Central: For such a sprawling city, Istanbul has as surprisingly compact sightseeing core: Sultanahmet, loaded with hotels for tourists who want proximity to the great sights; just downhill, Sirkeci is similar.\n\nHip/Foodie: Kadıköy, across the Bosphorus on the Asian side, is both hip and residential. Back on the European side, consider Beşiktaş, along the Golden Horn below the New District.\n\nCharming/Residential: The New District, across the Golden Horn from the old city center, is still quite urban and intense in places. But you’ll also find some pleasant back streets where you can settle in to a local neighborhood.\n\nSo…what did I miss? Any favorites to add? I’d love to hear your suggestions in the Comments.\n\nI’ve gotten to know all these great European cities through updating our Rick Steves guidebooks — where you’ll find out a lot more about all of these places, including extensive lists of our handpicked hotels and B&Bs in each area."
