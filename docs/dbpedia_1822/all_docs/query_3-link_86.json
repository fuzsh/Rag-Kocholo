        "text": "If you're looking for a vacation at sea that's as colorful as the décor of the cruise ship taking you there, an entire palette of fun activities and hot spots awaits aboard Carnival Glory. For starters, there's a rainbow of salsa options for dressing up your tacos and burritos at BlueIguana Cantina™, while Guy's Burger Joint™ serves up burgers designed by the colorful personality himself: celebrity chef Guy Fieri.\n\nSpeaking of colorful personalities, you'll enjoy a variety of stand-up comedians at The Punchliner Comedy Club™. Picture yourself grabbing a drink at the open-air RedFrog Rum Bar® or BlueIguana Tequila Bar™... whichever color or spirit's more your style. Enjoy a show on the stage at Playlist Productions™, complete with singing and dancing, plus video screens that bring these productions an extra splash of color. Speaking of splash, at Carnival WaterWorks™ the fun flows down the winding curves of the classic Twister and all-new AquaTunnel waterslide — plus twin racing slides and a giant tipping bucket — for countless gallons of fun. And if a picture paints a thousand words, imagine the millions flying off the big screen during a film under the stars at Dive-In Movies. Yes, it's Hollywood meets islands for a date night done right.\n\nWe're not just viewing this ship with rose-colored lenses, either — it's clear that the fun, eye-catching experiences all around you are the real deal... even the fantasy world of Seuss At Sea™, where your favorite books (and characters!) come to life before your eyes. And from the people-watching potential of the Lido Deck, to the see-and-be-seen White Heat Dance Club, Carnival Glory pulls out the stops. It even shows its true colors as it satisfies your stomach with sit-down dining options like the Emerald Room Steakhouse and the aptly-named Golden and Platinum Restaurants. And wait 'till you see the Camel Club Casino — proof that Carnival Glory is a real looker and a truly special cruise ship.\n\nLook to Carnival Glory for one vibrant time at sea."
