        "text": "Location, Location, Location .......... I understand that working with colleagues onsite is a great way to improve efficiency and find the best solutions. When travelling to locations, I make sure to take the time to get it first-hand, looking for ways in which I can help and understand the region's culture better. I believe that getting a better feel for the region/country is key to achieving our goals. We are committed to finding efficient solutions that do not compromise the integrity and culture of the local context. Our team has developed an innovative approach combining creativity with effective planning to make sure that our operations in Portugal run smoothly while delivering exceptional results. The experience of working with colleagues directly has allowed us to create a more tailored approach that takes into account the local context and culture. I'm proud of our dedication to making sure that all stakeholders involved in projects related to Portugal have their needs met while ensuring fast and efficient outcomes for everyone. I believe this is essential in order to ensure successful collaborations with colleagues and clients alike. We have also been looking for new ways to optimize our services, from streamlining communication processes to optimizing resource allocation. Our goal is always to find the most effective approach that can help us drive efficiency and success. As we continue to work in Portugal, I'm excited to see innovative solutions. How proud everyone involved is of the outcome.\n\nI've been getting this question a lot: “Where are you at the moment?” I'm grateful to RWS Group China my former CEO, Victor Wang, as well as BLEND Localization CEO Yair for fulfilling my request. Victor once said, “Life is more important than work. Only when you are satisfied with your personal life can your work benefit from it.” So I start to work from Germany, Taiwan, and China. Working remotely and beyond #WFH. But don't get me wrong, I didn't ask for it during the interview or the first few years. Building trust before requesting. What are the pros and cons? The advantages are working remotely and having time for families. The cons : 💸Higher costs. 🫡Take responsibility for your region. The earliest meeting I had was at 4 am. 🇩🇪In Germany, work starts at 5 am. 🌏In Asia, the regular meetings would finish at 10 pm or sometimes later than that. 🕰️The working hours are longer, with no exact on and off duty time. ✈️Commuting is no fun. This is not a complaint. This is the commitment. This is my way of working remotely. Next week back in Asia and 🔜 ChinaJoy!\n\n“Exploration is curiosity put into action” Don Walsh Let's start 2o24 with sharing an important news regarding our Technology & Strategy Group Internal Mobility's first internal Webinar of the year, taking us to discover TOPIC Embedded Systems in the Netherlands. Missed what the concept is about? 🌍 Internal mobility is a pillar of our strategy. Last year we decided to give the possibility to each and every employee to discover about their own location or about all the locations in the Group. We already hosted 5 Webinars taking us to discover Antaes Asia Singapour, Intys Belgium, Technology & Strategy Munich, ENGLAB in Strasbourg and Technology & Strategy Nantes/Bordeaux/Toulouse area! What do we talk about? 💭 We introduce some key actors of the region, their role, their story. We share about our expertise, some key achievements, local events, organisation and top opportunities. We also share some tips on how to integrate the country/region. Of course it is also the occasion the have a Q&A session. The goal: 🎯 Give the possibility to each employee to know about what the Group offers for their own potential mobility wishes or to recommend their friends. You're a T&S Group member and willing to participate? Feel free to contact me! Willing to know more about it or to share some insights about mobility? Also feel free to reach out to me, Let's make it possible #together #internalmobility #internalwebinar #share #international\n\n🌏✈️ Just returned from an enriching business trip to #China… and yes, holding the flags of two countries that are in my heart in my hand in #China 😀, and I can't stress enough the value of face-to-face meetings, especially in a post-pandemic world! 👥🤝 In a time where virtual connections have become the norm and companies tasted good flavor of low T&L cost, this trip served as a powerful reminder of the unique benefits that in-person interactions bring to fostering meaningful business relationships. 🌐🙌 China, being among the last countries to reopen, still holds a sense of intrigue and is not as frequented by travelers as it once was. 🇨🇳❤️ Immersing myself in the vibrant culture, engaging with local professionals, and witnessing their resilience firsthand left me truly inspired. The warmth and authenticity exchanged during meetings emphasized the magic that happens when we connect face-to-face. 🤩🌈 As we navigate the path towards rebuilding global networks, let's cherish the opportunity to embrace different cultures and rekindle the power of in-person connections. 🌍🌺 Let's not underestimate the impact that physical presence can have on our personal and professional growth. 🌟✨🌏 #BusinessTravel #RebuildingConnections #EmbracingCultures #GlobalNetworks #ChinaTrip #Resilience #InPersonMeetings #BeyondVirtual\n\n🌍 What a global day! Yesterday was a whirlwind of international collaboration and cultural immersion that truly highlights the magic of working in a global company. 🇨🇳Morning Workout & Cross-Country Conversation: It all began bright and early with a morning workout while engaging in a work conversation with a colleague in China. 🇸🇦Around the World in Hours: As my workday kicked off, I found myself aligning processes with a colleague in the Middle East. 🇹🇭🇱🇦Meetings with Executives in Asia: The day continued with meetings alongside Executive Directors in Thailand and Laos, where I had the privilege of facilitating discussions. Connecting across time zones and cultures, we collectively pursued our strategic goals. 🇫🇷French Apartment Challenge: An apartment visit put my French language skills to the test, showcasing the need to adapt and communicate effectively in diverse settings. 🇮🇹Conversations with my italian team: My Italian colleagues and I exchanged insights and ideas, adding yet another linguistic layer to the day's interactions. 🇧🇷Alignment with Former Leader: A valuable session involved aligning with my former leader, in Brazil. 🇺🇲🇲🇽Nighttime Global Connections: As night fell, conversations with colleagues in Dallas, USA, and audit meetings in Spanish with managers and directors from Chihuahua and Tijuana. Working in a global department is a wealth of experiences. Switching languages, understanding diverse cultures, and navigating various time zones keep us on our toes. It's a reminder of the incredible opportunities that come with this role. It's like being at the heart of a modern-day Tower of Babel, where diverse languages and cultures converge. Through it all, I've had the privilege of forging friendships with colleagues from around the globe. #GlobalProfessional #CulturalDiversity #LanguageSkills #GlobalTeamwork #InternationalCollaboration #CareerAdventure\n\nChoosing Europe as a career destination offers a unique blend of professional growth and enriching life experiences.

Last week was really fun. I ran 4 training courses, gave a keynote speech, and worked with 4 coaching clients across 9 different countries... all from the comfort of my own home. Only one of those sessions was in person here in Singapore. I know that this will probably be an unpopular perspective, but here are the reasons I love online programs and over 80% of my work is still online: ✅ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 & 𝐄𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 Pretty obvious when you don't need to fly me around the world (or fly 100s of audience members to the same venue). We're saving money and the planet at the same time. ✅ 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 (connection and networking) Although there is something special about connecting face-to-face, we can bring broader groups of participants together across different office locations to meet and network. ✅ 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 (communication and company culture) When you deliver one shared message to an entire global team at once, you can better align company values, ideologies, and skill sets that you feel are important and should be shared. ✅ 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬-𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 (sharing and understanding) Although local offices (all over the world) are becoming increasingly multicultural and multilingual, it is still good to learn from people based across the region/world and hear about their lived experiences. ✅ 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐲 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 I couldn't have traveled the world fast enough to meet with all these audiences, nor could I have physically coped with the time zones and lack of sleep (and jet lag for the week following a world tour). My clients also save time on logistical arrangements, and people are right back to work applying what they learned directly after our sessions together. ✅ 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬 Since all this work was online and I wasn't sitting in airports, I was also able to spend two days at the university attending classes and extra research seminars with visiting professors. I could fill my mind with new thoughts and ideas that I could then turn around and share (in almost real time) with my clients. What do you think? Do you prefer jet-setting around the world to deliver or attend programs, or are you happy running/attending programs online? Share your reasons in the comments! #communication #remotework #globalbusiness #unmuted"
