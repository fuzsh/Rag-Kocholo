Countries with a large distance from west to east are often devided into two or more timezones to adjust daytimes to the position of the sun. Timezones are always computed relative to UTC, the \"Universal Time Coordinated\".\n\nIn Spain, there is a time difference of one hour between the east and the west. They have a nationwide clock change from standard time to daylight saving time, where the clocks are switched forward by one hour in summer."
