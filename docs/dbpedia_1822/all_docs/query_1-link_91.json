        "text": "I packed everything I needed for 2 weeks in Europe in a carry-on. This is one of the things I do to save money when traveling. We took 4 different flights during this trip, and each had a checked baggage price of $75-$100. That’s almost $400 just for baggage…\n\nI got a lightweight carry-on luggage last year that I love, and I use packing cubes from Amazon to make the most out of the space. You might wonder how you fit all of your outfits into a carry-on, but what I do is pack a bunch of neutrals and mix and match my outfits, heavier items like sweatshirts and jackets, I will wear on the plane to save space. Check out the best bags for super organized travelers to help you pack for your trip.\n\nHere are the essential things to pack for Europe:\n\nEuropean Travel Adapter\n\nComfortable walking shoes\n\npassport & a separate copy of your passport\n\nLicense\n\nTravel Credit Card/ Cash in local currency\n\nSpace-saving travel backpack\n\nluggage locks\n\nTravel pillow and eye mask for long journeys\n\nReusable water bottle\n\nCamera and accessories\n\nHeadphones or earbuds\n\nToiletry bag\n\nWeather-appropriate clothing (layers are usually a good idea)\n\nThe Azores are known as “The Hawaii of Europe.” I was captivated by the videos I saw of this place, for it looked like a mix between Hawaii and Iceland. The Azores are made up of nine stunning islands, set in the middle of the Atlantic about 2 hours off the coast of Lisbon.\n\nI chose to go to São Miguel, which is the most populated island. Azores airlines does redeye direct flights from NYC to Ponta Delgada, which was only a 5 hour trip! Click here for what I used to book my direct flight to the Azores.\n\nSão Miguel has an array of lush greenery, volcanic craters, azure lakes, and geothermal hot springs, which attracted me due to my love for nature and hiking. My itinerary was filled with hikes through the mystical Sete Cidades crater, where twin lakes lie nestled within a dormant volcano, and relaxing dips in the therapeutic waters of Terra Nostra Park’s thermal pool.\n\nThis destination was surprisingly not very oversaturated with tourists, which we loved. We also decided to stay in a VRBO about 25 minutes north of Ponta Delgada to get more of a local feel of the island. I highly recommend this destination for those who like to travel on a budget, enjoy less touristy destinations, and have a desire to explore nature.\n\nWe landed in Ponta Delgada at 7am and picked up our rental car. Our check in to our VRBO wasn’t until 5pm, so we just popped our luggage in the back of the car, changed our clothes, and set out to the city of Ponta Delgada for breakfast.\n\nSince this is the biggest city in the Azores, you will find plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shops to explore. Michel restaurant is one you want to make a reservation for if you want some amazing Portuguese cuisine. If you are looking for budget friendly check out the Azores Forever Snack Bar for some incredible fish & chips.\n\nAfter we walked around the cobblestone streets for a while, we started driving north toward The Gorreana Tea Factory. The Gorreana Tea Factory is one of the oldest and most picturesque tea plantations in Europe. Established in 1883, it exudes a rich sense of history and tradition.\n\nYou can take a tour of the factory and learn about it’s history, or you can explore on your own for free. You must walk through the plantation, it is beautiful. They also let you try some tea for free in the café!\n\nFrom there, we were exhausted from only sleeping 2 hours so we found a stunning beach in Riberia Grande near our VRBO called Praia de Santa Barbara. There was literally not a soul in sight, and we just relaxed on our towels and enjoyed the sound of the ocean until it was time for us to check in. Near the beach is a spot called Tukatula Beach Bar where we got some great food and drinks by the water and it was the perfect ending to our day.\n\nIf you didn’t know, the Azores is one of the best spots in the world to go whale watching! So, a whale watching tour is a MUST when visiting the Azores. After doing some research I booked our tour about a month before our arrival with this Whale Watching Tour and our experience with them was INCREDIBLE. We ended up seeing 3 different whales and hundreds of species of dolphins! This tour was only a few hours, which I thought was the perfect amount of time to explore the Atlantic.\n\nTip: Wear waterproof shoes, I wore sneakers and they got soaked on the boat!\n\nAlthough Terra Azul took us to see Ilhéu de Vila Franca, (a picturesque islet located just off the coast of Vila Franco do Campo), we decided we wanted to explore it more. When we got back to the dock we went to the booth and purchased two tickets for a boat that takes us directly to the Islet. It was only 20 euros, and although the boat was packed and a little sketchy… it was totally worth it!\n\nWhat makes Ilhéu de Vila Franca so cool is it is a volcanic islet shaped like a natural swimming pool.” This pool is connected to the sea by a narrow channel, allowing seawater to flow in and out, maintaining its refreshing and clear quality. The islet is a popular destination for swimming, snorkeling, and simply enjoying the natural beauty of the Azores. My husband loves marine life so he wishes we purchased a snorkel tour, but we will just have to do it next time!\n\nYou cannot travel to the Azores without seeing Sete Ciadades (this is one of the top things that attracted me to the island.) The name “Sete Cidades” translates to “Seven Cities,” and the area is renowned for its twin lakes, Lagoa Azul (Blue Lake) and Lagoa Verde (Green Lake), which together form one of the most iconic and breathtaking landscapes in the Azores.\n\nWe started our drives from Riberia Grande, which was only about an hour. The views are breathtaking, we stopped to take pictures of the abundance of hydrangea filled roads and talk to all the cows along the way. The first viewpoint we headed to was called “Miradouro da Boca do Inferno viewpoint.” This is a a short hike that reminds me of stairway to heaven, one of the best sunrise hikes in Oahu. (that is unfortunately now shut down.)\n\nTip: Make sure you do this on your clearest day in the Azores! The views are unmatched, and I wish it wasn’t cloudy when we did it.\n\nFrom there, we headed to “Vista do Rei Viewpoint” which is right next to the “Monte Palace Hotel.” This is another incredible view of Sete Ciadades, but if you are a fan of abandoned hotels you can’t miss this one. We got some crazy drone footage from the roof of this hotel.\n\nAfter that we explored a beautiful secluded lake called “ Lagoa do Canário” then made out way to the town of Sete Ciadades for some lunch.\n\nSeeing the lake from ground level is so stunning. There were people kayaking, canoeing, and having picnics around the lake. We found a little spot on the water called Green Love, which is a little café where we got fresh cheeses and some appetizers.\n\nAlthough we explored the area on our own, you could always book a tour of Sete Ciadades to ensure you get the best experience.\n\nToday were exploring the east side of the island. Pack up your bathing suit and lets head towards miradouro da ponta do sossego viewpoint. This is a beautiful viewpoint on the end of the east side of the island which was shockingly secluded when we got there. We played with my drone and got some great pictures.\n\nWe headed towards the town of Furnas, got some coffee at a local café and walked around a bit. We headed towards Terra Nostra Park and went to this place called The Gardener for drinks and some food. This place looked expensive, but the prices were relative to America’s, so to us the “splurge” was worth it. We sat outside and just enjoyed the garden (the drinks were also super cute.)\n\nIf you eat at Terra Nostra Restaurant (directly next to The Gardener), you get free tickets into the hot springs park. We decided not to because it was a fancy restaurant, and it was not our vibe. Tickets into Terra Nostra are only 10 euros a person.\n\nThe main attraction at Terra Nostra is its large, thermal pool, filled with warm, iron-rich waters heated by volcanic activity. The water’s temperature hovers around 95-104°F. The unique reddish-brown color of the pool, due to the iron content, gives it an otherworldly appearance.\n\nAfter the pool we explored the botanical garden. This garden is filled with exotic plants, trees, and flowers from around the world. It was beautiful.\n\nWe headed back to Praia de Santa Barbara where we relaxed on the beach with our drinks, swam, and ate at Tukatula. The perfect ending to our incredible trip to the Azores.\n\nI wrote an entire blog about how to spend 24 hours in Barcelona, but I will summarize our itinerary here. We flew from PDL airport to BCN airport, only a 3-hour direct flight that was under $100!\n\nWhen we arrived we looked for the Aerobus to take us to Placa de Catalunya, since our hotel was on Las Ramblas, a great affordable hotel in the center of Barcelona called Citadines. The bus was only 10 euros, and right outside of the airport. You do not need to book this in advance, they run like every 10 minutes and you can just buy your ticket at the kiosk.\n\nWe checked into our hotel, Citadines which is a modest hotel that was about $130 a night. We loved the location and the hotel was clean and perfect for our two days. We booked through Expedia and got the lowest price I found for the location! I highly recommend staying in the Gothic Quarter, it was my favorite part of Barcelona.\n\nWe booked Park Güell tickets for 6pm so we had time to get to the hotel and check-in and it was plenty of time. We took the metro which we navigated pretty easily (apple maps helps.)\n\nPark Güell is one of the most iconic works of the renowned Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is not just a park in the traditional sense; it’s a masterpiece of modernist architecture and landscape design.\n\nWe walked around the park while the sun was setting and it was beautiful. I was surprised to see how busy it was even at that time of day. I am into history and understanding what I am looking at so I was surprised I didn’t get a brochure or see any signs that described the history of the park. If I were to do this again I would book a skip the line tour of Park Güell , because although it was beautiful to see I wish I was able to learn about it while I was there.\n\nFrom there we took the metro to Barceloneta to enjoy some paella and drinks on the beach at a restaurant called Xiringuito Escribà. I researched a great spot to get paella in Barcelona, and this one seemed like a good choice, and that it was! We got the seafood paella and a bottle of wine. Afterwards we walked around and then headed back to the Gothic Quarter explored, got drinks, and made some friends. Barcelona has a very lively night scene, if that’s your thing than this is the place to be.\n\nThere is so much to do in Barcelona, and I know that we did not have much time here so I decided to leave my itinerary lose to give myself opportunities to explore the streets, pop into restaurants, and really get a feel for life in Barcelona.\n\nFirst thing in the morning we head out to Churreria Laietana to get some churros. This is a traditional spot to get churros with the chocolate dipping sauce located right by the Barcelona cathedral. We got to watch the owner make churros right in front of us while we enjoyed an espresso and this amazing treat.\n\nAfter breakfast, we walked to the Barcelona Cathedral, there was a fair going on at the time so there was live music and a lot of people celebrating and walking around. We explored the Gothic Quarter, stopping in shops along the way.\n\nAfter walking a bit, we hopped on the metro to see La Sagrada Familia. This was the busiest place we went to in Barcelona, so buying your ticket ahead of time is a must. I suggest getting a skip the line tour because La Sagrada Família is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors each year. It was pretty incredible seeing La Sagrada Familia in person, it is massive and so beautiful.\n\nWe hopped back on the Metro to check out another one of Gaudi’s masterpieces, Casa Batlló. The roof terrace is one of Casa Batlló’s most iconic features. It is designed to resemble the back of a dragon, with its intricate scale-like tiles and a spine-like roof arch.\n\nWe walked back towards the Gothic Quarter and got a drink at Sensi Tapas, which we loved!\n\nDinner tonight was fancy, we went to 7 Portes which is an old time restaurant known for there paella located right between Barceloneta and the Gothic Quarter. This place has over 185 years of history and the paella totally lived up to it’s reputation. It was the perfect spot to end our experience in Barcelona.\n\nWe flew from Barcelona to Milan that morning which was an easy hour flight. When you land in Milan you have to get to the train station to make your way to Como. When you arrive at the airport look for the Malpenza Express Shuttle to take you to Milan Centrale Station.\n\nWhen we got to the central station, we went into the food market called Mercato Centrale that has a ton of different vendors to choose from! We were pleasantly suprised with the amount of food options there was, of-course we chose pizza and these amazing creme filled doughnuts! From there we bought out one way tickets to Como, the journey was about an hour ride.\n\nWhen you arrive in Como, it is about a 15 minute walk to the ferry where you can access the other towns in Lake Como. We were headed to Bellagio, and the fast ferry only runs every few hours, so we had 2 hours to kill where we explored Como. We boarded the fast ferry from Como to Bellagio at sunset and the ride was a dream. The ferry took about an hour to arrive in Bellagio and cost about 15 euros per person.\n\nTip: Look at the ferry schedule ahead of time so you can plan you day better than we did.\n\nOnce we arrived in Bellagio we checked into our VRBO and explored Bellagio at night. We ate dinner at a local café and of course ended the day with some gelato!\n\nWe woke up and had coffee and croissants at Bar Rossi in Bellagio by the water. Then we started walking towards Villa Melzi, a beautiful villa in Bellagio that was built in the 1800’s on 20 acres of land right on the lake. Walking around this villa and seeing the beautiful preserved gardens, intricit sculptures, and panoramic views of the lake is a must-do in Bellagio. The villa costs about 10 euros to enter.\n\nWe walked back to the ferry and bought tickets to the town of Varenna. Varenna is only a 15 minute ride from Bellagio, and a must-see town in Lake Como. When we got to Varenna, we walked through Passeggiata Degli Innamorati or “the walk of lovers” towards the town of Varenna.\n\nTip: Walk the walk of lovers at sunrise or sunset for incredible views of the lake.\n\nWe stopped at Bar II Molo for lunch, which is an amazing spot on the water! We got some aperol spritzes, bruschetta, and pastas.\n\nMy favorite day in Lake Como was when my husband and I rented out own private boat. I know its a splurge, but you cannot go to Lake Como and not spend a day out on the lake! We used a local company in Bellagio where we were able to take the boat out ourselves. You do not need a boat license to rent and drive a boat in Lake Como. I understand that might feel sketchy, so I also linked a great boat rental tour with a private driver in Lake Como that got incredible reviews.\n\nAnyways, we cruised to Lenno and saw Villa del Balbianello from the water which is the most popular villa in all of Lake Como. It was originally a monastery before being transformed into a luxurious villa in the late 18th century by Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini. I wish we got tickets to see Villa del Balbianello on foot, but we didn’t have enough time and you are not allowed to dock your boat when you don’t have a boating license.\n\nOur plan was to go to a nearby town called Tremezzo to go to a place called T-bar and Villa Carlotta (which I would still recommend based on my research) but we just felt like lounging with some drinks by the lake in Bellagio and really soaking up the last few hours we had in Italy. So we had some aperol spritzes and then got ready for dinner.\n\nToday was a great day of eating, because tonight we made a reservation for an iconic spot in Bellagio known for there pizza called La Grotta. We tried to get into this spot on other nights but it fills up so make sure you make a reservation! This was the perfect ending to our time in Lake Como, we had some incredible food, wine, and tiramisu. Lake Como was a dream, and I would definitely go back again one day.\n\nI read online, that it is not necessary to buy train tickets online in Europe, and for the most part that was true. I was mistaken when it comes to traveling from Milan to Switzerland. When we got to the station around 10am, that specific route I wanted to take was sold out. So, unfortunately our journey was going to take a little bit longer. We ended up buying a ticket from Milan to Domodossola and then to Brig from there. (our trains in Switzerland were covered under the SBB passes we pre-bought.)\n\nTip: If you are traveling from Italy to Switzerland book your ticket in advance. If you are traveling just within Switzerland or just within Italy you do not have to book a ticket in advance.\n\nWe ended up arriving to Lauterbrunnen by 5pm, the train time was almost 6 hours in total. Although, the scenery through Switzerland really made this an enjoyable ride. The tickets we bought that got us to Switzerland was $30 and then our SBB pass got us the rest of the journey for free.\n\nLauterbrunnen is just as amazing as you would expect, we walked through the town to our Airbnb and we were just amazed by the natural beauty of this mountain town. We immediately dropped our stuff at the Airbnb and went out to explore. We found a local pub for dinner that didn’t cost us an arm & a leg (which is not likely to find in Switzerland.) Then we were off to bed to prepare for a full day of exploring this beautiful country.\n\nToday we explore the neighboring towns of Lauterbrunnen. We made some coffee at the airbnb and enjoyed the mountain views as we got ready for the day. We headed to the cable car that takes you to Grütschalp (right across from the train station.) This is about a 5 minute ride, and then we hopped on the train to take us to Mürren.\n\nMürren is a Swiss car-free mountain village. Nestled high in the Bernese Oberland, Mürren boasts breathtaking panoramic views of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau mountains. We walked around, stopped in a few shops, until we reached another cable car (we just went cable-car hopping.)\n\nThis cable car too us to Gimmelwald, a picturesque Swiss village. Like Mürren, Gimmelwald is car-free and offers a serene escape in the heart of the Swiss Alps. It’s a place where time seems to stand still, and the lush green hills, charming chalets, and the majestic peaks of the Jungfrau region create a postcard-perfect setting. The beauty here is unmatched.\n\nWhen we got to first we headed to The First Cliff Walk, a thrilling cliff-side pathway, provides heart-pounding perspectives of the surrounding alpine landscapes. If you are afraid of heights, this might get your heart pumping but I promise it’s worth it! We stopped in at the First Mountain Restaurant before our hike.\n\nThis iconic area also has a ton of activities like soaring like a bird with the First Flyer zip-line or glide through the skies on the First Glider, both delivering exhilarating experiences. Hiking trails lead to gems like the Bachalpsee, a serene mountain lake framed by the rugged Bernese Alps. This trail was about 3 miles and took us about 2 hours. We got some great drone footage here too!\n\nTIP: If you want to do First Flyer, Glider, or the mountain carts book in advance! By the time we got there everything was sold out for the day.\n\nThis morning we headed towards Interlaken to explore more of the city side of Switzerland. We walked along the river, explored the shops, and watched tons of paragliders. Interlaken is one of the most popular places to paraglide.\n\nTIP: You should PARAGLIDE. If you are going to do this anywhere Switzerland is the place. If we had more than 3 days in Switzerland, I would have done this and I still regret not doing it. This paragliding experience got really great reviews.\n\nTwo popular things to do in Interlaken is take the gondola to Harder Klum, which is a viewpoint that overlooks Interlaken. You can also take a boat ride to Lake Brienz (which is free if you have the Swiss pass.)\n\nWe took a few train transfers to get from Lauterbrunnen to Zurich airport (where I left my bag on one of the trains.) Although traveling by train in Switzerland is super efficient and easy to understand, it can be stressful if you are trying to make a flight on time. You can do what I did and leave yourself ample time to get to the airport just incase you miss a transfer, or you can book a private transfer from Lauterbrunnen to Zurich to have a stress free experience that is less time consuming.\n\nOverall, our 14 day Europe trip was such a life-changing, freeing, and memorable experience. I was proud of how well I planned this trip, with only minor hiccups along the way (and I ended up getting my bag back!) If you have the chance to travel through multiple countries in Europe, you should do it. Flights within Europe are affordable and public transportation is readily available. With some research, planning, and following my travel guides you will be sure to have an incredible travel experience that gives you purpose and fulfillment on this journey that we call life."
