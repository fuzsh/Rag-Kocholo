Step into the glitz and glamor of the silver screen at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in the picturesque French Riviera town of Cannes. It’s true that you can’t attend the main festival unless you’re accredited but don’t be dejected because there are two ways to go about it – get an accreditation or watch a public screening by the beach (at 9:30pm every evening of the festival). Despite how you feel about it, Cannes 2024 will have a much lighter Hollywood presence as compared to last year (remember that time Leonardo DiCaprio, Harrison Ford, and Scarlett Johansson premiered their movies?) due to the recent writer’s strike (which led to production delays). But, BUT, Cannes 2024 will shine the light on European movies - Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest, which were each nominated for five Oscars.\n\nDon't miss: If you’re early to the venue, you can catch a glimpse of celebrities donned in their glamorous outfits, walking up the iconic red carpet stairway to the entrance of Palais des Festival.\n\nFrench Open\n\n📍 Roland Garros Stadium, Paris, France\n\n🗓️ May 20 - June 9, 2024\n\nThe prestigious tennis tournament – the French Open returns to Roland Garros, Paris.

When not this, books were my haven and through them, I travelled to places far, wide, and beyond. Until 2021! In 2021, a solo trip to Leh helped me discover a purpose to my travels - being one with nature. Somewhere between catching a surreal sunrise from the flight window to being mesmerised by a million twinkling stars in an inky black sky, I discovered the transformative power of travel. And what better way to help share these travel stories than through words, sprinkled with snippets of my own travel experiences. As a travel writer, I write about travel guides, seasonal travels, nature escapades, history & culture, and handy tips to make your travel a lot more comfortable and familiar. Presently on my travel bucket list are a Himalayan road trip and a visit to Otterberg, Germany! Until then, I’ll continue my travels through literature, storytelling, movies, and conversations."
