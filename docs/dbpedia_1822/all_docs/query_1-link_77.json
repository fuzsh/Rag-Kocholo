Best Time to Visit Europe is during the summer and it lasts from June to August. The weather during this time is just perfect for sightseeing and all the different activities that you want to undertake. Since the weather is sunny and warm, there are a number of cultural festivals and galas that are slotted for this time and many people go on a Europe tour specifically for these events. However, do remember that Europe has several countries and they won’t have the same weather at the same time. Summer in Europe might be the best time to visit but it’s also one of the most crowded times as well. There will often be throngs of tourists in popular cities like Amsterdam, Berlin and of course Paris during this time. Apart from the crowds, the other drawback is that you won’t be able to get tickets for events and tourist attractions unless you book in advance. Everything – from travel to stay – will cost more, so it’s a good idea to book your tickets, hotel and even car rentals ahead of time. You can find multiple Europe tour packages on our website for the summer months. However, Europe during the off-season has its own charms as well. Apart from the obvious advantages of cheaper flights and accommodation, there are fewer crowds too. This season is usually from April to June and September to November. However, the downside could be that there might be inclement weather and you have to be ready for it. Also, if you don’t mind cold weather, then you can even travel to Europe during the winter. After all, who doesn’t enjoy the snow and skiing among other things? However, several attractions are closed during winter, so you have to check carefully before making plans. Make sure to look for Europe tour packages for winter if you intend to go on a Europe vacation on a budget.\n\nHow to Reach Europe\n\nThe best way to reach Europe is by flight, especially if you’re travelling from India. There are direct flights from several major Indian cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad to popular destinations in Europe such as Rome, Paris, London, Berlin and Amsterdam to name a few. However, do note that there are no direct flights to countries like Denmark or Sweden. But there are numerous connecting flights that you can take which have a small stopover in Middle Eastern countries. Since summer is peak season in Europe, it’s a good idea to book your flight tickets well in advance.Once you’re in Europe, you can choose to fly to different countries on local carriers like Ryan Air or Easy Jet, but these offer the basic minimum which might not be the best when it comes to travelling in comfort or with luggage. Thanks to our exciting range of Europe tour packages, you don’t have to worry about booking flights as many of our planned trips come with the inclusion of flights as a standard feature. Besides, there are also Europe tour packages that feature optional flights, which gives you more room to make the correct pick. Another excellent option is to travel around by car, and you can visit multiple countries even in a rental car. However, you must have a license to drive in Europe. One of the best ways to get around the different countries in Europe however is by train. The Eurail connects 28 countries and offers scenic routes which are quite unforgettable. Another option is to travel by bus which is also cheaper than train travel. Bus travel is quite comfy too and most bus companies offer Wi-Fi services which make travel easier.\n\nBest Places to Visit in Europe\n\nWith forty-four countries in Europe, each having something fantastic to offer visitors, it can get quite difficult to choose where you want to go.
