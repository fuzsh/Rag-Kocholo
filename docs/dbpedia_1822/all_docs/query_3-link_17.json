EASD does not charge VAT.\n\nAll rates are indicated in Euro. The term \"Paid-up Member\" refers to a person who is recorded at the EASD Office as a paid-up member before starting the registration process and the membership has to be valid during the hybrid EASD Annual Meeting 2023.\n\nAll references to a date or a deadline, mentioned in this and other conference documents, refer to the Central European Summer Time zone (CEST).\n\nFor further details on the legal regulations, please refer to the \"Terms & Conditions\" document that you are required to accept during the registration process.\n\nGroup Registration\n\nGroup Registration applies to groups with 15 or more delegates.

The organiser will inform the attendees to that effect immediately.\n\nIn this case, the organiser cannot be held liable by the attendee for any damages, costs, or losses incurred, such as transportation, accommodation, costs for additional orders, financial losses, etc. caused by the slight negligence of the organiser, its legal representatives or vicarious agents. Apart from that, the limitation of liability remains unaffected.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the organiser will refund the registration fee but reserves the right to deduct any costs from the registration fee which have already been incurred for the organisation of the Annual Meeting and which cannot be recovered from third parties.\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nThe organiser is liable without restriction for any damage arising from loss of life, personal injury or illness caused by the organiser, its legal representatives or vicarious agents.\n\nIn the event of any other damage caused by the organiser, its legal representatives or vicarious agents, liability is limited to intentionally or grossly negligent conduct.\n\nThe above does not apply to claims relating to breaches of fundamental contract obligations. Fundamental contract obligations are those the performance of which is essential to the contract and on which the attendee may rely. In the event of a breach of fundamental contract obligations caused by the slight negligence of the organiser, its legal representatives or vicarious agents, the organiser’s liability for all damage is limited to the foreseeable damages typical of the contract."
