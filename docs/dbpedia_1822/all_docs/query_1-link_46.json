He listens and learns and if he keeps doing that, he can only get better.\"\n\nYamal and Athletic Club forward Nico Williams were two of Spain's standout players at Euro 2024. Williams scored the opener, assisted by Yamal, in Spain's 2-1 win over England in the final.\n\nWilliams, 22, has yet to make a decision regarding his future and Koundé hopes Barça can land the Spanish forward.\n\n\"Nico is a very good player,\" he said. \"He has had a great European Championship and he is very young.\n\n\"We always want to play with good players. Let's see what the club can do and if it can be done. If it gets done, I'll be delighted.\""
