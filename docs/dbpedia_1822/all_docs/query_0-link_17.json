        "text": "2 December: Pre-conference networking evening event\n\n3 December: Day of the EUROCONSTRUCT-Conference\n\nThe morning session of the conference is dedicated to the new winter forecasts towards 2027.\n\nThe afternoon session is dedicated to “Project quality, contract quality, public works quality: towards a new directive”.\n\nEuropean associations of professionals/planners, construction companies, and bidding authorities will be discussing the current rules for architectural and engineering regulations, as well as the new rules expected and envisaged with the update of EU-Directive No. 2014/24.\n\nThis event is also highly important for building material companies, as it will provide insights into upcoming regulations that will impact product standards, market accessibility, and competitive dynamics within the construction sector.\n\nThe process towards the implementation of a new European Directive concerning public works has been launched, which will consider the themes of competition, the free mark, and public interest. It is important and useful to bring together the different stakeholders of the market in order to understand and discuss trends, opportunities and critical issues of the new regulatory framework. The different European rules for public works will be analysed and compared.\n\nThe conference is organized in partnership with ACE – The Architects’ Council of Europe, and CNAPPC – The National Council of Architects, Planners, Landscape Architects, and Conservationists, with the collaboration of FIEC – European Construction Industry.\n\nAll participants at the 98th EUROCONSTRUCT-Conference are entitled to participate at the following day events.\n\n4 December: Supplementary conferences\n\nThese events are not part of the EUROCONSTRUCT-Conference but can be booked together.\n\nThe morning session, titled “Construction revolution 2030: definitions, measures, tools, technologies”, is organized by CRESME in partnership with ACE and CNAPPC, with the collaboration of FIEC and representatives of European and national institutions.\n\nThe afternoon is dedicated to the presentation of CRESME’s annual report on the Italian construction market."
