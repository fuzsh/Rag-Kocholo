With the premier of Hulu’s critically acclaimed Golden Globe and Emmy award-winning show, The Handmaid’s Tale, television entered into the Tribeca Festival last year. The Tribeca Games Festival also had its inaugural year in 2017 with the British electronics producer and multi-talented instrumentalist Mura Masa, and finally, VR (virtual reality) combined storytelling with the latest in technology. This year, Tribeca Immersive, ten days of virtual arcade featuring storyscapes where one can explore art found in the virtual world from top and emerging creators and artists. 2018’s festival will expand in all of these medias as well as the expectation to exceed last year’s record breaking record high submissions and film sales to distributors.\n\nIndividual day tickets and packages for the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival can be purchased here.
