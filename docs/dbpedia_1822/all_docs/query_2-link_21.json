Among the new offerings: Samurai Mac & Green Tea Smoothies 🍔🍵 Check out the then-and-now photo comparison below! 📸 I'm glad to share this update with many who reacted to last week's post. Samurai Mac - yes or no?

Sander\n\n🌏 Flashback to my days as an exchange student in Japan! 🇯🇵 One delightful memory was visiting a McDonald's in Tokyo when I was feeling a little homesick and wanted a taste of home. I made a delightful discovery that did make me happy to be in Japan. The menu looked quite familiar with all the usual food items, but there was one charming exception: \"Smile - 0 yen.\" 😊 I don't know why I have a photo of this visit, but as you can see from all the smiles, it didn't cost a thing. Experiencing familiar places in different parts of the world can bring surprises and insights into local culture. 🌍 Have you ever visited a fast food restaurant overseas?

There is an area there called Kokusai Mura - literally translated as International Village. My parents absolutely loved it. Although I have no memories of Lake Nojiri from my childhood, I love these photos of me with my Mom & Dad in the lake near a specific tree. I was lucky enough to visit as an adult and introduce friends to this beautiful place. And that tree hanging over the lake -- it's become a marker of my visits, appearing in photos with my parents, with friends, and finally, with me. I hope to return one day and see that tree again. 🌳✨ Do you have a special place you’ve returned to over the years? A tree, a lake, or another spot that holds a special meaning? I would love to hear your stories in the comments! 💬👇 #LakeNojiri #Japan #SummerRetreat #Community #missionarykids\n\n🌟 27 Ways to Foster Connection in a Hybrid and Global Workplace 🌍 In today's world, where hybrid work limits in-person interactions and global workplaces bring challenges like language and time zone differences, fostering unity is more crucial than ever.

Traveling to India was overwhelming for me as a young adult. The super spicy food, visible income disparities, the multitude of people and languages—it was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Instead of looking inward and examining why I felt so overwhelmed (hint: a privileged and homogeneous life), I shopped my way through the experience. Decorative brass cups, custom clothes made of beautiful fabrics, and dozens of colorful glass bangles became my way of connecting with the culture while maintaining a safe distance from my discomfort. For a long time, I felt guilty about this. But now, I see it as a step in my journey toward becoming more comfortable with differences—foods, languages, norms of behavior and more. Learning to accept and adjust to other norms is crucial as our communities and organizations grow more diverse. Willingness to look inward to understand why differences might cause discomfort is essential for growth and acceptance of people and cultures different from our own. Recognizing that differences exist, and that they are both predictable and inevitable, is an important step in becoming a WE-builder. Have you ever felt overwhelmed by cultural differences? How have you navigated them? Share your experiences in the comments—I’d love to hear your stories! #Diversity #Inclusion #CulturalAwareness #PersonalGrowth #WEbuilder\n\nWhat does the ancient Rosetta Stone have to teach us about communicating across cultures today? You may be surprised how relevant it is. I had the opportunity to see the modern cast of the Rosetta Stone at the University of Chicago Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. While the original message on the Rosetta Stone, issued by King Ptolemy V, wasn't about inclusion—it was a decree to assert the king's divine position—it effectively communicated to a wide audience by using hieroglyphs, Demotic, and Ancient Greek. This ancient strategy holds a valuable lesson for us in today's global marketplace, where professionals often work with remote colleagues who speak different first languages in different time zones. In the past year I’ve worked with colleagues around the globe who speak Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Tagalog, Bengali and much more. Here are two free strategies I use to bridge language gaps. 1. I use Google translate to write “Good Morning” on slides as a way to welcome others to virtual meetings. 2. I use YouTube to learn how to say a verbal greeting in another language when I know I will get a chance to meet someone face-to-face. Learning a word or phrase in another language or using AI translation tools to make documents more accessible are excellent examples of 21st century WE-building. What is something you do to connect across languages? Let me know in the comments. #AncientHistory #Inclusivity #Communication #GlobalWorkplace #webuilding"
