You can also, obviously, note the characteristic Mediterranean vegetation, with an abundance of pine, holm oak and cork woods, although, in El Montseny, as you gain altitude, you will also find oak, beech and fir woods. With a little luck—and patience—you will also be able to get some idea of the amount and variety of animals that roam these lands: a total of 270 species of vertebrates has been counted in El Montseny alone! Wild boars and foxes live alongside hares, dormice, lizards and birds such as the jay, the goshawk and the robin. www.els3monts.cat The Els 3 Monts (The Three Mountains) trail is divided into 6 stages: • Montseny* – Tagamanent Length: 22 km Elevation gain: 1,384 m Estimated time taken: 7 - 8 h • Tagamanent – Figaró – Sant Miquel del Fai – Sant Feliu de Codines Length: 18 km Elevation gain: 1,337 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Sant Feliu de Codines – Gallifa – Sant Llorenç Savall Length: 14 km Elevation gain: 829 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Sant Llorenç Savall – La Mola – Mura Length: 24 km Elevation gain: 1,228 m Estimated time taken: 7 - 8 h • Mura – Rellinars – Monistrol de Montserrat Length: 24 km Elevation gain: 1,089 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Monistrol de Montserrat – Montserrat Abbey Length: 3.5 km Elevation gain: 617 m Estimated time taken: 1 - 2 h *By public transport, you can reach the town of Montseny with the bus company Cingles Bus, SA, departing from the Sant Celoni Rodalies de Catalunya (Renfe) train station. If you have your own vehicle, Montseny has a car park.\n\n5. 5 NATURAL PARKS COVERING MORE THAN 100,000 HECTARES The Barcelona Provincial Council Natural Park Network is made up of 12 areas of great landscape, ecological and cultural value, each boasting unique features: Montesquiu Castle Park, Les Guilleries-Savassona Natural Area, El Montseny Natural Park, Sant Llorenç del Munt i l’Obac Natural Park, El Montnegre i el Corredor Park, Serralada Litoral Park, Serralada de Marina Park, Serra de Collserola Natural Park, El Baix Llobregat Agrarian Park, El Garraf Park, Olèrdola Park and El Foix Park. In total, more than 100,000 hectares of protected land, where you’ll find waymarked trails, information centres and documentation, museums and temporary exhibitions, hostels, youth centres and campsites. A thousand and one options to really enjoy the countryside… whilst remembering to respect it, naturally! EL MONTSENY El Montseny Natural Park has been declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. It boasts an extraordinarily diverse landscape, with vegetation typical of both the Mediterranean, with pine and holm oak, and Central Europe, with beech and fir. The cultural footprint left there by man is also noteworthy, from the Roman period (the Can Tarrés villa), through Mediaeval times (Montsoriu castle) and the numerous farmhouses (masies) spread throughout the territory. Its highest and most emblematic peaks are El Turó de l’Home (1,706 m), Les Agudes (1,705 m) and El Matagalls (1,697 m). http://parcs.diba.cat/que-es-la-xarxa http://parcs.diba.cat/web/montseny\n\n6. 6 2.THECATHARWAY A route with strong historical significance that allows you to contemplate the bewitching landscapes of the Pyrenean mountains. www.camidelsbonshomes.com The Camí dels Bons Homes or Cathar Way (75 km +) commemorates the exile of the Occitan Cathars, called the ‘Good Men’ and ‘Good Women’, who practised a pure, simple form of Christianity based on spirituality that clashed with the Catholic church of the 13th century. Today, the trail is followed by the GR-107 Long-Distance Trail, and can be covered on foot, on horseback and, for most of its stages, by mountain bike . It runs for a total of 200 km between Catalonia and France, designed to be completed in 9 stages, taking 9 or 10 days. There are three stages in the Barcelona regions covering around 75 km in total: • Queralt Shrine* – Gósol Length: 29 km Elevation gain: 1,384 m Estimated time taken: 8 - 9 h • Gósol – Bagà Length: 24 km Elevation gain: 1,720 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Bagà – Bellver de Cerdanya Length: 22 km Elevation gain: 2,181 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h **To reach the Queralt Shrine (Berga), if you use your own vehicle, you have to take the Berga Nord exit, and, once you reach the Shrine, park in the car park until your return; it’s secure and free of charge. If you come by public transport, you have three different trails to climb up from Berga to the Sanctuary: the Les Capelles, L’Obaga and the Sant Pere de Madrona trails, all taking around 50 minutes on foot.\n\n7. 7 EL BERGUEDÀ: FOR EXPERT HIKERS Three of the stages of the Cathar Way cross El Berguedà, a pre-Pyrenean region crossed by the River Llobregat that is a real paradise for hikers: if you are one yourself, you should know that it offers 1,900 kilometres of trails! The region has attractions as famous as the Pedraforca massif, El Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park and, for something completely different, the mill villages on the banks of the River Llobregat. The north of El Berguedà boasts a wealth of different landscapes: in just a few kilometres, you can move from typically Mediterranean surroundings, particularly those of its Scots pine woods, to the mountain pine woods more characteristic of highland regions. On the highest peaks, the meadows and rocks make the chamois feel right at home. The region is also well-known because, when autumn arrives, its woods become home to a certain kind of ‘hiker’ with a very specific goal: finding wild mushrooms. MOUNTAIN CAMPSITES One option popular with many nature lovers when it comes to accommodation is to go camping, thereby making the trip more sustainable. In the Barcelona regions, there is a considerable number of mountain campsites, and you’ll find no lack of them along the Cathar Way, should they be your chosen form of accommodation. www.camidelsbonshomes.com www.barcelonaesmoltmes.cat/en/web/planifica/on-dormir www.turismeberga.cat/que-fer/turisme-actiu/rutes-de-senderisme\n\n8. 8 3.SLOWBIKETRAIL–PENEDÈS360° The plain of El Penedès is perfect for discovering unhurriedly by bike. This is the idea behind the Slow Bike Trail – Penedès 360° (162 km), a circular trail in four stages that does not present any great challenges. www.penedes360.cat/en/route/slow-bike-route In El Penedès vines are obviously present along much of the way, but you’ll also see castles, chapels, monasteries, hamlets, farmhouses and dry stone constructions. The 4 stages are: • Vilafranca del Penedès* – Sant Jaume dels Domenys Length: 39 km Elevation gain: 300 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h** • Sant Jaume dels Domenys – Torrelles de Foix Length: 35 km Elevation gain: 500 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Torrelles de Foix – Sant Sadurní d’Anoia Length: 49 km Elevation gain: 500 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Sant Sadurní d’Anoia – Vilafranca del Penedès Length: 39 km Elevation gain: 600 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h *Vilafranca del Penedès, the capital of L’Alt Penedès, has good public transport links. You can get there on Rodalies de Catalunya (Renfe) railway line R4 or by road with coach companies Hispano Igualadina and Autocars Plana. **All times given are by bike.\n\n9. 9 FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS,TOO! The Slow Bike Trail has a ‘cousin’ in the same region: the Penedès 360° – MTB Trail—a bit more technical in this case—for those with a little experience, which climbs the hills of El Penedès . The route is designed to be completed in 3, 4 or 5 days and, in the latter case, covers a total of 281 km, with an elevation gain of 7,000 m. Some stages make ‘inroads’ into the El Garraf region and reach coastal towns such as Sitges. ON FOOT AMONGST THE VINES If your favourite form of transportation is not two- wheeled, and you prefer to walk, El Penedès also offers you a circular trail that, over the course of 8 stages, gives you an in-depth look at the ‘region of the vines’. It is of medium difficulty, speaking as we are of a total length of 151 km, with an elevation gain of 4,000 m. It starts from Sant Sadurní d’Anoia, and will take you through towns like Sant Pau d’Ordal, Banyeres del Penedès, Sant Martí Sarroca and Sant Quintí de Mediona. Don’t forget to take in one of the many wineries that open their doors to visitors! www.penedes360.cat/en/route/btt-%E2%80%93-mountain-bike-route www.penedes360.cat/en/route/trekking-route\n\n10. 10 4.THEBISHOPANDABBOTOLIBATRAILS The Barcelona regions of Osona and El Bages, and the Girona region of El Ripollès, play the leading role on this trail, which takes the name of a key figure in Catalan history, Bishop and Abbot Oliba. One of the great attractions of the trail (173 km +) is provided by Romanesque art . Another is its landscapes, such as the spectacular Tavertet cliffs and the Sau reservoir. It’s a route to do on foot (in fact, it follows a Long-Distance Trail, the GR-151, and its variant, the GR-151-1), and aims to be accessible to most people. That’s why two alternatives are offered in many of its sections: one goes through the town and villages, with shorter sections and more facilities, whilst the other is designed for more hardened walkers. The stages in the province of Barcelona are: • Montserrat Abbey* – Manresa Length: 24.1 km Elevation gain: 918 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Manresa – Navarcles Length: 11 km Elevation gain: 158 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Navarcles – Artés Length: 9.3 km Elevation gain: 199 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Artés – L’Estany Length: 23.2 km Elevation gain: 881 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • L’Estany – Vic Length: 20.47 km Elevation gain: 614 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Vic – Folgueroles Length: 10.7 km Elevation gain: 128 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Folgueroles – Casserres Length: 11.5 km Elevation gain: 545 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h\n\n11. 11 www.camioliba.cat/en WALK AMONGST ROMANESQUE ART The Bishop and Abbot Oliba Trails give hikers access to some of the best examples of Romanesque art to be found in the Barcelona regions. These include Santa Maria de l’Estany, with its stunning Romanesque cloister, and the Monastery of Sant Pere de Casserres, modest but chock full of history and details, set above a meander of the River Ter. Both the Manresa Regional Museum and the Vic Episcopal Museum offer a broad and rich collection of mediaeval art. STOP OFF IN VIC The porticoed Plaça Major, with the elegant buildings surrounding it and the immense central square, hosts a stunning market with mediaeval roots every Tuesday and Saturday; the Cathedral of Sant Pere Apòstol, with its Romanesque crypt and tower and murals by Josep M. Sert; the Episcopal Museum, which exhibits more than 20,000 works of Romanesque and Gothic art; the old town, the Romanesque bridge, the Roman temple… Vic is well worth a stop along the way. And when you do so, don’t forget to try the llonganissa sausage! www.camioliba.cat/en/romanesque-sites www.victurisme.cat/home?set_language=en • Casserres – Vilanova de Sau Length: 9.25 km Elevation gain: 490 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Vilanova de Sau – Tavertet Length: 10 km Elevation gain: 663 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Tavertet – L’Esquirol Length: 16 km Elevation gain: 621 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • L’Esquirol – Sant Pere de Torelló Length: 11.1 km Elevation gain: 240 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Sant Pere de Torelló – Santa Maria de Besora Length: 11.5 km Elevation gain: 842 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Santa Maria de Besora – La Farga de Bebié Length: 8.3 km Elevation gain: 330 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h *You can get to Montserrat Abbey by car, but we would recommend that you use of one the following unique forms of public transport to access the Abbey esplanade: the Cremallera rack railway and the Aeri cable car, both starting from Monistrol de Montserrat, which you can reach by train on the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat railway.\n\n12. 12 5.THELLOBREGATTRAIL A long-distance footpath (GR-270) that leads from the source of the River Llobregat, in Castellar de n’Hug, to its mouth, at El Prat de Llobregat, passing through thirty or so towns and villages. This is a trail (170 km) that has been recently restored and waymarked, with a couple of sections still to be finished off, which allows visitors to contemplate the different landscapes the river runs through: the Pyrenean countryside, the mill villages of El Berguedà, El Bages and El Baix Llobregat, and the bustling cities of the Barcelona metropolitan area. A trail that helps you understand how the River Llobregat provides the backbone for key heritage assets telling the tale of the country’s history, culture and, more particularly, its manufacturing activity. It is for good reason that the watercourse has been given the nickname of the ‘working river’! www.amb.cat/en/web/territori/espai-public/espais-fluvials/parc-riu-llobregat http://turisme.elbaixllobregat.cat/en/consorci-de-turisme\n\n13. 13 HIKING FOR FAMILIES Taking a walk in the countryside can be also be a fun activity for the family’s youngest members! Provided, of course, that you stick to paths suited to kids, that don’t require too much physical effort, and for a sensible amount of time. The Barcelona regions boast many routes that meet these requirements. If you want to walk with kids, always look for options described as ‘easy’ and make sure you know how long it will take and of any possible difficulties it may present. Don’t forget to bring water, some food, warm clothing in the colder months, a sun hat, proper footwear, sun cream and so on. And, if the walk takes in or ends up at a mediaeval castle, crosses bridges or allows you to dip your feet in the cool, clear waters of a river, then the little ones’ hiking happiness is more than guaranteed! www.barcelonaesmoltmes.cat/en/web/descobreix/tourist-routes THE SOURCES OF THE LLOBREGAT The ‘working river’ has a spectacular part, a source full of power and beauty . These are the Fonts del Llobregat, which are found at Castellar de n’Hug, a picture-postcard village whose streets are also worth strolling through. To get to the Fonts—the springs—where the water emerges, literally from inside the mountain, you don’t have to walk far: all you have to do is go up or down a few stairs (depending upon your starting point) to stand before one of Mother Nature’s great spectacles. www.ajcastellardenhug.cat/visitans\n\n14. 14 6.THEMEDITERRANEANTRAIL The GR-92—or Sender del Mediterrani (Mediterranean Trail)— (162 km +) crosses the entirety of Catalonia from north to south (or from south to north, if you prefer), always keeping as close as possible to the coast. It forms part of the E-10 (Baltic-Mediterranean) Long-Distance Trail and, in the province of Barcelona, it runs through seven Costa Barcelona regions: El Maresme, El Vallès Oriental, El Barcelonès, El Vallès Occidental, El Baix Llobregat, El Garraf and L’Alt Penedès. This makes it the perfect way to get to know many coastal towns and villages, beaches and inlets close to Barcelona, as well as a large number of natural areas, since the route crosses the El Montnegre i el Corredor, Collserola and El Garraf parks, amongst others. The stages in the province of Barcelona are: • Lloret de Mar* - Tordera Length: 17.23 km Elevation gain: 862 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Tordera – Hortsavinyà Length: 12.81 km Elevation gain: 972 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Hortsavinyà – Vallgorguina Length: 17.82 km Elevation gain: 375 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Vallgorguina – Coll de Can Bordoi Length: 14.36 km Elevation gain: 1,066 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Coll de Can Bordoi – Coll de la Font de Cera Length: 23.23 km Elevation gain: 1,676 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Coll de la Font de Cera – Montcada i Reixac Length: 16.31 km Elevation gain: 1,831 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Montcada i Reixac – Baixador de Vallvidrera Length: 17.45 km Elevation gain: 755 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Baixador de Vallvidrera – Sant Vicenç dels Horts Length: 12.83 km Elevation gain: 462 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Sant Vicenç dels Horts – Bruguers Length: 16.18 km Elevation gain: 1,318 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Bruguers – Garraf Length: 15.59 km Elevation gain: 1,477 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Garraf – Vilanova i la Geltrú Length: 21.98 km Elevation gain: 1,746 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Vilanova i la Geltrú – Calafell Length: 13 km Elevation gain: 170 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h *Bus company Sarfa has a regular connection to Lloret de Mar from Barcelona, whilst Sagalés does so from Girona. If you’re taking your own vehicle, you can reach Lloret via the coastal C-32 motorway, the AP-7 motorway and the Gi-682 road. http://senders.feec.cat/gr-92\n\n15. 15 COSTA BARCELONA TRAILS In addition to the GR-92, many other trails will allow you discover enchanting seaside spots of Costa Barcelona, the tourist designation given to the Barcelona regions closest to the sea. For example, particularly worthwhile is the coastal path that links Calella with Sant Pol de Mar, in El Maresme, and the route between the Estany del Remolar tarn and Viladecans beach, in the heart of the Llobregat Delta. Walking from Sitges to Vilanova i la Geltrú will allow you to get to know some of the few coves to be found close to Barcelona. EL GARRAF PARK One of the Parks crossed by the Mediterranean Trail and some of its variants is that of El Garraf, an area of natural interest covering more than 12,000 hectares where limestone has given rise to quite an exotic landscape, with a wealth of rock formations and an abundance of chasms. The plant life is also unique, boasting the European fan palm as its most emblematic tree. There are up to 12 waymarked trails to hike along and discover the park's every corner. http://parcs.diba.cat/web/garraf www.barcelonaesmoltmes.cat/en/web/idees-de-viatge/-/camins-arran-de-mar\n\n16. 16 7.THENATURAL PARKSTRAIL Starting and ending on the Mediterranean shore, the Natural Parks Trail (210 km), also known as the Vantage Points Trail, makes a loop inland, always some 40-50 kilometres from the city of Barcelona, crossing the protected natural areas of El Garraf, Montserrat, Sant Llorenç del Munt and l’Obac, El Montseny and El Montnegre i el Corredor. http://senders.feec.cat/gr-5 It is covered by the GR-5 Long-Distance Trail and, as you can probably imagine, given the number of natural parks and mountainous areas it crosses, there are constant climbs and descents, but it’s well worth the effort. Its stages are: • Sitges* – Olesa de Bonesvalls Length: 16.75 km Elevation gain: 1,044 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Olesa de Bonesvalls – Gelida Length: 15 km Elevation gain: 1,360 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Gelida – Can Parellada Length: 13.5 km Elevation gain: 794 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Can Parellada – Montserrat Abbey Length: 21 km Elevation gain: 2,073 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Montserrat Abbey – Rellinars Length: 12 km Elevation gain: 710 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Rellinars – Sant Llorenç Savall Length: 21.75 km Elevation gain: 2,148 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Sant Llorenç Savall – Sant Feliu de Codines Length: 13.4 km Elevation gain: 1,007 m Estimated time taken: 3 - 4 h • Sant Feliu de Codines – Aiguafreda Length: 19.36 km Elevation gain: 2,057 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h • Aiguafreda – Montseny Length: 22.22 km Elevation gain: 2,395 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Montseny – Sant Celoni Length: 21.31 km Elevation gain: 2,197 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Sant Celoni – Montnegre Length: 9.18 km Elevation gain: 729 m Estimated time taken: 2 - 3 h • Montnegre – Canet de Mar Length: 16.40 km Elevation gain: 1,651 m Estimated time taken: 4 - 5 h *Sitges has a station on Rodalies de Catalunya (Renfe) line R2, whilst bus company Monbus connects it with surrounding towns and villages and with Barcelona. Oh, and you can also reach Sitges by boat: it has three marinas!\n\n17. 17 COUNTRYSIDE FOR EVERYONE The fact of having some kind of physical, mental or sensory disability or impairment is becoming less and less of a reason not to go and enjoy one of the Barcelona regions’ natural parks. Adapted trails, tactile maps, guidance bars, Joëlettes and dossiers and files in Braille are just some of the tools you’ll find there. Toady, 6 of the trails or routes of the Natural Parks Network are fully accessible: the La Pleta botanical trail (El Garraf), SL-C 63, the Font la Portella spring trail (Sant Llorenç del Munt i l’Obac), the Font del Frare spring trail (Montseny), the Masia Mariona trail (Montseny), the Sau Nature School trail (Guilleries-Savassona) i the El Fondal path (Serra de Collserola). SANT LLORENÇ DEL MUNT I L’OBAC The Sant Llorenç del Munt massif and the Serra de l’Obac range give shape to a natural park covering 13,694 hectares, stretching across the regions of El Vallès Occidental, El Bages and El Moianès. Cliffs and monoliths of reddish conglomerate rock make this protected area unique, with El Montcau (1,056.7 m) and La Mola (1,101.9 m) as its highest peaks. Since the 11th century, the latter has been crowned by the Romanesque monastery of Sant Llorenç del Munt, declared a Cultural Asset of National Interest. Thirteen waymarked trails will give you access to the Park’s most emblematic spots. http://parcs.diba.cat/web/santllorenc http://rutesaccessibles.diba.cat\n\n18. 18 8.THEIGNATIANWAY The trail that commemorates the route taken by Ignatius of Loyola as a knight in 1522 between Loyola, in the Basque Country, and Manresa, reaches its last stages in the Barcelona regions. Igualada, Montserrat and the city of arrival—featuring the cave where tradition has it that the saint wrote his Spiritual Exercises—are some of the highlights of this trail (70 km +), one that you’ll find easy to follow thanks to the shining suns to be found along the route These are the three stages in the Barcelona regions: • Cervera* – Igualada Length: 37 km Elevation gain: 852 m Estimated time taken: 8 - 9 h • Igualada – Montserrat Length: 27 km Elevation gain: 2,249 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Montserrat – Manresa Length: 23 km Elevation gain: 1,965 m Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h *Located in the centre of Catalonia, in the far east of the province of Lleida, Cervera can be accessed from both Barcelona and Lleida by the A-2 road. By public transport, you can reach it using the bus companies Alsina Graells and Eix-Bus, and by train on Rodalies de Catalunya (Renfe) line R12. www.barcelonaesmoltmes.cat/en/web/descobreix/way-of-sant-ignatius www.caminoignaciano.org/ca/catalunya\n\n19. 19 RURAL TOURISM Recently, the amount of rural accommodation in the Barcelona regions, particularly its inland areas, has grown greatly. If you do the Ignatian Way, in L’Anoia and El Bages, through which it winds, you’ll find a broad range of options, one or more of which will surely provide what you’re looking for, since their country holiday homes range from those for large groups to those for couples, either renting the entire house or individual rooms, away from it all or in small towns and villages with vegetable gardens and farm animals, with a pool and a barbecue, gardens and wooded areas. MANRESA: SAINT IGNATIUS AND MUCH MORE To visit Manresa is to visit a capital with points of interest dating from different periods, with the Basílica de la Seu, an outstanding Gothic building, marking the skyline above the hill of Puigcardener, a range of Catalan Art Nouveau constructions such as Casa Lluvià and the Casino, and the unique street of Carrer del Balç, the narrow, winding symbol of Mediaeval Manresa. In terms of Ignatius of Loyola an obvious must-see is the Santa Cova (‘Holy Cave’), located in a natural grotto in which the saint stayed for eleven months. You’ll find a Baroque church built there, as well as the Casa d’Exercicis (Spiritual Exercise Centre), whilst the grotto is still conserved. www.barcelonaesmoltmes.cat/en/web/planifica/cases-rurals www.manresaturisme.cat/ang\n\n20. 20 9.THEBARCELONAGREENRING The Green Ring is a circular trail that crosses the large natural systems closest to the city of Barcelona. It consists of six stages: Llobregat, Montjuïc, Collserola Park, Besòs River Park, Serralada de la Marina Park and Front Marítim. This combination of natural environments and urban areas, and that fact that it encompasses a number of points of cultural, architectural, natural or tourist interest in the area surrounding the Catalan capital, makes the Green Ring a trail with many incentives to pedal along it, if that’s your thing! www.rondaverda.cat Length: 72 km Elevation gain: 794 m Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h (by bike) In this case, we’ll be describing a circuit best covered by bike, as it takes advantage of a number of bike lanes and the features of its 72 km make it perfect for two-wheeled travel.\n\n21. 21 TRAILS FOR ‘URBANITES’ If you prefer to walk, but on a city pavement rather than out in the countryside, you should know that many towns and villages in the Barcelona regions frequently programme guided tours, covering either a particular theme—e.g. Modernisme (Catalan Art Nouveau), the Baroque, the Roman period, an architect, a poet, or a historical event— or areas or buildings of particular interest. Find out more in tourist information offices. The city of Barcelona has public transport links with a large number of the province’s towns and villages, by metro or tram (in the case of those closest), and by train or bus. BARCELONA,THE GREAT CAPITAL With its 1.6 million inhabitants, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia and Spain’s second city in terms of population and economic importance. The list of things to see and do in Barcelona is enormous: museums, buildings, monuments, restaurants, streets and squares, alleys, beaches, and a thousand and one recreational activities. And, within the city limits, you’ll also find natural areas of great interest, with waymarked trails, as you’ve already seen in these pages. If you’re visiting Barcelona and are a fan of all things ‘green’, then don’t forget to take a stroll through some of its parks and gardens. http://lameva.barcelona.cat/en http://mobilitat.gencat.cat\n\n22. 22 10.THEWAYOFSAINTJAMES At the end of the last century, work began on restoring the Catalan sections of the ancient, famous Way of Saint James (99 km +). Today, you can cover on foot, on horseback or by bike the almost 500 km running from Sant Pere de Rodes or El Coll de Panissars—the Way in Catalonia has these two possible starting points—to Alcarràs. A large part of the trail is waymarked with blazes featuring the characteristic blue background and the yellow scallop shell-shaped arrows that internationally identify the Ways of Sant James and, in the Barcelona regions, the trail covers around one hundred kilometres over the following 8 stages: • Sant Esteve d’en Bas* – L’Esquirol Length: 19 km Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • L’Esquirol – Vic Length: 18 km Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Vic – L’Estany Length: 21 km Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • L’Estany – Artés Length: 23 km Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Artés – Manresa Length: 20 km Estimated time taken: 5 - 6 h • Manresa – Montserrat Length: 22 km Estimated time taken: 6 - 7 h • Montserrat – Igualada Length: 27 km Estimated time taken: 7 - 8 h • Igualada – Cervera Length: 38 km Estimated time taken: 9 - 10 h *You can get to the Vall d’en Bas by bus using the company TEISA, from both Girona and Barcelona. In your own vehicle, if you leave from Barcelona, take the AP-7 motorway to Exit 2, C-17 Parets/Vic/Puigcerdà. Continue along the C-17 towards Vic. After you pass Vic, carry on towards Ripoll and take the Manlleu/Torelló Sud exit. Take the C-37 towards Olot. Before reaching the Vall d’en Bas, you will go through the Bracons and Rubió tunnels. www.camidesantjaume.cat\n\n23. 23 ‘GASTROHIKING’ For those who love to enjoy the delicious produce of the places they pass as much as (or more than) they enjoy walking, the Barcelona stages of the Way of Saint James will allow them to fill mouth and stomach with countless delicacies. In Vic, you really have to try the llonganissa sausage (Protected Geographic Indication) and, in the region of L’Anoia, some of its native chickpeas, small and full of flavour, or the tender, delicious lamb. And, when in Castellfollit de Boix (in the El Bages region) try its famous beans, with their fine, lustrous skin. In the same region, don’t miss the tomato grown there, named ‘del Bages’ or ‘de Montserrat’. And, speaking of Montserrat, when you get there, you’ll surely find market stalls with mató fresh cheese as the star product. To wash it all down, what better than a DO Pla de Bages wine? MONTSERRAT: HOLY MOUNTAIN AND NATURAL AREA The unique outline of the mountain of Montserrat has given it, since time immemorial, the status of a symbol, an emblem for Catalans and one of great religious importance, since its abbey is home to the La Moreneta, Our Lady of Montserrat, patron saint of Catalonia. However, Montserrat has many other noteworthy virtues, and one of them is natural: despite its barren, rocky appearance, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover its rich plant life, full of subtle differences and perfect for walking through, not to mention its equally varied fauna. The Natural Park covers 3,630 hectares, and its highest peak is Sant Jeroni, at 1,236 metres above sea level. http://muntanyamontserrat.gencat.cat"
