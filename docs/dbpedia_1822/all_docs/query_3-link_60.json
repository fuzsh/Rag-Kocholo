        "text": "Wondering what the best things to do on a long weekend in Barcelona are? Well look no further!\n\nWe’ve put together a cracking 4 days in Barcelona itinerary that showcases all the best experiences this beautiful city has to offer.\n\nOne of the best cities to visit in Spain, this guide includes all the big hitters plus a few more lesser known Barcelona attractions.\n\n4 days in Barcelona is a really nice amount of time to see the main sights, build in some more authentic experiences of the city and enjoy yourself some chill time.\n\nIn this Barcelona itinerary guide you’ll also find lots of detailed information about travel costs, the best area to stay and our best Barcelona travel hacks.\n\nAn Unforgettable 4 Days in Barcelona Itinerary\n\nWe’ve put each day’s Barcelona activities in the most logistically practical order. However feel free to switch up the days up as you see fit if you fancy doing day three on day one for example.\n\nOkay let’s get you planning your trip. Here’s your unforgettable 4 Days in Barcelona itinerary.\n\n4 Days in Barcelona: Day One\n\nIf like for us, food and culture play a big part in your travel adventures, you’ll be happy with the first recommendations we are going to make for your 4 days in Barcelona.\n\nLas Ramblas\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most touristy part of Barcelona. However it is a must for any first time visit to Barcelona and there’s lots of reasons why it’s so popular.\n\nA hive of activity, Barcelona’s most famous street is lined with street performers, souvenir peddlers and market stalls.\n\nStart off at the top in Plaça de Catalunya, and work your way down the wide boulevard, taking in the thriving atmosphere.\n\nIt does get super busy at peak time, so if you’re not a fan of crowds try and go as early in in the day as possible on your 4 days in Barcelona.\n\nLa Boqueria\n\nAbout half way down Las Ramblas, you’re going to come to the best part of it, La Boqueria market. Inside here you’ll find all manner of delicacies on offer.\n\nFrom sizzling seafood platters to the best Iberico ham to pass your lips, you are bound to leave here stuffed to the brim.\n\nWith nearly 500 stalls, there’s a lot going on. To nab a seat at one of tapas bars you may need to wait a while or head in early.\n\nIt gets jam packed after around 2pm. And if there on a Barcelona long weekend, just bear in mind this indoor market is closed on Sundays.\n\nIf you’re a real foodie then squeezing in a food tour in Barcelona is a must.\n\nThis 2 hour private food tour is a tongue tingling culinary journey through local markets and neighbourhoods.\n\nYour local guide will lead you through 6 tastings including amazing local delicacies like churros and Iberian ham plus various other delicious treats.\n\nGothic Quarter\n\nNext up for your 4 days in Barcelona itinerary, it’s time to get lost amongst the gorgeous buildings of the Gothic Quarter.\n\nWinding your way through the labyrinth of tiny alleys here is one of the best ways to explore Barcelona.\n\nOf course there are a few not-to-be-missed highlights such as the Cathedral of Barcelona on Pla de la Seu and ‘Pont del Bisbe‘ or ‘Bishop’s Bridge’.\n\nAs well as the hidden spider on the corner of Carrer de Montjuïc del Bisbe, Carrer del Paradís, the magic turtle mailbox on Carrer de Santa Llúcia and Plaça Reial.\n\nThere’s a really great restaurant in the Gothic Quarter called Restaurant El Pintor. Or if you’re not so hungry but fancy a refreshment check out Els Quatre Gats, one of the oldest bars in the city. Or the equally enchanting nearby hidden fairy garden at Bosc de les Fades café.\n\nPoble Sec Barrio\n\nBefore we crack on with evening entertainment for the first day of your 4 days in Barcelona itinerary, we recommend stuffing your face with some of Barcelona’s best loved tapas food.\n\nA local twist on the Spanish classic, if you haven’t tried Pinchos before you’re in for a right treat.\n\nThey are so popular that there is a whole street dedicated to Pinchos joints in the neighbourhood of Poble Sec.\n\nOur favourite bar is called Pinchos J and is at number 26 Carrer de Blai. If you want an outside table be sure to head down before 7pm to avoiding waiting.\n\nThe Magic Fountain Show\n\nWe’re rounding off our suggestions for day one of your Barcelona 4 day trip with a bang.\n\nWithin walking distance of dinner in Poble Sec is one of the most spectacular night time sights in the city – Barcelona’s Magic Fountain Show.\n\nTo land yourself a prime viewing spot at the top in front of Palau Nacional, you need to arrive before the masses. We’d recommend at least an hour before the start.\n\nShow times vary depending on the time of year so check them here first. This is also a must Barcelona activity for kids – our nephew was mesmerised the whole time.\n\nBarcelona in 4 Days: Day Two\n\nIf one of the reasons you chose 4 days in Barcelona is to spend some time on the beach, then after a busy first day of sightseeing, day two of your 4 nights in Barcelona is the perfect time to hit it up. But lets arrive there in style.\n\nMontjuic Cable Car\n\nTo start of the second day of your Barcelona 4 day trip, we’re going to head up a huge hill. But don’t worry, you don’t have to physically climb it yourself. And the journey back down will land you on Barcelona’s most popular stretch of beach.\n\nJump on either L2 or L3 to Paral.lel metro stop and join the funicular, a mountain side railway that will take you most of the way up the hillside.\n\nThis is included in your metro journey. From here, if you want to visit the very top, it’s a short steep walk or you can take a cable car.\n\nThere’s a lovely castle at the top and some incredible views over Barceloneta port.\n\nHowever, unless you’ve managed an early start or aren’t fussed about too much beach time, we recommend just heading straight over to star of the show. Another cable car ride called Transbordador Aeri del Port.\n\nIt cruises over Barcelona’s skyline and takes you all the way down to ground level. This one doesn’t go from the top so don’t get the two cable cars mixed up.\n\nThe transbordador Aeri del Port is a short walk over to the other side of the mount from where you get off the funicular.\n\nPlaya Marbella\n\nDuring summer months, Barcelona’s main beach, Barceloneta is rammed.\n\nWhich is fine if that’s your thing, but if you’re looking for more space to lay out on your beach towel, we’d recommend heading to a stretch of beach either side of it. Our favourite is Playa Marbella.\n\nJust at the back of Marbella beach is the neighbourhood of Poblenou. Head to the main street, Rambla Poblenou, for lunch at one of the many fantastic seafood restaurants. Or alternatively eat at one of the chiringuitos (beach bars) on the sands.\n\nYou can jump on the L2 at Barceloneta metro station and hop off at Poble Nou metro station.\n\nPark Güell\n\nAn absolute must for your 4 days in Barcelona itinerary, next up on our travel agenda is Park Güell.\n\nMost things can be chopped and changed around on this things to see in Barcelona in 4 day list, but with this one it’s best to get your tickets online.\n\nBecause not only do they regularly sell out, you’ll also avoid the queues with this skip the line ticket, which can often get pretty lengthy.\n\nPhotography wise sunrise or sunset are the best time of day to visit this magnificent Gaudi masterpiece. And you can actually get in for free to see sunrise – details in our Barcelona hacks guide.\n\nBut unless you are happy to get up in the dark on your 4 nights in Barcelona, late afternoon or early evening is your best time to come here.\n\nGracia Barrio\n\nTo round off day two of your 4 days in Barcelona itinerary, it’s time to hit up our all time favourite neighbourhood in the city. Enter Gracia.\n\nAnd best of all, if you’re at Park Guell – you’re already there. Most visitors to Barcelona don’t realise that Park Guell is in Gracia.\n\nA funky little haven of cool boutique shops, trendy cafes, pretty squares and cracking bars. Plaça del Sol, Plaça Virreina or the main street of Carrer de Verdi are brilliant places to start. There are lots of great places to eat and awesome local bars in Gracia.\n\nAnd don’t forget to get with local tradition and partake in a pre dinner appetizer of Vermut.\n\nBarcelona 4 Day Trip: Day Three\n\nOkay, heading into day three of your 4 days in Barcelona, it’s time to take in some more Gaudi and see some of city parks before clapping your eyes on the single best view in the city.\n\nSagrada Familia\n\nAhh, the mighty Basilica of the Sagrada Familia. A building synonymous with Barcelona itself and something you simply have to cross off your 4 days in Barcelona itinerary.\n\nAstonishingly, construction of Antoni Gaudi’s grand design started in 1882 and is still ongoing. The latest expected completion date is 2026, although it’s changed so many times, who knows.\n\nIf you wish to venture inside, which you totally should, do yourself a favour and buy your tickets online in advance to score cheaper rates and avoid the massive queues.\n\nTickets can be bought at the kiosks just outside. But expect to queue for well over an hour at busy times and that’s only to get your entrance time slot, which could be hours later.\n\nWe’d suggest at the very least opting for one of these skip the line tickets which guarantees fast track entrance.\n\nHowever, to really make the most of this once in a lifetime experience we’d actually recommend going for a guided tour.\n\nYou’ll still get to skip the line but the guided tour with a local expert will give you a detailed insight into the history and help bring this magnificent structure to life.\n\nPasseig de Gracia\n\nOkay next up in our recommendations of what to see in Barcelona in 4 days we’re onto more of Gaudi’s otherworldly architecture in the neighbourhood of Eixample.\n\nPasseig de Gracia not only houses the city’s most prestigious designer stores, but also these magical modernisme style facades.\n\nCasa Batlló designed by Gaudi in 1900 and next door is Casa Amatller designed by Puig I Cadafalch in 1898.\n\nA little further down the same street you’ll also find Casa Mila, another of Gaudi’s works which was commissioned in 1906.\n\nIf you’re an architecture fan you may want to go inside one, and again it is better to be organised and get your tickets online in advance.\n\nOr if you’re just hankering for lunch, there are some great restaurants in Eixample. And if it’s a weekday don’t miss out on tucking into a cut price 3 course menu del dia.\n\nThere is hardly a restaurant in the city that doesn’t have them but they are often not advertised to tourists so if you aren’t offered it, ask for it.\n\nArc de Triomf & Ciutadella Park\n\nNow time for some afternoon chill time while your massive lunch digests in one of Barcelona’s most loved green spaces.\n\nThis part of the city is one of our absolute favourite places to explore in Barcelona.\n\nJump off at the Arc de Triomf metro station and wander through the grand Arc de Triomf and down the seriously pretty Passeig de Lluís Companys.\n\nCross over the road at the bottom and you’ll land in Ciutadella Park. Bring a blanket to sit down or simply wander around to your heart’s content.\n\nBut be sure not to miss the fabulous Cascada Monumental and the huge elephant. You’ll also find the Parlament de Catalunya buildings in the grounds too.\n\nBunkers del Carmel\n\nWe’re seriously pulling no punches with this 4 days in Barcelona itinerary and sharing all of our favorite things to do in the city.\n\nIt’s time to head up another of Barcelona’s hill for the best sunset view in the entire city. Another good one for sunset, it takes a little effort to get there so make sure you allow yourself enough time and don’t miss it.\n\nYou can follow this detailed guide on how to get to the Barcelona bunkers. Grab some beers and some snacks to take up with you.\n\nAnd if you are cursing us on the way up, trust us, this will be one of your best memories of your 4 nights in Barcelona.\n\n4 Nights in Barcelona: Day Four\n\nOkay last day and what an adventure we have to recommend for today. It’s time to get up high again to see another famous landmark of the city up close before settling into some of Barcelona’s best cocktail bars for your last night of your Barcelona 4 day trip.\n\nTibidabo\n\nSitting atop Barcelona’s tallest peak, The Tibidabo Cathedral del Sagrat Cor can be seen from just about anywhere in the city.\n\nA trip to the summit of Mount Tibidabo is fantastic way of rounding off an unforgettable 4 days in Barcelona itinerary.\n\nYou can go into the mighty church for free and even climb right to the top for a small fee.\n\nThe views are insane and you literally can’t get any higher during your Barcelona 4 day trip – with your feet still on the ground at least.\n\nAnd if that isn’t enough fun for you, there’s a whole amusement park up there.\n\nIf you’re a serious funfair fan, you may opt for going into the full park. But there are plenty of favourites, such as a carousel and ferris wheel you can go on without a ticket to the big park so to speak.\n\nGetting up there is also part of the adventure and you have a couple of different options.\n\nYou can either hike up – yes it’s possible, we’ve done it. Or you can take a tram part way up and then a funicular up the rest of the Tibidabo mountain side.\n\nIt’s great fun for anyone but especially if you have little ones with you. There’s a splash pad style water section that our nephew went wild for, cooling off in the summer sun.\n\nA couple of (overpriced) eateries are available up there, but the best option is to take lunch with you and enjoy it in the picnic area.\n\nFind lots of useful money saving travel tips here for your 4 days in Barcelona.\n\nEl Born\n\nWe’re suggesting you round off the last day of your 4 days in Barcelona in style with a trip to the trendiest neighbourhood in Barcelona, El Born.\n\nIt’s right next to the Gothic Quarter but has a completely different feel to it.\n\nMake your way to the main street, Passeig del Born, lined with the cutest boutique shops and coolest bars to take in the atmosphere of this delightful area of Barcelona.\n\nIf you are down for a cocktail or three, you’ll find the most talented mixologists in the city in these parts.\n\nOur favourite by a long shot is a hidden from view spot called Paradiso Cocktails that is tucked away in the back of a Pastrami sandwich shop. Yes really!\n\nAs one of the most on fleek bars in Barcelona, it does get busy though so head there early evening to avoid any disappointment.\n\nMore Barcelona Places of Interest\n\nOur suggestions so far for your 4 days in Barcelona should mean you have a pretty action packed itinerary.\n\nHowever if you have space for more Barcelona activities or simply want to switch a few out, here’s some more fun things to see in Barcelona in 4 days.\n\nCamp Nou: Easy to reach on the metro, if you like your footy, a trip to the largest stadium and home stadium of FC Barcelona may be right up your street. We’d recommend booking tickets in advance.\n\nMaze of Parc del Laberint d’Horta: A hidden gem on Barcelona’s sightseeing scene, this gorgeous park and outdoor maze is a little tricky to get to. But your efforts will be rewarded.\n\nSant Antoni Flea Market: Looking for a bargain or some unusual souvenirs, this is your stop. Everything from old vacuum cleaners to vintage clothing is on offer here.\n\nMontjuic Outdoor Cinema: The perfect addition for a romantic 4 days in Barcelona itinerary. In the summer months book yourself a ticket to see a classic film atop Mount Montjuic.\n\nExplore Ravel Barrio: Known as one of Barcelona’s grittier neighbourhoods, this area is perfectly safe to explore if you want to step away from the tourists or are looking for a more ethnic restaurant.\n\nCarretera de les Aigues hike: If you fancy getting out into nature as you explore Barcelona on foot, this 9km footpath cutting across mount Tibidabo might just be the ticket.\n\nWhere To Stay In Barcelona\n\nMost first time visitors to Barcelona, choose to stay as close to the most popular part of the city as possible, Las Ramblas.\n\nBut when you are searching for accommodation for your Barcelona 4 day trip you’ll get more for your money if you branch out a little.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Gracia is our top suggestion. Simply because you’re close enough to all the action but also able to enjoy a more authentic side to the city aside from the obvious tourist hotspots.\n\nIt’s full of independent bars, restaurants, and designer boutiques, and feels like a separate village within the city.\n\nIts long, narrow streets are lined with trees and there are lots of cool squares to chill out in.\n\nIt neighbours the El Carmel district where the bunkers are and is totally possible to walk to them from.\n\nIt’s also where you’ll find Park Guell, is close to La Sagrada Familia, and just a short metro ride or 20-30 minute walk from the centre of town.\n\nIn our opinion it’s by far the best area to stay in Barcelona.\n\nBear in mind that the best budget accommodation in Barcelona gets booked up well in advance. So to avoid disappointment get your reservations made ASAP.\n\nBest Places To Stay In Barcelona\n\nHere are our top recommendations for where to stay in the Gracia neighbourhood:\n\nAffordable Luxury: Hotel Barcelona 1882 is just a stone’s throw from the Sagrada Familia. And from its roof terrace you’ll get stunning views of this beautiful building. There’s also an incredible rooftop pool and bar up there for relaxing in the evenings.\n\nThe spacious rooms are soundproof and come equipped with flat screen TVs, air con, and everything else you’d expect from a 4* hotel. Rooms come with large windows meaning they’re extremely bright and sunny, with some even boasting panoramic vies of the city.\n\nMidrange: Hotel BestPrice Gracia‘s name sums it up nicely. You won’t find a better priced, more comfortable hotel in the area, particularly not when you consider how nice it is.\n\nSimply and tastefully decorated, rooms here come with everything you need to relax after a day of sightseeing. Air con, flat screen TVs with satellite, private bathrooms with free toiletries and hairdryers come as standard.\n\nCheap & Cheerful: Sant Jordi Gracia is a modern, stylish hostel with a trendy vibe. Dorms are air conditioned and everywhere is impeccably clean.\n\nThere are also lots of cool areas to hang out and meet fellow travellers. These include a rooftop terrace, the shared kitchen and a big common room.\n\nGetting Around Barcelona\n\nPlan ahead for your unforgettable 4 days in Barcelona and get yourself a Hola Barcelona Travel Card. Then you don’t need to faff about sorting out a travel card when you get there.\n\nNot only does it cover you for unlimited travel on the metro, buses, trams and trains it also includes a return airport journey.\n\nSimply choose the 4 day option and the number of tickets you need. It will save you a tonne of money and give you complete freedom for the duration of your visit.\n\nEssential Barcelona Tips\n\nHere’s a few helpful Barcelona travel hacks to help you plan your 4 days in Barcelona and make the most of this enigmatic city during your trip.\n\nBarcelona Currency\n\nBarcelona’s currency is Euros. There are plenty of cashpoints and currency exchange places dotted around the city. And debit or credit cards are also accepted in the vast majority of shops, bars and restaurants.\n\nBarcelona Power Sockets\n\nThe mains voltage in Barcelona is 220 volts with 2 pin plug sockets, equal to the rest of Europe.\n\nIf you are travelling from the UK or outside of Europe you will need an adaptor and US travellers should verify their appliances support 220 volts.\n\nWe carry one of these universal travel adaptors wherever we go. They’re lightweight, durable and mean we can charge our gadgets anywhere in the world.\n\nBarcelona Internet\n\nMost bars, cafes and restaurants have wifi. But if you’re wanting online access while you’re out an about, the best option is to get yourself an eSim.\n\nBarcelona Water\n\nThe tap water in Barcelona is totally safe to drink and there are public water fountains all over the city. There’s a really useful location app you can use to always find the nearest one to you.\n\nBut if for whatever reason you don’t want to drink straight from the tap, don’t pollute the world with more single use plastic. Order yourself a filter water bottle before you jet off for your 4 nights in Barcelona.\n\nWe highly recommend these GRAYL Geopress bottles which filter out over 99.99% of nasties that you can find in water including bacteria, viruses, chemicals and heavy metals.\n\nBarcelona Language\n\nBarcelona sits in the Catalonia region of Spain and the official language is therefore Catalan, not Spanish. It’s kind of a mixture between French and Spanish so you may recognise some words but, it’s very different to Spanish.\n\nBut don’t worry if your Catalan isn’t up to scratch. Everyone also speaks Spanish and most restaurants have menus in Catalan, Spanish and English usually. Lots of people working in services around the main tourist hubs will also speak at least some English.\n\nBarcelona Safety Tips\n\nNo different to any other major city, Barcelona is busy. There are crowds and with this comes opportunistic petty thefts.\n\nWe unfortunately witnessed more people than we would have liked to getting things stolen.\n\nHowever all of them could have been avoided so there’s no need to be overly concerned. Just look after your things, have them attached to you and don’t let them out of sight.\n\nThieves will always choose the easiest option. So if you leave your stuff unattended on the beach or under the table in a restaurant, you’re an easy target.\n\nDon’t put anything in your back pockets. When in crowded areas such as the metro or when stood in a queue, secure stuff in front pockets with your hands and keep your bag in front of you.\n\nIf we can be of any further assistance in helping you plan what to do in Barcelona for 4 days, hit us up in the comments.
