        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo as you probably can tell from the title, I am a teenager, and my parents have put down a deposit for Oceania's \"Greek Isles\" Cruise next year. I have read as many threads as I can find about kids on Oceania Cruises, and the only thing I have really found is that they are not meant for people my age. When I think of a cruise, I think of a fun, loud, and exciting atmosphere. This cruise that we will be doing seems to cater to an older crowd, which (hate to be rude) is not exactly my idea of a fun time. I am interested in the places that this cruise will be going, but a huge part of the experience for me is the time on board. You can probably imagine that I am less than excited about the lack of fun teen activities on board. Usually I am ok hanging out with an older crowd, but knowing me, I will be bored to tears if I had to attend some lecture and not see anyone my own age.\n\nMy (probably not so great) approach to this problem was recommending other cruise lines (for example, Royal Caribbean and NCL) that are more family-friendly and are better suited for teens. I found itineraries for these cruises that would almost match the one we'd be doing on Rivera, and I even wrote my parents a 5-page essay on why I think that this choice would be right for our family (I'm an only child by the way). In this I did address the $750 deposit fee. Since the other cruises that I found would be cheaper, it could even itself out. If they didn't like this, I even offered to help pay some of it off. Well, my mom was not too happy with me for suggesting going on another cruise. I really don't want to seem ungrateful, but I just feel she doesn't understand that I will not have fun on the trip. :(\n\nAnyways, my question for you all is: do you think I should just do the cruise? Do any of y'all have tips on how to maybe convince parents to not go? I know I sound like a pompous brat; that was not my intention. Also, sorry if this is the wrong forum! I'm new here and I had no idea where to post this. If any of you Oceania-travellers could give me some insight of teens/kids on board, that would be much appreciated. Anything would be useful!\n\nThank you so much everyone\n\nI don't think you're being a brat at all. You have read posts here and have a realistic understanding of what you MAY see on this trip. If your cruise were in the Caribbean you'd probably have better luck meeting others your age. If you think \"loud and noisy\" for a cruise, Oceania will definitely not be a good fit for YOU even if your parents may love it.\n\nLyn suggested talking to your parents but it sounds like a 5 page letter should have made your feelings clear!\n\nHow about printing out some of the threads on this subject so your parents might better understand why you would rather be on another line? It seems to me that this is supposed to be your vacation as well, and come compromises may be in order. (I can also understand why your parents aren't happy at your unhappiness with an expense trip with them!)\n\nIf your cruise is port intensive -- meaning few if any sea days -- then the life on board won't be so crucial to your enjoyment. You'll be busy seeing the ports themselves.\n\nGood luck on resolving this! If you end up on Oceania, try to make the best of it ... it won't last forever! And you just might have a good time.\n\nMura\n\nHi again! Thank you both for your helpful comments. I am going to have a discussion with my parents later but I've been reading over our itinerary more and I think that I will have more fun than I originally thought. Who knows, I probably need the relaxation time anyways.\n\nAlso, I have just reread my discussion and I just want to add that I did not mean to sound so cynical. I think that I was just a bit annoyed that I wasn't included in on the planning process. As to all Oceania frequenters, I wasn't intending to bash the cruise line. If you were to catch me in 20-30 years, I bet I'd love all the activities. Anyways, I am becoming more optimistic about the cruise and am actually starting to get excited (even though it is still over a year away :rolleyes:). After all, if you think about it, the cruise is just a nicer form of transportation, haha.\n\nMoonhearts -\n\nWhen I was 18 I chose not to go on an escorted trip to Europe with my parents because I also thought it would be just older people I wouldn't have anything in common with. I greatly regret that now and wish I would have taken a (free) opportunity to travel to new places and experience things I had never done before.\n\nYou seem quite mature and thoughtful for your age. I really believe that if you look at the ports, you will be able to find many things that capture your interest and perhaps some activities geared towards teenagers. You can also use this cruise as an opportunity to get to know yourself and an older generation (or generations) and ask them about their life - I feel like with your positive and curious attitude you will have a great time. And the Greek Islands are insanely gorgeous - if nothing else you will have some Instagram photos that will make your friends jealous!\n\nWe took our 16 year old son on a transatlantic cruise from Iceland to New York last summer. He had a great time. We researched the ports in advance to find tours that would be more active than those offered by the cruise line - e.g. kayaking and a small boat trip out to hike on the ice cap in Greenland. We did know in advance that Oceania doesn't offer kids club/kids activities. He found plenty to do and made friends of all ages around the ship. We got to know the entertainers well during the daily O points activities (ping pong, shuffleboard, etc.).\n\nTwo summers ago I took an Oceania cruise through the Greek Isles. The ports of call were fascinating as they are ports that you won't get to see from the larger ships. Try to look at this as 2 weeks of a completely different experience. On the Greek Isles cruise, you likely won't have more than a day at sea. These are very port intensive cruises. It has the potential to be a great experience for you. Perhaps you can talk with your parents about cruising on a larger ship next year or the year after.\n\nMoonhearts, I suspect your parents have a reason for choosing Oceania. I'm not sure what your age is, as \"teen\" covers a wide range. I have 4 teens myself, 13-19. While we definitely try to include locations and activities that the kids will like, but ultimately, I'm the one paying for the vacation so I choose. As my oldest, now in college, have found out, they don't even always get to go with us and that living on their own costs money. At this point, they'd go just about anywhere, on any line, for the \"free\" vacation we'd provide and the chance to have family time.\n\nI've also found that for the kids (and even adults) it is usually a conscious choice to \"have fun\" where we go. If one of them has decided it won't be fun, then it probably won't be. If they decide to focus on the good points, they have a blast.\n\nI'm assuming your parents enjoy traveling with you. Again, not knowing your age, there may be limited time for them to spend time with you. Enjoy the time now, no matter what line you are on. If you are worried about what to do in your down time, make sure to bring something to keep you busy - my kids bring everything from board games, books, a Nintendo Switch, etc. FWIW, we play a lot of board games as a family on cruises/vacations. Many games pack up pretty small when you get rid of the packaging.\n\nI think you are absolutely correct in thinking that an RCI or NCL cruise would suit you better.\n\nHave you tried pointing out to your parents that they themselves will be very much younger than the other guests who may well be mostly over 70? I am guessing that your parents may only be in their forties?\n\nHowever, to look on the bright side, if you end up on Oceania, if it is in July or August, then there may actually be some families on board, so you might find a few other teenagers to hang out with.\n\nIf all else fails, then indeed just look on it as transport to exciting destinations. If it is port intensive, then really, that is what it will be. Even teens get exhausted on hot, all-day excursions, so you will probably be glad to just eat, watch the show and then collapse into bed at night!\n\nSent from my iPad using Forums\n\nMoonhearts: Here are a few ideas. First have that conversation with your folks. If you go, focus on the ports and the experience on land. Do some on-line research about what you might find and the things that fit your interests and then dig in, learn & enjoy. The fitness center on board is very good, so if you exercise, you can spend time there. Folks like to dance in the bar up on top at night, and some of the entertainers hang out there, so you can dance and have some fun with them. Bring some of your hobbies on board so you have stuff to do. The internet band width on Oceania is not bad (at least compared to other cruise lines), so you can stay connected to your BFFs. Why not write a blog about your travels? Do something cool and inventive. The food will be great, the people will be friendly (although old), so you might make the best of it and have a great time. But admittedly, you will not find many (if any) teens on board.\n\nMoonhearts. As you can tell everyone feels for you. I am 49 going on my first O cruise and I am concerned about ages so I can imagine your pain... I have a 17 yr old daughter who would probably be posting your post if she was coming(its our 25th anniversary so she isn't invited:) So here are my positives.\n\n1. Its a free holiday. It will be hot and the soft drinks will probably be free too.\n\n2. Its Greece. Maybe you have seen the Grecians?? That could be a plus?\n\n3. We can learn from everything that happens to us. We can either take all the good points or find all the bad points. It is our choice.\n\n4. Chances are, there will be some other teens who feel they are lost in a sea of grey! You will be their beacon, as they will be yours.\n\n5. A few years ago I joined a property club. I saw a couple who had joined who were much older than me and I had a lot of pre conceived ideas and thoughts. In particular, I didn't think we would have anything in common. Then one night they sat next to me during a meal. Probably the most interesting people I have ever met.. Again, reminded me that life is what WE make it.\n\n6. Well, I don't think I have a 6 but to summarise, this is a GREEK cruise, its free, you will find someone your age and if not, its a FREE GREEK cruise.\n\nI know, some of this was tongue in cheek, but, if you don't manage to persuade the oldie to change their plans, just remember my words of wisdom. Dash, what were they? Oh yes! Everything we do, changes us. We choose whether it is for the better or worse.\n\nDamn, you are going on a luxury Greek Island cruise, you will LOVE it..\n\nM\n\nPS. Let us know how you get on?\n\nHarryspotter is spot on. International travel at your age is an advantage and privilege that can broaden knowledge and perspective. My parents \"forced\" me to travel with them with a tour group where I was the only teen. My father's stern advice was to be polite and speak respectfully to everyone. He also suggested I formulate 5 questions to draw from that would engage people in conversation as well as steer the subject towards something that I might find interesting. (Nothing that requires just Yes or No. \"Where is the one place you would like to visit again?\" \"Where is the one place you would never want to go?\") I took his advice and it was one of the best trips of my life. I gained new respect for adults, their views, and experiences.\n\nBut there was another unforeseen outcome. Those simple questions and contacts caused the others to give me the \"princess\" treatment. And years later most of those new friends gave the best wedding gifts!\n\nYou also have an opportunity on a cruise. The musicians/performers are usually college-age. They most likely would enjoy some youthful conversation. May be a chance for you to formulate a college visit list."
