        "text": "Visiting Europe in March might be the best time to visit the old continent! This wonderful month of the year has warmer weather, fewer crowds and great travel deals since it’s the shoulder season. Visiting European cities in March will make your trip more authentic and relaxed. You could be visiting a town square with its rich history and warm weather in any of these European destinations. From the historic wonders of Rome to the coastal beauty of Barcelona, let's explore the treasures waiting to be discovered in Southern Europe this March. The blog also features Eastern European cities to visit in March, where medieval architecture meets modern vitality. So, are you ready to find the springtime charm of many European countries?\n\nI asked other travel friends to share with you what in their opinion are the Best European cities to visit in March. We have collected 30 trip ideas and travel tips!\n\nPsst: If you are wondering how to maximize your vacation days for Spring break, you can head to my Plan from the Office section.\n\nHere is the list to help you decide where to go on your next trip!\n\nItaly\n\nLecco in Lake Como\n\nby Jill from Jill on Journey\n\nI've visited numerous cities in Europe – from Sweden all the way down to Greece. Yet, my heart still skips a beat thinking about a gem tucked at the foot of the Alps: the small city of Lecco at Lake Como.\n\nLecco is the perfect place to travel to in spring, as the temperatures are mild at around 15 - 18 °C and the days are sunny. In March, the stunning landscape around the lake awakens from its winter break. The flowers start to bloom again, and the Italians start going out more and more, chatting in lakeside cafés.\n\nIt's a picturesque small city with a beautiful lakeside promenade. Next to its famous neighbors such as Bellagio and Varenna, Lecco is where you can experience the authentic side of beautiful Lake Como.\n\nIt is also where the Milanese love to spend their weekends to escape the busy city. In Lecco, you can enjoy the Italian Dolce Vita lifestyle, sipping a Spritz by the shimmering water.\n\nBesides, from Lecco, you can take beautiful boat trips across the lake, go hiking with incredible lake views, and have the best Italian food. I've been to Lecco many times and at any time throughout the year. What is especially beautiful in March are the villas with their stunning parks next to the lake. So they are definitely worth a day trip by boat.\n\nIn March, you'll find the lake awaiting you with pleasant spring temperatures and lots of sunshine. You will fall in love with it for sure.\n\nLake Como\n\nby Joanna from the World in My Pocket\n\nLake Como makes a fantastic visit in March, especially because the weather starts to get better after the cold winter, but the area is not yet too crowded. One of the nicest places to see on Lake Como is Bellagio.\n\nBellagio is located on one of the tips of the lake and is not connected by train to major cities. The way to get to Bellagio is to take a train from Milano to Varenna, and then the ferry from Varenna to Bellagio. This is why it is recommended to spend the night here, to enjoy the town without the day trippers.\n\nThere are plenty of things to do in Bellagio, starting with a private tour of the exquisite gardens of Villa Serbelloni. This villa is a luxury hotel open only to guests, but the gardens can be visited via a private tour booked in advance. The gardens open in mid-March.\n\nAnother beautiful villa that you can stroll around is Melzi. You can explore the grounds at your own pace, as the ticket is valid for the entire day, so you can go and come back as well.\n\nStrolling around Bellagio is an attraction in itself. The town is so pretty, with so many beautiful corners. One of the best viewpoints is Salita Serbelloni, which sees a steep street going down towards the lake, with a beautiful background of the mountains.\n\nThe weather in Bellagio in March is average, with an average of 12-14 degrees Celsius during the day. There are around 7 days of rain in March, which, it happens, makes the atmosphere a bit more mysterious.\n\nLugano\n\nby Linda from Hiking the Alps\n\nOne of the best European cities to visit in March is Lugano.\n\nThe beautiful city in the Swiss canton of Ticino is picturesquely situated on Lake Lugano, only 25 km away from the Italian border. While it is still wet, cold and ugly in most of Europe, Lugano scores with already warm temperatures. At night, temperatures drop to an average of 4 degrees and during the day it is spring-like warm at a pleasant 13 degrees. Swimming in the blue shimmering Lake Lugano at about 11 degrees is not yet recommended, but you can make great trips with the regular ferries, exploring the charming fishing villages such as Morcote or Grandia along the shores.\n\nEven if there are no special major events in Lugano in March, the historic city and its beautiful surroundings are still worth visiting. Within the narrow streets of the old town, it is great to stroll and enjoy the warm spring sun in one of the many small cafes between the historic houses or along the popular lakeside promenade.\n\nIn addition, you should make an excursion to Lugano's local mountains. Both, Monte Brè in the east of Lugano and Monte San Salvatore in the southwest of the city center, offer a dreamlike view of Lugano, Lake Lugano and the snowy Alps in the background. Both mountain tops can be reached by beautiful, easy hikes or by funiculars from the city center.\n\nSo, if you want to experience early spring coupled with Italian dolce vita in Switzerland, you should come to Lugano, one of the best European cities to visit in March.\n\nRome\n\nBy Jiayi of The Diary of a Nomad\n\nIf you’re looking for a historic, romantic, and cultural city to visit in March, definitely consider Rome. Spring is shoulder season in Rome, which means you’ll get to enjoy splendid weather while also dodging the massive tourist crowds of the summer. Average temperatures are between 6 and 16 C on average during this month.\n\nSpend at least 2 days in Rome exploring some of the most famous sites in Italy. Don’t miss the iconic Colosseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps. Of course, no visit to Rome would be complete without getting a glimpse of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Museums or climbing to the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nAfter all the sightseeing, spend some time unwinding in Villa Borghese, a big stunning park in the center of Rome. It’s also home to the Galleria Borghese, which is a haven for art history lovers! Another amazing place for art is Piazza Navona. During the day, artists set up their stands there, and you can watch them paint or draw caricatures of tourists live.\n\nDon’t miss Trastevere for some of the best food in town. This picture-perfect neighborhood also has fewer tourists than the historic center. Be sure to stop by Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere in this neighborhood - you’ll be impressed by how gorgeous the church is!\n\nEvery year in March, the Roma Music Festival also takes place. Organized by MRF Music Festival, this event features many talented choirs. What better way to enjoy this historical city, than with a bit of music?\n\nPsst: Rome don’t forget to check BRB Rome one day itinerary.\n\nVenice\n\nby Samantha Wragg from Coco Travels\n\nVenice is a great destination to visit in March. Unlike the summer months, spring is much quieter, so you won’t be fighting your way through throngs of tourists on the city’s narrow cobbled streets. You’ll also experience shorter queues at some of Venice’s main tourist attractions like St Mark’s Basilica and the Doge’s Palace.\n\nThe weather in Venice in March is usually sunny and mild, which means you can get some amazing views (and photographs) of the famous bridges and canals. The temperatures aren’t too hot, which makes for ideal conditions for walking around the city and exploring. As the days are starting to get longer, there’s more time to enjoy the city while it’s light.\n\nBecause the days are usually clear, it’s a fantastic time to take a boat trip to one of the famous Venetian islands, Murano, Burano or Torcello, or visit all three. You can discover the art of glass blowing in Murano or take pictures of the colourful fisherman’s houses in Burano.\n\nTorcello is known for its Byzantine mosaics and ancient architecture. Much of this sparsely populated island is a nature reserve which is only accessible by walking trails. Again, during summer the island is very busy with tourists but in March, you’ll find it’s a lot quieter.\n\nIf Easter falls in March, then there are plenty of religious celebrations to observe or take part in Venice. There’s the Holy Mass at St Mark’s Basilica on Palm Sunday and there’s a procession from Campo Santa Maria Formosa to get there.\n\nCinque Terre\n\nby Shar of Sightseeing Shar\n\nCinque Terre is a collection of five small villages on the Italian Riviera: Monterroso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riommagiore. Perched on rugged cliffs overlooking the coastline, these colorful villages have become a popular tourist destination. Though most tourists visit Cinque Terre in the Summer, Spring is truly the best time to plan your trip!\n\nMarch marks the beginning of the Spring season. The weather is mild and sunny compared to the scorching sun that tourists face in the Summer. Many Italian accommodations also lack air conditioning, making Spring a more comfortable time to visit. Visitors can take leisurely walks along the narrow streets of the towns, enjoying the stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea and the colorful buildings that make up the region's unique architecture. The flowers are also in full bloom, adding to the beauty of the vineyards and hiking trails.\n\nMoreover, March is the month of many festivals and cultural celebrations in Cinque Terre. The Feast of San Giuseppe, the patron saint of Corniglia, is celebrated on March 19 with processions, parades, and fireworks. Visitors can enjoy local bands, traditional costumes, and delicious food!\n\nAnother reason to visit Cinque Terre during spring is to take advantage of the lower tourist traffic. The area can get quite crowded during the summer, but visitors can enjoy a more relaxing experience in the spring. This also means that accommodation rates are lower, making it an affordable option for budget-conscious travelers.\n\nOverall, visiting Cinque Terre in the spring season is a must for anyone looking to enjoy a picturesque destination with mild weather, delicious food, and unique cultural events!\n\nAmalfi Coast\n\nBy Merryl from Merryl Travel and Tricks\n\nA breathtakingly beautiful European destination to visit in March is the Amalfi Coast. Located in southern Italy, it boasts stunning landscapes, picturesque towns, and gorgeous beaches. The best part of visiting the Amalfi Coast in March is that you get to avoid all the crowds. This means that you can enjoy its beauty and charm without battling the crowds, as you would have to during the summer months.\n\nIn March, the average temperature on the Amalfi Coast ranges from 10°C to 16°C, making it perfect for outdoor activities such as hiking and sightseeing. It is also the month of the Festival of Sant'Andrea, the patron saint of Amalfi. This festival is celebrated with parades, fireworks, and various cultural events, making it a great time to experience the local culture and traditions.\n\nDuring your trip to the Amalfi Coast in March, make sure to visit some of the prettiest towns on the Amalfi Coast, such as Positano, Ravello, and Amalfi. You can take leisurely strolls along the narrow streets, enjoy the stunning views from the cliff-top terraces, and sample the delicious local cuisine. You could also hike the Path of the Gods for perfect views of the coastline.\n\nIn conclusion, the Amalfi Coast is a stunning destination that is worth visiting in March. With its mild weather, cultural events, and stunning natural beauty, you won't be disappointed. Whether you're looking for a relaxing holiday or an adventurous one, the Amalfi Coast has something for everyone.\n\nPsst: Bologna is also another great Italian city to visit!\n\nPuglia\n\nby Ingrid from Ingrid Zen Moments\n\nVisiting Puglia in March is an experience like no other. From the rolling hills of the Gargano to the white-washed villages of Salento, there’s something for everyone.

You can also hire a traditional Maltese boat from the nearby pier to explore the historic forts and churches of the Three Cities.\n\nFrom Valletta, you can take a day trip to the stunning Blue Lagoons - a tropical beach paradise on the island of Comino. Historic lovers will enjoy a day trip to the atmospheric walled city of Mdina, also known as the silent city and the neighbouring town of Rabat.\n\nCroatia\n\nDubrovnik\n\nby Becki from Meet Me In Departures\n\nIf you're looking to escape to a European destination in March, then Dubrovnik in Croatia should be on your radar.\n\nMarch is a great time to visit. Whether you're planning a short break to Dubrovnik or tagging it on to a longer trip to explore more of the country. The reason why it's a great time is that the weather is starting to get pleasantly warm, especially compared to northern Europe!\n\nThe air temperature hangs at about 18 degrees, however, in the sunshine (which there is lots of!) it feels much warmer. Do take a jacket with you as it can still be cool in the evenings at this time of year.\n\nAlso, March is mostly outside of the European school holidays, which means fewer crowds and better prices. Check each year for the dates of Easter week. It's different every year and can fall in either March or April.\n\nAlthough the sea is a little bit cool at this time of year to swim in, you can still make the most of the warm rays on the beaches, as well as hire paddleboards and kayaks to explore the coves around the city.\n\nOther things to do are the legendary Dubrovnik wall walk and taking the cable car up to Srd Hill. If you're a Game of Thrones fan, then you'll find plenty of walking tours dedicated to this. On the chance that the weather does turn bad, then there are some great museums housed in ancient buildings that are worthwhile visiting, these include Rector’s Palace and Sponza Palace-Historic Archives.\n\nTürkiye\n\nIstanbul\n\nBy Haley of Haley Blackall Travel\n\nIstanbul, the buzzing cultural hotspot and bridge between the continents of Europe and Asia is a fascinating city to visit. You can find many eye-opening things to do in Istanbul all year round.\n\nStill, March brings a special atmosphere as tulips start to bloom all over the immediate countryside and are brought into some of Istanbul’s famous markets. Fun fact, tulips actually originated in Turkey, not the Netherlands as some may believe.\n\nMarch starts to see sunny and clear days in Istanbul with temperatures of 5 - 12 degrees Celsius. Days will become longer than in winter months with sunrise at 7:15 AM and sunset at 7:15 PM. Take your spring jacket and a warm sweater and roam the fascinating streets of this multi-cultural city.\n\nMarch is also shoulder season in Istanbul, so you won’t see as many tourists flocking to major attractions like the Hagia Sophia Mosque and Spice Market, having the halls and stalls all to yourself.\n\nDepending on the year, you can catch the Istanbul International Dance Festival where over 25 dance styles are showcased. If films are more your thing, the Istanbul Film Festival will feature young directors and independent films from all over the world.\n\nIn this transitional month, opt to explore indoor venues in the mornings and evenings like the Topkapi Palace, The Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar. Istanbul is the perfect place to start or end your ultimate 10-day Turkey itinerary. If you end your trip in Istanbul, grab some local delicacies like Baklava, ceramics, Turkish carpets or a traditional Turkish coffee pot to bring home.\n\nIceland\n\nVik\n\nby Jessica from Uprooted Traveler\n\nIf you’re looking for a unique European getaway in March, consider Vik, a small fishing village along the southern coastline of Iceland, known for its rolling green hills and dramatic ocean views.\n\nVik is famous for Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach, with its jet-black sand, jagged sea stacks, and rugged cliffs of columnar basalt. Reynisfjara is so stunning, in fact, it was used as a filming location in the beloved fantasy series, Game of Thrones! While this is a popular tourist attraction year-round, you’ll be able to experience the beach with just a fraction of the crowds that you would encounter during the busy summer season.\n\nAdditionally, spring has the advantage of having all of the perks of wintertime in Iceland, but without the biting chill and incredibly short days of the very coldest months. For example, the winter is the best time to explore the country’s ice caves, like the nearby Katla Ice Cave, where guides will take you through twisting tunnels carved into ancient glacier ice around you. Alternatively, March is still an excellent time to catch the Northern Lights, due to the long, dark nights, but you’ll have a much more pleasant time staying outside and watching them as opposed to in the deepest depths of winter.\n\nJust be sure to still bring lots of warm layers to wear while you’re exploring Vik’s magnificent landscape- you’ll still be just slightly south of the Arctic Circle."
