However, the Canary Islands, off the coast of Morocco, add a 2nd time zone to the country. Here, the local time is 1 hour behind the mainland.\n\nTime Zones Not Currently Being Observed in Spain\n\nOffsetTime Zone Abbreviation & NameCommencesUTC +0WETWestern European Time27.

They will become active again after the next clock change as Daylight Saving Time begins or ends.\n\nIs Spain Using the Wrong Time Zone?\n\nSpain uses a time zone that does not adequately reflect the solar time on its longitude. Central European Time (CET) is based on the solar time at 15° eastern longitude, which runs along the border between Germany and Poland. Central European Summer Time (CEST), Spain's Daylight Saving Time, refers to an even less suitable solar time, at 30° eastern longitude, which runs close to Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\nIn terms of geography, it would make more sense if continental Spain observed the same local time as the Canary Islands. In fact, the country did so for decades—from 1900, when time zones were introduced there, to 1940, when the dictator Francisco Franco moved Spain to the time zone it uses today."
