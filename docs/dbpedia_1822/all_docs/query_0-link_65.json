        "text": "Sardinia, a big island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, is one of Italy’s 20 administrative regions and the country’s second largest island after Sicily. It’s a little-known region that was almost entirely off the tourist map until about 20 years ago.\n\nEven as tourism here has grown over the last 2 decades, until very recently it has been known almost exclusively to Italian tourists and some Europeans. And the vast majority of them have only one region of the island in mind - the Costa Smeralda.\n\nThe rest of the world’s loss has long been our gain! We Sardinians know the jewel of an island we live on and in an era of mass tourism we have been lucky to have it almost entirely to ourselves.\n\nWith the best beaches in the Mediterranean, exquisite food, untouched nature, and friendly local people, Sardinia offers everything that you could hope for in a Mediterranean vacation.\n\nSince so little is known about the island to outsides, I’ve put together this list of tips and practical information that visitors should know before coming. I hope it’s helpful!\n\nMore Sardinia travel info:\n\nIf you could use some one-on-one help planning your itinerary, schedule a Sardinia travel consultation with me!\n\nSardinia travel guide\n\n7-day Sardinia itinerary\n\nCagliari city guide\n\nGuide to the Costa Smeralda\n\nBest restaurants in Sardinia\n\n13 great beaches in Sardinia\n\n1. Sardinia may be Italy, but we are Sardinian above all\n\nSardinia is a distinct nation all its own. Our history is completely unique and totally distinct from the rest of Italy.\n\nReports repeatedly state that more than 50% of the population identifies as feeling Sardinian and not Italian. They’re certainly not all 100% serious, but it still tells you something.\n\nOur island is quite far from the Italian coastline and, beginning with the Romans, mainland Italy never really paid us much attention. As such, we’ve been left to our own devices for most of our history and developed very distinctive civilizations. The one that is least known, but probably with which we most identify is the prehistoric “Nuragic” civilization that existed for almost 1,000 years during the Bronze age.\n\nWe also have our own language, Sardo.\n\nWe are 1.6 millions Sardinian, spread over a big territory, so we have one of the lowest ratios of people per sq kilometer in all of Europe. And the vast majority of people live along the coast, resulting in an island with vast “silent” landscapes. This solitude and historical disconnect from the outside world has certainly affected our culture and character. While the rest of Italy has been packing people into tiny spaces for millennia, we have plenty of open space!\n\nAll of this and so much more is what makes Sardinia such a unique place, unlike anywhere else in Europe.\n\n2. Asking for the best beaches is pointless - they’re all astonishing\n\nI know that everyone wants a list of “the best beaches in Sardinia”, but it’s really so pointless to provide one.\n\nWhen you’re here, every beach you’re at will be the best you’ve ever seen. Until, of course, you leave and go to the next one, which will instantly replace it on your list.\n\nSardinia has over 1,800 kms of coastline, and the terrain varies all over the island so you’ll find long sandy beaches, secret coves, idyllic bays, natural pools, imposing sand dunes, pink sand, white sand, golden sand, and on and on.\n\nThe beaches look so diverse because of the rocks and sand - ranging from glimmering rocky quartz beaches to deep gold sand ones and then volcanic grays. Then you of course also have beaches with limestone, multicolored pebbles, and basalt. And some beaches have no beach at all - you can just jump straight in from the cliffs!\n\nBut hey, I know you still want a list, so let me give you some of my favorites. I’ll divide them up by region:\n\nSouth West: Chia, Tuerredda, Porto Pino, Cala Domestica\n\nSouth East: Cala Giunco, Costa Rei, Sarrala\n\nCentre West: Piscinas, Mari Ermi, S’Archittu\n\nCentre East: All the coves of Orosei Gulf, Bidderosa, La Caletta\n\nNorth West: La Pelosa, Rena Majore, Li Cossi\n\nNorth East: The whole La Maddalena Archipelago, Capriccioli, Cala Brandinchi, La Cinta\n\nFor more ideas, check out my guide to 13 great beaches in Sardinia.\n\n8. You really need to rent a car\n\nWhen visiting Sardinia, you absolutely need to have a car. You simply cannot get around the island efficiently using public transport. And even more, if you rely on public buses, you won’t be able to get to many of the places that make Sardinia so special: our fabulous beaches and dramatic wild places.\n\nMost people coming to Sardinia want to beach hop (and rightly so) and this is impossible without a car. While you have public transport options from cities like Alghero and Cagliari that will get you to some beaches, you’ll be limited to the most popular ones and you won’t be able to stop at your leisure at all those inviting secret coves and bays.\n\nWhen renting a car, know that our airports are very close to their respective city centers, usually less than 15 minutes away. Since there are good bus connections between the airport and the centers, I always recommend renting your car from a local agency based outside of the airport. It will save you a fortune and you won’t lose any time doing it.\n\nWith local agencies, if you’re planning on getting the full coverage insurance from them, pay it directly at the counter instead of online. It’s usually much cheaper, which most people don’t expect to be the case.\n\nTo check prices and book, I recommend using DiscoverCars. It’s a car rental website that includes offerings from all the major international rental companies as well as lots of smaller local agencies, which often have much better pricing. You can often find great deals.\n\nI use it myself and have always had good experiences.\n\n11. It’s fairly expensive (unless you head inland)\n\nThere’s no two ways about it, Sardinia is not cheap. Prices in major beach destinations like the Costa Smeralda can be downright astronomical and from June to August prices along most of the touristed coastline will invariably skyrocket. You should expect to pay similar prices for accommodation, meals, and activities/experiences as you would in northern Italy’s tourist hot spots.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say that you can’t find bargains in Sardinia. Most tourists head to the same places, driving up the costs there, while entire stretches of coast receive barely any visitors. If you get creative with your planning and stay a bit further away from the most well-known beaches, you can find very good prices even in the height of high season.\n\nAnd for legitimately cheap prices, you just need to head into the interior. In Sardinia’s mountains and inland areas you can find terrific prices at great family-run agriturismos, fabulous local restaurants, and excellent inexpensive wineries.\n\n12. Tipping is appreciated, but not expected\n\nTipping in Sardinia, like in the rest of Italy, is not expected (for most things).\n\nAs most foreign visitors to Sardinia have traditionally been other Europeans (German, French, Dutch, Scandinavians, etc.) who also don’t tip, tipping culture is still not really a thing. However, as more American tourists start to come, tips are beginning to become more common.\n\nIn general, at restaurants it is uncommon for Sardinians to tip. For services like transfers and tours, tipping would be slightly more common, though still not standard.\n\nThat said, as always, if you received exceptionally good service, a tip is always appreciated.\n\n13. Cagliari is worth visiting\n\nCagliari, our capital city, has finally seen a bit of a tourism boom in recent years. While Sardinia has been quite popular as a beach destination for a few decades, most visitors tended to arrive to Cagliari’s airport and then depart straightaway for other parts of the island. This is a shame.\n\nNot spending at least a day or two in Cagliari is a mistake as the city has a lot to offer. It is also very close to some of Sardinia’s best beaches (some of which are even reachable by bus) and it offers a good range of reasonably-priced accommodation options. Cagliari is an excellent base from which to explore the southern coast of the island.\n\nCentral Cagliari is divided into four old districts: Castello, Stampace, Marina, and Villanova.\n\nCastello – This is the “castle” district located at the very top of town. You have lovely narrow, cobbled streets, remnants of the city’s ancient defensive structures, and fabulous lookout points.\n\nMarina – The Marina is the waterfront district right in front of our port. This area is a melting pot of immigrants from Bengladesh, India, and North and West Africa, and tourists from all over the world. The wonderful combination of people makes it a lively, colorful, and very interesting place to visit.\n\nStampace – Stampace is a district on the western side of town that is home to a majestic Roman Amphitheater, the lovely Botanical gardens, and the Punic-era necropolis of Tuvixeddu.\n\nVillanova – Villanova is a small area full of colorful houses, pedestrian lanes, and leafy squares. It feels like a little village right in the heart of the city.\n\n26. In Alghero they speak a dialect of Catalan\n\nThe city of Alghero was long under the control of the crown of Aragon, a kingdom located in the now-Spanish region of Catalunya (around Barcelona). Because of the long presence of Aragonese, you can still hear some people in the province of Alghero speak a language that is neither Sardinian nor Italian. It is Catalan, the language spoken in Catalunya!\n\nThere are very few speakers left, but it is an interesting little piece of history and linguistics.\n\n27. Giuseppe Garibaldi spent his final years here\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, the father of Italian unification, spent the final years of his life on the island of Caprera in the La Maddalena archipelago.\n\nHis home is now a museum owned and managed by the Italian state and visitors can see the house that he lived in, his estate, and the family cemetery where Garibaldi himself is buried.\n\nAside from being an interesting museum dedicated to one of the most important figures in italian history, the beaches on Caprera are also excellent.\n\n28. Sardinian wine is as good as anywhere else in the world!\n\nYou should have no doubt – Sardinian wine is good!! The Nuragic people who settled in Sardinina during the early Bronze Age almost 3,000 years ago were already producing wines, so it’s safe to say that we’ve been doing this for a while.\n\nSardinian wine does not have much of an international reputation, but thanks to over 100 varietals of local grapes and the hard word, commitment, and skill of a new generation of young wine makers, Sardinian wine is now beginning to gain some much deserved recognition.\n\nWine production here is different than in some other parts of Italy where wines have been valued by the foreign market for decades and the business has therefore become very corporate and industrial. Here in the villages its still very common for individual families to make their own wines and even for people without vineyards to buy grapes so that they too can produce their own!\n\n30. The best time to visit depends on your interests (oh fine, it’s the fall!)\n\nSummer\n\nBeing a beach destination, most people assume that the best time to visit Sardinia is the summer. But it’s not as easy as that! The best time for a visit very much depends on what you’re looking to do while here.\n\nIf your goal is to hit the beach and spend your days lounging by the sea, then summer or early fall is certainly the right time to come. But even so, know that peak season, July through August, is the busiest time of year and the most expensive. It’s also very hot.\n\nThe most touristed parts of Sardinia in the summer are:\n\nThe Olbia/Costa Smeralda stretching north to Santa Teresa di Gallura and south to San Teodoro\n\nThe Alghero area\n\nThe area around Cagliari from Chia on the west to Villasimius on the east\n\nIf you like movida (nightlife and action), very hot weather, can stomach the high prices, and you don’t mind a bit of crowds, then summer is the perfect time for a visit.\n\nEven so, these are only three areas of the island and there are entire vast stretches of coast that are practically unknown to outsiders even in the summer. You’ll have to forgive me, but these I don’t share in this post. We need to keep some places special and outside the “mass tourism” circuit. Of course I “reveal” some secrets during mySardinia Travel Consultations.\n\nFall\n\nFor us, the best time to visit Sardinia is indisputable the fall. By coming after the second week of September, you’ll get perfect beach weather but with shoulder season prices and much smaller crowds. Most years, the weather is good enough for swimming all the way up to November, so our recommendation would be to focus on early to mid-October if you want to get the lowest prices without sacrificing the chance to swim!\n\nThe weather here is typically warm enough for swimming through all of October and even into November (and occasionally December in the south). This period is also perfect for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and rock climbing as the weather is good, but not scorching and there’s almost no threat of rain.\n\nAdditionally, the “Autunno in Barbagia” (Fall in Barbagia) festival takes place in the mountains all throughout the fall, with different towns hosting typical festivals dedicated to local customs, traditions, foods, and more. It’s a wonderful time to be here.\n\nIf you wait until the second half of September, European schoolchildren will be back in classes, so there will be far fewer other tourists around too. With high season over and stress levels returning back to normal, locals are also often a bit friendlier once August is in the rearview.\n\nSpring\n\nFrom March until late May wildflowers all over the island are in bloom, providing visitors with a bounty of colors and perfumes. Temperatures are pleasant for active pursuits, though usually a bit too chilly for swimming. It can also be rainy.\n\nThere’s almost never anyone around in the spring though, so it’ll be just you and us locals! This is prime “road tripping” season.\n\nWinter\n\nSince it’s an island, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there would be little reason to visit Sardinia in winter. While you’d be mostly right, there are still some compelling reasons to come!\n\nFirst of all, prices will be very cheap as this is the dead of low season. You’re also all but guaranteed to have beaches, sites, hikes, and hotels all to yourself.\n\nThe coldest months are January and February, but what winter in Sardinia looks like depends on where you are.\n\nIn the south, you’ll rarely see temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the day and you’ll get occasional 70 degree days that may actually be warm enough for a swim. Meanwhile in the mountains of the interior it gets proper cold with freezing temperatures and occasional snowfall!\n\nAnd in February you have the incredibly evocative Carnival celebrations that are somber, mysterious, plainly pagan in origin, and completely distinct from any other Carnival you’ll have seen. Visting the towns of Mamoiada, Othana, or Orotelli to bear witness to this ancient festival is something that will stay with you for a lifetime."
