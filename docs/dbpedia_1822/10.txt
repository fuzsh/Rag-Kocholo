To those who are here because they’re coming to our 2024 wedding outside of Barcelona — this is for you! 🤍 And to those who stumbled across it because they also want to know everything they need to know about Barcelona — this is for you, too.

Whatever your reason, I’m glad you’re here. I’m going to try my best to introduce Barcelona and Spain for anyone who’s visiting for the first time.

Basic Facts About Barcelona and Spain

All of Spain* is in the Central European Time zone (UTC/GMT+1) or Central European Summer Time zone (UTC/GMT+2) during Daylight Savings Time, aka most of the year. This means that Spain is 7 hours ahead of where I live, in Missouri.

*The Canary Islands, which are part of Spain, are on a different time zone, one hour behind.

Spain is part of the European Union and uses the euro (€) as its currency, like many other EU countries. In the early 2010s, the exchange rate between euros and USD wasn’t very good, but it’s a lot better now. With any currency, it’s tempting (but often dangerous) to think of it as a 1:1 exchange between the two, but in the case of euros to dollars, it won’t get you in too much trouble for small purchases.

Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain after Madrid, the country’s capital city, with a metro population of about 5 million people.

Similar to how the U.S. is divided into states, Spain is divided into 17 “autonomous regions.” Barcelona is located in the autonomous region of Catalonia, and it’s also Catalonia’s capital. However, Catalonia’s relationship with Spain is one that has been complicated for more than 300 years.

Historical/Political Context of Barcelona and Catalonia

When you’re a tourist, it’s always a good idea to have a basic understanding of the historical, social, and political factors at play in the place you’re visiting. I feel like it helps you to broaden your horizons and experience a place more fully when you have context for what’s going on around you. So let me do my best to explain a little bit about what’s going on in Barcelona and Catalonia as a whole.

To make a long story short(er) — Catalonia has long wanted independence from Spain, to become its own country. In the past, Catalonia was an independent state. And not only do they have their own culture and history, they also speak their own language — Catalan. While Catalonians also speak perfect Spanish, in the company of their local friends and family, they much prefer to speak Catalan. And when you’re out and about in Barcelona or Catalonia, you’ll likely see signs in Catalan first, then Spanish.

One major development in the last few years was a Catalan independence referendum, held on October 1, 2017. The vote for independence passed with 92% approval, but the Spanish central government had declared the referendum was “unconstitutional” several weeks before it took place. As the vote went ahead, there were countless videos of police brutality inflicted on voters at the polls, as well as many reports of widespread voter suppression.

All this to say… despite the vote, Catalonia has not become independent, even 6 years later. However, when you visit Barcelona, you will likely see several symbols in support of Catalan independence. The Estalada flag shows support for the Catalan independence movement, and the yellow ribbon shows support for the movement’s political prisoners.

How Much Time Do You Need in Barcelona?

Barcelona has so much to see and do! For that reason, I’d say you need a minimum of three days in order to make the most of your time there.

Keep in mind that many flights from the U.S., for example, arrive early in the morning around 7 or 8 a.m. local time. Which, if you’re accustomed to a U.S. time zone, is anywhere from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. In other words, you’re most likely going to be exhausted the first day you’re there, even if you grab a couple of hours of sleep on the overnight flight. So in that case, you might want four days.

How To Get From Barcelona Airport to the City

Barcelona has a great public transportation system that is fairly easy to navigate, even if you’ve never been there before. The metro (subway) even goes directly to and from the airport. Be sure to download the app “Citymapper” to help you plan your journeys. It’s one of my favorite apps ever.

When arriving in Barcelona, follow the signs for the metro (the symbol is an M in a diamond). Once you’re there, you’ll need to buy a metro ticket from one of the machines — it’s €5 for trips to/from the airport.

Another newer option is to take the airport bus, or Aerobús shuttle, from the airport to the city. When we used it in October 2023, it was about €6 per person and took us to Barcelona’s city center in just over half an hour. There’s no need to buy a ticket in advance, as you can pay with credit card or tap-to-pay when boarding. Even if the bus doesn’t get you exactly where you need to go, you’ll likely be near a metro station where you can buy a ticket to continue your journey.

If you don’t want to deal with the metro or a bus, you could also take a taxi. It’s probably best to pre-book a service, which I’ve done a few times in other cities, and then you get someone standing in arrivals with a little iPad with your name waiting for you.

Uber is also an option, but I don’t really recommend it. The last time we tried to use it in Barcelona was around Christmas, and it was kind of weird. Like, if you requested a ride, you had to wait 15-30 minutes before it would actually make the request to a driver. I’m pretty sure it has to do with the ongoing legal battles between Uber and the government.

So, if you’re planning to use Uber, don’t forget to request it at least 15 minutes before you’re ready to be picked up.

Things To Do in Barcelona

Barcelona is a super vibrant city with lots to do — especially when it comes to art and culture.

The number one thing you need to do in Barcelona is visit the iconic Sagrada Familía church. I’ve probably been to 100 churches around Europe, and this is by far the most impressive and the most unique! While it’s stunning enough from the outside, the inside is guaranteed to take your breath away. (Don’t look at too many pictures before you go, so you can be surprised.)

The Sagrada Familía has been under construction since 1882, and it’s finally scheduled to be completed in 2026 — to mark the 100-year anniversary of its famed architect, Antoni Gaudí, who is buried in the basilica’s crypt.

You can book your tickets through Sagrada Familía’s website, or you can choose a guided tour. Whatever you decide, make sure to buy your tickets in advance so you don’t have to wait in line or risk it selling out.

Gaudí’s architectural masterpieces are all over Barcelona, and I recommend doing as many of them as you can! Parc Güell is another can’t-miss sight, and it’s one of the most photogenic spots in the whole city. While it can get pretty crowded, especially in the summer, getting there early in the morning can help quell some of the crowds. Buying tickets in advance for Parc Güell is key, too.

When walking along the Passeig de Gràcia, Barcelona’s most famous shopping street, you’ll likely come across Casa Battló and La Pedrera – Casa Milà, two more Gaudí creations. Casa Battló is like a fun house, as you take a audio-guided tour with a tablet that allows you to learn the history of the house, while using virtual reality to help you understand Gaudí’s designs. And I’ve actually never been on the inside of La Pedrera, so let me know if you check it out, and what it’s like!

Besides all the Gaudí stuff, Barcelona has even more to do. The Gothic Quarter is one of my favorite places to wander, with its tiny shops and narrow streets where you never know what’s going to be around the corner. Nearby, you’ll find the Barcelona Cathedral, which is much more traditional than the Sagrada Familía but still pretty, both inside and outside.

And with Barcelona’s location on the Mediterranean Sea, you could go to the beach! Barceloneta Beach is the one I’m most familiar with, but there are plenty of great beaches all along the coast.

I could probably spend forever talking about things to do in Barcelona, so here are a few more things you can check out if you’ve got space in your itinerary:

Mercado de La Boqueria

Picasso Museum

Camp Nou (home of FC Barcelona)

Plaça d’Espanya

Parc de la Ciutadella

Where To Stay in Barcelona

Barcelona has plenty of hotels and Airbnbs, so you’re sure to find something that meets your needs and budget. (You’ll probably be surprised how inexpensive it will be!)

Ideally, you’ll want to stay somewhere fairly central that will help you get to the things you want to do, and the places you want to go, without too much time spent commuting. Here are some of the best neighborhoods for tourist stuff:

La Barceloneta

El Born

Eixample

Gothic Quarter

El Raval

Honestly, you can stay anywhere, especially if you’re not too far from a metro stop.

Food & Drink in Barcelona

Mealtimes in Spain and Barcelona are a lot different from what most Americans are used to. Lunch is usually between 1-3 p.m., and dinner isn’t until 9 p.m. or later. Here are some of my best tips about food and drink in Spain and Barcelona:

Typical Spanish breakfasts

My favorite typical Spanish breakfast to tell people about is called pan con tomate — bread with tomato — and you can find it all over Spain. It’s basically some toast with some sort of fresh tomato puree, which varies based on where you are in the country, along with some olive oil and salt.

I don’t like tomatoes, so I always order pan con mantequilla y mermelada — bread with butter and jam, usually peach or strawberry.

Add a café con leche, which is espresso with scalded milk, and your total breakfast price for one person is probably about €3 or less. You also need to make sure you try some fresh zumo de naranja, orange juice, at some point. Cafes usually have a big machine where they squeeze it right in front of you!

The best meal deals

During the work week, you’ll probably see chalkboards outside of restaurants that say “Menu del Día,” listing a set menu for a certain price, usually between €8-14. For that price, you typically get to choose a starter, a main dish, a drink (beer or wine), and a dessert or coffee. Sometimes your drink of choice ends up being a whole bottle of wine instead of a glass — it just depends on if you end up in a little family run place (full bottle: likely) or if you’re at a more tourist-centric place (full bottle: unlikely).

For dessert, be sure to try Crema Catalana at least once! It’s like a Catalan version of crème brulee, and it is goooood.

My food recommendations

Here are some of my favorite Spanish foods you should try. A lot of these are tapas btw.

Patatas bravas: Potato wedges with tomato sauce. (They kinda sound like French fries, and they’re kinda not French fries?) Or, patatas bravas con alioli, which is like a garlic aioli.

Croquetas: Croquettes filled with ham, cheese, etc.

Paella: Obviously, paella! You can typically get it as a starter item on menus del día on Thursdays.

Pimientos de padrón: Little shriveled, salty green peppers

Queso de cabra: Literally anything with goat cheese is amazing. Especially if it comes with honey, balsamic, or some other type of tasty drizzle.

Tostadas de anchoa: Matt wanted me to add this one. It’s little toasts with anchovies on them. I think they’re decent, he loves them.

Churros: Spanish churros aren’t sweet like Mexican churros — they’re essentially just fried dough. But they’re still tasty, especially if you order them with chocolate!

A secret about Sangria

If you like sangria, do not order it in Spain!

Instead, order “tinto de verano,” which basically means “summer wine.”

It’s pretty much the exact same thing as sangria, meaning it’s red wine with fizzy lemonade and maybe even some orange or lemon slices. But instead of getting charged €5-6 for it, you’ll pay €2-3. You’re welcome. 🙂

A few last things you really need to know about eating out in Spain

Going out to eat in Spain is much different from going out to eat in the U.S.

First, waiters are not attentive. They don’t have to be… because they’re not living off your tips. Yes, that’s one awesome thing about restaurants in Spain — you don’t have to tip. Ever! But because of that, you have to expect a different level of service.

Waiters are not going to come check on you every two minutes. They’re also not trying to turn your table over the second you get your food. They’re getting paid the same no matter how long you stay. Which means, when you’re ready to leave, you need to flag them down and ask for the check by saying “la cuenta, por favor.” Please go into every interaction with your waiter knowing this, and don’t be upset by slow or non-existent service. It’s just different here!

The other great monetary advantage about going out to eat in Spain is that the tax is already included on the prices you see on the menu. So if you and your companion each order a menu del día, and each one is €10, your check at the end of the meal will be €20.

Public Transport in Barcelona

The metro will likely take you to most of the things you’ll want to do. For exploring the city, I recommend buying a ticket called “T-casual” from one of the machines in the metro stations. This is good for 10 trips and only costs about €11, and it works for both the metro and the bus. (Don’t be afraid of taking the bus! Citymapper will also help with that, as well as give you transit maps for the city.)

Mobile/tap-to-pay payment typically works on the bus, but it’s a good idea to either have cash if you end up outside the Barcelona “proper” city limits, where buses aren’t equipped for digital payment. For the metro, you’ll always need to buy a ticket (either a single or the T-casual) at one of the machines, but you can use a credit card.

Safety in Barcelona

As with any tourist destination, you’ll want to keep an eye on your belongings and watch out for pickpockets. Especially in crowded areas like Las Ramblas. Try your best not to *act* like a tourist — everyone will probably know you are one, but don’t be obnoxious and you won’t make yourself an easy target.

There’s no need to carry your passport around with you on a daily basis, so don’t keep it with you. Keep it somewhere safe in your hotel or Airbnb. Also, you don’t really need to carry a lot of cash with you either! Having a bit of cash on you is usually a good idea in case you find yourself somewhere that doesn’t accept credit cards — but that’s really rare. Recently, I haven’t even been carrying my wallet with me, because in Spain’s big cities, almost everywhere has Apple Pay/Google Pay, so we only need our phones. (Unless you’re taking the bus and are outside Barcelona proper.)

Besides petty crime, you’re going to be pretty safe in Barcelona. (Safer than any school, grocery store, or movie theater in the U.S., I daresay.) The only other thing you might need to watch out for would be protests, which are somewhat common and usually not violent, but as a rule of thumb it’s best not to get involved.

A few more random tips that didn’t fit anywhere else

Money:

Take out a bit of cash at the airport when you arrive, but not more than €100 because I really don’t think you’ll need to use that much cash. Also, use the ATMs instead of the currency exchange desk.

Definitely set up Apple Pay or Google Pay on your phone if you haven’t already.

Pay with your credit card as much as you can, especially if you can earn points! (Be sure your card doesn’t have foreign transaction fees.) If the screen ever asks you whether you want to pay in euros or dollars, choose euros. You’ll get a better exchange rate.

If you’re not sure whether a place accepts cards, just ask “tarjeta?” (Tar-hey-ta?) Cash is “efectivo.” (Eh-fect-ee-vo)

Food & drink:

You can drink the tap water in Spain, though it doesn’t always taste good. Barcelona’s is pretty decent.

If you order water at a restaurant, they will bring you a bottle that you have to pay for. If you just want free tap water, ask for “agua de grifo” (agua de gree-fo).

When you go to a restaurant, you typically seat yourself and wait for a waiter to come attend you.

Domestic stuff:

If you’re staying in an Airbnb with a washing machine, it’s probably not going to have a dryer. They’re not very common in Spain. Instead, you’ll have to hang dry your clothes.

Some Airbnbs or homestays won’t have air conditioning, so if that’s important to you, be sure to add that as a search filter.

If you use your hairdryers or straighteners from the U.S., they might get fried. That’s because the U.S. uses 120 volt power, and Spain uses 230 volts. Look for dual-voltage travel versions of those electronics you can’t live without.

Things like your phone charger and computer should be fine, though.

You’ll need some outlet converters. Spain uses socket Type C, like much of Europe.

I hope this gives you a great start for your Barcelona trip! Let me know what other questions you have. 🙂
