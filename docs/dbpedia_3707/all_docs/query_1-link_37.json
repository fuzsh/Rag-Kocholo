Big Country will be performing songs from the album as well as the classic hits and live favourites including: ’Fields of Fire’, ‘In A Big Country’, ‘Chance’, ‘Wonderland’, ‘Look Away’ and many more.\n\nFormed in 1981 by guitar playing founder members, Stuart Adamson and Bruce Watson, both native of the band’s hometown Dunfermline in Scotland, the duo were Initially driven by a shared vision of widescreen guitar melody, harmony and lyric.

The UK, Japan and most European countries, earning the trio every conceivable accolade at the time — not to mention enough Gold records to make Fort Knox a little envious!\n\nMore than five decades on, the threesome has retained their precise vocal qualities, and, in between, they have amassed an impressive list of hit records.\n\nIn 1972, they aligned their recording fate with Gamble and Huff’s Philadelphia International label and hit the charts in 1972 with Dirty Ol’ Man. Soon after came The Sound of Philadelphia, which featured the ladies with MFSB. The following year produced their biggest hit When Will I See You Again.\n\n“The whole Philadelphia Sound was the brainchild of Kenny (Gamble) and Leon (Huff),” Valerie explains. “They wrote and produced most of the hits for Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, The O’Jays, Billy Paul and The Jacksons among many others.”\n\nDuring their 3 years with Philadelphia International, they enjoyed a good measure of success, the hits kept coming with “Year Of Decision”, “Take Good Care Of Yourself” & “Toast of Love”\n\nIt was during this era that the threesome made their biggest forward strides. A great deal of attention has been given to the fact that Prince Charles, now King Charles III publicly acclaimed The Three Degrees as his favourite group… Charlie’s Angels, as they were tagged! “It was a great feeling…a feeling of awe” is how Valerie remembers this accolade.\n\nIn 1978 they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder (he of Donna Summer fame) and a new string of hits followed. “Giving Up, Giving In”, “My Simple Heart”, “The Runner” and the lush ballad, “Woman In Love”\n\nThe Three Degrees can still make the claim as being the longest-running female vocal group in history and they show no signs of slowing down!\n\nThe Three Degrees are Valerie Holiday, Freddie Pool & Jessie Wagner\n\nView Event →\n\nSEX PISTOLS EXPOSE + SIX LITTLE FINGERS\n\nBlack Rabbit Production + Pogo Events Presents\n\nSex Pistols Expose + SIX Little Fingers\n\nThe Sex Pistols Expose (formally the Sex Pistols Experience)\n\nApproved by all members of the Sex Pistols, the 'Sex Pistols Exposé' are the worlds number 1 tribute which brings high expectancy where ever they perform, Branding the well known clobber with Johnny Rotten's snarling persona and Sid Vicious's gimmick, It will bring back the highly loved spirit of 77'.

In the country of Pink Floyd and Michael Kiwanuka, he first played in a few small clubs, then step by step progressed to bigger stages. The band Wishbone Ash invited Félix to join them on their UK tour.\n\nHe has recently released his first album \"Pogboy\", an album of six titles built around his titanic guitar playing, in which he takes his inspiration from the masters, while at the same time affirming his independence from them.\n\nView Event →\n\nMarquee Square Heroes (Marillion Tribute)\n\nTHE HIGHLY Celebrated FISH-era MARILLION tribute band RETURN TO WORTHING!\n\nMARQUEE SQUARE HEROES, perform a full-length, 2+ hour show featuring current and former members of MARILLION contemporaries TWELFTH NIGHT, CREDO, and JUMP drawing material from the classic debut album ‘Script for a Jester's Tear’, the magnificent sophomore album ‘Fugazi’, the number-one album ‘Misplaced Childhood’, and its spectacular follow-up ‘Clutching at Straws’.\n\nThe band also delve into the compilation album ‘B-Sides Themselves’ and the legendary ‘Market Square Heroes’ EP, which, of course, contains the epic ‘Grendel.’\n\n“This band were phenomenal, fantastic musicianship with every song nailed.
