Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) *'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates) 'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) 'MY DEAH' ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) 'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) Spectacles 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, (Van Gelder) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE BLUEST EYE' Toni Morrison's first novel is adapted by Lydia Diamond in a production aimed at young adults and teenagers. Sensitively acted, but it still feels like a book talking to us from the stage (1:30). Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'BUENOS AIRES IN TRANSLATION (BAiT)' Featuring four plays, this cross-cultural festival combines Argentinian writers and American directors, with mixed results. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE FLOOD' This eager, accomplished show about a devastating deluge in an Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately, they're playing uninvolving, cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Rob Kendt) 'LOVE, DEATH AND INTERIOR DECORATING' Theatergoers might want to arrive at intermission for this pair of one-acts by Keith Boynton. Though the first play is shallow and clumsy, the second, about a condemned revolutionary and his bourgeois lover, is fresh, literate and morally compelling (2:00). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Miriam Horn) 'THE MAIL-ORDER BRIDE' and 'THE IMAGINARY INVALID' Charles L. Mee has taken Molière's well-traveled hypochondriac, Argan, and given him a modern twist: the fellow thinks an Asian bride he has purchased will cure what ails him and give him back his youth. The Resonance Ensemble presents both the new work and the Molière classic in repertory, but it's the Molière (with an all-female cast) that works the best, thanks to Virginia Baeta's Argan. The actors in the Mee version never quite seem comfortable, which is too bad, because Mr. Mee packs the play with what should be good stuff. (Running time for each: 1:30.) The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'PORT AUTHORITY THROW DOWN' Mike Batistick's intercultural tale of an angry Pakistani cabdriver, a white Christian missionary from Ohio, a black homeless alcoholic and the driver's activist brother is far from profound, but it has some solid laughs, and its battered heart is in the right place (2:00). Culture Project at 45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Gates) 'STANLEY 2006' Todd D'Amour's performance art piece rethinks Stanley Kowalski's feelings about Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The work is striking and original but at times frustrating and heavy on the angst (1:15). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Gates) 'THE SUNSET LIMITED' Cormac McCarthy's elegiac two-man play distills his previous work into a debate about suicide (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. When a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'être is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott) * 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CAUTIVA' (No rating, 108 minutes, in Spanish) This sober melodrama explores the aftereffects of Argentina's dirty war, which have a devastating impact on a teenage girl who discovers terrible secrets in her past. (Scott) 'THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mongolian) The dog is cute, the children are adorable, and the sky seems to stretch on without limit, as does, unfortunately, the slight story from the Mongolian-born filmmaker Byambasuren Davaa. (Dargis) * 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis) 'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Stephen Holden) 'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis) 'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass ladykiller to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis) * 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott) 'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis) 'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden) 'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote ''Training Day'') are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden) 'THE MAGIC GLOVES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in this limp Argentine comedy whose characters remain trapped several rungs below their aspirations. In the foreground of a featureless Buenos Aires, paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (a cab driver becomes a bus driver), in reflection of the country's larger economic blight. Yet the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that the writer and director, Martín Rejtman, is saving himself for greater things. (Catsoulis) * 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott) * 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott) 'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis) * 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden) 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Will Ferrell restrains his clownish impulses in this metaphysical comedy, directed with equal restraint by Marc Forster. Mr. Ferrell plays an I.R.S. agent who almost simultaneously falls in love with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and discovers that he is a character in an unfinished novel whose author (Emma Thompson) is planning to kill him. He seeks the help of a professor of literature played by Dustin Hoffman, who proves that scholarly criticism might not be a useless pursuit after all. (Scott) 'UMRAO JAAN' (No rating, 145 minutes, in Hindi and Urdu) Weak dubbing and melodramatic overkill hamper this retelling of a historical Indian story, about the travails of a performing courtesan. But its star, Aishwarya Rai, a potent presence, appears destined for international success. (Andy Webster) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almódovar, with Penélope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) * 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis) Film Series BLACK MARIA FILM FESTIVAL: 'THE LEGACY OF THE SHORT FILM' (Through Wednesday) The Museum of Modern Art is presenting eight programs of short films, all from the traveling New Jersey-based Black Maria festival. This weekend's programs include more than three dozen shorts, including Ken Kobland's ''Ideas of Order in Cinque Terre'' (2005), a paean to those Italian cliff towns; Vanessa Schwartz's ''Janitor'' (1993), a reinterpretation of the Bible; and Sam Green's ''Lot 63, Grave C'' (2005),which revisits the Rolling Stones tragic concert at Altamont, Calif.

This weekend's screenings include Elia Kazan's ''On the Waterfront'' (1954) and Jean Vigo's ''À Propos de Nice'' (1930), both with cinematography by Boris Kaufman; ''Man With the Movie Camera'' (1929), the brilliant portrait of Soviet Russian life directed by Dziga Vertov (né Denis Kaufman); and Mikhail Kaufman's ''In Spring'' (1929), which looks at small-town Russia. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $10. (Gates) 'GIVE THANKS FOR JOHN FORD' (Through Nov. 29) BAMcinématek is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Ford's western classic ''The Searchers'' with a four-film Thanksgiving-week tribute. It begins on Wednesday with ''The Searchers'' (1956), in which John Wayne retrieves his niece (Natalie Wood) years after she was kidnapped by the Comanches. The series will also include ''Two Rode Together'' (1961) and ''Destry Rides Again'' (1962), both starring James Stewart; and ''The Sun Shines Bright'' (1953), said to have been Ford's personal favorite. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Gates) ROBERTO ROSSELLINI (Through Dec. 22) The Museum of Modern Art's retrospective of the work of Rossellini (1906-77), the grand old man of postwar Italy's neo-realist movement, continues. This weekend's films include ''Stromboli'' (1949), starring Ingrid Bergman as an Eastern European refugee in a bad marriage; ''The Messiah'' (1975), a biblical biography never released in the United States; and the classic ''Open City'' (1945), set in Rome during the final months of the German occupation. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, and Celeste Bartos Theater, 5 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Gates) 'THREE BY JIM McKAY' (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek is screening three films by Mr. McKay, who made his directorial debut with ''Girls Town'' in 1996. The series begins tomorrow with ''Angel Rodriguez'' (2006), a drama about a white counselor (Rachel Griffiths) who takes in a troubled black teenage client (Jonan Everett). ''Everyday People'' (2004), filmed in and around Fort Greene, will be shown on Monday night, and ''Our Song'' (2002), a coming-of-age story about three girls in Crown Heights, on Tuesday. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; free. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * BARBARA COOK (Tomorrow) This lyric soprano's new show, ''No One Is Alone,'' with the pianist Eric Stern, celebrates the songs of Stephen Sondheim and his closest friends and collaborators, including Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers and Jules Styne. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Stephen Holden) ANI DiFRANCO (Tomorrow) Ms. DiFranco's articulate, uninhibited songs and poems are about staying true to her complicated self: feisty and vulnerable, polysexual, uncompromising and politically engaged, but never humorless. She can strum a guitar and sling words at hyperspeed, or swerve toward jazz and funk. In business (she runs her own label, Righteous Babe Records), as in her music, she's as independent as they come. With Hamell on Trial. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $47. (Jon Pareles) * BOB DYLAN (Monday) On his 32nd studio album, ''Modern Times'' (Columbia), Mr. Dylan is obsessed with the mythic past, serving up a sleek, bluesy time warp that dips into Muddy Waters, Bing Crosby and the obscure 19th-century ''poet laureate of the Confederacy,'' Henry Timrod. Even when studying contemporary popular culture, he is reminded of his own back pages: ''I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,'' he sings. ''When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.'' At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario) BEN FOLDS (Tonight, Sunday and Monday) Though his most intriguing work since the demise of his band Ben Folds Five has been his direction two years ago on William Shatner's surprisingly strong album (really!) ''Has Been,'' in his solo work Mr. Folds has continued to skillfully and entertainingly walk a line between the snarky and the sincere. (His breathy piano-ballad version of a particularly vulgar Dr. Dre song crossed that line by miles.) Tonight at 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out. Sunday at 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $37 in advance, $42 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $37 and $50. (Sisario) GREY DOES MATTER (Tomorrow) Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession. (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja.'') But now he has a full band and is celebrating the release of his new album, ''Your Job Will Kill You'' (Pop Rally!). At 8 p.m., Glasshouse Gallery, 289 Kent Avenue, at South First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $7. (Sisario) HOLD STEADY, CONSTANTINES (Wednesday) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, but with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' With the Constantines, a feedback-worshiping Canadian band. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17. (Sisario) JAGUARES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Jaguares include former members of a leading Mexican rock band, Caifanes, and they add some alternative-rock touches to Caifanes's moody, dynamic songs. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $38 at the door. (Pareles) KID KOALA (Tonight) A superstar on the DJ circuit, Kid Koala, a k a Eric San, from Montreal, has the rare talent of imbuing scattered samples with humor and narrative, allowing him to capture the attention of audiences from clubs to stadiums. (He has opened for the Beastie Boys and Radiohead.) At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario) * MODEST MOUSE (Tonight and tomorrow night) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster last year, Modest Mouse links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. These shows complete a five-concert New York series showing off songs from the band's long-delayed new album as well as its newest member, Johnny Marr, the innovative guitarist of the Smiths. With Marcellus Hall. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) MUDHONEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) When Mudhoney released its first record, ''Touch Me I'm Sick,'' in 1988, the band did not look built to last. But it has persisted with its mixture of sneering blues and boozy, decelerated punk, the ingredients that gave birth to grunge. With Birds of Avalon and Hank IV tonight, and Dan Melchior and Hulda tomorrow. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario) NEW RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE (Tomorrow) There might not have been deafening cries for a reunion of the New Riders of the Purple Sage, the colorless country-rock spinoff of the Grateful Dead. But here it is, with an original member, David Nelson, and Buddy Cage, who took the place of Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $35. (Sisario) NEW YORK DOLLS (Wednesday) Never say die. With its two surviving original members well into their 50s, this proto-punk, proto-glam band, which made trashy cross-dressing a rock 'n' roll virtue, this summer released its first new album in 32 years, ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'' (Roadrunner), and its appetite for sleazy vamps and hilarious wickedness is undiminished. ''You're designed so intelligent/ Ain't no way that was an accident,'' David Johansen sings in ''Dance Like a Monkey.'' ''Come on shake your monkey hips, my pretty little creationist.'' Presented by Little Steven's Underground Garage, with the Supersuckers, the Chesterfield Kings and the Charms. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) OK GO (Tomorrow) With all the focus on this Chicago band's dancing skills -- its ingenious treadmill skit was so popular online that MTV had the group perform it at the Video Music Awards this summer, despite the lack of a nomination -- not much attention has been paid to its jaunty, Cars-like and thoroughly adequate power-pop. So expect more dancing. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) * PERE UBU, BUSH TETRAS (Wednesday) Punk rock had an unassimilable avant-garde right from the start: in the mid-70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. The Bush Tetras, of early 80s New York vintage, have a squirmy funk take on experimental rock. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) PLIMSOULS (Tonight) One of the sharpest bands of the early 80s power-pop scene, the Plimsouls, from Los Angeles, reached back to the Beatles, as well as Elvis Costello, and cemented its place in pop culture with an appearance in the 1983 film ''Valley Girl.'' The band, led by Peter Case, has good luck with reunions: when it got back together in the mid-90s, it made one of its best albums, ''Kool Trash.'' At 8, with Parallax Project, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Sisario) +44 (Tonight) It's not often that the rival former members of a multiplatinum band pass through town with their new groups, giving curious fans a controlled experiment to judge who has made out better. Last year the boys-will-be-boys pop-punk band Blink-182 went on acrimonious hiatus, and one of its two singers, Tom DeLonge, started a new group, Angels and Airwaves; it played the Bowery Ballroom in May. Now come the two other alumni, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, whose group, +44, plays Webster Hall tonight. Both bands are darker and more emo-influenced than Blink-182, but unfortunately for fans scrambling for a way into this show, neither has much of its fire. At 7, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) ROBERT RANDOLPH AND THE FAMILY BAND (Tonight) Robert Randolph used to play gospel songs on his pedal steel guitar at the House of God Church in Orange, N.J. But he and his band have emerged into the secular realm of jam bands, which have embraced both his rip-roaring virtuosity and his gift for making his instrument sing without a word. With Rocco DeLuca and the Burden. At 7:30, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30. (Pareles) LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tomorrow) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbès, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Sisario) GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Wednesday) This salsa singer, or sonero, has held on to the fundamentals of the music, with a voice like a trumpet and a flair for improvisation. Salsa is getting squeezed on one side by reggaetón and on the other by sappy Latin pop, but Mr. Santa Rosa has persevered; at this concert, he celebrates 30 years of hits. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $65 to $125. (Pareles) REGINA SPEKTOR (Monday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out. (Sisario) TRALALA, ANTIETAM (Tonight) The bohemian Brooklyn version of a girl group, Tralala (formerly Tight Fit) features four women singing in animated if inexact harmony, and three men bashing away at the kind of nursery-rhyme-Ramones groove perfected by Shonen Knife. Antietam's slashing guitars, shambling beat and defiant vocals defined indie rock before that label became a vague cliché. (Tralala also opens for Robyn Hitchcock tomorrow.) At 9, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario) Steve Tyrell (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell belongs to a latter-day breed of rock singer who has belatedly embraced popular standards. The breed includes Rod Stewart (whose records Mr. Tyrell co-produces), Michael Bolton and Dr. John (for whom he sometimes sounds like vocal double). At 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $90 cover, dinner required. (Holden) FRANKIE VALLI (Wednesday) Newly re-enshrined by ''Jersey Boys,'' a success on Broadway even as most other shows based on pop stars have failed -- does anyone remember ''Lennon''? -- Mr. Valli begins four nights of concerts at the Rose Theater, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, joined as always by his Four Seasons. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario) * DOC WATSON (Tomorrow) One of the great repositories of American folk music, the guitarist and singer Doc Watson, from Deep Gap, N.C., plays bluegrass, country and blues in an elegant but understated style. He performs as part of a tribute to the Friends of Old Time Music, an organization that played an important role in the early 1960s folk revival in New York City by putting on concerts by rural musicians (it first presented Mr. Watson in 1962); that group is also commemorated on an outstanding new boxed set, ''Friends of Old Time Music: The Folk Revival 1961-1965'' (Smithsonian Folkways). Also on the bill tomorrow are the New Lost City Ramblers, John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful, and Jean Ritchie. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, heartheworld.org; $30 and $40; $15 for students. (Sisario) BRIAN WILSON (Tuesday and Wednesday) A full performance of the Beach Boys' enduring album ''Pet Sounds'' on its 40th anniversary, with a cast of attentive backup singers and Al Jardine, who sang part of the lead on ''I Know There's an Answer.'' At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out on Tuesday; $58.50 to $128.50 on Wednesday. (Sisario) WOLFMOTHER (Wednesday) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960s garage rock, and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Dead Meadow and Silversun Pickups. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $27 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tomorrow) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde over the past 40 years, beginning with his percussive role in the late-period work of John Coltrane. Mr. Ali's drumming, still insistent and undulant, drives this ensemble, with the trumpeter Jumaane Smith, the tenor saxophonist Lawrence Clark, the pianist Greg Murphy and the bassist Ivan Taylor. At 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12. (Nate Chinen) ANDY BISKIN AND TRIO TRAGICO (Tomorrow) Andy Biskin presents a group consisting of himself on clarinet, Dave Ballou on trumpet and Drew Gress on bass; as on the recent album ''Trio Tragico'' (Strudelmedia), their repertory will range from melodic miniatures to collective open-form improvisation. At 9 p.m., BAMcafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JOHNATHAN BLAKE QUARTET (Tomorrow) The drummer Johnathan Blake propels a band with two strong saxophonists -- Jaleel Shaw, alto, and Mark Turner, tenor -- and an unflappable bassist, Ben Street. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; $10 for members. (Chinen) JOANNE BRACKEEN QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday night) A deeply experienced pianist and composer, JoAnne Brackeen produces a whimsical but sophisticated species of post-bop. For this engagement she has enlisted Javon Jackson on tenor saxophone, Richie Goods on bass and Tony Reedus on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen) JIMMY COBB AND COBB'S MOBB (Tonight and tomorrow night) The masterful hard-bop drummer Jimmy Cobb has served as a mentor to many young musicians via this band; one, the guitarist Peter Bernstein, takes the melodic lead here. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $25.

Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Monday) This breezy new production conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set -- a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through, thanks to subtle directing by Bartlett Sher. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Flórez could not be more adorable as Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's usually Mimi's show, but the tenors are a draw in this run: Rolando Villazón, the hot tenor of the moment, on the stage, and Plácido Domingo in the role of mentor, that is, conductor, in the pit. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano who makes her company debut tomorrow, has already shown her credible Mimi across the plaza at the New York City Opera. Susannah Glanville and Peter Coleman-Wright are Musetta and Marcello; for some, Zeffirelli's production will always be the star. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $110 for Tuesday. (Anne Midgette) 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Seville is tired in Jonathan Eaton's ''Carmen'': battered Venetian blinds and jagged Corinthian columns create a mellow air of decrepitude without saying anything particularly original. It's a serviceable enough production, winding up its run tomorrow. Vanessa Cariddi plays the Gypsy; Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No are Micaëla and Escamillo; Scott Piper, who has a promising voice he can sometimes use well, is Don José; and Gary Thor Wedow conducts. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Midgette) 'COSÌ FAN TUTTE' (Tonight) The City Opera's intelligently conceived and well-sung production of Mozart's masterpiece closes tonight. The cast is anchored by Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena. Julius Rudel conducts. At 8, the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland) 'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Opera is big and loud, ''children's theater'' is light and fun, and Engelbert Humperdinck's classic represents an uneasy juxtaposition of the two. City Opera deserves kudos for a production that, by setting the action in 1890's New York, moves the story into a more adult or believable realm -- with Hansel and Gretel as immigrant children lapsing into German ditties in a singing English translation -- without losing some of the important elements, like the witch going into the oven at the end. The singers trade off between performances; Jennifer Aylmer and Jennifer Rivera are one pair of leads who do a fine job. They sing tomorrow; Julianne Borg and Jennifer Tiller sing on Sunday. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette) * 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The Met inaugurated its season, and the tenure of the ambitious general manager Peter Gelb, with the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' There is one more chance to see it. The abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) 'TOSCA' (Tonight and Wednesday) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. Vincenzo La Scola sings Cavaradossi tonight; Walter Fraccaro takes over on Wednesday. James Morris is a known and growly quantity as Scarpia. The real news is the company debut of Nicola Luisotti, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. Tonight at 8, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining for tonight; $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Midgette) Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leon Botstein and his orchestra continue their theme-based exploration of the repertory with ''Symphonic Mexico,'' a program that looks at three of Mexico's best-known composers.

From Carlos Chávez's catalog, Mr. Botstein leads the ''Sinfonía di Antigona'' (1933). And Anne-Akiko Myers will be the soloist in Manuel Ponce's Violin Concerto (1943).

(Kozinn) * CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) Late in life, when he was already ill, Debussy began composing a group of six sonatas for diverse instruments. But he died after writing only three of them.

These recent pieces will be performed along with Debussy's sonatas, which were his final works. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5778, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $58.

(Claudia La Rocco) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale in several pieces, like the tableau of the woman in bed, giant hand to apprehensive face. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter) * Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velázquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbáran and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' (See above.) (Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,' through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them François Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck) * Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) * Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith) * UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck) * The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea ERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the enclosed space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures about the tent and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Nov. 25th. (Benjamin Genocchio) Last Chance * JENNIFER BORNSTEIN You are an anthropologist studying your own tribe without benefit of camera. What to do? Try etching. In her first New York exhibition since her 1998 debut, the neo-Conceptualist Jennifer Bornstein does exactly this, creating small, meticulous, slightly naïve etched portraits of her subjects, starting with her teenage roommate. Friends, colleagues and students are tenderly rendered, as are female performance artists from the 1970s; ideas for sculptures and installations, and, finally, Margaret Mead. The meditation on things anthropological turns in a sly yet genuine self-portrait. Gavin Brown's enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, South Village, (212) 627-5258; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * FERNANDO BOTERO: ABU GHRAIB It is moving to encounter these large, unnerving images and austere compositions on American soil. Based on images and written accounts that came to light at the time of the Iraq prison abuse scandal, they do something the harrowing photographs of the naked, blindfolded and tormented prisoners do not: they restore their dignity and humanity without diminishing their agony or the absolute injustice of their situation. Mr. Botero manages this as painters always have, through manipulations of scale, color and form and majestic isolation and by making surprisingly astute readjustments of his own daffy style. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and works in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) Lisa Yuskavage Featuring nearly 30 pieces, two shows star the dreamily rendered, improbably cantilevered women with whom Ms. Yuskavage has made her reputation. At first glance, these new works seem as dominated as ever by their subjects' cartoonish physical attributes: wistful, pneumatic nudes set in sumptuous, jewel-toned environments, their louche fecundity echoed in sexualized scatterings of globular fruit and bursting floral arrangements. Yet these paintings hold clues to the evolution of Ms. Yuskavage's program. Her transgressive tightrope act between feeding and interrogating the male gaze is more rewarding because she has endowed her characters not simply with dramatic curves, but also with an increasingly vivid inner life. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, and Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street; closes tomorrow. (Jeffrey Kastner)"
