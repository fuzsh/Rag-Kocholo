        "text": "Dreamy Tab Hunter stood out in film history as one of the hottest teen idols of the 1950s era. With blond, tanned, surfer-boy good looks, he was artificially groomed and nicknamed \"The Sigh Guy\" by the Hollywood studio system, yet managed to continue his career long after his \"golden boy\" prime.\n\nHunter was born Arthur Kelm on July 11, 1931 in New York City, to Gertrude (Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His father was Jewish and his mother was a German Catholic immigrant. Following his parents' divorce, Hunter grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, Ida (Sonnenfleth) and John Henry Gelien. His mother changed her sons' surnames to her maiden name, Gelien. Leaving school and joining the Coast Guard at age fifteen (he lied about his age), he was eventually discharged when the age deception was revealed. Returning home, his life-long passion for horseback riding led to a job with a riding academy.\n\nHunter's fetching handsomeness and trim, athletic physique eventually steered the Californian toward the idea of acting. An introduction to famed agent Henry Willson had Tab signing on the dotted line and what emerged, along with a major career, was the stage moniker of \"Tab Hunter.\" Willson was also responsible with pointing hopeful Roy Fitzgerald towards stardom under the pseudonym Rock Hudson. With no previous experience Tab made his first, albeit minor, film debut in the racially trenchant drama Gnadenlos gehetzt (1950) starring Gail Russell and Macdonald Carey. His only line in the movie was eventually cut upon release. It didn't seem to make a difference for he co-starred in his very next film, the British-made Insel der Verhei√üung (1952) opposite a somewhat older (by ten years) Linda Darnell, which was set during WWII on a deserted, tropical South Seas isle. His shirt remained off for a good portion of the film, which certainly did not go unnoticed by his ever-growing legion of female (and male) fans.\n\nSigned by Warner Bros., stardom was clinched a few years later with another WWII epic Urlaub bis zum Wecken (1955), based on the Leon Uris novel, in which he again played a boyish soldier sharing torrid scenes with an older woman (this time Dorothy Malone, playing a love-starved Navy wife). Thoroughly primed as one of Hollywood's top beefcake commodities, the tabloid magazines had a field day initiating an aggressive campaign to \"out\" Hunter as gay, which would have ruined him. To combat the destructive tactics, Tab was seen escorting a number of Hollywood's lovelies at premieres and parties. In the meantime, he was seldom out of his military fatigues on film, keeping his fans satisfied in such popular dramas as Der See-Fuchs (1955), Horizont in Flammen (1956) and Playboy - Marsch, marsch! (1956)--the last two opposite the equally popular Natalie Wood. At around this time, Hunter managed to parlay his boy-next-door film celebrity into a singing career. He topped the charts for over a month with the single \"Young Love\" in 1957 and produced other \"top 40\" singles as well.\n\nLike other fortunate celebrity-based singers such as Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen, his musical reign was brief. Out of it, however, came the most notable success of his film career top-billing as baseball fan Joe Hardy in the classic Faustian musical Damn Yankees (1958) opposite Gwen Verdon and Ray Walston, who recreated their devil-making Broadway roles. Musically, Tab may have been overshadowed but he brought with him major star power and the film became a crowd pleaser. He continued on with the William A. Wellman-directed Lafayette Escadrille (1958) as, yet again, a wholesome soldier, this time in World War I. More spicy love scenes came with So etwas von Frau (1959), an adult comedy-drama which focused on soldier Hunter and va-va-voom mistress Sophia Loren demonstrating some sexual chemistry on a train.\n\nSeldom a favorite with the film critics, the 1960s brought about a career change for Tab. He begged out of his restrictive contract with Warners and ultimately paid the price. With no studio to protect him, he was at the mercy of several trumped-up lawsuits. Worse yet, handsome Troy Donahue had replaced him as the new beefcake on the block. With no film offers coming his way, he starred in his own series Ein Playboy hat's schwer (1960), a rather featherweight sitcom that centered around his swinging bachelor pad. The series last only one season. On the positive side he clocked in with over 200 TV programs over the long stretch and was nominated for an Emmy award for his outstanding performance opposite Geraldine Page in a Playhouse 90 episode. Following the sparkling film comedy In angenehmer Gesellschaft (1961) opposite Debbie Reynolds, the quality of his films fell off drastically as he found himself top-lining such innocuous fare as Sprengkommando Ledernacken (1963), Surfen auf Leben und Tod (1964) (1965), Stadt im Meer (1965) [aka War-Gods of the Deep], and Mr. Bird geht in die Luft (1966) both here and overseas.\n\nAs for stage, a brief chance to star on Broadway happened in 1964 alongside the highly volatile Tallulah Bankhead in Tennessee Williams's \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore.\" It lasted five performances. He then started to travel the dinner theater circuit. Enduring a severe lull, Tab bounced back in the 1980s and 1990s -- more mature, less wholesome, but ever the looker. He gamely spoofed his old clean-cut image by appearing in delightfully tasteless John Waters' films as a romantic dangling carrot to heavyset transvestite \"actress\" Divine. Polyester (1981) was the first mainstream hit for Waters and Tab went on to team up with Allan Glaser to co-produce and co-star a Waters-like western spoof Geier, Geld und goldene Eier (1984).\n\nCo-starring with \"Exorcist\" star Linda Blair in the bizarre horror film Grotesk - Kampf ums √úberleben (1988), Tab's last on-camera appearance would be in a small role in the film Jet, der schwarze Hengst (1992), which he produced. He preferred spending most of his time secluded on his ranch and breeding horses. In 2005, he returned to the limelight when he \"came out\" with a tell-all memoir on his Hollywood years. His long-time partner was film producer Allan Glaser.\n\nTab died on July 8, 2018, in Santa Barbara, California, three days shy of his 87th birthday.\n\nFor such a diminutive (4' 11\") frame, character actor Leslie (Allen) Jordan had a tall talent for scene-stealing. Hailing from the South, as his dead-giveaway drawl quickly exposed, he was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 29, 1955, and raised in a highly conservative, deeply religious atmosphere in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father, a Lieutenant Colonel with the Army, was killed in a plane crash when he was only 11.\n\nUncertain about his direction in life, an inescapable propensity for comedy and high camp, not to mention an impish mug and pocket-sized structure, led him straight to Los Angeles in an attempt to break into commercials and on-camera work. Following training with acting coach Carolyne Barry, who ran the Professional Artist's Group during the 80s, Leslie soon found himself highly marketable in commercial spots (Doritos, Fosters Beer, etc.). TV would invariably be the next step, finding him progressively better parts on such programs as \"The Fall Guy,\" \"The Wizard,\" \"Night Court,\" \"Newhart\" and \"Midnight Caller.\" He then earned a regular role on the short-lived comedy-fantasy series The People Next Door (1989) starring Alan Parker. Inspired by \"The Far Side\" comic strip, the show starred Jeffrey Jones as a cartoonist who could materialize his wild imagination.\n\nLeslie began in films in the late 1980s with a bit part in the Richard Pryor comedy Moving - R√ºckw√§rts ins Chaos (1988) and followed it with the role of Iggy, a hunch-backed Igor counterpart, in the whacked horror spoof Monster Hospital (1988) starring comic actor Mark Blankfield as the mad doctor. In primarily low-budget film projects at the onset, Leslie was part of such off-the-wall material as Ski Academy (1990), Auf der Sonnenseite des Lebens (1991), Ein ganz normaler Held (1992), Jason goes to Hell - Die Endabrechnung (1993), Barcelona (1994), American Shrimps (1997) and Black Velvet Pantsuit (1995), to name a few.\n\nInto the 1990s, Leslie involved himself more and more into writing. Avid L.A. theatergoers would recognize him for such prone-to-misfit characters as Brother Boy, an institutionalized drag queen, in \"Sordid Lives,\" and Peanut, a habitual barfly, in \"Southern Baptist Sissies.\" His own one-man testimonials, such as the off-Broadway \"Hysterical Blindness\" and \"Like a Dog on Linoleum,\" display his adeptness at baring his soul and exposing his childhood agonies on stage amid laughter and tears. These highly introspective shows, however, came at a price. A self-proclaimed substance abuser and sexaholic, Jordan finally faced his inner demons and reached full recovery in 1996.\n\nTV was an exceptionally inviting medium over the years with a number of offbeat roles coming his way. Noted for his catchy guest work on such shows as Murphy Brown (1988), Superman: Die Abenteuer von Lois & Clark (1993), Caroline in the City (1995), Star Trek: Raumschiff Voyager (1995), and Lisa - Der helle Wahnsinn (1994), among many others, he was also a supporting regular on various series including the comedy Verducci & Sohn (1991) starring Joseph Bologna and pre-Friends (1994), Matt LeBlanc; the legal series Die Staatsanw√§ltin und der Cop (1991) in a season (1992-1993) as an assistant public defender; the crime drama Mord ohne Spuren (1992) starring Jennifer Hortin and George Clooney; and the John Ritter/Markie Post romantic comedy Staatsaff√§ren (1992).\n\nInto the millennium, he got to experienced the joy of seeing one of his own writing projects come to full fruition with the semi-autobiographical film Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel (2000). He was also given the chance to recreate his \"Big Brother\" role in Sordid Lives (2000) to the big screen. The work continued to flow in such film supports as John John in the Sky (2000), The Gristle (2001), Moving Alan (2003), the short film Farm Sluts (2003), Madhouse (2004), another short film Sissy Frenchfry (2005), Undead or Alive: A Zombedy (2007), Eating Out 3 - All You Can Eat (2009), Mangus! (2011), the critically-acclaimed [link=tt1454029, his stage role as \"Peanut\" in the gay-themed Southern Baptist Sissies (2013) written and directed by Del Shores, another co-star role as an HOA \"dictator\" in Whoa! (2013), Lucky Dog (2015), Fear, Inc. (2016), the \"Sordid Lives\" sequel A Very Sordid Wedding (2017) and the romantic film Until We Meet Again (2022).\n\nTV was even better to him with both delightful and sadly touching work on such series as Ally McBeal (1997), Boston Public (2000), F√ºr alle F√§lle Amy (1999), Monk (2002), Reba (2001), Boston Legal (2004), Alles Betty! (2006), Desperate Housewives (2004), Raising Hope (2010), and American Horror Story (2011). The topper, however, was Leslie's dryly cynical, part-time role as mincing elitist Beverley Leslie, the tiny thorn in Megan Mullally's backside on the resoundingly popular sitcom Will & Grace (1998). Leslie went on to earn an Emmy trading wicked barbs with Mullally's Karen character, playing the hilarity up for all its worth. He also appeared in the cult TV movie Sharknado 6 - The Last One (2018).\n\nBorn in New York City of humble means, character player James Coco was the son of Feliche, an Italian shoemaker, and Ida (Detestes) Coco. Shining shoes as a youngster with his father, his interest in acting occurred early on as a child. At age 17 he toured with a children's theatre troupe for three years portraying Old King Cole and Hans Brinker. Intensive study with acting guru Uta Hagen led to his Broadway debut at age 29 in \"Hotel Paradiso\" in 1957, but he earned his first acting award, an Obie, for his performance in the 1961 off-Broadway production of \"The Moon in Yellow River\". He went on to win a second and third Obie for his performances in the plays \"Fragments\" (1967) and \"The Transfiguration of Benno Blimppie\" (1977). Dark, hefty and prematurely balding, he proved to be a natural on the comedy stage and in scores of commercials (notably as Willy the plumber in the Drano ads) throughout the 1960s. Other comedy theater highlights included roles in \"Auntie Mame,\" \"Everybody Loves Opal,\" \"A Shot in the Dark,\" \"Bell, Book and Candle\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\".\n\nIn the late 60s he formed a strong collaboration with playwright Terrence McNally and appeared in an off-Broadway double-bill of his one-act plays (his one-act was entitled \"Witness\") in 1968, followed by \"Here's Where I Belong\" a failed 1968 Broadway musical variation of the Steinbeck play \"East of Eden\" that closed on opening night. Their most notable alliance occurred the following year with the play \"Next,\" which ran more than 700 performances and earned Coco a Drama Desk award. Sixteen years later, and shortly before Coco's death, the two reunited for the 1985 Manhattan Theatre Club production of \"It's Only a Play\".\n\nCoco also earned kudos for his work in Neil Simon comedies, and \"The Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" (1969), which was specifically written for him, earned him a Tony Award nomination as Best Actor. The two later joined forces for a Broadway revival of the musical \"Little Me\" and the hilarious film comedy spoofs Eine Leiche zum Dessert (1976) and Der Schmalspurschn√ºffler (1978), in addition to his moving support role as Marsha Mason's depressed gay actor/friend in Mrs. Hines & Tochter (1981), which garnered his sole Oscar nomination.\n\nAchieving stardom first on stage, Coco's other films were a mixed bag with more misses (Operation Pazifik (1964), Der Mann von La Mancha (1972) (as Sancho Panza), Wild Party (1975), Scavenger Hunt: Die total verr√ºckte Schnitzeljagd (1979)) than hits (Keiner killt so schlecht wie ich (1971)). On the TV screen, Coco fronted two short-lived 1970s comedy series, Calucci's Department (1973) and The Dumplings (1976), and also appeared in daytime soaps (The Edge of Night (1956) and \"The Guiding Light\"). Throughout his career he played an amusing number of characters on such sitcoms as Maude (1972) and Imbi√ü mit Bi√ü (1976) and also played bathos and pathos to great effect, not only winning an Emmy for his dramatic performance on a Chefarzt Dr. Westphall (1982) episode but appearing opposite Doris Roberts as the brittle Van Daan couple in the TV version of Das Tagebuch der Anne Frank (1980). One of his last TV assignments was a recurring role on the sitcom \"Who's The Boss?\" in 1986-1987.\n\nIn his last years, Coco received attention for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks. The James Coco Diet, an educational book which included chapters on menu planning and behavior modification as well as choice recipes), was just one that he promoted on the talk show circuit. It is probably not a coincidence that he often played characters with extreme food issues. Suffering from obesity (5'10\", 250 lbs.) for most his adult life, the talented actor died unexpectedly of a heart attack in New York City in 1987 at the age of 56, and was buried in St. Gertrude's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Colonia, New Jersey.\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers was born in Peoria, Illinois, to Margaret Elizabeth (Ogden) and Kenneth Truman Stiers. He moved with his family to Eugene, Oregon, where he graduated from North Eugene High School in 1960. At the age of twenty, he was offered $200 to join the company of the Santa Clara Shakespeare Festival for three months. He ended up staying for seven years, in due course playing both King Lear and Richard III. In 1969, he moved to New York to study drama at Juilliard where he also trained his voice as a dramatic baritone. He joined the Houseman City Center Acting Company at its outset, working on such productions as The Beggar's Opera, Measure for Measure, The Hostage and the hit Broadway musical The Magic Show for which he created the character 'Feldman the Magnificent'. He lent his voice to animated films, with Lilo & Stitch (2002) being his 25th theatrically-released Disney animated film. He was also an avid fan of classical music and conducted a number of orchestras, including the Yaquina Chamber Orchestra in Newport, Oregon, where was the principal guest conductor.\n\nHis other theatrical work included performances with the Committee Revue and Theatre, the San Francisco Actor's Workshop, The Old Globe Theatre Festival in San Diego and at the Pasadena Playhouse in Love Letters with Meredith Baxter. As a drama instructor, he worked at Santa Clara University and also taught improvisation at Harvard. In addition to his long-running role in M*A*S*H (1972), Stiers' work on television also included the excellent mini-series Fackeln im Sturm (1985), Fackeln im Sturm II (1986), Als Amerika nach Olympia kam (1984) and roles in such productions as Kampf gegen die Ausweglosigkeit (1984), Die Saat des B√∂sen (1985), J. Edgar Hoover (1987), Der Fall Nixon (1989), Father Damien: The Leper Priest (1980) and Mrs. Delafield will heiraten (1986). Among his screen credits were Die Reisen des Mr. Leary (1988), Der Verr√ºckte mit dem Geigenkasten (1985), Creator - Der Professor und die S√ºnde (1985), Harrys ganz privater Krieg (1981), Magic - Die Puppe des Grauens (1978) and Oh, Gott (1977).\n\nAbove all, the prodigious talent that was David Ogden Stiers will be most fondly remembered as the pompous, ever-so articulate Major Charles Emerson Winchester III in M*A*S*H. He had found that taking on the role was -- from the beginning -- an easy choice. Stiers saw and loved the movie version. Moreover, he had a fond regard of fellow actor Harry Morgan (who played the character of Colonel Potter) as a kind of fatherly role model. In retrospect, Stiers viewed his experiences with the show as a career highlight, saying \"No matter how much you read about the M*A*S*H company, the evolution of it, the quite beautiful human stance it takes, you will not know how much it means \". In his spare time on the set he often annoyed the security guards by skateboarding at 25 miles an hour and \"cheerfully thumbing his nose at them\".\n\nDavid died of bladder cancer on March 3, 2018, in Newport, Oregon. He was 75.\n\nSignifying intelligence, eloquence, versatility and quiet intensity, one of the more important, critically acclaimed black actors to gain a Hollywood foothold in the 1970s was Paul Winfield. He was born in 1939 in Dallas, Texas, where he lived in his early years before moving with his family to Los Angeles' Watts district. He showed early promise as a student at Manual Arts High School, earning distinction with several performance awards. As a senior, he earned his first professional acting job and extended his theatrical education with a two-year scholarship to the University of Portland in Oregon. Subsequent scholarships led to his studies at Stanford and Los Angeles City College, among other colleges. He left U.C.L.A. just six credits short of his Bachelor's degree.\n\nPaul's first big break came in 1964 when actor/director Burgess Meredith gave him a role in Le Roi Jones' controversial one-act play \"The Dutchman and the Toilet\". Director Meredith cast him again four years in \"The Latent Heterosexual\" with Zero Mostel. Although he won a contract at Columbia Pictures in 1966 and built up his on-camera career with a succession of television credits, he continued to focus on the legitimate stage. A member of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, he concentrated on both classic and contemporary plays. In 1969, Paul joined the Inner City Cultural Center Theatre in Los Angeles for two years, which offered a drama program for high school students.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Paul redirected himself back to performing on television and in films with guest work in more than 40 series on the small screen, including a boyfriend role on the first season of the landmark black sitcom Julia (1968) starring Diahann Carroll. In films, he was given a featured role in the Sidney Poitier film Es f√ºhrt kein Weg zur√ºck (1969), and earned comparable roles in Kampf den Talaren (1970) and Brother John (1971) before major stardom occurred.\n\n1972 proved to be a banner year for Paul after winning the male lead opposite Cicely Tyson in the touching classic film Das Jahr ohne Vater (1972). His towering performance as a sharecropper who is imprisoned and tortured for stealing a ham for his impoverished family earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" -- the third black actor (Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones preceded him) to receive such an honor at the time.\n\nFrom there a host of films and quality television roles began arriving on his doorstep. In mini-movies, Paul portrayed various historical/entertainment giants including Thurgood Marshall, Don King and baseball's Roy Campanella, and was Emmy-nominated for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in King (1978) with Sounder co-star Cicely Tyson as wife Coretta. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he earned solid distinction in such prestige projects as Wei√ües Haus, Hintereingang (1979), Roots - Die n√§chsten Generationen (1979) (another Emmy nomination), The Sophisticated Gents (1981), Die Blauen und die Grauen (1982), Sister, Sister (1982), James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Goodbye America (1986) and The Women of Brewster Place (1989).\n\nAlthough the big screen did not offer the same consistent quality following his breakthrough with Sounder, he nevertheless turned in strong roles in Conrack (1974), Huckleberry Finn (1974), A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1977) (again with Ms. Tyson), Stra√üe der Verdammnis (1977), Star Trek II - Der Zorn des Khan (1982) and Der wei√üe Hund von Beverly Hills (1982).\n\nSurprisingly, Paul never achieved the promise of a Sidney Poitier-like stardom and his roles diminished in size. Relegated to character roles, he still appeared in such quality television as Maggie, Maggie! (1994), although he was not the major focus. After two nominations, he finally won the Emmy for a guest performance as a judge on Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992). Paul's showier work at this period of time included the film Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999) and a surprise cross-dressing cameo as Aunt Matilda in Relax... It's Just Sex (1998).\n\nOn stage, Paul graced such productions as \"Richard III\" (at New York's Lincoln Center Theatre), \"Othello\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"The Seagull\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"Happy Endings\" and \"Checkmates\", which became his sole Broadway credit. Paul also served as Artist in Residence at the University of Hawaii and subsequently at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nIn his final years, Winfield narrated the A&E crime series City Confidential (1998), appeared as a teacher in a television adaptation of his earlier success Sounder (2003), and enjoyed a recurring role as Sam for many years on the series Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994).\n\nSuffering from obesity and diabetes in later life, Paul Winfield passed away from a heart attack at age 64 in 2004, and was survived by a sister, Patricia. His longtime companion of 30 years, set designer and architect Charles Gillan Jr. predeceased him by two years.\n\nThe son of a surveyor, Charles Gray was born and raised in Queen's Park, Bournemouth. As a young actor, he received his vocal training from the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Old Vic, having long abandoned his first job as clerk for a real estate agent. His voice was to become one of his most valuable tools. In fact, from January 1966, he subtly, almost imperceptibly, dubbed for Jack Hawkins after this actor became unable to speak his lines due to throat cancer. In later years, Gray's trademark voice was regularly heard on television commercials.\n\nGray's theatrical debut came in 1952 in the part of Charles the Wrestler (he measured 6 foot, 1 inches in height) in \"As You Like It\", appearing under his original name, 'Donald Gray'. From 1956, as 'Charles' Gray (since there already was a one-armed actor named Donald Gray), he took to leading dramatic roles, and won critical plaudits as Achilles in \"Troilus and Cressida\", Macduff in \"Macbeth\" and as the gluttonous Sir Epicure Mammon in Tyrone Guthrie's up-dated version of \"The Alchemist\", in 1962. He repeated his Old Vic performance as Henry Bolingbroke for his Broadway debut at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1956. A notable later performance, while touring the U.S. and Canada, was as the Prince of Wales in Peter Stone's tale of the famous 19th century actor Edmund Kean (\"Kean\", 1961). In 1964, Gray won the Clarence Derwent Award as Best Supporting Actor for his part in the controversial play \"Poor Bitos\", by Jean Anouilh, co-starring Donald Pleasence. He was offered his first role on the big screen, reprising a success on the West End stage in 1958, as Captain Cyril Mavors,in the satirical musical Expresso Bongo (1959).\n\nFor the next forty years, heavy-set, silver-haired, jut-jawed Charles Gray used his imposing frame and mellifluous voice to great effect in creating for the screen a memorable gallery of egocentric, imperious toffs, and suave, sardonic super-villains. While his performances at times verged on the camp, Gray cheerfully allowed himself to be cast within his range of basically unsympathetic characters, which he could play well and with ease. He tended to favour television as his preferred medium, though some of his most popular roles were for the big screen. Among his niche of staple characters were the coldly pompous military heavies (General Gabler in Die Nacht der Generale (1967), or the perpetually sneering, overbearing upper-class twits (true-to-form, as defecting spy Hillary Vance in the Thriller (1973) episode \"Night is the Time for Killing\"). At his evil best, he was commanding as the demonic acolyte Mocata, in Die Braut des Teufels (1968) and as the feline-stroking, velvety-voiced nemesis of James Bond, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in Diamantenfieber (1971). He was also suitably sinister as Bates the Butler, one of the red herrings of Agatha Christie's Mord im Spiegel (1980).\n\nGray's recurring roles included Lord Seacroft (senior, as well as junior) in the short-lived satirical miniseries The Upper Crusts (1973) as a down-on-his-heels aristocrat, keeping up appearances after being forced to live in a high-rise housing estate; and as the sedentary brother of the famous sleuth at 221b Baker Street, Mycroft, in Kein Koks f√ºr Sherlock Holmes (1976). Later, he was utilised as temporary replacement, first for Edward Hardwicke,and, subsequently, for the hospitalised star Jeremy Brett, in Granada Television's various instalments of the Sherlock Holmes saga (1985-1994). Gray died of cancer in March 2000, aged 71.\n\nVan Johnson was the fresh-faced, well-mannered nice guy on screen you always wanted your daughter to marry! This fair, freckled and invariably friendly-looking MGM song-and-dance star of the 40s emerged a box office favorite (1944-1946) and second only to heartthrob Frank Sinatra during what gossip monger Hedda Hopper dubbed the \"Bobby-soxer Blitz\" era. Johnson's musical timing proved just as adroit as his legit career timing for he was able to court WWII stardom as a regimented MGM symbol of the war effort with an impressive parade of earnest soldiers. He may have been a second tier musical star behind the likes of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, but his easy smile, wholesome, boy-next-door appeal and strawberry-blond good looks made him a solid box-office attraction while MGM's \"big boys\" were off to war.\n\nBorn Charles Van Dell Johnson in Newport, Rhode Island, on August 25, 1916, Van was the only child of Loretta (Snyder) and Charles E. Johnson. His paternal grandparents were Swedish, and his mother was of German, and a small amount of Irish, ancestry. Johnson endured a lonely and unhappy childhood as the sole offspring of an extremely aloof father (who was both a plumber and real estate agent by trade) and an absentee mother (she abandoned the family when he was three, the victim of alcoholism). A paternal grandmother helped in raising the young lad. Happier times were spent drifting into the fantasy world of movies, and he developed an ardent passion to entertain. Taking singing, dancing and violin lessons during his high school years, he disregarded his father's wish to become a lawyer and instead left home following graduation to try his luck in New York.\n\nEarly experiences included chorus lines in revues, at hotels and in various small shows around town. A couple of minor breaks occurred with his 40-week stint in the \"New Faces of 1936\" revue (making his Broadway debut) and in a vaudeville club act (based around star Mary Martin) called \"Eight Young Men of Manhattan\" that played the Rainbow Room. He served as understudy to the three male leads of Rodgers and Hart's popular musical \"Too Many Girls\" in October of 1939 and eventually replaced one of them (actor Richard Kollmar left the show to marry reporter Dorothy Kilgallen.) He also formed a lifelong and career-igniting friendship with one of the other leads, Desi Arnaz.\n\nJohnson made an inauspicious film debut with Arnaz in Too Many Girls (1940) when the musical was eventually lensed in Hollywood, but he was cast in a scant chorus boy part. Following a stint on Broadway in \"Pal Joey\" in 1940, Warner Bros. signed Van to a six-month contract. He went on to co-star with Faye Emerson in Murder in the Big House (1942), but they dropped him quickly feeling that his acting chops were lacking. It was Arnaz's wife Lucille Ball, who had recently signed with MGM, who introduced Van to Billy Grady, MGM's casting head, and instigated a successful screen test.\n\nWith the studio's top male talent off to war, Van (along with Peter Lawford) served as an earnest substitute donning fatigues in such stalwart movies as Somewhere I'll Find You (1942) The War Against Mrs. Hadley (1942) and ...und das Leben geht weiter (1943). In addition, he replaced actor/war pacifist Lew Ayres in the \"Dr. Kildare/Dr. Gillespie\" film series after Ayres was unceremoniously dumped by the studio for his unpopular beliefs.\n\nStardom came, and at quite a price, for Van when he was cast yet again as a wholesome serviceman in Kampf in den Wolken (1943). During the early part of filming, he was severely injured in a near-fatal car crash (he had a metal plate inserted in his skull, which instantly gave him a 4-F disqualification status for war service). Endangered of being replaced on the film, the two stars of the picture, Spencer Tracy (who became another lifelong friend) and Irene Dunne, insisted that the studio work around his convalescence or they would quit the film. The unusually kind gesture made Van a star following the film's popular release and resulting publicity. Van's career soared during the war years, making him and Lawford the resident heartthrobs not only in musicals (Mein Schatz ist ein Matrose (1944), Eine Falle f√ºr die Braut (1946)), but in airy comedies (Weekend im Waldorf (1945)) and, of course, more war stories (Drei√üig Sekunden √ºber Tokio (1944)).\n\nWhen the big stars such as Clark Gable, James Stewart and Robert Taylor returned to reclaim post-war stardom, Van willingly relinquished his \"golden boy\" pedestal, but he remained a high profile musical star opposite the likes of June Allyson, Esther Williams and Judy Garland. He continued to demonstrate his dramatic mettle in such well-regarded films as Command Decision (1948), Der beste Mann (1948), Kesselschlacht (1949), Brigadoon (1954) and Die Caine war ihr Schicksal (1954) and remained a popular star for three more decades. When MGM's \"golden age\" phased out by the mid-1950s, Van's movie career took a sharp decline and the studio released him after he co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor in Damals in Paris (1954).\n\nWhile Van continued working as a freelancer in such as the English-made Das Ende einer Affaire (1955) with Deborah Kerr; Miracle in the Rain (1956) opposite Jane Wyman, Gefangene des Stroms (1956) with Joseph Cotten, 23 Schritte zum Abgrund (1956) co-starring Vera Miles, Kelly and Me (1956) partnered with a dog, and Jenseits des Rechts (1959), he again capitalized on his musical talents by reinventing himself as a nightclub performer and musical stage star on the regional and dinner theater circuits, including \"The Music Man,\" \"Damn Yankees,\" \"Guys and Dolls,\" \"Bells Are Ringing,\" \"On a Clear Day...,\" \"Forty Carats,\" \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" and \"I Do! I Do!\"\n\nVan delved heavily into TV from the late 1960's on and served as a guest on such shows as \"Laugh-In,\" \"The Name of the Game,\" \"The Red Skelton Show,\" \"Nanny and the Professor,\" \"The Virginian,\" \"The Doris Day Show,\" \"Love, American Style,\" \"Maude,\" \"Quincy,\" \"McMillan & Wife,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island\" and \"Murder, She Wrote.\" He earned an Emmy nomination for his participation in the mini-series Reich & arm (1976), and co-starred or was featured in such TV movies as Call Her Mom (1972), Superdome (1978), Black Beauty (1978), Deine Braut geh√∂rt mir (1978) and Three Days to a Kill (1992).\n\nIn later years, he grew larger in girth but still continued to work. He earned respectable reviews after replacing Gene Barry as Georges in the smash gay musical \"La Cage Aux Folles\" in 1985. His last musical role was as Cap' Andy in \"Show Boat\" in 1991, and his last several movies were primarily filmed overseas in Italy and Australia. Occasional featured roles on film in later years included Das Concorde Inferno (1979), Die Entf√ºhrung des Pr√§sidenten (1980), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Der Alligator (1989), Delta Force Commando 2 (1990) and Clowning Around (1992).\n\nVan was married only once but it was the constant source of tabloid news. Typically in the closet as a high-ranking actor of the 1940s, he was extremely close friends with fellow MGM actor Keenan Wynn and his wife. Shockingly, Van wound up marrying Wynn's ex-wife, one-time stage actress Evie Wynn Johnson, immediately after the Wynn's divorced in 1947. Van and Eve went on to have one child, daughter Schuyler, in 1948, and were a popular Hollywood couple before separating after fifteen years of marriage. The marriage ended acrimoniously in 1968 and decades later Eve published a statement (after her death in 2004) confirming suspicions that MGM had engineered their marriage to cover up Johnson's homosexuality. In declining health, Van, who was estranged from his only child, died at age 92 on December 12, 2008, at a senior living facility in Nyack, New York.\n\nBefore there was a George Lucas and Harrison Ford running around creating special-effects excitement, there was a virile, boyishly handsome actor named Kerwin Mathews who was entertaining audiences battling a variety of creatures courtesy of pioneer special effects guru Ray Harryhausen. Harryhausen's legendary monsters of the late 50s and early 60s earned cult film infamy and it was those wondrous storybook fantasies and the Harryhausen association that also put Kerwin on the Hollywood map.\n\nBorn an only child in Seattle, Washington, on January 8, 1926, Kerwin's parents split up while he was quite young and he and his mother relocated to Janesville, Wisconsin. He developed an early interest in acting while performing in high school plays. Following a couple of years in the Army Air Force during WWII, Kerwin studied at Beloit College in Wisconsin on both dramatic and musical scholarships. He later taught speech and drama at the college and also found acting jobs in regional theater. In the early 1950s, after teaching high school English in Lake Geneva, Wisconin, for a few years, he decided to make the big trek to Hollywood to seek out his fame and fortune.\n\nWhile training at the Pasadena Playhouse, Kerwin met a casting agent for Columbia Pictures and was eventually signed to a seven-year contact after winning over the approval of studio boss Harry Cohn. Finding a number of roles on TV, he acquitted himself quite well with his film debut in 5 Against the House (1955) as one of four college pals (the others being Guy Madison, Brian Keith and Alvy Moore) who decide to carry out a faux casino robbery in Las Vegas, a plan that backfires badly. The offbeat ensemble picture drew good reviews and Kerwin was off and running.\n\nFollowing decent showings in the crime yarn Ums nackte Leben (1957) and war flick Br√ºckenkopf Tarawa (1958), he found respect as a middleweight talent, but truly came into his own in the Saturday afternoon-styled adventure fantasies popular with the school crowd. An agile fencer with fine all-American looks, he won the opportunity to play the role of the dauntless hero in Columbia's classic Sindbads siebente Reise (1958). Out to rescue fair damsel Kathryn Grant (who later became Mrs. Bing Crosby), he battled everything in his path -- from a colossal, one-eyed Cyclops to a fire-spewing dragon. The final climactic battle scene was his Errol Flynn / Basil Rathbone-like swordplay against a dexterous, sword-swinging skeleton, all courtesy of Harryhausen.\n\nKerwin worked with Harryhausen's stop-motion creations again in Die drei Welten des Gulliver (1960) as a doctor whose foes this time around included a giant squirrel and alligator. He then played the countrified folk legend Der Herrscher von Cornwall (1962) and again found himself saving a princess while pitted against evil wizards and other specially-designed effects (by Jim Danforth). Other less arduous films he made included the WWII war drama The Last Blitzkrieg (1959) with Van Johnson, the crime thriller Geheimakte M (1960) with Ernest Borgnine and his third-billed role behind Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra in Der Teufel kommt um vier (1961) in which he and Tracy played priests.\n\nBy the early 1960s Kerwin was typecast in adventure tales and was now searching for work overseas to display his stoic heroics, though his efforts were mostly for naught in such empty spectacles as Italy's Sappho, Venus von Lesbos (1960) [\"The Warrior Princess\"] opposite Gilligans Insel (1964) star Tina Louise; England's Die Piraten am Todesfluss (1962); and the Franco-Italian co-production OSS 117 - Heisse H√∂lle Bangkok (1964) [\"Panic in Bangkok\"]. He fared somewhat better in the British-made Die Ausgekochten (1963) in a change-of-pace role and received some of his best notices on TV playing composer Johann Strauss Jr. in Disney's 1963 TV biopic The Waltz King: Part 1 (1963) (and \"Part 2\").\n\nKerwin's career ended in 1978 after making a small sprinkling of appearances in low-budget sci-fi and horror films, plus some TV guest appearances throughout the decade. By this time he had already moved to San Francisco and spent his later years selling antiques and furniture. He was also a stalwart patron of the arts and supporter of the city's various opera and ballet companies. Kerwin died overnight in his sleep at age 81 in his San Francisco home, survived by his partner of 46 years Tom Nicoll.\n\nHe was a master class in cerebral eloquence and audience command...and although his dominant playing card in the realm of acting was quite serious and stately, nobody cut a more delightfully dry edge in sitcoms than this gentleman, whose calm yet blistering put-downs often eluded his lesser victims.\n\nActing titan Roscoe Lee Browne was born to a Baptist minister and his wife on May 2, 1922, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He attended Lincoln University, an historically black university in Pennsylvania until 1942, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he served in Italy with the Negro 92nd Infantry Division and organized the Division's track and field team. He graduated from Lincoln University in 1946, and studied French through Middlebury College's summer language program. He received his master's degree from Columbia University, then subsequently returned to Lincoln and taught French and comparative literature, seemingly destined to settle in completely until he heard a different calling.\n\nRoscoe relished his first taste of adulation and admiration as a track star, competing internationally and winning the world championship in the 800-yard dash in 1951. He parlayed that attention into a job as a sales representative for a wine and liquor importer. In 1956, he abruptly decided to become an actor. And he did. With no training but a shrewd, innate sense of self, he boldly auditioned for, and won, the role of the Soothsayer in \"Julius Caesar\" the very next day at the newly-formed New York Shakespeare Festival. He never looked back and went on to perform with the company in productions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Othello\", \"King Lear\" (as the Fool), and \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nBlessed with rich, mellifluous tones and an imposing, cultured air, Roscoe became a rare African-American fixture on the traditionally white classical stage. In 1961 he appeared notably with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway cast of Jean Genet's landmark play \"The Blacks\". Awards soon came his way -- the first in the form of an Obie only a few years later for his portrayal of a rebellious slave in \"The Old Glory\". Additionally, he received the Los Angeles Drama Critic's Circle Award for both \"The Dream on Monkey Mountain\" (1970) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" (1989). Roscoe found less successful ventures on 1960s Broadway, taking his first curtain call in \"A Cool World\" in 1960, which folded the next day. He graced a number of other short runs including \"General Seegar\" (1962), \"Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright\" (1962), \"The Ballad of the Sade Cafe\" (1964), \"Danton's Death\" (1965), and \"A Hand Is on the Gate: An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music\" (1966), which he also wrote and directed. He did not return to Broadway until 1983 with the role of the singing Rev. J.D. Montgomery in Tommy Tune's smash musical \"My One and Only\" in which his number \"Kicking the Clouds Away\" proved to be one of many highlights. Roscoe returned only once more to Broadway, earning acclaim and a Tony nomination for his supporting performance in August Wilson's \"Two Trains Running\" (1992).\n\nAlthough he made an isolated debut with The Connection (1961), he wouldn't appear regularly in films until the end of the decade with prominent parts in the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film, Die Stunde der Kom√∂dianten (1967), Jules Dassin's Black Power (1968), Hitchcock's Topas (1969) and, his most notable, Die Glut der Gewalt (1970). Thereafter, he complimented a host of features, both comedic and dramatic, including Superfly (1972) (and its sequel), Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974), Flucht ins 23. Jahrhundert (1976), Staatsanw√§lte k√ºsst man nicht (1986), Mambo Kings (1992) and Hilfe, ich komm' in den Himmel (1996)\n\nElsewhere, Roscoe's disdainful demeanor courted applause on all the top 70s sitcoms including \"All in the Family\", \"Maude,\" \"Sanford and Son\", \"Good Times\" and \"Barney Miller\" (Emmy-nominated), and he played the splendidly sardonic role of Saunders, the Tate household butler, after replacing Robert Guillaume's popular \"Benson\" character on Die Ausgeflippten (1977). In 1986 he won an Emmy Award for his guest appearance on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). His trademark baritone lent authority and distinction to a number of documentaries, live-action fare, and animated films, as well as the spoken-word arena, with such symphony orchestras as the Boston Pops and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to his credit. A preeminent recitalist, he was known for committing hundreds of poems to memory. For many years he and actor Anthony Zerbe toured the U.S. with their presentation of \"Behind the Broken Words\", an evening of poetry and dramatic readings.\n\nAt the time of his death of cancer on April 11, 2007, the never-married octogenarian was still omnipresent, more heard than seen perhaps. Among his last works was his narrations of a Garfield film feature and the most recent movie spoof Fantastic Movie (2007)."
