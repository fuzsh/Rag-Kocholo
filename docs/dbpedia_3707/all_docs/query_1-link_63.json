        "text": "Corpus of Electronic Texts Edition\n\nTáin Bó Cúalnge Recension 1 (Author: [unknown])\n\np.125\n\nTáin Bó Cúailnge\n\nA great army was mustered by the Connachtmen, that is, by Ailill and Medb, and word went from them to the three other provinces. And Ailill sent messengers to the seven sons of Mágu: Ailill, Anlúan, Moccorb, Cet, Én, Bascall and Dóche, each with his fighting force of three thousand, and also to Cormac Conn Longas the son of Conchobor, who was billeted with his three hundred men in Connacht. They all came on then until they reached Crúachain Aí\n\nNow Cormac's men were in three companies as they marched to Crúachain. The first band wore vari-coloured cloaks wrapped around them. Their hair was shorn. They had tunics falling to the knee. They carried long shields, and each man bore in his hand a broad, bright spear on a slender shaft. The second band wore dark-grey cloaks and red-embroidered tunics reaching down to their calves. Their long hair hung down behind. They carried white shields, and in their hands they bore five-pronged spears. It is not Cormac as yet, said Medb.\n\nThen came the third band. They wore purple cloaks and hooded red-embroidered tunics reaching to their feet. Their trimmed hair fell down to their shoulders. They bore curved shields with scalloped rims, and each man carried a spear as great as the pillar of a palace in his hand. This is Cormac now, said Medb.\n\nSo then the four provinces of Ireland were gathered together in Crúachain Aí. Their prophets and druids did not permit them to go thence, but kept them for a fortnight awaiting an auspicious omen. Then, on the day that they set forth, Medb said to her charioteer:\n\np.126\n\n{translation of lines 25-62} All those who part here today from comrade and friend will curse me for it is I who have mustered this hosting. Wait then, said the charioteer, until the chariot has turned right- handwise to strengthen the good omen so that we may come back again.\n\nWhen the charioteer turned back the chariot and they were about to descend, they saw in front of them a grown maiden. She had yellow hair. She wore a vari- coloured cloak with a golden pin in it and a hooded tunic with red embroidery. She had shoes with golden fastenings. Her face was oval, narrow below, broad above. Her eyebrows were dark and black. Her beautiful black eyelashes cast a shadow on to the middle of her cheeks. Her lips seemed to be made of partaing. Her teeth were like a shower of pearls between her lips. She had three plaits of hair: two plaits wound around her head, the third hanging down her back, touching her calves behind. In her hand she carried a weaver's beam of white bronze, with golden inlay. There were three pupils in each of her eyes. The maiden was armed and her chariot was drawn by two black horses.\n\nWhat is your name, asked Medb of the maiden. I am Feidelm, the poetess of Connacht, said the maiden. Whence do you come? asked Medb. From Albion after learning the art of divination, answered the maiden. Have you the power of prophecy called imbas forosna? I have indeed, said the maiden. Look for me then and tell me how it will fare with my hosting. Then the maiden looked and Medb said: O Feidelm Prophetess, how do you see the fate of the army? Feidelm answered and said: I see it bloody, I see it red. That is not so, said Medb, for Conchobor lies in his debility in Emain together with the Ulstermen and all the mightiest of their warriors, and my messengers have come and brought me tidings of them. O Feidelm Prophetess, how do you see our host? asked Medb again. I see it blood-stained, I see it red, said the maiden. That is not so, said Medb, for Celtchar mac Uthidir is in Dún Lethglaise together with a third of the men of Ulster, and Fergus mac Roeich meic Echdach is here in exile with us with three thousand men. O Feidelm Prophetess, how do you see our host? I see it blood-stained, I see it red, answered the maiden. That matters not indeed, said Medb, for in every muster and in every army assembled in a great encampment there are quarrels and\n\np.127\n\n{translation of lines 63-106} strife and bloody woundings. So look once more for us, and tell us the truth. O Feidelm Prophetess, how do you see our host?\n\nI see it blood-stained, I see it red, said Feidelm and she spoke as follows:\n\nI see a fair man who will perform weapon-feats, with many a wound in his flesh. A hero's light is on his brow. His forehead is the meeting-place of many virtues.\n\nIn each of his eyes are the seven jewel-bright pupils of a hero. His spearpoints(?) are unsheathed. He wears a red mantle with clasps.\n\nHis face is beautiful. He amazes women-folk.This lad of handsome countenance looks in the battle like a dragon.\n\nLike is his prowess to that of Cú Chulainn of Murthemne.I know not who is this Cú Chulainn of fairest fame, but this I do know, that by him the army will be bloodily wounded.\n\nI see a tall man in the plain who gives battle to the host. In each hand he holds four small swords with which to perform great deeds.\n\nHe attacks with his gáe bolga and also with his ivory-hilted sword and his spear. He can ply them on the host. Each weapon as he casts it has its own special use.\n\nThis man wrapped in a red mantle sets his foot on every battle-field. Across the left wheel-rim of his chariot he attacks them. The distorted one kills them. I see that he has changed from the form in which hitherto he has appeared to me.\n\nHe has moved forward to the battle. Unless heed be taken, there will be destruction. I think that it is Cú Chulainn mac Súaldaim who now comes to you.\n\nHe will lay low your entire army. He will slaughter you in dense crowds. Ye will leave with him a thousand severed heads. The prophetess Feidelm does not conceal your fate.\n\np.128\n\n{translation of lines 107-138}\n\nBlood will flow from heroes' bodies. Much harm will be wrought by the hand of this hero. He will kill warriors; the men of Clanna Dedad meic Sin will flee. Men's bodies will be hacked and women will weep because of the Hound of the Smith whom I now see.\n\na.\n\nOn the Monday after the autumn festival of Samain they set out. They travelled south-east from Crúachain Aí, past Mucc Cruinb, past Terloch Teóra Crích, past Túaim Móna, past Cúil Silinne\n\ni.e. Loch Carrcín\", and got its name from Silend daughter of Madchar\n\n, past Fid, past Bolga, past Coltain, past Glune Gabair, past Mag Trego, past northern Tethbab\n\ni.e. Cairpre\n\n, past southern Tethba, past Tíarthechta, past Ord, southwards past Slais, past Indeóind, past Carn, past Ochtrach, past Mide, past Findglassa Assail, past Delt, past Delind, past Sailig, past Slaibre, past Slechta (where they hewed down the trees), past Cúil Sibrinne, southwards past Ochuinn, northwards past Úata, past Dub, southwards past Comur, past Tromma and eastwards past Fothromma, past Sláne and Gort Sláni, southwards past Druim Licce, past Áth Gabla, past Ardachad, northwards past Féraind, past Findabair, southwards past Aisse, past Druim Sálfind, past Druim Caín, past Druim mac nDega, past Eódond Mór and Eódond Bec, past Méthe Tog[maill] and Méthe Eóin; past Druim Cáemtechta, past Scúap and Imscúap, past Cend Ferna, past Baile, past Aile, past Báil Scena and Dáil Scena, past Ferste, past Ross Lochad, past Sále, past Lochmach, past Ánmag, past Deind, past Delt, past Dubglais, past Fid Mór\n\ni.e. Trúalli\"\n\n, past Colptha, past Crond in Cúailnge. From Findabair in Cúailnge the armies of Ireland spread out over the province in quest of the Bull. For they had gone past all these places before reaching Findabair.\n\nHere ends the introductory part. The story in due order now begins.\n\nThe Story in Due Order\n\nWhen they had come on the first stage of their journey from Crúachain to Cúil Silinne, the site of Loch Cairrcín today, Medb told her charioteer to harness her nine chariots\n\nShe was always accompanied by nine chariots, so that the dust raised by the great army should not soil her\n\nfor her that she might\n\np.129\n\n{translation of lines 139-173} drive around the encampment and see who among them was reluctant and who was glad to go on the hosting. Now his tent was pitched for Ailill and his equipment was placed therein, both beds and blankets. Fergus mac Róich was next to Ailill in his tent. Cormac Conn Longas, son of Conchobor, was next to him. Then came Conall Cernach, with Fíacha mac Fir Fhebe, the son of Conchobor's daughter, beside him. Medb, the daughter of Eochu Feidlech was on the other side of Ailill, with Finnabair, the daughter of Ailill and Medb, beside her and Flidais next to Finnabair. This was not counting the servants and attendants.\n\nAfter she had surveyed the host, Medb came back and said that it would be vain for the rest to go on that expedition if the division of the Gailióin went also. Why do you belittle the men? asked Ailill. I am not belittling them, said Medb. They are splendid warriors. When the others were making their shelters, the Gailióin had already finished thatching their shelters and cooking their food. When the rest were eating, they had already finished their meal and their harpers were playing to them. So it is useless for them to go on this expedition, said Medb, for it is they who will take credit for the victory of the army. Yet it is for us they fight, said Ailill. They shall not go with us, said Medb. Let them stay here then, said Ailill. Indeed they shall not, said Medb. They will overpower us when we have come back and seize our land. Well then, what shall be done with them, asked Ailill, since neither their staying nor their going pleases you? Kill them! said Medb.\n\nI shall not deny that is a woman's counsel, said Ailill. You speak foolishly, said Fergus in a low voice. It shall not happen unless we are all killed, for they are allies of us Ulstermen. Nevertheless, said Medb, we could do it. For I have here with me my own household retinue numbering two divisions, and the seven Maines are here, my seven sons, with seven divisions. Their luck can protect them, said she. Their names are Maine Máthramail, Maine Aithremail, Maine Mórgor, Maine Mingor, Maine Mo Epirt, who is also called Maine Milscothach, Maine Andóe and Maine Cotageib Uilehe it is who has inherited the appearance of his mother and his father and the dignity of them both \n\nThat will not be, said Fergus, There are here seven kings from Munster, allies of us Ulstermen, and a division with each king.\n\np.130\n\n{translation of lines 174-209} I shall give you battle in the middle of the encampment where we now are, supported by those seven divisions, by my own division and by the division of the Gailióin. But I shall not argue the point, said Fergus. We shall arrange the warriors of the Gailióin so that they shall not prevail over the rest of the army. Seventeen divisions, said Fergus, is the number here in our encampment, not counting the camp-followers and our boys and our women- folkfor each chief here in Medb's company has brought his wife. The eighteenth division is that of the Gailióin. Let them be distributed throughout all the host. I care not, said Medb, provided that they do not remain in the close battle array in which they now are. This then was done; the Gailióin were distributed among the host. Next morning they set out for Móin Choltna. There they met with eight score deer in a single herd. They encircled them and killed them. Wherever there was a man of the Gailióin, it was he who got a deer, for the rest of the host got only five of the deer. They came on then to Mag Trego and there they encamped and prepared food for themselves.\n\nAccording to one version it was then that Dubthach chanted this lay:\n\nAdmit that hitherto ye have not heard nor listened to the trance-speech of Dubthach. A fierce hosting lies before you, contending for Findbenn, the bull of Ailill's wife.\n\nThere will come a leader of armies who will try to recover the cattle of Murthemne. Because of the companionship of the two swineherds, ravens on the battle-field will drink men's blood.\n\nThe watchful river Crann will offer them resistance and will not let them cross into Murthemne until the work of warriors is finished in the mountain north of Ochaíne.\n\nQuickly, said Ailill to Cormac, come and hold back your son. None comes from the plains where the cattle graze but is affrighted(?) by the din of the army.\n\nIn due course a battle will be fought here with Medb and a third of the army. Men's corpses will then lie here if the distorted one come to you.\n\np.131\n\n{lines 210-251} Thereupon the Némain, that is, the war-goddess, attacked them. That was not the quietest of nights for them with the trance-speech of the boorish Dubthach as he slept. The hosts rose up at once and the army was thrown into confusion until Medb came and quelled them.\n\nThen, after the army had been led astray across bogs and streams, they went and spent the night in Granard in northern Tethba. For the sake of kinship Fergus sent a warning to the Ulstermen who were still suffering from their debility, all except Cú Chulainn and his father Súaltaim. When the warning message had come from Fergus, Cú Chulainn and his father went as far as Irard Cuillenn, that is, Crossa Cail, there to watch for the enemy host. I have a premonition that the host will arrive tonight, said Cú Chulainn to his father. Take a warning from us to the men of Ulster. I must go to Feidelm Noíchridehe meant to tryst with her handmaiden who was secretly Cú Chulainn's concubineto fulfil my own pledge which I gave her. Then before he went, he twisted a withe into a ring and wrote an ogam inscription on its peg, and cast it over the top of a pillar-stone. Then Fergus was given the task of leading the army along the path. He went far astray to the south to give the Ulstermen time to complete the mustering of their army. This he did out of affection for his own kin.\n\nAilill and Medb noticed this, and Medb said:\n\nO Fergus, this is strange. What manner of path do we travel? We go astray to south and to north, past every strange district.\n\nAilill of Mag Aí with his army fears that you will betray him. Until now he heeded not where the path led.\n\nIf you feel the pull of kinship, do not lead horses any longer. Perhaps someone else may be found to guide us on our way.\n\nFergus answered:\n\nO Medb, what perturbs you? This is not anything resembling treachery. O woman, the land across which I shall lead you belongs to the men of Ulster.\n\nNot with intent to harm the hosting do I go in turn along each devious road, but that I may avoid the great one who guards Mag Murthemne.\n\np.132\n\n{translation of lines 252-292}\n\nIt is not to save my mind from weariness that I go thus aside from the path, but I am trying to avoid meeting Cú Chulainn mac Súaltaim even at a later time.\n\nThey went on then to Irard Cuilenn, today called Crossa Caíl. The four sons of Irard mac Anchinnel\n\nor the four sons of Nera mac Núada meic Taccain, as is found in other versions\n\n, Eirr and Indell with Foich and Fochlam their two charioteers, were those who always preceded the hosts to protect their brooches and their rugs and their mantles that the dust raised by the army might not soil them. These men found the withe Cú Chulainn had cast and they noticed the grazing made by the horses. For Súaltaim's two horses had cropped the grass to its roots in the earth while Cú Chulainn's horses had licked the soil down to the bedrock beneath the grass. Then these four men sat still till the host came up, and their musicians played to them. They handed the withe to Fergus mac Róich; he read out the ogam inscription that was on it.\n\nWhen Medb arrived she asked: Why are you waiting here? We are waiting, said Fergus, because of yonder withe. There is on its peg an ogam inscription which reads: Let none go past till there be found a man to throw a withe made of one branch as it is in the same way with one hand. But I except my friend Fergus. In truth, said Fergus, it is Cú Chulainn who has cast it and it is his horses which grazed this plain. And he put the withe in the druid's hand and chanted this song:\n\nHere is a withe. What is its message for us? What is its secret meaning? And how many put it there? Was it few or many?\n\nWill it bring ruin on the army if they go past it? Find out, O ye druids, why the withe was left there.\n\nA druid answered:\n\nA hero cast it there, the swift cutting(?) of a hero, a source of perplexity to warriors, containment of chiefs with their followers. One man cast it there with one hand.\n\nDoes not the king's army obey him unless they have broken faith? I know no reason why the withe was cast there save that one of you should cast a withe even as one man did.\n\nId inso.c.s.\n\np.133\n\n{translation of lines 293-326}\n\nThen said Fergus to them If ye flout this withe or if ye go past it, though it be in a man's possession or in a locked house, it will go after the man who wrote the ogam inscription, and he will kill one of you before morning unless one of you cast a withe in like manner. We do not wish, however, that any one of us should be killed straight away, said Ailill. Let us go to the end of yon great wood to the south of us, Fid Dúin. We shall go no farther than that. The army then hewed down the wood to make a path for the chariots. That place is called Slechta. It is there that the Partraige (now) live.\n\nAccording to others, however, it was here that the dialogue between Medb and Feidelm Banfháith as we have related above took place, and it was after the answer Feidelm made to Medb that the wood was cut down. Thus: Look for me, said Medb, (to see) how will my expedition fare. It is hard for me, said the maiden. The wood prevents me from seeing them properly. That can be arranged, said Medb. We shall cut down the wood. it was done, and Slechta is the name of that place.\n\nThey spent the night then in Cúil Sibrille, that is, Cennannas. Heavy snow fell on them, reaching to the girdles of the men and the wheels of the chariots. They rose early on the morrow. That had not been a restful night for them because of the snow, nor had they prepared food for themselves that night. But Cú Chulainn did not come early from his tryst; he remained until he had washed and bathed. Then he came on to the track of the army. Would that we had not gone thither nor betrayed the men of Ulster! cried Cú Chulainn. We have let the enemy host come upon them unawares. Make an estimate of the host for us, said Cú Chulainn to Lóeg, that we may know their number. Lóeg did so and said to Cú Chulainn I am confused. I cannot estimate exactly. If only I come, I shall not see them confusedly, said Cú Chulainn. Get out of the chariot, said Lóeg. Cú Chulainn got out of the chariot and for a long time he estimated the number of the host. Even you, said Lóeg, do not find it easy. It is easier for me, however, than for you. For I have three gifts, namely, the gift of sight, the gift of understanding, the gift\n\np.134\n\n{translation of lines 327-355} of reckoning. I have reckoned up the numbers here.\n\nThis is one of the three cleverest yet most difficult reckonings ever made in Ireland, the three being this reckoning of the men of Ireland made by Cú Chulainn in the Táin, the reckoning made by Lug of the Fomorians in the battle of Mag Tuired and the reckoning of the army in Bruiden Da Derga made by Ingcél, [marginal note]\n\nThere are here in number eighteen divisions, but the eighteenth division, that is, the division of the Gailióin, has been distributed among the whole host so that it is confusing to count them.\n\nThen Cú Chulainn went round the host until he was at Áth nGrencha. There he cut down a forked branch with one blow of his sword and fixed it in the middle of the stream so that a chariot could not pass it on this side or on that. While he was thus engaged Eirr and Indell with their two charioteers, Fóich and Fochlam, came up with him. He cut off their four heads and impaled them on the four prongs of the forked branch. Hence the name Áth nGabla.\n\nthat is, at the place called Beloch Caille Móire to the north of Cnogba, [marginal note]\n\n.\n\nThen the horses of the four men went towards the host, with their bloodstained trappings. The host thought that there had been a battle in the ford before them. A band went from them to survey the ford; they saw only the track of one chariot and the forked branch with the four heads and an ogam inscription on its side. At that point the whole army arrived.\n\nAre yonder heads those of some of our people? asked Medb. They are of our people and of our choice men, said Ailill. One of them read aloud the ogam inscription that was on the side of the forked branch: One man has cast this forked branch with one hand, and ye shall not go past it unless one of you, but not Fergus, has cast it with one hand. It is marvellous, said Ailill, how quickly the four were slain. Do not think that marvellous, said Fergus, but rather the cutting of the forked branch from its root with one blow, and if its end shows one cutting, it is all the greater achievement, and (it is marvellous) that it should have been driven in in this manner, for no hole was dug for it but it was cast from the back of a chariot with one hand. Deliver us in this difficulty, Fergus, said Medb. Give me a chariot then, said Fergus, that I may pull the branch out so that it may be seen if its end shows one cutting. Then Fergus smashed fourteen of their chariots but from his own chariot he drew the forked branch out of the ground and he saw that its end was one cutting.\n\np.\n\n{translation of lines 356-387} We must take heed of the nature of the people to whom we are going, said Ailill. Let all of you prepare food. Last night was not restful for you with the snow. And let some of the adventures and stories of the people to whom we go be related to us. So then they were told the adventures of Cú Chulainn.\n\nAilill asked Is it Conchobar who has done this? It is not indeed, said Fergus. He would not have come to the marches unless he was accompanied by a number sufficient to give battle. Was it Celtchar mac Uthidir? It was not indeed, said Fergus. He would not have come to the marches without a number sufficient to give battle around him. Was it Eógan mac Durthacht? It was not indeed, said Fergus. He would not have come past the marches without thirty scythed chariots. The man who would have done the deed is Cú Chulainn, said Fergus. It is he who would have cut down the tree with one blow from its root, and he who would have killed the four men as quickly as they were killed, and he who would have come to the border accompanied (only) by his charioteer.\n\nThe Eulogy of Cú Chulainn\n\nWhat manner of man, asked Ailill, is this Hound whom we have heard of among the Ulstermen? What age is that famous youth? I can tell you that, said Fergus. In his fifth year he went to the boys in Emain Macha to play. In his sixth year he went to learn feats of arms to Scáthach and went to woo Emer. In his seventh year he took up arms. At the present time he is seventeen years old.\n\nIs he the most formidable among the Ulstermen? asked Medb. More so than any one of them, answered Fergus. You will not encounter a warrior harder to deal with, nor a spear-point sharper or keener or quicker, nor a hero fiercer, nor a raven more voracious, nor one of his age to equal a third of his valour, nor a lion more savage, nor a shelter in battle nor a sledge-hammer for smiting, nor a protector in fighting, nor doom of hosts, nor one better able to check a great army. You will not find there any man his equal in age like unto Cú Chulainn in growth, in dress, in fearsomeness, in\n\np.136\n\n{translation of lines 388-424} speech, in splendour, in voice and appearance, in power and harshness, in feats, in valour, in striking power, in rage and in anger, in victory and in doom- dealing and in violence, in stalking, in sureness of aim and in game-killing, in swiftness and boldness and rage, with the feat of nine men on every spear- point.\n\nI reek little of that, said Medb. He has but one body; he suffers wounding; he is not beyond capture. Moreover he is only the age of a grown girl and as yet his manly deeds have not developed. Nay, said Fergus. It were no wonder that he should perform a goodly exploit today, for even when he was younger, his deeds were those of a man.\n\nThe Boyhood Deeds\n\nHe was reared, said Fergus, by his father and mother at the Airgthech in Mag Muirthemne. He was told the famous tales of the youths in Emain. For, said Fergus, thrice fifty youths are usually there engaged in play. This is how Conchobor spends his time of sovereignty: one third of the day spent watching the youths, another third playing fidchell, another third drinking ale till he falls asleep therefrom. Though we have been exiled by him, (I still maintain that) there is not in Ireland a warrior more wonderful, said Fergus.\n\nCú Chulainn asked his mother to let him go to join the boys. You shall not go, said his mother, till you be escorted by some of the Ulster warriors. I think it too long to wait for that, said Cú Chulainn. Point out to me in what direction is Emain. To the north there, said his mother, and the journey is hard. Slíab Fúait lies between you and Emain. I shall make an attempt at it at all events, said Cú Chulainn. He went off then with his wooden shield and his toy javelin, his hurley and his ball. He kept throwing the javelin in front of him and catching it by the point before its end touched the ground.\n\nThen he went to the boys without binding them over to protect him. For no one used to come to them in their playing-field till his protection was guaranteed, but Cú Chulainn was not aware of the fact that this was tabu for them. The boy insults us, said Follomon mac Conchobair. Yet we know he is of the Ulstermen. Attack him. They threw their thrice fifty javelins at him, and they all stuck in his toy shield. Then they threw all their balls at him and he\n\np.137\n\n{translation of lines 425-459} caught them, every single ball, against his breast. Then they threw their thrice fifty hurling-clubs at him. He warded them off so that they did not touch him, and he took a load of them on his back.\n\nThereupon he became distorted. His hair stood on end so that it seemed as if each separate hair on his head had been hammered into it. You would have thought that there was a spark of fire on each single hair. He closed one eye so that it was no wider than the eye of a needle; he opened the other until it was as large as the mouth of a mead-goblet. He laid bare from his jaw to his ear and opened his mouth rib-wide(?) so that his internal organs were visible. The champion's light rose above his head.\n\nThen he attacked the boys. He knocked down fifty of them before they reached the gate of Emain. Nine of them came past me and Conchobar where we were playing chess. Cú Chulainn leapt over the chess-board in pursuit of the nine. Conchobar seized him by the forearm. The boys are not well treated. said Conchobar. It was right for me (to treat them so), master Conchobar, said he. I came to play with them from my home, from my father and mother, and they were not kind to me. What is your name? said Conchobar. I am Sétanta the son of Súaltaim and of Deichtire, your sister. It was not to be expected that I should be tormented there. Why were the boys not bound over to protect you? asked Conchobar. I did not know of (the need of) that, said Cú Chulainn. Undertake to protect me against them. I agree, said Conchobar. But then he turned again and attacked the boys throughout the house. What have you got against them now? asked Conchobar. Let me be bound over to protect them, said Cú Chulainn. Undertake it then, said Conchobar. I agree, said Cú Chulainn. So they all went into the playing field. And those boys who had been knocked down there rose to their feet, helped by their fostermothers and their foster- fathers.\n\nAt one time, said Fergus, when Cú Chulainn was a boy, he never slept in Emain. Tell me, said Conchobar to him, Why do you not sleep?\n\np.138\n\n{translation of lines 460-491} I do not sleep unless my head and my feet are equally high. So a pillar-stone was placed by Conchobar at his head and another at his feet, and a special couch was made for him between them. On another occasion a certain man went to wake him and with his fist Cú Chulainn struck him on the forehead, driving the front of his forehead on to his brain, while with his arm he knocked down the pillar-stone. Surely, said Ailill, that was the fist of a warrior and the arm of a strong man! From that time on, said Fergus, they never dared to wake him (but left him) till he woke of his own accord.\n\nThe Death of the Boys\n\nAnother time he was playing ball in the playing-field east of Emain, he alone on one side against the thrice fifty boys. He kept defeating them in every game in that way all the time. Eventually the boy began to belabour them with his fists and fifty of them died. Whereupon he fled and hid under the pillow of Conchobar's couch. The Ulstermen rose up around him but I and Conchobar stood up to defend him. The boy rose to his feet under the couch and on to the floor of the house he threw from him the couch together with the thirty warriors who were in it.\n\nThen the Ulstermen sat around him in the house and we arranged matters and made peace between the boys and him, said Fergus.\n\nThe Fight between Eógan mac Durthacht and Conchobar\n\nThere was strife between the Ulstermen and Eógan mac Durthacht. The Ulstermen went to battle while Cú Chulainn was left behind asleep. The Ulstermen were defeated. Conchobar and Cúscraid Menn Macha and many others besides were left on the field. Their groans awoke Cú Chulainn. Then he stretched himself so that the two flag-stones which were about him were smashed. Bricriu yonder witnessed this happening, said Fergus. Then he arose. I met him in front of the fort as I came in severely wounded. Hey! Welcome! master Fergus, said he. Where is Conchobar? I do not know, said I.\n\np.139\n\n{translation of lines 492-527} He went on his way then. The night was dark. He made for the battlefield. He saw in front of him a man with half a head carrying the half of another man on his back.\n\nHelp me, Cú Chulainn! said he. I have been wounded and I have brought half of my brother on my back. Take a turn with me in carrying him. I will not, said he. Whereupon the other threw the burden he was carrying to him, but Cú Chulainn cast it off. They wrestled then and Cú Chulainn was thrown. He heard the war- goddess crying from among the corpses. Poor stuff to make a warrior is he who is overthrown by phantoms! Whereupon Cú Chulainn rose to his feet, and, striking off his opponent's head with his hurley, he began to drive the head like a ball before him across the plain.\n\nIs my master Conchobar on this battle-field? Conchobar answered him. Cú Chulainn went towards him and saw him in the ditch with the earth around him on all sides hiding him. Why have you come to the battle-field said Conchobar, where you may die of fright? He lifted Conchobar out of the ditch then. Six of our strong men in Ulster could not have lifted him out more courageously. Go before us to yonder house, said Conchobar, and make a fire for me there. He kindled a big fire for him.\n\nWell, said Conchobar, if I now had a roast pig, I should live. I will go and fetch one, said Cú Chulainn. He went off then and saw a man at a cooking-pit in the middle of the wood, with one hand holding his weapons, the other cooking a pig. Great was the fearsomeness of the man. Nevertheless he attacked him and carried off his head and his pig. Afterwards Conchobar ate the pig. Let us go to our house, said Conchobar. They met Cúscraid mac Conchobair. He too bore severe wounds, Cú Chulainn carried him on his back. The three of them went on to Emain Macha.\n\nThe fate of the twenty-seven men and the reason why none dared to wound the Ulstermen when they were in their debility.\n\nOn another occasion the Ulstermen were in their debility. Among us, said Fergus, women and boys do not suffer from the debility nor does anyone outside the territory of Ulster, nor yet\n\np.140\n\n{translation of lines 528-563} Cú Chulainn and his father, and so none dares to shed their blood for whosoever wounds them at once suffers himself from the debility or he wastes away or his life-span is shortened.\n\nTwenty-seven men came to us from the Isles of Faiche. While we were suffering the debility they climbed over into our backcourt. The women in the fort cried out in warning. The boys who were in the playing-field came on hearing the cries, but when they saw the dark gloomy men, they all fled except Cú Chulainn alone. He cast hand-stones at them and belaboured them with his hurley. He killed nine of them but they dealt him fifty wounds, and then they went off.\n\nIf a man did those deeds when he was five years old, it were no wonder that he should have come to the marches, and cut off the heads of yon four men.\n\nThe killing of the Smith's Hound by Cú Chulainn and the reason why he is called Cú Chulainn\n\nIndeed we know that boy, said Conall Cernach, and we know him all the better in that he is a fosterling of ours. Not long after the deed which Fergus has just related, he performed another exploit.\n\nWhen Culann the smith prepared a feast for Conchobar, he asked Conchobar not to bring a great crowd with him for the feast he had made was not provided by his possession of land or estate but was gained by the work of his hands and his tongs. Then Conchobar set off together with fifty chariot-warriors, the noblest and most illustrious of the heroes.\n\nConchobar visited the playing-field then. It was always his custom to pay the boys a fleeting visit to ask a greeting of them. There he saw Cú Chulainn playing ball against thrice fifty boys, and defeating them. When they were engaged in driving the ball into the hole, he would fill the hole with his balls and the boys would not be able to ward him off. When it was they who were throwing at the hole, he by himself would ward them off so that not even a single ball would go into it. When they were wrestling, he alone would throw the thrice fifty boys, yet not all of them together could surround him to throw him. When they were engaged in the game of stripping one another, he would strip them all stark-naked but they could not even take his brooch from his mantle. Conchobor marvelled at this. He asked if the boy's deeds would correspond (to his present ones) when he attained the age of manhood. They all said that they would. Conchobor said to Cú Chulainn\n\np.141\n\n{lines 564-595} Come with me to the feast to which we are going since you are a guest. I have not yet had my fill of play, master Conchobor, said the boy. I shall follow you. When they had all come to the feast, Culann asked Conchobar: Do you expect anyone to follow you? No, said Conchobor. He did not remember the arrangement with his fosterling to come after him. I have a blood hound,\n\n[i.e. a hound brought from overseas, i.e. the whelp of a mastiff.] said Culann. There are three chains on him and three men holding each chain. He was brought from Spain. Let him be loosed to guard our cattle and our stock and let the fort be shut. At that point the boy arrived. The dog made for him. He still kept on with the play; he would throw his ball and then throw his hurley after it so that it struck the ball, neither stroke being greater than the other. And he threw his toy spear after them and caught it before it fell. And though the dog was approaching him, it interfered not with his play. Conchobor and his household were so dismayed by this that they could not move. They thought they would not reach him alive though the fort was open. Now when the hound came towards the boy, he cast aside his ball and his hurley, and he tackled the dog with both hands, that is, he put one hand on the apple of the hound's throat and the other at the back of his head, and dashed him against the pillar-stone that was beside him so that all the hound's limbs sprang apart. According to another version, however, he threw his ball into the hound's mouth and it drove his entrails out through him.\n\nThe Ulstermen rose up to fetch the boy, some leaping over the wall of the court, others going out by the gate. They placed him in Conchobar's arms. A great alarm was raised by them at the thought that the son of the king's sister had almost been killed. At that point Culann entered the house.\n\nWelcome, little lad, for your mother's sake. But as for myself, would that I had not prepared a feast! My livelihood is now a livelihood wasted, my husbandry a husbandry lost without my hound. That hound was not one of the three hounds that were in the brain of Conganchness, as some hold, for it was to take vengeance for Cú Roí's death on the men of Ulster that Conganchness had gone and that happened long after the Cattle-Raid, but Cú Chulainn was only seven years old when he killed the smith's hound. Thus the theory held by those people is false; the smith's hound had been brought from Spain, as is asserted in the text of the tale. The servant who has been taken from me, that is, my\n\np.142\n\n{translation of lines 596-629} hound, maintained life and honour for me. He was defence and protection for my goods and my cattle. He guarded all my beasts for me in field and in house.\n\nThat is no great matter, said the boy. A whelp of the same litter will be reared by me for you, and until such time as that hound grows and is fit for action, I myself shall be a hound to protect your cattle and to protect yourself. And I shall protect all Mag Murthemne; neither flock nor herd shall be taken thence from me without my knowing it. Your name shall be Cú Chulainn (the Hound of Culann) then, said Catbhad. I am glad that it should be my name, said Cú Chulainn. It were no cause of wonder that one who had done this when he was seven, should have performed a valiant deed now that he is seventeen years old, said Conall Cernach.\n\nThe Death of Nechta Scéne's Three Sons\n\nHe did still another exploit, said Fiachu mac Fir Fhebe. Cathbad the druid was with his son Conchobar mac Nessa. There were with him a hundred active men learning the druid's artthat was the number that Cathbad used to instruct. One of his pupils asked him for what that day would be of good omen. Cathbad said that if a warrior took up arms on that day, his name for deeds of valour would be known throughout Ireland and his fame would last for ever. Cú Chulainn heard this. He went to Conchobar to ask for arms. Conchobar asked: Who prophesied good fortune for you? Master Cathbad, said Cú Chulainn. We know him indeed, said Conchobar. He gave him a spear and a shield. Cú Chulainn brandished them in the middle of the hall so that not one was left unbroken of the fifteen spare sets of weapons which were kept in Conchobar's household to replace broken weapons or to provide for the taking up of arms by someone. Finally Conchobar's own arms were given to him. They withstood him, and he brandished them and blessed the king whose arms they were, saying: Happy the people and race over whom reigns the owner of these arms\n\nThen Cathbad came to them and asked: Is the boy taking up arms? Yes, said Conchobar.\n\np.143\n\n{translation of lines 630-668} That is not lucky for the son of his mother, said he. Why, was it not you who instructed him? It was not I indeed, said Cathbad. What use is it for you to deceive me so, you sprite? said Conchobar to Cú Chulainn. O king of the Fían, it is no deceit, said Cú Chulainn. He prophesied good fortune for his pupils this morning and I heard him from where I was on the south side of Emain, and then I came to you. It is indeed a day of good omen, said Cathbad. It is certain that he who takes up arms today will be famous and renowned, but he will, however, be short-lived. A mighty thing! said Cú Chulainn. Provided I be famous, I am content to be only one day on earth.\n\nOn another day a certain man asked the druids for what that day was a good omen. The name of one who goes (for the first time) into a chariot on this day, said Cathbad, will be famed throughout Ireland for ever. Then Cú Chulainn heard this, and he came to Conchobar and said to him: Master Conchobar, give me a chariot. Conchobar gave him a chariot. Cú Chulainn put his hand between the two shafts and the chariot broke. In the same way he smashed twelve chariots. So finally Conchobar's chariot was given to him and it withstood the test. Thereafter he went into the chariot with Conchobar's charioteer. The charioteer, whose name was Ibor, turned the chariot under him. Come out of the chariot now, said the charioteer. These are fine horses. I am fine too, lad, said Cú Clulainn. Just go on around Emain and you shall be rewarded for it.\n\nThe charioteer drove off and Cú Chulainn made him go along the road that he might greet the boys, and so that the boys may wish me well. Then he besought him to go back over the road again. When they had come there Cú Chulainn said to the charioteer: Ply the goad on the horses. In what direction? asked the charioteer. As far as the road will lead, said Cú Chulainn.\n\nThence they came to Slíab Fúait where they found Conall Cernach. It had fallen to Conall to guard the province that day. For each warrior of the Ulstermen spent a day in turn in Slíab\n\np.144\n\n{translation of lines 669-703} Fúait, to protect anyone who came that way with poetry or with challenge to battle, so that there he might be encountered and so that no one should go unnoticed into Emain. I wish you prosperity, victory and triumph! said Conall. Go to the fort, Conall, and leave me here to watch now, said Cú Chulainn. That will do, said Conall, if it is (merely) to undertake the protection of one coming with poetry. However, if it be to fight some one, it is still too soon for you to do that. Perhaps it will not be necessary at all, said Cú Chulainn. Meanwhile let us go to take a look at the sand-bank of Loch Echtra. There are usually warriors staying there. I am willing, said Conall. So they set out.\n\nCú Chulainn threw a stone from his sling and the shaft of Conall Cernach's chariot broke. Why have you thrown the stone, lad? asked Conall. To test my shooting and the accuracy of my shot, said Cú Chulainn, And it is the custom with you Ulstermen that you do not drive on in a chariot which is unsafe. Go back to Emain master Conall, and leave me here to keep watch. I am willing, said Conall. Conall Cernach did not go past that spot afterwards.\n\nCú Chulainn went on to Loch Echtra but they found no one there. The charioteer told Cú Chulainn that they should go to Emain to be in time for the feasting there. No, said Cú Chulainn. What mountain is that over there? Slíab Monduirnd, said the charioteer. Let us go to it, said Cú Chulainn.\n\nThen they went to it, and when they had reached the mountain, Cú Chulainn asked What white cairn is that over there on the mountain-top? Finncharn, said the charioteer. What plain is that yonder? asked Cú Chulainn. Mag mBreg, said the charioteer.\n\nSo he told him the name of every chief fort between Temair and Cennannas. He named, moreover, their meadowlands and their fords, their renowned places and their dwellings, their forts and their fortified heights. He showed him too the fort of the three sons of Nechta Scéne, from Inber Scene. Fer Ulli mac Lugdach was their father and Nechtan Scéne their mother. The Ulstermen had killed their father which is the reason they were at war with the Ulstermen to wit, Fóill, Fannall and Túachell.\n\np.145\n\n{translation of lines 704-738} Is it they who say, asked Cú Chulainn, that there are not more Ulstermen alive than they have killed of them? It is they indeed, said the charioteer. Let us go to meet them, said Cú Chulainn. It is dangerous for us, said the charioteer.\n\nIndeed it is not to avoid danger that we go, said Cú Chulainn. Then they set off, and they unyoked their horses at the confluence of a bog and a river, on the south above the fort of the sons of Nechta Scéne. And Cú Chulainn cast the withe that was on the pillar-stone as far as his arm could throw it out into the river and let it float downstream. This violated a tabu which bound the sons of Nechta Scéne who noticed what had been done and came towards them. But Cú Chulainn, after letting the withe drift with the current, fell asleep at the pillar-stone, having said to the charioteer: Do not wake me for a few, but wake me for several.\n\nHowever the charioteer was now sore afraid, and he harnessed the chariot and he tugged at the rugs and skin-coverings that were under Cú Chulainn, though he did not dare to waken him because Cú Chulainn had previously told him not to waken him for a few.\n\nThen came the sons of Nechta Scéne. Who is here? said one of them. A little lad who has come on an expedition in a chariot today, answered the charioteer. May his first taking up of arms not bring him prosperity or success. He must not stay in our land and the horses must not graze here any longer, said the warrior. Their reins are ready in my hand. said the charioteer. You had no reason to show yourself unfriendly to him, and anyway, said Ibor to the warrior, the lad is asleep. I am no lad indeed, said Cú Chulainn, but the lad who is here has come to seek battle with a man. That pleases me well, said the warrior. It will please you well now in yonder ford, said Cú Chulainn. This is fitting for you, said the charioteer. Beware of the man who comes against you. Fóill (Sly) is his name. If you reach him not with the first thrust, you will never reach him. I swear by the god by whom my people swear, he shall not play that trick again on Ulstermen if once the broad spear of my master Conchobar reach him from my hand. It will mean an outlaw's hand, that is, death, for him.\n\np.146\n\n{translation of lines 739-776} Then Cú Chulainn cast the spear at Fóill so that his back broke therefrom and he carried off his spoils and his severed head then.\n\nBeware of the next man, said the charioteer. Fannall (Swallow) is his name. He skims over water as lightly as a swan or a swallow. I swear that he will not play that stick on Ulstermen again, said Cú Chulainn. You have seen how I travel across the pool in Emain. Then they met in the ford. Cú Chulainn killed that man and carried off his spoils and his head.\n\nBeware of the next man who comes to you, said the charioteer. Túachell (Cunning) is his name, and it is no misnomer for no weapons wound him. Here is the deil chlis for him to confound him so that it may riddle him like a sieve, said Cú Chulainn. Then he cast the spear at him and knocked him down. He went towards him and cut off his head. He carried off his head and his spoils to his own charioteer. Then he heard the cry of their mother, Nechta Scéne, bewailing them. He carried off the spoils and brought the three heads with him in his chariot and said I will not part from these tokens of my triumph until I reach Emain. Thereupon they set forth with their trophies. Cú Chulainn said to the charioteer: You promised us a good drive, and we need it now because of the fight and because of the pursuit behind us.\n\nThey drove on then to Slíab Fúait. So swift was the run they made across Brega after his urging of the charioteer that the chariot-horses used to outstrip the wind and birds in flight, and Cú Chulainn used to catch the stone he had thrown from his sling before it reached the ground.\n\nOn reaching Slíab Fuait they found a herd of deer before them. What are those nimble cattle over there? asked Cú Chulainn. Wild deer, said the charioteer. Which would the Ulstermen deem best, that I should take them to them alive or dead? It is more wonderful (to take them) alive said the charioteer. Not every one can do so, but there is not one of them who cannot take them dead. But you cannot carry off any one of them alive, added the charioteer. Indeed I can, said Cú Chulainn. Ply the goad on the horses and drive them to the bog.\n\np.147\n\n{translation of lines 777-812} The charioteer did so, and the horses stuck fast in the bog. Cú Chulainn sprang out of the chariot and caught the deer that was nearest to him and the finest of the herd. He lashed the horses through the bog and subdued the deer immediately and tied it up between the two poles of the chariot.\n\nAgain they saw before them a flock of swans. Which would the Ulstermen deem best, asked Cú Chulainn, that I should carry them alive to them or carry them dead? The bravest and most active carry them off alive, said the charioteer. Cú Chulainn then threw a small stone at the birds and brought down eight of them. Again he threw a big stone and struck twelve of them. All this was done by his return-stroke. Collect the birds for me, said Cú Chulainn to his charioteer. If I go to get them, the wild deer will spring on you.\n\nIt is not easy for me to go there, said the charioteer. The horses have become wild so that I cannot go past them. Nor can I go past the iron wheels of the chariot because of their sharpness, and I cannot go past the deer for his antlers have filled all the space between the two poles of the chariot. Step from his antlers then, said Cú Chulainn. I swear by the god by whom the Ulstermen swear, that I shall so nod at him and so glare at him that he will not move his head towards you and will not dare to stir. That was done then. Cú Chulainn fastened the reins and the charioteer collected the birds. Then Cú Chulainn tied the birds to the strings and cords of the chariot. In this wise he went to Emain Macha with a wild deer behind his chariot, a flock of swans fluttering over it and three severed heads in his chariot.\n\nThey reached Emain then. A chariot-warrior is driving towards you! cried the watchman in Emain Macha. He will shed the blood of every man in the fort unless heed be taken and naked women go out to meet him.\n\nThen he turned the left side of his chariot towards Emain which was tabu for it. And Cú Chulainn said. I swear by the god by whom Ulstermen swear that, unless some man is found to fight with me, I shall shed the blood of everyone in the fort. Send forth naked women to meet him ! ordered Conchobor. Then the women-folk of Emain came forth to meet him led by Mugain,\n\nor by Férach, according to other versions [gloss]\n\nthe wife of Conchobor mac Nessa, and they bared their breasts to him.\n\np.148\n\n{translation of lines 813-843} These are the warriors who will encounter you today, said Mugain.\n\nor Férach [gloss]\"\n\n.\n\nHe hid his face. Then the warriors of Emain seized him and cast him into a tub of cold water. That tub burst about him. The second tub into which he was plunged boiled hands high therefrom. The third tub into which he went after that he warmed so that its heat and its cold were properly adjusted for him. Then he came out and the queen, Mugain, put on him a blue mantle with a silver brooch therein, and a hooded tunic, and he sat at Conchobor's knee which was his resting-place always after that.\n\nOne who did that in his seventh year, said Fiachu mac Fir Pebe, it were no wonder that he should triumph over odds and overcome in fair fight now that his seventeen years are complete today.\n\nA different Version up to the Death of Órlám\n\nLet us go forward now, said Ailill. Then they reached Mag Mucceda. There Cú Chulainn cut down an oaktree in their path and on its side he wrote an ogam inscription which said that none should go past it until a warrior should leap across it in a chariot. They pitched their tents at that spot and they came to leap across it in their chariots. Thirty horses fell in the attempt and thirty chariots were broken there. Bélach nÁne is the name of that place ever since.\n\nThe Death of Fráech\n\nThey remained there till the morrow. Fráech was summoned to them. Help us, Fráech, said Medb. Deliver us in this strait. Go for us to meet Cú Chulainn to see if perhaps you may encounter him in battle. Fráech set forth, a company of nine men, early in the morning and reached Áth Fúait. He saw a warrior bathing in the river. Wait here, said Fráech to his followers, till I fight with yonder man. He is not good in water. He took off his clothes and went into the water to Cú Chulainn. Do not come against me, said Cú Chulainn. You will die if you do and I should be sorry to kill you.\n\np.149\n\n{translation of lines 844-879} Indeed I shall go, said Fráech, so that we may meet in the water, and give me fair play. Arrange that as you please, said Cú Chulainn. Let each of us clasp the other (and wrestle), said Fráech. For a long time they kept wrestling in the water, and Fráech was submerged. Cú Chulainn lifted him up again. Now this time will you yield and accept your life? said Cú Chulainn. I will not, said Fráech.\n\nCú Chulainn thrust him down again and Fráech died. He came to land. His people carried his body to the encampment. Ever after that ford was called Áth Fraích. The whole encampment mourned for Fráech. They saw a band of women dressed in green tunics bending over the corpse of Fráech mac Idaid. They carried him off into the fairy mound which was called Síd Fraích ever afterwards.\n\nFergus leapt across the oak-tree in his own chariot.\n\nThey went on as far as Áth Taiten. There Cú Chulainn overthrew six of them, namely, the six Dungail Irruis. Thence they went on to Fornocht. Medb had a young hound named Baiscne. Cú Chulainn threw a stone at it and took its head off. Druim Baiscne was the name of that place henceforth. It is a disgrace for you, said Medb, that you do not hunt down that wicked hind who is killing you. So they went in pursuit of him then and the shafts of their chariots broke in the hunting.\n\nThe Death of Órlám\n\nOn the morrow they went over Iraird Culenn. Cú Chulainn went forward and came upon the charioteer of Órlám, son of Ailill and Medb, at a place called Tamlachta Órláim a little to the north of Dísert Lochait where he was cutting wood.\n\nAccording to another version, however, it was the shaft of Cú Chulainn's chariot that had broken and he had gone to cut a new shaft when he met the charioteer of &Óacute;rlám. But according to this version it was the charioteer who cut the shafts.\n\nIt is a bold action on the part of the Ulstermen if it is they who are yonder, said Cú Chulainn, while the army is on their track. He went to the charioteer to reprimand him, thinking he was one of the Ulstermen. He saw the man cutting wood, that is, chariot-shafts.\n\np.150\n\n{translation of lines 880-915}\n\nWhat are you doing here? said Cú Chulainn. Cutting chariot-shafts, said the charioteer. We have broken our chariots hunting yon wild deer, Cú Chulainn. Help me, said the charioteer. Decide whether you will collect the shafts or strip them. I will strip them, said Cú Chulainn. Then Cú Chulainn stripped the shafts between his fingers in the presence of the other, and he cleaned them both of bark and of knots. It was not your proper work that I set you, said the charioteer who was sore afraid. Who are you? asked Cú Chulainn. I am the charioteer of &Óacute;rlám, son of Ailill and Medb, said he. And who are you? My name is Cú Chulainn, said he. Woe is me !said the charioteer. Fear nothing, said Cú Chulainn. Where is your master? He is on the mound yonder, said the charioteer. Come on then with me, said Cú Chulainn, for I do not kill charioteers.\n\nCú Chulainn went to &Óacute;rlám, killed him and cut off his head and brandished it before the host. He put the head then on the charioteer's back and said: Take that with you and go thus to the camp. If you do not go thus, I shall cast a stone at you from my sling. When the charioteer drew near the camp, he took the head from his back, and related his adventures to Ailill and Medb. It is not like catching a fledgling, said she. And he said that if I did not bring the head to the camp on my back, he would break my head for me with a stone.\n\nThe Death of the three Sons of Gárach\n\nThen the three Meic Gárach remained at their ford. Their names were Lon, Úalu and Diliu, and Mes Lir, Mes Lóech and Mes Lethan were their three charioteers. They thought Cú Chulainn had gone too far in doing what he had done, namely, killing the king's two foster-sons and his son and brandishing his son's head before the host. (They came then) that they might kill Cú Chulainn in revenge for &Óacute;rlám and so that they might themselves alone remove this cause of anxiety from the host. They cut three wooden rods for their charioteers so that the six of them together might do battle with Cú Chulainn. But then he killed all of them for they had broken the terms of fair play.\n\np.151\n\n{translation of lines 916-948}\n\nAt that time &Óacute;rlám's charioteer was standing between Ailill and Medb. Cú Chulainn threw a stone at him and his head broke and his brains gushed out over his ears. His name was Fer Teidil. So it is not true that Cú Chulainn never slew charioteers; but he did not kill them unless they were at fault.\n\nThe Death of the Marten and of the Pet Bird\n\nCú Chulainn threatened in Méithe that, wherever afterwards he should see Ailill or Medb, he would cast a stone from his sling at them. He did so indeed; he threw a stone from his sling and killed the marten on Medb's shoulder south of the ford. Hence is the name Méithe Togmaill. And north of the ford he killed the bird that was on Ailill's shoulder. Hence the name Méithe nEoin. Or, according to another version, both marten and bird were on Medb's shoulder and their heads were struck off by the stones cast. Then Reúin was drowned in his lake; hence the name Loch Reóin.\n\nYour opponent is not far from you, said Ailill to the Maines. They rose to their feet and gazed around. When they sat down again Cú Chulainn struck one of them and smashed his head. That was no successful expedition! It ill befitted you to boast, said Maenén the jester. I should have cut his head off. Then Cú Chulainn cast a stone at him and smashed his head.\n\nIn this manner then these men were killed: first of all &Óacute;rlám on his height, then the three Meic Gárach at their ford, Fer Teidil at his dedil and Maenén on his hill.\n\nI swear by the god by whom my people swear, said Ailill, that I shall cut in twain whatever man shall make a mock of Cú Chulainn here. Come on now, I beg you, travelling by day and by night until we reach Cúailnge. That man will kill two thirds of your army (if he continue) in this way.\n\nThen the harpers of Caín Bile came to them from Ess Ruaid to entertain them with music. But they thought that the harpers had come from the Ulstermen to spy on them. So they hunted them until they went before them into the pillar-stones at Lía Mór in the north, transformed into deer, for (in reality) they were druids possessed of great occult knowledge.\n\nThe Death of Lethan\n\nLethan came on to his ford over the Níth in Conaille, and he indeed waited to encounter Cú Chulainn. He was grieved by what Cú\n\np.152\n\n{translation of lines 949-987} Chulainn had already done. Cú Chulainn cut off his head and left it there beside the body. Hence is the name Áth Lethan on the Níth. And their chariots broke when they met on the ford beside it. Hence is the name Áth Carpat. Mulcha, Lethan's charioteer, fell on the shoulder of the hill that lies between Áth Lethan and Áth Carpat. Hence comes the place-name Gúala Mulcha.\n\nWhile the army was going over Mag mBreg Allecto came for a while, that is, the Mórrígan, in the form of a bird which perched on the pillar-stone in Temair Cúailnge and said to the bull: Does the restless Black Bull know (it) without destructive falsehood? ... I have a secret that the Black Bull will know if he graze(?) ... on the green grass ... Fierce is the raven, men are dead, a sorrowful saying ... every day the death of a great tribe ...  Then the bull went with fifty heifers to Slíab Cuillinn, and his herdsman, Forgaimen, followed him. The bull threw off the thrice fifty boys who used to play on his back and killed two thirds of them. And before he went he pawed the earth in Tir Margéni in Cúailnge.\n\nCú Chulainn did not kill anyone between the Saili Imdoirchi in the district of Conaille until they reached Cúailnge. Cú Chulainn was then on the mountain Cuinche. He threatened that wherever he saw Medb he would cast a stone at her head. This was not easy for him, for Medb travelled surrounded by half the army and with a screen of shields over her head.\n\nThe Death of Lócha\n\nA handmaid of Medb's called Lócha went with a great company of women to fetch water. Cú Chulainn thought that she was Medb. He threw a stone at her from Cuinche and killed her on her plain. Hence comes the place-name Réid Lócha in Cúailnge.\n\nFrom Findabair Cúailnge the army scattered and set the country on fire. They gathered together all the women, boys, girls and cows that were in Cúailnge and brought them all to Findabair. Your expedition was not successful, said Medb. I do not see that you have the bull. He is not in the province at all, said they all. Lóthar. Medb's cowherd was summoned to them. Where do you think the bull is? she asked. I am afraid to tell, said the cowherd. The night that the Ulstermen fell into their debility the bull went away with sixty heifers and he is now in Dubchaire in Glenn Gat.\n\np.153\n\n{translation of lines 988-1018} Go, said Medb, and take a withe between each pair of you. They did so then, and hence the glen is called Glenn Gat. Then they brought the bull to Findabair. When the bull caught sight of Lóthar the cowherd, he rushed at him and disembowelled him with his horns. Then together with his thrice fifty heifers the bull made for the encampment and fifty warriors were killed by him.That is the Death of Lóthar on the Foray.\n\nThen the bull went away from them out of the camp, but they knew not where he had gone and they were grieved. Medb asked the cowherd if he knew where the bull was. I fancy that he might be in the recesses of Slíab Cuillinn. So they turned back after ravaging Cúailnge but they did not find the bull there. The river Cronn rose up against them as high as the tops of the trees. They spent the night by the river-bank. And Medb ordered some of her people to go across.\n\nThe Death of Úalu\n\nOn the morrow a valiant hero called Úalu went and took a great flagstone on his back to go across the water. But the river turned him over and he lay with his stone on his belly. His grave and his headstone are on the road beside the stream. Lia Úalann is its name.\n\nAfterwards they went round the river Cronn as far as its source, and they would have gone between its source and the mountain only that Medb would not allow it. She preferred that they should go across the mountain so that the track they made might remain there for ever as an insult to the men of Ulster. So they remained there three days and three nights until they had dug up the earth in front of them (to make a pass through the mountain) which was called Bernas Bó Cúailnge.\n\nThen Cú Chulainn killed Cronn and Cóemdele and fought a furious(?) combat. A hundred warriors died by his hand ... together with Roán and Roae, the two historians of the Táin. A hundred and forty-four kings were slain by him beside that same stream.\n\nAfter that they came through the pass Bernas Bó Cúailnge with the stock and cattle of Cúailnge, and they spent the night in Glenn Dáil Imda in Cúailnge. Botha is the name of that place because they made huts (botha) to shelter them there. On the morrow they went on to the river Colptha. They heedlessly tried to cross it but it\n\np.154\n\n{translation of lines 1019-1052} rose in flood against them and carried off to sea a hundred of their chariot- warriors. Cluain Carpat is the name of the district where they were drowned. They went round the river Colptha then to its source at Belat Alióin and spent the night at Liasa Liac. It is so called because they made sheds (liasa) for their calves there between Cúailnge and Conaille. They came through Glenn Gatlaig and the river Glais Gatlaig rose in flood against them. Before that its name was Sechaire, but from that time it was called Glais Gatlaig because they had taken their calves across bound together with wither. They spent the night in Druim Féne in Conaille.\n\nThose then were their journeyings from Cúailnge to Machaire according to this version. But other authors and books give a different account of their wanderings from Findabair to Conaille, which is as follows\n\nThe Harrying of Cúailnge\n\nWhen they had all arrived with their booty and assembled at Findabair Cúailnge, Medb said Let the army be divided here. All the cattle cannot be taken by one route. Let Ailill go with half of them by Slige Midlúachra. Fergus and I will go by Bernas Bó nUlad. The half of the drove that has fallen to our share is not lucky for us, said Fergus. The cattle cannot be taken across the mountain unless they are divided. So it was done. Whence comes the name Bernas Bó nUlad.\n\nThen Ailill said to Cuillius, his charioteer: Spy for me today on Medb and Fergus. I do not know what has brought them thus together. I shall be glad if you can bring me a proof. Cuillius arrived when they were in Cluichri. The lovers remained behind while the warriors went on ahead. Cuillius came to where they were, but they did not hear the spy. Fergus's sword happened to be beside him and Cuillius drew it out of its scabbard, leaving the scabbard empty.\n\nThen he came back to Ailill. Well? said Ailill. Well indeed, said Cuillius. Here is a proof for you. That is well, said Ailill. They exchanged smiles. As you thought, said Cuillius, I found them both lying together.\n\np.155\n\n{translation of lines 1053-10901} She is right (to behave thus), said Ailill. She did it to help in the cattle-driving. Make sure that the sword remain in good condition. Put it under your seat in the chariot, wrapped in a linen cloth.\n\nThen Fergus rose up to look for his sword. Alas! he cried. What ails you?asked Medb. I have wronged Ailill, said he. Wait here until I come out of the wood, and do not wonder if it is a long time until I return. Now in fact Medb did not know of the loss of the sword. Fergus went off, taking his charioteer's sword in his hand. In the wood he cut a wooden sword. Hence the Ulstermen have the place-name Fid Mórdrúalle.\n\nLet us go on after the others, said Fergus. All their hosts met in the plain. They pitched their tents. Fergus was summoned to Ailill to play chess. When he came into the tent Ailill began to laugh at him.\n\nFergus said: Well for the man who is being laughed at if he be not deluded by the foolish violence of his fateful deed. By the point of my sword, halidom of Macha, swiftly shall we wreak vengeance on swords following on a cry (for help) from the Gaileóin had not a woman's triumph misdirected (me); following on a tryst bloody and gravestrewn and with blunt-edged spears between a great host with [their] commanders, there shall be fought a battle [extending] to the mountain of Nessa's grandson (Cú Chulainn) by a stout host, and the battle shall scatter the headless trunks of men.\n\nThen Ailill spoke: Do not wage battle after the loss of your sword ... It defends Medb against many tribes ... Sit down then, said Ailill, so that we may play a game of chess. Your arrival is welcome. Then Ailill said Play chess and draughts before a king and a queen. They have prepared a game for great eager armies. It matters not(?) what stake you lay ... I am well- skilled. Perhaps in truth the first guilt will lie on the women ... Findabair loves the bold Fergus, Fergus mac Rossa Róich with lowing cattle and great armies surrounded(?) by tribes with great possessions, Fergus with the beauty of a king, the fierceness of a dragon, the venemous breath of a viper, the powerful blow of a lion. Then they began to play chess. They moved the gold and silver chessmen across the bronze chessboard.\n\np.156\n\n{translation of lines 1091-1136}\n\nAilill was heard speaking: It is not the due of a king ...  Medb was heard to say: Cease those uncouth speeches. A noble lady is not the secret love of a stranger ... I am not given to destruction and unjust judgments ...  Then Fergus was heard saying: Alas! With many words they wage war facing many tribes, and with secret counsels they will be nourished(?) and with treasure they will be bewitched(?), and with spears they will be cleared away ... that is, you will be obeyed. They remained there that night and on the following morning they heard Ailill say A great champion comes to face the mighty army by Cronn, the river of Nessa's grandson. The men of Connacht will fight against an opponent. There will flow streams of blood from headless necks in a bloody and grave-strewn meeting of heroes. Many waters rise up against the beardless champion who will come from Ulster to the fray.\n\nThen Medb spoke: Do not contend, O arrogant son of Máta ... men are herded together, women are carried off ... great armies propose to come from the battle-field of Cúailnge and the hosts sleep on. Fergus was heard: Let a great prince(?) be seized ... Let them swear by their people, let them make promises to their queens, let them fight against their enemies. Medb was heard saying: Let what he says be done, let it be done. Medb spoke: He judges in submission to you for many armies. Let them advance while Ailill is in your power... They set forth on their way to the river Cronn, and Mane mac Ailella was heard to say: If I am quickly sent forth against a fair opponent of many feats, he will ward off father and mother on horned cattle ... \n\nThen Fergus was heard saying: Do not go, O valorous boy. They will give no other counsel until a beardless lad shall strike your head from your neck ...  Let me go in front with the banished Ulstermen, said Fergus, to make sure that the lad gets fair play, with the cattle before us and the army in our rear, and the women folk behind the army.\n\np.157\n\n{translation of lines 1137-1176}\n\nThen Medb was heard saying: Hark, O Fergus! for the sake of your honour ... ward off (the enemy) with your fine army. Do not drive away the Ulstermen ... In Mag nAí you prevail over a meeting of companies.\n\nFergus spoke: Alas! O foolish Medb whose voice I do not hear ... I am not the son of a weakling ... I shall not strike a great blow upon the tribes. Cease to cast stones at me ... \n\nCú Chulainn came to Áth Cruinn to meet them. My friend Láeg, said he to his charioteer, the armies are coming towards us.\n\nLáeg spoke: I swear by the gods that I shall perform a great deed in front of chariot- warriors in the small remnant of the battle. They are carried on slender steeds with silver yokes and golden wheels (on their chariots) ... You will march against kings. They will conquer with their power of leaping.\n\nCú Chulainn spoke: Take heed, O Láeg, that you grasp the reins with the great victory of Macha ... I beseech the rivers to come to my help. I call upon heaven and earth and especially the river Cronn to aid me.\n\nThe plaintive river Cronn offers them resistance and will not let them cross into Muirthemne until the work of warriors is finished in the mountain north of Ochaíne.\n\nThereupon the river rose in flood as high as the tree-tops.\n\nMaine, the son of Ailill and Medb came forward before the others. Cú Chulainn slaughtered him on the ford and thirty horsemen of his household were submerged in the water. Cú Chulainn overthrew thirty-two of their brave warriors again at the river. They pitched their tents at that ford. Lugaid mac Nóis uí Lomairc Allchomaig accompanied by thirty horsemen came on a fleeting visit to parley with Cú Chulainn.\n\nWelcome, Lugaid, said Cú Chulainn. If birds fly over Mag Murthemne you shall have a barnacle goose and a half. Or else if fish swim into the estuaries you shall have a salmon and a half. Or else you shall have three sprigs, a sprig of cress, a sprig of laver, a sprig of seaweed. A man shall take your place (to fight) at the ford. That is welcome, said Lugaid. I wish all goodness of the tribe for the lad. Your army is fine, said Cú Chulainn.\n\np.158\n\n{translation of lines 1177-1214} You will not suffer even though the company you bring against them is few, said Lugaid. Grant me fair play and goodly combat, said Cú Chulainn. O friend Lugaid, do the army hold me in fear? I swear by the god of my people, said Lugaid, that not one man or two dare go outside the camp to make water unless they go in companies of twenty or of thirty. It will be a fine thing for them, said Cú Chulainn, if I begin to pelt them with stones from my sling. If every man's strength is put forth against me, it will be right for you, Lugaid, (to remember) your alliance with the men of Ulster. Tell me now what it is that you want. I want a truce from you for my company.\n\nYou shall have that provided that they bear a special sign (that I may recognize them.) And tell my friend Fergus that his company too should bear a special sign. Tell the physicians to make their company also bear a sign and let them swear to preserve my life and send me food every night. Lugaid left him then. Now it chanced that Fergus was in his tent with Ailill. Lugaid called him out and gave him the message.\n\nAilill was heard speaking: Cair iss i sanassaib ... Let us go with a small army, to a choice tent and an encampment ...  I swear by the god of my people that it is not so, said Fergus, unless I ask the lad. Come, Lugaid, go and ask him if Ailill and his division of three thousand may join together with my company. Take him an ox and a flitch of bacon and a barrel of wine. Then Lugaid goes to him and gives him that message. I do not mind if he go, said Cú Chulainn. So the two companies joined them. They remained there until night. Cú Chulainn wounded thirty of their warriors with stones from his sling. Or, as some books tell it, they remained there for twenty nights. Your journeyings will be unpleasant, said Fergus. The Ulstermen will recover from their debility and they will crush us into the dust and gravel. We are ill-placed for battle. Come on to Cúil Airthir. It happened that Cú Chulainn went that night to speak with the men of Ulster.\n\nWhat tidings have you? asked Conchobar. Women are taken captive, said he, cattle are driven away, men are slain.\n\np.159\n\n{translation of lines 1215-1251} Who takes them captive? Who drives them away? Who kills them? ... The man foremost in slaughter and killing, Ailill mac Máta, carries them off and Fergus mac Róich, the brave one, who wields a sword ... That is not of much benefit to you, said Conchobar. Today we have been smitten (by the cess) as before.\n\nThereafter Cú Chulainn left them. He saw the army going forth.\n\nAilill spoke: Alas! I see a chariot with bright points ... he will slay men in fords and capture cows, and the thirty will act when the army has come from Laigin. Blood will flow from headless necks. They will fall fighting for the cattle of the Ulstermen in the ford. Cú Chulainn killed thirty of their warriors at Áth Durn. They made no stop then until at nightfall they reached Cúil Airthir. He killed thirty of them at that spot and they pitched their tents there.\n\nAilill's charioteer, Cuillius, was at the ford early in the morning washing the wheels of the chariot. Cú Chulainn hit him with a stone and killed him. Hence the place-name Áth Cuillne in Cúil Airthir.\n\nThey travelled on then and spent the night in Druim Féine in Conaille, as we have related above. Cú Chulainn attacked them there. On each of the three nights that they were there he killed a hundred of them. He let fly at them with his sling from Ochaíne near them.\n\nOur army will not long survive with Cú Chulainn attacking us in this fashion, said Ailill. Let an offer of terms from us be made to him, namely, that he shall have an extent of Mag nAí equal to Mag Muirthemne, the best chariot in Mag nAí and the equipment of twelve men. Or, if he prefer, this plain in which he was reared and thrice seven cumala. And all that has been destroyed in his household or among his cattle shall be made good, and he shall be compensated for it. And let him take service with me, it is better for him than to be in the service of a princeling. Who will go on that mission? they asked. Mac Roth yonder.\n\nMac Roth, the messenger of Ailill and Medbhe it is who could go all round Ireland in one daywent to Delga on that mission, for Fergus believed that Cú Chulainn was in Delga.\n\nI see a man coming towards us, said Láeg to Cú Chulainn. He has yellow hair. He wears the linen garments of his office. In his hand a great club and at his waist an ivory-hilted sword. He wears a hooded tunic with red insertion.\n\np.160\n\n{translation of lines 1262-1286} That is one of the king's warriors, said Cú Chulainn.\n\nMac Roth asked Láeg whose vassal he was. Vassal to yonder man below, said Láeg. Cú Chulainn was sitting stark-naked in the snow which reached up to his thighs, examining his shirt for lice. So Mac Roth asked Cú Chulainn whose vassal he was. Vassal of Conchobor mac Nessa, said Cú Chulainn. Have you no more definite description? That is sufficient, said Cú Chulainn. Where is Cú Chulainn then? asked Mac Roth. What would you say to him? said Cú Chulainn. So Mac Roth told him the whole message as we have (already) related. Even if Cú Chulainn were here near at hand, he would not agree to that. He will not exchange his mother's brother for another king.\n\nOnce again Cú Chulainn was visited (by Mac Roth) and he was told that he would be given the noblest of the (captured) women and the dry kine on condition that he should not ply his sling on them by night even if he killed them by day. I will not agree, said Cú Chulainn. If our base-born women are carried off, then our noble women will work at querns, and if our milch cows are taken away we shall be left without milk. A third time Cú Chulainn was visited by Mac Roth and he was told that he would get the base-born women and the milch cows. I will not agree, said Cú Chulainn. The Ulstermen will take their base born women to bed and base offspring will be born to them, and they will use their milch cows for meat in the winter. Is there anything else then? asked the messenger. There is, said Cú Chulainn, but I shall not tell you. It will be agreed to if some one (else) tell you. I know what it is, said Fergus. The man has arranged that I should make it known. But indeed it is of no advantage to you. These then are the terms: that for a day and a night the cattle shall not be taken away from the ford on which he shall fight in single combat, in the hope that help may come from the Ulstermen to him. And I find it strange, said Fergus, that they are so long in recovering from their debility. It is better for us indeed, said Ailill, to lose one man every day than a hundred men every night.\n\np.161\n\n{translation of lines 1287-1322}\n\nThe death of Etarcomol and the terms offered by the men of Ireland as told to Cú Chulainn by Fergus:\n\nThen Fergus went on that mission. Etarcomol, the son of Ed and Leithrinn, fosterson of Ailill and Medb, followed Fergus. I do not wish you to go, said Fergus, and it is not out of hatred of you that I say so, but I dislike the thought of a fight between you and Cú Chulainn because of your pride and insolence and because of the fierceness and violence, the boldness and fury of your opponent, Cú Chulainn. No good will come of your encounter. Can you not protect me from him? said Etarcomol. I can, said Fergus, provided that you do not provoke a quarrel.\n\nThey set off then for Delga in two chariots. At that time Cú Chulainn was playing draughts with Láeg: the back of his head was towards them and Láeg was facing them. I see two chariots coming towards us, said Láeg. There is a tall dark man in the first chariot. He has dark bushy hair. He wears a purple cloak in which is a golden brooch, and a hooded tunic with red insertion. He carries a curved shield with a scalloped rim of white gold. In his hand he holds a broad spear with perforations from point to upper shaft (?). Across his thighs a sword as long as a boat's rudder. That great rudder carried by my master Fergus is empty, said Cú Chulainn, for there is no sword in the scabard, only a sword of wood. I have been told, said Cú Chulainn, that Ailill came unawares upon Fergus and Medb as they slept, and he took away Fergus's sword and gave it into the keeping of his charioteer, and a wooden sword was put into its scabbard. At that point Fergus arrived.\n\nWelcome, master Fergus, said Cú Chulainn. If fish swim into the estuaries you shall have a salmon and a half; or else if a flock of birds fly over the plain you shall have a barnacle goose and the half of another; or you shall have a handful of cress or seaweed, a handful of laver, a drink from the sand. I shall to go the ford to encounter an opponent if he challenge (you) and you shall be guarded until you shall have slept. I trust your welcome, said Fergus, but it is not for food that I have come. I know what provisions you have here. Then Cú Chulainn received the message from Fergus, and Fergus departed.\n\nEtarcomol remained behind gazing at Cú Chulainn. What are you looking at? said Cú Chulainn.\n\np.162\n\n{translation of lines 1323-1360} You, said Etarcomol. An eye can soon glance over that, said Cú Chulainn. So I see, answered Etarcomol. I see no reason why anyone should fear you. I see in you no horror or fearfulness or superiority in numbers. You are merely a handsome youth with wooden weapons and fine feats of arms. Though you revile me said Cú Chulainn, I will not kill you because of Fergus. But for your being under his protection, I would have sent back your distended loins and your dismembered body behind your chariot to the encampment. Do not threaten me thus, said Etarcomol. As for the wonderful agreement you made, namely, to engage in single combat, it is I who will be the first of the men of Ireland to fight with you tomorrow. Then he went away, but he turned back again from Méithe and Ceithe, saying to his charioteer: I boasted in the presence of Fergus that I would encounter Cú Chulainn tomorrow. It is not easy for me, however, to wait until then. Turn the horses back again from the hill.\n\nLáeg saw what was happening and said to Cú Chulainn The chariot is coming again and has turned its left side to us. That is a challenge which must be met, said Cú Chulainn. Let us go down to meet him at the ford and find out (what he wants).\n\nI do not wish to do what you ask, said Cú Chulainn (to Etarcomol). You must do it, however, said Etarcomol. Cú Chulainn struck the sod beneath his feet and he fell prostrate with the sod on his belly. Begone! said Cú Chulainn. I am loath to dip my hands in your blood. I should have cut you into pieces just now but for Fergus. We shall not part like this, said Etarcomol, until I carry off your head or until I leave my head with you. The latter is what will happen, said Cú Chulainn. Then Cú Chulainn struck him with his sword under his armpits so that his garments fell off him, but he did not cut his skin. Begone then! said Cú Chulainn. No, said Etarcomol. Cú Chulainn touched him then with the edge of his sword and cut his hair off as cleanly as if it had been shaved off with a razor. He did not even scratch his skin. Then since the fellow was troublesome and pertinacious, he struck him on the crown of his head and clove him down to the navel.\n\np.163\n\n{translation of lines 1361-1397}\n\nFergus saw the chariot go past with only one man in it. He turned back to scold Cú Chulainn. It was wicked of you, you whippersnapper, said he, to violate my protection (of Etarcomol). You think my club is short. Do not be angry with me, master Fergus, said Cú Chulainn, ...Do not reproach me, master Fergus. He bowed down and let Fergus's chariot go past him three times. Ask his charioteer if I was the one who instigated the fight. Indeed it was not you, said Etarcomol's charioteer. He said, went on Cú Chulainn, that he would not go away till he carried off my head or left his own head with me. Which would you prefer, master Fergus? Indeed I prefer what has been done, said Fergus, for it is he who was insolent.\n\nThen Fergus put a spanceling band through Etarcomol's heels and dragged him behind his own chariot to the camp. Whenever Etarcomol's body went over rocks, one half would part from the other; when the path was smooth, the two parts would come together again. Medb looked at him. That was not kind treatment for a young hound, Fergus, said Medb. It is no source of annoyance to me, said Fergus, that the mongrel should have waged battle with the great hound for whom he was no match.\n\nThen Etarcomol's grave was dug and his headstone was planted in the ground; his name was written in ogam and he was mourned. That night Cú Chulainn did not attack them with his sling.\n\nThe Death of Nad Crantail\n\nWhat man have you got to encounter Cú Chulainn tomorrow? asked Lugaid. They will give you him tomorrow, said Maine son of Ailill. We can get no one to encounter him, said Medb. Let us make a truce with him till a man be sought for him. A truce was granted them. Whither will you send, asked Ailill, to seek a man to encounter Cú Chulainn? There is no one in Ireland to be got for him, said Medb, unless Cú Roí mac Dáire or Nad Crantail the warrior be brought.\n\np.164\n\n{translation of lines 1398-1434}\n\nOne of Cú Roí's followers was in the tent. Cú Roí will not come, said he. He thinks that enough of his people have already come. Let a message be sent to Nad Crantail then. Maine Andoí went to Nad Crantail. They related their tidings to him. Come with us for the sake of the honour of Connacht. I will not, said he, unless Findabair is given to me. He came with them then. They brought his weapons in a cart from the east of Connacht to the encampment. You shall get Findabair, said Medb, as a reward for encountering yonder man. I shall do so, said he. That night Lugaid came to Cú Chulainn. Nad Crantail is coming to meet you tomorrow. Alas for you! You will not stand out against him. That is no matter, said Cú Chulainn.\n\nAccording to another version it was then that Cú Chulainn chanted the verse: If Nad Crantail should fall.\n\nOn the morrow Nad Crantail went forth from the camp, taking with him nine stakes of holly, sharpened and charred. Cú Chulainn was there engaged in fowling, with his chariot beside him. Nad Crantail cast a stake at Cú Chulainn. Cú Chulainn sprang on to the top of that stake but it did not hinder him in his fowling. Similarly with the other eight stakes. When Nad Crantail cast the ninth stake, the flock of birds flew away from Cú Chulainn who went in pursuit of them. Then, like a bird himself, he stepped on to the points of the stakes, going from one stake to another, pursuing the birds that they might not escape him. They were all certain, however, that Cú Chulainn was fleeing from Nad Crantail.\n\nThat Cú Chulainn of yours, said Nad Crantail, has taken to flight before me. It was to be expected, said Medb, if goodly warriors opposed him, that the sprite would not hold out against bold men. Fergus and the Ulstermen were grieved to hear this. Fíacha mac Fir Fhebe was sent by them to upbraid Cú Chulainn. Tell him, said Fergus, that it was fine for him to attack the warriors as long as he acted bravely. It is better for him, however, to hide himself when he flees from a single opponent, for it is no greater dishonour for him than for the rest of the Ulstermen. Who boasted that I fled? asked Cú Chulainn. Nad Crantail, said Fíacha.\n\np.165\n\n{translation of lines 1435-1469} If he had boasted of the feat I had performed in his presence; it would have become him better, said Cú Chulainn. But he would not boast if only he had a weapon in his hand. You know that I kill no man unarmed. So let him come tomorrow and stand between Ochaíne and the sea, and however early he come, he shall find me waiting there and I shall not flee from him.\n\nCú Chulainn ended the meeting, and he cast his mantle around him after his night watch, but he did not notice the great pillar-stone as big as himself which was beside him and he covered it over between himself and his mantle and sat down beside it.\n\nThen Nad Crantail arrived. His weapons were brought by him in a wagon. Where is Cú Chulainn? he asked. There he is over there, said Fergus. That is not how he appeared to me yesterday, said Nad Crantail. Are you the famous Cú Chulainn? And what if I am? said Cú Chulainn. If you are, said Nad Crantial, then until I carry the head of a little lamb to the camp, I shall not take back your head which is the head of a beardless boy. I am not Cú Chulainn at all, said Cú Chulainn. Go round the hill to him.\n\nCú Chulainn came to Láeg. Smear a false beard on me. The champion refuses to fight with me since I am beardless. So it was done for him. He went to meet Nad Crantail on the hill. I think that better, said Nad Crantail. Grant me fair play now. You shall have it provided that we know it. said Cú Chulainn. I will throw a cast at you, said Nad Crantail, and do not avoid it. I shall avoid it only by leaping upwards, said Cú Chulainn. Nad Crantail threw a cast at him and Cú Chulainn leapt upwards as it came. You do ill to avoid the cast, said Nad Crantail. Avoid my cast upwards also, said Cú Chulainn.\n\nCú Chulainn threw the spear at him but it was upwards he threw so that the spear came down on the crown of Nad Crantail's head and went through him to the ground. Indeed, he cried, you are the best warrior in Ireland! I have twenty- four sons in the encampment. Let me go and tell them what\n\np.166\n\n{translation of lines 1470-1503} hidden treasures I have. And I shall come back so that you may behead me for I shall die if the spear is taken out of my head. Good, said Cú Chulainn, provided that you come back again.\n\nThen Nad Crantail went to the encampment. They all came forth to meet him. Where is the head of the distorted one that you have brought? they all asked. Stay, O warriors, until I tell my tale to my sons and go back again to fight with Cú Chulainn.\n\nHe went off to meet Cú Chulainn and cast his sword at him. Cú Chulainn leapt up so that the sword struck the pillar-stone and broke in two. Cú Chulainn was distorted as he had been when with the boys in Emain. Thereupon Cú Chulainn leapt on to Nad Crantail's shield and cut off his head. He struck him again on his headless neck (and split him) down to the navel and Nad Crantail fell in four sections to the ground. Then Cú Chulainn spoke these words\n\nIf Nad Crantail has fallen, there will be increase of strife. Alas that I do not now give battle to Medb with a third of the host!\n\nThe Finding of the Bull according to this Version\n\nThen Medb went with a third of the army to Cuib in search of the bull and Cú Chulainn followed them. She went along Slige Midlúachra then as far as Dún Sobairche to harry the Ulstermen and the Cruithne. Cú Chulainn caught sight of Buide mac Báin from Slíab Cuilinn with the bull and fifteen heifers. Sixty warriors of Ailill's household formed his company, each man wrapped in a mantle. Cú Chulainn came towards them. Whence have you brought the cattle? asked he. From yonder mountain, answered the warrior. Tell me, where is their cow-herd? said Cú Chulainn. He is where we found him, said the warrior. Cú Chulainn gave three leaps to follow them as far as the ford, seeking to have speech with them. Then he spoke to their leader.\n\nWhat is your name? said he. One who hates you not, who loves you not, Buide mac Báin, said he. Here is this spear for Buide, said Cú Chulainn.\n\np.167\n\n{translation of lines 1504-1539} He cast a small spear at him and it went into his armpit, and his liver on the other side broke in two at the impact of the spear. Cú Chulainn killed him at his ford. Hence the place-name Áth mBuide. Thereupon the bull was brought into the encampment. Then they decided in debate that if Cú Chulainn were deprived of his javelin, he would be no more formidable (than anyone else).\n\nThe Death of Redg the Satirist\n\nThen Redg the satirist went, on Ailill's advice, to ask Cú Chulainn for the javelin, that is, Cú Chulainn's spear. Give me your spear, said the satirist. No indeed, said Cú Chulainn, but I will give your treasure. I shall not accept that, said the satirist. So he wounded the satirist since he did not accept what was offered him, and Redg said that he would bring dishonour on him (by satire) unless he got the javelin. So Cú Chulainn threw the javelin at him and it went right through his head. This treasure was quickly delivered indeed, said the satirist. Hence the name Áth Tolam Sét.\n\nThere is also a ford to the east of that place where the copper from the spear landed. Umarrith (Umashruth) is the name of that ford.\n\nIt was in Cuib that Cú Chulainn killed all those that we have mentioned, namely, Nath Coirpthe at his trees, Cruthen on his ford, Meic Búachalla at their cairn, Marc on his hill, Meille in his stronghold, Bodb in his tower, Bogaine in his marsh.\n\nCú Chulainn turned back again into Mag Muirthemne. He preferred to guard his own homeland. After going there he killed the men of Crochen (or Crónech), that is, Focherda, he cast off twenty men. He come upon them as they were setting up camp, ten cupbearers and ten warriors.\n\nMedb turned back again from the north when she had remained there for a fortnight, ravaging the province, and when she had fought a battle against Findmór the wife of Celtchar mac Uthidir. After the destruction of Dún Sobairche in the territory of Dál Riada against Findmór she carried off fifty women captives. Wherever in Cuib Medb planted her horsewhip is named Bile Medba. Every ford and every hill by which she spent the night is named Áth Medba and Dindgna Medba. Then they all met at Focherd, Ailill and Medb and the men who drove the bull. His herdsman took the bull from them but by beating their shields with sticks they drove the bull across into a\n\np.168\n\n{translation of lines 1540-1577} narrow pass and the cattle trampled the herdsman into the ground. His name was Forgemen. And the hill there is called Forgemen.\n\nTheir only anxiety that night was to get some one from among them to contend with Cú Chulainn at the ford. Let us ask Cú Chulainn for a truce, said Ailill. Let Lugaid go on that mission, said they all. So Lugaid went to speak with him. What do the army think of me now? asked Cú Chulainn. They think that the request you made of them is a great disgrace, namely, that they should return to you your women and girls and half your cattle. But they think it more grievous than anything else that you should go on killing them and yet be provided with food by them. Then every day for a week a man fell there at Cú Chulainn's hands. Terms of fair play were broken against him; twenty men were sent to attack him all together, but he killed them all.\n\nGo to him, Fergus, said Ailill, and ask if he will allow us to move camp. So they went then to Crónech. In that place there fell by him in single combat two men called Roth, two called Lúan, two female thieves, ten jesters, ten cupbearers, ten men called Fergus, six called Fedelm and six called Fiachrach. All these were killed by him in single combat. Then when they had pitched their tents in Crónech, they debated as to what they should do about Cú Chulainn.\n\nI know what is right in this matter, said Medb. Send a message asking him to grant a truce with the host and say that he shall have half the cattle that are here. That message was taken to him. I shall do so, said Cú Chulainn, on condition that you do not violate the agreement.\n\nThe Meeting of Cú Chulainn and Finnabair\n\nAithremail went to him, and he went first to Láeg. Whose vassal are you? he asked. Láeg did not address him. Maine asked him the same question three times. I am Cú Chulainn's vassal, said Láeg, and do not plague me lest perchance I strike your head off. What a bad-tempered fellow ! said Maine turning away from him.\n\np.169\n\n{translation of lines 1578-1611} So then Maine went to speak to Cú Chulainn. Cú Chulainn had taken off his shirt and was sitting in the snow up to his waist while around him the snow had melted a man's length, so great was the fierce ardour of the warrior. Maine asked him three times in the same way whose vassal he was. Conchobor's vassal, and do not plague me. If you bother me any more, I shall cut off your head as the head is cut off a blackbird. It is not easy to speak to these two, said Maine.\n\nHe left them then and told Ailill and Medb what had happened. Let Lugaid go to him, said Ailill, and speak to him (and offer him) the maid.\n\nSo Lugaid went and gave Cú Chulainn the message. Friend Lugaid, said Cú Chulainn, this is a trick. It is the word of a king, said Lugaid. There will be no trickery. So be it done, said Cú Chulainn. Thereupon Lugaid went from him and told that answer to Ailill and Medb.\n\nLet the jester go disguised as me, said Ailill, wearing a king's crown on his head. And let him stand far away from Cú Chulainn that he may not recognize him. And the girl shall go with him and he shall betroth her to Cú Chulainn. They shall come away quickly then and very likely you will deceive Cú Chulainn in that way and he will not hinder you until such time as he comes with the Ulstermen to the great battle.\n\nSo the jester went, accompanied by the maid, to Cú Chulainn and from afar off he addressed him. Cú Chulainn went to meet them. But in fact he recognized by the man's speech that he was a jester. He threw at him a sling-stone which he had in his hand and it went into the jester's head and drove his brains out. He came to the girl. He cut off her two plaits and thrust a stone through her mantle and her tunic. Then he thrust a stone through the middle of the jester. Their two pillar-stones are still there, Finnabair's stone and the jester's stone. Cú Chulainn left them thus.\n\nMessengers came from Ailill and Medb in search of their people, for it seemed to them that they had long been gone. They were found in that plight. The whole story spread through the camp. Thereafter there was no truce between them and Cú Chulainn.\n\nThe Combat of Munremar and Cú Roí\n\nWhen the hosts were there in the evening, they saw one stone thrown at them from the east and another thrown to meet it from the\n\np.170\n\n{translation of lines 1612-1644} west. The stones collided in the air and they kept falling between Fergus's camp and that of Ailill and that of the Érainn. This performance went on until the same time next day, and the hosts were standing, holding their shields over their heads to protect them from the battle-stones, until the plain was full of stones. Hence the name Mag Clochair. In fact it was Cú Ruí mac Dáire who had done this; he came to help his follower"
