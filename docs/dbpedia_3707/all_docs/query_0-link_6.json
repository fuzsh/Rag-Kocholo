        "text": "BOTH EARS AND THE TAIL FOR THIS CARMEN\n\n\"World Passions,\" the collection of four works that Boston Ballet opened at the Opera House last night, was more pleasant than passionate until Kathleen Breen Combes sashayed out as the title character in Jorma Elo's Carmen .\n\nREVIEW: ANTICHRIST\n\nLars von Trier’s controversial freak-out is Saw VI as told by Carl Dreyer. Is that a good thing? It certainly has grabbed everybody’s attention. I’m torn between dismissing the film as gross-out juvenilia and regarding it as raw religious mythmaking.\n\nCAN THE RHODE ISLAND TEA PARTY BREW A REVOLUTION?\n\nThe Rhode Island Tea Party, local wing of the national uprising against all things Obama, has some reason for hope.\n\nHOW GAY IS SOUTHIE?\n\nWelcome to the gayborhood.\n\nHARDBOILED HUB\n\nWhen I was growing up in Roslindale a few decades back — among tribes of ignorant, second-generation immigrant kids whose favorite words began with “f” and “n” and who liked to torture small animals and beat up small children before they moved on to their future vocations as petty criminals, dead dope users, or real-estate agents.\n\nAFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A WEALTHY REDOUBT\n\nBarrington, not exactly known for its welcome mat to working poor families, now has its first affordable housing project in living memory.\n\nHOW GAY IS SOUTHIE?\n\nWelcome to the gayborhood.\n\nREVIEW: ANTICHRIST\n\nLars von Trier’s controversial freak-out is Saw VI as told by Carl Dreyer. Is that a good thing? It certainly has grabbed everybody’s attention. I’m torn between dismissing the film as gross-out juvenilia and regarding it as raw religious mythmaking.\n\nKHAZEI, LIKE A FOX?\n\nIf there is to be a candidate in the Massachusetts US Senate race who inspires the sort of grassroots, progressive following that propelled Governor Deval Patrick into office three years ago — an insurgent candidacy, if you will — it figures to be idealistic public-service advocate Alan Khazei, co-founder of City Year and founder of Be the Change, Inc.\n\nBRUTE FORCES\n\nWhen you get down to it, most music is an attempt to create auditory allegories for our life experiences, whether they’re joyous Maypole dervishes or nightmarish St. Vitus’ dances of doom."
