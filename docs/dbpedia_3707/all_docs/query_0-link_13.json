Mary, &c.\n\nA Discription of the Island of Britain, with its Original Denomination, &c.\n\nTHE Island of Great Britain, whose Fame has travel'd with the Sun, and reached the remotest Kingdoms of the Earth, is bounded with Germany and Denmark on the East, or properly with the German Ocian, on the West with Ireland, or the Irish Seas on the North, with the Ducalidonian Seas; and on the South, with France and Normandy, scituate in the eighth Climate of the North Latitude, and placed in relation to Longitude between the Parrals of fourteen and sixteen, Containing in length from Strathy-Head in the Kingdom of Scotland, to the Lizard point in Cornâ£wal, Six Hundred Twenty Four Miles, and in Breadth, from the Isle of Thannet in Kent, to the Lands end in Cernwal, Three Hundred and Forty Miles, though forâ£merly its Limits were Fancied from the Orcadâ¢â¢s, to the ãâ¦ããâ¦ã Mountainâ¢â¢\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nAs for the time of its being peopled, (even the most curious Historians vary) some hold it to be inhabited long before the Flood, and that being a part of France, it was by the Rapid Inundation of the Universe, broken off from the Continent, where now the Channel parts Dover from Calais; and by that means, being left by the Flood, became an Island: But this I conceive only conjectural, without any warrantable Testimony; and is grounded upon the Pariety of the Soils, and Temâ£prature of Air. Since that, there are others that will have it possessed by one Albion a Gyant, who beat out the Samotheans, whose Gigantick Race increased till the time that King Brute, Coasting these Seas with a powre of Trojans under his Command, observing its spaciousness and fertility, made a Descent, and subâ£dued it; and of this latter Opinion, is the so much Ceâ£lebrate Antiquary and Historian, Jeffry of Monmouth; and from this Trojan Prince he would have us believe, the Island took its Name: But those, who have seriâ£ously enquired into the Date, he proposes for the Landâ£ing of Brute, viz. In the 2887 Year of the worlds Creation, find not any Foundation to Build a belief, that such a Man was ever in these Parts; but rather the Name was derived from the word Prith or Brith, signifying Painting, and probably the Greeks, who were then the greatest Navigators, Sailing along the Coast, and perceiving the painted People that inhabited it, might, from that signification, give it a Name, as inâ£deed they did to most Islands and Countries, that were not Civilized, where ever they came; or it might be from the word ã in non-Latin alphabet ãã in non-Latin alphabet ãMettals, for its abounâ£ding with Mettals, as it had done that of Albion, from Albis Rupibus, viz. White Rocks, that appear towards the Coast of France.\n\nThese are the Conjecturals, and we might run on in a maze of uncertainty, till we tired the Reader; conâ£sidering, that, before the Landing of the Romans, thâ¢â¢ People were uncivilized, keeping no Writings or Râ¢â¢ cords of their Country or Actions, to Druids or Priests\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nthemselves being a kind of Magicians, or such as dealt in Spells and Charms, preserving their Religious Rites and Ceremonies in Hieroglipicks and Figures, after the manner of Egypt, the better to create an Awe and Dread upon the more ignorant, and raise an esteem and veneâ£ration of themselves, which otherwise must have much abated the Credit they had gained: But leaving things that are doubtful, and have never been fully cleared by the most curious and industrious Writers, we come to what is more warrantable, and for what we have sureâ¢â¢ grounds (laying aside the Story of the Samothes, sprung from the ãâããâã Son of Japhat, perhaps as Fabulous as the rest) and that is to the Year of the Worlds Creatiâ£on, 3873. Viz.\n\nCaius Julius Caesar, by the prevailing Arms of the Roman Commonwealth, having subdued Gallia, now France, and a great part of Germany, thirsty of new Glory, by Conquest, being invited hither by Andragiâ£us, one of the Sons of King Lud, upon a Quarrel that happened between him and his Uncle Cassibelan. King of the Trinobantes, he, from the Shoars of Gallia, viewâ£ing the Coast, and finding, by Report and Scituation, that it was fair and fruitful, in a temperate Climate; and that its Conquest would highly redound to his Honour, and the Advantage of the Roman People, he setled, as well as the shortness of the time, would permit the new Conquests, and prepared an extraordâ¢â¢â£nery Fleet of Ships, and smaller Vessels, for the Transâ£portation of his Army; yet had he much ado to makâ¢â¢ the Legions Imberque, who perceiving the dreadful Rocks on the distant Shore, together with the roughâ£ness and danger of the Sea, complained, That after all the Toiles and Hardships they had indured, he was now aâ£bout to carry them into another World; for so they esteeâ£med this great Island.\n\nCaesar, notwithstanding the speed that attended his Expeditions, was not so silent in his Preparation, but the Britains had notice of it from such of the Gauis, as had made their escapes in small Barques; and upon his atâ£tempting\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nto land, he found the Shores between Dover and Sandwich covered with the armed Britains, under Casibâ¢â¢lan and other Kings, who disputed his landing with great resolution and sury, beating him twice from the Shore, with the loss of his Sword, and the no small danger of his Person, which constrained him to put his Archers on board small Vessels, whose Shot (to which the Britains were not accustomed) made them retire, whilst under that Favour he landed part of his Legions, yet long was it before he could make good his ground, with the loss of his huge Fleet broken to pieces by the fury of the Tempest, and a great number of his Men slain in divers Conflicts and Skirmishes, for the Natives sighting partly in hook-armed Waggons, or their faâ£shion'd Chariots of War, and partly on foot with Spears, small imboss'd Shields, and large Swords, being exceeâ£ding nimble, charged and retired in Parties as they saw it convenient, and when in any Battel they were worâ£sted, they betook themselves to fortified Woods, which served them in the nature of Castles: So that in the end this great Conquerour, tired with continual Alarums, thought it convenient to make a Peace with those Kings that had opposed him, and taking Hostages, he returned to France, there to quiet some new Commotions that were arisen.\n\nThe People, in the condition Casar found them, were tall, big-bodied, strong, and greatly addicted to hardship, having few Towns, unless such as were the Capitals of their Kings, but lived in fortified Woods, the Men being allowed as many Wives as they could keep, fierce and cruel, yet sparing in Dyet, and not much adâ£dicted to Labour, so that the Ground lay mostly untilâ£led; and when they sowed their Corn, they only strewâ£ed it on the Earth, and harrowed it over with Bushes, on which they laid considerable weights; and being carried away with a notion of the Pythagorians, they forâ£bore very much to kill or destroy the Creatures lest they should unhouse the Souls of their Friends and nearest Relations, which they concluded at their deaths had\n\ndescription Page 5\n\npassed by Transmigration into them; so that Hares, Hens, and Geese especially, were found in such plenty, and so same, that it was admirable, with great store of delicious Fruits, which Nature of her own accord had produced.\n\nThe Trade of the Britains, if any abroad, was very inconsiderable; for, as Casar observes, their Boats were for the most part Leather drawn over Wicker of Osiers, or such as were fewed together with Thongs, so that they durst not venture far from the shore, nor did they trouble themselves with any store of Provision when they Sailed. The better sort were clad, but they mostâ£ly with Skins, which they had not the art to dress; taking a ãâããâã of pride in Nakedness, for as much as beâ£ing Young, they Raised and Sâ¢â¢arrified their Skins into Carved Works, of Bâ¢â¢rds, Bâ¢â¢asls, Trâ¢â¢es, Flowers, Fist, Sunâ¢â¢, Mconâ¢â¢, Sâ¢â¢rs, and the like; it bâ¢â¢ing a Trade oâ¢â¢ Imployment, to persons well versed in iâ¢â¢ as well as Paiâ¢â¢ting or Carving at this Day; and in there Sears they suppled the Juice of Would or Woâ¢â¢d, which not only couloâ¢â¢red their Bodâ¢â¢â¢â¢, ãâããâã sinking in where the Skin gave way, left a lasting Stain that grew up with them to Maturity, fortifying their Bodys by shutting up the ãâããâã against heat or cold; and though they lived in a sind of a state of Innocency, sequâ¢â¢stered from the hurâ£ry and business of more Civiliz'd Mations, yet being under many Governours, they frequently Wared upâ£on each other through Emulation; though their Riches were inconsidâ¢â¢rable, their Coyn, or what was Courant amongst them, being only Brass or Irsn, Ringâ¢â¢, Boxes, Oâ¢â¢nches, at a certain Sieze or Weight, though afterward, by the Example of the Romans, they stamped Silver and Gold, with sundry Devices, Imbosâ¢â¢ Shield ways. They made their Drink of Barly, boiled in Water, but took little account of Milk, and less of their Cattle, taking great pride in shaving themselves all but the upâ£per Lip, which they did in imitation of the Gauls, wearing Iron Chains about their Necks and Wasts, with Brass Rings on their Fingers, as Ornaments; and\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nthey had Women in common, amongst Brothers and Parents, and the Issue was attributed to him who first gathered her Virginity.\n\nAs for the Religion of the Antient Britains (if so I may term it, and not rather a Diabolieaâ¢â¢ Delusion) it was Superstitious and Barbarous for the Druids or Priests, whom they held to be very Oracles, gave themâ£selves up to Witchcrasts and Inchantments, mutteâ£ring horrid Charms, pretending to raise Stoâ¢â¢ms and Tempests, to call for Lightning and Thunder: Nor was their Idolatry less, for they had Images, almost without number, to which they prayed, and made Sacrifice under certain Names and Figures, as the Priests directed, not sparing to offer the Flesh of their Enemies taken in War, and amongst them, even Priest-craft reigned in those days; for Excommunicaâ£tion was of great Force, and the Theologie they held, was, that the Soul being Immortal, lost not, nor lesâ£sened in its Existence by the dying of the Body, but passed in its Existence by the dying of the Body, but passed into another, either rational or irrational Creaâ£ture, and their Pxiests were Judges in all Civil Controâ£versies.\n\nThis was the state of the Britains, when the Romans same first acquainted with the Island and those of Enâ£gland, so named since that time, from a place in Denâ£mark called Engelon, or from the East Augles, were diâ£stinguished by their Cantons or Tribes, in the following order and possession, viz. The Cantij possessed Kent; the Regni, Sâ¢â¢ssex and Surry; the Durotriges, Dorset-shire; the Damnoni, Devon-shire and Cornwal; the Belgâ¢â¢e, Somerâ£set-shire, Wilt-shire, and Sonthampton-shire; the Atrebati, Bark-shire; the Dubuni, Oxford-shire and Glocester-shire; the Catieuclani, Warwick-shire, Buckingham-shire, and â¢â¢edford-shire; the Trinobantes, Hartford-shire, Essex, and Middl sex; the Icenij, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge-shire and Huntington-shire, the Conitani, Lincoln-shire, Rutlandâ£shâ¢â¢re, Northampton-shire, Leicester-shire, Dâ¢â¢rby-shire, and Nottingham-shire; the Cornaby, Stafford-shire, Worcester-shire, Cheshire, and Shropshire.\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nThe Cantons of Wales had likewise their order and division, viz. The Ordovices possessed Flintshire, Carâ£narvan-shire, Denby-shire, Mountgomery-shire, and Meâ£rionoth-shire; the Silures Hereford-shire, Radnor-shire, Brecknock, Monmouth, and Glamorgan-shire; The Dimetâ¢â¢e Carâ¢â¢marden-shire, Pembrook-shire, and Carâ£digan-shire; the Ottodini & Brigantes Parisi were accounâ£ted separate from the former, and possessed themselves of York-shire, Lancashire, Durham, Richmond, Counâ£ty Westmorland, Cumberland, Northâ¢â¢mberland; and the latter, sometimes of March, Teifidale, Twâ¢â¢edale and Louthian: These Divisions had their respective Heads or Governours, to whom they made Acknowledgment, and payed some inconsiderable Tribute; though most of that kind fell to the share of the Priests; and indeed their Riches was but small, for Cesar, when he found he had a considerable Advantage over the Southren part of this Island, layed no greater Tax upon them, than three hundred pounds a year, as a Tributary Acknowâ£ledgment to Rome: We might insist on the Tribes that were possessed of Scotland, and the Island, belonging to Great Britain, but not being much to the purpose, it is convenient to pursue the more materialpart of History.\n\nThis part of Great Britain, is the most plentiful, aâ£bounding with all Things necessary for the pleasure and Support of Humane Life, and was named (as is said) England, from Englone, a place in Denmark; or as some will have it, from a People, called East Angles, who placed themselves in the Eastern part of it, in the time of the Saxons; which name, neither the Danes nor Norâ£mans, in their Conquests, thought fit to Change or Alâ£ter; so that it contained it for the space of eight hunâ£dred seventy three years, when King James united it with Scotland, 1602. and restored the Ancient Name of Great Britain; and such Reputation it all along had, aâ¢â¢ to gain the fifth place in General Councils, and was stiled (for the abundance of Plenty it afforded, to Supply the Neighbour Nation) the Store-house of the Western world, for from henâ¢â¢s, even in early days,\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nthe Romans were wont yearly to Lade eight hundred Vesâ£sels with Corn, for the supply of their Armies in other Countries; so that it has been often taken for the Forâ£tunate Island, mentioned by antient Wâ¢â¢iters, especiâ£ally the Grâ¢â¢cians: But above all, it has been the pecuâ£liar Care of Heaven, in that the Christian Faith was planted here, in the sixty third year of our Sâ¢â¢viours Inâ£carnation; and it is held (not without good groundâ¢â¢) that Josâ¢â¢ph of Aramathca, was sent hither by Philip, the Apostle of France, and that he was Buried at Glâ¢â¢ssâ¢â¢nbury; and some will have it, and shew much Reason for it, that St. Paul was here, and Preached the Gospel: Howâ£ever, this is certain, It enjoyed the first Christian King, in the person of King Lucius, and gave birth to that Glorious Propagator of Christianity, Constantine, the great Emperor of Rome: But thus much for History in General, from whence we proceed to what is more particular.\n\nThus Fame, to breath our Nations Glory's proud: Hark!

Andragius and Tâ¢â¢mantius, their Uncle Cassibelane (by the Fathers\n\ndescription Page 9\n\ndirection) took upon him the Government, till they should be of Age, stiling himself Prince of the Trinâ¢â¢â£bants, or new Troy, as some will have it; being the most powerful of all the Princes of the Britains, and when his Nephews were capable of Rule, he gave to Andragius Trinovant, the Dukedom of Kent; and to Temantius the Dukedom of Cornwal, reserving to himself the City of Verilum, now St. Albons, and other â¢â¢ependances: But Andragius being dissatisfied with his Uncle, and hearing the Fame of Caesars great Actions, â¢â¢mplored his Assistance against him; and so far preâ£vailed, that he came over, and Overcame this Prince, after a long and obstinate Resistance, wherein eighty thousand were slain on both sides, at sundry times, and the Country's Amerced for breaking the Truce; and when he left the Island, Andragius, with a great many British Souldiers, went along with him, to help him in his Wars against Pompey the Great, whom he Overâ£threw in the Pharsalian Fields. So that, after the death of Cassibelan, who expired at York: Temantius possessed both his Father's and Uncle's Dominions; nor had Caesar only this Prince to Contend with, but likeâ£wise Cingitorix, Taximagul, and Caravil, petty Kings of Kent; but his Fortune prevailing against them, their Men slain, and they routed; the first was taken, and the two last fled: So that the Roman Arms growing dreadful to the rest of the Princes, after they had lent what Assistance they could, and found themselves too weak to Oppose a prevailing Conqueror, Senimagues, Ancalites, Bibroses, and the rest of the States of Icenij laid down their Arms, and submitted, as did many oâ£thers: However, Câ¢â¢esar rather shewed the Romans this Island, than subdued it, or knew the Extent of it; for neither by Arms, or Intelligence, could he discover, whether it was an Island, or Continent.\n\nCaesar, (after having waded through the World, at a Sea of Blood, and reached the very Pinacle of huâ£mane Greatness) being slain in the Senate House in Rome, by the Conspiracy of the Senators; Augustus\n\ndescription Page 10\n\nCaesar coming to the Imperial Throne, the Britains bâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£gan to bethink themselves of casting off the Romaâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Yoke, under Cunobeline, who held his Regal Seat â¢â¦â¢â¦ Malden in Essex, and had been Kinghted by Julius Gâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£sar; and indeed they went a great way in it; Aâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£gustus prepared three times, utterly to Subdue him, an his Dominions, but was diverted by other Affairs: â¢â¦â¢â¦ that in the twenty third Year of this King's Reign, thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ PRINCE of Peace, our Blessed Lord and Saviour, beinâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Born, the Lyon lay down with the Lamb: An Universâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Peace ensued, according as it had been foretold bâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Prophets. This was the first of the British King that stamped his Image upon his Coyn; and Dying fulâ¢â¦â¢â¦ of years, he was succeeded by Guiderius his Son, whâ¢â¦â¢â¦ was no less desirous than his Father, to shake off thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Roman Tribute: When he heard Augustus Câ¢â¦â¢â¦sar waâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Dead: and Caligula, who was Emperor in his steadâ¢â¦â¢â¦ being denied the Payment, made great preparation against him, but being an Emperor of little Conduct, anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ less Courage; coming to the Belgick shore, he made hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Souldiers gather Shells in their Helmets, whilst thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Trumpets sounded a Charge, as to the Battle, and â¢â¦â¢â¦ returned in a foolish kind of Triumph, proud to haâ¢â¦â¢â¦ taken the Spoils of the Ocean; but Claudius Drusius, whâ¢â¦â¢â¦ succeeded him, overthrew Guiderius, and his Britain under the Conduct of his Deputy; and in the Fighâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the King was slain by the Treachery of one Hamo, whâ¢â¦â¢â¦ (pretending friendship) in a Disguise got near his Peâ¢â¦â¢â¦ son; but being pursued by Arviragus, the King's Bâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£ther, to the shore of the Sea, himself was there diâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£patched, from whose Fall some Antiquaries affirâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Place took the Name of Hamo's Haven, now tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Town of Southampton.\n\nThe Father and Son thus Dead, Catacratus, a secoâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Son to Cunobeline, assumed the Throne; when followâ£ing his Predecessors, in opposing the Romans, he was a great and mortal Battle, overthrown with the loss almost all his People; and himself being taken Priâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£ner, was carried to Rome, where he was led throuâ¢â¦â¢â¦\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nâ¢â¦â¢â¦he streets in a triumph of Derision, to honour Aulus â¢â¦â¢â¦lautinus his Conqueror; yet Togodumnuis the third â¢â¦â¢â¦on of Cunobeline, succeeded him, but with as bad forâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦une; for after he had harazed their Camp, and slain many of them, in such a manner, that Plautinus was obliged to send for the Emperor Drâ¢â¦â¢â¦sius, who â¢â¦â¢â¦rought with him a great Power, a Mortal Battle was â¢â¦â¢â¦ought, in which the British King was slain; yet Arâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦iragus, the last of the Brothers, had leave to Succeed â¢â¦â¢â¦im; and he, for a while, held a fair Correspondency with the Romans, but finding his opportunity fell off, â¢â¦â¢â¦nd joyning with some petty Neighbours, gave the â¢â¦â¢â¦mperor such Apprehensions of Danger, that he â¢â¦â¢â¦hought it best for his Repose, and the Securing the Roman Interest in this Island, to give him his Daughâ£er Genissa in Marriage. This Assinity calmed Affairs for a time, and the Britains having learned the Roman Customes, became much civilized, forgetting their Barbarous Nature, cloathing themselves, and building Houses; so that the Island extreamly Flourished, and â¢â¦â¢â¦ested from War, during the Life of Arviragus, and was very little troubled in the time of Cogidâ¢â¦â¢â¦nus: But Characticus, a Prince of the Silures, growing poâ£werful, by the contracted Forces of his Neighbours, drew into the Field, and beat the Roman Souldiers from their Strenghts, making great Slaughter of them; yet in the end, being Overthrown, he fled to Cartâ¢â¦â¢â¦smandua for shelter and protection; but she, desirous to ingraâ£tiate her self with the Emperor, caused him, contraâ£ty to her Faith plighted, to be delivered up to his Eneâ£mies, who, the better to keep their new Acquiessitions in Peace, sont him to Rome, where, beholding the Magnificence of that Luxurant City, he reproved the Roman Covetousness and Ambition, saying, He admâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£red, that they, being Master, of such glorâ¢â¦â¢â¦ous Tâ¢â¦â¢â¦mples, Structures, and Riches, should nevertheâ¢â¢â¢â¢ss crave after the Cottages, and poor Possâ¢â¦â¢â¦ssions of the Britains: And altho' this Prince was removed, another stood up in his stead, Prâ¢â¦â¢â¦sutagus King of the Icenij; yet\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nfinding himself in no good Condition to Resist, hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ made Peace, and growing near his end, left Queeâ¢â¦â¢â¦-Boduo, and his two Daughters, in the Protection of the Emperor Nero, whom he had made his Heir; but the Ladies being of Incomparable Beauty, and contrary to the Trust reposed, Ravished; the valiant Queen calâ£led together her Friends and Commanders, acquainâ£ting them with the Treachery, and desiring their assistance, telling them, That the Romans were infebleâ¢â¦â¢â¦ by Ease and Luxury; and therefore being resolutely soâ¢â¦â¢â¦ upon, they would fly like a timorous Hare; and at that word (opening her Lap, she let go a Hare, which so the purpose she had concealed.\n\nThis so animated the rest, that they immediatelâ¢â¦â¢â¦ took Arms, and falling upon the Romans, in their toâ¢â¦â¢â¦ much Security, under the Conduct of this Queen, puâ¢â¦â¢â¦ eighty thousand of them to the Sword; but in the enâ¢â¦â¢â¦ New Forces arriving, she was forced to lay down her Arms, and seek for Safety: And next to he Venutius, King of the Brigantes Warred upon them but by the Trechery of his Queen, the faithless Cartâ¢â¦â¢â¦ mandua, he was Overthrown; so that the Roman having pierced into Scotland, Overthrew, in a greaâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Battle, Galgacius, Prince of the Callidonians; anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ finding none to Oppose them, they became absolutâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Masters of the Famous Island of Great Britain: Noâ¢â¦â¢â¦ was it known, that they discovered it, till this time tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ be an Island, which was about one hundred thirty six years after the Landing of Caesar, when, in a far lessâ¢â¦â¢â¦ time they Subdued all France, Germany, and otheâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Countrys insinitely larger, by which we may perâ£ceive,\n\nThe Early Valour of the British Race, Who boldly durst the worlds prou'd Conquerors Face, And put even Rome her self to soul disgrace.\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nAn Historical Account of the Roman Emperors, who were personal in this Island, or Ruled by their Lieuteâ£nants.\n\nCAius Julius Caesar (as you have heard) was the first Roman that set footing in this Island, lanâ£ding in the Year of the worlds Creation, 3873. But he did little more than show it the Romans, laying a small Tribute of 300 pounds upon it, not having passed with Armed Forces (as many hold) beyond St. Albans, then call'd Verillum, finding by the great Resistance he experienced, he had to deal with a stubborn People, over which he had no other advanâ£tage; but being better Armed, and somwhat more expert in the Trains of War; yet, after three Expeâ£ditions, he came no more; but proceeded to put the project, of gaining the Soveraignty of the World, in practice, wherein he was Successful, after the Fatal Battles of Pharsalia, Philipi, and Munda; yet his Aspiring cost him his Life, as has been Related.\n\nOctavian Augustus Caesar, succeeded Julius, after many Troubles, and much difficulty, but came not into this Island, though he thrice intended it; and in this Golden Reign, the SAVIOUR of the World was Born: To this Great Emperor Succeeded Tiâ£berius; in the eighteenth year of whose Reign, The LORD of LIFE was put to Death, to Rise more Gâ¢â¢oâ£rious, and Triumph over Death and Hell, and the proâ£digious Defects in Nature, that attended his Passion; being obâ¢â¢erved by Dionisus Areopagita, as the Ecclipse of the Sun and Moon, &c, He cryed out, that The God of Nature suffered, or the Frame of the world was about to be dissolved: To this Emperor, Caligula Sucâ£ceeded; but the most memorable Act he did, was, the Banishing Pontius Pilate, who, thereupon, grew desperate, & Slew himself: Then came Claudius Druâ£sius, under whom, Aulus Plautinius was Deputy in Britain, who was put so hard to iâ¢â¢, that the Empeâ£ror\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nwas obliged to come over; and, by the Marriâ£age of his Daughter, put an end to the Troubles Nero succeeded him in the Imperial Throne, whose wickednesses are too many to be related in this place: Amongst other things, he Crucified St. Peter, and caused St. Paul to be Beheaded, Burnt the City of Rome, Killed his Wife, Ripped up his Mother, and Perseâ£cuted the Christians with new invented Torments; he did great Injuries to the Britains, by his Lieuteâ£nants, for which Queen Boduo slew Eighty Thousand of his Romans. Sergius Galba began his Reign Anno Dom. 70. But being a Cruel and Desolute Prince, he was Killed by his Souldiers, after he had continued seven Months in the Throne; So that Maximus being then Deputy, the Britains felt not the Effects of his Anger; and thus, Rome wanting a Head, Marcus Sylvius Otho entred upon the Stage, yet Reigned but three Months and five Days, before he made way for Aulus Vitellus, who, after eight Months Reign, was Killed by the Souldiers, and Elavius Vespatian, made Emperor in his stead: So that, in these short Revoluâ£tions, the Britains had Peace; yet, in this last Reign, the Brigantes and Silures, were up in Arms, but Juliâ£us Frontius over-powered them. Petilius being Deâ£puty, the Famous City of Jerusalem, after an obstiâ£nate and bloody Siege, was Taken by the Romans, unâ£der the Lâ¢â¢ading of Titus Vespatian, who succeeded his Father in the Empire, after he had Reigned about nine Years: and Reigned two years, and three months; yet we find not that he had any War with the Britains, but left the Empire to Domitian, his Brother, who raised a Persacution against the Chriâ£stians, by the Example of Nero: Insomuch, that Christianity then beginning to Flourish in this Island, many were cut off, for the Testimony they bore to their Lord and Master: And Julius Agricola, being Deputy, he, upon the Revolt of the Britains, gave them â¢â¦â¢â¦ and in a fearful Overthrow, slew Ten Thousand of them, with the Loss of Three Bundred\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nand Forty of his own Men; and this is he that first discovered this Country to be an Island, and Domiâ£tian, after about fifteen years Reign, dying, Cocâ£â¢â¢eius Nerva came to the Throne of Empire, being a very Charitable Prince; but after ten Months he gave place to Trajan, who raised the Third Persecutiâ£on, and Overthrew the Revolting Britains, by Sparâ£tiaâ¢â¢us his Lieutenant: Leaving the Stage of Honour, after Twenty One Years Six Months, when Adrianus was Proclaimed Emperor; and although he had no War with the Britains, he nevertheless raised a Persecutiâ£on against the Christians, and made the Church of Christ weep Tears of Blood in all Lands, whither his Power extended; yet he Reigned twenty two years: But at length Antonius Pius, who Succeeded him, reâ£strained, & re-called his Cruel Edicts; yet in his time the Britains (rising in Arms) were Overthrown by Lollius Urbicus: Marcus Aurelius taking next upon him the Administration of the Imperial Power, reâ£vived the Persecution, but had no War with the Briâ£tains; and giving place, after nineteen years Reign, Commodius took upon him the Sway of the Empire; and now the Almighty smiling upon this Land (with the brightest Rays of Divine Love) raised up a Chriâ£stian King, and the first that the World had seen, viz. King Lucius, Son to King Ceilus, and Great Grand Child to Arviragius, who Married the Empeâ£ror Drusius's Daughter; and he being more mindful of Religion, (that dearest part of Government) than of any other Consideration, the better to Establish the Work, so prosperously begun, sent two Learned Men to Elutherus, then Bishop of Rome, to be further Instructed in the FAITH; who thereupon sent him Fagarius and Damianus, with his Letter, in the folâ£lowing words:\n\nYou have received, in the Kingdom of Britain, by GOD's Mercy, both the Law and Faith of Christ; you have both the Old and New Testament, out of the\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nsame (through God's Grace) by the Advice of your Realm take a Law; and by the same, through God's Sufferance Rule your Kingdom of Britain; for in that Kingdom you are God's Vicar.\n\nThis I have mentioned, to shew, The honesty and plainness of the Bishops of Rome, before they came to be Debauched, and Corrupted with Pride and Avarice: And this good King so far improved the Adâ£vice, that he immediately Changed the Seats of the three Arch-Flamens, and twenty-eight Flamens, into so many Archiepiscopal, and Episcopal Sees, appointing for the first three, London, York, and Gloucester; and thereupon the Christian Religion, in spite of the Opâ£pressors, grew up like a stately Cedar, and overspread the Land.\n\nHelvius Pertinax, the next Emperor, did nothing of note, having but a short Reign, not exceeding eight Months; and was Succeeded by Didius Julianus who continued not above two Months; neither oâ¢â¢ them having any War with the Britains: Yet in the Reign of Septimus Severius, the Calledonians were up in Arms, and Heraclionus his Deputy, not being able to Quell them, the Emperor came over in Perâ£son, yet could not Effect it, by reason of the Fortresâ£ses and Marshes, where they usually Fortified themâ£selves, with less than the Loss of fifty thousand oâ¢â¢ his men; and the better to Bridle them, he caused a mighty Wall, with Towrs, to be run from Shorâ¢â¢ to Shore; but being come over a second time, (upon new Commotions) he fell Sick, and dyed at York and in his Reign, the fifth Persecution was raised aâ£gainst the Christians. Bassianus Caracala Reigneâ¢â¢ after him six years, and being made Co-Emperor with his Brother Geta, he slew him; yet the Britains werâ¢â¢ not molested, during his Reign; and then he gave place to Opilius Maerinus, who reigned about one year two months; and was Succeeded by Heliogabilus a Lude, Debauched, and Luxurious Emperor, whâ¢â¢\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nhad been formerly Priest to the Son, yet he held the imperial Seat four years, and then gave Place to Alexander Severus, who gave Liberty to the Christiâ£â¢â¢ns, to live peaceably and quiet, without oppression or persecution; but when he had reigned six months â¢â¢nd seven days, he was killed by the Mutiny of the Almain Souldiers, and made way for Maximinus, who â¢â¢aised the sixth Persecution; yet in his time the Briâ£â¢â¢ains were in Peace, but three Years put a period to his Reign, and Julius Varius Maximus mounted the Throne; but he soon after was slain by the Souldiers. And Gordianus, who succeeded him, Reigned but forâ£ty days: For now the Petorian Souldiers began to commit all manner of Disorders, setting the Empire to Sale, raising any one to it for Money; and then, either Killing or Deposing them, made room for more Gain; and instead of One, they sometimes set up Two in Co-partnership, as Claudius Puppienus, and Celius Balbinus, who Reigned only a Year, then Antonius Gordianus Reigned; and after him, Julius Philippus; the one Reigning Four, and the other Five Years: Which short continuance, and the Care they had to Secure themselves, made them little mind what was done abroad; and Lieutenants of Provinces perceiving things go thus unfortunately, did not so much trouble themselves, in Gathering the publick Taxes, as to ingratiate in the Peoples Favour, and enrich themselves by Presents and Offerings, which were daily made them, without runing the hazard of forcing them to Rebel. And now Decius coming to the Imperial Seat, stirred up by the Enemies of the Church of Christ, he raised the seventh Persecuâ£tion; but his Fury continued not, for he reigned but two years, e're he gave way to Trebonianus and Voâ£â¢â¢usianius, who stayed the Persecution, and had Peace with the Britains: But in two years they gave way to Aelmelianus, who reigned not above two months; and though Valerianus, that succeeded him, held not the Dignity above a year, yet being of a Cruel Temâ£per,\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nhe gave vent to his Anger on the Christians, whâ¢â¦â¢â¦ now, in all places, began to Multiply; so that agaiâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Church was forced to wear the bloody Scars of eight Persecution; and under him St. Laurence, anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ St. Cyprian suffered Martyrdom.\n\nThus went on the course of things, in these earlâ¢â¦â¢â¦ times; and as the Wealth of Britain increased, so thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Romans raised their Taxes to a higher pitch; yet thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ people, by this time, being better used to their Guest and interchanged Marriages amongst them, the were not easily to be drawn into Insurrections, espeâ£cially when they considered, they (by the Arts anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Manufacture the Romans taught) were greatly improâ£ved.\n\nAnd now came Galienus to the Imperial Seat, who notwithstanding his fifteen years Reign, had no Waâ¢â¦â¢â¦ with the Britains; and though Flavius Claudius waâ¢â¦â¢â¦ a great hater of Christians, and studied for Torment to destroy them, yet he liv'd not to effect it; but haâ£ving reigned two years without molesting this Kingâ£dom, he gave place to Quintilius, who, rather desiâ£rous of Death than Rule, (as it appeared by the conâ£sequence) opened his own Veins and Dyed, withouâ¢â¦â¢â¦ one way other troubling the Britains.\n\nAurelianus succeeded Quintilius, and reigned five years, without concerning himself with the Affair of this Island; yet he put out severe Educts against the Christians: so that we may reckon under him the ninth Persecution. Tacitus succeeded him; yet reignâ£ed but six Months, e're he gave place to Florianus and he having a shorter Reign, was succeeded by â¢â¦â¢â¦robus, who held the Imperial Seat five years: These â¢â¦â¢â¦ad no War with the Britains; but Marcus Aurelius Carus, hearing they were in Arms to Recover their â¢â¦â¢â¦ Liberty, sent Carantius his Lieutenant, to Quiet them, but he joyned with them; so that the Tribute was denied, during this Emperors Reign: However, Carancius was slain by Alectus, a succeeding Lieuteâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ant. Dioclesian coming to the Throne, greatly\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nPersecuted the Christians; but God (considering â¢â¢he Distress of His People) put an end to his Reign, â¢â¢fter three Years; and so gave Rest to his Church. This Emperor made great Wars in this Island, by his Lieutenant, but with various success; and was â¢â¢ucceeded by Constantius Clorus, who continued the War, and came in Person against the Calledonians and â¢â¢ists: And it was this Emperor, that, finding King Coilus (his Trusty Friend) dead, upon his Arrival Married Helena, his beautiful Daughter; and reignâ£ing about thirteen Years, dyed at York, leaving his Son Constantine the Great, to Succeed him; but he being in his Non-Age, the Throne was Usurped Alterâ£nately by Constantius Galerus, Maximus Severus, Maâ£â¢â¢entius Lucinus, and Martinianus; But at length these were Overcome by the good Fortune of Conâ£stantine the Great, a Britain by Birth, and half so by Parentage; he Alotted part of his Empire to his Sons, and was the first Christian Emperor the world beheld. Some hold, That being about to Persecute the Christians, he was smitten with a Leprosie, and had it Revealed to him in a Vision, That unless he called home Bishop Sylvester, and the rest of the Baâ£nished Clergy, he might dispair of Cure; which acâ£cordingly â¢â¢e did, and found himself in perfect Health, which obliged him to embrace the True Religion: Oâ£thers hold, That being about to give Battle, and doubting the Success, he, all on a sudden, beheld, in the Air, a bright shining Cross, with this Motto, In boc vinces, In this thou shalt overcome: And taking thereupon the Cross for his device, he, accordingly became Victorious; but however it happened, no doubt, God (in Compassion to His bleeding Church, which had undergone ten Cruel Persecutions) raised up this Emperor to Heal her Wounds; and indeed, being Baptized, and Received into the Church, he lest nothing undone that might tend to her Welfare, and the Propagation of the True Religion. Some Wars he had with the Britains, but they not consiâ£derable,\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nwhen after a long Reign, he dyed â¢â¦â¢â¦ Peace.\n\nJulian, called the Apostate, succeeded this gooâ¢â¢ Emperor, begining his Reign Anno Dom. 356. Thâ¢â¢ man, before he came to the Throne, professed Chriâ£stianity, and seemed Zealous to promote it, being person of great Cunning, and much Learning; buâ¢â¢ with the Change of his Condition, his Consciencâ¢â¢ altered, which made many believe, he made Religion but a Stirrup, to Mount the Imperial Throne; foâ¢â¢ then he became their professed Enemy, using all thâ¢â¢ Policy he could, to baffle and destroy their Interest and although he did not violently Persecute them himself, yet he gave way to such as spared no Affront or Indignities; and Writ, with his own hand, a Book to Ridicule the Gospel, calling our Blessed Saviour Gallilean, in derision: When preparing for the Wanâ¢â¢ of Persia, as he Rod forth, he asked one of the Chriâ£stians, What the Carpenters Son was doing at that time He is (replied the good Man, with an holy Anger making a Coffin for your self: At this Julian smiled but whether prophetically spoke, or by chance, it soâ¢â¢ fell out: That riding at the Head of his Army, anâ¢â¢ Arrow, none knowing from what hand it came, Morâ¢â¢ tally wounded him; whereupon, perceiving hiâ¢â¢ Death certain, he drew forth the Arrow, and throwâ£ing up handfuls of his own Blood in defiance to Heaâ£ven, he cried out; Vicisti Galilee, thou haft Overâ£come me O Galilean; and so expired: After whose Death, Jovinianus took the Rule, and had so greaâ¢â¢ a liking to the Christian Religion, that he easilyâ£embraced it, causing the Souldiers and People to do the same; and would often Express himself in these terms: O that I might govern wise men; and wise menâ¢â¢ govern me! His Reign was but short, not exceeding a Year, when he gave place to Valentinianus, in whose Reign the Roman Empire was threatned by the barbarous Nations, who made great Spoil and Desolation; insomuch, that the Legions in Britain,\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nwere drawn off to Assist nearer home; which gave â¢â¢e Picts and Irish an opportunity to Invade and â¢â¢arrass this Kingdom, with great Spoil, and Slaughâ£â¢â¢r of the People, which made them beseech the Emâ£â¢â¢ror for Aid; and Theodosius was sent with a Poâ£â¢â¢er that Repelled the Invaders, and left the Briâ£â¢â¢ins in Peace, but no longer, than till the Romans â¢â¢ere departed: He was moreover a great Favourer â¢â¢f the Christians, restored their Temples, and forâ£â¢â¢id Idolatrous Worship, and Mid-night Sacrifice; and â¢â¢aving found some treacherous dealing amongst his â¢â¢en of War, he was wont to say; Gold was tryed â¢â¢ith the Touch stone, and Men with Gold: And to him â¢â¢ucceeded Gratianus and Valence, the former behaving himself with all due Respect to the Christians, but â¢â¢he latter closed with the Arian Hereticks against them; causing eighty of the Christians to be sent â¢â¢o Sea in a Ship, and there set it on Fire, giving them â¢â¢he choice, either to Drown themselves, or Perish in â¢â¢he Flame: Yet, after a Reign of Six Years, full of Trouble, Maximus, and Valentinianus, took place; but the first held it so short a time, that, in many Authors, he is not mentioned; they had no War with the Britains, and had indeed enough to do, to Deâ£fend themselves; and were succeeded by Theodosius, who began his Reign Anno Dom. 379. under whom the Christian Religion flourished; and Damassus beâ£ing Bishop of Rome, the Second General Councel was held, and now, for the space of six Months, the World was so troubled with Earth-quakes, that the Dissolation, and Ruine they occasioned, is not counâ£table.\n\nArcadius, and Honorius, next took place, viz. 402. In whose Reign a marvellous Thing happened at Constantinople, viz. About Noon, a Fire entering the Great Church, fastned upon the Bishops Seat, and Consumed it; thence growing up like a Pyramid, seized the Roof, and Burnt it, not doing the People, then Assembled, any harm, though it passed through\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nthem; leaving the Church, it passed directly â¢â¦â¢â¦ Senate-House, and reduced it to Ashes: This maâ¢â¦â¢â¦ looked upon, as a Divine Presage of those Miseriâ¢â¦â¢â¦ that soon after befel the Church and State; for noâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Roman Greatness growing to a period, the Braâ¢â¦â¢â¦ ches being too ponderous for the Bole, to Suppoâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Storms of War, that came thundring from sevâ£ral Quarters, rent and tore them in pieces; insâ¢â¦â¢â¦ much, that we may say, The Red Horse, and hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Rider were sent forth, about this time, To take peaâ¢â¦â¢â¦ from the earth: and now the Britains groaned under the weight of their Enemies, the Picts, Scots, anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Wild Irish, who came upon them in great Swarm laying waste all their pleasant places, which madâ¢â¦â¢â¦ them again Address the Romans (who had so lonâ¢â¦â¢â¦ been their Masters) for speedy Succour; but haâ¢â¦â¢â¦ word sent them: That their hands were full of Enâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£mies, and that they could not spare any of their Forcesâ¢â¦â¢â¦ However, Theodosius Junior, and Valentinianus, comâ£ing to the Thrones of the West and East; for now thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Roman Eagle was double headed, a Legion waâ¢â¦â¢â¦ ordered for Britain; upon whose approach, and after some Skirmishes, the Barbarous People retiâ£red; and the Romans, before their departure, taught the Britains the more perfect Exercise of Arms, adâ¢â¦â¢â¦ monishing them to renew, strengthen, & fortifie their Wall from Sea to Sea, and keep Watchmen oâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the Towers to defend them, and give notice of the Enemies approach, seeing they might be confident this was the last time they could expect any Succouâ¢â¦â¢â¦ from Rome; so that after a possession of 597, years the Romans of their own accord left the flourishing Island of Britain, carrying with them, at sundry times, the Flower and Strength of the Land to assist them inâ¢â¦â¢â¦ their Foreign Wars, by which the Britains lay more easie and open to the Inroads and Incursions of their Enemies.\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nâ¢â¦â¢â¦us ãâ¦ããâ¦ã, whom balfe the world obey'd, â¢â¦â¢â¦r conquering ãâ¦ããâ¦ã spread â¢â¦â¢â¦ve hundred ninety seven years, and then â¢â¢fatal times â¢â¦â¢â¦ the Isle again: â¢â¦â¢â¦en blood and ãâ¦ããâ¦ã rag'd in every place, â¢â¦â¢â¦d Crimson Seas had delug'd Natures Face; â¢â¦â¢â¦en 'twas, Great Kingdom, thy sad Woes came on, â¢â¦â¢â¦us plagues o'er took thee, that thou thoughts't to shun, ãâ¦ããâ¦ã friendly seeming Saxons more undone.\n\nãâããâã what means the Saxons came to Conquer this Kingâ£dom, and divide it into a Hepterchie, with their Succession of Kings, and Discription of their reâ£sprective Kingdoms, till it was reduced to a Monarchy, and from thence till conquered by the Danes.\n\nTHE Romans, as we have said, by a voluntary reâ£linquishment having left this famous Island inâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦mbered with restless Enemies, whose Ravages and â¢â¦â¢â¦oils are too many to count, and the poor defenceâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ss Britains quite wearied out with continual Alaâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ms, Slaughters, Burnings, and the Ravishment of â¢â¦â¢â¦eir Wives and Daughters, heartless to defend â¢â¦â¢â¦emselves, and out of all hopes of Assistance from â¢â¦â¢â¦eir old Masters the Romans; they at last understandâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦g the Saxons were a powerful and prevailing Peoâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦e in Germany, who had inlarged their Borders, and one great Actions, resolved to apply themselves to his People for Succour; and hereupon Vertigern â¢â¦â¢â¦e King, with the consent of his Nobles, sent Amâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ssadors to the Heads of the Saxons, and Jutes, ordering upon the Rhine, laying before them the â¢â¦â¢â¦plorableness of the Kingdoms condition, and how was at a point to be lost, the Enemy having alâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ady advanced as far as Stamford in Lincolnshire, â¢â¦â¢â¦ith dreadful Spoil and Devastion, intreating a\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nspeedy Succour and Protection, promising large Reâ¢â¢ wards for the Service. The Saxons having wellâ¢â¢ weighed the thing, upon certain notice of theâ¢â¢ Fruitfulness of the Country, and finding their ownâ¢â¢ Borders to streight and scanty for their numbers,â¢â¢ immediately closed with the request of the Britainsâ¢â¢ dismissing their Ambassadors with a very obligingâ¢â¢ Letter, and instantly drew out 9000 Men, under theâ¢â¢ leading of Hengist and Horsus, two Brothers of aâ¢â¢ noble Family, who with expedition, suitable to theâ¢â¢ imergency of this occasion, landed at Ebsfleet inâ¢â¢ the Island of Thanet, where they were received byâ¢â¢ the King's Order with Songs and congratulations oâ¢â¢ Joy, and then joyning with them such Forces as heâ¢â¢ had drawn together, gave the Enemy Battle withâ¢â¢ great slaughter, defeating and overthrowing them so that they were obliged not only to repass thâ¢â¢ Wall that was drawn from Sea to Sea, as a defenceâ¢â¢ against Scotland, but to leave the Kingdom in enâ£tire peace: So the face of things seemed very muchâ¢â¢ changed, but long this tranquility had not lasted before the two Brothers (the first having married his Daughter Rawena to the doting King, who had falâ£len in love with her, upon a Complement she passed in drinking to him) gave their Soldiers so much liâ£berty, that the People found themselves greatly opâ£pressed, of which reitered Complaints were made and the King used his interest with the Captainsâ¢â¢ to restrain them, but they connived at it, and demandâ£ed larger Pay, giving out, That they would lay thâ¢â¢ Kingdom iu Ashes, if it were denyed them; seizing upon sundry Towns and Castles; so that the Noâ£bles perceiving the King blindly carried away by the counsâ¢â¢ls of his young Wife, on whom he infinitely doated; they consulted with Vortimer his Son, ãâããâã Prince of great Hope and Courage, when drawiâ¢â¢ together what Forces they could, without thâ¢â¢ knowledge of the King, they sell so unexpectedlâ¢â¢ upon the Saxons, that having overthrown them in ãâããâã\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nbloody Battle, they resolved to drive them out of the Land, which accordingly they did, forcing the reâ£mainder, with their Captains, to take shipping and be gone.\n\nThis defeat, and disappointment, so perplext the Brethren, that gathering greater Forces they came aâ£gain, coasting the Country in their Ships and Barks, and under pretence of friendship, and desire to have the Daughter with them, they were permitted quietâ£ly to Land; but here their treachery appear'd, for it being agreed, that so many of theirs should hold a conference, with a like number of the British Nobles, about setling Affairs, and reconciling the Differences between them and the Saxons, under their long Coats they hid short Swords, & during the Treaty, & upon and watch-word given by Hengest, fell upon the unâ£armed Nobles, who expected no such matter, killing all but one Earl, who geting a Hedgestake, made his passage through them, and alarumed the Country with the fatal news: And this some Authors affirm to be done upon Salisbury plain, but, however, the Noâ£bles thus dead, the Juits, Angles and Saxons, fell on with Fire and Sword, killing and destroying all that came in their way, carrying a Torrent of Destructiâ£on from Sea to Sea; so that the poor Britains being utterly disheartned, and destitute of a Head, fled beâ£fore them like Flocks of timerous Sheep to the Mounâ£tains and Fastnesses, many of them living in Rocks, Caves and Woods, upon such as Nature afforded them, to avoid the fury of the destroying Enemy, who resolutely bent upon a total Conquest, daily sent over for more of their Companions, who came in swarms, devouring like Locust all the good things of the Land.\n\nThus the misery of the Britains renewed, and these People began to frame their Government, dividing the Country by Lott into seven Parts or petry Kingâ£doms, called from thence, The Hepterchie of the Saxons in this order.\n\ndescription Page 26\n\n1.

East Angles.\n\nThese they formed into Kingdoms, striving, as much as in them lay, to exterperate the whole Race of the Britains, and raise themselves in their places: Some may be curious to know the Original of this Transmarine People but Originals of this kind are generally obscure, but Historians conjecture they were a branch of the Sacae an Asian People, who came into Europe to find themselves better Habitations, and planted on the Banks of the Rhine. They were upon their arrival in Britain Idolaters, worshipping a God for every day in the Week, and greatly persecuted those they found to persevere in the Christian Faith: And when they went to Battle, they had certain Songs prepared to invoke the favour of their Deities, and were very unmerciful, for they sacrificed every tenth Captive, and would admit of no Ransom.\n\nThe Garments of the Saxons were in the form of a Gassock, clasped over, or pined with wooden Pins their Weapons, bended Swords, with three notches on the back, in the form of a Back-sword, but broader, with fiat sloaping points, and battel Axes, using to try the quarrel of a whole Province, by single Combate, suffering their Virgins to Marry but once; and their Men were forbid plurality of Wives, except they were Noble; and they, only for want of Issue; Adultry they punished were severly.\n\nThese People going under the Denominations, oâ¢â¢ Saxons, Argles, and Jutes, devided the Kingdom, now called England, for King Vortâ¢â¢gorn, being (by his Inâ£râ¢â¢ged Subjects) over-whelmed with wildfier in his Caâ£stle or Pallace, as the cause of all their Calamities, by gâ¢â¢ving (at first) too much way and countenance to thâ¢â¢ ãâããâã, they parted it out as they found themselveâ¢â¢\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nin most power or advantage, by birth; and Hengist having leave to take his Lot, chose Kent, and formed it into a Kingdom, Stiling himself the first King of Kent, begining his Reign 455, and Reigned with great success, 34 years; and was succeeded by Esca or Oscia, from whom the Inhabitants were called Eskins, this Prince began his Reign in the year of our Lord 490, and continued it 24 years, giving place to Octa who Reigned 23 years; and was succeeded by Imerick, who somewhat inlarged his Borders, and continued his Reign till 562; and during his time, was held the seâ£cond General Counsel at Constantinople, for the Estaâ£blishment of the Church; when by the Pious and Exâ£ampler lives, and Preaching of good Men, Christianity, that had been trampled on by the Saxons, began to reâ£vive in Britain; so that Ethelbert, that succeeded Imerick began to harken to them, and upon the Arriâ£val of Austine, the Monk, and Forty others with him, sent by Gregory, Bishop of Rome, he was Converted, and Baptized Anno 596. In the 36th year of his Age, and the 4th year of his Reign, giving a general Liberâ£ty to his Sujects, to Renounce their Paganisme; so that, these good Men (by the Kings Appointment) setling at Canterbury, are reported to Baptize and Conâ£vert 10003. in a very short time; which prosperous Work, by the Influence of Heaven, soon over-spread the Kingdom, and God, accordingly blessed the King with a Long Reign; for he continued in his Throne 36 years, and then was succeeded by Edbald, who, at first, was averse to the Christians, and for fear of him, Melitus, and Justus fled their Bishopricks, but he being Converted by Laurence, Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, they were recalled; but having Reigned 24 years, he gave place to Ercombert Anno 5â¢â¢2. This King brought Christianity to be highlier prized than before, turning the Idol Temples, that had been heitherto allowed. into places of True Worship, commanding the first Lent to be kept, that this Kingdom knew; but after a Reign of 24 years he dyed; and was succeeded by Egâ£bert\n\ndescription Page 28\n\nhis Brother, who basely Murthered Ethelred, and Ethelbert, his two Nephews, Sons to Ercombert, and â¢â¢ast the Dead Bodies into the River Medway; for which (no doubt) his Reign was shorter than any before him for he continued it but 9 years, ending it by Death 666, and was succeeded by Lothaire, who, after holding the Scepter of Kent 11 years, Engageing in a Bloody Waâ¢â¢ against Ethelred King of the Mercians, and Edrick, King of the South Saxons, he was shot through with a Dart which put an end to his Life and Reign. In his time aâ¢â¢ third Counsel was held at Constantinople, being the 6th General Counsel for the Provision and Establishment oâ¢â¢ the Church; Agathus, being Bishop of Rome and Edeâ£rick succeeded this Prince, he held not the Scepter long before his Subjects, (upon a disgust) took Arms against him, and slew him in a pitched Field, maintaining themselves against all Opposers, So that the Kingdom lay destitute of a Head, for the space of six years ãâããâã this Kings Reign being the shortest of any, Viz. two years only; but at the end of 6 years, Withred, hiâ¢â¢ Brother for a great sum of Mony payed to Inas, goâ¢â¢ the Possession, and Reigned 33 years; and there gave place to Egbert, who began his Reign 727, in his time there appeared two fearful Commets, thaeatning Wars, and Desolation, which afterward Ensued by the falling out of Petty Princes; he Reigned 23 years, and was succeeded by Ethelbert, Anno 750, who held the Throne 11 years, and gave place to Edrick, who lost his Life after a Reign of 34 years, in a fatal Battle at Otteford, against Offa King of the Mercians; and in his time another General Counsel was held at Nice, and consequently the second General Counsel; and then the Kingdom of Kent was Usurped by Ethelbert the third, who (for that cause) being Wared upon by Kenâ£woolf, he was taken Prisoner, and crrried into Mercia ãâããâã yet he afterward was released, and Reigned 3 years giving, at the end of that time, place to Cuthred, whom Kenwolf, King of the Mercians, Instated in the Thronâ¢â¢ of Kent: Yet his Reign was short, terminating in the\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nspace of three years, and Baldred succeeding him, (after a long dispute with the Mercian King, and 18 years continuance in his Kingdom) was forced to flee, and leave the Possession to the Conqueror; who, about the year 824, made it cease to be any longer a Kingdom, annexing it, (by right of Conquest) to that of Mercia; in which, for the future, we must account it: This Kingdom continued entire 372 years.\n\nThus fell the Kentish Kingdom, thus bereft Of all its Grandure, to the Conqueror left; Its name was swallowed by a greater sway, Ingulf'd, in what we must call Mercia.\n\nAn account of the Kingdom of the South Saxons containing, Sussex and Surry under the Succession of four Kings.\n\nTHis parcel of the British Land fell first to Eâ¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ Captain of the Saxons, who brought supplys out of Germany, at their greatest need, Landing at Shoram in Sâ¢â¢ssex, where he gave barrel to the Britains, and by a great overthrow obliged them to the Woods and Fastnesses, whereupon, sending for more Aid to Aâ¢â¢â£sure him in his Conquest, he took possession of Sussex and Surry, begining his Reign 488. and continued it 32 years. Then giving place to Cossa, who Reigned, as some will have it 72 years; and to him succeeded Ethels Wolfe, who, after 25 years Reign, was slain by Cadewel, a Banished Prince of the West Saxons; yet beâ£fore his death, the Christian Religion was tolerated in his Kingdom, himself being Converted by, (as Bede has it) Bishop Willfride, tho' some allow his Converâ£sion to Berinus Bishop of Dorchester, however, he was held to be a good Prince; nor did Cadewel long rest in quiet, after his death, for Barthun, and Authun, took up Arms against â¢â¢im, and made him fly the Kingdom, but he returning with a great power, overcame the\n\ndescription Page 30\n\ntwo Dukes; and after that, it became a part of the West Saxon Kingdom, when it had continued a Kingâ£dom 133 years.\n\nThus set the second Kingdom, or it's Fame; For from this time, it lost it's ancient Name.\n\nAn account of the West Saxon Kingdom, containing Cornâ£wal, Devonshire, Barkshire, and Hampshire, with the succession of Kings.\n\nTHe first that possessed himself of this Kingdom, was Chardick, a low Country German Captain, who entred Britain about the year of our Lord 495. and Killing Nataulcon, a great Prince of the Britains, in a dreadful Battle, he made himself King of the West Saxons, beginning his Reign in 501, and continued it 33 years; at the end of which, he gave place to Kenâ£rick, who prosecuting the War against the Britains, gave them two great overthrows, at Banbury in Oxfordshire, and Shrewsbury in Wiltshire, whereby they loâ£sing Courage, and hopes of Conquest, left him in quiet possession of what his Father had acquired; but after a Reign of 26 years, he was succeeded by Chewâ£lin, who fought Ethelbert, King of Kent, and defeated his Army at Wimbledon: And this is accounted the first Battle, the Saxons had amongst themselves; he gave likewise a great overthrow to the Britains at Bedâ£fold, and surprized four of their Towns as Liganburgh, Alisbury, Bensington, and Evesham; and about six years after, he fought the Britains at Durham, and slew Coinmagil, Caudigan, and Farmnagil, three of the Briâ£tish Kings; thereupon surprizing Glocester, Bath, and Cirencester; but at length, some Saxons Joyning with the Britains, to Oppose his growing greatness, he was overthrown at Wodensbeoth, and his Son Cuth slain; and thereupon Cearlick, his Nephews, prosecuting the\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nWar against him, bereft him of the Kingdom, after â¢â¦â¢â¦e had Reigned 33 years; yet the Nephew held it but â¢â¦â¢â¦x years, before he gave place to Chelwoolf. This â¢â¦â¢â¦rince held the Scepter of the West Saxons Kingdom 14 â¢â¦â¢â¦ears, but being assaulted by the Britains, in confedraâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦y with the Scots and Picts, after much trouble and â¢â¦â¢â¦ile, he dyed in the Wars; so that his Kingdom fell â¢â¦â¢â¦ Kingil, who gave the Britains Battle at Beandune, â¢â¦â¢â¦nd killed 1046 of them; and the better to strengthen â¢â¦â¢â¦imself, he made peace with Penda, King of the Marâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ans, and was converted to the Christian Faith, by â¢â¦â¢â¦erinus, to whom he gave Dorchester, as a seat. This King Reigned 31 years over the West Saxons. and â¢â¦â¢â¦hen gave place to Redwald, who was Baptized, and Reigned 13 years; after him Eskwin began his Reign, â¢â¦â¢â¦75. and continued it but two years, being overcome â¢â¦â¢â¦t that time by Wolfere, King of the Mercians, at Buâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦amhford, and most of his people slain, and was succeeâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ed in the Kingdom of the West Saxons by Kentwin, who was a greater Persecutor of the poor remnant of â¢â¦â¢â¦he Britains, making them fly into the Rocks and Mountains for shelter and security; but his Reign â¢â¦â¢â¦asted not long, for at the end of 9 years he dyed, and gave place to Cadewalde, who slew Ethelwoolf, King of â¢â¦â¢â¦he South Saxons, and afterward usurped his Kingdom; and being a Heathen, he destroyed many of the Chriâ£stians, especially the Clergy; but in the end, he was succeeded by Ine, who began his Reign, Anno 688. â¢â¦â¢â¦he brought the South Saxon Kingdom into a province, and had Wars with the Britains and Mercians, and made many wholsom Laws; upon which, many now â¢â¦â¢â¦n force, are founded; he built the Abby of Glassenbury, and went a Pilgrimage to Rome, and there dyed. This was he that gave the Pope the first Peter-pence from England, to be payed on Lammus day; his Reign conâ£tinued 37 years, and was succeeded by Ethellred, in whose Reign, two dreadful Blazing-Stars appeared; his Reign continued 14 years, and then he gave place to Cuthred, Anno 740. this King made Peace with the\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nMercians, and Joyning his Force; with them, the cruelly opressed the Britains, but Adelem, an Eaâ¢â¦â¢â¦ and one of his Subjects, Rebelling against him, hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ was obliged to give it over, to Defend his Trritories but having Reigned 14 years, he was succeeded bâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Sigesâ¢â¢â¢â¢rt. This King caused Cumbra, an Earl of hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Counsel, to be slain for reproving his Vices, whicâ¢â¦â¢â¦ occasioned his Subjects to Rebel, and forced him tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ shelter himself in a Wood, where he was found, anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ slain by the Earls Swinheard, when he had Reigned aâ£bout a year; to whom Kenwoolf succeeded, who Waâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£ed very furiously on the Britains, and gave them greâ¢â¦â¢â¦ overthrows; but in the end, himself was overthrowâ¢â¦â¢â¦ by Offa, King of the Mercians, and there slain, â¢â¦â¢â¦ Captain Ciyto, but his Subjects recovered hiâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Body and revenged his death upon the Captain, and Eighty of his followers. The King thus dead, Brithrick stepâ£ed into the Throne, in whose time divers strange proâ£degies, and Phantoms appeared, as well in the Air, aâ¢â¦â¢â¦ on the Earth; and when he had Reigned without any considerable Action, fell by Poyson, which he took in in a confection, the Queen had prepared for one of hiâ¢â¦â¢â¦ paramours; whereupon he fled into France, and therâ¢â¦â¢â¦ died Miserably, and now this Kingdom began to draw to a Period, or rather to loose it's name, to be joyned with the rest, in a sole Monarchy; for Egbert succeeded Brithrick, Anno 806. as King of the West Saxons, he (after a long War, wherein much blood was spilt) gained an absolute rule over the Seven Kingdoms, makâ£ing a strict Law against the Welch, that should dare to venture over Offas Ditch, which he appointed for their Boundard, he slew Bernulph, King of the Mercians in Battle, and drove the King of Kent out of his Kingâ£dom, and to his Conquering Arms the East Angles, and East Saxons, likewise submitted, so that finding none oppose him, he caused himself to be Crowned the first sole Saxon Monarch at Winchester, and gave the Counâ£try the name of England; and the Danes, (with 33 Ship) Landing in the 14 of his Reign, he gave them\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nâ¢â¢attle, but was Obliged to retire with loss; and the â¢â¢ext year (being invited by the Britains) they Landed â¢â¦â¢â¦ Wales, against whom he Wared, and was Victorious.

And now these petty Kingâ£doms growing to a period, Etheâ¢â¦â¢â¦bert began his Reignâ¢â¦â¢â¦ but having displeased the bloody Quindride, Wife tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Offa King of the Mercians, she prevailed with heâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Husband to send for him, under pretence of givinâ¢â¦â¢â¦ him one of his Daughters in Marriage; but having got him in her power, she caused him to be put tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ death, when he had reigned Forty five years, anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ was succeeded by Edmund, in whose time the Danes camâ¢â¦â¢â¦ over in great numbers, burning and destroying before them; insomuch, that the King was obliged to shuâ¢â¦â¢â¦ himself up in Framingham Castle, and after a lonâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Seige surrendred it: But the Pagan Danes, not regardâ£ing their Faith, having stripped the poor King, finâ¢â¦â¢â¦ beat him with Câ¢â¢dgels, then scourged him, and afteâ¢â¦â¢â¦ that, tying him to a Stake, shot him to death with Arrows, whilst with much Patience and Devotion he suffered the usage, calling upon the name of Jesuâ¢â¦â¢â¦ and recommending his Soul to his Redeemer; thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ years of his Reign are doubtfully mention'd, howâ£ever he began to Reign over the East. Angles, Anâ¢â¦â¢â¦ 794; he was afterwards cannonized a Saint, and thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Town of St. Edmunds-bury still remains in rememâ£brance of him.\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nThus you the Saxon Hepterchie may view, How first it rise, and to a period drew, To rise more glorious in what does eusâ¢â¢e.\n\nThe Saxon Government, under sole Monarchs, with the Succession if Kings, their Reigns and Actions.\n\nTHe Hepterchie of the Saxons appearing very trouâ£blesome in their continual Wars amongst themâ£selves, and those of the Danes and British Princes, who still held out, the chief of the last that â¢â¦â¢â¦pposed them, during their petty Kingdoms, were â¢â¦â¢â¦ortimer, Son of Vortinger, who reigned Four years; Aurelius Ambrosius, who reigned Thirty two years; â¢â¦â¢â¦ter Pendragon his Brother, who reigned Eighteen â¢â¦â¢â¦ears; Arthure, of whom the Monks, have created so â¢â¦â¢â¦any Fables, that the truth of his Actions are doubtâ£ful, who reigned Twenty six years; Constantine, Son â¢â¦â¢â¦f Cador, Duke of Cornwal, and Cousin to Arthur, who â¢â¦â¢â¦eigned Three years; Aurelius Conatus, who reigned Thirty three years; Vortiporus, who reigned Three â¢â¦â¢â¦ears; Malgo Cononus, who reigned Five years; Careâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦cus, who reigned Three years; Cadwan, who reigned Twenty two years; Gadwallo his Son, who reigned forty eight years, and Cadwallader, who reigned â¢â¦â¢â¦leven years: These were the Chief, of the British Princes, who opposed the Saxons, and held â¢â¦â¢â¦eir Kingdom for the most part, in Wales and the Marches, giving them, at sundry times, many notable â¢â¦â¢â¦verthrows, disputing their Country with the Invaâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ers, till their Power was wasted, and the remainder of â¢â¦â¢â¦heir People compelled to betake themselves to the Mountains and Fastnesses. Egberts's Fortune prevailâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ng he united the seven Kingdoms into one, and beâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ame the first sole Saxon Monarch, causing himself to â¢â¦â¢â¦e crowned at Winchesier, giving the whole Country\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nthe Name of England, and the People the Epethitâ¢â¦â¢â¦ of English. In the Fourteen year of his Reign, thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Danes with thirty three Ships landed in England, tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ whom he gave battle with such Forces, as on the sudâ£den could be raised, but was worsted, loosing two Dukes, two Bishops, and most of the Common Solâ£diers, he hardly escaping the Field, yet afterwards thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Danes were driven to their Country; but not so much discouraged, as to hinder their landing in Wales thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ next year, and there they joyned the poor remaindeâ¢â¦â¢â¦ of the Britains: But the King being aware, had more time to draw his Forces together, when giving then battle, he overthrew both parties; yet not long after thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Danes sacked the Isle of Shippy, and were not with out much slaughter expelled.\n\nThis was the Seventeenth King of the West Saxonâ¢â¦â¢â¦ and First sole Monarch of England, beginning hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Reign as Monarch 819, and reigned Seventeen yearâ¢â¦â¢â¦ much improving and increasing the welfare of thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Kingdom.\n\nEthelwolf the Second sole Monarch, eldest Son â¢â¦â¢â¦ Egbert, began his Reign, Anno 837, and was in hâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Fathers time Bishop of Winchester: But being in â¢â¦â¢â¦ manner constrained to take upon him the Governâ£ment, he resigned his Bishoprick to Swithâ¢â¦â¢â¦n his Tutâ¢â¦â¢â¦ and gave a great overthrow to the Danes at Oclâ¢â¦â¢â¦ freeing the Church Lands from all Tribâ¢â¦â¢â¦tes and Râ¢â¦â¢â¦â£gal Services; and going to Rome, at the Bishop's peâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£swasion, he confirmed Peter-pence, and setled a yeaâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£ly Pension of Three hundred Marks upon the Râ¢â¦â¢â¦ man See, and continued his Reign about Twenâ¢â¦â¢â¦ years.\n\nEthelbald succeeded Ethelwolf, being his eldest Sâ¢â¦â¢â¦ by his Wife Osburge, who was his Butlers Daughteâ¢â¦â¢â¦â¢â¦â¢â¦ his Valiant Actions sufficiently appeared against tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Danes in his Fathers Reign; but that which bloted â¢â¦â¢â¦ great Actions was his Marrying Judith, Danghter â¢â¦â¢â¦ the French King, and his Mother-in-law: But â¢â¦â¢â¦ reigned only two years, and was the Third sole Mâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£narch of the English Men.\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nEthelbert, the second Son to Ethelwofe, succeeded â¢â¦â¢â¦is Brother, Anno 860, he was continually alarumed â¢â¦â¢â¦y the Danes, who finding the pleasantness of the â¢â¦â¢â¦ingdom, compared with their Rocky Land, came in warms, sometimes landing in one place, and someâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦mes in another, and destroyed Wâ¢â¦â¢â¦nchester; but the â¢â¦â¢â¦ople gathering in great numbers, and falling upon â¢â¦â¢â¦em before they could recover their Ships, most of â¢â¦â¢â¦em were slain: He reigned Five years, and then â¢â¦â¢â¦ave place to\n\nEthelred, in whose Reign the Danes and Norwigâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ans got more and more footing, and being Pagans, â¢â¦â¢â¦ed all manner of Rapin and Violence, deslowring Virgins, and ravishing Women, not sparing the Veiled Nun, but destroyed the Abbies and Monaâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦eries; so that to save their Chastity, by the advice â¢â¦â¢â¦f their Abbess, the Nuns of Codingham Monastery â¢â¦â¢â¦ut off their Noses and upper Lips, to render themâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦elves deformed, and that the frightful spectacle might â¢â¦â¢â¦ay the Lusts of the inslamed Danes; but it prevailed â¢â¦â¢â¦ot, for the Monsters having first deflowred them, â¢â¦â¢â¦ut them to the Sword, and set the House on fire, â¢â¦â¢â¦nd so proceeded under the leading of Hungar and Hubâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦a, their Commanders in chief, to burn the City of â¢â¦â¢â¦ork, committing extraordinary Outrages and Vioâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦ences: But Ethelred at length gave them a great overâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦hrow slaying one of their Dukes, or petty Kings, with nine Earls, and a great many common Soldiers: â¢â¦â¢â¦ut about eighteen days after, being recruited with â¢â¦â¢â¦sh Forces, they put the King to slight at Basing, â¢â¦â¢â¦nd about two Months after wounded, and overthrew â¢â¦â¢â¦im at Merton, of which wound he dyed, when he had â¢â¦â¢â¦eigned about Six years; and was succeeded by\n\nElfride, fourth Son to Ethelwolf, who fought seven Battles with various success against the Danes; for in â¢â¦â¢â¦is time they sorely oppressed the Land, insomuch â¢â¦â¢â¦hat the High-ways were unfrequented, and the Ground â¢â¦â¢â¦n most places Untilled, and the King himself obliged â¢â¦â¢â¦o flee into Woods, and Desart places, but in the end,\n\ndescription Page 46\n\nweary of that solitude, he put himself in the Habâ¢â¦â¢â¦ of a Musician, under which disguise he discovered tâ¢â¦â¢â¦ sluggish security of the Danes in their Camp, wheâ¢â¦â¢â¦ upon secretly rallying his scattered People, he suâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£prised them in that manner, killing a great number â¢â¦â¢â¦ them, and taking their Standard: And more Daâ¢â¦â¢â¦ attempting to land in Devonshire under Halden thâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Captain, the people rise generally in Arms, and falliâ¢â¦â¢â¦ upon them near Exeter, kill'd the Captain, and 8â¢â¦â¢â¦ of his Followers. This King caused all Thieves to banished, and divided the Kingdom into Shires, Hundred and Tythings, he founded the first common Schoâ¢â¦â¢â¦ in Oxford, which is now called University Colledgâ¢â¦â¢â¦ and continued his Reign Twenty nine years.\n\nEdward, the Eldest Son of Elfride succeeded him and began his Reign 901, when soon after he came â¢â¦â¢â¦ the Throne, his Nephew Ethelwald stirred up â¢â¦â¢â¦ Subjects to rebel against him, but they were quietâ¢â¦â¢â¦ without much trouble; yet the Danes were still â¢â¦â¢â¦ possession of one part of the Country, which maâ¢â¦â¢â¦ the King build a strong Castle at Hartford, and marâ¢â¦â¢â¦ against them, when at St. Edmuns Ditch he gave theâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Battle, but prevailed not, however, in that Mortâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Battle two of their Kings, viz. Ethelwald and Crocâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£cus were slain: And soon after he gave them anothâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Battle at Wodesfield with a great overthrow, killiâ¢â¦â¢â¦ two other of their Kings, and two Earls, with aboâ¢â¦â¢â¦ 4000 Common Soldiers: He reigned Twenty foâ¢â¦â¢â¦ years and gave place to\n\nEtheistance, who began his Reign 923; his Subject upon his coming to the Crown, rose in Mutine undeâ¢â¦â¢â¦ Elfrede a Norman, but the Ring-leader taken, and seâ¢â¦â¢â¦ to purge himself, they were quieted; yet he was â¢â¦â¢â¦ jealous of his Brother Edwin, that he consented â¢â¦â¢â¦ his being murthered, which created in him such remorse, that he caused his Murtherers to be put â¢â¦â¢â¦ death, and had like, soon after, to have been slain â¢â¦â¢â¦ his Tent by one Anlafe a Dane, but by a lucky râ¢â¦â¢â¦â£moval he escaped, and a Bishop, who had pitched â¢â¦â¢â¦\n\ndescription Page 47\n\nâ¢â¦â¢â¦ent on the same Ground, was assaulted and slain. â¢â¦â¢â¦fter he had killed many of the Danes with his own â¢â¦â¢â¦nd, as well Nobles as Plebeans, and having â¢â¦â¢â¦yed their fury, he had leisure to pass into Scotland â¢â¦â¢â¦th a powerful. Army, and brought that Kingdom â¢â¦â¢â¦o subjection: But upon his return, he found the â¢â¦â¢â¦nes had strengthened themselves, yet he routed them â¢â¦â¢â¦ar VVinchester, and in this contest, it is reported, Guy â¢â¦â¢â¦rl of VVarwick sought with Colbron, the Danish Giâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦t of mighty seize, and slew him hand to hand, as â¢â¦â¢â¦e Kings Champion in single Combat; and so far read the fame of this King, that Historians report â¢â¦â¢â¦ut with what credit I know not) that Hugh King â¢â¦â¢â¦ France, greatly desirous of his friendship, sent him â¢â¦â¢â¦e Sword of Constantine the Great, which had in its â¢â¦â¢â¦ile one of the Nails that fastened Christ to the Cross; likewise his Spear, which was that with which Loâ¢â¦â¢â¦â£â¢â¦â¢â¦us peirced his side with a piece of the Thorny Crown â¢â¦â¢â¦ wore, that Otho the Emperor sent him a Landskip â¢â¦â¢â¦ with precious Stones, and the King of Norway a â¢â¦â¢â¦ip with guilt Decks, and Purple Sails, he reigned â¢â¦â¢â¦een years, and was the Eldest Son to King Edâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦d.\n\nEdmund the fifth Son of King Edward, succeeded his â¢â¦â¢â¦other Anno 940. he fought sundry Battels with variâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦s success against the Danes, and his Son Dunmail reâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦lling against him, he caused his Eyes to be put out; â¢â¦â¢â¦ was Crowned at Kingstone upon Thames, his picture â¢â¦â¢â¦ memory of it being still preserved in the Church â¢â¦â¢â¦ith many otherâ¢â¦â¢â¦, his Successors he made many wholâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦m Laws, but interposing, as some Authors have it, â¢â¦â¢â¦tween two Deuelists, he was unfortunately run â¢â¦â¢â¦rough after he had reigned six years.\n\nEdred succeeding Edmund Anno 946. the Danes beâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦n to gather courage not without being privately aâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦mated by some treacherous English, and amongst â¢â¦â¢â¦em Weelstan Arch-Bishop of York; so that â¢â¦â¢â¦ the â¢â¦â¢â¦ caused himself to be Crowned King of Northumâ£â¢â¦â¢â¦rland, against whom Edred marched with a great\n\ndescription Page 48\n\nArmy, but had the Rear of it surprised by the underhand dealing of Woelstan; however, he made his party good, put the Danes to the rout, and returned with victory. He made St. Germans in Cornwal a Biâ£shops See, which was by Canute the Dane translated to Credington, and at last setled at Exeter by Edmund the Confessor, where â¢â¢it at present remains. This Edred was Tenth sole Monarch of England, and reignâ£ed Nine years.\n\nEdwy succeeded Edred, Anno 955, and was crownâ£ed at Kingston upon Thames, where it is repoted he committed Adultery with a great Lady, his near Kinsâ£woman, in the sight of his Nobles, and afterwards caused her Husband to be slain, that he might more freely enjoy her: He thrust out the Monks, and put married Priests in the places of those that affected a single Life; Banished Dunstan, who is now stiled a Saint, and the same that is reported to have taken a shee Devil by the Nose, with a pair of Tongues, for disturbing him at his Forge. These things turned the Peoples Affections against the King, to a degree of layâ£ing him aside, and swearing Fealty to Edgar, which made him pine to death, after he had Rul'd Four years, and was buried in the New Abby Church at Winchester.\n\nEdgar began his Reign, Anno 159, he recalled Dunâ£stan, and outed the married Priests, making a Penalty against Drunkenness; and the Land at that time beâ£ing pestered with Wolves, he laid a yearly Tribute of three hundred Wolves Heads upon the Prince of Wales, and upon the Noble-men and Free-holders, acâ£cording to the largeness of their Possessions, so that in a few years they were all destroyed: He made it his business once a year, to ride the Circuit of his Kingâ£dom, to inquire of Abuses done by his Judges in Ilâ£legal Actings, or those that were done by private Persons one to another, inflicting severe punishments on such as he found tardy; yet he have himself up to prodigeous Lust, insomuch, that casting his Eyes\n\ndescription Page 49\n\nupon any Women he liked, he would have his satisâ£faction by fair means or force; and killed Ethelwald an Earl, and one of his principal Courtiers with a Spear, as he was hunting in the Forest, because he had marriâ£ed a beauteous Lady, Daughter to Duke Orgarus, when he had sent him to fetch her for his own use, and then took her to Wife: He deflowred a Nun, called Wolfeâ£child, and got on her a hopeful Brat, which was afterâ£wards Sainted by the name of Edith; and afterwards another Nun, called Ethelflede, on whom he begot his Son Edward, who succeeded him; he had peace, except a little bickering with the Welsh, all his Reign, feared a broad and at home, having the greatest Navy of any King before him, some Authors reporting it consisted of Three thousand Ships: He was crown'd at Kingâ£ston upon Thames by Otho, Archbishop of Canterbury, and reigned sixteen years.\n\nEdward, the Thirteenth sole Monarch of England, began his Reign, Anno 975, and was usher'd in by a Famine and a Blazing Star, with great contentions beâ£tween the Monks and Married Priests: Dunstan taking taking part with the former, and Duke Alfarus with the latter, and meeting to Dispute in an upper Room, the press being great, the Flour fell down, and many were wounded, only Dunstan's Chair stood fixed upon a Post, which gave such credit to the Monks, who without doubt had contrived the sinking of the Four, as apâ£peared by the Chair, being fixed, that they gained the point, and the Married Priests were turned out, suffering great necessity, no Man daring to entertain or relieve them: Soon after this, the King going a Hunting, and being near the Castle of Queen Elfreda, his Motherâ£in-Law, he separated from his Company, and went to pay her, and her Son, a visit: But the treacherous Queen to advance her own, caused one of her Serâ£vants to stab him in the Back, whilst he was drinking on Horseback at her Gate; whereupon turning his Horse he fled the farther Treachery, but not finding his retinue, he through lossâ¢â¢ of blood fainted, and falâ£ling\n\ndescription Page 50\n\nin the next Wood, expired when he had reigned four Years.\n\nEthelred the Son of Edgar, and Elfreda succeeded Edward, who for his slowness in Affairs, was Nick-naâ£med, The Unready; he was Crowned at Kingstone upon Thames, the ordinary Seat of the Saxon Monarchs, and upon his Coronation day a Cloud was seen throughout England, half resembling Blood, and half Fire; and in the third year of his Reign, the Danes Landed in divers parts of this Kingdom, committing great Outâ£rages, and much about the same time, a great part of London was laid in Ashes. The King not being able to oppose the Torrent of the Danish power, compoundâ£ed a Peace for 10000 Pounds a Year; but finding their Advantage, they soon raised it to 40000 l which ãâããâã heavy upon the Nation, and was called Danes Guilt, oâ¢â¢ Danes Money, nor did this suffice them, but they pillaâ£ged, and ravag'd the Country so extreamly, that the King to free his Sublects from the Oppressions they groaned under, gave them private notice on St. Brices day to fall upon the Danes in all the Cities and Towns where they quartered, which was done with so much secresie, that most of them were cut off, this being done on the 13 of November, Anno 1002. the News flew into Denmark, whereupon new swarms came over, under the Leading of Swanus, who destroyed all before them with Fire and Sword, in such a terrible manner, that the People fled to the Woods, and Mountains, and although the King bought his Peace at the price of 30000 Pounds, yet not long after they flew 900 Monks and such as were of Religious Orders in Canterbury, and having gotten a great sum of Money from the Archâ£bishop Aphegus for his Ransom, they notwithstanding stonâ¢â¢d him at Greenwich, so that the King perceiving their treachery, and cruel dealing, and that he was no ways capable of opposing their fury, he sent Emma his wise with her two Sons, to her Brother Richard Duke of â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢mandy, and soon after left the Kingdom to follow them, but Swanus being stabbed by his own Meâ¢â¢, and\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nCanutus his Son set up in his stead. Ethelred returned, but finding many Treasonable Designs carried on aâ£gainst him by Edricus one of his Dukes, and a powerâ£ful Enemy in the Land which he was no ways able to oppose, he died for grief when he had Reigned thirty seven years, and was the fourteenth sole Monarch of England.\n\nEdmund the Eldest Son of Ethelred Sirnamed Ironside, succeeded him Anno 1016. and was Crowned at Kingâ£stone upon Thames, by Livingus Arch-bishop of Canâ£terbury, though Canute then Reigned as King at Southâ£ampton. This Edmund gave the Danes many Battels, and being of a hardy and couragious temper, he greatâ£â¢â¢y raised the drooping hearts of his Subjects, raising the Siege of London, and worsting their Army four times in open fight, so that Canute having Challenged him to a single Duel, for the Kingdom he loyfully accepted the offer, so that going into an Island called Alney near Glocester, they fought valiantly, but Canute findâ£ing himself over matched, and having received some dangerous Wounds, he desired a Parly, which being granted, he said, What should move us, most Valiant Prince, that for the obtaining of a Title we should thus indanger our Lives, better it were to lay Malice and Weaâ£pons aside, and to condescend to a Loving Agreement: Let us now therefore become sworn Brothers, and divide the Kingdom between us, in such League of Amity, that each may use the other as his own, so shall the Land be peaceably governed, and we joyfully assist each other in necessity.\n\nUpon these words, they threw down their Arms, and embraced as Friends in the fight of both Armys, so that the Kingdom being divided, Edmund had the South, and Canute the North; but in a while after, Edrick the Treacherous Duke, who had betrayed the Councels of Edmund, thinking to ingratiate himself with the Danes, run a Spear into the Body of the King as he was easing himself, and having by that means killed him, he cut off his Head, and hastening with iâ¢â¢ to Canute, he cryed, Hallsole Monarch of England, beâ£hold\n\ndescription Page 52\n\nthe Head of thy Copartner; upon which Canute proâ£mised to advance him above all the Nobles of England, but whilst the Traytor was big with expectation of hoâ£nour and preferment he caused him to be Arrested, and cutting off his Head fixed it on the Tower, advancing him in that sense as he deserved. This Edmund was Third Son of Ethelfrid, and Fifteenth sole Monarch, his Reign exceeded not a year.\n\nThus t"
