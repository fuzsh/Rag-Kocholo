There was Napster, which, as New Year's Day 2000 hit, was already a few months old and only getting bigger. And then, a little over a year and a half later, the iPod emerged, vastly improving the experience of listening to mp3s. For some, these new technologies signaled the end of the long-playing record as we knew it. The single was back! People-- especially kids-- wanted to shuffle and experience one track at a time. The only question for the album, then, was when it would finally breathe its last breath.\n\nIt didn't quite work out that way, though. There was some truth to the predictions, of course-- single tracks do matter a whole lot (we covered 500 of the best of them from the decade here), CD sales are way down compared to 10 years ago-- but the album as a format is still indispensable. As it turns out, allowing artists the freedom to write, record, sequence, and present music in 30- to 60-minute chunks still has value; it's a good structure to organize listening around. And in assembling our list of Top 200 Albums of the Decade, which we're going to be counting down all week, we were reminded of how much vital music was made during this time. We've put together albums lists for the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, and the music we're going to present here stands up to any of these decades.\n\nSo let's get to it: You've read and listened to the tracks, read essays about developments in technology, pop, noise, and indie, watched the videos, heard what the artists thought, and taken in our recap of the big events. Now, concluding our P2K coverage of the 2000s, it's time for the Top 200 Albums. Please note that, in the interest of keeping the list broad, we capped the number of albums for any given artist at three.\n\n200.\n\nJay Reatard: Blood Visions (2006)\n\nA true sleeper phenomenon, Jay Reatard’s breakout record is still creeping up on critics and fans well after its release. Blood Visions is a crossover in the best sense of the term, stealing the raucous energy and attitude of punk, the melodies of power pop, and the rough ingenuity of bedroom recording. Reatard (née Jay Lindsey) uses everything at his disposal to make symphonies of the simplest parts: an impassioned yelp, an acoustic guitar, flying-V riffs, bitter (and occasionally violent) lyrics. All it took was a little bit of actual singing and mixing some melody in with the bile for him to stand up and be counted; but like the album’s cover, he’ll be covered in blood during the counting. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: Jay Reatard: “My Shadow”\n\n199.\n\nDeerhoof: Apple O' (2003)\n\n“The modern-day composer refuses to die.” So said your parents’ very own modern-day composer Frank Zappa (quoting Varèse), and though countless haters will try to convince you otherwise, originality is always possible. Deerhoof are a case in point: the Bay Area quartet makes music that’s punk, but pop; noisy but pretty; thoroughly composed, but explosively performed. Apple O’ caught them at the tipping point between their noisier early days and the comparatively delicate art-pop of all of their records since. Like many of the best bands of the decade (Animal Collective, LCD Soundsystem, the Knife), Deerhoof makes immediately identifiable music with seemingly scores of imitators– yet, nobody else has managed to produce anything quite like “Sealed With a Kiss”, or the Ravel-esque “The Forbidden Fruits”. If musical hybrids fell like low-hanging fruit in the 00s, Apple O’ was a ripe, early masterpiece. –Dominique Leone\n\nListen: Deerhoof: “Panda Panda Panda”\n\n198.\n\nBoris: Akuma No Uta (2005)\n\nListen to any random track from Akuma No Uta, and many influences pop to mind– Earth, Motörhead, Stooges, Blue Öyster Cult, Fushitsusha. But listen to the entire album in one long, rapturous sitting, and it’s hard to imagine it being made by anyone but Boris. Charging, smoke-filled, and raw, it’s the tonal opposite of Nick Drake, whose Bryter Layter album cover is recreated on the front. But just as Drake was devoted to gentle sounds and downbeat moods, Boris are obsessively committed to fuzzy riffs and heavy rhythms, whether deployed in long, shivering drones, or fiery, chugging blasts. The album’s centerpiece, the swaying 12-minute jam “Naki Kyoku”, actually begins in a reflective mood not far from Drake’s melancholia. But, as on the rest of Akuma No Uta, Boris takes that inspiration and burns it away, leaving a trail of smoke rings that clearly spell the band’s name. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Boris: “Naki Kyoku”\n\n197.\n\nYeasayer: All Hour Cymbals (2007)\n\nWith the kind of crackling analog warmth a lot of listeners wish they got from Animal Collective, Yeasayer’s debut record established a demilitarized zone between some formerly opposite impulses: paranoid post-punk yelps and psychedelic, harmonized chants, noodly guitar riffs and ambient keyboard washes, electronic and acoustic instruments working in harmony. The end result is impossible to categorize, which in modern times of rampant pigeonholing might just be one of the best compliments you could give. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Yeasayer: “Sunrise”\n\n196.\n\nWilliam Basinski: The Disintegration Loops I-IV (2003)\n\nThe four-volume set The Disintegration Loops, came with an unusually compelling backstory: veteran multimedia artist William Baskinski, attempting to digitize tape loops he’d made years ago, found the magnetic material in an advanced state of decay, which caused bits of music to disappear with each pass over the tape heads. So the sounds, hypnotic and magnificently textured in their own right, were literally falling apart and vanishing into the air as the pieces progressed, resulting in music that feels heavy with sadness and loss even as it feels spectral and weightless. Adding another layer of poignancy, the distressed tapes were transferred to digital around the time of September 11, and the Brooklyn-based Baskinski created a DVD version of the project, setting the crumbling music to a static video he shot of smoldering Lower Manhattan, an image also used for the CD covers. Born of an unlikely convergence of time, place, and circumstance, The Disintegration Loops has lost none of its overwhelming beauty in the intervening years. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: William Baskinski: “Dlp 1.1”\n\n195.\n\nBonnie “Prince” Billy: The Letting Go (2006)\n\nThe solemn strings that open “Love Comes to Me”– the first track on The Letting Go– indirectly echo the sumptuous opening of Schubert’s String Quintet in C Major, one of the most ethereal pieces of music ever written. Arranged by Nico Muhly, who is quickly becoming indie rock’s unofficial house composer, they signal the album’s feeling of grave finality, implied by the title and reinforced everywhere on the album, from the contented sigh of Will Oldham’s singing to the far-away backing vocals of Dawn McCarthy, who drifts in and out of the album seemingly at her own will. Drained of tension, suffused with wisdom and bottomless sadness, and graced by weary resignation, The Letting Go feels like the calm certainty of someone who has glimpsed the beyond. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Bonnie “Prince” Billy: “Love Comes to Me”\n\n194.\n\nPulp: We Love Life (2001)\n\nAfter an awkward stage that lasted more than a decade, Pulp emerged in the 1990s as the oversexed life of the party. By the end of the decade, they were on the hellish taxi ride home. We Love Life picked up where This Is Hardcore left off, shaking off the hangover to face whatever comes next. Jarvis Cocker squints against the sunlight, going figuratively back underground on “Weeds” and literally underground to a river that flows beneath the city on “Wickerman”. His road to happiness is littered with death, sadness, heartbreak, and confusion, but there’s still room for a joke, and we get Pulp’s best on “Bad Cover Version”. The rest of the group and producer Scott Walker create a sumptuous atmosphere for Cocker’s journey toward a new life. He finally arrives there on the majestic closer, “Sunrise”, a rousing farewell for one of the most original bands of the last 30 years. –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Pulp: “Bad Cover Version”\n\n193.\n\nDevendra Banhart: Rejoicing in the Hands (2004)\n\nIf New Weird America had actually existed, “This Is the Way” would have been its national anthem. The credo opens Devendra Banhart’s first proper and only essential album and immediately delivers attitude and confidence, declaring Banhart’s prerogatives as an individual (beards, sharing, nostalgia, nature) and his aspirations for overcoming the mundane and mute. Sure, Banhart picks his tinny guitar gingerly and offers his plain words politely, but he’s just a shepherd delivering a proclamation wrapped in sheep’s clothing: “We’ve known/ We’ve had a choice/ We chose rejoice,” he closes, rejecting everything but the brambly, uncertain path ahead. The songs that follow are guileless and spirited, as equally dependent on wry winks (“This Beard Is for Siobhan”) as uncloaked sentiments (“Autumn’s Child”). Michael Gira’s spartan production and strong editing distill the power of Banhart’s vibrato and vision while giving the songs the space such oddball beauties deserve. Simple and elegant, Rejoicing remains the jewel of the nebulous moment it led. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Devendra Banhart: “This Is the Way”\n\n192.\n\nArt Brut: Bang Bang Rock & Roll (2005)\n\nThe world won’t listen. Four years after Art Brut (went for) broke, way too many bands are still doing it wrong. Turning their blandness up to 11 and hoping they’ll blend in enough to be anthemic. Expertly borrowing the styles of their heroes– whether that’s the Velvet Underground, Gang of Four, or, hell, the Shaggs– but sorely lacking the spirit. What spirit? Any spirit. Or playing it cool behind the microphone, as if on the off chance someone might hallucinate they have charisma. Like The Modern Lovers for a generation weaned on The Blue Album, Art Brut’s hugely fun debut projected frontman Eddie Argos’s Pulp-like wit onto ironically serious songs about art, girls, and endearingly personal neuroses– I still don’t get all the Italian references. For those about to form a band, they salute you. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Art Brut: “Formed a Band”\n\n191.\n\nAir: Talkie Walkie (2004)\n\nSometimes it pays to know who you are: Air have mined their little vein of electronic music so fastidiously over the last decade that they’re now the de facto gold standard of new-age Gallic pop. Despite that standing, their carefully manicured and occasionally over-polite music tends to be respected by critics rather than revered. This might explain why Talkie Walkie slipped by relatively unheralded; with its baroque arrangements, shivery arpeggios, hushed vocals, and meticulous attention to other micro-sized details, Talkie Walkie remains a quiet masterpiece. Like Beck’s Sea Change, another occasionally maligned Nigel Godrich production, this is an acquired taste that impresses in slow drips rather than showy bursts. As opening trifectas go, though, they don’t come much lovelier than “Venus”, “Cherry Blossom Girl”, and “Run”. –Mark Pytlik\n\nListen: Air: “Venus”\n\n190.\n\nElliott Smith: Figure 8 (2000)\n\nHaving completed the transition from acoustic bedroom folk to intricately orchestrated Beatlesque pop with 1998’s XO, Elliott Smith took a more understated approach with 2000’s Figure 8. Not quite as intimate as his earliest records and not quite brash and bombastic like its immediate predecessor, Figure 8 marks a subtle refinement of Smith’s songwriting skills. Figure 8 is notable for its confidence and its discipline– neither of which is a particularly flashy trait. But with this surer footing came deeper expeditions into the timeless gestural language of big-C Classic rock, making Figure 8 one of Smith’s most accessible and enjoyable records. –Matt LeMay\n\nListen: Elliott Smith: “Son of Sam”\n\n189.\n\nJamie Lidell: Multiply (2005)\n\nListen to Jamie Lidell’s earlier records– his aptly-titled solo debut Muddlin Gear or his Super_Collider work with Cristian Vogel– and you hear a playful yet restless Jack-of-all-trades trying to find his voice. Fast forward to 2005’s Multiply, and he’s found it: As Mark Pytlik notes in his Pitchfork write-up of the album, Multiply is most definitely reverential to its antecedents, and they’re often worn proudly on the sleeve of each track. Whenever Lidell makes a not-so-subtle gesture towards his R&B forefathers, he does so with a healthy amount of polite disrespect– Multiply is seasoned with enough electronic chicanery seamlessly integrated into the mix to remind folks that the record was in fact sharing discography space with equally individual talents like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. And whether he’s vamping and squiggling like a young eager-to-impress Prince on “When I Come Back Around” or crooning like a heartbroken old soul on the album’s show-stopping closer “Game For Fools”, there’s no mistaking that Multiply is first and foremost a remarkable statement made by a remarkable artist. –David Raposa\n\nListen: Jamie Lidell: “When I Come Back Around”\n\n188.\n\nM83: Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts (2003)\n\nBefore he would construct dream-pop anthems out of John Hughes’ celluloid teen angst, Anthony Gonzalez (and then-bandmate Nicolas Fromageau) gave us this behemoth of sound. Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts is the biggest M83 record, leaving listeners– those poor flattened souls– pancaked in its wake. But for all of that weight, the distorted guitar-and-synth walls of run-to-your-grave epics “America” and “0078h” (which always seemed to me just as post-rock as they were shoegaze), there was real warmth to the album. The slower-paced, ethereal qualities of “In Church” and “On a White Lake, Near a Green Mountain” hinted at the romance of future M83 tracks. –Joe Colly\n\nListen: M83: “Gone”\n\n187.\n\nStars of the Lid: The Tired Sounds of... (2001)\n\nOn The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid, Adam Wiltzie and Brian McBride create a deep pool of drone so heavy that its gravity pulls in sounds around it, swallowing them whole. The band was having a bit of a laugh at its own expense with the self-deprecating album title– this was their seventh record of impossibly thick, slow ambience, and here they expanded their palette of timbres and stretched out over two full CDs to let each piece breathe as deeply as possible. Intense patience is a hallmark of any great drone music; Wiltzie and McBride have patience in spades and bring a designer’s detailed touch to every sound they make to craft an ambient opus that’s as welcoming as it is esoteric. –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Stars of the Lid: Requiem for Dying Mothers Pt.1\n\n186.\n\nThe Thermals: The Body, the Blood, the Machine (2006)\n\nThe Thermals’ third full-length is a cautionary tale about the dangers of a totalitarian, theocratic regime, and it could only have sprung from anger and frustration with the George W. Bush administration. The lyrical gravitas of religious iconography and damn-the-man slogans gave the Portland pop-punk band renewed purpose, but it could have been just more hot air if it wasn’t married to such incendiary riffs, sexy, throbbing basslines, and urgent, earnest melodies. Most recent protest music is pedantic and plodding, but with the Thermals’ joyously sloppy delivery and imaginative (and not-so-literal) storytelling, they revitalized the genre for a new generation. –Rebecca Raber\n\nListen: The Thermals: “Here’s Your Future”\n\n185.\n\nScarface: The Fix (2002)\n\nScarface aficionados might question Facemob’s sole New York-focused Def Jam record as a representative of the artist’s best work. But if The Fix proves anything, it’s that Scarface is a world unto himself, the rare rapper whose utter musical weight, gravitas, and gravitational pull is so strong that an entire city’s aesthetic bends in his direction when he deigns to subsume it. What is so unique about The Fix is that, from a macro view, it doesn’t sound anything like a 2002-era corporate New York rap record, despite Kanye West’s perfect soul basslines and Neptunes guest production spots; Scarface’s lyrics are unchanged, the same stories from the South Side of Houston, the same engagement with the same drug game, the same unyielding honesty and unwillingness to sacrifice ideals. –David Drake\n\nListen: Scarface: “On My Block”\n\n184.\n\nVitalic: OK Cowboy (2005)\n\nWhile the electronica push of the late-1990s was considered an epic fail well before 2000, it did accelerate the conversation between rock and electronic music. Over the next decade, the sequencer would become a common sight on rock stages, and a legion of DJs (especially the French) responded in kind by infusing house-music juggernauts with the hyper-distorted wallop of power chords. Daft Punk and Justice reveled in gloriously superficial properties of rock, the Aqua-Net and motivational platitudes. But Vitalic was almost punk, going at his ring-modded synths and acid squelches as if they were his first Sears-catalog guitar. His peers want to inspire you, but sometimes, you worry Vitalic is trying to kill you. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Vitalic: “My Friend Dario”\n\n183.\n\nArctic Monkeys: Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)\n\nThere’s a fine line when it comes to precociousness. Pre-teen geniuses? Adorable. Deeply cynical, shockingly self-aware 19-year-olds? Kind of a downer. Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner is the exception that proves the rule. He cuts the Holden Caulfield figure perfectly, moping around Sheffield and observing the Chav life. The Monkeys initially won freakishly enthusiastic acclaim for their clenched-fist stomp, raucous guitar attack, and sodden attitude on songs like “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor”. But what endures are the weary ballads. “Riot Van” is so elegant and detailed about the perils of the boys in blue it almost insists on soundtracking an Irvine Welsh novel. “When the Sun Goes Down” is scarily well-written– the type of song that sounds a million years old the moment it begins. Even the jaunty “Fake Tales of San Francisco” is drooling bile. Sometimes growing up too fast ain’t so bad. –Sean Fennessey\n\nListen: Arctic Monkeys: “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor”\n\n182.\n\nMax Tundra: Mastered by the Guy at the Exchange (2002)\n\nBen Jacobs had to use words. Crafty and clever as his earlier works were, he had more to say this time, and so he started writing pop songs– intricate and busy songs that balanced on a hair his OCD and his ADHD, but songs that were catchy and wondrous as well. He started to sing (and sister Becky pitched in). He wrote about temp labor, old vinyl, amino acids, and, oh yeah, girls. That was the best bit: Now he could sing about girls and crushes and love. In true British fashion, he brought a modest persona to rainbow-shredding music that charm the heart and overclocks the brain. There’s joy in every byte of his tunes: the joy of gazing at girls, and gazing at light-emitting diodes, and telling the world how glorious they both are. –Chris Dahlen\n\nListen: Max Tundra: “Lysine”\n\n181.\n\nAndrew Bird: Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs (2005)\n\nThe world ends not with a bang or a whimper, but with a party. Between 2001 and 2003, Andrew Bird doused his Bowl of Fire, moved to a farm, and fell through the stylistic looking glass into a weird world entirely his own. The Mysterious Production of Eggs is the greatest statement to leak out of that world onto a record. Sheets upon sheets of plucked and bowed violin are joined by his singular whistle and painterly voice to frame homicidal personal ads, tales of children’s brains measured for defects, and musings on the long odds of biology. It’s thoroughly original, from the gentle lilt of “Sovay” to the tidal rush of “Fake Palindromes”, the eerie murk of “A Nervous Tic Motion of the Head to the Left” and the Ravel-quoting bounce of “Skin Is, My”. When it all caves in, Bird will be there to play amidst the rubble, and you should join him if you can. There will be snacks. –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Andrew Bird: “Fake Palindromes”\n\n180.\n\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds: Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus (2004)\n\nThe script called for Nick Cave to settle into mellow middle age, but the singer clearly would have none of it. Whether it was the departure of longtime potentiator Blixa Bargeld or merely the singer approaching 50, something reignited a fire under Cave and his protean partners the Bad Seeds in the mid-2000s that smolders to this day. But even taking into account the subsequent highs of Grinderman and Dig!!! Lazarus, Dig!!! the epic Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus remains Cave’s top work this decade. After all, it was on this double-disc opus that Cave not only reinvigorated his already vicious and virile fire and brimstone bluster with equal parts gospel and grunge, but nudged a little bit more humor to the fore as well. Indeed, if the highlights of this collection are too numerous to single out, Cave must take particular satisfaction in rhyming “Orpheus” with “orifice” in the most lewd manner possible. –Joshua Klein\n\nListen: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds: “The Lrye of Orpheus”\n\n179.\n\nCamera Obscura: Let’s Get Out of This Country (2006)\n\nWhether by proxy, presentation, or straight-up patronage, Camera Obscura’s lace-collared pop seemed doomed to be eclipsed by Belle and Sebastian comparisons. Though valid, 2006’s Let’s Get Out of This Country captured a band getting out from underneath a hefty legacy the best way any group can: great songs. Front to back, this was the Glaswegian sextet’s finest set yet, full of golden melodies made all the stickier and more durable by Tracyanne Campbell’s new tales of heartache. Showroom strings and wedding organ gave the homerun title track and winners like “Lloyd, I’m Ready to Be Heartbroken” and “Come Back Margaret” a schmaltzy pop in which Campbell couldn’t have sounded more capable of juicing your pleasure center, whether you needed a laugh or a cry. Every flourish was in its right place. –David Bevan\n\nListen: Camera Obscura: “Lloyd, I’m Ready to Be Heartbroken”\n\n178.\n\nLil Wayne: Tha Carter II (2005)\n\nThe first Carter was when Wayne started calling himself the “best rapper alive” straight-faced, but Tha Carter II was when people stopped laughing at that claim. Wayne, once a non-cussing kiddie rapper, had hardened his delivery into an elemental croak, and he’d somehow learned the rare ability to craft punchlines so sticky that they’d bounce around in your head all day. He’d also learned not to show all his cards at once. Instead of just telling us about the gun in his trunk, he let loose with something oblique like this: “Riding by myself, well really not really/ So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie.” And perhaps most importantly, this was his first album not produced by Mannie Fresh, and he had the good sense to replace Fresh’s punchy ADD electro with swampy, primordial thuds that gave his jokes urgency and force. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Lil Wayne: “Fireman”\n\n177.\n\nBroadcast: The Noise Made by People (2000)\n\nTheir first singles ticked off their references– the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the United States of America, Nico. On this debut Broadcast set about the task of forging them into a world. It’s a strange world too, as antique as the Clientele’s and as skewed and chilly as the Knife’s, its wintry spaces filled with echo and chimes and analogue ghosts. But once you start exploring it you’ll find its inhabitants more hospitable than you’d imagined. Singer Trish Keenan can weave spells– the baffling, lingering “Echo’s Answer”– but she can also be tender, beckoning a shy companion on “Come On Let’s Go”, chiding a suspicious lover on “Papercuts”. Broadcast are at home on creaking synths but they can summon a stiff, fogbound groove when needed– like the RZA-esque “Dead the Long Year”. On later releases Broadcast’s confidence and songwriting grew stronger, but they’ve never sounded quite this bewitching or curious. –Tom Ewing\n\nListen: Broadcast: “Come On Let’s Go”\n\n176.\n\nThe Mountain Goats: Tallahassee (2002)\n\nFor a decade, John Darnielle’s jackhammer strum and lamb-to-slaughter bleat sketched short, tape-hissy tales of big, big rabbits, orange balls of hate, dysfunction, violence, isolation, and a Google Maps’ site worth of geography. In 2002, he changed things up a bit, not only booking an actual studio, but carrying a suitcase of favorite tropes to Florida’s panhandle– home to previous bit players, the alpha couple– for an entire album length’s stay. Good short story writers don’t always make good novelists. But Tallahassee is a vivid, fully realized night-sweat of a song cycle in which the breakdown of your average awful marriage (you probably know a few) assumes gothic proportions. “No Children”, everyone’s favorite mutual-self-destruction sing-along, is unquestionably bleak. But the tracklist abounds with less-celebrated scenes of abject terror and despair, from “The House That Dripped Blood”’s husky chords and open throat of a cellar door, to the delicately lit powder kegs of “International Small Arms Traffic Blues”. Schadenfreude (or empathy) rarely sounded this delicious (or depressing). –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: The Mountain Goats: “No Children”\n\n175.\n\nVarious Artists: Total 3\n\nLike most great compilations, this one stands for slightly more than itself. Total 3 felt, from some vantage points, like the moment where Cologne’s Kompakt label announced itself to the wider world. From here on out, its elegantly cloudy take on minimal techno and microhouse– gusty, sparkling ambience yoked to the steady beat of dance music, low on bangers and high on subtleties– would become a big part of the decade. Of course, Total 3 isn’t just on this list as a stand-in; it’s here because it’s terrific all by itself, because it’s a lot of what earned all that attention. Sedate hustles and throbs, dark crawls, colorful funk, the glorious sentimentality of Jürgen Paape’s “So Weit Wie Noch Nie”– this collection can be mesmerizing, and it’s beautifully built around a core aesthetic. Thinking of it merely as the dance style that crossed over– the warm-bath techno that turned the heads of even the techno-skeptical– does it a disservice; it ignores just how well-formed and flexible and satisfying this stuff can be, no matter whose ear it’s catching. –Nitsuh Abebe\n\nListen: Jürgen Paape: “So Weit Wie Noch Nie”\n\n174.\n\nOkkervil River: Black Sheep Boy (2005)\n\nDoomed folkie Tim Hardin plays Virgil for Will Sheff, touring the Okkervil River frontman through a rock’n’roll purgatory of bloodthirsty drifters, damaged women, and drug-frayed anthropomorphic metaphors. Less “Behind the Music” than either of the band’s excellent follow-ups, The Stage Names or The Stand Ins, Black Sheep Boy is a rock picaresque that’s touched with very little of those LP’s bone-deep cynicism. It succeeds not merely by Sheff’s literate wordplay, dynamically angsty melodies, or even his deep knowledge of a rock-historical footnote, but by the way Okkervil River click together as a band more strongly than they had on previous albums. They serve as both the pit orchestra for Sheff’s staged plays and a clever foil for his unhinged performances, like when they nail the stop-start urgency of “For Real” and impart a bittersweet country shuffle to “A Stone”, or when Jonathan Meiburg undercuts the bleak “Black” with a cheerily ascending keyboard melody that lets a beam of hope shine into Sheff’s dark world. The result is one of the best rock biographies of the decade and a concept album that’s all heart. –Stephen M. Deusner\n\nListen: Okkervil River: “Black”\n\n173.\n\nMatthew Herbert: Bodily Functions (2001)\n\nMatthew Herbert’s career has zigzagged between styles and approaches– minimalist house tracks, lounge jazz, politically motivated musique concrète– but Bodily Functions is the one album where all his tendencies come together. Recorded with his then-partner Dani Siciliano, the album continues Around the House’s investigations into intimacy and identity both lyrically and literally, with much of the source material sampled from “bodily functions” like clacking teeth and brushing hair. But the music’s too lush to feel pedantic, thanks in large part to Siciliano’s delivery, which swings between defiance and vulnerability, and to arrangements that lean heavily on jazz piano and brushed drums. On the more uptempo cuts, classic deep house provides the blueprint for skippy, tidy rhythm tracks. That Herbert and Siciliano eventually parted ways, in retrospect, may not be surprising: an almost overwhelming melancholy beats at the album’s heart– a sadness so insurmountable it brings its own kind of peace. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Herbert: “The Audience”\n\n172.\n\nConstantines: Shine a Light (2003)\n\nMusic writers get so swept up in classification, we might think a label like “Fugazi-meets-Springsteen” is more important than relating lyrics like “To hell with the mill sallow chorus/ Lift your body out of exile,” or describing the brittle grooves and airplane-hangar roar behind the hoarse protests and prayers of Constantines singers Bryan Webb and Steven Lambke. The Cons’ fury resists getting summarized or blurbed. So what of Fugazi’s (or, sigh, Springsteen’s) wide wake of influence, even in this decade? The Constantines deserve praise for holding to the romance and promise of earlier rock’n’roll while simultaneously deconstructing it, if only for the sake of discovering something. Whatever equation you want to throw at them, the breadth of expression on Shine a Light stuns: The ground covered between “Nighttime/Anytime (It’s Alright)” to “On to You” includes feral, bruised, proud, frightened, and fully confident songs. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: Constantines: “Young Lions”\n\n171.\n\nThe Go! Team: Thunder, Lightning, Strike (2003)\n\nAt the end of the decade, lo-fi had become a fashionable option, a recording approach made less out of necessity than out of fashion. But there’s a third path, and while making a record on a cassette tape in 2009 may be a stubborn and affected act, there is still allure and aesthetic purpose in giving music a grainy feel in spite of GarageBand. See government exhibit labeled the Go! Team, whose 2004 debut used less than ideal recording conditions to evoke documentary-filmstrip soundtracks, TV cop shows, and girl-group 45s. This nostalgia-fetish genre-quilting was nothing new post-Odelay, but Go! Team mastermind Ian Parton proved himself a basement bandleader with an ear for authenticity that didn’t strangle him creatively– switching mid-song from soft-focus flute-driven instrumental to turntablism breakdowns in “Get It Together” or blending 1960s Motown with 80s Bronx on “Ladyflash”. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: The Go! Team: “The Power Is On”\n\n170.\n\nBright Eyes: Fevers and Mirrors (2000)\n\nBruce Springsteen sounded haunted on Nebraska, where even he found redemption scarce. Counting Crows located Omaha “somewhere in middle America,” a faintly sinister phrase, as if Nebraska’s largest city were an island lost on the plains– isolated, impenetrable, maybe imaginary. Conor Oberst, Omaha’s native son, caught this Nebraska-of-the-mind in amber with Fevers and Mirrors, the pinnacle (and conclusion) of his wrought yet raw early style. It conjures a stark, entrapping world: “This barren land is alive tonight,” Oberst whimpers on “Arienette”, as wolves prowl implacably behind acres of rustling corn. Measurements of time and space accumulate– clocks tick, calendar pages float away, scales tip, the sun reels up and down– and nothing changes. Memories of happiness and presentiments of loss, unearned arrogance and unearned guilt, well-being and addiction, all collide in a stalemate. It’s about helplessness: How a fever takes you violently, and a mirror can only reflect what it sees. It’s about being marooned, somewhere in Middle America, between childhood and adulthood, on the dark island of your mind. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Bright Eyes: “Haligh, Haligh, a Lie, Haligh”\n\n169.\n\nCommon: Like Water for Chocolate (2000)\n\nLike Water for Chocolate isn’t Common’s most classic record (that’s 1994’s Resurrection) but it’s his most fully realized. Much like that record, Like Water is visible evidence of a rapper wrestling with his street background and growing self-awareness, of conservative tendencies and an ambitious need for exploration. Com bravely embraced Jay Dee’s Soulquarian vision for an alternative future, while retaining a distinctly personal sound and identity that situated him outside of his Chicago origins. Com still carried the baggage, both negative and positive, of Chicago’s South Side streets– casual homophobic slurs mar the otherwise-flawless “Dooinit”– but this baggage also charges his raps with the energy that would seep from his voice the closer he came to Gap spokesrapper, his trash-talking (“he fell off ’cause I pushed him”) as believable as his growing personal dimension (“The Light”). It helps that J Dilla wraps Common’s lyrics in the swirling emotional nuance of complex-yet-hooky tracks like “Funky for You”. The end result was a singular record in music history, with a sui generis style both artists would fail to replicate. –David Drake\n\nListen: Common: “The Light”\n\n168.\n\nCalifone: Roots and Crowns (2006)\n\n“Leave your memories/ We’re almost new,” sings Califone’s Tim Rutili on “3 Legged Animals”, a standout track on an album his band of nearly a decade almost didn’t make. Break-ups, cross-country moves, and an attempt to quit put Califone’s future in question, but, as he suggests, they returned refreshed, capping their best set of songs (fine roots) with their most intricate arrangements (resplendent crowns). Here, Califone bend, break, and blend pedestrian sounds (fiddle moans, horn growls, chiming bells, lurking bass), while Rutili splices standard images– raindrops, pills, bones– until they weave into impressionistic webs. Almost new here, Califone– more than any American act since Wilco’s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot– struck a righteous balance between the obtuse and the accessible. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Califone: “3 Legged Animals”\n\n167.\n\nAnnie: Anniemal (2004)\n\nFew genres got a bigger boost from file-sharing in the early years of this decade than danceable European pop music. The spread of mp3s around the world allowed for the creation of a thriving global pop underground teeming with shoulda-been hits by coulda-been stars who previously had few options to find an audience outside of the tight playlists of corporate radio. Annie, an enigmatic Norwegian bombshell with a sweet wispy voice and a taste for slick neo-80s production, was the first of these acts to make it big on the same terms as countless indie bands– well outside the bounds of the mainstream, but beloved by a significant number of fans hungry for the sort of dazzling, witty, and unabashedly hooky pop music that had nearly vanished from American radio. Unsurprisingly, most of the attention on Annie’s debut record, Anniemal, was placed on the singles– the melancholy hyperballad “Heartbeat” and the delightfully coy “Chewing Gum” stand as two of the great almost-hits of the decade– but the entire album is stacked with gems, from Richard X’s effervescent “Me Plus One” to the psychedelic disco meltdown of “Come Together”. –Matthew Perpetua\n\nListen: Annie: “Heartbeat”\n\n166.\n\nJim O’Rourke: Insignificance (2001)\n\nDespite the Swiftian invective of the title, Insignificance marks a lot of milestones in producer/composer Jim O’Rourke’s career. The third of his records named after a Nicolas Roeg flick, Insignificance marked O’Rourke’s move from Chicago, where he had helped shape the experimental jazz and post-rock music scenes, to New York, and to date remains his solo effort most concerned with pop accessibility. O’Rourke even sings bemusedly in his poor-man’s-Bill-Callahan voice about being on the cusp: the subject of opener “All Downhill From Here” is self-evident, and standout “Therefore, I Am” has O’Rourke offering personal re-affirmation, a fresh start, and a heavy-handed fuck-off to an unnamed subject. “Therefore, I Am” is set against the backdrop of a ridiculously repetitive, infectious guitar riff and Ringo-esque drums– a curiosity for the improvisational O’Rourke, but here it smartly comes off as a smirking indictment of rock alchemy– and it glides into a falsetto chorus with echoes of girl-groups or the Beach Boys. O’Rourke carries all it off so elegantly that you’d think he’d address the trivial little matter of pop songcraft a little more often. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: Jim O’Rourke: “Therefore, I Am”\n\n165.\n\nVillalobos: Alcachofa (2003)\n\nThe Chilean-born, Frankfurt-raised DJ/producer Ricardo Villalobos spent a decade quietly earning a cult rep for his nervy, elliptical approach to underground techno before he turned dance music on its ear with his 2003 album debut. While he’s often singled out for his purported minimalism, Alcachofa’s real innovation was to recast chugging, 4/4 rhythms in a mercurial casing more akin to krautrock’s shape-changing forms, with loops inside loops inside loops undulating toward a disappearing horizon. The album contains two bona fide anthems. “Easy Lee” sets a cryptic, vocodered chorus to a sparse, tribally backing that feels like it’s made out of plastic and putty; “Dexter” offsets a relaxed, four-square glide with spindly chord changes that seem never to resolve, ratcheting up the tension with every repetition. Less effusive cuts like “Bahaha Hahi” and “Fool’s Garden (Black Conga)”, meanwhile, throb with a coiled intensity far out of proportion to the modesty of their materials. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Ricardo Villalobos: “Dexter”\n\n164.\n\nLes Savy Fav: Rome (Written Upside Down) EP (2000)\n\nRome, written upside down. The Statue of Liberty, pixelated and fallen. An analogy for the decline of empires? Maybe, but Les Savy Fav’s fall of America isn’t some political attack– it’s a dystopian vision of a world where empires crumble because there’s no one left to sustain them, where humanity is subsumed by its technology. The band tosses and turns in the throes of its afterfuture dreams on a bed of glitched-up, brittle post-punk that still sounds like the future despite a total lack of obviously futuristic audio signifiers. For about 18 perfect minutes, Les Savy Fav bottled post-Millennial dread and served it up cold for a thirsty, anxious audience. –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Les Savy Fav: “In These Woods”\n\n163.\n\nDJ /rupture: Uproot (2008)\n\nWith so much music being released every day, strategic listening and contextualization is an art form, of which Jace Clayton (aka DJ /rupture) is a master. He carries the flame for connoisseurship in an era of dilettantism, rejecting rapid consumption and quantity-over-quality: The best is out there; with patience, we can find it, and weave it into a story that says something penetrating about how it feels to be alive, right now. On the surface, Uproot is simply a potent array of music, mixed in a deep field by someone with exquisitely exotic tastes. More fundamentally, it’s a thesis on the collapse of musical borders– between listener and artist, between regional styles, between genres– that has characterized the Internet age. On a universal thread of drums and bass, Clayton draws out seamless connections between Brooklyn and Afghanistan, dubstep and ragga, hearing and making. Music is revealed, actually not-ruptured, in all its splendid commonality. For Clayton there are, at most, two kinds: Wonderful music, which should be collected, pondered, and put into a dialogue; and non-wonderful music, for which one simply has no time. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: DJ /rupture: “Reef”\n\n162.\n\nWu-Tang Clan: The W (2000)\n\nBy 2000, to put it very lightly, the Wu-Tang Clan had diversified their bonds. RZA’s original plan for the group ended with 1997’s Forever, and by the turn of the millennium, many fans lamented the loss of his hold over the group, which had more or less devolved into a watered-down brand stamped onto a variety of middling stuff. In this context, The W was as surprising as it was pleasing, packing some of the RZA’s best production work, and some of the group’s best music. “Hollow Bones” and “Careful (Click, Click)” are two of the scariest cuts in the Wu-catalog, and few songs this decade can match the ardor of RZA’s breakdown on the stunning Isaac Hayes cop “I Can’t Go to Sleep”. Released a mere 18 days before Bush v. Gore would plague us with eight years of that other W, The W provided a fitting soundtrack for those with a freshly bleak outlook on the future. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Wu-Tang Clan: “I Can’t Go to Sleep”\n\n161.\n\nAir France: No Way Down (2008)\n\nJoel Karlsson and Henrik Markstedt’s music may be fantasy, but there’s also an unusual, deeply felt awareness that pop interacts with the all too real world around us. Electronic music is often associated with indoors, so they brought it outdoors. Gothenburg gets cold, so they partied on the beach whenever possible. Someday, when the Balearic revival has its week on “American Idol”, their full-length debut– actually two EPs, but they work better together– will stand out for its pop melodies, luxuriantly vivid sense of place, and the wistful quality generated by those sampled, young voices– their sadness is kids’ stuff, but that doesn’t make it imaginary. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Air France: “Collapsing at Your Doorstep”\n\n160.\n\nDeerhunter: Cryptograms (2007)\n\nNever mind the lost album sales; the abundance of leaked demos, YouTubed concert footage, and radio-session webcasts at our disposal has ultimately served to take the mystery out of the artist’s evolutionary process– it’s increasingly difficult to be surprised by a band’s new direction when we’ve been riding shotgun the whole time. Back in early 2007, before frontman Bradford Cox’s every move was documented online, Deerhunter used their second album as a canvas on which to chart their aesthetic transformation. Defenders of the album format in an mp3 age often point to the medium’s capacity to take listeners on a journey; on Cryptograms, the journey is the band’s own. The remarkable thing about the record isn’t just that Deerhunter deftly execute strobe-lit psych-punk squall (“Lake Somerset”), acidic disco (“Octet”), and sensitive jangle-pop (“Hazel St.”) with equal conviction, but that they make them all seem like logical points on the same continuum. And those miasmic ambient set pieces aren’t just there as breathers, but rather as emblems of a band that’s being perpetually melted down and reshaped from song to song. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Deerhunter: “Spring Hall Convert”\n\n159.\n\nGirl Talk: Night Ripper (2006)\n\nSince multitasking is now our national pastime, an entity like Girl Talk was an inevitable phenomenon; as our attention spans shrink to the nano-scale, one song at a time just no longer is enough. All we needed was someone to step up and act as filter to the unstoppable torrent of pop music bursting our cognitive dams, saving us the time of listening to 500 songs sequentially and giving us the best parts in an overlapping and interlocking efficiency! But the flood of Internet mashups were unimpeachable evidence that no, not everyone can do this, and along came biomedical engineer Gregg Gillis, the Michael Phelps of cutting-and-pasting, to be our beat-matching hero. Now that Wikipedia has spoiled all the Easter eggs, Night Ripper still sports brilliantly catchy (Big Boi Breeders), bizarrely virtuoso (Juelz Mangum Airplane) and oddly emotional moments (Biggie John) to tide you over as you squeeze a five-course meal into a piece of gum, Willy Wonka-style. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Girl Talk: “Bounce That”\n\n158.\n\nDestroyer: Destroyer’s Rubies (2006)\n\nIn the vivid worlds he creates as Destroyer, Dan Bejar is a cad, a self-conscious socialite, and the bard of a made-up bourgeoisie, and Destroyer’s Rubies is his best-yet work under the moniker. The tics and themes that make his music so undeniably his are all here, as is the shaggy jazz and folk-rock, the coy glam posturing, and the swatches of lives cast in abstruse metaphors. Taken all at once, Rubies is decadent, mapping a haute coutureclass system of well-off hipster intellectuals, idle painters, subcultural demigods, and of course, the beautiful women always just out of reach; Bejar further cuts his observations with tweedy references to Ezra Pound, Tchaikovsky, the Incredible String Band, and Greek mythology. “I was the dominant theme in a number of places,” indeed: Bejar’s self-referentiality reaches its peak here as well– Rubies is the ultimate index of Destroyer mythology, the artist fitting himself into the background of his work. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Destroyer: “European Oils”\n\n157.\n\nLightning Bolt: Wonderful Rainbow (2003)\n\nIf the title of Lightning Bolt’s third LP seems redundant– aren’t all rainbows wonderful?– that’s probably intentional. Because this duo’s pounding, relentless repetition turns superfluity and excess into glorious virtues. Overflowing with Brian Gibson’s airplane-engine bass roar and distorted chants, Brian Chippendale’s punching drums, and a layer of viscous distortion on top, Wonderful Rainbow is an exhausting workout. Its 10 songs loop, cycle, and repeat so rigorously your brain feels a marathon runner’s burn. But each track’s muscular incline eventually delivers a rewarding endorphin high. And, just to make sure their noise mantras came in different colors, Lightning Bolt slipped bits of melody inside almost every machine-like blast. The overall effect is less redundant than generous, making Wonderful Rainbow like a pot of gold at the end of another invigorating sky-ride. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Lightning Bolt: “Dracula Mountain”\n\n156.\n\nBloc Party: Silent Alarm (2005)\n\nWhat a dumb name for this album. Press play and the first sound you hear is a siren-like blare of an open E string announcing with all the subtlety of Funkmaster Flex that SHIT’S ABOUT TO GO DOWN. By the start of 2005, much of the previous year’s optimism and stridency gave way to seriously bummed indifference, but Bloc Party wasn’t havin’ it. Kele Okereke is half Paul Revere, half Bono over fighting-trim tracks that stood out as rhythmically vital and melodically sharp even as it seemed like every new hyped band was getting up for the downstroke. But beyond that, what makes Silent Alarm rise above is the depth of Bloc Party’s passion– the precedents for their high-wire musicianship were easy to spot, but then again, while Gang of Four wouldn’t sniff at “Price of Gas”, their “love” song was “Anthrax”, not “Blue Light” and “So Here We Are”. Future releases would prove this point more obviously, but on Silent Alarm, Bloc Party was a clenched fist looking for another hand to hold. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Bloc Party: “Banquet”\n\n155.\n\nClipse: Lord Willin’ (2002)\n\nIt’s true that the Thornton Brothers took a great leap after them crackers at Jive stopped playing fair. But during their Arista years, Pusha and Malice seemed to be doing just fine. With the Neptunes as their guardian angels, the Virginia duo did more than just talk dope deals. They had fun on the weekends (“When the Last Time”), they stunted on other rappers (“I’m Not You”), and they built an elegiac shrine to their homestate (“Virginia”). The drugs still mattered, though. To this day there are thousands of people who don’t know what “Grindin’” is about, despite the fact that it is one of the most explicitly told songs ever. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo in their prime had that effect. After all their misguided evolutions, it’s hard to describe the Neptunes in their prime. Adventurous but ruthlessly commercial; rap purists that broke every rule; futurists with a healthy sense of nostalgia. Together the two duos made a jarring, indelible sound. Just don’t call it coke rap. –Sean Fennessey\n\nListen: Clipse: “Grindin’”\n\n154.\n\nGhostface: The Pretty Toney Album (2004)\n\nGhostface Killah is the preeminent grown-ass man of contemporary hip-hop. What’s truly amazing about the artistic evolution of Tony Starks is how he’s managed to become a wise, world-weary vet without turning into a bitter old crank, pining futilely for the return of some utterly extinct Golden Age. The crazy-quilt headfuck Supreme Clientele may be most folks’ favorite Ghost record of the decade, but personally I’m more compelled by the lived-in contradictions of The Pretty Toney Album, which gives you Ghost spitting brilliant nonsense about 30 dollar bills and seeing the ocean in “my man’s wave,” but also Dennis Coles stinking up bathrooms and affirming that “my boots hang over the telephone wires on Broad.” Ghost spends most of the record sounding harried– by the cops (“Run”), by an ungrateful boo (“Tooken Back”), even by “the two minute and 37 second clock” (“Beat the Clock”). Like most of us, he finds one of his few forms of solace in music, in Ghost’s case the warm, loving soul and R&B of dusty legends like Esther Phillips and the Delfonics. –Joshua Love\n\nListen: Ghostface Killah: “Run”\n\n153.\n\nJens Lekman: Night Falls Over Kortedala (2007)\n\nFrom those early days when people thought his name was Rocky Dennis, Jens Lekman has cultivated an impression of complete sincerity at the same time he has remained as ultimately unknowable as Sally Shapiro; he’ll murmur sweet nothings too good to check, play at your neighbor’s house, then move to Australia and drop off the face of the internet. But first, Night Falls Over Kortedala. Nominally a withdrawal into Lekman’s most provincial fantasies, Kortedala lets insularity become a Trojan horse for globalization– after all, Gothenburg is a place where national indie-pop heroes argue over tennis about Christina Aguilera remixes. So Lekman’s sweet, unposturing songs about first kisses, sublime haircuts, out-of-office replies, avocado-related mishaps and asthma inhalers travel the Earth, using first-class samples when Lekman can’t fly somewhere himself (not even on the red prop plane from the video). Good advice that won’t get you rich: “The best way to touch your heart is to make an ass of myself.” It feels true, doesn’t it? –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Jens Lekman: “The Opposite of Hallelujah”\n\n152.\n\nCannibal Ox: The Cold Vein (2001)\n\nBefore Vordul and Vast Aire broke through, underground hip-hop maintained a line between scientific abstract battlers and real-talk street-rap practitioners– it was a fine one, but few outside Shaolin made a habit of crossing it. With The Cold Vein, Can Ox overstepped that line, straddled it, erased it: pissy project-housing elevators and corner bodegas became Jack Kirby battlegrounds, mathematics were dismantled and reassembled into bleak statistical proofs (“Life is mean/ And death is the median/ And Purgatory is the mode that we settle in”), pigeons turned phoenix, and the combination of Vast’s sociopath-cadence wordplay and Vordul’s relentless internal rhymes turned their lyrics into razors that could cut you sure as any twitchy stick-up kid could. That they still had the capability for indelible love songs (to women in “The F-Wor”; to hip hop in “A B-Boy’s Alpha”) magnified their humanity; that they spit every syllable over the majestic, rust-covered doom of peak-power El-P reinforced their legend. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Cannibal Ox: “Iron Galaxy”\n\n151.\n\nThe Walkmen: Bows and Arrows (2004)\n\nWhen lead singer Hamilton Leithauser first enters the stage on Bows and Arrows, he is being thrown out of a bar. “You don’t have to say it again, cuz I heard you the first time,” he mutters petulantly– except he croons the line, letting his shit-eating grin seep into the sound until it turns into a sweet nothing. That’s quite a trick, and of all the bratty New York rock bands that broke through in the early 00s, no one walked this razor-thin line separating sensitivity and callowness quite as deftly as the Walkmen. Leithauser, his warm rasp making him come across like a more emotionally unstable young Rod Stewart, lurches from messy confrontations to moments of disarming empathy, and on “The Rat”, he lays himself completely bare, pleading for recognition with an abandon that is still startling, as his normally bleary-eyed bar-rock band explodes into catharsis all around him. There weren’t many portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-fuck-up albums this decade that brimmed with as much wit, regret, and wry honesty. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: The Walkmen: “The Rat”\n\n150.\n\nThe New Pornographers: Twin Cinema (2005)\n\nOn Twin Cinema, Carl Newman and his band of moonlighting luminaries (including Neko Case and Destroyer’s Dan Bejar) build a film-studio lot’s worth of outlandish sets, and seek to discover that special something that keeps us returning to pop music. So “Use It” is a powder-keg of kinetic energy, while “The Bleeding Heart Show” (a song so awesome it made a University of Phoenix commercial seem transcendent) commemorates a missed gig with one of the most towering codas of the decade: Fuck playing for a cause– music is the only cause. Yet for all the great moments here– and it’s one after the other– the geeky majesty of “Sing Me Spanish Techno” stands above the rest. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: The New Pornographers: “Sing Me Spanish Techno”\n\n149.\n\nThe Tough Alliance: A New Chance (2007)\n\nGloriously sunny and unabashedly synthetic, the Swedish duo the Tough Alliance’s second album conveys a shiver of ecstasy concealing a tremor of fear and loneliness. The sonic and emotional largesse of A New Chance still shocks, its endlessly unfolding vistas of heartbreaking optimism feeling touchingly generous– they set themselves up for disappointment so we don’t have to. The duo construct a junkyard of chart-pop’s most ruthless tricks– swooping falsetto harmonies, rickety house percussion, buoyant reggae piano vamps, a swirling mélange of winsome samples– and yet for all this the songs remain as young and unspoilt as a first crush. –Tim Finney\n\nListen: Tough Alliance: “Something Special”\n\n148.\n\nErlend Øye: DJ Kicks (2004)\n\nIn retrospect, it’s sort of hilarious people made a big deal of this album as an indie-dance crossover; the notion that rock listeners might recoil in horror at the thought of– gasp!– a minimal beat underneath a pop track. Now, of course, it’s seems strange if an indie release doesn’t contain some sort of dancefloor bounce. But Erlend Øye’s DJ Kicks was one of the key records that helped eliminate those genre barriers. Though total stylistic confluence may not have been his direct aim, Øye’s gauzy singing of wistful pop classics– “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out”, “Always on My Mind”, “It’s a Fine Day”, etc.– over the day’s top tech-house tracks helped make international beats as palatable as ever. New-jack dance-poppers such as YACHT, Delorean, and the xx each owe him a debt of gratitude, and so do we. –Joe Colly\n\nListen: Erlend Øye: “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out”\n\n147.\n\nT.I.: King (2006)\n\n2003’s Trap Muzik, Tip’s album-length meditation on the thrills and travails of dope-dealing, remains his scrappiest and most emotionally resonant statement. But King is the moment T.I.’s drawly sneer crossed over and turned him into one of the world’s biggest rap stars. And it’s pretty amazing that his grand pop coronation didn’t come at the expense of his antisocial snarl or the bluesy heaviness of his beats. When T.I. drafts an East Coast heavyweight like Just Blaze for two of the album’s greatest tracks (“King Back”, “I’m Talkin’ to You”), it’s not a cynical post-regional stardom grab; it’s just another form of banger for him to tear to pieces. When he softens his approach for a come-on like “Why You Wanna” or a reflective moment like “Goodlife”, he doesn’t compromise his hardness; he just effortlessly taps into a calm, cool Southern-gentleman facet of his persona. But King works best on slow-ride bangers like “Top Back” and “Bankhead” and the almighty “What You Know”, wheelhouse trunk-rattlers from one of the greatest ever to do them. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: T.I.: “What You Know”\n\n146.\n\nMy Morning Jacket: Z (2005)\n\nMy Morning Jacket probably could’ve remade At Dawn over and over again and still ended up with the same font size on festival bills. That classic-rock archetype still holds a lot of weight and if you don’t believe me, well, Kings of Leon had a top 10 single this year. Though My Morning Jacket kickstarted their critical and popular acclaim repping Kentucky, marathon live shows, Flying Vs, and flying hair, what makes them one of the great rock bands of the decade is how their best record turned out to be a stunningly concise, 45-minute, retro-futurist opus helmed by the guy who produced The Bends. Unified as much by Jim James’ inimitable tenor as a sense of play and adventure, Z housed feathery R&B (“Wordless Chorus”, “It Beats 4 U”), Who-bangin’ pocket-epics (“Gideon”), and their typical six-string slow burn (“Dondante”). Their breakout single, “Off the Record”, managed to be the only song outside of the Sincerely Yours label to evoke the chill-out music of Jamaica and France at the same time. Few albums can be more accurately described as a “gift,” than Z—a loved one surprising you with something you didn’t even know you needed, all just because. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: My Morning Jacket: “Wordless Chorus”\n\n145.\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces: Blueberry Boat (2004)\n\nOne weird blind spot when people look back at the British Invasion is the tendency of bands to go off on flights of childlike imagination. The more colorful moments of the Who or the Kinks don’t exactly fit into the punk-filtered narrative of rock history, so they’re often written off as weird artsy indulgences. Fortunately, the Friedberger siblings weren’t so dismissive, and Blueberry Boat is a modernized celebration of those weird, wonderful detours, both matching and updating the gaudy, playful ambitions of a young Pete Townshend or Ray Davies. Much is made of this record’s high-calorie composition– suites that seem like 10 songs in one, Matthew Friedberger’s bottomless toy box of bleepy, bloopy synthesizers, sister Eleanor’s word salad. But it’s the album’s starry-eyed sense of adventure that really thrills and sets it apart from mopey indie rock peers– Rudyard Kipling-influenced tales of travel and wonder communicated with nursery-rhyme vocals and radio-play duets. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Fiery Furnaces: “Blueberry Boat”\n\n144.\n\nAndrew W.K.: I Get Wet (2001)\n\nIt’s as streamlined as anything Kraftwerk ever put to tape, and yet sounds like it’s about to come unhinged at any moment. It’s metal if the fans traded their pentagrams for smiley faces. It’s glam for guys who wear off-the-rack Wranglers from Wal-Mart. It’s a joke where the tongue isn’t so much in cheek as goofily dangling like Gene Simmons’ infamous lingua maxima. It’s a Pied Piper in a stained white T, leading an irony-enfeebled generation to a candy colored land of unfettered joy. It’s a pit full of sweaty bodies so overloaded with good vibes that their smell has gone from sour to sweet. It’s a poet who knows shouting “SHE IS BEAUTIFUL” is more effective than, you know, poetry. It’s hard rock in the form of a bear hug rather than a fist to the face or a grind of the hips. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Andrew W.K.: “Party Hard”\n\n143.\n\nThe Decemberists: Picaresque (2005)\n\nNerdiest indie rock album of the decade? A case could certainly be made: the five-dollar words, the baroque instrumentation, the theater club sleeve art. The frickin’ nine-minute one-act play about an old-timey sailor’s thirst for vengeance. But such is Colin Meloy’s talent that what in lesser hands could easily inspire nothing but wedgies is here successfully raised to the level of weaponry against the perils of machismo. Whether it’s on the playing field (“The Sporting Life”) or in the halls of power (“16 Military Wives”, “The Bagman’s Gambit”), the meek shall inherit the earth– once the strong have fucked themselves over. After Picaresque, the Decemberists made the leap to Capitol Records and kinda sorta grew a pair, exploring harder rock and epic concept albums. But that us-against-the-world magic was lost. The Decemberists were at their best when they were at their wimpiest. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: The Decemberists: “16 Military Wives”\n\n142.\n\nPrimal Scream: XTRMNTR (2000)\n\nOver the course of the 1990s, Primal Scream had rightfully earned a reputation as consummate hedonists. But while the rest of the world was ready to party like it was 1999, the Scottish tech-rockers were soberly bracing themselves for the 2000s– which, through their bleary eyes, were already looking plenty bleak even before 9/11 and Bush/Blair wartime alliances muddied the picture further. Arriving in the first month of 2000, XTRMNTR hit the Brits like one of those red pills in The Matrix, jolting hungover New Year’s revelers awake to face the reality of England’s “military/industrial illusion of democracy,” whose true goal is to “exterminate the underclass.” But if the Scream were calling for all-out class warfare, they didn’t skimp on the heavy artillery: shotgunned funk (“Kill All Hippies”), fuzz-punk splatter (“Accelerator”), militant house workouts (“Swastika Eyes”), and brown-acid jazz (“Blood Money”). Of course, the band’s subsequent, increasingly apolitical albums would show that the Scream’s urban-guerrilla guise was as much a fleeting phase as the acid-house love-in of 1991’s Screamedelica and the Rolling Stones jones of 1994’s Give Up But Don’t Give Out. But, even if XTRMNTR was just a pose, who doesn’t love a man in uniform?– Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Primal Scream: “Kill All Hippies”\n\n141.\n\nNeko Case: Blacklisted (2002)\n\nBy 2002, Neko Case had already emerged as one of the most gifted vocalists on the indie landscape, and with her third solo album, Blacklisted, she established herself as a top-flight songwriter as well. Recorded in Tucson with backing from stalwarts Calexico and Giant Sand’s Howe Gelb, Blacklisted is a jewel of dusky Americana, its every move shadowed by longing and veiled menace. At times the source of this foreboding is clear enough, as on the harrowing “Deep Red Bells”, which is haunted by the specter of the Green River Killer. Elsewhere the danger is more implied, visible only through such cryptic omens as the birds that sound their warnings on “Things That Scare Me” and “Ghost Wiring”. Yet throughout the album Case stands defiant against the encroaching darkness armed with her wit, compassion, and a voice as big and luminous as the western sky. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Neko Case: “I Wish I Was the Moon”\n\n140.\n\nTV on the Radio: Dear Science (2008)\n\nDear Science mostly covers the same ground as TV on the Radio’s first two LPs– soulful art-rock, tasteful atmospheres– and it’s easy to gloss over the stylistic chances they continue to take: upswung disco guitars (“Crying”), ballast-funk (“Red Dress”), scat-raps (“Dancing Choose”). Their sound and presence is so naturally large that they never sound like they’ve bitten off more than they can chew, even when they have (catch that line about “foam-injected Axl Rose,” or the monstrous sentiment of “Family Tree”). This is Dear Science’s greatest achievement: making extraordinary, overbearing rock seem like a natural, human act. Something whose creators travel by subway and not jetpack or spaceship. Even if “DLZ” is exactly the type of thing the true cadets– David Bowie, Thom Yorke, Bono– bump in their shuttles. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: TV on the Radio: “DLZ”\n\n139.\n\nLove Is All: Nine Times That Same Song (2006)\n\nQuick to fall in and out of love, and with a bit of an obsessive streak, the shouty Swedish-pop five-piece both suited and deserved their instant crit slobber. What’s more remarkable is how Nine Times That Same Song has endured and even thrived where so many similarly lauded contemporaries have begun to sound– well, not “fresh and young” anymore. From the cowbell-clattering “one more time” dance-skronk of “Talk Talk Talk Talk” to the smoldering alt-ballad TV confessional of “Trying Too Hard”, Love Is All had the funny, affecting, tellingly detailed songs to render comparisons to Life Without Buildings, X-Ray Spex, or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs all but irrelevant; along with its lo-fi elbow grease, that 10-times-great-songs spirit gives 9 Times common cause with a resurgent Slumberland’s latter-decade roster. Not falling out means never having to make up. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Love Is All: “Talk Talk Talk Talk”\n\n138.\n\nThe Libertines: Up the Bracket (2002)\n\nIt’s hard to remember now, but prior to the trials and (drug) tribulations and tabloid fame, Pete Doherty was once simply an up-and-coming musician. He and Carl Barât, whose flat he would later go to jail for burglarizing, led the Libertines– and before Doherty started taking their band name too literally, they mastered a post-modern collage of early blues riffs, twitchy mod rhythms, pub-rock sing-alongs, and heavily accented crooning that was such an adept Clash homage that Mick Jones himself actually produced their debut. There is such innocence and energy to Up the Bracket that is hard not to be sad when you hear it now. It’s either the sound of unfulfilled promise or lightning in a bottle (depending on whether you’re a glass-half-full or half-empty type of person), but either way, neither Doherty’s Babyshambles nor Barât’s Dirty Pretty Things (nor the Libertines own disappointing follow-up) managed to recreate the raw, ramshackle magic of this album. –Rebecca Raber\n\nListen: The Libertines: “Up the Bracket”\n\n137.\n\nIron & Wine: The Creek Drank the Cradle (2002)\n\nSix decades after Woody Guthrie brandished the acoustic guitar as a weapon, contemporary folk music was left battling a limp reputation (see: sadsacks in coffeehouses trilling covers of “Tom Dooley”, pausing only to sip from a complimentary mug of peppermint tea). But in 2002, when Sub Pop got its paws on a collection of four-track home recordings by a Miami-based film professor named Sam Beam, the much-maligned genre got a big, bewildering boost. The Creek Drank the Cradle is a stunning collection of traditional folk music, as tender as it is dark, full of trembling banjo and guitar and odd, skewering images: burning bibles, dead horses, sidewalk girls, empty beds, bloody puppies, lost violins, tugged-on skirts. Beam’s whispery vocals are soft and unassuming, but there’s an ominous bent to his poems (“We found your name across the chapel door, carved in cursive with a table fork,” he warns in “Muddy Hymnal”) that makes this record riveting, despite its prettiness. –Amanda Petrusich\n\nListen: Iron & Wine: “Upward Over the Mountain”\n\n136.\n\nNo Age: Weirdo Rippers (2007)\n\nWeirdo Rippers isn’t precisely No Age’s debut LP, a collection of early limited-run rarities, or collection of their then-greatest hits. In point of fact, it’s all three; a pretty impressive intro for a couple of fairly modest hardcore dudes, even if they do occasionally make enough noise for 20. Plucking only the best bits from five concurrently released EPs (any and all of which are worth hearing by their lonesome), Weirdo Rippers rearranges all their then-best tunes and a few floaters into a blissed-out blitzkrieg you’d hardly guess wasn’t conceived as a piece. It’s no wonder these dudes took off the way they did, seeing as this was how most people first heard them; Nouns, their proper debut, may be more enveloping and compositionally sophisticated, but Weirdo Rippers finds No Age pushing hooks over haze, kicking out blurry primitively catchy sunsoaked thrashabouts with endlessly expanding ease. –Paul Thompson\n\nListen: No Age: “Everybody’s Down”\n\n135.\n\nSigur Rós: ( ) (2002)\n\nTo recap, the third album by Iceland’s Sigur Rós seemed built to rank among the most pretentious and esoteric LPs ever made: All of the vocals would be sung in Hopelandic, a vernacular invented by the band. The title would be a set of parentheses with a space in the middle, an invitation for listeners to add their own theme. The eight tracks wouldn’t have names, either, and the artwork would consist of white paper and a few greyscale landscapes. What was next, Jonsi, a split with Reynols? But such restrained exposition augments (), so that its music becomes the movie and not the soundtrack and so that– in the twinkling keyboards of track three, through the narcotic drift of track four, above the coda of track eight that’s more powerful than any crescendo Arcade Fire or Explosions in the Sky has ever put to tape– listening and responding is the only thing left. Do it closely, and– through tears, daydreams, smiles, and goosebumps– you can name every tune. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Sigur Rós: “Untitled 3”\n\n134.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age: Songs for the Deaf (2002)\n\nTen years after their Blues for the Red Sun set a gold standard in stoner rock, former Kyuss members Nick Oliveri and Josh Homme– along with Seattle-scene vets Dave Grohl and Mark Lanegan– flat-out exceeded it. Songs for the Deaf pulled off the same feat Blue Öyster Cult and Zen Arcade did in previous decades, delivering a bracing jolt that fused punk and hard rock sensibilities with an artful sense of eclecticism. Singles “Go With the Flow” and “No One Knows” earned their modern rock radio spins, but songs like the Cheap Trick-gone-sour “Gonna Leave You” and garage-psych throwback “Another Love Song” could’ve easily followed them onto heavy rotation, while the more metal-skewing deep cuts (“The Sky Is Fallin’”; “A Song for the Deaf”) grounded the album in a robust heaviness. It’s all held together with a leviathan of a rhythm section, guitars that bristle with a needle-sharp electricity, and a restless narcotic energy that echoes a theme of driving around restlessly, waiting for something good to come on the radio. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Queens of the Stone Age: “No One Knows”\n\n133.\n\nErykah Badu: New Amerykah Part One: 4th World War (2008)\n\nErykah Badu’s music had undeniably gotten darker and less soul-snob friendly over the course of the decade. But her base appeal remained the same, even if overt nods to out-jazz and underground rap were bound to attract a new brand of fan. What hits you on your 10th play of New Amerykah is not Badu’s sonic invention but the force of her personality– equal parts spiritual seeker, round-the-way girl, boho striver, and cultural scold. You’re getting a real person on New Amerykah, rich in contradictions and ideals and recognizable fears, something still rare enough at her level of fame that it’s both disarming and comforting. The fact that she chose to give herself to us over music so astoundingly odd and beautiful seems like a bonus, really. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Erykah Badu: “Honey”\n\n132.\n\nHercules and Love Affair: Hercules and Love Affair (2008)\n\n“Hercules’ Theme” might be Andy Butler and sultry singer Nomi squeezing into the “Shaft” suit, but in a lovely ironic twist, the best pure club album of the decade devotes most of its emotional energy to delayed gratifications. Discovering that Hercules wandered alone until the end of his life searching for his kidnapped (male) lover, Butler built his long-simmering bow from the raw passion latent in unresolved tension and heartache, and cast the perfect players to fill out the expansive set-pieces. The star of the show, however, is undeniably Antony Hegarty, whose dark, warbly tenor transports perfectly into Butler’s opulent disco. Hegarty takes the airtight arrangements of “Blind” and “Time Will” as mere structural suggestions, investing lines like “I cannot hold half a life” and “when I find myself alone, I feel like I am blind” with a fervor and sensuality that feels downright divine. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Hercules and Love Affair: “Blind”\n\n131.\n\nThe Notwist: Neon Golden (2002)\n\nRadiohead’s early-decade recipe of electronic-flavored art-rock served with heaping portions of post-millennial paranoia and disaffection left listeners ravenous to find other bands that could whip up those prickly moods and sonic textures. Enter the Notwist, by no means a bunch of Radiohead acolytes, but a group that happened to be pushing many of the same buttons as the English quintet. Notwist’s 2002 breakthrough, Neon Golden, is a great work of narrow emotional response. Atop taut, hypnotic beds made of things like acoustic guitar, banjo, meditative sax tones, and random electro-junk, vocalist Markus Acher manages to sell lines like “We are satisfied/ From Monday to Friday and on Sunday we cry” through sheer alienated absence of affect. –Joshua Love\n\nListen: The Notwist: “Consequence”\n\n130.\n\nClipse: We Got It 4 Cheap Vol. 2 (2005)\n\nNow that Hell Hath No Fury is no longer trapped in record-industry limbo– now that it has taken its rightful place among fellow cult-favorite commercial flops like Bubba Sparxxx’s Deliverance– the We Got It 4 Cheap mixtapes can be seen a little more clearly for what they are: The greatest collection of freestyles recorded over old G-Unit and Dipset beats by Grammy-nominated street rappers trying desperately to break their label contract ever. Vol. 2 remains the purest distillation of the Thornton brothers’ narrow brand of genius, a treasure trove of punchlines so impeccably phrased, turned, and timed that they transcend their punchline status. The insouciance of Pusha and Mal’s drug talk got some white people angrier with each other than at any point since the “Seinfeld” finale, but the writing on this mixtape mounts its own defense of its subject matter, gleaming with a fierce love for words and a helpless fascination with the infinite ways they can be put together to say new versions of the same thing. In short: These are still some of the most quotable raps of the decade. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Clipse: “Zen”\n\n129.\n\nThe Streets: A Grand Don’t Come for Free (2004)\n\nStrange that the explosion of social networking sites coincided with Mike Skinner losing touch of his greatest attribute– the ability to sound like someone you don’t know but would still call a friend. That gift was maximized on A Grand Don’t Come For Free, a record that really needed it in the worst way. Overcoming wallpaper beats, impossible plot points (for his next trick, he’ll lose his ATM card in a plasma TV), spoilers, and, well a plot to begin with, Grand’s frankly stunning replay value stems from creating perfectly drawn vignettes that stand alone as individual set pieces. That first date that’s going a little too well for comfort (“Could Well Be In”). The packed club that still feels like the loneliest place in the world (“Blinded by the Lights”). The heartbreak that’s so crippling that you clutch to clichés like “there’s plenty more fish in the sea” as if they could truly save you (imagine if “Dry Your Eyes” actually kept its rumored hook by Chris Martin). And then the beat switches in “Empty Cans”, and you realize listening to A Grand might be akin to Facebooking an ex, but damn if Skinner rationalizes that too: “Something that was not meant to be is done/ And this is the start of what was.” –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: The Streets: “Dry Your Eyes”\n\n128.\n\nLife Without Buildings: Any Other City (2001)\n\nSue Tompkins might be the most striking indie singer of the decade. She sounds like an internal monologue. She rattles out streams of words, repeating phrases and fragments like someone compulsively murmuring a list she’s trying not to forget. She rolls and stretches words around in her mouth. She makes girlish exclamations and then whips around to chest-beating boasts, defiant dares, wounded questions. Her voice bounces and twirls acrobatically all around the music, then pulls itself up into passionate demands like lines ripped from an argument: “Look back and say that I didn’t!” She does all this and yet sounds really normal and down-to-earth and awesome about it. Glasgow’s Life Without Buildings backed up her gorgeous high-wire act with perfectly understated guitar work, and made just this one incredible, gem-like album– lovable, beautiful, and moving, the kind of treasure with a mood and aesthetic entirely its own. Then they broke up. It’s a good thing this one’s so endlessly replayable, so worth poring over every tic, stutter, and syllable. –Nitsuh Abebe\n\nListen: Life Without Buildings: “New Town”\n\n127.\n\nSleater-Kinney: The Woods (2005)\n\nBy album seven, the life-cycle of most bands would dictate stagnation, or at least a move towards more “mature” themes. Not Sleater-Kinney. A jump to Sub Pop from longtime home Kill Rock Stars and the enlistment of producer Dave Fridmann kickstarted a short but brave new era for the band. On The Woods, the trio rock out with their cocks out, embracing their inner shag-haired arena gods via florid guitar solos and thunderous low-end crunch, not to mention an 11-minute song about fucking. It was the most body-focused music of Sleater-Kinney’s career, but it didn’t come at the expense of the head: “Modern Girl” coats the emptiness of consumer culture in sugary melody, “Entertain” disses merchants of mediocre art, “Jumpers” offers sympathy for a suicide. It would be the band’s last album (not forever, let’s hope). –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: Sleater-Kinney: “Modern Girl”\n\n126.\n\nMastodon: Leviathan (2004)\n\nThis decade, the metal underground dropped its stadium ambitions and turned inward, splitting off into dozens of subgenre variations and bashing away in tiny rooms. Mastodon rose to the top of that pack not by bringing back accessibility or grandeur but by doing crusty, misanthropic churn better than anyone else– which, after all, is how a band like Metallica ascended to stadium status in the first place. Leviathan, still Mastodon’s best, is a concept album about a Herman Melville Novel. That’s the sort of dubious idea that you’d think only a stoned American Lit study group or the Decemberists could conjure, but Mastodon make it work by tapping into the primal dread and awe that comes with a gigantic whale smashing the fuck out of a whole whaling ship. Their bile-gargling vocals and juddering riffs and double-bass pummel all work together like a terrible machine, and even something as epically ambitious as the 14-minute “Hearts Alive” stays gripping throughout. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Mastodon: “Blood and Thunder”\n\n125.\n\nThe Books: Thought for Food (2002)\n\nThe Books’ debut splits the difference between a joke and a revelation. Sometimes the duo of Paul de Jong and Nick Zammuto act ridiculous: a dead fish realizes it’s dead; a dad disses his daughter. But other samples are anonymous and mysterious, and the music that envelopes them is sublime. From the sweep of a cello to an indescribable clatter, every detail catches the ear, and the instruments are cut and overdubbed so carefully that the seams vanish. These passages are as alluring as the gags are wacky– or maybe the humor helps us give in to a sense of wonder. The Books’ later discs smooth out their rough edges, but this one’s the most fun, and you may still wonder from moment to moment exactly what’s making you smile. –Chris Dahlen\n\nListen: The Books: “Enjoy Your Worries, You May Never Have Them Again”\n\n124.\n\nPJ Harvey: Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea (2000)\n\nIt could have been Polly Jean’s jump-the-shark moment. Having built a career pushing the boundaries of art-diva dramatics, playing it straight was possibly her riskiest move yet. A fashionista glamour shot on the cover? Mousse-slick production? Songs about luuuurve? Uh oh. But it turns out that Happy PJ can be just as compelling as Tortured PJ, and sometimes even as scary (see: the violent lust of “Big Exit”, the unbridled horniness of “This Is Love”). Unfortunately, history added another level of spookiness to the album. After 9/11, Harvey’s reminiscences of romance on the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn took on a previously unimagined sense of dread. It just isn’t possible to hear “This Mess We’re In”, with duet partner Thom Yorke singing “Can you hear them?/ The helicopters?/ We’re in New York,” the same way again. Following Stories, PJ Harvey returned to unabashed weirdness; the three albums she has released since are as raw as ever. Any further drifting into the chick flick netherworld was thankfully avoided. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: PJ Harvey: “This Mess We’re In”\n\n123.\n\nFour Tet: Rounds (2003)\n\nThere’s exacting and there’s shambling. And then there’s Rounds smack in the middle of the two. Kieran Hebden’s finest LP is a sweet-spot masterclass, zoning out on the precise midpoint between jazz, hip-hop, folk, and Warp-ed electro. There’s as much John Coltrane as there is J Dilla, yet this is no mash-up exercise. Critics called it “folktronica”– about as inelegant a term imaginable for something so seamless. For all of the enveloping drums and whittled acoustic guitars, Rounds’ secret weapon is air. Whether its the oxygen tank breaths that runs through “My Angel Rocks Back and Forth” or the exhaling rubberducky squeaking on “Slow Jam” or the hi-hat’s hiss on “Spirit Fingers”, Hebden humanizes his laptop-born instrumentals with constant sonic CPR. The album starts with a heartbeat; flatlining is inconceivable. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Four Tet: “As Serious As Your Life”\n\n122.\n\nRyan Adams: Heartbreaker (2000)\n\nHeartbreaker should be disqualified from such lists: Its raw nerves inspired a legion of jackasses to chord an acoustic clumsily. But these 14 songs, recorded in as many days between the end of Whiskeytown and the release of its swan song, still stun: Emmylou Harris’ harmony on the soul-draining “Oh My Sweet Carolina” recalls her chemistry with Adams’ icon, while Gillian Welch chills the air of “Bartering Lines”, a creeping banjo blues, with steely exhalations. He misses his girl as soon as she’s driving home, and he hates everything– his best records, his favorite friends, her sweetest gifts– when she finally bails. There have been plenty of reasons to pity Adams this decade. Heartbreaker, though, inspires the kind of regret you feel for anyone that’s ever lost at love. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Ryan Adams: “Come Pick Me Up”\n\n121.\n\nBroadcast: Haha Sound (2003)\n\nIf there is a nostalgia at work in the music of Birmingham’s Broadcast, it is the wistful nostalgia for an alternate pop-cultural history– a timeline whose canon is dominated by such mad scientists as Joe Meek or the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, synth pioneers Silver Apples, and the vintage soundtracks of cult films like Valerie and Her Week of Wonders. On Broadcast’s second studio album, Haha Sound, the full spectrum of their inventive scavenging is on exuberant display. Considerably more turbulent than their debut The Noise Made By People, Broadcast move gracefully from the primal Krautrock throb of “Pendulum” and raucous, Meek-inspired instrumentals to tracks of almost impossible delicacy such as the lullaby-like “Valerie” or the gauzy “Winter Now”. Above all the tumult, Trish Keenan provides a crucial human element, keeping the album stabilized with her serene vocals and expressive melodies, sounding wholly unflappable no matter how much the ground might pitch beneath her feet. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Broadcast: “Before We Begin”\n\n120.\n\nTed Leo and the Pharmacists: The Tyranny of Distance (2001)\n\nChoosing favorites among Leo’s output is tough– the reasons for loving any of his records are constant, though maybe more obvious here: Where else in this decade can you find a crate-digger who’ll name his record for a Split Enz lyric? Or some who will wear a Thin Lizzy jacket on the sleeve but writes songs as graceful and approachable as “Biomusicology” or “Under the Hedge”? Formed in between Pharmacists lineups and aided by numerous friends in the studio, Tryanny of Distance sounds cobbled together by the pieces of a lifetime’s listening while still remarkably cohesive and whole. The album only strains to be clever in its compositions, but never arch in its delivery; in fact, when the microphone distorts on tracks like “Stove by a Whale” or “You Could Die (Or This Might End)”, it sounds less like a calculated studio affectation and more like the force of Leo’s voice tearing speaker cones. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: Ted Leo and the Pharmacists: “Biomusicology”\n\n119.\n\nEminem: The Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\n\nCan a monster be a hero? Misfits have run popular music for decades– cast out from modern life, forced to seek refuge in the self. Marshall Mathers fits the bill, but somehow he scared us more. It’s possible he was kidding about all the killing and raping and hating– he’s used the “Can’t take a joke?” defense for years now. But if it’s all a piss-take, then this album doesn’t matter nearly as much. Because although it is finely crafted platform for one of the most technically gifted rhymers of our lifetime, it’s the venom that shook the world. How far can we go together? Eminem observes a fan murder his pregnant wife as an ode to his favorite rapper, and later screams himself into mortal shock before slaughtering his own wife (again). He hoovers drugs and threatens date rape. He bashes gays and murders Dr. Dre. And, somehow, we root for him. What a sick joke. –Sean Fennessey\n\nListen: Eminem: “The Real Slim Shady”\n\n118.\n\nThe Beta Band: Hot Shots II (2001)\n\nWith a wickedly audacious way around different sounds (psych-rock, funk, hip-hop, breakbeat), the Beta Band not only made music that worked but seemed sublime. That is, when they weren’t screwing the pooch with confounders like “The Beta Band Rap” or “Monolith”. Fans never had it easy, but Hot Shots II, the Scottish prankster’s most consistently good album, made adoring them easier. Unlike the scattershot-brilliant Three EPs or batshit-crazy self-titled joint, the band’s sophomore LP eschews the busier basslines, beats, and samples for a spare set of taut folktronica. There’s some sonic variety, but lead “Squares”– a masterpiece of minimal trip-pop whose strange geometries corset Steve Mason’s wounded drone to heartbreaking effect– is pretty representative of the album’s emotional pitch. For those who love the Beta Band’s reckless exuberance, Hot Shots II probably smacks of a schizophrenic finally taking his meds, only to lose his edge. Sometimes competent has gotta trump brilliant. –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: The Beta Band: “Squares”\n\n117.\n\nLow: Things We Lost in the Fire (2001)\n\nAfter an eight-year career with only the slightest experimentation on their signature sound, Things We Lost in the Fire may be the quietest quantum leap forward in any band’s catalog. New instrumentation was folded gracefully into Low’s sparse setup as if the three-piece had been master arrangers the whole time, from the trumpet of “Dinosaur Act” to the strings and samples lurking underneath almost every vocal harmony (still front and center here, as always). The familiar tension and tenderness suddenly had an ocean of depth behind every tentative snare tap and guitar strum. That they’d only hinted at it before makes the album all the more stunning; they were suddenly willing to experiment at any turn, but never added a detail that made the song anything less than immaculate. The oppressive drone that leads to the acoustic lullaby of “In Metal” ends the record affirming that growth. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: Low: “Sunflower”\n\n116.\n\nMichael Mayer: Immer 1 (2002)\n\nIn the novelty-choked world of the DJ mix, where two-month-old tracks are hopelessly passé, the greatest compliment you can pay Immer is that it doesn’t sound dated in the slightest. Of course it helps that Michael Mayer’s selection sounded timeless to begin with. The Kompakt label’s next great calling card following 2001’s Total 3 compilation, Immer is as moody and windswept as the Mahler sample that crops up near the end, its beat-less strings sounding not a bit out of place amidst melancholy tech-house. “Minimal” is one thing Immer is not. It’s as gorgeously melodramatic, as unashamedly manipulative, as the work of any high-disco auteur or romantic composer. And it’s Mayer’s appeals to the “corny” emotions of his listeners that keeps them coming back when the luster’s worn away from the beat experiments of his sleeker, more fashion-conscious peers. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: M.Rahn: “Toaster”\n\n115.\n\nThe Shins: Oh, Inverted World (2001)\n\nRather than evoking any specific bygone era or sound, Oh, Inverted World creates its own nostalgia. The debut album from the then-Albuquerque-based Shins is bathed in just enough old-timey atmospherics to be entirely immersive, but never comes off as wink-and-nod referential. Underneath the album’s gentle haze is a treasure trove of impossibly graceful pop moments: the overlapping harmonies in “Girl on the Wing”, the concise and charming vocal melody of “The Celibate Life”, the giddy turnaround after the bridge of “Know Your Onion!”. By the time Oh, Inverted World became the poster record for “indie goes mainstream”– a good three years after the album’s release– many of us had already internalized it from beginning to end, ensuring that the music itself will live on well past both the hype and the backlash. –Matt LeMay\n\nListen: The Shins: “New Slang”\n\n114.\n\nCam'ron: Purple Haze (2004)\n\nThe album that launched a thousand rap blogs. By 2005 Cam’Ron, surrounded by a coterie of modest MCs just turning the corner (Juelz Santana, Jim Jones), was slithering around the Roc-A-Fella Records office trying to avoid dirty looks from Jay-Z. He’d already scored his long-predicted commercial smash with 2002’s Come Home With Me, so he was playing with house money. Call this a personal project for a relentlessly distant artist; an asshole’s lament. Purple Haze is simultaneously a refined, perfectly A&R-ed follow-up and one of the most confusing, crude full-lengths ever. Cam’s absurdist wit and impressive ability to coil syllables together are at their height. “Down and Out” both justified chipmunk soul entirely and threatened some sort of misogynist victory lap. “Get Em Girls” made opera safe for trunks. And Mizzle lead the most surprisingly knowing series of rap skits since De La had jokes. Cam hasn’t been this good in years. But, really, few rappers have. –Sean Fennessey\n\nListen: Cam’ron: “Down and Out”\n\n113.\n\nLCD Soundsystem: LCD Soundsystem (2005)\n\nJust as his post-millennial post-punk-exhuming peers were getting disposable, James Murphy went quotable, unleashing a reality check of a debut record that delivered on all the promise of his singles– which, B-sides and all, came conveniently bundled on this record’s second disc. While those peers were wearing their influences a little too snugly on their sleeves, Murphy was expertly synthesizing his and then laundry-listing them off en masse for kicks. While others were aloof, Murphy was envisioning house shows for arena bands and offering to “show us the ropes.” And according to the Gospel of James, we were “enfranchised and entrenched”, but “actually really really nice” too. This was indie populism for a new century and a savvier populace, where the wit of the dude pointing fingers from the sidelines and the heart of the dude wilding out right in the middle of it converged to become, well, the “fat guy in a t-shirt doing all the singing.” Yay for him. –Matthew Solarski\n\nListen: LCD Soundsystem: “Daft Punk Is Playing at My House”\n\n112.\n\nFeist: The Reminder (2007)\n\nJust about every review of Feist’s The Reminder felt compelled to mention her indie rock bona fides and her newfound soccer-mom appeal. A short-lived move to Paris, where she found that “trying to be cool is too exhausting,” spelled out the precariousness of her position, caught between cozy underground and iPod commercial ubiquity. The album feels almost prescient, then, in its sense of loneliness– cut loose from her Broken Social Scene, Feist sounds set adrift in songs awash in images of oceans, steam, fog, snow, wind, and moonlight. Cryptic mini-narratives of love and loss give way to the sense of a longing that can’t find its way into words– “The way home/ And it’s not about a boy/ Although, although”– while lyrics pile up, bleeding through from song to song, accruing a meaning you can’t quite put your finger on. The same goes for the music, though you might not notice it at first: the small, acoustic ensemble, often room-miked and recorded live, conveys an intimacy and immediacy that’s unusual for pop music. Incidental birdsong and the sound of fingers sliding on steel strings conjure an unmistakable sense of presence, one that only makes the album’s essential sense of loss all the more palpable. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Feist: “1 2 3 4”\n\n111.\n\nM83: Saturdays=Youth (2008)\n\nAs he gets older, Anthony Gonzalez seems to be getting better at separating riff from reality. Previous records Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts and Before the Dawn Heals Us offered impressive stabs of impressionistic and post-apocalyptic color, sometimes less song than emotive idea or pop culture touchstone. Saturdays=Youth, on the other hand, is if anything pre-apocalyptic, with Gonzalez and Morgan Kibby offering as tribute the purview of adolescence bracing for the catastrophe of adulthood. Inspired by the films of John Hughes and set amidst swaths of Cocteau Twins-esque synths and reverb, Saturdays proffers idyllic archetypes like “Kim and Jessie” and the self-absorbed, semi-suicidal 15-year-old “Graveyard Girl”. That is, Gonzalez’s synth-soaked production, slick and polished, places his conceit in the 80s of his own adolescence, but his subjects’ angst is immortal, accessible to the listener no matter which decade they call home. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: M83: “We Own the Sky”\n\n110.\n\nThe National: Boxer (2007)\n\nLet’s not tiptoe around the subject: The National are a little boring. Yet they’re boring in all of the right dependable, everyman ways– the ways parties and friends and lagers are boring. Boxer takes the sentiments from James Murphy’s “All My Friends” and stretches them over 12 lurching tracks. Berninger’s lyrics are like a twentysomething survival guide: “Can you carry my drink/ I have everything else”; returning “two armfuls of magazines”; “sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something.” Hell, the lingering sentiment of “Fake Empire”– “Let’s not try to figure out everything at once”– is the single most reassuring thing anyone’s said to me since college ended. The Boxer is an album for those who’ve needed their beers carried once or twice. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: The National: “Fake Empire”\n\n109.\n\nBand of Horses: Everything All the Time (2006)\n\n“Now, if you find yourself falling apart,” begins Ben Bridwell, Band of Horses’ bearded, howling frontman on the group’s debut LP, Everything All the Time. Everything is a record jammed with foreboding (“The Funeral” opens with the terrifying promise “I’m coming up only/ To hold you under,” before moving on to its dark-anthem chorus of “At every occasion, I’ll be ready for the funeral”), but each grim couplet is balanced by a moment of cathartic release (usually facilitated by a reverb-soaked guitar). Although the band occasionally gets tangled up in critical comparisons– Bridwell’s high, yawning vocals evoke Neil Young and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James– Everything All the Time is unique in its dissonance and beauty. Ergo: extraordinarily useful when you find yourself falling apart. –Amanda Petrusich\n\nListen: Band of Horses: “The Funeral”\n\n108.\n\nSonic Youth: Murray Street (2002)\n\nMurray Street’s propulsive, clean-lined jams skirted outright classic rock for maybe the first time in Sonic Youth’s career, but it wouldn’t be an SY album without the foursome reaffirming they could still do truculent and spaced-out with the best. The result is an album of halves– the first a loose Tom Verlaine/Jerry Garcia shredfest where each snaking, entwining note seems to sparkle; the second a fearsomely compressed and funny brand of cartoon no wave, with bonus dream-pop outro. It’s also the Sonic Youth album with something for everyone: the blow-out-your-eardrums noise kids; the folks who sussed the band’s kinship with Neil Young even before they toured together; the musique concrete fans who wished Goodbye 20th Century hadn’t been a one-off. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Sonic Youth: “Sympathy for the Strawberry”\n\n107.\n\nJustice: † (2007)\n\nThere’s a beauty to be extracted from every horrible noise– it’s a fertile enough philosophy to sustain a band like Sonic Youth for 30 years. But whereas SY found the divine in mechanical errors like mistunings and feedback, Justice’s vocabulary of musical crimes draws from the computer-age lawbook: shitty bitrates, EQ ignorance, and ringtones from blown-out cell-phone speakers. Gathering these wrong moments and sculpting them into a French house shape takes no small amount of craft, and Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay deserve their credit, no matter how much gear is conspicuously left unplugged in live appearances. Their bow on “We Are Your Friends” barely hinted at the glitchy abrasiveness Justice would bring to †, though “Phantom” and “Waters of Nazareth” were a stronger hint of their true M.O. But the broken-antenna fitfulness of “Newjack”, the disco glitz of “Phantom Pt. II” and the chipper electro-pop of “D.A.N.C.E.” showed how many different molds the duo could pour hot molten diginoise into without repeating themselves. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Justice: “D.A.N.C.E.”\n\n106.\n\nCaribou: Up in Flames (2003)\n\nThe 2003 release of Caribou’s (then Manitoba’s) Up in Flames served as an unofficial death knell for the “indietronica” marketing ploy of the early-to-mid 00s. While numerous artists had combined songcraft and digitally manipulated sound, none made it seem as natural and intuitive as Caribou’s Dan Snaith, who applied an effortless technical mastery to the heart-on-sleeve charm of indie pop. Snaith manipulated muscular drum loops and digitally fragmented vocals with an ease and homespun charm that would make a lo-fi troubadour blush, and his songwriting chops were just as strong as his production ones– and it’s the unique interplay of the two that makes Up In Flames so remarkable. It’s only fitting that such a record would emerge from an era in which a computer is as familiar and logical a means of expression as an acoustic guitar. –Matt LeMay\n\nListen: Caribou: “Crayon”\n\n105.\n\nBattles: Mirrored (2007)\n\nHere’s how you know you’ll be into Mirrored: You take a look at that iconic album cover and see a really jammin’ practice space. Here’s how you know you’ll really be into Mirrored: You take a look at that iconic album cover and see a Toys “R” Us. Mirrored’s got plenty of “how’d they pull that off?” moments, but the most impressive technical accomplishment was how it came off like a college caper movie in the vein of PCU, a bunch of highly intelligent wiseacres knocking down ivory towers and teaching the stuffed-shirted deans of math-rock and prog how to have some damn fun, conveying humor, groove, and even a little bit of a sex appeal without a single discernable word of English. Unsurprisingly, Mirrored didn’t set any new trends: for the rest of the decade, indie mostly shifted back to its fascination of working against constraints, whether it was budgetary or just instrumental capacity (though the two often went hand in hand). Which only goes further in illustrating its singularity– you know how sports fans argue about the kind of player they’d create when they’re playing Madden? That’s what Mirrored still sounds like– a video game version of a rock group whose only limits are their imaginations, and those things are cranked at 99. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Battles: “Atlas”\n\n104.\n\nThe Postal Service: Give Up (2003)\n\nIf the Postal Service’s second album never comes out, it wouldn’t be such a bad thing. Give Up is mid-decade indie pop flawlessly preserved in amber, Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello guiding the courtship between emo and IDM towards a new kind of shy, introspective new wave. But tracks like “Such Great Heights” and “Clark Gable” teeter just barely on the right side of a thin line between sappy and sublime– why tempt fate wi"
