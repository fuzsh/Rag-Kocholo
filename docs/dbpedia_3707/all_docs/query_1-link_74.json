Can there be such anger in the minds of the gods?\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.12 There was an ancient city, Carthage (held by colonists from Tyre),\n\nopposite Italy, and the far-off mouths of the Tiber,\n\nrich in wealth, and very savage in pursuit of war.\n\nThey say Juno loved this one land above all others,\n\neven neglecting Samos: here were her weapons\n\nand her chariot, even then the goddess worked at,\n\nand cherished, the idea that it should have supremacy\n\nover the nations, if only the fates allowed.\n\nYet she'd heard of offspring, derived from Trojan blood,\n\nthat would one day overthrow the Tyrian stronghold:\n\nthat from them a people would come, wide-ruling,\n\nand proud in war, to Libya's ruin: so the Fates ordained.\n\nFearing this, and remembering the ancient war\n\nshe had fought before, at Troy, for her dear Argos,\n\n(and the cause of her anger and bitter sorrows\n\nhad not yet passed from her mind: the distant judgement\n\nof Paris stayed deep in her heart, the injury to her scorned beauty,\n\nher hatred of the race, and abducted Ganymede's honours)\n\nthe daughter of Saturn, incited further by this,\n\nhurled the Trojans, the Greeks and pitiless Achilles had left,\n\nround the whole ocean, keeping them far from Latium:\n\nthey wandered for many years, driven by fate over all the seas.\n\nSuch an effort it was to found the Roman people.\n\nThey were hardly out of sight of Sicily's isle, in deeper water,\n\njoyfully spreading sail, bronze keel ploughing the brine,\n\nwhen Juno, nursing the eternal wound in her breast,\n\nspoke to herself: 'Am I to abandon my purpose, conquered,\n\nunable to turn the Teucrian king away from Italy!\n\nWhy, the fates forbid it. Wasn't Pallas able to burn\n\nthe Argive fleet, to sink it in the sea, because of the guilt\n\nand madness of one single man, Ajax, son of Oileus?\n\nShe herself hurled Jupiter's swift fire from the clouds,\n\nscattered the ships, and made the sea boil with storms:\n\nShe caught him up in a water-spout, as he breathed flame\n\nfrom his pierced chest, and pinned him to a sharp rock:\n\nyet I, who walk about as queen of the gods, wife\n\nand sister of Jove, wage war on a whole race, for so many years.\n\nIndeed, will anyone worship Juno's power from now on,\n\nor place offerings, humbly, on her altars?'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.50 So debating with herself, her heart inflamed, the goddess\n\ncame to Aeolia, to the country of storms, the place\n\nof wild gales. Here in his vast cave, King Aeolus,\n\nkeeps the writhing winds, and the roaring tempests,\n\nunder control, curbs them with chains and imprisonment.\n\nThey moan angrily at the doors, with a mountain's vast murmurs:\n\nAeolus sits, holding his sceptre, in his high stronghold,\n\nsoftening their passions, tempering their rage: if not,\n\nthey'd surely carry off seas and lands and the highest heavens,\n\nwith them, in rapid flight, and sweep them through the air.\n\nBut the all-powerful Father, fearing this, hid them\n\nin dark caves, and piled a high mountain mass over them\n\nand gave them a king, who by fixed agreement, would know\n\nhow to give the order to tighten or slacken the reins.\n\nJuno now offered these words to him, humbly:\n\n'Aeolus, since the Father of gods, and king of men,\n\ngave you the power to quell, and raise, the waves with the winds,\n\nthere is a people I hate sailing the Tyrrhenian sea,\n\nbringing Troy's conquered gods to Italy:\n\nAdd power to the winds, and sink their wrecked boats,\n\nor drive them apart, and scatter their bodies over the sea.\n\nI have fourteen Nymphs of outstanding beauty:\n\nof whom I'll name Deiopea, the loveliest in looks,\n\njoined in eternal marriage, and yours for ever, so that,\n\nfor such service to me as yours, she'll spend all her years\n\nwith you, and make you the father of lovely children.'\n\nAeolus replied: 'Your task, O queen, is to decide\n\nwhat you wish: my duty is to fulfil your orders.\n\nYou brought about all this kingdom of mine, the sceptre,\n\nJove's favour, you gave me a seat at the feasts of the gods,\n\nand you made me lord of the storms and the tempests.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.81 When he had spoken, he reversed his trident and struck\n\nthe hollow mountain on the side: and the winds, formed ranks,\n\nrushed out by the door he'd made, and whirled across the earth.\n\nThey settle on the sea, East and West wind,\n\nand the wind from Africa, together, thick with storms,\n\nstir it all from its furthest deeps, and roll vast waves to shore:\n\nfollows a cry of men and a creaking of cables.\n\nSuddenly clouds take sky and day away\n\nfrom the Trojan's eyes: dark night rests on the sea.\n\nIt thunders from the pole, and the aether flashes thick fire,\n\nand all things threaten immediate death to men.\n\nInstantly Aeneas groans, his limbs slack with cold:\n\nstretching his two hands towards the heavens,\n\nhe cries out in this voice: 'Oh, three, four times fortunate\n\nwere those who chanced to die in front of their father's eyes\n\nunder Troy's high walls! O Diomedes, son of Tydeus\n\nbravest of Greeks! Why could I not have fallen, at your hand,\n\nin the fields of Ilium, and poured out my spirit,\n\nwhere fierce Hector lies, beneath Achilles's spear,\n\nand mighty Sarpedon: where Simois rolls, and sweeps away\n\nso many shields, helmets, brave bodies, of men, in its waves!'\n\nHurling these words out, a howling blast from the north,\n\nstrikes square on the sail, and lifts the seas to heaven:\n\nthe oars break: then the prow swings round and offers\n\nthe beam to the waves: a steep mountain of water follows in a mass.\n\nSome ships hang on the breaker's crest: to others the yawning deep\n\nshows land between the waves: the surge rages with sand.\n\nThe south wind catches three, and whirls them onto hidden rocks\n\n(rocks the Italians call the Altars, in mid-ocean,\n\na vast reef on the surface of the sea) three the east wind drives\n\nfrom the deep, to the shallows and quick-sands (a pitiful sight),\n\ndashes them against the bottom, covers them with a gravel mound.\n\nA huge wave, toppling, strikes one astern, in front of his very eyes,\n\none carrying faithful Orontes and the Lycians.\n\nThe steersman's thrown out and hurled headlong, face down:\n\nbut the sea turns the ship three times, driving her round,\n\nin place, and the swift vortex swallows her in the deep.\n\nSwimmers appear here and there in the vast waste,\n\nmen's weapons, planking, Trojan treasure in the waves.\n\nNow the storm conquers Iloneus's tough ship, now Achates,\n\nnow that in which Abas sailed, and old Aletes's:\n\ntheir timbers sprung in their sides, all the ships\n\nlet in the hostile tide, and split open at the seams.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.124 Neptune, meanwhile, greatly troubled, saw that the sea\n\nwas churned with vast murmur, and the storm was loose\n\nand the still waters welled from their deepest levels:\n\nhe raised his calm face from the waves, gazing over the deep.\n\nHe sees Aeneas's fleet scattered all over the ocean,\n\nthe Trojans crushed by the breakers, and the plummeting sky.\n\nAnd Juno's anger, and her stratagems, do not escape her brother.\n\nHe calls the East and West winds to him, and then says:\n\n'Does confidence in your birth fill you so? Winds, do you dare,\n\nwithout my intent, to mix earth with sky, and cause such trouble,\n\nnow? You whom I -! But it's better to calm the running waves:\n\nyou'll answer to me later for this misfortune, with a different punishment.\n\nHurry, fly now, and say this to your king:\n\ncontrol of the ocean, and the fierce trident, were given to me,\n\nby lot, and not to him. He owns the wild rocks, home to you,\n\nand yours, East Wind: let Aeolus officiate in his palace,\n\nand be king in the closed prison of the winds.'\n\nSo he speaks, and swifter than his speech, he calms the swollen sea,\n\nscatters the gathered cloud, and brings back the sun.\n\nCymothoe and Triton, working together, thrust the ships\n\nfrom the sharp reef: Neptune himself raises them with his trident,\n\nparts the vast quicksand, tempers the flood,\n\nand glides on weightless wheels, over the tops of the waves.\n\nAs often, when rebellion breaks out in a great nation,\n\nand the common rabble rage with passion, and soon stones\n\nand fiery torches fly (frenzy supplying weapons),\n\nif they then see a man of great virtue, and weighty service,\n\nthey are silent, and stand there listening attentively:\n\nhe sways their passions with his words and soothes their hearts:\n\nso all the uproar of the ocean died, as soon as their father,\n\ngazing over the water, carried through the clear sky, wheeled\n\nhis horses, and gave them their head, flying behind in his chariot.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.157 The weary followers of Aeneas made efforts to set a course\n\nfor the nearest land, and tacked towards the Libyan coast.\n\nThere is a place there in a deep inlet: an island forms a harbour\n\nwith the barrier of its bulk, on which every wave from the deep\n\nbreaks, and divides into diminishing ripples.\n\nOn this side and that, vast cliffs and twin crags loom in the sky,\n\nunder whose summits the whole sea is calm, far and wide:\n\nthen, above that, is a scene of glittering woods,\n\nand a dark grove overhangs the water, with leafy shade:\n\nunder the headland opposite is a cave, curtained with rock,\n\ninside it, fresh water, and seats of natural stone,\n\nthe home of Nymphs. No hawsers moor the weary ships\n\nhere, no anchor, with its hooked flukes, fastens them.\n\nAeneas takes shelter here with seven ships gathered\n\nfrom the fleet, and the Trojans, with a passion for dry land,\n\ndisembarking, take possession of the sands they longed for,\n\nand stretch their brine-caked bodies on the shore.\n\nAt once Achates strikes a spark from his flint,\n\ncatches the fire in the leaves, places dry fuel round it,\n\nand quickly has flames among the kindling.\n\nThen, wearied by events, they take out wheat, damaged\n\nby the sea, and implements of Ceres, and prepare to parch\n\nthe grain over the flames, and grind it on stone.\n\nAeneas climbs a crag meanwhile, and searches the whole prospect\n\nfar and wide over the sea, looking if he can see anything\n\nof Antheus and his storm-tossed Phrygian galleys,\n\nor Capys, or Caicus's arms blazoned on a high stern.\n\nThere's no ship in sight: he sees three stags wandering\n\non the shore: whole herds of deer follow at their back,\n\nand graze in long lines along the valley.\n\nHe halts at this, and grasps in his hand his bow\n\nand swift arrows, shafts that loyal Achates carries,\n\nand first he shoots the leaders themselves, their heads,\n\nwith branching antlers, held high, then the mass, with his shafts,\n\nand drives the whole crowd in confusion among the leaves:\n\nThe conqueror does not stop until he's scattered seven huge\n\ncarcasses on the ground, equal in number to his ships.\n\nThen he seeks the harbour, and divides them among all his friends.\n\nNext he shares out the wine that the good Acestes had stowed\n\nin jars, on the Trinacrian coast, and that hero had given them\n\non leaving: and speaking to them, calmed their sad hearts:\n\n'O friends (well, we were not unknown to trouble before)\n\nO you who've endured worse, the god will grant an end to this too.\n\nYou've faced rabid Scylla, and her deep-sounding cliffs:\n\nand you've experienced the Cyclopes's rocks:\n\nremember your courage and chase away gloomy fears:\n\nperhaps one day you'll even delight in remembering this.\n\nThrough all these misfortunes, these dangerous times,\n\nwe head for Latium, where the fates hold peaceful lives\n\nfor us: there Troy's kingdom can rise again. Endure,\n\nand preserve yourselves for happier days.'\n\nSo his voice utters, and sick with the weight of care, he pretends\n\nhope, in his look, and stifles the pain deep in his heart.\n\nThey make ready the game, and the future feast:\n\nthey flay the hides from the ribs and lay the flesh bare:\n\nsome cut it in pieces, quivering, and fix it on spits,\n\nothers place cauldrons on the beach, and feed them with flames.\n\nThen they revive their strength with food, stretched on the grass,\n\nand fill themselves with rich venison and old wine.\n\nWhen hunger is quenched by the feast, and the remnants cleared,\n\ndeep in conversation, they discuss their missing friends,\n\nand, between hope and fear, question whether they live,\n\nor whether they've suffered death and no longer hear their name.\n\nAeneas, the virtuous, above all mourns the lot of fierce Orontes,\n\nthen that of Amycus, together with Lycus's cruel fate,\n\nand those of brave Gyus, and brave Cloanthus.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.223 Now, all was complete, when Jupiter, from the heights of the air,\n\nlooked down on the sea with its flying sails, and the broad lands,\n\nand the coasts, and the people far and wide, and paused,\n\nat the summit of heaven, and fixed his eyes on the Libyan kingdom.\n\nAnd as he weighed such cares as he had in his heart, Venus spoke\n\nto him, sadder still, her bright eyes brimming with tears:\n\n'Oh you who rule things human, and divine, with eternal law,\n\nand who terrify them all with your lightning-bolt,\n\nwhat can my Aeneas have done to you that's so serious,\n\nwhat have the Trojans done, who've suffered so much destruction,\n\nto whom the whole world's closed, because of the Italian lands?\n\nSurely you promised that at some point, as the years rolled by,\n\nthe Romans would rise from them, leaders would rise,\n\nrestored from Teucer's blood, who would hold power\n\nover the sea, and all the lands. Father, what thought has changed\n\nyour mind? It consoled me for the fall of Troy, and its sad ruin,\n\nweighing one destiny, indeed, against opposing destinies:\n\nnow the same misfortune follows these men driven on by such\n\ndisasters. Great king, what end to their efforts will you give?\n\nAntenor could escape through the thick of the Greek army,\n\nand safely enter the Illyrian gulfs, and deep into the realms\n\nof the Liburnians, and pass the founts of Timavus,\n\nfrom which the river bursts, with a huge mountainous roar,\n\nthrough nine mouths, and buries the fields under its noisy flood.\n\nHere, nonetheless, he sited the city of Padua, and homes\n\nfor Teucrians, and gave the people a name, and hung up\n\nthe arms of Troy: now he's calmly settled, in tranquil peace.\n\nBut we, your race, to whom you permit the heights of heaven,\n\nlose our ships (shameful!), betrayed, because of one person's anger,\n\nand kept far away from the shores of Italy.\n\nIs this the prize for virtue? Is this how you restore our rule?\n\nThe father of men and gods, smiled at her with that look\n\nwith which he clears the sky of storms,\n\nkissed his daughter's lips, and then said this:\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.257 'Don't be afraid, Cytherea, your child's fate remains unaltered:\n\nYou'll see the city of Lavinium, and the walls I promised,\n\nand you'll raise great-hearted Aeneas high, to the starry sky:\n\nNo thought has changed my mind. This son of yours\n\n(since this trouble gnaws at my heart, I'll speak,\n\nand unroll the secret scroll of destiny)\n\nwill wage a mighty war in Italy, destroy proud peoples,\n\nand establish laws, and city walls, for his warriors,\n\nuntil a third summer sees his reign in Latium, and\n\nthree winter camps pass since the Rutulians were beaten.\n\nBut the boy Ascanius, surnamed Iulus now (He was Ilus\n\nwhile the Ilian kingdom was a reality) will imperially\n\ncomplete thirty great circles of the turning months,\n\nand transfer his throne from its site at Lavinium,\n\nand mighty in power, will build the walls of Alba Longa.\n\nHere kings of Hector's race will reign now\n\nfor three hundred years complete, until a royal priestess,\n\nIlia, heavy with child, shall bear Mars twins.\n\nThen Romulus will further the race, proud in his nurse\n\nthe she-wolf's tawny pelt, and found the walls of Mars,\n\nand call the people Romans, from his own name.\n\nI've fixed no limits or duration to their possessions:\n\nI've given them empire without end. Why, harsh Juno\n\nwho now torments land, and sea and sky with fear,\n\nwill respond to better judgement, and favour the Romans,\n\nmasters of the world, and people of the toga, with me.\n\nSo it is decreed. A time will come, as the years glide by,\n\nwhen the Trojan house of Assaracus will force Phthia\n\ninto slavery, and be lords of beaten Argos.\n\nFrom this glorious source a Trojan Caesar will be born,\n\nwho will bound the empire with Ocean, his fame with the stars,\n\nAugustus, a Julius, his name descended from the great Iulus.\n\nYou, no longer anxious, will receive him one day in heaven,\n\nburdened with Eastern spoils: he'll be called to in prayer.\n\nThen with wars abandoned, the harsh ages will grow mild:\n\nWhite haired Trust, and Vesta, Quirinus with his brother Remus\n\nwill make the laws: the gates of War, grim with iron,\n\nand narrowed by bars, will be closed: inside impious Rage will roar\n\nfrighteningly from blood-stained mouth, seated on savage weapons,\n\nhands tied behind his back, with a hundred knots of bronze.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.297 Saying this, he sends Mercury, Maia's son, down from heaven,\n\nso that the country and strongholds of this new Carthage\n\nwould open to the Trojans, as guests, and Dido, unaware of fate,\n\nwould not keep them from her territory. He flies through the air\n\nwith a beating of mighty wings and quickly lands on Libyan shore.\n\nAnd soon does as commanded, and the Phoenicians set aside\n\ntheir savage instincts, by the god's will: the queen above all\n\nadopts calm feelings, and kind thoughts, towards the Trojans.\n\nBut Aeneas, the virtuous, turning things over all night,\n\ndecides, as soon as kindly dawn appears, to go out\n\nand explore the place, to find what shores he has reached,\n\non the wind, who owns them (since he sees desert)\n\nman or beast, and bring back the details to his friends.\n\nHe conceals the boats in over-hanging woods\n\nunder an arching cliff, enclosed by trees\n\nand leafy shadows: accompanied only by Achetes,\n\nhe goes, swinging two broad-bladed spears in his hand.\n\nHis mother met him herself, among the trees, with the face\n\nand appearance of a virgin, and a virgin's weapons,\n\na Spartan girl, or such as Harpalyce of Thrace,\n\nwho wearies horses, and outdoes winged Hebrus in flight.\n\nFor she'd slung her bow from her shoulders, at the ready,\n\nlike a huntress, and loosed her hair for the wind to scatter,\n\nher knees bare, and her flowing tunic gathered up in a knot.\n\nAnd she cried first: 'Hello, you young men, tell me,\n\nif you've seen my sister wandering here by any chance,\n\nwearing a quiver, and the hide of a dappled lynx,\n\nor shouting, hot on the track of a slavering boar?'\n\nSo Venus: and so Venus's son began in answer:\n\n'I've not seen or heard any of your sisters, O Virgin —\n\nor how should I name you? Since your looks are not mortal\n\nand your voice is more than human: oh, a goddess for certain!\n\nOr Phoebus's sister? Or one of the race of Nymphs?\n\nBe kind, whoever you may be, and lighten our labour,\n\nand tell us only what sky we're under, and what shores\n\nwe've landed on: we're adrift here, driven by wind and vast seas,\n\nknowing nothing of the people or the country:\n\nmany a sacrifice to you will fall at the altars, under our hand.'\n\nThen Venus said: 'I don't think myself worthy of such honours:\n\nit's the custom of Tyrian girls to carry a quiver,\n\nand lace our calves high up, over red hunting boots.\n\nYou see the kingdom of Carthage, Tyrians, Agenor's city:\n\nbut bordered by Libyans, a people formidable in war.\n\nDido rules this empire, having set out from Tyre,\n\nfleeing her brother. It's a long tale of wrong, with many\n\nwindings: but I'll trace the main chapters of the story.\n\nSychaeus was her husband, wealthiest, in land, of Phoenicians\n\nand loved with a great love by the wretched girl,\n\nwhose father gave her as a virgin to him, and wed them\n\nwith great solemnity. But her brother Pygmalion, savage\n\nin wickedness beyond all others, held the kingdom of Tyre.\n\nMadness came between them. The king, blinded by greed for gold,\n\nkilled the unwary Sychaeus, secretly, with a knife, impiously,\n\nin front of the altars, indifferent to his sister's affections.\n\nHe concealed his actions for a while, deceived the lovesick girl,\n\nwith empty hopes, and many evil pretences.\n\nBut the ghost of her unburied husband came to her in dream:\n\nlifting his pale head in a strange manner, he laid bare the cruelty\n\nat the altars, and his heart pierced by the knife,\n\nand unveiled all the secret wickedness of that house.\n\nThen he urged her to leave quickly and abandon her country,\n\nand, to help her journey, revealed an ancient treasure\n\nunder the earth, an unknown weight of gold and silver.\n\nShaken by all this, Dido prepared her flight and her friends.\n\nThose who had fierce hatred of the tyrant or bitter fear,\n\ngathered together: they seized some ships that by chance\n\nwere ready, and loaded the gold: greedy Pygmalion's riches\n\nare carried overseas: a woman leads the enterprise.\n\nThe came to this place, and bought land, where you now see\n\nthe vast walls, and resurgent stronghold, of new Carthage,\n\nas much as they could enclose with the strips of hide\n\nfrom a single bull, and from that they called it Byrsa.\n\nBut who then are you? What shores do you come from?\n\nWhat course do you take?' He sighed as she questioned him,\n\nand drawing the words from deep in his heart he replied:\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.372 'O goddess, if I were to start my tale at the very beginning,\n\nand you had time to hear the story of our misfortunes,\n\nVesper would have shut day away in the closed heavens.\n\nA storm drove us at whim to Libya's shores,\n\nsailing the many seas from ancient Troy,\n\nif by chance the name of Troy has come to your hearing.\n\nI am that Aeneas, the virtuous, who carries my household gods\n\nin my ship with me, having snatched them from the enemy,\n\nmy name is known beyond the sky.\n\nI seek my country Italy, and a people born of Jupiter on high.\n\nI embarked on the Phrygian sea with twenty ships,\n\nfollowing my given fate, my mother, a goddess, showing the way:\n\nbarely seven are left, wrenched from the wind and waves.\n\nI myself wander, destitute and unknown, in the Libyan desert,\n\ndriven from Europe and Asia.' Venus did not wait\n\nfor further complaint but broke in on his lament like this:\n\n'Whoever you are I don't think you draw the breath of life\n\nwhile hated by the gods, you who've reached a city of Tyre.\n\nOnly go on from here, and take yourself to the queen's threshold,\n\nsince I bring you news that your friends are restored,\n\nand your ships recalled, driven to safety by the shifting winds,\n\nunless my parents taught me false prophecies, in vain.\n\nSee, those twelve swans in exultant line, that an eagle,\n\nJupiter's bird, swooping from the heavens,\n\nwas troubling in the clear sky: now, in a long file, they seem\n\nto have settled, or be gazing down now at those who already have.\n\nAs, returning, their wings beat in play, and they circle the zenith\n\nin a crowd, and give their cry, so your ships and your people\n\nare in harbour, or near its entrance under full sail.\n\nOnly go on, turn your steps where the path takes you.'\n\nShe spoke, and turning away she reflected the light\n\nfrom her rose-tinted neck, and breathed a divine perfume\n\nfrom her ambrosial hair: her robes trailed down to her feet,\n\nand, in her step, showed her a true goddess. He recognised\n\nhis mother, and as she vanished followed her with his voice:\n\n'You too are cruel, why do you taunt your son with false\n\nphantoms? Why am I not allowed to join hand\n\nwith hand, and speak and hear true words?'\n\nSo he accuses her, and turns his steps towards the city.\n\nBut Venus veiled them with a dark mist as they walked,\n\nand, as a goddess, spread a thick covering of cloud around them,\n\nso that no one could see them, or touch them,\n\nor cause them delay, or ask them where they were going.\n\nShe herself soars high in the air, to Paphos, and returns to her home\n\nwith delight, where her temple and its hundred altars\n\nsteam with Sabean incense, fragrant with fresh garlands.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.418 Meanwhile they've tackled the route the path revealed.\n\nAnd soon they climbed the hill that looms high over the city,\n\nand looks down from above on the towers that face it.\n\nAeneas marvels at the mass of buildings, once huts,\n\nmarvels at the gates, the noise, the paved roads.\n\nThe eager Tyrians are busy, some building walls,\n\nand raising the citadel, rolling up stones by hand,\n\nsome choosing the site for a house, and marking a furrow:\n\nthey make magistrates and laws, and a sacred senate:\n\nhere some are digging a harbour: others lay down\n\nthe deep foundations of a theatre, and carve huge columns\n\nfrom the cliff, tall adornments for the future stage.\n\nJust as bees in early summer carry out their tasks\n\namong the flowery fields, in the sun, when they lead out\n\nthe adolescent young of their race, or cram the cells\n\nwith liquid honey, and swell them with sweet nectar,\n\nor receive the incoming burdens, or forming lines\n\ndrive the lazy herd of drones from their hives:\n\nthe work glows, and the fragrant honey's sweet with thyme.\n\n'O fortunate those whose walls already rise!'\n\nAeneas cries, and admires the summits of the city.\n\nHe enters among them, veiled in mist (marvellous to tell)\n\nand mingles with the people seen by no one.\n\nThere was a grove in the centre of the city, delightful\n\nwith shade, where the wave and storm-tossed Phoenicians\n\nfirst uncovered the head of a fierce horse, that regal Juno\n\nshowed them: so the race would be noted in war,\n\nand rich in substance throughout the ages.\n\nHere Sidonian Dido was establishing a great temple\n\nto Juno, rich with gifts and divine presence,\n\nwith bronze entrances rising from stairways, and beams\n\njointed with bronze, and hinges creaking on bronze doors.\n\nHere in the grove something new appeared that calmed his fears\n\nfor the first time, here for the first time Aeneas dared to hope\n\nfor safety, and to put greater trust in his afflicted fortunes.\n\nWhile, waiting for the queen, in the vast temple, he looks\n\nat each thing: while he marvels at the city's wealth,\n\nthe skill of their artistry, and the products of their labours,\n\nhe sees the battles at Troy in their correct order,\n\nthe War, known through its fame to the whole world,\n\nthe sons of Atreus, of Priam, and Achilles angered with both.\n\nHe halted, and said, with tears: 'What place is there,\n\nAchates, what region of earth not full of our hardships?\n\nSee, Priam! Here too virtue has its rewards, here too\n\nthere are tears for events, and mortal things touch the heart.\n\nLose your fears: this fame will bring you benefit.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.464 So he speaks, and feeds his spirit with the insubstantial frieze,\n\nsighing often, and his face wet with the streaming tears.\n\nFor he saw how, here, the Greeks fled, as they fought round Troy,\n\nchased by the Trojan youth, and, there, the Trojans fled,\n\nwith plumed Achilles pressing them close in his chariot.\n\nNot far away, through his tears, he recognises Rhesus's\n\nwhite-canvassed tents, that blood-stained Diomedes, Tydeus's son,\n\nlaid waste with great slaughter, betrayed in their first sleep,\n\ndiverting the fiery horses to his camp, before they could eat\n\nTrojan fodder, or drink from the river Xanthus.\n\nElsewhere Troilus, his weapons discarded in flight,\n\nunhappy boy, unequally matched in his battle with Achilles,\n\nis dragged by his horses, clinging face-up to the empty chariot,\n\nstill clutching the reins: his neck and hair trailing\n\non the ground, and his spear reversed furrowing the dust.\n\nMeanwhile the Trojan women with loose hair, walked\n\nto unjust Pallas's temple carrying the sacred robe,\n\nmourning humbly, and beating their breasts with their hands.\n\nThe goddess was turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground.\n\nThree times had Achilles dragged Hector round the walls of Troy,\n\nand now was selling the lifeless corpse for gold.\n\nThen Aeneas truly heaves a deep sigh, from the depths of his heart,\n\nas he views the spoils, the chariot, the very body of his friend,\n\nand Priam stretching out his unwarlike hands.\n\nHe recognised himself as well, fighting the Greek princes,\n\nand the Ethiopian ranks and black Memnon's armour.\n\nRaging Penthesilea leads the file of Amazons,\n\nwith crescent shields, and shines out among her thousands,\n\nher golden girdle fastened beneath her exposed breasts,\n\na virgin warrior daring to fight with men.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.494 While these wonderful sights are viewed by Trojan Aeneas,\n\nwhile amazed he hangs there, rapt, with fixed gaze,\n\nQueen Dido, of loveliest form, reached the temple,\n\nwith a great crowd of youths accompanying her.\n\nJust as Diana leads her dancing throng on Eurotas's banks,\n\nor along the ridges of Cynthus, and, following her,\n\na thousand mountain-nymphs gather on either side:\n\nand she carries a quiver on her shoulder, and overtops\n\nall the other goddesses as she walks: and delight\n\nseizes her mother Latona's silent heart:\n\nsuch was Dido, so she carried herself, joyfully,\n\namongst them, furthering the work, and her rising kingdom.\n\nThen, fenced with weapons, and resting on a high throne,\n\nshe took her seat, at the goddess's doorway, under the central vault.\n\nShe was giving out laws and statutes to the people, and sharing\n\nthe workers labour out in fair proportions, or assigning it by lot:\n\nwhen Aeneas suddenly saw Antheus, and Sergestus,\n\nand brave Cloanthus, approaching, among a large crowd,\n\nwith others of the Trojans whom the black storm-clouds\n\nhad scattered over the sea and carried far off to other shores.\n\nHe was stunned, and Achates was stunned as well\n\nwith joy and fear: they burned with eagerness to clasp hands,\n\nbut the unexpected event confused their minds.\n\nThey stay concealed and, veiled in the deep mist, they watch\n\nto see what happens to their friends, what shore they have left\n\nthe fleet on, and why they are here: the elect of every ship came\n\nbegging favour, and made for the temple among the shouting.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.520 When they'd entered, and freedom to speak in person\n\nhad been granted, Ilioneus, the eldest, began calmly:\n\n'O queen, whom Jupiter grants the right to found\n\na new city, and curb proud tribes with your justice,\n\nwe unlucky Trojans, driven by the winds over every sea,\n\npray to you: keep the terror of fire away from our ships,\n\nspare a virtuous race and look more kindly on our fate.\n\nWe have not come to despoil Libyan homes with the sword,\n\nor to carry off stolen plunder to the shore: that violence\n\nis not in our minds, the conquered have not such pride.\n\nThere's a place called Hesperia by the Greeks,\n\nan ancient land, strong in men, with a rich soil:\n\nThere the Oenotrians lived: now rumour has it\n\nthat a later people has called it Italy, after their leader.\n\nWe had set our course there when stormy Orion,\n\nrising with the tide, carried us onto hidden shoals,\n\nand fierce winds scattered us far, with the overwhelming surge,\n\nover the waves among uninhabitable rocks:\n\nwe few have drifted here to your shores.\n\nWhat race of men is this? What land is so barbaric as to allow\n\nthis custom, that we're denied the hospitality of the sands?\n\nThey stir up war, and prevent us setting foot on dry land.\n\nIf you despise the human race and mortal weapons,\n\nstill trust that the gods remember right and wrong.\n\nAeneas was our king, no one more just than him\n\nin his duty, or greater in war and weaponry.\n\nIf fate still protects the man, if he still enjoys the ethereal air,\n\nif he doesn't yet rest among the cruel shades, there's nothing\n\nto fear, and you'd not repent of vying with him first in kindness.\n\nThen there are cities and fields too in the region of Sicily,\n\nand famous Acestes, of Trojan blood. Allow us\n\nto beach our fleet, damaged by the storms,\n\nand cut planks from trees, and shape oars,\n\nso if our king's restored and our friends are found\n\nwe can head for Italy, gladly seek Italy and Latium:\n\nand if our saviour's lost, and the Libyan seas hold you,\n\nTroy's most virtuous father, if no hope now remains from Iulus,\n\nlet us seek the Sicilian straits, from which we were driven,\n\nand the home prepared for us, and a king, Acestes.'\n\nSo Ilioneus spoke: and the Trojans all shouted with one voice.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.561 Then, Dido, spoke briefly, with lowered eyes:\n\n'Trojans, free your hearts of fear: dispel your cares.\n\nHarsh events and the newness of the kingdom force me to effect\n\nsuch things, and protect my borders with guards on all sides.\n\nWho doesn't know of Aeneas's race, and the city of Troy,\n\nthe bravery, the men, or so great a blaze of warfare,\n\nindeed, we Phoenicians don't possess unfeeling hearts,\n\nthe sun doesn't harness his horses that far from this Tyrian city.\n\nWhether you opt for mighty Hesperia, and Saturn's fields,\n\nor the summit of Eryx, and Acestes for king,\n\nI'll see you safely escorted, and help you with my wealth.\n\nOr do you wish to settle here with me, as equals in my kingdom?\n\nThe city I build is yours: beach your ships:\n\nTrojans and Tyrians will be treated by me without distinction.\n\nI wish your king Aeneas himself were here, driven\n\nby that same storm! Indeed, I'll send reliable men\n\nalong the coast, and order them to travel the length of Libya,\n\nin case he's driven aground, and wandering the woods and towns.'\n\nBrave Achates, and our forefather Aeneas, their spirits raised\n\nby these words, had been burning to break free of the mist.\n\nAchates was first to speak, saying to Aeneas: 'Son of the goddess,\n\nwhat intention springs to your mind? You see all's safe,\n\nthe fleet and our friends have been restored to us.\n\nOnly one is missing, whom we saw plunged in the waves:\n\nall else is in accord with your mother's words.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.586 He'd scarcely spoken when the mist surrounding them\n\nsuddenly parted, and vanished in the clear air.\n\nAeneas stood there, shining in the bright daylight,\n\nlike a god in shoulders and face: since his mother\n\nhad herself imparted to her son beauty to his hair,\n\na glow of youth, and a joyful charm to his eyes:\n\nlike the glory art can give to ivory, or as when silver,\n\nor Parian marble, is surrounded by gold.\n\nThen he addressed the queen, suddenly, surprising them all,\n\nsaying: 'I am here in person, Aeneas the Trojan,\n\nhim whom you seek, saved from the Libyan waves.\n\nO Dido, it is not in our power, nor those of our Trojan race,\n\nwherever they may be, scattered through the wide world,\n\nto pay you sufficient thanks, you who alone have pitied\n\nTroy's unspeakable miseries, and share your city and home\n\nwith us, the remnant left by the Greeks, wearied\n\nby every mischance, on land and sea, and lacking everything.\n\nMay the gods, and the mind itself conscious of right,\n\nbring you a just reward, if the gods respect the virtuous,\n\nif there is justice anywhere. What happy age gave birth\n\nto you? What parents produced such a child?\n\nYour honour, name and praise will endure forever,\n\nwhatever lands may summon me, while rivers run\n\nto the sea, while shadows cross mountain slopes,\n\nwhile the sky nourishes the stars.' So saying he grasps\n\nhis friend Iloneus by the right hand, Serestus with the left,\n\nthen others, brave Gyus and brave Cloanthus.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.613 Sidonian Dido was first amazed at the hero's looks\n\nthen at his great misfortunes, and she spoke, saying:\n\n'Son of a goddess, what fate pursues you through all\n\nthese dangers? What force drives you to these barbarous shores?\n\nAre you truly that Aeneas whom kindly Venus bore\n\nto Trojan Anchises, by the waters of Phrygian Simois?\n\nIndeed, I myself remember Teucer coming to Sidon,\n\nexiled from his country's borders, seeking a new kingdom\n\nwith Belus's help: Belus, my father, was laying waste\n\nrich Cyprus, and, as victor, held it by his authority.\n\nSince then the fall of the Trojan city is known to me,\n\nand your name, and those of the Greek kings.\n\nEven their enemy granted the Teucrians high praise,\n\nmaintaining they were born of the ancient Teucrian stock.\n\nSo come, young lords, and enter our palace.\n\nFortune, pursuing me too, through many similar troubles,\n\nwilled that I would find peace at last in this land.\n\nNot being unknown to evil, I've learned to aid the unhappy.'\n\nSo she speaks, and leads Aeneas into the royal house,\n\nand proclaims, as well, offerings at the god's temples.\n\nShe sends no less than twenty bulls to his friends\n\non the shore, and a hundred of her largest pigs with\n\nbristling backs, a hundred fat lambs with the ewes,\n\nand joyful gifts of wine, but the interior of the palace\n\nis laid out with royal luxury, and they prepare\n\na feast in the centre of the palace: covers worked\n\nskilfully in princely purple, massive silverware\n\non the tables, and her forefathers' heroic deeds\n\nengraved in gold, a long series of exploits traced\n\nthrough many heroes, since the ancient origins of her people.\n\nAeneas quickly sends Achates to the ships\n\nto carry the news to Ascanius (since a father's love\n\nwon't let his mind rest) and bring him to the city:\n\non Ascanius all the care of a fond parent is fixed.\n\nHe commands him to bring gifts too, snatched\n\nfrom the ruins of Troy, a figured robe stiff with gold,\n\nand a cloak fringed with yellow acanthus,\n\nworn by Helen of Argos, brought from Mycenae\n\nwhen she sailed to Troy and her unlawful marriage,\n\na wonderful gift from her mother Leda:\n\nand the sceptre that Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter,\n\nonce carried, and a necklace of pearls, and a double-coronet\n\nof jewels and gold. Achates, hastening to fulfil\n\nthese commands, took his way towards the ships.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.657 But Venus was planning new wiles and stratagems\n\nin her heart: how Cupid, altered in looks, might arrive\n\nin place of sweet Ascanius, and arouse the passionate queen\n\nby his gifts, and entwine the fire in her bones: truly she fears\n\nthe unreliability of this house, and the duplicitous Tyrians:\n\nunyielding Juno angers her, and her worries increase with nightfall.\n\nSo she speaks these words to winged Cupid:\n\n'My son, you who alone are my great strength, my power,\n\na son who scorns mighty Jupiter's Typhoean thunderbolts,\n\nI ask your help, and humbly call on your divine will.\n\nIt's known to you how Aeneas, your brother, is driven\n\nover the sea, round all the shores, by bitter Juno's hatred,\n\nand you have often grieved with my grief.\n\nPhoenician Dido holds him there, delaying him with flattery,\n\nand I fear what may come of Juno's hospitality:\n\nat such a critical turn of events she'll not be idle.\n\nSo I intend to deceive the queen with guile, and encircle\n\nher with passion, so that no divine will can rescue her,\n\nbut she'll be seized, with me, by deep love for Aeneas.\n\nNow listen to my thoughts on how you can achieve this.\n\nSummoned by his dear father, the royal child,\n\nmy greatest concern, prepares to go to the Sidonian city,\n\ncarrying gifts that survived the sea, and the flames of Troy.\n\nI'll lull him to sleep and hide him in my sacred shrine\n\non the heights of Cythera or Idalium, so he can know\n\nnothing of my deceptions, or interrupt them mid-way.\n\nFor no more than a single night imitate his looks by art,\n\nand, a boy yourself, take on the known face of a boy,\n\nso that when Dido takes you to her breast, joyfully,\n\namongst the royal feast, and the flowing wine,\n\nwhen she embraces you, and plants sweet kisses on you,\n\nyou'll breathe hidden fire into her, deceive her with your poison.'\n\nCupid obeys his dear mother's words, sets aside his wings,\n\nand laughingly trips along with Iulus's step.\n\nBut Venus pours gentle sleep over Ascanius's limbs,\n\nand warming him in her breast, carries him, with divine power,\n\nto Idalia's high groves, where soft marjoram smothers him\n\nin flowers, and the breath of its sweet shade.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.695 Now, obedient to her orders, delighting in Achetes as guide,\n\nCupid goes off carrying royal gifts for the Tyrians.\n\nWhen he arrives the queen has already settled herself\n\nin the centre, on her golden couch under royal canopies.\n\nNow our forefather Aeneas and the youth of Troy\n\ngather there, and recline on cloths of purple.\n\nServants pour water over their hands: serve bread\n\nfrom baskets: and bring napkins of smooth cloth.\n\nInside there are fifty female servants, in a long line,\n\nwhose task it is to prepare the meal, and tend the hearth fires:\n\na hundred more, and as many pages of like age,\n\nto load the tables with food, and fill the cups.\n\nAnd the Tyrians too are gathered in crowds through the festive\n\nhalls, summoned to recline on the embroidered couches.\n\nThey marvel at Aeneas's gifts, marvel at Iulus,\n\nthe god's brilliant appearance, and deceptive words,\n\nat the robe, and the cloak embroidered with yellow acanthus.\n\nThe unfortunate Phoenician above all, doomed to future ruin,\n\ncannot pacify her feelings, and catches fire with gazing,\n\nstirred equally by the child and by the gifts.\n\nHe, having hung in an embrace round Aeneas's neck,\n\nand sated the deceived father's great love,\n\nseeks out the queen. Dido, clings to him with her eyes\n\nand with her heart, taking him now and then on her lap,\n\nunaware how great a god is entering her, to her sorrow.\n\nBut he, remembering his Cyprian mother's wishes,\n\nbegins gradually to erase all thought of Sychaeus,\n\nand works at seducing her mind, so long unstirred,\n\nand her heart unused to love, with living passion.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 1.723 At the first lull in the feasting, the tables were cleared,\n\nand they set out vast bowls, and wreathed the wine with garlands.\n\nNoise filled the palace, and voices rolled out across the wide halls:\n\nbright lamps hung from the golden ceilings,\n\nand blazing candles dispelled the night.\n\nThen the queen asked for a drinking-cup, heavy\n\nwith gold and jewels, that Belus and all Belus's line\n\nwere accustomed to use, and filled it\n\nwith wine. Then the halls were silent. She spoke:\n\n'Jupiter, since they say you're the one who creates\n\nthe laws of hospitality, let this be a happy day\n\nfor the Tyrians and those from Troy,\n\nand let it be remembered by our children.\n\nLet Bacchus, the joy-bringer, and kind Juno be present,\n\nand you, O Phoenicians, make this gathering festive.'\n\nShe spoke and poured an offering of wine onto the table,\n\nand after the libation was the first to touch the bowl to her lips,\n\nthen she gave it to Bitias, challenging him: he briskly drained\n\nthe brimming cup, drenching himself in its golden fullness,\n\nthen other princes drank. Iolas, the long-haired, made\n\nhis golden lyre resound, he whom great Atlas taught.\n\nHe sang of the wandering moon and the sun's labours,\n\nwhere men and beasts came from, and rain and fire,\n\nof Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, the two Bears:\n\nwhy the winter suns rush to dip themselves in the sea,\n\nand what delay makes the slow nights linger.\n\nThe Tyrians redoubled their applause, the Trojans too.\n\nAnd unfortunate Dido, she too spent the night\n\nin conversation, and drank deep of her passion,\n\nasking endlessly about Priam and Hector:\n\nnow about the armour that Memnon, son of the Dawn,\n\ncame with to Troy, what kind were Diomed's horses,\n\nhow great was Achilles. 'But come, my guest, tell us\n\nfrom the start all the Greek trickery, your men's mishaps,\n\nand your wanderings: since it's the seventh summer now\n\nthat brings you here, in your journey, over every land and sea.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.1 Book II\n\nThey were all silent, and turned their faces towards him intently.\n\nThen from his high couch our forefather Aeneas began:\n\n'O queen, you command me to renew unspeakable grief,\n\nhow the Greeks destroyed the riches of Troy,\n\nand the sorrowful kingdom, miseries I saw myself,\n\nand in which I played a great part. What Myrmidon,\n\nor Dolopian, or warrior of fierce Ulysses, could keep\n\nfrom tears in telling such a story? Now the dew-filled night\n\nis dropping from the sky, and the setting stars urge sleep.\n\nBut if you have such desire to learn of our misfortunes,\n\nand briefly hear of Troy's last agonies, though my mind\n\nshudders at the memory, and recoils in sorrow, I'll begin.\n\n'After many years have slipped by, the leaders of the Greeks,\n\nopposed by the Fates, and damaged by the war,\n\nbuild a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas's divine art,\n\nand weave planks of fir over its ribs:\n\nthey pretend it's a votive offering: this rumour spreads.\n\nThey secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot,\n\nthere, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge\n\ncavernous insides with armed warriors.\n\nTenedos is within sight, an island known to fame,\n\nrich in wealth when Priam's kingdom remained,\n\nnow just a bay and an unsafe anchorage for boats:\n\nthey sail there, and hide themselves, on the lonely shore.\n\nWe thought they had gone, and were seeking Mycenae\n\nwith the wind. So all the Trojan land was free of its long sorrow.\n\nThe gates were opened: it was a joy to go and see the Greek camp,\n\nthe deserted site and the abandoned shore.\n\nHere the Dolopians stayed, here cruel Achilles,\n\nhere lay the fleet, here they used to meet us in battle.\n\nSome were amazed at virgin Minerva's fatal gift,\n\nand marvel at the horse's size: and at first Thymoetes,\n\nwhether through treachery, or because Troy's fate was certain,\n\nurged that it be dragged inside the walls and placed on the citadel.\n\nBut Capys, and those of wiser judgement, commanded us\n\nto either hurl this deceit of the Greeks, this suspect gift,\n\ninto the sea, or set fire to it from beneath,\n\nor pierce its hollow belly, and probe for hiding places.\n\nThe crowd, uncertain, was split by opposing opinions.\n\nThen Laocoon rushes down eagerly from the heights\n\nof the citadel, to confront them all, a large crowd with him,\n\nand shouts from far off: 'O unhappy citizens, what madness?\n\nDo you think the enemy's sailed away? Or do you think\n\nany Greek gift's free of treachery? Is that Ulysses's reputation?\n\nEither there are Greeks in hiding, concealed by the wood,\n\nor it's been built as a machine to use against our walls,\n\nor spy on our homes, or fall on the city from above,\n\nor it hides some other trick: Trojans, don't trust this horse.\n\nWhatever it is, I'm afraid of Greeks even those bearing gifts.'\n\nSo saying he hurled his great spear, with extreme force,\n\nat the creature's side, and into the frame of the curved belly.\n\nThe spear stuck quivering, and at the womb's reverberation\n\nthe cavity rang hollow and gave out a groan.\n\nAnd if the gods' fate, if our minds, had not been ill-omened,\n\nhe'd have incited us to mar the Greeks hiding-place with steel:\n\nTroy would still stand: and you, high tower of Priam would remain.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.57 See, meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, shouting loudly,\n\ndragging a youth, his hands tied behind his back, to the king.\n\nIn order to contrive this, and lay Troy open to the Greeks,\n\nhe had placed himself in their path, calm in mind, and ready\n\nfor either course: to engage in deception, or find certain death.\n\nThe Trojan youth run, crowding round, from all sides,\n\nto see him, and compete in mocking the captive.\n\nListen now to Greek treachery, and learn of all their crimes\n\nfrom just this one. Since, as he stood, looking troubled,\n\nunarmed, amongst the gazing crowd,\n\nand cast his eyes around the Phrygian ranks,\n\nhe said: 'Ah! What land, what seas would accept me now?\n\nWhat's left for me at the last in my misery, I who have\n\nno place among the Greeks, when the hostile Trojans,\n\nthemselves, demand my punishment and my blood?\n\nAt this the mood changed and all violence was checked.\n\nWe urged him to say what blood he was sprung from,\n\nand why he suffered: and tell us what trust could be placed\n\nin him as a captive. Setting fear aside at last he speaks:\n\n'O king, I'll tell you the whole truth, whatever happens,\n\nand indeed I'll not deny that I'm of Argive birth:\n\nthis first of all: if Fortune has made me wretched,\n\nshe'll not also wrongly make me false and a liar.\n\nIf by any chance some mention of Palamedes's name\n\nhas reached your ears, son of Belus, and talk\n\nof his glorious fame, he whom the Pelasgians,\n\non false charges of treason, by atrocious perjury,\n\nbecause he opposed the war, sent innocent to his death,\n\nand who they mourn, now he's taken from the light:\n\nwell my father, being poor, sent me here to the war\n\nwhen I was young, as his friend, as we were blood relatives.\n\nWhile Palamedes was safe in power, and prospered\n\nin the kings' council, I also had some name and respect.\n\nBut when he passed from this world above, through\n\nthe jealousy of plausible Ulysses (the tale's not unknown)\n\nI was ruined, and spent my life in obscurity and grief,\n\ninwardly angry at the fate of my innocent friend.\n\nMaddened I could not be silent, and I promised, if chance allowed,\n\nand if I ever returned as a victor to my native Argos,\n\nto avenge him, and with my words stirred bitter hatred.\n\nThe first hint of trouble came to me from this, because of it\n\nUlysses was always frightening me with new accusations,\n\nspreading veiled rumours among the people, and guiltily\n\nseeking to defend himself. He would not rest till, with Calchas\n\nas his instrument — but why I do unfold this unwelcome story?\n\nWhy hinder you? If you consider all Greeks the same,\n\nand that's sufficient, take your vengeance now: that's what\n\nthe Ithacan wants, and the sons of Atreus would pay dearly for.'\n\nThen indeed we were on fire to ask, and seek the cause,\n\nignorant of such wickedness and Pelasgian trickery.\n\nTrembling with fictitious feelings he continued, saying:\n\n'The Greeks, weary with the long war, often longed\n\nto leave Troy and execute a retreat: if only they had!\n\nOften a fierce storm from the sea land-locked them,\n\nand the gale terrified them from leaving:\n\nonce that horse, made of maple-beams, stood there,\n\nespecially then, storm-clouds thundered in the sky.\n\nAnxious, we send Eurypylus to consult Phoebus's oracle,\n\nand he brings back these dark words from the sanctuary:\n\n'With blood, and a virgin sacrifice, you calmed the winds,\n\nO Greeks, when you first came to these Trojan shores, seek your\n\nreturn in blood, and the well-omened sacrifice of an Argive life.'\n\nWhen this reached the ears of the crowd, their minds were stunned,\n\nand an icy shudder ran to their deepest marrow:\n\nwho readies this fate, whom does Apollo choose?\n\nAt this the Ithacan thrust the seer, Calchas, into their midst,\n\ndemanding to know what the god's will might be,\n\namong the uproar. Many were already cruelly prophesying\n\nthat ingenious man's wickedness towards me, and silently saw\n\nwhat was coming. For ten days the seer kept silence, refusing\n\nto reveal the secret by his words, or condemn anyone to death.\n\nBut at last, urged on by Ulysses's loud clamour, he broke\n\ninto speech as agreed, and doomed me to the altar.\n\nAll acclaimed it, and what each feared himself, they endured\n\nwhen directed, alas, towards one man's destruction.\n\nNow the terrible day arrived, the rites were being prepared\n\nfor me, the salted grain, and the headbands for my forehead.\n\nI confess I saved myself from death, burst my bonds,\n\nand all that night hid by a muddy lake among the reeds,\n\ntill they set sail, if as it happened they did.\n\nAnd now I've no hope of seeing my old country again,\n\nor my sweet children or the father I long for:\n\nperhaps they'll seek to punish them for my flight,\n\nand avenge my crime through the death of these unfortunates.\n\nBut I beg you, by the gods, by divine power that knows the truth,\n\nby whatever honour anywhere remains pure among men, have pity\n\non such troubles, pity the soul that endures undeserved suffering.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.145 With these tears we grant him his life, and also pity him.\n\nPriam himself is the first to order his manacles and tight bonds\n\nremoved, and speaks these words of kindness to him:\n\n'From now on, whoever you are, forget the Greeks, lost to you:\n\nyou'll be one of us. And explain to me truly what I ask:\n\nWhy have they built this huge hulk of a horse? Who created it?\n\nWhat do they aim at? What religious object or war machine is it?'\n\nHe spoke: the other, schooled in Pelasgian art and trickery,\n\nraised his unbound palms towards the stars, saying:\n\n'You, eternal fires, in your invulnerable power, be witness,\n\nyou altars and impious swords I escaped,\n\nyou sacrificial ribbons of the gods that I wore as victim:\n\nwith right I break the Greek's solemn oaths,\n\nwith right I hate them, and if things are hidden\n\nbring them to light: I'm bound by no laws of their country.\n\nOnly, Troy, maintain your assurances, if I speak truth, if I repay\n\nyou handsomely: kept intact yourself, keep your promises intact.\n\nAll the hopes of the Greeks and their confidence to begin the war\n\nalways depended on Pallas's aid. But from that moment\n\nwhen the impious son of Tydeus, Diomedes, and Ulysses\n\ninventor of wickedness, approached the fateful Palladium to snatch\n\nit from its sacred temple, killing the guards on the citadel's heights,\n\nand dared to seize the holy statue, and touch the sacred ribbons\n\nof the goddess with blood-soaked hands: from that moment\n\nthe hopes of the Greeks receded, and slipping backwards ebbed:\n\ntheir power fragmented, and the mind of the goddess opposed them.\n\nPallas gave sign of this, and not with dubious portents,\n\nfor scarcely was the statue set up in camp, when glittering flames\n\nshone from the upturned eyes, a salt sweat ran over its limbs,\n\nand (wonderful to tell) she herself darted from the ground\n\nwith shield on her arm, and spear quivering.\n\nCalchas immediately proclaimed that the flight by sea must be\n\nattempted, and that Troy cannot be uprooted by Argive weapons,\n\nunless they renew the omens at Argos, and take the goddess home,\n\nwhom they have indeed taken by sea in their curved ships.\n\nAnd now they are heading for their native Mycenae with the wind,\n\nobtaining weapons and the friendship of the gods, re-crossing\n\nthe sea to arrive unexpectedly, So Calchas reads the omens.\n\nWarned by him, they've set up this statue of a horse\n\nfor the wounded goddess, instead of the Palladium,\n\nto atone severely for their sin. And Calchas ordered them\n\nto raise the huge mass of woven timbers, raised to the sky,\n\nso the gates would not take it, nor could it be dragged\n\ninside the walls, or watch over the people in their ancient rites.\n\nSince if your hands violated Minerva's gift,\n\nthen utter ruin (may the gods first turn that prediction\n\non themselves!) would come to Priam and the Trojans:\n\nyet if it ascended into your citadel, dragged by your hands,\n\nAsia would come to the very walls of Pelops, in mighty war,\n\nand a like fate would await our children.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.195 Through these tricks and the skill of perjured Sinon, the thing was\n\ncredited, and we were trapped, by his wiliness, and false tears,\n\nwe, who were not conquered by Diomedes, or Larissan Achilles,\n\nnor by the ten years of war, nor those thousand ships.\n\nThen something greater and more terrible befalls\n\nus wretches, and stirs our unsuspecting souls.\n\nLaocoon, chosen by lot as priest of Neptune,\n\nwas sacrificing a huge bull at the customary altar.\n\nSee, a pair of serpents with huge coils, snaking over the sea\n\nfrom Tenedos through the tranquil deep (I shudder to tell it),\n\nand heading for the shore side by side: their fronts lift high\n\nover the tide, and their blood-red crests top the waves,\n\nthe rest of their body slides through the ocean behind,\n\nand their huge backs arch in voluminous folds.\n\nThere's a roar from the foaming sea: now they reach the shore,\n\nand with burning eyes suffused with blood and fire,\n\nlick at their hissing jaws with flickering tongues.\n\nBlanching at the sight we scatter. They move\n\non a set course towards Laocoon: and first each serpent\n\nentwines the slender bodies of his two sons,\n\nand biting at them, devours their wretched limbs:\n\nthen as he comes to their aid, weapons in hand, they seize him too,\n\nand wreathe him in massive coils: now encircling his waist twice,\n\ntwice winding their scaly folds around his throat,\n\ntheir high necks and heads tower above him.\n\nHe strains to burst the knots with his hands,\n\nhis sacred headband drenched in blood and dark venom,\n\nwhile he sends terrible shouts up to the heavens,\n\nlike the bellowing of a bull that has fled wounded,\n\nfrom the altar, shaking the useless axe from its neck.\n\nBut the serpent pair escape, slithering away to the high temple,\n\nand seek the stronghold of fierce Pallas, to hide there\n\nunder the goddess's feet, and the circle of her shield.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.228 Then in truth a strange terror steals through each shuddering heart,\n\nand they say that Laocoon has justly suffered for his crime\n\nin wounding the sacred oak-tree with his spear,\n\nby hurling its wicked shaft into the trunk.\n\n'Pull the statue to her house', they shout,\n\n'and offer prayers to the goddess's divinity.'\n\nWe breached the wall, and opened up the defences of the city.\n\nAll prepare themselves for the work and they set up wheels\n\nallowing movement under its feet, and stretch hemp ropes\n\nround its neck. That engine of fate mounts our walls\n\npregnant with armed men. Around it boys, and virgin girls,\n\nsing sacred songs, and delight in touching their hands to the ropes:\n\nUp it glides and rolls threateningly into the midst of the city.\n\nO my country, O Ilium house of the gods, and you,\n\nTrojan walls famous in war! Four times it sticks at the threshold\n\nof the gates, and four times the weapons clash in its belly:\n\nyet we press on regardless, blind with frenzy,\n\nand site the accursed creature on top of our sacred citadel.\n\nEven then Cassandra, who, by the god's decree, is never\n\nto be believed by Trojans, reveals our future fate with her lips.\n\nWe unfortunate ones, for whom that day is our last,\n\nclothe the gods' temples, throughout the city, with festive branches.\n\nMeanwhile the heavens turn, and night rushes from the Ocean,\n\nwrapping the earth, and sky, and the Myrmidons' tricks,\n\nin its vast shadow: through the city the Trojans\n\nfall silent: sleep enfolds their weary limbs.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.254 And now the Greek phalanx of battle-ready ships sailed\n\nfrom Tenedos, in the benign stillness of the silent moon,\n\nseeking the known shore, when the royal galley raised\n\na torch, and Sinon, protected by the gods' unjust doom,\n\nsets free the Greeks imprisoned by planks of pine,\n\nin the horses' belly. Opened, it releases them to the air,\n\nand sliding down a lowered rope, Thessandrus, and Sthenelus,\n\nthe leaders, and fatal Ulysses, emerge joyfully\n\nfrom their wooden cave, with Acamas, Thoas,\n\nPeleus's son Neoptolemus, the noble Machaon,\n\nMenelaus, and Epeus who himself devised this trick.\n\nThey invade the city that's drowned in sleep and wine,\n\nkill the watchmen, welcome their comrades\n\nat the open gates, and link their clandestine ranks.\n\nIt was the hour when first sleep begins for weary mortals,\n\nand steals over them as the sweetest gift of the gods.\n\nSee, in dream, before my eyes, Hector seemed to stand there,\n\nsaddest of all and pouring out great tears,\n\ntorn by the chariot, as once he was, black with bloody dust,\n\nand his swollen feet pierced by the thongs.\n\nAh, how he looked! How changed he was\n\nfrom that Hector who returned wearing Achilles's armour,\n\nor who set Trojan flames to the Greek ships! His beard was ragged,\n\nhis hair matted with blood, bearing those many wounds he received\n\ndragged around the walls of his city.\n\nAnd I seemed to weep myself, calling out to him,\n\nand speaking to him in words of sorrow:\n\n'Oh light of the Troad, surest hope of the Trojans,\n\nwhat has so delayed you? What shore do you come from\n\nHector, the long-awaited? Weary from the many troubles\n\nof our people and our city I see you, oh, after the death\n\nof so many of your kin! What shameful events have marred\n\nthat clear face? And why do I see these wounds?'\n\nHe does not reply, nor does he wait on my idle questions,\n\nbut dragging heavy sighs from the depths of his heart, he says:\n\n'Ah! Son of the goddess, fly, tear yourself from the flames.\n\nThe enemy has taken the walls: Troy falls from her high place.\n\nEnough has been given to Priam and your country: if Pergama\n\ncould be saved by any hand, it would have been saved by this.\n\nTroy entrusts her sacred relics and household gods to you:\n\ntake them as friends of your fate, seek mighty walls for them,\n\nthose you will found at last when you have wandered the seas.'\n\nSo he speaks, and brings the sacred headbands in his hands\n\nfrom the innermost shrine, potent Vesta, and the undying flame.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.298 Meanwhile the city is confused with grief, on every side,\n\nand though my father Anchises's house is remote, secluded\n\nand hidden by trees, the sounds grow clearer and clearer,\n\nand the terror of war sweeps upon it.\n\nI shake off sleep, and climb to the highest roof-top,\n\nand stand there with ears strained:\n\nas when fire attacks a wheat-field when the south-wind rages,\n\nor the rushing torrent from a mountain stream covers the fields,\n\ndrowns the ripe crops, the labour of oxen,\n\nand brings down the trees headlong, and the dazed shepherd,\n\nunaware, hears the echo from a high rocky peak.\n\nNow the truth is obvious, and the Greek plot revealed.\n\nNow the vast hall of Deiphobus is given to ruin\n\nthe fire over it: now Ucalegon's nearby blazes:\n\nthe wide Sigean straits throw back the glare.\n\nThen the clamour of men and the blare of trumpets rises.\n\nFrantically I seize weapons: not because there is much use\n\nfor weapons, but my spirit burns to gather men for battle\n\nand race to the citadel with my friends: madness and anger\n\nhurl my mind headlong, and I think it beautiful to die fighting.\n\nNow, see, Panthus escaping the Greek spears,\n\nPanthus, son of Othrys, Apollo's priest on the citadel,\n\ndragging along with his own hands the sacred relics,\n\nthe conquered gods, his little grandchild, running frantically\n\nto my door: 'Where's the best advantage, Panthus, what position\n\nshould we take?' I'd barely spoken, when he answered\n\nwith a groan: 'The last day comes, Troy's inescapable hour.\n\nTroy is past, Ilium is past, and the great glory of the Trojans:\n\nJupiter carries all to Argos: the Greeks are lords of the burning city.\n\nThe horse, standing high on the ramparts, pours out warriors,\n\nand Sinon the conqueror exultantly stirs the flames.\n\nOthers are at the wide-open gates, as many thousands\n\nas ever came from great Mycenae: more have blocked\n\nthe narrow streets with hostile weapons:\n\na line of standing steel with naked flickering blades\n\nis ready for the slaughter: barely the first few guards\n\nat the gates attempt to fight, and they resist in blind conflict.'\n\nBy these words from Othrys' son, and divine will, I'm thrust\n\namongst the weapons and the flames, where the dismal Fury\n\nsounds, and the roar, and the clamour rising to the sky.\n\nFriends joined me, visible in the moonlight, Ripheus,\n\nand Epytus, mighty in battle, Hypanis and Dymas,\n\ngathered to my side, and young Coroebus, Mygdon's son:\n\nby chance he'd arrived in Troy at that time,\n\nburning with mad love for Cassandra, and brought help,\n\nas a potential son-in-law, to Priam, and the Trojans,\n\nunlucky man, who didn't listen to the prophecy\n\nof his frenzied bride! When I saw them crowded there\n\neager for battle, I began as follows: 'Warriors, bravest\n\nof frustrated spirits, if your ardent desire is fixed\n\non following me to the end, you can see our cause's fate.\n\nAll the gods by whom this empire was supported\n\nhave departed, leaving behind their temples and their altars:\n\nyou aid a burning city: let us die and rush into battle.\n\nThe beaten have one refuge, to have no hope of refuge.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.355 So their young spirits were roused to fury. Then, like ravaging\n\nwolves in a dark mist, driven blindly by the cruel rage\n\nof their bellies, leaving their young waiting with thirsty jaws,\n\nwe pass through our enemies, to certain death, and make our way\n\nto the heart of the city: dark night envelops us in deep shadow.\n\nWho could tell of that destruction in words, or equal our pain\n\nwith tears? The ancient city falls, she who ruled for so many years:\n\ncrowds of dead bodies lie here and there in the streets,\n\namong the houses, and on the sacred thresholds of the gods.\n\nNor is it Trojans alone who pay the penalty with their blood:\n\ncourage returns at times to the hearts of the defeated\n\nand the Greek conquerors die. Cruel mourning is everywhere,\n\neverywhere there is panic, and many a form of death.\n\nFirst, Androgeos, meets us, with a great crowd of Greeks\n\naround him, unknowingly thinking us allied troops,\n\nand calls to us in friendly speech as well:\n\n'Hurry, men! What sluggishness makes you delay so?\n\nThe others are raping and plundering burning Troy:\n\nare you only now arriving from the tall ships?'\n\nHe spoke, and straight away (since no reply given was\n\ncredible enough) he knew he'd fallen into the enemy fold.\n\nHe was stunned, drew back, and stifled his voice.\n\nLike a man who unexpectedly treads on a snake in rough briars,\n\nas he strides over the ground, and shrinks back in sudden fear\n\nas it rears in anger and swells its dark-green neck,\n\nso Androgeos, shuddering at the sight of us, drew back.\n\nWe charge forward and surround them closely with weapons,\n\nand ignorant of the place, seized by terror, as they are, we slaughter\n\nthem wholesale. Fortune favours our first efforts.\n\nAnd at this Coroebus, exultant with courage and success, cries:\n\n'Oh my friends, where fortune first points out the path to safety,\n\nand shows herself a friend, let us follow. Let's change our shields\n\nadopt Greek emblems. Courage or deceit: who'll question it in war?\n\nThey'll arm us themselves.' With these words, he takes up Androgeos's\n\nplumed helmet, his shield with its noble markings,\n\nand straps the Greek's sword to his side. Ripheus does likewise,\n\nDymas too, and all the warriors delight in it. Each man\n\narms himself with the fresh spoils. We pass on\n\nmingling with the Greeks, with gods that are not our known,\n\nand clash, in many an armed encounter, in the blind night,\n\nand we send many a Greek down to Orcus.\n\nSome scatter to the ships, and run for safer shores,\n\nsome, in humiliated terror, climb the vast horse again\n\nand hide in the womb they know.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.402 'Ah, put no faith in anything the will of the gods opposes!\n\nSee, Priam's virgin daughter dragged, with streaming hair,\n\nfrom the sanctuary and temple of Minerva,\n\nlifting her burning eyes to heaven in vain:\n\nher eyes, since cords restrained her gentle hands.\n\nCoroebus could not stand the sight, maddened in mind,\n\nand hurled himself among the ranks, seeking death.\n\nWe follow him, and, weapons locked, charge together.\n\nHere, at first, we were overwhelmed by Trojan spears,\n\nhurled from the high summit of the temple,\n\nand wretched slaughter was caused by the look of our armour,\n\nand the confusion arising from our Greek crests.\n\nThen the Danaans, gathering from all sides, groaning with anger\n\nat the girl being pulled away from them, rush us,\n\nAjax the fiercest, the two Atrides, all the Greek host:\n\njust as, at the onset of a tempest, conflicting winds clash, the west,\n\nthe south, and the east that joys in the horses of dawn:\n\nthe forest roars, brine-wet Nereus rages with his trident,\n\nand stirs the waters from their lowest depths.\n\nEven those we have scattered by a ruse, in the dark of night,\n\nand driven right through the city, re-appear: for the first time\n\nthey recognise our shields and deceitful weapons,\n\nand realise our speech differs in sound to theirs.\n\nIn a moment we're overwhelmed by weight of numbers:\n\nfirst Coroebus falls, by the armed goddess's altar, at the hands\n\nof Peneleus: and Ripheus, who was the most just of all the Trojans,\n\nand keenest for what was right (the gods' vision was otherwise):\n\nHypanis and Dymas die at the hands of allies:\n\nand your great piety, Panthus, and Apollo's sacred headband\n\ncan not defend you in your downfall.\n\nAshes of Ilium, death flames of my people, be witness\n\nthat, at your ruin, I did not evade the Danaan weapons,\n\nnor the risks, and, if it had been my fate to die,\n\nI earned it with my sword. Then we are separated,\n\nIphitus and Pelias with me, Iphitus weighed down by the years,\n\nand Pelias, slow-footed, wounded by Ulysses:\n\nimmediately we're summoned to Priam's palace by the clamour.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.438 Here's a great battle indeed, as if the rest of the war were nothing,\n\nas if others were not dying throughout the whole city,\n\nso we see wild War and the Greeks rushing to the palace,\n\nand the entrance filled with a press of shields.\n\nLadders cling to the walls: men climb the stairs under the very\n\ndoorposts, with their left hands holding defensive shields\n\nagainst the spears, grasping the sloping stone with their right.\n\nIn turn, the Trojans pull down the turrets and roof-tiles\n\nof the halls, prepared to defend themselves even in death,\n\nseeing the end near them, with these as weapons:\n\nand send the gilded roof-beams down, the glory\n\nof their ancient fathers. Others with naked swords block\n\nthe inner doors: these they defend in massed ranks.\n\nOur spirits were reinspired, to bring help to the king's palace,\n\nto relieve our warriors with our aid, and add power to the beaten.\n\nThere was an entrance with hidden doors, and a passage in use\n\nbetween Priam's halls, and a secluded gateway beyond,\n\nwhich the unfortunate Andromache, while the kingdom stood,\n\noften used to traverse, going, unattended, to her husband's parents,\n\ntaking the little Astyanax to his grandfather.\n\nI reached the topmost heights of the pediment from which\n\nthe wretched Trojans were hurling their missiles in vain.\n\nA turret standing on the sloping edge, and rising from the roof\n\nto the sky, was one from which all Troy could be seen,\n\nthe Danaan ships, and the Greek camp: and attacking its edges\n\nwith our swords, where the upper levels offered weaker mortar,\n\nwe wrenched it from its high place, and sent it flying:\n\nfalling suddenly it dragged all to ruin with a roar,\n\nand shattered far and wide over the Greek ranks.\n\nBut more arrived, and meanwhile neither the stones\n\nnor any of the various missiles ceased to fly.\n\nIn front of the courtyard itself, in the very doorway of the palace,\n\nPyrrhus exults, glittering with the sheen of bronze:\n\nlike a snake, fed on poisonous herbs, in the light,\n\nthat cold winter has held, swollen, under the ground,\n\nand now, gleaming with youth, its skin sloughed,\n\nripples its slimy back, lifts its front high towards the sun,\n\nand darts its triple-forked tongue from its jaws.\n\nHuge Periphas, and Automedon the armour-bearer,\n\ndriver of Achilles's team, and all the Scyrian youths,\n\nadvance on the palace together and hurl firebrands onto the roof.\n\nPyrrhus himself among the front ranks, clutching a double-axe,\n\nbreaks through the stubborn gate, and pulls the bronze doors\n\nfrom their hinges: and now, hewing out the timber, he breaches\n\nthe solid oak and opens a huge window with a gaping mouth.\n\nThe palace within appears, and the long halls are revealed:\n\nthe inner sanctums of Priam, and the ancient kings, appear,\n\nand armed men are seen standing on the very threshold.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.486 But, inside the palace, groans mingle with sad confusion,\n\nand, deep within, the hollow halls howl\n\nwith women's cries: the clamour strikes the golden stars.\n\nTrembling mothers wander the vast building, clasping\n\nthe doorposts, and placing kisses on them. Pyrrhus drives forward,\n\nwith his father Achilles's strength, no barricades nor the guards\n\nthemselves can stop him: the door collapses under the ram's blows,\n\nand the posts collapse, wrenched from their sockets.\n\nStrength makes a road: the Greeks, pour through, force a passage,\n\nslaughter the front ranks, and fill the wide space with their men.\n\nA foaming river is not so furious, when it floods,\n\nbursting its banks, overwhelms the barriers against it,\n\nand rages in a mass through the fields, sweeping cattle and stables\n\nacross the whole plain. I saw Pyrrhus myself, on the threshold,\n\nmad with slaughter, and the two sons of Atreus:\n\nI saw Hecuba, her hundred women, and Priam at the altars,\n\npolluting with blood the flames that he himself had sanctified.\n\nThose fifty chambers, the promise of so many offspring,\n\nthe doorposts, rich with spoils of barbarian gold,\n\ncrash down: the Greeks possess what the fire spares.\n\nAnd maybe you ask, what was Priam's fate.\n\nWhen he saw the end of the captive city, the palace doors\n\nwrenched away, and the enemy among the inner rooms,\n\nthe aged man clasped his long-neglected armour\n\non his old, trembling shoulders, and fastened on his useless sword,\n\nand hurried into the thick of the enemy seeking death.\n\nIn the centre of the halls, and under the sky's naked arch,\n\nwas a large altar, with an ancient laurel nearby, that leant\n\non the altar, and clothed the household gods with shade.\n\nHere Hecuba, and her daughters, like doves driven\n\nby a dark storm, crouched uselessly by the shrines,\n\nhuddled together, clutching at the statues of the gods.\n\nAnd when she saw Priam himself dressed in youthful armour\n\nshe cried: 'What mad thought, poor husband, urges you\n\nto fasten on these weapons? Where do you run?\n\nThe hour demands no such help, nor defences such as these,\n\nnot if my own Hector were here himself. Here, I beg you,\n\nthis altar will protect us all or we'll die together.'\n\nSo she spoke and drew the old man towards her,\n\nand set him down on the sacred steps.\n\nSee, Polites, one of Priam's sons, escaping Pyrrhus's slaughter,\n\nruns down the long hallways, through enemies and spears,\n\nand, wounded, crosses the empty courts.\n\nPyrrhus chases after him, eager to strike him,\n\nand grasps at him now, and now, with his hand, at spear-point.\n\nWhen finally he reached the eyes and gaze of his parents,\n\nhe fell, and poured out his life in a river of blood.\n\nPriam, though even now in death's clutches,\n\ndid not spare his voice at this, or hold back his anger:\n\n'If there is any justice in heaven, that cares about such things,\n\nmay the gods repay you with fit thanks, and due reward\n\nfor your wickedness, for such acts, you who have\n\nmade me see my own son's death in front of my face,\n\nand defiled a father's sight with murder.\n\nYet Achilles, whose son you falsely claim to be, was no\n\nsuch enemy to Priam: he respected the suppliant's rights,\n\nand honour, and returned Hector's bloodless corpse\n\nto its sepulchre, and sent me home to my kingdom.'\n\nSo the old man spoke, and threw his ineffectual spear\n\nwithout strength, which immediately spun from the clanging bronze\n\nand hung uselessly from the centre of the shield's boss.\n\nPyrrhus spoke to him: 'Then you can be messenger, carry\n\nthe news to my father, to Peleus's son: remember to tell him\n\nof degenerate Pyrrhus, and of my sad actions:\n\nnow die.' Saying this he dragged him, trembling,\n\nand slithering in the pool of his son's blood, to the very altar,\n\nand twined his left hand in his hair, raised the glittering sword\n\nin his right, and buried it to the hilt in his side.\n\nThis was the end of Priam's life: this was the death that fell to him\n\nby lot, seeing Troy ablaze and its citadel toppled, he who was\n\nonce the magnificent ruler of so many Asian lands and peoples.\n\nA once mighty body lies on the shore, the head\n\nshorn from its shoulders, a corpse without a name.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.559 Then for the first time a wild terror gripped me.\n\nI stood amazed: my dear father's image rose before me\n\nas I saw a king, of like age, with a cruel wound,\n\nbreathing his life away: and my Creusa, forlorn,\n\nand the ransacked house, and the fate of little Iulus.\n\nI looked back, and considered the troops that were round me.\n\nThey had all left me, wearied, and hurled their bodies to earth,\n\nor sick with misery dropped into the flames.\n\nSo I was alone now, when I saw the daughter of Tyndareus,\n\nHelen, close to Vesta's portal, hiding silently\n\nin the secret shrine: the bright flames gave me light,\n\nas I wandered, gazing everywhere, randomly.\n\nAfraid of Trojans angered at the fall of Troy,\n\nGreek vengeance, and the fury of a husband she deserted,\n\nshe, the mutual curse of Troy and her own country,\n\nhad concealed herself and crouched, a hated thing, by the altars.\n\nFire blazed in my spirit: anger rose to avenge my fallen land,\n\nand to exact the punishment for her wickedness.\n\n'Shall she, unharmed, see Sparta again and her native Mycenae,\n\nand see her house and husband, parents and children,\n\nand go in the triumphant role of a queen,\n\nattended by a crowd of Trojan women and Phrygian servants?\n\nWhen Priam has been put to the sword? Troy consumed with fire?\n\nThe Dardanian shore soaked again and again with blood?\n\nNo. Though there's no great glory in a woman's punishment,\n\nand such a conquest wins no praise, still I will be praised\n\nfor extinguishing wickedness and exacting well-earned\n\npunishment, and I'll delight in having filled my soul\n\nwith the flame of revenge, and appeased my people's ashes.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.588 I blurted out these words, and was rushing on with raging mind,\n\nwhen my dear mother came to my vision, never before so bright\n\nto my eyes, shining with pure light in the night,\n\ngoddess for sure, such as she may be seen by the gods,\n\nand taking me by the right hand, stopped me, and, then,\n\nimparted these words to me from her rose-tinted lips:\n\n'My son, what pain stirs such uncontrollable anger?\n\nWhy this rage? Where has your care for what is ours vanished?\n\nFirst will you not see whether Creusa, your wife, and your child\n\nAscanius still live, and where you have left your father Anchises\n\nworn-out with age? The Greek ranks surround them on all sides,\n\nand if my love did not protect them, the flames would have caught\n\nthem before now, and the enemy swords drunk of their blood.\n\nYou do not hate the face of the Spartan daughter of Tyndareus,\n\nnor is Paris to blame: the ruthlessness of the gods, of the gods,\n\nbrought down this power, and toppled Troy from its heights.\n\nSee (for I'll tear away all the mist that now, shrouding your sight,\n\ndims your mortal vision, and darkens everything with moisture:\n\ndon't be afraid of what your mother commands, or refuse to obey\n\nher wisdom): here, where you see shattered heaps of stone\n\ntorn from stone, and smoke billowing mixed with dust,\n\nNeptune is shaking the walls, and the foundations, stirred\n\nby his mighty trident, and tearing the whole city up by it roots.\n\nThere, Juno, the fiercest, is first to take the Scaean Gate, and,\n\nsword at her side, calls on her troops from the ships, in rage.\n\nNow, see, Tritonian Pallas, standing on the highest towers,\n\nsending lightning from the storm-cloud, and her grim Gorgon\n\nbreastplate. Father Jupiter himself supplies the Greeks with\n\ncourage, and fortunate strength, himself excites the gods against\n\nthe Trojan army. Hurry your departure, son, and put an end\n\nto your efforts. I will not leave you, and I will place you\n\nsafe at your father's door.' She spoke, and hid herself\n\nin the dense shadows of night. Dreadful shapes appeared,\n\nand the vast powers of gods opposed to Troy.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.624 Then in truth all Ilium seemed to me to sink in flames,\n\nand Neptune's Troy was toppled from her base:\n\njust as when foresters on the mountain heights\n\ncompete to uproot an ancient ash tree, struck\n\ntime and again by axe and blade, it threatens continually\n\nto fall, with trembling foliage and shivering crown,\n\ntill gradually vanquished by the blows it groans at last,\n\nand torn from the ridge, crashes down in ruin.\n\nI descend, and, led by a goddess, am freed from flames\n\nand enemies: the spears give way, and the flames recede.\n\nAnd now, when I reached the threshold of my father's house,\n\nand my former home, my father, whom it was my first desire\n\nto carry into the high mountains, and whom I first sought out,\n\nrefused to extend his life or endure exile, since Troy had fallen.\n\n'Oh, you,' he cried, 'whose blood has the vigour of youth,\n\nand whose power is unimpaired in its force, it's for you\n\nto take flight. As for me, if the gods had wished to lengthen\n\nthe thread of my life, they'd have spared my house. It is\n\nmore than enough that I saw one destruction, and survived\n\none taking of the city. Depart, saying farewell to my body\n\nlying here so, yes so. I shall find death with my own hand:\n\nthe enemy will pity me, and look for plunder. The loss\n\nof my burial is nothing. Clinging to old age for so long,\n\nI am useless, and hated by the gods, ever since\n\nthe father of the gods and ruler of men breathed the winds\n\nof his lightning-bolt onto me, and touched me with fire.'\n\nSo he persisted in saying, and remained adamant.\n\nWe, on our side, Creusa, my wife, and Ascanius, all our household,\n\nweeping bitterly, determined that he should not destroy everything\n\nalong with himself, and crush us by urging our doom.\n\nHe refused and clung to his place and his purpose.\n\nI hurried to my weapons again, and, miserably, longed for death,\n\nsince what tactic or opportunity was open to us now?\n\n' Did you think I could leave you, father, and depart?\n\nDid such sinful words fall from your lips?\n\nIf it pleases the gods to leave nothing of our great city standing,\n\nif this is set in your mind, if it delights you to add yourself\n\nand all that's yours to the ruins of Troy, the door is open\n\nto that death: soon Pyrrhus comes, drenched in Priam's blood,\n\nhe who butchers the son in front of the father, the father at the altar.\n\nKind mother, did you rescue me from fire and sword\n\nfor this, to see the enemy in the depths of my house,\n\nand Ascanius, and my father, and Creusa, slaughtered,\n\nthrown together in a heap, in one another's blood?\n\nWeapons men, bring weapons: the last day calls to the defeated.\n\nLead me to the Greeks again: let me revisit the battle anew.\n\nThis day we shall not all perish unavenged.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.671 So, again, I fasten on my sword, slip my left arm\n\ninto the shield's strap, adjust it, and rush from the house.\n\nBut see, my wife clings to the threshold, clasps my foot,\n\nand holds little Iulus up towards his father:\n\n'If you go to die, take us with you too, at all costs: but if\n\nas you've proved you trust in the weapons you wear,\n\ndefend this house first. To whom do you abandon little Iulus,\n\nand your father, and me, I who was once spoken of as your wife?'\n\nCrying out like this she filled the whole house with her groans,\n\nwhen suddenly a wonder, marvellous to speak of, occurred.\n\nSee, between the hands and faces of his grieving parents,\n\na gentle light seemed to shine from the crown\n\nof Iulus's head, and a soft flame, harmless in its touch,\n\nlicked at his hair, and grazed his forehead.\n\nTrembling with fear, we hurry to flick away the blazing strands,\n\nand extinguish the sacred fires with water.\n\nBut Anchises, my father, lifts his eyes to the heavens, in delight,\n\nand raises his hands and voice to the sky:\n\n'All-powerful Jupiter, if you're moved by any prayers,\n\nsee us, and, grant but this: if we are worthy through our virtue,\n\nshow us a sign of it, Father, and confirm your omen.'\n\nThe old man had barely spoken when, with a sudden crash,\n\nit thundered on the left, and a star, through the darkness,\n\nslid from the sky, and flew, trailing fire, in a burst of light.\n\nWe watched it glide over the highest rooftops,\n\nand bury its brightness, and the sign of its passage,\n\nin the forests of Mount Ida: then the furrow of its long track\n\ngave out a glow, and, all around, the place smoked with sulphur.\n\nAt this my father, truly overcome, raised himself towards the sky,\n\nand spoke to the gods, and proclaimed the sacred star.\n\n'Now no delay: I follow, and where you lead, there am I.\n\nGods of my fathers, save my line, save my grandson.\n\nThis omen is yours, and Troy is in your divine power.\n\nI accept, my son, and I will not refuse to go with you.'\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.705 He speaks, and now the fire is more audible,\n\nthrough the city, and the blaze rolls its tide nearer.\n\n'Come then, dear father, clasp my neck: I will\n\ncarry you on my shoulders: that task won't weigh on me.\n\nWhatever may happen, it will be for us both, the same shared risk,\n\nand the same salvation. Let little Iulus come with me,\n\nand let my wife follow our footsteps at a distance.\n\nYou servants, give your attention to what I'm saying.\n\nAt the entrance to the city there's a mound, an ancient temple\n\nof forsaken Ceres, and a venerable cypress nearby,\n\nprotected through the years by the reverence of our fathers:\n\nlet's head to that one place by diverse paths.\n\nYou, father, take the sacred objects, and our country's gods,\n\nin your hands: until I've washed in running water,\n\nit would be a sin for me, coming from such fighting\n\nand recent slaughter, to touch them.' So saying, bowing my neck,\n\nI spread a cloak made of a tawny lion's hide over my broad\n\nshoulders, and bend to the task: little Iulus clasps his hand\n\nin mine, and follows his father's longer strides.\n\nMy wife walks behind. We walk on through the shadows\n\nof places, and I whom till then no shower of spears,\n\nnor crowd of Greeks in hostile array, could move,\n\nnow I'm terrified by every breeze, and startled by every noise,\n\nanxious, and fearful equally for my companion and my burden.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.730 And now I was near the gates, and thought I had completed\n\nmy journey, when suddenly the sound of approaching feet\n\nfilled my hearing, and, peering through the darkness,\n\nmy father cried: 'My son, run my son, they are near us:\n\nI see their glittering shields and gleaming bronze.'\n\nSome hostile power, at this, scattered my muddled wits.\n\nfor while I was following alleyways, and straying\n\nfrom the region of streets we knew, did my wife Creusa halt,\n\nsnatched away from me by wretched fate?\n\nOr did she wander from the path or collapse with weariness?\n\nWho knows? She was never restored to our sight,\n\nnor did I look back for my lost one, or cast a thought behind me,\n\nuntil we came to the mound, and ancient Ceres's sacred place.\n\nHere when all were gathered together at last, one was missing,\n\nand had escaped the notice of friends, child and husband.\n\nWhat man or god did I not accuse in my madness:\n\nwhat did I know of in the city's fall crueller than this?\n\nI place Ascanius, and my father Anchises, and the gods of Troy,\n\nin my companions' care, and conceal them in a winding valley:\n\nI myself seek the city once more, and take up my shining armour.\n\nI'm determined to incur every risk again, and retrace\n\nall Troy, and once more expose my life to danger.\n\nFirst I look for the wall, and the dark threshold of the gate\n\nfrom which my path led, and I retrace the landmarks\n\nof my course in the night, scanning them with my eye.\n\nEverywhere the terror in my heart, and the silence itself,\n\ndismay me. Then I take myself homewards, in case\n\nby chance, by some chance, she has made her way there.\n\nThe Greeks have invaded, and occupied, the whole house.\n\nSuddenly eager fire, rolls over the rooftop, in the wind:\n\nthe flames take hold, the blaze rages to the heavens.\n\nI pass by and see again Priam's palace and the citadel.\n\nNow Phoenix, and fatal Ulysses, the chosen guards, watch over\n\nthe spoils, in the empty courts of Juno's sanctuary.\n\nHere the Trojan treasures are gathered from every part,\n\nripped from the blazing shrines, tables of the gods,\n\nsolid gold bowls, and plundered robes.\n\nMothers and trembling sons stand round in long ranks.\n\nI even dared to hurl my shouts through the shadows,\n\nfilling the streets with my clamour, and in my misery,\n\nredoubling my useless cries, again and again.\n\nSearching, and raging endlessly among the city roofs,\n\nthe unhappy ghost and true shadow of Creusa\n\nappeared before my eyes, in a form greater than I'd known.\n\nI was dumbfounded, my hair stood on end, and my voice\n\nstuck in my throat. Then she spoke and with these words\n\nmitigated my distress: 'Oh sweet husband, what use is it\n\nto indulge in such mad grief? This has not happened\n\nwithout the divine will: neither its laws nor the ruler\n\nof great Olympus let you take Creusa with you,\n\naway from here. Yours is long exile, you must plough\n\na vast reach of sea: and you will come to Hesperia's land,\n\nwhere Lydian Tiber flows in gentle course among the farmers'\n\nrich fields. There, happiness, kingship and a royal wife\n\nwill be yours. Banish these tears for your beloved Creusa.\n\nI, a Trojan woman, and daughter-in-law to divine Venus,\n\nshall never see the noble halls of the Dolopians,\n\nor Myrmidons, or go as slave to some Greek wife:\n\ninstead the great Mother of the Gods keeps me on this shore.\n\nNow farewell, and preserve your love for the son we share.'\n\nWhen she had spoken these words, leaving me weeping\n\nand wanting to say so many things, she faded into thin air.\n\nThree times I tried to throw my arms about her neck:\n\nthree times her form fled my hands, clasped in vain,\n\nlike the light breeze, most of all like a winged dream.\n\nSo at last when night was done, I returned to my friends.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 2.796 And here, amazed, I found that a great number of new\n\ncompanions had streamed in, women and men,\n\na crowd gathering for exile, a wretched throng.\n\nThey had come from all sides, ready, with courage and wealth,\n\nfor whatever land I wished to lead them to, across the seas.\n\nAnd now Lucifer was rising above the heights of Ida,\n\nbringing the dawn, and the Greeks held the barricaded\n\nentrances to the gates, nor was there any hope of rescue.\n\nI desisted, and, carrying my father, took to the hills.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 3.1 Book III\n\nAfter the gods had seen fit to destroy Asia's power\n\nand Priam's innocent people, and proud Ilium had fallen,\n\nand all of Neptune's Troy breathed smoke from the soil,\n\nwe were driven by the gods' prophecies to search out\n\ndistant exile, and deserted lands, and we built a fleet\n\nbelow Antandros and the peaks of Phrygian Ida, unsure\n\nwhere fate would carry us, or where we'd be allowed to settle,\n\nand we gathered our forces together. Summer had barely begun,\n\nwhen Anchises, my father, ordered us to set sail with destiny:\n\nI left my native shore with tears, the harbour and the fields\n\nwhere Troy once stood. I travelled the deep, an exile,\n\nwith my friends and my son, and the great gods of our house.\n\nFar off is a land of vast plains where Mars is worshipped\n\n(worked by the Thracians) once ruled by fierce Lycurgus,\n\na friend of Troy in the past, and with gods who were allies,\n\nwhile fortune lasted. I went there, and founded my first city\n\nnamed Aeneadae from my name, on the shore\n\nin the curving bay, beginning it despite fate's adversity.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 3.19 I was making a sacrifice to the gods, and my mother Venus,\n\nDione's daughter, with auspices for the work begun, and had killed\n\na fine bull on the shore, for the supreme king of the sky-lords.\n\nBy chance, there was a mound nearby, crowned with cornel\n\nbushes, and bristling with dense spikes of myrtle.\n\nI went near, and trying to tear up green wood from the soil\n\nto decorate the altar with leafy branches, I saw\n\na wonder, dreadful and marvellous to tell of.\n\nFrom the first bush, its broken roots torn from the ground,\n\ndrops of dark blood dripped, and stained the earth with fluid.\n\nAn icy shiver gripped my limbs, and my blood chilled with terror.\n\nAgain I went on to pluck a stubborn shoot from another,\n\nprobing the hidden cause within: and dark blood\n\nflowed from the bark of the second. Troubled greatly\n\nin spirit, I prayed to the Nymphs of the wild,\n\nand father Gradivus, who rules the Thracian fields,\n\nto look with due kindness on this vision, and lessen\n\nits significance. But when I attacked the third\n\nwith greater effort, straining with my knees against the sand\n\n(to speak or be silent?), a mournful groan was audible\n\nfrom deep in the mound, and a voice came to my ears:\n\n'Why do you wound a poor wretch, Aeneas? Spare me now\n\nin my tomb, don't stain your virtuous hands, Troy bore me,\n\nwho am no stranger to you, nor does this blood flow from\n\nsome dull block. Oh, leave this cruel land: leave this shore\n\nof greed. For I am Polydorus. Here a crop of iron spears\n\ncarpeted my transfixed corpse, and has ripened into sharp spines.'\n\nThen truly I was stunned, my mind crushed by anxious dread,\n\nmy hair stood up on end, and my voice stuck in my throat.\n\nPriam, the unfortunate, seeing the city encircled by the siege,\n\nand despairing of Trojan arms, once sent this Polydorus, secretly,\n\nwith a great weight of gold, to be raised, by the Thracian king.\n\nWhen the power of Troy was broken, and her fortunes ebbed,\n\nthe Thracian broke every divine law, to follow Agamemnon's\n\ncause, and his victorious army, murders Polydorus, and takes\n\nthe gold by force. Accursed hunger for gold, to what do you\n\nnot drive human hearts! When terror had left my bones\n\nI referred this divine vision to the people's appointed leaders,\n\nmy father above all, and asked them what they thought.\n\nAll were of one mind, to leave this wicked land, and depart\n\na place of hospitality defiled, and sail our fleet before the wind.\n\nSo we renewed the funeral rites for Polydorus, and piled\n\nthe earth high on his barrow: sad altars were raised\n\nto the Shades, with dark sacred ribbons and black cypress,\n\nthe Trojan women around, hair streaming,\n\nas is the custom: we offered foaming bowls of warm milk,\n\nand dishes of sacrificial blood, and bound the spirit\n\nto its tomb, and raised a loud shout of farewell.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 3.69 Then as soon as we've confidence in the waves, and the winds\n\ngrant us calm seas, and the soft whispering breeze calls to the deep,\n\nmy companions float the ships and crowd to the shore.\n\nWe set out from harbour, and lands and cities recede.\n\nIn the depths of the sea lies a sacred island, dearest of all\n\nto the mother of the Nereids, and Aegean Neptune,\n\nthat wandered by coasts and shores, until Apollo,\n\naffectionately, tied it to high Myconos, and Gyaros,\n\nmaking it fixed and inhabitable, scorning the storms.\n\nI sail there: it welcomes us peacefully, weary as we are,\n\nto its safe harbour. Landing, we do homage to Apollo's city.\n\nKing Anius, both king of the people and high-priest of Apollo,\n\nhis forehead crowned with the sacred headband and holy laurel,\n\nmeets us, and recognises an old friend in Anchises:\n\nwe clasp hands in greeting and enter his house.\n\nI paid homage to the god's temple of ancient stone:\n\n'Grant us a true home, Apollo, grant a weary people walls,\n\nand a race, and a city that will endure: protect this second\n\ncitadel of Troy, that survives the Greeks and pitiless Achilles.\n\nWhom should we follow? Where do you command us to go?\n\nWhere should we settle? Grant us an omen, father, to stir our hearts.\n\nI had scarcely spoken: suddenly everything seemed to tremble,\n\nthe god's thresholds and his laurel crowns, and the whole hill\n\nround us moved, and the tripod groaned as the shrine split open.\n\nHumbly we seek the earth, and a voice comes to our ears:\n\n'Enduring Trojans, the land which first bore you from its\n\nparent stock, that same shall welcome you, restored, to its\n\nfertile breast. Search out your ancient mother.\n\nThere the house of Aeneas shall rule all shores,\n\nhis children's children, and those that are born to them.'\n\nSo Phoebus spoke: and there was a great shout of joy mixed\n\nwith confusion, and all asked what walls those were, and where\n\nit is Phoebus calls the wanderers to, commanding them to return.\n\nThen my father, thinking of the records of the ancients, said:\n\n'Listen, O princes, and learn what you may hope for.\n\nCrete lies in the midst of the sea, the island of mighty Jove,\n\nwhere Mount Ida is, the cradle of our race.\n\nThey inhabit a hundred great cities, in the richest of kingdoms,\n\nfrom which our earliest ancestor, Teucer, if I remember the tale\n\nrightly, first sailed to Trojan shores, and chose a site\n\nfor his royal capital. Until then Ilium and the towers of the citadel\n\ndid not stand there: men lived in the depths of the valleys.\n\nThe Mother who inhabits Cybele is Cretan, and the cymbals\n\nof the Corybantes, and the grove of Ida: from Crete came\n\nthe faithful silence of her rites, and the yoked lions\n\ndrawing the lady's chariot. So come, and let us follow\n\nwhere the god's command may lead, let us placate\n\nthe winds, and seek out the Cretan kingdom.\n\nIt is no long journey away: if only Jupiter is with us,\n\nthe third dawn will find our fleet on the Cretan shores.'\n\nSo saying, he sacrificed the due offerings at the altars,\n\na bull to Neptune, a bull to you, glorious Apollo, a black sheep\n\nto the Storm god, a white to the auspicious Westerlies.\n\nEvent Date: -1000 LA\n\n§ 3.121 A rumour spread that Prince Idomeneus had been driven\n\nfrom his father's kingdom, and the Cretan shores were deserted,\n\nher houses emptied of enemies, and the abandoned homes\n\nwaiting for us. We left Ortygia's harbour, and sped over the sea,\n\nthreading the foaming straits thick with islands, Naxos\n\nwith its Bacchic worship in the hills, green Donysa, Olearos,\n\nsnow-white Paros, and the Cyclades, scattered over the waters.\n\nThe sailors' cries rose, as they competed in their various tasks:\n\nthe crew shouted: 'We're headed for Crete, and our ancestors.'\n\nA wind rising astern sent us on our way, and at last\n\nwe glided by the ancient shores of the Curetes.\n\nThen I worked eagerly on the walls of our chosen city, and called\n\nit Pergamum, and exhorted my people, delighting in the name,\n\nto show love for their homes, and build a covered fortress.\n\nNow the ships were usually beached on the dry sand:\n\nthe young men were busy with weddings and their fresh fields:\n\nI was deciding on laws and homesteads: suddenly,\n\nfrom some infected region of the sky, came a wretched plague,\n\ncorrupting bodies, trees, and crops, and a season of death.\n\nThey relinquished sweet life, or dragged their sick limbs\n\naround: then Sirius blazed over barren fields:\n\nthe grass withered, and the sickly harvest denied its fruits.\n\nMy father urged us to retrace the waves, and revisit\n\nthe oracle of Apollo at Delos, and beg for protection,\n\nask where the end might be to our weary fate, where he commands\n\nthat we seek help for our trouble, where to set our course.\n\nIt was night, and sleep had charge of earth's creatures:\n\nThe sacred statues of the gods, the Phrygian Penates,\n\nthat I had carried with me from Troy, out of the burning city,\n\nseemed to stand there before my eyes, as I lay in sleep,\n\nperfectly clear in the light, where the full moon\n\nstreamed through the window casements: then they spoke\n\nto me and with their words dispelled my cares:\n\n'Apollo speaks here what he would say to you, on reaching Delos,\n\nand sends us besides, as you see, to your threshold.\n\nWhen Try burned we followed you and your weapons,\n\nwe crossed the swelling seas with you on your ships,\n\nwe too shall raise your descendants yet to be, to the stars,\n\nand grant empire to your city. Build great walls for the great,\n\nand do not shrink from the long labour of exile.\n\nChange your country. These are not the shores that Delian\n\nApollo urged on you, he did not order you to settle in Crete.\n\nThere is a place the Greeks call Hesperia by name,\n\nan ancient land powerful in arms and in richness of the soil:\n\nThere the Oenotrians lived: now the rumour is that\n\na younger race has named it Italy after their leader.\n\nThat is our true home, Dardanus and father Iasius,\n\nfrom whom our race first came, sprang from there.\n\nCome, bear"
