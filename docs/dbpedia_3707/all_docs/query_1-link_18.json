        "text": "EVERY MONDAY I will continue with a new thread for the next letter! And probably post some sort of list about which 10 songs were the most popular each week.\n\nAnyway, the rules are simple, just list your top 25 songs that start with the letter “K”. You can rank them if you want, or just list them in any old order. We can have an unofficial house rule i to only list one song for each artist, just so there would be greater variety, but you don’t have to follow that if you don’t want to. It wouldn’t hurt my feelings if you found a letter with 25 different Blink-182 songs and listed them all.\n\nIf you don’t have 25 songs for a particular letter, you can just list what you have.\n\nNote that the articles “A” and “The” at the beginning of a song title can be ignored. So “A Day In The Life” would actually show up under D, not A, but Tom Petty’s “The Apartment Song” would show up under A, not T. (That song didn’t make my A list, but it’s the only “The A” song in my library.) Spotify seems to take care of this automatically when I sort by title, but I can’t speak for anything else.\n\nAlso, it’s OK if you combine two songs into one, like, for example, Brain Stew and Jaded, which was on my B list, but I didn’t repeat it on my J list (though I made a note of it at the end). Just don’t list it on two different lists. (I say this as if I’m going to comb through everybody’s list each week to see if they’ve got any repeats.)\n\nAfter the letter Z, we’ll have one final post for songs that start with numbers or any other non-alphabetic symbols.\n\nIt looks like the Bias Sorter is back up if you need a little help deciding!\n\n\"A\"\n\n\"B\"\n\n\"C\"\n\n\"D\"\n\n\"E\"\n\n\"F\"\n\n\"G\"\n\n\"H\"\n\n\"I\"\n\n\"J\"\n\nNEW RULE: For sorting purposes, please list the song followed by the artist.\n\nExample: Cease - Bad Religion\n\nThanks and have fun!\n\n@Aaron Mook if you could pin this, that would be awesome!\n\nWhoa, I had just enough to hit 25.\n\n1. Kill - Jimmy Eat World\n\n2. Konstantine - Something Corporate\n\n3. Kill Me Quickly - Thrice\n\n4. Kill The Drama - Spitalfield\n\n5. Keystoned - Punchline\n\n6. Keep Never Changing - The Movielife\n\n7. Kill The Messenger - Jack’s Mannequin\n\n8. Kintsugi Kid (Ten Years) - Fall Out Boy\n\n9. Katie W. - Fenix TX\n\n10. Keep Watch For The Mines - Dashboard Confessional\n\n11. Knew It All Along - Midtown\n\n12. Keeper - Yellowcard\n\n13. Keep Calm And Carry On - John Nolan\n\n14. Kiss Me - New Found Glory\n\n15. Knees - Hot Rod Circuit\n\n16. Kids (Keep Up) - Childish Gambino\n\n17. Killing Time - Bayside\n\n18. Kind Of Perfect - Armor For Sleep\n\n19. Keep It Flowing - The Promise Hero\n\n20. Kira Doesn’t Care About Anything, She’s A Nihilist - Day At The Fair\n\n21. Know It All - Allister\n\n22. King For A Day - Green Day\n\n22. Kings Of The Weekend - blink-182\n\n23. Kiss Me, Diss Me - Home Grown\n\n24. King Caesar - Head Automatica\n\n25. Knives - The Dangerous Summer\n\nEDIT: How did I miss Green Day’s Know Your Enemy? I’ll take that over King For A Day. I would move it to the 10th spot, I guess."
