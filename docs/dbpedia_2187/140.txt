The Peggy Lee Bio-Discography:

A Gallery Of Christmas Compilations

Featuring Lee Tracks

by Iv√°n Santiago

Scope And Contents

Peggy Lee's catalogue of Christmas recordings consists of about 24 masters, half of them released as part of the 1960 Capitol album Christmas Carousel. The other half can be found unevenly distributed over various labels (Okeh, Decca, Capitol, MusicMasters) and ranges chronologically from early (1941) to late (1990) in her career. Then there are Lee's radio broadcasts, from which an additional dozen Christmas performances can be culled. The present page does not go into further detail about her holiday-themed masters and broadcasts, however, but concentrates instead on profiling the various-artists compilations to which Lee's master recordings have been incorporated.

Through their continuous release on mostly budget issues and reissues, the holiday catalogue of artists of Lee's vintage (from Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby to Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra) has been heavily put to use by the record companies. Herein, preponderance has naturally been given to anthologies from Capitol-Emi (the company for which Lee recorded the largest amount of holiday material), its affiliates and licensees. Such material receives coverage in sections I through VI below. (I should reiterate that the page's target is the world of various-artists compilations, not the realm of Lee-only anthologies. For details about the latter, consult the section dedicated to Christmas Carousel in the gallery of original Capitol albums.)

Beginning with section VII, this gallery moves on from Capitol-Emi and its affiliates to a variety of retailers that have commissioned holiday-themed compilations: specifically, Old Navy, Pottery Barn, Starbucks, Target, True Value, Williams Sonoma and a few miscellaneous others. (The section of miscellanea has its share of compilations which feature Lee's non-Capitol holiday numbers.) Throughout the page, my general approach has been to provide a sizable sample from each of these companies' catalogue. Completeness has not been a goal, however. Hence additional qualifying compilations could certainly be found and added. I hope, however, that those included will be enough to satiate the curiosity of fellow fans.

Following in the footsteps of other pages of The Peggy Lee Bio-Discography, this annotated gallery aspires to serve as a repository of not only Lee-centric data but also music business minutia of potential interest to collectors and students of vintage popular music. Since my final proofreading of the page will not happen until after the rest of the discography is finished (i.e., not any time soon), I will gladly welcome corrections, suggestions for improvement, and requests for additions to the gallery.

I. American Christmas Compilations (From Capitol-EMI, Its Branches And Licensees)

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Happy Holly Days, Album 2 / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6698 / Rel. Year: 1970 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "The Star Carol." Second volume of a series. There is no Peggy Lee track in the first volume of this series.

2. Title: Happy Holly Days, Album 3 / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6761 / Rel. Year: 1971 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's version of "The Christmas Waltz." Last volume of this series. (Lest confusion arises, I should stress that the series in question is called Happy Holly Days, not Happy Holidays.)

3. Title: Zenith Presents Christmas, A Gift Of Music, Volume 4 / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6687 / Rel. Year: 1970 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "White Christmas." This item (Sl 6687) exists in at least three editions. The same catalogue number and the same tracks are found in two of the editions (this one and #6 below). The third edition has the same catalogue number and includes the exact same tracks, but it uses an entirely different title, Season's Greetings From American Airlines. (That third item is also pictured below.)

Artwork Shown:

4. Title: Christmas America; A Musical & Pictorial Souvenir Of Christmas In The United States Of America / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Slao 6666 / Rel. Year: 1970 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." See also below, item #12 (Christmas America; A Musical Souvenir Of Christmas In The United States Of America).

5. Title: The Christmas Sound Of Music / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 6996 / Rel. Year: 1975 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)."

6. Title: Christmas, A Gift Of Music / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 6687 / Rel. Year: unknown / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "White Christmas." This item (Sl 6687) exists in at least three editions, each with it own front cover artwork. Two of the editions (items #3 and #6 herein) use the same catalogue number and the same tracks. The third edition (to be shown below) uses the same catalogue number and includes the exact same tracks, too, but has a different title (Season's Greetings From American Airlines).

Artwork Shown:

7. Title: "The Spirit Of Christmas" / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6516 / Rel. Year: 1966 / Note: I believe that Sl 6516 was just the third album to ever be released under the Capitol Creative Products logo. (For further specifics, consult Appendix A near the bottom of the Capitol LPs page.) It was also the first Creative Products album to include any Peggy Lee track(s); her numbers are "Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer" and "The Star Carol." Like Lee, all the other artists are featured twice (once per side, in the same track position on both sides), except for Bing Crosby (side 1) and The Roger Wagner Chorale (side 2), who are featured once.

8. Title: Zenith Presents Christmas, A Gift Of Music (Volume 1) / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6544 / Rel. Year: 1967 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." As can be seen, this album's front cover artwork is very similar to the preceding item's, and almost identical to the succeeding item. it also shares the same tracks with the next item, but not the same catalogue number, nor the title. On another note, I should point out that this is the second album from the Zenith Presents Christmas, A Gift Of Music featured here; the first is pictured near the top of the page. I believe that Zenith commissioned a total of six Christmas, A Gift Of Music volumes, which were released on an annual basis, from 1967 to 1972. Capitol Creative Products is credited with preparing three of them (the first, third, and fourth volumes). Columbia Special Products is credited with two of the other volumes. The sixth, last volume was put together by the Longines Symphonette Society in conjunction with MCA Special Products, and is the only one that bears a sub-title, The Christmas Hit Parade. (Vocals by Peggy Lee appear only in the first and fourth of these volumes.)

9. Title: Christmas, The Season Of Music / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6589 / Rel. Year: 1968 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." Exists in two other editions, one of them being the preceding entry. The other edition has the same tracks and catalogue number, but a different title (From Under The Christmas Tree) and different artwork (yellow cover, pictured further down in this section).

10. Title: The Magic Of Christmas; Christmas Songs And Carols America Loves Best / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sm 8321 / Rel. Year: 1982 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "White Christmas." Commissioned by Realistic.

11. Title: Christmas With The Stars / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 6931 / Rel. Year: 1973 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." It is worth noting that there are also numerous EMI CDs titled Christmas With The Stars -- most of them produced in Great Britain, some of them profiled in this page's section for foreign releases.

12. Title: Christmas America; A Musical Souvenir Of Christmas In The United States Of America / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sm 6884 / Rel. Year: 1973 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." This album (made for the Firestone car tire company) is a re-conceptualization of item #4 above (Christmas America; A Musical & Pictorial Souvenir Of Christmas In The United States Of America). Besides the very similar titles, both albums open and close with the same songs ("Christmas America," Parts 1 and 2). Of the other 11 tracks, however, only three are the same in both albums, including the Peggy Lee track. This pair of "cousin" albums have also a sequel called Christmas America, Album Two (Sl 6950), which does not feature Lee. Firestone stickers ("Merry Christmas from Firestone," "Seasons Greetings From Firestone") can be found in copies of both Sl 6684 and Sl 6950.

13. Title: The Year Without A Santa Claus / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6588 / Rel. Year: 1968 / Note: Prepared for the E. F. MacDonald Incentive Company. Side A of this LP is entirely dedicated to Boris Karloff's narration of Phyllis McGuinley's book The Year Without A Santa Claus (turned into a well-known animated-motion TV movie in 1974). The other side contains five music performances: The Lettermen's "The Christmas Waltz," Glenn Campbell's "Old Toy Trains," Peggy Lee's "Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer," Al Martino's "The Little Drummer Boy," Sandler & Young's " I Sing Noel," and Roger Wagner Chorale's "Jingle Bells."

14. Title: The Year Without A Santa Claus / Format: CD / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: 48842 / Rel. Year: 2010 / Note: CD edition of the preceding LP. Includes the original narration by Boris Karloff as well as Peggy Lee's "Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer." Curiously, this CD's other tracks are not the same ones found in the original LP; only the Peggy Lee vocal was kept. The substituting renditions are Alvin & The Chipmunks' "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)," Johnny Mercer's "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town," The Beach Boys' "The Man With All The Toys," Amy Grant's "Mr. Santa" and, closing the disc, Alvin & The Chipmunks again, with "Up On The House-Top."

15. Title: Town And Country Sound Of Christmas / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 6893 / Rel. Year: 1973 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Winter Wonderland."

17. Title: The Sound Of Christmas, Volume 2 / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6534 / Rel. Year: 1967 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Song." Volume 1 does not feature Lee.

18. Title: Imagine The Joys Of Christmas, Presented By Sylvania / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6700 / Rel. Year: 1971 / Note: Opens with Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Happy Holiday." Also includes her Capitol recording of "Deck The Hall."

Year: 1968 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Happy Holiday." Same catalogue number, release year, and contents as the LP Eaton Presents Christmas Magic; Favourite Songs Of The Holiday Season, to be profiled below.

20. Title: Montgomery Ward Presents A Christmas To Remember, Volume 3 / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6681 / Rel. Year: 1970 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's recording of "Little Drummer Boy." This third volume seems to have been the last one in Capitol's "Christmas To Remember" series for Montgomery Ward. Lee is present in the series' first and third volumes, absent from second volume.

Contains Peggy Lee's recordings of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)" and "Christmas Carousel." Same front cover as the label's 1990 holiday sampler (already pictured herein), and most of the same tracks as well. There are a few deleted and added artists, however.

Artwork Shown:

31. Title: The Best Of Christmas / Format: reel & 8-track & cassette & 2LP / Label: Capitol / Cat. Num.: Y1t & 8xt & 8m & 4xt & Stbb 2979 / Rel. Year: 1967 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)."

32. Title: The Best Of Christmas / Format: cassette & CD / Label: Capitol EMI Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 0777 7 97458 / Rel. Year: 1991 / Note: CD edition of the preceding item. Hence Peggy Lee's recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)" is among its tracks.

33. Title: Christmas Music Collection / Format: LP / Discs: 6 / Label: CBS Special Products (aka CSP) & Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 18366, 18367, 18368, 18369, Sl 9125, Sl 9126 (numbers of the six discs) / Rel. Year: 1984 / Note: Commissioned by Multilingua on behalf of American Express.

34-36. Title: A Very Merry Christmas, Volume VIII / Format: 8-Track & LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 8t 6954 & Sl 6954 / Rel. Year: 1974 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz."

38. Title: A Christmas Tapestry / Format: CD / Label: Emi Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 7777 56918 2 5 / Rel. Year: 2005 / Note: Uses Peggy Lee's recording of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."

41. Title: Season's Greetings From American Airlines / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6687 / Rel. Year: 1970 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "White Christmas." Two previously mentioned Capitol LPs have the same catalogue number and the same tracks as this item, but they differ in design and title (Christmas A Gift Of Music, Zenith Presents Christmas; A Gift Of Music, Volume 4). These are by no means the only examples of such duplications. Clearly, Capitol Creative Products was in the habit of producing essentially the same track package for multiple companies; this seemingly lazy approach seems to have been practiced by the special markets divisions of other record labels, too. (Then again, perhaps laziness was less of a factor than the clients' demands for certain tried-and-true performances.)

Artwork Shown:

42. Title: Christmas Classics / Format: LP / Pieces: 4 /Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 9308 / Rel. Year: 1986 / Note: Peggy Lee's recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)" is one of the holiday classics in this compilation.

43. Title: The Spirit Of Christmas / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6731 / Rel. Year: 1972 / Note: Bears the same title as item #7 above, and also contains the same Peggy Lee rendition of "The Star Carol." However, the two albums are otherwise different. Among their differences is the fact that item #7 includes a second Lee track ("Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer").

44. Title: From Under The Christmas Tree; Warm And Wonderful Gifts Of Music / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: Sl 6589 / Rel. Year: 1968 (according to two commercial sites) or 1975 (according to one commercial site) / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." Exists in two other editions, both of them already shown above. One of the editions has the same tracks and the same catalogue number, but a different title (Christmas, The Season Of Music) as well as different artwork. The other edition has the same tracks, the same catalogue number, and the same artwork, but a different title (Zenith Presents Christmas, A Gift Of Music, Volume 1).

45. Title: A Christmas Treasury; 25 Best-Loved Holiday Classics / Format: CD / Label: Emi Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 7243 8 17792 2 4 / Rel. Year: 2000 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."

47-50. Title: Holiday Magic / Format: LP & 8-Track & CS & CD / Label: Capitol Creative Products & Cema Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Sl 6728 & 8xl 6728 & 4xl 6728 & Cdl 6728 / Rel. Year: 1971 (LP, 8-T) & 1986 (Cema CS) & 1991 (Cema CS, Cema CD) / Note: Side A of the LP edition opens with Peggy Lee's recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleighride)" and also features her self-penned "Christmas Carousel" on. In both the cassette and compact disc configurations, the tracks are the same ones as on the LP, but the tracks from the B side of the vinyl has been placed before those found in the vinyl's A side. As for the CD shown in the last image, it is actually a Canadian edition of Cdl 6726, with its own additional catalogue number (S21x 57839); there might have been an US edition as well, but I have not been able to locate data about it.

51. Title: Joy To The World; The Best Loved Songs And Carols Of Christmas / Format: 2LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: S21-56775 (0777 7 56775 2 2) / Rel. Year: 1987 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Star Carol."

Year: 1994 (also released in 1995 and 1996) / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "I Like A Sleighride (Jingle Bells)."

54. Title: Christmas Classics By The Fire / Format: CDVD / Label: Emi Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 5 09996 85960 9 5 / Rel. Year: 2009 / Note: When placed either on a TV or a computer, the DVD portion of this CDVD combo shows one of three optional scenes: a grate with burning logs (1), just the burning logs (2), or a living room filled with a Christmas tree, presents, a chair, a record player and, of course, the fireplace with the burning logs (3). The CD part of the release contains 23 songs, including Peggy Lee's rendition of "Happy Holiday." The songs can be played either by themselves or with the optional sounds of the fireplace and the crackling logs. Sold primarily at Wal-Mart and Best Buy stores. (Another CDVD similarly made for retail stores is Classic Christmas Songbook, licensed from Universal Music by the Somerset Group in 2013. That other CDVD closes with Lee's Decca rendition of "Ring Those Christmas Bells.")

55 & 57. Title: Keep Christmas Bright / Format: Reel & Cassette / Label: Audio Devices & Capitol Creative Products / Cat. Num.: 62420 & 80990 / Rel. Year: unknown; possibly late 1960s / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Song" (highlighted by a handler of the above-shown copy as "real good," along with Nancy Wilson's rendition of "The Christmas Waltz").

Artwork Shown:

59-60. Title: Christmas With The Stars (A Gold Medal Presentation) / Format: LP / Label: Capitol Special Markets & Longines Symphonette Society / Cat. Num.: Sys 5826 & Lsu 4c / Rel. Year: 1973 / Note: Back and front cover. The Longines catalogue number is on the lower left corner of the front cover and also near the lower right corner of the back cover, but not on the vinyl itself. In back covers such as this one, Longines featured a long self-promotional spiel that claimed their use of original tape masters ... recorded on superb 4-track Ampex stereo tape" as well as "complete remixing," use of a "super smooth and mirror finished acetate blank ... Scully Lathe," et cetera. Whether accurate or otherwise, such claims were likelier to apply to albums produced by Longines itself, rather than Capitol Special Markets pressings such as this one. Hence they can be deemed deceptive. Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Happy Holiday."

59-60. Title: A Capitol Christmas / Format: 2-LP & CD / Label: Universal / Cat. Num.: B0025560-01 / Rel. Year: 2016 / Note: Released as part of Universal commemoration of Capitol's 75th anniversary. Includes Peggy Lee's recordings of "I Like A Sleighride" and "The Christmas Spell." A second volume, issued the following year, does not feature any Peggy Lee tracks.

13. Title: A Christmas Collection / Format: CS & CD / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom) Mfp 5903 (0 07777 94670 2 0) / Rel. Year: possibly 1988 (CS) & 1990 (CD; also 1993) / Note: Peggy Lee's recordings of "Santa CIaus Is Coming To Town" and "The Christmas Waltz" are among the 20 tracks in this collection. There might have been a LP edition as well. For most of its lifetime, Music For Pleasure was essentially a budget branch of Emi.

14. Title: A Christmas Collection / Format: CD / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom) 7243 4 97532 2 8 / Rel. Year: 1999 / Note: Peggy Lee's recordings of "The Christmas Waltz" and "Happy Holiday" are among the 20 tracks in this collection.

15. Title: A Christmas Collection / Format: CD / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom) Emigold 5903 / Rel. Year: 2002 / Note: Twenty-track anthology containing Peggy Lee's recording of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."

17. Title: Christmas With The Stars / Format: CD & CS / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: (United Kingdom and/or Australia) unknown & Mc 62099 (also 32115) / Rel. Year: 1988 (CD) & 1990 (CS) / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town." The differing release years that I have for the compact disc and the cassette lead me to suspect that both configurations were issued in 1988 and reprinted or reissued in 1990, possibly in more than one nation. EMI might have also licensed this item to other labels.

18. Title: Christmas With The Stars / Format: CD / Label: Music For Pleasure / Cat. Num.: unknown; possibly 332 / Rel. Year: 1996 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz."

20. Title: Christmas With The Stars / Format: CD / Discs: 3 / Label: Emigold / Cat. Num.: unknown / Rel. Year: 2003 / Note: Reissue of the aforementioned 1996 3CD set, featuring the same trio of Peggy Lee tracks.

There are at least three volumes in this series; the second does not feature Lee.

3 & 4. Title: Christmas With The Stars, Volume 3 / Format: CD / Label: Pegasus / Cat. Num.: (Netherlands & Germany) Peg 473 / Rel. Year: 2003 (also 2005) / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "The Christmas Spell." Released with at least two different front covers, both seen above. The second cover bears both 2003 and 2005 dates, a detail which could signify that it is a reissue.

Artwork Shown:

5. Title: Christmas With The Stars, Volume 2 ("Christmas Gold" Series) / Format: CD / Label: Mastertech / Cat. Num.: (Australia) 9 316797 999825 (also 502562) / Rel. Year: 1999 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "The Christmas Song." The accuracy of the catalogue number and release year needs to be further scrutinized.

6. Title: Christmas With The Stars, Volume 3 ("Christmas Gold" Series) / Format: CD / Label: Mastertech / Cat. Num.: (Australia) 9 316797 997982 / Rel. Year: 2002 / Note: Includes the Bing Crosby-Peggy Lee duet Decca recording of "Little Jack Frost Get Lost" and the Columbia recording "Winter Weather," performed by The Benny Goodman Orchestra and featuring vocals by Lee with Art Lund.

IV. CAPITOL-EMI'S "CHEESECAKE" CD SERIES

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Let It Snow!; Cuddly Christmas Classics From Capitol / Format: CD & CS / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: 0777 7 99692 2 7 / Rel. Year: 1992 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's renditions of "The Christmas Waltz" and "Song At Midnight." Released both in longbokx packaging and a regular, non-boxed CD. For a picture of the cassette configuration, look near the bottom of this entry.

2. Title: Christmas Kisses; Cuddly Christmas Classics From Capitol / Format: CD / Note: Custom-made by Emi Music Special Markets exclusively for Bed, Bath & Beyond stores in 1998. Does not feature Lee tracks. (Included herein chiefly for illustration purposes; see general note at the end of this section.)

Artwork Shown:

3. Title: Merry Christmas, Baby: Romance & Reindeer / Format: CD & CS / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: 077 7 7 97459 2 0 & 077 7 7 97459 4 4 / Rel. Year: 1991 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "The Christmas Spell." For a picture of the cassette configuration, look near the bottom of this entry.

4. Title: Christmas Kisses; Christmas Classics From Capitol's Early Years / Format: CD / Note: Dating from 1990, this is the earliest of the CDs presented in this section. Does not feature Lee tracks. (Included herein chiefly for illustration purposes; see general note at the end of the section.)

Artwork Shown:

5 & 6. Title: Happy Holidays; Warm & Wonderful Christmas Favorites / Format: CD / Label: Emi / Cat. Num.: 0777 7 89587 2 / Rel. Year: 1993 & 1994 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "The Christmas Song." Happy Holidays; Warm & Wonderful Christmas Favorites was first issued in 1993 (image #5) then reissued in 1994 (image #6) with modified artwork but the same tracks and the same catalogue number.

General Note About This Series: The releases listed in the present section do not identify themselves as part of a series. The one exception is the longbox edition of Let It Snow, which reveals it to be part of Capitol's 50th Anniversary series. (For other Capitol/EMI anniversary issues, consult the first section of this page.) In any case, the subject to be explored herein is whether the eight items listed in above should or should not be considered a series.

Despite the lack of an identification, various common characteristics tie them together. The same underlying concepts are evident in the artwork, titles, and track selections of these issues. Further suggesting their' membership in a series is the fact that each of the CDs was released on a different holiday season between 1990 and 1994 -- thus, in a consecutive pattern. (The only exception is the custom-made item.) During the first half of the 1990s, other holiday CDs were of course released by EMI in the US, too -- e.g., The Best Of Christmas, Christmas On The Range, and Peace On Earth. A look at the artwork of those other discs makes it obvious that they were not conceived as part of this series. (Of those mentioned, the only one that features a Lee recording is The Best Of Christmas, which has been discussed in the first of the sections above.)

V. CAPITOL-EMI'S HOLIDAY LEGENDS SERIES

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Merry Christmas, Baby ("Holiday Legends" Series) / Format: CD & CS / Label: EMI-Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72435 33286 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "Winter Wonderland."

2. Title: I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm ("Holiday Legends" Series) / Format: CD & CS / Label: EMI-Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72435 33152 2 1 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "The Christmas Spell."

3. Title: Rock 'N' Roll Christmas ("Holiday Legends" Series) / Format: CD & CS / Label: EMI-Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72435 33153 2 0 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "Happy Holiday."

4. Title: Warm December ("Holiday Legends" Series) / Format: CD & CS / Label: EMI-Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72435 37088 2 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's rendition of "Happy Holiday."

General Note About This Series:

Each issue in this budget "Holiday Legends" series contains 10 tracks. As far as I know, there is a total of five issues. A Peggy Lee track can be found in all but one issue, titled Do You Hear What I Hear?. Its front cover is shown next to the left of this text.

VI. PICKWICK HOLIDAY LPS, PREPARED "IN ARRANGEMENT WITH CAPITOL RECORDS"

Artwork Shown:

1 & 4. Title: I'll Be Home For Christmas / Format: LP & 8-Track / Label: Pickwick / Cat. Num.: Spc 1009 & P8x 1009 / Rel. Year: 1969 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "The Christmas Song." Judging from the stickers that I have seen in some vinyl copies, Shop Rite was among the stores where Pickwick albums were originally sold within the USA. Pickwick albums were also sold in Canada; the 8-track cartridge copy seen in image #4 identifies itself as being Canadian. (The American 8-track edition uses the same front cover, without the green section. Other minor differences include the printing of the label's name, Pickwick, in large font, on the upper top of the label.) Pickwick International released LPs and tapes in Europe as well, but I have not come across any European editions of the items listed herein.

2 & 4. Title: Christmas Day / Format: LP & 8-Track / Label: Pickwick / Cat. Num.: Spc 1010 (also Spcx 1010) & P8x 1010 / Rel. Year: 1969 (or, according to other sources, 1978) / Note: The title of this album does not appear on its front cover. It can instead be found on the vinyl itself and on the back cover (in very small print). Pressed in both the USA and Canada. I have seen USA vinyl pressings that bear the regular prefix Spc in its catalogue number, and USA vinyl pressings that add one letter to it (i.e., Spcx). Furthermore, the back cover of the USA vinyl carries the legend "previously released on Capitol Records." As for the 8-track copy seen in image #4, it carries the more commonly found variation on

this legend ("by arrangement with Capitol Records) and its fine print suggests distribution on both aforementioned countries. Peggy Lee's contributions to this release are "Deck The Halls" (the compilation's opener) and "White Christmas." The album is titled Christmas Day after its Beach Boys selection, which is its third track.

3 & 6. Title: Merry Christmas To You! (aka Christmas Day) / Format: LP / Label: Pickwick / Cat. Num.: Spc 1010 / Rel. Year: 1969 (or, according to other sources, 1978) / Note: Same album seen in image #2, with its front cover turned into a back cover (image #6). The new front cover (image #3) seems to be using the words Merry Christmas To You! as the album's title, but the label of the vinyl still gives the title as Christmas Day. I do not know if a 8-track cartridge with this front cover was also created. So far, my search has not produced evidence of its existence.

VIII. THE RETAILERS: POTTERY BARN'S HOLIDAY CDS

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Classic Christmas, Volume II / Format: CD / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River - Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & _ / Rel. Year: 2002 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleigh Ride)."

2. Title: Classic Christmas Trilogy / Format: CD / Volumes: 3 / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & _ / Rel. Year: 2005 / Note: This image shows the trilogy's three CDs and also the box in which they were encased. The trilogy contains two Peggy Lee renditions, one in volume II and the other in volume III. There are no Lee tracks in the first volume, whose front cover is the one displayed in the forefront of this image -- i.e., the black & white photo of the couple.

3. Title: Classic Christmas, Volume III / Format: CD / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River - (possibly Universal Music Special Markets) / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & _ / Rel. Year: 2005 / Note: Volume III contains the Decca recording "Little Jack Frost, Get Lost," a duet sung by Bing Crosby and Peggy Lee. This Volume III uses the same front cover artwork as the box which contains the Trilogy.

Artwork Shown:

4. Title: Hip Holidays, Volume II / Format: CD / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River & Emi Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Pb 18 & _ / Rel. Year: 1999 or 2000 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Winter Wonderland."

5. Title: Hip Holidays Trilogy / Format: CD / Volumes:3 / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & _ / Rel. Year: ca. 2001 / Note: Contains two Peggy Lee renditions, one in volume II and the other in volume III. See entries #4 and #6.

Year: 2008 / Note: Opens with Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town." Rock River Productions might have not been involved in the making of this particular release.

Artwork Shown:

10. Title: A Cool Christmas, Volume II / Format: CD / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River - Emi Capitol Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & _ / Rel. Year: 1996 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town." Lee is not featured in volumes I and III. It stands to reason that a 3CD set titled Cool Christmas Trilogy might exist, but so far I have found no corroboration of its existence.

11. Title: Holiday Surprises ("Pottery Barn Kids" Series) / Format: CD / Label: Pottery Barn - Rock River - Emi Capitol Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Pb _ & 72435 3009 2 1 / Rel. Year: 2001 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Winter Wonderland."

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Winterludes; Cool Holiday Notes / Format: CD / Label: Starbucks Coffee & Capitol Records / Cat. Num.: 7243 8 36480 2 3 / Rel. Year: 1995 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." Rather than EMI per se, it is Capitol Records that receives copyright and production credits in the back cover of this CD

2. Title: Sleigh Ride Side By Side / Format: CD / Label: Starbucks Cofee & Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 0037 & 1509999 06684 2 5 / Rel.

Artwork Shown:

4. Title: Santa Baby / Format: CD / Label: Starbucks Coffee & Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: Cds 029 / Rel. Year: 2006 / Note: In an uncharacteristic move, the compilers of this disc incorporated Peggy Lee's poignant recording of "I'll Be Seeing You" to this collection.

5. Title: Winter Wonderland / Format: CD / Label: Starbucks Coffee & Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 509992 35943 2 6 / Rel. Year: 2008 / Note: Used rather rarely in compilations, Peggy Lee's recording of "Little Drummer Boy" is part of this compilation.

X. THE RETAILERS: TARGET'S HOLIDAY EXCLUSIVES (COMPASS PRODUCTIONS)

Artwork Shown:

1. Title: Baby, It's Cold Outside; A Crooners Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Universal Music Special Markets - Somerset Group / Cat. Num.: 096741453120 / Rel. Year: 2013 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's Decca recording of "It's Christmas Time Again." Also carries a 2009 date linked to Universal. (Perhaps that release date hints at Universal's release of a compilation with the same track listing on that year? If so, I have yet to locate such a compilation.)

2. Title: Baby, It's Cold Outside; A Crooners Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Allegro Music - Universal Music Special Markets - Somerset Group / Rel. Year: 2014 / Cat. Num.: 096741480423 / Note: Reissue of the preceding item with the same 15 tracks, one of them being Peggy Lee's Decca recording of "It's Christmas Time Again." The alterations to the front cover include the addition of Peggy Lee to the artist names in the lower banner, and the dropping of Bobby Darin's name. (Darin's version of "Christmas Auld Lang Syne" closes the collection.)

3. Title: Baby, It's Cold Outside; A Crooners Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Allegro Music - Universal Music Special Markets - Somerset Group / Rel. Year: 2015 / Cat. Num.: 096741496820 / Note: Reissue of the preceding item; same 15 tracks. Peggy Lee is the only female solo act in this anthology.

Artwork Shown:

4. Title: Under The Mistletoe; A Romantic Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Universal Music / Cat. Num.: 096741453427 / Rel. Year: 2010 / Note: Contains Peggy Lee's often anthologized Capitol rendition of "The Christmas Waltz."

5. Title: Romantic Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 609451 (also 0 96741 00726 2) (also 0 96741 453427) / Rel. Year: 2009 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's recording of "The Christmas Waltz." In addition to this one, another Target-sold Emi CD called Baby, It's Cold Outside; Romantic Christmas exists (096741 38312 0), and might be a companion to this one. Its front cover photo is the same one, but the tints used for the backdrop are different (pink & cream instead of red & gray). That photo has been overused by these companies; an earlier issue to also feature it is the Emi-licensed Pottery Barn Classic Christmas Trilogy (2005). In any case, Baby, It's Cold Outside; Romantic Christmas does not feature Lee.

6. Title: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town; A Family Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Emi Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 0 96741 00308 0 (also 509992 42435) (also 43723) / Rel. Year: 2008 / Note: This 15-track compilation contains Peggy Lee's self-penned, seldom anthologized number "Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer." As for the last of the images seen above, it shows an earlier Compass edition of this item. Emi was not involved in the making of that earlier item, which does not feature Lee, and which was also sold at Target stores. (Only about four artists and their tracks are common to that version and the 2008 edition.)

Artwork Shown:

8. Title: Cool Yule Holiday Party / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Universal Music Group / Cat. Num.: 096741314926 / Rel. Year: 2010 / Note: Uses Peggy Lee's version of "Winter Wonderland."

9. Title: Santa Baby; Romantic Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - EMI Music Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 52771 (also 0 96741 31542 8) / Rel. Year: 2009 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's often anthologized rendition of "The Christmas Waltz." This CD has a companion called Santa Baby; A Romantic Christmas (red backdrop, both members of the couple in red & white attire) which does not feature Lee.

10. Title: Kids Christmas / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Capitol Records Llc / Cat. Num.: 5 09999 09726 21 / Rel. Year: 2010 / Note: Includes Peggy Lee's seldom anthologized rendition of "Don't Forget To Feed The Reindeer."

11. Title: A Traditional Christmas, Volume Two ("Pure Gold Hits" Series) / Format: CD / Label: Compass Productions - Emi-Capitol Special Markets / Cat. Num.: 72435 29426 2 6 / Rel. Year: 2000 / Note: Features Peggy Lee's Capitol recording of "Jingle Bells (I Like A Sleigh Ride)." This is probably the first CD in an annual disc series named "Traditional Christmas"; see general note at the end of this section.

20. Title: Winter Wonderland; A Traditional Christmas, Volume 1 / Format: CD / Label: Universal Music Special Markets - Mood Media Entertainment / Cat. Num.: 59326 (also B0017508 02) / Rel. Year: 2012 / Note: Closes with Peggy Lee's Decca recording of "It's Christmas Time Again." As explained in the general note below, Mood Media was a later incarnation of Compass Productions. This CD identifies it merely as a distributor. The other three images above are later entries in the Traditional Christmas series, none of them featuring Lee; see notes below.

General Note About Target, Compass, And The "Traditional Christmas" Series: During the first decade of the twenty-first century, the US discount retailer Target became a place of interest to music fans across the nation. The interest stemmed from its CD exclusives. Many of such exclusives were actually the same compact discs being sold elsewhere, but with a significant advantage: they contained bonus tracks that were not available anywhere else. In addition to such sought-after items, Target naturally sold regular, non-exclusive CDs, and also budget music compilations which qualified as exclusives, too, because they had been commissioned for sale at their stores only. Among such budget exclusives were all the holiday discs profiled in this section.

Most of Target's budget exclusives were made by Compass Productions. Compass was a Canadian entertainment consulting firm in the same mold as the American company Rock River (the makers of Pottery Barn's music CDs). Hired by clients (mostly retailers) for whom they put together thematic music CDs, both Rock River and Compass Productions took care of both licensing suitable tracks from the major labels and preparing the compact discs themselves. Compass was, however, a less high-end, more budget-minded company, with more of a mass-market approach than Rock River. Another firm, Somerset Entertainment, purchased Compass' music catalogue around 2005. Somerset's catalogue was in turn bought by the Mood Media Corporation in 2009 and, in 2013, re-bought by the prolific music-and-video American retail distributor Allegro. In operation since 1982, the well-established Allegro still owned the Compass catalogue at the time of this writing (2016).

Of the Compass product itemized above, it is worth nothing that the "Traditional Christmas" (sub-)series occupies all three last columns of this section. Along with its prolific generation of volumes, the series' frequent incorporation of Peggy Lee tracks makes it deserving of additional commentary herein. The earliest "Traditional Christmas" items that I have been able to locate are three volumes dating from 2000, each consisting of 12 tracks and bearing the "Pure Gold" rubric. The latter was one of Compass' main production lines, featuring a wide diversity of common-denominator compilations with titles such as Classic Party, Booty Shakin' Hits, Sports Rock, Classic Rock, and 1980's Radio Hits. (Other prolific Compass series were "Lifescapes," "The Five-Star Collection" and "The Celtic Collection.") Of the three 2000 volumes of Traditional Christmas, the second was licensed from EMI and includes a Peggy Lee track; hence it has been itemized above. As for volumes one and three, both were licensed from Sony; they contain tracks from mostly Columbia- and RCA-associated artists (Johnny Mathis, Julie Andrews, Andy Williams, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Jerry Vale, etc.).

New items in the Traditional Christmas series were released in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. If additional discs came out in the omitted years between 2000 and 2014, I have yet to find evidence of their existence. (It is certainly possible.) As time went by, the total number of tracks per disc increased from twelve to fifteen (beginning in 2008). The number of volumes issued per year did not remain static, either; I have located four volumes twice (2003, 2013), three a few other times, and two for the remaining years. The year 2011 saw one additional modification: all four 2011 volumes featured only male singers and were all sub-titled A Crooner Christmas. (Allegro further released at least one Crooners sequel in 2013.)

Peggy Lee tracks were included in most years, the exceptions being 2003, 2007, 2011, and post-2012. As shown above, the last Traditional Christmas disc to feature Peggy Lee dates from 2012 and was licensed from Universal Music Special Markets. Pictured as a courtesy, one of the issues from 2012 is titled Winter Wonderland; A Traditional Christmas, Volume 1 (image #13), one from 2013 bears the name White Christmas; A Traditional Christmas, and one of the issues from 2014 is called Cool Yule; A Traditional Christmas, Volume One. Not pictured are the second volumes from each year, Silver Bells (2012) and Home For The Holidays (2014). The omitted 2013 second volume (if one was released at all) is completely unknown to me, but I do not expect it to include any Lee material.

General Note About The Happy Holidays Series: During each holiday season from 1965 to 2005, the hardware chainstore True Value sold a new volume of its custom-made Happy Holidays series. The largest bulk of the volumes were prepared for True Value by Rca/Bmg's Special Products branch. Of the other volumes, six were put together by Columbia/Sony, including the first two. Capitol/Emi/Cema was hired to produce 10 volumes, including the final one. In addition to the major labels just mentioned, the small label Pickwick also put together two Happy Holidays albums (albums 11 and 12, respectively released in 1975 and 1976), which consisted entirely of numbers sung by Sandler & Young. (At the time, Sandler & Young was a Capitol-recording act. Capitol was among Pickwick's shareholders.) Peggy Lee appeared only in the four volumes listed above.

General Note: For various major retailers, I have prepared sections both on this holiday page and in a more general page. In the case of Williams Sonoma, only a holiday section has been prepared. After looking into dozens of non-holiday Williams Sonoma CDs with seeming potential to qualify for inclusion, I found merely two that had Peggy Lee tracks: Better Than Anything, from the company's "Drink Companion" series (featuring Lee's version of "Why Don't You Do Right") and Paris, from the "Music Celebrating The Flavors Of The World" CD and Janet-Fletcher-Book series (including Lee's version of "C'est Magnifique"). Since I do not have a full listing of Williams Sonoma CDs, there could still be a few others with Lee tracks, although currently the chances strike me as very low.
