It’s also the first Peggy Lee CD to include both sides of her 1953 Decca holiday single, Ring Those Christmas Bells and It’s Christmas Time Again.\n\nSix tracks on the CD are taken from Christmas Carousel, Peggy’s much-admired 1960 album for Capitol: The Christmas Waltz, I Like a Sleighride (Jingle Bells), The Christmas Song, Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town and two songs written by Peggy: Christmas Carousel and Don’t Forget to Feed the Reindeer. The remaining three tracks were recorded for Capitol in 1965: Winter Wonderland, Happy Holiday and The Little Drummer Boy.\n\nTracks\n\n1. Ring Those Christmas Bells (featuring Jud Conlon’s Rhythmaires)\n\n2. Winter Wonderland\n\n3. Happy Holiday\n\n4. The Christmas Waltz\n\n5. I Like a Sleighride (Jingle Bells)\n\n6.
