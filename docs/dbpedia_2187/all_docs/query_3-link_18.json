        "text": "What Am I Buying?\n\nWe have purchased a number of copies of all the records we sell. We have created CDs and MP3s of excellent quality using multiple recordings from the records we've purchased. You will find the quality of our CDs to be superb. In order to abide by copyright laws, we offer for sale records with the CDs and MP3s for our customers who do not already own the vinyl lps. If you, like me, have held on to your records, you need only buy the CDs. You already have a copyright obtained when you bought the records; therefore, copyright laws allow you to have a transfer copy of the original recording your purchased.\n\nAll our CDs are printed directly - no labels - and include the song listing, artist/release name, and a thumbnail image of the front album artwork. CDs are packaged in plastic jewel case boxes. Our jewel cases include the front album artwork on the front and the song listing on the back. We do not include the back album artwork as we have found many album jackets contain a lot of text on the back which does not reduce down from the 12\" album jacket to the 5\" CD insert satisfactorily. The artist and release name are printed on the side spine.\n\nBecause we sell the vinyl records only to provide you a legal copyright and thus the legal right to own the transfer copy CD, we make no claims as to the quality or condition of the vinyl records you may receive. The records you purchase may or may not have been used to create your CDs. The sound quality of your CDs will be highly superior to the vinyl record you receive if you purchase lps. We give you the option to purchase a vinyl record (if we have them in stock) in the purchase options below the Song Listing of each item.\n\nMP3 downloads are also available for many of our releases. As with the CDs, you must own the record to purchase an MP3 download. If you purchase the download, you will not receive a CD. Of course, if you prefer to purchase the MP3 download to a CD, but you do not own the records, we are happy to sell you the records along with your download.\n\nSample Image of our CD\n\n(Your CD will of course have the artwork and song listing for the album you purchase.)\n\nSample Image of our Jewel Case Front Cover\n\n(Your jewel case will of course have the artwork for the album you purchase.)\n\nSample Image of our Jewel Case Back Cover\n\n(Your jewel case will of course have the song listing for the album you purchase.)\n\nImage of our Jewel Case Side Spine\n\n(Both side spines are printed in this way.)\n\nAbout our Shipping\n\nIn most cases, we ship same day if your order is received by 3:00pm Eastern Time. Our standard shipping carrier is the United States Postal Service for both domestic and international orders. The method of shipping (i.e. express mail, priority mail, first class mail, or media mail) may vary, but you will receive your order within the time frame you select at check-out.\n\nOur standard shipping price is six dollars per order regardless of size for domestic US orders. International Shipping varies depending on country, shipping method, etc. We have built a shipping infrastructure that assures your product will ship the same day we receive the order, will be packaged so that it arrives to you safely, and will arrive quickly. Our standard shipping price pays not only the actual shipping costs, but also supports that infrastructure. If you choose the standard shipping option, your order will likely be shipped using US Postal Service's Media Mail option unless we are within seven days of Christmas. We do not use media mail services within seven days of Christmas because media mail is given the lowest priority by the US Postal Service and is the least reliable of their services as far as arriving on or before the post office estimated delivery date.\n\nWe understand that the flat shipping rate is more favorable to those customers with larger orders than it is to those with smaller orders. We have concluded, though, that it is a fair way to price our shipping since each order is handled with the same speed and care.\n\nSeveral shipping options are available. You will choose your shipping option at check-out. Also, at check-out, you have the option to edit the delivery address if you wish to have your products shipped to an address that differs from your billing address.\n\nPlease feel free to call us if you have any questions. 1-888-384-6970 or 1-513-274-1144\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Shipping\n\nWhen will my package be shipped?\n\nWe ship products every day the postal service is open. If you order by 3:00pm ET Monday - Friday, your order will ship same day. If you order after 3:00pm on weekdays, the order will ship the next postal day. If you order by 12:00pm on Saturday, your order will ship same day. If you order on the weekend after 12:00pm on Saturday, your order will ship Monday.\n\nWhat carrier do you use?\n\nWe ship most orders by United States Postal Service, though we do occassionally ship with UPS, FedEx, or other carriers.\n\nDo you ship outside the U.S.?\n\nWe ship all over the world. With the exception of Antartica, we have shipped to every continent on the globe.\n\nHow long will it take for my order to be delivered?\n\nStandard Shipping 1-7 Days 6.00\n\nPriority Shipping 1-4 days 9.00\n\nExpress Shipping 1-2 days 20.00\n\nNext Business Day 60.00\n\nCan I have my order shipped to a different delivery address?\n\nYes. During the checkout process, you will have the option to change the delivery address for your order. You can enter one or multiple alternate addresses.\n\nWhy Do I Have To Own A Record or Tape?\n\nWe probably get this question more than any other. We specialize in Christmas recordings that have not been released by the record companies on CDs. We obtain (purchase) several vinyl record copies of each recording we sell and use those albums to create a very good digital transfer.\n\nTransferring analog material to digital formats has been our full-time business since 2004. Since we began, we have had a strict policy to follow copyright laws. We are not in the business of piracy. The original record or tape sold by the record company provides the owner of that recording the right to transfer or to own a transfer of the audio in any format he chooses. For instance, if you, like I bought a record in 1975 and then transferred it to cassette tape, you were not breaking the copyright law. You had a right to do that because you owned the record that had been sold by the record company.\n\nThe same situation applies to our CDs and MP3s. If you own a record or tape that was originally produced and sold by the record company, you have a right to own a CD transfer or MP3 of that record or tape. Most of our customers still own their well-worn, lovingly played LPs. They just can't play them anymore. For those people, there is no need to purchase a record with your CD or MP3. You already own an original, so you have the right to own a CD transfer or MP3. For those who don't have a record or tape, we offer for sale with your CD or MP3 a record.\n\nIf you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to call us. We're happy to help and hope that you appreciate our desire to follow US copyright laws."
