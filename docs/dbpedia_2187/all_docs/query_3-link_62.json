        "text": "Larry Busacca | Getty Images\n\nBy KEITH O'CONNOR | Special to The Republican\n\nMusic adds a dynamic emotional element to both movies and television shows, and the same holds true for Christmas music, which brings joy to the holiday season and stirs up fond memories.\n\nChristmas music has come a long way from early religious Christian hymns to today's contemporary popular music.\n\nHoliday songs date back as early as the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the 1800s, songs like \"Silent Night\" could be heard in church, but it wasn't until 1857, when \"Jingle Bells\" was written, that secular music began to enter the holiday scene.\n\nAs rock 'n' roll gained popularity in the 1950s, Christmas music took a big turn. There was Elvis Presley's first Christmas album in 1957 followed in 1963 by the groundbreaking \"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector,\" considered by many as \"the best Christmas album ever,\" which opened the doors for a slew of Christmas albums from contemporary artists.\n\nA bountiful list of new Christmas releases from your favorite artists from pop to country and from rock to easy listening and everything in between awaits listeners to add some extra cheer to their holiday.\n\nHere's a list of the Top 10 new entries on this year's musical Christmas list:\n\nGustavo Caballero | Getty Images\n\nLeAnn Rimes - \"It's Christmas, Eve\" Original Movie Soundtrack (EverLe Records)\n\nCountry songstress LeAnn Rimes, who has more than several Christmas albums to her name, comes up with a soundtrack album from her new Hallmark Channel movie \"It's Christmas, Eve.\"\n\nThe nine-track holiday release features three new songs alongside the classic \"White Christmas,\" \"Carol of the Bells\" and even a Christmas jam.\n\nThe poppy \"You and Me and Christmas,\" which opens the album, is an up-tempo gem.\n\nColumbia Records\n\nJohn Legend - \"A Legendary Christmas\" (Columbia Records)\n\nWith a cute play on words for its title, \"A Legendary Christmas\" kicks off its 14 tracks with a little help from Stevie Wonder on harmonica for \"What Christmas Means to Me.\"\n\nLegend also gets a little help from jazz artist Esperanza Spalding on \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\"\n\nStandouts include an inspired \"Silver Bells\" and the touching piano only \"Waiting for Christmas.\"\n\nCould be a potential classic.\n\nBrushbranch Records/Surfdog Records\n\nEric Clapton - \"Happy XMAS\" (Brushbranch Records/Surfdog Records)\n\nInevitably each year there is a Christmas album you never expect an artist to undertake.\n\nThis year there are two. The first belongs to Eric Clapton, who in his words adds \"a slight bluesy tinge\" to holiday classics and more contemporary songs, including the Clapton-written \"For Love On Christmas Day.\"\n\nClapton's own artwork of Santa adorns the cover of his 24th album. There is even a deluxe box set wrapped in a custom red and white faux fur to resemble a classic Santa hat and that includes a flexidisc, ornament and more.\n\nCleopatra Records\n\nWilliam Shatner - \"Shatner Claus: The Christmas Album\" (Cleopatra Records)\n\nThe season's second unexpected ever Christmas album belongs to William Shatner of \"Star Trek\" fame.\n\nWho knew Captain Kirk could sing?\n\nHe can't, but instead speaks his way through some nicely orchestrated and rockin' songs with the help of some equally unusual guests, including Todd Rundgren, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, Iggy Pop, as well as Judy Collins, Brad Paisley and others.\n\nOnly for those with discriminating tastes.\n\nRCA Records\n\nPentatonix - \"Christmas Is Here\" (RCA Records)\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning a cappella sensations are on their fourth Christmas album since 2012.\n\nNow considered a Christmas staple when it comes to holiday music, the kings of harmony are joined on their new recording of Christmas classics and other gems by Kelly Clarkson on \"Grown-Up Christmas List\" and Maren Morris on \"When You Believe.\"\n\nRepublic Records\n\nJessie J - \"This Christmas Day\" (Republic Records)\n\nNot what you might expect and a pleasant surprise from the British singer/songwriter whose unconventional music style blends contemporary R&B, pop, hip hop, soul, and other genres.\n\nFrom lush orchestrations to jazzy big band, Jessie J, for the most part, stays faithful to the classics.\n\nThe album includes collaborations with Boyz II Men on \"Winter Wonderland\" and Babyface on \"The Christmas Song,\" as well as two gorgeous songs produced by David Foster.\n\nIt includes a combination of \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\"/\"Jingle Bells\" like only Jessie J can do.\n\nCabin 24 Records\n\nIngrid Michaelson - \"Songs for the Season\" (Cabin 24 Records)\n\nRecorded with a full 35-piece orchestra, the indie-pop singer's second full-length Christmas album features the single \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,\" a duet with \"America's Got Talent\" wunderkind Grace VanderWaal.\n\nOther collaborations include \"White Christmas\" with Christina Perri (whatever happened to her?), Will Chase on \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" and Leslie Odom Jr. on Mariah Carey's hit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\"\n\nThe album's one original song, a downer called \"Happy, Happy Christmas,\" isn't so happy and is about losing her mother four years ago.\n\nUniversal Studios\n\n\"The Grinch\" motion picture soundtrack (Columbia Records)\n\nThe soundtrack from Illumination's new movie reboot features Tyler, the Creator's take on the iconic song \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.\"\n\nOther contributors of past Christmas chestnuts include Nat King Cole, The Supremes, Run-D.M.C. and more.\n\nThe album also includes two instrumental tracks from the score created by Danny Elfman.\n\nRebecca Sapp | Getty Images\n\nMike Love - \"Reason for the Season\" (MELECO Records)\n\nThe Beach Boys have their own Christmas albums, and now co-founder and lead singer Mike Love has stepped out with his own interpretations of classic Christmas songs and new seasonal themed tunes.\n\nHe's even taken on the iconic Beach Boys' \"Little St. Nick.\" (See if you can tell any difference.)\n\nThe album features a guest appearance by Hanson on \"Finally It's Christmas\" and also features accompaniment by Love's four children.\n\nMatthew Eisman | Getty Images\n\nThe Monkees - \"Christmas Present\" (Rhino Records)\n\nBootlegs have long been available of Christmas music performed by The Monkees from their once popular television show.\n\nNow comes an official release of newly-recorded versions of classic Christmas songs and new tunes written for the group, including \"Unwrap You at Christmas.\"\n\nIn addition to the voices of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork, the voice of the late Davy Jones is taken from vintage recordings.\n\nUniversal Music Group\n\nBubbling under The Hot 10 are:\n\nMormon Tabernacle Choir - \"A Merry Little Christmas\" (Mormon Tabernacle)\n\nMichael McDonald - \"Season of Peace - The Christmas Collection\" (BMG)\n\nThe Mavericks - \"Hey!

The album also includes the song \"Fall On Me\" performed by Andrea Bocelli and his son Matteo Bocelli.\n\nNot to forget, there are also a multitude of Christmas albums from Christian artists this year - including \"The Advent of Christmas\" by Matt Maher on Essential Recordings, \"It Must Be Christmas\" by David Phelps released by the Gaither Music Group, \"The Table: A Christmas Worship Gathering\" by Darlene Zschech and \"Something's Happening: A Christmas Album\" by CeCe Winans on Pure Springs Gospel.\n\nAlso, Dove-winning singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle is offering up a deluxe edition of her 2016 album from Centricity Music called \"Behold - A Christmas Collection\" with three additional songs.\n\n_________________________________"
