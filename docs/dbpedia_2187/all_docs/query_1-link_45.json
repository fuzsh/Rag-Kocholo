        "text": "Thanks for the info. I've had the CD since it came out and was pleasantly surprised at how good the sound was - certainly better than the Newport and Opera House recordings from the following year, from my point of view. And Ella is in nicely relaxed form here too - I think she comes across as a much better singer and artist here than on the rather square arrangements of the Cole Porter songbook, which I always think is praised more because of its concept than because of its execution.\n\nThere are some nice live rarities on the Zardis album, too - her live repertoire over the course of her shows from the 1950s through to the early 1990s is absolutely massive. While all shows from one tour might be very similar, she seemed to change things up quite dramatically from one set of shows to the next. We see it most notably perhaps in the 3CD set of Paris shows from 1957-1962, but even looking at the Berlin shows of 1960 and 1961 - only two songs are repeated.\n\nI totally agree , It's a pretty good recording & worthy of Release ........ It has the right feel all over it .... her catalog is just mindblowing , i'm slowly collecting a little at a time .\n\nIt's a slightly strange catalogue in many respects, because it's always assumed that her work after Verve was somehow not on a level with what had come before. Her voice certainly altered as she got older, but the interesting thing about Pablo years is that her studio work now had much more of the freewheeling qualities of the famed live albums. For the most part, she wasn't saddled with the rather restrictive orchestral arrangements of much of the Verve years, and had much more chance to improvise. Pablo was, not just for Ella but for all musicians who moved to it, such a wonderful label allowing the musicians the ability to make great music without having the keep them particularly commercial. If you haven't yet explored the Pablo years, many of the albums are worth your time. And I would argue there's probably not a more enjoyable, uplifting jazz concert recording that the Jazz at the Santa Monica civic concert from 1972, available on a 3CD set. Ella is on the last disc. Basie is on the first. And the second takes us into JATP territory with Al Grey, Stan Getz, JJ Johnson, Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, Roy Eldridge, and others.\n\nThat's good to know as most of my collection is based around the Verve Label , the Only Pablo album i have is \"Take love Easy\" with Joe pass which is a beautiful Album .... and i'll put that Live Album on my list"
