The ten song project includes “Angels We Have Heard On High” and “Joy To The World” along with an English and Spanish version of “Silent Night”. The Greatest Gift: A Christmas Collection features appearances from Kari Jobe, Natalie Grant and David Archuleta.\n\n“Christmas is actually my favorite time of year! Partly because of the music and partly because of the change of atmosphere that it invokes. There’s such a sense of generosity, kindness and love that prevails and everything seems hopeful and full of joy! We can use that all year round!” Gokey shares. “Christmas centers around the greatest gift the world has ever known, the birth of a savior. That’s what it’s all about for me.”\n\nThe Greatest Gift: A Christmas Collection Track Listing:\n\nAngels We Have Heard On High\n\nUntil You\n\nSilent Night (feat.
