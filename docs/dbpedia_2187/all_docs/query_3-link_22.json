        "text": "Originally titled The Magic of Christmas when first released in 1960, this was Cole's only full album of Christmas songs, although he had recorded several holiday singles earlier in his career. One of these, 1946's \"The Christmas Song\", was re-recorded originally for the 1961 album The Nat King Cole Story, and in 1963, The Magic of Christmas was re-issued with that recording added to the tracklist in place of \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\", and the album given new cover art and retitled The Christmas Song."
