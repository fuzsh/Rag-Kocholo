        "text": "No \"Little Saint Nick\"? It's garbage.\n\nI have four of them. Instrumentals not being my thing, I skipped Christmas Magic, but would definitely consider getting it in the future, if a cheap copy were to turn up. Completely agree that the rarities from Christmas Kisses makes that disc the most worthwhile of the bunch (even if, in all honesty, it's the one that I enjoyed the least, overall).\n\nIn the particular case of Christmas Magic, we probably owe the inclusion of such relatively rare tracks (Leadbelly, Yogi Yorgeson, Julia Lee, Mel Blanc, Stan Freberg, etc.) to the fact that Ron Furmanek was involved in the capacity of compiler and producer. Regrettably, however, he was not the one in charge of the mastering -- not, at least, nominally.\n\nAs of right now, that is the big question for me, too -- and thus one reason to keep an eye on this new set. I mean: the above-shown CD series indeed credits Bob Norberg as the remastering engineer, and the same is true of several other Capitol holiday compilations from the CD era, including the Christmas Cocktails volumes that are part of the label's Ultra Lounge series ... The chances that A Capitol Christmas features the same Norberg remasterings are high, I think, but there is still room for some hope that such is not the case. Maybe somebody here will order it and kindly report.\n\nThat is all too true. I believe that it's been a few years since the last round of Capitol Christmas CD stuff, though.\n\nI suppose that, in preparing this compilation, Universal was trying to come up with its own take on a definitive set of \"traditional Christmas vocals recorded by classic pop vocalists from the Capitol family.\" If so, the track listing suggests that they have succeeded in that one regard. Just about every single popular Capitol holiday track from that era is in. (As for the less famous tracks in the mix, most are by famous singers from the roster, who would have otherwise gone missing from the compilation.)\n\nAs already pointed out, Universal's big shortcoming is in the choice of title. It should have been something which specified that the Capitol classics in question are from the pre-rock era. Or better yet, Universal could have considered an additional disc/sequel, dedicated to not only rock stuff but also novelties, country, post-rock, etc. Such a CD could have have even included more tracks from not just Capitol but also Liberty artists (The Chipmunks, for starters, independently of what you or I might think of them!) ... Alternatively, they could reissue and repackage that 1999 promo disc mentioned by Stereoptyc, and call it A Capitol Christmas II ...\n\nYesterday I caught sight of the following thread: Favorite Christmas LPs? Looking for suggestions. Â» , in which Nathan Aaron had already announced, back in August, the release of A Capitol Christmas. I'm adding his messages here because they include an useful comparison of this new release with the older Christmas Cocktails volumes from Capitol's Ultra Lounge series.\n\nI'm looking forward to grabbing this comp. It will be nice to have these great songs all on one LP for the holidays. Then it's back on the shelf until next year."
