Then, a 10” LP version was released in 1950. In 1954 the contents were all re-recorded and expanded to a 12” LP. This is the album that had the Norman Rockwell painting on the cover.\n\nIn 1964, Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians again re-recorded “Twas The Night Before Christmas” as was part of an album for Capitol Records called “The Meaning of Christmas” This album is now part of a double CD called “Christmas Magic.”\n\nWe have re-created the original ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas’ Decca album using material from the Waring archives. Our sources are original recordings from radio and television broadcasts and some special events. The arrangements are exactly as on the Decca records with, in most cases, the same personnel.\n\nChristmas Holiday Time $12.00\n\nA compilation of 21 Christmas carols and holiday songs as performed by Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians on their many radio and television broadcasts.\n\nGod’s Trombones $12.00\n\nRoy Ringwald’s thrilling settings of three James Weldon Johnson’s poems; The Creation, Go Down Death, and Judgment Day.
