        "text": "Perhaps more than any other holiday season, Christmas is full of nostalgia. As the years go on, whether anyone likes it or not, it can be nearly impossible to avoid memories of the seasons that have passed and Christmas traditions around the tree, whether spent with family or alone. As different as those holiday memories are for everyone, so is the music often heard during this time, whether it's traditional Christmas carols or new tunes.\n\nWith the holiday season fast approaching, Stacker dug into articles and data from a plethora of leading music websites and curated an unranked list of 20 great Christmas albums of all time from various genres and eras.\n\nOf course, traditional Christmas music makes up the majority of the greatest Christmas albums. The tunes that generations came up withâ€”those from such recording artists as Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, and Nat King Coleâ€”have endured in everyone's memories and hearts. More recent Christmas albums, such as Mariah Carey's now-classic \"Merry Christmas,\" are legendary in their own right. This Christmas music list spans various genres, including hip-hop and country. An excellent Christmas record helps listeners reflect on their memories of the holiday.\n\nYou may also like: Lyrics to 50 famously misunderstood songs, explained\n\nKing Records\n\n'Charles Brown Sings Christmas Songs' by Charles Brown\n\n- Released: 1961\n\nCharles Brown's Christmas album features the highly popular and frequently covered \"Please Come Home for Christmas,\" which peaked at #76 on the Billboard charts in January 1962 and was Brown's only solo Billboard hit.Â Brown co-wrote the song with Gene Reddâ€”though Brown later claimed he was the sole songwriter.
