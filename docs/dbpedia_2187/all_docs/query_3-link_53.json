Here for the first time youll hear the Beach Boys accompanied by a sonorous forty-piece orchestra, with special arrangements written just for this album by Dick Reynolds. Youll hear vocal arrangements by Brian Wilson that make it clear what an important part each boys voice plays in their wonderful blend: youll hear a fine solo by Brian in Blue Christmas and Al Jardines first recorded solo as a Beach Boy in Christmas Day.\n\nThe songs the Boys have chosen for their holiday greetings to you range all the way from their own light-hearted seasonal hit Little Saint Nick to beautiful traditional favorites done with the orchestra.\n\nHere, certainly, is an outstanding Christmas album - one that youll enjoy for many seasons to come.\n\nProduced by Brian Wilson."
