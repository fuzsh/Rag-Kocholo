        "text": "Norman Granz had become Ella's personal manager in 1953 on a handshake. He believed in her quality without question, but was frustrated with her Decca sessions and her exclusion from the best clubs in the nation. By 1955, he managed to get Decca to issue some better sessions, running up to the end of her Decca contract at the end of 1955. In 1955, he was finally able to get Ella booked into the very best clubs in America. Her legendary Verve sessions started in 1956.\n\nSo this arrest, at a harmless \"after show\" party, coincided with Ella's bookings at the best clubs in each city. That must have angered city officials and police in Houston. Given Norman Granz' ferocious dedication to equal rights, this must have blown his top. I don't have evidence, but I bet the arrest was very ugly, with all the standard tactics directed at minorities. Ella was traumatized at the onset of her glory years. She had great strength to go on and achieve what she did in the next few years.\n\nThis image was earlier in 1955, after Marilyn gave some help to get Ella booked in the best LA clubs. This kind of stuff pissed some people off.\n\nThe other woman is Ella's cousin with Dizzy and Illinois Jacquet, also playing in Houston that night.\n\nThis is how Marilyn Monroe forced the LA Clubs to book Ella in early 1955. She followed through and attended every show. The club owners were interested in Marilyn being there, but Ella ended up breaking through. Ella must have been devastated when Marilyn died.\n\nIn the gig where Ella was arrested, it was part of a JATP show, and Dizzy, Jacquet and Granz were in Ella's dressing room after the show relaxing by tossing some dice. It was not like these artists and their tour manager were trying to rob each other's earnings, but more having something to do and laugh about as they came down from the intensity of their show. BOOM. The door comes off and they are arrested.\n\nIt had more to do with the fact that Norman Granz, a civil rights activist, insisted his tour would not play to segregated audiences, nor would his tour acts be forced to dress in their cars or the bus, but have private dressing rooms. A first, especially in the south.\n\nYou might say it was a symbolic arrest, intended to make a statement. But that statement was very profound. It had to do with this same type of racism evident in this circular, which is from the mid 1960's:\n\nIt blows my mind to realize this flier is from New Orleans...\n\nWe forget what things were like in America before the civil rights movement.\n\nAnd how much people like Norman Granz, the Lion brothers, Sinatra and others did at the time.\n\nJust having Sammy Davis up on stage with white guys must have been pretty major at the time.\n\n(from UHQCD thread)\n\nUni continue to reissue their stuff with UHQ pressing.\n\nThis time it is going to be 10 Ella Fitzgerald’s albums ($16.99).\n\nClamp Hands, Here Comes… Ella!\n\nReally?\n\nIs this a new remaster? - Absolutely not.\n\nDid they mention which remaster they will use? - It's my pleasure.\n\nSo what to expect? I had to dig into previous releases of each title to figure out which remaster the new release might be based on, and put a few notes after the title description.\n\nOct. 07, 2020\n\n(UHQCD)\n\nElla Fitzgerald Porgy and Bess\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella And Louis Again\n\nElla Fitzgerald At The Opera House + 9\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella Swings Lightly + 4\n\nElla Fitzgerald Get Happy! + 2\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas + 6\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella In Hollywood\n\nElla Fitzgerald Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie! + 3\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella Swings Brightly With Nelson + 3\n\nElla Fitzgerald Ella Returns To Berlin\n\n“Reissue from Ella Fitzgerald in UHQCD format.”\n\n(translation)\n\n“[Ella Fitzgerald Verve Masterpiece Selection (UHQCD)]\n\nElla Fitzgerald is loved by many fans as a leading jazz vocalist of the 20th century.\n\nIn commemoration of \"Ella Discovered! Back in Berlin\" (UCCV-1182), an unreleased live recording in Berlin in October 1962, which will be released on October 2, from the album that she left in the Verve era, when she reached her peak, 10 well-known titles were selected to make them first UHQCD.\n\nThis is a must-see for fans, including some CDs for the first time in Japan!”\n\nElla’s 1962 Berlin tapes were found and released worldwide including Japan with SHM treatment:\n\n“This work became a live sound source recorded in Berlin in 1962, and was previously stored as a private collection of Norman Grants. … This is a valuable sound source, which contains 16 powerful songs, she sang during her heyday…\"\n\nThis is good news, but raised 2 questions:\n\nIf this is such a big deal that 10 more of her albums will be released in commemoration of this, why is it not UHQ pressing?\n\nAnd why will these 10 equally valuable albums, which have remained untouched for so many years, finally get printed on UHQ, but do not deserve the sound re-treat?\n\nI only have an answer to the first one: because the price for this SHM release is already at its height - $24.54. And Ella's fans will buy it anyway...\n\nI hope that in a year or so I will have the opportunity to see it reissued on UHQ at the regular price of $17.\n\n(translation)\n\nPorgy and Bess [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“A dramatic and moving story continues from \"Summertime\" to the climax, where Ella & Louis sing with a unique expression.\n\nAn immortal masterpiece that has won the Grammy Awards.”\n\nElla and Louis Again [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“This is a sequel that was released after \"Ella and Louis\", a super-luxury competition that shines in jazz history.\n\nYou can fully enjoy the rich music by two legends, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.”\n\nThese two titles were remastered by Seth Foster at the Universal Mastering Studios-East as a part of the 4CD 8-panel Digipak 100th Anniversary Campaign (2 tasteful booklets w/complete discography, photos and more):\n\nWill this wonderful remaster be used for the new UHQCD release ?\n\nCheek to Cheek\n\nElla and Louis Learnin' the Blues\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMIArNBLxMo\n\nMoonlight in Vermont\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbaS0-YEFIs\n\ntoilet_doctor, Aug 27, 2020 #2284\n\nElla At The Opera House +9 [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“Another masterpiece live album alongside \"Ella in Berlin\" left by \"First Lady of Jazz\".\n\nUp-tempo and ballads are in great shape backing with All Stars including Oscar Peterson.\n\nIncludes two stages: Opera House and Shrine Auditorium. 9 bonus tracks.”\n\nI think it will be reprinting on UHQ of the 2016 SHM release with the same 2000 mastering, used for the Mini LP series ‘Verve Super Best 50’:\n\nAgain, it is my guess only because there are no credit notes in the SHM reissue at all. To say: “Up-tempo and ballads are in great shape “, would be a stretch. The sound is mostly open and clear, but on several main tracks Ella sounds from the middle of the stage and the bass is shy. Bonus tracks are much better in this regard, but have a heavy “S” brightness in vocals.\n\nWill they do something about all of this? I don’t think so.\n\nIt’s great content, though – I love it a lot.\n\nBewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\n\nIll Wind\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDruHkBX4AM\n\nDon’Cha Go ‘Way Mad\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BMReqJ9l1A\n\nElla Swings Lightly + 4 [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“This is a representative studio work that won the Grammy award, with Ella singing swinging at the peak,\n\nfollowing the gorgeous performance of Marty Peach's big band. 4 bonus tracks.”\n\nThis album was released in Verve 60th Anniversary series in 2016 on SHM.\n\n(I don’t have it, but another one from this series Ella ‘Whisper Not’ – no credit notes, nothing).\n\nThis will most likely be the UHQ version of the 2016 SHM release, which (again, more likely) based on 1992 Verve remaster by Suha Gur.\n\nI don’t see any 24-bit remaster for this album – maybe tape has been lost.\n\nIn this case, it’s perhaps the best sound we can get. I have to buy it to compare with what I have.\n\nElla swings lightly… She really does:\n\nOh, What a Night for Love\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru71Xh80_Xk\n\nWhat’s Your Story, Morning Glory?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFNgmnU03_g\n\nKnock Me a Kiss\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LAvIqIR6Y\n\nBlues in The Night\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQRfPbwzTKo\n\nAs Long as I Live\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GGtOY1Uo_Y\n\nGet Happy! + 2 [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n”This is a 1959 recording with impressive orchestration. The overwhelming scat performance at \"Blue Skies\" is a must-see.\n\nThe first CD in Japan. 2 bonus tracks.”\n\nThis more likely will be 1998 24/96 remaster by Kevin Reeves, used for Verve Digipak series 'Verve by Request' with good remastering:\n\nI’m going to buy this excellent album on UHQCD to \"get happy\" - will comment on the sound.\n\nSweet and Lovely\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4o4Hfkt_Wk\n\nMy Old Flame\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHA-Cg28W_M\n\nThat Old Feeling\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA7hT-Zr70A\n\nBlue Sky\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgevD2EGvO4\n\nElla Wishes You a Swinging Christmas [UHQCD] [Limited Edition] / Ella Fitzgerald\n\n“This is a Christmas album that Ella recorded for the first time in 1960 with the orchestra in the background. Listen to Ella swinging famous Christmas popular songs made in the United States. 6 bonus tracks.”\n\n“It'd be hard to imagine a happier wish than the one this jazz vocal legend offers her listeners on this urbane-yet-homey collection of holiday favorites. The First Lady of Song recorded these tunes in 1960, at the peak of her interpretive powers. As such, she puts her singular stamp on everything from a sultry vamp like \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve\" to the sweet and cozy \"The Christmas Song.\" Even potentially shopworn standards like \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" sound fresher when they're coming from Ella Fitzgerald.” -- David Sprague\n\nI found only one 2002 Verve remastering, but I don't have it.\n\nGood Morning Blues\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af6O3-jOUBc\n\ntoilet_doctor, Aug 27, 2020 #2285"
