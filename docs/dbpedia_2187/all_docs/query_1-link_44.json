At an early age Wilson heard recordings from Billy Eckstine, Nat King Cole, and Jimmy Scott with Lionel Hampton's Big Band. Wilson says: \"The juke joint down on the block had a great jukebox and there I heard Dinah Washington, Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, Little Esther\".[7] Wilson became aware of her talent while singing in church choirs, imitating singers as a young child, and performing in her grandmother's house during summer visits.[6] By the age of four, she knew she would eventually become a singer.\n\nAt the age of 15, now attending Columbus, Ohio's West High School, Wilson won a talent contest sponsored by the local ABC television station WTVN.

In 1963 \"Tell Me The Truth\" became her first truly major hit, leading up to her performance at the Coconut Grove in 1964 – the turning point of her career, garnering critical acclaim from coast to coast.[10] TIME said of her, \"She is, all at once, both cool and sweet, both singer and storyteller.\"[11] In 1964 Wilson released what became her most successful hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am\", which peaked at No. 11. From 1963 to 1971 Wilson logged eleven songs on the Hot 100, including two Christmas singles.

Wilson despised being put into a particular music category, stating that in a 1992 interview with Essence Magazine, \"I didn’t know I was a ‘Black artist’ until I was nominated for a Grammy in a Black category.\" She eventually shifted towards a R&B and soul-influenced sounds by the late 1960s.

During the 1970s, Wilson was her most experimental, exploring genres such as jazz fusion, disco, funk, Philadephia soul, and blues. Despite Wilson's successes in the 1970s and 80s, many were critical of her incorporation of the then emerging genres in her works.

This is evident her albums, A Touch Of Today and All in Love Is Fair. Her natural sense of improvation made Wilson's reinditions of standards often stand out from many of her comtemporaies. Though not much of a songwriter, Wilson has co-written a few of her songs, such as her hit \"Tell The Truth\" (1975). For most of her live performances, Wilson preferred to sing live.

Shorter breathed these days, she can still summon a warm, rich sound and vividly tell a song's story. With a big band behind her in 'Taking a Chance on Love', she also shows there's plenty of fire in her autumnal mood\".[24] At the Hollywood Bowl, August 29, 2007, Wilson celebrated her 70th birthday with an all-star event hosted by Arsenio Hall. Ramsey Lewis and his trio performed \"To Know Her Is To Love Her\".\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nWilson married her first husband, drummer Kenny Dennis, in 1960.

Wilson was one of the first artists to be open about taking control over her career. Her longtime label, Capitol Records allowed Wilson many creative freedoms, from experimenting with numerous genres and musical themes, including social issues, romance, motherhood and sexuality.

Rolling Stone once stated \"Wilson truly is the reason why black acts, such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston and Anita Baker all had flourishing careers.\"\n\nIn 2006, a monument of Wilson was constructed in Tokyo, Japan. Wilson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1993, Wilson was honored with a Grammy Legend Award.
