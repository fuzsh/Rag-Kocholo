Contributor to magazines, including Analog Science Fiction-Science Fact, Galaxy, and Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.\n\nCollections of McCaffrey's manuscripts are housed at Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, and in the Kerlan Collection, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.\n\nADAPTATIONS:\n\nDragonsong and Dragonsinger were adapted as children's stage plays by Irene Singer and produced in Baltimore, MD; the \"Pern\" books inspired a cassette of music, Dragonsongs, a board game, and two computer games; many of McCaffrey's books have been recorded on audiocassette, including All the Weyrs of Pern, Damia's Children, Dolphins of Pern, The Girl Who Heard Dragons, Dragonquest, The Planet Pirates, The White Dragon, Nerilka's Story, and Powers That Be.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nScience fiction's much-heralded \"Dragon Lady,\" Anne McCaffrey, resides in Ireland in a home called Dragonhold, where she produces, among her other novels, the fantastic tales of the dragonriders of Pern. A planet protected from deadly spores by fire-breathing dragons and their human partners, Pern is a former colony of Earth that has lost much of its knowledge of science and history. Its culture now revolves around the battle against these deadly spores and on the relationship between dragon and rider.\n\nIndeed, that kinship is not taken lightly. As described by Washington Post critic Joseph McLellan, \"When the dragon eggs are ready to hatch on the planet Pern, it is a major social event with enduring, almost cosmic implications.\" In a form of permanent selection called \"Impression,\" \"each fledgling dragon struggles out of its shell, there is a predestined conjunction of souls; the dragon selects the young human who will be its life-mate, rushing to his or her side and bowling over anyone imprudent enough to stand in the way,\" the critic added.\n\nAlthough Pern is inhabited by flying dragons and dominated by a near-feudal society—elements native to fantasy worlds—McCaffrey's creation is based on solid scientific principles. The author in fact took supplementary courses in physics in order to create credible science fiction. The focus of the Dragonrider series—on Pern's society and on the relationship between dragon and rider—puts the science in the background, unlike many science fiction novels. New York Times Book Review critic Gerald Jonas noted that \"few are better at mixing elements of high fantasy and hard science in a narrative that disarms skepticism by its open embrace of the joys of wish fulfillment,\" leading some to call McCaffrey's work \"science fantasy.\" \"Despite their fantasy feel, the Dragonrider books have always had a sf premise,\" Carolyn Cushman stated in Locus. While McCaffrey has always hinted at that premise in her books, she explores it fully in 1988's Dragonsdawn, the story of how the original colonists of Pern used genetic manipulation to develop Pern's dragons.\n\nIt is the fanciful atmosphere of Pern, however, with its never-ending opportunity for adventure, that draws in many fans. Not surprisingly, the dragons are the scene-stealers in McCaffrey's novels; they are described as large, multicolored, flying reptiles \"who communicate telepathically with their riders and keep the land free from the vicious Threads, destructive spores that fall from a neighboring planet whenever its irregular orbit brings it close enough,\" Edra C. Bogle wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. Bogle cited Dragon-quest: Being the Further Adventures of the Dragonriders of Pern, the second volume of the \"Pern\" series, as \"full of action and unexpected twists,\" and indicated that it \"may well be the best of these books. The major theme of all the volumes, how to rediscover and preserve the past while maintaining flexibility, is well brought out here.\"\n\nBehind these magical tales lies a serious social commentary, according to Bogle. \"Most of McCaffrey's protagonists are women or children, whom she treats with understanding and sympathy,\" Bogle said. The injustices these characters suffer, facilitated by an unprogressive social system, \"are at the heart of most of McCaffrey's books.\" In fact, the majority of McCaffrey's novels feature strong heroines: the ruling Weyr-women of the \"Dragonrider\" books; the determined young musician of Crystal Singer and Killashandra; the talented psychics of To Ride Pegasus and the \"Raven Women\" series; and Helva, the independent starship \"brain\" of The Ship Who Sang. Through these works, Bogle indicated, \"McCaffrey has brought delineations of active women into prominence in science fiction.\"\n\nReviewing Crystal Singer for the New York Times Book Review, Jonas described its heroine, Killashandra Ree, as \"young, beautiful, intelligent, sexy, and courageous.\" He also found McCaffrey's language to be \"athletic\" and contended that the theme of the book is \"obsession on a Melvillean scale.\" In the world McCaffrey creates in the novel, the \"living crystal\" of the title is an essential element for both space travel and communications. The crystal can only be found on the planet Ballybran, and can only be mined by singers who have trained rigorously to produce the right notes with perfect pitch. Most of the narrative is taken up with Killashandra's compulsion to become a crystal singer. Jonas compared McCaffrey's depiction of the crystal singer trade, which includes its \"scientific, economic, political and psychological ramifications,\" to Melville's description of the whaling trade in Moby Dick. He went on to note that in McCaffrey's case, this material consumes the book, as if \"Moby Dick and Ahab [were] reduced to mere walk-on parts … So what we are left with is a detailed instruction manual for a trade that doesn't exist.\" However, Jonas concluded that although \"crystal singing may not be real … Killashandra's obsession comes alive, and readers who get past the first fifty pages will find themselves sharing it.\"\n\nThe \"Pern\" series (including Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern, Nerilka's Story, Dragonsdawn, The Renegades of Pern, All the Weyrs of Pern, The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall, and The Dolphins of Pern) explores the history and culture of McCaffrey's created world. Moreta and Nerilka's Story expand on a legend from the original three books; Dragonsdawn and The Chronicles of Pern tell of the original settlement of Pern, the breeding of dragons, and the early efforts of the settlers to fight Thread. The Renegades of Pern and All the Weyrs of Pern use their newly recovered technology to find a final solution to the attack of the spores and, in the process, begin to question some of their basic assumptions about their society. McCaffrey has also published \"Pern\" novels that have little to do with dragons; the \"Harper Hall\" trilogy draws on the author's experience as a trained vocalist and explains the function of music in Pernese society, while The Dolphins of Pern explores human relations with an animal that was just as much an immigrant to Pern as the humans themselves. There are also three Pern reference books that help explain the many names and places in Pern.\n\nMcCaffrey's \"Dragonriders\" series has proved so popular, with each new volume hitting the bestseller lists, \"that it has almost transcended genre categorization,\" Gary K. Reynolds asserted in the Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review. \"McCaffrey succeeds so well because she presents a colorful, ideally traditional culture in which each person has his or her place, with corresponding duties and privileges; in which the moral choices are clear; and in which, ‘if you try hard enough, and work long enough, you can achieve anything you desire.’\"\n\nIn 2003 McCaffrey collaborated with her son, Todd McCaffrey, on the \"Pern\" novel titled Dragon's Kin, set in a previously unexplored period in Pern's past. Critics noted that though there are two writers and Anne McCaffrey's style has become familiar to series fans, \"Pern\" readers would \"notice no seams,\" according to a reviewer for Publishers Weekly. Frieda Murray in Booklist commented that the collaboration is \"a harbinger that Pern, an enduring monument for two generations of sf readers so far, will continue after its originator's departure.\"\n\nMcCaffrey's fiction (and her fans) stretch far beyond the original dragonriders of Pern. Her first published book, Restoree, \"was ostensibly written ‘as a tongue-in-cheek protest’ against the cliches of standard space opera,\" reported Bogle. Decision at Doona \"lacks a central heroine and a love story,\" the reviewer stated, and \"emphasizes the need for new ways of adapting to new circumstances.\" Powers That Be, a collaboration with Elizabeth A. Scarborough, tells about life and rebellion on a terraformed company planet.\n\nStill writing prodigiously in her mid-seventies, McCaffrey added several new volumes to her \"Freedom\" and \"Pegasus\" series, concluded the \"Rowan\" series, launched the \"Acorna\" series with volumes written in collaboration with Margaret Ball and Scarborough, published Nimisha's Ship, a sequel to the 1989 The Coelura, and also the non-series volume If Wishes Were Horses. Vicky Burkholder, writing in Voice of Youth Advocates, characterized If Wishes Were Horses as \"a short, easily read fairy tale that any McCaffrey fan will enjoy.\" The book tells the story of teenage Tirza, whose father has gone off to war and whose village has been burnt to the ground. Tirza receives a magical crystal, similar to the ones her mother wears, for her sixteenth birthday. Her first wish with the crystal is for her twin brother, who desperately wants a horse for his birthday. Little does she know that her mother has used her own crystals to wish for the same thing. The two wishes produce results far beyond their expectations. Soon the horse arrives, followed by many more horses, followed in turn by Tirza's father leading his victorious troops home from the war.\n\nWhile faulting the lack of tension in Nimisha's Ship, Joyce Davidson, writing in the Voice of Youth Advocates, nevertheless dubbed it \"a good adventure story\" that is \"sure to be in high demand wherever there are readers of science fiction.\" Set in the far future, the novel centers on Nimisha, a dedicated student of engineering. After her father's death she inherits the Rondymense ShipYards and sets out to design and build a long-range spaceship. It takes more than a dozen years to complete her task. On the ship's first test flight, with Nimisha aboard, it is sucked into a wormhole that transports it to a different space. Here, Nimisha discovers other ships and survivors, both human and alien, who have also been transported to this space by accident. She eventually finds love and motherhood on a new world. Davidson noted: \"The book contains open and frank discussions about sex.\"\n\nIn The Tower and the Hive, the fifth and final volume in her \"Rowan\" series, McCaffrey concludes the story of Angharad Gwyn, her husband Jeff Raven, and their offspring, who possess various telekinetic and telepathic powers. Purveyors of interstellar transportation and communication for an alliance of humans and friendly, weasel-like aliens, the Gwyn-Raven family must confront the threat of hostile aliens in the Hivers.\n\nChangelings: Book One of The Twins of Petaybee, published in 2005, is another McCafferey/Scarborough collaboration. It is the first book in a planned trilogy geared towards younger readers about ten-year-old telepathic, shape-changing twins from the planet Petaybee. Because of the symbiotic bond that occurs between the inhabitants of Petaybee and the planet, for an adult to leave would mean certain death. Too young to develop this bond, the twins Murel and Ronan Shongili \"serve as ambassadors for off-planet journeys,\" as described by critic Jackie Cassada in Library Journal. Scarborough and McCaffrey joined forces again to pen the 2006 sequel to Changelings, Maelstrom: Book Two of The Twins of Petaybee. In this book, the twins find themselves on a mission to rescue the inhabitants of the no longer hospitable planet Halau and bring them to Petaybee. The book is \"filled with adventure, intrigue, and unexpected twists,\" observed Cassada. Once back on their home planet with the refugees, the discovery of a race of aquatic alien life forms poses further problems for the twins and Petaybee's newest residents.\n\nAs in many other McCaffrey novels, there is social commentary underlying the story. Indeed, the themes established in Changelings, such as \"protecting all life forms,\" \"looms even larger in Maelstrom,\" remarked Booklist contributor Sally Estes. McCaffrey \"combines Irish, Hawaiian, and Indian lore to create a rich history that is at once unique and familiar,\" concluded Dana Cobern-Kullman in her review of the book for School Library Journal.\n\nMcCaffrey also writes non-science-fiction literature. These books include a series of romantic novels written for Dell and also some juvenile fiction. Black Horses for the King, for instance, is set in post-Roman Britain and draws on McCaffrey's extensive experience with horses to tell about the formation of the Arthurian cavalry.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nArbur, Rosemarie, Leigh Brackett, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Anne McCaffrey: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography, G.K.
