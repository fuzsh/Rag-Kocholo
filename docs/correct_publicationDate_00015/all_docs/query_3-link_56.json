Now the time has come for Lessa to shed her disguise-and take back her stolen birthright.\n\nBut everything changes when she meets a Queen dragon. The bond they share will be deep and last forever. It will protect them when, for the first time in centuries, Lessa's world is threatened by Thread, an evil substance that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches. Dragons and their Riders once protected the planet from Thread and the blood-red star, but there are very few of them left these days. Only the gigantic, golden Queen can breed new dragons. And the Queen is fading . . . dying . . .\n\nNow brave Lessa must risk her life, and the life of her beloved dragon, to save her beautiful world. . . ."
