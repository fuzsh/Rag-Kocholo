        "text": "It has its roots in some of the very first books I ever read as a young man getting into fantasy. Like many young readers, I was captured by books about dragons, specifically books about boys who find dragons and learn to fly them. These have been staples of the fantasy genre for some fifty years. For me, it was The White Dragon by Anne McCaffrey and Dragon’s Blood by Jane Yolen. For others, the “boy and his dragon” story that captured them was Eragon, or How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nI’ve always loved this story archetype, but I’ve never written anything using it. This is in part because…well, it’s a familiar story. Too familiar. I wasn’t certain I could add anything new to it. So I left it alone, letting ideas simmer, until in 2012 something struck me. Could I mash this together with a flight school story like Top Gun or Ender’s Game, and do something that wasn’t “a boy and his dragon,” but was instead “a girl and her starfighter”?\n\nSkyward was born, much like Mistborn, with me taking two ideas and mashing them together to see where they went. And they went someplace incredible—I grew increasingly excited about the project, as I saw in it a chance to both play in a space I loved, and do some very interesting things with story and theme. It wasn’t until this year that I got the personalities of the characters right, but I really got excited when I found a place for this in the lore of stories I’d been creating.\n\nIt was as if I—like Spensa, the protagonist of Skyward—had found a broken-down spaceship in a cavern, and I couldn’t rest until I knew what it felt like to fly the thing. Her story was inspired by tales I loved as a child: when someone would find a dragon egg and then raise the hatchling to soar with them in the air. Skyward didn’t really come alive until I re-imagined this style of story in a science fiction setting, taking my own spin on the idea—a spaceship taking the role of the dragon, pointing the story in a new direction."
