        "text": "September 24, 2012\n\nI enjoyed this. I like the Pern books. I acknowledge they're not going to be classed as literary masterpieces, but I like the world, I like the people - and the dragons of course - and I like getting the chance to go back and visit on a regular basis.\n\nTodd McCaffrey has done a good job in his mother's world, and it's also good to know that the new things he introduces (mostly more history about the original colonists and their next generation) have most likely been given the go-ahead by Anne McCaffrey.\n\nDragonsdawn is probably my favourite Pern book so I was delighted to know we were going to have more story in that time frame and it was well done. Series that start out as fantasy (or fantasy-like SF as McCaffrey considers Pern) have lately taken to rapidly discovering - or more often rediscovering - technology, so it was a nice change to see the last remaining few who knew the tech (mostly Wind Blossom) being forced to make the hard decisions about the priorities for saving the technology, machines and knowledge.\n\nI liked the link across time, especially when it became clear there wasn't going to be any actual time travel involved, but lots of guessing about the future and the past. It was nicely done.\n\nLots of hints were dropped about Wind Blossom, the Eridani and the keeping of secrets, so I hope something more is done with that in the future. I don't mind tantalising hints if I know I'm going to get the payoff at some point. Hints that don't go futher than hints just annoy me. At this point I'm willing to offer the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI thought the characters were engaging, although needing a set of main characters in two different times meant no-one got as much character development as they might have done. All the same, I certainly liked Lorana and the others.\n\nI did think that having the two main bronze riders being called M'hall and M'tall could get a litte confusing, but since both had been created before this book, I guess there wasn't anything to do about it.\n\nI've got a bit rambling now, but basically a most enjoyable read without being too much strain on the brain. A nice visit to a familiar setting.\n\nHowever, I must say that I find it amazing how quickly these people managed to pick up advanced genetics (and with a three strand helix as well) so quickly and then apply it. It wasn't that easy when I did biochemisty and I did science right through school and university.\n\n[Copied across from Library Thing; 25 September 2012]\n\nMarch 22, 2013\n\nI felt like I'd read this story before. I've never read this book before, but I realized half way through that Todd was reusing tropes from some of the other really grand Pern novels to tell this story: a plague (Moreta), timing it as a way to solve the problem of being short staffed (Dragonflight, Dragonquest, etc), learning Oldtimer science to save the world (Dragonsdawn, the White Dragon, etc.), using the loss of a dragon to create instant sympathy for the character (Dragonquest).\n\nWhile this gave the book a familiar feel, it also felt like... cheating. Anne was able to use, and reuse, elements of stories throughout the Pern-verse to tell compelling and new stories for what seemed like a generation. This story, while I liked it, wasn't ... new. It tries to bridge the gap between Landing and the era in which we meet the dragons in Dragonflight, and I think it doesn't do enough to move beyond landing tech and into how society formed for the rest of the planet after the tech failed.\n\nBut just because I think he cheated doesn't mean I didn't like the read. Easy and comfort read again. It's been a hell of a week.\n\nSeptember 27, 2008\n\nAt first I felt that Dragonsblood wasn't nearly as good as any of the other Pern books, including Dragon's Kin, which is the one combined effort of Anne and Todd McCaffrey that I've read so far. I liked a lot of the details and story that Todd chose to tell, but it just didn't flow as smoothly as the other Pern books.\n\nIn the beginning of the book, I struggled with keeping the characters straight. Also, the constant jumping between time periods interrupted the flow of the storyline for me. Things really started to pick up about half way through the book, though, and I was absolutely engrossed for the last 150 pages or so. Some great connections to previous books are included. Just one small example - did you ever wonder about the dragon and dragonrider who were found at Benden Weyr entombed in solid rock?\n\nI definitely recommend this for all fans of Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series! Overall it isn't quite up to the standards of Anne's books, but very close and definitely worth reading.\n\nApril 20, 2022\n\nNice solid tale of the early days of the dragonriders and the planet Pern. Very nice characters that really invest you in the story. good read. Recommended\n\nNovember 27, 2017\n\nThis book was, to be blunt, not good. It is Mr. McCaffrey's worst attempt thus far to rewrite Pernese history. Ted Tubberman was a delusional crackpot, not a secret Eridani spy whose bloodline was necessary to Pern's survival. Wind Blossom was a poor shadow of her mother who lucked into creating the Watch-Whers through arrogance, not a long-term plan to improve thread fighting. Trying to turn these two into the unsung heroes or Pern is just ridiculous. And the whole \"Eridani require three bloodlines\" thing comes out of nowhere, and then returns to nowhere. The whole book, Wind Blossom is insisting that the three bloodlines are absolutely necessary, only to flip at the end and say that her daughter is now free of her mother's \"curse.\" I could understand someone coming to the books in chronological order, and getting this one before the originals, and liking it as a bit of average sci-fi, but otherwise it just fails. It gives the impression of an author who had several different stories to tell, tried to tell them all at once, and lost control of his own narrative.\n\nAlso, could we maybe have ONE generation of Pernese without a plague or disaster that wipes out nearly all of the dragons? Maybe? And pseudo-medieval characters teaching themselves advanced genetic manipulation? In a week? Just by reading a textbook? This isn't like the original cast being taught by A.I.V.A.S. in the earlier works. They had no instructor other than a voice telling them which cabinet to get their books out of. There's only so much disbelief I'm willing to suspend.\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\nIt's 507 AL, 507 years after landing, and Thread is expected soon. It parallels Dragon's Fire and Dragon's Kin.\n\nMy Take\n\nInteresting for its insight into responsible creation but, again, no subtlety, no passion. Simply a recitation of facts with allusions which never enlighten us. There is an interesting implication about Ted Tubberman and we meet his grandson, Tieran.\n\nThere are hints made about dementia, but McCaffrey doesn't do anything with it. No depth. Still no passion.\n\nOn page 220, McCaffrey has Emorra intuit that the beads on Gren's harness had not yet been made. On practically no evidence, Emorra determines that Gren is here from 400 years in the future. No development, no tension. On page 258, the dragons are so sick and they're dying right and left, yet McCaffrey doesn't build on this. I barely cried. In fact, my mind kept wandering thinking about reading another book, any other book. It was almost like reading a dry history book.\n\nAs part of the frantic search to discover what is killing the dragons (I use the word \"frantic\" to attempt to instill some sense of drama . . . at least in the review), Kindan, Lorana, and friends discover something which will help save Pern.\n\nAs an example of not paying attention, McCaffrey has established that Lorana must be back at the Weyr to feed her queen in a hour. By page 273, Lorana and company have been reading through the Records for hours with no hint or suggestion that Lorana is supposed to be back at the Weyr taking care of her beloved dragon. I thought the new wyerlings were so amazingly attached to their dragons?? Their every thought was of them? Even when McCaffrey kills off dragons of riders we have somehow managed to find some empathy for, he doesn't press how horrible this is. It could almost be the day after Christmas and we have to wait til next year to get more prezzies.\n\nThis side of the story we learn the details of Kindan and Lorana falling in love.\n\nMcCaffrey makes Tullea, one of the queen riders at Benden, such a bitch but he doesn't delve into it. It's all on the surface.\n\nI am so irritated with McCaffrey writing these three stories as separate books. He's stretched out the pages to make the reader feel they're getting a deal but once you read through you realize how you've been cheated.\n\nWe do finally learn how it happened that that young dragonrider and his dragon ended up encased in solid rock at Benden Weyr. One of the very, very few dramatic bits of writing that worked. And it so wasn't worth it!\n\nAgain, no build up, no drama in the conclusions Emorra, Tieran, M'hall, and Seamus come to in deciding how to build the instant learning room. Such a bore.\n\nThe Story\n\nHalf the story is of Wind Blossom's last years on Pern, 50 years after landing to 59 AL, struggling to find a cure for the dragons and fire lizards in which we learn the true reason for her attitude toward her students and child while the other half of the story takes place in the weyrs as dragons sicken and die.\n\nThe Characters\n\nAll the characters from Dragon's Fire and Dragon's Kin appear playing their parts in various degrees with references to their adventures in these two stories.\n\nIn the Wind Blossom half . . .\n\n. . . we learn of Sean O'Connell's death, the reasoning behind the creation of the watch-whers, and a hint as to a purpose behind Ted Tubberman's activities. Tieran is his grandson. Wind Blossom and her mother, Kitty Ping, bioengineered the dragons. Emorra is Wind Blossom's daughter.\n\nIn the current-day half of the story . . .\n\n. . . Lorana is taken on as a pet project by J'trel and his dragon, Talith, after losing his partner, K'nad. Lorana has lost her father in a beast handling accident, and since they had lost all the rest of her family during the plague 12 years ago, Lorana has no one. But J'trel is taken by her incredible drawing ability and helps her begin her dream of sketching all the animal life of Pern. Along the way, J'trel learns Lorana's secret.\n\nWe get a brief glimpse of Cisca, Weyrwoman for Fort, and K'lior deciding to send their wounded and weyrlings back in time to Igen to recover and be ready to meet Thread in three days even though another of the books covers this more thoroughly. I guess this \"glimpse\" helps tie Dragonsblood in with the other . . . yawn . . . oops, sorry, snort . . .\n\nIt's been ten Turns since Kindan met M'tal at Camp Natalon and he's harpering at Benden Weyr. Nuella's brother, Dalor, and Renna, his secret childhood sweetheart, are together now.\n\nThe Weyrleaders are K'lior of Fort, C'rion of Ista, M'tal of Benden, D'vin of High Reaches, and D'gan of Telgar after having moved there from Igen when plague and drought made it uninhabitable and their last queen died. Tullea is one of the queen riders at Benden.\n\nThe Cover and Title\n\nThe Wind Rider heeling through the waves as a blue dragon confronts the ship. Lovely cover with a fleeting connection to the story.\n\nThe title is perfect as it is the Dragonsblood that proves critical.\n\nMarch 13, 2020\n\n3.5 stars. Although there were plenty of problems with this book, I ended up enjoying it. I'm likely the minority here, but I really enjoyed the deep delves into science. However, the genetic sequencing at the end was a bit too much even for me; while I enjoy and applaud unapologetic science and scientific explanation, it must come in small doses in order to keep the story moving forward. When you have 2-3 straight pages of genetic exposition, it becomes repetitive.\n\nLorana, our de-facto heroine, didn't have much in the way of character; I wasn't a fan of the decisions she made on behalf of her fire lizards and dragon, but I do understand why she made those decisions. I think the audience would have been much more sympathetic toward her if the text had spent time exploring the reasoning behind her decisions, and the emotional consequences she suffered because of them, but it didn't. As someone who has made Bad Life Choices myself, however, I found myself sympathizing with Lorana's grief (despite the fact that it is not explored nearly as much as it deserves).\n\nThere were several storylines that didn't seem to have any payoff (and, in fact, could have been omitted with no impact on the main plot), but I think I'd have understood some of those better if I'd read the other books involving this particular group of characters. Since this was my introduction to this cast, I took it all with a grain of salt.\n\nThere were many more problems which I won't cover at this hour, but I stand by my rating, because I really did enjoy the presentation of science in the book. I will also note that while the depiction of women in this series is still problematic, I felt this was...maybe a slight improvement over the early books like Dragonflight? Here, at least, we have characters like Wind Blossom and Emorra who have agency, and who are deeply flawed. I love seeing flawed characters, especially flawed women, because so often women are not *allowed* to be flawed -- not in literature, and not in the real world, either. Perhaps I see a little bit of myself in Wind Blossom, which is why I liked her so much, arrogance, stubbornness, emotional unavailability and all.\n\nI'll leave it at that and revisit this review in the morning to see if I still feel the same way. Upon reflection, 2 AM is probably not the best time for me to have written this.\n\nJuly 11, 2022\n\nI'd have enjoyed this book far more if I were an engineer or scientist, and if there were fewer characters (54+) and fewer time changes. I was more than halfway through the book before I took a day to figure who was in which time frame, and what happened to who.\n\nI gave it 4 stars instead of three because after all it is a Pern Book. The author, Anne's son, is a aerospace engineer, so I have to forgive him for the heavy reliance on science. I guess I am more of a fantasy buff than a sci-fi reader.\n\nThe dragons are wonderful and the characters too. Just hard to keep track of. For thse of you brave enough, or smart enough, to read this, it covers two time periods on Pern: First Fall, After Landing (AL) 59-58 and Third Pass 508-509 AL. The chapters mostly go back and forth, every other. A plague is involved, some villains, and some mystery. Never did really figure out who or what caused the plague.\n\nGood luck, and let me know how it goes.\n\nSeptember 14, 2011\n\nA pretty terrible book. While Pern has always been littered with Mary Sues and Gary Sues for it's main characters (pretty much almost all of them), Lorana takes the cake. If this had been on Fanfiction.net, it would've been voted down just to the absurdity of the plot. Spoilers ahead! ---> Lorana is born in a hold with pretty much no rank, and is becoming a healer while doing some art on the side. While on her way to a new Hold she almost dies and orders her fire lizards (she's impressed two) to leave her. One ends up in the past with geneticist Wind Blossom at around the time the Pernese began losing most of their advanced technology (which to this day I am absolutely confused as to how they lost it so quickly, even the knowledge of it existing!). She is found by a Benden Weyrrider, who takes her to Bender (for some reason) and when she recovers she stands on the Sands and Impresses (surprise!) the golden queen, Arith. What follows is the usual dragon training plus bonus special queenrider-ness!\n\nHowever, here is where things go absolutely haywire: dragons and fire-lizards are becoming sick to the point of death. My problem with this is that any knowledge of this plague is completely unwritten about in any of Anne's books. It's a ret-con, and a bad one at that. Lorana is instrumental, as usual for a Mary Sue, in trying to save the dragons by using technology -- that she found in the caverns of Benden Weyr -- she has no idea to really use, to create a cure for the disease, or at least inoculate the rest of the dragons. She then decides to test the prototype cure ON HER OWN DRAGON which results in the dragon's death. I don't even know HOW that was thought of as a good idea, and just re-enforces my assumption of Lorana being a stereotypical Mary Sue, because Mary Sues do not really have any emotional connection to anyone: if it gets in the way of their being special (whether through good acts or grief) it will be done by the author. Anyone who has read this series will see Lorana's actions as being antithetical to everything we have learned about dragonriders so far.\n\nI didn't really care for the book after this point. I know they figure out the cure. Lorana is apparently damaged, but not enough that shortly after her dragon's death she gets it on with some Weyrharper (no idea what his name is, because they are THAT forgettable), another contrast to the typical nature of ex-dragonriders.\n\nI honestly believe that flawed as it was, Anne's books were far superior and if she wasn't wanting to write anymore, she should have stopped there. Todd is a sub-standard author who I think could benefit from several character development workshops to learn how to create a well-rounded character, rather than these completely un-relateable, vapid characters that barely relate to the original canon of the series. I have no desire to read any of the newer books, because I honestly don't hold out much hope for Todd. Which is sad, because DRoP was my first major series, and like many I hope for them to never end. In this case, however, I wish it did.\n\nSeptember 12, 2012\n\nI so love and so identify with the Pern world and novels, that reading a new book (to me) in the series is automatically a thrill. I really have nothing to say about Todd vs. Anne McCaffrey; this book felt like a Pern book. I did worry near the end about the plot device used to solve the issue at hand, it's a bit too unrealistic, but since it also involves people roughly 400 years apart trying to solve the same problem, I really liked the overall arc of the story. My other concern was something common in all Pern books, the characters are very real. Some you care for and root for so much, and others you just despise. I admit I missed the clues, a bit, as to why one of the main characters was being such a b!tch, but understand most of my reading time these days is during my breaks at work, so I am both shoving food down my throat with one hand while trying to concentrate and hold a book in the other hand! I will give Mr. McCaffrey some points for explaining this person's behavior in a novel way, nearly at the very end of the novel. I am also enjoying little details in the earlier books being explained by events that occurred centuries earlier; it's \"throwing a bone\" to life-long fans. As the Pern releases from the 2000s are all new to me, I am enjoying experiencing this \"new chapter\" in an era of Pern we knew little about.\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nLove Pern, its dragons and dragon riders. It was a nice nostalgic visit to the world. The story made me want to reread the originals again.\n\nFebruary 10, 2008\n\nThe son playing in his revered mother's world of dragons. Well, I was somewhat disappointed, I must say. For my taste there was too much focus on the actual science of genetics. I don't think I needed to know all the nitty-gritty of gene-tracking, splicing... and everything else geneticists find so fascinating. I wanted more about the dragons, their riders, the Weyrfolk - everything that makes Pern, well... Pern! The characters were rather flat and I honestly didn't come across one that grabbed me with the need to hear his or her story. This is why I'd fallen away from Anne McCaffrey's own books. Less and less attention being paid to the dragonriders and their special bonds with their dragons or the intricacies of Guild Hall and Hold life. Less attention paid to the characters, period, as a matter of fact. Gone indeed are the days of Lessa, F'lar, F'nor, Robinton, Menolly, Piemur et al; and no one to take their places. Sadly.\n\nAugust 5, 2010\n\nTodd does not have Anne's magic. This book is obviously written by someone who has read a lot of Pern stories. The publisher was a bit too optimistic when they wrote that Todd brought fresh ideas to the series because he obviously didn't. This book is a hodge-podge collection of bits and pieces from previously published Pern books that Todd put together and it didn't quite gel. Thereby, for the long-time Pern fans, this book is a disappointment.\n\nJanuary 8, 2011\n\nThis one was just okay for me. Honestly, it felt more like a microbiology course than my beloved dragon stories. I want to read about dragronriders with a coming of age story. While this one was about Lorana and trying to save her dragon by learning from the past, it was kind of dull. I'm not sure I like having Ms. McCaffrey's son involved in the writing. His style is missing her special spark.\n\nMarch 24, 2017\n\nThe time travel aspect redeemed this from a one star rating. I believe the epidemic tragedy storyline has worn itself out for this series. It might be a different epidemic, a different time period on Pern, and different characters, but really... all that death, desperation, and tragedy wears on me. I'm going to pretend I quit reading at the end of the original story arc (before Todd McCaffrey got involved) and stop hoping that the new installments will be any good.\n\nJune 16, 2011\n\nOh gosh, another plague.... Does he realise that he doesn't have to write about plagues? There is some shit about Wind Blossom and how the Watchwhers were created and Boy Wonder (a.k.a. Kindan) makes is usual appearances.\n\nDO NOT BOTHER!!!!!!!\n\nAugust 25, 2016\n\nIn short, a much better effort upon Todd McCaffrey's part in regards to the Pern series, but not really bringing enough to stand apart.\n\nCertainly a more convoluted story that tries its best to deal with the ins and outs of time-travel, and character development is certainly better than his previous effort in Dragon's Kin. Todd tends to be less descriptive about scenes in general, and focuses more on dialogue, which in itself is not a bad thing, but sometimes it feels like a little more time setting a scene would help in certain situations.\n\nThe ending, however, feels rather abrupt; a notable pattern in all of his efforts in regards to his Pern stories. No one book ever feels like it is a story in and of itself, instead urging the reader to keep reading the series in order to find resolution to those elements that are left hanging at the end of each book. Given that the books are not written in chronological order, this makes for an unsatisfying reading experience in my opinion.\n\nAnother disappointment is the occasional glaring ret-con of certain details (the AIVAS acronym being different, for instance) that seems to undermine the lore of Anne's previous works.\n\nStill, worth a read, though once again technically inferior to Anne's efforts.\n\nFebruary 14, 2009\n\nOkay, the idea was interesting (a dragon plague), and I liked the way they tied the past to the present with the whole time travel thing. Also, pretty heart-wrenching in places. A good story overall.\n\nBut honestly, I have some words for Todd at this point. Todd, listen. Your mother built this incredible world and wrote some incredible stories about the people in it. There are rules in this world. You can write new things with new characters, that's okay. But you can't change the rules of reality on a whim like you did in this book. You got time travel wrong. Not just wrong, but BACKWARDS. I'm talking about the effects it has on people, and if I say more we're getting into spoiler county, but you and those who have read this one know what I mean.\n\nDon't change the rules, Todd. It makes people who look on the original works with fond nostalgia very angry. Worse, you seem to have done it in order to heighten the emotional impact of another event in the book. It would have been so much better if you had found another way to work that particular plot point.\n\nWhen I read this I started to worry about the direction Todd was taking the Pern universe.\n\nDecember 18, 2014\n\nI used to love the Pern books (before I developed a sense of literary style), and when I saw this one I thought I'd give them another try.\n\nFor a while I was thinking, \"This is spooky. He writes exactly like his mother - with all the faults as well.\" (For example, using incorrect words - someone burns charcoal in a \"grazier\", and someone else is \"dowsed\" - instead of \"doused\" - with water.)\n\nBut actually, this isn't up to Anne McCaffrey's standard. Sure, she's no literary giant, and she has inconsistencies in her long series, but this book just becomes more and more confusing as it goes along. There are far too many minor characters to keep track of, the body count just becomes tedious, the science is bogus, the plot is unconvincing and the time travel gets twisted into incomprehensible knots.\n\nI think what I missed most, though, is Anne McCaffrey's characterization. One of the things I liked most about her books was that her female characters were strong but feminine, and her male characters gentle but masculine. (Forgetting Killashandra, who was just a bitch.) Todd McCaffrey doesn't achieve this, or anything close to it.\n\nJune 8, 2012\n\nIt was wonderful to be back on Pern even if only for a day (because I just couldn't make the book last longer). I'd never have known this installment was written by Todd instead of Anne had the cover not loudly proclaimed it. The story was seamless, fitting like the perfect puzzle piece into the historical landscape of Pern. I loved meeting the descendants of Pern's first settlers, and I appreciated the creative solutions based on creative science to solve the crisis. No magic here! Perhaps the only thing better than discovering this book is discovering that it is part of a trilogy. Dragonheart, here I come.\n\nSeptember 22, 2007\n\nI was really craving fluff and I found this one. I was skeptical, but since Todd has published more than one Pern book, I took a chance.\n\nBy page 75 or so, I didn't remember that this wasn't Anne writing. Good story, good evocation of Pern. Doesn't disappoint!\n\nAnd perfect when you're craving some dragons...\n\nNovember 8, 2022\n\nOf all the Pern books I have read recently (at least those NOT written solely by Anne) this is by far the best. To begin with I just felt a bit tired of reading about yet another plague, even if this one seems effects Dragons rather than humans. but as the riders try to come up with ways to combat it and save Pern, I did get swept up with the story.\n\nI enjoyed the juxtaposition of the two storylines - one where failing technology and the loss of knowledge is causing issues, and the later one where the need for that knowledge is so pressing. It was a neat way to solve the two, with the two linked through Lorana and Wind Blossom, although it made for a bit of a 'pat' ending. I think I enjoyed the more day-to-day stuff.\n\nMy only real grip it that this is yet another story that is solved through the Dragon's ability to travel in time - it seems so well known and used all the time in Todd's books, that I'm not sure how he will explain why this skill becomes so unknown by the time we hit 'Dragonflight'. Oh well, a good excuse to read right on and find out.\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nAs someone who loves books, writing and anything to do with the written word, it is hard for me to write a bad review; particularly for Anne McCaffrey, who was, in part at least, involved with the writing of this book.\n\nI've loved the PERN series for years now. I love how the good and bad guys are clearly delineated, how the good guys always win, and how much thought has gone into worldbuilding. I loved Dragonflight with a passion, and Lessa and F'lar will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nThese last couple of books written by Todd though, miss the mark by a mile. Here are a few of my gripes:\n\n1. All the women characters seem disordered. The good ones can't seem to do any self-care: they can't eat unless they faint with hunger, can't sleep unless they're reminded to, and definitely can't take a break. Martyrs, each and every one of them. The ones painted as villains seem to suffer from borderline personality disorder.\n\n2. The. Men. Have. All. The. Power. Yes, I understand there is a certain internalised mysogyny in lovely Anne (most women of that era did), and it shows up in her writing. Even Lessa could be quieted by \"one look from F'lar\" despite the fact that she was the one who basically made it possible for PERN to survive thread, oh, and she did that *after* rescuing herself and her family holding from a bnonafide villain, and being a boss weyr woman. Dragonsblood though... ugh. The men make all the decisions. They ignore the women around them. They don't shy away from manhandling them when they can't seem to 'control' them: shaking, slapping, gripping hands in anger... Really? Use your words. Be like F'lar.\n\n3. The women have all the solutions, but they're too busy demurring to the men. All, save for Windblossom, but of course, she was an ancient elder... so she was allowed; you see? Everyone else needed to be reassured that they did really have the solutions, that they did really have these magnificent powers/abilities/brains/talent. They wouldn't know it unless the men told them. Ugh.\n\n4. The science is SO badly handled. What I loved about the PERN series is how well the science of it works. Everything clicks into place. With this one though, Todd wanted to show that he'd read a book or two on genetic engineering. Boring, unending explanations about the science, which made Zero sense. Todd would've been better served to remember that even Anne never bothered to explain how 'between' works, other than it only lasts as long as it takes to cough three times.\n\n5. The excruciating amount of description. By now, we know what sweet rolls are. Please, if you must tell us what's in them, layer it in with dialogue or as a part of the scenes. Paragraphs about spiced wherry, the smoothness of the weyr tunnels, the height of the weyr bowl, etc introduce drudgery to the readers' experience, not immersion.\n\nThe editor on this one needed to read the book, and needed to enforce the standards Anne set.\n\nJuly 26, 2015\n\nThis book weaves two stories and two time periods together. In 507, Thread is just beginning to fall but the dragons are getting sick. Lorana is the daughter of a herder and one of the population that survived a plague. She is a talented artist, a skilled healer, has impressed two fire lizards, and can speak to all dragons.\n\nLorana has set herself a goal of traveling around Pern and drawing pictures of all the life forms. To do this she boards a ship but has to escape it because the Captain wants more from her that her skills as a healer. After nearing death in a small boat in a storm, she sends her fire lizards away in hopes that they will survive. She is rescued by dragon riders and taken to Benden Weyr. Her skills let her impress a new queen at the latest hatching. But dragons are dying of some kind of disease. Lorana and Kindan are set to search the records that the Weyrs keep in hope of finding some information about this illness and some cure for it.\n\nThe other time period that is woven into this story is the year 57 at the end of the first Threadfall. Wind Blossom is one of the original settlers of Pern and is a noted geneticist. However, she is seeing that the technology is breaking down and the settlers are focusing on growing their population and expanding their territories. It won't take much time for most of the information not needed for immediate survival is lost.\n\nWhen a sick fire lizard - one of Lorana's - falls from the sky, Wind Blossom knows that the future of these genetically engineered dragons is in jeopardy. She has to come up with a cure and find some way to hide the knowledge so that it will be available in Lorana's time.\n\nThis is only the basics of the story. There is a jealous weyrwoman who resents Lorana's ability to talk to dragons and fears losing her power in the weyr. There are dragon riders in both time periods who are more focused on fighting thread now than in thinking ahead for the future. There is a romance.\n\nAll in all, this was a great story set in the world of Pern that shows a time that hadn't been explored before.\n\nSeptember 10, 2015\n\nThis story is really good, even if it's not my favorite.\n\nI love how Todd McCaffrey writes his stories because they fit perfectly in Pern's world. But this one didn't captivated me as much as his others novels. Perhaps because I didn't read it in the right chronological order so I already knew what will be next.\n\nThis story has to be read just before \"Dragonheart\" and certainly before \"Dragongirl\".\n\nLorana is the heroine of this novel, introducing us to Fiona - the main character of \"Dragonheart\" and \"Dragongirl\" - and allowing us to meet again Kindan - the hero of \"Dragon's Kin\", \"Dragon's Fire\" and \"Dragon Harper\".\n\nLorana, a young woman, who has the great gif of hearing and even feeling all the dragon of Pern, will have the great joy to Impress a Golden Queen. She will also have the terrible duty to find a cure to save all the dragons of Pern slaughtered by a plague just a little before the Red Star's return and the fall of Threads devastating everything if not burn.\n\nDuring her quest, she will find help thanks to Kitti Ping's daughter, Wind Blossom, who helped her mother to create the dragons. But how could Lorana be helped by someone who lived and died more than 500 years before?\n\nIt was really a brilliant idea to give us more of Wind Blossom (\"Dragondawn\"), M'tall and Torene's (\"First Fall - The Second Weyr\")stories. I really liked how they worked through time to the same purpose: save the dragons to allow Pern's population to survive the Threads.\n\nA really enjoyable read, particularly if in the good order that I probably will redo someday.\n\nJune 14, 2011\n\nThis is the first Pern book to be written solely by someone other than Anne McCaffrey. I'm not going to say it's great, but in all fairness, it's not bad either. Taking over someone else's creation is a lot of responsibility, especially when the original writer is your mum.\n\nWhere Todd succeeded in this book was the dragons. They are as comical, stoic, and loving as ever. My biggest gripe is the lack of emotion the characters displayed. Anne gave her characters a lot of time for grieving and affection and it was that I missed most. Since this is story is set earlier in Pern's history, I can assume the bond between dragon and rider strengthens with each generation, but the fact that many of the dragonriders lived on after their dragons died just wasn't consistent with Anne's portrayal. It would have helped too, if there was a list of characters in the back like Anne had with her books of who was from what hold or weyr, riders and their dragons, etc. Minor characters tended to flit back into the story after several chapters which had me flipping back to figure out who they were all over again. There are some other things I found lacking, but really, I did enjoy this book.\n\nGiven that Todd McCaffrey has a engineering background rather than a writing one, I think he did well on his first solo book. Does he still have some work to do? Of course and that comes with practice. Personally, I'm just glad we'll get more Pern books.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nSeptember 10, 2022\n\nWhile most of the plot seems entirely pointless, what really makes the story hardly bearable are all the logical inconsistencies and scientific misinformation scattered throughout it. I am still trying to recover from the unfathomable absurdity that this work of fiction calls a storyline, depending on cascades of the most unlikely events to get where it wants to go.\n\nIf at least the characters were charming. Sadly, despite the death and pain portrayed throughout this end-of-world story, all that untimely demise fails to evoke any emotion - simply because none of the characters had been brought to life to begin with. Their flatness and lack of development make them quite impossible to relate to or empathise with. So much misery. For nothing.\n\nIn case you are looking for an all-too-large number of the most forgettable and two-dimensional characters to ever have wandered a foreign planet, this book might be just for you.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 3, 2010\n\n• As this book is in the actual Dragonrider series it is filled with much more action than the last Pern book I read. It really is a page turner. It also opens up a lot of questions that can only be answered down the road in later books. One thing that will be interesting to me will be what the original books say about the first and the second pass of thread. There is a very strong cannon designed around this series, and it will be interesting to see what shaped the cannon for these earlier books in the timeline. Also, it will be interesting to see when A.M. decided to go back and do these. If some of the books written before Dragonsdawn have references to the events listed in these newer books, it would show some foreknowledge of what A.M. wanted to do."
