        "text": "After the Fall Is Over is a story in the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. Though the novel was announced, it was not published before Anne's death in 2011.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn May 2007, Anne announced that she planned to write a book that continued the story of F'lar and Lessa.\n\nAt 60,000 words around her birthday, she «got the urge», she told us, and finished the draft by the end of April. The working title given to us at Anne's birthday was «New Era, Pern»; but, a few days ago Anne told us she dubbed it «After the Fall».\n\n— Hans van der Boom, News Archive\n\nAround 2008, at the age of 82, Anne warned fans with whom she spoke that she might not be able to finish the book due to health problems. Anne passed away on November 21, 2011.\n\nIn his commentary after the death of Anne, Hans van der Boom, who apparently saw the manuscript or its fragments, said:\n\nI don't think Anne's latest book is ever to be published. I'm hesitant to talk about the plot and the story but I didn't like it and I did tell Anne. She had tried to get it publoished [sic] since 2007 and DelRey refused it twice, so the people at the publisher's obviously didn't believe in it.\n\n— An Anne McCaffrey Discussion Forum, June 22, 2012\n\nIn July 2012, Todd McCaffrey stated:\n\nI don’t know if «After the Fall is Over» will complete the story of Lessa and F'lar or merely expand it. The latest version of the manuscript is with Mum’s agent.\n\n— Todd McCaffrey answering reader questions, July 15, 2012\n\nAccording to Todd, both he and his sister Gigi have the right to continue the cycle. He considers Gigi to be a good writer and is looking forward to when she writes her first novel about Pern. They will not start thinking about the continuation of the novel After the Fall Is Over until after the release of Gigi's first book. Due to the moral pressure that Georges felt, she was in no hurry to release her book.\n\n— Todd McCaffrey answering reader questions: 1, 2 and 3, October 10, 2015\n\nGigi released her book Dragon's Code on October 2, 2018. Additional information about the work on After the Fall Is Over is not yet available."
