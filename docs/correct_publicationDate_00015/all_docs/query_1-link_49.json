Last updated 6 March 2024.\n\nThis is one of the last pages that I forgot to transfer over from my old website (third version).\n\nI read many of these lovely dragon books as a teenager / young adult.\n\nI‚Äôd love to add new recommendations (fiction and non-fiction) onto future dragon books related posts üìö\n\n1. Dragons, A Natural History by Dr. Karl Shuker\n\nHe‚Äôs an expert on dracontology‚Äîenough said. A real wealth of information here. One of the best.\n\n2. The Flight of Dragons by Peter Dickinson\n\nHighly recommended book, first published in 1979. The physics of flight, details of dragon evolution and specific techniques of\n\ndragon-slaying are discussed.\n\n3. Dragoncharm dragon books by Graham Edwards\n\nFrom the blurb: ‚ÄúThis special edition of the original 1995 novel features revised text and a new introduction by the author. Return to the days before man walked the earth, when the skies were filled with dragons. . .‚Äù\n\n4. The Book of the Dragon by Ciruelo Cabral\n\nA lavish book of illustrations by the Spanish artist. The scenes are accompanied with text explaining the dragon‚Äôs legends.\n\nAlso check out our Michael Jackson and Dragons post where the King of Pop was carrying a copy of this book.\n\n5. Here There Be Dragons by Jane Yolen\n\nA wonderful collection of published stories and poems by Jane Yolen, combined with realistic pencil illustrations. It‚Äôs one of those books that‚Äôs irresistable if you see it on a shelf or at a bookstore (or online).\n\n6. Pern Series by Anne McCaffrey\n\n[in recommended order of reading]: Dragonflight, Dragonquest, The White Dragon, Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, Dragondrums, Moreta:Dragonlady of Pern, Nerilkla‚Äôs Story & The Coelura, Dragonsdawn, The Renegades of Pern, All the Weyrs of Pern, The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall, The Dolphins of Pern, Red Star Rising [Dragonseye in the U.S], The Masterharper of Pern, The Skies of Pern\n\nOne of the most recommended and famous dragon books of all time. Readers are pulled into the world of Pern, and the series has captivated the imagination of booklovers worldwide. In the 2000‚Äôs, this series was the most recommended amongst Dragonsinn site visitors.\n\nYou can also check out our small collection of Pern dragon quotes.\n\n7. The Last Dragonlord by Joanne Bertin\n\n8. The Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia C. Wrede\n\n[in order]: Dealing With Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, Talking to Dragons\n\nFun and unique fantasy plots. Princess Cimoreen of Linderwall uses her quick wit and courage to deal, search and save the mostly kind dragons.\n\n9. Dragonlance Chronicles by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman\n\n[in order]: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning\n\n10. The Pit Dragon Chronicles by Jane Yolen\n\n[in order]: Dragon‚Äôs Blood, Heart‚Äôs Blood, A Sending of Dragons, Dragon‚Äôs Heart\n\nA wonderful and captivating series written with vivid descriptions and emotion revolving around 15-year old bonder Jakkin Stewart and the dragons on planet Austar.\n\n11. Dragon‚Äôs Bait by Vivian Vande Velde\n\nA relatively short book compared to others, but the plot is still exciting and humorous. The cool dragon, Selendrile, that can take the form of a human is unforgettable. One of my personal most favourite of dragon books, as well as all books!\n\n12. The Winterlands Series by Barbra Hambly\n\n13. Dragon Chronicles by Susan Fletcher\n\n[Dragon‚Äôs Milk, Flight of the Dragon Ryn, Sign of the Dove]\n\nYou can also check out our collection of quotes from Dragon‚Äôs Milk.\n\n14. The Ultimate Dragon (anthology)\n\nA compilation of stories written by some of the world‚Äôs leading authors like Tanith Lee, Ursula Le Guin and Harlan Ellison.\n\n15. The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nFeaturing Smaug the Famous!\n\n16. The Girl Who Heard Dragons by Anne McCaffrey\n\n17. The Dragon Prince by Laurence Yep\n\nChildren‚Äôs book. Superb artwork. It‚Äôs a Chinese ‚ÄòBeauty and the Beast‚Äô tale.\n\n18. Dragon Steel by Laurence Yep\n\n19. The Discovery of Dragons by Graeme Base\n\nFull of escapades and gripping encounters with dragons around the world. The huge full-color paintings of dragons, maps, and drawings are delightful as well.\n\n20. The Dragon Chronicles by Malcolm Sanders\n\nA wizard‚Äôs journal on the existence of dragons. Authenticity is complete with an old weathered-looking cover and paper made to look like parchment.\n\n21. Paint Your Dragon by Tom Holt\n\nVery funny in a black comedy kind of way. Basically it turns the idea of George and the dragon (good versus evil) on its head. The dragon is the good guy as are the demons on a busman‚Äôs holiday from hell! Well worth a read on a dull sunday afternoon and a lot lighter than the normal dragon novels. After all, dragons are worth a smile.\n\n‚Äì Recommended & reviewed by: Emma\n\n22. Eragon by Christopher Paolini\n\n23. Dragonology by Dr. Ernest Drake\n\nHere‚Äôs a very attractive encyclopaedia!\n\n24. The Realm of The Gods by Tamora Pierce\n\nIn the fourth book of The Immortals Quartet, the main character Daine is in the Dragonlands. This installment follows Emperor Mage (book 3), Wolf-Speaker (book 2), and Wild Magic (book 1). The second book also features a basilisk.\n\n‚Äì Recommended & reviewed by: Barbara Jordan\n\n25. The Dragon Nimbus trilogy by Irene Radford\n\n26. Dragons: The Greatest Stories (Hardcover) / Martin H. Greenberg (editor)\n\nFeatures a spectrum of stories from Ray Bradbury, Anne McCaffrey, Mickey Zucker Reichert, etc.\n\n27. The Game Master‚Äôs Book of Legendary Dragons\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never played Dungeons and Dragons before so for me, this was just a book of dragons to use for inspiration which is generally what I think the authors had in mind. The dragons featured in this book are meant for Dungeon Masters in D&D to use or at least inspire their games.\n\nFor me, I use it for inspiration for more literary work. . .The artwork and lore within this book is excellent and there‚Äôs many ways one can piecemeal these dragons together into something new for either a D&D raid or something more unique.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Review by jnatrain\n\n28. Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin (epic fantasy series)\n\nYou can also check out our Game of Thrones quotes.\n\n29. The Dragon of Mith by Kate Walker\n\nThe Dragon Mith is a novel for children. This book has its villains, wicked deeds and nail-biting moments, but at heart it‚Äôs a tale in which gentleness, understanding and good manners triumph. The book was first published in Australia in 1989 and was awarded second prize (an honour listing) in the Australian Children‚Äôs Book of the Year Awards ‚Äì Younger Readers."
