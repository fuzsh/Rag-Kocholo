        "text": "Collection inventory\n\nReturn to finding aids search\n\nAnne McCaffrey Papers\n\nAn inventory of her papers at Syracuse University\n\nFinding aid created by: SBM\n\nDate: 11 Feb 1970\n\nRevision history: EAD file created (MRR) related material, arrangement (MRC) additions processed, collection rehoused (MRC)\n\nOverview of the Collection\n\nCreator: McCaffrey, Anne. Title: Anne McCaffrey Papers Dates: 1947-1967 Quantity: 4.5 linear ft. Abstract: Correspondence, memorabilia, and writings. Language: English Repository: Special Collections Research Center,\n\nSyracuse University Libraries\n\n222 Waverly Avenue\n\nSyracuse, NY 13244-2010\n\nhttps://library.syracuse.edu/special-collections-research-center\n\nBiographical History\n\nAnne McCaffrey (1926-2011) was an American-Irish author, best known for her Dragonriders of Pern books (Dragonflight, Dragonquest, Dragonsinger, etc.). Many of her novels feature strong female characters; McCaffrey has been widely quoted as saying that her novel Restoree, for example, was intended as a rebuttal to the way women were usually portrayed in science fiction.\n\nShe has won numerous awards and accolades, including becoming the first woman to win a Hugo Award (1968) and the first to win a Nebula Award (1969). In 1999, she received the American Library Association's Margaret A. Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for teens. In 2005 she was named a Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2006. Since her death, her son Todd McCaffrey has continued writing books set in the Pern universe.\n\nScope and Contents of the Collection\n\nThe Anne McCaffrey Papers consist of correspondence, memorabilia and writings.\n\nThe small amount of Correspondence includes letters from author and editor John W. Campbell, as well as McCaffrey's agent Virginia Kidd. There are also a few other letters from publishers and editors. Miscellaneous correspondence includes a chatty personal letter from someone named Ida, evidently a close friend.\n\nMemorabilia is also quite small. It includes a few photographs and a cover from Analog Science Fiction, with one of McCaffrey's stories featured.\n\nWritings comprises the bulk of the collection. Here may be found drafts and working copy related to several of McCaffrey's books, including Decision at Doona, Dragonquest, Restoree, and The Ship Who Sang. Several of these have alternate early or working titles; for example, material filed under \"And all the weyrs of Pern\" and \"Weyrleader\" appears to consist largely of content that eventually became Dragonquest. Also in this series are extensive early drafts and working copy for a number of published and unpublished short stories, not all of which are science fiction, as well as a draft of McCaffrey's honors thesis on Russian science fiction author Yevgeny (Eugene) Zamiatin.\n\nArrangement of the Collection\n\nMaterial is arranged alphabetically by type and within that alphabetically by title.\n\nRestrictions\n\nAccess Restrictions:\n\nThe majority of our archival and manuscript collections are housed offsite and require advanced notice for retrieval.
