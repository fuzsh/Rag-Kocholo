        "text": "Anne McCaffrey Series\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern\n\nAnne McCaffrey is the queen of series, having several well-known science fiction and fantasy series to her credit. In latter years she tended to write with other authors such as Jody Lynn Nye, Elizabeth Moon, Margaret Ball and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough.\n\nHer series include the Pern books, the Crystal Singer stories, the Brain Ship stories, the Talents (psychic, Rowan, tower) series, the Petaybee series, the Acorna (unicorn girl) series, the Planet Pirates series, Dinosaur Planet and the Freedom's Landing series. Because McCaffrey has written the stories over quite a stretch of time, and moved back and forth along the time lines, there is some difficulty in recommending a reading order for her books.\n\nThere are more dragon-related titles on page 8.\n\nThe inhabitants of Pern live in a medieval society. Holds are managed by the Lord Holder, and major holds are also home to one of the Crafts. There is a traditional craft system of apprenticeship and journeyperson. Competent craftspeople are sent to other holds, large and small, to ply their crafts. The teacher of children is the role of the Harpers (singers).\n\nThe society practices a system of fosterage, exchanging children to spread skills.\n\nProtecting the holds are the dragonriders, each psychically linked to the dragon who 'chose' them. They are supported by the holds to enable them to maintain their skills and fight 'thread', a biological scourge that rains from the skies following a specific cycle.\n\nAs the series progresses, the inhabitants discover their ancestry, as colonists from another planet who chose to eventually lose their technologies, or to reinvent them into simpler forms.\n\nMcCaffrey created this series, in part, because of all the bad press they were getting.\n\nWhen we first encounter Lessa, the heroine of Dragonflight, she is plotting terrible revenge against Dax, the Lord Holder who murdered her family and held illegal reign over the hold of Ruatha. Lessa is the quintessential McCaffrey heroine, small, vengeful, quick-tempered, bright, and destined to be the second-in-command/helpmate to the man she helps gain power.\n\nThe series also slowly makes some progress in the roles of women in Pern society. For example, Menolly the singer and composer has a chance to learn her craft, and to be recognised as competent.\n\nThis is a very successful series, and suitable for all ages.\n\nThis reading order (provided in personal correspondence between Anne McCaffrey and Ali Kayn) is not chronological in Pern time, it is in the order McCaffrey recommended, moving through the timeline as the story of Pern unfolds.\n\nAnne McCaffrey writes:\n\nNote: Dragonflight, Dragonquest And The White Dragon constitute the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy and the short story called 'A Time When' is included in The White Dragon.\n\nDragonsong, Dragonsinger, and Dragondrums comprise the Harper Hall trilogy.\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady Of Pern takes place historically before the two series.\n\nDespite the chronological spread in the three novels, Dragonsdawn, Renegades Of Pern, and All The Weyrs Of Pern should be considered a third Pern trilogy.\n\nSummary:\n\nDragonflight\n\nDragonquest\n\nDragonsong\n\nDragonsinger\n\nThe White Dragon\n\nDragondrums\n\nThe Smallest Dragonboy\n\n(short story)\n\nMoreta, Dragonlady of Pern\n\nNerilka's Story\n\nDragonsdawn\n\nThe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall\n\nDragon's Eye aka Red Star Rising\n\nThe Girl Who Heard Dragons\n\nThe Renegades of Pern\n\nMasterharper of Pern\n\nRunner of Pern\n\nAll the Weyrs of Pern\n\nThe Dolphins of Pern\n\nThe Skies of Pern\n\nA Gift of Dragons\n\nDragon's Kin\n\nBeyond Between (Short story)\n\nBuy Online\n\nAmazon.com\n\nBuy Online\n\nAmazon.com\n\nBuy Online\n\nAmazon.com\n\nBooks by Todd McCaffrey\n\nAfter this point, the involvement by Ms McCaffrey is unknown. Anne McCaffrey died in 2011."
