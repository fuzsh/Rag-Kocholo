        "text": "Todd McCaffrey is good, though not quite the same as Anne, I guess he'll get better the more he writes. Would I recommend his books, Yes, I would. I have read two of his now.\n\nI have recently finished Dragonheart. I enjoyed reading it.\n\nI liked most of Anne's books, but must admit The Dinosaur Planet ones, nor the Acorna series (though the first one was O.K.) were very good.\n\nMy favourites are the Pern series. Dragonflight, Dragonsinger, The White Dragon & Dragonquest are my all time favourites. But all couldn't be put down.\n\nI see what you mean about some being capable of being read by older children, Swreader. I don't think any of her books are the least like Sir Terry's though. Anne, to me, hasn't the same sense of fun, her books are more serious. In a way, her characters are more believable. This is just my opinion.\n\nI did discover Anne McCaffrey many years ago now & have only in the last couple of years discovered Terry Pratchett.\n\nI rather liked the parody on the dragons in Colour of Magic.\n\nI'm an Anne fan too, started off with the Dragons, then found the Crystal Singer tales. Love the Petaybee stories.\n\nNot keen on the Catteni tales, the Dinosaur Planet ones continued into The Planet Pirates series and not really my cuppa Klah.\n\nThe Acorna ones are beginning to slip, I feel. Loved the series that developed from The Ship Who Sang. Also love the series which started with To Ride Pegasus, and developed into the Tower stories.\n\nMy faves though are tha Doona/Rrala stories, only three, unfortunately, and a standalone title which I would have loved to see developed further, published in the States as The Lady, in the UK as The Carradine Touch. Not science-fiction at all, but rather a fairly modern horse story based around the founding of the Irish Horse Board, (Bord NaG Capall).\n\nUnfortunately, I feel that as Anne has loosened the reins on Acorna to Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, the tales are slipping away from the original intent. I feel that the same happened with The Planet Pirates.\n\nJust my particular feelings on these,\n\nVena Ravenhaired said:\n\nI rather liked the parody on the dragons in Colour of Magic.\n\nI'm an Anne fan too, started off with the Dragons, then found the Crystal Singer tales.

I did read it a long time ago, but can't remember what it was about now & I thought I had the book but can't find it.\n\nThere was another she wrote, which I also haven't read, called A Gift Of Dragons.\n\nI did think the parody on the dragons very funny."
