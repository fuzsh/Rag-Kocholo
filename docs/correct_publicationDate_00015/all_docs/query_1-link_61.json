The writing style is very easy to read and therefore I didn’t struggle getting into this book even though I was in a reading slump before starting it. \n\nAt first, I was expecting this book to be very predictable. However, what I liked the most about this novel is that it kept surprising me. There were lots of plot twists that I absolutely didn’t see coming and that made the reading experience very exciting.\n\nHowever, there were a few things that I didn’t like as much. The main problem of this book is that the pacing is a bit off. Some  important things happen really fast or even off-camera/page, but then some scenes are unnecessarily long. The whole way the book is told feels a bit superficial. That made it especially difficult to connect to the characters and took some excitement away from important moments. But overall, I still had a good time with this book and am very greatful that it helped me overcome my reading slump.\n.\nWhich are your favorite dragon books? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #fantasybooks #bookstagramgermany #shelfie #bookreview #dragons #dragonflight #dragonridersofpern #threestars #instareads #bookrecommendations #annemccaffrey #books #bücher #libros\".",
