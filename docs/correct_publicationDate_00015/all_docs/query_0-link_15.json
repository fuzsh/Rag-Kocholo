It was first published by Smart Pop/BenBella Books in August 2013, edited by Todd McCaffrey, and cover by Michael Whelan. This book is not part of the Dragonriders of Pern series.\n\nAn audio version of the book was published in 2013 by Brilliance Audio, Inc. It was narrated by Emily Durante, Mel Foster, Janis Ian, Todd McCaffrey[1]\n\nSummary[]\n\nWhen Anne McCaffrey passed in November 2011, it was not only those closest to her who mourned her death; legions of readers also felt the loss deeply. The pioneering science fiction author behind the Dragonriders of Pern series crafted intricate stories, enthralling worlds, and strong heroines that profoundly impacted the science fiction community and genre.\n\nIn Dragonwriter: A Tribute to Anne McCaffrey and Pern, Anne's son and Pern writer Todd McCaffrey collects memories and stories about the beloved author, along with insights into her writing and legacy, from those who knew her best. Nebula Award-winner Elizabeth Moon relates the lessons she learned from Pern's Lessa (and from Lessa's creator); Hugo Award-winner David Brin recalls Anne's steadfast belief that the world to come will be better than the one before; legendary SFF artist Michael Whelan shares (and tells stories about) never-before-published Pern sketches from his archives[2]; and more. Jody Lynn Nye Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, another Nebula Award winner, The Dragonlady's Songs[3]\n\nJoin Anne's co-writers, fellow science fiction authors, family, and friends in remembering her life and exploring how her mind and pen shaped not only the Weyrs of Pern, but also the literary landscape as we know it.[4]\n\nContributors include:\n\nAngelina Adams\n\nDavid Brin\n\nDavid Gerrold\n\nJohn Goodwin\n\nJanis Ian\n\nAlec Johnson\n\nGeorgeanne Kennedy\n\nMercedes Lackey\n\nSharon Lee and Steve Miller\n\nLois McMaster Bujold\n\nElizabeth Moon\n\nCharlotte Moore\n\nRobert Neilson\n\nJody Lynn Nye and Bill Fawcett\n\nRobin Roberts\n\nElizabeth Ann Scarborough\n\nWen Spencer\n\nMichael Whelan\n\nRichard J.
