These include many in the Dragonriders of Pern series. She was active in writing from 1967 up to her death in 2011.\n\nBorn in Massachusetts, McCaffrey was raised by parents of Irish and English descent. A graduate of Radcliffe College, she was particularly interested in classic works and histories. She started writing in the 1950s and had a few short stories published. She was interested in stories about fantasy and understanding the future. She particularly worked as a secretary and treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America in the late 1960s.\n\nOver the years McCaffrey created a variety of book series including the Dragonriders of Pern series and the Talents and Acrona series. Many of her works were written alongside her son Todd McCaffrey and fellow writer Elizabeth Ann Scarborough. The Dragonriders of Pern series is particularly famous for highlighting a pre-industrial community that uses many fire-breathing dragons to defend its land.\n\nMcCaffrey died in 2011 after more than twenty books in the Dragonriders series were written. Todd McCaffrey continues to work on the series to this day. It continues to be a popular series and has especially taken on a new life as the Game of Thrones series and other fantasy novels have become rather popular in pop culture in recent time.\n\nAnne McCaffrey Awards\n\nAnne McCaffrey was the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award. Dragonflight, the 1968 novel that started the Dragonriders of Pern series, won both of those awards in that year. Many other books in that series, particularly the White Dragon and All the Weyrs of Pern, were Hugo award finalists.\n\nIn 1999, McCaffrey received the Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association. The award is a lifetime achievement honor given to those who write for young adults and teens. She is also enshrined in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.\n\nAnne McCaffrey Books Into Movies\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern series had been optioned into production for a film in the past but nothing has come out of it.

Sarah Cornwell, an author best known for the book What I Had Before I Had You, has been signed to be the screenwriter for this film.\n\nBest Anne McCaffrey Books\n\nMany of the books that Anne McCaffrey has written are important to the evolution of science fiction and fantasy.
