        "text": "Anne Inez McCaffrey was an American born Irish writer. She was born on the 1st April 1926 and passed on on 21st November 2011. She is best known for her science fiction series known as the Dragonriders of Pern. She was an author who depicted alien creatures and new worlds. She is a complex figure who creates and recreates her fiction by drawing from life experiences.\n\nShe was a student at Stuart Hall Girls’ Boarding school I Virginia from 1942 to 1943. In 1944, she joined Radcliffe College where she studied cartography, Celtic Folldore, Chinese philosophers, English literature, Russian and Slavonic languages. She graduated with a BA in 1947 from Radcliffe College.\n\nShe married Wright Johnson in 1950 whom she had met in 1949. She also began her writing career in that same year. Her first story, “Freedom of the Race” in science fiction plus was published in 1953. It is a story about women being impregnated by aliens.\n\n“The Greatest Love,” her second story was written in 1955 but was never published until after twenty two years.\n\nHer second story, “Lady in a Tower” in fantasy and science fiction was published in 1959.

Anne McCaffrey herself said that she thought of the story when wishing herself alone.\n\nHer third story, “The Ship who Sang” was published in 1963. This was the beginning of the ship series. This is one of her most famous series which culminates with the 1969 “The Ship who sang.”\n\nIn 1966, she became the secretary/treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America.\n\n“The Ship who Mourned,” her fourth story was published in 1966.\n\n“The Ship who Killed” which was her fifth story was published in the late 1966.\n\nHer first novel, the Restoree was published in 1967.

She is abducted by the Mil, alien creatures that eat human flesh. She is however kept alive but with her skin removed. She stays in that condition until the alien ship she is in is captured by humans from the planet Lothar. Due to her lack of skin, the Lotharians mistake her for one of their own and they perform controversial restoration procedures on her.\n\nWhen she finally comes back to her senses, she is in a mental hospital in Lothar but she doesn’t have memory of what happened. She also has very little knowledge of the local language. She is treated as though she was retarded in the institution and is given menial tasks to do just like the other restorees who were salvaged from Mil ships. She is tasked to care for Harlan, the deposed planetary regent. Harlan is being drugged into a moronic state. On realizing what is being done, she helps him recover his senses and they both escape the institution. The two later gain advantage over Harlan’s political enemies. They are able to defeat Mil and later solve some of the domestic problems of the Lotharians. The story ends with the two falling in love.\n\nShe filed for divorce in 1970 from her first husband and remarried that same year. In 1971, one short story and three novels were published.
