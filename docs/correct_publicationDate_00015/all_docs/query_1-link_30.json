        "text": "I sympathize with Raven, though. I mean, here's AMcC been writing for years, an extremely popular author with a well-thought-out, complete world, yet no film. Along comes this Paolini kid, writes an extremely derivative novel, full of characters and events pinched from just about every established writer he's ever read, and Bang! they're falling over themselves to make a film out of it. Hardly seems fair, does it?\n\nAh well. From the reviews I've seen of Eragon, (the film) they seem to have made a right hash of the book anyway, so maybe when Pern does eventually come to the silver screen, people will flock to see a decent dragon film. I do hope it's Dragonflight, though: the first scene at Ruatha Hold would make a great opening.\n\nI must admit, when I saw the trailers for Eragon, I instantly thought of Anne's Pern series. I'm glad, too, that a film is due to be made about the dragonriders of Pern, but I'm not sure which one they'd start with. Would it be Dragonflight or Dragonsdawn?\n\nUnfortunately, if I were a movie studio I'd probably have to go with Dragonsdawn. It chronologically is the beginning of the story. It would also end with a huge special effects sequence and I'm sure they would ham up the romance. It would all fit in one movie and set things up for future movies.\n\nBUT, I would rather have the first movie be Dragonflight. Discovering this whole strange world by being immersed in it. It would turn off some people, but it's really kind of cool. Kind of like how the Star Wars movie New Hope starts you out in the middle of this elaborate new world in the middle of the story.\n\nI can picture some great cinematic scenes, but from the movie studio perspective there isn't a ton of action in Dragonflight and a lot would have to be cut and reworked to speed things up. Some of the wonder related to the past may get lost (even if it's the first movie).\n\nHmm . . Dragonflight might almost be better as a short TV series (kind of like the Sopranos or the new Dr. Who) something with only 13 or so episodes with high production value.\n\nThe trouble with Dragonsdawn is that you only see the dragons at the end. Granted, you have the firelizards and thread, but it's not quite the same thing, is it?\n\nThat's true, though I'm sure they could rewrite it a bit.\n\nI wonder how they'd handle the whole dragon reproductive thing . . ?\n\nWould they ham it up for the sex or would they try to make it a more family orientated movie and maybe half way ignore it . . I'd hope for the family orientated approach. That whole aspect of it . . thought important to the plot\n\n. . never really seemed great.\n\nDon't dumb it down. One reason why Ron Moore nixed the Pern series that was in the making a few years ago was the networks wanted to make the show too family friendly, and good for him. I don't understand why just because a show has dragons in it, it has to be suitable for children, I really don't. That's why I'd rather see it as a movie: make it NC-17 if you have to, but show the matings as they're written, dammit! That said, the greenrider matings, especially involving only male riders, are only hinted at even in the books (I don't think Anne is very comfortable writing gay sex), but at the very least, show riders crowding into the room together. The heterosexual matings should be shown, it doesn't have to be more graphical than Anne wrote it by any means, but don't cut it completely, or people who haven't read the books won't understand how all-encompassing the dragon-rider bond really is.\n\nWho ever makes the movie could always ask Anne McCaffrey to make a new book. Not to pick on her too much, but she does seem to enjoy rewriting her own existing stories (granted it's usually done from a different perspective and probably doesn't contradict the previous stories).\n\nHonestly, manephelien aside from the sex there doesn't seem to be a ton of stuff that makes the Pern stories racy at all. It's interesting that what you see as an essential aspect always felt tacked on too me.\n\nAnother thing that might be a little bit un-family is the violence. Yet, the violence in the book is probably less than a 10th of what mainstream TV and movies have. The movie couldn't be G ratted, but it would be an easy PG.\n\n*blinks* Well... In my opinion IF they made Pern into a movie they should do the Dragonriders of Pern trilogy with Lessa's Journey and everything. they don't have to show dragon mating if they do it right. I mean Lessa\n\ndoesn't even become a weyr leader untill the middle of all that.\n\nIf they followed lessa's story they could really make a decent movie or two.*blinks* I do like the idea of a series better we'fd see more of the limitlessness of Pern as a whole. Plus there'd be a greater amoutn of Anne Mc Caffery's details included.\n\nTo compare Eragon to PErn...I think i'd rather laugh for like an hour.*shakes head* it may have a movie about it but like pyan said of reviews They murdered the story on Screen. while it was nice visually it wasn't the story of Eragon at all.*shrugs* I read the book only to compare it to the movie and *shudders* If I ever saw Pern on screen in such a way I'd blanch. IF they make A movie of any of the Pern Stories I'd want them done right and not .... heh well if you've actually read and seen Eragon you know what I mean.\n\nMaybe it wouldn't be so bad if George Lucas did the film or something but*shrugs* again my Opinion.\n\nOn another point>> I'd rather not have it all in CG if possible. I mean sure alot of it would have to be but things are so over hyped in CGI these days it's a wonder they think things look very realistic at all."
