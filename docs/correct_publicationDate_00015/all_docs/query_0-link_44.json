        "text": "Anne McCaffrey (1926-2011) was an American-Irish novelist of science fiction, fantasy and planetary romance. She is best known for her Dragonriders of Pern series and the novel The Ship Who Sang. She got the inspiration for another one of her well known novels, Restoree, when she saw how women were portrayed in science fiction, while their men would be the ones fighting the aliens, thus it was important to her to create a stronger female lead character. McCaffrey would receive dozens among dozens of awards for her work and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2006. She died at age 85 from a stroke.\n\nAnne McCaffrey started writing short stories in the 1950s. Her first novel published was Dragonflight, which came out in 1968.
