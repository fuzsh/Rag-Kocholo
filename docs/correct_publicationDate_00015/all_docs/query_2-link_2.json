There are always surprises at this stage and Dragon Blood was no exception. I hadn't really meant the book to be quite as dark as it was -- though I have to admit I was writing it with the aim of writing a book that neither my worst critics nor my most devoted readers could call light. (Sometime I'm going to write my diatribe on \"light fantasy\" -- which I think most reviewers really define as any fantasy written by a non-bestselling author in which less than half the characters die. I really wouldn't mind the designation if it weren't used so disparaging.) I had hoped for a dark book, but with my proclivity for humor at odd moments I didn't think I'd manage it. You're the final judge, of course, but I think this one qualifies as dark fantasy. Maybe someone will call it \"light dark fantasy\".\n\nDarkness isn't all it has going for it, IMHO. I was really amazed by how well the romance in this one worked -- given the trouble I had with it while I was writing it. The scenes were fine, but for most of the time this was in manuscript form the pacing was off."
