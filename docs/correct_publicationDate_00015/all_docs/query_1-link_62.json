        "text": "Over the last couple of months, I have noticed an increase in fiction books about dragons at the library. The increase in interest for dragon books is prevalent at book stores and on social media as well. While some of this can be attributed to the release of Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros in May 2023 (book one in the Empyrean series), this interest in dragons has been around for decades. Below I have gathered a list of fiction books about dragons for adults and young adults that I hope you will enjoy!\n\nThis is by no means a complete list of dragon books that the Davenport Public Library owns, but none of these titles have been talked about on the blog before. These titles are all first books in the series. All titles are also owned by the Davenport Public Library as of the date of this writing. The descriptions are provided by the publisher or author.\n\nIf you have a favorite piece of dragon fiction, let us know in the comments!\n\nAdult Fiction\n\nDragonfall by L.R. Lam – book one in the Dragon Scales series\n\nLong ago, humans betrayed dragons, stealing their magic and banishing them to a dying world. Centuries later, their descendants worship dragons as gods. But the “gods” remember, and they do not forgive.\n\nThief Arcady scrapes a living on the streets of Vatra. Desperate, Arcady steals a powerful artifact from the bones of the Plaguebringer, the most hated person in Lumet history. Only Arcady knows the artifact’s magic holds the key to a new life among the nobles at court and a chance for revenge.\n\nThe spell connects to Everen, the last male dragon foretold to save his kind, dragging him through the Veil. Disguised as a human, Everen soon learns that to regain his true power and form and fulfil his destiny, he only needs to convince one little thief to trust him enough to bond completely–body, mind, and soul—and then kill them.\n\nYet the closer the two become, the greater the risk both their worlds will shatter. – DAW\n\n_________________\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey – collects the first three books in The Dragonriders of Pern series (Dragonflight, Dragonquest, and The White Dragon)\n\nFinally together in one volume, the first three books in the world’s most beloved science fiction series, The Dragonriders of Pern, by Anne McCaffrey, one of the great science fiction writers of all time: Dragonflight, Dragonquest, The White Dragon. Those who know these extraordinary tales will be able to re-visit with Lessa, F’lar, Ruth, Lord Jaxon, and all the others. And for those just discovering this magical place, there are incomparable tales of danger, deceit, and daring, just waiting to be explored – Ballantine Books\n\n_________________\n\nEbony Gate by Julia Vee and Ken Bebelle – book one in the Phoenix Hoard series\n\nEmiko Soong belongs to one of the eight premier magical families of the world. But Emiko never needed any magic. Because she is the Blade of the Soong Clan. Or was. Until she’s drenched in blood in the middle of a market in China, surrounded by bodies and the scent of blood and human waste as a lethal perfume.\n\nThe Butcher of Beijing now lives a quiet life in San Francisco, importing antiques. But when a shinigami, a god of death itself, calls in a family blood debt, Emiko must recover the Ebony Gate that holds back the hungry ghosts of the Yomi underworld. Or forfeit her soul as the anchor.\n\nWhat’s a retired assassin to do but save the City by the Bay from an army of the dead? – Tor Books\n\n_________________\n\nThe Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter – book one in the Burning series\n\nThe Omehi people have been fighting an unwinnable war for almost two hundred years. The lucky ones are born gifted. One in every two thousand women has the power to call down dragons. One in every hundred men is able to magically transform himself into a bigger, stronger, faster killing machine.\n\nEveryone else is fodder, destined to fight and die in the endless war.\n\nYoung, gift-less Tau knows all this, but he has a plan of escape. He’s going to get himself injured, get out early, and settle down to marriage, children, and land. Only, he doesn’t get the chance.\n\nThose closest to him are brutally murdered, and his grief swiftly turns to anger. Fixated on revenge, Tau dedicates himself to an unthinkable path. He’ll become the greatest swordsman to ever live, a man willing to die a hundred thousand times for the chance to kill the three who betrayed him. – Orbit\n\n_________________\n\nThe Ruin of Kings by Jenn Lyons – book one in the Chorus of Dragons series\n\nWhen destiny calls, there’s no fighting back.\n\nKihrin grew up in the slums of Quur, a thief and a minstrel’s son raised on tales of long-lost princes and magnificent quests. When he is claimed against his will as the missing son of a treasonous prince, Kihrin finds himself at the mercy of his new family’s ruthless power plays and political ambitions.\n\nPractically a prisoner, Kihrin discovers that being a long-lost prince is nothing like what the storybooks promised. The storybooks have lied about a lot of other things, too: dragons, demons, gods, prophecies, and how the hero always wins.\n\nThen again, maybe he isn’t the hero after all. For Kihrin is not destined to save the world.\n\nHe’s destined to destroy it. – Tor Books\n\n_________________\n\nTo Shape a Dragon’s Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose – book one in the Nampeshiweisit series\n\nThe remote island of Masquapaug has not seen a dragon in many generations—until fifteen-year-old Anequs finds a dragon’s egg and bonds with its hatchling. Her people are delighted, for all remember the tales of the days when dragons lived among them and danced away the storms of autumn, enabling the people to thrive. To them, Anequs is revered as Nampeshiweisit—a person in a unique relationship with a dragon.\n\nUnfortunately for Anequs, the Anglish conquerors of her land have different opinions. They have a very specific idea of how a dragon should be raised, and who should be doing the raising—and Anequs does not meet any of their requirements. Only with great reluctance do they allow Anequs to enroll in a proper Anglish dragon school on the mainland. If she cannot succeed there, her dragon will be killed.\n\nFor a girl with no formal schooling, a non-Anglish upbringing, and a very different understanding of the history of her land, challenges abound—both socially and academically. But Anequs is smart, determined, and resolved to learn what she needs to help her dragon, even if it means teaching herself. The one thing she refuses to do, however, is become the meek Anglish miss that everyone expects.\n\nAnequs and her dragon may be coming of age, but they’re also coming to power, and that brings an important realization: the world needs changing—and they might just be the ones to do it. – Del Rey\n\n_________________\n\nYoung Adult Fiction\n\nBlazewrath Games by Amparo Ortiz – book one in the Blazewrath Games series\n\nExperience the World Cup with dragons in this debut fantasy, set in an alternate contemporary world, in which riders and their steeds compete in an international sports tournament.\n\nLana Torres has always preferred dragons to people. In a few weeks, sixteen countries will compete in the Blazewrath World Cup, a tournament where dragons and their riders fight for glory in a dangerous relay. Lana longs to represent her native Puerto Rico in their first ever World Cup appearance, and when Puerto Rico’s Runner―the only player without a dragon steed―is kicked off the team, she’s given the chance.\n\nBut when she discovers that a former Blazewrath superstar has teamed up with the Sire―a legendary dragon who’s cursed into human form―the safety of the Cup is jeopardized. The pair are burning down dragon sanctuaries around the world and refuse to stop unless the Cup gets cancelled. All Lana wanted was to represent her country. Now, to do that, she’ll have to navigate an international conspiracy that’s deadlier than her beloved sport. – Amparo Ortiz\n\n_________________\n\nEragon by Christopher Paolini – book one in the Inheritance Cycle\n\nWhen fifteen-year-old Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy. But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon soon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.\n\nOvernight his simple life is shattered, and, gifted with only an ancient sword, a loyal dragon, and sage advice from an old storyteller, Eragon is soon swept into a dangerous tapestry of magic, glory, and power. Now his choices could save—or destroy—the Empire. – Knopf Books for Young Readers\n\n_________________\n\nFireborne by Rosaria Munda – book one in the Aurelian Cycle\n\nAnnie and Lee were just children when a brutal revolution changed their world, giving everyone–even the lowborn–a chance to test into the governing class of dragonriders.\n\nNow they are both rising stars in the new regime, despite backgrounds that couldn’t be more different. Annie’s lowborn family was executed by dragonfire, while Lee’s aristocratic family was murdered by revolutionaries. Growing up in the same orphanage forged their friendship, and seven years of training have made them rivals for the top position in the dragonriding fleet.\n\nBut everything changes when survivors from the old regime surface, bent on reclaiming the city.\n\nWith war on the horizon and his relationship with Annie changing fast, Lee must choose to kill the only family he has left or to betray everything he’s come to believe in. And Annie must decide whether to protect the boy she loves . . . or step up to be the champion her city needs. – Penguin Books\n\n_________________\n\nRebelwing by Andrea Tang – book one in the Rebelwing series\n\nThings just got weird for Prudence Wu.\n\nOne minute, she’s cashing in on a routine smuggling deal. The next, she’s escaping enforcers on the wings of what very much appears to be a sentient cybernetic dragon.\n\nPru is used to life throwing her some unpleasant surprises–she goes to prep school, after all, and selling banned media across the border in a country with a ruthless corporate government obviously has its risks. But a cybernetic dragon? That’s new.\n\nShe tries to forget about the fact that the only reason she’s not in jail is because some sort of robot saved her, and that she’s going to have to get a new side job now that enforcers are on to her. So she’s not exactly thrilled when Rebelwing shows up again.\n\nEven worse, it’s become increasingly clear that the rogue machine has imprinted on her permanently, which means she’d better figure out this whole piloting-a-dragon thing–fast. Because Rebelwing just happens to be the ridiculously expensive weapon her government needs in a brewing war with its neighbor, and Pru’s the only one who can fly it.\n\nSet in a wonderfully inventive near-future Washington, D.C., this hilarious, defiant debut sparkles with wit and wisdom, deftly exploring media consumption, personal freedoms, and the weight of one life as Pru, rather reluctantly, takes to the skies. – Razorbill\n\n_________________\n\nSo Let Them Burn by Kamilah Cole – book one in the Divine Traitors series\n\nFaron Vincent can channel the power of the gods. Five years ago, she used her divine magic to liberate her island from its enemies, the dragon-riding Langley Empire. But now, at seventeen, Faron is all powered up with no wars to fight. She’s a legend to her people and a nuisance to her neighbors.\n\nWhen she’s forced to attend an international peace summit, Faron expects that she will perform tricks like a trained pet and then go home. She doesn’t expect her older sister, Elara, forming an unprecedented bond with an enemy dragon—or the gods claiming the only way to break that bond is to kill her sister.\n\nAs Faron’s desperation to find another solution takes her down a dark path, and Elara discovers the shocking secrets at the heart of the Langley Empire, both must make difficult choices that will shape each other’s lives, as well as the fate of their world. – Little, Brown Books for Young Readers"
