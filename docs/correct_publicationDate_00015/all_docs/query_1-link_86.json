        "text": "Anne McCaffrey’s son has written this newest book in the Dragonriders of Pern series. Danger threatens as dragons fall ill with an unknown sickness that is devastating the weirs and thus depleting Pern’s primary defense against Threadfall. The search for a cure lies in the knowledge and skill of a geneticist who was one of the original settlers over 500 years earlier and who was instrumental in the creation of the dragons and the fire lizards. Dick Hill returns to the series, and his narration is familiar and comfortable. He draws out the personalities of the characters, as well as their relationships and conflicts. Gentle reverberation is used to set apart the speech between dragon and rider. J.E.M. 2006 Audie Award Finalist © AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine [Published: AUG/SEP 05]"
