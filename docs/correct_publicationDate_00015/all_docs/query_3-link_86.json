        "text": "Good Omens\n\nBy Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman,\n\nFrom my list on unconventional YA apocalyptic fantasy.\n\nBy Linda Lee Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs we watch the news–the increasing number of earthquakes, volcanoes, wars, inflation, the rapid progress of AI, unelected elites deciding they know best for the world, and more–we don’t know how to process it all, and it leaves us feeling anxious. My passion for helping my readers not just escape but actually live better fuels me. I created this retelling of the Book of Revelations from the POV of celestial warriors and fallen angels in the unseen realms of our world to allow my readers to “make more sense” of the world and be at peace.\n\nLinda's book list on unconventional YA apocalyptic fantasy\n\nWhy did Linda love this book?\n\nThe premise of a fussy angel and a fast-living demon positions the book with humor, which I absolutely loved. As the plot unfolds, we discover that these two figures have been living on Earth for thousands of years and enjoying it. So when the demon receives word that the Apocalypse is upon them, they conspire together to subvert the ancient prophecy that predicts the world's end. LOL\n\nThe ingenuity and cleverness of these authors are top-notch, starting with the character names: The demon character is Crawley. If you recall, Satan was made a snake in the Garden of Eden after tempting Adam and Eve. But it doesn’t stop there. Crawley creates a motorway that emanates evil, with all of the issues associated with that. LOL.\n\nBy Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n18 authors picked Good Omens as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTHE BOOK BEHIND THE AMAZON PRIME/BBC SERIES STARRING DAVID TENNANT, MICHAEL SHEEN, JON HAMM AND BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH\n\n'Ridiculously inventive and gloriously funny' Guardian\n\nWhat if, for once, the predictions are right, and the Apocalypse really is due to arrive next Saturday, just after tea?\n\nIt's a predicament that Aziraphale, a somewhat fussy angel, and Crowley, a fast-living demon, now find themselves in. They've been living amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and, truth be told, have grown rather fond of the lifestyle and, in all honesty, are not actually looking forward to the coming Apocalypse.\n\nAnd then there's the small…\n\nPreview\n\nA Discovery of Witches\n\nBy Deborah Harkness,\n\nFrom my list on begin to exhibit supernatural powers.\n\nBy Patrick R. Field Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrom the first time I saw the sitcoms of the 1960s that featured paranormal characters like Bewitched, The Munsters, and I Dream of Jeannie, I have been fascinated by what it would be like to have supernatural powers like telekinesis, teleportation, shapeshifting, and clairvoyance. When I started writing fictional novels, after a long career of writing fact-based scientific articles for the academic press, I knew the genre of paranormal fantasy was the one that I wanted to contribute to. Every one of my novels thus far has included characters with supernatural powers like those that I observed and studied on television as a child.\n\nPatrick's book list on begin to exhibit supernatural powers\n\nWhy did Patrick love this book?\n\nI love this novel because it features a witch and a vampire in a romantic and sexually active relationship—so hot! Since I was a little boy, I have dreamed that these extraordinary organisms could live in harmonious familial relationships, a la The Munsters.\n\nI also love that both protagonists are academics and scientists, blending the laws of the natural world with the metaphysical, as I do in my own writing. When the scholar discovers an ancient alchemy book, it thrusts her into her familial legacy of witchcraft, and she becomes a type of savior for both the witch and vampire races.\n\nThe theme of discovering hibernating supernatural powers! Deborah Harkness remembered my name a year later when I attended a signing for her second book. Color me impressed.\n\nBy Deborah Harkness,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n18 authors picked A Discovery of Witches as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this tale of passion and obsession, Diana Bishop, a young scholar and a descendant of witches, discovers a long-lost and enchanted alchemical manuscript, Ashmole 782, deep in Oxford's Bodleian Library. Its reappearance summons a fantastical underworld, which she navigates with her leading man, vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont.\n\nPreview\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nFrom my list on stories about naming and language.\n\nBy Stephen B. Heard Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the names of people and things. Why do we use the names we do? What do they mean? Who made them up? Is there power in knowing something’s name? I later discovered that all these questions are very old—the idea that names have power goes back at least to ancient Egypt. When I became a biology professor, I found that my students and colleagues mostly didn’t know or care why animals and plants have the Latin names they do. But those names are fascinating, and there are stories to uncover whenever we tug on a name’s meaning like a loose thread.\n\nStephen's book list on stories about naming and language\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nI know, another “children’s book”—but another with plenty to say to me as an adult (and later books in the series are more obviously oriented to older readers). The adventures of the young man Sparrowhawk at a wizarding school dive deeply into the power of names and naming. (Earthsea predates by 30 years that other boy-coming-of-age-at-wizard-school book.)\n\nI love the richly detailed fantasy world, with a society that’s like ours but also not, and the wise but real characters with human failings they struggle to overcome. Along the way, there are lots of interesting ideas about language. I still get lost in the world of Earthsea, as I do in a few other books.\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n19 authors picked A Wizard of Earthsea as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first book of Earthsea in a beautiful hardback edition. Complete the collection with The Tombs of Atuan, The Furthest Shore and Tehanu\n\nWith illustrations from Charles Vess\n\n'[This] trilogy made me look at the world in a new way, imbued everything with a magic that was so much deeper than the magic I'd encountered before then.

Dream it' David Mitchell\n\nGed, the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea, was called Sparrowhawk in his reckless youth.\n\nHungry for power and knowledge,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Eye of the World\n\nBy Robert Jordan,\n\nFrom my list on fall in love with fantasy.\n\nBy JMD Reid Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI've always been a reader. In my childhood, I read Hardy Boys novels by the bucketload. I loved scholastic book fairs, pouring over the lists to find new books to read. Then my uncle gave me The Hobbit followed by giving me a hardback set of Lord of the Rings for Christmas of the 6th Grade. After that, my mother gave me Pawn of Prophecy, which cemented my love of the genre. I write fantasy because of all the books I listed. Each one led me down a path that ended with me publishing my first novel.\n\nJMD's book list on fall in love with fantasy\n\nWhy did JMD love this book?\n\nWhen I read this book after my mom gave it to me for Christmas in 7th Grade, I was hooked on the masterful writing of Robert Jordan. It was my first time reading limited third person and how he made each character come alive.\n\nWhile this is not my favorite book in the series, it hooked me. I waited for each new release, diving into fan forums and theory crafting. I loved his foreshadowing and his world-building. No other author had a greater impact on my writing style than RJ.\n\nBy Robert Jordan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n14 authors picked The Eye of the World as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.\n\nWhen a vicious band of half-men, half beasts invade the Two Rivers seeking their master's enemy, Moiraine persuades Rand al'Thor and his friends to leave their home and enter a larger unimaginable world filled with dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light .\n\nSince its debut in 1990, The Wheel…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Riddle-Master of Hed\n\nBy Patricia A. McKillip,\n\nFrom my list on fantasy series from the past to read or re-read.\n\nBy P. H. Solomon Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI'm a life-long reader of fantasy who cut his reading teeth on Tolkien's The Hobbit in grade school. I credit Tolkien for making me truly literate as my vocabulary grew rapidly. As a sixth-grader, I labored through The Lord of the Rings with its big words while often sitting on a warm furnace vent on cold nights. I read Riddle-Master in wonder sitting at a cheery fire some years later. Now, my writing requires I read new books of fantasy, but I always look back to older works that broke ground with marvelous stories when such books were considered pulp fiction. Enjoy these recommendations when you can!\n\nP. H.'s book list on fantasy series from the past to read or re-read\n\nWhy did P. H. love this book?\n\nFirst published in 1976, The Riddle-Master series is still a very good story and high on my list of re-reads. Written with lyric quality, the magic and the world are mysterious, making the journey through the books a wondrous adventure. I re-read this series every few years and always enjoy the storytelling by the author.\n\nBy Patricia A. McKillip,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Riddle-Master of Hed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn a land where wizards have long since vanished, Morgon, Prince of Hed, is confronted with a challenge much different from that faced by his land-bound predecessors. Although he wants only to rule and work the land of his birth, Morgon must search out a very different destiny - one dictated since birth by the mark of three stars imprinted on his forehead.\n\nHe must wander strange, foreign lands full of untamed magic in the form of riddling wraiths, mysterious harpists, a lost crown, a magical sword and an all-knowing High One who rules over all. In his quest for…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Sword of Shannara\n\nBy Terry Brooks,\n\nWhy did Izaic love this book?\n\nThis book is a treasure that ignited and brought attention to the fantasy genre. There is a certain style to Terry Brooks, and yes it is similar to Tolkien, but it's refreshing, because (like Tolkien), this story focuses on wonder, miracles, and making the moral choice.\n\nThis tale is not about who wields the magic but about the effect it has when used by good or evil people. In an “ever-grey” world, it is a boon to remember that some choices are black and white.\n\nBy Terry Brooks,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked The Sword of Shannara as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n***50 MILLION TERRY BROOKS COPIES SOLD AROUND THE WORLD***\n\nTHE SHANNARA CHRONICLES IS NOW A MAJOR TV SERIES\n\nVolume one in the classic bestselling series - from one of the all-time masters of fantasy\n\n'Terry's place is at the head of the fantasy world' Philip Pullman\n\nLong ago, the world of the Four Lands was torn apart by the wars of ancient Evil. But in the Vale, the half-human, half-elfin Shea Ohmsford now lives in peace - until the mysterious, forbidding figure of the druid Allanon appears, to reveal that the supposedly long dead Warlock Lord lives again.\n\nShea must…\n\nPreview\n\nWraeththu\n\nBy Storm Constantine,\n\nFrom my list on adult fantasy that won’t make you grow up too much.\n\nBy Heather Ashle Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy favorite fantasy novels tend to be rather complex. Winding plotlines, mysteriously interconnected characters, whimsical settings, and intricate, thoughtful worldbuilding combine to create immersive stories that stick in the mind like overworn folklore. Time travel or interworld travel lend additional layers of intrigue and mystery, forcing the inescapable contemplation of a more thrilling, alternate reality. And if it’s all packaged in artful, breathtaking prose that breeds full-color images, audible noises, indelible flavors, nose-crumpling odors, and tangible textures, I will happily lose myself in the pages, truly forgetting about the strictures of everyday life… at least until I get hungry and remember I need to consume more than books to survive.\n\nHeather's book list on adult fantasy that won’t make you grow up too much\n\nWhy did Heather love this book?\n\nAs the kid who roamed the halls between classes with a book in my hand, I suspect Wraeththu gave my nerd façade an impressive boost: technically an omnibus of three stories, Wraeththu is very thick—in both binding and plot. It follows the emotionally charged and mesmeric tales of a hermaphroditic race that is steadily subsuming the human one in a Darwinian battle for biological perfection. We follow the journeys of a few characters as they navigate the mental and physical growing pains inherent in joining a new race and the wild tribes and communities that have emerged in the wake of their hermaphroditic transformations. Dark, fascinating characters and cultures drive this story to its unusual climax when their true purposes are stunningly revealed.\n\nBy Storm Constantine,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Wraeththu as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHere at last in a single volume are all three of Constantine's Wraeththu trilogy: The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit, The Bewitchments of Love and Hate, and The Fulfilments of Fate and Desire.\n\nIn this powerful and elegant story set in a future Earth very different from our own, a new kind of human has evolved to challenge the dominion of Homo sapiens. This new breed is stronger, smarter, and far more beautiful than their parent race, and are endowed with psychic as well as physical gifts. They are destined to supplant humanity as we know it, but humanity won't…\n\nPreview\n\nFool\n\nBy Christopher Moore,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nThis retelling of King Lear from the point of view of the king’s jester (or “Fool”) named Pocket is a fun read, but prepare yourself. If you’re not into bawdy humor, stay away. Personally, I found the vulgar irreverence funny, and seeing the tragic events of the original happen around this character who isn’t really affected by any of it gave the story a unique perspective.\n\nThis book is like Shakespeare told by Monty Python after the iconic troop is given the okay to proceed with a hard R-rating. The humor plays in both the small moments and the larger, thematic ones.\n\nBy Christopher Moore,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Fool as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is a bawdy tale. Herein you will find gratuitous shagging, murder, spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity and profanity,. . . If that's the sort of thing you think you might enjoy, then you have happened upon the perfect story!'\n\nSo speaks Christopher Moore, one of America's funniest and bestselling authors, regarded as highly as classic satirists such as Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams.\n\nRead Fool and discover for yourself why this book has dominated bestseller lists across the world, and why it has reduced millions of grown men and women to tears of helpless laughter...\n\nPreview\n\nDragonflight\n\nBy Anne McCaffrey,\n\nFrom my list on science fiction books that suck you into their world.\n\nBy Jean Gilbert Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have prosopagnosia, Face Blindness. I can’t recognize my face, let alone anyone else. Not being able to remember people makes for a lonely existence. Ever since I was little, I created worlds inside my head. These were places where I could control what happened when the real world felt lonely and out of control. Discovering books that created worlds I could immerse myself in was life-changing for me. It was like finding my lost tribe. Science fiction became a comfortable home, becoming a science fiction writer was a natural progression. I still get excited when I find a book that sucks me into its world.\n\nJean's book list on science fiction books that suck you into their world\n\nWhy did Jean love this book?\n\nThe world of Pern felt so real to me that I wanted to be a part of it. Everything made sense: The culture, the politics, and the environment. Even the role of dragon and rider felt right to me.\n\nI fell in love with the characters right away and didn’t want the story to end. It made me want to have a dragon of my own and have that inseparable bond of trust and love.\n\nBy Anne McCaffrey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked Dragonflight as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nVolume I of The Dragonriders of Pern®, the groundbreaking series by master storyteller Anne McCaffrey\n\nOn a beautiful world called Pern, an ancient way of life is about to come under attack from a myth that is all too real. Lessa is an outcast survivor—her parents murdered, her birthright stolen—a strong young woman who has never stopped dreaming of revenge.
