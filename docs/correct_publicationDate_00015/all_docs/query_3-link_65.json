That said, I haven’t read all the books on this list (not even close), so I can’t vouch for the quality of all of them.\n\nI’ve broken the list down by age group (and a few other classes.)\n\nEach book or series is in alphabetical order by author. Series are generally listed under the first book, with an additional link to the series page on Goodreads.\n\nTitle links take you to Goodreads.\n\nReview links are to my reviews.\n\nBold titles are books I have read.\n\nDouble asterisks indicate books with diverse main or significant secondary characters. By “diverse,” I mean characters who are one or more of the following:\n\npeople of color\n\npeople of (real-world or analog) ethnicities, cultures, and/or religions other than white, European/Western, and Christian.\n\nLGBTQIA+ people\n\npeople who are disabled/differently-abled, or neurodiverse (someone with autistm, ADHD, etc.)\n\npeople with mental illness\n\nFinally, this list is far from exhaustive, and is still a work in progress. I generally included only books I have personally read (titles in bold), or have heard good things about from other readers. If I’ve left out your favorite book(s), send me an email with the title, author, and why you like the book. And if you notice that I didn’t mark a book as having diverse characters when it actually does, please let me know, and I’ll update the list.\n\nLast updated on 2/19/2024.\n\nDragon Books Master List\n\nPicture books\n\nSleeping Dragons All Around by Sheree Fitch, illustrated by Michelle Nidenoff\n\nDo Not Bring Your Dragon to the Library** by Julie Gassman, illustrated by Andy Elkerman (review) (various POC and disabled characters)\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon by Kenneth Graham, illustrated by Michael Hague\n\nSt. George and the Dragon by Margaret Hodges, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman\n\nThe Paper Bag Princess by Robert Munsch, illustrated by Michael Martchenko\n\nRaising Dragons** by Jerdine Nolen, illustrated by Elise Primavera (POC main character)\n\nLa Princesa Dragon/The Loathesome Dragon by David Wiesner, illustrated by Kim Kahng\n\nIgnis by Gina Wilson, illustrated by P.
