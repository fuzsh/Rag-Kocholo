        "text": "Share via:\n\nAnne McCaffrey – Irish author of science fiction, 1926-2011\n\nAs a child, Anne McCaffrey was determined that one day she would be a famous author; the large number of her books that have become best-sellers is a testimony to her success in achieving that goal. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, McCaffrey resides in Ireland in a home she calls Dragonhold. Her science fiction has re­ceived numerous prizes, including the Hugo and Nebu­la awards, and is widely read by adults and adolescents.\n\nBest known are her novels set on Pern, a planet colo­nized by and later isolated from Earth. With genetic engineering, the inhabitants of Pern adapted a beast native to the planet to fight with fire the invasive, spore ­like Thread that jumps from the Red Star to Pern during certain periods of its orbit Each of these massive, sen­tient creatures, called dragons because of their similarity to the mythical Earth creatures, forms at hatching a life­long, telepathic attachment, called Impressing, to one human, who becomes its dragonrider.\n\nUpon this com­plex, but fully developed premise, more than a dozen tales have been founded. Three—Dragonsong (1976), Dragonsinger (1977), and Dragondrums (1979), together known as the “Harper Hall of Pern” series—were writ­ten specifically for young readers. Although the dragons are featured as an integral part of Pernese life, the trilogy focuses more closely on the role of the harper in Pern society.\n\nAnne McCaffrey, who studied voice for nine years and for a time was involved in the theater, brings her love of music to her fiction by exploring its importance to cul­ture, not only as entertainment, but as a way of trans­mitting knowledge and history from generation to gen­eration. In Dragonsong, Menolly, an extremely gifted musician, runs away from her native fishing community because her father believes girls have no right to com­pose or play music in public.\n\nAccidentally, Menolly Impresses nine fire lizards, miniature cousins of the dragons, when she seeks refuge in a cave sheltering the eggs from which they hatch. Unbeknownst to her, the Master Harper of Pern has been seeking her after hear­ing two songs she wrote, and Dragonsinger relates her adjustment to being apprenticed to him at Harper Hall, where she learns about the demands, difficulties, and joys of life as a harper. Dragondrums features the adven­tures of Piemur, a young friend of Menolly’s, as he succeeds Menolly as Master Harper Robinton’s special apprentice and finagles his way into Impressing his own fire lizard.\n\nBecause of Anne McCaffrey’s in-depth exploration of char­acter in her works and her smooth integration of the necessary technical information into the backdrop of her stories, some people term her writing “science fan­tasy” rather than “science fiction.” Certainly, her stories have wide appeal among many who eschew the high- technology focus of most science fiction, but McCaffrey never neglects the careful research that backs up the sci­entific aspects of the novels. By creating well-rounded characters who must overcome numerous setbacks and challenge the restrictions of tradition to achieve their goals, McCaffrey develops an atmosphere in which those who are thought to be weak prove themselves strong and in which female characters, in particular, find fulfillment.\n\nIn her adult works, Anne McCaffrey has sculpted many other scenarios that push back the boundaries of the known universe and open the reader to new possibili­ties, but her books about the dragons and people of Pern have found an overwhelming number of fans. Dragons hold great appeal for many fantasy lovers; in the series, McCaffrey redefines the beast and therefore adds depth to any understanding of the mythical crea­tures. Her work draws in readers of fantasy and science fiction, as well as those who simply love adventurous stories with strong, determined characters.\n\nA.E.D.\n\nSource: Children’s Books and their Creators, Anita Silvey.\n\nAnne McCaffrey Collector’s Guide\n\nFirst Editions Identification Guide for Anne McCaffrey’s works.\n\nAnne McCaffrey Books Series in Order\n\nDragonriders of Pern series\n\nPublication Order\n\nDragonflight (1968)\n\nDragonquest (1971)\n\nDragonsong (1976)\n\nDragonsinger (1977)\n\nThe White Dragon (1978)\n\nDragondrums (1979)\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady of Pern (1983)\n\nNerilka’s Story (1986)\n\nDragonsdawn (1988)\n\nThe Renegades of Pern (1989)\n\nAll the Weyrs of Pern (1991)\n\nThe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall (1993)\n\nThe Dolphins of Pern (1994)\n\nRed Star Rising / Dragonseye (1996)\n\nThe Masterharper of Pern (1998)\n\nThe Skies of Pern (2001)\n\nA Gift of Dragons (2002)\n\nDragon’s Kin (2003)\n\nDragons Blood (2005)\n\nDragon’s Fire (2006)\n\nDragon Harper (2007)\n\nDragon’s Time (2011)\n\nSky Dragons (2011)\n\nChronological Order\n\nDragonsdawn (1988)\n\nThe Chronicles of Pern: First Fall (1993)\n\nRed Star Rising / Dragonseye (1996)\n\nDragon’s Kin (2003)\n\nDragon’s Fire (2006)\n\nDragon Harper (2007)\n\nDragon’s Time (2011)\n\nSky Dragons (2011)\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady of Pern (1983)\n\nNerilka’s Story (1986)\n\nThe Masterharper of Pern (1998)\n\nDragonflight (1968)\n\nDragonquest (1971)\n\nDragonsinger (1977)\n\nDragondrums (1979)\n\nThe Renegades of Pern (1989)\n\nThe White Dragon (1978)\n\nA Gift of Dragons (2002)\n\nThe Skies of Pern (2001)\n\nDragonsong (1976)\n\nAll the Weyrs of Pern (1991)\n\nThe Dolphins of Pern (1994)\n\nDragons Blood (2005)\n\nPublication Order of Brain & Brawn Ships Books\n\nThe Ship Who Sang (1969)\n\nPartnerShip (1992)\n\nThe City Who Fought (1993)\n\nThe Ship Who Won (1993)\n\nPublication Order of Crystal Universe Books\n\nThe Coelura (1983)\n\nNimisha’s Ship (1998)\n\nPublication Order of Crystal Singer Trilogy Books\n\nCrystal Singer (1982)\n\nKillashandra (1985)\n\nCrystal Line (1992)\n\nPublication Order of Dinosaur Planet Books\n\nDinosaur Planet (1978)\n\nDinosaur Planet Survivors (1984)\n\nPublication Order of Planet Pirates Books\n\nSassinak (1990)\n\nThe Death of Sleep (1990)\n\nGeneration Warriors (1991)\n\nPublication Order of The Talent Books\n\nTo Ride Pegasus (1973)\n\nPegasus in Flight (1990)\n\nPegasus in Space (2000)\n\nPublication Order of The Tower and Hive Books\n\nThe Rowan (1990)\n\nDamia (1991)\n\nDamia’s Children (1993)\n\nLyon’s Pride (1994)\n\nThe Tower and the Hive (1999)\n\nPublication Order of Tales of the Barque Cats Books\n\nCatalyst (2009)\n\nCatacombs (2010)\n\nPublication Order of Doona Books\n\nDecision at Doona (1969)\n\nCrisis on Doona (1992)\n\nTreaty at Doona (1994)\n\nPublication Order of Petaybee/Powers Trilogy Books\n\nPowers That Be (1993)\n\nPower Lines (1994)\n\nPower Play (1995)\n\nPublication Order of Twins of Petaybee Books\n\nChangelings (2005)\n\nMaelstrom (2006)\n\nDeluge (2007)\n\nPublication Order of Freedom Books\n\nFreedom’s Landing (1995)\n\nFreedom’s Choice (1997)Freedom’s Challenge (1998)\n\nFreedom’s Ransom (2002)\n\nPublication Order of Acorna Books\n\nAcorna: Unicorn Girl (1997)\n\nAcorna’s Quest (1998)\n\nAcorna’s People (1999)\n\nAcorna’s World (2000)\n\nAcorna’s Search (2001)\n\nAcorna’s Triumph (2004)\n\nPublication Order of Acorna’s Children Books\n\nFirst Warning: Acorna’s Children (2005)\n\nSecond Wave: Acorna’s Children (2006)\n\nThird Watch: Acorna’s Children (2007)\n\nPublication Order of Harper Hall of Pern Books\n\nDragonsong (1976)\n\nDragonsinger (1977)\n\nDragondrums (1979)\n\nPublication Order of Three Women Books\n\nRing of Fear (1971)\n\nThe Kilternan Legacy (1975)\n\nThree Women (1990)\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nRestoree (1967)\n\nThe Mark of Merlin (1971)\n\nStitch in Snow (1984)\n\nThe Year of the Lucy (1986)\n\nThe Lady (1987)\n\nAn Exchange Of Gifts (1995)\n\nNo One Noticed the Cat (1996)\n\nIf Wishes Were Horses (1998)\n\nBlack Horses for the King (1998)\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories Books\n\nA Time When (1975)\n\nDuty Calls (1988)\n\nRescue Run (1991)\n\nPublication Order of Short Story Collections\n\nGet Off the Unicorn (1977)\n\nFuture love (1977)\n\nHabit is an old horse (1984)\n\nThe Girl Who Heard Dragons (1985)\n\nA Gift of Dragons (2002)\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies"
