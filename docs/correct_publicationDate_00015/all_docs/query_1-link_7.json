        "text": "This is the first time I‚Äôve read any of the Pern books by Todd McCaffrey and to be honest I was a hesitant to start it because of some reviews from fellow Pern lovers. I heard that basically his stuff was crap in comparison to Anne‚Äôs work and that I shouldn‚Äôt give him the time of day. I decided to read it and synthesize my own opinion of his work and I started with Dragon‚Äôs Blood.\n\nI started out with the foreword which was written by Anne McCaffrey and after reading I felt a little better about reading a book about my beloved Pern by someone who wasn‚Äôt Anne. She basically said in the foreword that Todd was there for the whole process of creating Pern and she read and approved of this book. She also had two of her biggest fans read and approve of the book before it was allowed to be sent to a publisher. I felt a little sad after reading this because I still get feels when I think about Anne passing away.\n\nSo, I continued reading. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think that Todd really captured the feel of Pern and he had all the facts right. The basic plot of the book is that there are two timelines occurring at the same time during the book and characters from both times lines are racing to create a cure for a virus that is infecting and killing dragons. It was nice to see some returning characters from early in the time line, and I liked that there were some new characters introduced. I‚Äôm always a little leery about new characters because I never think I will like them as much as the original characters. Fortunately, I feel in love with the characters in this book and I think it was Todd‚Äôs ability to write in a way to make the reader empathized with the characters.\n\nOne blaring difference between Pern books by Anne McCaffrey and Todd‚Äôs was that the overall tone was much darker. Dragon‚Äôs Blood was dark. Very dark. Much darker than even the plague themed books by Anne. I felt there was so much death in this book and it was all sudden. It was like, ‚ÄúLa, la, la, oh look baby dragon, so cute, much love, omg dead baby dragon.‚Äù üòê BAM. Here I was thinking the main heroine was going to be the next Lessa‚Ä¶ nope. I‚Äôm currently half way through Dragon‚Äôs Fire by both Anne and Todd and I‚Äôm finding it very dark as well. Todd seems to have a thing about dead babies‚Ä¶\n\nSo, overall I did enjoy reading this book and I feel that Todd did Pern justice, even if his tone is much darker than Anne‚Äôs. Of course he will never totally replace Anne as the writer of Pern, but at least he‚Äôs giving it his best effort and open to taking feedback from the fans. I‚Äôll continue to read his books and I think I will enjoy them more and more as I get used to all the darkness."
