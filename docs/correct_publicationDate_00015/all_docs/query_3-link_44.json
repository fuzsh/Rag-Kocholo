For most of her life she has survived by serving those who betrayed her father and took over his lands. Now the time has come for Lessa to shed her disguise and take back her stolen birthright. But everything changes when she meets a queen dragon. The bond they share will be deep and last forever. It will protect them when, for the first time in centuries, Lessaâ€™s world is threatened by Thread, an evil substance that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches.

Pure white and incredibly agile, Ruth possessed remarkable qualities. Not only could he communicate with the iridescent, fluttering fire lizards, but he could fly. Back in time to any WHEN with unfailing accuracy. Nearly everyone else on Pern thought Ruth was a runt who would never amount to anything, but Jaxom knew his dragon was special. In secret they trained to fight against the burning threads from the Red Planet, to fly Back in time as well as Between, and finally their close and special union was to result in the most startling and breathtaking discovery of allâ€¦\n\nThe White Dragon is one of the most unforgettable episodes in Anne McCaffreyâ€™s world famous Chronicles of Pern.\n\nDragondrums\n\nOf all the young singers at the Harperhall of Pern, Piemur was the one chosen for the leading role at Lord Grogheâ€™s Gatherâ€¦\n\nand then his voice broke. Suddenly his whole future at Harperhall became uncertain. But Masterharper Robinton, Menolly and Sebell had other plans for Piemur. They were sure that his quick wits and discretion could be used to keep a check on the troublesome Oldtimers and their strange traffic in fire lizards. So, whilst serving as a messanger drum apprentice, Piemur carried out special errands for the three. And it was on one such errand that he realized his wildest dreams.\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady of Pern\n\nAn air of pleasant anticipation hung so thickly over the Halls, Holds, and Weyrs of Pern that it had affected even the businesslike ways of Moreta, the Weyrwoman of Fort Weyr. Her dragon, Queen Orlith, would soon clutch; spring had made a glorious debut; the Gather at Ruatha Hold was extremely merry; and Moreta was enjoying the attentions of Alessan, the new Lord Holder of Ruatha Hold.\n\nWith only eight Turns remaining before the deadly Thread would cease to Fall, all seemed well on Pern.\n\nThen, without warning, a runnerbeast fell ill. Soon myriads of holders, craftsmen, and dragonriders were dying; and the mysterious ailment had spread to all but the most inaccessible holds. Pern was in mortal danger. For, if dragonriders did not rise to char Thread, the parasite would devour any and all organic life it encountered.\n\nThe future of the planet rested in the hands of Moreta and the other dedicated, selfless Pern leaders. But of all their problems, the most difficult to overcome was timeâ€¦\n\nNerilkaâ€™s Story\n\nNerilkaâ€™s Story. It was in Moretaâ€™s time a time of legend, of heroic valor, of terrible Threadfall and the Great Plague that devastated both Holders and Dragonfolk. For Lady Nerilka of Fort Hold, the tragedy was twofold, for with the death of her mother and her sister, her fatherâ€™s mistress took possession of the Hold. Angry and betrayed, Nerilka decided to escape and, as Pern seethed in turmoil, she began her perilous journey to Ruatha, Lord Alessan and an unknown destiny. The Coelura. When the Lady Caissa was told by her exalted sire to enter into an heir contract with Cavernus Gustin she was appalled. For although Gustin was genetically sound he was vain, pompous and intellectually inept. But Caissaâ€™s father was determined there should be a union he had his own privately plotted plans for such a match. And a few hours later Caissa began to suspect what they were. On a private flight over the forbidden areas of the North, she was alerted by a distress signal and there discovered a stranger who said his name was Murell a man surrounded by coelura, the incredible rainbow creatures whose very brilliance threatened their extinction. It was the coelura her father wanted. And Murell was determined to save them.\n\nDragonsdawn\n\nThe beautiful planet Pern seemed a paradise to its new colonists until unimaginable terror turned it into hell. Suddenly deadly spores were falling like silver threads from the sky, devouring everything and everyone in their path. It began to look as if the colony, cut off from Earth and lacking the resources to combat the menace, was doomed. Then some of the colonists noticed that the small, dragonlike lizards that inhabited their new world were joining the fight against Thread, breathing fire on it and teleporting to safety. If only, they thought, the dragonets were big enough for a human to ride and intelligent enough to work as a team with a riderâ€¦\n\nAnd so they set their most talented geneticist to work to create the creatures Pern so desperately needed Dragons!\n\nThe Renegades of Pern\n\nAs long as the people of Pern could remember, the Holds had protected them from Thread, the deadly silver strands that fell from the sky and ravaged the land. In exchange for sanctuary in the huge stone fortresses, the people tithed to their lord Holders, who in turn supported the Weyrs, whose dragons were Pernâ€™s greatest weapon against Thread.\n\nBut not everyone on Pern was part of that system of mutual care and protection, particularly those who had been rendered holdless as punishment for wrongdoing. And there were some, like Jaygeâ€™s trader clan, who simply preferred the freedom of the roads to the security of a hold. Others, like Araminaâ€™s family, had lost their holds through injustice and cruelty. For all the holdless, life was a constant struggle for survival.\n\nThen, from the ranks of the criminals and the disaffected, rose a band of renegades, led by the Lady Thella. No one was safe from Thellaâ€™s depredations, and now her quarry was Aramina, reputed to have a telepathic link with dragons. But when Thella mistakenly vented her rage on Jaygeâ€™s family, she made a dangerous enemy. For Jayge was bent on revenge and he would never let her have the girl who heard dragons!\n\nAll the Weyrs of Pern\n\nFor generations, the dragonriders had dedicated their lives to fighting Thread, the dreaded spores that periodically rained from the sky to ravage the land. On the backs of their magnificent telepathic dragons they flew to flame the deadly stuff out of the air before it could reach the planetâ€™s surface. But the greatest dream of the dragonriders was to find a way to eradicate Thread completely, so that never again would their beloved Pern be threatened with destruction. Now, for the first time, it looks as if that dream can come true. For when the people of Pern, led by Masterharper Robinton and F lar and Lessa, Weyr leader and Weyrwoman of Benden Weyr, excavate the ancient remains of the planet s original settlement, they uncover the colonists voice activated artificial intelligence system which still functions. And the computer has incredible news for them: There is a chance a good chance that they can, at long last, annihilate Thread once and for all. When McCaffrey s beloved dragons roar and their riders soar upon the beasts mighty backsâ€¦\n\nfans of Pern will likely be enthralled.

From the Hardcover edition.\n\nThe Dolphins of Pern\n\nWhen the first humans came to settle the planet Pern, they did not come alone: intelligence enhanced dolphins also crossed the stars to colonize Pernâ€™s oceans while their human partners settled the vast continents. But then disaster struck. The deadly silver spores called Thread fell like rain from the sky, and as human colonists dreams of a new, idyllic life shattered into a desperate struggle for survival, the dolphins were forgotten. Now, centuries later, as the dragonriders of Pern prepare to complete the momentus task of ridding their world of Thread forever, T lion, a young bronze rider, and his friend Readis, son of the Lord Holder of Paradise River Hold, make contact with the legendary shipfish. And as the dragonriders grapple with the end of an era, T lion, Readis, and the dolphins face the start of a new one: reviving the bond between land and ocean dwellers and resurrecting the dreams of the first colonists of Pern.\n\nRed Star Rising / Dragonseye\n\nThread: deadly silver strands that fall from the sky like rain, devouring every organic thing in their path animals, plants, and people alike. Who could believe that such a horrible thing could exist? After all, itâ€™s been two hundred years since Thread supposedly fell on Pern. No one alive remembers that first onslaught. Thereâ€™s no sign of it anywhere in the world. Only the dragons, originally created to be a weapon against Thread, are still around to remind people that once before their population was decimated, their hopes and dreams and livelihoods almost destroyed forever. For two centuries the dragonriders have been practicing and training, passing down from generation to generation the Threadfighting techniques learned on the fly by their besieged ancestors. And most of the Lord Holders are prepared to protect their people, to provide sanctuary, to assemble groundcrews to search out and destroy any Thread that might be missed by the dragons soaring overhead. All but one. Even now the ominous signs are appearing: the violent winter storms and volcanic eruptions that are said to herald the approach of the Red Star and its lethal spawn. Impossibly, one stubborn Lord Holder, Chalkin of Bitra, refuses to believe and that disbelief could spell disaster for all of Pern. So while the dragonriders desperately train to face an enemy theyâ€™ve never fought before, they and the other Lord Holders must find a way to deal with Chalkin and protect Bitra.\n\nThe Masterharper of Pern\n\nIn a time when no Thread has fallen for centuries when, indeed, many are beginning to dare to hope that Thread will never fall again a boy is born to Harper Hall. His name is Robinton, and he is destined to be one of the most famous and beloved leaders Pern has ever known. It is a perilous time for harpers. They sing of Thread, yet more and more people are beginning to doubt the return of that deadly scourge. They teach reading, writing, history, but Fax who hates the harpers in general is determined to keep his growing area of influence free of the learning that might sow unrest. And they extol the dragonriders, whom many view increasingly as a drain on the resources of the Holds. Now harpers are being turned away from the holds; and, worse yet, they are being derided, attacked, even beaten. It is the climate of unrest that Robinton will come into his own. For despite the tragedies that beset his own life, he continues to believe in music and in the dragons, and is determined to save his beloved Pern from itselfâ€¦\n\nso that the dragonriders can be ready to fly against the dreaded Thread when it at last returns!\n\nThe Skies of Pern\n\nThanks to Anne McCaffrey, millions of readers have soared the skies on dragonback, shared the thoughts and dreams of the great dragons of Pern, and risked life and limb to safeguard the planet from the deadly threat of falling Thread.

Technological marvels are changing the face of life on Pern.

And now a brand new danger looms from the skiesâ€¦\n\nand threatens a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Once again, the world looks to the dragons and their riders to solve the crisis and save the world.

DRAGON S KINYoung Kindan has no expectations other than joining his father in the mines of Camp Natalon, a coal mining settlement struggling to turn a profit far from the great Holds where the presence of dragons and their riders means safety and civilization. Mining is fraught with danger. Fortunately, the camp has a watch wher, a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to specialized work in the dark, cold mineshafts. Kindan s father is the watch wher s handler, and his son sometimes helps him out. But even that important job promises no opportunity outside the mine. Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch wher. Fathers are replaced by sons in the mine except for Kindan, who is taken in by the camp s new Harper.

From the Hardcover edition.\n\nDragonsblood\n\nIn Dragonâ€™s Kin, bestselling author Anne McCaffrey did the unthinkable: for the first time ever, she invited another writer to join her in the skies of her most famous fictional creation. That writer was her son, Todd McCaffrey. Together, they penned a triumphant new chapter in the annals of the extraordinarily popular Dragonriders of Pern. Now, for the first time, Todd McCaffrey flies alone. And Dragonsblood is proof that the future of Pern is in good hands. After all, dragons are in his bloodâ€¦\n\nNever in the dramatic history of Pern has there been a more dire emergency than that which faces the young dragonrider Lorana. A mysterious fatal illness is striking dragons. The epidemic is spreading like wildfireâ€¦\n\nand the next deadly cycle of Threadfall is only days away. Somehow, Lorana must find a cure before the dragons including her own beloved Arith succumb to the sickness, leaving Pern undefended. The lyrics of an all but forgotten song seem to point toward an answer, an answer from nearly five hundred years in the past, when Kitti Ping and her daughter Wind Blossom bred the first dragons from their smaller cousins, the fire lizards. No doubt the first Pern colonists possessed the advanced technology to find the cure Lorana seeks, but over the centuries, that knowledge has been lost. Or has it? For in the distant past, an aged Wind Blossom worries that the germs that affect the fire lizards may one day turn against larger prey and unleash a plague that will destroy the dragons, Pernâ€™s only defenders against Thread. But as her people struggle to survive, Wind Blossom has neither the time nor the resources to expend on a future that may never arrive until suddenly she uncovers evidence that her worst fears will come true. Now two brave women, separated by hundreds of years but joined by bonds transcending time, will become unknowing allies in a desperate race against sickness and Threadfall, with nothing less than the survival of all life on Pern at stake. â€˜The torch has been passed and burns more brightly than ever in this latest chapter of the venerable Pern saga, the first of what one hopes will be many solo efforts by the son of series creator Anne McCaffrey.â€™ Publishers Weekly starred review\n\nDragonâ€™s Fire\n\nBringing fresh wonders and dangers to light in the skies of Pern, Anne McCaffrey and her son, Todd, who demonstrated his writing talents in the bestselling novels Dragonâ€™s Kin and Dragonsblood, return with their second collaboration: a thrilling adventure of discovery and fate.

Though born mute, Pellar is a gifted tracker, and when Zist sets off to take over as harper for Natalon s coal mining camp, Pellar along with his fire lizard, Chitter joins him on a secret mission of his own: to find out if reported thefts of coal are the work of the Shunned, criminals condemned to a life of wandering and hardship. Halla is one of the children of the Shunned. Though innocent of their parents crimes, these children have inherited their cruel punishment. Lack of food, shelter, and clothes is their lot; hope is unknown to them. And what future would they hope for? Without a hold to call their own, there will be no protection for them when the lethal Thread inevitably falls again. Life is even tougher for Halla. Her family gone, she must fend for herself. Yet despite the brutality of her surroundings, Halla is kind and gentle, devoted to those more helpless than she. As depraved as Halla is good, Tenim is in league with Tarik, a crooked miner from Camp Natalon, who helps him steal coal in exchange for a cut of the profit. But Tenim soon realizes there is a lot more to be made from firestone, the volatile mineral that enables the dragons of Pern to burn Thread out of the sky. Tenim doesn t care what he has to do, or whom he has to kill, in order to corner the market. Cristov is Tarik s son. Dishonored by his father s greed and treachery, the boy must make amends somehow, even if it means risking his life by mining the volatile firestone, which detonates on contact with the slightest drop of moisture. When the last remaining firestone mine explodes in flames, a desperate race begins to find a new deposit of the deadly but essential mineral, for without it there can be no defense against Thread. But Tenim has a murderous plan to turn tragedy to his own advantage, and only Pellar, Halla, and Cristov can stop him and ensure that there will be a future for all on the world of the Dragonriders.

Now the chronicles of Pern take another captivating turn as the embattled planet, the brave pioneers who call it home, and the magnificent flame breathing creatures who fly high to protect it confront a dire new challenge.\n\nThe grim specter of sickness looms over the Weyrs of Pern, felling fire lizards and posing a potentially devastating threat to their dragon cousins, Pern s sole defense against the deadly phenomenon that is Thread. Fiona, the youngest and only surviving daughter of Lord Bemin, is just coming of age, and about to assume the duties of a Weyrwoman, when word spreads that dragons have indeed begun succumbing to the new contagion. With the next season of Threadfall quickly approaching, and the already diminished ranks of the dragons once more under siege, every Weyr across Pern is in crisis mode. It is hardly the time for disturbing distractions such as the strange voice Fiona suddenly hears in her mind at the darkest and most urgent moments.\n\nCircumstances and the mood of the weyrfolk worsen when advance patrols relay the dreaded news that black dust the unmistakable herald of falling Thread has been sighted. As more dragons sicken and die, leaving only a new generation of weyrlings too young to succeed them, Weyrleader B Nik and queen rider Lorana arrive from Benden Weyr to comb Fort Weyr s archives in a desperate search for clues from the past that may hold the solution to the plague.\n\nBut could the actual past itself prove the pathway to salvation for Pern s stricken dragons and the entire imperiled planet? Guided by a mysterious ally from a wholly unexpected place, and trusting in the unique dragon gift for transcending time, Fiona will join a risky expedition with far reaching consequences for both Pern s future and her personal destiny.\n\nDragon Girl\n\nYoung Fiona, rider of the gold queen Talenth, has returned from the past, where she and a group of dragons and riders fled so that the wounded could heal from their previous battles with Thread and the younger dragons could safely grow to fighting age. Gone only three days, yet aged more than three years, Fiona is no longer a child but a woman prepared to fight against the Thread that threatens to destroy her world. Fionaâ€™s life takes a pivotal turn when a shocking tragedy thrusts her into a position of authority. Now she finds herself leading weyrfolk who have a hard time trusting a senior Weyrwoman who is both young and an outsider. But even greater challenges lie ahead: Thread is falling and there are too few dragons to stem the tide. Many have died from the recent plague, and even with the influx of newly mature dragons from the past, the depleted fighting force is no match for the intensifying Threadfall. Fiona knows that something must be done, and what she proposes is daring and next to impossible. But if her plan succeeds, it just might save them all. With a cast of familiar characters from previous Pern novels including Lorana, who sacrificed her own queen dragon so that all the dragons of Pern would have a chance to survive, and Kindan, the harper Fiona has loved her whole life Dragongirl is another triumph for Todd McCaffrey, and a riveting new chapter for the Dragonriders of Pern.\n\nDragonâ€™s Time\n\nFor the first time in more than three years, bestselling authors Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey, mother and son, have teamed up again to do what they do best: add a fresh chapter to the most beloved science fiction series of all time, the Dragonriders of Pern. Even though Lorana cured the plague that was killing the dragons of Pern, sacrificing her queen dragon in the process, the effects of the disease were so devastating that there are no longer enough dragons available to fight the fall of deadly Thread. And as the situation grows more dire, a pregnant Lorana decides that she must take drastic steps in the quest for help. Meanwhile, back at Telgar Weyr, Weyrwoman Fiona, herself pregnant, and the harper Kindan must somehow keep morale from fading altogether in the face of the steadily mounting losses of dragons and their riders. But time weighs heavily against them until Lorana finds a way to use time itself in their favor. Itâ€™s a plan fraught with risk, however. For attempting time travel means tampering with the natural laws of the universe, which could drastically alter history and destiny forever. Or so it has always been thought. But Lorana discovers that if the laws of time can t be broken without consequences, it may still be possible to bend them. To ensure the future of Pern, she s willing to take the fateful chance even if it demands another, even greater, sacrifice.\n\nSky Dragons\n\nFrom the New York Times bestselling mother and son team of Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey comes the final installment in the riveting Pern saga that began with Toddâ€™s solo novel, Dragonsblood. Now, with all of Pern imperiled by the aftereffects of a plague that killed scores of dragons and left the planet helpless against the fall of deadly Thread, the only hope for the future lies in the past. There, on an unexplored island, a group of dragonriders led by Xhinna, a brave young woman who rides the blue dragon Tazith, must battle lethal Merows and voracious tunnel snakes to build a safe home for themselves and the dragons, whose offspring will one day if they survive replenish Pern s decimated dragon population. But as the first female rider of a blue dragon, and the first female Weyrleader in the history of Pern, Xhinna faces an uphill battle in winning the respect and loyalty of her peersâ€¦\n\nespecially after an unforeseen tragedy leaves the struggling colony reeling from a shattering loss. Amid the grieving, one girl, Jirana, blessed or cursed with the ability to foresee potential futures, will help Xhinna find a way forward. The answer lies in timeâ€¦\n\nor, rather, in timing it: the awesome ability of the dragons to travel through time itself. But that power comes with risks, and by venturing further into the past, Xhinna may be jeopardizing the very future she has sworn to save."
