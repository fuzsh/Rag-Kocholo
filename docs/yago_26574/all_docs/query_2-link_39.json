        "text": "N\n\nNaamah â (fl. c967 â c930 BC)\n\nHebrew queen\n\nNaamah was born into the Ammonite tribe, who resided east of the river Jordan in Palestine. She became the second wife of Solomon, king of Israel (c987 â 926 BC) as part of a deliberate political alliance. Naamah was granted the title of queen, but remained a secondary wife, though she was the mother of Solomonâs ultimate successor, King Rehoboam (c967 â 910 BC). Queen Naamah died before her sonâs accession (926 BC). As queen, she wasÂ permitted to worship her own deity, the Ammonite gold Molech one of the foreign gods referred to in the biblical book of Kings I (11: 5 & 7), to which Solomon erected an altar. The book of Chronicles II mentions her, but only as the mother of her son.\n\nNadaillac, Marquise deÂ Â see Â Â Escars, Duchesse dâ\n\nNadasdy de Nadasd, Erzsebet Christine â (c1648 â 1682)\n\nHungarian countess\n\nErzsebet Nadasdy was the daughter of Count Ferenc Nadasdy de Nadasd et Fogarasfold, and his wife Countess Anna Julia Esterhazy de Galantha. Through her father she was a descendant of the infamous âBlood Countess,â Erzsebet Bathory, after whom she was named. Erzsebet was married (1667) to Count Nicholas Draskovitch von Trakostjan (died 1687), whom she predeceased (March 12, 1682). She left three children,\n\nCount Pal Draskovitch von Trakostjan (1667 â 1693). He was married to Countess Magdalena Erdody, but died childless.\n\nCountess Katalin Draskovitch von Trakostjan (1667 â 1703).

She remained unmarried. Naeff was best remembered for her books written for juvenile girls, notably Schoolidyllen (1900) which achieved literary recognition for her. This and other of Naeffâs works explore the themes of childhood rebellion against what is seen as parental hypocrisy, and the later gradual acceptance and conformity to their assigned fate.\n\nNaeff also wrote two collections of novellas Voorbijgangers (Passers-By) (1925) and Juffrouw Stolk en andere verhalen (Miss Stolk and Other Stories) (1936). She worked for a considerable period as a theatre critic for Elseviers Maanblad and De Groene Amsterdammer publications, and wrote her autobiography Zo was het ongeveer (Thatâs More or Less the Way it Was) (1950).\n\nNaevia Galla â (fl. c400 â c413 AD)Â\n\nRoman Christian founder\n\nNaevia Galla was the wife of Claudius Postumius Dardanus, praetorian prefect of Gaul (412 â 413 AD). With her husband and her brother-in-law Claudius Lepidus, Naevia founded the Christian community of Theopolis on their estates at Sisteron, which they then fortified it with walls and gates in order to protect it from barbarian incursions, and provide safety for everyone living on their estates. Naevia Galla, her family and their activities are attested by the so-called âPierr Ecuriteâ inscription near Alabonte, in Narbonne, France, which styles her clar(issima) et in(lustris) fem(ina), mater fam(iliae) eius (sc. Dardani). A chapel on the slopes pf Rocher de Dromon, near St Geniez overlies some early Roman columns, and it has been tentatively suggested that they may have once formed part of a monument erected over Dardanus and Naevia.\n\nNafije Zogyu â (1900 â 1955)\n\nPrincess of Albania\n\nPrincess Nafije was born (Sept 12, 1900) at Mati, the second daughter of Xhemel Pasha and his wife Sadije Toptani, and sister to King Zogyu I.

She had been considered for this position since the age of fourteen (1918) and had been trained specifically for her future Imperial role, studying history, French, Chinese and Japanese literature, and calligraphy, as well as the exacting court ceremonial. The couple had been formally betrothed (1919) and the marriage went ahead despite objections made by General Yamagata Aritomo who had attempted to slander Nagakoâs family because theu were not members of the Fujiwara clan. This action only made Hirohito the more determined to marry her.\n\nWhen Hirohito succeeded to the Imperial throne as the 124th Emperor (Dec 25, 1926), Crown Princess Nagako received the Imperial titles and styles. Due to his great attachment to Nagako one of the emperorâs first edicts was to abolish the practice of emperors keeping concubines, and dismissed the thirty or so then resident within the Imperial palace. Both government and court became alarmed at the lack of a male heir when after almost a decade of marriage the empress ahd produced only four daughters.

With the 1947 constitution the Empress consort Nagako became a benevolent figurehead and was seen accompanying her husband on ceremonial occasions. She remained incredibly discreet and none of her own opinions were ever quoted by the press. She received the Order of the Precious Crown and the Order of the Sacred Treasure.\n\nThe empress was a talented amateur artist and produced landscapes and still-life paintings. She presented one of these works to Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain during a state visit to that country with her husband (1971). At this time she visited several European countries with Hirohito including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, West Germany and Denmark. The Imperial couple later made a state visit to the USA (1975). With her husbandâs death she became the Empress Dowager (kotaigo) (1989 â 2000) and resided in seclusion at the Fukiage Palace for the last years of her life due to ill-health and infirmity.

Princess Nefehetepes was interred at Giza, where surviving inscriptions gave her the title of âKingâs Daughter of his Body.â\n\nNeferetiabet â (fl. c2500 BC)\n\nEgyptian princess\n\nNeferetiabet was perhaps the daughter Seneferu (Snofru) the first pharoah of the IVth Dynasty (2520 â 2392 BC). Her tomb was disocvered and excavated at Giza, and surviving reliefs accorded her the title of âKingâs Daughter.â A slab stela was recovered and preserved in the Louvre Museum in Paris, whilst a statuette from her tomb was preserved in Munich, Bavaria.\n\nNeferneferure-tasherit â (fl. c1340 â c1315 BC)\n\nSumerian queen of Ugarit\n\nNeferneferure-tasherit was the daughter of Tuthankhamun, King of Egypt, and his wife and half-sister, Ankhesenamun, the daughter of Amenhotep IV âAkhenatenâ and his wife, the famous Nefertiti. By the marriage of her maternal aunt, Mutnodjmet I with Pharoah Horemheb, this princess, one of the few survivors of her immediate family, became great-niece to the new king.\n\nHer marriage with Niqmat, king of Ugarit may have been celebrated around the time of Horemhebâs victory in Syria (c1315 BC), in order to bind this former Egyptian overlordship back to the royal house, this province having been lost to Egypt through the inaction of Akhenaten three decades earlier. Queen Neferneferure-tasherit was possibly the mother of King Ar-Khalba, who led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Hittites, who cuaed him to be deposed, and replaced on the throne by his brother, Niqmepa.\n\nNefertariÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Â Â Â Nefretiri\n\nNefertiti â (c1381 â c1346 BC)Â\n\nQueen of Egypt\n\nNefertiti may have the daughter of a king of the Mitanni, an ally of Egypt, or she may have been the daughter of chancellor Ay, who became pharoah in old age, and his wife, Tey. She was the elder sister of Mutnodjmet I. Nefertiti, whose name means âthe beautiful one who has come,â was married firstly to Amenhotep III, as a secondary wife (c1367 BC).\n\nWith his death a few years later she passed into the harem of his son and heir, Amenhotep IV, better known as âAkhenaten.â She became his chief wife, and presented him with six daughters. Nefertiti ruled in close association with her husband, which fact is borne out by surviving reliefs from the temple of Aten at Karnak, and from tomb scenes recovered from the former city of El Amarna.\n\nNefertiti shared her husbandâs plans to force the adoption of the worship of the sun disc, the Aten, and removing the capital of Egypt from Thebes to El Amarna, but the appeal of this cult was only really to the royal family and their court, and was not appreciated by the rest of the population, who clung to the old religion. With Akhenatenâs death, she appears to have shared power with her son-in-law, Smenkhare, and was alive at the time of her stepson, Tuthankhamunâs accession. She was probably removed from power, possibly murdered during a palace intrigue soon after this. Some modern Egyptologists believe that Nefertiti ruled as pharoah, taking the name of Smenkhare after her husband's death.\n\nQueen Nefertiti has been immortalized around the world in the form of the beautiful scultured head which was recovered from Amarna (1912) by Ludwig Borchardt, and is now preserved in the Agyptisches Museum in Berlin, Germany.\n\nNefertiti was portrayed on the screen by actress Anitra Stevens in the film The Egyptian (1954) with Edmund Purdom in the title role and Michael Wilding as Akhenaten.
