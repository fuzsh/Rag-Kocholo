It will be alive to the best writing of a transnational and comparative nature and will cross canonical chronological divides of the Central Middle Ages, the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period. Renaissance History, Art and Culture intends to spark new ideas and encourage debate on the meanings, extent and influence of the Renaissance within the broader European world. It encourages engagement by scholars across disciplines – history, literature, art history, musicology, and possibly the social sciences – and focuses on ideas and collective mentalities as social, political, and cultural movements that shaped a changing world from ca 1250 to 1650.

Painted when the Italian Renaissance was already waning, it possesses all the formal elegance and chromatic refinement of Mannerism.1 Yet its exquisite responsiveness to different and contrastive tendencies makes it a perfect visual corollary to Cleopatra’s adventures across time and space. The neo-Gothic vogue of the Catholic Reformation gives the composition a nearly feudal aspect; Cleopatra’s headdress resembles that of Matilde of Canossa in another portrait by Fontana (Torino, Galleria Sabauda, inv. 720)2; her clothes have a medieval and warrior-like quality, suggesting the influence of chivalric epic. All that, together with the fascination with Egypt and the exotic, contributes to the mysterious, almost magical atmosphere of the composition (see 3.1, 3.2). Love of the theatre is evident in the choice to represent a moment of high drama, in the striking, vividly coloured costume, and maybe even in the androgynous forms of the subject. Cleopatra, depicted half-length in profile, facing left, emerges from the dark into full light, exalted by a masterly harmonisation of sealing wax red, white, gold and brown. The sheen along the sleeve and the velvet collar further heighten the dazzling effect. She wears a precious, scarlet tiara, divided into four triangular sections. Beneath the headwear, a white veil with a border and dark and yellow stripes moulds, on the front, into a starched, undulating visor and a broad wimple, both ending with a badge. On the back, the veil falls down, covering her ears and the nape of her neck, then folds and comes forward, its end held in the queen’s left hand. Where the visor meets the wimple, a strand of hair demonstrates that this oriental-looking Cleopatra, for a long time mistaken for a ‘Turkish woman’, is in fact blonde, according to the dominant Italian tradition (see 2.2).3 This is no seductress, but a high priestess-queen. Her glance, untroubled by emotion, rests in silent complicity on the asp, and she opens its hiding place with a hieratic gesture, as if initiating some esoteric rite (see 6.5). Her union of West and East is finally exemplified by the details surrounding her. The embossed vase on the left (probably depicting Cronus’ head as the deity of time’s suspension in eternity) has a classical style, while the delicate inlay of the 1 2 3\n\nFor the painting, see Zeri 1954; Vicini; Cannatà-Vicini; Pomeroy 1998.

The essence of her fortune lies in her contradictory image, embodying the two opposite and irreconcilable female stereotypes that have long haunted the male heterosexual imagination: the lascivious enchantress and the steadfast lover. Cleopatra is a hybrid: on the one hand she is the empowered seductress, robbing men of their masculinity; on the other the devoted lover, incapable of surviving her paramour’s death. She commits suicide, the ultimate sin, and she is also a widespread symbol of lust, often depicted as naked, with serpents applied to her breasts. The impossibility of reducing her to a single portrait transforms Cleopatra into a sort of irresistible, quintessential woman, elusive and mysterious. Moreover, her life had something extra: even though it read like fiction, it was based on historical facts, and the public has always been partial to true stories. The history of Cleopatra’s literary tradition is multifarious by default. Each historical age, each European region, each cultural milieu modified her myth, according to its own moral values, its contradictions, its fears and preconceptions. This book considers some of the main adaptations of her story for the Renaissance stage, travelling from Italy to England to arrive finally with Shakespeare. Its organisation is chronological, making it possible to follow the development of the queen’s character and giving the reader the opportunity to identify the inception and changing of a particular motif. Chapter 1 sets out the historical and literary bases of Cleopatra’s myth in the classical period, surveying contemporary works by Greek and Latin authors and focusing on the two opposing images of the last of the Ptolemies that circulated in her lifetime: the lustful corrupter depicted in Augustus’ propaganda, and the monarch-goddess of Cleopatra’s own. The aestheticideological readings of her figure by poets such as Virgil, Horace, Propertius\n\n1 Shakespeare, Ant., i.3.41.\n\nMontanari, A.M., Cleopatra in Italian and English Renaissance Drama.

Chapter 2 moves through late Antiquity and into the Middle Ages, showing how in some late-antique works, Cleopatra is unexpectedly praised for her suicide (Tertullian’s Ad Martyras) or astoundingly exalted as a stateswoman and a sovereign (John, bishop of Nikiu, Al-Mas’udi), while in Europe, by the Middle Ages, national differences in the treatment of this controversial figure began to emerge: the Italians continued to censure the queen of Egypt as a corrupted enemy of Rome (Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio) while English writers seemed to be more interested in the ‘romantic’ side of her relationship with Antony (Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate). The remainder of the analysis centres on Renaissance drama, focusing on Italy and England, but never neglecting the wider context. Chapters 3 and 4, taking the Renaissance renewal of the Cleopatra figure as a starting point, consider, in succession, all the Italian Cleopatra plays produced in the period (Giraldi, De Cesari, Pistorelli, and the anonymous Cleopatra e Marc’Antonio of the Aldini codex 392). These texts demonstrate a neo-Senecan style and a marked concern for contemporary issues. Through extensive textual analysis, I offer an assessment of the different ways in which the queen’s myth is adapted and interpreted by each playwright, in the light of the shifting social and cultural trends of early modern Italy. Chapter 5 crosses the Channel (passing through France), turning to the Elizabethan scene, where the cultural and political implications of the story re-emerge, mingling with different historical factors, including the Reformation, the presence of a queen on the English throne and the autonomous development of English theatre. Pembroke’s translation of Garnier’s tragedy and Daniel’s play provide evidence of the attempts to naturalise a dramatic form which addressed important political questions, such as tyranny and the moral stature of rulers. Samuel Brandon’s Virtuous Octavia, with its adulterous/chaste binary, completes and adds further variety to the picture. Finally, Chapter 6 is dedicated to Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra: the previously acquired data are used to approach the play from a comparative perspective. In each section of the chapter a different aspect of the text is investigated and compared to the corresponding feature in the preceding Cleopatra plays. The concluding argument, naturally emerging from this contrastive analysis, is that, with Antony and Cleopatra, Shakespeare created an unrecorded and unique kind of work, where two different plays (a comedy and a tragedy) consciously coexist from the first act to the beginning of the last one, in which tragedy is finally chosen as the definitive genre.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n19\n\nParadoxical as it may appear, despite her impressive fortune on the stage, Cleopatra’s stature as a ‘dramatic hero’ has been often underestimated. Her life has been considered hard to dramatise. Giraldi Cinthio, in his Lettera sulla tragedia, addressed to Ercole II d’Este (1543), was the first to assert that it was difficult to reduce the tale to a tragic form: Il fare la tragedia dell’argomento che ci porgono gli avenimenti di Cleopatra e di Marco Antonio suo marito […] mi si è offerto, alla prima vista, cosa tanto grave e faticosa, per la maestà delle persone che v’intervengono, che ne sono rimasto spaventato […] io cercherò in ciò di vincere me medesmo per comporne, quanto meglio potrò e saprò, la tragedia […] Ma se forse tardarò più nel compor la Cleopatra che non ho fatto nel comporre le altre due [tragedie], accusine […] il gran maneggio che porta questo real soggetto con esso lui, non la volontà mia prontissima a sempre servirla.2 [Turning the subject offered by Cleopatra’s and by her husband Marco Antonio’s deeds into a tragedy (…) appeared to me, at first sight, such a serious and difficult task, due to the royal state of the people in it, that I was scared by it (…) I shall try to overcome myself in that and to write the tragedy, as well as I know and can (…) But, should I be later in writing the Cleopatra than I was in writing my other two (plays), blame it on (…) the great difficulty that the subject has in itself, not my will, which is always ready to serve you.]3\n\nOver a hundred years later, in the preface to his recasting of Shakespeare’s play, Dryden would insist that the subject was undramatic: That which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater height, was not afforded me by the story; for the crimes of love, which they both committed, where not occasioned by any necessity, or fatal ignorance, but were wholly voluntary; since our passions are, or ought to be, within our power. 4\n\nEminent critics later agreed with Dryden’s charge that the subject had a meagre tragic potential. Furthermore this was a typically ‘closed story,’ whose well-known facts potentially reduced the possibilities of innovation to a minimum. Each re-enactment of the episode had to struggle to find 2 Giraldi, Lettera sulla tragedia, pp. 485-486. See also below 3.4. 3 All translations are my own, unless explicitly stated. 4 Restoration Tragedies, p. 11.\n\n20\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\na way of engendering and maintaining suspense. At the same time, the biography of the queen was so fascinatingly alive with potential political interpretations, so filled with latent sentiments and passions, so suitable for moralising or eroding morals that it seemed to have remained almost as irresistible to dramatists as the historical Cleopatra was said to be to men. The long literary tradition concerning the queen of Egypt has not remained unexplored, yet it largely relies on older surveys, such as the fifth volume of Geoffrey Bullough’s Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (1964); Mary Morrison, ‘Some Aspects of the Treatment of the Theme of Antony and Cleopatra in Tragedies of the Sixteenth Century’ (1974); Marilyn L. Williamson, Infinite Variety: Antony and Cleopatra in Renaissance Drama and Earlier Tradition (1974) and Barbara J. Bono, Literary Transvaluation, From Virgilian Epic to Shakespearean Tragicomedy (1984). There exists no recent integrated assessment of Cleopatra as a dramatic figure, and past studies, although at the time they represented critical landmarks, are now in dire need of updating and completing.5 Since the end of the 1970s, literary texts have no longer been considered as autonomous utterances standing outside history, and criticism has become more theoretically sophisticated. Historical contextualisation, cultural codes, cultural reception, interaction between so-called ‘high’ and ‘popular’ culture are now fully taken into account, and so are theoretical issues such as the representation of race, of ‘otherness’ and of women’s roles, all of which now naturally demand investigation in relation to the subject of Cleopatra. Other kinds of broader and more specific questions also now demand interrogation, such as the implications of drama as a form distinguished from the other literary writings of the Renaissance, or the controversies and doubts about Chaucer’s intention in his Legend of Good Women. Recently there has also been a reassessment of Italian neoclassical tragedy, once almost universally condemned. This reassessment has taken as its starting point the assumption that the general censure of this form was based on anachronistic expectations, conditioned by Romantic and Classicising prejudices and by a post-Shakespearian perspective.6 Some recent studies 5 At first sight, the list of antecedents might also include Lucy Hughes-Hallett, Cleopatra, as well; but Hughes-Hallett’s brilliant work does not deal with the queen of Egypt as a literary character, but rather as a universal icon, and literary quotations have a marginal place in her study. An important contribution to our knowledge of the English Cleopatra plays is provided by the study of the subject by Yasmin Arshad, whose articles on Daniel’s Cleopatra are superlative. As her research does not have a comparative cut and explores the staging of drama in detail, I see it as necessary and complementary work to my own. 6 Ariani 1974; Guerrieri Crocetti; Di Maria; Morrison and Osborn; Morrison 1997.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n21\n\nhave had the merit of rectifying the errors and misconceptions of traditional scholarship, focusing renewed attention onto cultural contexts such as the new conception of dramatic space, the relevance of religion, and the definition of female status in male-authored texts.7 Regarding the English stage, we have definitively abandoned the long-held view of the so-called Pembroke circle, which was charged with having competed with Shakespeare and the commercial public theatre through the importation of a French, neo-Senecan model. This view profoundly influenced the twentieth-century reception of both Jodelle’s and Garnier’s plays and of Pembroke’s Antonius, and even altered the understanding of Daniel’s different versions of his tragedy. At the same time the role of so-called closet-drama has been re-evaluated (see below 5.2). In the twenty-first century, any approach to Renaissance theatre must necessarily adopt new perspectives and move away from the models of past criticism. In my study many interwoven aspects of the Cleopatra plays are taken into account: from the changes in rhetorical strategies employed by the different dramatists in treating the story as they had received it from the preceding tradition, to the sources, genre, and structure of the plays, not forgetting the interaction between the various characters. The originality of this book lies precisely in its particular interweaving of different threads. I take each entire play as a starting point and remain as close as possible to the text. Through textual analysis I am able both to emphasise the changes in the depiction of the character of the queen of Egypt, and to address many different contemporary issues, such as the domestication of foreignness, female types of heroism, the question of suicide, women as rulers, the concept of clemency, racial binaries and finally free will and predestination. As I decided to use the study of character as a way to provide fresh insights into dramatic texts, a more selective approach would end up being reductive. The method I pursue in this book is not often attempted: in most recent books dealing with Cleopatra literary texts are used rather as a means to illustrate socio-anthropological readings and not vice versa. Thanks to the prominence given to the plays, my enquiry on the one hand, provides a wide enough choice of examples to demonstrate the objectivity of the analysis in each case; on the other hand it combines close literary analysis with social history, a study of Western culture and its cognitive conflicts. My discussion of each Cleopatra play quotes from the original-language versions and also provides the corresponding English translation. Where on occasion I have employed the parallel-text method, this by no means 7\n\nOn the ‘defects of the Senecan medium’, see, for example, Williamson 1974, p. 131.\n\n22\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\nimplies a search for stylistic or thematic echoes, as this study does not deal with literary antecedents, direct contact or indirect absorption, and does not postulate any kind of source-text relationship among the various Cleopatra plays taken into account. It rather investigates the nexuses of continuity and the dynamics of change within the process of re-evaluation of the queen of Egypt’s figure, against changing backgrounds. Following the early development of the Cleopatra-narrative necessitates a series of precautions. Defining tragedies, even within this relatively short chronological arc, is very difficult, given that a variety of different meanings have been attached to the genre. Each work needs to be considered within the conception of drama it exemplifies. Secondly, the notion of character as a coherent and stable entity has suffered over the course of twentiethcentury turns in criticism. The integrity of fictional selves has increasingly been regarded with distrust, chiefly for fear of the anachronism of treating personages as real people. In relation to the current debates on the subject I share Lyne’s position in taking ‘what has become a counter-approach’ and give ‘the characters a large stake, and great credit, for their words and what they represent’.8 The study of the literary tradition about Cleopatra is a complex and fluid task and it requires a flexible attitude. My hope is that a global reconsideration of her place in the works examined here will shed light on the discrepancies, the fears and hopes, the dramatic conventions and innovations of early modern Italy and England.\n\n8\n\nLyne 2011, p. 26.

Classical writers could introduce characters, alter events, and invent speeches with impunity, as it was considered perfectly acceptable in the interest of rhetorical impact.3 What is more, history is generally written, or rewritten, by the victors, and Antony and Cleopatra lost the war.4 1 ‘Non humilis mulier’, see Horace, Odes and Epodes, trad. by Rudd, i.37.32. 2 Thompson 2003.

Little survives by contemporary authors. A few fragments make up what we have of Octavian’s Autobiography, whose partiality is well known.5 The only biographical work we still have, the Res Gestae Divi Augusti – a sort of long inscription that was to adorn his monument – is a masterpiece of ambiguity and omissions: Antony is not even mentioned by name.6 It was on the memoirs of Caesar’s heir that Nicolaus Damascenus (c. 64 BC-c. AD 5) would later draw for his life of Augustus, which is only partially extant. Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita lacks his retelling of the Battle of Actium and what we are left with, the so-called Periochae or Summaries – an abridgment of an epitome – are little more than a laconic list of events, albeit enough to tell us that Livy favoured Octavian.7 Born a few years after Julius Caesar, Cicero – one of the most famous victims of the proscriptions – did not write any historical narratives. In his Philippics, however, he creates a venomous picture of Antony which is not easily forgotten. He describes him as a drunken giant (ii.63), as a dissolute man (iii.28), and as a tyrant (xiii.18).8 If that was Antony, what could Cleopatra have been like? Morally condemnation of one amounted to moral condemnation of both.9 Later writers were influenced by those who came before them. Velleius Paterculus was so devoted to the nouveau régime that, in his Compendium, he defines Octavian’s victory as ‘fortuna publica’ [‘public fortune’] (ii.86.1).10 The next three historical narratives which cover Cleopatra’s life all date roughly from the time of Hadrian’s reign. Two out of three are biographies: Suetonius wrote a life of Augustus Caesar in Latin, Plutarch a life of Antony in Greek. Suetonius’ De Vitae Caesarum is filled with gossip and anecdotes. His interest in the morally corrupting consequences of absolute power casts a shadow on his portrayals of both Octavian and his enemies: 5 Pelling 1999, p. 26. 6 See, for instance, Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History. Res Gestae Divi Augusti, 4.24. On the literary and historical value of the account, see Syme, pp. 522-524. 7 See, for example, the summary of Book cxxxii in Livy, Summaries. 8 Cicero, Philippics.

On his figure, see also Roberts; Southern 1998b; Southern 2007; Shotter, p. 88; Pelling 1996, p. 8. 9 Cleopatra is never mentioned in the orations, but Cicero shows his dislike for her in his correspondence. See Ad Att., 362 (xiv.8.1), 374 (xiv.20.2), 393 (xv.15.2). He repeats his charges against Antony in his letters: Ad Att. 357 (xiv.3.2), 359 (xiv.5.1), 366 (xiv.12.1), 399 (xv.22), Fam., xii.4.1, xii.25.4. Cicero’s ghost appears among the dramatis personae of the anonymous Renaissance play Cleopatra e Marc’Antonio of the Aldini codex 392, now in the library of the University of Pavia, Italy. See below 4.3. 10 See also ii.85.1, ii.87.1-2. On Velleius Paterculus, see Woodman. His brief court history was written during the reign of Tiberius.\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n25\n\nEt Antonium quidem seras condiciones pacis temptantem ad mortem adegit viditque mortuum. Cleopatrae, quam servatam triumpho magno opere cupiebat, etiam Psyllos admovit, qui venenum ac virus exsugerent, quod perisse morsu aspidis putabatur. Ambobus communem sepulturae honorem tribuit ac tumulum ab ipsis in cohatum perfici iussit. [xvii.4] [Although Antony tried to make terms at the eleventh hour, Augustus forced him to commit suicide, and viewed his corpse. He greatly desired to save Cleopatra alive for his triumph, and even had Psylli brought to her, to suck the poison from her wound, since it was thought that she had died from the bite of an asp. He allowed them both the honour of burial, and in the same tomb, giving orders that the mausoleum which they had begun should be finished.]11\n\nNevertheless, his reconstruction of events is within the general guidelines of Octavian’s official propaganda. Plutarch’s Ἀντώνιος is, in fact, the biography of a couple: it is the first time the queen features to such an extent.12 Plutarch recounts both Antony’s vices and virtues, but, on the whole, he judges him as a capable man, ruined in the end by his own faults.13 The depiction of Cleopatra is crueller, as though she is considered the real foe. Antony is made out to be no more than a puppet in her hands: Ἡ δέ Κλεοπάτρα τὴν κολακείαν οὐχ, ὥσπερ ὁ Πλάτων φησί, τετραχῇ, πολλαχῇ δὲ διελοῦσα, καὶ σπουδῆς ἁπτομένῳ καὶ παιδιᾶς ἀεί τινα καινὴν ἡδονὴν ἐπιφέρουθσα καὶ χάριν, διεπαιδαγώγει τὸν Ἀντώνιον οὔτε νυκτὸς οὔτε ἡμέρας ἀνιεῖσα. καὶ γὰρ συνεκύβευε καὶ συνέπινε καὶ συνεθήρευε καὶ γυμωαζόμενον ἐν ὅπλοις ἐθεᾶτο, καὶ νύκτωρ προσισταμένῳ θύραις καὶ θυρίσι δημοτῶν καὶ σκώπτοντι τοὺς ἔνδον συνεπλανᾶτο καὶ συνήλυε θεραπαινιδίου στολὴν λαμβάωουσα.

She played at dice with him, drank with him, hunted with him, and watched him as he exercised himself in arms; and when by night he would station himself at the doors or windows of the common folk and scoff at those within, she would go with him on his round of mad follies, wearing the garb of a serving maiden.]\n\nPlutarch consulted conflicting sources – many first hand – and liberally drew on philo-Augustan and philo-Antonian accounts as he wished. As such, his picture of Cleopatra is multifaceted and contradictory.15 Nevertheless, despite his attempt to preserve stories which differed from the official history, he did nothing to destroy the tópos of a war of East against West.16 Even more bitter hostility can be felt throughout Florus’ Epitomae de Tito Livio, the third historical account written in the age of Hadrian.17 He even calls Octavian’s forces at Actium ‘we’, while Antony’s men are referred to as ‘the enemy’.18 His version of Antony and Cleopatra’s romance is both striking and compelling: the queen turns Antony into a monster (ii.21.4.11.3). Unlike Plutarch (Ant., 85), he sets the queen’s death in the Egyptian mausoleum: Ibi maximos, ut solebat, induta cultus in referto odoribus solio iuxta suum se conlocavit Antonium, admotisque ad venas serpentibus sic morte quasi somno soluta est. (ii.21.4.11.11) [There, having put on the elaborate raiment which she was wont to wear, she placed herself by the side of her beloved Antonius in a coffin filled with rich perfumes, and applying serpents to her veins thus passed into death as into a sleep.]19\n\nThe f inal simile between sleep and death, enriched throughout a long Romance tradition, passing through Petrarch (TM, 1.166-172) and Boccaccio’s Latin works (De Casibus, vi.15.17), will eventually find its way to Shakespeare’s tragedy (v.2.338-342).20 15 Ant., 27.2-4, 53.3-6, 84; Comparison, 1.3. See Pelling 1999, pp. 26-36. 16 Ant., 60.1. 17 This title is – at least in part – misleading, as in fact Florus drew on different traditions.

For the motif in philo-Augustan poetry, see below 1.2. In his Etymologies, 12.4 (De serpentibus)\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n27\n\nA further historical work, by Appian, was possibly completed during the reign of Antoninus Pius (AD 138-161). His Roman History is generally regarded as relatively objective. One of his sources was probably Pollio’s History of the Civil War. Pollio had been a personal friend of Caesar and later become a partisan of Antony.21 However, Appian covered the matter of Egypt in a part of the fifth book that has been lost to us.22 In the extant section of his chronicle we find evidence of his cool judgement, but his neutral attitude seems chiefly restricted to a certain indulgence towards Antony’s conduct in his private life (Bell. Civ., v.8, 9, 76). The Roman History does not add anything really novel or unexpected to our knowledge of Cleopatra. The final reconstruction of the bellum cum Antonio et Cleopatra to be mentioned is that by Cassius Dio.23 It was composed about AD 200-222, with Livy as its principal source on the Civil Wars.24 Dio starts telling the same, familiar story, in the same, reproachful tone, claiming that Antony ‘became the Egyptian woman’s slave’ (xlviii.24.2). Yet if Plutarch had hinted at Cleopatra’s attempts to come to an agreement with Octavian,25 Dio goes further. He tells a tale of deception and betrayal. According to him, after the Battle of Actium, Octavian sent his libertus Thyrsus to the queen, to declare his love for her. Cleopatra rose to the bait and secretly switched her allegiance to him. She led Antony to believe that she had committed suicide, hoping he would take his life, which he did. Only after meeting the victor, when she realised that she could not seduce him, did she decide to kill herself and finally succeeded.26 Dio’s conclusion is curt: Κλεοπάτρα δὲ ἄπληστος μὲν Ἀφροδίτης ἄπληστος δὲ χρημάτων γενομένη, καὶ πολλῇ μὲν φιλοτιμίᾳ φιλοδόξῳ πολλῇ δὲ καὶ περιφρονήσει θρασείᾳ χρησαμένη, τήν τε βασιλείαν τὴν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ὑπ᾽ἔρωτος ἐκτήσατο, καὶ τὴν τῶν Ῥωμαίων 14, Isidore of Seville gives a scientific explanation of the phenomenon, stating that Cleopatra was poisoned by a hypnalis, a snake of the same family as the asp, which is so called because it induces sleep in his victims. Before him, see Solinus, A Collection of Memorable Facts, 27.31, quoted in Gurval 2011, p. 60. Among Italian Renaissance tragedies, see Giraldi, Cleopatra tragedia, v.6.423; Cleopatra e Marc’Antonio, Aldini codex 392 (v.355). 21 On his exemplary behaviour, see, for instance, Vell. Paterculus, ii.86. 22 According to Fotius’ widely accepted description (cod.57, pp. 15, 21b-17a Bekker), Appian’s Roman History consisted of 24 books. We now have Books 6-8; part of Book 9; Books 11-17, plus the introduction to Book 4 and some fragments. The five books on the civil wars correspond to Books 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 of the original corpus. 23 This, that we follow, is the Roman order of his names. The Greek order was Δίων ὁ Κάσσιος. His praenomen is unknown. See Cary 1914, p. vii (the English version is his own). Dio’s books about the Civil Wars are part of that third of his History which has come down to us. 24 On the disputed question of Dio’s sources, Millar; Gabba 1955; Reinhold. 25 Ant., 73, 74, 76. 26 Dio, li 9-14.\n\n28\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\nλήψεσθαι δι᾽αὐτοῦ ἐλπίσασα ταύτης τε ἐσφάλη καὶ ἐκείνην προσαπώλεσε, δύο τε ἀνδρῶν Ῥωμαίων τῶν καθ᾽ἑαυτὴν μεγίστων κατεκράτησε, καὶ διὰ τὸν τρίτον ἑαυτὴν κατεχρήσατο. (li.15.4) [Cleopatra was of insatiable passion and insatiable avarice; she was swayed often by laudable ambition, but often by overweening effrontery. By love she gained the title of Queen of the Egyptians, and when she hoped by the same means to win also that of Queen of the Romans, she failed of this and lost the other besides. She captivated the two greatest Romans of her day, and because of the third she destroyed herself.]\n\nThis is the general tenor of what we can gather from the Greco-Roman historians.27 The variety of trifles and insignificant details we are able to put together – from them, and other writers who touched upon these events – is striking, but it does not bring us any closer to the truth.28 In fact, we do not even know whether Octavian wanted Cleopatra dead, and encouraged her suicide, or wanted her alive for his triumph and was thwarted.29 The significant fact is that when Cleopatra died, in 30 BC, aged 39, she had already become a semi-mythologised figure.30 There were at least two different images of the queen in circulation while she was alive. The first was that portrayed in Octavian’s propaganda: an irresistible Circe, who led men to their ruin. Her guilty love had perverted Antony, threatening to destroy the res publica.31 27 There are minor documents not considered here, for instance, Eutropius, Breviarium ab urbe condita, 7.1-7; Zonaras, Epitome Historiarum, 10.29-31; Orosius, Historiae adversus paganos, vi.18-19; Anon (Aurelius Victor), Liber de viris Illustribus, 79, 85-86. Some of them will be discussed below 2.1. Strabo’s summary of the events is in keeping with the official version (Geography, xvii.1.11). He gives two different explanations for Cleopatra’s death: the asp or a poison ‘applied directly into her body’ (Gurval 2011, p. 55). Pliny the Elder also stresses Augustus’ ‘uprightness’ (Miles 2011a, p. 5). 28 We know, for example, that Cleopatra had golden thrones (Dio, xlix.40); that she wore an amethyst ring (Ant. Palat., IX 752); that she possessed a murrineus calix; that she wrote messages on onyx tablets (Plut., Ant., 58.6); that she had golden dishes (Suet., Aug., lxxi.1) and wonderful pearl earrings (Pliny, Nat. Hist., IX 119-122 [lviii]; Macrobius, 3.17.15-18). 29 On modern scholars’ scepticism about Octavian’s attempts to prevent her suicide, see Pelling 1996, pp. 64-65. For current views of Cleopatra’s suicide, see Whitehorne, pp. 186-196. 30 For similar remarks, from a different perspective, see Hughes-Hallett, pp. 95-102. Modern historians are divided into Cleopatra’s detractors and supporters; on opposite positions, for instance, see Bevan, p. 381; Volkmann, p. 195. 31 The Jewish historian Josephus (AD 37/38-98), in his Jewish Antiquities (Ant., xiv.324), also states that after meeting Antony in Cilicia, Cleopatra turned him into a slave of love. See also Josephus, Jewish War, i.243, 359. Josephus is one of the few ancient historians who did not see events through Roman eyes. Regrettably, this does not prevent him from violently attacking\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n29\n\nOctavian and Antony were fighting for supreme power in Rome, with no real legal or moral case on either side. Caesar’s heir was in need of a tangible foreign enemy upon whom he could declare war, in order to claim that he was defending his native country and Cleopatra was perfect for that role.32 Preconceptions, exaggeration, stereotypes and credulity did the rest. In ancient times, the East – traditionally def ined as an ethnic and geographical antimodel – did not possess clearly defined boundaries. It could encompass both Numidia and India, Egypt and Media. Just like the North, it was substantially identified with ‘those who are different from us’.33 Cleopatra was both a foreigner and a woman and became an ideal embodiment of the dangerous seductions of the East, with its lax morals, its decadent corruption, and its sumptuous wealth.34 It was a potent contrast to the Roman virtues of discipline, rationality, pietas, duty and self-control By putting his passion and private life before his Roman identity and the common interest of the state, Antony had renounced his true self. Plutarch compares his culpable behaviour with that of Hercules, stripped of his lion’s skin and of his club by Omphale, queen of Lydia: giving way to the folly of passion had emasculating effects.35 Omphale’s domination over Hercules was one of the motifs of the Augustan literary references to Antony and Cleopatra. The queen, selfish, cowardly and frivolous, was clearly unfit to rule. In Egypt, state matters were decided by eunuchs, hairdressers and manicurists.36 Before Actium, she foolishly and shamefully argued against a land battle and then, in the middle of the fight, and, lacking virile courage, she sailed away.37 The second Cleopatra was that created by her own propaganda, the goddess-queen who governed a great and noble country.38 The Ptolemies Cleopatra, as his point of view is that of her enemy Herod, king of Judaea. See, for instance, Ant., xv.91, and The Life. Against Apion, ii.57-58. 32 Res Gestae, 25.

Alex., xxiv; Cicero, Pro C. Rabirio Postumo, 12.35; Dio, xxxix.58. 35 Ant., Comparison, 3.3-4, see Plutarch, Demetrius and Antony, trans. by Perrin. For Hercules and Omphale, see Ovid, Fasti, ii.317-326; Heroides, ix.73-80. In his Bellum Civile, Lucan compares Cleopatra to Helen of Troy (x.60-62). Both Helen and Cleopatra were symbols of the destructive power of female charm (Bono and Tessitore, pp. 50-52). For the inversion of gender roles attributed to Egypt in antiquity, see Vasunia, pp. 92-100; Pucci, p. 196. 36 Plut., Ant., 60.1. 37 Plut., Ant., 62, 63.5-6, 66; Dio, l.33.1-2. Note that, according to most scholars, the battle was in fact only an attempt on Antony’s part to break out and escape with as many ships as possible and with the treasure chest. See, above all, Carter, pp. 215-227; Pelling 1996, pp. 54-59; Mackay, pp. 358-359. 38 See Ashton, p. 21.\n\n30\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\nclaimed kinship with Dionysus, via Alexander the Great. Furthermore, for 250 years, Egyptian queens had been associated with Isis, the powerful, multifaceted deity of love and abundance, generally identified with Aphrodite. Cleopatra, on public occasions, often wore the garb of the goddess.39 Daniel’s dramatic version of the regina rhetorically asks: ‘Am I the woman, whose inventive pride, / (Adorn’d like Isis,) scornd mortalitie?’ (i.33-34). 40 Isis was also the protector of women, and Cleopatra promoted women where she could. She restored priestess Aba to the throne of Cilicia, against her father, Zenophanes, and tried to help Alexandra in avenging her son Aristobulus, even though it may be suspected, in both cases, that her ultimate intention was to support rulers of royal blood. 41 Among the followers of the cult of Dionysus (Cleopatra’s family religion) women had high visibility, enjoyed great freedom and had many rights, so much so that Dionysiac males were often accused of being dominated by their wives, one of the charges against Antony himself (Plut., Ant., 10.3).42 Within the upper and learned classes, education of girls was typical and socially accepted, and women often acquired literary skills.43 Female members of the highest ranks of the aristocracy could act as counsellors and regents. This philogynistic stance was very different from the misogynistic standard which dominated in ancient Greece, a standard shared and articulated by Aristotle himself, in his History of Animals and Politics.44 The attitude towards women in Rome was complex but more positive, at least for the elite classes, and included the notion of ‘same and other’. 45 Nonetheless, in Latin literature, women defying their husband’s authority and taking autonomous decisions were often presented as maenads, like Amata in Virgil’s Aeneid (vii.373-405). Cleopatra, an intellectually empowered stateswoman, challenged the view of male superiority. 46 39 Wyke, pp. 100-103, 107. For the female role in the cult of Isis, see Heyob, Takács, pp. 78-95 discusses the political reasons for Augustus’ ambiguous relationship with the cult of Isis. 40 All quotations are taken from Delia and Rosamond Augmented.

For the Dionysiac rites, see Segal; Detienne; Henrichs. 43 Plutarch, a priest of Apollo, was also initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus and his wife Timoxena, for instance, wrote essays with his approbation. Plutarch himself dedicated some of his books to his friend Clea, a priestess of Dionysus and a devotee of Isis (Isis and Osiris, 35.1). He also composed for her his collection of stories about women’s bravery. 44 For the status of women in ancient Greece and antiquity in general, see Blundell; Pomeroy 1995.

Many Egyptians still perceived the Lagides as foreign usurpers, and so she did her utmost to legitimate her position. She was the first of her House to speak Egyptian fluently. 47 She improved the living conditions of the lower-class Alexandrians, winning the indigenous peoples over to her side. 48 Under her rule, Egypt probably thrived. 49 Supported by oracles, later altered or destroyed by Augustus, she tried to present herself as a sort of liberator, born to free the Oriental world from Rome’s yoke and to join Europe and Asia as equal.50 The queen’s arrival in Tarsus (41 BC), the celebration following the conquest of Armenia – be it a Roman triumph or not51 – and the donations of Alexandria (34 BC) were politically effective shows for the benefit of her subjects.52 Her policy was not at all inconsistent with that of Antony and of Rome in the East. Direct rule of the eastern lands was uneconomic and dangerous, because of the private ambitions and greed of proconsuls and financiers.53 Thus the dependent kings became clientes, lesser partners, of Rome, accepting its representative as their patronus, protector and benefactor. Thanks to minor territorial extensions and to some economic advantages, Cleopatra could present herself to the Egyptians as restoring her heritage, while Antony was exercising control over the area in the name of his fatherland. Some other aspects of this system were unavoidable. Eastern countries worshipped their kings: that was the only way to legitimate despotism. No Roman conqueror could avoid being regarded as a monarch and a divinity. The Antonii traditionally boasted that they were descendants of Hercules and Mark Antony identified with Dionysus (while Octavian’s patron god 47 Plut., Ant., 27.3-4. Pelling, in his notes, considers her flair for languages ‘suspiciously conventional’, but see Gruen, p. 50 n. 12. Mastery of foreign languages is a distinctive trait of other great female monarchs, such as Zenobia, queen of Palmyra (Trebellius Pollio, SHA, Tyranni Triginta 30. 21).

Politics and religion became entangled. Antony thought he could reshape Roman religious life by largely substituting it with Hellenistic cults and culture. Octavian wanted to revive Roman traditions and combine them with the Hellenistic world. When Antony was defeated a whole political concept was lost.55 Octavian’s victory also signified the victory of his interpretation of the war, but his deliberate manipulation of history proved productive in unexpected ways. The fame of the real Cleopatra, with an efficient government, unexceptional private life, and ill-advised alliances, would not probably have survived beyond her death. In his Augusti Vita Suetonius claims that, as he approached to his death, Octavian revealed that he saw his life as a pageant. He asked his friends whether he had played his part fittingly and quoted a traditional Greek tag, inviting them to give him a final round of applause.56 It is curious to note that, through his propaganda, he succeeded in turning his fierce enemies into characters much more attractive than himself. In the Renaissance plays on the Actium War, he would never be the protagonist. Daniel’s Cleopatra almost steals his lines: ‘And now o Earth, the Theater where I / Have acted this, witnes I dye unforst’ (v.2.1590-1591).\n\n1.2\n\nThe ‘Egyptian Wife’57\n\nWhile ancient historians wrote condemning Cleopatra, poets sang of their hatred, fear and reluctant admiration for her. In their verse, for the first time, the queen became a full literary personage.58 54 For the divine associations, see Suet., Aug., lxx; Virgil, Buc., iv.

Augustanism was not an unchanging picture and individual attitudes varied inside a dynamic situation (Kenney, p. 3).

Virgil’s passage is almost unanimously acclaimed.59 Technically speaking, it is an ekphrasis, a description of images engraved on a shield. Just like Achilles before him (Il., xviii.478-608), Aeneas receives this magnificent piece of work, forged for him by Vulcan, from his divine mother.60 Depicted on the clipeus is a selection of scenes, showing the triumphs of Rome from Romulus to Augustus. The centrepiece is the Actian confrontation in its official version: an epic clash of the East against the West. Anthropomorphic Olympian deities fight Anubis and a host of bestial Oriental idols, while Apollo leads Octavian and his fleet (ll. 675-713). Cleopatra is identified through a periphrasis and relegated to the role of Antony’s foreign ally and paramour, bound to her companion by unholy ties [‘nefas Aegyptia coniunx’] (l. 688).61 Almost paradoxically, however, she is better served by the untarnished propaganda of the Aeneid than by the ironic and bitter lines of Roman elegiac poets. In the opening section (ll. 675-690), she simply moves in Antony’s wake, as he leads his barbarian army across the sea. In the second (ll. 696-700), she is portrayed as a noble and terrible enemy, calling upon her ‘monstruosa Aegypti numina’ [‘monstruous Egyptian gods’] (in Servius’ words, n. 678.6) unaware of the snake-shaped twin symbols of Death hunting her (‘necdum etiam geminos a tergo respicit anguis’ [‘nor as yet casts back a glance at the twin snakes behind’] l. 697). In the third section (ll. 707-713), she turns into one of Virgil’s favourite characters: the vanquished foe. Chased by a pale, cruel destiny, she repairs to the blue, protecting embrace of the mourning (‘maerentem’) Nile (l. 711): ipsa videbatur ventis regina vocatis vela dare et laxos iam iamque immittere funis. illam inter caedes pallentem morte futura fecerat ignipotens undis et Iapyge ferri, Ovid, Tristia, iv.10.41-54. For the importance of poetry to guarantee a good name to Augustus, see Ariosto, Orl. Fur., xxxv.26.1-4. 59 On Virgil and Augustan politics, see Lyne 1983; Rudd; Gurval 1995, pp. 209-247. 60 For Aeneas’ shield, see Becker; West. 61 Ovid defines her with almost the same words, ‘coniux Aegiptia’, in his eulogy to Augustus (Met., xv.826). Anubis will keep on barking at least up to when Prudentius was writing (Contra Symmachus, 532). Pembroke will turn Garnier’s ‘venerable’ Anubis (ii.678) into the ‘barking’ Anubis of ancient tradition (ii.685). For the Roman aversion to zoomorphic Egyptian deities, see Giovenal, Satires, 15.\n\n34\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\ncontra autem magno maerentem corpore Nilum pandentemque sinus et tota veste vocantem caeruleum in gremium latebrosaque flumina victos. [The queen herself was seen to woo the winds, spread sail, and now, even now, fling loose the slackened sheets. Her, amid the carnage, the Lord of Fire had fashioned pale at the coming of death, borne on by waves and the wind of Iapyx; while over against her was the mourning Nile, of mighty frame, opening wide his folds and with all his raiment welcoming the vanquished to his azure lap and sheltering streams.]\n\nHorace’s portrait is not so kind.62 In his Epode 9 (the earliest treatment of the historical event that we have, although the exact date of composition is unknown) Cleopatra is only an extra, the perverse femina who has enslaved and unmanned Antony (‘Romanus […] emancipatus feminae’ [‘A Roman enslaved to a woman’], 9.11-16). Conversely she is the protagonist of Horace’s other piece on Actium, the so-called Cleopatra’s Ode (i.37). Here her figure is twofold: in the opening lines, she is a drunken megalomaniac, but subsequently the ‘fatal monster’ [‘fatale monstrum’] (l. 21) turns into a courageous monarch, full of pride and ready to face death, as long as she can avoid humiliation (i.37.25-32)63: ausa et iacentem visere regiam vultu sereno, fortis et asperas tractare serpentis, ut atrum corpore combiberet venenum, deliberata morte ferocior, saevis Liburnis scilicet invidens privata deduci superbo non humilis mulier triumpho. [She had the strength of mind to gaze on her ruined palace with a calm countenance, and the courage to handle the sharp-toothed serpents, letting her body drink in their black venom. Once she had resolved to die she was all the more defiant – determined, no doubt, to cheat the cruel Liburnians: she would not be stripped of her royalty and conveyed to face a jeering triumph: no humble woman she.] 62 For Horace and Cleopatra, see Wilkinson; Johnson 1967; Nisbet; Gurval 1995, pp. 137-165. 63 The word monstrum has multiple meanings and is closer here to the Latin ‘prodigy’ than to the English ‘monster’ (Gurval 2011, p. 65).\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n35\n\nHorace’s picture is complex and contradictory in many ways. Propertius’ Cleopatra, on the contrary, is unambiguous: in iii.11, his description is pure vituperation.64 At the opening of the elegy (ll. 1-28), before he turns his attention to the queen of Egypt, the lyric subject asserts that it is no wonder he is enslaved under the rule of a woman, and gives a long list of examples of dominant female figures, including Medea, Omphale, Penthesilea and Semiramis. In some cases, the association of Cleopatra with these characters proves a tenacious one. The simile with Omphale resurfaces in Garnier’s play (Marc Antoine, iii.1216-1229), and in the anonymous play Cleopatra e Marc’Antonio in the Aldini codex 392 (i Canto di Hercole, 73-74).65 Semiramis meets Cleopatra again in Juvenal’s Satires (2.108-109) and later on will share her fate in Dante’s Inferno (v.52-63), Petrarch’s Triumphi (TF2, 106-107) and Boccaccio’s Filocolo (iv.42.9). Medea will be compared with her in Jodelle’s Cleopatre captive (i.309-310). Perhaps Shakespeare remembered Propertius’ line 30 (‘famulos inter femina trita suos’ [‘a woman who fornicated even with her slaves’]), when his Antony defines his lover: ‘one that looks on feeders’ (Ant., iii.13.111).66 The second part of the elegy is dedicated to Cleopatra herself (iii.11.29-56). She is the ‘harlot queen of licentious Canopus’ [‘incesti meretrix regina Canopi’ (l. 39)], who wanted ‘to force the Tiber to endure the threats of the Nile’ and aspired to become empress of the Urbs (31-32).67 Even the unusual apostrophe of lines 51-54, within a Virgil-like passage (‘Yet you fled to the wandering outlets of the craven Nile – not that your hands received Roman fetters. You endured the sight of your arms bitten by the sacred asps and your limbs channelling the stealthy route of the numbing poison’),68 is immediately denied by the derision of lines 55-56, with their allusion to ‘a tongue dreanched in ceaseless toping’ [‘assiduo lingua sepulta mero’]. Scholars usually quarrel over the general meaning of Propertius’ elegy, but certainly the portrait of Cleopatra is clear: she is an incestuous prostitute, a degenerate descendant of Philip II of Macedonia (according to the 64 On Propertius, see Nethercut and especially Gurval 1995, pp. 189-208.

It is better this way: a woman would be a poor trophy, in those streets through which Jugurtha was once led (ll. 65-66).71 Modern criticism has often reinterpreted both Horace’s lyric Cleopatra and Propertius’ elegiac one, asserting that such talented poets would regard with scepticism the image of the barbarian seductress promoted by Augustus. Their attacks against her were simply a way to dismiss and ridicule his propaganda.72 Nevertheless, Renaissance dramatists understood it as history. Our survey of Augustan poetry would, however, be incomplete if, at this point, we did not go back to Virgil. By general admission, Aen., viii.626-713 is not the only passage of his epic where the ghost of Cleopatra is conjured up. Maro also had her in mind when he created Dido of Carthage. The ancient myth of Dido-Elissa – which had been rewritten and adapted for the occasion, both chronologically and conceptually – was bound to become entwined with the story of Cleopatra, whose memory was still fresh at the time.73 Both African queens had chosen a foreign warrior as a lover; both had given their relationship the name of marriage (Aen., iv.171-172). When the poet writes: ‘nunc hiemem inter se luxu, quam longa, fovere / regnorum immemores turpique cupidine captos’ [‘now they while away the winter, all its length, in wanton ease together’] (Aen., iv.193-194), his readers are (and certainly were) immediately reminded of the lovers of Alexandria.74 Above all, Dido and Cleopatra were associated in the public imagination by their self-inflicted deaths. Their suicides have often been given the same significance, having been variously read as an ultimate demonstration of love, a refuge from pain, a redemption through the so-called Romana mors, 69 For a contrasting examination of Horace’s and Propertius’ Cleopatras, see Cremona. 70 Johnson 1974, pp. 152-180; Connor; Cairns; Gurval 1995, pp. 249-278. 71 For this motif in De Cesari, see below 4.1. See also Williamson 1974, pp. 22-23. 72 Johnson 1967, p. 399. Simply considering these poems as ‘anti-Augustan’, however, brings a number of problems: see Feeney. 73 Dido has left us with two vestigial reflections: where Pompeius Trogus (followed by Macrobius, Sat., 5.18; Augustine, Conf., i.13.22; Hierolamus, Adv. Jovinianum, i.43; Justinus, Ep. Hist., xviii.6.1-7, and so on) had represented her as a chaste widow, Virgil depicted her as a seduced lover, two identities destined to intertwine through the centuries and to produce works of opposite interpretations. See Bono and Tessitore; Ferguson, pp. 19-22. 74 For quotations and translations, see Virgil, Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid I-VI, trans. by Fairclough. Gurval (2011, p. 70) notes that Virgil uses almost the same words to describe the two dying queens: ‘pallentem morte futura’ for Cleopatra (viii.709) and ‘pallida morte futura’ for Dido (iv.644).\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n37\n\na means of recovering both dignity and the status of monarch, or as mere revenge.75 Dido, however, was no Cleopatra. She could not be presented as a whore, as that would tarnish Aeneas, too. She had to remain an admirable infelix regina. Virgil’s hero, in his turn, was above all a projection of Octavian, maybe partly of Caesar, but not of Antony, although, at least in the first part of the amatio, they had both apparently forgotten their national identity and duty. Iarba’s description of his rival in Aen., iv.215-217 (‘et nunc ille Paris cum semiviro comitatu, / Maeonia mentum mitra crinemque madentem / subnexus, rapto potitur’ [‘And now that Paris, with his eunuch train, his chin and perfumed locks bound with a Lydian turban, grasps the spoil’]) corresponds almost exactly to the image of Antony spread by Augustan propaganda and poetry (Horace, Epode 9.11-16, or Florus, ii.21.4.11.1-3).76 The basic scheme of the unmanned-warrior and the love-enchantress had its cosmological prototype in the Venus and Mars episode (Homer, Odyssey, viii.266-366; Ovid, Met., iv.170-189; Ars. Am., ii.561-600). This, in its turn, shared a common root with the topos of Hercules unarmed by Omphale. Hercules and Mars had a traditional allegiance, as types of the warrior-hero. So little by little, in artistic depictions, Mars would sometimes lend his sword and helmet to the Alcides, whereas Venus would add some of her goddess’ charm to Omphale. Yet while the Mars-Venus paring, through the philosophical reading of Lucretius’ De rerum natura, was progressively given the positive meaning of concordia discors, the Hercules-Omphale relationship maintained all its negative significance of vile subjugation to lust.77 Though Virgil drew on these mythic archetypes, he focused primarily on the human side of Dido and Aeneas’ affair, a decision which would prove fundamental for subsequent literary and dramatic variations on the episode. The superimposition of the two couples did not escape Renaissance dramatists, who plundered the Aeneid episode in their Cleopatra plays. Before killing herself, the queen of Carthage utters a vengeful prophecy (iv.621-629); similarly, in Daniel’s Cleopatra, Caesario, close to the end, predicts Octavian’ death without male issue, so that Antony’s offspring will reign after him (iv.1.1002-1017)78. Dido’s very last words, her ‘novissima verba’ (Aen., iv.650-658), are echoed by Garnier (v.1954-1957). Her difficult death by sword (Aen., iv.672-696) was closer to Antony’s than to Cleopatra’s. Celso Pistorelli noticed this, and thus based his version of the scene on 75 76 77 78\n\nSee Benario. For suicide in Roman culture, see Hill 2004; Edwards. For the motif, also see Bono, pp. 85-86.

In the Aeneid, Anna runs to her wounded sister, tearing her garments and beating her breast, and demands to capture her last breath with a kiss, before embracing her and soaking up her blood with her dress. In Pistorelli’s play, Cleopatra’s reaction is the same, although it is Antony who asks for a last kiss (iv.217-218). Moreover Dido, in her dying agony, tries to open her eyes and her last movements are thrice repeated.79 Pistorelli’s Antony reacts in a similar fashion (iv.183-184): ‘Alhora ’l Re (come che risvegliato / Fosse da un grave sonno) aperse i lumi’ [‘Then the king, as if woken from a deep sleep, opened his eyes’] ‘E suspirò tre volte, e die’ fuor l’alma’ [‘And he sighted three times and surrendered his soul’] (iv.221).80 Later classical authors, Statius (iii.2.119-120),81 Pseudo-Rabirius (Carmen de Bello Actiaco, coll. iv-vi),82 Ponnanus (epigram 274) and even Martial (iv.11), drew from the same repertoire of Augustan poetry.83 Other poets mentioned Cleopatra while lamenting the evils of civil war, or when reviving the Horatian theme of literature’s immortalising power.84 Almost paradoxically, after Virgil’s, the most impressive portrait of Cleopatra in Latin literature is found in a poem generally defined as an antiAeneid: Lucan’s Bellum civile or Pharsalia.85 Lucan’s Cleopatra is portrayed in her youth, at the time of Julius Caesar, but his rancorous characterisation is influenced by later events. Having described her first appearance, the poet remarks, ‘Quis tibi vaesani veniam non donet amoris, / Antoni, durum cum Caesaris hauserit ignis / Pectus?’ [‘Who can refuse pardon to the infatuation of Antony, when even the stubborn heart of Caesar took fire?’] (x.70-73). In his lines, Cleopatra is, above all, an accomplished actress. She seduces Caesar, ‘simulatum […] 79 Aen., iv.688-691. 80 Celso Pistorelli, Marc’Antonio e Cleopatra. I am quoting from the copy now in Biblioteca dell’Accademia dei Filodrammatici, Milan (2402-E. II 34), keeping my interventions to a minimum. For the first part of the scene, see also Plutarch, Ant., 77.3. 81 In Statius’ evocation (Sylvae, iii.2.119-120), the Alexandrine palace is now infested by Cleopatra’s death-tools, ‘anguiferamque domum, blando qua mersa veneno / Actias Ausonias fugit Cleopatra catenas’ [‘and the snake-haunted hall where Cleopatra of Actium, sunk in gentle poison, fled Ausonian chains’] (see Statius, Sylvae, trans by Shackleton Bailey). 82 Despite its traditional title, the carmen did not describe the nauticum bellum, but its sequel, see The Fragmentary Latin Poets, pp. 334-339. See also C. Rabirius. Bellum Actiacum. 83 In Ponnanus’ epigram, the queen sensually offers her breasts to the snake. See Anthologia Latina, I, pp. 183-184. 84 Anthologia Latina, I, n. 462 and n. 417. For a detailed overview of the treatment of Cleopatra’s figure in Greek and Latin literature, see Becher. 85 Although Bellum Civile is the official title of the manuscripts, some editors prefer Pharsalia, pointing to a passage in the text (ix.985-986). For Lucan, see Bartsch; Holmes.\n\n‘No Humble Woman She’\n\n39\n\ndolorem’ [with ‘feigned grief’] (x.83), trusting in her beauty. Her sensuality and her excessive decus are cunningly used to arouse and dazzle: […] et inmodice formam fucata nocentem, Nec sceptris contenta suis nec fratre marito, Plena maris rubri spoliis, colloque comisque Divitias Cleopatra gerit cultuque laborat. Candida Sidonio perlucent pectora filo, Quod Nilotis acus conpressum pectine Serum Solvit et extenso laxavit stamina velo. (x.137-143) [Cleopatra, not content with a crown of her own and her brother for husband, was there, with her baleful beauty painted up beyond all measure: covered with the spoils of the Red Sea, she carried a fortune round her neck and in her hair, and was weighed down by her ornaments. Her white breasts were revealed by the fabric of Sidon, which, close-woven by the shuttle of the Seres, the Egyptian needle-worker pulls out, and loosens the thread by stretching the stuff.]86\n\nThe Italian dramatist De Cesari would probably be reminded of this charm, when describing the deceased Cleopatra in the nude (see below 4.1).87 Lucan’s Cleopatra is the woman who turned the corruption of Egypt into a powerful weapon and imposed her degenerate life model on the Empire. His slanderous portrait is affirmed by the poet through Plotinus’ sententiae (x.357-370), where the association of Cleopatra-meretrix once again dominates: ‘Aegypton habet Romamque meretur’ [‘she possesses Egypt and is playing the harlot for Rome’] (x.359); ‘Quem non e nobis credit Cleopatra nocentem, / A quo casta fuit?’ [‘Cleopatra considers every man of us guilty, if he has not defiled her’] (x.369-370).88 Lucan was Seneca’s nephew and as is well known, following the unsuccessful plot to assassinate Nero, had his veins opened by a surgeon and ended his life ‘the Roman way’. Soon after, Seneca followed his example.89 Both Nero and his victims were Antony’s descendants. Seneca, in his writings, sometimes refers to his famous ancestor, stating that he was a great Roman, 86 The English version is that of Duff. 87 For the seductive post mortem appeal, see Shakespeare, Ant., v.2.340-342. 88 For a brilliant commentary on the entire book, see Bellum Civile Liber X, ed. by Berti. 89 Dio, lxii.24-25; Tacitus, xv.60-64.\n\n40\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\nwho was transformed into a cruel and blood-thirsty man by his love for wine and – no less potent than wine – by his ‘Cleopatrae amor’.90 He never wrote a tragedy with a Roman setting, as Octavia is a spurious attribution.

All the English quotations from the book are taken from Virginia Brown’s version. 2 This is true for most historians of late Antiquity, from Eutropius (Breviarium ab urbe condita, vii.1-7) to Zonaras (Epitome Historiarum, x.29-31). Writers in late Antiquity other than historians also kept to old models. See, for example, Prudentius, Contra Symmachum, 524-534; Corippus, In laudem Iustini, iii.13-18. I make no claim to touch upon, even in passing, the complex question of the relationship between Christianity and the Roman Empire. For an introductory survey and bibliography on the issue, see Mitchell and Young. 3 De viris illustribus urbis Romae (DVI) is part of the so-called historia tripertita, together with the Origo gentis Romanae and the Liber de Caesaribus (or Historiae abbreviatae). This corpus is made up of three works by three different authors, which were probably brought together between AD 360 and 395. See Momigliano; Braccesi.

In De viris illustribus, Cleopatra turns into the dark heroine of an Oriental tale, ‘Haec tantae libidinis fuit, ut saepe prostiterit, tantae pulchritudinis, ut multi noctem illius morte emerint’ [‘She was so lustful that she would often sell herself, so beautiful that many men bought a night with her at the cost of their own death’] (86.2). 4 Not many years later, Latinius Pacatus Drepanius, in his panegyric to the Emperor Theodosius (AD 389), retold the epic confrontation between East and West, now more than ever conceived of as a struggle between moral corruption and liberty and duty. He believed it all to be true, but his account nevertheless has the flavour a literary tale (xxxiii.1-2). The great and famous Alexandrine war, distorted by exaggerations and mystifications, was inevitably bound to appear increasingly unreal, in later centuries.5 Strange as it seems, while her life was still condemned by historians, Cleopatra’s voluntary death was praised by at least one Christian Latin writer. In his treatise Ad nationes, Tertullian associated her with the cult of martyrs (1.18.3).6 In Ad martyras, he cited her among classical models of heroism as she faced her own death: ‘Bestias femina libens appetiit, et utique aspides, serpentes tauro vel urso horridiores, quos Cleopatra immisit sibi, ne in manus inimici perveniret’ [‘A woman has even voluntarily desired the wild beasts and even asps – reptiles surely more dreadful than bull or bear – which Cleopatra applied to herself lest she should fall into the hands of her enemy’] (iv.6).7 Subsequent fathers of the Church would point to a basic flaw in Tertullian’s argument, namely the lack of an ethical distinction between martyrdom and suicide. St. Augustine, in De civitate Dei, would be the first to reject the mors voluntaria ethic of the ancient world, stating that whoever killed a man, even himself, was guilty of murder (i.21.7-10), and thus establishing but is still incertis auctoris. Humanists (Petrarch, Boccaccio and Coluccio Salutati, among others) attributed it to Pliny the Younger (D’Elia, p. 48). 4 Quotations are taken from Sexti Aurelii Victoris, Liber de Caesaribus. The vita Cleopatrae is the last of the nine lives not included in the independent tradition of DVI and appears to be unusual in being both a woman’s life and a foreign leader’s biography. For the revival of the motif in later literature, see Pucci, p. 201. 5 For Pacatus, see Dattrino. 6 For Tertullian, see Burrows; Osborn. The chronology of Tertulian’s treatises is disputed. Ad Nationes is generally assigned to AD 197, while Ad Martiras to 197 or 202-203. 7 The English translation is that of Address to Martyrs, in Bindley, The Epistle of the Gallican Churches, pp. 51-61. On this point, see also Gurval 2011, p. 73.\n\n‘ The Subjec t of Talk the World Over’\n\n43\n\nwhat would become orthodox Christian thought on the issue.8 Although Tertullian’s choice of classical examples was later discredited, it accurately represents how hard it was, for Christian philosophy, to free itself from the stoic concept of fortitudo.9 Tertullian was Carthaginian, while St. Augustine was born in AD 354 at Thagaste (the Roman province of Numidia) and spent his life in Roman ‘Africa’. A third ‘African’ Christian writer, John, Bishop of Nikiu (seventh century AD), has left us with an astoundingly positive portrait of Cleopatra.10 In Chapter 67 of his Chronicle, he asserts that ‘she was great in herself and in her achievements (in) courage and strength’ (2). She built the palace of Alexandria ‘and all that saw it admired it, for there was not the like in all the world’ (3). Moreover, ‘before she died, she executed many noble works and (created) important institutions’ (9). What is amazing in his picture is not what John tells us, but what he does not tell us. In Chapter 64, he states that Julius Caesar ‘fell in love with her and married her and begot a son by her’ (7). Not a word is said of Mark Antony and his children. As the text has suffered in the course of transmission, it could be that a portion of it has been lost, but the tone of the Chronicle suggests that this is not the case. Relating the queen’s death, John simply notes, ‘And this woman […] died in the fourteenth year of the reign of Caesar Augustus. Thereupon the inhabitants of Alexandria and of (lower) and upper Egypt submitted to the emperors of Rome, who set over them prefects and generals’ (67.9-10). Another positive portrait of the queen is included by the Arab historian Al-Mas’udi (Abu al-Husayn ‘Ali Ibn al Husayn), in his world history The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems (Muruj adh-dhahab wa ma’adin al-jawhar [tenth century]).11 His Cleopatra is above all a philosopher and a scientist, the last Greek sage: ‘She wrote about medicine, magic, and other aspects of the natural sciences, and those works, which bear her name as the author, are well known to the experts in the art of medicine.’12 Together with her husband Antony, she ruled over Macedonia, an Egyptian region. They 8 For similar observations from a different perspective, see Hughes-Hallett, pp. 150-154. 9 De civ. Dei, xv.4. 10 John was Coptic bishop of Nikiu and ‘rector’ of the bishops in Upper Egypt. Appointed general administrator of the Monasterie in AD 696, he then lost his post. Long sections of his Chronicle have been lost. The original Greek version (possibly with Coptic sections) has not come down to us, nor has the Arabic version. All we have is an Ethiopic translation from Arabic (1602).

He killed Antony and the queen, in order to preserve her knowledge, decided to deceive him. She asked for a particular snake, called a fitriyah, the venom of which killed instantly, and closed herself in a marble room in her palace, where all the most aromatic plants, flowers and fruits of Egypt had been collected. One of her maids voluntarily put her hand into the glass vase holding the serpent and died. Then Cleopatra seated on her throne with her crown on her head, put her hand in the vase and was poisoned, too. The snake slithered from the vase and hid among the leaves, unable to find a way out of the room. When Augustus arrived, at first he thought the queen was alive: he soon realised she was not, but was mystified as to the cause of her death. Attracted by the sweet-smelling plants, he approached them, and was bitten by the snake. As it had already struck twice, its remaining venom was insufficient to kill him immediately. However, the right side of his body was paralysed at once and at this point he understood what had happened to the queen, and realised that he had walked into a trap. He survived a day longer, and composed some famous poetry, which the Romans then used in their funeral rites. Both John of Nikiu’s and Al-Mas’udi’s Cleopatras look, to our eyes, fascinating, exotic and remote. Nonetheless, it is another image of the queen, dating from this same period, which haunts the imagination of the reader. We find it in the pages of an obscure historical compendium, De aetatibus mundi et hominis, by Fabius Placidus Fulgentius, once identified with St. Fulgentius of Ruspe:13 ‘[Caesar] Actiacae pugnae certamine triumphans exstitit atque Aegyptiacam superatam reginam lactandas praebere mammas serpentibus persuasit’ [‘He showed himself triumphant in the struggle of the Battle of Actium and forced the Egyptian queen whom he conquered to submit her breasts to be suckled by the snakes’] (Liber xiv H 176).14 The version of Cleopatra’s death in which she applies the asp(s) to her breasts will recur through the years, in illustrations, pictures, and literary works.15 Yet the implicit, almost blasphemous simile between baby and snake is something totally different. ‘Lactandas’ unites queen and asps in a sort of maternal relationship, stirring 13 Fulgentius lived around the late fifth to early sixth century. See Hays; Wetherbee. 14 Fulgenzio, Le età del mondo e dell’uomo. The English translation is that of Gurval 2011, p. 73. 15 See below 2.2, 3.2. Watson (1978, p. 411) states that Paulus of Aegina is the only one ‘among extant ancient writers’ to tell the story of Cleopatra clasping a snake to her breast. According to the pseudo-Galen (De Theriaca ad Pisonem, viii), an asp bite to the breast was a common form of public execution in Alexandria, but he does not mention the site of the wound, when describing Cleopatra’s death (pp. 412-413).\n\n‘ The Subjec t of Talk the World Over’\n\n45\n\nup a latent, complex symbology, based on the biblical tale of Original Sin.16 It is precisely this picture, further complicated by other motifs, that we will meet again in the last act of Shakespeare’s play.\n\n2.2\n\n‘So lascivious, Cleopatra’17\n\nWhere Antiquity and late Antiquity had focused on Cleopatra’s life and death, the Middle Ages generally centred their interest on her afterlife. Her deeds were judged in the light of eternity and she was evaluated for her moral choices. In the medieval cultural code, the order of the material world corresponded to that of the divine world.18 In this context, the suprahuman dimension of the lovers of Alexandria (i.e. Cleopatra as Venus and Antony as Mars) disappeared, because classical figures, whether mythological and real, were used side by side as exempla. The second great innovation of the period was the myth of Cleopatra as a faithful lover. Some medieval poets started to write that she had died for love. On the one hand, the queen was, more than ever, a seductress; on the other, she became a paradigm of female steadfastness. The general attitude towards her remained hostile, as the prevailing scholastic models of gender, derived from Aristotle, claimed female inferiority and did not look sympathetically on her behaviour.19 Nonetheless, a positive version of her myth began to creep discreetly into Europe. In some cases Cleopatra simply loses her pejorative connotations – as in Santillana’s ‘Triunphete de amor’ (141) – while in others she is even given a positive depiction – as in Jehan Le Févre’s Livre de Leesce (‘Et Cleopatre, qui fu bonne’ [‘And Cleopatre who was good’]).20 National differences cannot be discounted: ‘The Italian writer stresses Cleopatra’s fame as a result of her part in Roman History; for the English she is a lover and they stress her personal qualities’ (Williamson 1974, p. 54). For the first time, then, the queen was freed from the unchanging 16 Notes to Le età del mondo, p. 237 n. to 437. 17 ‘Cleopatràs lussuriosa’, Dante, Inf., v.63. 18 I am of course oversimplifying. See Segre, pp. 132-138; Lotman 1973; Auerbach 2003, pp. 116-122, 194-198; Auerbach 1984, pp. 11-76 (53-73). See also Williamson 1974, pp. 46-47. 19 Aristotle, The Politics, i, ch. 12. On the issue, see Erler and Kowalesky; Elliott. 20 Jehan Le Févre, Livre de Leesce, 382. The Livre was probably composed at the end of 1373, as an answer to the misogynist Lamentations de Matheolus. Cleopatra is notably absent from Christine de Pizan’s philogynist Cité des Dames (1404-1405) and she is criticised both in John of Salisbury’s Policraticus (around 1159) and in the anonymous Roman de Renart le Conterfait (rédaction A 1319-1322; rédaction B 1328-1342). Also Martin le Franc’s Le Champion des Dames (1440-1442) gives a negative image of her. For Cleopatra in Jean de Thuin’s work, see below 3.3.\n\n46\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\ndomain of ancient Greek and Latin to have her story retold in a multitude of ever-changing vernaculars. Let us start our survey with the model for so many poets across Europe: Dante’s Commedia. We meet Cleopatra first in the Inferno, swirling in the moaning ‘bufera infernal’ [‘wind of Hell’] which scourges the lustful, in the second circle of Hell.21 She is the third bird-like spirit, after Semiramis and Dido, but while both the other two queens are described by a periphrasis and a brief synthesis of their sins, she is simply indicated by name and qualifier, ‘poi è Cleopatràs lussuriosa’ [‘And next, so lascivious, Cleopatra’] (v.63). There is no need to retell the story: the essence of her life is summarised in one word. Similarly, in her second Dantean appearance (Par., vi.76-78) the queen – hunted by the Roman eagle – is def ined through one adjective, ‘trista’, which, as many critics have observed, could mean ‘unhappy, wretched’ but also ‘wicked’ or ‘reckless’. Cleopatra’s capital vice is lust: we do not find her twisted into a hawthorn, in the suicides’ wood (Inf., xiii), but blown by the wind of carnal sinners.22 In her whirling flight, the queen is alone, notably not eternally embracing Antony. Unlike Francesca, she has not yet become an extreme heroine of the love-death pairing; her passion had no f ixed object and her sexual license does not leave any space for emotional complicity or anguished sympathy.23 Nevertheless, the story of Paolo and Francesca da Rimini which dominates Inferno v – soon transformed into icons of obsessive love, doomed from the very start – will cast its shadow over the Alexandrian couple in the Renaissance. Through Dante’s influence, in the late Italian Middle Ages – and not only then – lasciviousness became Cleopatra’s distinctive sign. This connotation is implicit in Fazio degli Uberti’s Dittamondo (i.1.73-75, see also 112-115) and, turning to the fifteenth century, in Juan de Andújar’s Italianate poem ‘La Visión de amor’, within the miscellany known as Cancionero de Stuñiga (140-141).24 Petrarch’s personage has the same marque d’infamie. Cleopatra ‘arsa / d’indegno foco’ [‘aflame / With wrongful love’] is only a fleeting apparition, within the allegorical processions of the Triumphi (Triumphus Fame 2 21 English translations are Kirkpatrick’s. 22 It has often been noted that no pagan who have committed suicide is found in the wood of Inferno, xiii, as killing oneself was a lesser sin for Gentiles than for Christians. See the commentary on Purgatorio, canto 1, by Kirkpatrick, pp. 322-327. On the subject, see also Limentani. 23 See Kirkpatrick 1987, pp. 6-9, 76-94; Contini 1970; Bono, pp. 55-56. 24 See Nicasio.\n\n‘ The Subjec t of Talk the World Over’\n\n47\n\n106-107).25 This pale, marginal figure did not influence later dramatists.26 Yet the Triumphi and the Rerum vulgarium fragmenta heavily conditioned the lyric register of many European Renaissance Cleopatra plays in the wake of the success of Petrarchism, and details of Laura’s selective description were shamelessly employed to highlight the beauty of the sovereign. When Pistorelli wrote of her blonde hair, her ‘biondi crini’ (iv.432), Cleopatra had already been endowed with Laura’s famous golden hair (e.g. RVF, 90.1, 196.7-8, 227.1-4) for instance, by Giovanni Gherardi da Prato, in his Il paradiso degli Alberti: ‘Da poi ancora la detta legiadrissima e mirabile Cleopatra […] co˙lle sue biondissime trecce legate da uno filo finissimo d’oro’ [‘And then the very beautiful and admirable Cleopatra […] with her pale blonde plaits tied with a thread of the finest gold’] (i.100).27 Writers were depicting in line with their ideals of beauty, abolishing her uncomfortable ‘foreignness’.28 In effect, Cleopatra’s ‘cheveleüre ot sore et espesse et longue’ also appeared in the medieval romance Li fait des Romans (part 3, ch.15 [17] ll. 30-33), based on a different tradition.29 Nonetheless, Petrarch’s direct influence cannot be denied, as is shown by Garnier’s Petrarchan – or better, Petrarchesque – description of the blond queen in his play (Marc Antoine, ii.711-718). In Garnier’s lines, we find many of the stereotypes so aptly reversed in Shakespeare’s anti-Petrarchan sonnet 130: ‘Et le vermeil coral qui ses deux lévres peint’ (l. 714) [‘The coral color her two lips ingrains’ (l. 722)]; ‘La clairté de ses yeux, deux soleils de ce monde’ (l. 715) [‘Her beamy eyes, two suns of 25 The translation is that by Wilkins. Cleopatra had already been cited in Triumphus Cupidinis (TC1 88-90) with Julius Caesar, see also De Remediis utriusque fortune, i.69; De vita solitaria, 2.9; Fam., 18.7.3. In Africa, II, 242-243, we find a Virgilian depiction of the queen’s role at Actium. 26 Regarding the fortune of the Triumphs in England, see Hannay, Kinnamon and Brennan 2005d. In TF2 she is once again associated to Semiramis and to the chaste Zenobia. For her and Cleopatra, see Petrarch, Fam. 21.8.14. Zenobia will become an exemplary ‘good woman’ in many humanist treatises on the nature of the female sex, and features as one of the speakers in Thomas Elyot’s Defence of Good Women. See Jordan; Beilin 1987, pp. 9-11. 27 In this uncompleted collection of short stories, the medievalised queen is highly praised for her political and personal qualities, see 1.103. 28 Historically, Cleopatra belonged to the Ptolemaic dynasty, of Macedonian origin: ‘By descent half Macedonian and (apparently) half Greek, with a slight tinge of the Iranian, she was by instinct, training, and pride of race a Macedonian princess; Romans called her an Egyptian simply as a term of abuse, like Dago, for she had no Egyptian blood’ (Tarn and Charlesworth 1934a, p. 35). In his description of her court, Lucan indicates the presence of many different races (Pharsalia, x.127-131). 29 Although, in ancient French the term sor (feminine: sore) or sorel came to cover a wide range of colour shades, its first meaning was ‘brilliant blond or golden yellow’, to the point that in a passage from Guernes de Pont-Sainte-Maxence’s Vie de Saint Thomas Becket (1174), Sorel is the name of a personification of ‘gold’. See Ott, pp. 82, 86; Van Daele. For Li fait, see below 3.3.\n\n48\n\nCleopatr a in Italian and English Renaissance Dr ama\n\nthis our world’ (l. 723)].30 Conversely, Cleopatra was seen as a dark lady by most English Renaissance writers, who were not influenced by the memory of Laura or rather as a dark-skinned woman whose ‘sanne-burnt beautie’ could not possibly please Antony’s ‘sight’, as Samuel Brandon puts it in his Virtuous Octavia (iii.2.29).31 Shakespeare’s Cleopatra is seen by Philo (i.1.6) and by Antony, in his rage (iv.12.28), as a gypsy with a ‘tawny front’ (i.1.9), and describes herself as ‘with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black’ (i.5.29),32 similar to the justification used by the woman in the Song of Solomon (1.6). It is only with the third, so-called, ‘Florentine crown’ that Cleopatra’s character comes alive. Boccaccio developed Cleopatra’s Latin portraits in the 1350s. His portrayals of her in the vernacular, on the contrary, date from the beginning and the very end of his literary career. In the third book of his early romance Filocolo (1336-1339), the allusions to Cleopatra are mainly focused on her debauchery (iii.35.7, iv.42.9), while at v.53.17 he laconically states that her reign was ended ‘per la forza de’ Romani, che ’l soggiogarono’ [‘through the power of the Romans, who conquered it’].33 In the Amorosa Visione (1342-1343, revised in 1355-1360) she proceeds, as one of Fame’s retinue, da capo, to the pressing – and here somewhat clumsy – rhythm of tercets: A loro Marco Antonio quiviritto seguiva e Cleopatra ancor con esso, che, in Sicilia, fuggì sanza rispitto, ridottando Ottavian, perché commesso le parea forse aver sì fatta offesa che non sperava mai perdon da esso. Ivi non potendo ella far difesa al fuoco che le ardeva forse ’l core 30 Two Tragedies, Hippolyte and Marc Antoine, ed. by Hill and Morrison. The English version is that found in Sidney Herbert, Selected Works. Her translation is line for line with a single exception, but ‘the lineation […] is obscured in Works because the text of act and scene divisions is included in the line count’, see Alexander 2006, p. 96 n. 51; Alexander 1999. I do not share Aebischer’s view that Garnier’s Cleopatra is ‘artificially white’ (p. 233). 31 See also Robert Greene’s romance Ciceronis Amor (first published in 1589). Of course there were exceptions, the most relevant of which is Chaucer’s Legend of Good Women (see below 2.3). In the anonymous Caesar’s Revenge (mid-1590s), Cleopatra has ‘Cheekes of Roses, lockes of Gold’ (ii.3.887-888). See Ayres; Waddington, pp. 217, 226 n. 39. For Brandon, see below 5.4. Daniel never describes the queen in any physical detail. 32 On the whole issue in Shakespeare’s play, see Adelman 1973, pp. 184-188; on Cleopatra’s racial indeterminacy, see Aebischer. 33 For the English translation, see Filocolo, trans. by Donald Cheney.\n\n‘ The Subjec t of Talk the World Over’\n\n49\n\ndi libidine e d’ira, ond’era accesa, a fuggir quello oltraggioso furore con due serpenti in mesta sepultura sofferse sostener mortal dolore; ed ancor quivi nella sua figura pallida, si vedeano i duo serpenti alle sue zizze dar crudel morsura. (x.55-69) [Behind them Mark Antony directly / followed, and Cleopatra still with him, / who fled towards Sicily without delay, / fearing Octavian, because it seemed to her / that she had committed so grave an offense / that she could never hope for his pardon. / Then, incapable of defending herself / against the flame that perhaps burned her heart / with the lust and wrath with which she was kindled, / in order to escape that excessive furor / with two serpents in a sad tomb / did she let herself undergo mortal agony; / and still there on her pale shape / the two serpents could be seen, / cruelly biting her breasts.]34\n\nIn Boccaccio’s picture, Antony is irrelevant, reduced to Cleopatra’s unmanned lover; she herself is deprived of every regal attribute. She dies in the mausoleum, poisoned by two asps (as in Florus’ Epitomae), that she applies to her ‘zizze’.35 The image of a woman with serpents at her breasts was a widespread symbol of lust in the Middle Ages, while the fact that in this version Cleopatra flees to Sicily may be part of a now-lost medieval version of her myth.36 In the Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta (1343 or 1344) Cleopatra’s name is associated for the first time with a motif which, grafted on to classical roots, will be of great importance in Renaissance drama: the instability of Fortune. She is once again full of ‘libidinose lusinghe’ [‘lascivious enticements’] (viii, 151), and quickly dies as ‘in piccola ora possono per le poppe due serpenti trarre d’un corpo il sangue e la vita’ [‘two snakes can quickly suck from 34 For the text and the English translation, see the edition of Boccaccio, Amorosa visione, edited by Branca, and the bilingual edition translated by Hollander, Hampton and Frankel.
