At the time of their marriage in 1868, Ferdinando was no longer the reigning Grand Duke of Tuscany because of the unification of the former Italian monarchies into the Kingdom of Italy. However, Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria and Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorriane, of which Ferdinando was a member, allowed Ferdinando to keep the grand ducal title as a courtesy. Ferdinando’s descendants could only use the title of Archduke or Archduchess of Austria.\n\nAlicia Maria Carolina Ferdinanda Rachael Giovanna Filomena was born in Parma, Duchy of Parma, now in Italy, on December 27, 1849. She was the third of the four children and the second of the two daughters of Carlo III, Duke of Parma and Princess Louise Marie Thérèse of France, who was a granddaughter of King Charles X of France. Alicia’s paternal grandparents were Carlo II, Duke of Parma and Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. Her maternal grandparents were Prince Charles Ferdinand of France, Duke of Berry and Princess Carolina of Naples and Sicily.\n\nAlicia had three siblings:\n\nPrincess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma (1847 – 1893), married Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, had five children\n\nRoberto I, Duke of Parma (1848 – 1907), married (1) Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, had twelve children including Princess Maria Luisa who married Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (2) Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, had twelve children including Princess Zita who married, Karl I, the last Emperor of Austria and Prince Felix who married Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg\n\nPrince Enrico, Count of Bardi (1851 – 1905), married (1) Princess Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, died three months after marriage (2) Infanta Adelgundes of Portugal, Duchess of Guimarães, no children\n\nThe authoritarian policies of Alicia’s father Carlo III, Duke of Parma made him unpopular. He placed Parma under martial law, inflicted heavy penalties on the members of the former provisional government, closed the university, and instituted persecution policies. His authoritarian policies made him unpopular, and after reigning only five years, he was assassinated on March 27, 1854. Alicia’s six-year-old brother Roberto became Duke of Parma with his mother as regent. In 1859, the Duchy of Parma was abolished during the Italian unification movement. It was merged with the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of the unification of Italy. In 1861, Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia was proclaimed the first King of the new, united Kingdom of Italy.\n\nLouise Marie Thérèse and her four children made their way to Venice where they lived temporarily under Austrian protection. The Bourbon-Parma family had considerable wealth and later lived in exile at Schwarzau Castle (now a prison, link in German) at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna, Austria, the Villa Pianore (link in Italian) in northwest Italy, and the magnificent Château de Chambord in France.\n\nIn January 1864, 15-year-old Alicia became engaged to 23-year-old Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein. Johann, who never married and reigned for seventy years, broke the engagement in December 1864. He argued that because Liechtenstein was part of the German Confederation, a marriage to Alicia, who was descended from the French royal family on her mother’s side, could cause problems. However, according to some contemporary sources, Johann had broken the engagement because he was allegedly homosexual.\n\nOn January 11, 1868, at Schloss Frohsdorf (link in German) in Lanzenkirchen, Austria, a property owned by the family of Alicia’s mother Louise Marie Thérèse of France, Alicia married the former Ferdinando IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Ferdinando lost his throne due to the Italian unification and was in exile like Alicia’s family. This was a second marriage for Ferdinando. He previously had been married to Princess Anna of Saxony, daughter of Johann, King of Saxony and Amalie Auguste of Bavaria. Anna gave birth to a daughter in 1858. On February 6, 1859, Anna miscarried a daughter due to typhoid fever. Four days later Anna died at the age of twenty-three.\n\nAlicia had a stepdaughter from Ferdinando’s first marriage:\n\nArchduchess Maria Antonietta of Austria (1858 – 1883), unmarried\n\nAlicia and Ferdinando had ten children:\n\nArchduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria (1868 – 1935), renounced his titles in 1902 and took the name Leopold Wölfling, married (1) Wilhelmine Adamovicz, no children, divorced (2) Maria Magdalena Ritter, no children, divorced (3) Klara Hedwig Pawlowski, no children\n\nArchduchess Louise of Austria (1870 – 1947), married (1) Crown Prince Friedrich August of Saxony (the future King Friedrich August III), had six children, divorced due to a scandal (2) Enrico Toselli, had one son, divorced\n\nArchduke Giuseppe Ferdinando of Austria (1872 – 1942), married (1) Rosa Kaltenbrunner, no children, divorced (2) Gertrud Tomanek, had two children\n\nArchduke Peter Ferdinand of Austria (1874 – 1948), married Princess Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, had four children\n\nArchduke Heinrich Ferdinand of Austria (1878 – 1969), married Maria Karoline Ludescher, had three children\n\nArchduchess Anna of Austria (1879 – 1961), married Johannes, Prince of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, had six children\n\nArchduchess Margareta of Austria (1881 – 1965), unmarried\n\nArchduchess Germana of Austria (1884 – 1955), unmarried\n\nArchduke Robert Ferdinand Salvator (1885 – 1895), died in childhood\n\nArchduchess Agnes of Austria (1891 – 1945), unmarried\n\nFerdinando and Alicia lived at the Villa Tuscany in Lindau, Austria during the summer, and during the winter they lived in a wing of the Salzburg Residenz, formerly the residence of the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg. Both residences were provided by Ferdinando’s second cousin Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria.

Ferdinando was unable to return to Florence to claim his throne, and an elected Tuscan National Assembly formally deposed him on August 16, 1859. Ferdinando hoped to recover his throne because France and Austria had promised to recognize his rights. However, neither France nor Austria was willing to take any steps to bring about his restoration. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860, as a part of the unification of Italy.

Only family members born before 1866 could use the title Prince or Princess of Tuscany. In 1870, Ferdinando relinquished all dynastic rights to the former Grand Duchy of Tuscany for himself and his future heirs in favor of his second cousin Emperor Franz Joseph I and his future heirs.

However, the republican government was short-lived due to a counter-revolution by Austrian troops and Leopoldo was able to return to Florence.\n\nIn 1859, the Grand Ducal family was forced to flee Florence permanently because of the wars caused by the Italian unification movement, and the family took refuge in Austria.

In 1861, Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia was proclaimed the first King of the new, united Kingdom of Italy.\n\nTwo Grand Dukes of Tuscany were also Holy Roman Emperors: Francesco II Stefano, Grand Duke of Tuscany (reigned 1737 – 1765) also Franz I, Holy Roman Emperor (reigned 1745 – 1765) and Pietro Leopoldo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (reigned 1765 – 1790) also Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor (reigned 1790 – 1792).\n\nUnofficial Royalty: What was the Holy Roman Empire?\n\n********************\n\nMaria Anna of Saxony was the first wife of Leopoldo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Maria Anna Carolina Josepha Vincentia Xaveria Nepomucena Franziska de Paula Franziska de Chantal Johanna Antonia Elisabeth Cunigunde Gertrud Leopoldina was born on November 15, 1799, at the Royal Palace of Dresden in the Electorate of Saxony, now in the German state of Saxony. She was the fifth of the seventh children and the third of the four daughters of Maximilian, Hereditary Prince of Saxony and his first wife Princess Carolina of Parma. Maria Anna’s paternal grandparents were Friedrich Christian, Elector of Saxony, and Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria. Her maternal grandparents were Ferdinando, Duke of Parma and Maria Amalia of Austria.\n\nMaria Anna had six siblings:\n\nPrincess Amalie of Saxony (1794 – 1870), unmarried\n\nMaria Ferdinanda of Saxony (1796 – 1865), married Ferdinando III, Grand Duke of Tuscany (second wife), no children\n\nFriedrich August II, King of Saxony (1797 – 1854), married (1) Archduchess Maria Caroline of Austria, no children (2) Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria, no children\n\nPrince Clemens of Saxony (1798 – 1822), unmarried\n\nJohann I, King of Saxony (1801 – 1873), married Princess Amalia of Bavaria, had nine children\n\nPrincess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1803 – 1829), married Ferdinand VII, King of Spain (third wife), no children\n\nIn 1817, Maria Anna became betrothed to the future Leopoldo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The couple had a proxy marriage on October 28, 1817, in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, now in the German state of Saxony. However, Maria Anna was so terrified of meeting her bridegroom that she refused to leave Saxony unless her sister Maria Ferdinanda accompanied her. Accompanied by her sister Maria Ferdinanda, Maria Anna finally met Leopoldo and they were married in person on November 16, 1817, at the Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy.\n\nFour years later, when his son Leopoldo and his daughter-in-law Maria Anna had not produced any children, Ferdinando III, Grand Duke of Tuscany decided to marry twenty years after the death of his first wife Luisa of Naples and Sicily. During his son’s wedding celebrations, Maria Ferdinanda of Saxony, the sister of the bride, had caught the eye of Ferdinand III, who was twenty-seven years older than Maria Ferdinanda. He remembered Maria Ferdinanda and chose her as his second wife. They were married on May 6, 1821, in Florence. Ferdinando III hoped to have more children but his marriage to Maria Ferdinadna remained childless.\n\nThree years after his second wedding, Ferdinando I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, aged 55, died on June 18, 1824, in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy. Maria Anna’s husband succeeded to the throne as Leopoldo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Maria Anna replaced her sister Maria Ferdinanda as the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. Maria Anna and her husband, were the founding patrons of L’Istituto Statale della Ss. Annunziata, the first female boarding school in Florence to educate aristocratic and noble young ladies. The school is still in existence.\n\nMaria Anna and Leopoldo eventually had children – three daughters who could not succeed to the throne. If Leopoldo did not have a male heir, the throne of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany would revert to Leopoldo’s Austrian Habsburg relatives.\n\nArchduchess Carolina Auguste of Austria (1822 – 1841), died in her teens\n\nArchduchess Auguste Ferdinande of Austria (1825 – 1864), married Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria\n\nArchduchess Maria Maximiliana of Austria (1827 – 1834), died in childhood\n\nMaria Anna’s inability to produce a male heir caused depression and coupled with her chronic ill health, made her developing tuberculosis more severe. The doctors advised Maria Anna to move to Pisa because of its milder and healthier climate. The entire court moved to Pisa in the winter of 1832 but Maria Anna showed no improvement. Her condition worsened in March 1832 and it became clear that she would soon die. Maria Anna serenely awaited her death with her confessor at her bedside but she regretted abandoning her husband and children. On March 24, 1832, 32-year-old Maria Anna died at the Royal Palace (link in Italian) in Pisa, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy. She was interred at the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence in a beautiful red porphyry sarcophagus surmounted by a crown.\n\nMaria Anna’s husband Leopoldo greatly grieved his beloved wife but because he had three daughters and needed a male heir to ensure the succession he married again the following year to his first cousin Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies. Leopoldo and Maria Antonia had ten children including Leopoldo’s heir and the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand IV.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
