Unless otherwise cited, quotations of VLB are from The Memoirs of Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun, translated by Siân Evans, Camden Press, 1989 (following Charpentier’s 1869 edition, Paris).\n\nBaillio (1982) refers to the exhibition catalog, Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, 1755-1842, by Joseph Baillio, Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas, 1982. Baillio (2015) refers to the catalog for the exhibition held at the Louvre, while Baillio (2016) refers to the catalog for the exhibitions held at the the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and Ottawa's National Gallery of Canada. Mr. Baillio is the world’s leading authority on Vigée Le Brun, and is preparing a catalogue raisonné. Biographical information on many of the sitterqs was also provided by Dr. François Velde (Heraldica Web Site), and Olivier Blanc (an author and specialist in French late 18th century and First Empire history, and author of numerous books, including, “Portraits de femmes, artistes et modèles à l'époque de Marie-Antoinette,” Paris, Didier Carpentier, 2006).\n\nThe hyperlinks generally connect to the group-effort website, \"The Art of Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun,\" which is administered by Kevin Kelly.

Sold by Christie's New York, 27 January 2000, Lot 68 for $134,500.] Baillio (2016) considers the skill displayed by the painting to be such that it must have been painted years later, 1774-78.\n\n{\"1 Mme Raffeneau.\"} Mme Raffeneau de Lille, wife of a big Parisian notaire, or else Françoise Sophie, born 1727, the wife of a Director des Aides régies par la ferme générale, femme de chambre de Mesdames Sophie et Louise de France.

Olivier Blanc makes a good argument that the painting was done ca. 1768-69, and believes these to be the children of the baronne d’Estat, by the prosecutor Omer Louis François Joly De Fleury: Michel-Angélique d’Estat dit Bellecour, Baron d’Estat, born about 1762, and his sister Denise d’Estat born in 1764, future baronne Gothereau De Billens. Both died at the guillotine in 1794. Or the girl may have been another sister, Agathe Louise Marie de La Ferté, born circa January 1767, who apparently died as a child (she was also a daughter of Joly De Fleury, but was given a different last name on her baptismal records, to conceal her illegitimate birth). Agathe appears on VLB’s list for 1779.\n\n{\"1 Mme d’Aguesseau with her dog.\"} Gabrielle-Anne (elsewhere Pavant) de La Vieuville (1735-?), daughter of René-Jean-Baptiste, marquis de La Vieuville and Anne-Charlotte de Creil. In 1760 she became the third wife of Jean-Baptiste-Paulin d’Aguesseau de Fresnes, comte de Campans (1702-84). [Identified by François Velde, with additional information from Olivier Blanc.] VLB also painted her sister, Anne Geneviève, listed two paragraphs below.\n\n1772? {\"1 Mme Suzanne.\"} {\"I met a friend of my mother’s, a Mme Suzanne...\" - Letter III} Olivier Blanc suggests this might have been the mother of François-Marie Suzanne, a sculptor born in 1750.\n\n{\"1 Mme La Comtesse de la Vieuville.\"} Anne Geneviève de La Vieuville, second daughter of René-Jean-Baptiste de La Vieuville, baron d’Arzillières. She married her uncle, the count de La Vieuville. [Identified by Olivier Blanc.] VLB also painted her sister, Gabrielle-Anne, listed two paragraphs above.\n\n{\"1 M.

Beaumarchais; ou, La calomnie, by Frédéric Grendel (Paris, Flammarion [1973]); Baillio (2015), p. 116 (color). {\"2 Vicomte and Vicomtesse de la Blache.\"} Jean Falcoz de La Blache (28 December 1743-1821), called the marquis d'Haraucourt, was the son of comte André Laurent Francois Falcoz de La Blache and Michèle Josèphe Marguerite de Roissy. On 3 March 1772, he married Catherine Le Roy de Senneville. The sitter's older brother, Alexandre Joseph Falcoz de La Blache (1739-1799), was known as the Comte de La Blache.\n\n1774 \"Vicomtesse de La Blache,\" oil on canvas, oval, 30 3/4\" x 24 3/8\" (78 x 62 cm), private collection.

Starye Gody, v. 3, plate following p. 120, 1910. {\"Several important figures from Russia came to see me; among others the notorious Count Orloff, one of the assassins of Peter III. He was an enormous man and I remember he wore a huge diamond on one finger.\" - Letter II.} [Per Nikolenko, in addition to this bust, there is a full-length version. Jana Talkenberg located a color image of a variant in which the sitter is wearing military insignia.] Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov-Chesmensky (Алексей Григорьевич Орлов) (5 October [O.S. 24 September] 1737 – 5 January [O.S. 24 December 1807] 1808) was a son of Governor Grigory Ivanovich Orlov (1685-1746) and Lusha Ivanovna Orlov, née Zinoviev (1710-?). In 1782, he married Evdokia Nikolayevna Lopukhina (1761-1786). He was an uncle (by marriage) to Countess Anna Ivanova Orlov, née Countess Saltykova (1777-1824), whom VLB would later paint in St. Petersburg.\n\n1771? {\"Soon the Duchess [de Chartres] sent for me to go and paint in her home.\" - Letter II} Louise Marie Adélaïde de Penthièvre, Duchess de Chartres (and later Duchess d’Orléans), 1753-1821. When her brother, the Prince de Lamballe, died in 1768, she became heiress to France’s greatest fortune. As a result she was married in 1769 to her cousin Louis Philippe Joseph d’Orléans (13 April 1747 – 6 November 1793), Duc de Chartres (1752), later Duc d’Orléans (1785), changed his name to Philippe Égalité (1792). Their eldest son, Louis Philippe (1773-1850) would reign as King of France from 1830-48. [Baillio doesn’t think this inclusion in Letter II is proof of a portrait at this time. He thinks the first portrait was done only in 1778, as listed by VLB.]\n\n1771? \"Comtesse de Brionne,\" unlocated. {\"It was not very long before I received a visit from the great and beautiful Comtesse de Brionne and her daughter, the Princesse de Lorraine.\" - Letter II} Louise-Julie-Constance de Rohan, comtesse de Brionne (1734-1815). She became chanoinesse [sequestered in a convent] of Remiremont in 1742, at the age of 8! At the age of 14 she became the third wife of the widower Charles-Louis comte de Lorraine-Brionne (1725-1761). They had four children: Charles-Eugène de Lorraine-Brionne, prince of Lambesc and last duc d’Elbeut (1751-1825); Marie-Josèphe Thérèse de Lorraine-Brionne, princess of Elbeul (1753-1797) who in 1768 married Victor Emmanuel de Savoie-Carignano, duc de Carignano [VLB painted her circa 1783-85]; Anne Charlotte, princess of Lorraine-Brionne, later abbess of Remiremont (1755-1786); and Joseph Marie de Lorraine-Brionne, prince of Vaudémont (1759-1812). After the death of her husband, the sitter became a mistress of Choiseul, whom VLB painted in 1773. For comparison, here is a sculpture by Lemoyne. [Identified by Olivier Blanc]\n\n1771? \"Princess de Lorraine,\" unlocated. {\"It was not very long before I received a visit from the great and beautiful Comtesse de Brionne and her daughter, the Princesse de Lorraine.\" - Letter II} Anne-Charlotte de Lorraine-Brionne, later abbess of Remiremont (1755-1786), the daughter of the previous sitter. [Identified by Olivier Blanc]\n\n1770 \"Charles Antoine Etienne de Choiseul-Beaupré\" {\"1 M. le Marquis de Choiseul.\"} {\"You can easily imagine how several young men might try to ingratiate themselves by asking me to paint their portrait.... I painted them with ‘the lost look’; this requires the subject to sit with his gaze facing away from the painter. . .\" [Footnote:] \"At that time, the Marquis de Choiseul was one of these, which angered me because he had just married the prettiest person in the world. She was called mademoiselle Rabi; she was American, sixteen years old. I don't think we've ever seen anything more perfect.\" - Letter II} Charles Antoine Etienne de Choiseul-Beaupré, seigneur de Sommeville, called marquis de Choiseul-Beaupré, was born in Petite Anse, Saint Domingue (now Haiti) on 10 July 1739. He died on 13 April 1820. He was colonel à la suite du régiment Dauphin (étranger) en 1763, puis lieutenant général. His parents were Antoine-Nicolas de Choiseul-Beaupré (1716-1760) and Renée-Marie-Michelle Barbé de Beauval (1718-1802). The sitter was married twice. On 11 August 1770, in the parish of St. Eustace in Paris, he married Louise Raby, a daughter of Jean-Baptiste Raby & Marthe Bourgeois. Tragically, she died in Paris on 24 October 1772, with her age given as 17. He married again, on 16 March 1775 at St. Georges-sur-Loire, to Françoise Elizabeth Marie Joséphe Walsh (born at Serrant and baptized at St. Georges-sur-Loire 15th October 1758), with whom he had seven children. She died in 1793. Baillio (2016), p. 5 and 256 n.6 claims that an oil on canvas sold at Hôtel Drouot on November 17, 2004, which had been identified as a 1775 portrait by Greuze of Renaud César de Choiseul Praslin, is instead this VLB portrait of Charles Antoine Etienne de Choiseul-Beaupré.\n\n\"Comte de Jaucourt\" {\"1 Le Comte de Zanicourt.\"} Louis-Pierre de Jaucourt d’Espeuilles (1726-1813), son of Pierre Antoine II de Jaucourt, baron d’Huban and after 1765 marquis de Chantôme, and Marie-Suzanne de Vivans (1702-1772). The sitter was maréchal de camp et armées du roi, chevalier de Saint-Louis. He married Sophie Gilly (died 1774), a cousin of Mme Pérrégaux. In 1777 he married again, to Elisabeth de Lachâtre.

VLB listed the above painting of the sculptor. She did not list a portrait of either of his sons, though in the early 20th Century, this VLB pastel was identified as the older son, Jean Baptiste Antoine Le Moyne (1742-1781), conseiller du roi, lieutenant de l’amirauté à Port-au-Prince. In January 1982, Baillio suggested that the sitter was the younger son, Pierre Hippolyte Le Moyne (1748-1828). Jeffares and d'Arnoult are satisfied with the identification of the sitter as the older son. In 1772, Antoine would have been 30, and Pierre 23.\n\n177? \"Count Alexander Sergeevich Stroganov,\" unlocated.

The sitter was a member of the Private Committee of Alexander I and assistant to the Minister of the Interior, a longtime President of the Imperial Academy of Arts, director of the Russian Imperial Library and a member of the Russian Academy. In 1758, he married Countess Anna Mikhailovna Vorontsova (13 April 1743 - 21 February 1769), the only daughter of the State Chancellor, though they had separated in November 1762. On July 27, 1769, he married Princess Catherine Petrovna Troubetzkoy (1744-1815). The couple had two children: Pavel Alexandrovich (June 7, 1772, Paris - June 10, 1817), and Sofia Alexandrovna (1776-1794). However, the couple separated in 1779 and his wife entered into an affair with Ivan Nikolaevich Rimsky-Korsakov (with whom she had four more children).

VLB only listed one couple for 1773, and the woman's portrait (below) appeared similar to a terracotta bust of Mme de Roissy by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne II (1704 -1778). Thus, Sotheby's considered the pastels to represent M. and Mme. de Roissy. However, writing in Baillio (2015), Xavier Salmon considers the poses too irregular to represent portraits, and thinks they were instead studies. He also thinks the male sitter too young to be the 22 year old M. de Roissy. Salmon suggests that the sitter was instead VLB's brother, Etienne, finding similarities to the 1773 St. Louis Art Museum's portrait in oil of Etienne. Angela Demutskiy agrees with Salmon that the sitter is Etienne.\n\n1773 “Young woman,” pastel on paper, 19 5/8\" x 19 1/4\" (50 x 49 cm), signed and dated lower right: Melle Vigée 1773.

He also thinks the male sitter (above) too young to be the 22 year old M. de Roissy. Salmon suggests that the high cheekbones and narrow chin remind him of the sitter in the ca. 1776 drawing of VLB's maid (listed in the 1776 section, below). He suggests that the young woman was in 1773 an employee of the artist's mother and stepfather, and thus a ready model. Angela Demutskiy disagrees, noting that the sitter is wearing a robe à la française of silk, which a maid from a wealthy employer might wear, but not the maid of a stingy employer such as M. le Sevre.\n\n1775 “Alexandre Jean Baptiste Rouillé de Fontaine,” oil on canvas, 25 1/2\" x 21\" (64.6 x 53.5 cm).

In 1770, he married Agnès Thérèse Sémen de Brémond (1749-1832) [whose sister Marie-Louise was painted by VLB; see later this year]. The Marquis de Chabrignac died in America in 1781, leaving a son, Jacques (1772-1858). [Identified by Olivier Blanc.]\n\n{\"1 M. le Maréchal Comte de Stainville.\"} Jacques de Choiseul-Stainville, comte de Stainville, maréchal de France (?-1789). He married Thérèse de Clermont-Revel, whom he later locked in a convent, after her affair with the comedian, Claival. The couple had two daughters: the first, called \"Mlle. de Choiseul\" in 1778 married her cousin Claude Antoine de Choiseul Labaume (1760-?) -- they wore the name Choiseul Stainville after their marriage, and had two sons; the second daughter, called \"Mlle. de Stainville\", married Prince Joseph de Monaco. The sitter’s older siblings were Étienne-François Choiseul, Comte de Stainville, 1719-85, prime minister of Louis XV, and Béatrice de Choiseul-Stanville, who became the duchess de Grammont.

(Blue silk blouse, pink jasmine). {\"3 Mme de Bonneuil.\"} {\"...the prettiest woman in Paris...\" - Letter III} Born Michelle Sentuary (March 1748) on Bourbon Island, now Reunion Island, East Africa. She married Jean-Cyrille Guesnon de Bonneuil in Bordeaux in January 1768. She was involved in espionage during the emigration. She died in Paris, December 1829. [Identified by Olivier Blanc, a biographer of Mme de Bonneuil and her family. Compare to the 1769 portrait by Roslin.] VLB also painted the sitter’s sister, Mme Thilorier in 1773 (and 1778?), and her daughter, Laure de Bonneuil in 1805. Olivier Blanc suggests that VLB may have also painted the sitter’s other sister, Mme Testart in 1773, misspelling her name as \"Mme Tétare\".\n\n1773 \"Mme de Bonneuil,\" oil on canvas, oval, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Caen. {\"3 Mme de Bonneuil.\"} {\"...the prettiest woman in Paris...\" - Letter III} This painting was at one time called Mme de Guiche, and then Baillio suggested the sitter was the future Mdm Sanlot, a mistake which has been repeated by the museum. Olivier Blanc discovered that this painting was restored in the 1930s, with the face being overpainted as may be seen in this modern color photo. With the overpainting, the face looks exactly like that of Mdm Sanlot (see 1776). However, based on the pre-restoration black and white, Olivier has identified the sitter as Mme de Bonneuil. For comparison, see the 1769 portrait of Mme de Bonneuil by Roslin, and a sculpture of that sitter by LeMoyne.\n\n{\"1 Mme de Saint-Pays.\"} Perhaps Mme de Saint-Paër, who had been the mistress of Louis-Alexandre-Stanislas de Bourbon, Prince de Lamballe (died 1768).

They family were very rich, owning plantations in Saint-Domingo. The costume dates the painting to 1770-75, before her 1779 wedding. Her husband, Jacques II du Puy de Montbrun, Lord of Rochefort-en-Valsaín, was brigadier of cavalry, received the honors of the court, was a knight of Saint-Louis and a Knight of Malta. He died in Philadelphia (U.S.A.), in 1793. The attribution of the painting to VLB is by Laurent Hugues, conservateur of French museums, in his book, \"L’enfant chéri\", p.48.

In 1769 she married Jacques Thilorier (1742-1783). In 1786, she remarried Jean-Jacques Duval d’ Eprémesnil. She was decapitated in Paris on June 17, 1794 (her husband had been guillotined in April 1794). [Here’s a 1769 pastel by Perroneau.] She was the sister of Mme de Bonneuil, who was painted by VLB earlier in 1773, and also a sister of Mme Testart, who may be the next name on VLB’s list. [Biographical information courtesy of Olivier Blanc, who published a study on the sitter in 1997, through the Paris publishing house of Perrin.] VLB also painted the sitter in 1778 and her husband in 1777; we have images for both of those paintings.\n\n{\"1 A copy of the same.\"}\n\n{\"1 Mme Tétare.\"} Olivier Blanc suggests this is a misspelling for Mme Testart, the sister of the previous sitter, Mme Thilorier, and also a sister to Mme de Bonneuil, listed earlier this year. Born Marie-Catherine Sentuary on Bourbon Island in 1747, she married in 1767 to Jean-Louis Testart (1744-1814). She died at a young age, in 1783.\n\n{\"1 Copy of [a portrait by another artist of] the Bishop of Beauvais.\"}\n\n{\"1 M. de Vismes.\"} Alphonse de Vismes de Saint-Alphonse, from Amiens, he would become fermier général in 1786. Son of an employee of the administration of the Farms, he was fond of music and painting. His sister, Adélaïde Suzanne de Vismes de Saint-Alphonse married Jean Benjamin de Laborde. She was a friend of Mme du Barry and Sophie Arnould. In 1780, the queen created for her the charge of \"dame du lit\" in Versailles. (A reference has also been found to a M. de Vismes du Valgay, director of the Opera. It is unclear if this is the same man, or his brother.) [Identified by Olivier Blanc.]\n\n{\"1 M.

[Attribution by Joseph Baillio.]\n\n{\"1 Little Roissy.\"} Perhaps the son of M. and Mme de Roissy, whom appear at the top of VLB's list for 1773. Angela Demutskiy suggests that this could be the pastel of a young boy playing with a cup-and-ball game (which I showed at the end of the 1773 list, as the pastel is dated 1773).\n\n{\"1 Copy of [a portrait by another artist of] the Chancellor [d’Aguesseau].\"} Henri-François Daguesseau, 1668-1751, one of the most distinguished magistrates of his time in France (essentially minister of Justice).\n\n{\"1 Copy of [a portrait by another artist of] M. de la Marche.\"} Either Douglas, comte de la March, who in 1778 would become Duke of Queensbury; or else the son of the Prince de Conti, who was called comte de La Marche. [Researched by Olivier Blanc.]\n\n{\"1 Mme Damerval.\"}Aglé Chol de Clercy was born to Mme Chol de Clercy (née Charlotte Dupuy). While Charlotte was married to Claude Chol de Clercy, Grand Prévôt de la Maréchaussée de Lyon, she conducted an affair with the famous minister of Louis XV, Abbé Terray, and it was Terray who was the natural father of Aglé. When Aglé was 12 years old, she was married to an old count d'Amerval. After separating from the count, she lived in the apartment of his sister, Baroness de La Garde, in the hotel of Contrôle général des finances. (The Baroness was the new mistress of Terray.) In 1771, after a financial scandal, Count d'Amerval and his sister Baroness de La Garde were exiled to Lorraine, at which point the young Mme d'Amerval was sent to the convent of Port-Royal. In 1774, she became the mistress of Count de Langeac, whom VLB painted in 1775. Aglé became pregnant by Langeac. The sitter died in Passay. VLB also lists this sitter in 1776, though that work may simply be a copy of this one.

She was received choriste à l'Académie royale de musique (l'Opéra) when she began an affair with Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'Etioles, who was already married to Mme de Pompadour, the royal favourite. In 1763, Mlle. Matha bought a mansion at rue du Gros-Chenêt, n°34, in front of the house of Jean-Baptiste Le Brun (who would marry VLB in 1775). His house had entrances both on rue de Cléry and rue du Gros-Chenêt. After Mme de Pompadour's death in 1765, Mlle. Matha was able to marry her lover, and they lived in the mansion. In 1774, they asked their young neighbor, Mlle. Vigée, to paint a portrait of Mme Lenormant. The sitter died in 1809, some years after her husband. [Identification and information courtesy of Olivier Blanc.] The sitter also appears on the list for 1777. Helm's book describes one of the two paintings of this sitter as “Sitting, elbow resting on a cushion. Holding a pamphlet. Muslin dress, sash.”\n\n{\"1 Mme de la Grange.\"} Angélique Adélaïde de Meliand, daughter of Charles Blaise de Méliand, maître des requêtes puis conseiller d’Etat, and Marie Louise Adélaïde du Quesnoy.

She had a son, Thomas Charles Gaston Boissel de Monville, baron de l'Empire (1763-1832), who would marry Anne-Simone Sautereau (1760-?), and a daughter, Thérèse Charlotte Boissel de Monville (?-1829), who married Michel Archange Duval du Manoir, comte de l'Empire, chamberlain of Napoleon I.\n\n{\"1 Mme Denis\"} {VLB mentions staying with \"the wife of Denis, the landscape painter,\" in Rome, in 1789-90. - Chapter IV} VLB mentions two women named Denis in her Souvenirs, both in Rome.

VLB also mentions that after many months in Rome, she wanted to visit Naples, and was urged to be accompanied by M. Duvivier, the husband of Voltaire's niece, the widow of M. Denis. This was Marie Louise Mignot (8 February 1712, Paris - 20 August 1790, Paris), the daughter of Catherine Arouet (1686–1726) and her husband Pierre-François Mignot (d. 1737). In 1737, Voltaire provided her with a dowry that enabled her to marry army supply officer Nicolas Charles Denis (d. 1744).

[The sitter of this painting was previously misidentified as Prince Alexandre Alexeewitch Viazemski.] VLB painted a number of the sitter's relative: (1) his niece, Countess Varvara Nikolaevna Golovina, née Princess Golitzyna (Варвара Николаевна Головина, урожденная княжна Голицына) (1766-1819); (2) his cousin, Countess Aleksandra Andreevna von Dietrichstein, née Countess Shuvalova, later Princess (8 December 1775 – 10 November 1847, Vienna); (3) his cousin, Princess Praskovya Andreevna Golitzyna, née Countess Shuvalova (Прасковья Андреевна Шувалова) (19 December 1767 – 11 December 1828, Paris); (4) his cousin, Count Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (Павел Андреевич Шувалов) (21 May 1776 - 1 December 1823); (5) his cousin, Countess Ivanova Orlov, née Countess Saltykova (1777-1824); (6) his cousin, Natalia Zakharovna Kolychёva, née Khitrovo (1774-1803); and (7) his cousin, Field Marshal Count Ivan Petrovich Saltykov (Иван Петрович Салтыков) (28 June 1730 – 14 November 1805).\n\n\"Comte de Langeac\" {\"1 M. le Comte de Langeas.\"} Auguste Louis Joseph Fidèle Armand. He was born in 1748. His mother, Madeleine de Cusac, first married M. Sabatini. She then married comte de Langeac de Lespinasse, by whose name Auguste was known, though he is actually the natural son of ministre La Vrillère, with whom Madeleine was having an affair. The sitter became colonel d’infanterie, chevalier de l’Ordre royal et militaire de Saint Louis, ancien capitaine des gardes de la porte de Monsieur, promoted maréchal de camp in 1791, émigrated after Varennes. He is known for his affair with countess de Neuilly. [Identified by Olivier Blanc.]\n\n{\"1 Mme Mongé.\"} Perhaps this is Marie Adélaïde Deschamps, wife of Louis Monge, later (1808) chevalier de l'Empire (1748-1827), professeur à l'école militaire de Metz and examinateur des aspirants de marine. There is another listing for Mme Monge in 1778, which could be the same sitter, or could be Marie Catherine Huart (?-1846) who in 1777 married Louis’s brother, Gaspard Monge (1746-1818), later (1808) comte Monge de Péluse et de l'Empire, who was ministre de la marine in 1792. (Suggested by Timothy F.

Olivier's suggestion was based on comparison to an engraving of Mme de Fougeret, done after the Terror, when she turned to charity work. Olivier also suggested that the painting could be by VLB's listed portrait of Mme de Fougerait, but others believe that the attribution of the painting to Kauffmann is more likely. Charlotte d’Outremont, daughter of a Conseiller au Grand Conseil, who in 1770 married Jean de Fougeret (guillotined 1794), receveur général des Finances du comté de Bourgogne.

Another possibility appears in her in her memoirs:{\"I often saw M. de Monville there, a pleasant, elegant man, who took us to see a part of the countryside known as ‘Le Desert’ and a house which was no more than a tower.\" - Letter X} The M. de Monville mentioned in Letter X is certainly François Nicolas Henri, Racine de Monville (4 October 1734-9 March 1797), French aristocrat, musician, architect and landscape designer, best known for his French landscape garden, Le Désert de Retz, which influenced Thomas Jefferson and other later architects. Letter X takes place around 1782, when the column house at Désert de Retz was completed. The earlier listing for \"Mme. de Monville with her child\" could not be related to Racine de Monville, though, as he had no known progeny, and as his wife, Aimable Charlotte Félicité Lucas de Boncourt, had died in 1761.\n\n{\"1 Mlle de Cossé.\"} Adélaïde Pauline Rosalie de Cosse Brissac, the daughter of Louis Hercule Timoléon, duc de Cossé and Adélaide Dianne Délie Mancini, daughter of duke de Nivernois.

However, VLB probably would have referred to his military title. (2) His only son, Henri-Louis-Marie de Rohan, 1745-1809. At the time his title was prince de Guéméné, but as VLB didn’t record her list until decades later, she might have chosen to record him by the title prince de Rohan, which he inherited in 1788. (3) The latter’s eldest son, Charles-Alain-Gabriel (1764-1836). [If VLB had painted #3, as well as his youngest brother Jules (listed below), it would seem odd that she wouldn’t also have painted and listed the middle brother, Louis-Victor-Mériadec (1766-1846). Thus, #2 seems most likely.]\n\n\"Prince Jules de Rohan,\" 19 x 15 cm, sold in Paris Auction ca. 1986. {\"1 Le Prince Jules de Rohan.\"} Jules-Armand-Louis de Rohan-Guemenée (1768-1836), son of Henri-Louis- Marie de Rohan (1745-1809), and grandson of Jules-Henri-Mériadec, prince de Rohan, maréchal de France (1726-88).\n\n{\"1 M.

In 1760 she married Jean-Joseph de Laborde, the court banker. Their children were Alexandre and Nathalie. Mme de La Borde’s sister, Mme Micault d’Harvelay, married Calonne in England in 1787. [Information from Olivier Blanc and Kevin Kelly.] Olivier also suggests this could have been Adélaïde Suzanne de Vismes de Saint-Alphonse, who married Jean Benjamin de Laborde. She was a friend of Mme du Barry and Sophie Arnould. In 1780, the queen created for her the charge of \"dame du lit\" in Versailles.\n\n{\"1 Mlle de Givris.\"} Perhaps a sister of François Nicolas-Henri Le Sueur de Givry (married Sophie Lévêque de Courmont in 1772) and Charles-Antoine Le Sueur de Givry (married Marie-Louise Charlotte de Foucault de Coucy in 1767). Or if the sitter was a young girl, she could have been a daughter of one of these brothers. Alternatively, the sitter could have been a relative of Louis-Auguste Aubelin de Givry, chevalier de malte.

Their mother, Maryann Camasse, later Countess von Forbach, had in her youth been a ballerina in the court of King Louis the XIV. The regiment came to America in 1780 to take part in the Revolutionary War.

Maximilien was a son of Charlotte de Mailly-Nesle (d. 1769), who had a rocky marriage with Emmanuel of Nassau-Siegen (6 January 1688 - 1 August 1735), a member of the Catholic branch of the House of Orange. Emmanuel originally recognized Maximilien as his son, though at the end of his life rejected him as illegitimate. The Aulic Council of the Holy Roman Empire declared Maximilien illegitimate on 17 December 1744, at the urging of William IV, Prince of Orange, and the decision was confirmed by Emperor Francis I on 15 October 1745. A French court in 1756 posthumously recognized Maximilien as the legitimate son of Emmanuel, and his son therefore styled himself Prince of Nassau-Siegen. However, Nassau-Siegen was in the territory of the Holy Roman Empire, which did not change its stance, and Nassau-Siegen was inherited by a different branch of the family. The sitter accompanied Louis-Antoine de Bougainville in his voyage around the world, 1766-69, with the most memorable stop being in Tahiti, discovered only 10 months earlier. On 14 September 1780, he married the Polish countess Karolina Gozdzka (1747-1807), whose first marriage to Prince Janusz Wladyslaw Sanguszko had been annulled in 1778.

She was the daughter of marquis Anne Élisabeth Pierre de Montesquiou Fézensac (17 October 1739, Paris - 30 December 1798, Paris), maréchal de Camp et député de la noblesse aux Etats-Généraux, and his wife, Jeanne Marie Hocquart de Montfermeil (born 1743). The sitter was dame d'honneur de Madame Elisabeth. She married on 3 February 1779 to Annet François V, Marquis de Lastic (1759-1783), an infantry captain in the Beaujolais regiment. [Identification from Angela Demutskiy, with additional biographical information from Olivier Blanc and improved image from Jana Talkenberg.] Later this year, VLB listed “M. and Mme. De Montesquiou,” generally believed to be the sitter's parents (who were properly Marquis & Marquise de Montesquiou) or perhaps her younger brother and sister-in-law, Henry de Montesquiou Fézensac, who were not titled at the time. In 1780, VLB painted the sitter's husband. In 1782, VLB painted the sitter's brother and sister-in-law, \"Mme la Baronne de Montesquiou\" and \"Le Baron de Montesquiou.\"\n\n{\"1 A Jewish woman f"
