In the early days of his brewery activities Mr. Kunz was brewmaster and made special trips to Germany to study proper brewing of ingredients going into the manufacture of beer. The deceased was born near Stuttgart, Germany, in 1854, the son of Johann and Elizabeth Kunz. His father was the owner of a brewery in Germany.

Kunz, 37, formerly of Manitowoc, Wis., a film studio guard here, may have driven his automobile around the city with his dead wife sitting beside him as a passenger, according to police here. Theyll never know positively, however, for Kunz took that secret with him to his death. He committed suicide, officers said. He ended his life at the home of friends in nearby Venice, police said. Police, after finding suicide notes on Kunzs body, indicating domestic troubles, located the automobile containing the body of the dead mans wife, Dorothy Anderson Kunz, 33, apparently, a murder victim. A coroners report indicates that Mrs. Kunz had been dead 24 hours. A friend told officers that Kunz came to his apartment Friday and said that he had murdered Mrs. Kunz. Later, however, the studio guard denied that story. One of the suicide notes requested that both bodies be cremated and the ashes scattered over the Pacific ocean.

Mr. Kunz had sustained a fracture at the base of the skull and his spine was broken, causing paralysis. Physicians held out no hope of recovery. The death of Mr. Kunz is the first resulting from an accident of the kind in months here and causes wide spread sorrow in the city and the sympathy of the community will go out to the bereaved family. Mr. Kunz was engaged in the motorcycle business, conducted an agency and shop on Buffalo street and was achieving a marked degree of success in his business when the fatal mishap claimed his life, cutting him off in the prime of young manhood when Life was all before him. Mr. Kunz, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kunz, North Sixth street, was born in this city and was 22 years of age February 27. He attended the local schools and was later employed with the M.G. Madson Seed Co. In 1917 Mr. Kunz purchased the motorcycle business of the late Joseph Peterik and conducted it until he enlisted in the service in June 1918. He was attached to the motorcycle convoy, with headquarters in Paris, having been sent overseas soon after his enlistment and remained there until June of this year, returning here about June 20, when he re- engaged in his business and reopened the shop on Buffalo street. Mr. Kunz was an enthusiastic motorcyclist and enjoyed nothing more than driving his car and availed himself of every opportunity to be out. He was taking a drive into the country with a friend at the time of the tragedy and had reached the Muth Hill on the Shoto road when the accident occurred. Details of this accident have already been published. Besides his parents Mr. Kunz is survived by three brothers, Lester Kunz, who is a salesman for the Madson Seed Co., and who is at present in Minnesota, Franklin and Paul at home. Efforts are being made to get into touch with Lester Kunz to advise him of his brother's death and the funeral arrangements will be deferred until he is heard from. Mr. Kunz was a young man of brilliant future, possessing the qualifi- cations of the successful business man and character and industry to succeed. His untimely death is deeply developed and has cast a pall over the city and brings keen sorrow to a host of friends. The unfortunate circumstances surrounding the accident, the snuffing out of life of a young man a few seconds before in robust health, accentuate the tragedy.
