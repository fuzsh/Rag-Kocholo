He held the Leiden chair of logic (1619), and taught ethics (1620–8) and physics (1628–35).

Presumably, he is also the same as ‘Johannes Casear’ who studied theology (21 May 1661) in Leiden. After his st... Read more\n\nGiovanni Domenico Cassini I taught astronomy in Bologna. He was the director (1671) of the Royal Observatory in Paris. His brilliance and reputation rests upon many scientific achievements: the ‘Cassini ovals’, the first measurement of the size of France, and the discovery of the big red spot on Jupiter, an observation he shared with Robert Hooke.
