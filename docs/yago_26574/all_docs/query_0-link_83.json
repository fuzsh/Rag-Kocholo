        "text": "Bavarian Royalty: Prince Ludwig (1913-2008)\n\nPrince Ludwig Karl Maria Anton Joseph Prinz von Bayern was born at Schloss Nymphenburg, Munich (1913). He was a member of the Bavarian royal dynasty--the House of Wittelsbach. He was the eldest son of Prince Franz of Bavaria and his wife Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ. Prince Franz was the third son of King Ludwig III and a highly decorated world War I officer. As a result of the War, Germany became a republic and the Wittelsbachs and other German royals were removed from power. Prince Ludwig attended the Maximilian-gymnasium (located in Schwabing, Munich). German state schools were highly regarded and even aristocratic families sent their children to the state schools. He studied Forestry at a Hungarian university. We're unsure why he did not attend a German university. It may have been related to the NAZI take over in Germany (1933), but we are not sure. His mother's family was the House of Croÿ with international connections, including Hungary. Prince Ludwig was drafted in to the Whermacht (1939). He saw service at the beginning of the War, serving as a Gebirgsjäger (Mountain Riflemen). After the Kaiser's grandson was killed in France, Hitler wasapauled with the outpouring of opublic sympthy toward the Hohenx\\zollerns. He issued the Prinzenerlass (1940), an effort to ensure that German royal families would not share in the glories of his wars. Prince Ludwig was relieved from all combat duties (1941). He wnt to Hungary. We do not yet have the details, but moving to Hungary which was not occupied by the NAZIs until 1944 suggests he was trying to get away from the NAZIs and the War. He spent the rest of the War in Hungary. Prince Ludwig married his first cousin Princess Irmingard of Bavaria, the daughter of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria and Princess Antonia of Luxembourg (1950). They had three children: Luitpold (1951- ), Irmingard Maria (1953), and Philippa (1954). Only Princess Luitpold survived infancy. When Crown Prince Rupprecht died (1955), Prince Ludwig and his wife moved into Schloss Leutstetten. Prince Ludwig is a Grand Prior of the Bavarian Order of Saint George, Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert and since 1960 a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nParents\n\nHe was a member of the Bavarian royal dynasty--the House of Wittelsbach. He was the eldest son of Prince Franz of Bavaria and his wife Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ. Prince Franz was the third son of King Ludwig III and a highly decorated world War I officer.\n\nChildhood\n\nPrince Ludwig Karl Maria Anton Joseph Prinz von Bayern was born at Schloss Nymphenburg, Munich (1913). As a result of the War, Germany and Bavaria with it became a republic. The Wittelsbachs and other German royals were removed from power. This of course affected the chilhood of Pince Ludwig and his siblings. They still werewealthy. Prince Ludwig grew up with his five siblings. He was the oldest. but the other children were close in age. Thus he had plenty of playmates. And they had pleny of toys. One photograph shows Prince Ludwig playing with a kind of bike/waggon like item similar to an Iruish mail. The NAZI take over took place after his childhood whenhe was about 20 years old. So he never entered the Hitler Youth. The family was, however, because of their anti-NAZI stand was afected by NAZI rule. Which explains why the family spent so much time in Hungary.\n\nChilhood Clothes\n\nWe do not yet have much information on Prince Ludwig's childhood clothing. As best we can tell as a younger boy Ludwig was dressed in the fancy styles common with Bavarian royalty at the time. We can see the various styles with the clothes worn by the children of Crown Prince Ruprecht. We have fewer actual images of Prince Ludwig. The images taken during World War I show him as a younger boy wearing the same styles as his royal cousins. We see fancy blouses with big collar and velvet Fauntleroy styled suits. The fancy blouse seen here is a good example (figure 1). After the War, the Wittelsbachs lost power. This affected their social sranding and wealth. As a result, of an agreement with the Bavarian Government (1923), however, they retained a great deal of property and thus wealth. The children thus continued to lead a very affluent lifestyle which included fancy clohes. Thus we see Ludwig as he approached his teen years still wearing a velvet Fauntleroy suit and elaborate lace collar. There is a difference, however, he wears ankle socks rather than stockings. We note other aristocratic boys in Germany who continued to be dressed in fancy outfits after the War, although usully not quite as fancy as the Wittelsbach children.\n\nEducation\n\nWe beliecve that Prince Ludwig and his sisters as younger children were tutored at home, but have not yety been anle to confirm this, Prince Ludwig attended the Maximilian-gymnasium (located in Schwabing, Munich). German state schools were highly regarded and even aristocratic families sent their children to the state schools. He studied Forestry at the University of Budapest, a Hungarian university. An agreement with the Bavarian state government (1923), allowed the Wittelsbachs to retain corporate ownership of several properties including palaces and castles as well as large areas of forest and agricultural land. This probably explains the Prince's choice of university studies. His father to avoid membership in the NAZI University Student Corps, had Ludwig withdrew from the German university he had entered. Instead he did his university studies in Hungary. The family's land holdings in Hungary were also a factor. His mother's family was the House of Croÿ with international connections, including Hungary.\n\nWorld War II\n\nPrince Ludwig was drafted in to the Whermacht (1939). While the family was living in Hungary, they were German citizens. Prince Ludwig saw service at the beginning of the War, serving as a Gebirgsjäger Mountain Riflemen). This probably reflected his skiing skills. After the Kaiser's grandson was killed in France, Hitler was apauled with the outpouring of public sympathy toward the Hohenzollerns. He thus issued the Prinzenerlass (1940), an effort to ensure that German royal families would not share in the glories of his wars. Prince Ludwig was relieved from all combat duties (1941). He went to Hungary. We do not yet have the details, but moving to Hungary which was not occupied by the NAZIs until 1944 suggests he was trying to get away from the NAZIs and the War. He spent the rest of the War in Hungary. He lived at Sarvar where the family owned a castle. With the obliteration of Hungarian Army units around Stalingrad and the subsequent advance west of the Red Army, Hungary looked for a way out of the War into Hitler had dragged them. With his Hungarian ally wavering, Hitler seized control of the country (1944). At the end of the War with the approach of the Red Army, the family fled back to Bavaria. They settled at Leutstetten near Starnberg.\n\nFamily\n\nPrince Ludwig married his first cousin Princess Irmingard of Bavaria, the daughter of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria and Princess Antonia of Luxembourg (1950). They had three children: Luitpold (1951- ), Irmingard Maria (1953), and Philippa (1954). Only Princess Luitpold survived infancy.\n\nLater Life\n\nWhen Crown Prince Rupprecht died (1955), Prince Ludwig and his wife moved into Schloss Leutstetten. Prince Ludwig is a Grand Prior of the Bavarian Order of Saint George, Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert and since 1960 a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Ludwig died of pneumonia at Schloss Leutstetten (2008).\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Main Prinz Franz page]\n\n[Teturn to the Main Bavarian pages]\n\n[Return to the Main royal pages]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [German Empire] [German states] [Italy] [Luxenburg]\n\n[Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\nCreated: 10:42 PM 7/28/2008\n\nLast updated: 5:38 PM 8/29/2012"
