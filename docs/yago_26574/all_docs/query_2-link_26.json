        "text": "Effect of repeated passive anterior loading on human knee anterior laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nVauhnik, Renata; Perme, Maja Pohar; Barcellona, Massimo G; Morrissey, Matthew C; SevÅ¡ek, France; Rugelj, Darja\n\n2015-10-01\n\nIncreased knee anterior laxity results when the anterior cruciate ligament is injured. This increased laxity can cause knee dysfunction. Until recently this laxity was believed to be only diminished through surgery. But recent findings indicate that knee anterior laxity may be decreased with repeated loading of the knee. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that regular passive anterior loading of the uninjured human knee would enhance its stiffness. Randomized controlled trial. Knee anterior laxity was tested using an arthrometer in 22 young, uninjured females before, during and after a 3 month period during which passive anterior loading was applied by a trained physiotherapist over 5 sessions per week to a randomly assigned knee. Knee anterior laxity was not affected by the passive anterior loading of the knee. Given that in this study repeated passive loading of the knee did not change knee anterior laxity, it would be easy to conclude that this training is ineffective and no further research is required. We caution against this given the relatively short duration and possibly insufficient intensity of the training and the population studied; individuals with normal joint laxity. We recommend that future research be performed that consists of individuals with lax joints who receive training for prolonged periods. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This was a cross-sectional study. Anterior knee laxity was measured at 133N and manual maximal forces using the KT2000 knee arthrometer, in 8 ACL-injured and 13 uninjured individuals. Electromyographic activity of the lateral hamstrings was measured during laxity testing. Subjects contracted the hamstrings during anterior knee laxity testing at eight predetermined levels of maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Volitional contraction of the lateral hamstrings reduced anterior knee laxity logarithmically for both the 133N and manual maximal tests in both the ACL-injured and uninjured knees. A simple linear regression model, with the log of percentage of maximum lateral hamstrings activity as the sole predictor, explained approximately 70-80% of the variation in anterior knee laxity. Both ACL-injured and uninjured subjects reduced anterior knee laxity at the same rate with increases in muscle activity. However, initial lateral hamstrings muscle activity had a greater effect on percentage anterior knee laxity scores in the ACL-injured as compared to the uninjured knee. Lateral hamstrings activity reduces anterior knee laxity in a nonlinear manner, whereby the initial lower level of activation produces the greatest change in anterior knee laxity. Therefore, hamstrings muscle activity must be monitored during anterior knee laxity testing.\n\nMeasurement of knee stiffness and laxity in patients with documented absence of the anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarkolf, K L; Kochan, A; Amstutz, H C\n\n1984-02-01\n\nThirty-five patients with documented absence of the anterior cruciate ligament were tested on the University of California, Los Angeles, instrumented clinical knee-testing apparatus and we measured the response curves for the following testing modes: anterior-posterior force versus displacement at full extension and at 20 and 90 degrees of flexion; varus-valgus moment versus angulation at full extension and 20 degrees of flexion; and tibial torque versus rotation at 20 degrees of flexion. Absolute values of stiffness and laxity and right-left differences for these injured knees were compared with identical quantities measured previously for a control population of forty-nine normal subjects with no history of treatment for injury to the knee. For both the uninjured knees and the knees without an anterior cruciate ligament, at 20 and 90 degrees of flexion the anterior-posterior laxity was greatest at approximately 15 degrees of external rotation of the foot. The injured knees demonstrated significantly increased total anterior-posterior laxity and decreased anterior stiffness when compared with the uninjured knees in all tested positions of the foot and knee. The mean increase in paired anterior-posterior laxity for the injured knees in this group of patients at +/- 200 newtons of applied anterior-posterior force was 3.1 millimeters (+39 per cent) at full extension, 5.5 millimeters (+57 per cent) at 20 degrees of flexion, and 2.5 millimeters (+34 per cent) at 90 degrees of flexion. The mean reduction in anterior stiffness for injured knees was also greatest (-54 per cent) at 20 degrees of knee flexion. Only slight reduction in posterior stiffness (-16 per cent) was measured at 20 degrees of flexion, and this probably reflected the presence of associated capsular and meniscal injuries. In the group of anterior cruciate-deficient knees, the patients with an absent medial meniscus showed greater total anterior-posterior laxity in all three positions of knee flexion\n\nEffect of High-Grade Preoperative Knee Laxity on Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMagnussen, Robert A; Reinke, Emily K; Huston, Laura J; Hewett, Timothy E; Spindler, Kurt P\n\n2016-12-01\n\nKnee laxity in the setting of suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is frequently assessed through physical examination using the Lachman, pivot-shift, and anterior drawer tests. The degree of laxity noted on these examinations may influence treatment decisions and prognosis. Increased preoperative knee laxity would be associated with increased risk of subsequent revision ACL reconstruction and worse patient-reported outcomes 2 years postoperatively. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. From an ongoing prospective cohort study, 2333 patients who underwent primary isolated ACL reconstruction without collateral or posterior cruciate ligament injury were identified. Patients reported by the operating surgeons as having an International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) grade D for Lachman, anterior drawer, or pivot-shift examination were classified as having high-grade laxity. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate whether having high-grade preoperative laxity was associated with increased odds of undergoing revision ACL reconstruction within 2 years of the index procedure, controlling for patient age, sex, Marx activity level, level of competition, and graft type. Multiple linear regression modeling was used to evaluate whether having high-grade preoperative laxity was associated with worse IKDC score or Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Knee-Related Quality of Life subscale (KOOS-QOL) scores at a minimum 2 years postoperatively, controlling for baseline score, patient age, ethnicity, sex, body mass index, marital status, smoking status, sport participation, competition level, Marx activity rating score, graft type, and articular cartilage and meniscus status. Pre-reconstruction laxity data were available for 2325 patients (99.7%). Two-year revision data were available for 2259 patients (96.8%), and patient-reported outcomes were available for 1979 patients (84.8%). High-grade preoperative laxity was noted in 743 patients\n\nAssociation of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Width With Anterior Knee Laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hsin-Min; Shultz, Sandra J; Schmitz, Randy J\n\n2016-06-02\n\nGreater anterior knee laxity (AKL) has been identified as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factor. The structural factors that contribute to greater AKL are not fully understood but may include the ACL and bone geometry. To determine the relationship of ACL width and femoral notch angle to AKL. Cross-sectional study. Controlled laboratory. Twenty recreationally active females (age = 21.2 Â± 3.1 years, height = 1.66.1 Â± 7.3 cm, mass = 66.5 Â± 12.0 kg). Anterior cruciate ligament width and femoral notch angle were obtained with magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and AKL was assessed. Anterior cruciate ligament width was measured as the width of a line that transected the ACL and was drawn perpendicular to the Blumensaat line. Femoral notch angle was formed by the intersection of the line parallel to the posterior cortex of the femur and the Blumensaat line. Anterior knee laxity was the anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur (mm) at 130 N of an applied force. Ten participants' magnetic resonance imaging data were assessed on 2 occasions to establish intratester reliability and precision. Using stepwise backward linear regression, we examined the extent to which ACL width, femoral notch angle, and weight were associated with AKL. Strong measurement consistency and precision (intraclass correlation coefficient [2,1] Â± SEM) were established for ACL width (0.98 Â± 0.3 mm) and femoral notch angle (0.97Â° Â± 1.1Â°). The regression demonstrated that ACL width (5.9 Â± 1.4 mm) was negatively associated with AKL (7.2 Â± 2.0 mm; R(2) = 0.22, P = .04). Femoral notch angle and weight were not retained in the final model. A narrower ACL was associated with greater AKL. This finding may inform the development of ACL injury-prevention programs that include components designed to increase ACL size or strength (or both). Future authors should establish which other factors contribute to greater AKL in order to best inform injury-prevention efforts.\n\nThe relationships between instrumented measurements of ankle and knee ligamentous laxity and generalized joint laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nPearsall, A W; Kovaleski, J E; Heitman, R J; Gurchiek, L R; Hollis, J M\n\n2006-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lower extremity joint laxity is a function of a particular joint and/or a generalizable characteristic (trait) of the person. Validated instrumented measurements of ankle and knee joint-specific laxity in the same individual were correlated to determine whether a relationship exists. In addition, ankle and knee joint-specific laxity were correlated with generalized joint laxity using the modified Beighton mobility index. Fifty-seven male and female athletes were studied. We examined dominant ankle laxity using an ankle arthrometer and dominate knee anterior laxity using the KT 2000. The dominant ankle was loaded in anteroposterior (AP) drawer and inversion-eversion (I-E) rotation. Laxity was measured as total AP displacement (millimeters) after +/-125 N of applied force and total I-E rotation (degrees) was measured after +/-4 N x m of applied torque. The dominant knee was loaded with an anterior drawer and laxity (millimeters) was measured after manual maximum displacement. Non-significant correlations were observed among the test variables for generalized joint laxity (0.21 to 0.37; P>0.05) and instrumented ankle and knee joint laxity (0.19 to 0.21; P>0.05). When examined by gender, no statistically significant correlations (0.05 to 0.40; P>0.05) were found for either generalized laxity or instrumented ankle and knee joint laxity. These results imply that ankle and knee joint laxity are joint-specific and not generalizable.\n\nQuantifying in vivo laxity in the anterior cruciate ligament and individual knee joint structures.\n\nPubMed\n\nWestover, L M; Sinaei, N; KÃ¼pper, J C; Ronsky, J L\n\n2016-11-01\n\nA custom knee loading apparatus (KLA), when used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging, enables in vivo measurement of the gross anterior laxity of the knee joint. A numerical model was applied to the KLA to understand the contribution of the individual joint structures and to estimate the stiffness of the anterior-cruciate ligament (ACL). The model was evaluated with a cadaveric study using an in situ knee loading apparatus and an ElectroForce test system. A constrained optimization solution technique was able to predict the restraining forces within the soft-tissue structures and joint contact. The numerical model presented here allowed in vivo prediction of the material stiffness parameters of the ACL in response to applied anterior loading. Promising results were obtained for in vivo load sharing within the structures. The numerical model overestimated the ACL forces by 27.61-92.71%. This study presents a novel approach to estimate ligament stiffness and provides the basis to develop a robust and accurate measure of in vivo knee joint laxity.\n\nBiomechanical Evaluation of Knee Joint Laxities and Graft Forces After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction by Anteromedial Portal, Outside-In, and Transtibial Techniques\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSim, Jae Ang; Gadikota, Hemanth R.; Li, Jing-Sheng; Li, Guoan; Gill, Thomas J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Recently, anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is emphasized to improve joint laxity and to potentially avert initiation of cartilage degeneration. There is a paucity of information on the efficacy of ACL reconstructions by currently practiced tunnel creation techniques in restoring normal joint laxity. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Hypothesis Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by the anteromedial (AM) portal technique, outside-in (OI) technique, and modified transtibial (TT) technique can equally restore the normal knee joint laxity and ACL forces. Methods Eight fresh-frozen human cadaveric knee specimens were tested using a robotic testing system under an anterior tibial load (134 N) at 0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â° of flexion and combined torques (10-NÂ·m valgus and 5-NÂ·m internal tibial torques) at 0Â° and 30Â° of flexion. Knee joint kinematics, ACL, and ACL graft forces were measured in each knee specimen under 5 different conditions (ACL-intact knee, ACL-deficient knee, ACL-reconstructed knee by AM portal technique, ACL-reconstructed knee by OI technique, and ACL-reconstructed knee by TT technique). Results Under anterior tibial load, no significant difference was observed between the 3 reconstructions in terms of restoring anterior tibial translation (P > .05). However, none of the 3 ACL reconstruction techniques could completely restore the normal anterior tibial translations (P <.05). Under combined tibial torques, both AM portal and OI techniques closely restored the normal knee anterior tibial translation (P > .05) at 0Â° of flexion but could not do so at 30Â° of flexion (P <.05). The ACL reconstruction by the TT technique was unable to restore normal anterior tibial translations at both 0Â° and 30Â° of flexion under combined tibial torques (P <.05). Forces experienced by the ACL grafts in the 3 reconstruction techniques were lower than those experienced by normal ACL under both the loading conditions\n\nPosteromedial Meniscocapsular Lesions Increase Tibiofemoral Joint Laxity With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Deficiency, and Their Repair Reduces Laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nStephen, Joanna M; Halewood, Camilla; Kittl, Christoph; Bollen, Steve R; Williams, Andy; Amis, Andrew A\n\n2016-02-01\n\nInjury to the posteromedial meniscocapsular junction has been identified after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture; however, there is a lack of objective evidence investigating how this affects knee kinematics or whether increased laxity can be restored by repair. Such injury is often overlooked at surgery, with possible compromise to results. (1) Sectioning the posteromedial meniscocapsular junction in an ACL-deficient knee will result in increased anterior tibial translation and rotation. (2) Isolated ACL reconstruction in the presence of a posteromedial meniscocapsular junction lesion will not restore intact knee laxity. (3) Repair of the posteromedial capsule at the time of ACL reconstruction will reduce tibial translation and rotation to normal. (4) These changes will be clinically detectable. Controlled laboratory study. Nine cadaveric knees were mounted in a test rig where knee kinematics were recorded from 0Â° to 100Â° of flexion by use of an optical tracking system. Measurements were recorded with the following loads: 90-N anterior-posterior tibial forces, 5-NÂ·m internal-external tibial rotation torques, and combined 90-N anterior force and 5-NÂ·m external rotation torque. Manual Rolimeter readings of anterior translation were taken at 30Â° and 90Â°. The knees were tested in the following conditions: intact, ACL deficient, ACL deficient and posteromedial meniscocapsular junction sectioned, ACL deficient and posteromedial meniscocapsular junction repaired, ACL patellar tendon reconstruction with posteromedial meniscocapsular junction repair, and ACL reconstructed and capsular lesion re-created. Statistical analysis used repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc paired t tests with Bonferroni correction. Tibial anterior translation and external rotation were both significantly increased compared with the ACL-deficient knee after posterior meniscocapsular sectioning (P < .05). These parameters were restored after ACL reconstruction and\n\nThe Influence of Meniscal and Anterolateral Capsular Injury on Knee Laxity in Patients With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusahl, Volker; Rahnemai-Azar, Ata A; Costello, Joanna; Arner, Justin W; Fu, Freddie H; Hoshino, Yuichi; Lopomo, Nicola; Samuelsson, Kristian; Irrgang, James J\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe role of the anterolateral capsule (ALC) as a secondary restraint to quantitative rotatory laxity of patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is currently debated. The purpose was to determine the influence of concomitant ALC injuries as well as injuries to other soft tissue structures on rotatory knee laxity in patients with an ACL injury. It was hypothesized that a concomitant ALC injury would be associated with increased rotatory knee laxity as measured during a quantitative pivot-shift test. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Forty-one patients with an ACL injury (average age, 23 Â± 6.9 years) were enrolled. Two blinded musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for the presence of ACL injuries and concomitant soft tissue injuries including the ALC, medial collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament, posterolateral corner, medial meniscus, and lateral meniscus. A standardized pivot-shift test was performed under anesthesia, and rotatory laxity was quantified according to anterior translation of the lateral tibial compartment during the pivot-shift maneuver. The Student t test was used to analyze the data. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. A complete ACL rupture was confirmed in all of the patients. MRI evidence of an ALC injury was observed in 21 (51%) of the patients. Patients with MRI evidence of an ALC injury had significantly higher rotatory knee laxity (3.6 Â± 1.5 mm) compared with those without an ALC injury (2.7 Â± 1.5 mm; P = .04). Lateral and medial meniscus injuries were detected in 17 (41%) and 19 (46%) patients, respectively. Patients with MRI evidence of either a medial meniscus injury or lateral meniscus injury had significantly higher rotatory knee laxity compared with patients without these injuries (medial meniscus: 3.7 Â± 1.4 mm vs 2.7 Â± 1.6 mm, respectively; lateral meniscus: 3.7 Â± 1.7 mm vs 2.7 Â± 1.3 mm, respectively) (P = .03 for both). MRI evidence of a\n\nSide-to-side asymmetries in landing mechanics from a drop vertical jump test are not related to asymmetries in knee joint laxity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeyer, Christophe A G; Gette, Paul; Mouton, Caroline; Seil, Romain; Theisen, Daniel\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAsymmetries in knee joint biomechanics and increased knee joint laxity in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are considered risk factors for re-tear or early onset of osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, the relationship between these factors has not been established. The aim of the study was to compare knee mechanics during landing from a bilateral drop vertical jump in patients following ACLR and control participants and to study the relationship between side-to-side asymmetries in landing mechanics and knee joint laxity. Seventeen patients following ACLR were evaluated and compared to 28 healthy controls. Knee sagittal and frontal plane kinematics and kinetics were evaluated using three-dimensional motion capture (200Â Hz) and two synchronized force platforms (1000Â Hz). Static anterior and internal rotation knee laxities were measured for both groups and legs using dedicated arthrometers. Group and leg differences were investigated using a mixed model analysis of variance. The relationship between side-to-side differences in sagittal knee power/energy absorption and knee joint laxities was evaluated using univariate linear regression. A significant group-by-leg interaction (pÂ =Â 0.010) was found for knee sagittal plane energy absorption, with patients having 25% lower values in their involved compared to their non-involved leg (1.22Â Â±Â 0.39 vs. 1.62Â Â±Â 0.40Â JÂ kg -1 ). Furthermore, knee sagittal plane energy absorption was 18% lower at their involved leg compared to controls (pÂ =Â 0.018). Concomitantly, patients demonstrated a 27% higher anterior laxity of the involved knee compared to the non-involved knee, with an average side-to-side difference of 1.2Â mm (pÂ <Â 0.001). Laxity of the involved knee was also 30% higher than that of controls (pÂ <Â 0.001) (leg-by-group interaction: pÂ =Â 0.002). No relationship was found between sagittal plane energy absorption and knee laxity. Nine months following surgery, ACLR patients were\n\nThe Effects of Generalized Joint Laxity on Risk of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Young Female Athletes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMyer, Gregory D.; Ford, Kevin R.; Paterno, Mark V.; Nick, Todd G.; Hewett, Timothy E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Women who participate in high-risk sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament injury at a 4- to 6-fold greater rate than men. Purpose To prospectively determine if female athletes with decreased passive knee joint restraint (greater joint laxity) and greater side-to-side differences in knee laxity would be at increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Study Design Case control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods From 1558 female soccer and basketball players who were prospectively screened, 19 went on to tear their anterior cruciate ligaments. Four height- and mass-matched control subjects were selected from the uninjured screened athletes for comparison with each of the 19 injured subjects, making a total of 95 subjects (19 injured; 76 uninjured). Generalized joint-laxity tests and anterior-posterior tibiofemoral translation were quantified using the CompuKT knee arthrometer. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to determine predictors of anterior cruciate ligament injury status from recorded laxity measures. Results A multivariable logistic regression model (chi-square = 18.6; P = .002) used the independent variables laxity measures of knee hyperextension (P = .02), wrist and thumb to forearm opposition (P = .80), fifth-finger hyperextension >90Â° (P = .71), side-to-side differences in anterior-posterior tibiofemoral translation (P = .002), and prior knee injury (P = .22) to predict anterior cruciate ligamentâinjury status. The validated C statistic, or validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.72. For every 1.3-mm increase in side-to-side differences in anterior-posterior knee displacement, the odds of anterior cruciate ligamentâinjured status increased 4-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.68â9.69). A positive measure of knee hyperextension increased the odds of anterior cruciate ligamentâinjured status 5-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.24â18.44). Conclusion The current results\n\nJump-Landing Biomechanics and Knee-Laxity Change Across the Menstrual Cycle in Women With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBell, David R.; Blackburn, J. Troy; Hackney, Anthony C.; Marshall, Stephen W.; Beutler, Anthony I.; Padua, Darin A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nContext: Of the individuals able to return to sport participation after an anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) injury, up to 25% will experience a second ACL injury. This population may be more sensitive to hormonal fluctuations, which may explain this high rate of second injury. Objective: To examine changes in 3-dimensional hip and knee kinematics and kinetics during a jump landing and to examine knee laxity across the menstrual cycle in women with histories of unilateral noncontact ACL injury. Design âControlled laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 20 women (age = 19.6 Â± 1.3 years, height = 168.6 Â± 5.3 cm, mass = 66.2 Â± 9.1 kg) with unilateral, noncontact ACL injuries. Intervention(s) Participants completed a jump-landing task and knee-laxity assessment 3 to 5 days after the onset of menses and within 3 days of a positive ovulation test. Main Outcome Measure(s): Kinematics in the uninjured limb at initial contact with the ground during a jump landing, peak kinematics and kinetics during the loading phase of landing, anterior knee laxity via the KT-1000, peak vertical ground reaction force, and blood hormone concentrations (estradiol-Î²-17, progesterone, free testosterone). Results: At ovulation, estradiol-Î²-17 (t = â2.9, P = .009), progesterone (t = â3.4, P = .003), and anterior knee laxity (t = â2.3, P = .03) increased, and participants presented with greater knee-valgus moment (Z = â2.6, P = .01) and femoral internal rotation (t = â2.1, P = .047). However, during the menses test session, participants landed harder (greater peak vertical ground reaction force; t = 2.2, P = .04), with the tibia internally rotated at initial contact (t = 2.8, P = .01) and greater hip internal-rotation moment (Z = â2.4, P = .02). No other changes were observed across the menstrual cycle. Conclusions Knee and hip mechanics in both phases of the menstrual cycle represented a greater potential risk of ACL loading. Observed\n\nMeasurement of varus-valgus and internal-external rotational knee laxities in vivo--Part II: relationship with anterior-posterior and general joint laxity in males and females.\n\nPubMed\n\nShultz, Sandra J; Shimokochi, Yohei; Nguyen, Anh-Dung; Schmitz, Randy J; Beynnon, Bruce D; Perrin, David H\n\n2007-08-01\n\nWe examined sex differences in general joint laxity (GJL), and anterior-posterior displacement (ANT-POST), varus-valgus rotation (VR-VL), and internal-external rotation (INT-EXT) knee laxities, and determined whether greater ANT and GJL predicted greater VR-VL and INT-EXT. Twenty subjects were measured for GJL, and scored on a scale of 0-9. ANT and POST were measured using a standard knee arthrometer at 133 N. VR-VL and INT-EXT were measured using a custom joint laxity testing device, defined as the angular displacements (deg) of the tibia relative to the femur produced by 0-10 Nm of varus-valgus torques, and 0-5 Nm of internal-external torques, respectively. INT-EXT were measured during both non-weight-bearing (NWB) and weight-bearing (WB = 40% body weight) conditions while VR-VL were measured NWB. All laxity measures were greater for females compared to males except for POST. ANT and GJL positively predicted 62.5% of the variance in VR-VL and 41.8% of the variance in WB INT-EXT. ANT was the sole predictor of INT-EXT in NWB, explaining 42.3% of the variance. These findings suggest that subjects who score higher on clinical measures of GJL and ANT are also likely to have greater VR-VL and INT-EXT knee laxities.\n\nAssessment of the midflexion rotational laxity in posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nHino, Kazunori; Kutsuna, Tatsuhiko; Oonishi, Yoshio; Watamori, Kunihiko; Kiyomatsu, Hiroshi; Iseki, Yasutake; Watanabe, Seiji; Ishimaru, Yasumitsu; Miura, Hiromasa\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo evaluate changes in midflexion rotational laxity before and after posterior-stabilized (PS)-total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Twenty-nine knees that underwent PS-TKA were evaluated. Manual mild passive rotational stress was applied to the knees, and the internal-external rotational angle was measured automatically by a navigation system at 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â° of knee flexion. The post-operative internal rotational laxity was statistically significantly increased compared to the preoperative level at 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â° of flexion. The post-operative external rotational laxity was statistically significantly decreased compared to the preoperative level at 45Â° and 60Â° of flexion. The post-operative internal-external rotational laxity was statistically significantly increased compared to the preoperative level only at 30Â° of flexion. The preoperative and post-operative rotational laxity showed a significant correlation at 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â° of flexion. Internal-external rotational laxity increases at the initial flexion range due to resection of both the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments and retention of the collateral ligaments in PS-TKA. Preoperative and post-operative rotational laxity indicated a significant correlation at the midflexion range. This study showed that a large preoperative rotational laxity increased the risk of a large post-operative laxity, especially at the initial flexion range in PS-TKA. III.\n\nHigher anterior knee laxity influences the landing biomechanics displayed by pubescent girls.\n\nPubMed\n\nWild, Catherine Y; Munro, Bridget J; Steele, Julie R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDespite an increase in anterior knee laxity (AKL) during the adolescent growth spurt in girls, it is unknown whether landing biomechanics are affected by this change. This study investigated whether pubescent girls with higher AKL displayed differences in their lower limb strength or landing biomechanics when performing a horizontal leap movement compared to girls with lower AKL. Forty-six pubescent girls (10-13Â years) were tested at the time of their peak height velocity (PHV). Passive AKL was quantified and used to classify participants into higher (HAKL; peak displacementÂ >Â 4Â mm) and lower (LAKL; peak displacementÂ <Â 3Â mm) AKL groups (nÂ =Â 15/group). Three-dimensional kinematics, ground reaction forces (GRF) and muscle activation patterns were assessed during a horizontal leap landing. HAKL participants displayed significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) reduced hip abduction, increased hip abduction moments, as well as earlier hamstring muscle and later tibialis anterior activation compared to LAKL participants. Girls with HAKL displayed compensatory landing biomechanics, which are suggested to assist the functional stability of their knees during this dynamic task.

A total of 30 male (age = 20.3 Â± 2.0 years, height = 1.79 Â± 0.05 m, mass = 75.2 Â± 7.2 kg) and 29 female (age = 20.5 Â± 2.3 years, height = 1.67 Â± 0.08 m, mass = 61.8 Â± 9.0 kg) competitive athletes. A 90-minute intermittent exercise protocol (IEP) designed to simulate the physiologic and biomechanical demands of a soccer match. We measured SPTIME, APLAX, and landing biomechanics before and after warm-up, every 15 minutes during the IEP, and every 15 minutes for 1 hour after the IEP. We measured VVLAX and IERLAX before and after the warm-up, at 45 and 90 minutes during the IEP, and at 30 minutes after the IEP. We used hierarchical linear modeling to examine associations between exercise-related changes in SPTIME and knee laxity with exercise-related changes in landing biomechanics while controlling for initial (before warm-up) knee laxity. We found that SPTIME had a more global effect on landing biomechanics in women than in men, resulting in a more upright landing and a reduction in landing forces and out-of-plane motions about the knee. As APLAX increased with exercise, women increased their knee internal-rotation motion (P = .02), and men increased their hip-flexion motion and energy-absorption (P = .006) and knee-extensor loads (P = .04).

Despite the frequent clinical use of knee arthrometry in the evaluation of knee laxity, little data exist to correlate instrumented laxity measures and ACL strain during dynamic high-risk activities. Purpose/Hypotheses The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships between ACL strain and anterior knee laxity measurements using arthrometry during both a drawer test and simulated bipedal landing (as an identified high-risk injurious task). We hypothesized that a high correlation exists between dynamic ACL strain and passive arthrometry displacement. The secondary hypothesis was that anterior knee laxity quantified by knee arthrometry is a valid predictor of injury risk such that specimens with greater anterior knee laxity would demonstrate increased levels of peak ACL strain during landing. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Twenty cadaveric lower limbs (mean age, 46 Â± 6 years; 10 female and 10 male) were tested using a CompuKT knee arthrometer to measure knee joint laxity. Each specimen was tested under 4 continuous cycles of anterior-posterior shear force (Â±134 N) applied to the tibial tubercle. To quantify ACL strain, a differential variable reluctance transducer (DVRT) was arthroscopically placed on the ACL (anteromedial bundle), and specimens were retested. Subsequently, bipedal landing from 30 cm was simulated in a subset of 14 specimens (mean age, 45 Â± 6 years; 6 female and 8 male) using a novel custom-designed drop stand. Changes in joint laxity and ACL strain under applied anterior shear force were statistically analyzed using paired sample t tests and analysis of variance. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between anterior shear force, anterior tibial translation, and ACL strain. Results During simulated drawer tests, 134 N\n\nValidation of a computational knee joint model using an alignment method for the knee laxity test and computed tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Kyoung-Tak; Kim, Sung-Hwan; Son, Juhyun; Lee, Young Han; Koh, Yong-Gon\n\n2017-01-01\n\nComputational models have been identified as efficient techniques in the clinical decision-making process. However, computational model was validated using published data in most previous studies, and the kinematic validation of such models still remains a challenge. Recently, studies using medical imaging have provided a more accurate visualization of knee joint kinematics. The purpose of the present study was to perform kinematic validation for the subject-specific computational knee joint model by comparison with subject's medical imaging under identical laxity condition. The laxity test was applied to the anterior-posterior drawer under 90Â° flexion and the varus-valgus under 20Â° flexion with a series of stress radiographs, a Telos device, and computed tomography. The loading condition in the computational subject-specific knee joint model was identical to the laxity test condition in the medical image. Our computational model showed knee laxity kinematic trends that were consistent with the computed tomography images, except for negligible differences because of the indirect application of the subject's in vivo material properties. Medical imaging based on computed tomography with the laxity test allowed us to measure not only the precise translation but also the rotation of the knee joint. This methodology will be beneficial in the validation of laxity tests for subject- or patient-specific computational models.\n\nExamining Ankle-Joint Laxity Using 2 Knee Positions and With Simulated Muscle Guarding.\n\nPubMed\n\nHanlon, Shawn; Caccese, Jaclyn; Knight, Christopher A; Swanik, Charles Buz; Kaminski, Thomas W\n\n2016-02-01\n\nSeveral factors affect the reliability of the anterior drawer and talar tilt tests, including the individual clinician's experience and skill, ankle and knee positioning, and muscle guarding. To compare gastrocnemius activity during the measurement of ankle-complex motion at different knee positions, and secondarily, to compare ankle-complex motion during a simulated trial of muscle guarding. Cross-sectional study. Research laboratory. Thirty-three participants aged 20.2 Â± 1.7 years were tested. The ankle was loaded under 2 test conditions (relaxed, simulated muscle guarding) at 2 knee positions (0Â°, 90Â° of flexion) while gastrocnemius electromyography (EMG) activity was recorded. Anterior displacement (mm), inversion-eversion motion (Â°), and peak EMG amplitude values of the gastrocnemius (Î¼V). Anterior displacement did not differ between the positions of 0Â° and 90Â° of knee flexion (P = .193). Inversion-eversion motion was greater at 0Â° of knee flexion compared with 90Â° (P < .001). Additionally, peak EMG amplitude of the gastrocnemius was not different between 0Â° and 90Â° of knee flexion during anterior displacement (P = .101). As expected, the simulated muscle-guarding trial reduced anterior displacement compared with the relaxed condition (0Â° of knee flexion, P = .008; 90Â° of knee flexion, P = .016) and reduced inversion-eversion motion (0Â° of knee flexion, P = .03; 90Â° of knee flexion, P < .001). In a relaxed state, the gastrocnemius muscle did not appear to affect anterior ankle laxity at the 2 most common knee positions for anterior drawer testing; however, talar tilt testing may be best performed with the knee in 0Â° of knee flexion. Finally, our outcomes from the simulated muscle-guarding condition suggest that clinicians should use caution and be aware of reduced perceived laxity when performing these clinical examination techniques immediately postinjury.\n\nStandardising the clinical assessment of coronal knee laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nClarke, Jon V; Wilson, William T; Wearing, Scott C; Picard, Frederic; Riches, Philip E; Deakin, Angela H\n\n2012-09-01\n\nClinical laxity tests are used for assessing knee ligament injuries and for soft tissue balancing in total knee arthroplasty. This study reports the development and validation of a quantitative technique of assessing collateral knee laxity through accurate measurement of potential variables during routine clinical examination. The hypothesis was that standardisation of a clinical stress test would result in a repeatable range of laxity measurements. Non-invasive infrared tracking technology with kinematic registration of joint centres gave real-time measurement of both coronal and sagittal mechanical tibiofemoral alignment Knee flexion, moment arm and magnitude of the applied force were all measured and standardised. Three clinicians then performed six knee laxity examinations on a single volunteer using a target moment of 18 Nm. Standardised laxity measurements had small standard deviations (within 1. 1 degree) for each clinician and similar mean values between clinicians, with the valgus laxity assessment (mean of 3 degrees) being slightly more consistent than varus (means of 4 degrees or 5 degrees). The manual technique of coronal knee laxity assessment was successfully quantified and standardised, leading to a narrow range of measurements (within the accuracy of the measurement system). Minimising the subjective variables of clinical examination could improve current knowledge of soft tissue knee behaviour.\n\nKnee-laxity measurements examined by a left-hand- and a right-hand-dominant physiotherapist, in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries and healthy controls.\n\nPubMed\n\nSernert, Ninni; Helmers, Janett; Kartus, Catarina; Ejerhed, Lars; Kartus, JÃ¼ri\n\n2007-10-01\n\nThe purpose of the study was to analyse and compare KT-1000 knee laxity as examined by a left-hand- and a right-hand-dominant physiotherapist in a group of patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and a group of patients, 2 years after ACL reconstruction. The other aim was to measure and analyse knee laxity in a group of persons without any known knee problems. A cross-sectional examination of two groups of patients pre-operatively and post-operatively after ACL reconstruction and examination of healthy controls on two different occasions was performed. Fifty-three patients who were scheduled for ACL reconstruction and 39 patients who attended a 2-year follow-up examination were included in the study. In the ACL-deficient group, 32 patients had a right-sided ACL injury and 21 patients a left-sided ACL injury. The corresponding figures in the post-operative group were 21 patients with a right-sided ACL injury and 18 patients with a left-sided ACL injury. Twenty-eight healthy persons without any known knee problems served as controls. One left-hand- and one right-hand-dominant experienced physiotherapist performed all the examinations. To be able to evaluate the intra and inter-reliability of the examiners the controls were examined at two occasions. The left-hand-dominant physiotherapist measured significantly higher absolute laxity values in the left knee, both injured and non-injured ones, compared with the right-hand-dominant physiotherapist. This was found irrespectively of whether the patients belonged to the ACL deficient or the post-operative group. In the healthy control group, the right-hand-dominant physiotherapist measured significantly higher knee-laxity values in the right knee compared with the left-hand-dominant physiotherapist. Correspondingly, the left-hand-dominant physiotherapist measured significantly higher knee laxity values in the left knee. We conclude that KT-1000 arthrometer laxity measurements can be affected by the hand\n\nAssociations between lower extremity muscle mass and multiplanar knee laxity and stiffness: a potential explanation for sex differences in frontal and transverse plane knee laxity.\n\nPubMed\n\nShultz, Sandra J; Pye, Michele L; Montgomery, Melissa M; Schmitz, Randy J\n\n2012-12-01\n\nCompared with men, women have disproportionally greater frontal (varus-valgus) and transverse (internal-external) plane laxity and lower stiffness, despite having similar sagittal (anterior-posterior) plane laxity and stiffness. While the underlying cause is unclear, the amount of lower extremity lean mass (LELM) may be a contributing factor. Lower extremity lean mass would be a stronger predictor of frontal and transverse plane laxity and incremental stiffness than the sagittal plane. Associations between LELM and stiffness would be stronger at lower force increments. Descriptive laboratory study. Sixty-three women and 30 men with no history of ligament injury were measured for knee laxity and incremental stiffness in the sagittal (-90- to 130-N posterior-to-anterior directed loads), frontal (Â±10-NÂ·m varus-valgus torques), and transverse (Â±5-NÂ·m internal-external rotation torques) planes and underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to measure LELM. Linear regressions examined the extent to which LELM predicted each laxity and stiffness value, while also accounting for a person's sex. Females (vs males) had greater laxity and less stiffness in the frontal and transverse planes but not the sagittal plane. Lower extremity lean mass was a poor predictor of sagittal laxity and stiffness (R (2) range = .021-.081; P > .06) but was a stronger predictor of frontal (R (2) range = .215-.567; P < .01) and transverse (R (2) range = .224-.356; P < .01) plane laxity and stiffness. Associations were stronger for low (R (2) = .495-.504) versus high (R (2) = .215-.435) frontal plane stiffness but were similar for low (R (2) = .233-.293) versus high (R (2) = .224-.356) transverse plane stiffness. Once we accounted for a person's LELM, sex had little effect on laxity and stiffness (change in R (2) after removal = .01-.08; P = .027-.797). Less LELM was associated with greater laxity and less stiffness in frontal and transverse planes, which may contribute to the\n\nExamining Ankle-Joint Laxity Using 2 Knee Positions and With Simulated Muscle Guarding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHanlon, Shawn; Caccese, Jaclyn; Knight, Christopher A.; Swanik, Charles âBuzâ; Kaminski, Thomas W.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nContext:â Several factors affect the reliability of the anterior drawer and talar tilt tests, including the individual clinician's experience and skill, ankle and knee positioning, and muscle guarding.

To investigate the effect of different loads of OKCKE resistance training on anterior knee laxity (AKL) in the uninjured knee. non-clinical trial. Randomization into one of three supervised training groups occurred with training 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH groups performed OKCKE resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets of 2RM, respectively. Subjects in the isokinetic training group (ISOK) performed isokinetic OKCKE resistance training using 2 sets of 20 maximal efforts. AKL was measured using the KT2000 arthrometer with concurrent measurement of lateral hamstrings muscle activity at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Twenty six subjects participated (LOW nÂ =Â 9, HIGH nÂ =Â 10, ISOK nÂ =Â 7). The main finding from this study is that a 12-week OKCKE resistance training programme at loads of 20 sets of 2RM, leads to an increase in manual maximal AKL. OKCKE resistance training at high loads (20 sets of 2RM) increases AKL while low load OKCKE resistance training (2 sets of 20RM) and isokinetic OKCKE resistance training at 2 sets of 20RM does not.

Methods: Sixty male subjects were enrolled and subdivided into three groups: Twenty subjects without knee injuries (GC group) and two groups of 20 subjects submitted to ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon (GTP group) and hamstrings autograft (GTF group). Results: The results showed significant correlation between knee extensors peak torque and performance in the hop tests for GTF and GC groups. There are no significantly correlations between post op knee laxity and Lysholm score compared with the hop tests and peak torque deficits. Concerning the differences between groups, the GTP group showed greater peak torque deficits in knee extensors, worst Lysholm scores and higher percentage of individuals with lower limb symmetry index (ISM) < 90% in both hop tests when compared to the other two groups. Conclusion: It is not recommendable to use only one measurement instrument for the functional evaluation of ACL-reconstructed patients, because significant correlation between peak torque, subject's functional score, knee laxity and hop tests were not observed in all groups.

The data collected were then compared to the results obtained from manual clinical examination. Two human cadavers were studied. A medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear was simulated in the left knee of cadaver 1, and a posterolateral corner (PLC) injury was simulated in the right knee of cadaver 2. Contralateral knees were left intact. Five blinded examiners carried out manual clinical examination on the knees. Laxity grades and a diagnosis were recorded. Using a robotic knee device which can measure knee laxity in three planes of motion: anterior-posterior, internal-external tibia rotation, and varus-valgus, quantitative data were obtained to document tibial motion relative to the femur. One of the five examiners correctly diagnosed the MCL injury. Robotic testing showed a 1.7Â° larger valgus angle, 3Â° greater tibial internal rotation, and lower endpoint stiffness (11.1 vs. 24.6 Nm/Â°) in the MCL-injured knee during varus-valgus testing when compared to the intact knee and 4.9Â mm greater medial tibial translation during rotational testing. Two of the five examiners correctly diagnosed the PLC injury, while the other examiners diagnosed an MCL tear. The PLC-injured knee demonstrated 4.1Â mm more lateral tibial translation and 2.2Â mm more posterior tibial translation during varus-valgus testing when compared to the intact knee. The robotic testing device was able to provide objective numerical data that reflected differences between the injured knees and the uninjured knees in both cadavers. The examiners that performed the manual clinical examination on the cadaver knees proved to be poor at diagnosing the injuries. Robotic testing could act as an adjunct to the manual clinical examination by supplying numbers that could improve diagnosis of knee injury.

[Subjects and Methods] The study subjects consisted of 90 community-dwelling elderly people aged more than 60â years (22 males, 68 females). Femorotibial angle alignment, knee joint laxity, knee extensors and flexor muscle strengths were measured in all subjects. In addition, the subjects were divided into four groups based on the presence of laxity and knee joint deformation, and the muscle strength values were compared. [Results] There was no significant difference in knee extensor muscle strength among the four groups. However, there was significant weakness of the knee flexor muscle in the group with deformation and laxity was compared with the group without deformation and laxity. [Conclusion] Decreased knee flexor muscle strengths may be involved in knee joint deformation. The importance of muscle strength balance was also considered.\n\nNative Knee Laxities at 0Â°, 45Â°, and 90Â° of Flexion and Their Relationship to the Goal of the Gap-Balancing Alignment Method of Total Knee Arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoth, Joshua D; Howell, Stephen M; Hull, Maury L\n\n2015-10-21\n\nGap-balancing is an alignment method for total knee arthroplasty with the goal of creating uniform tension in the periarticular soft-tissue restraints and equal laxities throughout the arc of flexion. However, there is little evidence that achieving equal laxities prevents either overly tight or overly loose soft-tissue restraints after total knee arthroplasty. Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether the laxities at 0Â°, 45Â°, and 90Â° of flexion are equal in the native knee. Seven different laxities were measured at 0Â°, 45Â°, and 90Â° of flexion in ten fresh-frozen native cadaveric knees (with intact menisci, cartilage, and ligaments) by applying loads of Â±5 Nm in varus-valgus rotation, Â±3 Nm in internal-external rotation, 100 N in distraction, and Â±45 N in anterior-posterior translation with use of a six-degrees-of-freedom load application system. The mean laxities (and standard deviations) at 45Â° of flexion were 1.7Â° Â± 0.6Â° greater in varus, 0.9Â° Â± 0.4Â° greater in valgus, 10.2Â° Â± 2.7Â° greater in internal rotation, 10.1Â° Â± 2.0Â° greater in external rotation, 1.7 Â± 1.0 mm greater in distraction translation, and 3.3 Â± 1.5 mm greater in anterior translation than those at 0Â° of flexion. The mean laxities at 90Â° of flexion were 2.5Â° Â± 0.8Â° greater in varus, 1.0Â° Â± 0.5Â° greater in valgus, 10.0Â° Â± 4.6Â° greater in internal rotation, 10.1Â° Â± 4.5Â° greater in external rotation, 1.8 Â± 0.7 mm greater in distraction, and 1.6 Â± 1.2 mm greater in anterior translation than those at 0Â° of flexion. The mean anterior translation at 90Â° of flexion was 1.7 Â± 0.9 mm less than that at 45Â° of flexion. Because five of the seven laxities were at least 1.7Â° or 1.6 mm greater at both 45Â° and 90Â° of flexion than those at 0Â° of flexion, the laxities of the native knee measured in this study are unequal at these flexion angles and therefore do not support the goal of gap-balancing in total knee arthroplasty.

Traditional quantitative values have been challenged. Methods used to measure these are also not without flaws. Authors review the recent literature and a novel method of measurement of these values has been included. This method includes use of computer navigation technique in clinic setting for assessment of the normal or affected knee before the surgery. Computer navigation has been known for achievement of alignment accuracy during knee surgery. Now its use in clinic setting has added to the inventory of measurement methods. Authors dispel the common myth of straight mechanical axis in normal knees and also look at quantification of amount of collateral knee laxity. Based on the scientific studies, it has been shown that the mean alignment is in varus in normal knees. It changes from lying non-weight-bearing position to standing weight-bearing position in both coronal and the sagittal planes. It also varies with gender and race. The collateral laxity is also different for males and females. Further studies are needed to define the ideal alignment and collateral laxity which the surgeon should aim for individual knees.

There is consensus among orthopedic surgeons that good outcome in Total Knee Arthroplasty requires equal tension in the medial/lateral compartment of the knee joint, as well as equal tension in the flexion/extension gap. The purpose of this study was to quantify the ligament laxity in the normal non-arthritic knee before and after Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty. We hypothesized that the Medial/Lateral Collateral Ligament shows minimal changes in length when measured directly by extensometers in the native human knee during varus/valgus laxity testing. We also hypothesized that due to differences in material properties and surface geometry, native laxity is difficult to reconstruct using a Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee. Six specimens were used to perform this in vitro cadaver test using extensometers to provide numerical values for laxity and varus-valgus tilting in the frontal plane. This study enabled a precise measurement of varus-valgus laxity as compared with the clinical assessment. The strains in both ligaments in the replaced knee were different from those in the native knee. Both ligaments were stretched in extension, in flexion the Medial Collateral Ligament tends to relax and the Lateral Collateral Ligament remains tight. As material properties and surface geometry of the replaced knee add stiffness to the joint, we recommend to avoid overstuffing the joint, when using this type of Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty, in order to obtain varus/valgus laxity close to the native joint.

Studies have shown that the stability increases when compressive loads are applied, as indicated by reduced laxity, but the mechanism has not been fully explained. A test rig was designed which applied combinations of AP shear and compressive forces, and measured the AP displacements relative to the neutral position. Five knees were evaluated at compressive loads of 0, 250, 500, and 750N, with the knee at 15Â° flexion. At each load, three cycles of shear force at Â±100N were applied. For the intact knee under load, the posterior tibial displacement was close to zero, due to the upward slope of the anterior medial tibial surface. The soft tissues were then resected in sequence to determine their role in AP laxity. After anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) resection, the anterior tibial displacement increased significantly even under load, highlighting its importance in stability. Meniscal resection further increased displacement but also the vertical displacement increased, implying the meniscus was providing a buffering effect. The PCL had no effect on any of the displacements under load. Plowing cartilage deformation and surface friction were negligible. This work highlighted the particular importance of the upward slope of the anterior medial tibial surface and the ACL to AP knee stability under load. The results are relevant to the design of total knees which reproduce anatomic knee stability behavior. Copyright Â© 2017.

Little is known about knee laxity and stiffness prior to knee OA onset. We investigated knee joint angular laxity and passive stiffness in meniscectomized patients at high risk of knee OA compared with healthy controls. Sixty patients meniscectomized for a medial meniscal tear (52 men, 41.4 Â± 5.5 years, 175.3 Â± 7.9 cm, 83.6 Â± 12.8 kg, mean Â± SD) and 21 healthy controls (18 men, 42.0 Â± 6.7 years, 176.8 Â± 5.7 cm, 77.8 Â± 13.4 kg) had their knee joint angular laxity and passive stiffness assessed twice ~2.3 years apart. Linear regression models including age, sex, height and body mass as covariates in the adjusted model were used to assess differences between groups. Greater knee joint varus (-10.1 vs. -7.3Â°, p<0.001), valgus (7.1 vs. 5.6Â°, p=0.001) and total (17.2 vs. 12.9Â°, p<0.001) angular laxity together with reduced midrange passive stiffness (1.71 vs. 2.36 Nm/Â°, p<0.001) were observed in patients vs. healthy controls. No differences were observed in change in stiffness over time between patients and controls, however a tendency towards increased laxity in patients was seen. Meniscectomized patients showed increased knee joint angular laxity and reduced passive stiffness ~3 months post surgery compared with controls. In addition, the results indicated that knee joint laxity may increase over time in meniscectomized patients. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fourteen human cadaveric knee specimens were used in this study, and a robotic manipulator with six-axis force/torque sensor was used to test the joint laxity in anterior-posterior translation, valgus-varus, and internal-external rotation. The results show the knee joint stability after bicruciate-retaining BKA is similar to that of the native knee. On the other hand, the PCL-retaining TKA results in inferior joint stability in valgus, varus, external rotation, anterior and, surprisingly, posterior directions. Our findings suggest that, provided functional ligamentous structures, bicruciate-retaining BKA is a biomechanically attractive treatment for joint degenerative disease.

The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between lateral compartment acceleration and translation during pivot shift testing. It was hypothesized that a correlation would exist in ACL-injured and uninjured knees, irrespective of sex, but would be greatest in knees with combined ACL and lateral meniscus tear. Seventy-seven patients (34 females, 25.2âÂ±â9.0Â years) undergoing primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction were prospectively enrolled in a 2-year study across four international centers. Patients underwent preoperative examination under anesthesia of the injured and uninjured knee using Image Analysis software and surface mounted accelerometer. A moderate correlation between lateral compartment acceleration and translation was observed in ACL-injured knees [Ïâ=â0.36, pâ<â0.05), but not in uninjured knees (Ïâ=â0.17, not significant (n.s.)]. A moderate correlation between acceleration and translation was demonstrated in ACL-injured knees with lateral meniscus tears (Ïâ=â0.53, pâ<â0.05), but not in knees with isolated ACL-injury (Ïâ=â0.32, n.s.), ACL and medial meniscus tears (Ïâ=â0.14, n.s.), or ACL and combined medial and lateral meniscus tears (Ïâ=â0.40, n.s.). A moderate correlation between acceleration and translation was seen in males (Ïâ=â0.51, pâ<â0.05), but not in females (Ïâ=â0.21, n.s.). Largest correlations were observed in males with ACL and lateral meniscus tears (Ïâ=â0.75, pâ<â0.05). Lateral compartment acceleration and translation were moderately correlated in ACL-injured knees, but largely correlated in males with combined ACL and lateral meniscus tears. ACL and lateral meniscus injury in males might, therefore, be suspected when both lateral compartment acceleration\n\nThe effect of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training in the ACL-injured knee.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarcellona, Massimo G; Morrissey, Matthew C; Milligan, Peter; Clinton, Melissa; Amis, Andrew A\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of different loads of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training on anterior knee laxity and function in the ACL-injured (ACLI) knee. Fifty-eight ACLI subjects were randomised to one of three (12-week duration) training groups. The STAND group trained according to a standardised rehabilitation protocol. Subjects in the LOW and HIGH group trained as did the STAND group but with the addition of seated knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20 repetition maximum (RM) and 20 sets of 2RM, respectively. Anterior knee laxity and measurements of physical and subjective function were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Thirty-six subjects were tested at both baseline and 12 weeks (STAND n = 13, LOW n = 11, HIGH n = 12). The LOW group demonstrated a reduction in 133 N anterior knee laxity between baseline and 12 weeks testing when compared to the HIGH and the STAND groups (p = 0.009). Specifically, the trained-untrained knee laxity decreased an average of approximately 5 mm in the LOW group while remaining the same in the other two groups. Twelve weeks of knee extensor open kinetic chain resistance training at loads of 2 sets of 20RM led to a reduction in anterior knee laxity in the ACLI knee. This reduction in laxity does not appear to offer any significant short-term functional advantages when compared to a standard rehabilitation protocol. These results indicate that knee laxity can be decreased with resistance training of the thigh muscles.

However, the majority of previous investigations may not report truly passive joint laxity, as their tests have been performed on conscious participants who could be guarding against motion with muscle contraction during laxity evaluation. The purpose of this study was to investigate how a measure of passive knee laxity, recorded when the participant is under anesthesia, is related to varusâvalgus excursion during gait, clinical measures of performance, perceived instability, and self-reported function in participants with severe knee OA. We assessed passive varusâvalgus knee laxity in 29 participants (30 knees) with severe OA, as they underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Participants also completed gait analysis, clinical assessment of performance (6-min walk (6 MW), stair climbing test (SCT), isometric knee strength), and self-reported measures of function (perceived instability, Knee injury, and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) a median of 18 days before the TKA procedure. We observed that greater passive varusâvalgus laxity was associated with greater varusâvalgus excursion during gait (R2 =0.34, p =0.002). Significant associations were also observed between greater laxity and greater isometric knee extension strength (p =0.014), farther 6 MW distance (p =0.033) and shorter SCT time (p =0.046). No relationship was observed between passive varusâvalgus laxity and isometric knee flexion strength, perceived instability, or any KOOS subscale. The conflicting associations between laxity, frontal excursion during gait, and functional performance suggest a complex relationship between laxity and knee cartilage health, clinical performance, and self-reported function that merits further study.

Isolated knee instability treated with ligament reconstruction and isolated knee malalignment treated with periarticular osteotomy have both been well studied in the past. More recently, the effects of high tibial osteotomy on knee instability have been studied. Lateral closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy tends to reduce the posterior tibial slope, which has a stabilising effect on anterior tibial instability that occurs with ACL deficiency. Medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy tends to increase the posterior tibia slope, which has a stabilising effect in posterior tibial instability that occurs with PCL deficiency. Overall results from recent studies indicate that there is a role for combined ligament reconstruction and periarticular knee osteotomy. The use of high tibial osteotomy has been able to extend the indication for ligament reconstruction which, when combined, may ultimately halt the evolution of arthritis and preserve their natural knee joint for a longer period of time.

A cross-sectional study of 86 patients with OA of the knee was conducted. Tests were performed to determine varus-valgus laxity, muscle strength, and functional ability. Laxity was assessed using a device that measures the angular deviation of the knee in the frontal plane. Muscle strength was measured using a computer-driven isokinetic dynamometer. Functional ability was assessed by observation (100-meter walking test) and self report (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]). Regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of joint laxity on the relationship between muscle strength and functional ability. In regression analyses, the interaction between muscle strength and joint laxity contributed to the variance in both walking time (P = 0.002) and WOMAC score (P = 0.080). The slope of the regression lines indicated that the relationship between muscle strength and functional ability (walking time, WOMAC) was stronger in patients with high knee joint laxity. Patients with knee OA and high knee joint laxity show a stronger relationship between muscle strength and functional ability than patients with OA and low knee joint laxity. Patients with OA, high knee joint laxity, and low muscle strength are most at risk of being disabled.\n\nNon-invasive, non-radiological quantification of anteroposterior knee joint ligamentous laxity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRussell, D. F.; Deakin, A. H.; Fogg, Q. A.; Picard, F.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives We performed in vitro validation of a non-invasive skin-mounted system that could allow quantification of anteroposterior (AP) laxity in the outpatient setting. Methods A total of 12 cadaveric lower limbs were tested with a commercial image-free navigation system using trackers secured by bone screws. We then tested a non-invasive fabric-strap system. The lower limb was secured at 10Â° intervals from 0Â° to 60Â° of knee flexion and 100 N of force was applied perpendicular to the tibia. Acceptable coefficient of repeatability (CR) and limits of agreement (LOA) of 3 mm were set based on diagnostic criteria for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency. Results Reliability and precision within the individual invasive and non-invasive systems was acceptable throughout the range of flexion tested (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.88, CR 1.6 mm). Agreement between the two systems was acceptable measuring AP laxity between full extension and 40Â° knee flexion (LOA 2.9 mm). Beyond 40Â° of flexion, agreement between the systems was unacceptable (LOA > 3 mm). Conclusions These results indicate that from full knee extension to 40Â° flexion, non-invasive navigation-based quantification of AP tibial translation is as accurate as the standard validated commercial system, particularly in the clinically and functionally important range of 20Â° to 30Â° knee flexion. This could be useful in diagnosis and post-operative evaluation of ACL pathology. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2013;2:233â7.

Patients with knee osteoarthritis have activity limitations which are linked to the strength of the quadriceps muscle. Previous research reported that the relationship between quadriceps muscle strength and physical function is moderated by the level of knee joint frontal plane laxity. The purpose of the current study is to reexamine the moderation effect of the knee joint laxity as measured by stress radiographs on the relationship between quadriceps muscle strength and physical function. One-hundred and sixty osteoarthritis patients participated in this cross-sectional study. Isometric quadriceps muscle strength was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Self-rated and performance-based physical function were measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical function subscale and Get Up and Go test, respectively. Stress radiographs which were taken while applying varus and valgus loads to knee using the TELOS device. Knee joint laxity was determined by measuring the distance between joint surfaces on the medial and lateral sides. Hierarchical multiple regression models were constructed to study the moderation effect of laxity on the strength function relationship. Two regression models were constructed for self-rated and performance-based function. After controlling for demographics, strength contributed significantly in the models. The addition of laxity and laxity-strength interaction did not add significant contributions in the regression models. Frontal plane knee joint laxity measured by stress radiographs does not moderate the relationship between quadriceps muscle strength and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis.

Understanding the pathoanatomy and pathomechanics is critical for accurate surgical soft tissue reconstructions. To quantify the effects of knee hyperextension injury on knee laxity in a human cadaveric model and to qualitatively assess the anatomical injury pattern through surgical dissection. Descriptive laboratory study. Six fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were rigidly mounted on a custom knee testing system that simulates clinical laxity tests. The knee laxity measurements consisted of anterior-posterior laxity, internal-external rotational laxity, and varus-valgus laxity using a custom testing setup and a Microscribe 3DLX system. The laxity data were collected at both 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion for the intact specimens and then after 15 degrees and 30 degrees hyperextension injury. After biomechanical assessment, a detailed dissection was performed to document the injured structures in the knee. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with a Tukey post hoc test (P < .05) was used for statistical comparison. The results from this study suggest progressive damage to translational and rotational knee soft-tissue restraints with increasing knee hyperextension. Knee hyperextension to 30 degrees caused the most significant increase in anterior-posterior and rotational laxity. Anatomical dissections showed a general injury pattern to the posterolateral corner, partial femoral anterior cruciate ligament avulsion in 4 of 6 specimens, and no gross posterior cruciate ligament injuries. Injuries to the posterolateral corner of the knee can result from isolated knee hyperextension. The clinician should be aware of the potential for posterolateral corner injuries with isolated knee hyperextension. This will allow early surgical planning and primary surgical repair.\n\nTibiofemoral forces for the native and post-arthroplasty knee: relationship to maximal laxity through a functional arc of motion.\n\nPubMed\n\nManning, William A; Ghosh, Kanishka; Blain, Alasdair; Longstaff, Lee; Deehan, David John\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAccurate soft tissue balance must be achieved to improve functional outcome after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Sensor-integrated tibial trials have been introduced that allow real-time measurement of tibiofemoral kinematics during TKA. This study examined the interplay between tibiofemoral force and laxity, under defined intraoperative conditions, so as to quantify the kinematic behaviour of the CR femoral single-radius knee. TKA was undertaken in eight loaded cadaveric specimens. Computer navigation in combination with sensor data defined laxity and tibiofemoral contact force, respectively, during manual laxity testing. Fixed-effect linear modelling allowed quantification of the effect for flexion angle, direction of movement and TKA implantation upon the knee. An inverse relationship between laxity and contact force was demonstrated. With flexion, laxity increased as contact force decreased under manual stress. Change in laxity was significant beyond 30Â° for coronal plane laxity and beyond 60Â° for rotatory laxity (pÂ <Â 0.01). Rotational stress in mid-flexion demonstrated the greatest mismatch in inter-compartmental forces. Contact point position over the tibial sensor demonstrated paradoxical roll-forward with knee flexion. Traditional balancing techniques may not reliably equate to uniform laxity or contact forces across the tibiofemoral joint through a range of flexion and argue for the role of per-operative sensor use to aid final balancing of the knee.\n\nTibiofemoral Compression Force Differences Using Laxity- and Force-Based Initial Graft Tensioning Techniques in the ACL-Reconstructed Knee\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFleming, Braden C.; Brady, Mark F.; Bradley, Michael P.; Banerjee, Rahul; Hulstyn, Michael J.; Fadale, Paul D.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPurpose To document the tibiofemoral (TF) compression forces produced during clinical initial graft tension protocols. Methods An image analysis system was used to track the position of the tibia relative to the femur in 11 cadaver knees. TF compression forces were quantified using thin-film pressure sensors. Prior to performing ACL reconstructions with patellar tendon grafts, measurements of TF compression force were obtained from the ACL-intact knee with knee flexion. ACL reconstructions were then performed using âforce-basedâ and âlaxity-basedâ graft tension approaches. Within each approach, high- and low-tension conditions were compared to the ACL-intact condition over the range of knee flexion angles. Results The TF compression forces for all initial graft tension conditions were significantly greater than that of the normal knee when the knee was in full extension (0Â°). The TF compression forces when using the laxity-based approach were greater than those produced with the force-based approach. However the laxity-based approach was necessary to restore normal laxity at the time of surgery. Conclusions The initial graft tension conditions produce different TF compressive force profiles at the time of surgery. A compromise must be made between restoring knee laxity or TF compressive forces when reconstructing the ACL with patellar tendon graft. Clinical Relevance The TF compression forces were greater in the ACL-reconstructed knee for all the initial graft tension conditions when compared to the ACL-intact knee, and that clinically relevant initial graft tension conditions produce different TF compressive forces.

W.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the literature measuring varus-valgus laxity in individuals with tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (OA). Specifically, we aimed to identify varus-valgus laxity differences between persons with OA and controls, by radiographic disease severity, by frontal plane knee alignment, and by sex. We also aimed to identify if there was a relationship between varus-valgus laxity and clinical performance and self-reported function. We systematically searched for peer-reviewed original research articles in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL to identify all existing literature regarding knee OA and objective measurement of varus-valgus laxity in vivo. Forty articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria and data were extracted. Varus-valgus laxity was significantly greater in individuals with OA compared with controls in a majority of studies, while no study found laxity to be significantly greater in controls. Varus-valgus laxity of the knee was reported in persons with OA and varying degrees of frontal plane alignment, disease severity, clinical performance, and self-reported function but no consensus finding could be identified. Females with knee OA appear to have more varus-valgus laxity than males. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the subject populations and differences in laxity measurement devices, applied loading, and laxity definitions. Increased varus-valgus laxity is a characteristic of knee joints with OA. Large variances exist in reported varus-valgus laxity and may be due to differences in measurement devices. Prospective studies on joint laxity are needed to identify if increased varus-valgus laxity is a causative factor in OA incidence and progression.

Porcine knees were tested using a six degree-of-freedom robot, examining three porcine allograft materials compared with the native ACL. Reconstructions were performed using: (1) bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft (BPTB), (2) reconstructive porcine tissue matrix (RTM), or (3) an RTM-polymer hybrid construct (Hybrid). Forces and moments were measured over the entire gait cycle and contrasted at heel strike, mid stance, toe off, and peak flexion. The Hybrid construct performed the best, as magnitude and temporal changes in both anterior knee force and internal knee moment were not different from the native ACL knee. Conversely, the RTM knees showed greater loss in anterior knee force during 2000 cycles than the native ACL knee at heel strike and toe off, with an average force loss of 46%. BPTB knees performed the least favorably, with significant loss in anterior knee force at all key points and an average force loss of 61%. This is clinically relevant, as increases in post-operative knee laxity are believed to play a role in graft failure and early onset osteoarthritis. Â© 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Part II: Determinants of Dynamic Knee Stability\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHurd, Wendy J.; Axe, Michael J.; Snyder-Mackler, Lynn\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjectives To clarify the determinants of dynamic knee stability early after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Materials and Methods 345 consecutive patients who were regular participants in IKDC level I/II sports before injury and had an acute isolated ACL injury from the practice of a single orthopaedic surgeon underwent a screening examination including clinical measures, knee laxity, quadriceps strength, hop testing, and patient self-reported knee function an average of 6 weeks after injury when impairments were resolved. Independent t-tests were performed to evaluate differences in quadriceps strength and anterior knee laxity between potential copers and noncopers. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine the influence of quadriceps strength, pre-injury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on hop test performance, as well as the influence of timed hop, cross-over hop, quadriceps strength, pre-injury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on self-assessed global function. Results Neither anterior knee laxity nor quadriceps strength differed between potential copers and non-copers. Quadriceps strength influenced hop test performance more significantly than pre-injury activity level or anterior knee laxity, but the variance accounted for by quadriceps strength was low (Range: 4-8%). Timed hop performance was the only variable that impacted self-assessed global function. Conclusions Traditional surgical decision making based on passive anterior knee laxity and pre-injury activity level is not supported by the results, as neither are good predictors of dynamic knee stability. Clinical tests that capture neuromuscular adaptations, including the timed hop test, may be useful in predicting function and guiding individualized patient management after ACL injury.

Eighteen voluntary volleyball athletes, belonging to the same senior regional level team (age=22.7 Â± 3 years, height=180.3 Â± 5 cm, mass= 64 Â± 4 kg) were assigned to three groups (N.=6) for vibration on contracted quadriceps (VC), vibration on relaxed muscle (VR), and sham vibration (NV), respectively. Intervention consisted in 3 rMV sessions performed in 3 consecutive days. In each session, 100 Hz, 300-500 Î¼m amplitude vibratory stimuli were bilaterally delivered to the quadriceps in three consecutive 10-minutes applications. Explosive and reactive leg power and knee joint laxity were evaluated 1 day before, and 1, 30, and 240 days after intervention. In VC group, explosive and reactive leg power increased respectively by ~16% and ~9% at 1 day, by ~19% and ~11% at 30 days and by ~26% and ~13% at 240 days, concomitantly knee laxity decreased by ~6%, ~15% and ~18% at the same times. These changes were significantly larger than in the other groups, in which leg power increment and knee joint laxity reduction remained close to ~3%, ~5% and ~10% at 1, 30 and 240 days, respectively. Combined bilateral voluntary contraction and rMV of the quadriceps muscles is a short-lasting, non-invasive technique that can significantly and persistently improve muscle performance and knee laxity in volleyball women players.\n\nAssessing coronal laxity in extension and flexion at a minimum of 10Â years after primary total knee arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshihara, Yasushi; Arai, Yuji; Nakagawa, Shuji; Inoue, Hiroaki; Ueshima, Keiichiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyoshi; Oda, Ryo; Taniguchi, Daigo; Kubo, Toshikazu\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFavourable long-term results after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) require appropriate soft tissue balance. However, the relationships between long-term results after TKA surgery and mediolateral laxities at extension and at 90Â° flexion remain unknown. This study therefore quantitatively assessed ligament balance at extension and at 90Â° knee flexion at least 10Â years after primary TKA, as well as clarifying the relationships between long-term outcomes and mediolateral laxities. This study included 49 knees (19 CR type and 30 PS type) of 33 patients followed up for at least 10Â years after TKA at our hospital. Plain radiographs were obtained with about 150Â N of varus or valgus stress using a Telos arthrometer at extension. At 90Â° flexion, epicondylar views were obtained under a 1.5-kg load and with about 10Â kg of varus or valgus stress. Lateral laxity of about 5Â° was observed in both extension and flexion, with total laxities of varus and valgus stress each less than 10Â°. Postoperative clinical outcomes were good, with significant improvements in extension angle, femorotibial angle, and KSS, and no loosening in any knee. Good long-term results of TKA can be obtained with a lateral laxity of about 5Â°, equivalent to that of healthy knees.

Furthermore, the occurrence of such injuries has led to inquiry regarding optimal prevention techniques. One possible cause of these injuries may be related to inadequate conditioning in cheerleaders. To determine whether a strength and conditioning program produces quantifiable improvements in anterior glenohumeral (GH) laxity and stiffness. Descriptive laboratory study. University laboratory. A sample of 41 collegiate cheerleaders (24 experimental and 17 control participants) volunteered. No participants had a recent history (in the past 6 months) of upper extremity injury or any history of upper extremity surgery. The experimental group completed a 6-week strength and conditioning program between the pretest and posttest measurements; the control group did not perform any strength training between tests. We measured anterior GH laxity and stiffness with an instrumented arthrometer. We conducted a group Ã time analysis of variance with repeated measures on time (P < .05) to determine differences between groups. A significant interaction was demonstrated, with the control group having more anterior GH laxity at the posttest session than the strengthening group (P = .03, partial Î·2 = 0.11). However, no main effect for time (P = .92) or group (P = .97) was observed. In another significant interaction, the control group had less anterior GH stiffness at the posttest session than the strengthening group (P = .03, partial Î·2 = 0.12). Main effects for time (P = .02) and group (P = .004) were also significant. Cheerleaders who participate in a shoulder-strengthening program developed less anterior GH laxity and more stiffness than cheerleaders in the control group.\n\nTowards understanding knee joint laxity: errors in non-invasive assessment of joint rotation can be corrected.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoewis, P; Boeth, H; Heller, M O; Yntema, C; Jung, T; Doyscher, R; Ehrig, R M; Zhong, Y; Taylor, W R\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe in vivo quantification of rotational laxity of the knee joint is of importance for monitoring changes in joint stability or the outcome of therapies. While invasive assessments have been used to study rotational laxity, non-invasive methods are attractive particularly for assessing young cohorts. This study aimed to determine the conditions under which tibio-femoral rotational laxity can be assessed reliably and accurately in a non-invasive manner. The reliability and error of non-invasive examinations of rotational joint laxity were determined by comparing the artefact associated with surface mounted markers against simultaneous measurements using fluoroscopy in five knees including healthy and ACL deficient joints. The knees were examined at 0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â° and 90Â° flexion using a device that allows manual axial rotation of the joint. With a mean RMS error of 9.6Â°, the largest inaccuracy using non-invasive assessment was present at 0Â° knee flexion, whereas at 90Â° knee flexion, a smaller RMS error of 5.7Â° was found. A Bland and Altman assessment indicated that a proportional bias exists between the non-invasive and fluoroscopic approaches, with limits of agreement that exceeded 20Â°. Correction using average linear regression functions resulted in a reduction of the RMS error to below 1Â° and limits of agreement to less than Â±1Â° across all knees and flexion angles. Given the excellent reliability and the fact that a correction of the surface mounted marker based rotation values can be achieved, non-invasive evaluation of tibio-femoral rotation could offer opportunities for simplified devices for use in clinical settings in cases where invasive assessments are not justified. Although surface mounted marker based measurements tend to overestimate joint rotation, and therefore joint laxity, our results indicate that it is possible to correct for this error.

Furthermore, the occurrence of such injuries has led to inquiry regarding optimal prevention techniques. One possible cause of these injuries may be related to inadequate conditioning in cheerleaders. Objective To determine whether a strength and conditioning program produces quantifiable improvements in anterior glenohumeral (GH) laxity and stiffness. Design Descriptive laboratory study. Setting University laboratory. Patients or Other Participants A sample of 41 collegiate cheerleaders ("
