        "text": "Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership Germany Substates After the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) the Holy Roman Empire was little more than a loose confederation of about 300 independent principalities and 1,500 or more semi-sovereign bodies or individuals. Threats from the Ottoman Empire or from Louis XIV of France occasionally stimulated imperial cooperation, but usually each state considered only its own welfare. The Austrian-Prussian wars, Hanover's acquisition of the English throne, and Saxony's holding of the Polish crown exemplify the particularism that prevailed. Napoleon I finally destroyed the empire. After defeating Austria and its imperial allies in 1797 and 1801, he annexed some German land and suggested that the larger territories compensate themselves by confiscating the free cities and ecclesiastical states. By the Diet's Recess (1803), 112 small states were thus seized by their neighbours. Three years later Napoleon compelled 16 German states to form the Confederation of the Rhine and to secede from the empire. On March 6, 1806, Francis II, who had previously assumed the title of Emperor of Austria, abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor and declared the old empire dissolved, but a new German Regime was established with the king of Preussia as Emperor, which lasted until 1918. In 1806 the number the lesser territorial rulers in South and West Germany, who were not allowed to join the Confederation, were mediatized in July 1806. The mediatization did not deprive the mediatized houses their lands, but it changed their position as sovereign houses because their immediate territories came under overlordship (Landeshoheit) of the members the Confederation. The status of the former Imperial knights became similar to the territorial nobility. The houses that had the status of the Imperial Estate by 1806, were called Standesherren, but the Standesherrliche Häuser were given important political privileges that distinguished those houses from territorial titled families. In many German countries Standesherren had hereditary right to sit in the first chambers of state assemblies (similar to the House of Lords in the British Parliament).\n\nApart from the thusands of more or less sovereign states, the country was devided into countless lordships, that were in charge of the local government.
