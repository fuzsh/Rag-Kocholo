These commissions may have a national, provincial or institutional authorization. The activity in Ontario has been par- ticularly lively; there are fourteen state-supported universities in the province, and an increasing sense of community has made them aware of common prob- lems. The University of Toronto has been deeply concerned with institutional analysis; in part this is the result of size and complexity; in part, the natural outcome of a liberal tradition that sees no conflict between loyalty to an institu- tion and criticism of its assumptions, methods and goals. I should like to comment upon the impact on the University of several reports that were received and discussed during 1965-66. Two of these were national in scope and were sponsored by national bodies, namely, the Report on the Financing of Higher Education in Canada and the Report on University Government in Canada, A third report was purely institutional in inspiration and framework ; this was the Report on Graduate Studies in the University of Toronto, which was known as the Laskin Report, from its Chairman, Professor Bora Laskin (now Mr. Justice Laskin). A fourth report did not appear officially during the year, but its main recommendations were widely known and discussed in the University. This was the Report on the Development of Graduate Pro- grammes in Ontario Universities under the chairmanship of President Spinks of the University of Saskatchewan and sponsored jointly by the Committee on University Affairs and the Committee of University Presidents. All these reports, it should be noticed, originated within the universities themselves, and underline the capacity for self-analysis and self-renewal within the academic community. It is also a fact worth recording that members of the faculty of the University of Toronto have played important roles in the launching and development of the two national and one provincial reports. The Commission on the Financing of Higher Education in Canada was under the chairmanship of Professor Vincent Bladen, at that time Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, and one of the commissioners was the Honourable Senator Wallace McCutcheon, a member of our Board of Governors. In the setting up of the Commission on University Government in Canada Professor Bora Laskin played an important role, and I 4 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO acted as chairman of the advisory committee to the commission. The Vice- President ( Research Administration ) , Professor Gilbert Robinson, was responsible for the compilation of statistical material about graduate work in the province, upon which a good deal of the work of the Spinks report was based. The importance of these commissions rarely lies in the extent to which specific recommendations are accepted and implemented. Frequently, of course, recommendations are implemented, either in whole or in part, and every com- mission works on the assumption that its recommendations will be taken seriously and quite possibly implemented. But at the same time there is a recognition that any report achieves its maximum impact through the discussion it arouses, the corrective steps it inspires and the long-term influence it exerts. The Report on the Financing of Higher Education in Canada will continue for many years to be the reference point for all proposals on the financing of higher education in Canada. One can see its influence already in the disposition of the provincial government to adopt a system of formula financing and in its plans for student aid (although in this case one might have hoped that the provincial government had read the Bladen Report more intensively and consulted other sources as well ) . Although recent agreements between the Dominion and provincial govern- ments have violently changed the context of financing higher education in Canada, the Bladen quantitative estimates will long remain valuable. Important areas of the Bladen Report are as yet untouched. One thinks particularly of the recommendations on the support of research. Certainly specific recommendations, such as the payment of overhead, should be immediately implemented. But there is a good deal to be said now for a separate examination of research in Canada. The very term needs to be defined so as to relate it to postgraduate work in the universities and to activity in industry. The scope of the bodies already in existence, such as the National Research Council, the Defence Research Board, the Canada Council, the Medical Research Council and the Science Council needs to be precisely determined and the inevitable problem of pro- vincial/federal responsibilities to be examined. One welcomes Mr. Pearson's statement about the determination of the federal government to remain firmly in research irrespective of subject-matter; one must also recognize that such strong jurisdictions as Ontario will not be content to remain out of an area that has so many implications for economic growth. One hesitates to suggest another commission, but in view of the examinations that have already been made and the information that is already available the role of such a commission would be largely integrative and analytical. One incidental effect of the Bladen Report on this University, with impor- tant, long-term consequences, was the setting up of a Department of Institutional Research. This grew out of the paper by Professor R. W. Judy and Mr. J. B. Levine on the use of computer models in university planning and administration, which was printed as an appendix to the Bladen Report. Mr. B. L. Hansen was appointed as Director of Institutional Research, and took up his duties on July 1, 1966. The Duff/Berdahl Report will also have a long-term effect upon Canadian universities. Since, however, many of its recommendations can be implemented by the institutions themselves, one can speak now of immediate effects. In two PRESIDENT'S REPORT 5 major areas the DufT/Berdahl Report has already gone a long way toward changing the structure of university government in Canada. First, it summarized with clarity and cogency the arguments for faculty participation in the govern- ment of universities at the senior level, so that, within a few years, most univer- sities in Canada will have on their boards representatives from the faculty. At the University of Toronto arrangements have been made to have three members of the President's Council attend meetings of the Board of Governors until such time as the legal and constitutional arrangements can be made for formalizing faculty representation. In the second place, the DufT/Berdahl recommendations for the democratization of departments and the de-prof essionalization of academic senior administrators have been widely accepted. Here a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Haist brought in recommendations about appoint- ments of departmental chairmen and deans that followed very closely the Duff/ Berdahl recommendation and these were subsequently affirmed by discussions in the President's Council and Board of Governors. Sir James Duff and Professor Berdahl may already take great satisfaction in their work and its impact upon the Canadian university community. That impact is likely to go far beyond Canada. In a review of the report which appeared in the December issue of The Universities Quarterly Sir Eric Ashby, perhaps the most eloquent and authoritative spokesman for higher education today, wrote that \"this Report contains a distillation of academic wisdom about how universities ought to be managed.\" In one area the DufT/Berdahl Report has encountered sharp criticisms, and that is in the area of student participation in university government. The Report recommends the setting up of consultative committees on the departmental level made up of students and staff and, specifically, the adoption of the device now employed at Queen's University and the Scottish universities by which the students elect a Rector who is looked upon as their special spokesman. The Report firmly turns down more radical suggestions about student participation in governing bodies on the grounds of \"the rapid turnover in student leadership\" and \"the delicacy and confidentiality of many of the questions that come before the Board,\" which \"would effectively silence the student representative vis-a-vis his constituency.\" These recommendations are not likely to satisfy student opinion; on this issue the Commission has not so much solved the problem as issued a tentative statement. The problems of student participation have already occupied a great deal of time in the President's Council and are likely to occupy even more time in the future. It is time well spent, for the problems are complex and demand for their resolution the kind of plain-speaking that, in the past, has rarely obtained. I would go beyond the DufT/Berdahl Report in acknowledging the fact that there are places in formal university government where student participation is valuable. Its value arises simply from the detailed knowledge students have of questions in which they are deeply interested, questions such as student aid and residential policy. Moreover, there are strong reasons why the university as a community should encourage student involvement. The university depends, and will continue to depend, upon informed public opinion, which in its turn will take its direction from graduates of the university. The more these graduates know 6 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO about the university, and the more they themselves have been involved in its problems, the more likely it is that they will speak with sympathy and conviction. This is the positive fact of student participation that the DufT/Berdahl com- missioners did not adequately emphasize. There is a negative fact that the commissioners hinted at and which should be frankly recognized. This fact is that the term \"student\" covers a variety of types and student solidarity exists only as a hazy abstraction. The university is faced with a problem of determining where the authentic student voice resides; and once that is determined the further problem arises of how best to deal with the issues that are of particular concern to students. In general, the student's emphasis will be on the immediate vexation rather than the long-term issue: he will be more concerned about hours of operation in the library than about the rate of scholarly accessions; more about student aid than relative priorities between scholarship, teaching and research; more about individual rights than corporate obligations. Rather than seeking membership in existing bodies where their concerns are inadequately dealt with, students might strive for the establishment of bodies made up of representatives of staff, admin- istrations and students and committed to the discussion of problems posed by student members. In this way they could be assured of quick consideration of their pressing issues by a senior body. In these comments I have assumed that the universitv is an institution concerned specifically with preserving, disseminating and advancing knowledge and this is best achieved by the gathering together in one place of scholars working systematically in various fields of knowledge and initiating others into these fields. Scholarship carries its own authority; no experience at the university can be more valuable than observing at close range a powerful and incisive mind in action. The university thus encourages discipleship, but it is a discipleship based upon the recognition of achievement and not on passive submission. A disciple may turn into the liveliest of critics of the master without losing his sense of discipleship. Now this concept of the university with specific tasks, accomplished by a blending of order and personal respect, is being widely challenged by a group of activists, small in numbers but increasingly influential in national bodies and increasingly assertive in local organizations. Many of their ideas are derived, sometimes in a raw state, from the American organization, Students for a Democratic Society. By study of the literature of that organization and of Canadian groups, one can arrive at an understanding of the basic assumptions. They are rarely stated with explicit directness, but they determine the tone and explain many of the specific recommendations. There are four main assumptions. ( 1 ) The university is a political body concerned with general goals of human welfare. It is true that these goals have an intellectual cast but this does not make the university different from other political bodies. ( 2 ) Within this political body there must be no hierarchical distinctions. The very concept of administrative power is anathema ; even the distinctions between the teacher and the taught must disappear, for it is an affront to human dignity to have one member of the university community sit in judgment on another. (3) Since the university is a political entity it must be governed on a strict democratic basis. There must be participatory democracy with a continuous reference back to the whole com- munity of matters discussed in a governing body. (4) In order to bring about PRESIDENT'S REPORT 7 these conditions all tactics are permissible, since the university structure is inherently bad, and since administrators, and even teachers, are hopelessly committed to the old regime. The goal must be, by the selection of issues and the careful massing of opinion, to force a crisis in which the university in its corporate aspect will be humiliated and presented to the public in an unflattering light. The last idea has, so far, taken root only in California. It is not likely to survive the colder climate of Canada. We have here assembled a strange cargo of ideas. Their origins are disparate. Some come from political utopianism — the longing for a paradisal community; some derive from dissatisfaction with the university's traditional bias to the past, and its refusal to commit itself to specific political action ; some have an unpleasant aroma of totalitarianism, whether of the right or of the left; some seem to be substitutes for religious conviction. At their worst, the student activists sound like a combination of Paul Goodman, Chairman Mao, and the Oxford Group; at their best they can force a re-examination of postulates and a reformulation of goals. In another area I think that the Duff/Berdahl recommendations will be out- distanced by events. In the general concept of university government the Report adheres to the traditional British pattern, which has roots deep in the nineteenth century, by which there is a two-tiered system of government, one of which is primarily lay in its composition and the other, exclusively academic. Canadian universities have in large measure followed this structure except that they have not admitted academic members to the lay board. The commissioners now suggest that we adopt the British practice of having a substantial academic representation on the board and of making the academic body exclusively academic. The Commissioners briefly discuss the possibility of having a unitary system, which is actually in effect in some of the French Canadian universities. They dismiss the idea, however, on the grounds that the unitary body tends to be too deeply con- cerned with fiscal to the detriment of academic matters and does not provide a sufficiently broad basis for engaging the attention and participation of the total academic community. I do not think that the Commissioners gave enough attention to possibilities of developing such a one-tiered system so as to do away with some of the defects of the two-tiered system. The two-tiered system, for instance, still retains, even in the British mode, the old distinction between academic and financial, which should no longer be given even a symbolic recognition in our universities. What is more, the two-tiered system requires the setting up of machinery to maintain liaison between the two bodies, and this can result in long delays and in difficult and sustained periods of negotiation. I would like to see serious consideration given to the possibility of establishing one governing body in the university. It would be a mixed lay and academic body whose representation would have to be devised so as to make it authoritative and acceptable to the academic community. Its success would depend upon a high degree of decentralization, first to faculty and college councils, and second, to committees formed by the central body. Its great virtue would be the concentra- tion of resources required to make decisions in major matters of policy and a consequent diminution in bureaucracy, and the acceleration of the decision- making process. These suggestions about decentralization run counter to the fashionable 8 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO emphasis on a strong, central planning authority. Thus the Spinks Commission, after their marvellously lucid and superbly objective account of resources in Ontario for graduate work and research, were constrained to recommend a University of Ontario with a board of Governors with imposing powers. The presidents, who had previously argued against this proposal at great length with the commissioners, remained unconvinced. The presidents have consistently recommended a central structure that has toughness and powers of decision, but that recognizes that the real source of co-operation and planning is in the universities and the various professional committees the universities establish. The university community is the last place where one should wish policy to be decided at the centre and then passed down. The farther away individuals are from the decision-makers, the less likely they are to accept the decisions. There has been much nonsense talked about duplication and competition among the universities. In the undergraduate field of Arts and Science, where the province is struggling to keep up with the demand, there can be no duplica- tion. For many years to come every university must have the basic subjects of a liberal education. Duplication is a possibility in professional education, where the need is more accurately known that it is in the liberal arts. But even that involves dubious assumptions about the structure of society, which events tend to disprove. A case could be made out, for instance, that we need a great many more medical schools in this province. The powerful inhibiting factor is not fear of duplication, but inadequate financial resources. Duplication is a greater pos- sibility in graduate work, where unrestricted activity in esoteric studies can spell mediocrity. We are, however, a long way from such developments. As the Spinks Commissioners point out, we must devote the next years to building up our library resources so that they meet minimum needs. What we should emphasize is not the fear of duplication, but the need for concentration. If there is occasional duplication, if two or three universities build up strong groups, say, in Elizabethan drama, or in nuclear physics, what matter? The over-all effect will be beneficial, even if strict principles of centralized economy and planning are violated. In its recommendations, the Laskin report emphasized the need for decen- tralization in the graduate school. The Dean of the School of Graduate Studies thus summarizes the effect of the report's main constitutional recommendations: \"As called for by Council, the new statute combines continuity and change. On the one hand, it reasserts the basic Toronto system (now adopted in most Cana- dian universities) of a unitary, comprehensive graduate school managing all graduate degree programmes ; on the other, it provides for a small elective instead of a large nominated Council, four active instead of two inert Divisions, and, with much more of the executive function decentralized to the Divisions and the rest assumed by the smaller and more engaged Council, the abolition of the Executive Committee. A reorganized secretariat and revised procedure should shift a good part of the burden of admissions and enrolment (the part which is routine in nature) from professorial to secretarial shoulders, leaving professors freer to cope with problems involving academic judgment.\" Even if we were to establish a single-tiered system of university government with extensive decentralization, we would still need a body similar to the \"Uni- versity Court\" proposed in the Duff/Berdahl Report. Such a body would constitute PRESIDENT'S REPORT 9 what the commissioners describe as the university's \"window to the world,\" and would be made up of a very wide representation from within and without the university community. Such a body becomes increasingly important as the uni- versity arouses more and more attention from the outside world. The university must still insist upon confidentiality in discussing many matters and must guard against the intrusion of outside pressure groups while decisions are being arrived at. Once the decisions are reached they should, however, be given the widest publicity, and the university should accept its obligation to explain and defend its policies. It has a special obligation to make sure that members of the staff are informed about major decisions before they are discussed publicly. In educational policy, where so much depends on the precise phrase and on the totally articulated argument, there is no substitute for the complete document. II The multifarious activities of the University during the year are chronicled in the various reports that follow. I should like to comment on the developments which seem to me to be particularly important. I would mention first the decisions to move ahead immediately with the building of the Medical Sciences Centre and the Research Library for the Humanities and Social Sciences. By the time this Report appears the Medical Sciences building will be considerably advanced and the final detailed plans for the Library will be complete. The Library plans had been completed some months ago but had been held up pending discussions about the Spinks recommendation on the creation of a provincial library system. In any such system the University of Toronto Library, by reason of its historical primacy, must play a central role both as a repository of books and as a centre for technological advances in cataloguing and biblio- graphy. The Ontario universities are now unanimous that such a provincial system should go forward and accordingly the plans for the Library have been revised so as to provide additional space for outside readers and to make pro- visions for a provincial bibliographical centre. There is good reason to believe that the new library will be the most advanced library structure as yet erected on this continent. I am unapologetic about emphasizing the importance of these two new buildings, for though bricks and mortar, as the tired old adage has it, are no substitutes for the human spirit, the human spirit still needs space and facilities. The completion of these two buildings will mark a new era in two areas of traditional distinction at Toronto — medicine and the humanities. For the rapid maturing of the plans for the Medical Sciences building we are immensely indebted to the imagination and driving force of the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Henry Borden, who has made this building his special concern. For the Library building we are indebted to a powerful alliance in which the Librarian, the Dean Emeritus of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies, the Vice-President for Scarborough and Erindale Colleges, and a formidable battalion of scholars, have played important roles. It is a fact not unknown in the University that the building of a proper research library has been my obsessive concern since I returned to this University. We have still 10 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO to plan and build a building as crucial to the physical and natural sciences as the Medical Sciences building is to medicine and the Research Library is to the humanities and social sciences. That is a composite Science Building to be built to the west of the series of buildings now stretching along St. George Street from Harbord to Russell streets. A good deal of the building will simply provide space that is urgently needed for basic needs in Botany, Geology and Geography ; the remainder will enable Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science to pursue advanced work, often on an interdisciplinary basis. It may seem curious that, with the construction of three major buildings in science during recent years, I should raise the need for additional facilities on a major scale. The truth is that, for many years to come, we cannot maintain the status quo in any division of the University. Even without the increases in enrolment that we have expected, we are constantly faced by intellectual develop- ments that demand new physical facilities. The Dean of the Faculty of Law refers again, with some liveliness, to the inadequacies of the present facilities for Law; many of his colleagues could, and, from time to time, do, join the admonitory chorus. All the University can do, with limited funds and limited human resources, is to scrutinize its priorities constantly, in the light of its total commit- ments. Another building of the year deserves a special accolade: Scarborough College, which was completed and occupied midway through the term. The building inspired a succession of laudatory articles in architectural magazines, many of them with an international circulation. This is a building to which it is impossible to be neutral, since it is a statement of a radically new concept of the university community. I predict that it will take its place along with the Toronto City Hall and the Simon Fraser campus as a major contribution to Canadian architecture. It is appropriate that the University should foster radical experi- mentation. Traditionally the University delighted to pay its respects to the past and to proclaim through its choice of architectural styles its devotion to the mighty dead. But it has an obligation no less pressing to reach out to the future and to lead the way. I have from time to time commented in this report on our general inter- national obligations and our specific international contributions. These have taken the form of sending staff members to developing countries to assist in the establishment of professional schools or in the teaching of subjects for which there was a scarcity of experts. At home, we have concentrated on building up our resources in areas traditionally ignored by Canadian universities, but often now of immediate concern : areas such as Japan, China, India, the Islamic World, Russia and Eastern Europe. The emphasis has been on the building up of classical studies in language and literature, and this emphasis will continue. Along with it should go a concern for contemporary cultures and society, and it was this concern that lay behind the establishment of a Programme in Inter- national Studies during the year, under the chairmanship of Professor Cranford Pratt. The programme will foster modes of co-operation among departments with an international interest. One interdisciplinary centre with a fine record of achievement predates the establishment of the programme: the Centre for Russian and East European Studies; and it will provide a model for others to PRESIDENT'S REPORT 11 follow. A Centre for the Study of International Relations has a high claim for the attention of the Programme. The University has now taken steps to organize its international resources; it has made available from slim endowment resources initiating grants. It awaits now the support that should come from the federal government, but, at the same time, in the light of past history, it turns its eyes towards the south from where, so often, its salvation has come. I record with great pleasure the appearance of the first volume of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography. The event was significant in a number of ways. It revealed again the efficiency and imagination of the University of Toronto Press; the volume — a repository of seventeenth-century figures — drew attention to the importance of our French inheritance, and gave a special significance to the joint publication by the Laval and Toronto presses; finally, it is the beginning of the major publishing venture in Canadian publishing history and it thereby highlights once again the centrality of the university in the cultural life of this country. Ill The major ceremonial event of the year was the installation in October of Dr. O. M. Solandt as the Chancellor of the University of Toronto. Dr. Solandt's election to the high office is in a sense a continuation of the academic tradition first established by Dr. Samuel Beatty and continued by Dr. Archile Jeanneret. It is true that Dr. Solandt has not been associated with universities directly in recent years, but his work with the government and with business has kept him close to the university world, and, in particular, to the complex world of scientific research. His subsequent appointment as chairman of the new Science Council makes even more significant his alliance with the university world. The retirement of Dr. Jeanneret after so many continuous years of service draws attention to the extraordinary nature of his contribution to the University. It can best be summed up, I think, by saying that he has been the embodiment of the liberal and humane tradition that is at the very core of the University of Toronto. It is appropriate that he should now turn his attention to a biography of Sir Robert Falconer, who stood for the qualities that Dr. Jeanneret admires and embodies. (Since these words were written, we have received the sad news of Dr. Jean- neret's death.) The end of the year saw the retirement of four major academic adminis- trators and officials. In each case, however, I can report he will continue his service to the University in some other capacity. Dr. Bladen retired as Dean of Arts and Science, and now reverts with undisguised enthusiasm to his pro- fessorship in Political Economy. Under his leadership the Faculty of Arts and Science moved ahead almost to its full development without at the same time losing any of its academic distinction. Indeed under his leadership it has become a far more highly integrated and powerful academic community. I commend a careful reading of his valedictory report. Dr. R. R. McLaughlin retired as Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering but moved immediately into a new post as Chairman of the Planning Division. During his deanship the Faculty was a happy and harmonious community which grew each year in 12 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO scholarly strength and distinction, particularly in the areas of research and graduate studies. He will now bring to his Planning Division his unparalleled knowledge of the University, his fine capacity for resolving conflicts and his sure apprehension of university needs. Dr. John Hamilton resigned as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine to become Vice-President for Health Sciences. Under him the Faculty began its voyage into the new world of medicare and massive research. Among his many contributions to the welfare of the Faculty I recall with particu- lar satisfaction his skill in integrating the teaching hospitals and the Faculty. In his new position he will be in charge of the integration of all divisions of the University concerned with the health sciences and he will in addition take on the general administrative duties for which his liberal interests and his skill in negotiation prepare him admirably. Dr. William Swinton left his post as Director of the Royal Ontario Museum to become a Centennial Professor in the Uni- versity. He took over the direction of the Museum at a difficult time, and he infused into it a liberating vitality. His scholarship and his skill in exposition will now be at the service of the University, particularly in the developing area of the history and philosophy of science. July 1, 1966, was a major turning point in the history of the University with a change in leadership in four main divisions. Professor A. D. Allen became Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. Since 1964 he had been a highly successful Associate Dean of the Faculty, and his appointment to the senior office was acclaimed by his colleagues. In the tradition of the office, he brings a concern for the development of the Faculty as a whole, and an ability to work easily and effectively with his colleagues. Professor James Ham became Dean of Applied Science and Engineering. His scholarly interests and achievements will ensure the continuation of our emphasis on research and graduate work in that Faculty. Professor A. L. Chute became Dean of Medicine. As Professor of Paediatrics, he was already a senior member of the Faculty; we are fortunate to be able to inherit his energy, his scholarship and his unselfish concern for the advancement of Medicine on behalf of the whole Faculty. Mr. Peter Swann became Director of the Royal Ontario Museum. He comes from Oxford, where he was Keeper of the Department of Eastern Art at the Ashmolean Museum. His energy, his imaginativeness and his wide-ranging scholarship will find scope and test in his new position. At the end of the year Professor B. Wilkinson retired as Director of the Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies, but fortunately returns as Director of Studies. It was fitting that a scholar of such wide international distinction should be the first head of the Centre, which can draw upon resources in many places at the University. He has given the Centre a strong direction. Professor Wilkin- son's successor is Professor J. F. Leyerle of the Department of English at University College, whose fine scholarship is joined to a persuasive enthusiasm for his subject. Arrangements were made during the year for Professor Northrop Frye to become a University Professor. He will retain his professorial appointment at Victoria College, but he will leave the office of Principal on January 1, 1967. It is well known that the services of Northrop Frye were zealously sought by many major universities, and we are happy (and relieved) that he has decided to stay with us. The University is pleased to join with Victoria College in the arrange- PRESIDENT'S REPORT 13 ments for Professor Frye's appointment. This is another illustration of the strength that comes from the federated structure. A major appointment was that of Arnold Wilkinson as Warden of Hart House. He had already demonstrated his fine qualities in various capacities, and during the year he assumed full responsibility for the House. His formal appoint- ment was warmly received in the entire academic community. He will have the difficult task of determining the role of Hart House in the new era of student centres, political activism and refurbished feminism. Since a large university is an institution which must be assumed to continue forever, it inevitably faces the sad, annual, task of recording the loss from the immediate community of the members of staff who have died. C. Aberhart, Associate Professor of Surgery, a distinguished urologist himself, was a teacher who played a leading role in the postgraduate education of urologists of the present. At all too young an age, R. E. Deane, Associate Professor of Geology, and a warm-hearted teacher who evoked the affection of his students and associates, died tragically while pursuing his work on the Great Lakes. At an even younger age was lost W. J. Evon, an Associate in the Faculty of Dentistry, who, like Deane, was supported by the admiration of his students. H. M. Fowler, Professor in the Ontario College of Education, was very active in educational research, and like his immediate colleague, Professor R. D. Phillips, who was in fact the father of vocational teacher-training, a large contributor to the development of teachers in Ontario and elsewhere. By his qualities of head, heart and personality, Lionel Massey did much during his regrettably short career as Associate Director of the Royal Ontario Museum to make the Museum a truly integral part of the University. A devoted explorer of new ideas, L. Oschinsky, Associate Professor of Anthropology, was an unflagging guide to his students. R. C. Ower, Assistent Professor of Anatomy, was notable for successful under- graduate teaching and the development of new techniques for the illustration of anatomical structure. In the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, the University lost J. M. Tracy, Senior Research Assistant, who rendered exemplary service during the critical period of the development of Salk vaccine. All who knew him will remember W. P. Wallace, Professor of Classics in University College, for the rigorous standards which he imposed on his own scholarship, and asked for, in a friendly way, in the scholarship of his students and his col- leagues. During the academic year 1965-66 several members of the staff who had retired from active duty were lost through death: R. I. Harris, Associate Pro- fessor of Surgery; H. A. Hoskin, Associate Professor of Dentistry; J. F. Mac- Donald, Professor of English in University College; T. J. Meek, Professor of Oriental Languages in University College; E. S. Moore, Professor of Geology; C. A. Rae, Graduate Lecturer in Oto-laryngology, and J. A. MacFarlane, Dean Emeritus of the Faculty of Medicine. Until the time of his death, Dean Mac- Farlane was very active as an adviser to universities in matters affecting faculties of medicine. Although this Report is concerned with the academic year 1965-66, it may perhaps not be wholly improper to record the death, in the early months of 1966-67, of two highly regarded members of the staff. D. J. Reid, Chief 14 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Accountant of the University, was admired and respected by all who had dealings with him, and he laboured, perhaps too devotedly, for the welfare of the whole institution. W. S. Wilson, for years Assistant Dean and Secretary of the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering and, upon retirement from that post, Assistant to the Principal of New College, was a friendly adviser to students, colleagues and members of academic bodies, all of whom responded to his wisdom with gratitude and love. Among those who have formally retired from the positions which they have held, some are continuing actively to serve the University in a somewhat different way, and all of them continue to be a source of the University's strength. E. R. Arthur, Professor of Architecture, is a practising architect, a keen student of the history of architecture, especially in our civic community, and through his knowl- edgeable vigour, a benefactor of the public. G. Bagnani, Professor of Classics in University College, has been, and is, a source of scholarly (and other) stimulus to his students, his colleagues and many responsive members of the public. Miss H. A. Bennett, Associate Professor of Nursing, has been devoted to her School, and particularly to the needs of the graduate nurses who attend it. Four dis- tinguished surgeons have retired: A. W. Farmer, Professor of Surgery; P. E. Ireland, Professor of Oto-laryngology ; R. C. Laird, Professor of Surgery, and W. K. Welsh, Professor of Surgery. All of them have international reputations. Miss F. H. Fraser, Professor of Microbiology, has been, as a dedicated teacher, a pillar of the School of Hygiene since the time of its creation. Liaison between the Faculty of Medicine and the hospital which he served has been strengthened by D. B. French, Assistant Professor of Oto-laryngology. J. E. Goodwin, Associate Professor of Physiological Hygiene and Associate in Psychiatry, is noted, among other things, for his research in problems of national defence. The general public has been made aware of the dangers which beset one of its greatest assets, the Great Lakes, by the uncompromising vigour of G. B. Langford, Professor of Geology and the father of the Great Lakes Institute. F. Lorriman, Associate Professor of Chemistry, who is universally regarded as one of the University's superb teachers, is continuing to serve the University through Scarborough College. A urologist, D. R. Mitchell, Associate Professor of Surgery, has been devoted to the maintenance and improving of high standards in his \"service\" at the Toronto General Hospital. R. Presgrave, Professor of Business, is both adept in his specialty, and remarkable for the range and the depth of his true humanistic interests. N. E. Sheppard, Professor of Mathematics, has been for some years an active president of the University of Toronto Athletic Association, and for a long time the \"dean\" of actuarial scientists in Canada. In the Faculty of Food Sciences and elsewhere, Miss M. D. Smith has been a stimulating member of the community. Many present members of the staff of the University, as well as others, recognize C. E. Snelling, Associate Professor of Paediatrics, as one of their great teachers. A senior colleague of W. J. Webber, Professor of Mathe- matics, has said of him that his coming to Toronto was \"the mathematical event of the century.\" Of those members of the faculty who have resigned, special mention may perhaps be made of B. Laskin, Professor of Law. He has been an outstanding Professor of Law, and an outstanding statesman in the councils of the Uni- PRESIDENT'S REPORT 15 versity. He resigned to accept appointment as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario. In recording the departure of valued and respected colleagues from immedi- ate membership in the University community, the University expresses its great gratitude to all of them. They will continue, forever, to be part of the University's life and power. IV There are now (exclusive of the federated colleges) over 1,200 full-time members of the teaching staff, and we should have at the time of our full expansion in the early 1970's a full-time staff of over 2,000. This will demand a rate of accession that we have never had before, but experience indicates that, provided resources are available early enough in the academic year, we can secure the staff we need. In 1965-66 we had a net increase in staff of over 100; in the year 1966-67 it is 160. To achieve our goal we must advance this number well beyond 200. These calculations are based on an over-all staff-student ratio of approxi- mately 1 to 14. It has been suggested that in some jurisdictions a higher ratio obtains without loss of academic quality. This is an area, however, where generalization is difficult and statistics are notoriously misleading. One must secure the staff that a given educational system demands. In graduate work, for instance, there is no substitute for private meetings with the thesis director; and in the clinical work in Medicine and Dentistry a higher ratio than 1 to 3 or 4 may have serious consequences for the professional competence of graduates. A college system, too, demands more staff than a unitary system. The University of Toronto, with the largest graduate school in Canada, with also the largest faculties of medicine and dentistry, and with a profound historical commitment to the college system, must clearly maintain a favourable staff-student ratio. The key to attracting staff is a reputation for scholarship. This University enjoys such a reputation, even more widely outside than inside the country. The constricting domesticity of Canadian comment frowns upon claims of excel- lence. Marshall McLuhan was a colleague with a few amusing and provocative ideas until the journals in New York and London began to put him in the company of the great social critics. There will be, I predict, widespread emphasis on the weakness that the Spinks Commissioners found in our provincial graduate schools, and no reference to the tributes to the strength ; particularly since Toronto commands so much of that strength. At the risk of violating the Canadian relish for self-denigration (permissible, perhaps, in this centennial year), I quote the passages from the Spinks report where Toronto's scholarship is assessed: \"In the physical sciences, the Ontario universities are already strong. Toronto and McMaster, Queen's and Western, all have their areas of strength, and there are impressive examples of 'big science' on their campuses. . . . Toronto is Canada's principal centre for [humanistic] studies, and it displays an impressive breadth and depth. Its libraries, its numerous specialized institutes, the cultural cross-currents to which a federated university with several sectarian colleges must be exposed, have all contributed to this strength. Several of its humanities' departments are of world stature and in effect belong to the entire world of 16 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO scholarship. The Toronto humanists embody a central core of traditional studies with many new initiatives. . . . Toronto and Queen's have for many years dominated [the social sciences] in Canada. The leadership of such men as Innis and Mackintosh, Creighton and Lower, has been of prime value to Canada as a national state, as well as to Ontario.\" There is no cause here for complacency and self-satisfaction. Because we build on strength, we must always be aware of our duty to maintain it. Claude Bissell APPENDIX Honours Dr. A.
