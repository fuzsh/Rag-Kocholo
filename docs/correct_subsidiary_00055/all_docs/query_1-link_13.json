BUSINESS\n\nGenzyme Corporation (\"Genzyme\" or the \"Company\") is a diversified,\n\nintegrated human health care company which operates in five major business\n\nareas. The Company's business activities in the areas of therapeutics,\n\ndiagnostic services, diagnostic products, and pharmaceuticals are organized as\n\nthe Genzyme General Division (the \"General Division\"). Genzyme's activities to\n\ndevelop, manufacture and market technologically advanced products for the\n\ntreatment and prevention of serious tissue damage are conducted through the\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair Division (\"GTR\"). Genzyme was incorporated in 1981.\n\nPrior to December 16, 1994, Genzyme had one class of common stock. On\n\nDecember 16, 1994, the authorized shares of common stock were redesignated as\n\nGeneral Division Common Stock (\"General Division Stock\") and a second class of\n\ncommon stock, Tissue Repair Division Common Stock (\"TR Stock\") was authorized in\n\nconnection with the creation of GTR. The General Division Stock and the TR Stock\n\nare intended to reflect the value and track the performance of the General\n\nDivision and GTR, respectively. Genzyme, however, continues to hold title to all\n\nof its assets and be responsible for all of its liabilities and the holders of\n\nthe General Division Stock and the TR Stock have no specific claim against the\n\nassets allocated to the division whose performance is associated with the class\n\nof stock they hold. In addition, liabilities or contingencies of either division\n\nthat affect Genzyme's resources or financial condition could affect the\n\nfinancial condition or results of operations of both divisions.\n\n-1-\n\n3\n\nCeredase(R), Cerezyme(R), Thyrogen(R), InSight(R) and Vianain(R) are\n\nregistered trademarks of the Company.

The\n\nDivision's results of operations are highly dependent on sales of these products\n\nwhich, for 1995, totaled $215 million. Other specialty therapeutic products\n\nunder development include Thyrogen(R) hormone for use in the diagnosis and\n\ntreatment of thyroid cancer, a line of biomaterial products based on hyaluronic\n\nacid (\"HA\") principally for use to limit the formation of postoperative\n\nadhesions (the \"HA Products\") and products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis\n\n(\"CF\"). Applications for Premarket Approval (each a \"PMA\") have been submitted\n\nand are pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for two of\n\nthe HA Products, Seprafilm(TM) bioresorbable membrane and Sepracoat(TM) coating\n\nsolution. The HA Products are being developed on behalf of a research and\n\ndevelopment limited partnership. See \"Related Entities -- Surgical Aids\n\nPartnership.\" The CF products are being developed on behalf of a special purpose\n\naccelerated research corporation. See \"Related Entities -- Neozyme II\n\nCorporation.\"\n\nThe General Division's diagnostic services business applies advanced\n\nbiotechnology to develop and provide high quality, sophisticated genetic\n\ndiagnostic services to physicians, hospitals, universities, medical centers,\n\nclinical laboratories, genetic centers and managed care organizations throughout\n\nthe United States and internationally. The General Division also provides\n\nidentity testing services to state and local government agencies, attorneys and\n\nvarious courts in the United States, as well as donor typing services to bone\n\nmarrow registries. The diagnostic services business was previously conducted\n\nthrough IG Laboratories, Inc. (\"IG\"), a majority-owned (69%) subsidiary of\n\nGenzyme, and Vivigen, Inc. (\"Vivigen\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genzyme\n\nthat was managed by IG. In October 1995, Genzyme acquired all of the\n\npublicly-owned shares of IG for shares of General Division Stock and IG was\n\nmerged into Genzyme. In February 1996, Genzyme announced an agreement to merge\n\nGenetrix, Inc., a Phoenix-based operator of prenatal and cancer genetic testing\n\nlaboratories, with Genzyme in a transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of\n\ninterests. Subject to the approval of the Genetrix shareholders and the\n\nsatisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions, the merger will be\n\nconsummated, with holders of Genetrix stock receiving shares of General Division\n\nStock, and the operations of Genetrix will be included within the diagnostic\n\nservices business of the Genzyme General Division.\n\nThe General Division's diagnostic products business is a leading\n\nindependent supplier of diagnostic components (enzymes, substrates, antibodies\n\nand antigens), bulk reagents and devices (including the Company's Direct LDL(TM)\n\ntest kit) to manufacturers of clinical diagnostic reagents and kits as well as\n\ndirectly to clinical reference laboratories. The division also manufacturers and\n\nsells a\n\n-2-\n\n4\n\nbroad line of antibody and antigen based ELISA test kits. In addition, the\n\ndivision distributes a broad product line of research products to academic,\n\nindustrial and governmental laboratories for use in immunology and cell biology.\n\nThe General Division's pharmaceuticals business develops, manufactures\n\nand sells a range of active drug substances, pharmaceutical intermediates,\n\nsynthetic phospholipids, peptides, biomolecules and chemicals to the\n\npharmaceutical and health care industries. In 1995, the division introduced\n\nMelaPure(TM) brand melatonin, a dietary supplement.\n\nRELATED ENTITIES\n\nSURGICAL AIDS PARTNERSHIP. In 1989, Genzyme sponsored the Surgical Aids\n\nPartnership (the \"Partnership\"), a research and development limited partnership\n\nthat raised $36.75 million through the private placement of limited partnership\n\ninterests and warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. A\n\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Genzyme is the general partner of the Partnership and\n\nholds a 1% partnership interest therein. The General Division entered into a\n\ncontract with the Partnership to perform research and development of products\n\nbased on HA, a naturally-occurring biopolymer, for use as surgical aids to\n\nreduce the incidence and severity of postoperative adhesions and, in\n\narthroscopic procedures, as a synovial fluid replacement for which the General\n\nDivision was reimbursed its costs plus a 10% fee.\n\nUnder the terms of the various agreements between the Partnership and\n\nGenzyme, the Partnership has the exclusive right to sell Seprafilm(TM) (formerly\n\ncalled HAL-F(TM)), Sepracoat(TM) (formerly called HAL-C(TM)), Sepragel(TM)\n\n(formerly called HAL-G(TM)), HAL-S(TM) and other HA-based surgical products in\n\nthe United States and Canada through a joint venture with the General Division\n\n(the \"Joint Venture\"). The General Division was granted back an exclusive\n\nlicense to sell these products outside the United States and Canada subject to a\n\nroyalty on European sales of these products under certain circumstances.\n\nThe Joint Venture was formed in 1989 for the purpose of manufacturing\n\nand marketing the Partnership's products, but is not expected to engage in\n\nactive business until receipt of marketing approval for a product from the FDA.\n\nThe General Division will be reimbursed for its costs of manufacturing the\n\nproducts and will be compensated for its general and administrative services in\n\nan amount to be determined by the venturers. The parties will share in the\n\nprofits and losses of the Joint Venture.\n\nThe Joint Venture will be dissolved (a) upon purchase by the General\n\nDivision of all of the limited partnership interests, (b) if the General\n\nDivision does not exercise its option to purchase the limited partnership\n\ninterests (i) upon the sale, license or other disposition of all or a\n\nsubstantial part of its technology by the Partnership or (ii) upon 90 days'\n\nnotice by either venturer at any time after the expiration of a one-year period\n\ncommencing after the option to purchase the limited partnership interests\n\nexpires, whichever shall first occur, (c) by operation of law, (d) upon the\n\nbankruptcy, retirement, withdrawal or dissolution of Genzyme, (e) upon mutual\n\nconsent of the General Division and the Partnership or (f) upon the election by\n\nthe Partnership if the General Division shall fail to establish to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Partnership that it is capable of and has undertaken to\n\nmanufacture the Joint Venture's requirements for the products for a specified\n\nperiod.\n\n-3-\n\n5\n\nAll of the funds of the Partnership available to fund development of\n\nthe HA Products were spent by the end of the first quarter of 1994. Genzyme\n\nbelieves that additional funds will be required to complete the development,\n\nclinical testing and commercialization of the HA Products. While Genzyme is not\n\nobligated to provide such funding, the option to purchase all of the limited\n\npartnership interests terminates unless Genzyme commits, on an annual basis, to\n\nprovide funding for continuation of the research and development programs for\n\nthe next twelve month period or until receipt of FDA marketing approval for one\n\nof the HA Products is obtained, whichever is shortest. The General Division\n\nfunded these activities in 1994 and 1995 and has committed to fund them for the\n\ntwelve-month period commencing on March 1, 1996.\n\nIn addition, the General Division has the option to buy all of the\n\nlimited partnership interests in the Partnership for an initial payment of\n\neither cash or General Division Stock or a combination thereof, at its option,\n\nequal to 70% of the amount initially invested by the limited partners (which\n\namount will be recovered by the General Division as a credit against subsequent\n\nroyalty payments) and quarterly royalty payments for a period of ten years after\n\nthe buy-out date equal to 10% of product sales in the United States and Canada\n\n(and 6% of such sales in Europe, but only to the extent necessary to meet\n\ncertain projections made in connection with the funding of the Partnership) and\n\n5% of any revenues derived by the General Division from sales in the United\n\nStates and Canada (and 3% in Europe, but only in the instances cited above) of\n\nnon-HA-based products that are competitive with the Partnership's products. The\n\noption to purchase all of the limited partnership interests is exercisable\n\nduring a 90-day period commencing on the last day of the forty-eighth month\n\nafter the first commercial sale of a product by the Joint Venture, but such\n\ncommencement date will be accelerated under certain circumstances.\n\nOn January 30, 1996, Genzyme made a proposal to a special committee of\n\nthe Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership (the \"Special\n\nCommittee\"), offering to purchase substantially all of the assets of the\n\nPartnership for approximately $93 million payable in shares of General Division\n\nStock. Genzyme's offer is subject to several conditions, including that the\n\noffer receive the affirmative vote of two-thirds in interest of the limited\n\npartners of the Partnership and that Genzyme receive satisfactory assurance from\n\nits independent accountants that the purchase may be accounted for as a\n\npurchase of in-process research and development. The Special Committee has\n\nconsulted with its financial and legal advisors in respect of Genzyme's offer\n\nand negotiations between the parties are ongoing. There can be no assurance that\n\nany agreement between the parties will be reached and, if an agreement is\n\nreached, there can be no assurance as to its terms. Failure to reach an\n\nagreement regarding the acquisition of the Partnership's assets by Genzyme will\n\nnot affect the respective rights and obligations of the parties under any of the\n\nexisting agreements between the parties.\n\nGENZYME TRANSGENICS CORPORATION. In February 1993, Genzyme formed\n\nGenzyme Transgenics Corporation (\"GTC\") and transferred to it all assets and\n\nliabilities of its business in the field of transgenic technology as applied to\n\nthe development and production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic and\n\ndiagnostic uses in exchange for shares of GTC's stock. In addition, it\n\nexclusively licensed to GTC all patents, licenses and other intellectual\n\nproperty in the field (excluding that related to CFTR). In July 1993, GTC\n\ncompleted an initial public offering of its common stock, which resulted in net\n\nproceeds to GTC of approximately $11 million, after which Genzyme's ownership\n\ninterest was\n\n-4-\n\n6\n\nreduced to approximately 73%. In 1994, GTC acquired TSI Corporation (\"TSI\")\n\nissuing common stock for the TSI common stock. As a result of that transaction,\n\nGenzyme's percentage ownership of GTC common stock declined to approximately\n\n40%. In February 1995, GTC exercised its put option with Genzyme, originally\n\nentered into at the time of GTC's initial public offering, and the General\n\nDivision thereby purchased an additional 500,000 shares of GTC common stock. In\n\nJune 1995, Genzyme purchased an additional 1,333,333 shares of GTC common stock\n\nin exchange for a $4 million reduction in the amount due from GTC under the\n\nGenzyme - GTC Credit Agreement. In July 1995, Genzyme exchanged 33,945 shares of\n\nGeneral Division Common stock for 475,467 shares of GTC common stock in\n\nconnection with GTC's acquisition of Biodevelopment Laboratories, Inc.\n\nSubsequent to these transactions, Genzyme owns approximately 48% of GTC.\n\nIn March 1996, Genzyme and GTC entered into a Convertible Debt and\n\nDevelopment Funding Agreement under which (i) Genzyme has made available to GTC\n\na $10 million credit line of 7% debt payable on March 31, 1998 and convertible\n\nby either party into shares of GTC common stock, (ii) Genzyme has agreed to fund\n\nthe development costs associated with transgenic recombinant antithrombin III\n\n(\"ATIII\"), and (iii) in exchange for funding such development costs and for\n\nmaking available the credit line, Genzyme has received the right to co-market\n\nATIII with GTC throughout the world, other than Asia.\n\nUnder contractual arrangements between Genzyme and GTC, the General\n\nDivision has, in the past, engaged GTC to perform transgenic research and\n\ndevelopment on CFTR and may engage GTC to perform transgenic research and\n\ndevelopment on other proteins of interest to Genzyme. GTC has contracted with\n\nthe General Division for purification and protein chemistry research and\n\ndevelopment services. Genzyme leases laboratory and office space to GTC and\n\nprovides it with certain administrative and support services for which GTC pays\n\nfees based on Genzyme's costs.\n\nNEOZYME II CORPORATION. In 1992, Genzyme sponsored an initial public\n\noffering by Neozyme II Corporation (\"Neozyme II\") which resulted in gross\n\nproceeds to Neozyme II of approximately $84.5 million from the sale of units\n\n(the \"Neozyme II Units\"). The Neozyme II Units consisted of one share of the\n\ncallable common stock of Neozyme II, one warrant, which expires on December 31,\n\n1996, to purchase one share of General Division Stock and .135 share of TR\n\nStock at a combined exercise price of $38.25 per warrant (the \"Series N\n\nWarrants\") and one warrant to purchase one share of General Division Stock and\n\n.135 share of TR Stock, which may not be exercised unless and until Genzyme's\n\noption to purchase all of the shares of the callable common stock of Neozyme II\n\nterminates unexercised (the \"Callable Warrants\"), in which case the Callable\n\nWarrants will be exercisable for two years. Genzyme has an option (\"the\n\n\"Neozyme II Purchase Option\") to purchase all of the shares of the callable\n\ncommon stock of Neozyme II at any time on or before December 31, 1996. If the\n\nNeozyme II Purchase Option is exercised, the Callable Warrants will terminate.\n\nThe exercise price of the Neozyme II Purchase Option was $83.00 per share on\n\nDecember 31, 1995 and increases monthly thereafter to a final exercise price of\n\n$117.00 per share in December 1996. The exercise price may be paid in cash,\n\nshares of General Division Stock or any combination thereof, at the discretion\n\nof Genzyme. If the Neozyme II Purchase Option is not exercised, the exercise\n\nprice of each Callable Warrant will be equal to the sum of the average of the\n\nclosing sale prices of one share of General Division Stock and .135 share of TR\n\nStock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the exercisability\n\nthereof.\n\n-5-\n\n7\n\nGenzyme has licensed to Neozyme II all technology owned or controlled\n\nand sublicensable by it for use in developing therapeutic products for the\n\ntreatment of cystic fibrosis (the \"Neozyme II Products\") which products may be\n\ncommercialized on a worldwide basis exclusively and royalty-free. The Neozyme II\n\nProducts, which currently include gene therapy and protein replacement products\n\nfor the treatment of CF and a product primarily intended to treat specific\n\ninfections common in CF patients, may be expanded to include other products if\n\nagreed upon by Genzyme and Neozyme II. Neozyme II has engaged the General\n\nDivision to conduct research, development and clinical testing of the Neozyme II\n\nProducts under a research and development agreement and will utilize\n\nsubstantially all of the net proceeds from the offering, including interest\n\nearned thereon, to fund the General Division's activities under the agreement.\n\nGenzyme believes that additional funding will be necessary in order to complete\n\nclinical testing and commercialization of the Neozyme II Products.\n\n-6-\n\n8\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF THE GENERAL DIVISION\n\nTHERAPEUTICS\n\nThe General Division's strategy is to use its technological strengths,\n\nparticularly its ability to modify and produce DNA and proteins and its\n\nexpertise in fermentation, carbohydrate engineering and gene therapy, to develop\n\nsafe and effective therapeutic products for selected markets. The General\n\nDivision is currently selling Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme and has\n\nseveral therapeutic products in various stages of the research, development,\n\nclinical testing and regulatory review processes. Certain of these products are\n\nbeing developed on behalf of the Partnership and Neozyme II. There can be no\n\nassurance that development of any product will be successfully completed or that\n\nFDA approval of any product will be obtained.\n\nGENERAL DIVISION THERAPEUTICS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION/APPLICATION SPONSOR STATUS (1)\n\n------- ---------------------- ------- ----------\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme Treatment of Gaucher GGD Commercial sales\n\ndisease\n\nCerezyme(R) enzyme Treatment of Gaucher GGD Commercial sales\n\ndisease\n\nSeprafilm(TM) bio- Surgical aid for reducing Surgical Aids Marketed in Europe,\n\nresorbable incidence and severity of Partnership approved in Canada,\n\nmembrane postoperative adhesions PMA filed in U.S.\n\nSepracoat(TM) coating Surgical aid for reducing Surgical Aids PMA filed\n\nsolution incidence and severity of Partnership\n\npostoperative adhesions\n\nSepragel(TM) Surgical aid for reducing Surgical Aids Preclinical\n\nbioresorbable gel incidence and severity of Partnership development\n\npostoperative adhesions\n\nHAL-S(TM) synovial Orthopedic surgical aid Surgical Aids Pivotal clinical\n\nfluid replacement Partnership trials\n\nThyrogen(R) hormone Adjunct for diagnosis and GGD Confirmatory\n\ntherapy of thyroid cancer pivotal study\n\nTretinoin(LF) Treatment of cancers GGD (conducted Phase II clinical\n\nby Aronex) trials\n\nAntithrombin III Treatment of ATIII GTC Preclinical\n\ndeficiencies development\n\nCFTR Treatment of cystic Neozyme II Research\n\nfibrosis\n\nHyperGAM(TM)+CF Treatment and prevention of Neozyme II Phase II clinical\n\nPseudomonas infections in (Conducted by trials\n\ncystic fibrosis patients NABI)\n\n-7-\n\n9\n\n- --------------------------\n\n(1) RESEARCH status indicates work up to and including small scale\n\nproduction of the targeted product. PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT status\n\nincludes work done to increase yields and standardize manufacturing\n\nprocesses and studies in animals to support an application to the FDA\n\nto commence clinical testing in humans. Human clinical trials for\n\nproducts classified by the FDA as \"drugs\" or \"biologics\" are generally\n\nconducted in three phases: PHASE I, to determine safety and\n\npharmacokinetics; PHASE II, to provide preliminary evidence of\n\nefficacy; and PHASE III, sometimes referred to as PIVOTAL TRIALS, to\n\nprovide data for proof of safety and effectiveness. Following\n\ncompletion of the clinical studies, an application for marketing\n\napproval of a new drug (an \"NDA\") or licensure of a biological product\n\n(a \"PLA\") is submitted to the FDA. Clinical trials for products\n\nclassified by the FDA as \"devices\" are generally conducted in two\n\nphases: INITIAL STUDIES to evaluate safety and feasibility, followed by\n\nEXPANDED TRIALS to prove safety and effectiveness. An application for\n\nmarketing approval (a \"PMA\") is then submitted to the FDA.\n\nCEREDASE(R) ENZYME (ALGLUCERASE INJECTION) AND CEREZYME(R) ENZYME\n\n(IMIGLUCERASE FOR INJECTION). Treatment with Ceredase(R) or Cerezyme(R) enzyme\n\nreplacement therapy currently represents the only safe and effective treatment\n\nfor Gaucher disease, a seriously debilitating, sometimes fatal genetic disorder\n\ncaused by a deficiency in an important enzyme in the body called\n\nglucocerebrosidase (\"GCR\"). This deficiency results in the accumulation of the\n\nlipid glucocerebroside in the body. The disease is characterized by an enlarged\n\nliver or spleen, anemia, bleeding problems, bone and joint pain, fatigue and\n\northopedic complications such as repeated fractures and bone erosion.\n\nCeredase(R) is a modified form of human GCR in which glycoprotein remodeling\n\ntechnology has been used to target GCR to the cells where the lipid accumulation\n\noccurs. Cerezyme(R) is a recombinant form of GCR which has been remodeled in a\n\nsimilar manner.\n\nThe General Division is marketing these products directly to\n\nphysicians, hospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained\n\nsales force. The worldwide marketing effort is directed at identifying and\n\ninitiating treatment for the 5,000 Gaucher patients the General Division\n\nbelieves exist worldwide. Currently, approximately one-third of these patients\n\nare receiving treatment. Ceredase(R) is available in approximately 43 countries\n\nworldwide. The product has received marketing approval in 11 countries with\n\napplications pending in 4 countries.\n\nThe General Division produces Ceredase(R) enzyme from raw material\n\nextracted from human placental tissue. Pasteur Merieux, located in France, is\n\nthe only significant commercial source of this material. The supply of starting\n\nmaterial available for the production of Ceredase(R) enzyme effectively limits\n\nthe amount of product that can be produced. The current available supply is not\n\nsufficient to produce enough Ceredase(R) enzyme to supply all present patients.\n\nAny disruption in the manufacturing process for Ceredase(R) enzyme may have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the division's revenues in any period.\n\nTo address supply constraints for Ceredase(R) enzyme, which is limited\n\nby the amount of new material available from human placental tissue, the General\n\nDivision has developed Cerezyme(R) enzyme. Cerezyme(R) is a recombinant form of\n\nmodified GCR which has been shown in human clinical trials to be equivalent to\n\nCeredase(R) in its safety and effectiveness in the treatment of Gaucher disease.\n\nIn May 1994, Genzyme received U.S. marketing approval for Cerezyme(R) from the\n\nFDA. Cerezyme(R) has also received marketing approval in Israel and Sweden and\n\nis available on a named-patient basis in Canada, Germany and Brazil. The General\n\nDivision is presently producing Cerezyme(R) enzyme in its small-scale\n\nmanufacturing plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. A large scale mammalian cell\n\nmanufacturing facility located in Boston, Massachusetts is undergoing validation\n\nand review prior to application for FDA approval to use it for full-scale\n\nmanufacturing of Cerezyme(R) enzyme, which application is expected to be\n\nsubmitted in 1996. See Item 2. \"Properties.\" The General Division believes that\n\nsales of Cerezyme(R) enzyme will gradually supplant sales of Ceredase(R) enzyme.\n\nAlthough protein replacement is currently the only existing therapy for\n\nGaucher disease, the General Division is collaborating with a university and a\n\n-8-\n\n10\n\ngene therapy company to develop a gene therapy for Gaucher disease. These\n\nefforts are in the research stage.\n\nHA PRODUCTS. The General Division is developing the HA Products to be\n\nused during surgical procedures to limit the formation of postoperative\n\nadhesions and, in arthroscopic procedures of the joints, as a synovial fluid\n\nreplacement.\n\nAdhesions are fibrous structures that connect tissues or organ surfaces\n\nthat are not normally joined. They are an undesirable side effect of the body's\n\nnormal healing process following damage to tissue. Adhesions can cause\n\nsignificant complications such as bowel obstruction following abdominal surgery,\n\ninfertility and pain following gynecological surgery and restricted limb motion\n\nfollowing musculoskeletal surgery. Moreover, adhesions that form as a result of\n\ncardiac surgery can increase the complexity, duration and risk of subsequent\n\ncardiac surgery. The General Division believes that approximately 6.6 million of\n\nthe 36 million abdominal, gynecologic, musculoskeletal and cardiac surgical\n\nprocedures performed each year in the U.S. could benefit from the use of the HA\n\nProducts, as could the comparable number of these procedures that are performed\n\neach year outside the U.S.\n\nThe division currently is developing the following HA-based products:\n\n- SEPRAFILM(TM) BIORESORBABLE MEMBRANE is a solid formulation of modified\n\nHA and is used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been\n\ndamaged by surgery. The membrane is designed to last several days in the\n\nbody.\n\n- SEPRACOAT(TM) COATING SOLUTION is a liquid formulation of HA that, when\n\nused to coat tissues and organ surfaces at the start of and throughout\n\nsurgical procedures, forms a temporary physical barrier that may protect\n\ntissues during surgery.\n\n- SEPRAGEL(TM) BIORESORBABLE GEL is a highly viscous gel form of modified\n\nHA and is intended to be used to separate and protect tissues and organs\n\nthat have been damaged by surgery. Sepragel(TM) is intended to be used in\n\nlaporoscopic procedures and on tissue surfaces that are inaccessible to\n\nSeprafilm(TM). Similar to Seprafilm(TM), the gel is designed to last\n\nseveral days in the body.\n\n- HAL-S(TM) SYNOVIAL FLUID REPLACEMENT is a liquid formulation of HA\n\nintended to be used during arthroscopic surgery to maintain normal joint\n\nfunction and to reduce pain and inflammation following surgery.\n\nThe programs to develop the four HA Products achieved a number of\n\nsignificant milestones in 1995. Two pivotal clinical trials for Seprafilm(TM)\n\nbioresorbable membrane were completed during 1995, one in abdominal surgery and\n\nthe other in gynecological surgery. The results of each of these studies\n\nindicated that use of Seprafilm(TM) significantly reduced the incidence, extent\n\nand severity of adhesions following surgery. Based on these results, a PMA was\n\nfiled with the FDA in October 1995 for approval to market Seprafilm(TM) in the\n\nU.S. for abdominal and gynecological applications.\n\nOn March 25, 1996, an advisory panel of the FDA recommended that\n\napproval be granted to market Seprafilm(TM) to reduce postoperative adhesion\n\nformation in both types of surgery studied in the two pivotal clinical trials\n\nconducted for\n\n-9-\n\n11\n\nSeprafilm(TM). The panel's recommendation for approval was conditioned on a\n\nrequirement that post-marketing surveillance be conducted to monitor possible\n\nadverse events. The panel's recommendation will be considered in the FDA's\n\nfinal review of the PMA for Seprafilm(TM), but is not binding upon the FDA.\n\nClinical trials for Sepracoat(TM) coating were completed in 1995. In\n\nOctober 1995, Genzyme announced that the results of this study indicated that\n\nuse of Sepracoat(TM) significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative\n\nadhesions. In January 1996, Genzyme filed a PMA to market Sepracoat(TM) for use\n\nin abdominal, pelvic and cardio-thoracic surgical procedures. The FDA has\n\nnotified Genzyme that the Sepracoat(TM) PMA will receive expedited review.\n\nA clinical trial for HAL-S(TM) synovial fluid replacement was completed\n\nin November 1995. The results of this study have been collected and currently\n\nare being reviewed and analyzed and are expected to be made available during the\n\nfirst half of 1996. If the results of the study show HAL-S(TM) to be safe and\n\neffective, a PMA to market HAL-S(TM) for such procedures will be filed with the\n\nFDA.\n\nGenzyme is currently developing a clinical strategy and conducting\n\nstability studies in anticipation of filing an investigational device exemption\n\n(an \"IDE\") with the FDA for Sepragel(TM) bioresorbable gel during 1996. Clinical\n\ntrials of Sepragel(TM) will commence soon after receipt of the IDE.\n\nGenzyme, on behalf of the Joint Venture, is in the process of preparing\n\nfor marketing of Seprafilm(TM) in the U.S. and Canada. Genzyme has received\n\napproval in Canada to market Seprafilm(TM) bioresorbable membrane on behalf of\n\nthe Joint Venture and has received authorization from the FDA to export the\n\nproduct to Canada. Test marketing in Canada is expected to begin during 1996.\n\nGenzyme has, for its own account, initiated marketing efforts for\n\nSeprafilm(TM) in Europe. Genzyme has been notified by regulatory agencies in the\n\nNetherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland that such agencies have no objection to\n\nGenzyme marketing Seprafilm(TM) in those countries at this time. Authorization\n\nfrom the FDA for export of the product to these four countries has been\n\nobtained, and Genzyme began test marketing Seprafilm(TM) in the Netherlands late\n\nin 1995. In February 1996, Genzyme obtained notification that Seprafilm(TM) had\n\nbeen granted the Approval of Conformity Certificate (a \"CE Mark\") in accordance\n\nwith the European Community (\"EC\") Medical Devices Directive. The CE Mark\n\nsignifies that a product meets quality standards necessary for marketing in the\n\nEC and will allow introduction of Seprafilm(TM) more rapidly into Europe.\n\nGenzyme believes that successful initial market penetration and\n\nsubsequent maintenance of market share for Seprafilm(TM) and Sepracoat(TM) may\n\nrequire a specialized hospital-based sales force. A substantial effort to\n\neducate surgeons and hospital administrators as to the benefits of these\n\nproducts will be required in order for the products to gain broad market\n\nacceptance. The efforts to develop marketing and sales capabilities are at an\n\nearly stage. Significant additional resources will be required to penetrate\n\ntarget markets.\n\nFunding for the development of all four of these products has been\n\nprovided by the Partnership, which has the exclusive right to commercialize\n\nthese products\n\n-10-\n\n12\n\nin the United States and Canada through the Joint Venture The Partnership also\n\nhas the right to a royalty on the General Division's European sales of these\n\nproducts under certain circumstances. Early in 1994, the General Division began\n\nfunding development of these products on behalf of the Partnership and has\n\ncommitted to continue such funding for the 12 months commencing March 1, 1996.\n\nSee \"Related Entities -- Surgical Aids Partnership.\"\n\nTHYROGEN(R) HORMONE. The General Division is developing Thyrogen(R)\n\nhormone, a recombinant form of human thyroid stimulating hormone (\"TSH\"), which\n\nis intended for use as an adjunct to the approximately 100,000 to 200,000\n\ndiagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken each year to detect and treat\n\nmetastases of thyroid cancer. The General Division believes that the\n\nadministration of Thyrogen(R) hormone may be more effective and result in fewer\n\nadverse side effects for patients undergoing current standard medical procedures\n\nfor thyroid cancer.\n\nThyrogen(R) hormone was demonstrated to be safe and effective in\n\nstimulating the uptake of radioiodine for whole body scanning in a 1992 Phase\n\nI/II clinical study. A Phase III multi-center clinical study completed late in\n\n1993 provided evidence that the use of Thyrogen(R) hormone prior to diagnostic\n\nscanning greatly improved the quality of life in 94% of thyroid cancer patients\n\ntested and was effective in producing scans that were as good as or better than\n\nconventional scans in 86%. To confirm the results of this study, the General\n\nDivision is conducting a second Phase III study. During 1996 it is anticipated\n\nthat Thyrogen(R) hormone will be made available to patients who meet certain\n\ncriteria under a treatment IND which will allow Genzyme to gather additional\n\ninformation regarding use of the product while recovering appropriate costs of\n\nthe product and the treatment.\n\nTRETINOIN(LF). The General Division is collaborating with Aronex to\n\ndevelop and commercialize a proprietary liposomal formulation of the retinoid\n\nknown as all-trans retinoic acid (\"Tretinoin(LF)\") for the treatment of cancer.\n\nThe initial indications chosen for clinical development of Tretinoin(LF) are\n\nacute promyelocytic leukemia and Kaposi's sarcoma. The General Division and\n\nAronex believe that Tretinoin(LF) will also have application in the treatment of\n\nother cancers. Although numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy\n\nof oral retinoids against certain cancers, the use of these drugs has been\n\nlimited because patients often develop intolerance to the drug followed by\n\nrelapse of their cancers. The General Division and Aronex believe that\n\nTretinoin(LF) will overcome these limitations. Separate Phase II clinical trials\n\nof Tretinoin(LF) for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and of Kaposi's\n\nsarcoma are currently ongoing.\n\nPursuant to the agreements with Aronex, the General Division made a $5\n\nmillion equity investment in Aronex and is required to make milestone payments\n\ntotaling $1.5 million and share in the development funding for the project. The\n\nGeneral Division also has an obligation to make an additional equity investment\n\nof $5 million in Aronex following the occurrence of a clinical milestone.\n\nANTITHROMBIN III (ATIII). ATIII is a human blood protein which acts as\n\nan anticoagulant. Depressed levels of ATIII can lead to increased risk of\n\nthrombosis (clotting) in patients with either hereditary ATIII deficiency or an\n\nacquired ATIII deficiency often associated with multiple disease states, such as\n\nsepsis, various surgeries, multiple trauma and liver disease.\n\n-11-\n\n13\n\nNatural ATIII derived from donated human plasma currently is sold\n\nworldwide for multiple indications. The General Division is funding efforts at\n\nGTC to develop a transgenic source for ATIII to address anticipated growth in\n\nvolume requirements in the market to treat ATIII deficiency by protein\n\nreplacement therapy. The General Division believes that current sources of\n\nplasma derived ATIII will be inadequate to address this growth. In combination\n\nwith Tufts and SMIG, GTC has developed a herd of transgenic goats at its\n\nproduction facility in central Massachusetts. These goats have produced active\n\nrecombinant ATIII. GTC is preparing to file an IND to initiate a Phase I\n\nclinical trial of ATIII and anticipates conducting this trial during 1996. The\n\nGeneral Division is funding this development work through a recently concluded\n\ndevelopment funding and co-marketing agreement under which the General Division\n\nhas obtained co-marketing rights for the product outside of Asia.\n\nCYSTIC FIBROSIS. On behalf of Neozyme II, the General Division is\n\nengaged in research, development and clinical testing of biotherapeutic products\n\nfor the treatment of cystic fibrosis by gene therapy or protein replacement\n\ntherapy and for the treatment and prevention of Pseudomonas bacteria infections\n\nin CF patients (the \"CF Products\").\n\nCF is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting the Caucasian\n\npopulation. Approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States is\n\nborn with the disease and there currently are approximately 30,000 cystic\n\nfibrosis patients in North America. CF is caused by a mutation in the gene\n\nresponsible for determining the molecular structure of a protein called cystic\n\nfibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (\"CFTR\"). Although improvements\n\nhave been made over the last 20 years in alleviating certain symptoms of the\n\ndisease and delaying its progress, the underlying disease remains untreated and\n\npatients have an average life expectancy of only 29 years.\n\nThe General Division's work has initially concentrated on two promising\n\napproaches to correct the basic defect in CF cells: gene therapy, to augment the\n\nmutant genes with genes that would enable the patient's cells to produce normal\n\nCFTR protein and protein replacement therapy to replace the missing or defective\n\nCFTR protein with properly functioning CFTR protein. For technical and\n\ncompetitive reasons, the gene therapy approach has been emphasized during the\n\nlast two years, and currently the protein replacement program is largely\n\ninactive.\n\nGene Therapy. In October 1993, results of a study approved by the\n\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee (the \"RAC\") of the National Institutes of\n\nHealth (the \"NIH\") showed that it is possible to correct the biochemical defect\n\nin cystic fibrosis cells in vivo. The study results were the first published\n\nreport of a successful gene transfer in cystic fibrosis patients and the first\n\nsuccessful application of an adenovirus vector in gene therapy. In December\n\n1993, one of the General Division's collaborators received RAC approval for a\n\nstudy involving repeat administration of the General Division's second\n\ngeneration adenovirus vector to the nasal epithelium and sinus passages of CF\n\npatients. The nasal part of the study was completed in the second quarter of\n\n1995. Aggregated data from this study showed limited evidence of gene expression\n\nat the intermediate doses but not at the highest dose. The virus appeared safe,\n\nbut a complex immune response to the adenovirus was measured in almost all\n\npatients. This and other data obtained in animal studies suggests that immune\n\nresponse may limit the efficacy of repeat dose therapy with adenovirus.\n\n-12-\n\n14\n\nA two part safety study of Genzyme's second generation adenovirus\n\nvector administered via bronchoscope and aerosol involving 40 CF patients\n\ncommenced during 1995 and is currently on-going. In September, Genzyme switched\n\nto the use of a third-generation adenovirus vector with an improved safety\n\nprofile as part of this same study.\n\nIn parallel with the early phase clinical studies, the General Division\n\nis conducting extensive research into improving the safety and efficacy of\n\nadenovirus. Particular emphasis is being placed on immunology, since it is\n\nhighly likely that new vectors or methods need to be developed so as to reduce\n\nthe patient's immune response and to increase the efficacy of adenovirus\n\nvectors. Such improvements may be necessary in order for adenovirus vectors to\n\nbe clinically useful in chronic therapy.\n\nIn addition to its work with viral vectors, the General Division is\n\ndeveloping, both internally and in collaboration with others, alternative\n\ntechnologies for the delivery of CFTR to CF patients. To date, the most\n\nsignificant collaborative arrangement is an exclusive research agreement with\n\nVical, Inc. to evaluate that company's cytofectins as non-viral delivery vectors\n\nfor treating cystic fibrosis. Although substantial progress has been made in\n\nthis work, currently the optimal formulation of the best of these alternatives\n\nis still less efficient that adenovirus.\n\nDuring 1994, the General Division initiated a collaboration with a\n\nBritish academic group in gene therapy utilizing lipids. Another of the General\n\nDivision's collaborators commenced a study in 1995 of a CF nasal protocol\n\nutilizing a lipid-DNA complex containing one of Vical's proprietary cytofectins\n\nwhich is currently on-going. A nasal study involving a proprietary lipid-DNA\n\ncomplex developed by Genzyme commenced in January 1996.\n\nBecause of the innovative nature of gene therapy and public policy\n\nissues surrounding the insertion of new genetic information into cells, the\n\nGeneral Division expects that early clinical evaluation will continue to entail\n\nespecially careful testing in a limited number of patients. The General Division\n\nexpects to continue preliminary clinical testing of its gene therapy products in\n\n1996. The timing and results of these initial studies will determine whether and\n\nwhen pivotal trials to determine safety and effectiveness will be undertaken.\n\nThese pivotal trials may involve large groups of patients for lengthy periods of\n\ntime in order to address the uncertainties surrounding insertion of new genetic\n\ninformation into humans and to show clinical effectiveness in the treatment of a\n\nprogressive disease.\n\nProtein Replacement Therapy. CFTR is a membrane protein, a class of\n\nmolecules which historically has been difficult to produce in conventional cell\n\nculture in active form and in quantities. Genzyme, however, has developed\n\nrecombinant cell lines that synthesize the protein and, in collaboration with\n\nresearchers at GTC and elsewhere, has used transgenic expression techniques to\n\nbreed mice and rabbits which secrete human CFTR protein in their milk. Based on\n\nthese results, Genzyme engaged GTC to develop transgenic goats that express\n\nCFTR protein in their milk. Although one transgenic goat was born, it did not\n\nsynthesize measurable CFTR in its milk and no further work is currently\n\nunderway.\n\nHYPERGAM(TM)+CF. The General Division is developing vaccine and passive\n\nimmunization antibody-based products to treat and prevent Pseudomonas\n\ninfections. The majority of cystic fibrosis patients suffer from lung infections\n\ncaused by\n\n-13-\n\n15\n\nthis bacteria, a major medical problem and a frequent cause of hospitalization.\n\nIn many cases, the immediate cause of death in CF patients is pulmonary failure\n\nassociated with these infections.\n\nThe General Division is collaborating on this project with NABI. NABI\n\nis employing an exclusively licensed proprietary technology to develop\n\nHyperGAM(TM)+CF for use in passively immunizing CF patients infected with the\n\nbacteria. A Phase I clinical trial involving single dose administration of\n\nHyperGAM(TM)+CF was completed in 1994 and showed that HyperGAM(TM)+CF appears to\n\nbe safe. A multi-center, dose ranging Phase II trial to assess safety and\n\nefficacy of the product in chronic administration commenced in the first quarter\n\nof 1995 and enrollment was completed in the first quarter of 1996.\n\nThe General Division believes that HyperGAM(TM)+CF may be complementary\n\nto its gene therapy and protein replacement therapy products in treating or\n\npreventing Pseudomonas infections in conjunction with correcting the basic\n\ndefect in airway cells. However, it is possible that the gene therapy and\n\nprotein replacement products may result in an effective therapy for CF which,\n\nover time, would reduce or obviate the need for a Pseudomonas treatment.\n\nPursuant to the agreement with NABI, the General Division made a $5\n\nmillion equity investment in NABI and is required to fund two-thirds of the\n\ndevelopment program costs and make certain milestone payments associated with\n\nthe progress of clinical trials. NABI will manufacture the product and the\n\nGeneral Division will market it on a worldwide basis. Neozyme II funds the\n\nGeneral Division's obligations to provide development funding and make milestone\n\npayments to NABI in exchange for the exclusive rights that the General Division\n\nacquired to market HyperGAM(TM)+CF on a worldwide basis and the right to its\n\nshare of the profits resulting from commercialization of the product.\n\nTRANSGENICS. GTC, Genzyme's 48%-owned affiliate, has developed methods\n\nof protein production in transgenic animals and has produced significant\n\nquantities of several human proteins, including CFTR, ATIII, alpha one\n\nanti-trypsin and longer acting tissue plasminogen activator, in the milk of\n\nanimals, including mice and goats. Transgenic production of a human protein is\n\nachieved by inserting a gene that directs the production of a desired protein\n\ninto the genetic material of an animal such that the target protein is secreted\n\nin the milk of female offspring. GTC believes that transgenic production offers\n\nsignificant economic and technological advantages over traditional protein\n\nproduction systems. GTC's strategy is focused on utilizing this technology to\n\ndevelop and produce a broad range of proteins, both in collaboration with\n\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and independently. GTC's work in\n\ndeveloping transgenic recombinant ATIII is funded by the General Division under\n\na funding and co-marketing agreement entered into in March 1996. See \"Related\n\nEntities -- Genzyme Transgenics Corporation.\"\n\nGTC is working with the General Division and with a number of\n\nbiopharmaceutical companies on feasibility studies regarding the transgenic\n\nproduction of specific proteins. During 1995, GTC completed and opened a\n\ntransgenic production facility in central Massachusetts that utilizes transgenic\n\ngoats. A specially selected goat herd was imported from New Zealand from which\n\ntransgenic animals will be bred to produce pharmaceutical proteins.\n\nIn October 1994, GTC acquired TSI, a leading provider of preclinical\n\ntesting and manufacturing support services primarily to pharmaceutical,\n\nbiotechnology and\n\n-14-\n\n16\n\nchemical companies. This acquisition was undertaken in order to expand GTC's\n\nbusiness operations and provide a more comprehensive offering of support\n\nservices to its customers. GTC's testing businesses offer broad scientific\n\ncapabilities in such fields as preclinical efficacy models, teratology,\n\nphotobiology, surgery and continuous infusion. For the year ended December 31,\n\n1995, the testing businesses had revenues of approximately $26 million.\n\n-15-\n\n17\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SERVICES\n\nThe General Division's diagnostic services business unit, which\n\noperates under the trade-name of Integrated Genetics, applies advanced\n\nbiotechnology to develop and provide high quality, sophisticated genetic\n\ndiagnostic services to physicians, hospitals, universities, medical centers,\n\nclinical laboratories, genetic centers and managed care organizations throughout\n\nthe United States and internationally. The General Division also provides\n\nidentity testing services to state and local government agencies, attorneys and\n\nvarious courts in the U.S., as well as donor typing to bone marrow registries.\n\nOn October 2, 1995, Genzyme acquired all of the publicly-owned shares\n\nof IG and IG was merged into the General Division. See \"Related Parties.\" In\n\nFebruary 1996, Genzyme announced an agreement to merge Genetrix, Inc., a\n\nPhoenix-based operator of prenatal and cancer genetic testing laboratories, with\n\nGenzyme in a transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Subject\n\nto the approval of the Genetrix shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of\n\ncertain other conditions, the merger will be consummated, with holders of\n\nGenetrix stock receiving shares of General Division Stock, and the operations of\n\nGenetrix will be included within the diagnostic services business of the General\n\nDivision.\n\nGENERAL DIVISION DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES PORTFOLIO\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION/APPLICATION STATUS\n\n------- ---------------------- ------\n\nBiochemical testing Screening for certain fetal Commercial\n\nchromosomal abnormalities service\n\nPrenatal cytogenetics Detection of fetal chromosomal Commercial\n\nabnormalities service\n\nInSight(R) molecular genetic Rapid detection of selected fetal Commercial\n\ntesting chromosomal abnormalities service\n\nDNA testing Detection of single gene disorders Commercial\n\n(CF, Fragile X, Huntington Disease, service\n\nGaucher Disease, etc.)\n\nCancer Testing -- cancer Applications used singly or in tandem Commercial\n\ncytogenetics, flow cyto- for detection and prognosis of service\n\nmetry, fluorescent in-situ various forms of cancer\n\nhybridization \"FISH\", DNA\n\nFetal cell separation Detection of fetal chromosomal Preclinical\n\nabnormalities development\n\nIdentity testing Establishing paternity and identifying Commercial\n\npotential bone marrow transplant service\n\ndonors\n\nPRENATAL AND POSTNATAL GENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The General\n\nDivision offers three types of genetic diagnostic services: biochemical testing,\n\nclassical and molecular cytogenetic testing, and DNA testing. Biochemical\n\ntesting services consist primarily of a widely used screening test (AFP(3)) used\n\nto determine if further prenatal genetic testing is appropriate. Classical and\n\n-16-\n\n18\n\nmolecular cytogenetic testing involves the analysis of fetal cells obtained\n\nthrough amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling (\"CVS\") to evaluate\n\nchromosomal abnormalities. DNA analysis is performed to determine the likelihood\n\nthat the subject has, or is a carrier for, a specific genetic disorder.\n\nThe market for these services has experienced significant growth in\n\nrecent years. The General Division's strategy is to expand its genetic\n\ndiagnostics business by providing a comprehensive range of high quality testing\n\nservices in a timely, accurate and convenient manner; by aggressively marketing\n\nits services through a direct sales force; and by maintaining an active research\n\nand development program that enables it to introduce additional testing services\n\nbased on new technologies. The Division also has an active program to expand its\n\nlaboratory operations through acquisition.\n\nThe InSight(R) test, a faster cytogenetic test based on in situ\n\nhybridization of chromosome-specific DNA probes, was introduced by Integrated\n\nGenetics in 1991. This technology permits identification of the most frequently\n\noccurring chromosomal abnormalities within 48 hours, as compared to the one to\n\nthree weeks required to perform classical cytogenetic testing (karyotyping). The\n\nInSight(R) analysis is offered in conjunction with a complete karyotype. Cancer\n\ndiagnostic services based on cytogenetics and a series of supporting tests\n\ncurrently focus primarily on various forms of leukemias and lymphomas.\n\nThe General Division also provides testing for numerous genetic\n\ndiseases including, fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington\n\ndisease, polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, and hemophilia. Its\n\ncurrent cystic fibrosis test, launched in 1994, uses samples of cells collected\n\nby using a simple cheek brush and is capable of detecting more possible genetic\n\nmutations (32), more rapidly and at lower cost than methods previously\n\navailable.\n\nGENETIC IDENTITY TESTING SERVICES. The General Division also provides\n\nidentity testing services principally to state and local government agencies and\n\ncourts throughout the United States from its high volume testing laboratory in\n\nNorth Carolina. Both classical blood tests and DNA tests are used to provide\n\ncustomers with reports as to the likelihood of paternity. Testing services are\n\nalso performed to provide forensic medical evidence which is used to identify\n\nsuspects involved in violent crimes and DNA testing is offered to bone marrow\n\nregistries attempting to match potential donors with transplant patients.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. The General Division maintains an active program\n\naimed at identifying and developing new technologies and methods of performing\n\ngenetic tests and applying these methods to improve and expand its menu of\n\ntesting services. In its own research laboratories and in collaboration with\n\nothers, Integrated Genetics conducts major research and development programs in\n\nsuch areas as genomics, test platforms for complex mutational analysis,\n\npredispositional testing for cancer and other late onset diseases, and rare cell\n\nseparation and analysis methods.\n\nSince introduction of the first generation InSight(R) rapid cytogenetic\n\nanalysis test in 1991, the Company has developed numerous other FISH probes and\n\nvarious DNA tests, including a sophisticated 32-mutation cystic fibrosis cheek\n\nbrush test. In 1995, proprietary new multiple allele specific diagnostic assay\n\n(\"MASDA\") technology was introduced. MASDA is an efficient, accurate and cost\n\neffective DNA test method for high throughput complex mutational analysis which\n\ncan simultaneously detect more than one hundred known mutations in hundreds of\n\n-17-\n\n19\n\npatient samples. Also in 1995, the genomics group, together with their\n\ncollaborators, announced the full identification of the PKD1 gene, which causes\n\npolycystic kidney disease, a common genetic disorder that leads to renal failure\n\nby middle age in most affected individuals. This group is also involved in the\n\ndiscovery of the gene for the most common cause of inherited cardiac arrhythmia,\n\nlong QT syndrome, also known as \"sudden death syndrome.\"\n\nThe General Division is now beginning to use the MASDA technology in\n\nits in-house predispositional assay development. This program is aimed at\n\nidentifying causative genetic mutations associated with various cancers and\n\ncertain other diseases where the ability to test a large number of genetic\n\nmutations is critical. Work in the genomics program continues to focus on\n\nfinding and understanding important genes that have a potential diagnostic and\n\ntherapeutic use for various sectors of Genzyme's businesses.\n\nThe General Division continues its efforts to develop methods and\n\nprocedures to isolate and genetically analyze fetal cells obtained from maternal\n\nblood samples. The program has demonstrated the feasibility of a separation\n\ntechnology involving the use of combinations of antibodies that bind selectively\n\nto specific cell types and has developed appropriate immobilization and\n\nanalytical methods. However, at this point, the process does not meet the\n\nDivision's consistency standards well enough to commercialize it as a high\n\nquality diagnostic test.\n\nFetal cells obtained from maternal blood serum could potentially be\n\nused in lieu of cells derived from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi for genetic\n\ntesting, thereby avoiding the risk associated with amniocentesis or CVS. The\n\nGeneral Division believes that successful development of techniques which permit\n\nprenatal genetic testing of samples obtained from mothers on a low risk basis,\n\nusing rapid low cost detection methods such as InSight(R), can result in a\n\nsubstantial expansion of the market for prenatal testing. Significant resources\n\ncontinue to be focused on this research program.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS\n\nThe General Division is a leading independent supplier of diagnostic\n\ncomponents (enzymes, substrates, antibodies and antigens), bulk reagents and\n\ndevices to manufacturers of clinical diagnostic reagents and kits as well as\n\ndirectly to clinical reference laboratories. The division also manufactures and\n\nsells a broad line of antibody and antigen based ELISA test kits. In addition,\n\nthe division distributes a broad product line of research products to academic,\n\nindustrial and governmental laboratories for use in immunology and cell biology.\n\nThe Diagnostic Products Division has manufacturing expertise in enzyme\n\nfermentation, purification, reagent formulation and immunoassay test\n\ndevelopment.\n\nGENERAL DIVISION DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS PORTFOLIO\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION/APPLICATION STATUS\n\n------- ---------------------- ------\n\nCardiovascular products -- Clinical diagnostic testing Product sales\n\nDirect LDL(TM), HDL\n\nDiagnostic intermediates, Manufacture of bulk diagnostic products Product sales\n\ncomponents and bulk for blood analysis and raw materials\n\nreagents for use in clinical chemistry reagents\n\n-18-\n\n20\n\nELISA test kits Immunodiagnostic kits for blood analysis Product sales\n\nResearch products Research in immunology and cell biology Product sales\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR PRODUCTS. The General Division sells devices and\n\nreagents for the quantification of LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. In\n\nparticular, the General Division has developed and commercialized an in vitro\n\ndiagnostic test kit (the Direct LDL(TM) test kit) for the direct measurement of\n\nLDL cholesterol in blood samples. The correlation between elevated blood\n\ncholesterol levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease, one of the\n\nleading causes of death in the United States, is well established. A high level\n\nof LDL cholesterol in the blood indicates an increased risk of coronary heart\n\ndisease. Prior to the approval of the division's kit, there was no routine\n\ndirect standardized test for measuring LDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol\n\nlevels were derived using several indirect measurements and estimates, each\n\ncontributing a potential source of error to the calculation.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERMEDIATES. The General Division produces and sells\n\ncritical components such as diagnostic enzymes, substrates, proteins and\n\nreagents for use in diagnostic kits used for blood analysis in clinical\n\nchemistry laboratories. One primary diagnostic area of emphasis for the General\n\nDivision is pancreatic function, where it provides enzymes, substrates, bulk\n\nreagents and patented methodologies for amylase and lipase determination to\n\ndiagnostic kit manufacturers. For cardiovascular health, the General Division is\n\na leading supplier of cholesterol enzymes used in testing for coronary heart\n\ndisease. Sales of its diagnostic intermediates are made to over 200\n\nmanufacturers and users of diagnostic kits worldwide through its own technical\n\nsales representatives in the U.S. and Europe and through distributors in Japan.\n\nELISA TEST KITS. The General Division manufactures and sells a broad\n\nrange of ELISA test kits for infectious disease and endocrinology\n\ndeterminations. In addition, it supplies monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies\n\nplus other immunoassay components to immunodiagnostic kit manufacturers.\n\nFinally, the General Division supplies patented Contrast(TM) rapid tests for\n\npregnancy and Strep A determination.\n\nRESEARCH PRODUCTS. The General Division's research products consist of\n\na comprehensive line of cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, proteins and\n\nELISA systems which play an integral role in activating and modulating the\n\nbody's immune system. These research products are used primarily to conduct\n\nresearch in the areas of immunology and cellular biology.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS DIVISION\n\nThe General Division develops, manufactures and sells a range of active\n\ndrug substances, pharmaceutical intermediates, synthetic phospholipids,\n\npeptides, biomolecules and chemicals to the pharmaceutical and health care\n\nindustries. These products utilize the division's capabilities in multi-step\n\norganic chemical synthesis, fermentation, enzymology and carbohydrate\n\ntechnology.\n\nGENERAL DIVISION PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION/APPLICATION STATUS\n\n------- ---------------------- ------\n\nMelaPure(TM) Melatonin Dietary Supplement Product sales\n\n-19-\n\n21\n\nClindamycin phosphate Treatment of serious infections Product sales\n\nHyaluronic Acid Ophthalmic products & research Product sales\n\napplications\n\nActive drug substances and Production of oral and parenteral Product sales\n\npharmaceutical drugs\n\nintermediates\n\nFine chemicals Production of pharmaceutical inter- Product sales\n\nmediates, & electronic chemicals\n\nSynthetic phospholipids Drug delivery systems and Product sales\n\npharmaceutical components\n\nSynthetic peptides Production of final dosage form Product sales\n\ntherapeutics\n\nAmino acid derivatives Production of synthetic peptides Product sales\n\nBiomolecules Bioprocessing and reagents Product sales\n\nMELAPURE(TM) MELATONIN. In 1995, melatonin, a synthetic human hormone\n\npresent in a variety of foods and marketed as a dietary supplement, became the\n\nlargest selling chemical product manufactured by the General Division. In 1995,\n\nthe General Division began supplying bulk quantities of melatonin in response to\n\ndemand from manufacturers of final dosage form product. In addition, Genzyme has\n\ndeveloped its MelaPure(TM) Melatonin trademark and marketing program to identify\n\nMelaPure(TM) as a high quality material. Genzyme has developed and currently\n\nis marketing outside the U.S. a tableted finished dosage form product.\n\nCLINDAMYCIN PHOSPHATE. The General Division currently produces and\n\nsells clindamycin phosphate, an off-patent antibiotic widely used by hospitals\n\nfor the treatment of infections. Clindamycin phosphate is sold to pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Middle East through the\n\ndivision's worldwide sales organization.\n\nHYALURONIC ACID. The General Division currently produces and sells bulk\n\nhyaluronic acid (HA) for a number of applications. Under an agreement with\n\nAlcon, the General Division supplies HA powder to Alcon for incorporation into\n\nProvisc(R), an HA-based ophthalmic surgical aid product, which Alcon introduced\n\nin 1994. The General Division also receives a royalty based on Alcon's product\n\nsales. Hyaluronic acid is also sold to a number of customers for various\n\nresearch and development applications.\n\nACTIVE DRUG SUBSTANCES AND PHARMACEUTICAL INTERMEDIATES. The General\n\nDivision produces drug substances for leading ethical pharmaceutical companies\n\nfor formulation into a variety of dosage forms. The General Division also\n\nsupplies various pharmaceutical intermediaries which are converted to active\n\ndrug substances by the customer.\n\nFINE CHEMICALS. The General Division has developed a range of high\n\nvalue fine chemicals and chiral intermediates based on the Company's proprietary\n\ntechnology in complex organic chemistry. These products include various\n\n-20-\n\n22\n\nsynthetic starting materials and liquid crystal chemicals for the electronics\n\nindustry. The General Division markets these products through its own sales\n\nforce directly to chemical and pharmaceutical companies worldwide.\n\nSYNTHETIC PHOSPHOLIPIDS. Phospholipids are the major structural\n\ncomponents of cell membranes. They are useful in drug delivery systems, emulsion\n\nformulations and as components of pharmaceutical products such as liposomes. The\n\nGeneral Division has developed proprietary technology for the large scale\n\nmanufacture of synthetic phospholipids with high purity and consistency.\n\nThe General Division currently produces and sells synthetic\n\nphospholipids to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in the\n\nformulation and delivery of certain of their products.\n\nSYNTHETIC PEPTIDES AND AMINO ACID DERIVATIVES. Synthetic peptides are a\n\nclass of biologically active compounds comprised of chains of amino acids. Many\n\nof these compounds have applications as active drug compounds and are used by\n\nthe pharmaceutical industry in final dosage form preparations. The General\n\nDivision is a commercial scale GMP manufacturer of synthetic peptides for many\n\nsuch applications. Amino acid derivatives are the materials used in the\n\nproduction of synthetic peptides. In addition to producing these materials for\n\nuse in its own peptide manufacturing processes, the General Division sells amino\n\nacid derivatives to the pharmaceutical industry for use in the manufacture of\n\npeptides.\n\nBIOMOLECULES. The General Division produces and sells a variety of\n\nbiomolecules for use as bioprocessing materials in the biotechnology and\n\npharmaceutical industry. These include reagents such as DTT.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe General Division is engaged in a segment of the human health care\n\nproducts industry that is extremely competitive. Competitors in the United\n\nStates and elsewhere are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, chemical and\n\nbiotechnology companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than\n\nGenzyme. These companies may succeed in developing products that are more\n\neffective than any that have been or may be developed by the General Division\n\nand may also prove to be more successful than the General Division in producing\n\nand marketing their products.\n\nEach of the General Division's four business areas faces different\n\ncompetitive challenges:\n\nTHERAPEUTICS. Although the General Division is not aware of any current\n\neffective alternative to its products for the treatment for Gaucher disease\n\n(Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme), competition potentially could come\n\nfrom other protein replacement therapies or gene therapy. The General Division\n\nbelieves that its proprietary production techniques, exclusive raw material\n\nsource for Ceredase(R) enzyme and, to a certain extent, the orphan drug status\n\nof its products give it a number of advantages over potential competitors using\n\nprotein replacement therapy for the treatment of Gaucher disease. Gene therapy\n\ntechniques are still in experimental stages. The General Division believes that\n\nthe principal factors that will affect competition for Ceredase(R) enzyme and\n\nCerezyme(R) enzyme will be clinical effectiveness and absence of adverse side\n\n-21-\n\n23\n\neffects. One company is attempting to develop an alternative form of recombinant\n\nGCR by producing the enzyme in insect cells and modifying it by applying a\n\ncoating of polyethylene glycol.\n\nThe General Division believes that its expertise in developing\n\nproprietary fermentation processes and its access to proprietary strains of\n\nmicro-organisms used in its HA production process will give it a competitive\n\nadvantage in the development of HA products. The General Division's\n\nanti-adhesion products may face significant competition from other HA-based\n\nproducts, from non-HA-based products and from changes in surgical techniques\n\nthat would obviate the use of HA. The General Division believes that the\n\nprincipal factor that will affect competition in this area is acceptance of the\n\nproduct by surgeons, which depends, in large part, upon product performance,\n\nsafety and price.\n\nThere are a number of organizations, both academic and commercial,\n\nwhich are engaged in developing therapies to treat either the symptoms of CF or\n\nthe cause of the disease. The General Division is not aware of other\n\nnon-academic organizations working on a protein replacement therapy for CF.\n\nSeveral groups are developing gene therapy approaches to the disease and also\n\nhave received RAC approval to initiate limited human studies of CF gene therapy.\n\nIn addition, other organizations are investigating pharmacological and\n\nbiological agents that would treat CF. One such product, Pulmozyme(TM), which\n\nwas developed by Genentech, Inc., currently is on the market. These groups may\n\nsucceed in developing gene therapy products before the General Division, in\n\nobtaining patent protection that may effectively block the General Division from\n\ncommercializing its gene therapy or protein replacement products or in\n\ndeveloping other drug therapies that relieve the symptoms of cystic fibrosis\n\nand, thus, compete with products under development by the General Division.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The United States market for prenatal cytogenetic\n\nand biochemical testing is divided among approximately 500 laboratories, many of\n\nwhich offer both types of testing. Of this total group, less than 20\n\nlaboratories market their services nationally. The General Division believes\n\nthat the industry as a whole is still quite fragmented, with the top 20\n\nlaboratories accounting for approximately 50% of market revenues, and with no\n\nindividual company, including Integrated Genetics, accounting for more than 18%\n\nof the total.\n\nCompetitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business\n\ngenerally include reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered,\n\npricing, convenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and\n\nreporting and timeliness of delivery of completed reports. The General Division\n\nbelieves that its research and development program, which has enabled it to\n\ndevelop and introduce testing services based on new technology, and its active\n\nsales and marketing force have played significant roles in the rapid growth of\n\nits genetic diagnostics services business. Furthermore, in addition to the\n\nGeneral Division, several companies and academic groups are attempting to\n\ndevelop fetal cell separation techniques. The General Division believes that its\n\ncombination of separation and analytical technologies will give it a significant\n\ncompetitive advantage.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS. The General Division acts as a primary supplier of\n\nenzymes and substrates, and generally does not compete with its customers in the\n\nsale of complete diagnostic kits. This philosophy enables the General Division\n\nto maintain unique relationships with major diagnostic kit manufacturers and to\n\n-22-\n\n24\n\nengage with them in development efforts to produce new or improved kits. The\n\nmarket in the diagnostic products industry is mature and competition is based on\n\nprice, reliability of supply and the purity and specific activity of products.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS. Competition in the pharmaceuticals business is\n\naffected primarily by production efficiency, product quality and price. The\n\nGeneral Division believes that its success in this market is due to its\n\ntechnical expertise and selection of high-value, small volume products which\n\nminimizes direct competition with larger production operations in commodity\n\nproducts.\n\nPATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe General Division has filed or has licensed rights to many patent\n\napplications and patents in the United States and numerous foreign countries\n\nrelating to its processes and products. In general, patents issued in the U.S.\n\nare effective for a period of seventeen years from date of issue, although the\n\nGATT legislation recently passed changes this to twenty years from the filing\n\ndate for applications filed after June 8, 1995. The duration of foreign patents\n\nvaries in accordance with applicable local law. The General Division also relies\n\non trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation\n\nto develop and maintain a competitive position in its product areas. Genzyme's\n\nemployees, consultants and corporate partners who have access to its proprietary\n\ninformation have signed confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance\n\nthat these agreements will be honored or that others may not independently\n\ndevelop similar technology.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the General Division's patent claims\n\nwill offer protection against competition, or will not be designed around or\n\ninfringed upon by others. In addition, there can be no assurance that other\n\ncompanies will not be awarded patents that affect the General Division's\n\ninterests. Genzyme may be required to obtain licenses under such patents in\n\norder to manufacture and market some of its products. There can be no assurance\n\nthat it will be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses will be\n\navailable on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, patent litigation is\n\nwidespread in the biotechnology industry and it is not possible to predict how\n\nthis will affect the division's efforts to form strategic alliances, to conduct\n\nclinical trials or to manufacture and market its products under development.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nGovernmental regulation, in the United States and other countries, is a\n\nsignificant factor in the production and marketing of many of the General\n\nDivision's products and in its ongoing research and development activities.\n\nFDA REGULATION. In the United States, products that do not achieve\n\ntheir principal intended purpose through chemical action within or on the body\n\nand which are not dependent upon being metabolized by the patient's body in\n\norder to be effective are classified by the FDA as \"devices\" while other\n\nproducts are classified as \"drugs\" or \"biologics.\" The General Division's\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme are regulated in the U.S. as drugs, as\n\nare Thyrogen(R) hormone and Tretinoin(LF). HyperGAM(TM)+CF and Neozyme II's\n\nprotein replacement and gene therapy products are regulated as biologics. The\n\nPartnership's products are regulated as devices. The Direct Test LDL(TM)\n\ncholesterol is classified as an in vitro diagnostic device.\n\n-23-\n\n25\n\nThe activities required before drugs or biologics may be marketed in\n\nthe United States include (i) preclinical laboratory tests, in vitro and in vivo\n\npreclinical studies and formulation and stability studies, (ii) the submission\n\nto the FDA and approval of an application for human clinical testing (an \"IND\"),\n\n(iii) adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to prove the safety and\n\neffectiveness of the drug or biologic, (iv) the submission of a New Drug\n\nApplication (\"NDA\") for a drug or a Product License Application (\"PLA\") for a\n\nbiologic and (v) the approval by the FDA of the NDA or PLA.\n\nIn addition to product approval, the manufacturer of the product may\n\nhave to obtain an establishment license (for a biologic that is not considered\n\nwell characterized) or a pre-approval Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\")\n\ninspection (for a drug or well characterized biologic) from the FDA. Since any\n\nlicense granted by the FDA is both site and process specific, any material\n\nchange by a company in the manufacturing process, equipment or location\n\nnecessitates additional FDA review and approval.\n\nProducts that are classified as devices also require FDA approval prior\n\nto marketing. Devices are classified as Class I, II or III, depending upon the\n\ninformation available to assure their safety and effectiveness. In general,\n\nClass I and Class II devices are devices whose safety and effectiveness can\n\nreasonably be assured through general or specific controls, respectively. Class\n\nIII devices are life sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or new\n\ndevices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally\n\nmarketed devices. The steps required for approval of a Class III device include\n\n(i) preclinical laboratory tests and in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies,\n\n(ii) the submission to the FDA and approval of an investigational device\n\nexemption (an \"IDE\") to allow initiation of clinical testing, (iii) human\n\nclinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness of the device, (iv) the\n\nsubmission of a PMA and (v) the approval by the FDA of the PMA. Typically,\n\nclinical testing of devices involves initial testing to evaluate safety and\n\nfeasibility and expanded trials to collect sufficient data to prove safety and\n\neffectiveness. In addition, the procedures and the facilities used to\n\nmanufacture the device are subject to review and approval by the FDA.\n\nA device (other than a Class III device) which is proved to be\n\nsubstantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to May 28, 1976, when\n\ngovernment regulations for devices were first introduced, can be marketed after\n\napproval of a 510(k) application rather than the filing of an IDE and a PMA. The\n\n510(k) application must contain a description of the device, its methods of\n\nmanufacture and quality control procedures and the results of testing to\n\ndemonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to the device already\n\nmarketed.\n\nThe time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary\n\nto obtain FDA approval can far exceed the time and expense of the research and\n\ndevelopment initially required to create the product. Even after initial FDA\n\napproval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide\n\nadditional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a\n\ntreatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In\n\naddition, use of these products during testing and after marketing approval has\n\nbeen obtained could reveal side effects which, if serious, could delay, impede\n\nor prevent marketing approval, limit uses, force a recall of the product or\n\nexpose the General Division to product liability claims.\n\n-24-\n\n26\n\nREGULATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. For marketing outside the United\n\nStates, the General Division is subject to foreign regulatory requirements\n\ngoverning human clinical testing and marketing approval for its products. These\n\nrequirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S. and may\n\nnecessitate additional pre-clinical or clinical testing whether or not FDA\n\napproval has been obtained.\n\nGenerally, the division's initial focus for obtaining marketing\n\napproval outside the U.S. is Europe. European Community (\"EC\") Directives\n\n(\"regulations\") generally classify products either as medicinal products or\n\ndevices. For medicinal products, marketing approval may be sought using either\n\nthe centralized procedure of the Committee for Proprietary Medicine or Products\n\n(the \"CPMP\") or the decentralized (mutual recognition) process. The CPMP\n\ncentralized procedure results in a recommendation for approval in all member\n\nstates, while the EC multi-state process involves country by country approval.\n\nEC regulations for products classified as devices have been implemented for some\n\ndevices. Devices such as Genzyme's HA Products must receive market approval\n\nthrough a centralized procedure, where the device receives a CE mark allowing\n\ndistribution to all member states of the European Union. For those devices where\n\nEC regulations have not been implemented, marketing approval must be obtained on\n\na country by country basis. The CE mark certification requires the company to\n\nreceive International Standards Organization (ISO) certification for each\n\nfacility involved in the manufacture or distribution of the device. This\n\ncertification only comes after the development of an all inclusive quality\n\nsystem which is reviewed for compliance to International Quality Standards by a\n\nlicensed \"Notified Body\" working within the EC. After certification is received\n\na product dossier is reviewed which attests to the products compliance with EC\n\ndirective 93/42/EEC for medical devices. Only after this point is a CE mark\n\ngranted\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme has been registered for sale in the EC through a\n\nCPMP centralized procedure. The General Division expects Cerezyme(R) enzyme,\n\nThyrogen(R) hormone and the products of Neozyme II also will be regulated\n\nthrough centralized CPMP procedure. Seprafilm(TM) has been granted the CE Mark.\n\nORPHAN DRUG ACT. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to\n\nmanufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions\n\naffecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of\n\napplication for orphan drug designation. The first developer to receive FDA\n\nmarketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven-year exclusive\n\nmarketing period in the United States for that product. However, a drug that is\n\nconsidered by the FDA to be clinically superior to or different from another\n\napproved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, is not barred from\n\nsale in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. The\n\nGeneral Division has been accorded orphan drug status for Ceredase(R) enzyme and\n\nCerezyme(R) enzyme and has received orphan drug designation for a number of\n\nother products currently under development, including the products of Neozyme II\n\nand Thyrogen(R) hormone. The TretinoinLF product being developed in conjunction\n\nwith Aronex has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of leukemias.\n\nPeriodically, legislation is proposed before the United States Congress\n\nto amend the Orphan Drug Act to reduce the seven-year exclusive marketing period\n\nunder certain circumstances. Any such legislation is not likely to affect\n\nproducts currently being marketed such as Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R)\n\nenzyme but could reduce the market exclusivity period for future products.\n\nAlthough the Company has filed for or received orphan drug designation for\n\nvarious products,\n\n-25-\n\n27\n\nthe Company believes that the commercial success of these products including\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme will depend more significantly on the\n\nassociated safety and efficacy profile and on the price relative to competitive\n\nor alternative treatments and other marketing characteristics of each product\n\nthan on any exclusivity afforded by the Orphan Drug Act. Additionally, these\n\nproducts may be protected by patents, exclusive raw material supply contracts\n\nand other means.\n\nOTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATION. The General Division's operations are or\n\nmay be subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe\n\nworking conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and\n\nthe purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of\n\nhazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds\n\nand infectious disease agents used in connection with its research work. The\n\nextent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or\n\nadministrative action cannot be predicted.\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF THE TISSUE REPAIR DIVISION\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nGenzyme's Tissue Repair Division (\"GTR\") focuses on developing,\n\nproducing and marketing technologically advanced products for the treatment and\n\nprevention of serious tissue damage. GTR believes that strong capabilities in\n\nthree groups of core technologies -- autologous cell processing, therapeutic\n\nprotein development and biomaterials engineering -- enhance its ability to\n\nsuccessfully develop and market a portfolio of novel products and services to\n\napply to unmet medical needs in the field of tissue repair. Two services, the\n\nEpicel(SM) Service for permanent skin replacement, and the CARTICEL(SM) Service\n\nfor repair of cartilage, currently are on the market. Several others are in\n\nclinical evaluation. Significant additional development efforts, preclinical\n\ntesting and manufacturing scale-up activities, as appropriate, must be\n\ncompleted before the products and services under development can be\n\ncommercialized. In addition, most of these products and services will require\n\nregulatory approval. There can be no assurance that adequate resources will be\n\navailable to fund these activities or that, if funded, they will be completed\n\nsuccessfully, that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that the\n\nproducts under development will be commercialized successfully.\n\nGenzyme created GTR in December 1994 by acquiring BioSurface\n\nTechnology, Inc. (\"BioSurface\") and combining it with several Genzyme programs\n\nin the area of tissue repair. BioSurface was in the business of developing and\n\nsupplying engineered tissues grown from normal human cells using proprietary\n\ncell culture technology.\n\nGTR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nGTR's activities can be divided into three main areas: cartilage\n\nrepair, consisting of the CARTICEL(SM) Service and CARTICEL II; skin repair,\n\nincluding the Epicel(SM) Service and the TGF-Beta2 and Vianain(R) Debriding\n\nProduct programs; and other tissue repair opportunities in the areas of multiple\n\nsclerosis and bone repair.\n\nCARTILAGE REPAIR - CARTICEL(SM) SERVICE\n\n-26-\n\n28\n\nCartilage tissue can be found in several parts of the body and serves\n\nseveral different purposes. Articular (hyaline) cartilage is a thin layer of\n\ntough opaque tissue that lines the opposing bone surfaces of all moving joints\n\nin the body to provide almost frictionless movement of the joint. Another type\n\nof cartilage (fibrocartilage) serves a shock-absorbing function in the knee and\n\nin the spine between the vertebrae. Cartilage is also the tissue which gives\n\nshape to the ear and the nose.\n\nDamage to cartilage causes significant medical problems. When articular\n\ncartilage tissue in a joint suffers more than superficial damage, it does not\n\nregenerate and may further deteriorate over time. Even damage which creates a\n\nsmall defect in articular cartilage can impair joint movement, restrict patient\n\nmobility and cause pain and joint locking. There were an estimated 1.3 million\n\nprocedures performed in the U.S. in 1994 to treat soft tissue damage in the\n\nknee. A substantial number of these procedures involved articular cartilage\n\ndamage.\n\nIn the most severe cases of damaged cartilage, the joint is replaced\n\nwith a metal or plastic prosthesis. In the United States, approximately 190,000\n\ntotal joint replacements are performed each year at a total cost to the\n\nhealthcare system of approximately $3 billion. Total joint replacement carries a\n\nsignificant risk of long term failure. Consequently, knee replacement is\n\nconsidered a last resort treatment for patients under 60 years old.\n\nArthroscopic techniques are currently used to relieve patients' pain\n\nand lessen the chances of further tissue damage, but they do not repair the\n\ndefect or stop the degenerative process which may lead to osteoarthritis.\n\nPatients with osteoarthritis may require a total joint replacement, which\n\ncarries a significant risk of long-term failure. Therefore, joint replacement is\n\ngenerally not recommended for patients under the age of fifty, who would likely\n\noutlive the prosthesis.\n\nGTR's CARTICEL(SM) Service provides autologous (or derived from a\n\npatient's own cells) cultured articular cartilage cells for the repair of focal\n\ncartilage defects in the knee. The service starts with a small sample of healthy\n\narticular cartilage tissue removed from the patient's knee. After the cartilage\n\ncells from the tissue have been grown to sufficient number in GTR's laboratory,\n\nthey are transplanted back into the cartilage defect in the patient's knee to\n\nform new cartilage tissue. Because these laboratory-grown cells can lead to\n\nreplacement of the cartilage defect with healthy cartilage tissue, GTR believes\n\nthat the CARTICEL(SM) Service may improve joint function and significantly delay\n\nor even eliminate the need for expensive, debilitating joint replacement\n\nsurgery. Based on market research it has conducted, GTR estimates that\n\nCARTICEL(SM) Service is applicable in approximately 250,000 patients with\n\ncartilage defects each year in the United States and Europe, combined.\n\nThe CARTICEL(SM) Service is an integrated program of surgeon training,\n\nstandardized cartilage cell processing, and rigorous collection and analysis of\n\noutcomes data, which is aimed at providing broad surgeon access and achieving\n\nand maintaining high quality patient outcomes. Although the CARTICEL(SM) Service\n\nis not currently regulated by the FDA, GTR has developed a quality systems\n\napproach to the delivery of this service.\n\nGTR's CARTICEL(SM) Service has been developed based on eight years of\n\npioneering work by a group of Swedish physicians (the \"Swedish Group\"). As of\n\nMarch 1, 1996, the Swedish Group, which was the first group in the world to\n\n-27-\n\n29\n\nreport the use of cultured autologous cartilage cells to treat cartilage damage,\n\nhas treated 245 patients with knee cartilage defects. A retrospective review of\n\nsafety data on the initial 153 patients treated by the Swedish Group, which was\n\nconducted by an independent data management organization hired by GTR and\n\ncovered eight years of data for the earliest patients, indicated no serious\n\nadverse events directly attributable to autologous chondrocyte implantation or\n\npost implantation joint infection. An ongoing retrospective review by GTR\n\npresently covering approximately 80 of these patients has yielded encouraging\n\ndata on the efficacy of the treatment, as measured by joint functionality and\n\narthroscopic and histological evaluation, symptoms and patient assessment of\n\nimprovement. In the October 6, 1994 issue of the New England Journal of\n\nMedicine, the Swedish Group published data on the first 23 patients to reach a\n\ntwo year follow-up evaluation. As reported in this article, 19 of 23 patients\n\nhad restored or improved joint function after treatment with cultured autologous\n\nchondrocytes.\n\nIn order to gain access to GTR's cartilage cell processing services,\n\nsurgeons must complete comprehensive training in the surgical procedure for\n\nautologous cartilage cell implantation. As of March 1, 1996, GTR has trained\n\napproximately 400 surgeons. In addition to GTR's three-day training program in\n\nSweden, GTR established a training site in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the\n\nfourth quarter of 1995 and modified the training curriculum to concentrate the\n\nprogram into one day in order to meet the increased demand for surgeon training\n\nand to accommodate the surgeon's limited time availability. Beginning in March\n\n1996, GTR also began offering the one day training program in the Netherlands.\n\nWith the completion of the Cambridge facility and by intensifying the training\n\nprogram, GTR will have the capacity to train more than 1,200 surgeons per year.\n\nGTR's training programs include clinical, technical and practical\n\norientation modules, providing a concentrated exposure to autologous\n\nimplantation technology. Physician training consists of lectures, practice of\n\nthe surgical technique and an orientation regarding reimbursement and billing\n\nprocedures. In an effort to maintain the high quality standards of the\n\nCARTICEL(SM) Service training program, GTR utilizes videotapes of the surgical\n\nbiopsy and implantation procedures performed by the Swedish group. GTR believes\n\nthat its exclusive ability to provide surgeons with the opportunity to observe\n\nand interact with the Swedish Group is a significant competitive advantage.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. GTR currently has a number of ongoing development\n\nprograms relating to its CARTICEL(SM) Service (collectively referred to as\n\nCARTICEL II), including work on arthroscopic implantation procedures and\n\ndevelopment of the CARTICEL(SM) Service for other applications. The primary\n\nobjectives of these programs are to: (i) improve GTR's general knowledge of\n\ncartilage repair, (ii) improve the regenerative ability of the implanted,\n\nautologous chondrocytes and (iii) expand the application of the CARTICEL(SM)\n\nService to the repair of large surface area defects such as those seen in\n\nosteoarthritic joints. The CARTICEL(SM) Service is currently effective only for\n\nthe repair of small area defects (less than two centimeters in diameter).\n\n-28-\n\n30\n\nSKIN REPAIR\n\nEach year approximately 2,000,000 people in the United States suffer\n\nburn injuries. According to the National Center for Health Services,\n\napproximately 70,000 of these patients are admitted to hospitals for serious\n\nburn injuries. GTR estimates that approximately 25,000 of the most severely\n\nburned patients in the United States are admitted to one of the 140 specialized\n\nburn centers. Industry analysts estimate that approximately $1 billion is spent\n\nin the United States annually for the treatment of burns.\n\nChronic skin ulcers are open, often painful wounds found predominantly\n\non the lower extremities of elderly patients. GTR estimates that approximately\n\n2,600,000 cases of chronic or slow healing skin ulcers are treated in the United\n\nStates each year at a cost of more than $7 billion, with individual treatments\n\ncosting up to $40,000 per year.\n\nGTR is developing a range of products targeted at the treatment of\n\nburns and skin ulcers, as indicated in the following chart:\n\nGTR SKIN REPAIR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION/APPLICATION STATUS\n\n------- ---------------------- ------\n\nEpicel(SM) Service Burns - Permanent skin replacement Marketed since 1988\n\nTGF-Beta2 Tissue growth promotion Completed initial\n\nPhase II trial;\n\nAdditional Phase II\n\ntrial began fourth\n\nquarter, 1995\n\nVianain(R) Debriding Product Burns -- Wound debridement Completed two Phase\n\nII clinical trials\n\nUlcers -- Wound debridement Completed pilot\n\ntrial; Phase II\n\ntrial to begin in\n\nearly 1996\n\nEPICEL(SM) SERVICE. Skin grafts produced using the Epicel(SM) Service\n\nare a life-saving product indicated for patients who suffer severe,\n\nfull-thickness burns and need permanent skin replacement. These epidermal grafts\n\nare grown from a patient's own skin cells and, therefore, are not rejected by\n\nthe patient's immune system. Starting with a patient biopsy about the size of a\n\npostage stamp, GTR can grow enough skin grafts in three to four weeks to cover a\n\npatient's entire body surface area. Each skin graft consists of a sheet of\n\ncultured skin cells, approximately 25 square centimeters in size and ranging\n\nfrom two to eight cell layers thick, attached to a piece of surgical dressing\n\nmaterial. A 48 hour shelf life allows these grafts to be delivered anywhere in\n\nthe United States, Europe or Japan from GTR's production laboratories in\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSkin grafts produced using the Epicel(SM) Service were first introduced\n\nin 1988 and remain the only commercially available laboratory grown skin grafts\n\nshown to provide permanent skin replacement. Most burn wounds involving less\n\nthan 60%\n\n-29-\n\n31\n\nbody surface area are covered with conventional skin grafts within the three to\n\nfour weeks it currently takes to grow skin grafts produced using the Epicel(SM)\n\nService. Therefore, GTR believes that the primary candidates for the Epicel(SM)\n\nService are the approximately four hundred patients each year in the United\n\nStates who survive burn injuries covering more than 60% of their body surface\n\narea. GTR markets the Epicel(SM) Service to burn centers throughout the U.S. and\n\nin parts of Europe through its own direct sales force. GTR began marketing the\n\nEpicel(SM) Service in Japan in 1995 through its distributor.\n\nGTR is currently evaluating alternative approaches for use of the\n\nEpicel(SM) Service which will represent improvements over certain limitations\n\nthat have been identified in its clinical utility and production methods.\n\nMethods being evaluated by GTR include use of synthetic membranes and composite\n\nskin grafts. GTR believes that advances in the field of autologous keratinocyte\n\ngrafting coupled with one or both of these technologies may allow the expanded\n\nuse of autologous keratinocyte grafting for the treatment of smaller burns as\n\nwell as for treatment of cutaneous ulcers which involve large surface areas of\n\nthe skin. In the latter case, GTR believes an improved autologous keratinocyte\n\ngraft could effectively and economically provide final wound closure following\n\neffective debridement and induction of granulation tissue deposition at the\n\nwound site.\n\nTRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR BETA2 (\"TGF-BETA2\"). TGF-Beta2 is one of\n\na family of proteins that plays an important role in the body's ability to\n\npromote normal wound healing by stimulating the growth of connective tissue. GTR\n\nhas licensed recombinant TGF-Beta2 from Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\n(\"Celtrix\") and is collaborating with Celtrix on the use of TGF-Beta2 to\n\npromote the healing of chronic skin ulcers by supplementing the body's own\n\nproduction of TGF-Beta2. The product will consist of an easy-to-use collagen\n\nsponge which serves as a delivery vehicle permitting the release of a consistent\n\ndose of TGF-Beta2 to the wound surface over time.\n\nIn January 1994, Celtrix announced that th"
