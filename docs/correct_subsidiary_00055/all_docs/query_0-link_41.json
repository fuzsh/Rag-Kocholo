The purposes of the script are to: handle complex load histories; control load/displacement with alternate stopping criteria; predict failure and life; and verify constitutive models. Material models from the ABAQUS library may be used or the UMAT routine may specify mechanical behavior. User subroutines implemented include: UMAT for the constitutive model; UEXTERNALDB for file manipulation; DISP for boundary conditions; and URDFIL for results processing. Examples presented include load, strain and displacement control tests on a single element model. The tests are creep with a life limiting strain criterion, strain control with a stress limiting cycle and a complex interrupted cyclic relaxation test. The techniques implemented in this paper enable complex load conditions to be solved efficiently with ABAQUS.\n\nSocio-economic predictors of performance in the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPuddey, Ian B; Mercer, Annette\n\n2013-11-29\n\nEntry from secondary school to Australian and New Zealand undergraduate medical schools has since the late 1990's increasingly relied on the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) as one of the selection factors. The UMAT consists of 3 sections - logical reasoning and problem solving (UMAT-1), understanding people (UMAT-2) and non-verbal reasoning (UMAT-3). One of the goals of using this test has been to enhance equity in the selection of students with the anticipation of an increase in the socioeconomic diversity in student cohorts. However there has been limited assessment as to whether UMAT performance itself might be influenced by socioeconomic background. Between 2000 and 2012, 158,909 UMAT assessments were completed. From these, 118,085 cases have been identified where an Australian candidate was sitting for the first time during that period. Predictors of the total UMAT score, UMAT-1, UMAT-2 and UMAT-3 scores were entered into regression models and included gender, age, school type, language used at home, deciles for the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage score, the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), self-identification as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin (ATSI) and current Australian state or territory of abode. A lower UMAT score was predicted by living in an area of relatively higher social disadvantage and lower social advantage. Other socioeconomic indicators were consistent with this observation with lower scores in those who self-identified as being of ATSI origin and higher scores evident in those from fee-paying independent school backgrounds compared to government schools. Lower scores were seen with increasing age, female gender and speaking any language other than English at home. Divergent effects of rurality were observed, with increased scores for UMAT-1 and UMAT-2, but decreasing UMAT-3 scores with increasing ARIA score.

Plastic hardening, thermal recovery and multiple cycles of recrystallisation can be tracked for single peak as well as multiple peak recrystallisation response. The numerical implementation of the state variable model extends on a J2 isotropic hypo-elastoplastic modelling framework. The complete numerical implementation is presented as an Abaqus UMAT and linked subroutines. Implementation is discussed with detailed explanation of the derivation and use of various sensitivities, internal state variable management and multiple recrystallisation cycle contributions. A flow chart explaining the proposed numerical implementation is provided as well as verification on the convergence of the material subroutine. The material model is characterised using two high temperature data sets for cobalt and copper. The results of finite element analyses using the material parameter values characterised on the copper data set are also presented.\n\nManajemen Wakaf Tunai dalam Upaya Pemberdayaan Ekonomi Umat di Pos Keadilan Peduli Umat (PKPU KCP Lumajang\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNurhafid Ishari\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Sepanjang sejarah Islam wakaf telah memerankan peran yang sangat penting dalam pengembangan kegiatan-kegiatan sosial, ekonomi dan kebudayaan masyarakat Islam.

Since most complex geometries can be represented in terms of blocks of simpler geometries, a number of geometry subprograms have been created for use within HOWFAR. They are provided as part of the EGS4 Code System, which means that they are located in files on the EGS4 disk under VM/SP at SLAC. They are also on the EGS4 Distribution Tape that is given out on request by the SLAC Radiation Physics Group. What we hope to accomplish with this note is to show how to create EGS4 geometries in a modular fashion, with particular emphasis on using the macro equivalents of the subroutines in order to gain efficiency. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with EGS4 and understands the role of the variables USTEP, IDISC, and IRNEW as they apply to SUBROUTINE HOWFAR. If not, then the reader is advised to study Appendix 2 of SLAC-265 first. The tutorial chapter may also provide some insight. 5 refs., 10 figs\n\nAnalysis of Dynamic Fracture Parameters in Functionally Graded Material Plates with Cracks by Graded Finite Element Method and Virtual Crack Closure Technique\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLi Ming Zhou\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Based on the finite element software ABAQUS and graded element method, we developed a dummy node fracture element, wrote the user subroutines UMAT and UEL, and solved the energy release rate component of functionally graded material (FGM plates with cracks. An interface element tailored for the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT was applied. Fixed cracks and moving cracks under dynamic loads were simulated. The results were compared to other VCCT-based analyses. With the implementation of a crack speed function within the element, it can be easily expanded to the cases of varying crack velocities, without convergence difficulty for all cases. Neither singular element nor collapsed element was required. Therefore, due to its simplicity, the VCCT interface element is a potential tool for engineers to conduct dynamic fracture analysis in conjunction with commercial finite element analysis codes.\n\nAccuracy improvement of SPACE code using the optimization for CHF subroutine\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYang, Chang Keun; Kim, Yo Han; Park, Jong Eun; Ha, Sang Jun\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTypically, a subroutine to calculate the CHF (Critical Heat Flux) is loaded in code for safety analysis of nuclear power plant. CHF subroutine calculates CHF phenomenon using arbitrary condition (Temperature, pressure, flow rate, power, etc). When safety analysis for nuclear power plant is performed using major factor, CHF parameter is one of the most important factor. But the subroutines used in most codes, such as Biasi method, etc., estimate some different values from experimental data. Most CHF subroutines in the codes could predict only in their specification area, such as pressure, mass flow, void fraction, etc. Even though the most accurate CHF subroutine is used in the high quality nuclear safety analysis code, it is not assured that the valued predicted values by the subroutine are acceptable out of their application area. To overcome this hardship, various approaches to estimate the CHF have been examined during the code developing stage of SPACE. And the six sigma technique was adopted for the examination as mentioned this study. The objective of this study is to improvement of CHF prediction accuracy for nuclear power plant safety analysis code using the CHF database and Six Sigma technique. Through the study, it was concluded that the six sigma technique was useful to quantify the deviation of prediction values to experimental data and the implemented CHF prediction method in SPACE code had well-predict capabilities compared with those from other methods\n\nTEKLIB, Tektronix Graphics Subroutine Library\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWolf, M.L.\n\n1987-01-01\n\n1 - Description of program or function: TEKLIB is a library of subroutines that produces graphical output on all Tektronix terminals with model numbers from 4010 through 4115. The application program identifies the model number in the initialization subroutine, GRSTRT, and then uses this number as a flag throughout the run to tailor the graphical output to that specific device. Output includes lines, markers, text, polygons, and panels. Graphic input is supported on all terminals. 2 - Method of solution: TEKLIB uses two coordinate systems, viewport and world, to generate graphic images on the screen. Viewport coordinates refer to an imaginary rectangular grid on the display screen surface. The world coordinate system is a rectangular grid on any x-y plane, defined by the application program. The rectangular portion of the x-y plane specified, termed a w indow , is projected onto a rectangular region of the screen, called a v iewport . In addition to 2-D graphics, TEKLIB also provides subroutines for drawing projections of 3-D objects. The application program first defines a point in space to look at the v iew point , and the direction and distance from that point to the observer's position. A viewing transformation is performed on each x,y,z point to project it onto a v iew plane , a plane perpendicular to the line of sight and passing through the view point. This view plane then becomes the x-y plane of the world window which is mapped into the viewport. 3 - Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: TEKLIB does not attempt to emulate attributes such as line style and marker type in software if the terminal does not support those attributes in hardware\n\nQuantum computing with black-box quantum subroutines\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nThompson, Jayne [Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, 117543 Singapore (Singapore); Gu, Mile [Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing (China); Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, 117543 Singapore (Singapore); Modi, Kavan [School of Physics, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800 (Australia); Vedral, Vlatko [Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, OX1 3PU (United Kingdom); Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, 117543 Singapore (Singapore); Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, 117551 Singapore (Singapore)\n\n2014-07-01\n\nIn classical computation a subroutine is treated as a black box and we do not need to know its exact physical implementation to use it. A complex problem can be decomposed into smaller problems using such modularity. We show that quantum mechanically applying an unknown quantum process as a subroutine is impossible, and this restricts computation models such as DQC1 from operating on unknown inputs. We present a method to avoid this situation for certain computational problems and apply to a modular version of Shor's factoring algorithm. We examine how quantum entanglement and discord fare in this implementation. In this way we are able to study the role of discord in Shor's factoring algorithm.\n\nNumerical analysis of strain localization for transversely isotropic model with non-coaxial flow rule\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWei, Ding; Cong-cong, Yu; Chen-hui, Wu; Zheng-yi, Shu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo analyse the strain localization behavior of geomaterials, the forward Euler schemes and the tangent modulus matrix are formulated based on the transversely isotropic yield criterion with non-coaxial flow rule developed by Lade, the program code is implemented based on the user subroutine (UMAT) of ABAQUS. The influence of the material principal direction on the strain localization and the bearing capacity of the structure are investigated and analyzed. Numerical results show the validity and performance of the proposed model in simulating the strain localization behavior of geostructures.\n\nLINPACK, Subroutine Library for Linear Equation System Solution and Matrix Calculation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDongarra, J.J.\n\n1979-01-01\n\n1 - Description of problem or function: LINPACK is a collection of FORTRAN subroutines which analyze and solve various classes of systems of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. The collection deals with general, banded, symmetric indefinite, symmetric positive definite, triangular, and tridiagonal square matrices, as well as with least squares problems and the QR and singular value decompositions of rectangular matrices. A subroutine-naming convention is employed in which each subroutine name consists of five letters which represent a coded specification (TXXYY) of the computation done by that subroutine. The first letter, T, indicates the matrix data type. Standard FORTRAN allows the use of three such types: S REAL, D DOUBLE PRECISION, and C COMPLEX. In addition, some FORTRAN systems allow a double-precision complex type: Z COMPLEX*16. The second and third letters of the subroutine name, XX, indicate the form of the matrix or its decomposition: GE: General, GB: General band, PO: Positive definite, PP: Positive definite packed, PB: Positive definite band, SI: Symmetric indefinite, SP: Symmetric indefinite packed, HI: Hermitian indefinite, HP: Hermitian indefinite packed, TR: Triangular, GT: General tridiagonal, PT: Positive definite tridiagonal, CH: Cholesky decomposition, QR: Orthogonal-triangular decomposition, SV: Singular value decomposition. The final two letters, YY, indicate the computation done by the particular subroutine: FA: Factor, CO: Factor and estimate condition, SL: Solve, DI: Determinant and/or inverse and/or inertia, DC: Decompose, UD: Update, DD: Down-date, EX Exchange. The following chart shows all the LINPACK subroutines. The initial 'S' in the names may be replaced by D, C or Z and the initial 'C' in the complex-only names may be replaced by a Z.

The shortest sabotage paths represent physical routes through the site which would allow an adversary to take advantage of the greatest weaknesses in the system of barriers and alarms. The subroutine SPTH3 is a tool with which safeguards designers and analysts can study the relative effects of design changes on the adversary routing problem. In addition to showing how to use SPTH3, this report discusses the methods used to find shortest paths and several implementation details which cause SPTH3 to be extremely efficient\n\nELEFUNT, Testing of Elementary Function Subroutines\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCody, W.J.\n\n1981-01-01\n\n1 - Description of problem or function: ELEFUNT is a FORTRAN test package for the elementary functions. Each program is an aggressive test of one or more of the elementary function subroutines generally supplied with the support library accompanying a FORTRAN compiler.

A modified Kachanov-Rabotnov constitutive equation which accounts for inhomogeneity in creep damage is used. With a user defined material a number of bench mark tests are analyzed for verification. In the cases where analytical solutions exist, the numerical results agree very well. In other cases, the creep damage evolution response appear to be realistic in comparison with laboratory creep tests. The appropriateness of using the creep damage mechanics concept in design and life assessment of high temperature components is demonstrated. 18 refs\n\nThe application of an internal state variable model to the viscoplastic behavior of irradiated ASTM 304L stainless steel\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMcAnulty, Michael J., E-mail: mcanulmj@id.doe.gov [Department of Energy, 1955 Fremont Avenue, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 (United States); Potirniche, Gabriel P.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The model predicts uniaxial tensile test data for irradiated 304L stainless steel. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The model is implemented as a user-defined material subroutine in the finite element code ABAQUS. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Results are compared for the unirradiated and irradiated specimens loaded in uniaxial tension. - Abstract: Neutron irradiation of metals results in decreased fracture toughness, decreased ductility, increased yield strength and increased ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. Designers use the most limiting material properties throughout the reactor vessel lifetime to determine acceptable safety margins. To reduce analysis conservatism, a new model is proposed based on an internal state variable approach for the plastic behavior of unirradiated ductile materials to support its use for analyzing irradiated materials. The proposed modeling addresses low temperature irradiation of 304L stainless steel, and predicts uniaxial tensile test data of irradiated experimental specimens. The model was implemented as a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) in the finite element software ABAQUS. Results are compared between the unirradiated and irradiated specimens subjected to tension tests.\n\nDIGLIB, Multi Platform Graphics Subroutine Library\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBuleson, R.R.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDescription of program or function: DIGLIB is a collection of general graphics subroutines.

The subroutines are written in FORTRAN. DYNSTALL is basically an implementation of the Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model. This model is a semi-empirical model for dynamic stall. It includes, however, also models for attached flow unsteady aerodynamics. It is complete in the sense that it treats attached flow as well as separated flow. Semi-empirical means that the model relies on empirically determined constants. Semi because the constants are constants in equations with some physical interpretation. It requires the input of 2D airfoil aerodynamic data via tables as function of angle of attack. The method is intended for use in an aeroelastic code with the aerodynamics solved by blade/element method. DYNSTALL was written to work for any 2D angles of attack relative to the airfoil, e.g. flow from the rear of an airfoil.\n\nCrack density and electrical resistance in indium-tin-oxide/polymer thin films under cyclic loading\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nMora Cordova, Angel\n\n2014-11-01\n\nHere, we propose a damage model that describes the degradation of the material properties of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin films deposited on polymer substrates under cyclic loading. We base this model on our earlier tensile test model and show that the new model is suitable for cyclic loading. After calibration with experimental data, we are able to capture the stress-strain behavior and changes in electrical resistance of ITO thin films. We are also able to predict the crack density using calibrations from our previous model. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our model based on simulations using material properties reported in the literature. Our model is implemented in the commercially available finite element software ABAQUS using a user subroutine UMAT.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].\n\nPerformance Analysis of Memory Transfers and GEMM Subroutines on NVIDIA Tesla GPU Cluster\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAllada, Veerendra, Benjegerdes, Troy; Bode, Brett\n\n2009-08-31\n\nCommodity clusters augmented with application accelerators are evolving as competitive high performance computing systems.

The subroutines are written in FORTRAN. AERFORCE requires the input of airfoil aerodynamic data via tables as function of angle of attack, the turbine blade and rotor geometry and wind and blade velocities as input. The method is intended for use in an aeroelastic code. Wind and blade velocities are given at a sequence of time steps and blade forces are returned. The aerodynamic method is basically a Blade-Element/Momentum method. The method is fast and coded to be used in time simulations. In order to obtain a steady state solution a time simulation to steady state conditions has to be carried out.

The detailed elastic-plastic stress and strain responses were computed by the finite element software (ABAQUS) incorporating a robust cyclic plasticity model via a user subroutine UMAT. The obtained stresses and strains were applied to the multiaxial fatigue damage criterion to compute the fatigue damage induced by a loading cycle on the critical material plane. The fatigue initiation life was then obtained by the proposed theoretical model. The well agreement between the predicted results and the experiment data indicated that the fatigue initiation of notched components in the multiaxial stress state related to all the nonzero stress and strain quantities.

It is a specialized program for nonlinear problems (implicit solver) which is common in academia and industry. The primary goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive introduction to a special feature of this software: the user can write user-subroutines in the programming language Fortran, which is the language of all classical finite element packages. This subroutine feature allows the user to replace certain modules of the core code and to implement new features such as constitutive laws or new elements. Thus, the functionality of commercial codes (âblack boxâ) can easily be extended by linking user written code to the main core of the program. This feature allows to take advantage of a commercial software package with the flexibility of a âsemi-openâ code. .\n\nFUNPACK-2, Subroutine Library, Bessel Function, Elliptical Integrals, Min-max Approximation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCody, W.J.; Garbow, Burton S.\n\n1975-01-01\n\n1 - Description of problem or function: FUNPACK is a collection of FORTRAN subroutines to evaluate certain special functions.

This load-displacement data is a direct function of material's innate stress-strain behavior. Thus, theoretically it is possible to extract mechanical properties of a material through nanoindentation. However, due to various nonlinearities associated with nanoindentation the process of interpreting load-displacement data into material properties is difficult. Although, simple elastic behavior can be characterized easily, a method to characterize complicated material behavior such as nonlinear viscoelasticity is still lacking. In this study, a nanoindentation-based material characterization technique is developed to characterize soft materials exhibiting nonlinear viscoelasticity. Nanoindentation experiment was modeled in finite element analysis software (ABAQUS), where a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior was incorporated using user-defined subroutine (UMAT). The model parameters were calibrated using a process called inverse analysis. In this study, a surrogate model-based approach was used for the inverse analysis. The different factors affecting the surrogate model performance are analyzed in order to optimize the performance with respect to the computational cost.\n\nUtility subroutine package used by Applied Physics Division export codes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAdams, C.H.; Derstine, K.L.; Henryson, H.

H.; Zang, Y.\n\n2013-11-01\n\nIn this paper, a blanking process of sheet metal is studied by the methods of numerical simulation and experimental observation. The effects of varying technological parameters related to the quality of products are investigated. An elastoplastic constitutive equation accounting for isotropic ductile damage is implemented into the finite element code ABAQUS with a user-defined material subroutine UMAT. The simulations of the damage evolution and ductile fracture in a sheet metal blanking process have been carried out by the FEM. In order to guarantee computation accuracy and avoid numerical divergence during large plastic deformation, a specified remeshing technique is successively applied when severe element distortion occurs. In the simulation, the evolutions of damage at different stage of the blanking process have been evaluated and the distributions of damage obtained from simulation are in proper agreement with the experimental results.\n\nPlastic limit pressure of spherical vessels with combined hardening involving large deformation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLeu, S.-Y.; Liao, K.-C.; Lin, Y.-C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe paper aims to investigate plastic limit pressure of spherical vessels of nonlinear combined isotropic/kinematic hardening materials. The Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model is adopted and the Voce hardening law is incorporated for isotropic hardening behavior. Analytically, we extend sequential limit analysis to deal with combined isotropic/kinematic hardening materials. Further, exact solutions of plastic limit pressure were developed analytically by conducting both static and kinematic limit analysis. The onset of instability was also derived and solved iteratively by Newton's method. Numerically, elasticâplastic analysis is also performed by the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS incorporated with the user subroutine UMAT implemented with user materials of combined hardening.

Liu\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a finite element implementation of a strain-hardening DruckerâPrager model and its application to tunnel excavation. The computational model was constructed based on the return mapping scheme, in which an elastic trial step was first executed, followed by plastic correction involving the NewtonâRaphson method to return the predicted state of stresses to the supposed yield surface. By combining the plastic shear hardening rule and stress correction equations, the loading index for the strain-hardening DruckerâPrager model was solved. It is therefore possible to update the stresses, elastic and plastic strains, and slope of the yield locus at the end of each incremental step. As an illustrative example, an integration algorithm was incorporated into ABAQUS through the user subroutine UMAT to solve the tunnel excavation problem in strain-hardening DruckerâPrager rock formations. The obtained numerical results were found to be in excellent agreement with the available analytical solutions, thus indicating the validity and accuracy of the proposed UMAT code, as well as the finite element model.\n\nT-H-A-T-S: timber-harvesting-and-transport-simulator: with subroutines for Appalachian logging\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nA.

The material structure where radiation propagates is assumed to consist of homogeneous bodies limited by quadric surfaces. The PENGEOM subroutines (a subset of the PENELOPE code) track particles through the material structure, independently of the details of the physics models adopted to describe the interactions. Although these subroutines are designed for detailed simulations of photon and electron transport, where all individual interactions are simulated sequentially, they can also be used in mixed (class II) schemes for simulating the transport of high-energy charged particles, where the effect of soft interactions is described by the random-hinge method. The definition of the geometry and the details of the tracking algorithm are tailored to optimize simulation speed. The use of fuzzy quadric surfaces minimizes the impact of round-off errors. The provided software includes a Java graphical user interface for editing and debugging the geometry definition file and for visualizing the material structure. Images of the structure are generated by using the tracking subroutines and, hence, they describe the geometry actually passed to the simulation code.\n\nAn Image-Based Finite Element Approach for Simulating Viscoelastic Response of Asphalt Mixture\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWenke Huang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents an image-based micromechanical modeling approach to predict the viscoelastic behavior of asphalt mixture. An improved image analysis technique based on the OTSU thresholding operation was employed to reduce the beam hardening effect in X-ray CT images. We developed a voxel-based 3D digital reconstruction model of asphalt mixture with the CT images after being processed. In this 3D model, the aggregate phase and air void were considered as elastic materials while the asphalt mastic phase was considered as linear viscoelastic material. The viscoelastic constitutive model of asphalt mastic was implemented in a finite element code using the ABAQUS user material subroutine (UMAT. An experimental procedure for determining the parameters of the viscoelastic constitutive model at a given temperature was proposed. To examine the capability of the model and the accuracy of the parameter, comparisons between the numerical predictions and the observed laboratory results of bending and compression tests were conducted. Finally, the verified digital sample of asphalt mixture was used to predict the asphalt mixture viscoelastic behavior under dynamic loading and creep-recovery loading. Simulation results showed that the presented image-based digital sample may be appropriate for predicting the mechanical behavior of asphalt mixture when all the mechanical properties for different phases became available.\n\nAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE MECHANICS OF SINGLE CRYSTAL TURBINE BLADES WITH A VIEW TOWARDS ENHANCING GAS TURBINE EFFICIENCY\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nK.R.

The objective of the investigation was to develop a thermodynamic model that can be used to describe the response of single crystal superalloys that takes into account the microstructure of the alloy within the context of a continuum model. Having developed the model, its efficacy was to be tested by corroborating the predictions of the model with available experimental data. Such a model was developed and it is implemented in the finite element software ABAQUS/STANDARD through a user subroutine (UMAT) so that the model can be used in realistic geometries that correspond to turbine blades.\n\nREADKO - a subroutine package for centralized input- and output operations in KAPROS (Version 1.8)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKuefner, K.\n\n1982-06-01\n\nSubroutines are presented for the FORTRAN statements related to unformated (binary) data transfer. The cells are identical for all file realizations supported by KAPROS (data blocks, external units). Only at run-time of a module the actual realizations of the files are fixed. In this way, the input- and output-statements of a program are centralized, thereby greatly facilitating the KAPROS implementation of a program as well as the adoption of a KAPROS module for a 'stand alone' environment.

A subroutine library for graphic representation from J. E. N. Fusion Division\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGuasp, J.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA library for graphic representation, named ELBERETH, has been built, all the subroutines have been written in FORTRAN-V for the UN IVAC-1100/80 computers from JEN and are able to produce drawing on the CALCOMP-936 plotter, as well as with the printers and on the UTS-400 terminal screen.

H.; Prahl, U.; Bleck, W.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nDislocation-density-dependent physical-based constitutive models of metal plasticity while are computationally efficient and history-dependent, can accurately account for varying process parameters such as strain, strain rate and temperature; different loading modes such as continuous deformation, creep and relaxation; microscopic metallurgical processes; and varying chemical composition within an alloy family. Since these models are founded on essential phenomena dominating the deformation, they have a larger range of usability and validity. Also, they are suitable for manufacturing chain simulations since they can efficiently compute the cumulative effect of the various manufacturing processes by following the material state through the entire manufacturing chain and also interpass periods and give a realistic prediction of the material behavior and final product properties. In the physical-based constitutive model of cold metal plasticity introduced in this study, physical processes influencing cold and warm plastic deformation in polycrystalline metals are described using physical/metallurgical internal variables such as dislocation density and effective grain size. The evolution of these internal variables are calculated using adequate equations that describe the physical processes dominating the material behavior during cold plastic deformation. For validation, the model is numerically implemented in general implicit isotropic elasto-viscoplasticity algorithm as a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) in ABAQUS/Standard and used for finite element simulation of upsetting tests and a complete cold forging cycle of case hardenable MnCr steel family.\n\nACQUA97 - a Fortran subroutine to evaluate the IAPWS-IF97 equations of state for water and steam\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVeloso, Marcelo A.; Dias, Marcio S.; Fortini, Maria Auxiliadora\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFundamental to subroutine ACQUA97 is the IAPWS-IF97 formulation for the thermodynamic properties of water and steam adopted by the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) in 1997. This new formulation is designed specifically for industrial applications, and replaces the previous industrial formulation, IFC-67, that has formed the basis of steam tables used in many areas of steam power industry throughout the world since the late 1960's. ACQUA97 has been programmed to compute the thermodynamic properties of water and steam (pressure, temperature, specific volume, specific entropy, specific enthalpy, and internal specific energy) and their main first partial derivatives for several combinations of two independent variables. One of the independent variable is either pressure or temperature. Vapor-liquid saturation properties are calculated at specified temperature or pressure. Transport properties (dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity) and vapor-liquid surface tension are also calculated with formulations adopted by IAPWS. Any of the above mentioned thermophysical properties can be computed by this single subroutine from a simple main program supplied by the user. ACQUA97 might be very useful to those who deal with design and evaluation of thermal power plants.

E.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nOne issue which is central in developing a general purpose Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) subroutine on a distributed memory parallel machine is the data distribution. It is possible that different users would like to use the FFT routine with different data distributions. Thus, there is a need to design FFT schemes on distributed memory parallel machines which can support a variety of data distributions. An FFT implementation on a distributed memory parallel machine which works for a number of data distributions commonly encountered in scientific applications is presented. The problem of rearranging the data after computing the FFT is also addressed. The performance of the implementation on a distributed memory parallel machine Intel iPSC/860 is evaluated.\n\nPreliminary Development of a Unified Viscoplastic Constitutive Model for Alloy 617 with Special Reference to Long Term Creep Behavior\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSham, Sam; Walker, Kevin P.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe expected service life of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant is 60 years. Structural analyses of the Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) will require the development of unified viscoplastic constitutive models that address the material behavior of Alloy 617, a construction material of choice, over a wide range of strain rates. Many unified constitutive models employ a yield stress state variable which is used to account for cyclic hardening and softening of the material. For low stress values below the yield stress state variable these constitutive models predict that no inelastic deformation takes place which is contrary to experimental results. The ability to model creep deformation at low stresses for the IHX application is very important as the IHX operational stresses are restricted to very small values due to the low creep strengths at elevated temperatures and long design lifetime. This paper presents some preliminary work in modeling the unified viscoplastic constitutive behavior of Alloy 617 which accounts for the long term, low stress, creep behavior and the hysteretic behavior of the material at elevated temperatures. The preliminary model is presented in one-dimensional form for ease of understanding, but the intent of the present work is to produce a three-dimensional model suitable for inclusion in the user subroutines UMAT and USERPL of the ABAQUS and ANSYS nonlinear finite element codes. Further experiments and constitutive modeling efforts are planned to model the material behavior of Alloy 617 in more detail\n\nComparison of DT neutron production codes MCUNED, ENEA-JSI source subroutine and DDT\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nÄufar, AljaÅ¾, E-mail: aljaz.cufar@ijs.si [Reactor Physics Department, JoÅ¾ef Stefan Institute, Jamova cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana (Slovenia); Lengar, Igor; Kodeli, Ivan [Reactor Physics Department, JoÅ¾ef Stefan Institute, Jamova cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana (Slovenia); Milocco, Alberto [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Culham Science Centre, Abingdon, OX14 3DB (United Kingdom); Sauvan, Patrick [Departamento de IngenierÃ­a EnergÃ©tica, E.T.S.

Two typical deuteron beam energies, 100 keV and 250 keV, were used in the comparison. â¢ Comparisons of the angular dependence of the total neutron flux and spectrum as well as the neutron spectrum of all the neutrons emitted from the target show general agreement of the results but also some noticeable differences. â¢ A comparison of figures of merit of the calculations using different codes showed that the computational time necessary to achieve the same statistical uncertainty can vary for more than 30Ã when different codes for the simulation of the DT neutron generator are used. - Abstract: As the DT fusion reaction produces neutrons with energies significantly higher than in fission reactors, special fusion-relevant benchmark experiments are often performed using DT neutron generators. However, commonly used Monte Carlo particle transport codes such as MCNP or TRIPOLI cannot be directly used to analyze these experiments since they do not have the capabilities to model the production of DT neutrons. Three of the available approaches to model the DT neutron generator source are the MCUNED code, the ENEA-JSI DT source subroutine and the DDT code. The MCUNED code is an extension of the well-established and validated MCNPX Monte Carlo code. The ENEA-JSI source subroutine was originally prepared for the modelling of the FNG experiments using different versions of the MCNP code (â4, â5, âX) and was later extended to allow the modelling of both DT and DD neutron sources. The DDT code prepares the DT source definition file (SDEF card in MCNP) which can then be used in different versions of the MCNP code. In the paper the methods for the simulation of the DT neutron production used in the codes are briefly described and compared for the case of a\n\nAutomated Reuse of Scientific Subroutine Libraries through Deductive Synthesis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLowry, Michael R.; Pressburger, Thomas; VanBaalen, Jeffrey; Roach, Steven\n\n1997-01-01\n\nSystematic software construction offers the potential of elevating software engineering from an art-form to an engineering discipline. The desired result is more predictable software development leading to better quality and more maintainable software. However, the overhead costs associated with the formalisms, mathematics, and methods of systematic software construction have largely precluded their adoption in real-world software development. In fact, many mainstream software development organizations, such as Microsoft, still maintain a predominantly oral culture for software development projects; which is far removed from a formalism-based culture for software development. An exception is the limited domain of safety-critical software, where the high-assuiance inherent in systematic software construction justifies the additional cost. We believe that systematic software construction will only be adopted by mainstream software development organization when the overhead costs have been greatly reduced. Two approaches to cost mitigation are reuse (amortizing costs over many applications) and automation. For the last four years, NASA Ames has funded the Amphion project, whose objective is to automate software reuse through techniques from systematic software construction. In particular, deductive program synthesis (i.e., program extraction from proofs) is used to derive a composition of software components (e.g., subroutines) that correctly implements a specification. The construction of reuse libraries of software components is the standard software engineering solution for improving software development productivity and quality.\n\nAlgorithm 589. SICEDR: a FORTRAN subroutine for improving the accuracy of computed matrix eigenvalues\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDongarra, J.J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nSICEDR is a FORTRAN subroutine for improving the accuracy of a computed real eigenvalue and improving or computing the associated eigenvector. It is first used to generate information during the determination of the eigenvalues by the Schur decomposition technique. In particular, the Schur decomposition technique results in an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper quasi-triangular matrix T, such that A = QTQ/sup T/. Matrices A, Q, and T and the approximate eigenvalue, say lambda, are then used in the improvement phase. SICEDR uses an iterative method similar to iterative improvement for linear systems to improve the accuracy of lambda and improve or compute the eigenvector x in O(n 2 ) work, where n is the order of the matrix A\n\nMicromechanics and constitutive modeling of connective soft tissues.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFallah, A; Ahmadian, M T; Firozbakhsh, K; Aghdam, M M\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIn this paper, a micromechanical model for connective soft tissues based on the available histological evidences is developed. The proposed model constituents i.e. collagen fibers and ground matrix are considered as hyperelastic materials. The matrix material is assumed to be isotropic Neo-Hookean while the collagen fibers are considered to be transversely isotropic hyperelastic. In order to take into account the effects of tissue structure in lower scales on the macroscopic behavior of tissue, a strain energy density function (SEDF) is developed for collagen fibers based on tissue hierarchical structure. Macroscopic response and properties of tissue are obtained using the numerical homogenization method with the help of ABAQUS software. The periodic boundary conditions and the proposed constitutive models are implemented into ABAQUS using the DISP and the UMAT subroutines, respectively. The existence of the solution and stable material behavior of proposed constitutive model for collagen fibers are investigated based on the poly-convexity condition. Results of the presented micromechanics model for connective tissues are compared and validated with available experimental data. Effects of geometrical and material parameters variation at microscale on macroscopic mechanical behavior of tissues are investigated. The results show that decrease in collagen content of the connective tissues like the tendon due to diseases leads 20% more stretch than healthy tissue under the same load which can results in connective tissue malfunction and hypermobility in joints.

We propose a damage mechanics model to quantify and predict such changes as an alternative to fracture mechanics formulations. Our predictions are obtained by assuming that there are no flaws at the onset of loading as opposed to the assumptions of fracture mechanics approaches. We calibrate the crack onset strain and the damage model based on experimental data reported in the literature. We predict crack density and changes in electrical resistance as a function of the damage induced in the films. We implement our model in the commercial finite element software ABAQUS using a user subroutine UMAT. We obtain fair to good agreement with experiments.
