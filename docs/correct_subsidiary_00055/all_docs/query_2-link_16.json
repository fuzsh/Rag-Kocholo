        "text": "ROCKVILLE, Md., Dec. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Nabi Biopharmaceuticals announced today that it has completed the sale of assets constituting its Biologics strategic business unit (SBU) to Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biotest AG, for $185 million in cash. Subject to the interim arrangements described below, Biotest has acquired or will acquire the Biologics SBU’s products, including Nabi- HB(R) and other plasma business assets, including Nabi’s state-of-the-art plasma protein production plant and nine FDA-certified plasma collection centers across the U.S. The acquisition also includes certain of Nabi’s Corporate Shared Services group assets, the company’s Boca Raton, Florida headquarters and other facilities as well as the assumption of certain liabilities.\n\nNabi Biopharmaceuticals is now headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nNabi will retain, on an interim basis pending Biotest’s receipt of certain Florida regulatory approvals and licenses, title to all Nabi-HB(R) inventory and work-in-progress, and regulatory oversight and operational authority for the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of Nabi-HB(R). Upon receipt of such regulatory approvals, title to Nabi-HB(R) inventory and work-in- progress, and oversight and authority for the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of Nabi-HB(R) will transfer to Biotest. During the interim period prior to receipt of such approvals, revenues and expenses relating to Nabi-HB(R) sales shall be attributed to Biotest and Biotest shall indemnify Nabi for liability arising from post-closing conduct of the Biologics SBU.\n\n“The completion of this transaction marks a significant milestone in our strategic alternatives process. Nabi is now focused on building and realizing the significant value of Nabi’s remaining assets including NicVax, our proprietary smoking cessation vaccine for treatment of nicotine addiction and prevention of smoking relapse, StaphVax, and our cash and PhosLo milestone and royalty opportunities,” said Dr. Leslie Hudson, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Nabi.\n\nAbout Nabi Biopharmaceuticals\n\nNabi Biopharmaceuticals leverages its experience and knowledge in powering the immune system to develop products that target serious medical conditions in the areas of gram positive bacterial infections and nicotine addiction. Nabi Biopharmaceuticals is currently developing NicVAX, an innovative and proprietary investigational vaccine for treatment of nicotine addiction and prevention of smoking relapse, and StaphVAX, a vaccine designed to prevent the most dangerous and prevalent strains of S. aureus bacterial infections. The company is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.
