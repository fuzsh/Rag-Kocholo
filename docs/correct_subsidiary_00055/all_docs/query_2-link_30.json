        "text": "Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the worldwide phosphate binder business (PhosLo) from Nabi Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (Nabi). PhosLo is a calcium acetate phosphate binder for oral application in end-stage renal disease patients that has total product line revenues in the U.S. of approximately $40 million. The total consideration paid in the transaction will be $65 million cash at closing, royalties on a new potential product formulation plus milestone payments. The milestone payments consist of $10 million expected to be paid in 2007 and $10 million to be paid over the next two to three years, contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones.\n\nExcess phosphate consumed with food is normally removed by the kidneys in a process that can only partially be replaced by dialysis in patients with chronic kidney failure. Too much phosphate in the blood can result in a number of adverse events, including bone disease, thyroid problems and vascular calcification. The risk of such damage in end-stage renal disease patients can be lowered by regularly taking phosphate binders. Currently, the phosphate binder market exceeds $500 million worldwide.\n\nDr. Ben Lipps, Chairman of the Management Board and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"Our acquisition of the PhosLo product line represents an important strategic step. With PhosLo, we are able to expand our clinical therapy offerings using safe, effective and proven drugs. We plan to use PhosLo as part of our overall integrated \"pharma-tech\" therapy to better manage bone mineralization during dialysis treatment. This acquisition enhances our growth opportunities in this important new initiative for Fresenius Medical Care.\"\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Act. The Company anticipates closing this transaction in 2006.\n\n# # #"
