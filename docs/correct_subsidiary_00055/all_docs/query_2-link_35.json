        "text": "Anti-infective drug developer Biota is to merge with United States-based Nabi Pharmaceuticals to form a new company that will be listed on America's Nasdaq index.\n\nThe new company will be called Biota Pharmaceuticals and headquartered in the US.\n\nBiota had flagged a possible listing on the Nasdaq at its annual general meeting in November 2011.\n\n\"The Biota move to the US is designed to achieve better value recognition and liquidity through a stronger US shareholder base,\" Biota said in a statement on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, Nabi will acquire all of the shares in Biota for new shares in Biota Pharmaceuticals.\n\nBiota will then be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nCurrent Biota shareholders will own about 74 per cent of Biota Pharmaceuticals, and Nabi shareholders will own about 26 per cent.\n\n\"A Nasdaq listing provides Biota with access to the largest healthcare capital market in the world and will enable us to transform our business model to one which can deliver significantly higher value than the royalty-only model we have historically pursued,\" Biota chairman Jim Fox said.\n\n\"We believe this is a necessary step to increase our options for the development and commercialisation of our product portfolio and will ultimately improve the recognition of the underlying value of our product portfolio for our shareholders.\"\n\nBiota has expertise in respiratory diseases, particularly influenza, and developed the flu drug Relenza, which is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nAlso, Biota and Japan's Daiichi Sankyo co-own some \"second-generation\" flu drugs, of which the lead product, laninamivir, is marketed in Japan under the brand Inavir.\n\nBiota holds a contract from the US Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the advanced development of laninamivir in the US.\n\nNabi Biopharmaceuticals develops products that target medical conditions in the areas of nicotine addiction and bacterial infections.\n\nNabi's sole remaining product currently in development is NicVAX (Nicotine Conjugate Vaccine), a vaccine for treatment of nicotine addiction and prevention of smoking relapse.\n\nThe merger will require approval from both Biota and Nabi shareholders."
