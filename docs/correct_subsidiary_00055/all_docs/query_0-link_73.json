Polk & Co., Publishers if ^ \"-^ O * Association of Nortli American Directory Pubiisliers vD INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INDEX R. L. POLK & CO., publishers of more than 1,400 city, county, state and national Directories, present to subscribers and the general public, this, the 1969 edition of the Waltham City Directory. Confidence in the growth of Waltham' s industry, population and wealth, and in the advancement of its civic and social activities, will be maintained as sections of this Directory are consulted, for the Directory is a m.irror truly reflecting Waltham to the world. The enviable position occupied by R. L. POLK & CO.'S Directories in the estimation of the public throughout the country, has been established by ren- dering the best in Directory service. With an unrivaled organization, and having had the courteous and hearty cooperation of the business and profes- sional men and residents, the publishers feel that the result of their labors will meet with the approval of every user, and that the Waltham Directory will fulfill its mission as a source of authentic information pertaining to the city. Four Major Departments The four major departments are arranged in the following order: — I. THE BUYERS' GUIDE constitutes the first major department of the Directory, printed on yellow paper. In the first section of this department, grouped under^ppropriate headings, are included the advertisements and business cards of firms and individuals desiring to make a complete presen- tation of their products or services. Following this is the Classified Business section, which embraces a list of the names and addresses of all business and professional concerns of the city, arranged in alphabetical order under appro- priate headings— a catalog of all the activities of the city. The Buyers' Guide represents reference advertising at its best, and merits the attention of all buyers and sellers seeking sources of supply or markets for goods. In a busy and diversified community like Waltham, the necessity of having this kind of information up-to-date and always immediately available, is obvious. The Di- rectory is the common intermediary between buyer and seller, and plays an important role in the daily activities of the commercial, industrial and pro- fessional world. II. THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF NAMES of residents and business and professional concerns is the second major department, included on white paper. This is the only record in existence that aims to show the name, mari- tal status, occupation and address of each adult resident of Waltham, and the name, official personnel, nature and address of each firm and corporation in the city. III. THE DIRECTORY OF HOUSEHOLDERS, INCLUDING STREET AND AVENUE GUIDE is the third major department, printed on green paper. In this section the numbered streets are arranged in numerical order, followed by the named streets in alphabetical order; the numbers of the residences and business concerns are arranged in numerical order under the name of each street, and the names of the householders and concerns are placed opposite the numbers. The names of the intersecting streets appear at their respective crossing points on each street. Special features of this section are the desig- nation of owner occupied homes, the listing of telephone numbers and ZIP WM.THMI PUBUCUnMiY IV INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INDEX IV. THE rsTUMERICAL TELEPHONE DIRECTORY the fourth major de- partment, is printed on blue paper. Municipal Publicity The Directory reflects the achievements and ambitions of the city, de- picting in unbiased terms what it has to offer as a place of residence, as a business location, as a manufacturing site and as an educational center. To broadcast this information, the publishers have placed copies of this issue of the Directory in Directory Libraries, where they are readily available for free public reference, and serve as perpetual and reliable advertisements of Waltham, The Waltham Directory Library Through the courtesy of the publishers of the Waltham City Directory, a Directory Library is maintained in the offices of the Chamber of Commerce, for free reference by the general public. This is one of more than 1,000 Di- rectory Libraries installed in cities and towns throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico by members of the Association of North American Directory Publishers, under whose supervision the system is operated. The publishers appreciatively acknowledge the recognition by those pro- gressive business and professional men who have demonstrated their confi- dence in the City Directory as an advertising medium, with assurance that it will bring a commensurate return.

HISTORY Incorporated as a town in 1738, Voted to apply for City Charter November 30, 1883. Incorporation act approved June 2, 1884. Accepted by town July 16, 1884. Election of first Mayor and Aldermen December 2, 1884. Inauguration of first Mayor January 5, 1885. Situated on the beautiful Charles River, nine miles west of Boston, the rich and fertile plain on which stands the present city of Waltham was called \"Eden Vale\" by the earliest settlers. In 1738, this area, which then comprised the Western Precinct of the town of Watertown was incorporated as a separate town and named Waltham, but it was not until the establishment of a paper mill in 17 88, that it became any- thing more than an agricultural community. Additional information on the history of Waltham and the many historical points of interest can be obtained from the Waltham Historical Society, lo- cated at the Lyman House (The Vale) on 185 Lyman Street. Miss Marjorie Childs, curator. Information is also available at the Waltham Public Library. Gore Place One of the early Governors of Massachusetts, Christopher Gore (1809-10), built a magnificent house (1805) with bricks brought from England, and sur- rounded it with imported shrubs and trees. The property, especially the house and immediate grounds, is being restored to its former grandeur and historic attractiveness by the present owners, the Gore Place Society. Open April 15- Noverniber 15, Gore Place, Waltham, Massachusetts. INTRODUCTION IX Lyman House (The Vale) This magaificent and unsurpassed country residence has been presented to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities through the generosity of five children of the late Arthur and Susan C. Lyman, descend- ants of the original Theodore Lyman. It is located on Lyman Street as its junction with Beaver Street. Erected in 1793 by Theodore Lyman, a Boston merchant, \"The Vale\" was designed by the noted American architect Samuel Mclntire. Several features of the spacious building reveal Bulfinch's influence on the great Salem architect of that early day, Mclntire. The house is a cen- tral motif of an estate of 36 acres with spacious lawns, old and modern green- houses and many attractive shrubs, flowering vines, plants and trees, some of the latter being 200 year old specimens. The place is open for inspection from early June until the middle of September with a nominal charge of ad- mission to help maintain the interesting estate. Boys' Club of Waltham One of the nation's finest youth centers occupied 38,000 square feet of land on Exchange Street, a short distance from Central Square. Valued at an estimated million dollars, the Waltham Boys' Club was erected for $680,000 on a \"self-help\" plan designed to make two dollars do the work of three. Citizens raised $190,000 in a capital fund drive and by self-help qualified for matching dollar assistance from the Charles Hayden Foundation to complete the facility. The building, dedicated on November 24, 1952, is designed for a membership of 2,000 boys. It contains the William H. Nichols Gymnasium, the Thomas Worcester Auditorium, a flush- deck swimming pool with spectator facilities for 300, and games and crafts rooms. Special activities are made available to girls, women and men, as well as to adult groups when it will not encroach upon the boys' schedule. The Boy's Club is a Red Feather agency and supported in part from funds raised by the United Fund of Greater Bos- ton. HEARTLAND OF INDUSTRY AND ELECTRONICS If a study were to be made of communities that have experienced g'reat in- dustrial expansion in recent years, Waltham would be found among the lead- ers. The city has had a minimum of difficulty accepting the changes that have taken place with the advent of the electronics era. As most everyone knows, Waltham was the home of the world-famous Waltham Watch Company for more than 100 years. It discontinued operations early in the 1950's, but Waltham's reputation as a \"City of Precision\" was maintained by the continuing growth of other precision-orientated companies and was accelerated by the extraordinary industrial development along Route 128 — \"USA's Number One Electronics Highway.\" This highway has brought to Waltham not only extensive industrial growth but industrial diversification as well. While electronics research and pro- duction dominate in Waltham, the community has some 300 firms, large and small, in other lines. Included among the products manufactured are: electri- cal machinery, fabricated metal products, machines and machine tools, riv- ets, business forms, mica products, microfilm, screw machine products, grinding wheels, gauges, batteries, jewel bearings, pumps, as well as elec- tronic systems equipment, microwave and power tubes, experimental labora- tories, radar, research and many other products and industrial activities. Agriculture Although Waltham has long been known throughout the world as the home of high grade industries engaged in the manufacture of quality products. It has always maintained its position as an important agricultural center. Here are located the headquarters of the Middlesex County Farm Bureau. In the beauti- ful section of the city known as Cedar Hills is located the Waltham Field Sta- tion, a branch of the University of Massachusetts. Experiments are in prog- ress in vegetable gardening, fruit growing and ornamental horticulture. Civic pride is strong among the residents of Waltham, and at the Field Station our INTRODUCTION citizens receive help and free information regarding the maintenance of their lawns and shrubbery and the general upkeep of the home grounds. Retail Waltham stores are well stocked and well managed and carry a complete range of merchandise at prices as favorable as any in the large centers. Ap- proximately 2,300 persons are employed in Waltham's approximate 487 retail outlets, on a full-time basis. An extra 1,009 are employed on a part-time basis. Banking Facilities December 31, 1968 The Newton -Waltham Bank & Trust Co., the largest commercial bank, has resources of $157,616,034. Waltham has a Savings Bank over 100 years old, with assets of $70,556,932. The Waltham Federal Savings & Loan Association was organized in 1880, federalized March 1, 1937, and the present resources are $78,86 8,996. The Waltham Citizens National Bank was opened on September 5, 1946 and lists resources of $13,463,218. The Guaranty Trust Co., opened January 21, 1952, and lists assets of $28,934,342. The Middlesex Family Co- operative Bank started operations on January 25, 1954, and lists assets of $4,146,886. Churches There are twenty-five church congregations, also numerous philanthropic societies, including the Waltham Community Fund, Inc., embracing 8 relief, social service, philanthropic and character-building agencies. Fraternal Societies Nearly every leading fraternal society has at least one branch in the city, while some have more than one. The stranger in the city will find here to welcome him thos affiliated with his own organization.

Fernald State School for the Feeble Minded, the oldest of its kind in this country, present capacity 2,525 beds. Waltham Housing Authority The Waltham Housing Authority, established in 1948, constructs, man- ages and maintains housing for families of low income and elderly persons 6 5 years of age and older. Rentals are based on income and family size, with Veterans preference for family size units. Total program-505 units, 278 for families, 227 for the Elderly. Authority is now engaged in leasing 100 units from private landlords— fifty for Elderly and fifty for families. The Waltham Housing Authority Chairman is Edward W. Costello and Charles A. Lawless is the Executive Director. The office is located at 5 Brookway Road, Waltham. INTRODUCTION XI Transportation Facilities Waltham is situated ia the fourth largest metropolitan district, which in itself insures aa excellent local market for all kinds of products. It is con- nected with Boston by two railroad lines, the Massachusetts Central and the Fitchburg Division of the Boston & Main Railroad, the latter offering excel- lent rail shipments to the Central, West, Far West and Northern and Canadian points. Motor truck lines add to the ease of quick shipping facilities. Together with the Watertown Branch, these three roads provide ample shipping facili- ties, with spur tracks available when needed. It is only a short haul by truck to tap the main line of the Boston & Albany Railroad at Newtonville providing quick rail transportation to points South and West. Inter-city bus service is provided by the Middlesex & Boston Street Railway Co. Motor Routes For the motor enthusiast, Waltham is an ideal center. Many main thor- oughfares converge at Waltham Common, giving a choice of routes to the Berkshire Hills, Cape Cod, or the White Mountains. U. S. Route 20 passes through Waltham to Boston, 9 miles east. Route 128 by-passes the city at its westerly boundary with Weston, The Massachusetts Turnpike eastern termi- nus is located 1.7 miles south of the Route 128-20 junction in Waltham. Advantages of Waltham Waltham has splendid roads, fine schools, congenial social conditions, a rated standard of citizenship, convenience to shipping points, nearness to a market, excellent transportation facilities, sanitation above average, abundant recreation and amusement facilities, the advantages of homes in the open spaces combined with urban conveniences— these are the qualities that go to make a city desirable— and Waltham has them all. The Waltham Chamber of Commerce, composed of over 400 business and civic leaders of the city, welcomes inquiries and will be glad to make a com- plete and intelligent survey of the situation for acceptable prospective indus- try or business. Waltham's new $2,500,000 Municipal Service Center which houses the city's public motor vehicle fleet, fire, police and public works department head- quarters is **A modern monument. . .to a changing city.\" Mike O'Neil, Photographer Waltham, Massachusetts.
