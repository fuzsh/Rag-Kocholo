        "text": "PACS quality control and automatic problem notifier\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoneyman-Buck, Janice C.; Jones, Douglas; Frost, Meryll M.; Staab, Edward V.\n\n1997-05-01\n\nOne side effect of installing a clinical PACS Is that users become dependent upon the technology and in some cases it can be very difficult to revert back to a film based system if components fail. The nature of system failures range from slow deterioration of function as seen in the loss of monitor luminance through sudden catastrophic loss of the entire PACS networks. This paper describes the quality control procedures in place at the University of Florida and the automatic notification system that alerts PACS personnel when a failure has happened or is anticipated. The goal is to recover from a failure with a minimum of downtime and no data loss. Routine quality control is practiced on all aspects of PACS, from acquisition, through network routing, through display, and including archiving. Whenever possible, the system components perform self and between platform checks for active processes, file system status, errors in log files, and system uptime. When an error is detected or a exception occurs, an automatic page is sent to a pager with a diagnostic code. Documentation on each code, trouble shooting procedures, and repairs are kept on an intranet server accessible only to people involved in maintaining the PACS. In addition to the automatic paging system for error conditions, acquisition is assured by an automatic fax report sent on a daily basis to all technologists acquiring PACS images to be used as a cross check that all studies are archived prior to being removed from the acquisition systems. Daily quality control is preformed to assure that studies can be moved from each acquisition and contrast adjustment. The results of selected quality control reports will be presented. The intranet documentation server will be described with the automatic pager system. Monitor quality control reports will be described and the cost of quality control will be quantified. As PACS is accepted as a clinical tool, the same standards of quality control must be established\n\nHIPAA-compliant automatic monitoring system for RIS-integrated PACS operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJin, Jin; Zhang, Jianguo; Chen, Xiaomeng; Sun, Jianyong; Yang, Yuanyuan; Liang, Chenwen; Feng, Jie; Sheng, Liwei; Huang, H. K.\n\n2006-03-01\n\nAs a governmental regulation, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was issued to protect the privacy of health information that identifies individuals who are living or deceased. HIPAA requires security services supporting implementation features: Access control; Audit controls; Authorization control; Data authentication; and Entity authentication. These controls, which proposed in HIPAA Security Standards, are Audit trails here. Audit trails can be used for surveillance purposes, to detect when interesting events might be happening that warrant further investigation. Or they can be used forensically, after the detection of a security breach, to determine what went wrong and who or what was at fault. In order to provide security control services and to achieve the high and continuous availability, we design the HIPAA-Compliant Automatic Monitoring System for RIS-Integrated PACS operation. The system consists of two parts: monitoring agents running in each PACS component computer and a Monitor Server running in a remote computer. Monitoring agents are deployed on all computer nodes in RIS-Integrated PACS system to collect the Audit trail messages defined by the Supplement 95 of the DICOM standard: Audit Trail Messages. Then the Monitor Server gathers all audit messages and processes them to provide security information in three levels: system resources, PACS/RIS applications, and users/patients data accessing. Now the RIS-Integrated PACS managers can monitor and control the entire RIS-Integrated PACS operation through web service provided by the Monitor Server. This paper presents the design of a HIPAA-compliant automatic monitoring system for RIS-Integrated PACS Operation, and gives the preliminary results performed by this monitoring system on a clinical RIS-integrated PACS.\n\nHandling qualities of a wide-body transport airplane utilizing Pitch Active Control Systems (PACS) for relaxed static stability application\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGrantham, William D.; Person, Lee H., Jr.; Brown, Philip W.; Becker, Lawrence E.; Hunt, George E.; Rising, J. J.; Davis, W. J.; Willey, C. S.; Weaver, W. A.; Cokeley, R.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nPiloted simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two pitch active control systems (PACS) on the flying qualities of a wide-body transport airplane when operating at negative static margins. These two pitch active control systems consisted of a simple 'near-term' PACS and a more complex 'advanced' PACS. Eight different flight conditions, representing the entire flight envelope, were evaluated with emphasis on the cruise flight conditions. These studies were made utilizing the Langley Visual/Motion Simulator (VMS) which has six degrees of freedom. The simulation tests indicated that (1) the flying qualities of the baseline aircraft (PACS off) for the cruise and other high-speed flight conditions were unacceptable at center-of-gravity positions aft of the neutral static stability point; (2) within the linear static stability flight envelope, the near-term PACS provided acceptable flying qualities for static stabilty margins to -3 percent; and (3) with the advanced PACS operative, the flying qualities were demonstrated to be good (satisfactory to very acceptable) for static stabilty margins to -20 percent.\n\nReengineering the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) process for digital imaging networks PACS.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorton, M C; Lewis, T E; Kinsey, T V\n\n1999-05-01\n\nPrior to June 1997, military picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) were planned, procured, and installed with key decisions on the system, equipment, and even funding sources made through a research and development office called Medical Diagnostic Imaging Systems (MDIS). Beginning in June 1997, the Joint Imaging Technology Project Office (JITPO) initiated a collaborative and consultative process for planning and implementing PACS into military treatment facilities through a new Department of Defense (DoD) contract vehicle called digital imaging networks (DIN)-PACS. The JITPO reengineered this process incorporating multiple organizations and politics. The reengineered PACS process administered through the JITPO transformed the decision process and accountability from a single office to a consultative method that increased end-user knowledge, responsibility, and ownership in PACS. The JITPO continues to provide information and services that assist multiple groups and users in rendering PACS planning and implementation decisions. Local site project managers are involved from the outset and this end-user collaboration has made the sometimes difficult transition to PACS an easier and more acceptable process for all involved. Corporately, this process saved DoD sites millions by having PACS plans developed within the government and proposed to vendors second, and then having vendors respond specifically to those plans. The integrity and efficiency of the process have reduced the opportunity for implementing nonstandard systems while sharing resources and reducing wasted government dollars. This presentation will describe the chronology of changes, encountered obstacles, and lessons learned within the reengineering of the PACS process for DIN-PACS.\n\nPicture archiving and communication systems (PACS).\n\nPubMed\n\nGamsu, Gordon; Perez, Enrico\n\n2003-07-01\n\nOver the past 2 decades, groups of computer scientists, electronic design engineers, and physicians, in universities and industry, have worked to achieve an electronic environment for the practice of medicine and radiology. The radiology component of this revolution is often called PACS (picture archiving and communication systems). More recently it has become evident that the efficiencies and cost savings of PACS are realized when they are part of an enterprise-wide electronic medical record. The installation of PACS requires careful planning by all the various stakeholds over many months prior to installation. All of the users must be aware of the initial disruption that will occur as they become familiar with the systems. Modern fourth generation PACS is linked to radiology and hospital information systems. The PACS consist of electronic acquisition sites-a robust network intelligently managed by a server, multiple viewing sites, and an archive. The details of how these are linked and their workflow analysis determines the success of PACS. PACS evolves over time, components are frequently replaced, and so the users must expect continuous learning about new updates and improved functionality. The digital medical revolution is rapidly being adopted in many medical centers, improving patient care and the success of the institution.\n\nPACS: acceptance test, quality control, warranty, and maintenance continuum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRomlein, John R.; Norton, Gary S.; Lyche, David K.; Richardson, Ronald R., Jr.\n\n1999-07-01\n\nAs PACS gain greater acceptance and use in medical facilities the question of life cycle management must be addressed in terms that relate to the common business practices for medical information system and medical devices. The issues in life cycle management of such a system are relatively new to the industry. Increased use of PACS within the medical community requires that standardized life cycle management practices by developed and implemented. This paper develops a new of life cycle issues as cyclic and related events that are not only manageable, but also predictable in terms, of, frequency, duration data content, data exchange, potential outcomes, staffing requirement, documentation, and staff interaction. This view is presented as a continuum that begins at the acceptance testing of a PACS and continues throughout its life cycle. The continuum incorporates the required relationship between quality control testing and maintenance actions during warranty period and the maintenance years. Interrelated cyclic events are described that bind these processes together and provide a basis for long-term proactive management of PACS in a medical environment.\n\nWireless-PDA-controlled image workflow from PACS: the next trend in the health care enterprise?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErberich, Stephan G.; Documet, Jorge; Zhou, Michael Z.; Cao, Fei; Liu, Brent J.; Mogel, Greg T.; Huang, H. K.\n\n2003-05-01\n\nImage workflow in today's Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) is controlled from fixed Display Workstations (DW) using proprietary control interfaces. A remote access to the Hospital Information System (HIS) and Radiology Information System (RIS) for urgent patient information retrieval does not exist or gradually become available. The lack for remote access and workflow control for HIS and RIS is especially true when it comes to medical images of a PACS on Department or Hospital level. As images become more complex and data sizes expand rapidly with new image techniques like functional MRI, Mammography or routine spiral CT to name a few, the access and manageability becomes an important issue. Long image downloads or incomplete work lists cannot be tolerated in a busy health care environment. In addition, the domain of the PACS is no longer limited to the imaging department and PACS is also being used in the ER and emergency care units. Thus a prompt and secure access and manageability not only by the radiologist, but also from the physician becomes crucial to optimally utilize the PACS in the health care enterprise of the new millennium. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a concept and its implementation of a remote access and workflow control of the PACS combining wireless, Internet and Internet2 technologies. A wireless device, the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), is used to communicate to a PACS web server that acts as a gateway controlling the commands for which the user has access to the PACS server. The commands implemented for this test-bed are query/retrieve of the patient list and study list including modality, examination, series and image selection and pushing any list items to a selected DW on the PACS network.\n\nPicture Archiving And Communication Systems (PACS): Introductory Systems Analysis Considerations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHughes, Simon H. C.\n\n1983-05-01\n\nTwo fundamental problems face any hospital or radiology department that is thinking about installing a Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS). First, though the need for PACS already exists, much of the relevant technology is just beginning to be developed. Second, the requirements of each hospital are different, so that any attempts to market a single PACS design for use in large numbers of hospitals are likely to meet with the same problems as were experienced with general-purpose Hospital Information Systems. This paper outlines some of the decision processes involved in arriving at specifications for each module of a PACS and indicates design principles which should be followed in order to meet individual hospital requirements, while avoiding the danger of short-term systems obsolescence.\n\nPACS 2000: quality control using the task allocation chart\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNorton, Gary S.; Romlein, John R.; Lyche, David K.; Richardson, Ronald R., Jr.\n\n2000-05-01\n\nMedical imaging's technological evolution in the next century will continue to include Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS) and teleradiology. It is difficult to predict radiology's future in the new millennium with both computed radiography and direct digital capture competing as the primary image acquisition methods for routine radiography. Changes in Computed Axial Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) continue to amaze the healthcare community. No matter how the acquisition, display, and archive functions change, Quality Control (QC) of the radiographic imaging chain will remain an important step in the imaging process. The Task Allocation Chart (TAC) is a tool that can be used in a medical facility's QC process to indicate the testing responsibilities of the image stakeholders and the medical informatics department. The TAC shows a grid of equipment to be serviced, tasks to be performed, and the organization assigned to perform each task. Additionally, skills, tasks, time, and references for each task can be provided. QC of the PACS must be stressed as a primary element of a PACS' implementation. The TAC can be used to clarify responsibilities during warranty and paid maintenance periods. Establishing a TAC a part of a PACS implementation has a positive affect on patient care and clinical acceptance.\n\nPACS industry in Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Hee-Joung\n\n2002-05-01\n\nPACS industry in Korea has been rapidly growing, since government had supported collaborative PACS project between industry and university hospital. In the beginning, PACS industry had focused on developing peripheral PACS solutions, while the Korea PACS society was being formed. A few companies had started developing and installing domestic large-scale full-PACS system for teaching hospitals. Several years later, many hospitals have installed full-PACS system with national policy of reimbursement for PACS exams in November 1999. Both experiences of full-PACS installation and national policy generated tremendous intellectual and technological expertise about PACS at all levels, clinical, hospital management, education, and industrial sectors. There are now more than 20 domestic PACS companies. They have enough experiences which are capable of installing a truly full-PACS system for large-scale teaching hospitals. As an example, a domestic company had installed more than 40 full-PACS systems within 2-3 years. Enough experiences of full-PACS installation in Korea lead PACS industry to start exporting their full-PACS solutions. However, further understanding and timely implementation of continuously evolving international standard and integrated healthcare enterprise concepts may be necessary for international leading of PACS technologies for the future.\n\nOperator interface design considerations for a PACS information management system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteinke, James E.; Nabijee, Kamal H.; Freeman, Rick H.; Prior, Fred W.\n\n1990-08-01\n\nAs prototype PACS grow into fully digital departmental and hospital-wide systems, effective information storage and retrieval mechanisms become increasingly important. Thus far, designers of PACS workstations have concentrated on image communication and display functionality. The new challenge is to provide appropriate operator interface environments to facilitate information retrieval. The \"Marburg Model\" 1 provides a detailed analysis of the functions, control flows and data structures used in Radiology. It identifies a set of \"actors\" who perform information manipulation functions. Drawing on this model and its associated methodology it is possible to identify four modes of use of information systems in Radiology: Clinical Routine, Research, Consultation, and Administration. Each mode has its own specific access requirements and views of information. An operator interface strategy appropriate for each mode will be proposed. Clinical Routine mode is the principal concern of PACS primary diagnosis workstations. In a full PACS implementation, such workstations must provide a simple and consistent navigational aid for the on-line image database, a local work list of cases to be reviewed, and easy access to information from other hospital information systems. A hierarchical method of information access is preferred because it provides the ability to start at high-level entities and iteratively narrow the scope of information from which to select subsequent operations. An implementation using hierarchical, nested software windows which fulfills such requirements shall be examined.\n\nFuture trends in picture archiving and communication system (PACS)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAl-Hajeri, Mona; Clarke, Malcolm\n\n2015-03-01\n\nObjective: This research investigates the needs and opinions of radiologists on the use of enhanced information technologies and approaches to improve the functionality of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). Method: Six interviews were conducted in the main governmental hospital in Kuwait (AL-Sabah Hospital) with radiologists, including two senior radiologists, two junior radiologists, and two trainee radiologists undertaking the Irish radiology board. Results: The radiologists identified a number of limitations that exist in current PACS and requirements to enhance usability and functionality. However, it was the case that some of the radiologists had little knowledge about the advanced trends in PACS. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) limitations of traditional PACS; (2) Features and requirements that can increase PACS functionality; (3) web based solutions of PACS; (4) PACS in mobile phones. Conclusion: It is widely recognized that PACS has limitations. This research has identified themes that, when incorporated, will enhance the functionality of PACS and provide better quality clinical practice. This research has determined the important future trends of PACS. Primarily web based solutions and use in mobile phones. The findings from this research can be used as recommendations to vendors, for product development and medical institutes to consider when undertaking implementation of PACS and training future radiologists.\n\nReliability issues in PACS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaira, Ricky K.; Chan, Kelby K.; Stewart, Brent K.; Weinberg, Wolfram S.\n\n1991-07-01\n\nReliability is an increasing concern when moving PACS from the experimental laboratory to the clinical environment. Any system downtime may seriously affect patient care. The authors report on the several classes of errors encountered during the pre-clinical release of the PACS during the past several months and present the solutions implemented to handle them. The reliability issues discussed include: (1) environmental precautions, (2) database backups, (3) monitor routines of critical resources and processes, (4) hardware redundancy (networks, archives), and (5) development of a PACS quality control program.\n\nFactors causing PAC cake fouling in PAC-MF (powdered activated carbon-microfiltration) water treatment systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, P; Takizawa, S; Katayama, H; Ohgaki, S\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTwo pilot-scale powdered activated carbon-microfiltration (PAC-MF) reactors were operated using river water pretreated by a biofilter. A high permeate flux (4 m/d) was maintained in two reactors with different particle sizes of PAC. High concentration (20 g/L) in the PAC adsorption zone demonstrated 60-80% of organic removal rates. Analysis on the PAC cake fouling demonstrated that attached metal ions play more important role than organic matter attached on PAC to the increase of PAC cake resistance. Effects of factors which may cause PAC cake fouling in PAC-MF process were investigated and evaluated by batch experiments, further revealing that small particulates and metal ions in raw water impose prominent influence on the PAC cake layer formation. Fe (II) precipitates after being oxidized to Fe (III) during PAC adsorption and thus Fe(ll) colloids display more significant effect than other metal ions. At a high flux, PAC cake layer demonstrated a higher resistance with larger PAC due to association among colloids, metals and PAC particles, and easy migration of small particles in raw water into the void space in the PAC cake layer. Larger PAC possesses much more non-uniform particle size distribution and larger void space, making it easier for small colloids to migrate into the voids and for metal ions to associate with PAC particles by bridge effect, hence speeding up and intensifying the of PAC cake fouling on membrane surface.\n\nPACS in an intensive care unit: results from a randomized controlled trial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBryan, Stirling; Weatherburn, Gwyneth C.; Watkins, Jessamy; Walker, Samantha; Wright, Carl; Waters, Brian; Evans, Jeff; Buxton, Martin J.\n\n1998-07-01\n\nThe objective of this research was to assess the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a small PACS system into an intensive care unit (ICU) at a district general hospital in north Wales. The research design adopted for this study was a single center randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients were randomly allocated either to a trial arm where their x-ray imaging was solely film-based or to a trial arm where their x-ray imaging was solely PACS based. Benefit measures included examination-based process measures, such as image turn-round time, radiation dose and image unavailability; and patient-related process measures, which included adverse events and length of stay. The measurement of costs focused on additional 'radiological' costs and the costs of patient management. The study recruited 600 patients. The key findings from this study were that the installation of PACS was associated with important benefits in terms of image availability, and important costs in both monetary and radiation dose terms. PACS-related improvements in terms of more timely 'clinical actions' were not found. However, the qualitative aspect of the research found that clinicians were advocates of the technology and believed that an important benefit of PACS related to improved image availability.\n\nDefining the role of a PACS technologist.\n\nPubMed\n\nCabrera, Alfred\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAs hospitals convert from conventional image processing to picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) technology, new job opportunities arose for PACS analysts, PACS system administrators, PACS operators, and PACS trainers. To support a PACS, these positions require education in computer information systems and work experience in information technology. At Texas Children's Hospital, new roles for radiologic technologists (RT) in supporting the operation of PACS were not recognized until after implementation of the filmless system. A new position entitled PACS technologis was created, but roles and responsibilities largely were undefined. The inadequate job description contributed to problems with appropriate utilization of the PACS technologist. The primary role of the technologist was nebulous, and the priority of tasks was undefined. There was an excessive volume of information and technology to be mastered. The role represented a new paradigm, so no template for the job description was available that encompassed the array of functions to be performed. The result was a \"morph\" of the RT and PACS analyst job descriptions that was contrived and unworkable. The role of the PACS technologist is vital to the operation of the radiology department that uses PACS. There is a well-established need for cross training of RTs in PACS. PACS technology is not taught in RT training programs. There are recurrent communications problems between RT and Information Technology (IT) personnel. The PACS technologist can participate in a number of activities that improve the overall level of proficiency in the imaging operation, such as specialized PACS training for RTs, collection and analysis of quality control data, and planning for installations of PACS acquisition modalities. RTs have acquired knowledge of medical terminology and human anatomy, imaging modalities, and workflow. These qualifications constitute a common basis for communication with other RTs, physicians, and\n\nOverview of PACS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVanden Brink, John A.\n\n1995-08-01\n\nDevelopment of the DICOM standard and incremental developments in workstation, network, compression, archiving, and digital x-ray technology have produced cost effective image communication possibilities for selected medical applications. The emerging markets include modality PACS, mini PACS, and teleradiology. Military and VA programs lead the way in the move to adopt PACS technology. Commercial markets for PACS components and PAC systems are at LR400 million growing to LR500 million in 1996.\n\nTowards a theory of PACS deployment: an integrative PACS maturity framework.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan de Wetering, Rogier; Batenburg, Ronald\n\n2014-06-01\n\nOwing to large financial investments that go along with the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) deployments and inconsistent PACS performance evaluations, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the implications of PACS deployment in hospitals. We claim that there is a gap in the research field, both theoretically and empirically, to explain the success of the PACS deployment and maturity in hospitals. Theoretical principles are relevant to the PACS performance; maturity and alignment are reviewed from a system and complexity perspective. A conceptual model to explain the PACS performance and a set of testable hypotheses are then developed. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM), i.e. causal modeling, is applied to validate the model and hypotheses based on a research sample of 64 hospitals that use PACS, i.e. 70Â % of all hospitals in the Netherlands. Outcomes of the SEM analyses substantiate that the measurements of all constructs are reliable and valid. The PACS alignment-modeled as a higher-order construct of five complementary organizational dimensions and maturity levels-has a significant positive impact on the PACS performance. This result is robust and stable for various sub-samples and segments. This paper presents a conceptual model that explains how alignment in deploying PACS in hospitals is positively related to the perceived performance of PACS. The conceptual model is extended with tools as checklists to systematically identify the improvement areas for hospitals in the PACS domain. The holistic approach towards PACS alignment and maturity provides a framework for clinical practice.\n\nPicture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) implementation, integration & benefits in an integrated health system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMansoori, Bahar; Erhard, Karen K; Sunshine, Jeffrey L\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe availability of the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) has revolutionized the practice of radiology in the past two decades and has shown to eventually increase productivity in radiology and medicine. PACS implementation and integration may bring along numerous unexpected issues, particularly in a large-scale enterprise. To achieve a successful PACS implementation, identifying the critical success and failure factors is essential. This article provides an overview of the process of implementing and integrating PACS in a comprehensive health system comprising an academic core hospital and numerous community hospitals. Important issues are addressed, touching all stages from planning to operation and training. The impact of an enterprise-wide radiology information system and PACS at the academic medical center (four specialty hospitals), in six additional community hospitals, and in all associated outpatient clinics as well as the implications on the productivity and efficiency of the entire enterprise are presented.

On the other hand, there are many medical imaging applications that are not developed as telemedical systems. Some medical imaging applications do not support collaboration and some do not communicate with the PACS and therefore limit their usability in clinical workflows. This paper presents a general architecture based on a three-tier architecture model. The architecture and the components developed within it, transform medical imaging applications into collaborative PACS-based telemedical systems. As a result, current medical imaging applications that are not telemedical, not supporting collaboration, and not communicating with PACS, can be enhanced to support collaboration among a group of physicians, be accessed remotely, and be clinically useful. The main advantage of the proposed architecture is that it does not impose any modification to the current medical imaging applications and does not make any assumptions about the underlying architecture or operating system.\n\nCurrent status of the UCSF second-generation PACS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, H. K.; Arenson, Ronald L.; Wong, Albert W. K.; Bazzill, Todd M.; Lou, Shyhliang A.; Andriole, Katherine P.; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Jianguo; Wong, Stephen T. C.\n\n1996-05-01\n\nThis paper describes the current status of the second generation PACS at UCSF commenced in October 1992. The UCSF PACS is designed in-house as a hospital-integrated PACS based on an open architecture concept using industrial standards including UNIX operating system, C programming language, X-Window user interface, TCP/IP communication protocol, DICOM 3.0 image standard and HL7 health data format. Other manufacturer's PACS components which conform with these standards can be easily integrated into the system. Relevant data from HIS and RIS is automatically incorporated into the PACS using HL7 data format and TCP/IP communication protocol. The UCSF system also takes advantage of state-of-the-art communication, storage, and software technologies in ATM, multiple storage media, automatic programming, multilevel processes for a better cost-performance system. The primary PACS network is the 155 Mbits/sec OC3 ATM with the Ethernet as the back-up. The UCSF PACS also connects Mt. Zion Hospital and San Francisco VA Medical Center in the San Francisco Bay area via an ATM wide area network with a T1 line as the back-up. Currently, five MR and five CT scanners from multiple sites, two computed radiography systems, two film digitizers, one US PACS module, the hospital HIS and the department RIS have been connected to the PACS network. The image data is managed by a mirrored database (Sybase). The PACS controller, with its 1.3 terabyte optical disk library, acquires 2.5 gigabytes digital data daily. Four 2K, five, 1,600-line multiple monitor display workstations are on line in neuroradiology, pediatric radiology and intensive care units for clinical use. In addition, the PACS supports over 100 Macintosh users in the department and selected hospital sites for both images and textual retrieval through a client/server mechanism. We are also developing a computation and visualization node in the PACS network for advancing radiology research.\n\nLarge-scale PACS implementation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarrino, J A; Unkel, P J; Miller, I D; Bowser, C L; Freckleton, M W; Johnson, T G\n\n1998-08-01\n\nThe transition to filmless radiology is a much more formidable task than making the request for proposal to purchase a (Picture Archiving and Communications System) PACS. The Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration have been pioneers in the transformation of medical diagnostic imaging to the electronic environment. Many civilian sites are expected to implement large-scale PACS in the next five to ten years. This presentation will related the empirical insights gleaned at our institution from a large-scale PACS implementation. Our PACS integration was introduced into a fully operational department (not a new hospital) in which work flow had to continue with minimal impact. Impediments to user acceptance will be addressed. The critical components of this enormous task will be discussed. The topics covered during this session will include issues such as phased implementation, DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) standard-based interaction of devices, hospital information system (HIS)/radiology information system (RIS) interface, user approval, networking, workstation deployment and backup procedures. The presentation will make specific suggestions regarding the implementation team, operating instructions, quality control (QC), training and education. The concept of identifying key functional areas is relevant to transitioning the facility to be entirely on line. Special attention must be paid to specific functional areas such as the operating rooms and trauma rooms where the clinical requirements may not match the PACS capabilities. The printing of films may be necessary for certain circumstances. The integration of teleradiology and remote clinics into a PACS is a salient topic with respect to the overall role of the radiologists providing rapid consultation. A Web-based server allows a clinician to review images and reports on a desk-top (personal) computer and thus reduce the number of dedicated PACS review workstations.

We initially hypothesized that only radiologist and examination category would have significant effects on PACS usage. Command logs covering 8Â weeks of PACS usage were analyzed. For each command trace (describing performed activities of an attending radiologist interpreting a single examination), the PACS usage variables number of commands, number of command classes, bigram repetitiveness, and time to read were extracted. Generalized linear models were used to determine the significance of the factors on the PACS usage variables. The statistical results confirmed the initial hypothesis that radiologist and examination category affect PACS usage and that the factors week and time of week to a large extent have no significant effect. As such, this work provides direction for continued efforts to analyze system data to better understand PACS utilization, which in turn can provide input to enable optimal utilization and configuration of corresponding systems. These continued efforts were, in this work, exemplified by a more detailed analysis using PACS usage profiles, which revealed insights directly applicable to improve PACS utilization through modified system configuration.\n\nAutomating PACS quality control with the Vanderbilt image processing enterprise resource\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEsparza, Michael L.; Welch, E. Brian; Landman, Bennett A.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nPrecise image acquisition is an integral part of modern patient care and medical imaging research. Periodic quality control using standardized protocols and phantoms ensures that scanners are operating according to specifications, yet such procedures do not ensure that individual datasets are free from corruption; for example due to patient motion, transient interference, or physiological variability. If unacceptable artifacts are noticed during scanning, a technologist can repeat a procedure. Yet, substantial delays may be incurred if a problematic scan is not noticed until a radiologist reads the scans or an automated algorithm fails. Given scores of slices in typical three-dimensional scans and widevariety of potential use cases, a technologist cannot practically be expected inspect all images. In large-scale research, automated pipeline systems have had great success in achieving high throughput. However, clinical and institutional workflows are largely based on DICOM and PACS technologies; these systems are not readily compatible with research systems due to security and privacy restrictions. Hence, quantitative quality control has been relegated to individual investigators and too often neglected. Herein, we propose a scalable system, the Vanderbilt Image Processing Enterprise Resource (VIPER) to integrate modular quality control and image analysis routines with a standard PACS configuration. This server unifies image processing routines across an institutional level and provides a simple interface so that investigators can collaborate to deploy new analysis technologies. VIPER integrates with high performance computing environments has successfully analyzed all standard scans from our institutional research center over the course of the last 18 months.\n\n[Design of the image browser for PACS image workstation].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Feng; Zhou, He-Qin\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThe design of PACS image workstation based on DICOM3.0 is introduced in the paper, then the designing method of the PACS image browser based on the control system theory is presented,focusing on two main units:DICOM analyzer and the information mapping transformer.\n\nHistory of PACS in Asia.\n\nPubMed\n\nInamura, Kiyonari; Kim, Jong Hyo\n\n2011-05-01\n\nFirst, history of PACS (picture archiving and communication system for medical use) in Japan is described in two parts: in part 1, the early stage of PACS development from 1984 to 2002, and in part 2 the matured stage from 2002 to 2010. PACS in Japan has been developed and installed by local manufacturers by their own technology and demand from domestic hospitals. Part 1 mainly focuses on quantitative growth and part 2 on qualitative change. In part 2, integration of PACS into RIS (radiology information system), HIS (hospital information system), EPR (electronic patient record), teleradiology and IHE (integrating healthcare enterprise) is reported. Interaction with other elements of technology such as moving picture network system and three dimensional display is also discussed. Present situation of main 4 large size hospitals is presented. Second, history of PACS in Korea is reported. Very acute climbing up of filmless PACS diffusion was observed from 1997 to 2000. The reasons for such evolution are described and discussed. Also changes of PACS installation and system integration with other systems such as HIS and role of them in radiological diagnoses in Korea since 2002 are described. Third, history in China is investigated by checking international academic journals in English and described as far as events are logically linked and consistently meaningful.

This PACS is made up of over 50 computers that work cooperatively to provide archival, retrieval and image distribution services for Mayo's Department of Radiology. This paper will examine the performance characteristics of the system.\n\nSiemens experience in PACS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHall, Charles L.; Perry, John H.\n\n1990-08-01\n\nExperience from ten years in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems has led to a clearer understanding of the user, system, and component requirements for PACS, and the evolving market. This paper reports on one manufacturer's considerations and experiences as a PACS supplier.\n\nTreatment of coal gasification wastewater by membrane bioreactor hybrid powdered activated carbon (MBRâPAC) system.\n\nPubMed\n\nJia, Shengyong; Han, Hongjun; Hou, Baolin; Zhuang, Haifeng; Fang, Fang; Zhao, Qian\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor hybrid powdered activated carbon (MBRâPAC) system was developed to treat coal gasification wastewater to enhance the COD, total phenols (TPh), NH4+ removals and migrate the membrane fouling. Since the MBRâPAC system operated with PAC dosage of 4 g Lâ1, the maximum removal efficiencies of COD, TPh and NH4+ reached 93%, 99% and 63%, respectively with the corresponding influent concentrations of 2.27 g Lâ1, 497 mg Lâ1 and 164 mg N Lâ1; the PAC extraction efficiencies of COD, TPh and NH4+ were 6%, 3% and 13%, respectively; the transmembrane pressure decreased 34% with PAC after 50 d operation. The results demonstrate that PAC played a key role in the enhancement of biodegradability and mitigation of membrane fouling.\n\nPacCYP707A2 negatively regulates cherry fruit ripening while PacCYP707A1 mediates drought tolerance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Qian; Chen, Pei; Dai, Shengjie; Sun, Yufei; Yuan, Bing; Kai, Wenbin; Pei, Yuelin; He, Suihuan; Liang, Bin; Zhang, Yushu; Leng, Ping\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSweet cherry is a non-climacteric fruit and its ripening is regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) during fruit development. In this study, four cDNAs (PacCYP707A1â4) encoding 8â²-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the oxidative catabolism of ABA, were identified in sweet cherry fruits using tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and particle bombardment approaches. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed significant down-regulation of target gene transcripts in VIGS-treated cherry fruits. In PacCYP707A2-RNAi-treated fruits, ripening and fruit colouring were promoted relative to control fruits, and both ABA accumulation and PacNCED1 transcript levels were up-regulated by 140%. Silencing of PacCYP707A2 by VIGS significantly altered the transcripts of both ABA-responsive and ripening-related genes, including the ABA metabolism-associated genes NCED and CYP707A, the anthocyanin synthesis genes PacCHS, PacCHI, PacF3H, PacDFR, PacANS, and PacUFGT, the ethylene biosynthesis gene PacACO1, and the transcription factor PacMYBA. The promoter of PacMYBA responded more strongly to PacCYP707A2-RNAi-treated fruits than to PacCYP707A1-RNAi-treated fruits. By contrast, silencing of PacCYP707A1 stimulated a slight increase in fruit colouring and enhanced resistance to dehydration stress compared with control fruits. These results suggest that PacCYP707A2 is a key regulator of ABA catabolism that functions as a negative regulator of fruit ripening, while PacCYP707A1 regulates ABA content in response to dehydration during fruit development.

Every center represents a unique situation and requires a specialized solution. Typically, most of what is said and discussed about PACS concentrates on solutions and requirements for hospital radiology facilities. Administrators of imaging centers have different problems from hospital administrators, and they need different answers. For imaging centers, the financial justification for PACS may be less immediate than for hospitals. The first thing that must be understood is that no PAC system can make a typical imaging center completely filmless, at least not for quite a while. A hospital has the ability to dictate to its internal referring physicians how a radiological study is delivered, whereas in an imaging center environment, the roles are very much reversed. Once the justification are made for the financial viability of PACS in an imaging center, the next question is how to finance the acquisition of PACS. The decision will depend on how you cost justify your PACS, as well as the shape of your business model, and it will come to a decision between capital purchase or contracting with an application service provider, or ASP. Historically, in the hospital-dominated marketplace, PAC systems have been treated as capital acquisitions. However, for most imaging center, owning the system is more of a problem than a benefit. ASPs increasingly represent a successful alternative for imaging centers. One of the biggest things to consider with PACS is how to store all of those images. There are typically two options, on-site and off-site, with a new \"hybrid\" option surfacing more recently. Each option has benefits for the user, but the benefits of off-site storage are increasing as the technology advances. Some of the benefits are data security and access. Other issues to address are HIPAA compliance, standardized\n\nThe Logistics Of Installing Pacs In An Existing Medical Center\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaarinen, Allan O.; Goodsitt, Mitchell M.; Loop, John W.\n\n1989-05-01\n\nA largely overlooked issue in the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) area is the tremendous amount of site planning activity required to install such a system in an existing medical center. Present PACS equipment requires significant hospital real estate, specialized electrical power, cabling, and environmental controls to operate properly. Marshaling the hospital resources necessary to install PACS equipment requires many different players. The site preparation costs are nontrivial and usually include a number of hidden expenses. This paper summarizes the experience of the University of Washington Department of Radiology in installing an extensive digital imaging network (DIN) and PACS throughout the Department and several clinics in the hospital. The major logistical problems encountered at the University are discussed, a few recommendations are made, and the installation costs are documented. Overall, the University's site preparation costs equalled about seven percent (7%) of the total PACS equipment expenditure at the site.\n\nPacCYP707A2 negatively regulates cherry fruit ripening while PacCYP707A1 mediates drought tolerance.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Qian; Chen, Pei; Dai, Shengjie; Sun, Yufei; Yuan, Bing; Kai, Wenbin; Pei, Yuelin; He, Suihuan; Liang, Bin; Zhang, Yushu; Leng, Ping\n\n2015-07-01\n\nSweet cherry is a non-climacteric fruit and its ripening is regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) during fruit development.

This paper presents the criteria important to PACS administrators for selecting a PACS. A set of criteria are identified and organized into an integrative hierarchical framework. Survey responses from 48 administrators are used to identify the relative weights of these criteria through an analytical hierarchy process. The five main dimensions for PACS selection in order of importance are system continuity and functionality, system performance and architecture, user interface for workflow management, user interface for image manipulation, and display quality. Among the subdimensions, the highest weights were assessed for security, backup, and continuity; tools for continuous performance monitoring; support for multispecialty images; and voice recognition/transcription. PACS administrators' preferences were generally in line with that of previously reported results for radiologists. Both groups assigned the highest priority to ensuring business continuity and preventing loss of data through features such as security, backup, downtime prevention, and tools for continuous PACS performance monitoring. PACS administrators' next high priorities were support for multispecialty images, image retrieval speeds from short-term and long-term storage, real-time monitoring, and architectural issues of compatibility and integration with other products. Thus, next to ensuring business continuity, administrators' focus was on issues that impact their ability to deliver services and support. On the other hand, radiologists gave high priorities to voice recognition, transcription, and reporting; structured reporting; and convenience and responsiveness in manipulation of images. Thus, radiologists' focus appears to be on issues that may impact their productivity, effort, and accuracy.\n\nSurgical PACS for the digital operating room. Systems engineering and specification of user requirements.\n\nPubMed\n\nKorb, Werner; Bohn, Stefan; Burgert, Oliver; Dietz, Andreas; Jacobs, Stephan; Falk, Volkmar; Meixensberger, JÃ¼rgen; Strauss, Gero; Trantakis, Christos; Lemke, Heinz U\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFor better integration of surgical assist systems into the operating room, a common communication and processing plattform that is based on the users needs is needed. The development of such a system, a Surgical Picture Aquisition and Communication System (S-PACS), according the systems engineering cycle is oulined in this paper. The first two steps (concept and specification) for the engineering of the S-PACS are discussed.A method for the systematic integration of the users needs', the Quality Function Deployment (QFD), is presented. The properties of QFD for the underlying problem and first results are discussed. Finally, this leads to a first definition of an S-PACS system.\n\nFrom PACS to Web-based ePR system with image distribution for enterprise-level filmless healthcare delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, H K\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe concept of PACS (picture archiving and communication system) was initiated in 1982 during the SPIE medical imaging conference in New Port Beach, CA. Since then PACS has been matured to become an everyday clinical tool for image archiving, communication, display, and review. This paper follows the continuous development of PACS technology including Web-based PACS, PACS and ePR (electronic patient record), enterprise PACS to ePR with image distribution (ID). The concept of large-scale Web-based enterprise PACS and ePR with image distribution is presented along with its implementation, clinical deployment, and operation. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority's (HKHA) integration of its home-grown clinical management system (CMS) with PACS and ePR with image distribution is used as a case study. The current concept and design criteria of the HKHA enterprise integration of the CMS, PACS, and ePR-ID for filmless healthcare delivery are discussed, followed by its work-in-progress and current status.\n\nDeterminant Factors in Applying Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) in Healthcare.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdekhoda, Mohammadhiwa; Salih, Kawa Mirza\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMeaningful use of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) can change the workflow for accessing digital images, lead to faster turnaround time, reduce tests and examinations, and increase patient throughput. This study was carried out to identify determinant factors that affect the adoption of PACS by physicians. This was a cross-sectional study in which 190 physicians working in a teaching hospital affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences were randomly selected. Physicians' perceptions concerning the adoption of PACS were assessed by the conceptual path model of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Collected data were analyzed with regression analysis. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the final model that was developed. The results show that the UTAUT model can explain about 61 percent of the variance on in the adoption of PACS ( R 2 = 0.61). The findings also showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, and behavior intention have a direct and significant effect on the adoption of PACS. However, facility condition showed to have no significant effect on physicians' behavior intentions. Implementation of new technology such as PACS in the healthcare sector is unavoidable. Our study clearly identified significant and nonsignificant factors that may affect the adoption of PACS. Also, this study acknowledged that physicians' perception is a key factor to manage the implementation of PACS optimally, and this fact should be considered by healthcare managers and policy makers.\n\nDeterminant Factors in Applying Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) in Healthcare\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdekhoda, Mohammadhiwa; Salih, Kawa Mirza\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives Meaningful use of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) can change the workflow for accessing digital images, lead to faster turnaround time, reduce tests and examinations, and increase patient throughput.

The system was developed to replace the imaging system's vendor-supplied magnetic tape archiving capability. The system consists of seven MR imagers and nine CT scanners, each interfaced to the PACS via IBM Personal System/2(tm) (PS/2) computers, which act as gateways from the imaging modality to the PACS network. The PAC system operates on the token-ring component of Mayo's city-wide local area network. Also on the PACS network are four optical storage subsystems used for image archival, three optical subsystems used for image retrieval, an IBM Application System/400(tm) (AS/400) computer used for database management and multiple PS/2-based image display systems and their image servers.\n\nProtecting clinical data in PACS, teleradiology systems, and research environments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeissner, Marion C.; Collmann, Jeff R.; Tohme, Walid G.; Mun, Seong K.\n\n1997-05-01\n\nAs clinical data is more widely stored in electronic patient record management systems and transmitted over the Internet and telephone lines, it becomes more accessible and therefore more useful, but also more vulnerable. Computer systems such as PACS, telemedicine applications, and medical research networks must protect against accidental or deliberate modification, disclosure, and violation of patient confidentiality in order to be viable. Conventional wisdom in the medical field and among lawmakers legislating the use of electronic medical records suggests that, although it may improve access to information, an electronic medical record cannot be as secure as a traditional paper record. This is not the case. Information security is a well-developed field in the computer and communications industry. If medical information systems, such as PACS, telemedicine applications, and research networks, properly apply information security techniques, they can ensure the accuracy and confidentiality of their patient information and even improve the security of their data over a traditional paper record. This paper will elaborate on some of these techniques and discuss how they can be applied to medical information systems. The following systems will be used as examples for the analysis: a research laboratory at Georgetown University Medical Center, the Deployable Radiology system installed to support the US Army's peace- keeping operation in Bosnia, a kidney dialysis telemedicine system in Washington, D.C., and various experiences with implementing and integrating PACS.\n\nDistributed PACS using distributed file system with hierarchical meta data servers.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiroyasu, Tomoyuki; Minamitani, Yoshiyuki; Miki, Mitsunori; Yokouchi, Hisatake; Yoshimi, Masato\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn this research, we propose a new distributed PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) which is available to integrate several PACSs that exist in each medical institution. The conventional PACS controls DICOM file into one data-base. On the other hand, in the proposed system, DICOM file is separated into meta data and image data and those are stored individually. Using this mechanism, since file is not always accessed the entire data, some operations such as finding files, changing titles, and so on can be performed in high-speed. At the same time, as distributed file system is utilized, accessing image files can also achieve high-speed access and high fault tolerant. The introduced system has a more significant point. That is the simplicity to integrate several PACSs. In the proposed system, only the meta data servers are integrated and integrated system can be constructed. This system also has the scalability of file access with along to the number of file numbers and file sizes. On the other hand, because meta-data server is integrated, the meta data server is the weakness of this system. To solve this defect, hieratical meta data servers are introduced. Because of this mechanism, not only fault--tolerant ability is increased but scalability of file access is also increased. To discuss the proposed system, the prototype system using Gfarm was implemented. For evaluating the implemented system, file search operating time of Gfarm and NFS were compared.\n\nHIS-PACS coupling in perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLodder, Herman; van Poppel, Bas M.; Wilmink, J. B.; Bakker, Albert R.\n\n1990-08-01\n\nWithin the framework of the Dutch PACS project (a cooperation in the PACS field of BAZIS, the Utrecht University Hospital and Philips Medical Systems) a coupling between a HIS and a prototype PACS was realized and evaluated during clinical practice. This one-way coupling is a first step towards a so-called Image Information System, which can be seen as (logically) one system instead of two (a HIS for storage and retrieval of administrative and medical data, and a PACS for the images). The BAZIS/HIS is an integrated HIS, containing about 70 subsystems including a RIS, which is now used in about 40 hospitals in the Netherlands. The main reasons for coupling/integrating a HIS and a PACS can be summerized as: a) the user need for both functional and information integration and b) the need to have access to HIS data for optimizing image database and network management in order to get acceptable response times. As follow-up to the paper presented in the 1989 conference this paper will focus on the experiences gained with this one-way coupling. The event-driven communication took place by sending messages from HIS to PACS in ACRNEMA format. From these experiences recommendations for a next phase: a two-way link between a HIS and a PACS will be given. The necessity for bidirectional datatransfer will be discussed. Directions for future research e.g. on prefetching strategies will be pointed out.\n\nDevelopment and implementation of a PACS network and resource manager\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStewart, Brent K.; Taira, Ricky K.; Dwyer, Samuel J., III; Huang, H. K.\n\n1992-07-01\n\nClinical acceptance of PACS is predicated upon maximum uptime. Upon component failure, detection, diagnosis, reconfiguration and repair must occur immediately. Our current PACS network is large, heterogeneous, complex and wide-spread geographically. The overwhelming number of network devices, computers and software processes involved in a departmental or inter-institutional PACS makes development of tools for network and resource management critical. The authors have developed and implemented a comprehensive solution (PACS Network-Resource Manager) using the OSI Network Management Framework with network element agents that respond to queries and commands for network management stations. Managed resources include: communication protocol layers for Ethernet, FDDI and UltraNet; network devices; computer and operating system resources; and application, database and network services. The Network-Resource Manager is currently being used for warning, fault, security violation and configuration modification event notification. Analysis, automation and control applications have been added so that PACS resources can be dynamically reconfigured and so that users are notified when active involvement is required. Custom data and error logging have been implemented that allow statistics for each PACS subsystem to be charted for performance data. The Network-Resource Manager allows our departmental PACS system to be monitored continuously and thoroughly, with a minimal amount of personal involvement and time.\n\nEffect of PAC dosage in a pilot-scale PAC-MBR treating micro-polluted surface water.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Jingyi; Shang, Ran; Deng, Huiping; Heijman, Sebastiaan G J; Rietveld, Luuk C\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTo address the water scarcity issue and advance the traditional drinking water treatment technique, a powdered activated carbon-amended membrane bioreactor (PAC-MBR) is proposed for micro-polluted surface water treatment. A pilot-scale study was carried out by initially dosing different amounts of PAC into the MBR. Comparative results showed that 2g/L performed the best among 0, 1, 2 and 3g/L PAC-MBR regarding organic matter and ammonia removal as well as membrane flux sustainability. 1g/L PAC-MBR exhibited a marginal improvement in pollutant removal compared to the non-PAC system. The accumulation of organic matter in the bulk mixture of 3g/L PAC-MBR led to poorer organic removal and severer membrane fouling. Molecular weight distribution of the bulk liquid in 2g/L PAC-MBR revealed the synergistic effects of PAC adsorption/biodegradation and membrane rejection on organic matter removal. Additionally, a lower amount of soluble extracellular polymer substances in the bulk can be secured in 21 days operation. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

INTRODUCTION TO DEPARTMENTAL PACS. Full or partial Departmental PACS is generally taken to mean an image management system focused on serving the needs of a specific modality or modality application. It will provide a modality specific means of image acquisition, specialized redisplay of images, distribution, and local long term storage of images. A Departmental PACS can be considered in isolation or as a component in a distributed Radiology PACS which consists of one or more departmental work groups on a back bone, potentially with shared resources. 2. DEPARTMENTAL PACS Issues Implementation of a Departmental PACS requires an in-depth knowledge of departmental clinical practice and work flow in all affected areas in the department, including patient intake, image collection, data routing, retrieval of previous image data, reporting, and long term data management and storage. Optimization of modality specific image display systems requires significant involvement from representative physician users. System architectures and user interfaces must be flexible enough to support the span of variation in clinical practice encountered in the site. A departmental PACS should offer a variety of \"open\" communications interfaces, both local and wide area, recognizing that outreach efforts are often driven by specific imaging departments. Interfaces to other departmental PAC systems and other information systems must be considered in order to facilitate institutions developing \"Best of Breed\" PACS systems. As hospitals move toward the integrated electronic medical record, means need to exist for a client process launched from a physician desktop to acquire images and/or reports from a departmental system. At minimum, HIS/RIS interfaces need to be considered to minimize re-keying of data and reduce data entry errors. 3. DESIGN OBJECTIVES FOR ALI ULTRAPACS.

In order to reach these brilliant achievements, the efforts of the Korean Society of PACS, the supports of the government on the information technology industry and the efforts of PACS companies in market expansion were all served as vital manures of the sowing time. By the end of 2001, 21% of the total Korean hospitals were under the clinical operation using filmless full PACS and it is believed to be the first incident in the world. The purpose of this paper is to look back upon the growing process of filmless PACS in Korea and analyze the cause of this tremendous growth. I believe that the Korean PACS experience would be helpful to many PACS experts who pray for a proliferation of PACS distribution.\n\nEnterprise PACS and image distribution.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, H K\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAround the world now, because of the need to improve operation efficiency and better cost effective healthcare, many large-scale healthcare enterprises have been formed. Each of these enterprises groups hospitals, medical centers, and clinics together as one enterprise healthcare network. The management of these enterprises recognizes the importance of using PACS and image distribution as a key technology in cost-effective healthcare delivery in the enterprise level. As a result, many large-scale enterprise level PACS/image distribution pilot studies, full design and implementation, are underway. The purpose of this paper is to provide readers an overall view of the current status of enterprise PACS and image distribution. reviews three large-scale enterprise PACS/image distribution systems in USA, Germany, and South Korean. The concept of enterprise level PACS/image distribution, its characteristics and ingredients are then discussed. Business models for enterprise level implementation available by the private medical imaging and system integration industry are highlighted. One current system under development in designing a healthcare enterprise level chest tuberculosis (TB) screening in Hong Kong is described in detail.

One-hundred and sixty clients in different types of psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioural, cognitive-behavioural-enhanced, psychodynamic, relational, supportive) and from three different countries were administered the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) prior to treatment, and one session for each client was rated with the PACS by independent coders. Results indicate strong inter-rater reliability, and high convergent validity of the PACS scales and classifications with the AAI. These results present the PACS as a practical alternative to the AAI in psychotherapy research and suggest that clinicians using the PACS can assess clients' attachment status on an ongoing basis by monitoring clients' verbal activity. These results also provide information regarding the ways in which differences in attachment status play out in therapy sessions and further the study of attachment in psychotherapy from a pre-treatment client factor to a process variable. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The Patient Attachment Coding System is a valid measure of attachment that can classify clients' attachment based on any single psychotherapy transcript, in many therapeutic modalities Client differences in attachment manifest in part independently of the therapist's contributions Client adult attachment patterns are likely to affect psychotherapeutic processes.

A major concern in the migration of medical data is to match the image data from the mini-PACS with the hospital OCS (Ordered Communication System). Prior to carrying out the actual migration process, the principles, methods, and anticipated results for the migration with respect to both cost and effectiveness were evaluated. Migration gateway workstations were established and a migration software tool was developed. The actual migration process was performed based on the results of several migration simulations. Our conclusions were that a migration plan should be carefully prepared and tailored to the individual hospital environment because the server system, archive media, network, OCS, and policy for data management may be unique.\n\nPACS development in Asia.\n\nPubMed\n\nInamura, Kiyonari; Kousaka, Susumu; Yamamoto, Yuichiro; Sukenobu, Yoshiharu; Okura, Yasuhiko; Matsumura, Yasushi; Takeda, Hiroshi\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFirst, history of PACS in Japan from 1982 to 2002 has been investigated. By 2002 total of 1468 PACS units have been installed. Of these, 1174 are small-size PACS with less than four image display terminals, 203 are medium-size with 5-14 terminals, and 91 are large-size with 15 up to 1300 terminals. The main nine large-size PACS of 91 have been retrospectively investigated from 1984 for PACS experiments and from 1989 for PACS operation. Most of these nine hospitals have increased the number of PACS terminals by installing additional PACS units, instead of reinforcing the existing single PACS. The use of DICOM interfaces has increased the number of modalities connected to PACS and influenced the spreading of PACS installations in Japan. The status of HIS and RIS coupling to PACS, and the use of PACS in primary diagnosis or in image referral are discussed. Assessment of PACS is now in an early stage. Baseline studies of HIS/RIS/PACS effectiveness have been carried out to assess quantitatively the PACS merit. Second, history of PACS development in Korea is described. Very acute climbing up of filmless PACS diffusion was observed from 2000 to 2002. The reasons seem to be lack of domestic X-ray film industry, economic crisis in 1997 and PACS Reimbursement Act in health insurance in Korea. Third, the Hong Kong Wide Area Image Distribution/PACS Project is reported. It is now under phase 1 of design and partial implementation employing the latest and the highest ends of advanced technology such as failure resilience.

Many of the prerequisites that will have to be met by future PACS are of minor interest in these pilot projects; e.g. minimization of costs, compatibility between different manufacturers' equipment, feasibility of systems engineering and customizing of a standard product, serviceability of different manufacturers' subsystems, stepwise introduction of the system into the daily routine and failsafety of the system. The paper shows a structured PACS architecture as a prerequisite to make PACS a high quality system from the user's point of view.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY VERIFICATION REPORT, C.

An important part of the EHR is the medical images obtained over a patient's lifetime and stored in diverse PACS. The vision presented in this paper is that future medical information systems will convert data from various medical sources -- including diverse modalities, PACS, HIS, CIS, RIS, and proprietary systems -- to HL7 standard XML documents. Then, the various documents are indexed and compiled to EHRs, upon which complex queries can be posed. We describe the conversion of data retrieved from PACS systems through DICOM to HL7 standard XML documents. This enables the EHR system to answer queries such as 'Get all chest images of patients at the age of 20-30, that have blood type 'A' and are allergic to pine trees', which a single PACS cannot answer. The integration of data from multiple sources makes our approach capable of delivering such answers. It enables the correlation of medical, demographic, clinical, and even genetic information. In addition, by fully indexing all the tagged data in DICOM objects, it becomes possible to offer access to huge amounts of valuable data, which can be better exploited in the specific radiology domain.\n\nClinical experience with PACS at Northwestern: year two\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChannin, David S.; Hawkins, Rodney C.; Enzmann, Dieter R.\n\n2001-08-01\n\nWe have previously described the PACS configuration at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH). As opposed to an imaging modality, PACS is an evolving system that continuously grows and changes to meet the needs of the institution. The NMH PACS has grown significantly in the past year and has undergone significant architectural enhancements. This growth and evolutionary change will be described and discussed. The system now contains over 339,000 studies consisting of over 13 million images. There are now two short-term RAID storage units that provide for twice as much fast storage. There are also two magneto-optical disk jukeboxes providing long-term archive. We have deployed a redundant database to improve reliability of the system in the event of database failure. The number of modalities connected to the system has increased and will be summarized. Statistics describing utilization of the PACS will be shown. Lastly, we will discuss our plans for exploiting the application service provider model in our PACS environment.\n\nIHE profiles applied to regional PACS.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernandez-BayÃ³, Josep\n\n2011-05-01\n\nPACS has been widely adopted as an image storage solution that perfectly fits the radiology department workflow and that can be easily extended to other hospital departments. Integrations with other hospital systems, like the Radiology Information System, the Hospital Information System and the Electronic Patient Record are fully achieved but still challenging aims. PACS also creates the perfect environment for teleradiology and teleworking setups. One step further is the regional PACS concept where different hospitals or health care enterprises share the images in an integrated Electronic Patient Record. Among the different solutions available to share images between different hospitals IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) organization presents the Cross Enterprise Document Sharing profile (XDS) which allows sharing images from different hospitals even if they have different PACS vendors. Adopting XDS has multiple advantages, images do not need to be duplicated in a central archive to be shared among the different healthcare enterprises, they only need to be indexed and published in a central document registry. In the XDS profile IHE defines the mechanisms to publish and index the images in the central document registry. It also defines the mechanisms that each hospital will use to retrieve those images regardless on the Hospital PACS they are stored. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We can justify the cost of PACS by considering the visible and invisible benefits. As a visible benefit we can save the cost of films and equipments for film processing. Invisible benefits of PACS is the cost of film handling. Generally, doctors spend some 25 minutes in handling X-ray films everyday and they spend 10 days (84 hours) throughout a year. Radiology technicians, nurses, orderlies and clerks also handle films and the total salary for handling films by doctors and paramedics will be considerable. Considering the visible and invisible benefits, cost of PACS is justified and PACS can be installed in every hospital, whatever their size. The Korean Society of PACS tried to make reimbursement of the cost of PACS and persuaded the government officers and eventually the Ministry of Health and Welfare decided to reimburse the use of PACS in hospitals. Based on the money reimbursed, general hospitals or university hospitals will earn enough money to purchase a PACS in 3 - 5 years. After the Korean government started to reimburse the cost of PACS, many hospitals wanted to install PACS and the number of hospitals installing PACS is soaring.\n\nContinuing quality improvement procedures for a clinical PACS.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndriole, K P; Gould, R G; Avrin, D E; Bazzill, T M; Yin, L; Arenson, R L\n\n1998-08-01\n\nThe University of California at San Francisco (USCF) Department of Radiology currently has a clinically operational picture archiving and communication system (PACS) that is thirty-five percent filmless, with the goal of becoming seventy-five percent filmless within the year. The design and implementation of the clinical PACS has been a collaborative effort between an academic research laboratory and a commercial vendor partner. Images are digitally acquired from three computed radiography (CR) scanners, five computed tomography (CT) scanners, five magnetic resonance (MR) imagers, three digital fluoroscopic rooms, an ultrasound mini-PACS and a nuclear medicine mini-PACS. The DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard communications protocol and image format is adhered to throughout the PACS. Images are archived in hierarchical staged fashion, on a RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) and on magneto-optical disk jukeboxes. The clinical PACS uses an object-oriented Oracle SQL (systems query language) database, and interfaces to the Radiology Information System using the HL7 (Health Languages 7) standard. Components are networked using a combination of switched and fast ethernet, and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode), all over fiber optics. The wide area network links six UCSF sites in San Francisco. A combination of high and medium resolution dual-monitor display stations have been placed throughout the Department of Radiology, the Emergency Department (ED) and Intensive Care Units (ICU). A continuing quality improvement (CQI) committee has been formed to facilitate the PACS installation and training, workflow modifications, quality assurance and clinical acceptance. This committee includes radiologists at all levels (resident, fellow, attending), radiology technologists, film library personnel, ED and ICU clinician end-users, and PACS team members. The CQI committee has proved vital in the creation of new management procedures, providing a\n\nPACS strategy for imaging centers.\n\nPubMed\n\nBedel, Victoria; Zdanowicz, Mark\n\n2004-01-01\n\nPicture archiving and communications systems (PACS) have been available in imaging centers for many years, but they often were less functional, were not well integrated into patient information systems, and lacked the network backbone to implement a system. As modalities are replaced and technology improves, the ability and time for an imaging center to acquire, integrate, and utilize PACS has arrived. However, each imaging center must determine why it should invest in PACS. A business plan is the fundamental need. Each imaging center must understand its target market, growth rate, and staffing plans. Additional considerations lie in current and future modality availability, the need for offsite delivery of images and reports, and the potential need for remote transmission of images. These issues must be identified and prioritized. A multidisciplinary team is essential. The most successful PACS implementation begins with complete involvement from all levels. The team should be comprised of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, set of performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable. The team must jointly decide on the project's objectives. These objectives fall under 4 categories: clinical, service, financial, and performance. PACS must be considered a tool to help accomplish each objective. The imaging center must determine its top priorities, then translate them into a technology \"wish list.\" The center can then list those pieces of technology that are most important and prioritize them. There are even more considerations for connecting multiple imaging centers. The team must create a comprehensive request for proposal (RFP) and determine the vendors that will receive the document. Once the RFP responses have been received and the vendor has been selected, an effective training plan must be executed. Training plans should be competency-based, ensuring comfort and competency among all staff. Upon\n\nPACS photometer calibration block analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoÃ³r, A.; MÃ¼ller, T. G.; Kiss, C.; Balog, Z.; Billot, N.; Marton, G.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe absolute stability of the PACS bolometer response over the entire mission lifetime without applying any corrections is about 0.5 % (standard deviation) or about 8 % peak-to-peak. This fantastic stability allows us to calibrate all scientific measurements by a fixed and time-independent response file, without using any information from the PACS internal calibration sources. However, the analysis of calibration block observations revealed clear correlations of the internal source signals with the evaporator temperature and a signal drift during the first half hour after the cooler recycling. These effects are small, but can be seen in repeated measurements of standard stars. From our analysis we established corrections for both effects which push the stability of the PACS bolometer response to about 0.2 % (stdev) or 2 % in the blue, 3 % in the green and 5 % in the red channel (peak-to-peak). After both corrections we still see a correlation of the signals with PACS FPU temperatures, possibly caused by parasitic heat influences via the Kevlar wires which connect the bolometers with the PACS Focal Plane Unit. No aging effect or degradation of the photometric system during the mission lifetime has been found.\n\nThe HERSCHEL/PACS early Data Products\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWieprecht, E.; Wetzstein, M.; Huygen, R.; Vandenbussche, B.; De Meester, W.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nESA's Herschel Space Observatory to be launched in 2007, is the first space observatory covering the full far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength range (60 - 670 microns). The Photodetector Array Camera & Spectrometer (PACS) is one of the three science instruments. It contains two Ge:Ga photoconductor arrays and two bolometer arrays to perform imaging line spectroscopy and imaging photometry in the 60 - 210 micron wavelength band. The HERSCHEL ground segment (Herschel Common Science System - HCSS) is implemented using JAVA technology and written in a common effort by the HERSCHEL Science Center and the three instrument teams. The PACS Common Software System (PCSS) is based on the HCSS and used for the online and offline analysis of PACS data. For telemetry bandwidth reasons PACS science data are partially processed on board, compressed, cut into telemetry packets and transmitted to the ground. These steps are instrument mode dependent. We will present the software model which allows to reverse the discrete on board processing steps and evaluate the data. After decompression and reconstruction the detector data and instrument status information are organized in two main PACS Products. The design of these JAVA classes considers the individual sampling rates, data formats, memory and performance optimization aspects and comfortable user interfaces.\n\nWhat Is A Picture Archiving And Communication System (PACS)?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarceau, Carla\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA PACS is a digital system for acquiring, storing, moving and displaying picture or image information. It is an alternative to film jackets that has been made possible by recent breakthroughs in computer technology: telecommunications, local area nets and optical disks. The fundamental concept of the digital representation of image information is introduced. It is shown that freeing images from a material representation on film or paper leads to a dramatic increase in flexibility in our use of the images. The ultimate goal of a medical PACS system is a radiology department without film jackets. The inherent nature of digital images and the power of the computer allow instant free \"copies\" of images to be made and thrown away. These copies can be transmitted to distant sites in seconds, without the \"original\" ever leaving the archives of the radiology department. The result is a radiology department with much freer access to patient images and greater protection against lost or misplaced image information. Finally, images in digital form can be treated as data for the computer in image processing, which includes enhancement, reconstruction and even computer-aided analysis.\n\nTracking PACS usage with open source tools.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrench, Todd L; Langer, Steve G\n\n2011-08-01\n\nA typical choice faced by Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) administrators is deciding how many PACS workstations are needed and where they should be sited. Oftentimes, the social consequences of having too few are severe enough to encourage oversupply and underutilization. This is costly, at best in terms of hardware and electricity, and at worst (depending on the PACS licensing and support model) in capital costs and maintenance fees. The PACS administrator needs tools to asses accurately the use to which her fleet is being subjected, and thus make informed choices before buying more workstations. Lacking a vended solution for this challenge, we developed our own.\n\nDesign and Implementation of PACS at Georgetown University Hospital\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMun, S. K.; Benson, H.. R.; Choyke, P.; Fahey, F. H.; Wang, P. C.; Zeman, R. K...; Elliott, L. P.\n\n1985-09-01\n\nDuring the preparation and planning phase of the PACS project at Georgetown University Hospital it was realized that PACS requires truly the state of the art technology in data communication, image processing and man machine interfacing. It was also realized that un-like many other technology intensive devices used in radiology, PACS cannot be seen as an independent system that will provide well defined services. PACS will be the backbone of the department operation in clinical, educational and managerial functions. It will indeed be the nerve center of the radiologic services affecting every aspect of the department. PACS will have to be designed to perform in a cost-effective manner to widely varying needs within the radiology departments. The integration of ever changing complex technology that will impact every aspect of a radiology service is not a trivial matter. This transition period going from current manual film based PACS to Digital PACS can be long, expansive and disruptive unless careful planning preceeds the implementation. PACS is still an emerging technology at its infancy. Performance monitoring and evaluation of diversified functions have to be also established so that improvement to the system can be efficiently implemented. Thus the evaluation criteria should be also established as early as possible.\n\nPlanning, expectation, and image evaluation for PACS at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFranken, E. A., Jr.; Smith, Wilbur L.; Berbaum, Kevin S.; Owen, David A.; Hilsenrath, Peter\n\n1990-08-01\n\nOur strategy in studying PACS is to evaluate its clinical implementation working with equipment supplied by an established manufacturer. Fiscal and personnel resources required to design and integrate the hardware components and operational software to develop a functional PACS precluded a bottom up development approach at our institution. Imaging equipment vendors possess more abundant design development resources for this task and therefore can support a more rapid development of the initial components of PACS. For this reason we have chosen to serve as a beta test site to study the viability of the basic PACS components in a clinical setting. Our efforts primarily focus on: (1) image quality; (2) cost effectiveness; (3) PACS/HIS/RIS integration; (4) equipment and software reliability; and (5) overall system performance. The results of our studies are shared with the vendor for future PACS development and refi nement. To attain our investigational goals we have formed an interdisciplinary team of Radiologists, Perceptual Psychologist, Economist, Electrical and Industrial Engineers, Hospital Information System personnel and key departmental administrative staff. For several reasons Pediatric Radiology was targeted as the initial area for our PACS study: a small area representative of the overall operation,tight operational controls and willingness of physicians. We used a step-wise approach, the first step being the installation of PACS exclusively within the physical confines of Pediatric Radiology.\n\nInterpretation of digital breast tomosynthesis: preliminary study on comparison with picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and dedicated workstation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Young Seon; Chang, Jung Min; Yi, Ann; Shin, Sung Ui; Lee, Myung Eun; Kim, Won Hwa; Cho, Nariya; Moon, Woo Kyung\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo compare the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the interpretation of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and a dedicated workstation. 97 DBT images obtained for screening or diagnostic purposes were stored in both a workstation and a PACS and evaluated in combination with digital mammography by three independent radiologists retrospectively. Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System final assessments and likelihood of malignancy (%) were assigned and the interpretation time when using the workstation and PACS was recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, sensitivities and speciï¬cities were compared with histopathological examination and follow-up data as a reference standard. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for cancer detection (0.839 vs 0.815, p = 0.6375) and sensitivity (81.8% vs 75.8%, p = 0.2188) showed no statistically significant differences between the workstation and PACS. However, specificity was significantly higher when analysing on the workstation than when using PACS (83.7% vs 76.9%, p = 0.009). When evaluating DBT images using PACS, only one case was deemed necessary to be reanalysed using the workstation. The mean time to interpret DBT images on PACS (1.68 min/case) was significantly longer than that to interpret on the workstation (1.35 min/case) (p < 0.0001). Interpretation of DBT images using PACS showed comparable diagnostic performance to a dedicated workstation, even though it required a longer reading time. Advances in knowledge: Interpretation of DBT images using PACS is an alternative to evaluate the images when a dedicated workstation is not available.\n\nUser acceptance of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) in a Saudi Arabian hospital radiology department\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Compared with the increasingly widespread use of picture archiving and communication systems (PACSs), knowledge concerning usersâ acceptance of such systems is limited. Knowledge of acceptance is needed given the large (and growing) financial investment associated with the implementation of PACSs, and because the level of user acceptance influences the degree to which the benefits of the systems for healthcare can be realized. Methods A Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to assess the level of acceptance of the host PACS by staff in the radiology department at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire survey of 89 PACS users was employed to obtain data regarding user characteristics, perceived usefulness (PU) (6 items), perceived ease of use (PEU) (4 items), a change construct (4 items), and a behavior (acceptance) construct (9 items). Respondents graded each item in each construct using five-point likert scales. Results Surveyed users reported high levels of PU (4.33/5), PEU (4.15/5), change (4.26/5), and acceptance (3.86/5). The three constructs of PU, PEU, and change explained 41â% of the variation in PACS user acceptance. PU was the most important predictor, explaining 38â% of the variation on its own.
