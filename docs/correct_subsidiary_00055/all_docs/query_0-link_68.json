Management's Discussion and Analysis of\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nPART I\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGenzyme is a biotechnology and health care products company engaged in the\n\ndevelopment of innovative products and services for major unmet medical needs.\n\nThe Genzyme General Division (\"Genzyme General\") develops and markets specialty\n\ntherapeutic, surgical and diagnostic products, pharmaceuticals and genetic\n\ndiagnostic services. The Company's activities to develop, manufacture and market\n\nbiological products for the treatment of cartilage damage, severe burns, chronic\n\nskin ulcers and neurodegenerative diseases are conducted through the Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair Division (\"Genzyme Tissue Repair\").\n\nGenzyme currently has two classes of common stock outstanding: General\n\nDivision Common Stock (\"GGD Stock\") and Tissue Repair Division Common Stock\n\n(\"GTR Stock\"). The GGD Stock and the GTR Stock are intended to reflect the value\n\nand track the performance of Genzyme General and Genzyme Tissue Repair,\n\nrespectively. In January 1997, Genzyme signed a merger agreement providing for\n\nthe merger of PharmaGenics, Inc. (\"PharmaGenics\"), a company engaged in the\n\nresearch and development of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer, into\n\nGenzyme in exchange for shares of a new Genzyme security to be designated\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology Division Common Stock (\"GMO Stock\"). The GMO Stock is\n\nintended to reflect the value and track the performance of Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology, a new division proposed by Genzyme to develop and market novel\n\nproducts and services for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. See Item 7.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\n\nOperations--Subsequent Events.\n\nFor purposes of financial statement presentation, all of the Company's\n\nprograms, products, assets and liabilities are allocated to either Genzyme\n\nGeneral or Genzyme Tissue Repair. Notwithstanding this allocation, Genzyme\n\ncontinues to hold title to all of the assets and is responsible for all of the\n\nliabilities allocated to each of the divisions. Holders of GGD Stock and GTR\n\nStock have no specific claim against the assets attributed to the division whose\n\nperformance is associated with the class of stock they hold. Liabilities or\n\ncontingencies of either division that affect Genzyme's resources or financial\n\ncondition could affect the financial condition or results of operations of both\n\ndivisions.\n\nCeredase(R), Cerezyme(R), InSight(R), Pleur-evac(R), Tevdek(R),\n\nThora-Klex(R), Thyrogen(R) and Vianain(R) are registered trademarks of the\n\nCompany.

Pulmozyme(R) is a\n\nregistered trademark of Genentech, Inc.\n\nGENZYME GENERAL\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nGenzyme General's Specialty Therapeutics business unit markets Ceredase(R)\n\nenzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme, products for the treatment of Gaucher disease.\n\nThe Company's results of operations are highly dependent on sales of these\n\nproducts which, for 1996, totaled $264.6 million. Other specialty therapeutic\n\nproducts under development include Thyrogen(R) hormone for use in the diagnosis\n\nand treatment of thyroid cancer and gene therapy products for the treatment of\n\ncystic fibrosis (\"CF\"), cancer, Gaucher disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGenzyme General's Surgical Products business unit was formed in July 1996\n\nby combining the business of Deknatel Snowden Pencer, Inc. (\"DSP\"), a\n\nprivately-held company acquired in July by Genzyme that specializes in the\n\ndevelopment, manufacture and marketing of cardiovascular devices, precision\n\nsurgical instruments and specialty surgical products, with Genzyme General's\n\nline of biomaterial products based on hyaluronic acid (\"HA\") for use in limiting\n\nthe formation of post-operative adhesions (the \"Sepra Products\").\n\nGenzyme General's Diagnostic Services business unit (\"Genzyme Genetics\")\n\napplies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high quality,\n\nsophisticated genetic diagnostic services to health care providers throughout\n\nthe U.S. and internationally.\n\nGenzyme General's Diagnostic Products business unit (\"Genzyme Diagnostics\")\n\nis a primary supplier of diagnostic components (enzymes, substrates, antibodies\n\nand antigens), bulk reagents and devices (including infectious disease kits, the\n\nDirect LDL(TM) and N-geneous(TM) HDL cholesterol test kits and rapid tests for\n\ndetection of pregnancy, Strep A and mononucleosis) to manufacturers of clinical\n\ndiagnostic reagents and kits as well as directly to clinical reference\n\nlaboratories. Genzyme Diagnostics also manufacturers and sells a broad line of\n\nantibody and antigen based ELISA test kits. In addition, Genzyme Diagnostics\n\ndistributes a broad line of cytokine and apoptosis research products to\n\nacademic, industrial and governmental laboratories.\n\nGenzyme General's Pharmaceuticals business unit (\"Genzyme Pharmaceuticals\")\n\ndevelops, manufactures and sells a range of active drug substances,\n\npharmaceutical intermediates, synthetic phospholipids, peptides and chemicals\n\nto the pharmaceutical and health care industries. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals also\n\nmarkets MelaPure(TM) brand melatonin, a dietary supplement.\n\nRELATED ENTITIES\n\nGENZYME DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, L.P. In 1989, Genzyme sponsored Genzyme\n\nDevelopment Partners, L.P. (\"GDP\"), a research and development limited\n\npartnership that raised $36.75 million through the private placement of limited\n\npartnership interests and warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common\n\nstock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Genzyme is the general partner of GDP and\n\nholds a 1% partnership interest therein. The Company entered into a contract\n\nwith GDP to perform research and development of the Sepra Products for which the\n\nCompany was reimbursed its costs plus a 10% fee. The program to develop and\n\nmarket the Sepra Products is allocated to Genzyme General.\n\nAll of GDP's capital available to fund development of the Sepra Products\n\nwas spent by the end of the first quarter of 1994. Additional funds will be\n\nrequired to complete the development and clinical testing of Sepracoat(TM) and\n\nSepragel(TM). While Genzyme is not obligated to fund additional development of\n\nthe Sepra Products, it has funded such development since the first quarter of\n\n1994 and will continue such funding during 1997.\n\nUnder the terms of the various agreements between GDP and Genzyme, GDP has\n\nthe exclusive right to sell Seprafilm(TM), Sepracoat(TM), Sepragel(TM),\n\nHAL-S(TM) and other HA-based surgical products in the U.S. and Canada through a\n\njoint venture with Genzyme (the \"Joint Venture\"). Genzyme was granted back an\n\nexclusive license to sell these products outside the U.S. and Canada subject to\n\na royalty on European sales of these products under certain circumstances.\n\nThe Joint Venture was formed in 1989 for the purpose of manufacturing and\n\nmarketing GDP's products and commenced operations in 1996 following approval in\n\nAugust by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") to market\n\nSeprafilm(TM) in the U.S. (the \"Business Commencement Date\"). Under the\n\nagreement between GDP and Genzyme governing the Joint Venture (the \"Joint\n\nVenture Agreement\"), GDP has contributed to the Joint Venture the use of its\n\ntechnology and $200,000, and Genzyme has contributed its agreement to\n\nmanufacture and market the Sepra Products, to make non-interest bearing loans\n\nto the Joint Venture in the amount of any working capital deficiency, to make\n\ncapital contributions to the extent deemed necessary by the two venturers in\n\nconnection with the business of the Joint Venture and to allow the use of such\n\ntrademarks, tradenames and logos as the venturers shall determine to be\n\nnecessary and advisable for manufacturing and marketing the Sepra Products. The\n\ncost of Sepra Products purchased by the Joint Venture from Genzyme is\n\ndetermined pursuant to a formula in the Joint Venture Agreement.\n\n2\n\n4\n\nThe Joint Venture Agreement calls for GDP and Genzyme to determine,\n\nfollowing the Business Commencement Date, the allocation of profits and losses\n\nbetween the parties and the level of reimbursement to Genzyme for providing\n\ngeneral and administrative services to the Joint Venture.\n\nIn March 1997, GDP and Genzyme amended and restated the Joint Venture\n\nAgreement (as so amended and restated, the \"Amended and Restated Joint Venture\n\nAgreement\") to address matters the original Joint Venture Agreement provided\n\nwere to be agreed upon on or about the Business Commencement Date and to\n\naddress certain other matters. The Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement\n\nis retroactive to August 17, 1996, the date of the first commercial sale of\n\nSeprafilm(TM), and provides that:\n\n(1) losses generated by the Joint Venture are allocated (a) the first\n\n$200,000 to GDP and then (b) 40% to GDP and 60% to Genzyme, provided however,\n\nthat to the extent a loss allocated to GDP would, pursuant to the terms of GDP\n\npartnership agreement, be allocated to the general partner rather than the\n\nlimited partners, such loss is allocated 100% to Genzyme; and\n\n(2) profits are allocated (a) the first $5.6 million to GDP, (b) the\n\nnext $8.4 million to Genzyme and (c) thereafter, 40% to GDP and 60% to Genzyme.\n\nThe Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement also provides that\n\nGenzyme will receive no reimbursement for the general and administrative\n\nservices it provides to the Joint Venture until the first year in which the\n\nJoint Venture is projected to generate revenues in excess of $25 million at\n\nwhich time, Genzyme will receive a quarterly commission equal to 10% of the\n\nJoint Venture's revenues for such quarter. In connection with arriving at\n\nagreement on the foregoing matters, the parties also agreed to amend the Joint\n\nVenture Agreement to provide GDP with enhanced oversight mechanisms, including\n\nan audit right, and to eliminate Genzyme's unilateral right to withdraw from\n\nthe Joint Venture.\n\nIn connection with negotiating the Amended and Restated Joint Venture\n\nAgreement, the Joint Venture entered into an exclusive marketing and\n\ndistribution agreement (the \"Marketing and Distribution Agreement\") with\n\nGenzyme whereby Genzyme will act as sole distributor of the Sepra Products for\n\nthe Joint Venture. The Joint Venture agreed to sell Sepra Products to Genzyme\n\nat the price at which Genzyme is selling the applicable products to the end\n\nuser less a distributor's discount (subject to a minimum purchase price) and\n\nalso agreed to reimburse Genzyme for certain costs incurred in connection with\n\nmarket introduction of the Sepra Products. The economic terms of the proposed\n\nMarketing and Distribution Agreement are intended to be substantially similar\n\nto those applicable if Genzyme provided such services in its capacity as a\n\nventurer rather than as a distributor. At the request of a special committee of\n\ndirectors of the general partner consisting of the two directors who are not\n\naffiliated with Genzyme, Genzyme also entered into a tax indemnification\n\nagreement (the \"Tax Indemnification Agreement\") with GDP in which Genzyme\n\nagreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify the limited partners\n\nagainst loss of the benefits of certain research and development deductions\n\ncertain limited partners have taken (net of potential tax savings due to any\n\nresultant higher tax basis in the limited partnership interests). The Tax\n\nIndemnification Agreement can be waived by GDP in connection with a purchase of\n\nGDP by Genzyme.\n\n2A\n\n5\n\nThe Joint Venture will be dissolved (a) upon purchase by Genzyme of all of\n\nthe limited partnership interests (as described below), (b) if Genzyme does not\n\nexercise its option to purchase the limited partnership interests (i) upon the\n\nsale, license or other disposition of all or a substantial part of its\n\ntechnology by GDP or (ii) upon 90 days' notice by either venturer at any time\n\nafter the expiration of a one-year period commencing after the option to\n\npurchase the limited partnership interests expires, whichever shall first occur,\n\n(c) by operation of law, (d) upon the bankruptcy, retirement, withdrawal or\n\ndissolution of Genzyme, (e) upon mutual consent of Genzyme and GDP or (f) upon\n\nthe election by GDP if Genzyme fails to establish to the satisfaction of GDP\n\nthat it is capable of and has undertaken to manufacture the Joint Venture's\n\nrequirements for the products for a specified period.\n\nGenzyme has the option to buy all of the limited partnership interests in\n\nGDP for an initial payment of either cash or GGD Stock or a combination thereof,\n\nat its option, equal to $25.7 million (which amount will be recovered by\n\nGenzyme as a credit against subsequent royalty payments) and quarterly royalty\n\npayments for a period of ten years after the buy-out date equal to 10% of\n\nproduct sales in the U.S. and Canada (and 6% of such sales in Europe, but only\n\nto the extent necessary to meet certain projections made in connection with the\n\ninitial capitalization of GDP) and 5% of any revenues derived by Genzyme from\n\nsales in the U.S. and Canada (and 3% in Europe, but only in the instances cited\n\nabove) of non-HA-based products that are competitive with GDP's products. The\n\noption to purchase all of the limited partnership interests is exercisable\n\nduring a 90-day period commencing on August 31, 2001, but such commencement date\n\nwill be accelerated under certain circumstances.\n\nGENZYME TRANSGENICS CORPORATION. In February 1993, Genzyme formed Genzyme\n\nTransgenics Corporation (\"GTC\") and transferred to it all assets and liabilities\n\nof its business in the field of transgenic technology as applied to the\n\ndevelopment and production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic and\n\ndiagnostic uses in exchange for shares of GTC's stock. In addition, Genzyme\n\nexclusively licensed to GTC all patents, licenses and other intellectual\n\nproperty in the field (excluding that related to a CF-related protein). As of\n\nDecember 31, 1996, Genzyme owned approximately 43% of GTC.\n\nIn March 1996, Genzyme and GTC entered into a Convertible Debt and\n\nDevelopment Funding Agreement under which (i) Genzyme has made available to GTC\n\na $10 million credit line of 7% debt payable on March 31, 1998 and convertible\n\nby either party into shares of GTC common stock, (ii) Genzyme has agreed to fund\n\nthe development costs associated with transgenic recombinant antithrombin III\n\n(\"ATIII\"), and (iii) in exchange for funding such development costs and for\n\nmaking available the credit line, Genzyme has received the right to co-market\n\nATIII with GTC throughout the world, other than Asia. The agreement to fund the\n\nATIII program was due to expire on March 31, 1997. The parties have agreed to\n\nextend the agreement until June 30, 1997 and are negotiating an agreement to\n\nprovide for long-term development of the AT-III program. There can be no\n\nassurance that Genzyme and GTC will reach a definitive agreement to provide for\n\nsuch development and, if no agreement is reached, Genzyme's co-marketing rights\n\nwill terminate.\n\n3\n\n6\n\nUnder other contractual arrangements between Genzyme and GTC, Genzyme\n\nGeneral may engage GTC to perform transgenic research and development on\n\nproteins of interest to Genzyme. GTC has contracted with Genzyme for\n\npurification and protein chemistry research and development services to be\n\nperformed by Genzyme General. Genzyme leases laboratory and office space to GTC\n\nand provides it with certain administrative and support services for which GTC\n\npays fees based on Genzyme's costs.\n\nNEOZYME II CORPORATION. Neozyme II Corporation (\"Neozyme II\") was formed in\n\nMarch 1992 to contract with Genzyme to conduct research, development and\n\nclinical testing of biotherapeutic products for the treatment of CF. In May\n\n1992, Genzyme and Neozyme II completed an initial public offering of units which\n\nresulted in gross proceeds to Neozyme II of approximately $84.5 million. On\n\nOctober 28, 1996, Genzyme completed a tender offer for the outstanding units of\n\nNeozyme II for $45 per unit in cash in which 98.8% of the units were tendered\n\nand accepted for payment at an aggregate purchase price of $107.4 million. Each\n\nunit consisted of one share of callable common stock of Neozyme II (\"Callable\n\nCommon Stock\") and one warrant to purchase two shares of GGD Stock and .135\n\nshare of GTR Stock. On December 6, 1996, Neozyme II was merged with a subsidiary\n\nof Genzyme and the remaining outstanding shares of Callable Common Stock were\n\ncancelled and converted into the right to receive $29.00 per share in cash. The\n\nCallable Warrants included in the untendered units separated from the shares of\n\nCallable Common Stock converted in the merger and became exercisable on December\n\n6, 1996.\n\nSPECIALTY THERAPEUTICS\n\nGenzyme General's strategy is to use its technological strengths,\n\nparticularly its ability to modify and produce DNA and proteins and its\n\nexpertise in fermentation, carbohydrate engineering and gene therapy, to develop\n\nsafe and effective therapeutic products to address major unmet medical needs.\n\nGenzyme General is currently selling Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme\n\nand has several therapeutic products in various stages of the research,\n\ndevelopment, clinical testing and regulatory review processes. There can be no\n\nassurance that any of the products under development will be successfully\n\ncompleted or that FDA approval of any of these product will be obtained.\n\nSPECIALTY THERAPEUTICS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\n=============================================================================================================\n\nPartners and\n\nProduct/Program Indication/Application Status(1) Collaborators\n\n- --------------- ---------------------- --------- -------------\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme/ Treatment of Gaucher Commercial sales\n\nCerezyme(R) enzyme disease\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThyrogen(R) recombinant Diagnosis and treatment Phase III clinical trial\n\nhuman thyroid stimulating of thyroid cancer\n\nhormone metastases\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTransgenic antithrombin Control of blood clotting Phase I/II clinical trial Genzyme Transgenics\n\nIII during coronary artery Corporation\n\nbypass surgery\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGene therapy\n\nCFTR/adenovirus Cystic fibrosis Pilot clinical study\n\nvector\n\nCFTR/lipid vector Cystic fibrosis Pilot clinical study\n\nMART 1/adenovirus Metastatic malignant Pilot clinical study National Cancer Institute\n\nvector melanoma\n\ngp100/adenovirus Metastatic malignant Pilot clinical study National Cancer Institute\n\nvector melanoma\n\n4\n\n7\n\nPartners and\n\nProduct/Program Indication/Application Status(1) Collaborators\n\n- --------------- ---------------------- --------- -------------\n\nEx vivo stem Gaucher disease Pilot clinical study University of Pittsburgh,\n\ncells/retrovirus IntroGene B.V.\n\nvector\n\nVarious proprietary Cardiovascular disease Research Duke University,\n\nvectors for gene University of California\n\ntherapy at San Diego\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[alpha]-galactosidase Fabry disease Preclinical development\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProlactin Maintenance of immune Preclinical development\n\nsystem function\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChitinase Anti-fungal agent Preclinical development\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Research status indicates work up to and including small scale production of the targeted product. Preclinical\n\ndevelopment status includes work done to increase yields and standardize manufacturing processes and studies\n\nin animals to support an application to the FDA to commence clinical testing in humans. Human clinical trials\n\nfor products classified by the FDA as \"drugs\" or \"biologics\" are generally conducted in three phases: Phase I,\n\nto determine safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects; Phase II, to provide preliminary evidence of\n\nefficacy in the patient population targeted by the product; and Phase III, sometimes referred to as pivotal\n\ntrials, to provide data for proof of safety and effectiveness. Pilot clinical studies are clinical trials for\n\nnovel therapies, such as gene therapies, where the product is initially tested in the patient population\n\ntargeted by the product for safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary evidence of efficacy. Following\n\ncompletion of the pivotal clinical studies, an application for marketing approval of a new drug (an \"NDA\") or\n\nlicensure of a biological product (a \"PLA\") is submitted to the FDA.\n\n===================================================================================================================\n\nCEREDASE(R) ENZYME (ALGLUCERASE INJECTION) AND CEREZYME(R) ENZYME\n\n(IMIGLUCERASE INJECTION). Treatment with Ceredase(R) enzyme or Cerezyme(R)\n\nenzyme replacement therapy currently represents the only safe and effective\n\ntreatment for Gaucher disease, a seriously debilitating, sometimes fatal genetic\n\ndisorder caused by a deficiency in an important enzyme in the body called\n\nglucocerebrosidase (\"GCR\"). This deficiency results in the accumulation of the\n\nlipid glucocerebroside in the body. The disease is characterized by an enlarged\n\nliver or spleen, anemia, bleeding problems, bone and joint pain, fatigue and\n\northopedic complications such as repeated fractures and bone erosion.\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme is a modified form of human GCR in which glycoprotein\n\nremodeling technology has been used to target GCR to the cells where the lipid\n\naccumulation occurs. Cerezyme(R) enzyme is a recombinant form of GCR which has\n\nbeen remodeled in a similar manner.\n\nGenzyme General is marketing these products directly to physicians,\n\nhospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained sales force.\n\nThis marketing effort is directed at identifying and initiating treatment for\n\nthe 5,000 Gaucher patients Genzyme General believes exist worldwide. Currently,\n\napproximately one-third of these patients are receiving treatment. Ceredase(R)\n\nenzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme, together, are available in approximately 50\n\ncountries worldwide. Ceredase(R) enzyme has received marketing approval in 14\n\ncountries, most recently Japan and Belgium, with applications pending in two\n\nother countries. Genzyme is the first biotechnology company to obtain drug\n\napproval in Japan without a partner. Cerezyme(R) enzyme has received marketing\n\napproval in four countries, most recently in Canada and Portugal, with\n\napplications pending in the European Union and other countries.\n\nGenzyme General produces Ceredase(R) enzyme from an extract of human\n\nplacental tissue supplied by Pasteur Merieux, a French company that is the only\n\nsignificant commercial source of this material. The current supply available is\n\nnot sufficient to produce enough Ceredase(R) enzyme to supply all present\n\npatients. To address supply constraints, Genzyme developed Cerezyme(R) enzyme.\n\nIn October of 1996, Genzyme General received FDA approval to manufacture\n\nCerezyme(R) enzyme in a new, large-scale manufacturing plant located in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts. Once an uninterrupted supply of Cerezyme(R) enzyme can be\n\nproduced by the new plant, patients receiving Ceredase(R) enzyme will be\n\nconverted\n\n5\n\n8\n\nto Cerezyme(R) enzyme. Genzyme General will be required to continue\n\nmanufacturing Ceredase(R) enzyme until the process of patient conversions is\n\ncompleted, which is expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 1998. Any\n\ndisruption in the supply or manufacturing process of Ceredase(R) enzyme during\n\nthe conversion period or in the supply or manufacturing process of Cerezyme(R)\n\nenzyme may have a material adverse effect on revenue.\n\nTHYROGEN(R) HORMONE. Genzyme General is developing Thyrogen(R) hormone, a\n\nrecombinant form of human thyroid stimulating hormone, for use as an adjunct to\n\nthe approximately 100,000 to 200,000 diagnostic and therapeutic procedures\n\nundertaken each year to detect and treat metastases of thyroid cancer. Genzyme\n\nGeneral believes that the administration of Thyrogen(R) hormone may increase the\n\neffectiveness and result in fewer adverse side effects for patients undergoing\n\ncurrent standard medical procedures for thyroid cancer.\n\nThyrogen(R) hormone was demonstrated to be safe and effective in\n\nstimulating the uptake of radioiodine for whole body scanning in a 1992 Phase\n\nI/II clinical study. A Phase III multi-center clinical study completed late in\n\n1993 provided evidence that the use of Thyrogen(R) hormone prior to diagnostic\n\nscanning greatly improved the quality of life in 94% of thyroid cancer patients\n\ntested and was effective in producing scans that were as good as or better than\n\nconventional scans in 86% of those patients. To confirm the results of this\n\nstudy, Genzyme General is conducting a second Phase III study, results from\n\nwhich are expected to be available in mid-1997. If the current study confirms\n\nthe prior results, marketing applications are expected to be filed by the end of\n\n1997 in the U.S. and Europe and by early 1998 in Canada. Following its NDA\n\nfiling, Genzyme plans to make Thyrogen(R) hormone available to patients in the\n\nU.S. who meet certain criteria under a treatment IND that allows Genzyme to\n\ngather additional information regarding use of the product while recovering\n\nappropriate costs of the product and the treatment.\n\nTRANSGENIC ANTITHROMBIN III. ATIII is a human blood protein that acts as\n\nan anticoagulant. Depressed levels of ATIII can lead to increased risk of\n\nthrombosis (clotting) in patients with either hereditary ATIII deficiency or an\n\nacquired ATIII deficiency often associated with multiple disease states, such as\n\nsepsis, various surgeries, multiple trauma and liver disease.\n\nNatural ATIII derived from donated human plasma currently is sold worldwide\n\nfor multiple indications. GTC is developing a transgenic source for ATIII to\n\naddress anticipated growth in the market to treat ATIII deficiency by protein\n\nreplacement therapy. Genzyme General and GTC believe that current sources of\n\nplasma derived ATIII will be inadequate to address this growth. In combination\n\nwith Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and SMI Genzyme Limited, a\n\njoint venture between GTC and Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd., GTC has developed\n\na herd of transgenic goats at its production facility in central Massachusetts\n\nthat produce active recombinant ATIII.\n\nIn October 1996, GTC announced that the results of a Phase I trial\n\nconducted in the United Kingdom showed transgenic ATIII was well tolerated in\n\nhealthy subjects. In December 1996, GTC commenced a Phase I/II clinical trial of\n\ntransgenic ATIII in the U.S.. In this trial, the product will be administered to\n\n27 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a dose-escalating\n\nstudy to determine the safety of transgenic ATIII in this patient population.\n\nGTC expects to complete the trial during the first half of 1997. Genzyme General\n\nis funding the development of transgenic ATIII pursuant to an agreement with GTC\n\nunder which Genzyme General has obtained co-marketing rights for the product\n\noutside of Asia. See \"Related Entities -- Genzyme Transgenics Corporation.\"\n\nGENE THERAPY\n\nOVERVIEW. Gene therapy is an innovative technology being developed by\n\nGenzyme General to treat CF, cancer, Gaucher disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGene therapy involves the delivery of a gene responsible for production of a\n\nparticular protein of interest into cells of a patient in order to trigger the\n\ncell to produce the encoded protein for some therapeutic purpose.\n\nGenzyme General's gene therapy research began in 1991 as part of its\n\nefforts to develop novel treatments for CF on behalf of Neozyme I Corporation\n\n(\"Neozyme I\"). Genzyme acquired the CF program from Neozyme I and transferred it\n\nto Neozyme II in 1992. Genzyme acquired Neozyme II in October 1996. See\n\n\"Business-- Related Entities.\" Since 1991, Genzyme General has expended over $60\n\nmillion in gene therapy research and has established a broad proprietary core\n\ntechnology base that includes gene delivery systems, in vitro and in vivo model\n\nsystems, production capabilities and a dedicated clinical and regulatory staff.\n\n6\n\n9\n\nBecause of the innovative nature of gene therapy and public policy issues\n\nsurrounding the insertion of new genetic information into cells, Genzyme General\n\nexpects that early clinical evaluation will continue to entail especially\n\ncareful testing in a limited number of patients. Genzyme General is currently\n\nconducting pilot clinical studies of gene therapy products. The timing and\n\nresults of these initial studies will determine whether and when pivotal trials\n\nto determine safety and effectiveness will be undertaken. These pivotal trials\n\nmay involve large groups of patients for lengthy periods of time in order to\n\naddress the uncertainties surrounding insertion of new genetic information into\n\nhumans and to show clinical effectiveness in the treatment of a progressive\n\ndisease.\n\nCYSTIC FIBROSIS. CF is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting the\n\nCaucasian population. Approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the U.S. is\n\nborn with the disease and there currently are approximately 30,000 cystic\n\nfibrosis patients in North America. CF is caused by a mutation in the gene\n\nresponsible for determining the molecular structure of a protein called cystic\n\nfibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (\"CFTR\"). Although improvements\n\nhave been made over the last 20 years in alleviating certain symptoms of the\n\ndisease and delaying its progress, the underlying disease remains untreated and\n\npatients have an average life expectancy of only 29 years.\n\nGenzyme General's work has concentrated on a gene therapy approach to\n\ncorrect the basic defect in CF cells whereby the mutant genes are augmented with\n\ngenes that would enable the patient's cells to produce normal CFTR protein.\n\nGenzyme General's scientists have demonstrated that the defective ion transport\n\nmechanism present in airway cells taken from CF patients can be corrected in\n\nvitro by the insertion of normal CFTR genes into the cells. The techniques for\n\ninserting genetic material into cells outside the body are not expected to be\n\nuseful in gene therapy for CF, however, because there is no practical way to\n\nremove, treat and implant the treated cells in the airways of CF patients. For\n\nthis reason, Genzyme General's proposed gene therapy product will likely need to\n\nbe administered directly to the airways of the lung. Genzyme General also\n\nbelieves that its gene therapy product would need to be readministered\n\nperiodically as the transferred gene ceases to function or is lost and as the\n\ntreated cells naturally die and are replaced.\n\nViral Vectors. In 1993, Genzyme General and collaborators at the\n\nUniversity of Iowa conducted a small study in CF patients using an\n\nadenovirus-gene product administered to nasal epithelium. Results collected from\n\nthe study showed that it is possible to correct the biochemical defect in CF\n\ncells in nasal epithelium in vivo. The study results, published in October 1993,\n\nwere the first published report of a successful gene transfer in CF patients and\n\nthe first successful application of an adenovirus vector in gene therapy. In a\n\n1995 publication reporting the results of a similar study, however, researchers\n\nfrom the University of North Carolina questioned the efficacy of gene transfer\n\nusing adenovirus. In addition, data from a study involving repeat administration\n\nof Genzyme's second generation adenovirus vector to the nasal epithelium of CF\n\npatients showed that, although the virus appeared safe, a complex immune\n\nresponse to the adenovirus was measured in almost all patients. This and other\n\ndata obtained in animals and submitted for publication in 1995 suggest that\n\nimmune response may limit the efficacy of repeat dose therapy with adenovirus.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1994, Genzyme General received Recombinant DNA\n\nAdvisory Committee (\"RAC\") approval and submitted a protocol to the FDA for a\n\ntwo part safety study involving administration of its second generation\n\nadenovirus vector to the lungs of up to 40 CF patients via bronchoscope and\n\naerosol. Bronchoscopic administration commenced in the first quarter of 1995,\n\nand aerosol administration commenced in September 1995. Additionally, in\n\nSeptember 1995, Genzyme switched to the use of a third-generation adenovirus\n\nvector with an improved safety profile as part of this same study. The study is\n\ncurrently ongoing.\n\nIn parallel with these clinical studies, Genzyme General is conducting\n\nextensive research into proving the safety and efficacy of adenovirus.\n\nParticular emphasis is being placed on immunology, since it now appears that new\n\nvectors or methods need to be developed so as to reduce the patient's immune\n\nresponse and to increase the efficacy of adenovirus vectors. Such improvements\n\nmay be necessary in order for adenovirus vectors to be clinically useful in\n\nchronic therapy.\n\nNon-Viral Vectors. In addition to pursuing adenovirus and other viral\n\nvectors, Genzyme General is developing lipid-DNA complexes as vectors for gene\n\ntherapy. Genzyme General believes that lipid-based vectors may offer advantages\n\ndue to their reduced immunogenicity and ease of manufacture relative to viral\n\nvectors. Genzyme General has synthesized, evaluated and filed patent\n\napplications on numerous new lipids. Several of these have shown significantly\n\ngreater activity in vivo than commercially available lipids. To augment its\n\ninternal efforts, Genzyme has entered into arrangements with third parties to\n\ngain access to non-viral gene delivery technologies. To date, the most\n\nsignificant such arrangement is an exclusive license agreement with Vical, Inc.\n\nexecuted in October 1996 for Vical's\n\n7\n\n10\n\ncytofectins for use as non-viral gene delivery vectors for treating CF. The\n\nplasmid expression system containing the DNA also affects expression efficiency,\n\nand Genzyme General has designed various new plasmid constructs to enhance\n\nexpression. Although substantial progress has been made in both lipid and\n\nplasmid constructs, currently the optimal formulation of the best lipid-DNA\n\ncomplex is still less efficient than adenovirus as measured in single dose in\n\nvivo experiments.\n\nIn December 1993, a Genzyme General collaborator received RAC approval for\n\na CF nasal protocol utilizing a lipid-DNA complex containing DMRIE, one of\n\nVical's proprietary cytofectins. This study commenced in September 1995 and is\n\ncurrently ongoing. In December 1994, Genzyme General also initiated a\n\ncollaboration with a British academic group for purposes of further studying\n\nGenzyme General's proprietary lipid-DNA complexes.\n\nIn December 1995, Genzyme General submitted an IND to the FDA for a nasal\n\nstudy using a proprietary lipid-DNA complex developed by Genzyme General. The\n\nstudy was initiated in January 1996 by Genzyme and its collaborators at the\n\nUniversity of Iowa and completed in the second quarter of 1996. The study\n\nentailed the administration of the lipid-DNA complex to one nostril of nine CF\n\npatients and administration of the DNA plasmid alone to the patients' other\n\nnostril as a control. Although the results showed that the lipid-DNA compound\n\nwas well tolerated, they did not demonstrate the lipid-DNA compound to be\n\nsuperior to the plasmid DNA in improving ion exchange across the cell membrane.\n\nAlso in the second quarter of 1996, Genzyme General completed a safety\n\nstudy in which the lipid alone was delivered in aerosol form to the lungs of 15\n\nnon-CF volunteers. The study showed that aerosolized delivery of the lipid to\n\nthe lung was well tolerated. Based on these results, a pilot study involving\n\naerosol administration of a lipid- DNA complex to the lungs of CF patients was\n\ninitiated in the fourth quarter in the United Kingdom. This study is ongoing.\n\nCANCER. There are currently several approaches that can be taken to treat\n\ncancer using gene therapy. Some of these approaches are limited by the inability\n\nof current gene delivery technology to affect every cell in a tissue. To address\n\nthese limitations, Genzyme General has focused on two approaches that it\n\nbelieves may be effective with the current generation of gene delivery vehicles:\n\nimmunotherapy and cytotoxic or \"suicide\" genes. Genzyme General believes that\n\ncombinatorial strategies employing two or more gene therapy approaches, or a\n\ngene therapy approach with traditional chemotherapeutic or radiological therapy,\n\nwill be useful in treating aggressive forms of the disease, particularly\n\nmetastatic cancer.\n\nImmunotherapy - MART-1 and gp100 for Melanoma. Melanoma is a cancer of\n\nthe skin affecting melanocytes, the normal cells that color the skin, and is\n\ncommonly associated with overexposure to the sun. Melanoma is far more serious\n\nthan other types of skin cancer, accounting for three quarters of all deaths\n\nfrom skin cancer despite representing only 5% of all such cases. The incidence\n\nof melanoma is increasing at a faster rate than that of any other type of cancer\n\nin the U.S. Over 38,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed and more than\n\n7,000 deaths from this disease are projected to occur in the U.S. during 1997.\n\nWorldwide, incidence of melanoma is estimated to be 90,000 new cases per year.\n\nGenzyme General's melanoma gene therapy program has centered on the\n\ndelivery of the MART-1 and gp100 genes to dendritic cells to elicit systemic\n\nanti-melanoma T cell responses. Under a Collaborative Research and Development\n\nAgreement (\"CRADA\") with the National Cancer Institute (\"NCI\"), Genzyme General\n\nhas constructed, in conjunction with Dr. Steven Rosenberg at the NCI, adenoviral\n\nvectors incorporating the MART-1 or gp100 tumor antigen genes. In vitro studies\n\nhave demonstrated that cells which do not express either tumor antigen become\n\ntargets for destruction by antigen specific T cells following infection with an\n\nadenovirus incorporating the appropriate tumor antigen genes. Subsequent\n\npreclinical animal studies at the NCI demonstrated that: (i) prior immunization\n\nwith an adenovirus incorporating the gp100 tumor antigen gene can provide\n\nprotection against melanoma cells; (ii) adoptive transfer of spleen cells\n\nderived from animals immunized with the adenovirus carrying the gene\n\nincorporating gp100 can confer protection against melanoma tumor cells,\n\nsuggesting that the virus is indeed able to elicit T cell response and (iii)\n\nimmunization with the gp100 virus can dramatically reduce the number of lung\n\nmetastases in a model of established melanoma particularly when co-administered\n\nwith interleukin-2, a T cell growth factor.\n\nThese promising preclinical results led to the initiation of two pilot\n\nclinical studies, designed by Dr. Rosenberg and which are currently underway at\n\nthe NCI. In these studies, adenovirus vectors carrying either the MART-1\n\n(Ad2/MART-1) or gp100 (Ad2/gp100) gene are being evaluated for safety,\n\nimmunologic reactivity and potential\n\n8\n\n11\n\ntherapeutic effect when administered alone or in conjunction with recombinant\n\ninterleukin-2. Patients in these studies have metastatic melanoma and have not\n\nreceived alternative therapies during the four weeks prior to administration.\n\nPreliminary results from these studies indicate that the adenoviral vectors\n\nare safe and well tolerated, and that a small but significant number of the 34\n\npatients immunized with Ad2/MART-1 have shown significant tumor regression\n\nfollowing administration of the adenovirus. Clinical evaluation is in process to\n\ndetermine whether immunization with the adenoviral vector leads to the\n\ngeneration of an anti-melanoma antigen specific cytotoxic T cell response. Data\n\ngathered from these studies should enable Genzyme General to identify baseline\n\nclinical parameters that correlate with a favorable response to the vaccine and\n\nestablish patient inclusion criteria for a Phase II clinical trial. Genzyme\n\nGeneral has the option to license the MART-1 and gp100 genes from the NCI for\n\nuse in adenoviral gene therapy for melanoma.\n\nSuicide Gene Therapy for Liver Cancer. Approximately 18,000 new cases\n\nof primary liver cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, and the disease\n\naccounts for approximately 14,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. The annual number\n\nof deaths worldwide from liver cancer is estimated to exceed 250,000, with the\n\nfive-year survival rate for localized liver cancer being only 15%. If detected\n\nat an early stage, surgical removal (resection) of the affected portion of the\n\nliver is possible, but diagnosis usually occurs too late for this treatment to\n\nbe of benefit. The median survival for patients with non-resectable liver cancer\n\nis about six months.\n\nGenzyme General is collaborating with Dr. Jack Wands at Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Hospital on the development of gene therapies to treat liver cancer. Dr.\n\nWands has developed proprietary antibodies that can be utilized to target the\n\ndelivery of a gene therapy vector to hepatocellular carcinoma (\"HCC\") cells.\n\nGenzyme General and Dr. Wards are also exploring the use of antibody targeted\n\nvectors to deliver suicide genes to HCC cells. Genzyme General has an option to\n\nlicense Dr. Ward's technology for gene therapy of HCC.\n\nGAUCHER DISEASE. Genzyme General is collaborating with the University of\n\nPittsburgh and IntroGene, B.V., in the development of a hematopoietic stem cell\n\ngene therapy for Gaucher disease. A pilot clinical study is in process at the\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh to determine the safety of an ex vivo retroviral vector\n\napproach. Two patients have completed the treatment protocol to date. Both of\n\nthe treated patients have detectable levels of circulating GCR enzyme activity.\n\nThe study is currently ongoing.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. In December 1996, Genzyme General entered into\n\ncollaborations with scientists at Duke University and the University of\n\nCalifornia, San Diego (\"UCSD\"), to develop gene therapies for congestive heart\n\nfailure, vein graft failure, and restenosis. Additionally, through its\n\ncollaboration with UCSD, Genzyme General will be developing a gene therapy\n\napplication to protect heart tissue from oxygen damage that can occur during\n\nvarious types of cardiac procedures. Each collaboration calls for Genzyme\n\nGeneral to provide vectors and research funding to support pre-clinical research\n\nby the academic collaborator and future clinical trials in exchange for rights\n\nto any products resulting from the collaboration.\n\nOther Specialty Therapeutics\n\n[ALPHA]-GAL. Genzyme General is developing a recombinant form of the human\n\nenzyme [alpha]-galactosidase (\"[alpha]-Gal\") as a treatment for Fabry disease, a\n\nusually fatal inherited disorder of lipid metabolism estimated to afflict\n\nbetween 2,000 and 4,000 people worldwide. Fabry disease patients experience\n\nclinical symptoms which include pain, numbness, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular\n\ncomplications and deterioration of kidney function; death general occurs between\n\n40 and 50 years of age. There is no known treatment for the underlying disease\n\nand current medical practice involves pain management and kidney dialysis and/or\n\ntransplantation to reduce symptoms.\n\nGenzyme General believes that protein replacement therapy is a rational\n\napproach to the treatment of Fabry disease. To date, it has successfully\n\nproduced the recombinant [alpha]-Gal enzyme in mammalian cells and has shown it\n\ncan reduce lipid levels in the plasma and tissues of a Fabry mouse model. The\n\ndevelopment program is currently focused on producing sufficient quantities of\n\nenzyme for pilot clinical studies, which are expected to begin in late 1997 or\n\nearly 1998.\n\nPROLACTIN. Genzyme General is developing a recombinant form of the human\n\nhormone prolactin for use as an immune stimulant. Prolactin acts as a cytokine\n\non a broad array of immune cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, bone\n\nmarrow and natural killer cells. Potential clinical applications include\n\nimmunologic/hematopoietic reconstitution for myelosuppressed and\n\nimmunocompromised patient populations and as a vaccine adjuvant.\n\n9\n\n12\n\nTo date, Genzyme General has demonstrated the utility of prolactin in\n\nseveral in vitro and in vivo models and has produced sufficient quantities of\n\nprolactin from mammalian cells to begin pilot clinical studies. Its development\n\nprogram is currently focused on initiating a Phase I safety/pharmacokinetic\n\nstudy in the second half of 1997 and identifying a lead clinical indication for\n\nevaluation in 1998.\n\nCHITINASE. Genzyme General is evaluating recombinant human chitinase as a\n\ntherapeutic agent for treating systemic fungal infections. These types of\n\ninfections are often observed in immunosuppressed individuals such as patients\n\nwith AIDS.\n\nFungi contain the polysaccharide chitin as a component in their cell walls.\n\nIt is believed that chitinase, a chitin degrading enzyme produced by human\n\nmacrophages, may normally play a role in fighting fungal infections. It is\n\nbelieved that by augmenting chitinase levels systemically, it may be possible to\n\nsignificantly enhance the body's capacity to eliminate these type of microbial\n\ninfections in immunosuppressed patients. Current therapies for fighting fungal\n\ninfections such as amphotericin B are moderately effective but exhibit\n\nsignificant dose-limiting toxicities. The U.S. market size for a new safe and\n\neffective anti-fungal agent is estimated to be between $250 million and $500\n\nmillion per year.\n\nGenzyme General has produced recombinant human chitinase in a mammalian\n\nexpression system, purified significant quantities of the protein and is in the\n\nprocess of screening its antifungal activity in a number of different well\n\ncharacterized cell culture and animal model systems. Data from these studies are\n\nexpected to be available in fourth quarter of 1997.\n\nSURGICAL PRODUCTS\n\nThe Surgical Products business unit develops, manufactures and markets four\n\nprincipal product lines: the Sepra Products, cardiovascular fluid management\n\nsystems (chest drainage and autotransfusion systems), surgical closure systems\n\n(sutures and needles) and surgical instruments (cardiovascular punches and other\n\ncardiovascular, plastic surgery, endoscopic and general instruments). The fluid\n\nmanagement, closure, and instrument product lines were acquired in 1996 through\n\nGenzyme's acquisition of DSP. DSP employs a 110-person sales force, 60 of which\n\nare located in the U.S., to market products directly to cardiac, general,\n\ngynecologic, colon and rectal surgeons and hospital purchasing departments\n\nthroughout the U.S. and Europe. Genzyme General plans to increase the number of\n\nDSP sales representatives in the U.S. to 100 by the end of 1997.\n\nSEPRA PRODUCTS. Genzyme General is developing and selling the Sepra\n\nProducts to be used during surgical procedures to limit the formation of\n\npostoperative adhesions. Adhesions are fibrous structures that connect tissues\n\nor organ surfaces that are not normally joined. They are an undesirable side\n\neffect of the body's normal healing process following damage to tissue.\n\nAdhesions can cause significant complications such as bowel obstruction\n\nfollowing abdominal surgery, infertility and pain following gynecological\n\nsurgery and restricted limb motion following musculoskeletal surgery. Adhesions\n\nthat form as a result of cardiac surgery can increase the complexity, duration\n\nand risk of subsequent cardiac surgery.\n\nThe Sepra Products portfolio is comprised of the following products:\n\n* SEPRAFILM(TM) BIORESORBABLE MEMBRANE is a solid formulation of\n\nmodified HA and is used to separate and protect tissues and organs that\n\nhave been damaged by surgery. The membrane is designed to last several days\n\nin the body.\n\n* SEPRACOAT(TM) COATING SOLUTION is a liquid formulation of HA that,\n\nwhen used to coat tissues and organ surfaces at the start of and throughout\n\nsurgical procedures, forms a temporary physical barrier that may protect\n\ntissues during surgery.\n\n* SEPRAGEL(TM) BIORESORBABLE GEL is a highly viscous gel form of\n\nmodified HA and is intended to be used to separate and protect tissues and\n\norgans that have been damaged by surgery. Sepragel(TM) is intended to be\n\nused in laparoscopic procedures and on tissue surfaces that are\n\ninaccessible to Seprafilm(TM). Similar to Seprafilm(TM), the gel is\n\ndesigned to last several days in the body.\n\nThe programs to develop the Sepra Products achieved a number of significant\n\nmilestones in 1996. During the third quarter of 1996, the FDA granted approval\n\nto market Seprafilm(TM) in any open abdominal or pelvic surgery. On behalf of\n\nthe Joint Venture with GDP, Genzyme General launched Seprafilm(TM) broadly in\n\nthe U.S. during the fourth quarter through the DSP sales force. The U.S. sales\n\nforce is focusing its efforts on the top 1,000 hospitals that perform 80% of the\n\ntargeted procedures for Seprafilm(TM) and the chiefs of surgery at key\n\ninstitutions and the clinical investigator group and their associates who are\n\nfamiliar with the product. Genzyme General believes the market opportunity for\n\nSeprafilm(TM) in the U.S. comprises an estimated 3.1 million surgeries annually:\n\n1.8 million open abdominal and 1.3 million open pelvic procedures that carry a\n\nrisk of postoperative adhesion-related complications. At the end of February in\n\nthe U.S., 476 hospitals had purchased Seprafilm(TM), an increase of 37 percent\n\nfrom the end of December, and the reorder rate for the product had increased to\n\n39 percent. Revenues from Seprafilm(TM) sales during 1996 were not material.\n\nIn February 1996, Seprafilm(TM) was granted the Approval of Conformity\n\nCertificate (the \"CE Mark\") in accordance with the European Medical Devices\n\nDirective. The CE Mark signifies that a product meets quality standards\n\nnecessary for marketing in the 18 countries of the European Union and the\n\nEuropean Economic Area. Genzyme General launched Seprafilm(TM) in Europe during\n\nthe second quarter of 1996. Genzyme General believes the number of open\n\n10\n\n13\n\nabdominal and open pelvic procedures that carry a risk of postoperative\n\nadhesion-related complications in Europe is approximately 2 million surgeries\n\nper year. In February 1997, Genzyme signed an agreement with Kaken\n\nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Kaken\"), Tokyo, to market the Sepra Products in\n\nJapan. Under the terms of this agreement, Kaken was granted co-marketing rights\n\nfor Seprafilm(TM) and Sepracoat(TM) in Japan in exchange for a distribution\n\nrights fee and milestone payments to Genzyme. Kaken was also granted an option\n\nto acquire co-marketing rights to Sepragel(TM) in Japan. Genzyme and Kaken will\n\nshare equally in the profits of all Sepra Products sold by Kaken.\n\nIn January 1996, Genzyme filed a PMA to market Sepracoat(TM) for use in\n\nabdominal, pelvic and cardio-thoracic surgical procedures. In February 1997, the\n\nFDA notified Genzyme that an advisory panel meeting will be held on May 5, 1997\n\nto review the PMA for Sepracoat(TM). The advisory panel will make a\n\nrecommendation to the FDA regarding approval of the PMA. The panel's\n\nrecommendation will be considered in the FDA's final review of the PMA, but is\n\nnot binding on the FDA. Sepracoat(TM) was also granted the CE Mark in 1996 and\n\nGenzyme General initiated marketing efforts for Sepracoat(TM) in Europe during\n\nthe fourth quarter of 1996. Sepracoat(TM) is being marketed in Denmark, France,\n\nGerman, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom as a complement to\n\nSeprafilm(TM).\n\nDuring the third quarter, Genzyme General received an IDE from the FDA for\n\nSepragel(TM) and commenced Phase I/II studies of the product for use in\n\nabdominal and gynecological procedures.\n\nA clinical trial for HAL-S(TM) synovial fluid replacement was completed in\n\nNovember 1995. HAL-S(TM) is a liquid formulation of HA intended to be used\n\nduring arthroscopic surgery to maintain normal joint function and reduce pain\n\nand inflammation following surgery. The study evaluated patients undergoing\n\narthroscopic surgery for repair of meniscal tears, a type of knee damage. The\n\ndata from the study showed some improvement in the rehabilitation rate of\n\npatients that received HAL-S(TM). In light of the relatively modest improvement\n\nand small potential market size, however, further development of HAL-S(TM) has\n\nbeen suspended.\n\nGenzyme General believes that successful initial market penetration and\n\nsubsequent maintenance of market share for Seprafilm(TM) and Sepracoat(TM)\n\nrequire a specialized hospital-based sales force and has deployed the DSP sales\n\nforce to accelerate the market introduction of these products in the U.S. and\n\nEurope. Substantial additional efforts to educate surgeons and hospital\n\nadministrators as to the benefits of these products will be required, however,\n\nin order for the products to penetrate target markets and gain broad market\n\nacceptance. There can be no assurance that Genzyme General will be successful in\n\nits efforts to implement a commercialization strategy for the Sepra Products.\n\nFunding for the development of the Sepra Products has been provided by GDP,\n\nwhich has the exclusive right to commercialize these products in the U.S. and\n\nCanada through the Joint Venture. GDP also has the right to a royalty on the\n\nGenzyme General's European sales of these products under certain circumstances.\n\nSince the first quarter of 1994, Genzyme General has funded development of the\n\nSepra Products on behalf of GDP on an annual basis and is continuing such\n\nfunding during 1997. See \"Related Entities--GDP.\"\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR FLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. This product line consists\n\nprimarily of self-contained, disposable chest drainage devices used to drain\n\nblood from the chest cavity following open heart surgery, other surgical\n\nprocedures and trauma. If the chest cavity is not properly drained, the patient\n\nmay suffer collapsed lungs, which often results in death. In 1967, DSP\n\nintroduced the first self-contained, disposable chest drainage unit, Pleur-\n\nevac(R), which quickly became the market leader in chest drainage devices, a\n\nposition it still holds today. DSP also sells autotransfusion devices that allow\n\nthe collection of blood shed by the patient and its reinfusion postoperatively,\n\nthus eliminating the risks associated with blood transfusions. In December 1995,\n\nDSP acquired a line of dry suction- controlled chest drainage and\n\nautotransfusion devices sold under the Thora-Klex(R) brand name. These products\n\noffer certain advantages over the existing systems sold by DSP and command\n\nhigher per unit prices.\n\nSURGICAL CLOSURE SYSTEMS. Surgical sutures, which are sold in packs\n\nconsisting of suture/needle combinations, are DSP's oldest product line. DSP\n\ndeveloped Tevdek(R) surgical sutures in 1950, the first coated Dacron-based\n\nsuture, followed by Silky Polydek, a softer, easier to handle and tie suture.\n\nDSP emphasizes high quality specialty sutures for cardiovascular and plastic\n\nsurgery, utilizing special materials, advanced metallurgy and packaging\n\ninnovations. Approximately 50% of DSP's U.S. sales are attributable to high\n\nmargin \"specials\" in which individual surgeons order nonstandard products and\n\ncustomized suture/needle combinations for specific procedures.\n\n11\n\n14\n\nSURGICAL INSTRUMENTS. DSP sells cardiovascular punches, which are used\n\nduring coronary artery bypass surgery to make cleanly cut holes, and hand-held,\n\nreusable instruments such as needleholders, scissors, forceps, graspers,\n\ndissectors and retractors. DSP's instruments are used in cardiovascular,\n\nplastic, endoscopic and general surgery and are sold directly to the surgeon,\n\nthe key decision maker on purchases of specialty instruments.\n\nIn January 1997, DSP launched a full line of instruments for use in\n\nendoscopic coronary artery bypass graft (\"CABG\") procedures. This new line is\n\nbeing marketed under the brand name EndoCABG(TM) System and was the first full\n\nline of instruments for this type of surgery approved by the FDA. The EndoCABG\n\nSystem includes both disposable and reusable instruments and includes the\n\ncomplete set of instruments required to perform cardiac bypass grafting\n\nendoscopically.\n\nTraditional cardiac surgery requires the surgeon to saw open the breastbone\n\nto gain access to the heart. Patients who undergo these procedures have severe\n\nscarring, an increased risk of infection, and long recovery periods following\n\nsurgery. The new field of minimally invasive cardiac surgery allows the surgeon\n\nto work on the heart through a relatively small incision without cutting the\n\nbreastbone. Through the use of endoscopes and specially designed forceps,\n\nscissors, and retractors, the surgeon can perform the same procedure without\n\nexposing the patient to as much pain, trauma, and postoperative risk. A\n\nless-invasive alternative to open heart surgery, balloon angioplasty, was\n\nintroduced in the 1980s. Although this procedure offers patients less pain,\n\ntrauma and a shorter recovery period, the disadvantage is that a high rate of\n\narteries becoming blocked again so that patients often need repeat treatment,\n\nsometimes as soon as six months after the initial procedure. About 500,000\n\nsingle bypass and balloon angioplasty procedures are performed annually in the\n\nU.S. By the year 2000, DSP believes that at least half of these procedures\n\ncould be replaced by minimally invasive CABG procedures in which the\n\nEndoCABG(TM) System could be used.\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the EndoCABG(TM) System, DSP\n\nentered into two agreements to expand the product line and to extend its use to\n\nother cardiac procedures. Under one agreement, the EndoCABG(TM) System will be\n\nexpanded so that surgeons can stop the heart with the aid of an aortic occlusion\n\nballoon developed by the Cook Group of Bloomington, Indiana. Under this\n\nagreement, Cook will manufacture the balloons and DSP will market them\n\nexclusively. DSP expects to begin offering the balloons as part of the\n\nEndoCABG(TM) System in the first half of 1998. The other agreement covers a\n\nproduct development and marketing alliance with CarboMedics, Inc. of Austin,\n\nTexas, a leading manufacturer of mechanical heart valves. Together, the\n\ncompanies are developing a system of instrumentation and supplies which will\n\nallow cardiac surgeons to introduce CarboMedics's mechanical heart valves\n\nthrough a small incision in the patient's chest wall. The companies expect to\n\nlaunch instruments for valve replacement procedures later this year.\n\nDuring 1996, DSP also signed agreements with leading endoscopic training\n\ncenters in the U.S. and Europe. Both centers will use the EndoCABG(TM) System\n\nfor minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Since September 1996, the Advanced\n\nLaproscopic Training Center in Atlanta has trained 40 surgeons to perform the\n\nnew minimally invasive cardiac surgery using DSP's EndoCABG(TM) System.\n\nBeginning in February 1997, the European Institute of Telesurgery of Strasbourg,\n\nFrance, has provided European surgeons with the same training offered in the\n\nU.S.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SERVICES\n\nGenzyme Genetics applies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high\n\nquality, sophisticated genetic diagnostic services to physicians, hospitals,\n\nuniversities, medical centers, clinical laboratories, genetic centers and\n\nmanaged care organizations in the U.S. and internationally through a national\n\nnetwork of laboratories. Testing services currently marketed by Genzyme Genetics\n\ninclude prenatal genetic diagnostic services, DNA-based diagnosis of a number of\n\ngenetic diseases, including some cancers. Genzyme Genetics also employs over 70\n\nboard certified genetics professionals who interpret results and provide genetic\n\ncounseling and support services to medical practitioners and their patients.\n\n12\n\n15\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SERVICES PORTFOLIO\n\nProduct/Program Indication/Application Status\n\n- --------------- ---------------------- ------\n\nBiochemical testing Screening for certain fetal Commercial\n\nchromosomal abnormalities service\n\nPrenatal cytogenetics Detection of fetal chromosomal Commercial\n\nabnormalities service\n\nInSight(R) molecular genetic testing Rapid detection of selected fetal Commercial\n\nchromosomal abnormalities service\n\nDNA testing Detection of single gene Commercial\n\ndisorders (CF, Fragile X, service\n\nHuntington's Disease, Gaucher\n\nDisease, etc.)\n\nMASDA(SM) Service Detection of CF mutations Commercial\n\nGenetic profiling service\n\nCancer Testing -- cancer Applications used singly or in Commercial\n\ncytogenetics, fluorescent in-situ tandem for detection and service\n\nhybridization \"FISH\", DNA prognosis of various forms of\n\ncancer\n\nFetal cell separation Detection of fetal chromosomal Preclinical\n\nabnormalities development\n\nCLAMSS Detection of unknown mutation Research\n\nPRENATAL AND POSTNATAL GENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. Genzyme Genetics offers\n\nthree types of genetic diagnostic services: biochemical testing, classical and\n\nmolecular cytogenetic testing, and DNA testing. Biochemical testing services\n\nconsist primarily of a widely used screening test (AFP3) to determine if further\n\nprenatal genetic testing is appropriate. Classical and molecular cytogenetic\n\ntesting involves the analysis of fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or\n\nchorionic villi sampling (\"CVS\") to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. DNA\n\ntesting is performed to determine the likelihood that the subject has, or is a\n\ncarrier for, a specific genetic disorder.\n\nGenzyme Genetics's strategy is to expand its genetic diagnostics business\n\nby providing a comprehensive range of high quality testing services in a timely,\n\naccurate and convenient manner; by aggressively marketing its services through a\n\ndirect sales force; and by maintaining an active research and development\n\nprogram that enables it to introduce additional testing services based on new\n\ntechnologies. Genzyme Genetics also has an active program to expand its\n\nlaboratory operations through acquisitions. In furtherance of this strategy,\n\nGenzyme Genetics acquired Genetrix, Inc., a Phoenix-based network of prenatal\n\nand cancer genetic testing laboratories, in May 1996.\n\nThe InSight(R) test, a faster cytogenetic test based on in situ\n\nhybridization of chromosome-specific DNA probes, was introduced by Genzyme\n\nGenetics in 1991. This technology permits identification of the most frequently\n\noccurring chromosomal abnormalities within 48 hours, as compared to the one to\n\nthree weeks required to perform classical cytogenetic testing (karyotyping). The\n\nInSight(R) analysis is provided in conjunction with a complete karyotype.\n\nGenzyme Genetics's cancer diagnostic services based on cytogenetics and a\n\nseries of supporting tests currently focus primarily on various forms of\n\nleukemias and lymphomas. Genzyme Genetics also provides testing for numerous\n\ngenetic diseases including, fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy,\n\nHuntington's disease, polycystic kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, and\n\nhemophilia.\n\n13\n\n16\n\nMASDA(SM) SERVICE. Accurate tests for detection of the genetic components\n\nof disease are likely to require the analysis of multiple genes as well as\n\nmultiple mutations within these genes. For example, defects in any one of at\n\nleast four genes can result in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, and in just\n\ntwo of those genes more than 100 mutations have been reported. There is,\n\ntherefore, a crucial need for methods of rapidly detecting mutations in genes of\n\nknown sequence. To meet this need, Genzyme Genetics developed its patented\n\nMultiplex Allele-Specific Diagnostic Assay (the \"MASDA(SM) Service\"), which can\n\nanalyze in a single assay up to 500 samples simultaneously for over 100 known\n\nmutations.\n\nTo use the MASDA(SM) Service, a mixture of hundreds of probes is\n\nconstructed with each probe specific to one mutation. Individual DNA samples\n\nfrom numerous patients are then placed in a specific location in an array and\n\nexposed to the probe mixture. Patient samples that contain at least one mutation\n\nwill be detected with a positive \"signal.\" By identifying which probe(s) bind to\n\nthe patient sample, the exact mutation(s) are revealed. Positive samples are\n\nalso treated to produce a visual banding pattern that is unique for each\n\nmutation. This pattern is automatically interpreted by computer analysis to\n\nprovide results.\n\nThe MASDA(SM) Service not only analyzes different patient samples with\n\ndifferent disease indications in a single assay, it also identifies multiple\n\nmutations in one or more genes in a single patient's DNA sample. In addition,\n\nonly those samples with a positive signal need to be tested further in the\n\nmutation identification step. Eliminating samples that lack mutations from\n\nfurther analysis produces considerable cost savings when compared to\n\nconventional testing methods in which each sample has to undergo extensive\n\nanalysis before a negative report can be confirmed.\n\nGenzyme Genetics is pursuing a number of commercialization strategies for\n\nthe MASDA(SM) Service. In February 1997, Genzyme Genetics launched a 70-mutation\n\nCF test. Previous CF tests could only identify 32 or fewer mutations, thereby\n\nproducing negative results for people with rare mutations. In addition, the\n\nMASDA(SM) Service is also being used to provide genetic profiling services for\n\nclinical trials being conducted by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nGenzyme Genetics has established a federally certified clinical trials\n\nlaboratory to support diagnostic assay development using the MASDA(SM) Service.\n\nOngoing oncology studies in this laboratory include studies of colorectal cancer\n\nwith Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and the University of California,\n\nSan Francisco and of hereditary breast cancer with the Dana Farber Cancer\n\nInstitute. In addition, the laboratory provides population segmentation services\n\nfor internal drug development programs and external customers. These studies are\n\ndesigned to identify genetic markers that might provide information about the\n\nseverity of a disease as well as the likelihood that a patient might respond\n\neither favorably or adversely to a therapy.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme Genetics maintains an active program aimed at\n\nidentifying and developing new technologies and methods of performing genetic\n\ntests and applying these methods to improve and expand its menu of testing\n\nservices. In its own research laboratories and in collaboration with others,\n\nGenzyme Genetics is developing additional platforms for complex mutational\n\nanalysis and conducts major research and development programs in such areas as\n\ngenomics and rare cell separation and analysis methods.\n\nThe MASDA(SM) Service is designed to detect known mutations. Genzyme\n\nGenetics is also developing related technology, called cleavage- and ligation\n\nassociated mutation specific sequencing or \"CLAMSS,\" to detect and identify\n\nunknown mutations. These techniques address situations where many different\n\nmutations in a gene give rise to a disease state, but where no single mutation\n\nis responsible for a significant percentage of disease.\n\nIn 1995, Genzyme Genetics, together with its collaborators, announced the\n\nfull identification of the PKD1 gene, which causes polycystic kidney disease, a\n\ncommon genetic disorder that leads to renal failure by middle age in most\n\naffected individuals. This group is also involved in the discovery of the gene\n\nfor the most common cause of inherited cardiac arrhythmia, long QT syndrome,\n\nalso known as \"sudden death syndrome.\"\n\nGenzyme Genetics also continues its efforts to develop methods and\n\nprocedures to isolate and genetically analyze fetal cells obtained from maternal\n\nblood samples. The program has demonstrated the feasibility of a separation\n\ntechnology involving the use of combinations of antibodies that bind selectively\n\nto specific cell types and has developed appropriate immobilization and\n\nanalytical methods. At this point, however, the process does not meet Genzyme\n\nGenetics consistency standards well enough to commercialize it as a diagnostic\n\ntest.\n\n14\n\n17\n\nFetal cells obtained from maternal blood serum could potentially be used in\n\nlieu of cells derived from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi for genetic\n\ntesting, thereby avoiding the risk associated with amniocentesis or CVS. Genzyme\n\nGenetics believes that successful development of techniques which permit\n\nprenatal genetic testing of samples obtained from mothers on a low risk basis,\n\nusing rapid low cost detection methods, can result in a substantial expansion of\n\nthe market for prenatal testing. Significant resources continue to be focused on\n\nthis research program.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS\n\nGenzyme Diagnostics is a primary supplier of diagnostic components\n\n(enzymes, substrates, antibodies and antigens), bulk reagents and devices to\n\nmanufacturers of clinical diagnostic reagents and kits as well as directly to\n\nclinical reference laboratories. It also manufactures and sells a broad line of\n\nantibody and antigen based ELISA test kits. In addition, Genzyme Diagnostics\n\ndistributes a broad product line of research products to academic, industrial\n\nand governmental laboratories for use in immunology and cell biology and has\n\ndeveloped manufacturing expertise in enzyme fermentation, purification, reagent\n\nformulation and immunoassay test development.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS PORTFOLIO\n\nProduct/Program Indication/Application Status\n\n- --------------- ---------------------- ------\n\nCardiovascular products -- Direct Clinical diagnostic testing Product sales\n\nLDL(TM), N-geneous(TM) HDL, ApoE Elisa\n\nand Lp(a) Cholesterol Tests\n\nDiagnostic enzymes, substrates and Raw materials for clinical chemistry Product sales\n\nantibodies and immunoassays for diagnostic\n\nmanufacturers\n\nOEM reagents and kits Immunodiagnostic and clinical Product sales\n\nchemistry kits for diagnostic\n\nmanufacturers\n\nResearch products Research in immunology and cell Product sales\n\nbiology, primarily for apoptosis\n\nand cytokines\n\nRapid tests OEM sales and end-user distribution Product sales\n\nfor pregnancy and infectious\n\ndisease tests\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR PRODUCTS. Genzyme Diagnostics sells devices and reagents for\n\nthe quantification of LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. In October 1996, Genzyme\n\nDiagnostics launched the N-geneous HDL(TM) cholesterol test in the U.S. The new\n\ntest, which is being distributed by Genzyme Diagnostics under a worldwide\n\nagreement with the manufacturer of the test, Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.,\n\nof Tokyo, measures how much high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is present in a\n\npatient's serum. Because the N-geneous HDL(TM) test can be conducted completely\n\non an automated clinical chemistry analyzer, it is simpler than other HDL\n\ncholesterol tests currently on the market, which require manual pretreatment of\n\npatient samples. The automation of HDL testing with the N-geneous(TM) test will\n\nprovide laboratories with significant operational benefits and enable them to\n\nimprove results by reducing the probability of error introduced by sample\n\nhandling and manual sample pretreatment. Genzyme Diagnostics estimates the U.S.\n\nmarket for the N-geneous HDL(TM) test to be between 50 and 100 million tests per\n\nyear and the global market at approximately 200 million tests per year. In\n\naddition to the U.S., Genzyme Diagnostics is the exclusive marketing partner\n\nfor the N-geneous HDL(TM) test in Europe and the rest of the world, with the\n\nexception of Asia, where Genzyme holds co-exclusive distribution rights.\n\nGenzyme Diagnostics has also developed and commercialized an in vitro\n\ndiagnostic test kit (the Direct LDL(TM) test kit) for the direct measurement of\n\nLDL cholesterol in blood samples. The correlation between elevated blood\n\ncholesterol levels and increased risk of coronary heart disease, one of the\n\nleading causes of death in the U.S., is well established. A high level of LDL\n\ncholesterol in the blood indicates an increased risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nPrior to the approval of the Direct LDL(TM) test kit, there was no routine\n\ndirect standardized test for measuring LDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol\n\nlevels were derived using several indirect measurements and estimates, each\n\ncontributing a potential source of error to the calculation. Genzyme\n\nDiagnostics is working to replace the Direct LDL(TM) test kit with a\n\nhomogeneous method similar to HDL.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERMEDIATES. Genzyme Diagnostics produces and sells critical\n\ncomponents such as diagnostic enzymes, substrates and reagents for use in\n\ndiagnostic kits used for blood analysis in clinical chemistry\n\n15\n\n18\n\nlaboratories. One primary area of emphasis is pancreatic function, where Genzyme\n\nDiagnostics provides enzymes, substrates, bulk reagents and patented\n\nmethodologies for amylase and lipase determination to diagnostic kit\n\nmanufacturers. Genzyme Diagnostics is also a primary supplier of cholesterol\n\nenzymes used in testing for coronary heart disease. Sales of its diagnostic\n\nintermediates are made to over 200 manufacturers and users of diagnostic kits\n\nworldwide through its own technical sales representatives in the U.S. and Europe\n\nand through distributors in Japan.\n\nELISA TEST KITS. Genzyme Diagnostics manufactures and sells a broad range\n\nof ELISA test kits for infectious disease and endocrinology determinations. In\n\naddition, it supplies monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies plus other\n\nimmunoassay raw materials to immunodiagnostic kit manufacturers. Patented\n\nContrast(TM) rapid tests for pregnancy, Strep A and infectious mononucleosis\n\ndetermination are also becoming key contributors to Genzyme Diagnostics's\n\nproduct portfolio.\n\nRESEARCH PRODUCTS. Genzyme Diagnostics research products consist of a\n\ncomprehensive line of cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, proteins and\n\ncytokine and apoptosis ELISA systems which play an integral role in activating\n\nand modulating the body's immune system. These research products are used\n\nprimarily to conduct research in the areas of immunology and cellular biology.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS\n\nGenzyme Pharmaceuticals develops, manufactures and sells a range of active\n\ndrug substances, pharmaceutical intermediates, synthetic phospholipids,\n\npeptides, biomolecules and chemicals to the pharmaceutical and health care\n\nindustries. These products utilize the division's capabilities in multi-step\n\norganic chemical synthesis, fermentation, enzymology and carbohydrate\n\ntechnology.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\nProduct/Program Indication/Application Status\n\n- --------------- ---------------------- ------\n\nMelaPure(TM) melatonin Dietary supplement Product sales\n\nClindamycin phosphate Treatment of serious infections Product sales\n\nHyaluronic acid Ophthalmic products & research Product sales\n\napplications\n\nActive drug substances and Production of oral, topical and Product sales\n\npharmaceutical intermediates parenteral drugs\n\nFine chemicals Production of pharmaceutical Product sales\n\nintermediates and electronic chemicals\n\nSynthetic phospholipids Drug delivery systems and Product sales\n\npharmaceutical components\n\nSynthetic peptides Production of final dosage form Product sales\n\ntherapeutics\n\nAmino acid derivatives Production of synthetic peptides Product sales\n\nMELAPURE(TM) MELATONIN. In 1995, melatonin, a synthetic human hormone\n\npresent in a variety of foods and marketed as a dietary supplement, became the\n\nlargest selling chemical product manufactured by Genzyme Pharmaceuticals.\n\nGenzyme Pharmaceuticals supplies bulk quantities of melatonin to manufacturers\n\nof final dosage form product and is marketing its MelaPure(TM) brand melatonin\n\noutside the U.S. in a finished dosage form product.\n\n16\n\n19\n\nAlthough total melatonin revenues in 1996 increased over 1995, sales declined\n\nmaterially during the second half of 1996 due to declining market demand.\n\nGenzyme Pharmaceuticals does not expect that melatonin sales will return to the\n\nlevels experienced during the first half of 1996 during 1997. Melatonin is\n\nregulated as a drug in many countries and, therefore, cannot be marketed without\n\nprior regulatory approval in those countries. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals plans to\n\nstart a clinical trial of MelaPure(TM) melatonin for a sleep disorder\n\nindication, which if successful will broaden the market opportunity for\n\nMelaPure(TM) as a regulated product.\n\nCLINDAMYCIN PHOSPHATE. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals currently produces and sells\n\nclindamycin phosphate, an off-patent antibiotic widely used by hospitals for the\n\ntreatment of infections. Clindamycin phosphate is sold to pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the Middle East through Genzyme\n\nPharmaceuticals' worldwide sales organization.\n\nHYALURONIC ACID. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals currently produces and sells bulk\n\nhyaluronic acid (HA) for a number of applications. Under an agreement with\n\nAlcon, Genzyme Pharmaceuticals supplies pharmaceutical grade HA powder to Alcon\n\nfor incorporation into Provisc(R), an HA-based ophthalmic surgical aid product,\n\nwhich Alcon introduced in 1994. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals also receives a royalty\n\nbased on Alcon's product sales. Hyaluronic acid is also sold to a number of\n\ncustomers for various research and development applications.\n\nACTIVE DRUG SUBSTANCES AND PHARMACEUTICAL INTERMEDIATES. Genzyme\n\nPharmaceuticals currently produces drug substances for leading ethical\n\npharmaceutical companies for formulation into a variety of dosage forms. It also\n\nsupplies various pharmaceutical intermediaries which are converted to active\n\ndrug substances by the customer.\n\nFINE CHEMICALS. Genzyme Pharmaceuticals has developed a range of high value\n\nfine chemicals and chiral intermediates based on its proprietary technology in\n\ncomplex organic chemistry. These products include various synthetic starting\n\nmaterials and liquid crystal chemicals for the electronics industry. It markets\n\nthese products through its own sales force directly to chemical and\n\npharmaceutical companies worldwide.\n\nSYNTHETIC PHOSPHOLIPIDS. Phospholipids are the major structural components\n\nof cell membranes. They are useful in drug delivery systems, emulsion\n\nformulations and as components of pharmaceutical products such as liposomes.\n\nGenzyme Pharmaceuticals has developed proprietary technology for the large scale\n\nmanufacture of synthetic phospholipids with high purity and consistency and\n\ncurrently produces and sells synthetic phospholipids to pharmaceutical and\n\nbiotechnology companies for use in the formulation and delivery of certain of\n\ntheir products.\n\nSYNTHETIC PEPTIDES AND AMINO ACID DERIVATIVES. Synthetic peptides are a\n\nclass of biologically active compounds comprised of chains of amino acids. Many\n\nof these compounds have applications as active drug compounds and are used by\n\nthe pharmaceutical industry in final dosage form preparations. Genzyme\n\nPharmaceuticals is a commercial scale GMP manufacturer of synthetic peptides for\n\nmany such applications. Amino acid derivatives are the materials used in the\n\nproduction of synthetic peptides. In addition to producing these materials for\n\nuse in its own peptide manufacturing processes, Genzyme Pharmaceuticals sells\n\namino acid derivatives to the pharmaceutical industry for use in the manufacture\n\nof peptides.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nGenzyme General is engaged in a segment of the human health care products\n\nindustry that is extremely competitive. Competitors in the U.S. and elsewhere\n\nare numerous and include major pharmaceutical, chemical, surgical device and\n\nbiotechnology companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than\n\nGenzyme. These companies may succeed in developing products that are more\n\neffective than any that have been or may be developed by Genzyme General and may\n\nalso prove to be more successful than Genzyme General in producing and marketing\n\ntheir products.\n\nEach of Genzyme General's business units faces different competitive\n\nchallenges:\n\nSPECIALTY THERAPEUTICS\n\n17\n\n20\n\nCEREDASE(R) ENZYME AND CEREZYME(R) ENZYME. Although Genzyme General is not\n\naware of any current effective alternative to its products for the treatment for\n\nGaucher disease (Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme), competition\n\npotentially could come from other protein replacement therapies or gene therapy.\n\nGenzyme General believes that its proprietary production techniques, exclusive\n\nraw material source for Ceredase(R) enzyme and, to a certain extent, the orphan\n\ndrug status of its products give it a number of advantages over potential\n\ncompetitors using protein replacement therapy for the treatment of Gaucher\n\ndisease. Gene therapy techniques are still in experimental stages. Genzyme\n\nGeneral believes that the principal factors that will affect competition for\n\nCeredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme will be clinical effectiveness and\n\nabsence of adverse side effects. One company is attempting to develop an\n\nalternative form of recombinant GCR by producing the enzyme in insect cells and\n\nmodifying it by applying a coating of polyethylene glycol.\n\nCF. There are a number of organizations, both academic and commercial,\n\nengaged in developing therapies to treat either the symptoms of CF or the cause\n\nof the disease. Several groups are developing gene therapy approaches to the\n\ndisease and also have received FDA and RAC approval to initiate limited human\n\nstudies of CF gene therapy. In addition, other organizations are investigating\n\npharmacological and biological agents that would treat CF. One such product,\n\nPulmozyme(R), which was developed by Genentech, Inc., currently is on the\n\nmarket. These groups may succeed in developing gene therapy products before\n\nGenzyme General, in obtaining patent protection that may effectively block\n\nGenzyme General from commercializing its gene therapy products or in developing\n\nother drug therapies that relieve the symptoms of CF and, thus, compete with\n\nproducts under development by Genzyme General.\n\nCANCER. Competition in the field of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics is\n\nintense. Many competitors in this field have greater financial and human\n\nresources, more experience in research, preclinical and clinical development,\n\nsuperior expertise in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive\n\nproduction and marketing infrastructure than Genzyme General. Genzyme General is\n\naware of clinical trials sponsored by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer relating to gene\n\ntherapy for cancer and expects that other large companies will be initiating\n\ngene therapy clinical trials in the near future. Genzyme General also relies on\n\nits collaborators for support in some of its cancer research and development\n\nprograms and intends to rely on these partners for preclinical evaluation and\n\nclinical development of its potential products and services. Certain of its\n\ncollaborators are conducting multiple product development programs in fields\n\nsimilar to those that are the subject of the partner's alliance with Genzyme\n\nGeneral. For instance, the NCI, with whom Genzyme General is collaborating\n\nregarding the use of adenoviral vectors incorporating the MART1 and gp100 tumor\n\nantigen genes for the treatment of melanoma, is currently working with others on\n\nnon-adenoviral vector delivery systems for these antigens. Any product candidate\n\nof Genzyme General, therefore, may be subject to competition with a potential\n\nproduct under development by a third party, including Genzyme General's\n\ncollaborators.\n\nSURGICAL PRODUCTS\n\nSEPRA PRODUCTS. Genzyme General believes that its expertise in developing\n\nproprietary fermentation processes and its access to proprietary strains of\n\nmicro-organisms used in its HA production process will give it a competitive\n\nadvantage in the marketing of the Sepra Products. Its anti-adhesion products\n\nmay face significant competition, however, from other HA-based products, from\n\nnon-HA-based products and from changes in surgical techniques that would obviate\n\nthe use of HA. Genzyme General believes that the principal factor that will\n\naffect competition in this area is acceptance of the product by surgeons, which\n\ndepends, in large part, upon product performance, safety and price.\n\nDSP. DSP competes in three medical device categories: cardiovascular fluid\n\nmanagement systems, surgical closure systems and surgical instruments. In each\n\nof these categories, DSP's principal methods of competing are continued\n\ninnovative product development, the performance and breadth of its product\n\nlines, brand name recognition, sales force training and educational services,\n\nincluding sponsorship of training programs in advanced surgical techniques.\n\nDSP's key product in the cardiovascular fluid management category is the\n\nPleur-evac(R) chest drainage product. DSP believes that it leads the chest\n\ndrainage category with a majority share and that this position is sustainable\n\ndue to a broad product line possessing patented features and brand name\n\nrecognition. The surgical closure category is dominated by Ethicon, a subsidiary\n\nof Johnson & Johnson, and Sherwood, a division of American Home Products\n\nCorporation. DSP had focused on the cardiovascular suture market within this\n\ncategory and believes that favorable demographics such as the aging population\n\nand lengthening life expectancies will provide continued growth in this market.\n\nCompetition within the surgical instruments category varies by segment, such as\n\ncardiovascular, endoscopic and plastic surgery instruments, with no one company\n\ndominating the entire category. Unique features and product innovation within\n\nits surgical instruments line, such as the recently launched EndoCABG(TM)\n\nSystem, have allowed DSP to compete effectively across this category and to hold\n\na majority share of the cardiovascular punch segment.\n\n18\n\n21\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The U.S. market for prenatal cytogenetic and\n\nbiochemical testing is divided among approximately 500 laboratories, many of\n\nwhich offer both types of testing. Of this total group, less than 20\n\nlaboratories market their services nationally. Genzyme Genetics believes that\n\nthe industry as a whole is still quite fragmented, with the top 20 laboratories\n\naccounting for approximately 50% of market revenues, and with no individual\n\ncompany, including Genzyme Genetics, accounting for more than 18% of the total.\n\nCompetitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business generally\n\ninclude reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing,\n\nconvenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting\n\nand timeliness of delivery of completed reports. Genzyme Genetics believes that\n\nits research and development program, which has enabled it to develop and\n\nintroduce testing services based on new technology, and its active sales and\n\nmarketing force have played significant roles in the rapid growth of its genetic\n\ndiagnostics services business. In addition to Genzyme Genetics, several\n\ncompanies and academic groups are attempting to develop fetal cell separation\n\ntechniques. Genzyme Genetics believes that its combination of separation and\n\nanalytical technologies will give it a competitive advantage.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS. Genzyme Diagnostics acts as a primary supplier of\n\nenzymes and substrates, and generally does not compete with its customers in the\n\nsale of complete diagnostic kits. This philosophy enables Genzyme Diagnostics to\n\nmaintain unique relationships with major diagnostic kit manufacturers and to\n\nengage with them in development efforts to produce new or improved kits. The\n\nmarket in the diagnostic products industry is mature and competition is based on\n\nprice, reliability of supply and the purity and specific activity of products.\n\nPHARMACEUTICALS. Competition in the pharmaceuticals business is affected\n\nprimarily by production efficiency, product quality and price. Genzyme\n\nPharmaceuticals believes that its success in this market is due to its technical\n\nexpertise and selection of high-value, small volume products that minimize\n\ndirect competition with larger production operations in commodity products.\n\nPATENTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY\n\nGenzyme General pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the\n\nU.S. and in selected foreign countries for subject matter considered patentable\n\nand important to its business. In addition, a portion of Genzyme's proprietary\n\nposition is based upon patents that Genzyme has licensed from others. These\n\nlicense agreements generally require Genzyme to pay royalties upon\n\ncommercialization of products covered by the licensed technology. In general,\n\npatents issued in the U.S. are effective for a period of seventeen years from\n\ndate of issue, although the GATT legislation changes this to twenty years from\n\nthe filing date for applications filed after June 8, 1995. The duration of\n\nforeign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law. Genzyme General\n\nalso relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological\n\ninnovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in its product areas.\n\nGenzyme's employees, consultants and corporate partners who have access to its\n\nproprietary information have signed confidentiality agreements. Genzyme\n\nGeneral's patent position and proprietary technology are subject to certain\n\nrisks and uncertainties. See \"Factors Affecting Future Operating\n\nResults--Uncertainty Regarding Patents and Protection of Proprietary Technology\"\n\nunder Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\n\nResults of Operations.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nGovernmental regulation, in the U.S. and other countries, is a significant\n\nfactor in the production and marketing of many of Genzyme General's products and\n\nin its ongoing research and development activities.\n\nFDA REGULATION. In the U.S., products that do not achieve their principal\n\nintended purpose through chemical action within or on the body and which are not\n\ndependent upon being metabolized by the patient's body in order to be effective\n\nare classified by the FDA as \"devices\" while other products are classified as\n\n\"drugs\" or \"biologics.\" Ceredase(R) enzyme and Cerezyme(R) enzyme are regulated\n\nin the U.S. as drugs, as are Thyrogen(R) hormone, Prolactin and Chitinase. Its\n\ngene therapy products, [alpha]-Gal and ATIII are regulated as biologics. The\n\nSepra Products and DSP's products are regulated as devices. The Direct LDL(TM)\n\nand N-geneous(TM) HDL cholesterol tests are classified as an in vitro diagnostic\n\ndevices.\n\nThe activities required before drugs or biologics may be marketed in the\n\nU.S. include (i) preclinical laboratory tests, in vitro and in vivo preclinical\n\nstudies and formulation and stability studies, (ii) the submission to the FDA\n\nand\n\n19\n\n22\n\napproval of an application for human clinical testing (an \"IND\"), (iii) adequate\n\nand well controlled human clinical trials to prove the safety and effectiveness\n\nof the drug or biologic, (iv) the submission of a New Drug Application (\"NDA\")\n\nfor a drug or a Product License Application (\"PLA\") for a biologic or a BLA for\n\nbiologics identified by the FDA as \"Specified Biologics\" and (v) the approval\n\nby the FDA of the NDA, BLA or PLA.\n\nIn addition to product approval, the manufacturer of the product may have\n\nto obtain an establishment license (for a biologic that is not considered well\n\ncharacterized) or a pre-approval Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\") inspection\n\n(for a drug or well-characterized biologic) from the FDA. Since any license\n\ngranted by the FDA is both site and process specific, any material change by a\n\ncompany in the manufacturing process, equipment or location necessitates\n\nadditional FDA review and approval.\n\nProducts that are classified as devices also require FDA approval prior to\n\nmarketing. Devices are classified as Class I, II or III, depending upon the\n\ninformation available to assure their safety and effectiveness. In general,\n\nClass I and Class II devices are devices whose safety and effectiveness can\n\nreasonably be assured through general or specific controls, respectively. Class\n\nIII devices are life sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or new\n\ndevices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally\n\nmarketed devices. The steps required for approval of a Class III device include\n\n(i) preclinical laboratory tests and in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies,\n\n(ii) the submission to the FDA and approval of an investigational device\n\nexemption (an \"IDE\") to allow initiation of clinical testing, (iii) human\n\nclinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness of the device, (iv) the\n\nsubmission of a PMA and (v) the approval by the FDA of the PMA. Typically,\n\nclinical testing of devices involves initial testing to evaluate safety and\n\nfeasibility and expanded trials to collect sufficient data to prove safety and\n\neffectiveness. In addition, the procedures and the facilities used to\n\nmanufacture the device are subject to review and approval by the FDA.\n\nA device (other than a Class III device) which is proved to be\n\nsubstantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to May 28, 1976, when\n\ngovernment regulations for devices were first introduced, can be marketed after\n\napproval of a 510(k) application rather than the filing of an IDE and a PMA. The\n\n510(k) application must contain a description of the device, its methods of\n\nmanufacture and quality control procedures and the results of testing to\n\ndemonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to the device already\n\nmarketed.\n\nThe time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to\n\nobtain FDA approval can far exceed the time and expense of the research and\n\ndevelopment initially required to create the product. Even after initial FDA\n\napproval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide\n\nadditional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a\n\ntreatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In\n\naddition, use of these products during testing and after marketing approval has\n\nbeen obtained could reveal side effects which, if serious, could delay, impede\n\nor prevent marketing approval, limit uses, force a recall of the product or\n\nexpose Genzyme General to product liability claims.\n\nREGULATION OUTSIDE THE U.S.. For marketing outside the U.S., Genzyme\n\nGeneral is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical\n\ntesting and marketing approval for its products. These requirements vary by\n\njurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S. and may necessitate additional\n\npre-clinical or clinical testing whether or not FDA approval has been obtained.\n\nGenerally, Genzyme General's initial focus for obtaining marketing app"
