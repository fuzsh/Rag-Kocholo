A new condition monitoring method for a wind turbine gearbox using temperature trend analysis is proposed. Autoassociative Kernel Regression (AAKR is used to construct the normal behavior model of the gearbox temperature. With a proper construction of the memory matrix, the AAKR model can cover the normal working space for the gearbox. When the gearbox has an incipient failure, the residuals between AAKR model estimates and the measurement temperature will become significant. A moving window statistical method is used to detect the changes of the residual mean value and standard deviation in a timely manner. When one of these parameters exceeds predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is flagged. In order to simulate the gearbox fault, manual temperature drift is added to the initial Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitions (SCADA data. Analysis of simulated gearbox failures shows that the new condition monitoring method is effective.\n\nTPÃ Akadeemilise Raamatukogu ajaloolised kogud rahvusvahelistes infoallikates / Tiiu Reimo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nReimo, Tiiu, 1953-\n\n2005-01-01\n\nLk. 99 mainitud : Urve LÃµhmus, Voldemar Miller, Tiiu Reimo; lk. 100 : Voldemar Miller, Kyra Robert; lk. 102 : Tiiu Reimo, Medea Jerser, Toomas Raudam; lk. 103 : Antti Oviir, Aita JÃµulu; lk. 104 : Tiiu Reimo, Marita Paas, Mati Merioja, Tiiu Pukk, Eve Roosileht\n\nMida arvavad koolist ÃµppejÃµud vÃ¤ljastpoolt akadeemiat? / Tiiu Reimo, Kaie Holm, Malle Ermel, Tiiu Valm\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTLÃ Infoteaduste Instituudi direktori Tiiu Reimo, Tallinna Keskraamatukogu direktori Kaie Holmi, Tartu Ãlikooli Raamatukogu direktori kt Malle Ermeli ja kirjastuse TEA toimetuse juhataja Tiiu Valmi arvamused infoteaduse ja raamatukogunduse alase Ãµppe korraldusest Viljandi Kultuuriakadeemias\n\nTallinnas Narva mnt. 7 asuva kohviku Zebra sisekujundus / Tiiu Truus, Tiiu Prisko, Mati Veermets...[jt.\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2006-01-01\n\npÃµhiplaan, 11 vÃ¤rv. vaadet; fotod: Kalle Veesaar; laes olevate dekoratiivsete lippude graafiline kujundus on Tiiu Priskolt ja Mati Veermetsalt, tualettruumi looduskivist valamu ja pÃµrandavaasi autor on Kaido Kivi\n\nEFFE 2001 konverents Tallinnas / Tiiu Kuurme\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKuurme, Tiiu, 1953-\n\n2001-01-01\n\n24.- 27. maini 2001 toimub Tallinnas EFFE 2001 (European Forum for Freedom in Education) konverents \"Haridus tÃ¤nases kodanikuÃ¼hiskonnas\".

The poloidal field strength is determined from the analysis of circular polarization of a HeII 4686A spectral lines emitted from a plasma. The polarization modulation rate, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength along a line of sight, is estimated as a ratio of the difference between the left-hand circular polarized line intensity and right-hand one to the sum of them. A newly developed fast scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer allows us to improve a time resolution up to 1.5 ms. The poloidal magnetic field profile in He-doped deuterium plasmas of JIPP T-IIU has been successfully obtained with this polarimeter system.

The European Space Agency (ESA) Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS) products cover Greenland, Iceland, Continental Europe and North Africa represent an archive of over 600,000 processed Level 1 (L1) scenes that will accompany around 1 million ESA Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) products already available. ESA began acquiring MSS data in 1975 and it is well known that this dataset can be degraded due to missing data and a loss in accuracy. For these reasons, the content of the product format has been reviewed and the ESA Landsat processing baseline significantly updated to ensure products are fit for user purposes. This paper presents the new MSS product format including the updated metadata parameters for error traceability, and the specification of the Quality Assurance Band (BQA) engineered to allow the best pixel selection and also the application of image restoration techniques. This paper also discusses major improvements applied to the radiometric and geometric processing. For the benefits of the community, ESA is now able to maximize the number of L1 MSS products that can potentially be generated from the raw Level 0 (L0) data and ensure the highest possible data quality is reached. Also, by improving product format, processing and adding a pixel based quality band, the MSS archive becomes interoperable with recently reprocessed Landsat data and that from live missions by way of assuring product quality on a pixel basis.\n\nEcology and sampling techniques of an understudied subterranean habitat: the Milieu Souterrain Superficiel (MSS).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMammola, Stefano; Giachino, Pier Mauro; Piano, Elena; Jones, Alexandra; Barberis, Marcel; Badino, Giovanni; Isaia, Marco\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe term Milieu Souterrain Superficiel (MSS) has been used since the early 1980s in subterranean biology to categorize an array of different hypogean habitats. In general terms, a MSS habitat represents the underground network of empty air-filled voids and cracks developing within multiple layers of rock fragments. Its origins can be diverse and is generally covered by topsoil. The MSS habitat is often connected both with the deep hypogean domain-caves and deep rock cracks-and the superficial soil horizon. A MSS is usually characterized by peculiar microclimatic conditions, and it can harbor specialized hypogean, endogean, and surface-dwelling species. In light of the many interpretations given by different authors, we reviewed 235 papers regarding the MSS in order to provide a state-of-the-art description of these habitats and facilitate their study. We have briefly described the different types of MSS mentioned in the scientific literature (alluvial, bedrock, colluvial, volcanic, and other types) and synthesized the advances in the study of the physical and ecological factors affecting this habitat-i.e., microclimate, energy flows, animal communities, and trophic interactions. We finally described and reviewed the available sampling methods used to investigate MSS fauna.\n\nTwo Dimensional Array of Piezoresistive Nanomechanical Membrane-Type Surface Stress Sensor (MSS with Improved Sensitivity\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNico F. de Rooij\n\n2012-11-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a new generation of piezoresistive nanomechanical Membrane-type Surface stress Sensor (MSS chips, which consist of a two dimensional array of MSS on a single chip. The implementation of several optimization techniques in the design and microfabrication improved the piezoresistive sensitivity by 3~4 times compared to the first generation MSS chip, resulting in a sensitivity about ~100 times better than a standard cantilever-type sensor and a few times better than optical read-out methods in terms of experimental signal-to-noise ratio. Since the integrated piezoresistive read-out of the MSS can meet practical requirements, such as compactness and not requiring bulky and expensive peripheral devices, the MSS is a promising transducer for nanomechanical sensing in the rapidly growing application fields in medicine, biology, security, and the environment. Specifically, its system compactness due to the integrated piezoresistive sensing makes the MSS concept attractive for the instruments used in mobile applications. In addition, the MSS can operate in opaque liquids, such as blood, where optical read-out techniques cannot be applied.\n\nMis saab eesti gÃ¼mnaasiumist? / Igor GarÅ¡nek, Linnar PriimÃ¤gi, Tiiu Purdelo ; vestluse pani kirja Raivo Juurak\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nGarÅ¡nek, Igor, 1958-\n\n2008-01-01\n\nRiigikirjandi drillimise asemel on vaja hakata gÃ¼mnaasiumis sÃ¼vendatult Ãµppima valikaineid, leiavad TLÃ ÃµppejÃµud Linnar PriimÃ¤gi, Eesti Kunstiakadeemia ÃµppejÃµud Igor GarÅ¡nek ja SA ÃiguskolledÅ¾i asutaja Tiiu Purdelo\n\nFast cooling phenomena with ice pellet injection in the JIPP T-IIU Tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSakamoto, M.; Sato, K.N.; Ogawa, Y.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nIce pellet injection experiments were carried out in the JIPP T-IIU Tokamak in order to study thermal (cooling) transport just after injection. The cut-off problem of ECE signals due to the rise in density has been resolved by careful measurements of the temperature profile at a high time resolution (Ît = 2Î¼s) during its decay phase. The phenomenon of ultra-fast cooling (so-called pre-cooling) has been identified using the two different methods of ECE and soft X-ray (SXR) measurements. In the outer region (r > r q=1 ) of the plasma the cooling propagation velocity is comparable to or slightly greater than the pellet velocity, while in the central region (r q=1 ) the propagation velocity is significantly greater than the pellet velocity. Ice pellets were injected into various kinds of JIPP T-IIU plasmas, the current and sawtooth phase of which had different values, including a no-sawtooth plasma. The existence of the q = 1 surface and arrival of a pellet near the q = 1 surface have turned out to be necessary conditions for pre-cooling, and even just after the sawtooth crash the pre-cooling starts around the q = 1 surface, not at the plasma center. Simultaneous measurements of electron temperature and density profiles indicate that the central temperature always decreases before the central density increases. Some anomalous transport might be induced by pellet injection at the central region.

With in-memory technology, a new IT enabler promises to support managers by benefits ranging from reducing time for MSS data entry and analysis to complete new topics of analysis. Hence, the present situation is favorable for an MSS redesign applying in-memory apps. Such apps are field-tested and ready-to-use, but from a business perspective they lack impact.

The DTU10MSS is currently the only available MSS which has true global coverage and hence is suitable for referencing when Cryosat-2 data are used in the Arctic....... The DTU10MSS generally has a vertical accuracy better than 10 cm in most areas of the world confirmed by extensive comparison with GPS leveled tide gauges around Britain and Norway. Finally the first comparisons with Cryosat-2 data are presented. The DTU10MSS is valuable for Cryosat-2 due to its true...\n\nSPOT: How good for geology?

The SPOT imagery offers many advantages, filling the gap between remote sensing from space and aerial photography. The best results by visual interpretation are obtained in combining SPOT for the required details with LANDSAT for the synoptic veiw. Further improvements are expected from the use of SPOT stereo-pairs.\n\n[Valitsusliidus olevad Reformierakond ning Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit on kavandatava koolireformi suhtes eri meelt] / Mailis Reps, Tiiu Kuurme, Karin KÃ¼tt\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nReps, Mailis, 1975-\n\n2010-01-01\n\nReformierakonna ettepaneku kohta jÃ¤tta omavalitsustele Ãµiguse otsustada, kas gÃ¼mnaasium ja pÃµhikool lahutatakse vÃµi jÃ¤tkatakse Ã¼hendkooliga avaldavad arvamust riigikogu liige Mailis Reps, Tallinna Ãlikooli dotsent Tiiu Kuurme ja Rannu keskkooli direktor Karin KÃ¼tt\n\nThe DTU13 MSS (Mean Sea Surface) and MDT (Mean Dynamic Topography) from 20 Years of Satellite Altimetry\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAndersen, Ole Baltazar; Knudsen, Per; Stenseng, Lars\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe DTU13MSS is the latest release of the global high resolution mean sea surface (MSS) from DTU Space.

The preceding ELM (pre-ELM) appears just prior to the L-H transition. This type of transition is usually observed in H-modes of JIPP T-IIU. The L-H transition without the pre-ELM is triggered only in the case when a sufficiently large rapid current ramp down is emploied. In H-modes with constant q(a)â¼3.5-4.5, coherent magnetic oscillations with m=3/n=1 destabilized during L-phase are further enhanced at the pre-ELM, and suppressed suddenly at the transition. This mode is situated in the region of the transport barrier. Propagation frequency of the m=3/n=1 mode, which may be affected by plasma mass rotation, rises appreciably (by â¼ 10 %) during H-phase with frequent ELMs, but remains unchanged for at least 200 Î¼s after the transition. Behaviours of the m=3/n=1 and m=2/n=1 modes are well explained by quasi-linear resistive tearing mode analysis for modelled toroidal current density profiles slightly detached from the limiter. These experimental results suggest that the transition is controlled by the change of a magnetic field structure relating to the modification of a toroidal current density profile near the edge. The possibility for the development of edge radial electric field as a consequence of the transition is discussed.

Jr.; Sharitz, R.R.; Christensen, E.J.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nNontidal wetlands in a portion of the Savannah River swamp forest affected by reactor cooling water discharges were mapped using March 31, 1981 and April 29, 1985 high-resolution aircraft multispectral scanner (MSS) data. Due to the inherent distortion in the aircraft MSS data and the complex spectral characteristics of the wetland vegetation, it was necessary to implement multiple techniques in the registration and classification of the MSS imagery of the Pen Branch Delta on each date. In particular, it was necessary to use a piecewise-linear registration process over relatively small regions to perform image-to-image registration. When performing unsupervised classification, an iterative ''cluster busting'' technique was used, which simplified the cluster labeling process. These procedures allowed important wetland vegetation categories to be identified on each date. The multiple-date classification maps were then evaluated using a post-classification comparison technique yielding change classes that were of value in determining the extent of inland wetland change in this region\n\nThe DTU15 MSS (Mean Sea Surface) and DTU15LAT (Lowest Astronomical Tide) reference surface\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAndersen, Ole Baltazar; Stenseng, Lars; Piccioni, Gaia\n\nin the Arctic Ocean for DTU10MSS and DTU13MSS.A new reference surface for off-shore vertical referencing is introduced.

An EASY5 version of the TMI plant two loop approximation with primary coolant flow recirculation through a failed pump was selected for demonstration purposes. The project entailed replacing the 1967 ASME steam properties in SPANC with the simplified MSS functions. The MSS component models were then recast into equivalent steady state models compatible with the SPANC executive system. A special input routine was written to modify the MSS data to the SPANC data format. The accuracy of the obtained initial values was approximately four significant figures, sufficient to converge on the EASY5 steady state algorithms. Convergence is relatively insensitive to the initial guess in SPANC and are obtained at a computer cost of approximately two minutes on the UNIVAC 1100/60. Since plant configuration is established by data input in SPANC, it can easily be altered to provide initial values for an MMS simulation of all TMI type plants\n\nApplication of MSS-neutron spin echo spectrometer to pulsed neutron sources\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTasaki, S.; Ebisawa, T.; Hino, M.; Kawai, T.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA multilayer spin splitter (MSS) is a neutron device that gives phase difference between field-parallel and -antiparallel spin component of a superposing state. Since the phase difference is equivalent to the Larmor precession angle, MSS enables us to construct a new type of neutron spin echo (NSE) spectrometer. The new NSE spectrometer has its properties that 1. since the phase shift is neutron flight path length, the spectrometer can be drastically small, 2. the neutron spin echo time is proportional to the neutron wavelength.

D.; Valdes, J.; Valenzuela, C.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nLANDSAT-4 thematic mapper (TM) and multispectral scanner (MSS) data were analyzed to obtain information on data quality and information content. Geometric evaluations were performed to test band-to-band registration accuracy. Thematic mapper overall system resolution was evaluated using scene objects which demonstrated sharp high contrast edge responses. Radiometric evaluation included detector relative calibration, effects of resampling, and coherent noise effects. Information content evaluation was carried out using clustering, principal components, transformed divergence separability measure, and supervised classifiers on test data. A detailed spectral class analysis (multispectral classification) was carried out to compare the information content of the MSS and TM for a large number of scene classes. A temperature-mapping experiment was carried out for a cooling pond to test the quality of thermal-band calibration. Overall TM data quality is very good. The MSS data are noisier than previous LANDSAT results.\n\nAirborne MSS data processing for multichannel SWIR sensor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nUrai, Minoru; Yamaguchi, Yasushi\n\n1988-05-17\n\nThis paper describes the specification of an airborne multi-channel spectrum scanner (MSS) and data processing. MSS has 13 channels of frequencies in the visible - heat infrared region. The channels 1 - 3 correspond to a visible image, the channels 4, 5 to the absorption bands of iron oxides, the channels 6 - 9 (2.2 (m)m band) to the absorption bands of O-H group and carbonates, and the channels 10 - 13 to absorption bands in the heat infrared region. By the least squares residual (LSR) method, a mineral having an absorption band of 2.2 (m)m was further examined. As a result, the LSR image displayed an orange-colored portion. This portion was identified to correspond to epidote. Silica, which has an absorption band of 8 - 10 (m)m in the heat infrared region, was displayed in blue color. A high frequency resolution sensor has a great potential for discrimination and identification of minerals.

A new technique for an ice pellet injection system with controllability of injection angle has been developed and installed to the JIPP T-IIU tokamak in order to vary deposition profile of ice pellets within a plasma. Injection angle can be varied easily and successfully during an interval of two plasma shots in the course of an experiment, so that one can carry out various basic experiments by varying the pellet deposition profile. The injection angle has been varied poloidally from -6 to 6 degree by changing the angle of the last stage drift tube. This situation makes possible for pellets to aim at from about r = -2a/3 to r = 2a/3 of the plasma. From two dimensional observations by CCD cameras, details of the pellet ablation structures with various injection angles have been studied, and a couple of interesting phenomena have been found. In the case of an injection angle (Î¸) larger than a certain value (Î¸ â¥ 4 o ), a pellet penetrates straightly through the plasma with a trace of straight ablation cloud, which has been expected from usual theoretical consideration. On the other hand, a long helical tail of ablation light has been observed in the case of the angle smaller than the certain value (Î¸ â¤ 4 o ).

Here a new Mean Sea Surface DTU10MSS is presented with a vertical accuracy better than 10 cm...... in most areas of the world confirmed by extensive comparison with GPS leveled tide gauges around Britain and Norway. It is proposed that this model is used as a global vertical reference. This paper briefly outlines the update of the previous DTU model to DTU10MSS and presents comparisons on GPS positions...\n\nForest cover of North America in the 1970s mapped using Landsat MSS data\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFeng, M.; Sexton, J. O.; Channan, S.; Townshend, J. R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe distribution and changes in Earth's forests impact hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy fluxes, as well as ecosystems' capacity to support biodiversity and human economies. Long-term records of forest cover are needed across a broad range of investigation, including climate and carbon-cycle modeling, hydrological studies, habitat analyzes, biological conservation, and land-use planning. Satellite-based observations enable mapping and monitoring of forests at ecologically and economically relevant resolutions and continental or even global extents. Following early forest-mapping efforts using coarser resolution remote sensing data such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), forests have been mapped regionally at developed by the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) as reference, we developed an automated approach to detect forests using MSS data by leveraging the multispectral and phenological characteristics of forests observed in MSS time-series. The forest-cover map is produced with layers representing the year of observation, detection of forest-cover change relative to 1990, and the uncertainty of forest-cover and -change layers. The approach has been implemented with open-source libraries to facilitate processing large volumes of Landsat MSS images on high-performance computing machines. As the first result of our global mapping effort, we present the forest cover for North America. More than 25,000 Landsat MSS scenes were processed to provide a 120-meter resolution forest cover for North America, which will be made publicly available on the GLCF website (http://www.landcover.org).\n\nIdentification of unique interactions between the flexible linker and the RecA-like domains of DEAD-box helicase Mss116\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang, Yuan; Palla, MirkÃ³; Liao, Jung-Chi; Sun, Andrew\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDEAD-box RNA helicases are ATP-dependent proteins implicated in nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism. The yeast DEAD-box helicase Mss116 is unique in its functions of splicing group I and group II introns and activating mRNA translation, but the structural understanding of why it performs these unique functions remains unclear. Here we used sequence analysis and molecular dynamics simulation to identify residues in the flexible linker specific for yeast Mss116, potentially associated with its unique functions. We first identified residues that are 100% conserved in Mss116 of different species of the Saccharomycetaceae family. The amino acids of these conserved residues were then compared with the amino acids of the corresponding residue positions of other RNA helicases to identify residues that have distinct amino acids from other DEAD-box proteins. Four residues in the flexible linker, i.e. N334, E335, P336 and H339, are conserved and Mss116-specific. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for the wild-type Mss116 structure and mutant models to examine mutational effects of the linker on the conformational equilibrium. Relatively short MD simulation runs (within 20 ns) were enough for us to observe mutational effects, suggesting serious structural perturbations by these mutations. The mutation of E335 depletes the interactions between E335 and K95 in domain 1. The interactions between N334/P336 and N496/I497 of domain 2 are also abolished by mutation. Our results suggest that tight interactions between the Mss116-specific flexible linker and the two RecA-like domains may be mechanically required to crimp RNA for the unique RNA processes of yeast Mss116.

It gives some background on the motivation for this project and describes the expected benefit to the Cassini program. It then introduces the two tasks that I worked on - an automatic system auditing tool and a series of corrections to the Cassini Sequence Generator (SEQ_GEN) - and the specific objectives these tasks were to accomplish. Next, it details the approach I took to meet these objectives and the results of this approach, followed by a discussion of how the outcome of the project compares with my initial expectations.

The Brazilian state was stratified into forest and nonforest. A list sampling procedure was used in the forest stratum to select Landsat MSS scenes for processing based on estimates of fire activity in the scenes. Fire activity in 1984 was estimated using AVHRR-LAC thermal data. State-wide estimates of forest conversion indicate that between 1981 and 1984, 353,966 ha + or - 77,000 ha (0.4 percent of the state area) were converted per year. No evidence of reforestation was found in this digital sample. The relationship between forest clearing rate (based on MSS-TM analysis) and fire activity (estimated using AVHRR data) was noisy (R-squared = 0.41). The results suggest that AVHRR data may be put to better use as a stratification tool than as a subsidiary variable in list sampling.\n\nFeedback control of plasma equilibrium with control system aided by personal computer on the JIPP T-IIU tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTsuzuki, T.; Toi, K.; Matsuura, K.\n\n1991-04-01\n\nA feedback control system aided by a personal computer is developed to maintain plasma position on the required position in the JIPP T-IIU tokamak. The personal computer enables to adjust various control parameters easily. In this control system, a control demand for driving the power supply of feedback controlled vertical field coils is composed to be proportional to a total plasma current. This system has been successfully employed throughout the discharge where the plasma current substantially changes from zero to hundreds of kiloamperes, because the feedback control can be done, being independent of the plasma current. The analysis of this feedback control system taken into account of digital sampling agrees well with the experimental results.

Extensive research is ongoing to decipher the underlying genetic patterns with the hope to improve early cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this direction, the recent progress in next generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized the field of cancer genomics. However, one caveat of these studies remains the large amount of genetic variations identified and their interpretation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present the first work on whole exome NGS of primary colon cancers. We performed 454 whole exome pyrosequencing of tumor as well as adjacent not affected normal colonic tissue from microsatellite stable (MSS and microsatellite instable (MSI colon cancer patients and identified more than 50,000 small nucleotide variations for each tissue. According to predictions based on MSS and MSI pathomechanisms we identified eight times more somatic non-synonymous variations in MSI cancers than in MSS and we were able to reproduce the result in four additional CRCs. Our bioinformatics filtering approach narrowed down the rate of most significant mutations to 359 for MSI and 45 for MSS CRCs with predicted altered protein functions. In both CRCs, MSI and MSS, we found somatic mutations in the intracellular kinase domain of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A, BMPR1A, a gene where so far germline mutations are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome, and show that the mutations functionally impair the protein function. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that with deep sequencing of tumor exomes one may be able to predict the microsatellite status of CRC and in addition identify potentially clinically relevant mutations.\n\nUma biblioteca de pontos de controle para imagens MSS Landsat\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFernando Augusto Mitsuo Ii\n\n1985-01-01\n\nO objetivo deste trabalho e desenvolver um sistema para criacao, manutencao e gerenciamento de uma biblioteca de pontos de controle para imagens MSS Landsat.

The ADC is featured with improved switch by using the body effect to improve its conduction performance. A scaling down strategy is proposed to get more efficiency in the OTAs layout design. Implemented in a 0.18-Î¼m CMOS technology, the ADC's prototype occupied an area of 2.05 Ã 1.83 mm 2 . With a sampling rate of 120-MS/s and an input of 4.9 MHz, the ADC achieves a spurious-free-dynamic range of 74.32 dB and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 55.34 dB, while consuming 220-mW/channel at 3-V supply.

Without an op-amp, an improved segmented capacitor DAC is proposed to reduce the capacitance and the chip area. A dynamic latch comparator with output offset voltage storage technology is used to improve the precision. Adding an extra positive feedback in the latch is to increase the speed. What is more, two pairs of CMOS switches are utilized to eliminate the kickback noise introduced by the latch. The proposed SAR ADC was fabricated in SMIC 0.18 {{Î¼ }}{{m}} CMOS technology. The measured results show that this design achieves an SFDR of 61.8 dB and an ENOB of 7.72 bits, and it consumes 67.5 Î¼W with the FOM of 312 fJ/conversion-step at 1 MS/s sample under 1.8 V power supply.

A brand-new 3-D MOM unit capacitor is used as the basic capacitor cell of this capacitor array. The unit capacitor has a capacitance of 1 fF. Besides, the advanced capacitor array structure and switch mode decrease the power consumption a lot. To verify the effectiveness of this low power design, the 9 bit 100 MS/s SAR ADC is implemented in TSMC IP9M 65 nm LP CMOS technology. The measurement results demonstrate that this design achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 7.4 bit, a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of 46.40 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 62.31 dB at 100 MS/s with 1 MHz input. The SAR ADC core occupies an area of 0.030 mm2 and consumes 0.43 mW under a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The figure of merit (FOM) of the SAR ADC achieves 23.75 fJ/conv.

This ADC is characterized by superior power efficiency and small area, realized by employing a lateral metalâmetal capacitor array and a dynamic two-stage comparator. To avoid the need for a highspeed clock and its associated power consumption, an asynchronous logic was implemented in a logic control cell. A test chip has been developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology, including eight ADC channels with different layout flavors of the capacitor array, a transimpedance amplifier as a signal input structure, a serializer, and a custom-made LVDS driver for data transmission. The integral (INL) and differential (DNL) nonlinearities are measured below 0.5 LSB and 0.8 LSB, respectively, for the best channel operating at a sampling frequency of 10 MS/s. The area occupies 40 Î¼m 70 Î¼m for one ADC channel. The power consumption is estimated as 4 Î¼W at 1 MS/s and 38 Î¼W at 10 MS/s with a supply rail of 1.2 V.

The heating regime utilized the IBW branch between the 3rd and 4th harmonics of the hydrogen ion cyclotron frequencies. This harmonic number is the highest among those used in the IBW experiments ever conducted. The net radio-frequency (RF) power injected into the plasma is around 400 kW, limited by the transmitter output power. Core heating of ions and electrons was confirmed in the experiment and density profile peaking was found to feature the IBW heating (IBWH). The peaking of the density profile was also found when IBW was applied to the neutral beam injection heated discharges. An analysis by use of a transport code with these experimental data indicates that the particle confinement should be improved in the plasma core region on the application of IBWH. It is also found that the ion energy distribution function observed during IBWH has less high energy tail than those in conventional ion cyclotron range of frequency heating regimes. The observed IBWH-produced ion energy distribution function is in a reasonable agreement with the calculation based on the quasi-linear RF diffusion / Fokker-Planck model.

The proposed ADC employs a 3.5-bit flash ADC for coarse conversion, and a compact timing scheme at the flash/SAR boundary to speed up the conversion. The flash decision is used to control charge compensating for the reference voltage to reduce its input-dependent fluctuation. Measurement results show that the fabricated ADC has achieved significant improvement by applying the reference charge compensation. In addition, the ADC achieves a maximum signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 59.3 dB at 200 MS/s. It consumes 3.91 mW from a 1.2 V supply, including the reference buffer.

In 1878 Villa-Amil y Castro published the first printed catalogue of the manuscript collection of the old Colegio de San Ildefonso at the University of AlcalÃ¡ de Henares. In his work Villa-Amil followed closely the catalogues produced earlier in 1745 and again in 1800. More recently, Paul Oskar Kristeller has focused his interest on the humanistic manuscripts of this collection, as this library becomes essential in the study of humanism in the hispanic universities during the early Renaissance. From this point of view it is necessary a closer examination to the manuscripts belonging to the old Colegio de San Ildefonso. For example, volume MSS 133 contains eleven manuscritpts from the mid 15th century among them a unique testimony of a Latin composition by Alfonso de Palencia. The object of this paper is a more detailed bibliographical description of these eleven manuscripts in UCM BH MSS 133.\n\nDepolarization in Delivering Public Services? Impacts of Minimum Service Standards (MSS on the Quality of Health Services in Indonesia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohammad Roudo\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract. Some scholars argue that decentralization policy tends to create polarization, i.e. an increase of inequality/disparity among districts. To deal with this problem, Minimum Service Standards (MSS were introduced as a key strategy in decentralizing Indonesia. In this research, we tried to find out through MSS performance measurements whether imposing standards can be effective in a decentralized system by seeking its impacts on polarization/depolarization in the delivery of public services, specifically in the health sector. This question is basically a response to the common criticism that decentralization is good to create equality between central government and local governments but often does not work to achieve equality among local governments. Using self-assessment data from a sample of 54 districts from 534 districts in Indonesia, from 2010 to 2013, we found that the existence of depolarization in the delivery of public services could potentially occur among regions by reducing the gap between their public service performance and the targets of MSS. We acknowledge that there are weaknesses in the validity of the self-assessment data, caused by a lack of knowledge and skills to execute the self-assessment according to the official guidelines, by the overrating of target achievements, as well as the lack of data from independent sources to confirm the self-assessment outcomes. We also acknowledge that differences in financial capacity are still the main determinant why one district is more successful in achieving the MSS targets compared to other districts.Â Keywords.

More impurities are sputtered by ICRF heating than by NBI and/or ohmic heatings. The carbon contribution to Z eff is 80-90 % for NBI heated plasmas, and 60 % for NBI + ICRF heated plasmas. With a carbon coating of vacuum vessel, the Z eff value decreases 2.4 to 1.7 and the carbon contribution to Z eff increases up to 80-90 %. We obtain the diffusion coefficient D a = 1.0 m 2 /s and the convective velocity V a (a) = 13 m/s at the plasma edge for carbon impurity from the radial profile and time evolution of fully ionized carbon after the ICRF pulse is turned on.

The area occupied by the macrophytes was extracted by exclusion after the merging of two thematic masks representing the area of vegetation free water surface. One of the masks was obtained from a date when the vegetal cover is insignificant, while the other represents a large infestation episode. The utilization of digital processing of MSS/LANDSAT data techniques for the documentation of macrophytes infestation is feasible only when the phenomenon occurs in large areas.\n\nExperimental characteristics of ion Bernstein wave heating on JIPP T-IIU tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOgawa, Y.; Kawahata, K.; Ando, R.\n\n1986-03-01\n\nThe directly launched Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) heating experiments have been carried out on JIPP T-IIU tokamak for two experimental conditions; (a) the ''3rd-branch'' of the IBW between 3rd- and 4th-cyclotron harmonics of the deuterium, and (b) the ''2nd-branch'' of the IBW between 2nd- and 3rd-cyclotron harmonics. In the case (a), the direct hydrogen heating at Ï = 1.5 Î© H has been found in previous experiments. Here we present additional data to support this subharmonics heating, i.e., the spectroscopic measurement of Fe XVIII lines and mass separated analysis of charge-exchange neutrals. While, in the case (b), the remarkable increase of the electron temperature has been observed, especially at the central region of the plasma, and it has been estimated from the global energy balance that almost all of IBW power is delivered to the electron. To investigate this difference of the heating mode, the power absorption has been calculated with the ray tracing code, taking into account of the effect of the plasma/antenna coupling. It is concluded from the consideration of the electron Landau damping that the transition from the ion heating mode to the electron one would be explained by the difference of the electron temperature at the ohmic phase; i.e., T e (0) = 0.7 keV for the case (a) and T e (0) = 1.3 keV for the case (b).

Using this program, one can draw a waveform of successive 16 bit-integer data, such as obtained by analog-to-digital convertor. The program is written by the machine language and has a form of a subroutine program which can be called from main programs under N 88 BASIC. The time for drawing one waveform is 4 ms, which is two orders faster than the time with standard graphic routines of BASIC interpreter. This program is very convenient for the real-time display of plasma-monitoring raw data, such as plasma current, loop voltage, rf power etc. in tokamak experiments. This program has been utilized in JIPP T-IIU experiments and enables to display data of 8 channel ADC within a few seconds before the system transmits the data from CAMAC to the computer center of the institute. The program and its utilization are presented.

In order to carry out various basic experiments by varying the pellet deposition profile within a plasma, anew technique for an ice pellet injection system with controllability of the injection angle has been developed and installed with the JIPP t-IIU tokamak. Injection angle can be varied easily and successfully during an interval of two plasma shots in the course of an experiment. The injection angle has been varied poloidally from 6 to 6 degree by changing the angle of the last stage drift tube, and this makes possible for pellets to aim at from about r = -2 a/3 to r = 2 a/3 of the plasma. From two dimensional observations by CCD cameras, details of the pellet ablation structures with various injections angles have been studied, and a couple of interesting phenomena have been found. In the case of an injection angle (Î¸) larger than a certain value (Î¸ â¥ 4 0 ), a pellet penetrates straightly through the plasma with a trace of straight ablation cloud, which has been expected from usual theoretical consideration. On the other hand, a long helical tail of ablation light has been observed in the case of the angle smaller than the certain value (Î¸ â¤ 4 0 ). The direction of helical rotation (tail) is independent to that of the total magnetic field lines of the torus. In order to examine the tail direction, further experiments have been carried out as to four conditions of the combination with two (clockwise and counter-clockwise) toroidal field directions and with two plasma current directions. The results show that it seems to rotate to the electron diamagnetic direction poloidally, and to the opposite to the plasma current direction toroidally. Consideration on various cross sections including charge exchange, ionization and elastic collisions leads us to the conclusion that the tail-shaped phenomena may come from\n\nApplication of MSS/LANDSAT images to the structural study of recent sedimentary areas: Campos Sedimentary Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nParada, N.

The conventional dedicated sample-hold-amplifier (SHA) is eliminated and the matching requirement between the first multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) and sub-ADC is also avoided by using the SHA merged with the first MDAC (SMDAC) architecture, which features low power and stabilization. Further reduction of power and area is achieved by sharing an opamp between two successive pipelined stages, in which the effect of opamp offset and crosstalk between stages is decreased. So the 10-bit pipelined ADC is realized using just four opamps. The ADC demonstrates a maximum signal-to-noise distortion ratio and spurious free dynamic range of 52.67 dB and 59.44 dB, respectively, with a Nyquist input at full sampling rate. Constant dynamic performance for input frequencies up to 49.7 MHz, which is the twofold Nyquist rate, is achieved at 50 MS/s. The ADC prototype only occupies an active area of 1.81 mm{sup 2} in a 0.35 {mu}m CMOS process, and consumes 133 mW when sampling at 50 MHz from a 3.3-V power supply.\n\nThe use of Landsat-4 MSS digital data in temporal data sets and the evaluation of scene-to-scene registration accuracy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnderson, J. E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe MSS sensor on Landsat 4 is, in certain performance aspects, diferent from those of Landsats 1 through 3. These differences created some concern in the NASA research community as to whether individual data sets can be registered accurately enough to produce acceptable data sets for multitemporal data analysis. The use of Landsat 4 MSS digital data in temporal data sets is examined and a method is presented for estimating temporal registration accuracy based on the use of an X-Y digitizer and grey tone electrostatic plots. Results indicate that the RMS temporal registration errors are not significantly different from the temporal data sets generated using Landsat 4 and Landsat 2 data (33.35 meters) and the temporal data set constructed from two Landsat 2 data sets (33.61 meters). A derivation of the model used to evaluate the temporal registration is included.\n\nPlasma current startup by lower hybrid waves in the JIPP T-IIU tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nToi, K.; Ohkubo, K.; Kawahata, K.\n\n1987-04-01\n\nThis paper describes the characteristic behaviours of lower hybrid current startup in JIPP T-IIU. The current startup is carried out by injection of 800 MHz lower hybrid waves into cold and low density plasmas (Te = 10 - 20 eV, n-bar e = 1 - 2 x 10 12 cm -3 ) produced by electron cyclotron resonance or lower hybrid waves only. The plasma current rises up with a characteristic rise time Ï r (> approx 30 - 50 ms) and approaches a quasi-steady state value I pm (= 5 - 20 kA), when LHW power of 10 - 50 kW is injected into a torus, controlling the vertical field. The rise time is inversely proportional to the bulk electron density n-bar e , and is comparable to the collision time of current-carrying high energy electrons with bulk plasmas. On the other hand, the current drive efficiency in the quasi-steady state is almost independent of n-bar e , i.e., I pm /P LH = 0.4 - 0.7 A/W for n-bar e = 0.8 - 4 x 10 12 cm -3 . The conversion efficiency of rf energy injected into the torus is typically 5 % during current rise phase, and 10 % at the most efficient case. The effects of the initial injection of ECH power and the observed parametric instabilities on the current startup are investigated from a viewpoint of seed current generation. During rapid current rise when appreciably negative loop voltage is observed the bulk electrons are heated up to 150 eV. Various heating mechanisms responsible for the bulk electron heating are discussed.

Many of these interactions are facilitated by specific adhesins that belong to the Flo protein family. Flo mannoproteins have been implicated in phenotypes such as flocculation, substrate adhesion, biofilm formation, and pseudohyphal growth. Genetic data strongly suggest that individual Flo proteins are responsible for many specific cellular adhesion phenotypes. However, it remains unclear whether such phenotypes are determined solely by the nature of the expressed FLO genes or rather as the result of a combination of FLO gene expression and other cell wall properties and cell wall proteins. Mss11 has been shown to be a central element of FLO1 and FLO11 gene regulation and acts together with the cAMP-PKA-dependent transcription factor Flo8. Here we use genome-wide transcription analysis to identify genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by Mss11. Interestingly, many of these genes encode cell wall mannoproteins, in particular, members of the TIR and DAN families. To examine whether these genes play a role in the adhesion properties associated with Mss11 expression, we assessed deletion mutants of these genes in wild-type and flo11Î genetic backgrounds. This analysis shows that only FLO genes, in particular FLO1/10/11, appear to significantly impact on such phenotypes. Thus adhesion-related phenotypes are primarily dependent on the balance of FLO gene expression.\n\nUse of topographic and climatological models in a geographical data base to improve Landsat MSS classification for Olympic National Park\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCibula, William G.; Nyquist, Maurice O.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nAn unsupervised computer classification of vegetation/landcover of Olympic National Park and surrounding environs was initially carried out using four bands of Landsat MSS data. The primary objective of the project was to derive a level of landcover classifications useful for park management applications while maintaining an acceptably high level of classification accuracy. Initially, nine generalized vegetation/landcover classes were derived. Overall classification accuracy was 91.7 percent. In an attempt to refine the level of classification, a geographic information system (GIS) approach was employed. Topographic data and watershed boundaries (inferred precipitation/temperature) data were registered with the Landsat MSS data. The resultant boolean operations yielded 21 vegetation/landcover classes while maintaining the same level of classification accuracy. The final classification provided much better identification and location of the major forest types within the park at the same high level of accuracy, and these met the project objective. This classification could now become inputs into a GIS system to help provide answers to park management coupled with other ancillary data programs such as fire management.\n\nPower absorption and confinement studies of ICRF-heated plasma in JIPP T-IIU tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIda, K.; Ogawa, Y.; Toi, K.\n\n1988-08-01\n\nThe energy confinement characteristics of ICRF-heated tokamak plasmas are studied at high input power density â¼ 2 MWm -3 volume averaged, on the JIPP T-IIU device(R = 0.91 m/a = 0.23 m). High electron and ion temperatures (T e â¼ 2.5 keV, T i â¼ 2.0 keV, at each maximum) have been achieved by the operation at a plasma current I P of 280 kA, plasma line-averaged electron density n-bar e of 7 x 10 13 cm -3 and input power of 2 MW, with a suppression of total radiation loss (30 to 40 % of the total input power) by a carbon coating on the vacuum vessel. The fraction of ICRF power absorbed by the plasma, Î±, is determined experimentally from the decay of the stored plasma energy just after the ICRF pulse is terminated. The value of Î± increases slightly with increasing electron density and decreases from 90 to 70 % as the ICRF power is increased from 1 MWm -3 to 2 MWm -3 volume averaged. The global energy confinement time Ï E , defined by W P /(P OH + Î±P rf ), decreases by a factor of 2 â¼ 3 from that in ohmic plasmas as the heating power increases up to 2 MW. It is found that the energy confinement time has a strong line-averaged electron density dependence as Ï E ân-bar e 0.6 , which is obtained by the use of the measured absorbed power, while the Kaye-Goldston scaling predicts Ï E ân-bar e 0.26 .

Charles Kerfoot\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available There are numerous examples of past and present mine disposal into freshwater and marine coastal bays and riverine environments. Due to its high spatial resolution and extended water penetration, coastal light detection and ranging (LiDAR, coupled with multispectral scanning (MSS, has great promise for resolving disturbed shoreline features in low turbidity environments. Migrating mine tailings present serious issues for Lake Superior and coastal marine environments. Previous investigations in Lake Superior uncovered a metal-rich âhaloâ around the Keweenaw Peninsula, related to past copper mining practices. For over a century, waste rock migrating from shoreline tailing piles has moved along extensive stretches of coastline, compromising critical fish breeding grounds, damming stream outlets, transgressing into wetlands and along recreational beaches and suppressing benthic invertebrate communities. In Grand (Big Traverse Bay, Buffalo Reef is an important spawning area for lake trout and whitefish threatened by drifting tailings. The movement of tailings into Buffalo Reef cobble fields may interfere with the hatching of fish eggs and fry survival, either by filling in crevices where eggs are deposited or by toxic effects on eggs, newly hatched larvae or benthic communities. Here, we show that the coastal tailing migration is not âout of sight, out of mindâ, but clearly revealed by using a combination of LiDAR and MSS techniques.\n\n14-bit 100 MS/s 121 mW pipelined ADC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChen Yongzhen; Chen Chixiao; Feng Zemin; Ye Fan; Ren Junyan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a high-speed high-resolution pipelined ADC with low power and small area. The proposed ADC is designed based on the analysis of the stage scaling theory and the residual amplifiers are shared by two cascading MDACs to reduce power consumption. Shared op-amps with two split input paths are presented in this paper to eliminate the nonlinearity effects such as memory effect and crosstalk. Dynamic pre-amplified comparators are employed to decrease the static power consumption and suppress the kick-back in the comparators. This ADC is implemented in SMIC 0.18 Î¼m CMOS process with an area of 3.1 mm 2 . With a sampling rate of 100 MS/s, spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of the ADC are 82.7 dB and 69.1 dB, respectively. For signals up to 100 MHz, the SFDR and SNDR achieve 81.4 dB and 65.8 dB. The power consumption is 121 mW with a 1.8 V supply voltage.

However, neither the interaction among these factors nor their underlying mechanisms are well understood. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtDNA 15S rRNA C1477G mutation (PR) corresponds to the human 12S rRNA A1555G mutation. Here we report that a nuclear modifier gene mss1 mutation suppresses the neomycin-sensitivity phenotype of a yeast C1477G mutant in fermentable YPD medium. Functional assays show that the mitochondrial function of the yeast C1477G mutant was impaired severely in YPD medium with neomycin. Moreover, the mss1 mutation led to a significant increase in the steady-state level of HAP5 (heme activated protein), which greatly up-regulated the expression of glycolytic transcription factors RAP1, GCR1, and GCR2 and thus stimulated glycolysis. Furthermore, the high expression of the key glycolytic enzyme genes HXK2, PFK1 and PYK1 indicated that enhanced glycolysis not only compensated for the ATP reduction from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria, but also ensured the growth of the mss1(PR) mutant in YPD medium with neomycin. This study advances our understanding of the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.\n\nStructural mapping from MSS-LANDSAT imagery: A proposed methodology for international geological correlation studies\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDejesusparada, N.

Six extensive lineaments in the Brazilian study area are mapped and discussed according to their regional behavior and in relation to the adjacent continental margin.

Ongoing research to complete the methodological stages includes the mapping of the West African structural framework, reconstruction of the pre-drift puzzle, and an analysis of the counterpart correlations.\n\nVerification of helical tomotherapy delivery using autoassociative kernel regression\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSeibert, Rebecca M.; Ramsey, Chester R.; Garvey, Dustin R.; Wesley Hines, J.; Robison, Ben H.; Outten, Samuel S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nQuality assurance (QA) is a topic of major concern in the field of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The standard of practice for IMRT is to perform QA testing for individual patients to verify that the dose distribution will be delivered to the patient. The purpose of this study was to develop a new technique that could eventually be used to automatically evaluate helical tomotherapy treatments during delivery using exit detector data. This technique uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model to detect errors in tomotherapy delivery. AAKR is a novel nonparametric model that is known to predict a group of correct sensor values when supplied a group of sensor values that is usually corrupted or contains faults such as machine failure. This modeling scheme is especially suited for the problem of monitoring the fluence values found in the exit detector data because it is able to learn the complex detector data relationships. This scheme still applies when detector data are summed over many frames with a low temporal resolution and a variable beam attenuation resulting from patient movement. Delivery sequences from three archived patients (prostate, lung, and head and neck) were used in this study. Each delivery sequence was modified by reducing the opening time for random individual multileaf collimator (MLC) leaves by random amounts. The error and error-free treatments were delivered with different phantoms in the path of the beam. Multiple autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) models were developed and tested by the investigators using combinations of the stored exit detector data sets from each delivery. The models proved robust and were able to predict the correct or error-free values for a projection, which had a single MLC leaf decrease its opening time by less than 10 msec. The model also was able to determine machine output errors. The average uncertainty value for the unfaulted projections ranged from 0.4% to 1.8% of the detector\n\n47 CFR 25.258 - Sharing between NGSO MSS Feeder links Stations and GSO FSS services in the 29.25-29.5 GHz Bands.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 47 Telecommunication 2 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Sharing between NGSO MSS Feeder links Stations and GSO FSS services in the 29.25-29.5 GHz Bands. 25.258 Section 25.258 Telecommunication FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (CONTINUED) COMMON CARRIER SERVICES SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS Technical Standards Â§ 25...\n\nA 0.7V 7-to-10bit 0-to-2MS/s Flexible SAR ADC for Ultra Low-Power Wireless Sensor Nodes\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nHarpe, P.J.A.; Dolmans, G.; Philips, K.J.P.; Groot, de H.W.H.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a flexible SAR ADC in 90nm CMOS for wireless sensor nodes.

The proposed ADC uses SHA-less, op-amp and capacitor-sharing technique, capacitor-scaling scheme to reduce the die area and power consumption. A new capacitor-sharing scheme was proposed to cancel the extra reset phase of the feedback capacitors. The non-standard inter-stage gain increases the feedback factor of the first stage and makes it equal to the second stage, by which, the load capacitor of op-amp shared by the first and second stages is balanced. As for the fourth stage, the capacitor and op-amp no longer scale down. From the systemâs point of view, all load capacitors of the shared OTAs are balanced by employing a loading-balanced architecture. The die area and power consumption are optimized maximally. The ADC is implemented in a 0.18 Î¼m 1P6M CMOS technology, and occupies a die area of 1.2 Ã 1.2 mm{}2. The measurement results show a 55.58 dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and 62.97 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) with a 25 MHz input operating at a 200 MS/s sampling rate.

The custom design, fabricated in a commercial 130 nm CMOS process, shows a performance of 67.9 dB SNDR at 10 MHz for a single channel at 40 MS/s, with a latency of 87.5 ns (to first bit read out), while its total power consumption is 50 mW/channel. The chip uses two power supply voltages: 1.2 and 2.5 V. The sensitivity to single event effects during irradiation is measured and determined to meet the system requirements.\n\nA 14-bit 50 MS/s sample-and-hold circuit for pipelined ADC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYue Sen; Zhao Yiqiang; Pang Ruilong; Sheng Yun\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA high performance sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit used in a pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is presented.

A double-bootstrapped switch is designed to improve the performance of the circuit. The circuit is implemented using a 0.18 Î¼m 1P6M CMOS process. Measurement results show that the effective number of bits is 14.03 bits, the spurious free dynamic range is 94.62 dB, the signal to noise and distortion ratio is 86.28 dB, and the total harmonic distortion is â91:84 dB for a 5 MHz input signal with 50 MS/s sampling rate. A pipeline ADC with the designed S/H circuit has been implemented.

The ability to install integrated, complete systems that are highly efficient will impact the industryâs energy use for decades to come. Developing a process for these new systems is key to the adoption of state-of-the-art technologies in the Forest Products industry. This project defined an integrated process model that combines mini-sulfide sulfite anthraquinone (MSS-AQ) pulping and black liquor gasification with a proprietary desulfurization process developed by the Research Triangle Institute. Black liquor gasification is an emerging technology that enables the use of MSS-AQ pulping, which results in higher yield, lower bleaching cost, lower sulfur emissions, and the elimination of causticization requirements. The recently developed gas cleanup/absorber technology can clean the product gas to a state suitable for use in a gas turbine and also regenerate the pulping chemicals needed to for the MSS-AQ pulping process. The combination of three advanced technologies into an integrated design will enable the pulping industry to achieve a new level of efficiency, environmental performance, and cost savings. Because the three technologies are complimentary, their adoption as a streamlined package will ensure their ability to deliver maximum energy and cost savings benefits. The process models developed by this project will enable the successful integration of new technologies into the next generation of chemical pulping mills. When compared to the Kraft reference pulp, the MSS-AQ procedures produced pulps with a 10-15 % yield benefit and the ISO brightness was 1.5-2 times greater. The pulp refined little easier and had a slightly lower apparent sheet density (In both the cases). At similar levels of tear index the MSS-AQ pulps also\n\nA 12-bit 40 MS/s pipelined ADC with over 80 dB SFDR\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWei Qi; Yin Xiumei; Han Dandan; Yang Huazhong, E-mail: q-wei05@mails.tsinghua.edu.c [Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084 (China)\n\n2010-02-15\n\nThis paper describes a 12-bit 40 MS/s calibration-free pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is optimized for high spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) performance and low power dissipation.

The circuit and layout are carefully designed to optimize its performance and area. A 6-2-3 segmented structure is used for the trade-off among linearity, area and layout complexity. The sizes of current source transistors are calculated out according to the process matching parameter. The unary current cells are placed in a one-dimension distribution to simplify the layout routing, spare area and wiring layer. Their sequences are also carefully designed to reduce integral nonlinearity. The test result presents an SFDR of 72 dBc at 4.88 MHz input signal with DNL â©½ 0.25 LSB, INL â©½ 0.8 LSB. The full-scale output current is 5 mA with a 2.5 V analog power supply. The core of each channel occupies 0.08 mm 2 in a 1P-8M 55 nm CMOS process.

Francisco; de la Rosa, Jose M.\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThis paper describes the design of a 12-bit 80MS/s Digital-to-Analog converter implemented in 0.13mm CMOS logic technology. The design has been computer-aided by a developed toolbox for the simulation and verification of Nyquist-Rate Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog converters in MATLAB. The embedded simulator uses SIMULINK C-coded S-functions to model all required subcircuits including their main error mechanisms. This approach allows to drastically speed up the simulation CPU-time and makes the proposed tool an advantageous alternative for fast exploration of requirements and as a design validation tool. The converter is segmented in a unary current-cell matrix for 8 MSB's and a binary-weighted array for 4 LSB's. Current sources of the converter are laid out separately from current-cell switching matrix core block and distribute in double centroid to reduce random errors and transient noise coupling. The linearity errors caused by remaining gradient errors are reduced by a modified Q2 Random-Walk switching sequence. Simulation results show that the Spurious-Free Dynamic-Range is better than 58.5dB up to 80MS/s. The estimated Signal-to-Noise Distortion Ratio yield is 99.7% and it is supposed to be better than 58dB from DC to Nyquist frequency. Multi-Tone Power Ratio is higher 59dB for several DMT test signals. The converter dissipates less than 129mW from a 3.3V supply and occupies less than 1.7mm2 die area. The results have been checked with all process corners from -40Â° to 85Â° and power supply from 3V to 3.6V.\n\nA 10-bit 80-MS/s opamp-sharing pipelined ADC with a switch-embedded dual-input MDAC\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYin Rui; Zhang Wei; Tang Zhangwen [ASIC and System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203 (China); Liao Youchun, E-mail: zwtang@fudan.edu.cn [Ratio Microelectronics Co., Ltd, Shanghai 200433 (China)\n\n2011-02-15\n\nA 10-bit 80-MS/s opamp-sharing pipelined ADC is implemented in a 0.18-{mu}m CMOS. An opamp-sharing MDAC with a switch-embedded dual-input opamp is proposed to eliminate the non-resetting and successive-stage crosstalk problems observed in the conventional opamp-sharing technique. The ADC achieves a peak SNDR of 60.1 dB (ENOB = 9.69 bits) and a peak SFDR of 76 dB, while maintaining more than 9.6 ENOB for the full Nyquist input bandwidth. The core area of the ADC is 1.1 mm{sup 2} and the chip consumes 28 mW with a 1.8 V power supply.

To achieve high speed, a new window-opening logic based on the asynchronous SAR algorithm is proposed to minimize the logic delay, and a partial set-and-down DAC with binary redundancy bits is presented to reduce the dynamic comparator offset and accelerate the DAC settling. Besides, a new bootstrapped switch with a pre-charge phase is adopted in the track and hold circuits to increase speed and reduce area. The presented ADC achieves 52.9 dB signal-to-noise distortion ratio and 65 dB spurious-free dynamic range measured with a 30 MHz input signal at 160 MHz clock. The power consumption is 9.5 mW and a core die area of 250 Ã 200 Î¼m 2 is occupied.
