If I don't lead by example, who will?\"\n\nKim-Anne Dodd has always had a passion for helping others. She's served in the military as a Combat Medic, then continued her call to service with the Peace Corps, Red Cross and VA. Kim-Anne was raised in Oklahoma in foster care and joined the military at a young age. After being injured in Baghdad, she returned home and became a nurse working predominately for the VA in Nevada in the burn unit and hospice.\n\n​\n\nIn 2017, when she saw the destruction of Hurricane Harvey, she signed up to volunteer with the Red Cross and was sent to Florida to help with Hurricane Irma. She had expected to stay for a standard two-week Red Cross deployment, but couldn't bring herself to leave so soon.​\"I'm a soldier... I could not stop until the mission was over.\" Over the next three months, she volunteered all across the state of Florida, even completing forklift certification to help load supplies onto big rigs. After returning home, the Red Cross asked her to come back to Florida and help with long-term recovery. It was then that she decided to permanently move across the country to continue to serve the people in Florida.\n\n​\n\n​As someone diagnosed with PTSD, Kim-Anne knows how desperately others need help to alleviate/nullify symptoms related to PTSD. ​Kim-Anne has been diagnosed with combat-related PTSD and is a survivor of a recent S.A. After losing a child and being present at the Christmas Paddock Mall shooting, both in 2023, she had no choice but to learn how to be a survivor of PTSD. She is the ideal person to help PTSD survivors learn how to thrive and utilize the newest devices and local resources.\n\n​\n\n​​Kim-Anne knows that a support system is one of the most important things to have in your PTSD toolkit. She married her best friend, Jason, in December 2023. Jason and his family are a prime example of how a good support system can help a person in their PTSD journey. Her motto is and always has been, \"Life is too short to do anything but smile. It is what you make it.\""
