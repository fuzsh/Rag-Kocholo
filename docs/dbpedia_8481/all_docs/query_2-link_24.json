        "text": "So, in my third catalog I finally get to the topic that was my main area of expertise as a museum curator—pictorialism, that first international movement of artistic photography. I have researched pictorial photography thoroughly, both its initial period, from the 1890s to World War I, and its continuation all the way into the 1950s. Later pictorialists, such as Adolf Fassbender, D. J. Ruzicka, and Max Thorek are largely ignored in the published history of photography, so I attempt to give them their due here, sometimes in books I authored. I am especially enamored with ephemera, due to the valuable information it often provides, and offer some nice examples, such as salon catalogs and their corresponding stickers.\n\nABBOTT, C. Yarnall. John Luther Long, Madame Butterfly, New York: Century, 1903. Hardcover (green, cream, and black-stamped green cloth), 8 ½ x\n\n5 ¾ inches, 152 pages, 16 halftone illustrations.\n\nLong’s tragic tale, that became popular as an opera, about a Japanese woman who is jilted by an American man and commits hari-kari. The vignetted images show Cho-Cho-San alone, with her child, and ultimately kneeling with a sword. The reproductions have tissue guards, the text pages are on deckle-edged stock, and the cover is an attractive Art-Nouveau cover design of plants (signed “Y”). Issued the same year in a reduced format (see below).\n\nYarnall Abbott (1870-1938) was prominent in the Photographic Society of Philadelphia and also a member of Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession. One of his images from Madame Butterfly appeared as a halftone in a 1905 issue of Camera Work. The edges and tips of the cover are lightly worn. $45\n\nABBOTT, C. Yarnall. John Luther Long, Madame Butterfly, New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1903. Hardcover (green, white and black-stamped green cloth), 8 ½ x 5 ¾ inches, 152 pages, 8 halftone illustrations.\n\nThis is the smaller edition of the above, with half as many images, no tissue guards, thinner paper, but still sporting the nice cover design. Cloth edges and tips lightly worn. $30\n\nALBUM OF PICTURES 1939. Boston: S. D. Warren Co., 1939. Softcover, 11 x 8 ½ inches, 32 pages, 27 halftone illustrations.\n\nThis item demonstrated how good Warren’s Lustro Brilliant-Dull paper was for printing letterpress halftones. The company wisely chose to reproduce images by pictorial photographers, probably with the input of the editors of American Photography, which was also based in Boston. Among the contributing photographers are Eleanor Parke Custis, Arthur Hammond, and D. J. Ruzicka. Two pictorialists are represented by their best known images: Gustav Anderson’s Winter Eve and Frank R. Fraprie’s Warmth of the Winter Sun. Light rubbing and tiny folds to cover. $25\n\nAMERICAN ANNUAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY.\n\nThis long-running annual was the leading one on pictorial photography in the United States. Overseen by Frank R. Fraprie for much of its life, it was packed with articles and full-page halftones by photographers both domestic and foreign. During the 1940s it became known as the “pictorialist’s bluebook” because it compiled exhibition records for hundreds of salon photographers.\n\n1941, 1947, 1950. The lead articles are by Julian Smith, one of Australia’s top pictorialists, and on England’s F. J. Mortimer and Spain’s José Ortiz-Echagüe. They each measure about 10 x 7 ½ inches and contain approximately 250 pages. Two hardcovers and one soft, in very good condition. Group of three: $75\n\nAMERICAN ANNUAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY. Christian A. Peterson, Index to the American Annual of Photography, Minneapolis: author, 1996. Softcover, 9 ¾ x 7 ¼ inches, 148 pages. Signed.\n\nThe American Annual of Photography was the longest-running and most significant photographic yearly published in the United States. It first appeared in 1887 and by the time of its demise in 1953 covered over half the lifespan of the photographic medium. It remains today a rich resource on three generations of photographers. Included were such early figures as Edward Bierstadt and Napoleon Sarony, pictorialists Gertrude Käsebier and Clarence H. White, and twentieth-century masters like Minor White. This index encompasses every credited article and photographic reproduction in the annual’s sixty-seven volumes; over 3,500 names are alphabetically listed with citations. Privately printed in an edition of 500 copies. This copy signed by Peterson. Mint condition. $15\n\nANDERSON, Paul Lewis. Pictorial Landscape-Photography, Boston: Photo Era and Wilfred French, 1914. Hardcover (gold-stamped brown cloth), 9 ¾ x 7 ¼ inches, 48 pages, 14 halftone illustrations. Stated second edition.\n\nThis intimate book was Anderson’s first and most understated. The three chapters are: “The Subjective Side,” “Subjective Technique,” and “Technical Methods.” All the reproductions are early examples of the kind of soft-focus and evocative work that he championed for another quarter century. Paul L. Anderson (1880-1956) printed in a variety of manipulative processes, taught at the Clarence H. White School of Photography, and wrote extensively for the photographic press until about 1940. This edition is different from the first seemingly only by the color of the cloth. Light scuffing to cover. $35\n\nANDERSON, Paul Lewis. The Fine Art of Photography, Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1919. Hardcover (blue-stamped cream cloth), 8 x 5 ½ inches, 316 pages, 24 halftone illustrations and 17 diagrams, dustjacket. Stated third impression.\n\nAnderson’s third book, which includes reproductions by Photo-Secession members with whom he associated, such as Gertrude Käsebier, Karl F. Struss, and Clarence H. White. According to the front flap, “This volume might be entitled ‘Painting with the Camera,’ as it deals with photography as a fine art. Its aim is to point out the underlying principles of art in so far as they are applicable to photography, and to encourage the student of the subject to apply these principles in his own work.” Loose front hinge, in a dustjacket with a small rectangle cut from the spine. $25\n\nANDERSON, Paul Lewis. The Technique of Pictorial Photography, Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1939. Hardcover (gold-stamped brown cloth), 8 ½ x 6 inches, 404 pages, 28 halftone illustrations and 31 diagrams.\n\nThis is Anderson’s most substantial technical treatise, comprising over twenty chapters in five general sections: Apparatus, Negative Modification, Printing Methods, Color, and Miscellaneous. Among the pictorialists who contributed images were William E. Macnaughtan, D. J. Ruzicka, and Clarence H. White. The volume represents a complete rewrite of his 1917 book Pictorial Photography: Its Principles and Practice. Missing the dustjacket, but in near fine condition. $25\n\nANDERSON, Paul Lewis.\n\nPaul Anderson, issue of The Archive, May 1983 (no. 18), Tucson: Center for Creative Photography, University of Arizona, 1983. Softcover, 11 x 8 ½ inches, 48 pages, 22 halftone illustrations. Largely devoted to Anderson, the periodical features a portfolio of his images and the essay “Paul Lewis Anderson: A Life in Photography” by Terence R. Pitts. Fine condition.\n\nPaul Anderson: Photographs, Guide Series Number Seven, Tucson: Center for Creative Photography, University of Arizona, 1983. Softcover, 11 x 8 ½ inches, 40 pages, 245 halftone illustrations. This reference work reproduces all the images by Anderson in the center’s collection, representing over ten different processes and the following subjects: portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and Smith College. It includes a bibliography of his writings and reprints his 1915 article “The Education of the Photographic Artist.” Fine condition. The set of two: $25\n\nANNAN, James Craig. Glasgow Portraits by J. Craig Annan (1864-1946), Photographer, Glasgow: Scottish Arts Council, 1967. Softcover, 10 x 7 inches, 44 pages, 8 halftone illustrations.\n\nThe catalog for a traveling show of nearly ninety items by or relating to Annan. Among Annan’s distinguished sitters are the artists Muirhead Bone and William Strang. Most of the portraits are straightforward images, but two of them are reproduced on thin, translucent paper, suggesting the look of his more creative photogravures on tissue. James Craig Annan (1864-1946), the son of documentary photographer Thomas Annan, was a top Scottish pictorialist at the turn of the twentieth century. He learned the photogravure process from its Czech inventor, Karl Klic, became a leading commercial printer, and issued most of his own creative images as gravures. He corresponded regularly with Alfred Stieglitz, who included thirty of Annan’s photogravures in Camera Notes and Camera Work. Near fine condition. $25\n\nARCHER, Fred R. Fred Archer on Portraiture, San Francisco: Camera Craft, 1948. Hardcover (black-stamped gray cloth), 9 ¾ x 6 ½ inches, 220 pages, 213 halftone illustrations, dustjacket. Stated second printing (1950).\n\nWritten by Archer after giving hundreds of lectures on portraiture, this publication was probably used as a textbook at the photography school he ran in Los Angeles. He covers all aspects of the subject, including posing, makeup, lighting, equipment, the studio, retouching, “glamour,” and “creative portraiture.” Fred R. Archer (1889-1963) was active in Southern California from the 1910s to mid-century, with both pictorialists and professionals. In addition to soft-focus images, he produced modernist ones, such as the self-portrait on the cover, which superimposes a camera over his face. The dustjacket is worn, wrinkled, and missing pieces. $25\n\nART PHOTOGRAPHY IN JAPAN, 1920-1940. New York: Charles Schwartz and Howard Greenberg Gallery, 2003. Softcover, 10 x 8 ½ inches, 64 pages, 34 halftone illustrations. Signed.\n\nThis dealers’ exhibition catalog includes the essays “Pictorialism in Japan” by Christian A. Peterson and “Poetry of Light: Writings on Japanese Pictorial Photography” by Kerry Ross, and thirteen biographies. The pictures include primarily landscapes, still lifes, figure studies, and urban scenes, some with modernist tendencies. A useful addition to the dearth of information on Asian pictorialists available in the West. This copy signed by Peterson. Fine condition. $25\n\nASHIYA CAMERA CLUB. Art in Ashiya: Ashiya Camera Club, 1930-1942, Ashiya, Japan: Ashiya City Museum of Art and History, 1998. Softcover, 11 ¾ x\n\n8 ¼ inches, 204 pages, 110 halftone illustrations.\n\nThis exhibition catalog features the work of twenty-nine members of the Ashiya Camera Club, most of it very modernist in its pictorial sensibility. There are still lifes, nudes, and abstractions, sometimes rendered via the photogram and multiple exposure. Features an overview of the club and numerous installation shots of its exhibitions. A scarce publication. Text in Japanese. $50\n\nAUSTRALIAN PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY. Sydney: Art Gallery of New South Wales, 1979. Softcover, 10 ½ x 8 ¼ inches, 22 pages, 17 halftone illustrations.\n\nThis survey of art photography in Australia, 1898-1938, was edited and written by curator Gael Newton. She provides an overview addressing the country’s clubs, exhibitions, and relationship to England. Among the thirty pictorialists given biographies, the most well- known are Cecil W. Bostock, Harold Cazneaux, John Kaufmann, and Julian Smith. A good initial study on the subject. Near fine condition. $25\n\nBAFFORD, Edward L. Tom Beck, Edward L. Bafford, 1902-1981: A Life in Photography, University of Maryland Baltimore County Library, 1981. Softcover,\n\n9 x 10 ½ inches, 32 pages, 25 halftone illustrations (some in color).\n\nThis is the catalog for a memorial exhibition presented the same year as Bafford’s death. It features Beck’s essay on the photographer, a chronology, and a description of bromoil printing, a manipulative process at which Bafford excelled. Edward L. Bafford (1902-1981) was second only to A. Aubrey Bodine among Baltimore pictorialists. He photographed from the 1920s until his death, making romantic images of rural life and the environs of his home city. Fine condition. $25\n\nBAILEY, Hillary G. The Story of a Face, San Francisco: Camera Craft, 1938. Hardcover (yellow-stamped blue cloth), 9 ¾ x 6 ¾ inches, 128 pages, 62 halftone illustrations, dustjacket. Stated first edition.\n\nBailey’s treatise on portrait photography, covering posing, lighting, and other pertinent elements of the genre, highlighted with diagrams and charts. Hillary G. Bailey (1894-1988) explored various avenues of photography from the 1920s to 1940s. He ran his own portrait studios in Indiana beginning in 1922 and subsequently worked for the Agfa Ansco Corporation, a major photographic manufacturer in Binghamton, New York. As a pictorialist, he most frequently made figure studies and was active in camera clubs in Indianapolis and Atlanta. The dustjacket is torn and missing small pieces. $25\n\nBARTLETT, Mrs. N. Gray. Mother Goose of ’93, Boston: Joseph Knight, 1893. Hardcover (silver-stamped white paper and decorative paper over boards),\n\n9 ½ x 11 ¼ inches, 20 pages, 10 photogravure illustrations.\n\nThis delicate children’s book comprises Mother Goose nursery rhymes (such as “Little Miss Muffet”) and images by Bartlett printed together on tissue sheets that are tipped in. Her images picture well-dressed boy and girls acting out the verses and evoke the sweet Victorian charm of the early pictorial period. Mary A. Bartlett (1846-1913) was active in Chicago camera clubs during the 1890s, making primarily portraits and genre scenes. This is one of only three children’s books she illustrated, all with rich photogravures and published in the early 1890s. The front hinge is starting, number written on free endpaper, and the covers are worn, as is usual. $250\n\nBARTON, Emma.

It includes portraits of her family members, ephemera, photographs by other pictorialists, and Barton’s own pictures of children, the “Kodak Girls,” and other subjects. Working from the turn of the twentieth century until about 1930, Emma Barton (1872-1938) produced mostly figure studies and portraits, in black and white and as Autochrome color plates. She presented a solo show at the Royal Photographic Society (London) in 1901 and later exhibited at the Birmingham Photographic Society and in the American Photographic Salons, which traveled around the United States.

Clark Blickensderfer (1882-1962) was most active as a pictorialist during the 1920s, when he helped found the Denver Camera Club and joined the Pictorial Photographers of America. His soft-focus images picture landscapes, mountains, birds, and Native American sites. Mint condition, in shrink wrap. $35\n\nBODINE, A. Aubrey. My Maryland, Baltimore: Camera Magazine, 1952.

Stated first edition, signed, with ephemera.\n\nCamera Notes (1897-1903) was the most significant American photographic periodical before Camera Work began in 1903.

Among the pictorialists represented were F. Holland Day, Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr., Gertrude Käsebier, Edward Steichen, and Clarence H. White. This book is the only one that details the history and meaning of the magazine. In addition to the thorough essay, are full-color reproductions of all the photogravures and indexes to both the articles and halftone illustrations. Edition of 3,500.

Peterson’s essay covers the history of the magazine, Stieglitz’s use of photogravure, and the idea that the gravures were a type of original, due to the frequent use of the photographer’s original negative and the quality of the printing. The catalog’s understated design echoes that of Camera Work, with old style typography, open space, and the use of black and red ink. Printed in a single edition of 600. This copy signed by Peterson.

Curtis, who had begun publishing his series The North American Indian shortly before, provides quality reproductions of Indians praying, honoring stars, grinding corn, meeting in council, and performing other activities. Edward S. Curtis (1868-1952) produced the most extensive documentation of Native American culture of the twentieth century in his twenty-volume set The North American Indian (1906-1930). He was not considered a pictorialist during his lifetime but is now seen to fit comfortably within the movement, due to his use of soft-focus effects, idealized subject matter, and the photogravure process. Previous owner’s stamp and written name. Light wear to tips, bottom edge, and top and bottom of spine. $150\n\nCURTIS, Edward S. A. D. Coleman and T. C.

Composition and Pictures, Boston: American Photographic Publishing Co., 1947. Hardcover (gold-stamped red cloth),\n\n11 ¼ x 8 ½ inches, 224 pages, 173 halftone illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nComposition and Pictures was among the last major publications on pictorial photography. In it, Custis deals with both the principles of composition and their practical application. Central to the book is her examination of dynamic symmetry, a mathematical formula for picture making. “Good” and “bad” images are reproduced, along with a multitude of diagrams. Eleanor Parke Custis (1897-1983) was the most prominent women pictorialist working in the 1930s and 1940s. Before turning to photography, she made Impressionist-inspired gouaches and watercolors during the 1920s, some of which are reproduced in the book. During the 1940s, she was frequently the world’s most prolific salon exhibitor; her peak season was 1949-50, when 257 of her prints were accepted by over ninety venues.

It covers the photographer’s life and work, and ends with three informative appendices: exhibition history, published photographs, and reprints of nine of his published articles. William Dassonville (1879-1957) began as a naturalistic photographer, making sensitive landscapes. Morphing into a pictorialist, he was active in California for the first half of the twentieth century, often photographing seaside images. He also owned a company that manufactured fine photographic paper for discerning amateurs and professionals (most notably “Charcoal Black”). This copy signed by Palmquist on the title page.

Hardcover (silver-stamped green cloth), 10 ½ x 7 ¾ inches, 310 pages, halftone illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nThis was the first and remains the most extensive critical biography of the distinctive Boston pictorialist F. Holland Day. For a short time at the turn of the twentieth century, Day rivaled Alfred Stieglitz for prominence as both a photographer and organizer. However, he ultimately declined to take on Stieglitz’s outsized ego, and contented himself with making portraits of young boys and posing himself as Jesus Christ. As the title of the book indicates, F. Holland Day (1864-1933) was an eccentric, a successful photographer, a devoted publisher, and a flamboyant aesthete. Fine condition, in dustjacket that is very lightly worn and sunned on the spine (as is normal). $35\n\nDAY, F. Holland. Pam Roberts and others, F. Holland Day, Amsterdam: Van Gogh Museum, 2000.

It commenced the Wilmington Salon of Photography in 1934, sponsored a five-day lectures series by Ansel Adams in 1944, and sent it members on photographing trips as far as England and Italy. Most of the item is given over to a well-illustrated chronology. Near fine condition. $10\n\nDEMACHY, Robert. Anna Bowman Dodd, In and Out of Three Normandy Inns, Boston: Little, Brown, 1910. Hardcover (gold-stamped blue cloth with mounted reproduction), 8 x 5 ½ inches, 398 pages, 32 halftone illustrations.\n\nThis is the revised and corrected edition (issued without a dustjacket) of the 1892 first, which did not have illustrations by Demachy. Dodd’s charming travelogue through the French countryside is interspersed with 24 of Demachy’s soft, evocative landscape and rural images, made especially for the book. The cover features a very painterly image by him of a stand of trees that also appeared as a photogravure in Camera Work. The leading French pictorialist around 1900, Robert Demachy (1859-1936) was most revered for his images of female nudes. He was a cofounder of the Photo-Club de Paris, exhibited extensively in photographic salons, and championed the gum-bichromate process, which allowed hand manipulation of the image during development. Light wear to cover, front hinge a little loose, and previous owner’s stamp and notation. $35\n\nDEMACHY, Robert. Anna Bowman Dodd, In and Out of Three Normandy Inns, New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1929. Hardcover (red-stamped blue cloth),\n\n9 x 6 ¼ inches, 356 pages, 19 halftone illustrations (1 in color), dustjacket. Stated first printing (of this edition).\n\nThis is a curious and little-known Demachy item, as it includes reproductions of drawings, not photographs, by him. See above for the previous edition, with his photographic illustrations. After years as the top French pictorialist, Demachy gave up photography to pursue drawing at the outbreak of World War I, for unknown reasons. His crayon drawings (and pastel frontispiece) are competent renditions of specific sites in the text. Demachy receives credit on both the front of the dustjacket and title page. Mild internal foxing, in a dustjacket that is chipped, torn, and faded on the spine. $35\n\nDEMACHY, Robert.

The reproductions are in a variety of rich hues, reflecting the distinctive color of his prints in gum-bichromate and other control processes. Among the subjects are nudes, figure studies, and landscapes. In addition, a number of Demachy’s drawings are included, as he turned away from artistic photography during World War I. Text in French.

Hardcover (gold-stamped black leatherette), 12 ¾ x 9 ¾ inches, unpaginated, 62 halftone illustrations, dustjacket. Stated first edition.\n\nThis was the first examination of De Meyer’s work, concentrating on his evocative still lifes and portraits, edited by Robert Brandau. Philppe Jullian’s biographical essay covers the photographer’s commercial work for companies such as Elizabeth Arden, his dance photographs of Vaslav Nijinsky, his personal creative work, and his life in the world of high fashion and royalty. Among the figures whose portraits are included are photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, playwright Eugene O’Neill, and actress Gloria Swanson. Fine condition, in a price-clipped dustjacket with a few minor nicks. $50\n\nDICKSON, Edward R. Poems of the Dance: An Anthology, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. Hardcover (black-stamped paper and gold-stamped tan cloth), 8 x\n\n5 ¾ inches, 164 pages, 16 halftone illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nA healthy selection of poems about dance, from ancient Hindu classics to modern ones by writers such as Oscar Wilde. The images are of dancers in diaphanous dress frolicking in natural settings, rendered in muted tones. Dickson chose the poems and provided the pictures, while Louis Untermeyer wrote the introduction. Known primarily as a landscape photographer of great sensitivity, Edward R. Dickson (1880-1922) published the important periodical Platinum Print in the 1910s and was closely associated with Clarence H. White and the Pictorial Photographers of America. Previous owner’s inscription, covers lightly worn, in the rare dustjacket, which is torn, worn, and missing pieces. $50\n\nDORR, Nell. In a Blue Moon, New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1939. Hardcover (silver-stamped gray cloth), 9 x 6 inches, unpaginated, screen-gravure illustrations, slipcase.\n\nDorr’s brief introduction begins, “It’s only once in a Blue Moon that days like these can happen, but when they do, they add a new dimension to the years that follow.” The book is made up largely of rich, bleed images of flowers and nude girls and young women out in the Florida Keyes, made ten years earlier. It was issued without a dustjacket, but in a slipcase illustrated with a negative image of a figure. Nell Dorr (1893-1988) did not actively participate in the pictorial movement, but her work sports soft-focus effects and sentimental subject matter (most notably women and children). Working from the 1930s to 1960s, she illustrated five books, this being the second one. Near fine condition, in a slipcase that has minor scuffing. $150\n\nDORR, Nell. Mother and Child, New York: Harper and Brothers, 1952. Hardcover (silver-stamped red cloth and paper over boards), 8 ½ x 7 inches, 88 pages, 71screen-gravure illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nDorr dedicated this book to one of her daughters who died the year of publication at 39 years of age. It includes a few pages of text but is largely comprised of photographs of infant girls alone and with their mothers. Although Dorr shows loving relationships, a somber mood is created by the dominance of dark tonalities in the images. This copy has a folded sheet of text “From the Author to the Reader” pasted onto the back of the front free endpaper, an item not present in all copies of the book. Light shelf wear, in a price-clipped dustjacket that is chipped, torn, and tape-repaired. $45\n\nDORR, Nell. Mother and Child, San Francisco: Scrimshaw Press, 1972. Hardcover (silver-stamped red cloth and paper), 10 x 8 ¼ inches, unpaginated, halftone illustrations. Stated second edition.\n\nThis reprise of the above first edition is slightly larger in format and printed in halftone, instead of gravure. Dorr’s brief text begins, “The story is from everlasting to everlasting. Yet when it happens to you, that your new-born is laid for the first time in your arms, it is the whole miracle of creation and your heart cries out as did Mary’s: ‘My soul doth magnify the Lord.’” Light wear to tips and edges of dustjacket, which is missing a small piece. $35\n\nDORR, Nell. Of Day and Night, Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1968. Hardcover (gold-stamped blue cloth and black-stamped paper over boards), 9 ¼ x 11 ¼ inches, 98 pages, screen-gravure illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nThis dreamy book, a “quest for the meaning of life,” features poems and pictures. The likes of Emily Dickenson and E. E. Cummings provided poems, while Dorr created all the images. Most of the photographs feature women or light abstractions, and are printed in high-quality gravure, bleeding off the pages. Near fine condition, with two corners lightly bumped, in extremely bright dustjacket. $35\n\nDUGMORE, A. Radclyffe. Nature and the Camera: How to Photograph Live Birds and their Nests; Animals, Wild and Tame; Reptiles; Insects; Fish and other Aquatic Forms; Flowers, Trees, and Fungi, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1903. Hardcover (green-stamped green cloth, with mounted photogravure), 8 ½ x 6 ¼ inches, 126 pages, 53 halftone illustrations.\n\nThe title of this book well summarizes its contents. It is heavily illustrated with Dugmore’s pictures, which are straightforward documents, except for the more pictorial cover image, rendered in high-quality gravure. A. Radclyffe Dugmore (1870-1955) was a naturalist and a hunter, who expressed himself as an artist, photographer, and author (writing about twenty books). As a pictorialist, he joined the Camera Club of New York and exhibited at London’s Royal Photographic Society. Most importantly, Alfred Stieglitz included two of his images in Camera Work, printed as photogravures in 1903 and 1907. Light wear to covers. $25\n\nDYER, William B. James Whitcomb Riley, Riley Love-Lyrics. Three editions of Dyer’s most widely-seen and lasting work.\n\nPublished by Bowen-Merrill, Indianapolis, 1899. Hardcover (gold, black, and white-stamped green cloth), 8 x 5 ½ inches, 192 pages, 77 halftone illustrations. Dyer’s images are mostly figure studies with borders, vignetting, or other printer’s alterations, making them intimate and gemlike. William B. Dyer (1860 -1931) was a Chicago pictorial and professional photographer, specializing in portraits and book illustration. Alfred Stieglitz made him a member of his elite Photo-Secession group and ran two of his photogravures (both of female nudes) in a 1907 issue of Camera Work. Spine sunned (as is normal). This edition is the most common one.\n\nPublished by Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, 1899. Hardcover (gold, black, and white-stamped blue cloth), 8 x 5 ¼ inches, 192 pages, 77 halftone illustrations.

Dyer adds additional images of women, reading, walking outdoors, and congregating together. This is a tour-de-force of artistic bookmaking. Near fine condition, except for previous owner’s name and light scuffing to dustjacket. $95\n\nEDDY, Sarah J. Friends and Helpers, Boston: Ginn, 1900. Hardcover (green and gold-stamped green cloth), 7 ½ x 5 ¾ inches, 232 pages, halftone illustrations.\n\nEddy commences the preface by stating, “The object of this book is to teach children to be helpers in the animal world.” She does so in nearly 100 short stories about dogs, cats, horses, birds, and other animals, some written by others, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. The illustrations are also from various sources, with at least a dozen by Eddy herself. During the first decade of the twentieth century, Sarah J. Eddy (1851-1945) exhibited her photographs at camera clubs in New England, particularly the Boston Camera Club, of which she was a non-resident member (living in Rhode Island). In 1903 alone her work (mostly of children, women, and animals) was accepted at pictorial salons in Chicago, Cleveland, and Minneapolis. Between 1899 and 1938, she wrote or compiled five children’s books on animals and their care. Wear to edges of cloth. $35\n\nEDDY, Sarah J. Alexander and Some Other Cats, Boston: Marshall Jones, 1938. Hardcover (gold-stamped green cloth), 9 ½ x 6 ¼ inches, 208 pages, 85 halftone illustrations, dustjacket.

Her pictures show felines sleeping, stretching, grooming, supposedly typing and playing chess, and with other animals such as birds and dogs. Light wear to tips, dustjacket missing small pieces. $35\n\nEICKEMEYER, Rudolf, Jr. Hamilton Wright Mabie, Nature and Culture, New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1904.

Dustjacket.\n\nProlific author Mabie’s spiritual outlook on the interdependence of mankind and nature. The high-quality illustrations are printed different colors and have tissue guards with a line from the text. Eickemeyer photographed the seashore, woods, streams, flowers, and other natural settings, sometimes effectively emphasizing the foreground. Rudolf Eickemeyer (1862-1932), a New York portrait photographer, had his creative work included as photogravures in Camera Notes. He produced a significant amount of portrait, genre, and landscape work for book illustrations in the first decade of the twentieth century. Light wear to tips, in the very rare dustjacket that is worn, torn, and tape repaired. $35\n\nEICKEMEYER, Rudolf, Jr. Stanton Davis Kirkham, In the Open: Intimate Studies and Appreciations of Nature, San Francisco: Paul Elder, 1908.

Winter, 1903, platinum print, 7 ½ x 9 ½ inches (image and sheet).\n\nThis image shows bare trees and brush in winter, with a foot-trodden path in the snow. Some of the branches at mid distance gleam nicely due to the ice on them and rear illumination by the sun. The picture appears in Eickemeyer’s deluxe book Winter (R. H. Russell, New York, 1903), accompanied by a poem by an anonymous writer that reads in part, “Though all life’s portals are indiced [sic] with woe/And frozen pearls are all the world can show/Feel! Nature’s breath is warm beneath the snow.” A larger print of this image is in the collection of the George Eastman House. Image sent upon request. Light brown spotting along top edge of image. $750\n\nEMERSON, Peter Henry. Izaak Walton, The Compleat Angler, or the Contemplative Man’s Recreation, Being A Discourse of Rivers, Fish-Ponds, Fish, and Fishing and Instructions How to Angle for a Trout of Grayling in a Clear Stream by Charles Cotton, edited by R. B. Marston, London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington, 1888. Hardcover (black-stamped gray cloth and paper over boards), 11 ½ x 9 inches, 358 pages, 52 photogravure illustrations. Two volumes, Lea and Dove demy quarto edition, numbered 66 of 500 copies, signed by Marston.\n\nA long treatise on fishing, with about 100 woodcuts and frontispiece portraits of Walton and Cotton that are color etchings. The photogravures are primarily of river scenes, 27 of them by Emerson and 25 by George Bankart. While Bankart’s images are sharply focused and rendered in brown ink, Emerson’s are much softer and printed in gray, adding to their foggy quality. For this project he photographed exclusively along the River Lea, which empties into the Thames in London. A major nineteenth-century English photographer, Peter Henry Emerson (1856-1936) spearheaded naturalistic photography through his images and his writings. He burst on the scene in 1889 with the book Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art (see below), promoting photography as an art and nature as its primary subject. Most of his exquisite images were issued as photogravures in limited-edition books and portfolios, such as this one. Water stain to one frontispiece (not effecting the image), this set was recently rebound in a clean manner (new covers in near fine condition). $1,000\n\nEMERSON, Peter Henry. Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art, New York: Amphoto, 1972. Hardcover (silver-stamped green cloth), 7 ½ x 5 inches, 314 pages, unillustrated, dustjacket.\n\nThis is a reprint of the 1890 second, revised edition of Emerson’s defining treatise on naturalistic photography, a movement closely associated with pictorialism. In it he gives extensive technical instruction, shares his opinions about art, argues for photography as a means of creative expression, and explains his theory of differential focusing. This edition with an introduction by photography historian Peter Pollack. Writing on one flap, in a dustjacket that is chipped. $25\n\nEMERSON, Peter Henry. Nancy Newhall, P. H.

Hardcover (gold and blind-stamped gray paper over boards), 12 x 9 ¾ inches, 366 pages, 295 halftone illustrations (some in color), dustjacket.\n\nThis is a comprehensive study of Eugene. It examines his aesthetics, the relationship of his photographs to German paintings, and his time teaching at art academies in Munich and Leipzig, 1907-1927. Features an exhaustive exhibition history, listing of his students, and biographies of the artists and photographers he associated with most closely. Born Frank Eugene Smith (1865-1936), this “painter-photographer” was recognized in both the United States and Germany for his portraits and figure studies. His pictorial photographs were heavily handworked, often resembling etchings, and his photogravures comprised two full issues of Camera Work (both in 1910), signaling Alfred Stieglitz’s strong support. Mint condition, in shrink wrap. $125\n\nEVANS, Frederick H. Beaumont Newhall, Frederick H. Evans, Rochester: George Eastman House, 1964. Softcover, 10 ¾ x 8 inches, 48 pages, 19 halftone illustrations.\n\nThe first little monograph devoted to Evans has Newhall discussing Evans as a bookseller and artistic photographer, covering his trans-Atlantic relationship with Alfred Stieglitz, his involvement with the Royal Photographic Society and Linked Ring Brotherhood, and his glorious pictures of cathedral interiors. Commences with his most famous image, A Sea of Steps, from Wells Cathedral in 1903. Frederick H. Evans (1853-1943) was one of England’s most accomplished pictorialists around the turn of the twentieth century. His cathedral pictures concentrated on the light and spirit of the subjects, rather than the architecture per se, rendered as straight platinum prints, without overt manipulation. Near fine condition, with previous owner’s address label. $35\n\nEVANS, Frederick H. Beaumont Newhall, Frederick H. Evans, Photographer of the Majesty, Light and Space of the Medieval Cathedrals of England and France, Millerton, New York: Aperture, 1973. Hardcover (gray-stamped gray cloth), 10 ¾ x 9 ¾ inches, unpaginated, 75 halftone illustrations, dustjacket.\n\nThis hardcover includes Newhall’s text from the above title (apparently unaltered), with an expanded set of images by Evans.

The photographer writes on critics, lantern slides, technique, his library, Wells Cathedral, and Julia Margaret Cameron. Among those writing on Evans are the critic Anthony Guest and fellow pictorialist A. Horsley Hinton. Near fine condition, in dustjacket that is lightly rubbed with one short tear. $75\n\nFARNSWORTH, Emma J. Mary D. Brine, Little Lad Jamie, New York: E. P. Dutton, 1895. Hardcover (gold and black-stamped green cloth), 9 x 7 inches, 52 pages, 8 photogravure illustrations.\n\nBrine, the author of other children’s books, writes about the adventures of a boy while he is visiting his grandmother, some of which are illustrated by Farnsworth’s images. The photogravures, which are printed on tissue and tipped in, show Little Lad Jamie in bed, gardening, and playing. Farnsworth’s name does not appear in the book, but the same illustrations also appear in William Croswell Doane’s Sunshine and Play-Time, in which she is prominently credited. Emma Justine Farnsworth (1860-1952) spent her entire life in Albany, New York, but presented a solo show of her work at the prestigious Camera Club of New York in 1897. Alfred Stieglitz included a photogravure by her in a 1900 issue of Camera Notes and Frances Benjamin Johnston included Farnsworth in the series “The Foremost Women Photographers in America” for the Ladies’ Home Journal in 1901. Half of inscribed front free endpaper missing, front hinge separated, wear to covers, with piece missing from spine. $50\n\nFASSBENDER, Adolf. Pictorial Artistry: The Dramatization of the Beautiful, New York: B. Westermann, 1937. Hardcover (gold-stamped cream cloth over boards, with internal metal spiral binding), 16 x 13 ¾ inches, unpaginated, 40 photogravures. Signed.\n\nThis is the most lavish publication from the second generation of pictorial photographers, produced in a limited edition of 1,000 copies, all numbered and signed by the photographer. The gravures are breathtakingly rich, printed individually in different colors and described by the photographer, both aesthetically and technically. They begin with his famous image The White Night, picturing New York’s Central Park on a snowy evening, and proceed through landscapes, figure studies, and still lifes. Unfortunately, Pictorial Artistry appeared just a few years before World War II, and the combination of the German-named publisher and Fassbender’s German heritage, crippled sales for many years. Adolf Fassbender (1884-1980) was in the top echelon of American pictorial photographers during the 1930s and 1940s. He performed extensive handwork on his images in order to realize his idealized vision of photographic beauty, mastering many control processes, such as the paper negative. He greatly influenced two generations of both pictorialists and professional photographers (who took to calling him “Papa”), making his living as a private teacher for half a century, beginning in about 1930. This copy numbered 857 of one thousand, and signed by Fassbender. While usually found in soiled covers this one is particularly clean, with minor bumps to top and bottom of spine, with the rear endpaper detached. $2,250\n\nFASSBENDER, Adolf.

This group, the Pictorial Forum, was organized by individuals who had become friends while studying with Adolf Fassbender. Among the exhibitors are Gustav Anderson, Barbara Green, J. Ghislain Lootens, Thomas O. Sheckell, and Fassbender himself. This is the only known printed piece on the Pictorial Forum, and, thus, a scarce item. Near fine condition. SOLD\n\nFASSBENDER, Adolf. PSA Journal, November 1966 (vol. 32). Softcover, 11 ¼ x 8 ¼ inches, 52 pages.\n\nFassbender is the focus of this issue, with his image The Octogenarians (showing two men with pipes and canes conversing on a bench) on the cover. In 1966, he received the progress medal from the Photographic Society of America, and Glenn E. Matthews contributes an article on him. Following it Fassbender writes a ten-page article titled “Why Bother?” which begins, “The camera and the photographic process conspire to produce falsehood. Control techniques can help us recapture the mood or feeling experienced in picture taking, then to introduce artistic effects which may be purely emotional or personal.” It features sixteen halftone illustrations by him including his forceful image from the 1939 New York World’s Fair Dynamic Symbol, made from four separate negatives. Minor cover wear. $10\n\nFASSBENDER, Adolf. Christian A. Peterson, The Pictorial Artistry of Adolf Fassbender, Nutley, New Jersey: Fassbender Foundation, 1994.

Signed by author, with ephemera.\n\nThis is the only monograph on Fassbender, issued on the occasion of an exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, which holds a master set of his prints. The essay examines Fassbender’s upbringing in Germany, his early years as a portrait photographer, his success at and contributions to pictorialism, and his importance as a teacher. The plates are reproduced in full color, to approximate the many tones in which he produced his pictorial prints. Includes notes to some of the plates by Fassbender and tributes from over a dozen of his former students. Laid in are three pieces of related ephemera: a brochure for the book, exhibition opening invitation, and a copy of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts’ members’ magazine with a cover article on the show.

Still, there are four American winter scenes, most of them showing trees under snow, including one titled Christmas in Manhattan (1947), made in Central Park with apartment buildings in the background. Some of them have printed greetings inside, the typography cleverly mimicking the shape of a Christmas tree. The images are toned black, brown, and blue, and were made from copy negatives, as Fassbender’s signature and the picture title are visible below each image. The one exception is an original color print tipped into a stock card dated 1967. It shows an Austrian lakeside village below towering mountains and is hand-signed “The Fassbenders.” An unusual offering, most in near fine condition. The set of eighteen: $450\n\nFIELD, J. H.

He exhibited his personal creative work as early as 1900, in the Third Philadelphia Photographic Salon, and was a member of the populist Salon Club of America.

As I Remember, New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1936. Hardcover (gold-stamped black and maroon cloth), 10 ¼ x 7 ¾ inches, 290 pages, 112 screen-gravure illustrations.\n\nThis is one of the few autobiographies by a photographer who was a pictorialist during part of his career. Arnold Genthe (1869-1942) made a name for himself in both the artistic and portrait genres, from the turn of the twentieth century into the 1930s. According to the front flap, “Through the whole story runs the spirit of a gay, engaging bon vivant and artist who has a way with words as well as cameras.” Illustrated with rich gravures, the book covers Genthe’s early days in Germany, his high-brow schooling, his 1895 immigration to America, his photographing San Francisco’s Chinatown and aftermath of the 1906 earthquake, his work in New Orleans, and his involvement with the Pictorial Photographers of America. In 1911 Genthe moved to New York, where he operated a thriving portrait studio, photographing at least three presidents and famous figures such as the dancer Isadora Duncan.
