Delisle was privy to valuable Russian confidential information as a result of his involvement in the planning of the second Bering expedition. In 1752 he published his memoir and the Carte des Nouvelles Découvertes showing Russian discoveries in the north Pacific. This \"...marked the beginning of a controversy which exercised a bizarre influence on the course of exploration along the Pacific coast of North America\". (Cumming et al, pp. 225) The map depicts the Russian discoveries in 1723, 1732, and 1741, de Frondat's voyage of 1709, the route of the Galions in 1743, the Water of Wager &c. Delisle and Buache also incorporated information derived from De Fonte's fictitious account: an elaborate system of inland seas and straits, the enormous Sea of the West, and, most importantly, a Northwest Passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic.\n\nThe map has a broad top border containing the title within a cartouche and engravings of a native of Kamchatka and a North American Indian in the top corners.\n\nTooley, The Mapping of America, p. 34, No. 101.

Franchère, then in the employ of the Pacific Fur Company, was attached to Astor's expedition to the Columbia River to found a trading post at Astoria. His narrative describes the difficult voyage out in the Tonquin , by way of Cape Horn, and presents a faithful chronicle of events at Astoria from its founding until its surrender to the Northwest Company in 1813. There is much information relating to the growing rivalry between the two fur trading companies, the manners and customs of the Pacific Coast Indian tribes, and the traders' relations with them. Also included is an account of Franchère's five month overland return journey three years later, up the Columbia River, through the Rockies and across the Canadian prairies to Montreal. The work was originally published in French at Montreal in 1820, and was the major source for Washington Irving's Astoria . This English translation by Jedediah Vincent Huntington, edited by Huntington and Michel Bibaud, contains an additional chapter and appendix by Franchère, the latter providing further information regarding the fate of other members of the expedition.\n\nCowan p. 90.

The record of Franklin's first Arctic expedition, fraught with hardship and tragedy, constitutes one of the classics in the annals of travel literature. In all, the party travelled 5,500 miles overland and with the aid of canoes, exploring the territory from York Factory to the mouth of the Coppermine River on Coronation Gulf, east along the Arctic coast as far as Point Turnagain, and back across the Barren Lands. Provisions were poor and scant, and on the return journey, many crew members died of cold and starvation; the young naval artist Robert Hood was murdered and another executed for the crime. The work also includes accounts by Richardson and Back (pp. 449-61, 477-90) of the last leg of the desperate journey across the Barren Lands, as well as a valuable appendix on the natural history of the region and scientific observations on the aurora borealis and the magnetic needle, by Richardson, Hood, Franklin and Sabine.\n\nNational Maritime Museum I 828.

Franklin's second overland expedition in 1825-27 formed part of a double-pronged assault on the western approaches to the Arctic, undertaken in conjunction with Beechey's voyage to Bering's Strait. The expedition proceeded across North-western Canada to Fort Franklin on Great Slave Lake, and down the Mackenzie to its mouth. There a party under Richardson and Kendall split to explore eastward along the coast to the mouth of the Coppermine, while Franklin and Back headed westward along the coast toward Kotzebue Sound where they were to join up with Beechey. Franklin, however, turned back at Return Reef at about 149 ° west, while one of Beechey's vessels managed to penetrate only as far as Point Barrow, several hundred miles away. The narrative includes descriptions of the country traversed and of encounters with Esquimaux, notes on weather conditions, the Dogrib Indians, the burning coal cliffs beyond Cape Bathurst, &c.\n\nAbbey, Travel , 635.

Although the authenticity of the narrative suffers slightly from the revisions made by the moralistic editor, Daniel Haskel, Harmon's journal remains one of the most important accounts of the fur-trade and the Canadian north-west. Harmon, in the employ of the North West Company, spent nineteen years among the aboriginals in the Swan River, Athabaska, Nipigon, and Rainy River districts, 1800-19. The map is based on that of Alexander Mackenzie drawn by Arrowsmith, but with some additions and corrections. It shows the country between Quebec and the north-west coast, with designations for the territories occupied by the various native tribes. The narrative is followed by ‘An Account of the Indians Living West of the Rocky Mountain', ‘A General Account of the Indians on the East Side of the Rocky Mountain', vocabularies of the Cree and the Tacully or Carrier Tongue, and ‘A Concise Account of the Principle Animals Which are Found in the North Western Part of North America'.\n\nBell H42.

Hearne's journal holds an especially honoured place in the annals of Arctic exploration, and Hearne “will always be remembered as the first white man that ever gazed on the dreary expanse of the Arctic or Frozen Ocean from the northern shores of the Continent of America.” (Rich) In 1769, he was sent by the Hudson's Bay Company to find a north-west passage from Hudson's Bay and to investigate Indian reports regarding the existence of copper deposits to the north. Hearne made two false starts, but on his third attempt, accompanied by the Chipewyan guide Matonabbie, he succeeded in crossing the Barren Lands and reached the Coppermine River, which he descended to the Arctic Coast. Hearne also discovered the Great Slave Lake and recorded valuable information regarding the natural history and Indian tribes of the region traversed.\n\nShortly following his return, Hearne submitted his report to the Hudson's Bay Company, who kept it secret for some thirteen years. Its final publication, three years after his death, was due to the celebrated French navigator La Pérouse, who found Hearne's manuscript when he captured Fort Albany, Hudson's Bay, in 1781-82. When Fort Albany was subsequently surrendered to the British, La Pérouse stipulated, as one of the conditions of the surrender, that Hearne's manuscript be printed.\n\nBell H94. Cox I p. 171.

A classic of Canadian travel literature and one of the most vivid and authentic accounts of the fur trade in the Canadian West . Henry came to Canada shortly after the British conquest in 1760, and became one of the first fur traders from the British colonies to penetrate the Great Lakes region which was formerly controlled by the French . He spent sixteen years in the west, travelling as far as the valley of the Saskatchewan, before retiring to Montreal as a general merchant. His narrative includes a first-hand account of the Indian uprising of 1763 at Michilimackinac , one of the primary sources used by Francis Parkman when writing The Conspiracy of Pontiac . Henry himself narrowly escaped the massacre, but was subsequently captured and held prisoner by the northern Indians. The description of his lengthy captivity contains much valuable information regarding native manners and customs.\n\nBell H129. Field 686. Gagnon I 1652. Graff 1866. Howes H-420. Jones 732.

Hind, a professor of chemistry at the University of Toronto, was engaged as a geologist by the Canadian Government in 1857 and 1858 on the surveying expeditions which explored the country between Lake Superior and the Red River, and between the Red River and the south branch of the Saskatchewan. The exploration was conducted with the view to establishing the possibility of an emigrant route west from Lake Superior. This is Hind's personal account of the expeditions (official government reports were also issued), in which he devotes considerable detailed discussion to the habits and customs of the Cree and Chippeway Indians, with whom he lived virtually constantly during that period. The attractive chromoxylograph plates (wood engravings tinted from another engraved block in one, two or three colours) depict topographical views and scenes from Indian life. All of the illustrations are after photographs taken by Humphrey Lloyd Hime, photographer of the expedition, or after sketches by John Fleming, assistant surveyor and draughtsman.\n\nAbbey, Travel , 630.

A fine copy in modern quarter calf. [London: c1780]. $2,500\n\nLater issue of one of the most important reports on the Hudson's Bay Company. The parliamentary investigation into the activities of the Hudson's Bay Company was undertaken as a result of a petition made to the Lords in Council in 1749 aimed at depriving the Company of its charter. The petitioners argued that the charter of 1670, granting sole rights of trade and commerce in the entire area beyond the entrance of the Hudson Straits, was either invalid or forfeited, and requested an incorporation giving them similar rights over the adjacent region. Arthur Dobbs had provided the initial stimulus and basic grounding for the petition; his was the most sustained and vociferous attack on the meanness, rapacity, secrecy and jealousy of the Hudson's Bay Company, alleging that their policies and attitudes had thrown the fur trade into the hands of the French in Canada and were stifling the exploration of the Canadian North-West.\n\nAmong the travelers, traders and merchants summoned as witnesses to give testimony before the committee were Joseph Robson, Matthew Serjeant, Arthur Dobbs, and William Moore. Appended is the Hudson's Bay Company Charter as well as the valuable narrative of French Canadian fur trader Joseph La France, describing the state of the French fortresses in Montreal and Quebec, and their lucrative trade with the Indians. The Papers Presented to the Committee contain information regarding voyages undertaken in search of the north-west passage, sales made by the Hudson's Bay Company, Henry Kelsey's journals of his attempt to open commerce with the Naywatamee Indians in 1691-92, &c.\n\nAlthough the impeachment failed, and the monopoly was to continue for another hundred years, it did alarm the Company into initiating serious and concerted exploration of the unknown western reaches of the Charter.\n\nTPL 213.

London: Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans, and Roberts, 1859. $10,000\n\nFirst Edition of this fascinating record of the western travels of one of the most famous nineteenth century Canadian painters. Inspired by George Catlin, whom he met during a visit to Europe, Kane determined to sketch and paint a series of pictures illustrative of North American Indians and scenery. He set out for the west in June of 1845, “with no companions but [his] portfolio and box of paints, [his] gun, and a stock of ammunition”, spending the season in the Lake Huron and Lake Michigan region, chiefly among the Ojibway. For the next three years, he travelled further westward, mostly in company with Hudson's Bay Company fur trade brigades, through the territories of the Red River settlements and the valley of the Saskatchewan, across the Rocky Mountains, down the Columbia to Puget Sound, and north to Vancouver Island.\n\nKane brought back hundreds of detailed sketches: portraits of Indian chiefs, warriors, and medicine men, buffalo hunting and fishing scenes, portrayals of native dances and secret ceremonials, views of Hudson's Bay Company posts. Of the paintings which he executed from his sketches, the most important was the series of one hundred canvases commissioned by prominent Canadian financier and politician, George William Allan of Toronto. Eight of these, which are now in the Royal Ontario Museum, are reproduced as coloured lithographs in this narrative.\n\nCowan pp. 126-27. Field 811. Graff 2262. Howes K-7. Jones 1412. Lande 1258.

(Sabin)\n\nMackenzie's journals recount his two expeditions undertaken on behalf of the North West Company in its attempt to break the Hudson's Bay Company monopoly of the fur trade. The first expedition, in 1789, from Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabaska down what is now known as the Mackenzie River to the Arctic constitutes the first trip to the Arctic from the Canadian prairies ; the second, in 1792-93, from Fort Chipewyan over the Rocky Mountains by the Peace and Fraser Rivers to the Pacific, is distinguished as the first overland expedition to reach the Pacific, north of Mexico . The maps are the earliest done of certain parts of Canada. Also included is a lengthy account of the development of the fur trade in the North West, generally attributed to the author's cousin, Roderick Mackenzie.\n\nBell M20. Hill pp. 187-88. Howes M-133.

He retired in 1845 to Guelph, Ontario, where he wrote this book. Of particular value is the section dealing with the Labrador Peninsula, a little known area at the time, and one which McLean is credited with being the first white man to traverse in its entirely. There he discovered the Grand Falls on the Northwest River. The life and customs of the various Canadian native tribes and Esquimaux are described with some detail, especially in their relations with the Hudson's Bay Company. “One of the classics of wilderness travel.” (TPL)\n\nBell M30.

In 1856 Palliser submitted a proposal to the Royal Geographical Society outlining his plan to explore the southern prairies of British North America and adjacent passes through the Rocky Mountains. At the request of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, the plans were revised to include the old North West Company canoe route from Fort William to Red River. The expedition eventually received the official approval of the British government and an initial Treasury appropriation of 5,000 pounds.\n\nIncluded here are Palliser's instructions and eight reports on the progress of the expedition's explorations from Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains. “[Palliser's] reports...provided the first comprehensive, careful, and impartial observations to be published about the southern prairies and Rocky Mountains in what is now Canada ...They added considerably to geographical knowledge of the region, and established that an extensive “fertile belt”, well suited for stock-raising and cultivation, bordered the semi-arid prairie land to the south which is today known as “Palliser's Triangle”.” (DCB XI, pp. 663)\n\nThe accompanying maps and diagrams include a large folding map of the ‘...Country Between The Red River Settlement And The Rocky Mountains; showing the Various Routes of the Expedition...'.\n\nTPL 3928.
