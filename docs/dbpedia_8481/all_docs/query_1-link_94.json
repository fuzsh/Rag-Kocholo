Stein University of Rhode Island\n\nPOETRY OF JEWISH WORLD CULTURE Ancient Hebrew literature speaks to a long history of hardship and the desire to settle in a Jewish homeland. Over the centuries, Jewish poets have found themselves wandering far and wide, both literally and metaphorically. Poems written for the liturgy in ancient Palestine would later help to nurture the flowering of medieval poetry. During the Middle Ages, there was an extraordinary rekindling of Hebrew poetry, and thousands of the poems written during the medieval period found their way into the Jewish liturgy. This was possible because there already was a tradition established for the kind of poem that fit into the religious realm. Such a tradition did not exist when it came to writing for the secular world. Taking inspiration from the Bible and Arabic literature, Hebrew poetry eventually expanded into more popular themes of love and wine. Hebrew poets of the Middle Ages were also influenced by European forms of poetry such as the sonnet. Meter and rhyme schemes became more sophisticated in the hands of these newly emboldened poets. Some of this new, livelier verse was composed in Spain and Italy, where it became common for the same poet to write both doggerel and deeply philosophical verse, a poetic dexterity that was not as evident in the northern areas of Europe. The poets Samuel haNagid and Solomon ibn Gabirol wrote extraordinary secular and religious poetry during the eleventh century in Spain. Of all the Hebrew poets from Spain, the one who stands out as the greatest is Judah ha-Levi. He wrote with deep intensity about the things of God as well as the things of man. He believed in rejoicing and being a positive force. Poetry of Conviction The Jewish Enlightenment, known in Hebrew as the Haskalah, evolved as a movement during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It encouraged European Jews to broaden their interests in the secular world while also increasing their studies of Hebrew literature. Some of the poets who were most active in this movement are Judah Leib Gordon, Isaac Baer Levinsohn, and Constantin Shapiro. Born in Prussia at the end of the eighteenth century, Heinrich Heine would become a great German lyric poet. In 1827, he published one of his most riveting collections, Buch der Lieder (Book of Songs, 1856). Because of Prussian anti-Semitism, Heine moved to Paris in the early 1830’s, where he died in 1856. One of the most important Russian poets of the twentieth century is Osip Mandelstam, born in Warsaw, Poland, and educated in St. Petersburg, Russia. His first collection, Kamen (Stone, 1981), was published in 1913. In 1922, he published the startling collection Tristia (English translation, 1973), in which he writes eloquently about the purpose of life itself. Living in Russia during great turmoil and the rise of Joseph Stalin, Mandelstam was faced with issues of personal integrity. He was even so bold as to write 1\n\nPoetry of Jewish World Culture\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\na poem that was critical of Stalin. At the end of the poem, known as “Poem no. 286 (on Stalin),” the poet bluntly states: He forges decrees like horseshoes—decrees and decrees: This one gets it in the balls, that one in the forehead, him right between the eyes. Whenever he’s got a victim, he glows like a broadchested Georgian munching a raspberry.\n\nFor this act, Mandelstam was arrested and sent into exile. He suffered from terrible episodes of deep depression but still continued to write. In 1938, he was sentenced to five years in a labor camp. He died in a transit camp near Vladivostok, most likely on December 27, 1938. Tristan Tzara (born Samuel Rosenstock) and Hugo Ball were two of the principal founders of Dadaism in 1916. This artistic and literary movement rejected everything about traditional bourgeois society, which Tzara held responsible for World War I. He recognized that his Jewishness set him apart, but he was determined to place all of his faith in his own poetic imagination. Two of the greatest World War I poets were the English poets Isaac Rosenberg and Siegfried Sassoon. Rosenberg’s parents had been forced to leave Lithuania by the increasingly common violence against Jews. Both Rosenberg and Sassoon would write haunting poetry about the terrifying nature of trench warfare. Sassoon survived the war, but Rosenberg was killed in 1918. The poet Karl Kraus, born in Bohemia and educated in Vienna, would go on to satirize much of the liberal intelligentsia of Austria. He had left Judaism by the end of the nineteenth century and went so far as to believe that Jews were in some way responsible for anti-Semitism. He joined the Catholic Church, but in 1922 would turn away from that organization as well. Klaus was known for being a wonderful German stylist, and his lyric poetry was published as Worte in Versen in nine volumes between 1916 and 1930. Poetry as Shelter from Every Storm In order to escape Romanian anti-Semitism, Irving Layton’s Jewish parents moved his family to Canada in 1913. Born Israel Pincu Lazarovitch, the young Layton would grow up poor in Montreal. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism was also a problem in French Canada. Layton published his first volume of poetry in 1945. A prolific poet, he was very forthright about his views on religion, politics, and cultural matters. He had been schooled in the Old Testament and believed in the struggle to make life better, to make it whole. Itzik Manger was born in 1901 in Czernowitz, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He began writing Yiddish poetry when he was still a teenager, and also wrote drama, long fiction, and nonfiction. Manger was a master at modernizing biblical sto2\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nPoetry of Jewish World Culture\n\nries. Anti-Semitism forced him to leave his home in Warsaw, while his father and younger brother died in concentration camps. He lived in Paris, England, and the United States before finally settling in Israel in 1958. At the time of his death in 1969, Manger was considered to be Israel’s national poet. Another Jewish poet born in Romania and forced to leave his birth country was Paul Celan, born Paul Antschel in 1920. He suffered from anti-Semitism at the Romanian state school that he attended. Celan worked as a field surgeon in a psychiatric unit during World War II, while his parents perished in a concentration camp. Throughout the rest of his life, he felt great guilt for having survived the war, and he drowned in the Seine River in 1970 in what is believed to have been a suicide. Celan’s poetry, inspired by the work of the French Symbolists and the German expressionists, is difficult to penetrate. After all that he had endured, language became the only refuge that he had left, and he exhibits this love of language in such collections as Von Schwelle zu Schwelle (1955; From Threshold to Threshold, 1988), Sprachgitter (1959; Speech-Grille and Other Poems, 1971; also as Language Mesh, 1988), and Die Niemandsrose (1963; The No-one’s Rose, 1988). Yehuda Amichai was born in Germany in 1924. His Orthodox Jewish family moved to Palestine when he was twelve years old. Amichai published his first Hebrew poetry in the 1950’s. Writing in Hebrew provided his poetry a footing in both the ancient biblical tradition and the more modern secular world. Another important Israeli poet is the Romanian-born Holocaust survivor Dan Pagis, who endured the horrors of a Ukrainian concentration camp and went on to write harrowing poetry about the unspeakable experiences of his youth. Jewish poets have had to endure hatred from the outside world as well as within their own hearts. Whether schooled in Hebrew, Yiddish, or some other European tongue, they have tried to exist as the sum of many parts. Through it all, these poets have taken refuge in the power of words and worked to construct a future on their own terms.

Coming from Europe in order to escape persecution and to work for a better future in a new land, these poets still remained connected to their faith and heritage. Out of their hardship was shaped a unique Jewish literary tradition, one that respects learning, language, mythology, and family. A rich poetry has emerged from this long tradition. While Jewish tales, novels, and nonfiction are generally given a favorable reading by scholars and the public alike, the same cannot be said of poetry. It has been said that poetry is a marginal literary form at best, one that does not always present itself as “user friendly.” Poetry can be puzzling, provocative, and downright irritating. The scholar Maeera Shrieber has bluntly surmised that poetry is simply too explosive for its own good. The American Language poet Charles Bernstein states that poetry is “an agent of turbulent thought.” Jewish American poets have not been deterred, however. They have been active participants in the American dream since their arrival on North American shores, although the first Jewish immigrants were originally unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the English language; they came to America with the sacred language of Hebrew in their hearts and the Yiddish language on their tongues. While new immigrants produced prayers in Hebrew and social commentary in Yiddish, it would take time before the new Jewish American writers could successfully create in their adopted language. While a Jewish literary tradition can be traced as far back as colonial America, Jewish poetry has a far shorter history. At the time of the American Revolution, less than three thousand Jews were living in the colonies. The great migration of Jews from Europe took place during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Historical records indicate that Penina Mo{iuml}se’s Fancy’s Sketch Book (1833) is probably the first poetry collection by a Jewish American to be published in the United States. It is Emma Lazarus, however, who must be considered the most important Jewish American poet of the nineteenth century. Her poetry has a richness of spirit and social purpose and serves as a link to the poetry that would be written by Jewish American poets during the coming century. Time for a New Language By the early twentieth century, Jewish American poets had made the English language their own. Charles Reznikoff published his first collection, Rhythms, in 1918. It was obvious from this first collection that Reznikoff did not wish to perpetuate the poetic norms of the nineteenth century. His work contained a matter-of-fact realism that 5\n\nPoetry of Jewish American Culture\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nwas more akin to prose writing than to traditional poetry, and he incorporated much from the immigrant experience into his verse, blending the Bible and immigrant traditions with what he experienced growing up in New York City. He has been grouped with the Objectivists of the 1930’s, along with George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, and Louis Zukofsky. For them, everything they wrote about had to be presented as objectively as possible. Even the poem itself became an object. During the years of the Great Depression, a young Delmore Schwartz wrote with passionate intensity about the gloom that seemed to pervade the times. In his 1938 collection In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, he speaks of dreams being dashed by circumstances beyond a person’s control. The themes of exile and alienation have been common in much of Jewish American literature, and it is no different for Schwartz. He was born in Brooklyn in 1913 and grew up trying to find his place in America. His parents, immigrants from Eastern Europe, had trouble with the English language. Although he proved his brilliance at an early age, he struggled with personal demons, and tragically died in 1966 after suffering a heart attack. In such poems as “The Heavy Bear Who Goes with Me” and “A Dog Named Ego,” the poet speaks of the gap that exists between the spirit and the flesh. For Schwartz, it seems as though the better self inevitably is defeated by the weaker, grotesque self. While Stanley Kunitz, two-time United States poet laureate, understood that tragedy is an integral part of life, he never fell prey to it or became a victim. As a poet, Kunitz always presented the face of survival. In his examinations of the human experience, he stood firm in his belief that the creative act does make a difference. In one of his most recognized poems, “Father and Son,” Kunitz speaks to what maturity really means. Time for Something Bold Since the 1950’s, American poetry has been in the throes of reinventing itself. As one of the leading Beat movement poets, Allen Ginsberg dramatically changed the poetic landscape with the publication of his poem “Howl” in 1956. The poem concerns itself with friends, family, America, the Old Testament, and much more. Ginsberg recognized that he was an outcast in society not only for being a provocative poet but also for being Jewish and gay. In the poem “Kaddish,” he examines the reality of his own mother as well as the mythology of the Jewish mother. Other Jewish American poets who have contributed greatly to American poetry include Karl Shapiro, John Hollander, Charles Bernstein, Albert Goldbarth, Anthony Hecht, Howard Nemerov, Philip Levine, Robert Pinsky, and countless others. Each of these poets found their own profound way to incorporate their heritage, their history, and their mythology into the poetry that they have written. Some of the most inventive and perceptive American poetry has been written by Jewish women. One of the most unique and bold female poets is Gertrude Stein. Ever the experimenter, in art as well as in life, Stein relished the endless possibilities that lan6\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nPoetry of Jewish American Culture\n\nguage provided her. In addition to Stein, several other Jewish American women poets have charted an independent course for themselves, including Muriel Rukeyser, Marilyn Hacker, Denise Levertov, Alicia Suskin Ostriker, Marge Piercy, and Adrienne Rich. Taking inspiration from Allen Ginsberg’s poetry of self-exploration, these women have expanded the scope of where poetry can go. For Rich, being Jewish, a feminist, and a lesbian are all part of her poetic mix. It is important for her and other female activist poets to build a language that incorporates all these parts and more. Her 1973 collection Diving into the Wreck won the 1974 National Book Award for Poetry. In this volume, Rich alters Western civilization’s heroic myth in order to demonstrate that women can be strong and accomplish much on their own. Jewish American poets continue to probe their past and question how best to use poetry in order to communicate with the larger community. The desire to have poetry connect in a relevant way to as many people as possible across America is what drives most poets. As Philip Levine said after he was named the United States Poet Laureate in 2011, “I want to bring poetry to people who have no idea how relevant poetry is to their lives.” This is the American dream for poets who do not believe that alienation is forever.

Bell also collaborated with poet William Stafford on two books, Segues: A Correspondence in Poetry (1983) and AnnieOver (1988). He also made a sound recording of The Self and the Mulberry Tree (1977) for the Watershed Foundation. His poetry has appeared in many anthologies, and in 1998, he published some of his collected poems in Wednesday: Selected Poems, 19661997 in Ireland. Bell has extensive editing experience, first with Statements (1959-1964), which he founded, and later as poetry editor for the North American Review (1964-1969) and the Iowa Review (1969-1971). Partly because of his long association with the Iowa Review and the University of Iowa, he was twice interviewed at length by the editors of the Iowa Review: in the winter edition of 1981 and in the fall issue of 2000. Achievements Marvin Bell has steadily acquired critical acclaim. He won the James Laughlin Award from the Academy of American Poets for A Probable Volume of Dreams and the Bess Hokin Award from Poetry magazine, both in 1969; the Emily Clark Balch Prize 8\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nBell, Marvin\n\nfrom the Virginia Quarterly Review in 1970; and the prestigious Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994. He was also the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship (1976) and National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships (1978 and 1984). He has twice held Senior Fulbright Scholarships (Yugoslavia, 1983; Australia, 1986) and has served as visiting professor at several universities. In 1986, his alma mater, Alfred University, awarded him the Lh.D., and in 2000, he was named the first poet laureate in Iowa; he served two terms. Biography Marvin Hartley Bell was born in New York City but spent his childhood in Center Moriches, a small Long Island town sixty miles from Manhattan. His parents, Saul Bell and Belle Bell, were the children of Russian Jews who had emigrated to escape persecution. In his boyhood, Bell played on soccer, baseball, and basketball teams, became a ham radio operator, and played the trumpet in a jazz group. His early writing experience consisted of writing a column about school events for the local weekly newspaper. After high school, Bell attended Alfred University in upstate New York. There he continued with his trumpet playing in the university orchestra; worked for the yearbook and Fiat Lux, the weekly newspaper, which he edited his senior year; and became interested in ceramics and photography. Bell was initially more attracted to journalism than to literature, and when he found appropriate political causes (discriminatory clauses in sororities and fraternities, for example), he wrote and mimeographed an underground newsletter. After graduation from Alfred, Bell enrolled in the graduate journalism school at Syracuse University, where he met Al Sampson, who became a lifelong friend, and Mary (Mickey) Mammosser, who became his first wife. The couple then moved to Rochester, where they founded Statements, a journal that enabled them to include both literature and photography. At the urging of Sampson, who was now studying literature at the University of Chicago, the Bells moved to Chicago in 1958. Bell enrolled in the M.A. program in English at the University of Chicago, continued to publish Statements (five issues ultimately appeared), wrote poems, and did still photography. His marriage to Mickey ended after the birth of their son Nathan, who stayed with Bell. He later married Dorothy Murphy, with whom he had another son, Jason, in 1966. Bell comments, “My story since 1960 is forever woven together with the stories of Dorothy, Nathan, and Jason.” The three often appear in Bell’s poems. While in Chicago, Bell took a writing seminar with John Logan, who had encouraged Bell to contribute an article and a photograph to Choice, which Logan had just founded. When Logan recommended the Writers’ Workshop in Iowa, Bell applied for the doctoral program at the University of Iowa and was accepted. Studying with Donald Justice and Paul Engel, Bell writes, “In the midst of a swirl of literary fellowship, I still 9\n\nBell, Marvin\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nfelt that I was following my own road.” Bell, however, left Iowa to go on active duty with the U.S. Army (he had been in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program at Alfred) in 1965. After his military tour of duty, Bell returned to Iowa City, where he taught with Justice and George Starbuck in the Writers’ Workshop. After 1966, when his first volume of poems appeared, Bell published a poetry volume about every three years, while also serving as poetry editor for the North American Review (1964-1969) and the Iowa Review (1969-1971). He continued to teach at Iowa until 2005, but he also taught abroad and at other universities in the United States. After 1985, he divided his time between Iowa and Port Townsend, Washington, where he bought a house. In the 1990’s, a series of fellowships took him to several universities and colleges, including the University of Redlands (1991-1993), St. Mary’s College of California (1994-1995), Nebraska-Wesleyan University (1996-1997), and Pacific University (1996-1997) in Oregon, where he also taught in the M.F.A. graduate program. He frequently acts as judge for various writing competitions. He was named the first poet laureate of Iowa in 2000 and served two terms. Analysis The dominant themes and motivations of Marvin Bell’s poetry perhaps can be best understood by hearing him speak of his own work. Discussing his personal aesthetic, he told Wayne Dodd and Stanley Plumly in an Ohio Review interview, I would like to write poetry which finds salvation in the physical world and the here and now and which defines the soul, if you will, in terms of emotional depth, and that emotional depth in terms of the physical world and the world of human relationships.\n\nIndeed, Bell is a poet of the family and the relationships within. He writes of his father, his wives, his sons, and himself in a dynamic interaction of love and loss, accomplishment, and fear of alienation. These are subjects that demand maturity and constant evaluation. Bell’s oeuvre highlights his ability to understand the durability of the human heart. As a son of a Jew who immigrated from Ukraine, Bell writes of distance and reconciliation between people, often touching on his complex relationship to his heritage. While concern with the self and its relationships provides a focal point in Bell’s early poetry, many of his poems have crystallized around a reflection on the self in relation to nature, evident in collections such as Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See. Growing up among farmers, Bell has always felt nature to be an integral part of his life. The rural life that so fascinated other writers during the 1960’s back-to-nature movement was not Bell’s inspiration. Rather, nature forms a critical backdrop for events and relationships in his life, and in that sense, he says, “I am interested in allowing nature to have the place in my poems that it always had in my life.” Bell further notes that 10\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nBell, Marvin\n\ncontemporary American poetry has been tiresome in its discovery of the individual self, over and over and over, and its discovery of emotions that, indeed, we all have: loneliness, fear, despair, ennui. . . . I think it can get tiresome when the discovery of such emotions is more or less all the content there is to a poem. I think, as I may not always have thought, that the only way out of the self is to concentrate on others and on things outside the self.\n\nThus, Bell has evolved his ability to perceive and praise small wonders in a quiet and reserved fashion and, as one critic noted, “has found within his own voice that American voice, and with it the ability to write convincingly about the smallest details of a personal history.” A Probable Volume of Dreams “An Afterword to My Father,” which ironically begins A Probable Volume of Dreams, is a fairly typical early Bell poem. The “probable” part of the book’s title and the placement of an “afterword” at the beginning of a poem reflect Bell’s characteristic ambiguity and uncertainty. Not so much “enough,” there is more to be done, yes, and to be done with. You were the sun and moon. Now darkness loves me; the lights come on.\n\nHere Bell uses cliches, an allusion (“done”) to Donne, and metaphors (father as sun and moon). What remains to be “done” must also be “done with,” moved beyond. The father, a recurrent image in Bell’s poems, was the poet’s source of light; the darkness that follows the father’s death now provides light, but what is illumined is not stated, nor is it necessarily positive. Escape into You Escape into You chronicles the breaking up of a marriage and a poet’s gradual coming to terms not only with a wife and sons but also with himself. As Arthur Oberg puts it, the poems describe “a poetic self that is still learning to bury the dead and to walk among the living.” “Homage to the Runner,” also the title of a column Bell wrote, is about running, one of Bell’s athletic outlets, but also about poetry and how poetry affects others. Running and poetry both involve “pain,” and “the love of form is a black occasion/ through which some light must show/ in a hundred years of commitment.” While there is “some light,” the occasion is “black.” The runner and poet “ache” to end the race and poem, which begin in darkness, but there “is no finish; you can stop [running or writing] for no one,” not even family, as much as you care for them. 11\n\nBell, Marvin\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nResidue of Song Residue of Song contains thirteen poems to Bell’s father and concerns loneliness. “Residue of Song” begins with “you were writing a long poem, yes,/ about marriage, called ‘On Loneliness.’” Like the “probable” in his A Probable Volume of Dreams, the “residue” also undercuts its subject matter. In fact, in “Residue of Dreams” “you” decide not to write the poem. In Bell’s poem it is the speaker who is the lonely one as he describes a woman’s egotism and violence and his callous responses to her; but, as is usually the case with Bell, the poem ends in bittersweet acceptance of the “residue” in a relationship: Your cries, for ecstatic madness, are not sadder than some things. From the residue of song, I have barely said my love again, as if for the last time, believing that you will leave me.\n\nThe use of “barely” and “as if” is part of Bell’s tendency to qualify, to undercut, and to leave meaning implied but not defined. Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See contains poems about Dorothy, Bell’s wife, but also includes several poems about poetry. In his “To a Solitary Reader,” an allusion to William Wordsworth’s poem about the solitary reaper, Bell discusses the development of his poetry: “If once he slept with Donne/ (happily) now he sleeps/ with Williams/ the old Williams.” Bell thereby indicates his movement from John Donne’s metaphysical style to William Carlos Williams’s stress on a poem being, rather than meaning. The remainder of the poem distinguishes between “memory,” which is what we “are” in the sense that “they/ think they know us,” and what our “being” is, that which is inexplicable, without meaning. The poem concludes, “Time’s determinant./ Once I knew you.” Bell leaves behind certainty and memory and instead embraces the idea that nothing can be “known.” These Green-Going-to-Yellow In the title poem of These Green-Going-to Yellow the poet states, “I’m raising the emotional ante” by attempting to align himself with nature, particularly the leaves of a gingko tree someone planted in New York City. The poem concerns people’s perspectives on life and asks if they really see beauty. Of course, the answer is “no.” People look down “not to look up” and “look at the middles of things.” Comfortable with mediocrity, like the seasons, people go from green to yellow, age like autumn, and lose their creative powers. Bell declares that people’s perspective would be different “if we truly thought that we were gods.” This line denies people even an erroneous presumption about their place in the universe, but in his acceptance of the situation Bell somehow remains “green.” He has said, “I started out green and I intended to remain so.” 12\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nBell, Marvin\n\nThe Book of the Dead Man and Ardor In the Dead Man poems in The Book of the Dead Man and Ardor, Bell moves in a new direction, adopting a persona or mask that he often denies but on at least one occasion accepts: “He was my particular and my universal./ I leave it to the future to say why.” The Dead Man has enabled Bell to erase distinctions such as the one between life and death. In “About the Dead Man” the poet writes, “He [the Dead Man] thinks himself alive because he has no future.” Statements like this, especially when they are preceded by and followed by other seemingly unrelated statements, would appear to be incredibly complicated, but Bell asserts that they are complex, rather than complicated. Complexity, for him, is “the fabric of life and the character of emotion.” In his poetry things “connect,” even if the connections are not always apparent to the reader. The “Baby Hamlet” poem in this section embodies Bell’s ideas about complexity, which requires “a fusion of many elements, some of them seemingly disparate, even contradictory.” Hamlet’s indecision is fused with the world’s indecision, its “hopeless pacifism” and the “Platonic ideal carried to its logical inconclusion.” According to Bell, “It doesn’t seem a stretch to me to parallel Hamlet’s indecision with the world’s reluctance to act early and decisively against the Nazis.” After all, “events occur while waiting for the news./ Or stuck in moral neutral.” Other major works nonfiction: Old Snow Just Melting: Essays and Interviews, 1983. miscellaneous: Segues: A Correspondence in Poetry, 1983 (with William Stafford); Annie-Over, 1988 (with Stafford). Bibliography Bell, Marvin. “An Interview with Marvin Bell.” Interview by David Hamilton. Iowa Review 30 (Fall, 2000): 3-22. Because Bell was the first poetry editor for the Iowa Review, which interviewed him in 1981, this review provides an excellent overview of Bell’s writing career. Hamilton discusses the development of the Dead Man poems, beginning with Iris of Creation with later appearances in A Marvin Bell Reader (1994). These lead to The Book of the Dead Man and Ardor. The Resurrected Dead Man first appeared in Wednesday (1997), published in Ireland. Hamilton describes the Dead Man as “an archetypal figure with sacramental dimensions.” Bell distinguishes between the two figures by stating that a Dead Man poem is a field, but a Resurrected Dead Man poem is a path: “I go first. If you want to follow me, you have to stay on the path.” _______. “My Twenties in Chicago: A Memoir.” TriQuarterly 60 (Spring/Summer, 1984): 118-126.

Harp, Jerry. “Inexactly Dead: On Marvin Bell’s Mars Being Red.” Pleiades 28, no. 2 (2008): 177-183. A thorough review of Bell’s 2007 poetry collection Mars Being Red. Examines how many of the poems in this book are “extended meditation[s] on multiple senses of time, as well as on the times.” Jackson, Richard. “Containing the Other: Marvin Bell’s Recent Poetry.” North American Poetry Review 280 (January/February, 1995): 45-48. Jackson focuses on The Book of the Dead Man, which he finds rich in complexity. For Jackson, Bell extends his emphasis on inclusiveness and counterpointing in the Dead Man poems. The book begins with poems about feeling and sensing, moves to dreams and the psychic life, and concludes “with two poems about our relation to the cosmos.” Jackson finds in Bell’s poetry the joy of life. Kitchen, Judith. “‘I Gotta Use Words. . . .’” Georgia Review 51 (Winter, 1997): 756. Kitchen believes that in the Dead Man poems, Bell has found “a liberating spirit, someone who could serve his poetic innovation.” She finds Ardor, not surprisingly, more passionate than The Book of the Dead Man and sees Bell moving from a forward look at death to a backward look at life. As a result, she claims, the poems in the later book to be a cohesive whole, to be able to create a contextual world and then provide a “take” on that world. For her, Bell is sending poetry into new and original territory. Thomas L.

His only piece of prose fiction, if indeed it can be so described, is “Gespräch im Gebirg” (1959), a very short autobiographical story with a religious theme. Celan also wrote an introductory essay for a book containing works by the painter Edgar Jené; this essay, entitled Edgar Jené und der Traum vom Traume, (1948; Edgar Jené and the Dream About 15\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nthe Dream, 1986), is an important early statement of Celan’s aesthetic theory. Another, more oblique, statement of Celan’s poetic theory is contained in his famous speech, “Der Meridian” (1960), given on his acceptance of the prestigious Georg Büchner Prize. (An English translation of this speech, “The Meridian,” was published in the Winter, 1978, issue of Chicago Review.) Achievements Paul Celan is considered an “inaccessible” poet by many critics and readers. This judgment, prompted by the difficulties Celan’s poetry poses for would-be interpreters seeking traditional exegesis, is reinforced by the fact that Celan occupies an isolated position in modern German poetry. Sometimes aligned with Nelly Sachs, Ernst Meister, and the German Surrealists, Celan’s work nevertheless stands apart from that of his contemporaries. A Jew whose outlook was shaped by his early experiences in Nazi-occupied Romania, Celan grew up virtually trilingual. The horror of his realization that he was, in spite of his childhood experiences and his later residence in France, a German poet was surely responsible in part for his almost obsessive concern with the possibilities and the limits of his poetic language. Celan’s literary ancestors are Friedrich Hölderlin, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Rainer Maria Rilke, and the German expressionists, but even in his early poems his position as an outsider is manifest. Celan’s poems, called Hermetic by some critics because of their resistance to traditional interpretation, can be viewed sometimes as intense and cryptic accounts of personal experience, sometimes as religious-philosophical discussions of Judaism, its tradition and its relation to Christianity. Many of his poems concern themselves with linguistic and poetic theory to the point where they cease to be poems in the traditional sense, losing all contact with the world of physical phenomena and turning into pure language, existing only for themselves. Such “pure” poems, increasingly frequent in Celan’s later works, are largely responsible for the charge of inaccessibility that has been laid against him. Here the reader is faced with having to leave the dimension of conventional language use, where the poet uses language to communicate with his audience about subjects such as death or nature, and is forced to enter the dimension of metalanguage, as Harald Weinrich calls it, where language is used to discuss only language—that is, the word “death,” and not death itself. Such poems are accessible only to readers who share with the poet the basic premises of an essentially linguistic poetic theory. In spite of all this, much of Celan’s poetry can be made accessible to the reader through focus on the personal elements in some poems, the Judaic themes in others, and by pointing out the biblical and literary references in yet another group. Biography Paul Celan was born Paul Ancel, or Antschel, the only child of Jewish parents, in Czernowitz, Romania (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine), in Bukovina, situated in the foothills 16\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nof the Carpathian Mountains. This region had been under Austrian rule and thus contained a sizable German-speaking minority along with a mix of other nationalities and ethnic groups. In 1918, just two years before Celan’s birth, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bukovina became part of Romania. Thus, Celan was reared in a region of great cultural and linguistic diversity, the tensions of which energized his poetry. Little is known of Celan’s early childhood, but he appears to have had a very close relationship with his mother and a less satisfying relationship with his father. Positive references to his mother abound in his poems, whereas his father is hardly mentioned. After receiving his high school diploma, the young Celan went to study medicine in France in 1938, but the war forced his return in the following year to Czernowitz, where he turned to the study of Romance languages and literature at the local university. In 1940, his hometown was annexed by the Soviet Union but was soon occupied by the Germans and their allies, who began to persecute and deport the Jewish population. Celan’s parents were taken to a concentration camp, where they both died, while the young man remained hidden for some time and finally ended up in a forced-labor camp. These events left a permanent scar on Celan’s memory, and it appears that he had strong feelings of guilt for having survived when his parents and so many of his friends and relatives were murdered. After Soviet troops reoccupied his hometown, he returned there for a short time and then moved to Bucharest, where he found work as an editor and a translator. In 1947, his first poems were published in a Romanian journal under the anagrammatic pen name Paul Celan. In the same year, he moved to Vienna, where he remained until 1948, when his first collection of poetry, Der Sand aus den Urnen, was published. After moving to Paris in the same year, Celan began to frequent avant-garde circles and was received particularly well by the poet Yvan Goll and his wife. Unfortunately, this friendship soured after Goll’s death in 1950, when Goll’s wife, Claire, apparently jealous of Celan’s growing reputation as a poet, accused him of having plagiarized from her husband. A bitter feud resulted, with many of the leading poets and critics in France and Germany taking sides. During this period, Celan also began his work as a literary translator, which was to be a major source of both income and poetic inspiration for the rest of his life. He translated from the French—notably the writings of Rimbaud, Paul Valéry, and Guillaume Apollinaire—as well as the poetry of William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, and Marianne Moore from the English and the works of Aleksandr Blok, Sergei Esenin, and Osip Mandelstam from the Russian. In the following years, Celan married a French graphic artist, Gisèle Lestrange, and published his second volume of poetry, Mohn und Gedächtnis (poppy and memory), containing many poems from his first collection, Der Sand aus den Urnen, which he had withdrawn from circulation because of the large number of printing mistakes and editorial inaccuracies it contained. Mohn und Gedächtnis established his reputation as a poet, 17\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nand most of his subsequent collections were awarded prestigious literary prizes. Celan remained in Paris for the rest of his life, infrequently traveling to Germany. During his later years, he appears to have undergone many crises both in his personal and in his creative life (his feud with Claire Goll is only one such incident), and his friends agree that he became quarrelsome and felt persecuted by neo-Nazis, hostile publishers, and critics. His death in April of 1970, apparently by suicide—he drowned in the Seine—was the consequence of his having arrived, in his own judgment, at a personal and artistic dead end, although many critics have seen in his collections Lightduress, Snow Part, and Zeitgehöft, published post humously, the potential beginning of a new creative period. Analysis Paul Celan’s poetry can be viewed as an expressive attempt to cope with the past— his personal past as well as that of the Jewish people. Close friends of the poet state that Celan was unable to forget anything and that trivial incidents and cataclysmic events of the past for him had the same order of importance. Many of his poems contain references to the death camps, to his dead parents (particularly his mother), and to his changing attitude toward the Jewish religion and toward God. In his early collections, these themes are shaped into traditional poetic form—long, often rhymed lines, genitive metaphors, sensuous images—and the individual poems are accessible to conventional methods of interpretation. In his later collections, Celan employs increasingly sparse poetic means, such as one-word lines, neologisms, and images that resist traditional interpretive sense; their significance can often be intuited only by considering Celan’s complete poetic opus, a fact that has persuaded many critics and readers that Celan’s poems are nonsense, pure games with language rather than codified expressions of thoughts and feelings that can be deciphered by applying the appropriate key. Mohn und Gedächtnis Mohn und Gedächtnis, Celan’s first collection of poetry (discounting the withdrawn Der Sand aus den Urnen), was in many ways an attempt to break with the past. The title of the collection is an indication of the dominant theme of these poems, which stress the dichotomy of forgetting—one of the symbolic connotations of the poppy flower—and remembering, by which Celan expresses his wish to forget the past, both his own personal past and that of the Jewish race, and his painful inability to erase these experiences from his memory. Living in Paris, Celan believed that only by forgetting could he begin a new life—in a new country, with a non-Jewish French wife, and by a rejection of his past poetic efforts, as indicated by the withdrawal of his first collection. Mohn und Gedächtnis is divided into four parts and contains a total of fifty-six poems. In the first part, “Der Sand aus den Urnen” (“Sand from the Urns”), Celan establishes the central theme of the collection: The poet “fills the urns of the past in the 18\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nmoldy-green house of oblivion” and is reminded by the white foliage of an aspen tree that his mother’s hair was not allowed to turn white. Mixed with these reflections on personal losses are memories of sorrows and defeats inflicted on the Jewish people; references to the conquest of Judea by the Romans are meant to remind the reader of more recent atrocities committed by foreign conquerors. The second part of Mohn und Gedächtnis is a single poem, “Todesfuge” (“Death Fugue”), Celan’s most widely anthologized poem, responsible in no small part for establishing his reputation as one of the leading con temporary German poets. “Death Fugue” is a monologue by the victims of a concentration camp, evoking in vivid images the various atrocities associated with these camps. From the opening line, “Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown . . .”—one of the lines that Claire Goll suggested Celan had plagiarized from her husband—the poem passes on to descriptions of the cruel camp commander who plays with serpent-like whips, makes the inmates shovel their own graves, and sets his pack of dogs on them. From the resignation of the first lines, the poem builds to an emotional climax in the last stanza in which the horror of the cremation chambers is indicated by images such as “he grants us a grave in the air” and “death is a master from Germany.” Although most critics have praised the poem, some have condemned Celan for what they interpret as an attempt at reconciliation between Germans and Jews in the last two lines of the poem. Others, however, notably Theodor Adorno, have attacked “Death Fugue” on the basis that it is “barbaric” to write beautiful poetry after, and particularly about, Auschwitz. A close reading of this long poem refutes the notion that Celan was inclined toward reconciliation with the Germans—his later work bears this out—and it is hard to imagine that any reader should feel anything but horror and pity for the anonymous speakers of the poem. The beautifully phrased images serve to increase the intensity of this horror rather than attempting to gloss it over. “Death Fugue” is both a great poem and one of the most impressive and lasting documents of the plight of the Jews. “Auf Reisen” (“Travel”), the first poem of the third part of the collection, again indicates Celan’s wish to leave the past behind and to start all over again in his “house in Paris.” In other poems he makes reference to his wife, asking to be forgiven for having broken with his heritage and married a Gentile. As the title of the collection suggests, the poppy of oblivion is not strong enough to erase the memory of his dead mother, of his personal past, and of his racial heritage. In poems such as “Der Reisekamerad” (“The Traveling Companion”) and “Zähle die Mandeln” (“Count the Almonds”), the optimistic view of “Travel” is retracted; in the former, the dead mother is evoked as the poet’s constant travel companion, while in the latter, he acknowledges that he must always be counted among the “almonds.” The almonds (Mandeln) represent the Jewish people and are an indirect reference also to the Russian Jewish poet Osip Mandelstam, whose work Celan had translated. The irreconcilable tension between the wish to forget and the inability to do so completely is further shown in “Corona,” a poem referring to Rainer 19\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nMaria Rilke’s “Herbsttag” (“Autumn Day”). Whereas the speaker of Rilke’s poem resigns himself to the approaching hardships of winter, Celan converts Rilke’s “Lord: it is time” into the rebellious “it is time that the stone condescended to bloom.” The poems in Mohn und Gedächtnis are not, for the most part, innovative in form or imagery, although the long dactylic lines and the flowery images of the first half begin to give way to greater economy of scope and metaphor in the later poems. There is a constant dialogue with a fictional “you” and repeated references to “night,” “dream,” “sleep,” “wine,” and “time,” in keeping with the central theme of these poems. Celan’s next collections show his continued attempts to break with the past, to move his life and his poetry to new levels. Von Schwelle zu Schwelle In Von Schwelle zu Schwelle (threshold to threshold), Celan abandoned his frequent references to the past; it is as if the poet—as the title, taken from a poem in Mohn und Gedächtnis, suggests—intended to cross over a threshold into a new realm. Images referring to his mother, to the persecution of the Jews, to his personal attitude toward God, and to his Jewish heritage are less frequent in this volume. Many German critics, reluctant to concentrate on Celan’s treatment of the Holocaust, have remarked with some relief his turning away from this subject toward the problem of creativity, the possibilities of communication, and the limits of language. Indeed, if one follows most German critics, Von Schwelle zu Schwelle was the first step in the poet’s development toward “metapoetry”—that is, poetry that no longer deals with traditional materia poetica but only with poetry itself. This new direction is demonstrated by the preponderance of terms such as “word” and “stone” (a symbol of speechlessness), replacing “dream,” “autumn,” and “time.” For Celan, Von Schwelle zu Schwelle constituted a more radical attempt to start anew by no longer writing about—therefore no longer having to think about—experiences and memories that he had been unable to come to grips with in his earlier poems. Speech-Grille Speech-Grille is, as the title suggests, predominantly concerned with language. The thirty-three poems in this volume are among Celan’s finest, as the enthusiastic critical reception confirmed. They are characterized by a remarkable discipline of expression, leading in many cases to a reduction of poetry to the bare essentials. Indeed, it is possible to see these poems as leading in the direction of complete silence. “Engführung” (“Stretto”), perhaps the finest poem in the collection and one of Celan’s best, exemplifies this tendency even by its title, which is taken from musical theory and refers to the final section of a fugue. A long poem that alludes to “Death Fugue,” it is stripped of the descriptive metaphors that characterized that masterpiece, such as the “grave in the air” and “the black milk of daybreak”; instead, experience is reduced to lines such as “Came, 20\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nCelan, Paul\n\ncame./ Came a word, came/ came through the night,/ wanted to shine, wanted to shine/ Ash./ Ash, ash./ Night.” Die Niemandsrose Celan’s attempt to leave the past behind in Speech-Grille was not completely successful; on the contrary, several poems in this collection express sorrow at the poet’s detachment from his Jewish past and from his religion. It is therefore not surprising that Celan’s next collection, Die Niemandsrose (the no-one’s rose), was dedicated to Mandelstam, a victim of Joseph Stalin’s persecutions in the 1930’s. One of the first poems in this collection makes mention of the victims of the concentration camps: “There was earth inside them, and/they dug.” Rather than concentrating on the horrors of camp existence, the poem discusses the possibility of believing in an omnipotent, benevolent God in the face of these atrocities; this theme is picked up again in “Zürich, zum Storchen” (“Zurich, the Stork Inn”), in which Celan reports on his meeting with the Jewish poet Nelly Sachs: “the talk was of your God, I spoke/ against him.” Other poems contain references to his earlier work; the “house in Paris” is mentioned again, and autumn imagery, suggesting the memory of his mother, is used more frequently. Several other poems express Celan’s renewed and final acceptance of his Jewish heritage but indicate his rejection of God, culminating in the blasphemous “Psalm,” with its bitter tribute: “Praised be your name, no one.” Later years Celan’s poetry after Die Niemandsrose became almost inaccessible to the average reader. As the title Breathturn indicates, Celan wanted to go in entirely new directions. Most of the poems in Celan’s last collections are very short; references to language and writing become more frequent, and striking, often grotesque, portmanteau words and other neologisms mix with images from his earlier poems. There are still references to Judaism, to an absent or cruel God, and—in a cryptic form—to personal experiences. In the posthumously published Snow Part, the reader can even detect allusions to the turbulent political events of 1968. The dominant feature of these last poems, however, is the almost obsessive attempt to make the language of poetry perform new, hitherto unimagined feats, to coerce words to yield truth that traditional poetic diction could not previously force through its “speech-grille.” It appears that Celan finally despaired of ever being able to reach this new poetic dimension. The tone of his last poems was increasingly pessimistic, and his hopes, expressed in earlier poems, of finding “that ounce of truth deep inside delusion,” gave way to silence in the face of the “obstructive tomorrow.” It is the evidence of these last poems, more than any police reports, which make it a certainty that his drowning in the Seine in 1970 was not simply the result of an accident. Celan’s poetry can be understood only by grasping his existential dilemma after 21\n\nCelan, Paul\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nWorld War II as a Jewish poet who had to create his poetry in the German language. Desperate to leave behind everything which would remind him of his own and his people’s plight, he nevertheless discovered that the very use of the German language inevitably led him back to his past and made a new beginning impossible. Finally, the only escape he saw still open to him was to attempt to abandon completely the conventions of German lyric poetry and its language, to try to make his poetry express his innermost feelings and convictions without having to resort to traditional poetic diction and form. Weinrich suggests that Celan, like Mallarmé before him, was searching for the “absolute poem,” a poem that the poet creates only as a rough sketch and that the reader then completes, using private experiences and ideas, possibly remembered pieces of other poems. If this is true, Celan must have ultimately considered his efforts a failure, both in terms of his poetic intentions and in his desire to come to terms with his personal and his Jewish past.

Consequently, he published books that include interviews, lectures, essays, photographs, and letters to friends as means of conveying his theories about composition and poetics. Achievements The publication of “Howl” in 1956 drew such enthusiastic comments from Allen Ginsberg’s supporters, and such vituperative condemnation from conservative cultural commentators, that a rift of immense proportions developed, which has made a balanced critical assessment very difficult. Nevertheless, partisan response has gradually given way to an acknowledgment by most critics that Ginsberg’s work is significant, if not always entirely successful by familiar standards of literary excellence. Such recognition was underscored in 1974, when The Fall of America shared the National Book Award in Poetry. Ginsberg was awarded a Los Angeles Times Book Prize (1982) and the Frost Medal by the Poetry Society of America (1986). Included among the many honors he garnered during his lifetime were an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1969, the Woodbury Poetry Prize, Guggenheim fellowships, the National Arts Club Medal of Honor, the Before Columbus Foundation award for lifetime achievement, the University of Chicago’s Harriet Monroe Poetry Award, an American Academy of Arts and Sciences fellowship, and the Medal of Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Letters. The voice Ginsberg employed in “Howl” not only has influenced the style of several generations of poets, but also has combined the rhythms and language of common speech with some of the deepest, most enduring traditions in American literature. In both his life and his work, Ginsberg set an example of moral seriousness, artistic commitment, and humane decency that made him one of the most popular figures in American culture. The best of his visionary and innovative creations earned for him recognition as one of the major figures of the twentieth century. Biography Allen Ginsberg was born Irwin Allen Ginsberg, the second son of Naomi Levy Ginsberg, a Russian-born political activist and communist sympathizer, and Louis Ginsberg, a traditional lyric poet and high school English teacher. He attended primary school in the middle-class town of Paterson, New Jersey. He grew up in a conventional and uneventful household, with the exception of his mother’s repeated hospitalizations for mental stress. He entered Columbia University in 1943, intending to pursue a career in labor law, but the influence of such well-known literary scholars as Lionel Trilling and Mark Van Doren, combined with the excitement of the Columbia community, 25\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nwhich included fellow student Jack Kerouac and such singular people as William Burroughs and Neal Cassady, led him toward literature as a vocation. He was temporarily suspended from Columbia in 1945 and worked as a welder and apprentice seaman before finishing his degree in 1948. Living a “subterranean” life (to use Kerouac’s term) that incorporated drug use, a bohemian lifestyle, and occasional antisocial acts of youthful ebullience, Ginsberg was counseled to commit himself for several months to Columbia Presbyterian Psychiatric Institute to avoid criminal charges associated with the possession of stolen goods; there, in 1949, he met Carl W. Solomon, to whom “Howl” is dedicated. During the early 1950’s, he began a correspondence with William Carlos Williams, who guided and encouraged his early writing, and Ginsberg traveled in Mexico and Europe. In 1954, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco to be at the center of the burgeoning Beat movement. He was living there when he wrote “Howl,” and he read the poem for the first time at a landmark Six Gallery performance that included Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Michael McClure. His mother died in 1956, the year Howl, and Other Poems was published, and he spent the next few years traveling, defending Howl against charges of obscenity, working on “Kaddish”—his celebration of his mother’s life, based on a Hebrew prayer for the dead—and reading on college campuses and in Beatnik venues on both coasts. The growing notoriety of the Beat generation drew Ginsberg into the media spotlight in the early 1960’s, and he was active in the promotion of work by his friends. He continued to travel extensively, visiting Europe, India, and Japan; he read in bars and coffeehouses, and published widely in many of the prominent literary journals of the counterculture. His involvement with various hallucinatory substances led to the formation of LeMar (Organization to Legalize Marijuana) in 1964 with the poet, songwriter, and publisher Ed Sanders, and his continuing disaffection with governmental policies took him toward active political protest. In 1965, he was invited to Cuba and Czechoslovakia by Communist officials, who mistakenly assumed that his criticism of American society would make him sympathetic to their regimes, but Ginsberg’s outspoken criticism of all forms of tyranny and suppression led to his expulsion from both countries. His political activism—particularly in reaction to the Vietnam War—and close association with the counterculture continued throughout the 1960’s and 1970’s. During the 1960’s, he invented the nonviolent concept of “flower power” in an attempt to neutralize martial aggression. In 1967, he was one of the organizers of the first “Human Be-In.” The following year, he was arrested in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention with many other demonstrators, and in 1969, he testified at the Chicago Seven trials; that same year, he was at the center of a semi-serious effort to exorcise the Pentagon. In the early 1970’s, he spent some time on a farm in rural New York, formally accepted the teachings of Buddhism from Chögyam Trungpa, who initiated him with the name “Lion of Dharma,” and afterward cofounded, with Anne Waldman, a school of literary in26\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nquiry, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Colorado. He was inducted into the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1974, an indication of recognition as an artist in the mainstream of American culture, and he further confirmed this status by traveling with Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Review as a “poet-percussionist” in 1975. Continuing to combine artistic endeavor with a commitment to social justice, Ginsberg took part—with longtime lover Peter Orlovsky—in protests at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Facility in 1978 and wrote the “Plutonium Ode,” which expressed his concern about the destructive forces humans had unleashed. During the 1980’s, Ginsberg continued to travel, teach, write, and perform his work. The publication of his Collected Poems, 1947-1980 in 1984 was received with wide attention and respect, and he was appointed distinguished professor at Brooklyn College in 1986, the year he published White Shroud, which includes an epilogue to “Kaddish” along with other poems from the 1980’s. His ability as a teacher was clearly demonstrated in his appearance on the Public Broadcasting Service series Voices and Visions in 1987. As the decade drew to a close, he was involved in collaboration with composer Philip Glass on a chamber opera called Hydrogen Jukebox (a phrase from “Howl”), which was performed in 1990. Continuing to write with energy while teaching a graduate-level course on the Beats at the City University of New York Graduate Center, Ginsberg described his goals in the 1990’s, in a poem called “Personals Ad,” as similar to the ones he had always pursued: “help inspire mankind conquer world anger & guilt.” It was an appropriate task for a “poet professor in his autumn years.” Afflicted with diabetes, hepatitis, and liver cancer, he died at age seventy following a stroke on April 5, 1997, in New York City. Analysis “Howl,” the poem that carried Allen Ginsberg into public consciousness as a symbol of the avant-garde artist and as the designer of a verse style for a postwar generation seeking its own voice, was initially regarded as primarily a social document. As Ginsberg’s notes make clear, however, it was also the latest specimen in a continuing experiment in form and structure. Several factors in Ginsberg’s life were particularly important in this breakthrough poem, written as the poet was approaching thirty and still drifting through a series of jobs, countries, and social occasions. Ginsberg’s father had exerted more influence than was immediately apparent. Louis Ginsberg’s very traditional, metrical verse was of little use to his son, but his father’s interest in literary history was part of Ginsberg’s solid grounding in prosody. Then, a succession of other mentors—including Williams, whose use of the American vernacular and local material had inspired him, and great scholars such as art historian Meyer Shapiro at Columbia, who had introduced him to the tenets of modernism from an analytic perspective— had enabled the young poet to form a substantial intellectual foundation. In addition, Ginsberg was dramatically affected by his friendships with Kerouac, Cassady, Burroughs, Herbert Hunke, and other noteworthy denizens of a vibrant under27\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nground community of dropouts, revolutionaries, drug addicts, jazz musicians, and serious but unconventional artists of all sorts. Ginsberg felt an immediate kinship with these “angelheaded hipsters,” who accepted and celebrated eccentricity and regarded Ginsberg’s homosexuality as an attribute, not a blemish. Although Ginsberg enthusiastically entered into the drug culture that was a flourishing part of this community, he was not nearly as routed toward self-destruction as Burroughs or Hunke; he was more interested in the possibilities of visionary experience. His oft-noted “illuminative audition of William Blake’s voice simultaneous with Eternity-vision” in 1948 was his first ecstatic experience of transcendence, and he continued to pursue spiritual insight through serious studies of various religions—including Judaism and Buddhism—as well as through chemical experimentation. His experiments with mind-altering agents (including marijuana, peyote, amphetamines, mescaline, and lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD) and his casual friendship with some quasi-criminals led to his eight-month stay in a psychiatric institute. He had already experienced an unsettling series of encounters with mental instability in his mother, who had been hospitalized for the first time when he was three. Her struggles with the torments of psychic uncertainty were seriously disruptive events in Ginsberg’s otherwise unremarkable boyhood, but Ginsberg felt deep sympathy for his mother’s agony and also was touched by her warmth, love, and social conscience. Although not exactly a “red diaper baby,” Ginsberg had adopted a radical political conscience early enough to decide to pursue labor law as a college student, and he never wavered from his initial convictions concerning the excesses of capitalism. His passionate call for tolerance and fairness had roots as much in his mother’s ideas as in his contacts with the “lamblike youths” who were “slaughtered” by the demon Moloch: his symbol for the greed and materialism of the United States in the 1950’s. In conjunction with his displeasure with what he saw as the failure of the government to correct these abuses, he carried an idealized conception of “the lost America of love” based on his readings in nineteenth century American literature, Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau in particular, and reinforced by the political and social idealism of contemporaries such as Kerouac, Snyder, and McClure. Ginsberg brought all these concerns together when he began to compose “Howl.” However, while the social and political elements of the poem were immediately apparent, the careful structural arrangements were not. Ginsberg found it necessary to explain his intentions in a series of notes and letters, emphasizing his desire to use Whitman’s long line “to build up large organic structures” and his realization that he did not have to satisfy anyone’s concept of what a poem should be, but could follow his “romantic inspiration” and simply write as he wished, “without fear.” Using what he called his “Hebraic-Melvillian bardic breath”—a rhythmic pattern similar to the cadences of the Old Testament as employed by Herman Melville—Ginsberg wrote a three-part prophetic elegy, which he described as a “huge sad comedy of wild phrasing.” 28\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\n“Howl” The first part of “Howl” is a long catalog of the activities of the “angelheaded hipsters” who were his contemporaries. Calling the bohemian underground of outcasts, outlaws, rebels, mystics, sexual deviants, junkies, and other misfits “the best minds of my generation”—a judgment that still rankles many social critics—Ginsberg produced image after image of the antics of “remarkable lamblike youths” in pursuit of cosmic enlightenment, “the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night.” Because the larger American society had offered them little support, Ginsberg summarized their efforts by declaring that these people had been “destroyed by madness.” The long lines, most beginning with the word “who” (which was used “as a base to keep measure, return to and take off from again”), create a composite portrait that pulses with energy and excitement. Ginsberg is not only lamenting the destruction—or self-destruction—of his friends and acquaintances, but also celebrating their wild flights of imagination, their ecstatic illuminations, and their rapturous adventures. His typical line, or breath unit, communicates the awesome power of the experiences he describes along with their potential for danger. Ginsberg believed that by the end of the first section he had expressed what he believed “true to eternity” and had reconstituted “the data of celestial experience.” Part 2 of the poem “names the monster of mental consciousness that preys” on the people he admires. The fear and tension of the Cold War, stirred by materialistic greed and what Ginsberg later called “lacklove,” are symbolized by a demon he calls Moloch, after the Canaanite god that required human sacrifice. With the name Moloch as a kind of “base repetition” and destructive attributes described in a string of lines beginning with “whose,” the second part of the poem reaches a kind of crescendo of chaos in which an anarchic vision of frenzy and disruption engulfs the world. In part 3, “a litany of affirmation,” Ginsberg addresses himself to Solomon, a poet he knew from the Psychiatric Institute; he holds up Solomon as a kind of emblem of the victim-heroes he has been describing. The pattern here is based on the statementcounterstatement form of Christopher Smart’s Jubilate Agno (1939; as Rejoice in the Lamb, 1954), and Ginsberg envisioned it as pyramidal, “with a graduated longer response to the fixed base.” Affirming his allegiance to Solomon (and everyone like him), Ginsberg begins each breath unit with the phrase “I’m with you in Rockland” followed by “where . . .” and an exposition of strange or unorthodox behavior that has been labeled “madness” but that to the poet is actually a form of creative sanity. The poem concludes with a vision of Ginsberg and Solomon together on a journey to an America that transcends Moloch and madness and offers utopian possibilities of love and “true mental regularity.” During the year that “Howl” was written, Ginsberg wondered whether he might use the same long line in a “short quiet lyrical poem.” The result was a poignant tribute to his “old courage teacher,” Whitman, which he called “A Supermarket in California,” and a 29\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nmeditation on the bounty of nature, “A Strange New Cottage in Berkeley.” He continued to work with his long-breath line in larger compositions as well, most notably the poem “America,” which has been accurately described by Charles Molesworth as “a gem of polyvocal satire and miscreant complaint.” This poem gave Ginsberg the opportunity to exercise his exuberant sense of humor and good-natured view of himself in a mock-ironic address to his country. The claim “It occurs to me that I am America” is meant to be taken as a whimsical wish made in self-deprecating modesty, but Ginsberg’s growing popularity through the last decades of the century cast it as prophetic as well. “Kaddish” Naomi Ginsberg died in 1956 after several harrowing episodes at home and in mental institutions, and she was not accorded a traditional orthodox funeral because a minyan (a complement of ten men to serve as witnesses) could not be found. Ginsberg was troubled by thoughts of his mother’s suffering and tormented by uncertainty concerning his own role as sometime caregiver for her. Brooding over his tangled feelings, he spent a night listening to jazz, ingesting marijuana and methamphetamine, and reading passages from an old bar mitzvah book. Then, at dawn, he walked the streets of the lower East Side in Manhattan, where many Jewish immigrant families had settled. A tangle of images and emotions rushed through his mind, organized now by the rhythms of ancient Hebrew prayers and chants. The poem that took shape in his mind was his own version of the Kaddish, the traditional Jewish service for the dead that had been denied to his mother. As it was formed in an initial burst of energy, he saw its goal as a celebration of her memory and a prayer for her soul’s serenity, an attempt to confront his own fears about death, and ultimately, an attempt to come to terms with his relationship to his mother. “Kaddish” begins in an elegiac mood, “Strange now to think of you gone,” and proceeds as both an elegy and a kind of dual biography. Details from Ginsberg’s childhood begin to take on a sinister aspect when viewed from the perspective of an adult with a tragic sense of existence. The course of his life’s journey from early youth and full parental love to the threshold of middle age is paralleled by Naomi’s life as it advances from late youth toward a decline into paranoia and madness. Ginsberg recalls his mother “teaching school, laughing with idiots, the backward classes—her Russian speciality,” then sees her in agony “one night, sudden attack . . . left retching on the tile floor.” The juxtaposition of images ranging over many years reminds him of his own mortality, compelling him to probe his subconscious mind to face some of the fears that he has suppressed about his mother’s madness. The first part of the poem concludes as the poet realizes that he will never find any peace until he is able to “cut through—to talk to you—” and finally to write her true history. The central incident of the second section is a bus trip the twelve-year-old Ginsberg took with his mother to a clinic. The confusion and unpredictability of his mother’s behavior forced him to assume an adult’s role, for which he was not prepared. For the first 30\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\ntime, he realizes that this moment marked the real end of childhood and introduced him to a universe of chaos and absurdity. As the narrative develops, the emergence of a nascent artistic consciousness, poetic perception, and political idealism is presented against a panorama of life in the United States in the late 1930’s. Realizing that his growth into the poet who is revealing this psychic history is closely intertwined with his mother’s decline, Ginsberg faces his fear that he was drawing his newfound strength from her as she failed. As the section concludes, he squarely confronts his mother’s illness, rendering her madness in disjointed scraps of conversation while using blunt physical detail as a means of showing the body’s collapse: an effective analogue for her simultaneous mental disorder. There is a daunting authenticity to these details, as Ginsberg speaks with utter candor about the most intimate and unpleasant subjects (a method he also employs in later poems about sexual contacts), confirming his determination to bury nothing in memory. This frankness fuses Ginsberg’s recollections into a mood of great sympathy; he is moved to prayer, asking divine intervention to ease his mother’s suffering. Here he introduces the actual Hebrew words of the Kaddish, the formal service that had been denied his mother because of a technicality. The poet’s contribution is not only to create an appropriate setting for the ancient ritual but also to offer a testament to his mother’s most admirable qualities. As the second section ends, Ginsberg sets the power of poetic language to celebrate beauty against the pain of his mother’s last days. Returning to the elegiac mode (after Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “Adonais”), Ginsberg has a last vision of his mother days before her final stroke, associated with sunlight and giving her son advice that concludes, “Love,/ your mother,” which he acknowledges with his own tribute, “which is Naomi.” The last part of the poem, “Hymmnn,” is divided into four sections. The first is a prayer for God’s blessing for his mother (and for all people); the second is a recitation of some of the circumstances of her life; the third is a catalog of characteristics that seem surreal and random but coalesce toward the portrait he is producing by composite images; and the last part is “another variation of the litany form,” ending the poem in a flow of “pure emotive sound” in which the words “Lord lord lord,” as if beseeching, alternate with the words “caw caw caw,” as if exclaiming in ecstasy. By resisting almost all the conventional approaches to the loaded subject of motherhood, Ginsberg has avoided sentimentality and reached a depth of feeling that is overwhelming, even if the reader’s experience is nothing like the poet’s. The universality of the relationship is established by its particulars, the sublimity of the relationship by the revelation of the poet’s enduring love and empathy. The publication of “Kaddish” ended the initial phase of Ginsberg’s writing life. “Howl” is a declaration of poetic intention, while “Kaddish” is a confession of personal necessity. With these two long, powerful works, Ginsberg completed the educational process of his youth and was ready to use his craft as a confident, mature artist. His range 31\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nin the early 1960’s included the hilarious “I Am a Victim of Telephone,” which debunked his increasing celebrity, the gleeful jeremiad “Television Was a Baby Crawling Toward That Deathchamber,” the generously compassionate “Who Be Kind To,” and the effusive lyric “Why Is God Love, Jack?” A tribute to his mentor, “Death News,” describes his thoughts on learning of Williams’s demise. “Kral Majales” In 1965, after he had been invited to Cuba and Czechoslovakia, Ginsberg was expelled from each country for his bold condemnation of each nation’s policies. In Prague, he had been selected by students (including young Václav Havel) as Kral Majales (king of May), an ancient European honor that has lasted through centuries of upheaval. In the poem “Kral Majales”—published accompanied by positive and negative silhouettes of the smiling poet, naked except for tennis shoes and sporting three hands bearing finger cymbals, against a phallic symbol—he juxtaposed communist and capitalist societies at their most dreary and destructive to the life-enhancing properties of the symbolic May King: a figure of life, love, art, and enlightenment. The first part of the poem is marked by discouragement, anger, and sorrow mixed with comic resignation to show the dead end reached by governments run by a small clique of rulers. However, the heart of the poem, a list of all the attributes that he brings to the position of Kral Majales, is an exuberant explosion of joy, mirth, and confidence in the rising generation of the mid1960’s. Written before the full weight of the debacle in Vietnam had been felt and before the string of assassinations that rocked the United States took place, Ginsberg reveled in the growth of what he thought was a revolutionary movement toward a utopian society. His chant of praise for the foundations of a counterculture celebrates “the power of sexual youth,” productive, fulfilling work (“industry in eloquence”), honest acceptance of the body (“long hair of Adam”), the vitality of art (“old Human poesy”), and the ecumenical spirit of religious pluralism that he incarnates: “I am of Slavic parentage and Buddhist Jew/ who worships the Sacred Heart of Christ the blue body of Krishna the straight back of Ram the beads of Chango.” In a demonstration of rhythmic power, the poem builds until it tells of the poet’s literal descent to earth from the airplane he took to London after his expulsion. Arriving at “Albion’s airfield” with the exultation of creative energy still vibrating through his mind and body, he proudly presents (to the reader or listener) the poem he has just written “on a jet seat in mid Heaven.” The immediacy of the ending keeps the occasion fresh in the poet’s memory and alive forever in the rhythms and images of his art. “Witchita Vortex Sutra” The Prague Spring that was to flourish temporarily in events such as the 1965 May Festival was crushed by Soviet tanks in 1968. By then, the United States had become fully involved in the war in Southeast Asia, and Ginsberg had replaced some of his opti32\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nmism about change with an anger that recalled the mood of the Moloch section of “Howl.” In 1966, he was in Kansas to read poetry, and this trip to the heartland of the United States became the occasion for a poem that is close to an epic of American life as the country was being torn apart. “Witchita Vortex Sutra,” one of Ginsberg’s longest poems, combines elements of American mythological history, personal psychic exploration, multicultural interaction, and prophetic incantation. The poem is sustained by a twin vision of the United States: the submerged but still vital American spirit that inspired Whitman and the contemporary American realities by which “many another has suffered death and madness/ in the Vortex.” A sense of a betrayal informs the narrative, and the poet is involved in a search for the cause and the cure, ultimately (and typically) discovering that only art can rescue the blighted land. The first part of the poem depicts Kansas as the seat of American innocence, where the spirit of transcendental idealism is still relatively untouched by American actions in Vietnam. Whitman’s dream of an open country and worthy citizens seems to remain alive, but events from the outside have begun to reach even this sheltered place. The land of Abraham Lincoln, Vachel Lindsay, William Jennings Bryan, and other American idealists is being ruined by the actions of a rogue “government” out of touch with the spirit of the nation. The poet attempts to understand why this is happening and what consequences it has for him, for any artist. After this entrance into the poem’s geopolitical and psychic space, the second part presents, in a collage form akin to Ezra Pound’s Cantos (1925-1972), figures, numbers, names, and snatches of propaganda about the conflict in Vietnam. Following Pound’s proposal that a bad government corrupts a people by its misuse of language, Ginsberg begins an examination of the nature of language itself to try to determine how the lies and deceptions in “black language/ writ by machine” can be overcome by a “lonesome man in Kansas” who is “not afraid” and who can speak “with ecstatic language”: that is, the true language of human need, essential human reality. Calling on “all Powers of imagination,” Ginsberg acts as an artist in service to moral being, using all the poetic power, or versions of speech, that he has worked to master. Ginsberg’s “ecstatic language” includes, in particular, the lingo of the Far Eastern religions he has learned in his travels. To assist in exorcising the demons of the West, he implores the gods of the East (fitting, since the war is in the East) to merge their forces with those of the new deities of the West, whose incarnation he finds in such American mavericks as the musician Dylan. He summons them as allies against the Puritan death-wish he locates in the fanaticism of unbending, self-righteous zealots such as Kansas’s Carrie Nation, whose “angry smashing ax” began “a vortex of hatred” that eventually “defoliated the Mekong Delta.” Through the poem, Ginsberg has cast the language artist as the rescuer, the visionary who can restore the heartland to its primal state as a land of promise and justice. In an extraordinary testament to his faith in his craft, Ginsberg declares, “The war is over now”—which, in a poem that examines language in “its deceits, its degeneration” (as Charles Molesworth says), “is especially poignant being only language.” 33\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\nCritical Survey of Poetry\n\nThe Fall of America Other poems, such as “Bayonne Entering NYC,” further contributed to the mood of a collection titled The Fall of America, but Ginsberg was also turning again toward the personal. In poems such as “Wales Visitation,” a nature ode written in the spirit of the English Romantics, and “Bixby Canyon,” which is an American West Coast parallel, Ginsberg explores the possibilities of a personal pantheism, attempting to achieve a degree of cosmic transcendence to compensate for the disagreeable situation on earth. His loving remembrance for Beat poet Cassady, “On Neal’s Ashes,” is another expression of this elegiac inclination, which reaches a culmination in Mind Breaths. Mind Breaths “Mind Breaths,” the title poem of the collection Mind Breaths, is a meditation that gathers the long lines of what Ginsberg has called “a chain of strong-breath’d poems” into a series of modulations on the theme of the poet’s breath as an aspect of the windspirit of life. As he has often pointed out, Ginsberg believes that one of his most basic principles of organization is his ability to control the rhythms of a long line (“My breath is long”). In “Mind Breaths,” he develops the idea that the voice of the poet is a part of the “voice” of the cosmos—a variant on the ancient belief that the gods spoke directly through the poet. Ranging over the entire planet, Ginsberg gradually includes details from many of the world’s cultures, uniting nations in motive and design to achieve an encompassing ethos of universality. Beneath the fragmentation and strife of the world’s governments, the poet sees “a calm breath, a silent breath, a slow breath,” part of the fundamentally human universe that the artist wishes to inhabit. Plutonian Ode In the title poem of Plutonian Ode, Ginsberg offers another persuasive poetic argument to strengthen the “Mind-guard spirit” against the death wish that leads some to embrace “Radioactive Nemesis.” Recalling, once again, “Howl,” in which Moloch stands for the death-driven impulses of humankind gone mad with greed, Ginsberg surveys the history of nuclear experimentation. The poem is designed as a guide for “spiritual friends and teachers,” and the “mountain of Plutonian” is presented as the dark shadowimage of the life force that has energized the universe since “the beginning.” Addressing himself, as well, to the “heavy heavy Element awakened,” Ginsberg describes a force of “vaunted Mystery” against which he brings, as always, the “verse prophetic” to “wake space” itself. The poem is written to restore the power of mind (which is founded on spiritual enlightenment) to a civilization addicted to “horrific arm’d, Satanic industries”—an echo of Blake’s injunctions at the dawn of an era in which machinery has threatened human well-being.\n\n34\n\nPoets of Jewish Culture\n\nGinsberg, Allen\n\n“Birdbrain” The tranquility of such reveries in poems such as “Mind Breaths” did not replace Ginsberg’s anger at the social system but operated more as a condition of recovery or place of restoration, so that the poet could venture back into the political arena and chant, “Birdbrain is the ultimate product of Capitalism/ Birdbrain chief bureaucrat of Russia.” In the poem “Birdbrain,” published in Collected Poems, 1947-1980, Ginsberg castigates the idiocy of organizations everywhere. His humor balances his anger, but there is an implication that neither humor nor anger will be sufficient against the forces of “Birdbrain [who] is Pope, Premier, President, Commissar, Chairman, Senator!” In spite of his decades of experience as a political activist, Ginsberg never let his discouragement overcome his sense of civic responsibility. The publication of Collected Poems, 1947-1980 secured Ginsberg’s reputation as one of the leading writers of late twentieth century American literature. White Shroud The appearance in 1986 of White Shroud revived Ginsberg’s political orations; in this work, he identifies the demons of contemporary Amer"
