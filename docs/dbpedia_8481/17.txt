May first to May fifteenth Nineteen hundred twenty-three AINSLIE GALLERIES Six Hundred Seventy-seven Fifth Avenue New York City THE INDIAN PORTRAITS OF W. LANGDON KIHN By PEYTON BOSWELL The whole country, by this time, is familiar with the “Taos school” of painters—that is, the work of that group of artists who have chosen the Southwest as their particular field and the life of the Indians of that section as their particular sub¬ jects. Nearly a score of artists have contributed to the reputa¬ tion of the “Taos school” and the process of establishing this reputation has extended over a number of years. And now there comes along a young artist, W. Langdon Kihn, who in a period of three years has established himself as a distinct “school” by himself, differing from all other “schools” of Indian painting; and who, besides stirring the admiration of the art world for the pure beauty of his work, has earned the plaudits of a much more exacting audience— one composed of scientists and ethnologists, whose interest in the Indian is not so much that of beauty as that of truth. The work of this young artist in the last three years, among various tribes of our North American aborigines, has been hailed by these authorities as something of lasting import, for the reason that it constitutes a faithful and spirited artistic transcription of a people and a life now swiftly passing from the world’s stage. Mr. Kihn’s work is significant, characteristic and beautiful. It differs from the product of the “Taos school” because this artist more than any of his colleagues seems to have made his pictures Indian —that is, to have looked through the eyes of an Indian rather than of a white man and to have painted his sub¬ jects in a decorative way that seems intended rather to please and satisfy the Indian than the white man. A Kihn portrait of an Indian is thoroughly aboriginal, not a Caucasian picture with an Indian theme. This is true both as to coloring and design. And when it comes to the portrayal of the faces of his subjects, Mr. Kihn explains his success (probably without know¬ ing it) when he says: “There is something about their red faces that makes me feel that they have been carved and hewn out of stone with a chisel.” Feeling this, he has painted them that way, and thereby achieved a verity in Indian portraiture that is magnificent. Mr. Kihn’s work is all the more to be wondered at when it is considered that he is still a very young man, having been bom in Brooklyn in 1898. He first studied in Homer Boss’ landscape class in the summer of 1913 at Monhegan Island, Maine. In 1916 he dropped all other studies and entered the Art Students’ League. Later, he worked under Mr. F. Winold Reiss. Early in 1920 he started on his first trip West, and with this began his career as a portraitist of Indians. His first experience was with the historic tribe of Blackfeet in Montana, who have always been so hospitable to the white man and who have found so many sincere admirers among the ruling race. The next Spring he passed among the Pueblo Indians of Laguna and Acoma, New Mexico. The pictures re¬ sulting from these two trips were shown last year in a special exhibition at the Anderson Galleries, New York, which won quick recognition for the young artist. This exhibition is now on a circuit of the museums and other public institutions of the West. It has already been seen in thirteen cities of the Middle West and West. Then in the Spring of last year, Mr. Kihn betook himself to a new 1 ‘camping ground.’’ He went to the Canadian Rockies, and the next seven months he passed in painting the aborigines of the Stoney tribe, at Morley, Alberta; the Kootenay tribe, on the Upper Columbia River, and the Nootka totem-pole Indians of Vancouver Island. On this trip he found, more than in the two previous ones, primitive decoration and elemental colors, and these are the prevailing feature of the new exhibition. There are two elements in each of them; first, the face, set down with the surety of a master of drawing; second, the ornamenta¬ tion, as expressed in the costume, in which the artist has been as arbitrary as the Indian himself in expressing the Indian’s sense of color and design. This is especially noted in such works as “Susette”, “Mrs. Halloway”, “Albin”, “Mrs. Albin”, “Hector Crawler” and “Mary Alice McLean.” As said at the beginning of this foreword, Mr. Kihn has established a “school” of Indian portraiture for himself. In other words, he has put elements into his work which make it possible for an art lover, at first sight of one of his pictures, to exclaim, “That is a Kihn 1”. A long step, indeed, for a painter of twenty-four to take. The art world has reason to expect a great deal from W. Langdon Kihn.
