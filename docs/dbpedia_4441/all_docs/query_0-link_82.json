        "text": "The Poor Law of 1834 was hated. Despite some administrative modification, it was still hated in 1905. The new workhouses had been christened the “Bastilles”. Edward Thompson called the New Poor Law “perhaps the most sustained attempt to impose an ideological dogma, in defiance of the evidence of human need, in English history.”\n\nThe 1905 Royal Commission was packed with defenders of the status quo ante – a block of senior civil servants from the Local Government Board, another block from the Charity Organisation Society. As soon as she had been appointed, Beatrice went to see the assistant secretary of the LGB, to find out the officials’ view of the purpose of the Commission. They were expected to propose some useful structural reforms: “But we were also to recommend reversion to the principles of 1834 as regards policy: to stem the tide of philanthropic impulse that was sweeping away the old embankment of deterrent tests to the receipt of relief.”"
