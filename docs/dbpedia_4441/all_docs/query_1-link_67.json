The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:11 a.m., in room 2141, Rayburn Office Building, the Honorable Darrell E. Issa, (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Issa, Goodlatte, Collins, Smith, Forbes, Jordan, Poe, Marino, Farenthold, Nadler, Conyers, Deutch, Bass, DelBene, Peters, Lofgren, and Johnson. Staff Present: (Majority) David Whitney, Oversight Counsel; Eric Bagwell, Clerk; and (Minority) Jason Everett, Minority Counsel. Mr. Issa. Good morning. I want to welcome you all to this intimate dais gathering here. The Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Subcommittee at any time. We welcome today a hearing with the stakeholders of prospective changes on ICANN. In particular, we will be dealing today with a number of new items, including the .SUCKS domain and essential steps to guarantee trust and accountability in Internet operations. Today's hearing comes approximately 14 months after the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced its intention to relinquish the existing contract for the oversight of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA, to the global multi-stakeholder group coordinated by ICANN. Now, that is a mouthful. But in a nutshell, we have decided to give up our governance control that has been in place effectively since the beginning of the Internet. The United States has been a critical backstop against censorship and in promoting openness and free speech in the Internet once IANA's contract is surrendered. It is impossible to go back once this is done, and we cannot overstate the importance of such a transition. If it is to occur, it is important that it be done correctly and recognizing that the long-term aspirations of these organizations that contribute to the operations of the Internet must take the utmost caution in establishing a process to transition to a new form of control of this critical backbone function. Clearly, I was troubled by the NTIA's sudden announcement late on a Friday afternoon, which is known by all of us to bury a story. So on September 30, 2014, without first informing or engaging with the appropriate parties for collaboration, including the staff of this Committee--and I want to make it clear, a minor notice that something would be happening the next week, on a Thursday, without recognizing what it was going to be, and then having it stuck in on a Friday, is not collaboration. It is certainly not consultation. The process that we want to have must be deliberate, conscientious, and, in fact, include a bottom-up evaluation by all the stakeholders. So today's hearing is really about recognizing successes and failures throughout this process. But we have the largest group of witnesses I personally have ever had in my 15 years in Congress for a reason. Even without ICANN at the table, what we have is we have a small segment of the stakeholders. To have only eight is a disappointment, because there are millions. But to have eight is the bare minimum for us to begin to talk about the breadth of concern that seems to exist in a transition that, although anticipated for a long time, seems to be rushing forward just at a time in which particularly the domain name system has some serious questions and perhaps flaws. It is particularly important that now that it is about a year later, that we begin to ask the question: Is it appropriate to have the transition as scheduled, or should there be further delay with a short extension in order to ensure that the process that cannot be undone is done right the first time? An example that particularly concerns this Member is, in fact, that in light of the .AMAZON Web site, one that was not done in consultation with a company of Internet fame, nor necessarily in proper consultation with the countries in which Amazon flows, has been with some chaos and lessons to be learned, and I want to thank our witness for being here today so we can begin discussing what was learned and should be learned before sites such as .SUCKS, .PORN, or .IHATECONGRESS are put on the Internet. I know that .IHATECONGRESS would be well sold, perhaps over-subscribed. The question is, does it serve the responsibility to ensure sufficient naming so that all may have an appropriate name? Or, in fact, have we gotten into a business model that was never envisioned? There is no question in my mind that since there are billions of possibilities in IPv6, a series of three-digit numbers, there are enough numbers finally to take care of every point. But since names can be assigned by the dozens or even thousands to one number, are we simply exaggerating the number of names that are going to end up at a single point? In closing, the .SUCKS domain was approved by ICANN and auctioned last November to a company that now has the right to operate a new generic top-level domain. ICANN should not be the speech police. However, as I have done individual evaluation, and I now place into the record the DarrellIssa.SUCKS opportunity to buy, the process being done by the companies that gain the rights appears to this Member to be nothing more than legalized extortion. The typical price most Americans see if they go to GoDaddy or any other site to buy a name is in the dollars or tens of dollars. In the case of these sites, which can be often and most likely used in a pejorative way, the sites begin at $249 but are effectively being done as an auction. You are given an opportunity to bid, if you are the proper name owner, $2,500, with no guarantee that you won't be over-bid by somebody that hates you more than you love your own name. So as we begin this process, one of the key elements that we are going to be exploring is whether, in fact, naming and those sales should ever be done to settle past debts that ICANN has, or a bidding process that leads to an unreasonable cost to the legitimate owner of a name only to protect his name from either disparagement or dilution. And with that, I am pleased to recognize the Ranking Member for his opening statement. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today we continue our examination of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. This may not be a glamorous topic, but it is fundamental to the governance and functioning of the Internet. When we type a simple address into our Web browser, we rarely give a second thought to how our desired Web site loads almost instantly onto our screen. But there is a complicated and unseen architecture that makes this process work, administered in part by ICANN, and we must ensure that it operates smoothly, transparently, and with proper accountability. Since this Subcommittee last considered issues related to ICANN, there have been many developments that warrant further analysis, and I appreciate the Chairman scheduling this hearing today. Most prominently since our last hearing, ICANN has continued to expand its new generic top-level domain program, gTLD, which supplements existing top-level domains such as .COM, .NET, and .ORG with new ones consisting of brand names or generic terms like .MUSIC, .NEWS, or .BOOKS. Supporters of this expansion argue that it will increase consumer choice, competition, and innovation. As of last month, there were over 500 new top-level domains added to the Internet, and we expect hundreds more soon. However, this expansion has also raised a host of issues related to determining which names are allocated, to whom they are allocated, and what it should cost to register a domain. We have seen this most vividly in the controversy surrounding ICANN's approval, as the Chairman has mentioned, of the .SUCKS gTLD. This has been contentious not only because of the term but also because of concerns voiced about the proposed pricing structure associated with the domain. For obvious reasons, many brand owners have chosen to defensively register their own names in this domain to prevent others from using it in a negative context. However, the company that administers the .SUCKS domain, Vox Populi, has chosen to charge brand owners $2,500 to register their names instead of the much lower prices, as low as $10 in some cases, that it charges the public to register these names. According to Vox Populi, the .SUCKS domain ``is designed to help consumers find their voices and allow companies to find their value in criticism.'' Legitimate criticism is fair, of course, and is protected speech. However, this tiered pricing scheme which allows critics to register a name for a nominal charge while brand owners must pay exorbitant prices to protect their brands looks to many people like extortion. For example, ICANN's intellectual property constituency sent a letter to ICANN suggesting that the roll-out not continue because it ``can best be described as predatory, exploitative, and coercive.'' In response to these concerns, ICANN asked the United States Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to consider whether Vox Populi, which is based in Canada, is violating any laws or regulations. According to ICANN, because it is not a law enforcement agency and is only a contractual relationship with Vox Populi, it cannot act unless it receives guidance that the company is acting in some way illegally. Many stakeholders have expressed concern that ICANN's response is inadequate and simply passes the buck to regulators rather than taking responsibility for administering its own contracts. Given Vox Populi's scathing letter in response to ICANN, it is clear that this issue will not be resolved quickly. Congress must closely monitor the situation and hope ICANN will provide answers about how it intends to protect intellectual property rights holders and consumers as the rollout of the .SUCKS top- level domain continues. But this should not be just about one top-level domain expansion. We must consider instead what we can learn from the .SUCKS experience and apply these lessons to future top-level domains. We should also consider whether there are satisfactory safeguards in place to protect trademarks and intellectual property from being misused during this process, and whether ICANN's rights protection mechanism sufficiently addresses concerns raised by active parties. It is important to recognize that this discussion occurs in the context of oversight responsibility for ICANN's ministerial IANA functions transitioning from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the U.S. Commerce Department to an international multi-stakeholder process. This transition is completely separate and apart from ICANN's role in the top-level domain expansion. However, to the extent that stakeholders have expressed concerns about ICANN's level of transparency and accountability when it comes to managing the gTLD expansion or its other responsibilities, it is fair to ask whether appropriate transparency and accountability will exist once the multi- stakeholder process begins. Unfortunately, at times the debate over the ICANN transition has veered into a partisan battle based on imagined fears that the transition will cause the Internet to be dominated by repressive governments overseas. I hope that today's hearing will be free of such overheated rhetoric. In reality, this transition continues a privatization process that started in 1998, which continued through the Bush administration and has been supported by various Congresses. Ensuring effective private-sector management of these networks and transitioning functions served by the United States Government has been a goal shared by Republicans and Democrats alike over the years. I continue to believe that we need to ensure that the transition process and the model developed through the process produces a management structure that supports a secure, open, and truly global Internet. The NTIA has established criteria to help ensure this occurs, and I am confident that the agency and ICANN will agree to update us periodically. Before we delve into a discussion of any shortcomings of ICANN, I first want to thank its staff and its leadership for bringing together the multi-stakeholder process and for their hard work in building a strong and effective Internet. I hope that today's hearing will not devolve into a discussion that simply blames ICANN for all of the things that have gone wrong in this transition. Rather, I challenge us to figure out ways we can improve it. I would like our conversation to be more constructive, and I am hopeful that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to determine how best to improve the current system. Since we have eight excellent witnesses, I don't want to spend any more time talking than needed. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Thank you, Mr. Nadler. I now recognize the Chairman of the full Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, for his opening statement. Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just over a year ago the Obama administration and specifically the NTIA announced plans to transition oversight over the Internet's domain name system to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. The Administration's decision kicked off high-profile debates involving many far-reaching questions that relate to the future security, stability, resiliency and integrity of the global Internet's continued operation. At the core of NTIA's decision to entrust ICANN with the responsibility of convening the multi-stakeholder process to transition the IANA functions contract away from the United States is its determination that ICANN has matured as an organization. Presumably, NTIA has concluded that ICANN is not merely likely to conduct itself in a predictable, open, transparent and accountable manner in the future but that it generally exercises sound judgment and conducts itself in this manner already. Today's hearing before the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee is the second to focus on aspects of the proposed transition of the IANA functions contract to the global multi-stakeholder community. Two overarching concerns that should be tested fully and appropriately validated before concluding any transition are: one, how representative that community is; and two, how effective the community is and will be in the future in compelling ICANN to operate in a manner that benefits not merely a privileged few but the global users of the Internet. We will direct our attention today to matters that relate to the processes being implemented by ICANN and affected stakeholders to advance the NTIA's proposal and also to the substantive concerns routinely expressed by a wide array of stakeholders about ICANN's trustworthiness, accountability, execution and transparency of its current and existing duties and initiatives. Regrettably, many of these issues relate to matters presented to successive leaders of ICANN and officials at the Commerce Department for years, and yet there remains substantial room for progress toward responsible outcomes. Despite these matters being neither novel nor unanticipated, ICANN too often fails to appreciate their seriousness and implement corrective measures in advance or determines that it is unable or unwilling to do so. In at least one instance, the Obama administration actually aided and abetted efforts within ICANN to expand the influence of foreign governments at the expense of American companies. We will hear what happened when the NTIA and the State Department refused to intervene as the governments of Brazil and Peru pressured ICANN's board to deny Amazon's application for the .AMAZON gTLD even though the application was complete and the word was in no way restricted. The multi-faceted debate over the .SUCKS gTLD, which has resulted in trademark owners being shaken down for $2,499--I love that $1.00 discount from the round $2,500--or more annually to protect their brands by a registry affiliated with a company in financial default to ICANN raises many troubling questions, including: one, how the registry gained approval in the first instance; and two, whether ICANN itself had a financial motive for allowing this bid to proceed. Beyond this, ICANN's Chief Contract Compliance Officer's recent public request to consumer protection officials in the United States and Canada to investigate the applicant that ICANN just awarded the new domain to demonstrates the absurdity and futility of ICANN's own enforcement processes. But frustration over ICANN's enforcement and compliance system is not new. For more than a decade, this Committee has worked to encourage ICANN to take meaningful action to suspend the accreditation of registrars who disregard abuse notifications, and even those who actively solicit criminal activity. Today, we will hear testimony from a witness who has documented ICANN's refusal to deal responsibly with registries that profit from the trafficking of counterfeit drugs and even controlled substances like heroin. Before concluding, I want to commend the witnesses here today and those who worked to submit statements to the Subcommittee for their extraordinary dedication and ongoing efforts to improve ICANN's responsiveness, accountability and transparency. As one of our experts who wasn't able to join us today observed, ``We think that after more than fifteen years of routinely interacting with each other, ICANN and NTIA may have become a little too close. Only Congress can review what NTIA does and keep pressure on them to make sure the ICANN/IANA transition is not overly influenced or dominated by the agenda of ICANN. Help us ensure that the transition responds to the needs of the much broader community of Internet users and providers.'' That is our goal and our obligation. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now recognize the Ranking Member of the full Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers, for 5 minutes. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Chairman Issa. And to the Members of the Committee, and the gentlelady witness with the seven men that have accompanied her here today. We welcome you and the interested citizens that join us for this discussion here in the Judiciary Committee. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, is a private-sector, non-profit corporation started in 1998 to promote competition and to develop policy on the Internet's unique identifiers. The pending transition of key domain functions from United States stewardship to the global, multi-stakeholder community presents, of course, several new issues. Most importantly, ICANN and other stakeholders must abide by their contractual provisions to prohibit the use of domain names for the pirating of copyrighted material and other illegal activity. As many of you know, this Committee is deeply committed to addressing the problems of copyright and trademark infringement. Thus, from our perspective, it is critical that ICANN help prevent piracy and other unlawful conduct by both registrars and registrants. And to this end, ICANN prohibits registrants from engaging in unlawful conduct. In fact, ICANN released its Register Accreditation Agreement in 2013 which requires registrars to prevent abusive uses of registered domain names. Yet, there are reports that registrars are ignoring their obligations to deter online theft of copyrighted material, among other concerns. And worse, there are reports that ICANN is not enforcing the registrars' contractual obligations. This raises concerns about ICANN and Internet governance. Accordingly, I would like the distinguished witnesses to explain how ICANN and stakeholders can better respond to concerns about piracy and other illegal conduct, and how Congress can hold ICANN accountable. This leads to the next consideration. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration must adhere to its core guiding principles to ensure the security, protection, openness and stability of the network to complete the transition. The United States has long supported transitioning key Internet domain name functions to global multi-stakeholder communities. In fact, the House and Senate, on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress, clearly stated their support for a private, multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance. Nevertheless, any proposal for transition of the domain name system must meet certain core principles before it can be approved and finalized by the NTIA. These principles ensure that the United States will succeed in maintaining freedom, protections, openness, security and stability of the network. Adhering to these principles would build much-needed public support for the transition, and it would make it easier to receive our approval. Finally, we must ensure that NTIA abides by its commitment to facilitate a truly effective transition. The process should continue to be open and transparent and can confirm ICANN's accountability through core values and bylaws, and it should obtain international stakeholder consensus and support. So the hearing today should be the first of a number of oversight activities that our Committee conducts throughout the remainder of the transition process. Further hearings would allow stakeholders to update us on the transition and provide us with an opportunity to hear concerns. These hearings will also allow us to examine whether further safeguards are necessary. Accordingly, I thank the Chairman for holding today's hearings, and I look forward to hearing from this rather large number of witnesses. Thank you. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. As I said in my opening statement, it is not a large group. It is a sub-segment of millions of people who would like to be sitting here at the witness table. It is now my pleasure to introduce the distinguished panel of witnesses. The witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. I ask you to please summarize within 5 minutes or less, considering the size of the witnesses. To help us stay within this time limit, you will notice, as my colleague and former Chairman of another Committee, Mr. Towns, would say, you will notice that there is a red, a yellow, and a green light, and every American knows that green means go, yellow means go faster, and red means you have to stop. So if you will obey those, or if you possibly could summarize in less time, it would be appreciated since it will leave more time for the many questions we will have. Before I introduce the witnesses, I would ask that all the witnesses please rise to take the oath required by the Committee. Please raise your right hand. Do you all solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Please be seated. Let the record reflect that all witnesses answered in the affirmative. It is now my pleasure to introduce our panel of witnesses. Ms. Mei-lan Stark is the Immediate Past President of the International Trademark Association. Mr. Paul Misener is Vice President of Global Public Policy at Amazon.com, who has already been mentioned more than most witnesses. Mr. John Horton is President of LegitScript. Mr. Steve Metalitz is Counsel for the Coalition for Online Accountability. Mr. Bill Woodcock is Executive Director of Packet Clearing House. Mr. Steve DelBianco is Executive Director of NetChoice. Mr. Phil Corwin is Counsel for the Internet Commerce Association. And last but not least is Mr. Jonathan Zuck, President of ACT | The App Association. And with that, Madam, you get to go first. TESTIMONY OF MEI-LAN STARK, IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL TRADEMARK ASSOCIATION Ms. Stark. Good morning, Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Nadler, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Mei-lan Stark, and I am Senior Vice President of Intellectual Property for the Fox Entertainment Group, and I am appearing today on behalf of the International Trademark Association, otherwise known as INTA, where I am serving on a voluntary basis as their Immediate Past President. It was my privilege to testify before this Committee in 2011. At that time, I shared with you the trademark community's concerns regarding the launch of ICANN's new generic top-level domain, or gTLD, program. Today, I offer trademark owners' perspectives on ICANN's performance regarding the .SUCKS launch and the concerns it raises for the potential relinquishment of the National Telecommunications Information Administration, or NTIA's, stewardship of the IANA function. We greatly appreciate the Committee's attention to these very important issues. The new gTLD program was designed to promote competition and innovation. It is a system based upon a participatory multi-stakeholder model, and as is true with any self- regulatory model, trust and accountability are essential. That means the system must have strong mechanisms in place to conduct its operations in a reliable and transparent way. Intellectual property owners of all sizes, from all industries, both commercial and not-for-profit, must be able to trust that the new gTLD system will operate according to agreed-upon policies and procedures. This is necessary so that business owners can effectively protect their valuable trademarks in this new world. But more than that, trust and predictability are required to satisfy the purported goal of the new system, fostering innovation. After all, no business will invest resources in an unreliable system. The launch of .SUCKS by Vox Populi is an example of ICANN's operational deficiencies. The new gTLD program followed extensive public comment on how the system would operate and what intellectual property rights mechanisms would be mandatory. In response to grave concerns voiced by trademark owners during the public comment periods, ICANN did convene voluntary experts to address them, and that led to the implementation of new rights protection mechanisms to protect businesses and consumers from confusion, cyber-squatting, fraud, and other abuse. One such mechanism is the Trademark Clearinghouse, which allows trademark owners to pre-register domains corresponding to their trademarks before such names are made available to the general public. It appears that Vox Populi is using this very mechanism designed to protect trademarks and consumers to charge businesses and non-profits, both large and small, exorbitant fees to register their marks as domain names. Vox Populi co-opts the rights mechanisms developed by the multi- stakeholder community and uses it as a means to identify who pays 250 times more for a domain name. ICANN was warned about these bad practices and was asked to resolve these issues before the .SUCKS launch, but ICANN chose to ignore that request, and the launch continues. The current .SUCKS controversy strongly suggests that the critical framework required for a successful transition of the IANA function does not yet exist. ICANN must enforce its own policies and contracts. The trademark community supports the multi-stakeholder model, and we are engaged in the processes that are shaping that framework. We support a transition, but not until we are assured of the necessary accountability and transparency. As ICANN's management of the .SUCKS launch reveals, we simply are not there yet. Until such accountability mechanisms are implemented, continued U.S. Government and congressional oversight is necessary. In conclusion, while there are many potential benefits from the new gTLD program, those benefits are unlikely to materialize unless the program is effectively and fairly administered. ICANN's decisions and actions directly impact not only the architecture and control of the Internet but ultimately how consumers experience the Internet. As a trade association dedicated to brands and the consumer protection that trademarks afford, INTA stands ready to help ICANN develop and implement a reliable framework that promotes fair competition, choice and trust. We very much appreciate the Committee's continued engagement in these matters and thank you again for the opportunity to discuss the challenges facing trademark owners under ICANN's current policies and practices. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Ms. Stark follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Misener? TESTIMONY OF PAUL MISENER, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY, AMAZON.COM, INC. Mr. Misener. Thank you, Chairman Issa and Mr. Nadler, for your attention to this important topic, for holding this hearing, and for inviting me to testify. Amazon strongly supports the U.S. Government's policy goals of maintaining Internet stability, security, and freedom from government control. But NTIA's planned transition of Internet governance functions to ICANN carries the significant risk that, despite NTIA's intentions, ICANN's multi-stakeholder process could be dominated, coopted, or undermined by national governments, ultimately jeopardizing these policy goals. Amazon's recent experience in ICANN provides a warning that seriously calls into question ICANN's ability and willingness to uphold the multi-stakeholder model. The international community simply has not yet demonstrated its commitment to ICANN's multi-stakeholder process free from government control. Ideally, this risk would be addressable through a transparent, rules-based, accountable, multi-stakeholder process, so there is a very important question for Congress to ask: Is the current ICANN multi-stakeholder process actually working free from government control? From Amazon's experience, it is not. To the contrary, Amazon's experience provides a warning about government control of ICANN. Our familiarity with the multi-stakeholder process at ICANN comes from our application for several gTLDs, including .AMAZON. We believe the new gTLD program will provide a great opportunity for innovation and competition on the Internet, and we are thrilled to be a part of it. But our experience in the program raises serious concerns. In brief, the ICANN multi-stakeholder community worked for more than 3 years to develop rules for gTLD applicants, only to have ICANN ignore these rules under pressure from a handful of national governments, principally Brazil and Peru in the case of .AMAZON and related applications. Our repeated good-faith attempts to negotiate solutions with these governments, which have no legal rights to the term ``amazon,'' were fruitless. Other national governments also quickly caved to the pressure, and eventually so did the United States. This willingness of ICANN, other governments, and even the U.S., to abandon the rules developed in a multi-stakeholder process because of pressure from a few national governments provides a warning that seriously calls into question the commitment of the international community to ICANN's multi- stakeholder process free from government control. The implications of this flawed treatment of Amazon stretch well beyond unfairness to a single company. This wasn't just a matter of ICANN and national governments, including the U.S. Government, failing to defend an American company, the treatment of which had no basis under national law or international law. More importantly, these governments also failed to defend the ICANN multi-stakeholder process to which they supposedly were committed, or to demand ICANN accountability. And if ICANN feels empowered to disregard its rules and procedures, as well as snub the United States, before the NTIA planned transition, one can only imagine what ICANN would feel emboldened to do after a transition were consummated. From a U.S. perspective, the point is not only that my company's legally protected interests were sacrificed to geopolitics, it is the way they were sacrificed that undermines the whole ICANN multi-stakeholder model and sets a precedent for ICANN and the United States to quickly cave to future pressure from foreign governments. Perhaps ICANN intended to demonstrate that it would not play favorites with American interests. If so, it went way too far, and instead of treating U.S. interests no differently than those of other countries, it consciously broke its own rules and harmed an American company. Bluntly stated, ICANN's current multi-stakeholder process is not free from government control. The mishandling of Amazon's gTLD applications is a blemish on ICANN's record, and because of how the rules developed in an ICANN multi-stakeholder process were quickly abandoned in the face of modest government pressure, this blemish is disqualifying, at least until cleared. Favorable resolution of Amazon's lawful applications is a necessary first step, but this incident is only part of a broader question of whether ICANN and the international community are fully committed to the multi-stakeholder model free from government control. If the commitment is only superficial, the United States should recognize it and address it now, and NTIA's planned transition should not occur unless and until independent review and other robust accountability reform mechanisms proposed by the multi-stakeholder community are established for ICANN. The Internet stability, security, and freedom from government control are at stake. Thank you again for your attention to this topic, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Misener follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Horton? TESTIMONY OF JOHN C. HORTON, PRESIDENT, LEGITSCRIPT Mr. Horton. Mr. Chairman, when my company, LegitScript, identifies an illegal, unsafe Internet pharmacy, we notify the domain name registrar. When a registrar is notified that the domain name is being used for illegal activity, ICANN's accreditation scheme requires the registrar to do two things: first, to investigate the claims; and second, to respond appropriately. The good news is most registrars voluntarily disable domain names used to sell illegal, unsafe medicines that put patients' health and safety at risk. However, cyber criminals are rational economic actors and carefully choose the registrar that they believe will protect them. LegitScript's data indicate that just 12 among about 900 registrars maintain half of all illegal Internet pharmacy registrations. In first place is Rebel, a registrar in the Momentous Group, which operates .SUCKS, which has only 0.05 percent of the total domain name market but over 17 percent of the illegal online pharmacy market. Now, I'd like to talk about our experience notifying ICANN compliance about the few registrars that are a safe haven for criminal activity. Consider the Web site HealthPlugins.com, selling morphine, Percocet, and other addictive drugs without a prescription. The domain name was registered with Paknic in Pakistan, which refused to take action on this and hundreds of other illegal online pharmacies. ICANN closed our complaint against this registrar, finding that it responded appropriately despite leaving hundreds of illegal Internet pharmacies online. Now, if you want to buy heroin online, you can do it at smackjunkshot.com. We notified the registrar, Webnic of Malaysia, which had told us in the past that it could not just suspend domain names because it would lose money. We submitted a complaint to ICANN, which closed the complaint, finding that the registrar responded appropriately by leaving a domain name used to sell heroin untouched, as well as hundreds of other illegal online pharmacies. Finally, let's consider an example from a Momentous registrar, freeworldpharmacy.com, one of hundreds of illegal online pharmacy domain names that we have notified the company about. Mr. Chairman, these are the drugs that were sold to us without a valid prescription being required from freeworldpharmacy.com. And so that Momentous could have no doubt about the domain names used for illegal purposes, we sent a photo of these very drugs just a few weeks ago to Momentous. They took no action, and we have an ICANN complaint pending against Momentous right now. In the past, however, we have notified Momentous about illegal online pharmacies, including this one. They took little or no action, and ICANN has closed our complaints. I could go on and on. In these folders, these two folders, I have screenshots of another 750 illegal online pharmacies that only continue operating because ICANN closed complaints against the registrar that took no action. We only stopped at 750 in the interest of time. The point is cyber criminals cluster at a small number of safe-haven registrars who are running circles around ICANN compliance by persuading them that they are responding appropriately by doing nothing about domain names that they know full well are being used for illegal purposes, and those registrars are laughing all the way to the bank. In all of these cases, when we or law enforcement have asked ICANN what a registrar could possibly have done that constitutes an appropriate response in light of the ongoing use of domain names for illegal activity, ICANN compliance refuses to disclose it, keeping it a secret between ICANN and the registrar. The fundamental problem with this is a lack of transparency on the part of ICANN's compliance team. No reasonable person would believe that a registrar is responding appropriately to evidence that a domain name is being used to sell heroin by doing nothing. By finding that a registrar is responding appropriately in these cases, ICANN in essence gives a green light to the registrar to continue facilitating and profiting from the illegal activity, thereby putting Internet users at risk. By refusing to explain what the registrar did that supposedly constitutes an appropriate response, ICANN lends the impression that it is participating in a cover-up. Accordingly, in the spirit of ICANN's longstanding commitment to transparency, I want to publicly challenge ICANN to disclose what steps these registrars took that purportedly constitute an appropriate response despite being notified by LegitScript and in many cases by drug safety regulators and law enforcement that the domain names are being used to put everyday Internet users' health and safety at risk. This lack of transparency and turning a blind eye to ongoing criminal activity, in my view, is emblematic and at the core of ICANN's problems with trust and accountability. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Horton follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Metalitz? TESTIMONY OF STEVEN J. METALITZ, COUNSEL, COALITION FOR ONLINE ACCOUNTABILITY Mr. Metalitz. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Nadler, Members of the Subcommittee, thanks very much for inviting me to offer once again the perspectives of the Coalition for Online Accountability. Our coalition represents U.S. associations, organizations and companies that depend on the rules set by ICANN to enable us to enforce copyrights and trademarks online. First I would like to salute the Subcommittee for the crucial role it has played in providing oversight of ICANN issues over the past 15 years. Maintaining that long- established oversight record is critical to U.S. businesses that depend on copyright and trademark protection, and to the millions of American workers that they employ. My colleagues at the table, and especially on my left, will have a lot to say about the IANA transition process and the accompanying effort to improve ICANN's accountability mechanisms. I think those accountability efforts are basically on the right track. But as a wise man once said, the past is prologue, and so is the present. So rather than speculate about ICANN's future, I would like to focus on the way in which ICANN is now handling the critical domain name system functions over which the U.S. Government ceded its contractual control years ago. As several Members of the Subcommittee have already noted, what ICANN is doing and not doing today is highly relevant to the terms and conditions of the IANA transition and to what accountability mechanisms are needed in the future. So very briefly, let's look at ICANN's current track record on three key issues: contract compliance, WHOIS, and the new gTLD launch. We hear a lot about the ICANN multi-stakeholder model. What does that really mean? I think it boils down to this: replacing governmental regulation with private contracts and community oversight in managing the domain name system. For this model to work, the contracts must be strong and clear, and they must be vigorously and transparently enforced. Now, as John Horton has already mentioned, under the 2013 revision of the Registrar Accreditation Agreement, domain name registrars have new obligations to investigate and respond to complaints that the domain names they sponsor are being used for illegal activities, and that includes specifically copyright or trademark infringement. By now, most registrars have signed the 2013 agreement, but I have to report that registrars are not responding to these complaints even when the facts are clear and the evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming. Just as concerning, to date, ICANN is not yet taking action to clarify and enforce these RAA provisions, and as the previous witness said, it is acting with a lack of transparency in its compliance efforts. Unless and until ICANN shows that it can effectively enforce the agreements that it has signed, its readiness for the completion of the transition will remain in question, and this track record must be taken into account in fashioning the enhanced accountability mechanisms that must accompany any further transition. The 2013 RAA also set in motion long-overdue steps toward developing ground rules for the widespread phenomenon of proxy registration services. These have a legitimate role, but today the registered contact data for more than one-fifth of all gTLD registrations, tens of millions, lurks in the shadows rather than in the sunlight of the publicly accessible WHOIS database. Further progress in bringing predictability and consistency to this proxy world is critical. If ICANN cannot do this, then the role of the WHOIS database in letting Internet users know who they are dealing with online, critical for accountability and transparency, will be seriously compromised. The next several months may show whether ICANN is up to the task. Finally, although ICANN is only about halfway through the current new gTLD launch, it is already starting to review the process. That review needs to be searching and comprehensive. We need to question and reevaluate the ship's heading, not just rearrange the deck chairs for the next voyage. The review has to address the fundamental issue of whether the rollout of an unlimited number of new top-level domains actually benefitted the general public and brought greater choice to consumers or whether it simply enriched intermediaries and speculators. In conclusion, thank you again for this Subcommittee's continuing oversight of this fascinating experiment in non- governmental administration of critical Internet resources that we call ICANN. Our coalition urges you to continue that role, especially with regard to contract compliance, WHOIS, and the new gTLD review. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Metalitz follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Woodcock? TESTIMONY OF BILL WOODCOCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PACKET CLEARING HOUSE Mr. Woodcock. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, good morning and thank you for the opportunity to testify. My name is Bill Woodcock. I am the Executive Director of Packet Clearing House, the international organization that builds and supports critical Internet infrastructure, including the core of the domain name system. I have served on the Board of Trustees of the American Registry for Internet Numbers for the past 14 years, and I have been continuously involved in the IANA process since the mid- 1980's. Most relevant to the proceeding at hand, I am one of the two North American representatives to the CRISP team, the process through which the Internet numbers multi-stakeholder community has developed its IANA oversight transition proposal. I am here today to explain why it is in the interests of both the U.S. Government and other Internet stakeholders to ensure that the IANA oversight transition occurs on schedule and with undiminished strength of accountability. The IANA function comprises three discrete activities serving three different communities: the domain name community, which is represented by the other seven witnesses at the table here; the Internet protocols community, which sets Internet standards; and the Internet numbers community, which manages the Internet addresses that allow our devices to communicate. These three functions are completely independent of and separable from each other. Two of the three communities, protocols and numbers, produced the requested transition plans on schedule in January. The names proposal, however, is still a work in progress. The protocols and numbers communities finished promptly because the IANA functions that serve them are very simple. The IANA function that serves names is, as you have been hearing, substantially more complex. The names community will not reach consensus in sufficient time to achieve a September 30 transition, but the numbers and protocols transitions are ready to be implemented now. Moving them forward as planned would show good faith on the part of the U.S. Government and assure the world that the USG is a productive participant in the multi-stakeholder process rather than an obstacle. At the same time, allowing the names community the further time it needs would show that the U.S. Government is neither throwing caution to the wind nor abandoning its responsibilities before ICANN accountability can be firmly established. If NTIA delays the protocols and numbers transitions, it will further the interests of those Nations that are already displeased with the exceptional nature of the U.S. Government's role in IANA oversight. A shift in the balance of Internet governance from the multi-stakeholder model of the U.S. Government and the Internet community to the intergovernmental model advocated by China and the ITU would be disastrous. But a timely transition of strong stakeholder oversight of the IANA function would achieve the goals of both the U.S. Government and the global Internet community, responsible administration of a critical resource with strong contractual responsibility to stakeholders enforced within a jurisdiction that ensures that accountability is guaranteed by the rule of law. Under pressure from foreign governments to internationalize, ICANN has over the past 5 years gone from being a U.S. operation to one with offices and staff in Beijing, Geneva, Istanbul, Brussels, Montevideo, Seoul, and Singapore. This is clear evidence of other governments' influence on ICANN, influence that will only grow stronger over time. In my written testimony I cite facts, to demonstrate that the United States is the legal venue of choice of the international Internet community whenever it is an available option, across a sample of more than 142,000 Internet contractual agreements that we analyzed. Strongly accountable contractual oversight of the IANA function allows the Internet community to ensure that performance of the IANA function is never relocated to a jurisdiction with weaker rule of law or lesser protections against organizational capture. ICANN has performed the IANA function successfully because it has been disciplined by the mechanisms of U.S. Government procurement, the right to remedy uncured defects with mechanisms up to and including contract termination, and the right to seek superior performance in the marketplace through periodic re-competition. We believe retaining these same strong accountability mechanisms after the transition is essential to ensure responsible performance of the IANA function. No good can come from delaying the transition of the protocols and numbers functions. At the same time, no good can come from hurrying the names community into an incompletely considered compromise. Their issues require carefully crafted solutions involving significant ICANN accountability reforms. But these policy-level reforms are irrelevant to the simple mechanical tasks the IANA performs on behalf of the protocols and numbers communities. In conclusion, only the U.S. Government can ensure that commitment to a successful IANA transition is realized and act as the guarantor of the success of the multi-stakeholder governance model. The interests of the U.S. Government and of the global Internet stakeholder community are both served by a transition of the IANA protocols and numbers functions on time, on September 30 of this year, as long as the communities are contractually empowered to enforce the accountability of the IANA function operator in the same manner that the U.S. Government has successfully done for the past 16 years. I ask you to use Congress' unique power of oversight over NTIA to ensure that our commitments are met and the transition of the protocols and numbers functions occur as scheduled. Thank you for your time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Woodcock follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Del--I am doing great. And it is a famous name, too. Mr. DelBianco? TESTIMONY OF STEVE DelBIANCO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NETCHOICE Mr. DelBianco. Thank you, Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Nadler, Members of the Committee. You have heard a lot today about operational problems at ICANN, but what would really .SUCK is an unaccountable ICANN after the transition when we have lost the leverage for hearings like this to have much effect on the organization. Over 17 years, our government has protected ICANN's multi- stakeholder model from government encroachment and helped ICANN to mature, and that is saying something, because the goal for a computer scientist is to build something that can last at least as long as it takes to finish building it, and ICANN is still a work in process. But it is not sustainable for the U.S. to retain its unique role forever, particularly in a post-Snowden political climate. So NTIA asked the community for proposals to replace the stewardship role for IANA, and Chairman Goodlatte asked in a blog post earlier this year, ``What guarantees and capabilities and conditions should first be demanded and stress-tested by the global community?'' Well, the global community has answered with hundreds of meetings in the last several months, tens of thousands of man hours, many of them overnight since we cycle through global time zones, and our community proposals run a very good start. They give the community new powers to challenge board actions via independent review panels and issue binding decisions, to veto bylaws changes proposed by the ICANN board so they can't undo what we have done, to veto strategic plans and budgets proposed by the board, and to remove individual board directors or spill the entire board if we need to. Stress testing has helped us to assess whether these new powers would let the community challenge an ICANN decision for inaction and to hold the board accountable. As an aside, we saw little need to stress test the technical operations of the core Internet functions that Bill talked about because they are provided by very experienced operators who are actually stress tested every day. However, stress tests did help us see that ICANN's bylaws have to change in other ways. The first stress test in my April 24 testimony to your Committee was ICANN quitting its affirmation of commitments. So the community has said let's move some of the commitments and reviews from the affirmation into ICANN's bylaws. Another stress test was the governments changing the way they make their decisions at ICANN by moving to majority voting. That would expand government power over ICANN decisions. So we, the community, have proposed changing ICANN bylaws to seek a mutually acceptable solution with the governments, but only where their decision was reached through true consensus. Added transparency and powers would also help us to avoid situations like .SUCKS, which I tend to look at as more like a set of stress tests, of decisions made by ICANN to pass evaluation on an applicant who owed substantial fees, or the decision to negotiate a special million-dollar fee with a single applicant. So turning back to the community proposals for transition, we need details--I understand that--and we need review by global stakeholders. So this will not be ready by September of 2015. The timeline on the display board in front of you and on some of the paper that I distributed shows that we just can't get there from where we are. But even with an extension in time, we worry that ICANN's board and management will resist the approval of these plans and impede its implementation. The role of Congress, then, in this historic transition could be critical. What Congress can do while we still have the leverage is to insist that NTIA require ICANN to accept and implement the final community proposals as a condition of the IANA transition they seek. This is, after all, our last chance to use the leverage we are about to relinquish. So let's leave a lasting legacy where the Internet community gets the same kind of accountability from ICANN that shareholders demand today from their corporations, that my members demand from my trade association and, frankly, that voters and citizens demand from you. I don't think the global community deserves anything less than that which we use for the other institutions we count upon to make our lives work better. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. DelBianco follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Corwin? TESTIMONY OF PHILIP S. CORWIN, COUNSEL, INTERNET COMMERCE ASSOCIATION Mr. Corwin. Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Nadler, Subcommittee Members, I am Philip Corwin on behalf of the Internet Commerce Association, a domain industry trade group and member of ICANN's business constituency which I represent on ICANN's GNSO council. I commend the Subcommittee for this hearing. Congress has a legitimate interest in an IANA transition and enhanced ICANN accountability that proceeds soundly and effectively. The stakes include the security and stability of the DNS, Internet free expression, and uncensored information. Two cliches are apropos today. The first is, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' The ICA consensus is that U.S. stewardship has been benign and beneficial and that ICANN accountability should proceed on its own merits. But the second is, ``You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.'' The NTIA's announcement raised global expectations. Hundreds of ICANN community members have already expended thousands of hours in designing transition and accountability measures. Therefore, Congress should not reflexively oppose the IANA transition but should exercise strong oversight and support of ICANN stakeholders. While enhanced ICANN accountability measures are overdue, they will operate best only if ICANN's board and senior staff embrace a culture of accountability that assumes responsibility for the fallout of ICANN decisions and encompasses early consultation with the multi-stakeholder community that provides its organizational legitimacy. We are some distance from that culture. The road to the NTIA's announcement led through Montevideo and Brasilia and was paved by ICANN's misappropriation of the Snowden disclosures. The CEO's travels in South America were backed by a secret September 2013 ICANN board resolution. These actions were not transparent or accountable and reflected no community consultation. ICANN's community is now on the right stewardship and accountability track, but a final package will not be ready by September 30, much less the implementation of required pre- transition accountability measures. Therefore, NTIA should announce an ICANN contract extension soon. The final package must set key community rights in tandem with ICANN accountabilities in its bylaws and articles of incorporation. Turning to .SUCKS, ICANN's request that the FTC and OCA in Canada determine its legality was an abdication of responsibility rather than its embrace. ICANN had more than a year to explore and take appropriate action under multiple contract options. There are other new TLD program issues. While the jury is still out on the program's ultimate success, the total number of new domains seems larger than market demand and many TLDs are practically giving domains away, which aids spammers and phishers. Major unresolved consumer protection and technical issues remain unsolved, as well as uncertainty about spending $60 million in auction fees that ICANN has collected. The rights protection mechanisms for new TLDs are working well, but any review of domain dispute procedures should set standard contracts between ICANN and arbitration providers that ensure uniform administration. There are no such contracts today. ICANN must start taking responsibility for fair administration of domain disputes. Finally, besides ensuring full satisfaction of NTIA's principles, Congress should confirm that ICANN's continued post-transition U.S. jurisdiction is accepted and not a new irritation for those who would make ICANN a multilateral organization. You should also know that the transition does not mean ICANN will assume technical operation of key Internet functions. ICANN lacks the technical capacity to do so and is dependent on the experience and expertise of stakeholders for maintaining core functions. While the NTIA's announcement requires stakeholders to address certain important policies, there is no equivalent need to revamp DNS technical operations. The continued operational excellence of those operations will bolster the confidence of global users and the Internet's stability, security, and resilience. I hope my testimony has been helpful to your inquiry. I would be happy to answer any questions, and I yield back the remaining 30 seconds of my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Corwin follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Corwin. Mr. Zuck? TESTIMONY OF JONATHAN ZUCK, PRESIDENT, ACT | THE APP ASSOCIATION Mr. Zuck. Thank you, Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Nadler, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thanks for the opportunity to do clean-up here today, and I guess we will see, as the television series in the late '70's said, if eight is, in fact, enough. ACT | The App Association represents over 5,000 app developers and information technology firms, with businesses in every congressional district, and part of a really booming industry. When we talk about the domain name system, as we are today, it is important to remember that these small businesses, like the ones I represent, are actually the majority of the domain name holders. Small businesses around the world have used the World Wide Web to create presence for themselves and distribution for their products that simply wasn't available in the physical world, on par with our larger brethren. This ability and integrity of the DNS is more important to small businesses than to any other community. The basic question we have in front of us today is whether or not ICANN is ready to be independent of the United States Government. The simple answer that one can glean from the testimony you have already heard is no, but with the caveat that it can be with the enhanced accountability sought by the multi-stakeholder community with the proposed measures that were released on May 4th. If you will allow me to paraphrase Winston Churchill, ICANN is the worst model for Internet governance, except for all the others. My personal journey here has been somewhat circuitous. I am a former software developer that went on to represent software developers, and for a number of years small businesses I represent were indifferent to the inner workings of ICANN because the DNS seemed to be working, until some articles came out in 2005 suggesting that governments wanted the function of ICANN to be intergovernmental instead of multi-stakeholder, as it has been. Suddenly, all of these small businesses were wearing ``ICANN Rocks'' t-shirts and asking me to get involved directly in the ICANN process. So over the past 10 years, in some 30 meetings in windowless conference rooms around the world, we have worked together with the community and the NTIA to make ICANN a stronger, better managed, and more accountable organization. I am pleased to say we have achieved some success in a number of areas, and my constant refrain on performance metrics has led me to have the nickname ``Metrics Man'' inside of the community, and it is a nickname I wear with pride. Of course, as you have already heard today, there is still a lot to be done to create the ICANN the multi-stakeholder community deserves. As a member of the intellectual property constituency within ICANN, I stand with my colleagues in frustration with ICANN's handling of the new gTLD program and the needs of rights holders in particular. .SUCKS is just one example and a frightening precedent for what lies ahead for those trying to protect their intellectual property. ICANN needs to find better mechanisms to protect IP while increasing consumer choice and competition in the domain name space. And they have to get serious about enforcing their contracts. If digital archery is anything to go by, ICANN should certainly leave the tech to the experts and keep themselves in a management role. Finally, ICANN needs to find better ways to involve small businesses and to resolve their issues when they arise. The system is currently overwhelming and over-costly for companies that I represent to be meaningfully involved in the multi- stakeholder process. It is for these reasons that I view the pending IANA functions contract expiration as an opportunity on which to capitalize rather than something frightening to be avoided. What has been missing from all the reform efforts inside ICANN has been the teeth to make these reforms binding. It is certainly the case that NTIA provided an essential guidance and protection of ICANN throughout the years, but the true utility of this unique relationship reached its pinnacle with the affirmation of commitments in 2009. The announcement by NTIA of their plans to sunset the IANA functions contract has spurred a discussion of real ICANN accountability, the likes of which the organization has never seen. As others have mentioned, thousands of people hours in the community have set forth a proposed accountability framework that promises binding accountability to the multi-stakeholder community. This new ICANN, ICANN 3.0, if you will, will be stronger, answer to the community it serves, and create an environment of constructive reform that will allow it to develop and grow as the Internet adds its next billion users. That said, it is true that we have just one chance to get it right, and I believe that is where Congress can play a critical role. As Chairman Goodlatte wrote in his recent op-ed, it is certainly Congress' role to ensure that the proposed framework is indeed the work of the bottom-up multi-stakeholder process, the proposed framework passes various stress tests or worst-case scenarios, and the proposed framework, if accepted, is sufficiently implemented prior to the IANA functions contract expiration. Real accountability, when you boil it down, is about power, and the power needs to be in the hands of the community before it is any less in the hands of the U.S. Government. So once again, I thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I hope you will join me in making the most of this historic opportunity. I am happy to take any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Zuck follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. Thank you, and thank you for paraphrasing Churchill. He never actually delineated whether the British parliamentary system or the U.S. republic system and federalism was better, so perhaps we can work that out in ICANN. Mr. Nadler. The English and Scots are finding out. Mr. Issa. English and Scots are finding out says the Ranking Member. With that, I ask unanimous consent that a rather lengthy letter to John O. Jeffrey from David Hosp be placed in the record, this letter from the offices of Fish and Richardson. It was referred to by the Ranking Member and I am sure will come up in our discussions. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. I will now recognize myself, and I will start with a simple question for all eight panelists. The question is simple; hopefully the answer will be yes or no. Do we need more time? Do we need to exercise the extension in order to get it right in the transition? Ms. Stark. So, what I would say is it is not about focusing on a specific date, Chairman. It is what you said: We have to get it right. The stakes are very, very high. Rather than trying to put an artificial timeline to this, I think what is important is to focus on the work that is being done and the progress that is being made. Mr. Issa. I will come back to you on this, I promise. But briefly, do we need more time than the short time remaining on the existing transition? Ms. Stark. Certainly for public comment. INTA has actually formally requested an extension of time on the comment periods for the accountability---- Mr. Issa. To each of you, do we need more time? Mr. Misener. Yes. Mr. Horton. Yes, although that is not the fundamental problem. Mr. Metalitz. Yes, we do. Mr. Woodcock. For protocols and numbers, absolutely not. We have already been waiting for 4 months. For names, absolutely, yes. They need the time to get it right. Mr. DelBianco. Yes, we need more time, as the chart indicates. And a piecemeal approach, as Mr. Woodcock has discussed, leaves a very small piece of the meal for the naming community. Mr. Issa. Mr. Corwin? Mr. Corwin. Chairman, absolutely, we need more time, and in particular I would single out that the proposal put out by the working group on the naming functions, they need to schedule a second comment period. They put out an incomplete proposal for only 28 days comment, and they can't send it on to the next step until they give us a full proposal. Mr. Issa. Mr. Zuck, clean up. What would Churchill say? Mr. Zuck. Churchill would say that of course we need more time, but not indefinitely. I mean, I think something along the lines of 6 months would be enough to really get the proposal locked down and get the public comment and feedback and get something implemented. Mr. Issa. So paraphrasing for all of you, you do support a multi-stakeholder transition as long as all the prerequisites are met, it is a bottom-up approach, and the transition is one that we can live with for the long run. Good. Ms. Stark, I am going to go back to you. In light of, if you will, .SUCKS, .AMAZON, perhaps the drug explanations that were so articulately said, do we need and how do we get, sort of point by point, how do we get to the kind of consistency and enforcement that is necessary to protect trademark holders, copyright holders, and obviously the unlawful acts on the Internet that are prohibited? Ms. Stark. So, I think that the answer--thank you very much for that question, because I think it gets really to the heart of the matter. I think the real answer is that ICANN needs to actually enforce its existing contracts and policies. In a lot of these regards, we are not asking for something new or more. We had a multi-stakeholder process from the bottom up that developed the rights protection mechanisms, that developed the WHOIS policies and other things that exist in the contracts, but we are not seeing proper resources devoted to compliance and enforcement. Mr. Issa. Do you think there need to be management changes or structural changes in the management to get that done? In other words, they used to do something, they are doing it less well rather than better. Do you see that as a management failure? Ms. Stark. You know, I don't feel that I am qualified to speak about their management. Mr. Issa. You don't need to name names. [Laughter.] Ms. Stark. But what I do think is that it is very important for this model to work, that all relevant interests are represented and listened to, and that that input is actually analyzed in a meaningful way and then incorporated into policies and procedures. Mr. Issa. Now I am going to ask one more question. It will probably get several comments. Whether it is .SUCKS, or if you were going to have a German version of it, apparently it would be .SAUGT, I have no idea what it would be in Italian, in Chinese, in all the other possible languages. What I do know is there are 1,025,000 recognized names in the English language, and if we assume for a moment that we are going to promote and allow a proliferation of dot-somethings simply to gain more money, do you believe that inherently the stakeholders--and I will leave those who sell names out of the stakeholder business--the stakeholders, the actual users, the people who want perhaps one name for each function, perhaps only one name, period, are well served by trying to use every possible name in 209-plus languages? If I see no answer, I will assume that you all think it is really a bad idea to simply proliferate names that end up with people having to buy thousands of them. Mr. DelBianco. Thank you, Chairman Issa. The notion of more names comes about because we find ourselves 10 or 11 years ago with 20 generic top-level domains and none of them in a script other than the Latin script. In other words, nothing in Chinese or Korean or Japanese or Arabic. We hadn't built the Internet out. So what the community did is allowed people to propose names. That is why we ended up with thousands of names proposed. There were no rules or structure about knowing that we would have one in the complaint category and one in the car category. If the community were to move in that direction for the next round, we would need several years probably of policy to come up with the structure of how many would we have in each category. There are plenty of conversations along the lines of what you suggested, the idea of categories as opposed to wide-open season, like we have had in this round. But it would take the community to develop that. Mr. Issa. Okay. Quickly, because my time has expired. Mr. Metalitz. Yes, I would agree. What you have described is how ICANN approached this most recent round. And while the jury is still out because they are only halfway through the round, I think we are going to find that the public has not been served by letting anybody who wants to get any domain name, top-level domain that they wish without any criteria and without ICANN really making any decisions, letting them do that. Mr. Woodcock. There are technical security reasons for allowing a brand TLD, allowing corporations to register their own top-level domain in order to be able to secure it more effectively. Mr. Issa. I will close with just one statement. That letter from Fish and Richardson says to me please don't say that this is legalized extortion. Please don't say that when we have an auctioning process that not only makes more money in debt relief to ICANN but, in fact, charges exorbitant prices to the very people who already own the intellectual property that is effectively being ransomed, please don't call it legalized extortion. Well, I take great pride that under speech and debate, right or wrong, I call it legalized extortion. I now recognize the Ranking Member. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Metalitz--I hope I got that right. Mr. Metalitz, a recent NetNames study found that 24 percent of global Internet traffic is dedicated to the infringing transfer of copyrighted content. Other data indicate that 68 percent of the top 500 pirate sites reside on U.S. registries; 59 percent reside on .com, .net, and .org, giving them an air of legitimacy. What contractual requirements and obligations should registries, registrars and registrants have to deal with this that we don't have? Mr. Metalitz. Thank you for that question, Mr. Nadler. You have correctly stated that we have a huge problem in the legacy top-level domains, com and net and org, and that the contractual restrictions in their contracts with ICANN are not sufficient. One of the things that has been pointed out is there may be ways that we can use some of the advances that were made in the gTLD space. The new gTLDs had to take on some additional commitments to respond to copyright, piracy, and trademark counterfeiting in their spaces. We should look at applying those to the legacy gTLDs as well. That is part of the ICANN answer. Obviously, there may be things that can be done on a legislative level because these registries are based in the United States. Mr. Nadler. To look back---- Mr. Metalitz. Pardon? Mr. Nadler. To look back and apply some of what is being applied to the new domain names to the old ones. Mr. Metalitz. Yes, and it is a step forward that this registrar accreditation agreement does apply to registrations in .com and .net. So pirate sites or sites engaged in illegal pharmacies can be addressed that way, if those agreements are enforced. Mr. Nadler. Okay, thank you. Ms. Stark, what are your views on the legality of the fee structure for early registration of certain premium .SUCKS domains at nearly $2,500? I understand there are a set of rights protection mechanisms and operators of new gTLDs which are intended to achieve the laudable goal of combatting cyber- squatting. As the chief trademark counsel of a major U.S. corporation, do you believe the structure being forwarded by Vox Populi with the ascent of ICANN violates at least the spirit of the registry agreement? And what can be done about it? Ms. Stark. I absolutely do believe that it violates the spirit of the agreement. I mean, the whole purpose of these rights protection mechanisms, like the clearinghouse, were to make an efficient system for intellectual property owners to protect their rights, and ultimately to help protect consumers from confusion and other types of abuse online. So when you take that mechanism and use it and turn it on its head to create some sort of premium pricing structure so that people who are being responsible and taking advantage of the mechanisms that the community developed to help them navigate this new world and you turn that on its head and turn it into a premium pricing structure, I absolutely think that violates the spirit---- Mr. Nadler. So that should be banned. Ms. Stark. I do think that you don't---- Mr. Nadler. That pricing structure, that is, should be banned. Ms. Stark. I don't think that you want to necessarily set premium--I am not saying there can't be premium pricing or that you can't have all kinds of pricing arrangements. I just don't think that you want to do it in a way that takes something that is meant to protect trademark owners and harm them. Mr. Nadler. Well, it would be easy--I don't know that it would be right, but it would be easy to say no premium pricing arrangements. If you didn't say that, how would you distinguish decent ones from ones that shouldn't be allowed? Ms. Stark. So, I think that is a process that has to come up through the community in the multi-stakeholder process. There are many different relevant stakeholders in that process, and if there are going to be limits on what happens in pricing, that should come from the community. Mr. Nadler. Okay. So Congress shouldn't do anything about this. We should leave it to the multi-stakeholder process. Ms. Stark. I think if we really are going to believe in the model, there should be oversight but that the model should be allowed to work. Mr. Nadler. Okay, than you. Mr. Zuck, the concerns over new gTLDs and potential IP and trademark infringements are well known. But there are extensive infringements in the .com space. I understand there are over 65,000 .com's that incorporate the word ``sucks,'' for example. Shouldn't these be equally concerning? And what can you tell the Committee about plans for adding additional rights protections to legacy gTLDs like .com? Mr. Zuck. Thank you for the question. It is, in fact, the case that a lot of these issues have come up in the old TLDs, as you mentioned, and ``sucks'' shows up plenty of different places. So there is a constant and ongoing debate about whether there is a difference between the second-level and the top- level domain in terms of the terms used. I think a strong argument can be made that there is closer monitoring needed for the top-level domains, the stuff to the right of the period, than is necessarily necessary inside of an individual domain. I think, as Mr. Metalitz said, I think taking some of the new contract arrangements that have been developed for the new gTLDs and applying them to the old ones can go a long way. But the reality is that a lot of the principles of protection are already in place, and it is just an execution issue of getting those contracts better enforced. That is the best thing that we can do, and to make sure the WHOIS database is accurate so that IP owners can go after infringers. Those are the key issues. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. Mr. Corwin, my last question, because I see the warning light is on. In your testimony you say there are too many new gTLDs. Will the market take care of an over-supply, or should ICANN have limited the number of applications from the outset, or should they now limit the number? Mr. Corwin. I am not sure I said there are too many. I said that the jury is still out on the overall success of the program. So far--and I represent professional domain investors, and they are being very selective about which new gTLDs they are acquiring, new domains. The way I have thought about it is what company would introduce 1,400 new products in an 18-month period? I don't know any company that would do that. The market gets confused when there is that much new choice and new product. Even people within the community have a hard time keeping up with all the new names introduced each week, and as a result we see some of the leading top-level domains in terms of total registrations offering domains free or for 49 cents to a dollar to hype up their numbers, but it is not clear that anyone is going to renew those domains when they push the prices up to market price. So the jury is out, but I just don't personally see market demand for 1,400 new ones, of which 800 are for the general public. Could I just speak briefly to your last question? Mr. Nadler. By all means. Mr. Corwin. The .SUCKS second-level domain treatment under the World Intellectual Property Organization arbitration guidance, particularly in North America and the U.S. where we have the First Amendment, is if you have company name Sucks.com, if it is a Web site used for legitimate criticism of a company or an individual, it is not infringement. If it is using that name and then infringing on their trademarks or their copyright and intellectual property, it is infringement. So you have to look at the content of the Web site. But the big difference is that nobody with a .com Sucks site is asking $2,500 a year to register it. Mr. Nadler. Why is that? If I may, why is nobody doing that on the legacy TLDs? Mr. Corwin. Excuse me? Mr. Nadler. Why is nobody doing that on .com? You are saying they are doing it on the new ones, they are not doing it on the old ones. Why? Mr. Corwin. A .com site pricing is frozen right now under a Commerce Department decision, and the other incumbent top-level domains tended to price around the same amount as .com, around $8 per domain per year, simply to be competitive. They couldn't get too high above that price and attract customers. Mr. Nadler. My time has expired. Thank you. Mr. Issa. Would the gentleman briefly yield for a follow- up? Mr. Nadler. I will yield my non-existent time gladly. Mr. Issa. Thank you. [Laughter.] I just want to follow up and understand this. I have looked, and JerryNadlerSucks.com and .org both are available. DarrellIssaSucks.com and .org, for anyone that wants them, are available, and I am sure someone will find them. But they are, in fact, at GoDaddy $9.99 and $7.99, respectively. Mr. Nadler. We are not in great demand. Mr. Issa. We are not in great demand. But my understanding is that AmazonSucks.com has been bought up by Amazon. The fact is that there has already been a long legacy of buying names to try to protect them. This latest shakedown is because there is now a new name and a new opportunity, and it is not available for first-come/first-serve. In other words, GoDaddy and the other sellers are not out there competing, something that we believe in, to try to sell you a name that multiple people can sell. You have an exclusive holder of a name who is holding it ransom as a form of extortion. Isn't that correct? Mr. Corwin. Certainly there is a big difference between DarrellIssaSucks.com--excuse me for saying that; it is not my personal belief--being available---- Mr. Issa. The hearing is young. [Laughter.] Mr. Corwin. If it is registered, if it is criticizing your views on politics, it is okay. If it---- Mr. Issa. But I am only dealing with the price. Mr. Corwin. But you can still acquire it for $9.99 a year, not $2,500 a year. To answer what Ms. Stark said, there was an ICANN staff report on new rights protection mechanisms, and this was the numbers as of February. At that time there were 4 million total registrations in new TLDs, but there were 25 million claims notices generated. Now, let me explain that. When someone starts to register a term that is registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse, let's say it is Amazon, they get a notice that your use of this domain may be infringing, and then it is their decision. If they want a Web site about the Amazon rain forest, they can go ahead. If they want to pretend they are Amazon, they do it at their own risk. In my opinion, there were not six times as many attempts to register infringing domains as there were actual domains registered at that point in time, and I have written an article about this. I have talked to the Trademark Clearinghouse people at the INTA meeting last week in San Diego. The only explanation I can get is that some parties--and they may be operators of new registries--began registrations not with the intent of registering domains but to find out--every time they get a claims notice back they say, oh, that name is in the clearinghouse, and now I can set a premium price for it. So a mechanism that was put in place to protect trademark holders is now being used to set extremely high prices from trademark holders. Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Our time has expired. Mr. Forbes? Mr. Forbes. Mr. Chairman, thank you. One aspect of the proposed transfer that we have not talked about in this Committee but has received attention in the House Armed Services Committee on which I serve is what happens to the .mil and .gov top-level domains? Even though .mil and .gov are used by the U.S. military, first responders, and Federal and state government agencies, the U.S. Government may not actually own those domains. So I would like to ask Mr. Corwin and Mr. DelBianco whether you agree that a reasonable condition of the IANA transition should include a written agreement that the U.S. Government has an exclusive, perpetual, no-cost right to those domains. Mr. DelBianco. Thank you, Representative Forbes. It is quite easy, I think, for ICANN to give DOD and GSA permanent contracts, permanent, irrevocable contracts for .mil and .gov. What is harder, though, is to ensure that we have legal reach to force ICANN to honor those contracts, and let me explain. This is about the risks of having a .gov or .mil be redirected during an emergency, like a coordinated attack on U.S. systems and infrastructure. For over 100 countries, their .gov domain is at the second level, to the left of the dot of gov.ca for Canada or .uk for the U.K. Another 50 countries have .mil to the left of the dot for their country code. What is the difference? Well, their .gov and .mil is housed in a server on their soil, under their law and under their total control. For the U.S., it is a little different. As the inventor of the Internet, our .mil and .gov are at the top level, or the root of the DNS, and that is what the IANA contract is all about. So we ought to ensure that ICANN remains subject to U.S. law and that the root remains physically on U.S. soil to address the concerns that you brought up, and we have a stress test on that, you will be glad to know we found that Article 18 of ICANN's bylaws requires the principal office of ICANN to stay in California, and if ICANN board attempted to change the bylaws, one of those new powers I described earlier could block that change. But if this community and this Committee feels strongly, we could move Article 18 to the fundamental bylaws of the transition. That would mean that the community would have to give 75 percent approval of the board's attempt to leave the United States' jurisdiction. Mr. Forbes. Good. Mr. Corwin? Mr. Corwin. Just to add to that, this is the legacy of the fact that the United States invented the Internet and created these two top-level domains for military and government use. The transition should, of course, ensure that there are permanent contracts for the U.S. to continue operating them in perpetuity. This is also why it is important that ICANN's jurisdiction stay within the U.S. It is also important to maintain U.S. jurisdiction because--I want to commend ICANN. ICANN has funded two very expert outside law firms to work at the direction of the community to design the new accountability measures, but they are being designed to fit within the framework of California public benefit corporation law, and if the jurisdiction ever changes, the accountability measures may no longer work or work as effectively. So keeping these requires a contract, and making sure that it stays stable over the decades requires maintaining U.S. jurisdiction. Mr. Forbes. Good. Thank you. Ms. Stark and Mr. Misener, I am not sure if I will be able to get this question in my time, but if you were to visit ICANN's Web site and read the description for the Government Advisory Committee, it states: ``The GAC is not a decision- making body. However, there are growing concerns regarding the GAC's influence over ICANN's multi-stakeholder process.'' As representatives who are involved in the multi- stakeholder process at ICANN, can you shed some light on any notable examples where the GAC has interfered in the multi- stakeholder process which directly impacted your company or your respective companies? And what can be done to curb the growing influence of the GAC over the ICANN board of directors? And what type of unintended consequences do you think the IANA transition will have on the GAC? Either one of you can get that. I only have about 60 seconds. Mr. Misener. Thank you, Mr. Forbes, very much. We have a very clear example of where the Government Advisory Committee stepped in and caused the board to reverse what had been a fairly straightforward process in which we had applied for a .AMAZON and some affiliated top-level domain names. We support the proposed accountability reforms for ICANN, and I think they are a great idea. But I think, very importantly, they can't just be applied prospectively. ICANN always should have been accountable, and they shouldn't just now start to be accountable when they are forced to be so. Mr. Forbes. Ms. Stark, anything you would like to add? Ms. Stark. I would just say that we do think that the Government Advisory Council plays a very important role in the process and should be advisory. But as the Amazon example shows, it is dangerous when any one or a few governments are able to block what has been the process that was created by the full multi-stakeholder community. Mr. Forbes. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Issa. Thank you. I now ask unanimous consent that the letter that prompted the earlier letter from IPC be placed in the record. Without objection, so ordered. We also are in receipt of a letter from ICANN that I would like placed in the record. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Issa. We now go to the gentleman from Michigan for his thoughtful questions and comments. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow up on a Nadler-type question, which I would start off with Mr. Metalitz. We have discussed something about the obligations on registrars and ICANN. Now, in your view, are the registrars meeting these obligations, and is ICANN enforcing them sufficiently? Mr. Metalitz. Thank you, Mr. Conyers. Well, with respect to the particular obligations I talked about in my testimony, the obligation to investigate and respond when they receive a report that a domain name that they have sold is being used to carry out illegal activity, no, I do not think that the registrars are complying with that, and I do not think that ICANN is yet requiring them to do so. This is something we are continuing to engage both with ICANN and with registrars about. But if you take a snapshot today, these provisions are not being enforced. Mr. Conyers. Mr. Horton, do you concur with that view? Turn on your mic. Mr. Horton. My apologies, Mr. Conyers. I concur with part of it. Our experience has been a little bit different. As I testified, we have actually seen that most domain name registrars voluntarily terminate services to illegal online pharmacies, and that may be because of the health and safety risks involved in that particular area. It is a relatively small number of domain name registrars that are responsible for most of the problem. But again, I am only talking about one particular area of abuse. We don't keep data on these other types of areas. I do concur, however, that when a complaint is submitted to ICANN compliance, that they are not requiring compliance with Section 3.18. The core problem is this phrase ``to respond appropriately.'' What does that mean? They have latitude to interpret that, and they have not done so in an effective way. Mr. Conyers. Ms. Stark, how do you weigh in on this question? Ms. Stark. I agree with Mr. Horton that there are some registrars that are very good about responding. But I do think that ICANN has not devoted enough resources in general to compliance, and that there are important parts of the contract that need greater attention from ICANN directly. Mr. Conyers. Now, Mr. Zuck, you are on ICANN's IP working group. How does your experience stack up to the other contributions that have been made thus far? Mr. Zuck. Thank you for the question, Congressman. I guess our experience has been similar. I have been kind of assigned within the intellectual property constituency to be sort of the hound dog to the compliance department inside ICANN, and I was horrified to discover a few years ago that their database of complaints and responses was a folder in Outlook some 10 years into the organization's growth. So I think that they have come a long way from the standpoint of even keeping track of what they are doing over the past 5 years, and they still need to do a lot better job, and I think that the new gTLD program came at a time that made it easy to overwhelm them, but I think they have made some progress. But"
