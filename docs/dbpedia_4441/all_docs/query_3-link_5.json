        "text": "In the November 1922 general election in the two-member seat of Dundee, Winston Churchill, Liberal member of Parliament for the city since 1908, lost his seat to Edwin Scrymgeour (Prohibitionist) and E. D. Morel (Labour). Before 1914, Morel, like Churchill, had been a member of the Liberal Party, and this article compares the political trajectory of Churchill and Morel across the war period in order to understand how their positions had diverged. While still a Liberal in party affiliation in 1922, Churchill was en route back to the Conservative Party, while Morel had become a prominent figure in the Labour Party. In examining this divergence, the aim is to shed light on one of the key issues of British politics in early twentieth-century Britain: the divisions in the Liberal party that undermined its place as one of the two leading political parties. The purpose is not to displace arguments about long-run socioeconomic change undermining the Liberals, nor of the severe impact of total war on Liberal thinking about the scope of state action; rather, it is to use this example to also stress the significance for the party of sharp divergences over war and peace, and more broadly, the conduct of foreign policy.\n\n1 Thompson, J. A., “The Historians and the Decline of the Liberal Party,” Albion 22, no. 1 (1990): 65–83CrossRefGoogle Scholar, makes clear how much of the historical debate was tied to contemporary politics—which in no way disparages the quality of the work produced. Important recent work has been done on the meaning and significance of the heightened class consciousness commonly linked to the war; see Lawrence, Jon, “Labour and the Politics of Class, 1900–1940,” in Structures and Transformations in Modern British History, ed. Feldman, David and Lawrence, Jon (Cambridge, 2011), 237–60CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n2 Searle, Geoffrey, The Liberal Party: Triumph and Disintegration, 1886–1929, 2nd ed. (Basingstoke, 2001), 125, 168Google Scholar. For a treatment that focuses on the effects of the war, Dutton, David, A History of the Liberal Party (Basingstoke, 2004), 55Google Scholar, argues that “the more evidence that has been accumulated to show that the Liberal party was not in danger of imminent collapse in 1914, the more significance has to be attached to the war as the explanation for what happened subsequently.”\n\n18 Martin Gilbert, Winston S.

His most extended discussion was published after the war: E. D. Morel, The Black Man's Burden (1903; repr., London, 1920). See also Porter, Critics of Empire, 256–60.\n\n41 Winston Churchill, Speech to the House of Commons, 12 July 1910, Parliamentary Debates, Commons, 5th series, vol. 19 (1909–10), col. 221. Churchill continued his opposition when a far more straightforward proposal was put forward in 1911–1912. Much is revealed by the terms of that rejection: “What a ridiculous tragedy it would be if this strong Government and party which made its mark on history were to go down on Petticoat politics.” Cited in Addison, Churchill on the Home Front, 160–61.
