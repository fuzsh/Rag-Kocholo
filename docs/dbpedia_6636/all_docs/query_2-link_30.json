        "text": "The two-year Associate in Applied Science (AAS) is a thorough introduction to photography. Here, you’ll learn digital and analog still photography, black and white printing, color theory, and digital post-production. You’ll learn the skills needed to create a portfolio and start a career in photography, though many students go on to the two-year BFA program.\n\nYou’ll learn about lighting, composition, retouching, and professional business practices while gaining hands-on experience in both studio and location settings, exploring portraiture, fashion, still life, documentary, and video art. You will also tap into a vast network of contacts in New York City through seminars, guest lectures, and industry events. In your last semester, you’ll engage in a required internship and be challenged to create work that’s provocative, evocative, relevant, and timeless.\n\nIf you have an AAS in Photography and Related Media from FIT, you may apply. Learn more about eligibility for this program."
