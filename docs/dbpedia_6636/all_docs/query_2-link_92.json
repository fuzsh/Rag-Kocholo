Our list includes states that have legalized use of the marijuana plant for medical purposes, or have been listed by the by the Marijuana Policy Project as having an effective medical marijuana program. States that limit use to the nonpsychoactive marijuana extract called cannabidiol (CBD) are not included on this list, although we do keep track of those legal CBD states in our resource States with Laws Specifically about Legal Cannabidiol (CBD). Also not included are states whose legalization laws require physicians to “prescribe” marijuana (an illegal act under federal law) vs. “recommend” marijuana (considered protected free speech between doctor and patient), as well as states that have passed “affirmative defense” laws in which arrested marijuana users are allowed to mention medical use in their defense.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, several states passed symbolic laws that liberalized their medical marijuana policies to some degree. For example, some states wrote laws that legalized medical marijuana with a physician’s prescription, however, those laws are considered symbolic laws because federal law prohibits physicians from “prescribing” marijuana, a schedule I drug. Some states wrote laws creating research programs to investigate medical use of marijuana; others allowed for “medical necessity” as a defense in state court. None of these laws made marijuana available to patients with a doctor’s recommendation, and are thus considered symbolic.\n\nAll states require proof of residency to apply to be qualifying patients, although the length of time considered to be a resident varies by state. Some state require registration and registry fees.\n\n*Please consult the state for the most recent information.\n\n1. Alabama\n\n2. Alaska\n\n3. Arizona\n\n4. Arkansas\n\n5. California\n\n6.
