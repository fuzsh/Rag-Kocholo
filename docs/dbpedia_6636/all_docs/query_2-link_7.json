As an organization, we value ongoing training, safety, and professionalism.\n\nBecause Stowe’s population includes both 4,300 year-round residents and 8,000-10,000 annual visitors and covers the second largest Vermont town in area, our team must remain nimble and flexible. In addition, Stowe is a member of mutual aid systems in Lamoille and Washington counties, working alongside Waterbury, Morristown, and Cambridge fire departments.\n\nOur job is to be ready if you need us!\n\nFor people who want to serve their community in the fire service, there’s such a variety of jobs and responsibilities that every volunteer has a place.\n\nWe welcome anyone with a positive attitude, strong work ethic, and servant’s heart. Volunteering at the fire service means learning new skills, teamwork, fire science, fire pumps and equipment, hand tools, public safety, and education—and lots of camaraderie! Stowe firefighters are paid volunteers, which means they’re paid when they respond to calls and for their biweekly trainings.\n\nInterested in joining us?\n\nComplete an employment application and contact Interim Chief Scott Reeves at [email protected]"
