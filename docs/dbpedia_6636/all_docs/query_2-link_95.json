        "text": "The challenge: spend a week hiding in an abandoned amusement park and don’t get caught.\n\nThe prize: enough money to change everything.\n\nEven though everyone is desperate to win–to seize their dream futures or escape their haunting pasts–Mack feels sure that she can beat her competitors. All she has to do is hide, and she’s an expert at that.\n\nIt’s the reason she’s alive, and her family isn’t.\n\nBut as the people around her begin disappearing one by one, Mack realizes this competition is more sinister than even she imagined, and that together might be the only way to survive.\n\nFourteen competitors. Seven days. Everywhere to hide, but nowhere to run.\n\nCome out, come out, wherever you are.\n\nThe ferris wheel on the cover immediately caught my attention. Then I saw it was written by a YA author I’ve read before, and this was her adult debut. Once I read the description I was sold.\n\nA week in an abandoned amusement park with a tragic history playing a warped game of hide and go seek. If you’re not found, a significant amount of cash is the prize. Mack, who bounces between homeless shelters, has a distinct advantage over the other thirteen contestants – she was the only survivor in her family when her father went on a killing spree and murdered her mother and sister. Mack knew where to hide.\n\nMack is the main focus of the story, but POV alternates between several characters. They come from all walks of life, but each has a reason for wanting to win the game varying from fame to making friends. After the first couple of days, it becomes clear this isn’t your average reality show. Once you’re found, you’re not just out of the game – you’re dead.\n\nThe aging, abandoned rides lend a macabre atmosphere to the story – a haunted house, decrepit roller coaster, and a sinister tunnel of love just to name a few. I actually snickered when one contestant shelved his fear of clowns to hide inside the mouth of one in a bizarre display. I rooted for several characters to make it to the end – some survived, others didn’t. Besides being hunted, the contestants also learned to be wary of each other. Some play dirty.\n\nThe description gives no indication of the direction this story takes. It’s unexpected, but I was completely on board with it. There’s a reason these contestants are chosen. I admit the multiple POVs confused me at times. There’s a good bit of head-hopping going on, with multiple changes on the same page sometimes. I had to backtrack more than once to figure it out.\n\nHide has an imaginative premise that immediately intrigued me and kept me glued to the pages. It isn’t heavy on the horror, so it would also appeal to supernatural thriller fans.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nCreated as an homage to the 1980 classic horror anthology, Dark Forces, edited by Kirby McCauley, this collection contains 12 original novelettes showcasing today’s top horror talent. Dark Stars features all-new stories from award-winning authors and up-and-coming voices like Stephen Graham Jones, Priya Sharma, Usman T. Malik, Caroline Kepnes, and Alma Katsu, with seasoned author John F.D. Taff at the helm. An afterword from original Dark Forces contributor Ramsey Campbell is a poignant finale to this bone-chilling collection.\n\nWithin these pages you’ll find tales of dead men walking, an insidious secret summer fling, an island harboring unspeakable power, and a dark hallway that beckons. You’ll encounter terrible monsters—both human and supernatural—and be forever changed. The stories in Dark Stars run the gamut from traditional to modern, from dark fantasy to neo-noir, from explorations of beloved horror tropes to the unknown—possibly unknowable—threats.\n\nIt’s all in here because it’s all out there, now, in horror.\n\nI was so excited to see this anthology – I’m a fan of several of the featured authors. Having their short stories bundled together was such a treat.\n\nAs with any collection, I liked some of these stories better than others. My favorites included the following: All the Things He Called Memories by Stephen Graham Jones. This is a horror story set during Covid when a couple are quarantined together. It has a creepy, slow madness that gradually seeps into your bones.\n\nThe Familiar’s Assistant by Alma Katsu – I’m always a vampire fan, but this was more about the new familiar (as it’s adequately titled) and his relationship with the current familiar. Let’s just say he has aspirations.\n\nMrs. Addison’s Nest by Josh Malerman – The line between dreams, reality, and the past are blurred as four friends try to determine the difference. I enjoyed the nod to Christopher Nolan’s Memento.\n\nI admit some of the stories I didn’t get. They were confusing or ended abruptly, and I shrugged and moved on to the next one. Maybe they were just over my head.\n\nThis is an eclectic mix of horror and thriller authors that is sure to appeal to fans of those genres. I settled in with some favorites as well as discovered some new ones.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nWelcome author Shelley Wilson to the blog! Her latest novel, The Last Princess, releases today, but it’s not only her book’s birthday – it’s also Shelley’s 50th birthday, so it’s a double celebration! Just take a look at that stunning cover. And who doesn’t like a good Viking tale?\n\nShelley is an English multi-genre author. She has written nine young adult/middle-grade supernatural, fantasy, and historical novels, a children’s meditation book, and six motivational self-help titles for adults.\n\nShe is a proud single mum of three and lives in the West Midlands, UK. Shelley loves travelling in her VW camper searching for stories. She also enjoys paddle boarding, Tudor and Viking history, supporting Leeds United, and obsessing over to-do lists!\n\nHer latest book, The Last Princess, is out on 24th May 2022, published by BHC Press Books.\n\nWhat is your writing process like? Are you more of a plotter or a pantser?\n\nI’m a plotter! For years I operated in the pantser zone and wondered why I never finished anything I started, and then I took part in my first NaNoWriMo and read how outlining helped other writers.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the process of plotting and planning while still leaving plenty of wiggle room for those unexpected plot twists, and my writing output has increased. Instead of filling notebooks with ideas that never see the light of day, I now write and finish my books. The Last Princess is my sixteenth published title and I have a duology waiting in the wings for release dates.\n\nPlotting has been instrumental in my productivity.\n\nHave you ever travelled as research for your books?\n\nSince buying my camper van I’ve been all over England, Scotland, and Wales searching for stories and researching for my books. It’s one of my favourite perks of being an author.\n\nThe Last Princess is set in Northumberland in the UK, so I took a couple of trips up to Bamburgh, Lindisfarne, and Alnmouth to get a feel for the area. It’s a beautiful part of the country and I loved using this setting in my book. It’s also partly set in Hedeby (now part of Germany), but due to a global pandemic, I had to do that research online!\n\nThe duology I recently completed is set in Whitby, North Yorkshire and I had a fun week exploring the area as part of that research.\n\nStanding in the same spot your character stands is a special moment and I love reading back over specific scenes as I can almost smell the sea air and hear the waves.\n\nAre any of your characters similar to you or anyone you know?\n\nAll my main characters are young girls who lack confidence but learn to believe in themselves and find inner strength. Yes, I guess they are similar to me. They are what I wished I’d been like at sixteen or seventeen. I was well into my forties before I found my courage!\n\nI watch my daughter and her friends and marvel at how switched on they are. These girls know their own minds, support and empower one another, and don’t stand any nonsense. I want my characters to be like them. They also navigate worry, anxiety, and the usual coming-of-age pitfalls, but they deal with it much better than I ever did at their age.\n\nThe antagonists are a culmination of all the playground and office bullies I’ve had the misfortune of meeting over the years. The saying ‘be careful or you’ll end up in my novel’ is so true!\n\nI think all authors are influenced by the people they meet in life whether the experiences were good or bad.\n\nIf you could spend a day with one of your characters who would it be?\n\nSolveig! She is a shield maiden who trains Edith to fight in a Viking army. I had a clear image of what she looked like in my mind and found myself smiling whenever I wrote her scenes. Solveig has an ‘I don’t care’ attitude but deep down she is fiercely loyal to her friends.\n\nThere is a back story that shows the reader why Solveig is so closed off, but you do get to see her true warmth and humour. She would be a fascinating character to spend the day with.\n\nDo you celebrate when your books are published?\n\nI am a nightmare when it comes to celebrating. A few years ago I was on a radio show where the host asked me what I’d done on publication day and my answer was ‘a big grocery shop!’ We giggled about it off the air and she made me promise to at least buy myself a bunch of flowers.\n\nPublication day of The Last Princess is going to be very different though as it’s also my 50th birthday. I’m not sure which I’m most excited about, to be honest, but there will definitely be cake!\n\nI am getting better at celebrating my successes these days and look forward to holding a copy of my book in one hand and a mocktail in the other. I’ll be sure to share a photo on social media as proof.\n\nThe Last Princess, is out on 24th May 2022, published by BHC Press Books.\n\nThe Last Princess Blurb\n\nNorthumbria, 866 AD\n\nEdith still has much to learn about the art of ruling a kingdom, but when her family is murdered, she’s faced with the challenge of staying alive.\n\nAs a young woman in Anglo-Saxon England, Edith finds it hard to be heard above the Eldermen who are ripping the kingdom to pieces, but nothing can prepare her for the arrival of the pirates and the Vikings. Torn from her homeland and sold into slavery, she’s determined to survive at any cost.\n\nFinding allies in the unexpected and enemies closer to home, Edith clings to her dream of returning home one day to reclaim her throne and to exact revenge on those who harmed her family.\n\nBUY your copy of The Last Princess\n\nBHC Press – https://www.bhcpress.com/Books_Wilson_The_Last_Princess.html\n\nAmazon UK\n\nAmazon US\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nWaterstones\n\nGoogle Play\n\nKobo\n\nApple Books\n\nConnect with Shelley:\n\nAuthor website: https://shelleywilsonauthor.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FantasyAuthorSLWilson/\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/ShelleyWilson72\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/authorslwilson/\n\nPublisher: https://www.bhcpress.com/Author_SL_Wilson.html\n\nEarly Praise for The Last Princess:\n\n“This fast-paced historical novel builds on an obscure Anglo-Saxon king’s life to tell an empowering tale of a girl’s journey to fully embrace a new world, a new culture…as she grows into her own as a warrior. Edith’s fierce and often violent quest for revenge is juxtaposed with lovely, life-affirming moments of friendship and love in an engaging first-person narrative.” – Kirkus Reviews\n\n“I LOVED this quick fantasy read. I can’t wait to share with my students once I get a copy.” – Dawn, Teacher & Goodreads Reviewer\n\n“WOW! I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but this wasn’t it! This story is absolutely amazing.” – Rebecca, Goodreads Reviewer\n\nIt’s finally here! A little over two years after the release of the first book in this duology, Subject A36, the sequel is now out in the world. These characters and I fought during the pandemic, but finally mended our ways, found common ground and finished their story. Some days I wasn’t so sure we’d make it, but despite all the strife, I sure am going to miss them.\n\nIf you haven’t read Subject A36 (The Colony #1), next week is the perfect opportunity to get caught up – it will be on sale for $0.99 May 25th through May 27th!\n\nI’m also giving away signed copies (US only) or ebooks (international) of the duology to one lucky winner! All you have to do is comment on any of my social media (here, Twitter or Instagram @tpolen6 or Facebook at Teri Polen, Author) and a random commenter will be chosen next Friday, May 27th!\n\nI’ll be slow getting to comments over the next couple days due to moving my son (flying to Austin, loading a UHaul, then driving back to KY – woohoo!), but I’ll get to everyone as soon as I can.\n\nSharing is appreciated!\n\nPurchase Links\n\nAmazon (print, ebook, and Kindle Unlimited)\n\nBarnes & Noble (print only)\n\nBlack Rose Writing (print only)\n\nIf a megalomaniac threatened your family, would you give up your freedom for them? Would you give up your soul?\n\nAsher Solomon is faced with that choice. And makes the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nExactly as Director Silas Reeves expected him to.\n\nUnable to live as the Colony’s premier assassin, Ash retreats to a corner of his mind, ceding control of his body to the alter-ego he was engineered to be—Subject A36. As he’s unleashed to battle the Insurgents, the only family he ever knew, the tide of war shifts in Silas’s favor.\n\nCombined with his expansion into new territories, the director is poised to take over the world.\n\nBut the Insurgents don’t give up easily. Not on their cause, and not on their people. With the help of a few double agents deep in the Colony, they stand a fighting chance at ending Silas’s reign.\n\nIn order to shut down the program, they face almost insurmountable odds. And their most dangerous foe—their former champion turned killing machine, A36.\n\nMerida goes on an all-new, life-changing adventure in this original YA novel set several years after the close of Brave!\n\nWhat if you had one year to save everything you loved?\n\nONE PRINCESS. Merida of DunBroch needs a change. She loves her family—jovial King Fergus, proper Queen Elinor, the mischievous triplets— and her peaceful kingdom. But she’s frustrated by its sluggishness; each day, the same. Merida longs for adventure, purpose, challenge – maybe even, someday, love.\n\nTWO GODS. But the fiery Princess never expects her disquiet to manifest by way of Feradach, an uncanny supernatural being tasked with rooting out rot and stagnation, who appears in DunBroch on Christmas Eve with the intent to demolish the realm – and everyone within. Only the intervention of the Cailleach, an ancient entity of creation, gives Merida a shred of hope: convince her family to change within the year – or suffer the eternal consequences.\n\nTHREE VOYAGES. Under the watchful eyes of the gods, Merida leads a series of epic journeys to kingdoms near and far in an attempt to inspire revolution within her family. But in her efforts to save those she loves from ruin, has Merida lost sight of the Clan member grown most stagnant of all – herself?\n\nFOUR SEASONS TO SAVE DUNBROCH – OR SEE IT DESTROYED, FOREVER.\n\nIf you’re wondering if this is Princess Merida from the Disney movie, you’d be correct. I requested this book from NetGalley because Stiefvater is one of my favorite authors – I’d never seen the movie Brave. Knowing I needed the gist of the story before starting the novel, I spent an entertaining couple of hours laughing and snorting my way through the movie. I adored these characters and couldn’t wait to dive into this new story.\n\nI’ve never been one for many fairy tales, but Merida is my kind of princess – mainly because she’s pretty much the opposite of what you’d expect from someone with that title. She can best nearly any opponent in archery, she informed her parents being married off and producing heirs isn’t something she’ll be forced into, and she’s constantly reminded of royal etiquette by her mother, the queen. How can you not love this girl? This story is set several years later when not much has changed – Merida is still adventurous and stubborn, the King Fergus boisterous, the Queen Elinor very royal, and the triplets still mischievous at ten years old.\n\nMerida’s Christmas Eve doesn’t go as expected when she finds herself in the company of two gods – one of creation, Cailleach, and one of destruction, Feradach. The Kingdom of DunBroch has become sluggish and stagnant and is high on Feradach’s list of places to demolish. Naturally, Merida is distraught but, because she’s Merida and very clever, refuses to accept this. Instead, she makes a bargain with Cailleach – if she can get her family to change over the next year, DunBroch will be spared. If she fails, she’ll lose her home and family. Talk about high stakes and pressure.\n\nDon’t expect this to be a cookie cutter Disney story. Bravely is darker and focuses on growth, survival, and reflection, along with epic journeys and and some grisly scenes. Merida learns life is about balance and realizes what’s most important – it’s a kind of coming of age story for her. Not everything is serious – I also laughed out loud several times over the antics of the triplets, Merida’s unfiltered comments, and the lively family dynamics.\n\nAfter watching Brave, Merida immediately became my favorite Disney princess, and I fell in love with her family. Catching up with them in this novel set several years later was a real treat.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nSometimes bitter rivalries can brew something sweet.\n\nTheo Mori wants to escape. Leaving Vermont for college means getting away from working at his parents’ Asian American café and dealing with their archrivals’ hopeless son Gabi who’s lost the soccer team more games than Theo can count.\n\nGabi Moreno is miserably stuck in the closet. Forced to play soccer to hide his love for dance and iced out by Theo, the only openly gay guy at school, Gabi’s only reprieve is his parents’ Puerto Rican bakery and his plans to take over after graduation.\n\nBut the town’s new fusion café changes everything. Between the Mori’s struggling shop and the Moreno’s plan to sell their bakery in the face of the competition, both boys find their dreams in jeopardy. Then Theo has an idea—sell photo-worthy food covertly at school to offset their losses. When he sprains his wrist and Gabi gets roped in to help, they realize they need to work together to save their parents’ shops but will the new feelings rising between them be enough to send their future plans up in smoke?\n\nA light enemies to lovers story – but with scrumptious food. The description of competing restaurants – and boys – lured me in. And look at that cover!\n\nThe chapters alternate POVs between Theo and Gabi, both with very different and distinct personalities. Theo is openly gay, self confident, and a natural athlete. Gabi is closeted, lacks self esteeem, and is far more talented on the dance floor than a soccer field. Theo can’t stand to be near Gabi, and while Gabi admires Theo, he’s also a little intimidated by him. Their parents’ restaurants are long time competitors, which causes further conflict. When a new fusion café moves into town and steals customers, joining forces happens kind of accidentally and everything changes.\n\nIn the first several chapters, Theo isn’t very likeable. He carries anger around like a boulder weighing him down and lashes out at his family, Gabi, and anyone else who gets in his way. It soon becomes clear why, and his self realizations and the changes that result from them are admirable. Gabi has spent his life trying to make his parents proud of him and fulfill their expectations, all while hiding his love of dancing and his sexuality. His parents (especially his father) make several derogatory comments about being gay, and he’s terrified of what might happen if he comes out. His character arc is just as uplifting as Theo’s.\n\nEvery character in this novel is flawed, some more than others, and it’s an honest portrayal of just how messy humans and their relationships can be. There are also very poignant, honest conversations about difficult topics between some characters that are done so well, and I hope they inspire readers who might be dealing with similar issues in their lives.\n\nBesides the serious moments, this story also contains plenty of humor, delicious descriptions of food, strong friendships, and a sweet enemies to lovers romance. The ending comes about a little quickly and wraps up loose ends in a tidy bow, but it didn’t diminish my enjoyment of the novel.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\n#1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black makes her stunning adult debut with Book of Night, a modern dark fantasy of shadowy thieves and secret societies in the vein of Ninth House and The Night Circus.\n\nIn Charlie Hall’s world, shadows can be altered, for entertainment and cosmetic preferences—but also to increase power and influence. You can alter someone’s feelings—and memories—but manipulating shadows has a cost, with the potential to take hours or days from your life. Your shadow holds all the parts of you that you want to keep hidden—a second self, standing just to your left, walking behind you into lit rooms. And sometimes, it has a life of its own.\n\nCharlie is a low-level con artist, working as a bartender while trying to distance herself from the powerful and dangerous underground world of shadow trading. She gets by doing odd jobs for her patrons and the naive new money in her town at the edge of the Berkshires. But when a terrible figure from her past returns, Charlie’s present life is thrown into chaos, and her future seems at best, unclear—and at worst, non-existent. Determined to survive, Charlie throws herself into a maelstrom of secrets and murder, setting her against a cast of doppelgangers, mercurial billionaires, shadow thieves, and her own sister—all desperate to control the magic of the shadows.\n\nWith sharp angles and prose, and a sinister bent, Holly Black is a master of shadow and story stitching. Remember while you read, light isn’t playing tricks in Book of Night, the people are.\n\nThis was one of my most anticipated reads this year, so receiving an ARC felt like winning the lottery.\n\nMorally gray characters are among my favorites, and there’s certainly no shortage of them here. Lucipurr the cat (adore the name) may be the only innocent. Charlie’s life hasn’t been an easy one, but a good portion of it can be blamed on her bad choices. She starts out with good intentions, but usually gets sidetracked along the way. To her credit, she owns those decisions and stands by them. I wasn’t sure how I felt about her at first. Some of her actions are maddening, but she’s also clever, street smart, loyal to her sister, and I soon found myself rooting for her. At her core she has a good heart.\n\nThis is a dark, gritty world filled with murder, magic, and bloody battles for power. I struggled at times to understand all the rules, but they became clearer along the way. I predicted a couple of the twists, but was surprised over others. Some reviewers have mentioned the slow pace at the beginning, and I agree it took a few chapters for the story to find its stride, but before long it was unputdownable. I’m not sure if this is a planned series, but the ending leaves an opening.\n\nI’d recommend this book to fantasy and horror fans looking for a gratifying blend of the genres. You’ll never look at your shadow – or those of others – in the same way again.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n\nMysterious disappearances.\n\nAn urban legend rumored to be responsible.\n\nAnd one group of teens determined to save their city at any cost.\n\nFor over a year, the Bronx has been plagued by sudden disappearances that no one can explain. Sixteen-year-old Raquel does her best to ignore it. After all, the police only look for the white kids. But when her crush Charlize’s cousin goes missing, Raquel starts to pay attention—especially when her own mom comes down with a mysterious illness that seems linked to the disappearances.\n\nRaquel and Charlize team up to investigate, but they soon discover that everything is tied to a terrifying urban legend called the Echo Game. The game is rumored to trap people in a sinister world underneath the city, and the rules are based on a particularly dark chapter in New York’s past. And if the friends want to save their home and everyone they love, they will have to play the game and destroy the evil at its heart—or die trying.\n\nComp titles of Stranger Things and Get Out immediately piqued my interest, and that fierce cover sealed the deal.\n\nSeveral teens have gone missing over the past several months, and the disappearances seem to be tied to the Echo Game. It comes with an odd set of rules (flipping a coin to decide which direction to go, never turn back, start in the wee hours of the morning), and upon entering the game, players are transported to a traumatic event that occured in their area. For these characters it was during the 70s when the Bronx was burning and over 80% of housing was lost to fires, much of it caused by slumlords who wanted to collect insurance money.\n\nYou’d be crazy to want to play, right? But what if entering the game might be the only way to save your family and friends? For Raquel and Charlize, there’s no choice – they have to play. The actions starts immediately, and the first pages pulled me right into the story. I wasn’t sure exactly what was happening, but there’s no way you could have pried the Kindle from my hands. Pride in their community and friendships between the characters are strong points – especially between Raquel and Aaron. Even when the odds weren’t in their favor, they had each other’s backs. But with so much depending on them, the characters surprised me a few times with their careless choices, and intense, dangerous moments are interrupted with sudden relationship talk that I felt interrupted the flow of the story.\n\nExpect vivid imagery inside the game. Some of the gory descriptions might not be for everyone, but I thought they added to the horror of what the characters experience and the obstacles they face to survive.\n\nWith heart-stopping scenes (I gasped out loud a couple times!), an alluring, dangerous concept, plenty of life-threatening situations, and relatable characters, horror/thriller fans will want to add this to their TBRs. I’m excited to see what this author does next.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through Edelweiss. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
