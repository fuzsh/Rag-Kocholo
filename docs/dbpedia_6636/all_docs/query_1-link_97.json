        "text": "Time to check in on the bunk! Now, bunk is not a word you hear often—bunk being short for bunkum. Bunkum means foolish claptrap and lemme tellya, our silly world of Los Angeles is all-fire replete with that.\n\nPlus, you know, bunk, Bunker Hill, it all ties together. Lately I’ve taken to task the bunk-ridden establishment narratives about Bunker Hill-related topics like Cooper Donuts, Chavez Ravine, and Pershing Square, and I thought it would be fun to “check in” on these subjects and see how the ruling class is conducting itself of late.\n\nWhy do I care? Some of you might say “well, you’re an old meanie, just trying to tear down the stories of marginalized people!” and of course the opposite is true. I’m all for the stories of marginalized people, but those stories have to be accurate. Inaccuracy makes me angry and offended in general, but particularly when it bleeds into Los Angeles history. Don’t believe me? I once played LA Noire for an hour and the next day wrote five thousand words about its inaccuracies. I saw Ask the Dust and nitpicked the living hell out of it. And those are fictional/fictionalized depictions—stuff like Coopers/Chavez/Pershing is the government and other unethical folk telling us “we now provide you the true version of actual historical events, which you know to be true because…we say so” when they are, knowingly or not (spoiler alert: knowingly) peddling blatant untruths.\n\nSo! Without further ado, let’s poke our noses into what’s new around town—\n\n***COOPER DONUTS***\n\nAs you are undoubtedly aware, it has been conclusively proven that there was never a Cooper Donuts riot (the only person who ever claimed an unverifiable kerfuffle even happened and/or was a witness to said event, stated it did not happen at a Cooper’s) AND it has been conclusively proven there was never a Cooper Donuts anywhere near the famed gay bars on the 500 block of Main Street (e.g., Harold’s at 555 South Main…and no, before you say “well it happened at Second and Main which is nearby and has to be true because Kevin de León put a plaque there” be advised that is, as well, false, because there was no Cooper Donuts anywhere near that corner in either the spring of 1958 or 1959, when said lone witness claimed the event occurred).\n\nAnd yet, these simple facts didn’t stop muralist Judy Baca, who depicted the myth on a mural at LACMA.\n\nIn her cynically dishonest artwork, Cooper’s—represented as sited adjacent Harold’s—was the location where trans POC battered LAPD with pink donuts. Let’s agree it’s a nice picture and is uplifting for the LGBTQ+ community, and isn’t that the point, stories that fill us with pride? In which case it’s no different from, say, a grand salon painting of Napoleon’s triumph at Waterloo. Let’s pretend for a moment that a monumental nineteenth-century canvas called Napoleon’s Triumph at Waterloo hangs in the Louvre, and that picture is a magnificent source of emotional and spiritual uplift for the citizens of France, I suppose, despite it being based on absolute horseshit. A French reverence for that painting wouldn’t make the French look strong and proud; it would make them look foolish.\n\nAny mention of Baca’s work will tell you she consulted historians and scholars, but of course I don’t have to tell you, painting a fanciful image of something that didn’t happen is the opposite of history. It’s ironic that what she is painting is assuredly not history, despite the mural’s official title being The History of California.\n\n***CHAVEZ RAVINE***\n\nThe reparations bill—made up mostly of nonsense, but at least it contains some half-truths—is working its way up the governmental ladder and (having been passed by the Senate Judiciary) is on its way to the Governor’s desk.\n\nBuried Under the Blue, who triumphantly exclaimed “we did it!” when the bill was announced, have since become really cranky about the bill, and critical of the bill’s author, Councilmember Wendy Carrillo. Apparently all BUtB really wanted to do is go after the Dodgers (guess they figure it’s better optics to go after the deep pockets of a corporation, than the deep pockets of taxpayers). But, to Carrillo’s credit, since the Dodgers had nothing to do with the depopulation of Chavez Ravine, Carrillo left them out of the bill. BUtB’s frothing hatred of the Dodgers being so pronounced, they have since, therefore, branded Carrillo a traitor to La Raza.\n\nIn other news, BUtB has recently posted a couple shots of an anomalous 1950s self-published newsletter that’s online at UCLA. BUtB again attempts some gaslighty slight-of-hand by putting a screengrab on social media and then claiming “look! This archival document PROVES all sorts of malicious Dodger forethought and diabolical political activity!” when, of course, a study of the actual material doesn’t bear that out at all. (BUtB has done this sort of thing before, like when they posted a shot of a letter and said “look! Here’s PROOF the Dodgers new about La Loma, Palo Verde and Bishop years before they came to Los Angeles and were working actively to destroy the communities!” when of course should you actually read the letter, it says nothing of the sort.)\n\nIn this case BUtB at last discovered the 14-page newsletter (in my day we’d have called it a ‘zine) online at UCLA, called the Torch Reporter, printed in September 1957. According to BUtB, it was put out by “residents and supporters.”\n\nTrue, it was put out by a supporter—a lone woman named Tara Joyce, who lived in Hollywood. The September ’57 Torch Reporter is full of Chavez Ravine (in the subsequent issue Joyce turned her attention to whether West Hollywood should incorporate as a municipality) and exists as a minor, but interesting, piece of Chavez curiosa: Joyce was all worked into a froth, especially, because she worried about oil. Yes, back in the day, the big question was who was getting the mineral rights? According to the Torch Reporter, there was never a plan to build public housing; that was all misdirection in the greater scheme to steal Chavez residents’ precious oil—which only residents of Chavez Ravine should be allowed to drill. Drill, baby, drill!\n\nIn any event, BUtB discovered the Torch Reporter online and said “this proves” City Hall and the Dodgers were at work to knowingly and specifically destroy La Loma, Palo Verde, and Bishop.\n\nSee the page above, with the “proof?” Yeahhhh, so, it actually talks about one of Mayor Poulson’s speeches and specifically says he doesn’t mention Chavez Ravine.\n\nBesides being largely about retaining mineral rights, Joyce’s Torch Reporter has all sorts of wild claims: for example, that 7,500 families were removed (um, nooooo). It claims the Church of Santo Niño, at 1034 Effie, was “built by the evicted families of Chavez Ravine” (it was built by the Diocese). And so forth. The first-person accounts by Glenn Walters and Alice Martin are exceptionally interesting and valuable, though. Read it all for yourself by clicking here.\n\n***PERSHING SQUARE***\n\nNot a lot going on with the renaming of Pershing Square; it’s still pending in committee (the Neighborhoods and Community Enrichment Committee, to be precise). I submitted a comment to the City Clerk, which you may read here, but it’s annoying that when one submits, their bot converts your message to a single paragraph. I’m not smart enough to figure out attaching PDFs, as Bob Wolfe did in his excellent “Communication from Public.” Therefore, here are my comments with the proper paragraph breaks:\n\nThe big news, though, about Biddy Mason Memorial Park, is that the water features have been restored—\n\n—as reported by Esotouric, here.\n\n************\n\nThose being the updates on that which falls under the “debunking Bunker” umbrella. One of these days I’ll tuck into some of the other juicy Los Angeles stories that so desperately need to be disproven…until then, then!\n\nIn the meantime, remember—\n\nWe all love great painters, especially those who depicted Los Angeles, right? And, subset of subset, specifically those who gravitated to Bunker Hill, depicting its picturesque charm.\n\nSome favorites: the enchanting Leo Politi and his watercolors of Bunker Hill (there are libraries and schools and public squares named after the man, not to mention this exhibit). Ben Abril is well-loved for his picturesque California scenes, often focusing on old Los Angeles and Bunker Hill in particular. Emil Kosa Jr. is one of the great California scene painters and remembered for having captured Bunker Hill on his canvases; same with Victor Czerkas. And of course Millard Sheets, titan of Southern California regionalist scene painting, is best known for his masterpiece Angel’s Flight, a noirish tour de force about Bunker Hill, which hangs at LACMA.\n\nAnd yet one of the greats is almost utterly unknown. Her name is Kay Martin—I love her, and you should too.\n\nI. The Early Years\n\nEva Katherine Whittenberg is born in Springfield, Illinois, July 14 1910, to Eva (née Rice) and Alonzo Lindolf Whittenberg. Eva Katherine is the youngest of six girls born to Eva and Alonzo; Alonzo is a government secretary to the state of Illinois there in Springfield.\n\nEva Katherine grows up, and she goes by Kay. So it’s 1931, she’s 21 years old, and living in Bloomington, about sixty miles north of her native Springfield, attending Illinois Wesleyan University. There she meets a nice young fellow named Lowell Beckwith Martin—he goes by Beck. Beck is in the insurance game (his father Lester is the president of the Great States Insurance Company). Beck and Kay get married in September of ’31, lovely affair at St. Mathews Episcopal.\n\nKay has developed as an artist; her artistic training includes the Illinois State Normal School, where she took crafts and design, and the aforementioned Illinois Wesleyan University, where she excelled in her fine arts studies, and dug deep into the history of art and design. Kay and Beck had been married a decade and change when in 1943 they lit out for California, Glendale specifically: Lowell becomes an insurance man for Forest Lawn. Kay becomes a student of the great California landscape artist Ralph Holmes, and a student of famed English transplant California landscapist Dorothy Baugh, and a student of the unbelievably important “King of the Eucalyptus School” Sam Hyde Harris.\n\nBut she didn’t go that way, artistically, with all that plein-air painting among the trees of the arroyo, no. Back when Kay was attending Bloomington’s Illinois Wesleyan she began to developer her own style as a staunch urbanist. She depicted day workers, and WPA scenes, but once in Los Angeles her interest in the urban landscape would take her, though, down a different road from the Social Realists. Her aim was to capture the vanishing built environment, and have fun doing it.\n\nII. The Productive Years\n\nKay’s living with Beck in Glendale, it’s 1955, and something catches her eye: Bunker Hill.\n\nThe vast swaths of Victorian buildings had been earmarked for demolition by the government and so, she set out for the Hill and began sketching. She would sketch and paint and sketch some more, and finish her paintings at home, and go back to the Hill and repeat the process. She became known as “The Vagabond of Bunker Hill.” The folks on the Hill came to know her well, and know her baby “Dreamboat,” the big white station wagon/rolling studio that came to visit the Hill near daily.\n\nHere’s a shot of Kay at work, March 1956:\n\nKay’s parked across from the Earlcliff Apartments, at 231 South Bunker Hill Avenue. True to Los Angeles, there’s a Canary Island Date palm, king of palms. There’s her car, the Dreamboat, a 1952 Ford Ranch Wagon. She’s chatting up a bunch of straight-out-of-central-casting 50s teens, with their rolled-up Levis and pomade-slathered ducktail hairdos. She’s working on a painting of the Brousseau mansion which was on the south side of the street at 238, that is, out of frame foreground right.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of Kay’s pictures.\n\nIII. Kay Martin: Exhibition, Reception, Awards, Etc.\n\nNow you’ve seen some of her great paintings. You might wonder, were they shown anywhere? Did anyone care? Short answer: they were quite popular. They were exhibited often, won scads of awards, and received dozens of press notices.\n\nKay Martin’s work was exhibited at the Greek Theater, the Ebell Club, the Tropico Branch Library, and the Casa Verdugo Library. She had shows at Panorama City’s Security First National Bank, and the Bank of America in La Canada, the Glendale Mutual Savings and Loan, and Security Pacific Bank-Prudential Square.\n\nHer most towering achievement was the show in the Tower Gallery atop City Hall. It ran from June 26-July 20 1956 and featured thirty-five oils. To have a one-man show in the Tower Galley was unprecedented; that this “one-man show” was the work of a woman was absolutely groundbreaking. The show was an enormous success, garnering nearly 8,000 visitors.\n\nKay Martin served as director of the Glendale Art Association, and was a bigwig in the Laguna Beach Art Association, California Art Club, Foothill Artists Group, Foothill Painters, and the group Women Painters of the West. She sat on the board of the Tuesday Afternoon Club. She lectured widely, to every art association in the southland, and spoke to a variety of civic groups and fraternal organizations about old Los Angeles.\n\nMartin won many local and three statewide awards.\n\nKay had some interesting notices in the newspapers. There’s an especially charming piece about Kay in the January 15, 1958 issue of the Los Angeles Mirror, titled “Artist Discovers Tolerance on L.A.’s ‘Edge of Yesterday'” in which she describes the way visiting Bunker Hill changed her core:\n\nHer fondness for old houses is mirrored in her proclivity toward playing dress-up, and reliving the bygone days:\n\nIV. Later Years\n\nWith City Council’s 1959 passage of the Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Project, the 1960s began with a new under-demolition Bunker Hill, one replete with the sounds of jackhammers and splintering wood, its air full of plaster dust. Kay Martin turned her attention elsewhere.\n\nIn early 1961, Martin reinvented stained glass:\n\nIn the autumn of 1962, Kay and her pal Helen Wilkes made a sketching tour through Europe; Kay sold her works at the Independent Gallery, 112 South Maryland Avenue.\n\nKay also turned her eye to Glendale. Here she is—\n\n—painting 221 North Belmont, the little white wooden home where Edith Nourse invited ten friends over for an 1898 birthday tea honoring Mittie Parker; so began the Tuesday Afternoon Club (which disbanded in 1998).\n\nAfter the early 1960s, there’s little about Kay and Beck. We do know that about 1964, they lost their home to Eminent Domain, ironic, since Kay’s beloved Bunker Hill went that way, too. Their house at 2084 Montecito Drive, in the Montecito Park section of Glendale, about halfway between Oakmont Country Club on the west and Descanso Gardens on the east, was lost when the 2 freeway cut through. Kay and Beck moved into a brand-new apartment complex down in the flats, at 420 North Louise, Apt# 25.\n\nThey were both in their mid-50s at this point, and presumably retired. Kay dies January 17 1978, and Beck follows the following August. While we’d expect them to be interred at Forest Lawn in their beloved Glendale, they both go back to Illinois.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the tale of Kay Martin.\n\nV: But What Happened to Her Pictures?\n\nAt this point, fellow Bunker wonk, you are suitably frustrated by these subpar reproductions of her paintings I have shared, and wish to immediately go view the originals wherever they hang, be it in a museum or private collection, and I would say yes you must, adding I will meet you there and docent the living hell out of your experience. But, that’s not going to happen. Not today, probably not for a very long time. There’s a story here:\n\nKay Martin exhibited her pictures and they received great accolades, but unlike 99% of artists, she didn’t sell them. She kept the entire collection intact, because she had a very special plan for it, a vision. It was her stated intention that the entire collection be returned to Bunker Hill, to be hung in one of the “grand new hotels” destined to be built atop the new, modernized, post-redevelopment world there. Her paintings could act as a teaching aid, instructing and reminding people as to what the old, Victorian, lost world of Bunker Hill looked like.\n\nKay passes in 1978 and her estate is willed to sister Marjorie Reed, who lives back in Illinois. Marjorie lives another 14 years and dies in 1992, so all the paintings go to her son William E. Reed. At which point Kay’s nephew William, and wife Angela Reed, say dang, our house is now totally filled with these paintings, we need to deal with this, and more importantly we need to fulfill Kay’s wishes.\n\nIn 1994 Mickey Gustin, the Arts Planner for the Community Redevelopment Agency, starts getting letters. Like this one, saying, we want to donate this huge art collection to the CRA. The CRA, the Reeds figured, were the ones who could fulfill Kay’s wishes and place the pictures all together in one of “the new super hotels.”\n\nThe CRA says, ok, we’ll take ’em, and they’re packed up and sent back to Los Angeles whence they came. The CRA, now in possession of the pictures, requires eleven years to figure out where to display them. Apparently someone was walking through Angelus Plaza—America’s largest federally subsidized retirement community, on Bunker Hill at Third & Olive—and says wow, this place has got a lotta empty walls. And this place chock full of, you know, old people who actually like things like paintings, and who might actually remember Bunker Hill. So in 2005 Kay Martin’s pictures finally go on display up on the walls of Bunker Hill, at long last, in accordance with Kay’s wishes.\n\nAt this point, everything is copacetic: Kay’s pictures have been returned to Bunker Hill, and the old folks get to look at them wistfully, and those of us with a passion for old Bunker Hill get to visit and tour them:\n\nUntil…one day in 2014. Story goes, someone at Angelus Plaza says let’s paint the walls. AP workers take down all the pictures, paint the walls, and then realize they have to rehang the pictues…which is just more work, so you can see the problem right there. Angelus Plaza figures it’s easier just to get rid of the damn things. They call up William Estrada, in the California History Department at the Natural History Museum and say you want em? and Dr. Estrada says hey, free stuff, why not. That’s the way I heard it, anyway; I’m sure the reality is much more nuanced, certainly more complicated, or perhaps completely different.\n\nIn any event, lawyers draw up a deed of gift that irrevocably and unconditionally assigns and transfers all legal title to the paintings from Angelus Plaza to the Natural History Museum. In January 2015 a couple of guys from LA Packing at $135 an hour show up, pack the stuff, haul it off to the Natural History warehouse in Carson.\n\nFour years go by, and I’m working on my Bunker Hill book, so throughout 2019 I would on occasion attempt to contact William Estrada, Chief Curator and Chair of the History Department, about getting an image of one of the Kay Martin pictures. I never hear from him, which is disappointing, since I’d helped Bill when NHM was restoring their 1940 WPA model of downtown, but, whatever. So in January 2020 I turn my attention to collections manager Beth Werling. We discuss getting one of the paintings shot—they hadn’t even been photographed for in-house documentation purposes—for my book. But it doesn’t happen (hence, for the book, I used one of my black-and-white images alongside color pics of Sheets and Politi). NHM’s inability to photograph a painting was due to their losing the lease on their offsite warehouse in Carson, after which the entirety of NHM’s 3D/Material Culture collections was carted off to a new warehouse in Vernon, where all remains unpacked to this day, as the warehouse slogs through the process of upgrades, and the resulting City inspections.\n\nAnd that’s that: ten years in, and the Natural History Museum has yet to so much as uncrate the paintings for cataloging. In the preparation of this post, curatorial questions regarding their future were again directed to Bill Estrada, who again, remains disinterested in speaking on the subject.\n\nI hope however I have whet your appetite for Kay Martin and her works, and will, with me, look forward to some forthcoming exhibition.\n\n*********\n\nWhile I have you here: though there’s scant chance you’ll see Kay Martin’s paintings any time soon, I can at least share with you some of Kay’s sketches from my personal collection. Most of the work in my Kay Martin archive is from her 1962 European trip, but I do have a few nice Los Angeles examples:\n\n*********\n\nOne last thing. April 11, 1958: at the Glendale Art Association’s “April Antics” held in the Tuesday Afternoon Clubhouse, Kay sang a ditty called Bunker Hill Blues. Here’s a shot of her performing it, with Association president James Alden Barber at the piano.\n\nI’ve no idea what the music was. Judging by her garb it had a certain Gay Nineties jauntiness to it. Barber was composer, and I have his typewritten lyrics; the takeaway is neither gay nor jaunty, rather, I find the lyrics quite dark. I’m loath to call them mere lyrics—this is poetry, more to the point, the greatest poem ever written.\n\nAnd so, I leave you with…the Bunker Hill Blues.\n\nToday we talk about Pershing Square. Perhaps it’s not Bunker Hill proper—bordering the Hill’s southern edge—but I consider it an essential part of the Hill story. It is, after all, where so many of the Hill’s elderly residents spent their days (for example, go to 11:11 in the great 1956 documentary about Bunker Hill to witness a Pershing Square chat between an old fellow and William S. Burroughs’ doppelgänger). We’re also going to talk about Biddy Mason, who has a Bunker Hill connection: she owned the land on which African Methodist Episcopal had its church, at Fourth and Charity (now Grand, site of the Wells Fargo tower). She wouldn’t let the parishioners meet there, because the faithful owed her back taxes!\n\nSo, I deal today with Pershing Square and Biddy Mason, because there is a motion before Council to rename Pershing Square to Biddy Mason Park.\n\nBiddy Mason is, unquestionably, a fantastic and important part of LA, but the present narrative raises eyebrows. First of all, it comes from Kevin de León. It was de León’s office that pushed through the counterfactual Cooper Donut embarrassment, so, anything from that office involving “history” should be doubly scrutinized.\n\nRight off the bat, in yesterday’s Council motion de León’s sole mention of Pershing is an absolute and ridiculous falsehood, stating “well, maybe Biddy Mason went to the park, but we know for a fact that Pershing certainly never did, because he never visited Los Angeles even once!”—\n\nFor the love of God, Kevin de León, if you’re going to LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING, at least do it WELL. Seriously, attempt some semblance of veracity.\n\nFor the record: Pershing spent a LOT of time in Los Angeles: during World War One he commanded the headquarters of the Coast Artillery, AND delivered addresses to the Red Cross, AND Pershing was forever cavorting with his L.A. pal George S. Patton, Jr. while romancing George’s sister Anne at the Patton home in San Marino…which is where Pershing and Anne got engaged. Pershing was also pals with important old Los Angeles families like the Wilsons and the Workmans.\n\nTHEN in January 1920, when Pershing personally dedicated the square named in his honor, 50,000 people—1/10th of the entire city—came to see him speak.\n\nCome 1923 Pershing was back in Los Angeles, and two thousand people packed the Ambassador to hear him speak, and he planted a redwood at the War Memorial Building that stands mightily to this day:\n\n***************\n\nPershing is of course titanically important, and we’ll end this post with a bit more on him. But now, let’s grapple with de León’s need to have the park renamed.\n\nOne might contend that de León is only attempting the Biddy Mason rename because he got caught being a racist. He famously laughed along with casual racism (City Council president calling a Black child a monkey), and denigrated Black children as mere “props” like “handbags” (statements so egregious even Biden himself told de León to resign, a command de León simply ignored), and went on to say that the problem with Blacks is that when 25 of them yell, they sound like 250. No surprise, then, de León proffers some performative activism during his reelection campaign.\n\nIt’s important, therefore, to look critically at the claims being made about why we need a Biddy Mason park:\n\nWe need a Biddy Mason park!\n\nWe already have a Biddy Mason park. Granted, it’s not five acres like Pershing Square, however, it’s still important to point out we’ve had a permanent tribute to Biddy Mason in Los Angeles for the last 35 years.\n\nBut the Biddy Mason park we have is terrible!\n\nNo, it’s really, really not. I work downtown and know every inch of that part of the world, and Biddy Mason Park is one of the few truly pleasant places in the central city. It’s away from the madness, it’s quiet, the birds chirp in the trees.\n\nIn the video above, shot in Pershing Square during the Juneteenth press conference, de León says “I do recall, the day, a few years ago, we were walking there, and I did actually ask you, wha-whe where are we going? And you said (unintelligible) and I said I know, but, we’re going to a parking lot right now. That’s where it is. A parking lot right now. It’s dark over there. You can not see the plaque on the wall, the memorial wall.”\n\nRemember above, where I said if you’re going to just lie, be better at it? Because this is just some dumb-ass lyin’. Here’s a video I shot walking to the “dark, unseeable” Biddy Mason Memorial in “the parking lot” that is Biddy Mason Park:\n\nThere are five major entrances to the park, from Fourth, Spring, Third, and Broadway. If we’re going to be extremely charitable, de León, in stating he went to a “dark parking lot” is perhaps attempting to refer to the Spring Street entrance, which goes through a parking structure, via a pedestrian mall.\n\nOk fine we have a nice park in her honor, but still, Biddy Mason is unknown and unsung!\n\nLet’s examine the claim that Biddy Mason is overlooked, unknown, and unsung.\n\nReally, though? Has her legacy been overlooked?\n\nFirst of all, LAUSD teaches Biddy Mason as part of its curriculum. LAUSD developed Biddy Mason teaching with Stanford University spinoff Digital Inquiry Group, as part of LAUSD’s K-12 Lessons on African American History in Los Angeles series.\n\nBiddy Mason is part of the National Register. A simple Google search yields 75,000+ results. There’s no lack of books on the subject (including The Power of Place, by the always-thoughtful Dolores Hayden, author of this article in California History). And so forth.\n\nBiddy Mason is an American hero; so is John J. Pershing. So I thought I’d do a quick (admittedly unscientific) comparison as to who’s actually more “unsung.” I went into the newspapers.com newspaper archive, to see how many times our southland newspapers mentioned Biddy Mason or General Pershing, since 1990. Turns out, in the last 34 years you’re more likely to read about Biddy Mason, than General Pershing. I even used multiple variations of ways Pershing might be mentioned, just to make certain I got them all. Still, Biddy beat John, 228 to 207 (I should mention as well, that because I used multiple variations of Pershing to cover all potential bases, the tally also therefore included repeats of single articles that referred to Pershing in multiple ways; the number of unique Pershing-mentioning articles is actually closer 125, revealing that Biddy Mason is mentioned more generally than Pershing by nearly 2-to-1).\n\nSo that’s it in a nutshell. Maybe Biddy Mason deserves more recognition, but at the expense of General Pershing? Can we not put a statue of her in Pershing Square?\n\nAnd did I mention Kevin de León is not only going to rename Pershing Square, but also rename Spring Street? Yes, besides now having two parks named after Biddy Mason, we’ll also have 1.6 miles of Spring Street renamed to Biddy Mason Way. This includes the Spring Street Financial District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Pretty fitting, since Mason’s major claim to fame after achieving her freedom was becoming rich by being a capitalist landlord. (Hey, I thought we weren’t supposed to like capitalist landlords!)\n\n************\n\nI will leave you with someone else’s words—Courtland Jindra, historian of the Great War—who can speak to Pershing’s importance better than I, and did so in a letter recently submitted to the editor of the Times, which said:\n\nOn June 19th, 2024 at Pershing Square, City Councilman Kevin de León announced his intention to push for the renaming of Pershing Square. I find this an unfortunate, but sadly expected, event in this city often accused of throwing out its history.\n\nOn the morning of November 15th, 1918 the City Council of Los Angeles renamed Central Square to Pershing Square, after the overall commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, John J, Pershing. He was the hero who had led the “boys” that had tipped the balance of the World War to the Allies and was nearly canonized at the time. Talk of renaming several things after him was also discussed, but what stuck was the park. The LA Times recorded that at the same meeting, a committee was formed to place a monument in the park “in honor of Gen Pershing and the American soldiers and sailors who participated in the war.”\n\nThis piece of history, like many others regarding the Square, has been largely forgotten. Even the park’s own website does not mention the date of the rededication, only that it was in 1918 – one has to track it down in archives. For many years, before and after the new name, Pershing Square was a place of historical reflection – especially for the military. A memorial to those lost in the 7th California Infantry, today’s 160th Infantry Regiment, in the Spanish American War, what is widely considered to be the first piece of public art in the city, was erected there in 1900. The previous Thanksgiving, a captured cannon from the same conflict was set in the park (this gun unfortunately was removed during the 1950’s redesign and has yet to be returned – today it resides in the Maritime Museum of San Pedro). Another cannon that had briefly been on the USS Constitution was brought to the city in the 1930s and resides in Pershing Square.\n\nThe park also served as places for two large outdoor funeral services for fallen soldiers from the war. Morris Lynchick’s 1921 ceremonial rites stopped the city in its tracks. He was the first soldier buried in Los Angeles and all the stops were pulled out as Lynchick seemed to symbolize all the men from the city who died in the war. Thousands came to bow their heads and pay their respects. A couple of years later the son of the former Mayor was likewise venerated. Ross Snyder was a decorated officer who gave his life in July of 1918 in an action that earned him the Silver Star. Again, the city honored him with a huge martial display in Pershing Square. Snyder is still remembered by a park bearing his name in South Los Angeles.\n\nThe World War memorial discussed back in 1918 did eventually come to fruition. There were tens of thousands of Angelenos that served in the First World War with over 400 perishing in the conflict and its pandemic fueled aftermath. Humberto Pedretti’s Doughboy, which will mark its centennial on the 4th of July this year, pays tribute to them. Its dedication was a massive deal and it is still, arguably, the most impressive element in the park. One might contend this is as it should be given its WWI connection. Doughboy towers roughly 25 feet from its base to the top of the flag that he strides to battle with. It’s a heroic depiction that seeks to evoke respect. The sides of the pedestal all have inscriptions that add to the effect. Dedicated “To the Sons and Daughters of Los Angeles who Participated in the World War” it has fallen into some disrepair in the time since it was put up, but when one stands in front of it, it does not fail to move you. Certainly, the Councilman could use some city funds to help restore this piece to its former glory.\n\nIt’s no surprise that given the large number of military tributes at Pershing Square, that during WWII, it was the city mecca for rallies, recruitment, and liberty bond drives. What is most interesting and depressing to me, as an amateur historian, is how all of this has been forgotten. Up until the latest design of the park, which we must remember is so disliked they’ve been working on redoing for at least a decade at this point, the war monuments and other memorial features (like Beethoven) all had prime real estate in the park. They were sprinkled around at entrances or centered. In other words, you couldn’t miss them. There were even large-scale Memorial Day services at the 7th California Infantry monument for decades at the Square, and at least a couple of pictures I’ve found indicate events at Doughboy on the 4th of July as well. Now the monuments and plaques are all ignored and largely hidden with low visibility. And now, with this proposed name change they’re certainly about to be even more forgotten.\n\nAgain on a Thanksgiving Day in 1970, Pershing Square took center stage to bring attention to the military. The park was specifically chosen to draw attention to Prisoners of War from the conflict in Vietnam. Thousands gathered around a bamboo cage in the center of the park. Inside, sat a bearded, ragged man, his ankles were shackled to the floor. He used chopsticks to slurp a sad holiday supper of pig fat, soupy rice and pumpkin. The ‘stunt’ garnered nationwide press at the time.\n\nEven though other memorials to The Great War exist in this city, Pershing Square was the first. I understand that the park is not going to be 5 acres of history lessons, but to simply ignore this history because a City Councilman is trying to launder his name after the scandal from a couple of years ago is predictable but kind of unfortunate. Biddy Mason was a legendary figure in the early pioneer days as this former slave traveled west and built a life in the fledgling African American Community. However, as worthy of plaudits as she is, Mason already has a park named after her. Black Jack Pershing (who actually received his sobriquet from commanding Black troops in his early years as an officer) is not just the name of some city founder type, that people typically shrug off at localities all across the country. There was a reason that city officials renamed the park in the first place. It was to honor a man, and the amazing individuals under his command, that helped turn the tide of the largest struggle of history.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\nJindra’s letter to the editor was published today, in an abbreviated form:\n\nThere were as well two other letters to the editor.\n\nA woman named Ellen Switkes contends that renaming the park for Mason is not enough—for example, LAUSD should teach the story (except, as I’ve shown above, Mason is already part of the LAUSD curriculum) and there should be a “major biographical film” about Mason (this ignores the fact that biopics are frequently terrible [Blonde, All Eyez on Me, Gotti, Wired, Stardust, Beyond the Sea, ad nauseam] so be careful what you wish for; moreover, just because Mason gets a biopic doesn’t mean anyone will actually see it [the recent Till would have a similar audience, and despite good reviews, was ignored by audiences, failing to recoup most of its budget]).\n\nThe other letter, from Bob Wolfe (who, last June, aided me in unraveling and understanding the intricacies of overturning historic “masquerading” ordinances) correctly asserts we should be more thankful for and attentive to our existing Biddy Mason Park, and then posits a fascinating premise: we should rename Pershing Square for Cristóbal Aguilar.\n\nThe story so far: we introduced our subject in Part I by detailing how Chavez Ravine’s Master Narrative, from which came the Reparations Bill, is equal parts unsupportable claims and outlandish disinformation. Part II made sure you knew Chavez Ravine’s history. Part III provided a snapshot of life in Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop during the 1940s, before it was forever changed. Part IV ran us through the story of the ill-fated Elysian Park Heights project, for which the Housing Authority removed all the residents and demolished the structures. Part V told the tale of how and why the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Part VI detailed that First Family of Chavez Ravine, the Arechiga clan, in all their complexity.\n\nToday! We wrap up our seven-part series with a few more odds & ends that didn’t make it into the previous posts, serving to underscore that everything you hear about Chavez Ravine is tainted by agendas and incompetence, so, take it with a grain of salt. With that in mind, we review a few of the key takeaways from our study here.\n\n*********\n\nWhat’s at issue with Chavez Ravine is that just about everything you hear, or read, is wrong.\n\nJust to hammer home that point, here are a couple more tidbits that I couldn’t fit in to the preceding six posts.\n\nTidbit 1: No, no part of To Kill a Mockingbird was filmed in Chavez Ravine\n\nThe book was published in July 1960, when Dodger Stadium was already under heavy construction, so, no. Then people will backpedal and say “well, houses from Chavez Ravine were moved to the Universal Studios lot for the movie!” Again, impossible: TKaM production began in the spring of 1962, so, houses would have had to have been moved three years previous, in 1959, when a handful of houses still existed.\n\nMoreover, Mockingbird’s art director Henry Bumstead was quite clear when he stated that while the studio did purchase some old condemned houses for scenery, those structures were sourced in 1962 from areas in the path of freeway construction, not Chavez Ravine.\n\nHOWEVER! Wanna know about a movie that was filmed in Chavez Ravine? The incredible Robot Monster! The literal Greatest Movie Ever Made, famously filmed in Tru-Stereo 3-D!\n\nTake a look at the Call Sheet—\n\n—which is attached to George Nader’s personal annotated copy of the script, that you may see for yourself on display at the 3-D SPACE museum in Echo Park!\n\nAs you can see, the crew met up at the Formosa on March 19 & 20, 1953, and then lit out for the corner of Effie & Bishop. Why? Because they needed a post-apocalyptic landscape!\n\nNow, more often than not, when people talk about Robot Monster’s shooting locations, they’ll mention the famous Bronson Canyon caves:\n\nHowever, most of the picture is shot in the springtime fields of Chavez Ravine, looks to be just above Effie, on the La Loma side of Bishop. What I obviously need to do is sit down with every known image of Chavez Ravine and try and pinpoint these structures:\n\nOf course, you may watch Robot Monster streaming online if you poke around for it, but might I suggest you actually watch it in 3-D? Get it here! Or better yet, see it (and Chavez Ravine) a month from now on the big screen, in 3-D, in Los Feliz!\n\n(I am deeply indebted to Eric Kurland, CEO and President of 3-D SPACE, for sharing with me the Chavez Ravine/Robot Monster connection)\n\nTidbit 2: No, Christine Sterling was not evicted from Chavez Ravine\n\nBecause anything Chavez Ravine touches turns to lies, we have this whole story about how Christine Sterling was one of the removed. You see this repeated in her Wiki page:\n\nAs we know, all residents had left by 1959 and the totality of residents they “began evicting” that May numbered about ten. (Of course “but there’s a footnote! It must be true!” and, like all Wikipedia footnotes, the article it links to doesn’t make any mention whatsoever of this nonsense.)\n\nThough little remembered today, Christine Sterling was a huge presence in Los Angeles. Consider: while she’s now remembered (if at all) for something she did in 1930—the year of the opening of her pet project, Olvera Street—after the 1930s, she still made it into the newspapers over 400 times. If a public figure like Sterling had been ejected for redevelopment, that would have been a major story.\n\nOf course, everyone loves to repeat this patently fictional tale, e.g. PBS, KCRW, the LA Weekly, et al.\n\nNow, no surprise that Wikipedia is rife, as it generally is, with nonsense, but one would expect PBS or KCRW or maybe the Weekly to do even the bare minimum of fact-checking, which believe it or not used to be a “thing” in journalism.\n\nFive minutes looking into the story would have told them: Sterling lived for a short time at 935 Chavez Ravine Road, until the early 1940s, when Sterling, now in her sixties, then moved in with her daughter June Park. (Née Rix: June was married to John Park, an engineer; June’s maiden name was Rix; Christine Sterling’s birth surname was Rix.) John and June Park owned a home at 916 Chavez Ravine Road. Chavez Ravine Road was far to the south of the action, away from the neighborhoods of La Loma, Palo Verde and Bishop, etc. Incidentally, her daughter’s house, the other side of the Naval Armory, was lost not to the Elysian Park Heights project, but to Pasadena Freeway construction.\n\nLet’s look at the phone books from 1951 and 1955:\n\nEarly 1950s, Christine Sterling is dividing her time between the Avila Adobe and her daughter’s house by the Naval Armory; by the mid-50s Sterling is now domiciled wholly on Olvera Street. Even the newspapers mention, in the mid-50s, that Sterling had moved onto Olvera Street and into the Avila Adobe:\n\nTidbit 3: No, there was never a school buried in Chavez Ravine\n\nThe story concerns Palo Verde elementary, built in 1925, at Effie and Paducah (A structure I discussed a bit back in Part II).\n\nAnd because they were moving so much earth to build Dodger Stadium, they just tore the roof off the school and filled it with dirt, and “in a thousand years somebody’s gonna start digging, and they’re gonna find a school down there.”\n\nNo. What’s important to understand is that the stadium and the school co-existed for nearly a decade; Dodger Corp. used the school for storage until about 1970. Here’s a shot from 1962 next to one from 1972:\n\nSee the red arrows? That’s the site of the school. Note that there’s nowhere for dirt to come from, to bury the school. More importantly and most obviously, the topographic level at which the school once sat is the same. It was the same when built in 1925, and it remains the same now. Ergo, it was not buried. It was demolished. (The idea that the civil engineers at LADBS would allow anyone to backfill a structure like this is ludicrous.)\n\nNote how next to the school, to its east, there is a hill (which had Davis Street running atop it). That hill is still there. Still in its same height and configuration and topography. It still has the flat land next to it where the school was built in 1925. ‘Nuff said.\n\nInterestingly, Buried Under the Blue literally named themselves after this fiction:\n\n(Big thank you to researcher Malcolm Gafton, who was the first to debunk this myth.)\n\nTidbit 4: No, the Queen of Elysian Heights house doesn’t have a relationship to Chavez Ravine\n\nI touched on this in Part VI, but, it bears fleshing out a bit, since the topic has made recent news.\n\nThere is a house in Echo Park, which was made a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (courtesy Paul Bowers, of the Silver Lake Heritage Trust, using Charles J. Fisher as monument application author). It is a classic Queen Anne, built about 1888, at the corner of Echo Park and Ewing. It’s a great house: I love the gable with the shingle-clad pediment, the clapboard siding, the two-story bay, decorative brackets, the multi-light fixed transom windows, and that eight-light porthole window just slays me. Needless to say, I am thrilled it has become an HCM.\n\nThe house made the news recently, as there was concern about evicting an elderly renter, who had moved there in 1963. I won’t comment on the legality of new owner NELA Homes removing the renter, which is outside the scope of this post. Rather, let’s examine the claim that the house is where the all the Arechigas fled after the May 08 1959 demolition of the Malvina houses.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m all for Lupe staying in place, and I’m glad she got some money. But, let’s look at some of the reasons people gave her money: contrary to what you were told, Lupe didn’t designate the house; the designation began back in 2020, and was the work of the Silver Lake Heritage Trust. And no, nothing was ever under threat of demolition. And, to *our* Chavez-related point, the Arechigas (to be accurate, the only family to be publicly and violently evicted, not the “last” family), contrary to what you have been told one million times, didn’t live there.\n\nOkay, one Arechiga, who didn’t live in Chavez Ravine, owned the house for five years. And again, no, no-one who had a Chavez Ravine house destroyed, or lived in a Chavez Ravine tent, ever lived there. And yet here’s a typical response after the November 9, 2022 designation of the house as HCM #1272:\n\nThis is an extremely odd statement, since the tract it’s on was laid out by a Scot named Maltman, and the long list of the house’s owners (names like Garfield, Murray, Champion, Wood, Runyon, etc.) reads like a “who’s who” of “Let’s Be Anglos.” It’s a victory for Mexican Los Angeles because, why? It had one Hispanic owner for five years? (Who then sold it to another Anglo named Eubanks.) No, we’re told it’s a victory because the fabled Chavez Arechigas fled there.\n\nBut that’s not true. Here’s what actually happened:\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1950s, when time grew short for the Arechigas in Palo Verde (e.g., the eviction of August 1957), Juan was already elsewhere. Juan and Nellie lived in his house at 2651 Benedict Street, which he purchased in the spring of 1955 for $10,250 (he’s in the phone books at that address through the rest of the 1950s).\n\nJuan purchased the house at 1553 West Ewing Street in March 1959. When his parents’ Chavez house was demolished, Manuel and Abrana moved in to the house they owned on Ramboz. His sister Victoria moved into her house on Allison, and Aurora was already living in her house on Simmons. Then, Juan sells the place in March 1964.\n\nWhen Lupe Breard talks about how she “lived alongside the Arechiga family” remember this, she moved in there when she was two years old, in 1963; and the Arechigas there—Juan, Nellie, Helen and Jeannie, who were absolutely and positively not displaced from Chavez Ravine—were the ones with whom Lupe, aged 2, lived with for only a few months, before the Arechigas sold the place and left.\n\nHere’s Buried Under the Blue demanding the historical name of the house be changed to “The Arechiga Home” for no other reason than…one Arechiga, who lived two miles away from Chavez Ravine, bought and owned the place for five years, 65 years ago…moreover, indisputably, no-one removed from Palo Verde, La Loma or Bishop ever lived there…well, that seems like a reasonable reason to use their favorite phrase “we demand“:\n\nSo, having run through a few odds & ends, let’s recap!\n\n**********\n\nThe Top Dozen Dumb Myths about Chavez Ravine\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nRemoving the people from Chavez Ravine was a racist act.\n\nThe only logic or reasoning behind this assertion being “because everything was racist in the past, what happened must have been racist!” However: The Health Department chose Chavez Ravine as a redevelopment site involving metrics that existed outside of ideology (e.g., the American Public Health Association’s rubric regarding blighted neighborhoods vis-à-vis lack of toilets, high disease rates, public dumping, makeshift structures, streets inadequate and grades too steep for emergency vehicles, etc.); their intention was to better the living conditions of the poor.\n\nThen the Housing Authority went through depopulating Chavez Ravine based on slum-clearance ideology, but consider, that organization was replete with Jews and Communists (Wilkinson, Jack Naiditch, Frances Eisenberg, etc.; Sidney Green, who signed the infamous 1950 “Wilkinson Letter,” was among the group of Communists dismissed from the CHA in the fall of 1952). Jews and Communists spent their time writing for the People’s World, fighting for civil rights, and working to secure a just and equitable society for all peoples. Those are the racists you’re talking about.\n\nThe other player besides the health and housing departments was the mayor. Fletcher Bowron was a liberal pro-housing mayor, and although the left’s paternalistic, patronizing anti-poverty policies via social welfare legislation can arguably be deemed racist, it’s hardly the rabid White Supremacy critics describe it as.\n\nThe handful of Chavez Ravine residents who were actually evicted, were evicted illegally.\n\nNot only was the process legal, it had been hashed out by the courts endlessly. It was the same kind of eviction that had been done—legally—hundreds if not thousands of times in Los Angeles. There are lots of reasons not to like it, but, just calling it illegal doesn’t magically make it so.\n\nThe Arechigas were evicted on Mother’s Day.\n\nNo, they were evicted on a Friday, and Mother’s Day was on Sunday. “Well, then, it’s just mean they were evicted on Mother’s Day weekend.” That is true, but note: The Arechigas were duly notified, on March 11, they had 30 days until eviction, and that said eviction was scheduled for April 10. It was the Arechiga lawyer who got the April 10 eviction delayed another 30 days, thus, it was the Arechigas who made the whole thing go down on Mother’s Day weekend.\n\nDodger Stadium is on top of the communities of Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop/the communities of PV, LL and B are buried beneath Dodger Stadium.\n\nThe stadium, specifically, is on land that had had a brick factory. If you’re referring to one of the parking lots, though, the stadium’s parking lot to the north is on land that had had those neighborhoods (and again, the neighborhoods were demolished years before the parking lot was even a gleam in someone’s eye, ergo, nothing is “buried”).\n\nThe Dodgers owe something to the descendants.\n\nThey do not. The City of Los Angeles had one job: deliver an empty plot of land. The city, being the city, in the grand tradition of bureaucracies, of course did a poor job of this. Then the city had to play mop-up at the 11th hour. The Dodger corporation was in no way involved in removing people who had lost their homes years before (yes, that includes the Arechigas).\n\nWe are told we must “hold the Dodgers accountable for their part in destroying Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop!” But no…we don’t. Because DodgerCorp. were not “complicit” with the city in destroying one single house. If they were, then, when and how? Exactly: didn’t happen.\n\nPeople in Chavez Ravine had to flee, and scramble to find housing, but it was impossible to go anywhere else, because of redlining.\n\nWhat is redlining? As part of Roosevelt’s New Deal, the government began something called the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The HOLC produced color-coded “Residential Security” maps that gauged areas where they could or should refinance existing loans. The ones coded “red” were deemed high-risk (“hazardous”); and yellow indicated “declining areas.” Any Mexican-American was more than welcome in either area. Now let’s look at one of their maps:\n\nThe area inside the black square, that’s Chavez Ravine. And what do you notice? The entire surrounding area is by and large red or yellow. It’s hard to believe that the residents of the sparsely populated Ravine area couldn’t find a house in Los Angeles, which was mostly red and yellow. (The white areas were parks, industrial, business, and areas that had mostly apartments. Remember, despite the prevailing narrative, most of Chavez Ravine’s residents were renters. They would have gone to any the majority areas.) Note that, for example, nearby Bunker Hill (majority Caucasian) is redlined. Most people believe that redlining was done largely or primarily on the basis of race, which is untrue: the vast majority of US citizens “redlined” were white.\n\nAnd remember, HOLC went out of business in 1951, so, these maps would not have applied to the people of Chavez Ravine.\n\n“But the HOLC shared their maps with private banks!” No, that was a wishful claim made years ago that has been debunked. “But the HOLC shared their maps with the Federal Housing Administration!” Maybe, but the FHA had their own maps (which they did on a block-by-block basis, and guess what, they burned all their maps in 1969 when a lawsuit came after them), but yes, the New Deal feds at the FHA and their hateful-of-Blacks Fannie Mae lapdogs were super racist, no doubt. “But okay even though the HOLC maps had nothing to do with mortgage refinance after the eminent domain in Chavez Ravine, it still made things really bad for Chavez Ravine in the 1940s!” Actually, evidence shows the HOLC did in fact loan heavily in red-shaded areas.\n\nOh, and I shouldn’t have to remind you, but no one had to flee or scramble, since in Chavez Ravine there was (in accordance with the law) an office to assist in finding people new homes, be they rental or purchase. The lady who ran the office was Vicki Alonzo.\n\nPeople kicked out of Chavez Ravine had nowhere to go, because it was illegal for Mexican-Americans to own houses.\n\nBUtB repeats this one a lot, but no-one ever indicates what that law was. Because it didn’t exist. (In fact, it’s especially funny the Arechiga family say it was illegal for Mexican-Americans to own houses, when they owned 11 houses…13, if you count the two in Chavez Ravine.)\n\nIt was difficult for Chavez residents to find housing, because of restrictive covenants, whereby most areas of Los Angeles were where POC weren’t allowed to buy houses.\n\nSome residents of Chavez Ravine may have moved to Chavez Ravine because there was a covenant against their purchasing a house in, say, Brentwood. But, restrictive covenants were de facto done away with in Los Angeles in 1945, and declared Federally unlawful in 1948. Ergo, the people of Chavez Ravine displaced in 1950-1953 would have had no problem with them.\n\nMoreover, most of Los Angeles’s restrictive covenants, written into subdivision title deed language ca. 1903, had expired by the 1940s. You know what I’ve never seen? A map of these restrictive covenants. Try and Google it—you’ll get a lot of pictures of the infamous HOLC “redlining” maps, but, no: maps that evaluate mortgage lending risk are not the same thing as the exclusionary language of a title covenant.\n\nChavez Ravine was home to generations of families.\n\nMost moved there in there in the mid-20s, and were gone by early 50s. On average, 25 years. Which is one generation.\n\nResidents didn’t get compensation/got below-market compensation.\n\nExcept, they were compensated at or above market rate. Each property had multiple appraisals, and the court awarded the highest appraisal, in accordance with the law.\n\nResidents were forced to sell cheap, because the city caused a panic through a tiered buying system.\n\nSome say this fiction was concocted by Mike Davis, but there’s no evidence of that. There’s actually no evidence the “tiered buying system” happened at all in any way shape or form: if such a flagrant violation of law were to happen during the very publicized and public workings of a highly-scrutinized public agency, it would have left a mark. Had there been unhappy homeowners because such a thing happened, it would have left a mark. There was an entire month-long investigation of LA public housing by a House of Representatives Subcommittee, in hearings that lasted through May of 1953, where residents aired their grievances in no uncertain terms, up to and including every last thing they didn’t like about how they were treated by the Housing Authority, and not a single person mentioned this? Copious interviews with residents, in the 1950s and beyond (with anger directed at length in, say, the 1957 issue of The Torch Reporter) and it was never mentioned? The Los Angeles Housing Authority were accepting Federal money, and as such were under Federal oversight; HACLA were, moreover, bound by the strictures of the Court, who directed and oversaw appraisals and payments; and as a public local agency were, again, under scrutiny, and yet we’re to believe HACLA went totally rogue, running roughshod over laws, to create community panic because…why? To save money? (Yeah, those government agencies given absurd amounts of other people’s money to play with suddenly becoming prudent and frugal…that’s a first.) HACLA was going to get all the property through eminent domain, as they had countless times before in the very commonplace and workaday performance of their tasks; why would they suddenly turn full-eeevil in this one particular case?\n\nChavez Ravine = Palestine.\n\nNo. Equating the two reveals a jejune understanding of both Los Angeles and the Middle East.\n\n**********\n\nAs long as we’re on the subject of picking apart what people have said about Chavez Ravine…the Los Angeles Times published this opinion piece a couple weeks ago.\n\nI’ll run through some of its contentions, quickly: people lived in Chavez Ravine because they legally weren’t allowed to live anywhere else (absolutely untrue); Frank Wilkinson came up with the Elysian Heights project (not by a long shot—he was the Director of HACLA’s Office of Information); the city offered people below-market monies for their homes (a debunked lie); the unjust treatment of the residents is a blight on LA history (were the residents treated more unjustly than other residents removed for projects? No, so how is CR in particular a blight?); the property was unjustly taken (though the process was in the courts for years…I’m going to need a breakdown of the judges’ decisions detailing exactly how they made purposely unjust decisions from the bench); taking of homes resulted an inability to build wealth (it can be argued the opposite is true: the people, compensated for their homes, bought homes elsewhere, which were in an area that had actual city services, and would therefore be worth much more today than the CR homes could ever have achieved); “some got nothing” (um, source?); the CR project was racist because the substandard neighborhood happened to have Mexican-Americans living in it (see my paragraph on CR and racism, above); the baseball stadium is not a “public good” (though it was deemed by the courts to be); the Dodgers should “give back” to the residents who were removed 73 years ago (the Times doesn’t say what they should be giving to these people, of course…they also neglect to mention that it was five years between the cancellation of the public housing project, and the Dodgers being offered the land).\n\nPoint being, the Times editorializes, based on a whole host of “alternative facts.” I decided to write about Chavez Ravine after I read the Reparations Bill (everything is racist! there was below-market compensation! the Dodgers got the land for an insignificant amount! schools were buried! it was all fraudulent! and we use terms like redlining without knowing what redlining is!) because it contained a plethora of similar falsehoods and delusions. So, I hope you have found these seven posts edifying, as I have attempted in them to correct the record.\n\n********\n\nNow then, I will reiterate what I said in Part I: Hey, City of Los Angeles!\n\nHire me as part of the task force to establish a database. I will be absolutely fastidious and singleminded in my dedication to producing a database of all former residents with every house catalogued (and, ideally, pictured) up to and including dates of construction and demolition. I’ll dig into City records and find what the houses were valued at, what the residents were paid, where they relocated, the whole magilla. Of course that will depend on what records were actually retained and maintained, but if the preceding 26,914 words over the last two weeks have indicated anything, it’s that I’m obsessively thorough, and will get to the truth.\n\nAnd here’s something else I think we should do. A number of the houses were moved.\n\nMoved houses would have their destination listed in DBS records. If I find a survivor (roughly akin to this one, say) I suggest the city buy a relocated house, and return it to Chavez Ravine. There’s a lot of empty land up there north of the parking lot, put the house there, looking down over Dodger Stadium. The house can be turned into an interpretive center. Now that’s living history. Isn’t that a great idea? I think so too.\n\nThat’s my pitch, Councilmember Carrillo, so drop me a line at oldbunkerhill@gmail.com.

Part II made sure you knew Chavez Ravine’s history. Part III provided a snapshot of life in Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop during the 1940s, before it was forever changed. Part IV ran us through the story of the ill-fated Elysian Park Heights project, for which the Housing Authority removed all the residents and demolished the structures. Part V told the tale of how and why the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles.\n\nToday! We have arrived at the most famous story of all. That of the Arechiga Family.\n\nI. The Most Famous Photo of All\n\nOn May 8, 1959, after years of court battles and multiple eviction notices, LASD deputies finally removed the Arechigas from the two houses they occupied.\n\nThe mere mention of the Arechiga family—just the sight of this one solitary image—is all you need to prove that racist Dodgers AKA the Displacers attacked and violently and illegally evicted hundreds of families from their legal homes in May 1959.\n\nOf course, the actual facts behind the matter are more…nuanced. Claims of racism are just that, claims. Despite being popularly renamed “Displacers,” the Dodgers literally displaced no-one. And, despite what you’re told by the ruling chronicle, of Chavez Ravine’s “many families expelled” the sum total number of families dislodged by deputies was…one. The number of people actually forcibly removed was…one. Oh, and there was nothing illegal done to them.\n\nYes, to be strictly accurate—again, let me be clear, I do not approve of the taking of people’s property, but a thoughtful discussion requires we begin with legal clarity—the Arechiga family hadn’t owned their home for seven years, paying neither rent nor property tax, and had used the courts to stall multiple evictions over the course of years, until the day finally came when there was no other recourse but to remove them by force.\n\nAt which point (we are often told) they became homeless. That is, of course, not true either. They simply moved nearby, into one of the many other houses they owned.\n\nThe greater Arechiga tale, when factually observed, is actually not much of a story. However, the Arechiga narrative has garnered enormous weight and influence: they are, in fact, talked about more now than when they hit the limelight in 1959-1960, back when they were front page news of every major newspaper from coast to coast.\n\nTheir tale underscores why iconic photos are so important—were it not incredibly easy to use the shot of deputies carrying Aurora Vargas, the story would be no more or less important than a recounting of any other people removed, say, from Bunker Hill (or from the sites of countless other projects in Los Angeles involving eminent domain). Don’t get me wrong: the people removed from Bunker Hill were and remain enormously important, as were/are the people of Chavez Ravine; it’s just that the Arechiga family aren’t more important. Regardless, they have since become the go-to hallmark of the story because they so deftly worked the media, and continue to do so, as we’ll see.\n\nII. The Arechiga Story to 1950\n\nAbrana Cabral was born in Monte Escobedo, a municipality in the southwest portion of Zacatecas, a landlocked state on the Sierra Made mountain range of central Mexico, in 1897. In 1916 Abrana, pregnant, marries one Nicholas Ybarra, and together they cross the Rio Grande into Texas in October of that year. In April 1917 Abrana births daughter Delphina in Morenci, Arizona. Nicholas died of syphilis in August 1918.\n\nManuel Arechiga, born June 1889, was also from Monte Escobedo. He too had fled Mexico for Arizona; he weds the widow Abrana in 1920. They have daughter Aurora Arechiga in Morenci in June 1921.\n\nManuel worked at the Phelps Dodge Copper concern, but the cessation of World War One resulted in plummeting copper prices; many smelters were closed and jobs lost. Manuel and Abrana, seeking greener pastures, head west to Los Angeles, in 1922. They settle in the westernmost part of Chavez Ravine, on Malvina at the edge of the Palo Verde Tract. They have a son, Juan, in February 1923; daughter Celia in April 1924; Manuel Jr. in October 1926; and Victoria in November 1929.\n\nIII. Their Houses\n\nThe famous houses for which they are known are 1767, 1771, and 1801 Malvina (it is from 1771 that Aurora Vargas is famously carried, making it arguably one of the most famous houses in Los Angeles history). These three are the houses it is said the Arechigas built, because they owned them in 1959 (although by 1959, the Arechigas had already demolished 1801 themselves). In all likelihood they built none of the three, but rather purchased them over time.\n\nIn the 1930 census the whole family are shown as residing at 1813 Malvina, and they’re in the 1934 phone book at 1813 Malvina. There’s no record of the construction of 1771 in DBS filings; but Arechiga is shown as its owner in 1940.\n\n1767 was built by a man named Jose Rodrigquez in late 1923, though Manuel Arechiga is listed as its owner on Building & Safety permits in 1946.\n\nIn 1940 they’re renting a house at 1801 Malvina (the family numbering only seven now, since Manuel Jr. died, age eight, after falling from the balcony in the Lyceum Theater on Spring Street.) Manuel’s 1942 draft card shows him living at 1801 Malvina. At some point Manuel purchases 1801 after 1940.\n\nThough they own 1771 in 1940, they’re not seen living at 1771 until a 1943 newspaper mention (seen below). In the 1950 Census, Manuel and Abrana live at 1771 with their son Juan, and his wife Nellie and their daughter Helen, along with Victoria. Aurora, Celia and Delphina have since moved on to start their own lives (Aurora lived on Hyde Park Blvd.)\n\nIV. Living their Lives\n\nFrom the 1920s through to the 1950s, the family lived their lives in Palo Verde—which we might expect to be uneventful—but they made the papers now and then. For example, teenage Victoria Arechiga turned her back on her pet goat, who butted her down the hill, sending her to hospital for X-rays.\n\nLess “human interest story” was the car-crash killing done by Porfidio Vargas, an Arechiga family member.\n\nPorfidio was born in March of 1919 to Ambrosio Barboza Vargas, a native of Irapuato, Mexico. Ambrosio crossed into Texas in 1907 with his father Gregorio in 1907. They made their way to Los Angeles and were one of the first families to build in Chavez Ravine, in 1913, as part of Stimson’s settlement program. Ambrosio, 18, married Tiburcia Gonzalez, age 16, in Los Angeles in 1915. They had nine children (of whom Porfidio was third born). Ambrosio became an American citizen in Los Angeles in 1932. Their house was at 1767 Gabriel, a stone’s throw from Malvina.\n\nPorfidio met Aurora Vargas, who lived one block over at 1801 Malvina. They were married in 1938; she was 17.\n\nIn June 1941 Porfidio was 22 years old and a member of the Palo Verde gang. He and his gang crashed a party being held in Rose Hill gang territory on Boundary Avenue. A brawl ensued, and Palo Verde gang member Juan C. Flores, of 1738 Gabriel Ave., was stabbed, near fatally. After that, Porfidio got into a game of chicken with a Rose Hills gang member, Ramon Araujo. Neither budged, and the cars crashed head on, at the corner of Boundary and Roberta (which converged, once, before eminent domain came and took out huge swaths of houses for Rose Hill Park). Remarkably, both Vargas and Araujo survived, but both of Araujo’s passengers—Peter Barraras, 16, and Peter Del Gado, 18, were killed. Porfidio Vargas fled the scene, but was arrested the next day.\n\nVargas and Araujo went before the Municipal Judge for felony negligent homicide, but were set free because gang members threatened all the witnesses.\n\nPorfidio was inducted into the US Army in June 1943, and sent to Europe. In December 1944 he was one of the very first to die in the Battle of the Bulge, which would claim 20,000 American lives in the Ardennes that winter, leaving Aurora a widow.\n\nAnother sobering story involves Juan (AKA John) Cabral Arechiga, Manuel and Abrana’s only living son. In December 1942 Juan, 19, gets married to Nellie Tavison, also 19, and have daughter Helen in September 1943.\n\nThen, on March 18th, 1944, Juan Arechiga kidnapped and raped an underage schoolgirl. Juan abducted Mary Louise Fernandez, 17, of 622 North Broadway, a junior at Lincoln High, whom he grabbed on Ord near Broadway as she walked home after school. After abducting her, Arechiga beat her, threatened her if she made noise, and drove her into Chavez Ravine and raped her in the dirt. Fernandez immediately turned him in and it goes to trial, where Juan is found guilty. People will say well, of course they found him guilty, poor people only get some terrible public defender who doesn’t even care about him because the system is broken, etc.\n\nNo. His parents Manuel and Abrana hired the famed trial lawyer Rosalind Goodrich Bates, but despite top-tier defense, the jury still found him quite guilty. Juan goes to San Quentin in December 1944, and serves four years for kidnap and rape.\n\nOther than those instances, the Arechigas led a quiet life. Until that fateful day…\n\nV. The 1950s\n\nJuly 1950, everybody gets the letter saying your days are numbered: we, the City Housing Authority, are coming for your house, which we are taking through condemnation. This includes the Arechiga properties, which stand at 1767, 1771 and 1801 Malvina.\n\nRemuneration was fixed at $10,050 by the Superior Court of California, wherein, for their property, the Superior Court looked at three appraisals of their property, and then picked the appraisal with the highest value.\n\nThey are given $10,050 for the three lots, which doesn’t sound like much, but the going rate for a house were you to buy one in Chavez Ravine in 1951, was $2000.\n\nBut, you say, that can’t be right! But it is: the average cost of a home in 1950 in Chavez Ravine was $2000. Here, for example, are some random home values from very nearby, via the 1940 Federal Census.\n\n1766 Malvina, $700; 1767 Gabriel, $1500, 1722 Malvina, $1500; 1255 and 1259 Effie, $900 and $1600. Unfortunately, come the 1950 census, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census discontinued providing home valuation. But, let’s say that home values doubled in the decade 1940-1950. That puts us right there with the $2000 average 1950 valuation. Bear in mind, the average cost of a home in 1950 was $7,354 in the United States; that the Chavez homes were only 30% of the national average is completely understandable, given all we know about their general construction, the neighborhood services, etc.\n\nBear in mind as well, the average value of three homes in Chavez Ravine, at $2k per, $6,000. The $10,050 appraisal on the three Arechiga properties is nearly double the average going price in the area.\n\nIf you don’t agree with the amount of money they award you, you file an appeal. The people who filed appeals got more money; many of the Arechiga neighbors did. The Arechiga family, however, for whatever reason, did not feel the need to file an appeal.\n\nA couple years go by, and they never file an appeal, and eventually the appeal window closed in February 1953, and that is that.\n\nOoops, not yet. Come October 1953, the Arechigas file suit in Superior Court against the Housing Authority. The Housing Authority asked for a writ of possession, which would have dispossessed the family immediately. The Arechiga lawyer, George Gailliard Bauman (attorney, hardcore Republican, and president of the conservative Small Property Owner’s League) blocked the move and obtained a 30-day stay of execution from Superior Court Judge Samuel L. Blake.\n\nThat 30-day stay of execution lasted five and a half years.\n\nThe Arechiga’s argument was someone told us our property was worth $17,500. You only deposited $10,050 in our account. Give us the extra $7,450, and we’ll pack up everything and go.\n\nProblem is, they had two years to file an appeal, as many neighbors had. The Arechigas didn’t, so, the judgement became final. In court, the judge realized that if people were to sidestep procedure and insist on setting their own price in eminent domain proceedings, nothing—no roads, no schools, no court houses, no public housing—would ever be built. The Arechigas were told sorry.\n\n1953 ends. 1954 goes by. So does 1955, and then 1956. The Arechigas live in the cleared-out Ravine. (Of course I shouldn’t have to repeat this, but no, during this entire time there exists not the slightest inkling of anything related whatsoever to the Dodgers.)\n\nIn 1957, the Arechigas, after waiting four years to get evicted, finally get evicted. But I thought they didn’t get evicted until 1959! you say.\n\nThe Arechigas didn’t own their house from 1953-1957, while they battled in court. The matter goes to the District Court of Appeal in 1957, and the presiding judge said “when the judgement in the condemnation case became final, they were divested of all interest in the property regardless of the purpose for which it might later be used.”\n\nNow you may not like it, but, fact is, when the State takes your home for eminent domain, you don’t get to keep it. If you think it only happens to poor people of color, consider the hundreds of homes in southwest Pasadena, taken by Caltrans, for the 710 project. That never got built, and those homes aren’t going back to the owners, are they.\n\nFact is, the Arechiga place on Malvina, was legally not their home. They lived there for years without paying rent or property taxes. The City could have very easily said well this is our home not yours, we’re turning off the water and power, but they didn’t do that, did they.\n\nAnd at this point, in the spring of 1957, we finally have some mention of the Dodgers! In May the National League owners granted permission for the Dodgers to move to Los Angeles if certain conditions were met.\n\nAfter the Arechigas lost their court case (again) in 1957, they were served an official eviction notice and on the 21st of August, 1957, deputies showed up with a Writ of Possession and evicted them, and began hauling out their belongings.\n\nDaughter Victoria Angustain (Victoria Arechiga had married Miguel “Mike” Angustain, an employee of the Department of Recreation and Parks) punched and bit officers removing the furniture, but hey—if deputies are such fascists (as we are so often reminded), they’d beat Victoria with truncheons, right? No, instead the Arechigas were granted a two-week stay on the eviction order (Councilman Roybal intervened), so the deputies had to haul all their belongings back into the house, and that two-week stay turned into another two years of squatting.\n\n1957 turns to 1958 to 1959, with the Arechigas waiting patiently for the next eviction order. (They had had their final appeal denied in April 1958—read the judgement here.)\n\nThe next order to vacate comes on March 9, 1959: they are served a 30-day eviction notice: you are going to be out on April 10, 1959, no ifs ands or buts. Abrana looks at the notice on April 10th:\n\nApril 10 was the day the Arechigas were supposed to be out, but they stalled further, and were granted another 30-day-stay.\n\nMay 8th, therefore, became, after nearly a decade of stalling, the day they were supposed to be out (you will hear “the City was mean and evil and evicted them on Mother’s Day weekend!” but for accuracy’s sake, their eviction occurring on Mother’s Day weekend…was entirely the work of the Arechigas and their lawyer).\n\nVI. The Big Day\n\nFriday, May 8th, 1959: at 11:30 in the morning, eight male and three female LASD deputies arrived to enforce the March 11 Superior Court Writ; they were led by Capt. Joe Brady. They were joined by fifteen cars full of television reporters and the press. Three moving vans had already arrived. It was the deputies’ intent to take possession of 1771 Malvina (home of Manuel and Abrana) and 1767 Malvina (home of Victoria and Miguel Angustain). 1801 Malvina had already been demolished by the Arechigas, for reasons unknown. (Alice Martin, 1456 Davis; Sally Ramirez, 1850 Reposa; and Glenn Walters, of 1853 Reposa, also left that day, without incident, although Walters was detained for obstruction during the Arechiga dust-up. Martin had bought back her house from the City, for $2,500, with the proviso that it be moved, but was then found to be not structurally sound enough to be moved.)\n\nDeputies entered, then engaged in discussion with Victoria and Abrana about leaving (Manuel remained outside; Aurora wasn’t there). Workmen began to remove personal items into moving vans.\n\nAurora Vargas arrived on the scene. She ran past the deputies, and announced to the reporters, they’ll have to carry me out! And with that she ran up into the house.\n\nThe deputies subsequently complied with Aurora’s request, and it has become one of the most famous images in Los Angeles history:\n\nAurora, kicked the officers and punched them, and was arrested for battery. (Though Victoria Angustain left peacefully, she later fought and struggled with police, but they let it go.) Released on bail, Aurora’s alleged battery went to trial: a jury of ten women and two men found her unanimously guilty, three counts of battery and one for obstruction, which was easy to do since there was so much film of her kicking and punching officers.\n\nThe cameras rolled and rolled—\n\n—it was the perfect media circus. It made the news coast-to-coast. Of course, as is their way, the media “helped” a little; here for example is the aforementioned Alice Martin and her roommate, Ruth Rayford, of 1456 Davis:\n\nAt the end of the day, eight years after the Arechigas lost their house, they finally lost their house. Their belongings were loaded into three moving vans—\n\nAnd the houses were demolished.\n\nBut the Arechigas did not depart. They were prepared with their tents and cookware and set up camp. The removal and demolition was a huge national story, covered coast to coast, and Los Angeles was a national, in fact, international embarrassment.\n\nThe City Council granted them the opportunity to speak at a public hearing, which they did on May 11.\n\n300 people packed council chambers, loudly denouncing the thugs who made innocent people homeless. The Arechigas agreed: they had been set upon without warning, impoverished, and now had nowhere to go. The newspapers reported that they were homeless:\n\nHomeless, they lived in a tent:\n\nThen, they lived in a donated trailer:\n\nOf course, they weren’t homeless. Not by a long shot.\n\nVII. The Arechiga Homes\n\nThat is correct. Not homeless. Not even remotely so. And we’ll set aside the fact that not one person in Chavez Ravine was made homeless, not one, because the Housing Authority worked diligently to relocate and find new homes for every single Ravine resident, as per the law. No, what made the Arechiga family interesting and unique is that…they could have just gone to one of their many, many other homes.\n\nThe Arechigas, however, just didn’t feel like going to any of the many houses owned by them, or houses owned by their son, or the homes owned by their daughters; between the folks and John and Aurora and Victoria, ten houses, eleven if you count the one daughter Celia owed and lived in out in Santa Fe Springs. Rather, they liked living in donated housing in Chavez Ravine, eating donated food, yelling at councilmembers, and getting in the papers.\n\nThe day after the big Council hearing, May 12, 1959, somebody thought to look at the tax rolls, and well look at that, they own eleven homes.\n\nVictoria (who owned three of the eleven) said, basically, “well we never denied owning eleven houses, it’s your fault you never asked us if we did.”\n\nYou will be told “they didn’t REALLY own all those homes!” Here is that claim, for example, in the “Battle of Chavez Ravine” Wikipedia page—\n\nSigh. I hate to have to do this, but because you’re being fed b.s., I’m now forced to detail all the homes they owned.\n\nThe home of Manuel and Abrana Arechiga:\n\nYes, they and they alone owned it outright. It is located at 3649 Ramboz Drive in City Terrace, and was brand new when Manuel and Abrana bought it in 1956.\n\n…and by 1959 they’d already paid off more than half the mortgage (they had purchased it for $8,500 in 1956, and in May 1959 only owed $3,700 on the mortgage). At the time of the Malvina eviction, they were renting it to their cousin, Estella Moldanado. It was to this house Manuel and Abrana moved in 1959, immediately after leaving their “homeless tent” in Chavez Ravine. Here they are, in the 1960 Los Angeles telephone directory:\n\nAnd this is the OTHER home legally purchased and owned by Manuel and Abrana Arechiga:\n\nThis house is at 2410 Glover Place. Three bedroom, built in 1925. They had their 42-year-old daughter Delphina Hernandez (Abrana’s daughter from Nicholas Ybarra) living in it.\n\nDaughter Victoria was also not made homeless, she and her husband Miguel Angustain Jr. owned property at 1430-32 Allison Avenue, a stone’s throw from Chavez Ravine.\n\nStrictly speaking this is THREE houses, since there are three separate standalone structures on the lot. Two houses in front running down the sloped site, this being the house in back:\n\nIn fact here’s a shot of the family hauling the furniture from Chavez Ravine up to their house:\n\nWhat of daughter Aurora, the one famously carried by force from her “home” at 1771 Malvina? She owned both these homes:\n\nThese are two houses at 659 and 657 Simmons Avenue, for which Aurora Vargas had paid $8,500 and $5,600, respectively.\n\nIn 1959 son Juan Arechiga owned a house at 2651 Benedict Street. Great little Spanish number built in 1929. You will be told that it was being taken by eminent domain, he’s going to have to sell out to build the freeway (a story repeated in Nusbaum’s book, for example). But that’s not true. John sells it in 1965 to an outfit called Quality Bilt Homes and they tear it down, and erect an apartment building which opens in 1967. It looked like this:\n\nJuan Arechiga owned another house. It was this two-unit at Ewing Street & Echo Park Avenue:\n\nYou will be told that this house is important because it’s where the Arechiga family “fled” after the Malvina demolition. But as is the case with so much Chavez Lore, you are being lied to. Juan (who did not live in Chavez Ravine) bought this house in March 1959. In May of that year his parents were evicted from Malvina, and they moved to their house on Ramboz. NO-ONE removed from Chavez Ravine ever lived in this house; this house has no relationship with or to the Arechiga/Palo Verde tale. Juan owns it for all of five years, and sells it to a man named Maurice Owen Eubanks in March 1964. (FYI, 1553 Ewing St./2004 Echo Park Ave., AKA the “Queen of Elysian Heights” made the news recently, and I’ll cover that in the next installment, Part VII.)\n\nAnd lastly, here’s the home of daughter Celia, which sort of counts but sort of doesn’t. Like Delphina, Celia didn’t muck about with the Chavez Ravine doings much.\n\nAlso, it was out at 9112 Arlee Ave., Santa Fe Springs, seventeen miles southeast of Chavez Ravine, so it doesn’t really fall under the umbrella of the Los Angeles Arechigas…but still.\n\nManuel and Abrana live the rest of their lives in their house on Ramboz; they pass in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Juan and Nellie pass in 2010 and 2018; Aurora in 2006.\n\nJuan and Nellie’s daughter Jeannie, born in 1955, gives birth to Melissa, in 1975. And with that, comes a whole new era of Arechigas vis-à-vis Chavez Ravine.\n\nVIII. Arechigas: The Next Generation\n\nManuel and Abrana’s great-granddaughter Melissa Arechiga takes on the Chavez Ravine mantle in 2017 when she begins “Buried Under the Blue,” her activist group for reparations to descendants of residents. BUtB get their 501(c)3 in July 2019. In May 2022 she wrote this petition which directly led to the Reparations Bill.\n\nIt’s an interesting petition. If you’ve read this post, and the preceding five, you’ll see that BUtB’s assertions are…creative, so much so, I feel no need to address them point-by-point.\n\nTwo things to note about the petition, though, it’s curious to see that paragraph five, concerning Judge Praeger, is a cut-and-paste (with a sentence added at the end) from this pamphlet. (As I mentioned before, Praeger’s judgement is a minor footnote in the greater tale, since it was immediately and unanimously overruled by the State Supreme Court and the Chief Justice.) Arechiga took it from a pamphlet published by the Small Property Owners League of Los Angeles, who were right-leaning conservatives, so I’m glad to see BUtB is willing to consider disparate sources.\n\nSecondly, what’s important to note is the meat of the matter, their demands:\n\nAs I mentioned in the very first post of this series, historical monuments and community centers, awesome (and I’ll be interested to see how HACLA words their apology). The fundamental essence of their demands lays, of course, in a demand for reparations.\n\nNow, were I a cynical man, I might raise an eyebrow. After all, a demand for money was the entirety of the Arechiga kerfuffle in the first place.\n\nAnd now, the same family wants more money…again.\n\nA friend of mine likened this to a grift, which I thought was a bit strong; it’s more a strong-arm guilting, I said. He said if BUtB had actual truth and facts, it would be a guilting; but without those, it’s just a con. I’ll leave it for you folks to decide that.\n\nIn any event, BUtB lobbied our elected representatives, and got what they wanted:\n\nBUtB does much of its outreach on social media; for example, it has over 15,000 followers on Instagram. Here is Melissa Arechiga, the new face of Chavez Ravine, with a typical IG post:\n\nAnd that is the tale of the Arechigas! Come back in a couple days when we wrap up our whole tale in Part VII, a breakdown of the main myths about Chavez Ravine. See you there!\n\n**************\n\nThis is seven-part series.

Part II answered the question of “what is this Chavez Ravine?” Part III gave a rough sketch of what life was like in Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop during the postwar era, before it was depopulated. Part IV ran us through the history of the Elysian Park Heights project, under whose aegis the area was cleared.\n\nToday! You’ve probably heard of the Dodgers. And you know their stadium is in Chavez Ravine. How did they get there? Let’s find out!\n\nI. A Team Called the Dodgers\n\nIn the previous installment we dealt with Chavez Ravine as it related to postwar public housing projects and the subsequent demolition of homes in the Ravine, etc.\n\nDuring that time, out in Brooklyn, there was a baseball team called the Dodgers. They played at an aging (built 1913), small stadium, with little parking, called Ebbets Field. The team and stadium were owned by a fellow named Walter O’Malley.\n\nO’Malley was in the works to build a new, capacious, privately-owned domed baseball stadium on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, but was thwarted by government. New York City Building Commissioner Robert Moses insisted it be a city-owned stadium, and had to be located in Queens. O’Malley and Moses battled over this for years on end, both certain they’d get what they want.\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles had been hot to get a major league team for a very long time, and we pestered all sorts of teams to give Los Angeles a shot at relocation. In 1955 the City Council wrote a letter to O’Malley to say heyyy, we could use a team here, but O’Malley brushed them off. (Some people will try and tell you that when Council attempted to court O’Malley in 1955, that these communiques involved Chavez Ravine and somehow prove a conspiracy against La Loma, Palo Verde, and Bishop. That is, of course, a fiction; it’s nonsense on the face of it, since those neighborhoods were already depopulated and demolished pre-1955. But much more revealing: here’s a post alleging Council’s letter reveals we were attempting to displace Ravine denizens and destroy its neighborhoods in 1955…but then you read the actual letter and it says nothing about Chavez Ravine.)\n\nIn late 1956 O’Malley was in Los Angeles, and even gave a speech about how and why he would not move the Dodgers to Los Angeles.\n\nO’Malley had been working for ten years to replace Ebbets Field, stymied by Moses, and was hoping against hope he’d still be able to build his dream stadium in Brooklyn. But by the spring of 1957 he’d had enough of New York’s corruption, so he looked to sunnier climes.\n\nIn May 1957 we finally got O’Malley out to Los Angeles, to look at a half-dozen prospective sites. O’Malley goes up in the whirlybird—May 2, 1957—and from the air examines Wrigley Field (which O’Malley had acquired the previous February) and the Coliseum, etc. But then O’Malley saw the stacks, AKA the famous four-way freeway interchange, right next to a huge piece of empty land.\n\nHe had seen Chavez Ravine, and concluded if he was going to spend twenty million dollars out of his own pocket to build Los Angeles a stadium, that’s where it was going to be located.\n\nThe city had zero money for any of its lofty and various Ravine plans (lake/college/zoo/expansion of the Police Academy, etc., much less a massive ballpark). The idea that someone else would spend the millions to build a 50,000-seat stadium was a godsend.\n\nThere exists a persistent mythological narrative that the City had always planned to displace the people of Chavez Ravine for a stadium. Not only is that not true, as borne out by the simple chronology of events, but there is a paper trail to prove that contention false. A July 1956 Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks study, investigating the idea of a stadium in a dozen some-odd places around Los Angeles, noted this about Chavez Ravine, when it dismissed the idea: “The rugged topography of this area does not appear to be desirable for the proposed use,” adding “most of the property considered for this use is owned by the City of Los Angeles and is vacant. Abutting land is in private ownership and, except for a few small residences, is vacant.” So not only did they note the area to be vacant (when revisionists say it wasn’t) the Powers That Be still didn’t consider it useful stadium territory.\n\nII. Regarding Public Purpose\n\nThe City had long since repurchased their land from the Feds, so it belonged to the City to do with as they pleased. There existed the stipulation—as written into the Housing Authority deed transfer—that the land be used for a public purpose. A lot of people will yell at you that “a baseball stadium is not a public purpose!”\n\nUm, when there’s 56,000 people there, I fail to think of a better definition of public purpose. I’m not a sports guy and personally don’t care about baseball—but I do acknowledge there’s enormous public purpose value to the vast civic pride the Dodgers bring. Above and beyond the Dodgers, I remember when 56,000 people were crammed therein to see John Paul II perform mass. People also filled it to see The Beatles and Bowie and the Stones and Springsteen and Guns n Roses and Michael Jackson, and on and on (even Elvis, sort of, who filmed Spinout in the stadium parking lot) … speaking of race cars and public purpose, did you know there used to be awesome road races in the parking lot?\n\nAnyway, I say that fits the definition of public purpose, though some certainly insist it does not, but…\n\n… you want to know the kicker? The whole “public purpose” clause of the Housing Authority deed restriction was made void by the Court in a unanimous decision anyway, so there’s literally no reason for people to talk about it … but they sure do anyway. In short: the CHA transferred the land to the City with the “public purpose” clause, that did not in any way define what “public purpose” actually meant or entailed. Arguments over the public purpose deed restriction were made in trial courtrooms through the summer of 1958 in Los Angeles Superior Court. The matter went to the State Supreme Court, where it was decided the the public purpose restriction had in fact been fulfilled.\n\nBut oh! they continue, that may be true buuuuut….public purpose doesn’t have to be legal, it’s moral, and all that civic pride is only just making money for the owner, it’s therefore immoral and not a public purpose! Well if we’re going to talk about money: Chavez Ravine, before its condemnation by the government, containing all those La Loma/Palo Verde/Bishop residents, paid a yearly sum total of $7,400 in property taxes. In the first year after having opened the stadium, the Dodgers paid $345,000, a 50-fold increase of money into the City coffers. Over the last sixty years the Dodgers have paid nearly a billion dollars into the City coffers just from property taxes. Not to mention the state and local taxes, employment opportunities, entertainment spending, and so forth. When the City spends money on roads, schools, wastewater treatment, public safety, and all that jazz, a billion dollars of that money came to the city via a private entity building a stadium on their own dime.\n\nAgain, the California Supreme Court ruled in favor of public purpose in January 1959 (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court) when it said that the contract with the Dodgers brought such enormous benefit to the City, and had thus fulfilled and nullified the deed restriction. After which, the California Supreme Court unanimously sustained its ruling repeatedly through 1959.\n\nBut oh! you will be instructed, the city should have built its own stadium, then it would be *ours*, and not in the private hands of dumb private people! Sorry, but as I just mentioned, in the late 1950s the City of LA did not remotely have that kind of money to build a stadium, and if we had, the City would never have received that $1billion in property taxes.\n\nBut because I hear a lot about how the City lost out because it did not build its own municipally-owned and run stadium, let’s devote a few paragraphs to the difference between the privately-funded, and the taxpayer-funded, American ballpark:\n\nNow remember, a privately-funded ballpark is as rare as hen’s teeth…for a reason. Yes, Walter O’Malley got two 99-year leases for $1 a year—cue the chorus of it’s a backroom deal conspiracy and he stole the land!—but the fact stands, he spent $23million out of his own pocket to build the stadium (oh, and before you say he was “given” the land, nope, he deeded land he owned, worth about $2million, to the City of Los Angeles, in exchange for Chavez land, worth about $2million). Then O’Malley spent his $23million to build the stadium, which, adjusted for inflation he therefore spent, in today’s money, $242million. That’s a quarter of a billion dollars out of O’Malley’s pocket to build the stadium, which, 62 years later, remains an exceptional stadium.\n\nConversely, from the 1920s to the 60s, all the major American ballparks were constructed as municipal stadiums, built by local governments, paid for by taxpayers. The last privately funded baseball stadium had been Yankee Stadium, and that was in 1923. So when people say the City of Los Angeles could have/should have built the stadium itself instead o"
