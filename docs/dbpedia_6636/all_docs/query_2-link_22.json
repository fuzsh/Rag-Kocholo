        "text": "I found some information on the Barney Hotel/Beach House in the deed when looking up some information at the town hall several years ago. Before that, it had just been an interesting old picture or two, but the description of what was in the hotel seemed to bring it a bit more to life, and then later finding all of the tidbits in the two local newspapers fleshed it out a bit more.\n\nPutting it all together makes you think that in its day it must have been to the village something like what JCAT is today, a place where area folks could gather for some good food and companionship. Your blog seems like a good means to pass on this information to a whole group that today don't realize that the hotel even existed.\n\n~ Gary Irish\n\nThe History of the Barney Hotel / Beach House\n\nBy Gary Irish\n\nEdited by Bernie Paquette, Maeve Kim\n\nHistoric photos used with permission from Gary Irish\n\nThe old hotel was located on the north side of the corner of Main and Church Streets, what is today Route 15 beside the present location of Joe’s Snack Bar. It was built by Truman Barney sometime before 1817 and was one of Jericho’s most famous landmarks in the early days. Before the railroad, the arrival of the stagecoach was a noteworthy event, as it also brought the news. The hotel was sold by Martin Chittenden to Truman Barney’s son Martin Barney on July 8, 1829. This deed mentions the property extended on the “north to the fence which divides the tavern stand from the brickyard”. Nothing is known about this brickyard, but likely it is where brick for some of Jericho Corners’ early brick houses was made.\n\nThis shows the building when it was the Barney Hotel. The photographer would have been standing about what today would be in Lee River Road at the intersection of Plains Road, so you can see the little park that is still there, where the war memorial is now located.\n\nThe hotel, at that time known as the Barney Hotel, was operated by Martin and his brothers Lucius, Albert, and Solomon Barney over the years, but most notably by Martin and his wife Maria (Young) Barney, who operated it as a tavern and hotel as well as a livery stable from 1852 to 1870. It was noted that Mr. Barney was a genial landlord and Mrs. Barney was a woman of great executive ability that made it possible to run a successful business. In 1880 the hotel was sold to local businessman Ferdinand Beach and became known as the Beach House. He hired a succession of managers for the hotel: Clarence Percival in 1880, F.D. Gilson in 1884, in 1886 Edgar Blakey and H.S. Manley in 1888.\n\nMy guess is that this is a few years later when it had become the Beach House. If you notice in the first picture, there is an enclosure above the porch, which is now gone in this picture, and it appears to be an entirely new porch. The building on the right is the end of the post office block.\n\nIn 1889, the hotel was sold to J.H. May. Mr. May seems to have been a wheeler-dealer, dabbling in any number of enterprises, but particularly interested in horses and wagons. The hotel appears to have been just one of his interests, and perhaps his main interest in it was the attached livery stable, as an ad in the March 13, 1889, Chittenden Reporter stated “Beach House Jericho Vt. J.H. May, proprietor. A good livery in connection with the house. Also dealer in horses, carriages, and wagons.”\n\nIn an ad on August 24, 1892, Chittenden Reporter stated: “Closing out sale. The hotel at Jericho Corners known as the Beach House must be sold within the next three months. $1500 cash down and easy payments for the balance. J.H. May, Underhill, Vt. July 18, 1892” At that time, Z.F. Hapgood was the hotel manager.\n\nIn April 1893 May was advertising that he was selling carriages, wagons, and harnesses of all kinds in Underhill. On October 25, he advertised an auction at his residence in Underhill where he was selling 13 horses and colts, 33 wagons, and 25 sets of harnesses, as well as furniture and farming tools. And he also advertised that he was selling off a lot of wagons and harnesses at 52 Merchant Street in Burlington. He further announced that he was moving to Jericho on November 1st.\n\nMeanwhile, in November 1893, a local news item mentioned that \"The name of our hotel has been changed from Beach House to Hotel Jericho.\"\n\nApparently, he was unable to sell it, as another ad in July 1894 said that “J.H. May advertises his hotel for sale” and records seem to show that Mr. May sold the hotel to E.H. Smith of Burlington in September 1894, with Mr. Smith to take possession on October 1st. On September 15, Mr. May held an auction at the Hotel Jericho stables (he was also an auctioneer), where he was selling horses, wagons, sleighs, harnesses, and robes. But two curious news items appeared in the Green Mountain Press – on October 23, 1894 “J.H. May will close his hotel November 1st unless the charge now in court is not pressed” and on November 6 “The hotel has been closed and the sign taken down.”\n\nWhatever the “charge now in court” might have been, it appears that the sale to Mr. Smith did not go through, as on December 18, 1894, it was noted that Mr. May had rented his hotel to William Folsom of Essex for 3 years, and the next week the Green Mountain Press noted that “Wm. Folsom of Essex is now proprietor of the hotel, he having moved in last week. He has the house well-furnished and will spare no pains for the comfort of his patrons.” Mr. Folsom apparently continued to operate the hotel for three years, as it was reported in March 1898, just over three years later, that “Wm. Folsom expects to vacate the hotel about the middle of April. He expects to move onto his farm in Essex.”\n\nHowever, there was an auction on January 30, 1897, where “the hotel and residence were bid off by V.A. Bullard, for Miss Nellie May, who takes the property, subject to encumbrances.” Perhaps one encumbrance was the lease to Mr. Folsom. Then on January 18, 1899, Mr. May bought the hotel once more, from Nellie & Joel D. Remington. He then turned around and sold it to Olive Folsom on February 18, 1899, for $4000. A few years ago, I was looking up something in the Jericho land records and came across the deed when the hotel was sold to Mrs. Folsom. Besides the usual \"the property is bounded on the west by...\" sort of description, it also included the following:\n\n\"Included one coal stove, and pipe, 6 dining room chairs, one extension table, one [unreadable] , 18 oyster plates, one kitchen range and pipe, one hair covered sofa, one hair covered rocker, 3 wooden bottom chairs in office, 1 large table in kitchen, 2 large tables in cellar, 12 extra chairs, 4 hardwood chamber sets with 2 chairs and rocker, 1 softwood chamber set with 2 chairs and rocker, 5 woven wire springs, 5 wood top mattresses, 16 window shades upstairs, 2 wash bowls and pitchers, 5 chambers, carpets in rooms 3-4-5-6 & 7, hall matting upstairs, hall oil cloth, 12 window shades below, No. 12 street lamp in archway, No. 2 hanging lamp, case and [unclear – maybe ‘chairs’] in hall, 2 bracket hanging lamps, hanging lamps in bar-room, 2 hanging lamps in chandelier in dining room, 2 bracket lamps in kitchen, 2 iron spittoons in office, 1 earthen spittoon in bar-room, 14 small glasses, 6 beer mugs, ½ pint measure and ½ pint tunnel, 1 show case, 1 large cork screw, 2 tobacco cutters, 1 small refrigerator, 1 large Baldwin refrigerator, 1 writing desk, 1 stool in office, 1 mirror, 1 clock, 1 stove and pipe in office, ice in ice house, shelves & counters in grocery store, possession to be given March 1st, 1899.”\n\nThis gives at least a glimpse of what the hotel might have looked like at the time. And now for a bit of what the times there were like.\n\nFrom the October 13, 1886 edition of the Chittenden Reporter:\n\n\"The Beach House was the recipient of a surprise party last Friday evening. About 40 partook of the supper, and some 15 couples enjoyed themselves by a dance in the dining room. All seemed satisfied with the evening's pleasures.\"\n\nAnd from November 3, 1886, Chittenden Reporter:\n\n\"Although the night was not very auspicious for such an entertainment last Wednesday, the music rendered in this village by the Underhill Band was very entertaining, and quite a crowd gathered from far and near to hear them. For the length of time that they have been in practice, and considering that they have no out-of-town talent to assist them, the boys played well.\n\nThe proprietors of the Beach House fairly out done [sic] themselves in the way of entertainment, providing a splendid repast not only for the members of the band but also for a large number of invited leading citizens of the village. A table seating 28 was loaded with good things, in the middle of which was a large cake bearing the inscription 'Underhill Band Boys'. At the close of the oyster supper, the house furnished cigars for their guests and a pleasant chit-chat followed. The band furnished music both before and after supper, and at the close of their playing they were presented with a contribution from those present amounting to $13.25.\" [That would equal somewhere around $375 today.]\n\nThe same era as the second photo, just taken in winter. These three pictures are the only ones known of the hotel.\n\nOther examples were in March 1896 “a party of eighteen young people from Westford, coming in a four-horse team, had supper at the hotel last night.” And that December, “After the special Masonic meeting Thursday night to work the first degree, the Masons repaired to the Hotel Jericho, where landlord Folsom had prepared a bountiful supper.” Also noted at that time was that “Armand Jackson and Miss Emma Davis, who have been working at the hotel, have resigned. They will be married tomorrow.” And so the next week “Miss Flynn [was] working at the hotel.” Again, in November 1897, “Forty-five took supper at the hotel Thursday night.” Such stories make one think that, in its day, it would have reminded one of JCAT today.\n\nBut besides such pleasant times, there was the following, from the April 9, 1889 edition of the Green Mountain Press:\n\nSheriff Reeves arrived in town on the 9:24 mail train this forenoon, having with him a bench warrant from the Chittenden County Court, directing him to take to Burlington J.H. May. They went down on the following train. The hotel was searched last Tuesday by Sheriffs Reeves and Galusha, during the absence of the proprietor. The only find was a jug said to contain cider.\n\nAnd the next week, the paper reported:\n\n\"At county court last Tuesday, J.H. May was fined $50 and costs.\"\n\nAlthough the same paper also noted that \"The Beach House passenger conveyance is now at every train.\"\n\nJuly 16, 1889, Green Mountain Press had a story about liquor being stolen in North Williston, and Officer Wheeler of Burlington came to the Beach House in search of it. \"The terrified proprietor had a bottle of liquid in his possession which he did not want the officer to have, and he threw it through the window. Mr. Wheeler proceeded after it, but before getting it, Mrs. May had emerged from another door and emptied the bottle.\"\n\nAnother story in the November 26, 1889 paper tells of the hotel being searched again for liquor, with some being found in a closet. J.H. May was to go on trial the next day, but the December 3rd paper reported that he did not appear at the hearing on the liquor seizure.\n\nAn interesting incident was reported in May 1, 1894, Green Mountain Press:\n\n“About 7:30 o’clock Saturday evening Thomas Casey entered the hotel and called for whiskey, which Mrs. May declined to furnish. A knockdown followed in which May discharged his revolver, but missed and hit the floor. May’s son dealt Casey a blow on the head with a poker which left a wound taken for the bullet hole. Sunday Drs. Nay & Burdick determined no bullet had struck Casey.”\n\nOne item in January 20, 1891, Green Mountain Press gives mention of another curious Jericho institution:\n\n\"The supper given by Jericho members of the Iron Hall to the Hall of Winooski Friday evening at the Beach House is pronounced one of the nicest suppers ever given in the village, and Mr. Hapgood, who keeps the house, is to be highly congratulated for his efforts. There were sixty-two who sat down to table. The Winooski lodge has invited this one to return the visit next Monday evening.\"\n\nThe Iron Hall was a fraternal and insurance-based organization, the local branch of which had been formed in Jericho on January 11, 1888, and as part of their one-year anniversary celebration in January 1889, they extended \"an earnest invitation...to all, especially the 'skeptical' to be present and learn how the society can give $1000 for $300, and still keep in a thriving financial condition.\" How they could do this eventually proved to be via a pyramid scheme!\n\nBut in the meantime, on February 25, 1889 \"under the auspices of The Iron Hall, the celebrated dramatical and musical entertainment of the 'Wrens' will be given at Academy Hall...They come highly recommended from many sources....\" and in March 1889, they \"rented the whole of the second floor of D.E. Rood's harness building as a meeting room. It will also be used by the ladies branch of that order.\" That would be Sisterhood Branch No. 1001, which at that time numbered 17 members.\n\nNationally, the Iron Hall was defunct by about 1892, although an April 16, 1895 article in the Green Mountain Press stated that “the court has decided that all funds of the defunct Iron Hall now in Vermont shall be divided among the members in this state”. D.E. Rood's harness building was just to the east of the Pierce Block, across the street from the hotel, and was destroyed in the fire that burned the Pierce Block on January 11, 1901. Academy Hall is what you would know today as the second floor of the present town hall. But I digress...\n\nBesides his being in the hotel business, the local paper noted in October 1894 that J.H. May was also fixing over his horse barn into a store, and building a large carriage shed on his property. By April 1895, he had an ad in the Green Mountain Press for the “Jericho Carriage & Harness Store, J.H. May.”\n\nIn January 1896 it was reported that he had just received a carload of 30 open and top carriages from the H.M. Whitney Co. of Cortland, N.Y. and that he would “sell at auction at his place of business in Jericho, Vt. on Saturday, January 18, 1896, 50 new cutters, work sleds, harnesses, robes, blankets, etc.” And in the August 25, 1896, Green Mountain Press: “J.H. & R.H. May started yesterday for Morrisville with a train of wagons. He will have an auction there Saturday. Mr. May is known all over northern Vermont as ‘the wagon man’.”\n\nTwo views of the Chesmore Block (on left) and the post office block (on right). In the top photo, you can see that these were actually two separate buildings, although very close together. It was the right building where J.H. May had his store, as, by that time, E.B. Williams had moved to the store beside the hotel. These were located where Stan Knapp now lives, his house being the former restaurant building built in the 1930s.\n\nThese buildings burned on November 20, 1906, and this is a photo of the aftermath. You can see the former Woodsmen's Hall, now apartments, in the background, in the intersection of Plains and Lee River Roads.\n\nIn September 1896, Mr. May took over the store known as the Post Office block, formerly occupied by E.B. Williams as a drug store and post office, remodeling the rooms preparatory to putting in a stock of groceries and boots and shoes. By November, E.H. White had finished painting and was papering May’s new store, and it was reported that it would be very attractive when completed. By the next March, the store was reported open at last, with a full and complete line of choice family groceries and provisions, and the ad mentioned that Mr. May was still selling carriages, wagons, and harnesses. In addition, Miss Nellie Dorr of Burlington was dressmaking at J.H. May’s store.\n\nIn 1901, Lafayette Wilbur purchased the northern portion of the hotel property, the area bordering Buel Martin’s home and jewelry store, and built a building for his law office. He also rented the upstairs to M.E. McMahon for his barbershop (who advertised he was a tonsorial artist and had sharp razors and a light touch, with haircutting a specialty) for a time. About 1913, this building was purchased by H.T. Chase, who converted it to a general store, which use continues today as Jericho General Store.\n\nH.T. Chase's store, what had been built as Lafayette Wilbur's law office. This is today Mel Mitchell's Jericho General Store.\n\nJericho lost its landmark on the night of October 8, 1904. The Burlington Free Press described it as follows:\n\nBig Fire in Jericho\n\nHotel, Livery Stable and Store-House Burned-Loss Placed At $12,000\n\nJericho, Oct. 9 – For the second time within 18 months this village was visited with disastrous fire yesterday. The only hotel property in town together with livery and mercantile storehouses were burned and a stock of general merchandise practically ruined, involving a conservatively estimated loss of $12,000 and severely crippling the business interests of the village.\n\nThe fire was discovered at about nine o’clock in the attic of the Folsom House, owned and conducted by William Folsom. It is thought that the origin was in a defective chimney. At the time of discovery, the fire had spread through the entire attic and this upper story was a mass of flames. With the inadequate means at hand, attention was immediately turned to saving the surrounding property and the wonder is that the entire village was not wiped out, there being at the time a strong south wind. A bucket brigade was formed, women passing water in the line from the neighboring mill pond shoulder to shoulder with the men.\n\nJust west of the hotel was the general store of E.B. Williams separated only by a driveway from the burning building. The side of this store was covered with carpeting which was kept saturated with water and here it was that a heroic effort that the fire was stopped in this direction. The stable immediately in the rear of the hotel was allowed to burn as were the ice house and storehouse of E.B. Williams. The stock and carriages in the stable and the goods in the store were saved.\n\nIn the second story of the hotel were nine furnished rooms and nothing was saved here. The personal effects of the proprietor and family were taken out. Mr. Folsom estimates his loss at $6000 in all. He had insurance of $2500 on the building and $1000 on the furniture. He has not yet fully decided but is of the opinion that he will rebuild. [In fact, he did not rebuild, but moved across the corner to the house at what is now 2 Plains Road, where he continued in the hotel business for a time after the fire.]\n\nMr. Williams had a stock of goods valued at about $10,000. He is at this time confined to his bed by illness and his exact loss cannot be determined. However, those familiar with his business estimate the amount of damage done in this store at $5,000, all of which is by smoke and water. It is understood that this loss is covered by insurance in several different companies.\n\nThe building in which the Williams store was located is owned by Mrs. Sarah A. Jackson and she lived in the upper story. Her goods were nearly all removed with little damage and the building was well insured.\n\nThis is the store building that was just to the west of the hotel, separated only by a driveway (as was, in a later time, Joe's Snack Bar, which Joe built in 1950 when his father, Joe, Sr., ran the store). This store, along with the former drug store just to the west, burned in April 1963.\n\nWhen the fire broke out, word was sent to Burlington asking for aid. A crew immediately left that city with a steamer. They came by team and made two changes of horses at Essex Junction and at Essex Center, arriving there a little after eleven. They would have reached here sooner but for the fact that they were stopped at Essex Center by a report that their services were not needed. Later they were ordered on and arrived here when the fire was under control. They used a stream for some time in wetting down the ruins and started for home a little after two o’clock.\n\nA great deal of bravery and persistence was exhibited by those who fought the flames and it is little short of a miracle that the fire was contained to comparatively narrow bounds. Several times the roofs of surrounding dwellings caught but men were always on hand with buckets of water and hand extinguishers.\n\nThe fire, which occurred here one year and a half ago, was just across the road at the south of today’s conflagration [as noted above, that fire actually happened on January 11, 1901, over three and one-half years before]. The property loss at that time was about twice the amount lost today and the two fires practically wipe out the business section of the village. It is a severe blow from which the village will not soon recover.”\n\nThis is the Pierce Block, built-in 1881 by W.N. Pierce from Jericho Center. It later became the Home Market and burned on January 11, 1901. This was across the street from the hotel, approximately where Mane Street Stylists are located today. On the left of the picture, you can see part of Rood's harness shop, the upstairs of which the Iron Hall rented as their meeting rooms. On the right is part of Joseph Bissonette's tin shop.\n\nI do have a bit more information about the Home Market and the Chesmore and post office blocks, should you ever want that (for example, it appears that Mrs. Sarah Jackson, mentioned in the Free Press article as living above the store, moved to an apartment above the post office, and was living there when that building burned. Talk about bad luck!\n\nGary\n\n==============================================\n\nEmailed Feedback from readers:"
