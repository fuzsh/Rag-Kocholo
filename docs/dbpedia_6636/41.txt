F. D. Reeve, who gave up an incipient acting career in his early 20s because he feared that immersing himself in dramatic characters might erode his own poetic voice, and who went on to write 10 volumes of highly regarded poetry, died on June 28 in Lebanon, N.H. He was 84.

The cause was complications of diabetes, said his wife, Laura C. Stevenson. He lived in Wilmington, Vt.

Mr. Reeve, the father of the actor Christopher Reeve, published more than 30 books, including translations of Russian authors. One book chronicled a trip to the Soviet Union in 1962 with Robert Frost on a good-will mission requested by President John F. Kennedy.

As he neared 40, Mr. Reeve gave up a tenured professorship in Russian language and literature at Wesleyan University to concentrate on writing. Christopher Reeve, who soared to stardom in the “Superman” movies, said he admired his father’s audacity in putting art ahead of academic and financial security.

“I may not do anything quite so dramatic with my life,” he told The Boston Globe in 1980. “Then again I may.”

Christopher Reeve died at 52 in 2004 after a horse-riding accident in 1995 had left him a quadriplegic.
