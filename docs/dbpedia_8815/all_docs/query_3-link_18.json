Today the station is leased by the Settle and Carlisle Railway Trust, and the site features a quaint shop, visitor centre and even holiday cottages, making Ribblehead the perfect base for exploring the stunningly atmospheric moors.\n\nThe popular town of Ribblehead makes the ideal base for exploring the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.
