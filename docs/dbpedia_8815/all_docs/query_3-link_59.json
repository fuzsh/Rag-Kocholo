        "text": "During the 1920s the sight of an airship in the skies above the East Anglian countryside wouldn’t have been an uncommon occurrence. The airship station at Pulham St.Mary had become operational during the First World War with the craft based there becoming affectionately known by the locals as the “Pulham Pigs”.\n\nI was still quite surprised, however, to come across a photograph of an airship last year whilst sorting through an album of images which were taken during a holiday on the Broads in 1931. My first thought was that this must have been one of the ships which were based at Pulham, but initial research quickly revealed that all UK airships were grounded after the R-101 had crashed in France with a loss of 48 lives during its maiden overseas voyage in October 1930. The shape of the craft seen in the photograph also hadn’t looked quite right to have been one of the British airships of the time and further research on the internet led me to believe that this was actually one of the German Zeppelins. Narrowing down the possibilities, and checking out the flight details of airships during 1931, the likeliest candidate turned out to be the Graf Zeppelin LZ-127 which was the most widely travelled passenger airship ever built. The LZ-127 made its inaugural flight on the 18th of September 1928 and, at 776 feet in length, was the largest airship to have been built up to that time. During its nine years of service it covered over one million miles, making 590 flights including many transatlantic passages, a round the world trip in 1929 and a scientific mission to the arctic in July 1931. On the 18th of August 1931 it landed at Hanworth Aerodrome, near London, attracting huge crowds on what was dubbed a goodwill mission – there is some fascinating footage of the LZ-127 flying over London and landing at Hanworth Air Park during that visit on the British Pathe website. It seems almost certain that the photograph in that 1931 holiday album captured the Graf Zeppelin over Broadland during that visit. The Graf Zeppelin returned to Hanworth Park in 1932 where it offered passenger flights around Britain at £40 per head which was a phenonenal amount of money back then! Despite having a perfect safety record, the LZ-127 was withdrawn from service in May 1937 following the Hindenburg disaster.\n\nTo many British citizens, the sight of a Zeppelin in the skies was still something to be feared and a set of postcards I have within the archives illustrate the reason why.\n\nThe Zeppelin airships had been developed by the German army officer Count Ferdinand Von Zeppelin who began experimenting with guidable balloons in the late 19th century. The first successful airship flight was conducted in July 1900 and from 1909 the Zeppelins were used for civilian passenger flights. With the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, the German army and navy saw the potential in Von Zeppelins airships for military use and they were initially draughted in to be used on spying missions beyond enemy lines. The Kaiser was reluctant to allow their use to attack the enemy, but finally agreed that British military installations could be targeted. He was keen to stress that residential areas and especially Royal residences were avoided – he was after all related to the British Royal family! On the morning of the 19th January 1915 three zeppelins, the L-3, L-4 and L-6, were launched from their base in Germany and began the long flight to Britain, armed with explosive bombs and incendiary devices. The L-6 encountered problems soon into its flight and had to return to base, leaving the L-3 and the L-4 to continue their mission alone. Their initial target had apparently been the dockyards of the Humber Estuary, but a combination of bad weather and poor navigational aids saw the airships being blown off course and encountering the coastline of Norfolk instead. The L-3 had arrived at Great Yarmouth and, considering it to be a legitimate target, began dropping its payload over the town. It is reported that the first bomb was dropped over the marshes near Ormesby, but at 8.20pm the second bomb heralded the start of the raid on Great Yarmouth as the L-3 made a steady course across the town from north to south.\n\nEight bombs were dropped in total, three of which failed to detonate, one landed at the Fish Wharf, and another on St. Peter’s Plain where there was a scene of utter devastation. Many buildings were heavily damaged and two people lost their lives here – 72 year old spinster Martha Taylor and 53 year old shoemaker Sam Smith. This was the very first air raid on Britain and it heralded a new era of warfare. The L-4 Zeppelin had continued north and at around 11pm began bombing Kings Lynn, killing a woman and child. In these pre-televisual days, natural human morbid curiosity was satiated by the postcards which were produced by local photographers who had captured the scenes of devastation. Over the next three years the eastern coastline of Britain and the Midlands area were to experience many more Zeppelin raids, and London also began to be targeted from May 1915 onwards. Initially the attacks came without warning and little could be done to stop the airships which flew too high for the military aircraft of the time to reach. As the war progressed the means to target and shoot down the Zeppelins developed rapidly, searchlights to spot the incoming airships were introduced and the German radio messages were intercepted so that the British military knew where the airships were heading. By the time of the last air raid in 1918 a good number of the Zeppelins had been successfully shot down and destroyed, others had been lost through accidents, but 557 British citizens had been killed and over 1300 more injured.\n\nMore information about the creation of the Zeppelins, the air raids on Britain during the First World War, and their further development as passenger airships during the 1920s and 1930s can be found on the Wikipedia website.\n\nThe family are now coming towards the end of their holiday on the Broads in June 1933 and this last post in the series covers the final days of that trip, accompanied by a few more stills which were taken from the cine film. To read the full scene by scene synopsis of the two films which the family shot in 1932 and 1933, go back to part one and then follow the links which can be found at the top or bottom of each post to take you through the rest.\n\nAfter stopping at Cantley, the family must have crossed back over Breydon Water as the next scene in the film shows them returning to Stokesby where they visit the riverside Provision Stores which stood to the left of The Ferry Inn as you look at it from the river. The building is now a private house but in 1933 the stores were run by Mr and Mrs Smith and their daughter Daisy. The father and youngest son are seen standing outside the store talking to what must have been the local village bobby who is seen with his police motorcycle and sidecar. The mystery female passenger who was seen earlier in the film is also present. The film then cuts to show Countess of Light at the farm moorings just downstream from the Ferry Inn, which can be seen in the background with a couple of motor cruisers moored in front. Also visible in the background is Stokesby Corn Mill which had actually ceased to be a working mill by this time. The tower, minus it’s cap, is rather derelict now but still stands in Mill Road at Stokesby. The family are filmed trooping up the gang plank onto Countess with provisions in hand.\n\nHaving moved on from Stokesby, the family are next seen seated at tables in a garden whilst mother pours tea. As the camera pans round you can see that this was taken in Horning …. I am not entirely sure of the exact location, but I wonder whether this might have been the White Gates Hotel? There is an old postcard of the hotel on this page of the Broadland Memories website which dates from a similar period to this film. The Then & Now pages of the archive also have a modern comparison shot which shows just how much the building has been altered over the years! 1930s Horning was famously the setting for two of the novelist Arthur Ransome’s much loved Swallows and Amazons series of books – “The Coot Club” and “The Big Six”. In fact Arthur Ransome supposedly stayed at the White Gates Hotel in the late 1930s whilst writing The Big Six. Still in Horning, mum and the two youngest children are then filmed walking across the green having obviously stocked up on provisions from one of the village stores. A large maltings building had stood on this site for many years, but this was demolished in the late 1920s and the green was created.\n\nThe two youngest children are tasked with the job of filling up the enamel water jugs from the pump which stood on the green. I haven’t actually seen a pump like this before, and it was presumably installed after the maltings were demolished so must have been quite new at the time this film was shot. Rather than pumping the water in the traditional way, this had a winding handle (I’m not sure of the correct technical term here!) which still seems to require quite a lot of effort to use, although the girl does appear to be doing a much better job when she takes over. Back on board, the youngest lad is seen fishing again and , as mentioned previously, this is the only filmed evidence of them having caught anything as an eel is hauled out of the water on the end of his line. The mother and daughter are seated in the wheelhouse reading books.\n\nBack on the river, the next section of the film shows the approach to Wroxham Bridge. Wroxham and Hoveton have seen some of the most dramatic changes in character and appearance over the years and, were it not for the familiar bridge, are sometimes almost unrecognisable in old photographs when compared to the scene we know today. As Countess of Light nears the bridge you can see the large, black building which was, I believe, a granary. Between it and the bridge was Sidney Stringers motorcycle and cycle shop. The Hotel Wroxham dominates the land on the right hand side now. As we’ve now come to expect, the passage beneath the bridge is filmed and you get a nice shot of A. Thrower’s hire yard on the other side.\n\nThe final scene is an almost identical shot to the one filmed on the Upper Bure during their holiday in 1932. One of the crew has been dropped off in the tender with the cine camera, somewhere between Wroxham and Belaugh, and films from the riverside as Countess of Light comes round the corner and passes. The rest of the family are posing on deck and it is one of those real “jolly boating” images which you automatically conjure up when thinking about boating holidays on the Broads in the 1920s and 1930s. Blake’s brochures were full of pictures of happy, smiling, waving folks posing on motor cruisers during this era and, no doubt, the promotional cine films which the company produced to advertise Broadland boating holidays at this time also featured similarly staged scenes. The camera pans round and films Countess heading off upriver and the screen goes dark …. which seems to be a fitting end to the film!\n\nWhether the family ever returned to the Broads and what became of them I don’t know, but at least two of the boys, if not all three, would almost certainly have been called up to fight during the Second World War. It’s a very sobering thought. I am hoping that an appeal for information on them will be appearing in one of the Yorkshire regional newspapers and that it may lead to their identity being discovered, but after 80 years I fear the possibility is somewhat remote …… although I still live in hope!\n\nHaving spent a couple of days at Oulton Broad where they hired some rather nice wooden motor launches and visited the seafront at Lowestoft, the end of the previous post saw the family casting off from the Yacht Station to continue their holiday on the Broads in June 1933.\n\nThe next section of the film shows them heading upstream on the Waveney and the first scene we see is of St. Mary’s Church at Burgh St. Peter as they pass. It is quite a different scene to that which we see today as the church was then highly visible from the river. This is one of the very dramatic differences seen in some of the landscape on the southern rivers in this film – areas that are now quite heavily tree lined were very open and stark. Much of this was as a result of the deliberate cutting down and clearance of trees to allow the maximum amount of wind possible to reach the sails of the wherries which once plied their trade up and down the rivers …. too many trees would obviously hamper their progress! The distinctive, tiered tower of St. Mary’s Church was clad with ivy at the time this film was shot and must have been quite an impressive sight from the river, dominating the landscape as it did. It’s a fascinating little church and we spent a few hours wandering around looking at some of the gravestones last year. The great age to which some of the past inhabitants, several of whom were wherryman, lived in the late 1800s was remarkable really … proof that Broadland air must be good for you! The main body of the church is medieval, but by the late 1700s the tower had fallen into disrepair. The local Lord of the Manor, Samuel Boycott, was granted permission to build a new tower which was reputedly based on a church which his son had seen in Italy whilst on a grand tour. Boycott apparently thought it would be a fitting mausoleum for family burials within the church.\n\nThe film cuts to more scenes of the family as they cruise along. It’s obviously a hot and sunny day as sun lotion of some sort is being liberally applied to one of the son’s ears! The next scene shows the dad and three children rowing in the tender. It took me a while to work out that this was actually filmed at Geldeston Lock as there is very little background seen. Knowing that they have just travelled up the Waveney, and that the following scenes show them cruising back through Beccles, Geldeston must be the obvious location really, and what you can see in the clip does fit with this. They appear to be rowing out of the cut which now leads to the BA 24 hour moorings and would have led directly to the lock itself back then. They have just reached the corner of the island where the channel splits and leads off up to the footbridge today but, when the lock was still operational, led to a sluice. In 1933 the lock was still working …. just! How navigable the river beyond it was by this time, I don’t know, as use of the Bungay navigation had been in severe decline and it was actually closed the year after this film was shot. Sadly there is no footage of the lock itself or of the inn and there is no evidence of the family having travelled any further up the Waveney.\n\nBack on the river aboard Countess of Light, they are now seen cruising through Beccles and we encounter one of the lost railway bridges of Broadland as they approach, and then pass beneath, the old fixed rail bridge which crossed the river a little way upstream from the road bridge. This was part of the Waveney Valley line which ran between Beccles and Tivetshall where it then connected with the main London to Norwich line – there were stations at Geldeston, Harleston and Pulham along the way. It was originally intended to run from Beccles to Diss, but the terminus was eventually moved slightly further north, although I haven’t been able to establish why this was as yet. The line opened in 1863 and later became part of the Great Eastern Railway Company who’s initials can be seen on what remains of one of the bridge supports at the side of the river, the other support (on the Beccles side) has since had a house built on it. I believe that passenger services ceased around 1953 although I have read that freight continued to use the line up until the bridge was demolished c1966.\n\nThe family are following another small motor cruiser as they pass beneath the bridge and there are various boats and houseboats seen moored to the side. The film cuts to see them approaching the old road bridge and it’s interesting to see people bathing in the river there, climbing out via a ladder which is attached to the quayside. Once again, the passage beneath is filmed, whilst a couple of people standing on the bridge watch on, and it’s definatelyt another “duck” moment as the camera rolls until the last second! I am not entirely sure what the large building seen beyond the bridge to the right was … possibly a warehouse of some sort? Further along the Waveney they encounter what appears to be a Thames barge travelling in the opposite direction, the cameraman looks behind to continue filming it once it has passed and you can see that they are only a short way out of Beccles. The barge is presumably under engine power as the sails are down.\n\nThe cameraman does appear to have been extremely interested in the Broadland bridges, which makes me wonder whether he possibly had some sort of engineering background as he filmed so many of those which they encountered during their holidays. The next scene was presumably shot on the Waveney somewhere between Beccles and Haddiscoe and shows a very nice little sailing boat with an unusual sail arrangement. My knowledge of sailing craft is extremely limited so I have absolutely no idea whether this is a half decker or something else. There don’t appear to be any markings on the sails which might give me some clues …. any help with identifying this would be very welcome!\n\nMoving on, the camera now captures footage of yet another long lost bridge as they film their passage beneath the old Haddiscoe lifting bridge which crossed the New Cut slightly south of where the current road bridge runs. My notes on the history of this particular bridge are a little patchy at the moment but it was apparently built as a toll bridge and a fee was collected for passing over it or beneath it. In the 1930s the toll was two shillings which you dropped into a bag which was held out on a long poll as you passed – sadly this transaction wasn’t caught on camera as they are quite close to the bridge itself when the filming begins. It really was a rickety looking old thing! I believe that the new road bridge was built c1960. Once through, the cameraman looks back towards the bridge and you can clearly see the Haddiscoe High Level rail swing bridge in the background. The piers on which the rail bridge once stood are a familiar obstacle in the middle of the river now, but it was once part of the line which carried trains between Beccles and Great Yarmouth, crossing the Waveney at Aldeby (where further piers still remain in situ in the river) and then back over at Haddiscoe before heading in to Yarmouth. This particular line closed to passengers in 1959, although I believe part of it continued to be used by freight trains during the sugar beet season until the two swing bridges were finally demolished in the latter half of the 1960s.\n\nThere is a little more footage of the wash hitting the piling along the the New Cut, and the dinghy being towed behind them as they cruise along. As they reach Reedham, the swing bridge is closing as they approach and we see the youngest son sitting on the bow. Sadly, there is no further footage of Reedham, which is a real shame! The next section of the film is quite intriguing as it is obviously shot inside a Broadland inn and shows the two youngest children standing next to a pianola. The boy is waving his arms in time to the music and pretending to play a trombone. He then winds it up again using the handle at the side and both children do some more conducting along to the music.\n\nI can only assume that this was in fact taken inside the Red House at Cantley as the next shot shows Countess of Light moored directly in front of the pub. The walls are almost completely covered by climbing plants but the building is very distinctive and easily recognisable. This seems to have been filmed from the tender once again, the rest of the family are sitting on the coach roof and one of the boys is fishing. Cantley had been an extremely popular sailing center and fishing resort during Victorian and Edwardian times, before the sugar beet factory was built in 1912, and the Red House was a well frequented inn. The name was changed to the Reedcutters in 2004. The next post will cover the last part of their holiday when the family have returned to the northern rivers, stopping at Stokesby once again before heading to Horning, Wroxham and the Upper Bure beyond.\n\nPart 5 in the series of posts on the 1930s cine films which I am currently working on covered the family travelling to Norfolk from Leeds, stopping off en-route for a roadside picnic, and then having afternoon tea at The Bridge Hotel before picking up Countess Of Light from Herbert Woods boatyard at Potter Heigham in June 1933.\n\nHaving spent their first night moored at Stokesby, the family now head off towards Great Yarmouth. There is no actual footage of the passage there, but the next scene shows their approach to the Breydon Rail Viaduct as they exit the River Bure, the camera panning round to show the sheer scale of this magnificent structure. This was an incredible piece of engineering, opening in 1903 as part of the Midland and Great Northern line at a cost of around £38,000. The bridge connected the M&GN line’s Beach Station in Great Yarmouth to the Great Eastern Railway’s Southtown Station at Gorleston. It was 800 feet in length and had a central swinging section which pivoted round on a pier, giving two 60 ft channels either side to allow river traffic to pass. It could apparently take up to ten minutes to open fully depending on the prevailing weather conditions! The film cuts to show this central section having already swung open as the family pass through. The bridge was closed in 1953 when it was thought that it might need costly repairs but remained in situ until 1963 when it was finally demolished and sold for scrap. Once on the other side the cameraman looks back towards the viaduct, giving us another fantastic view of it stretching across Breydon. It’s obviously a slightly chilly day as all those onboard seem to be wrapped up in coats and blankets! They also have an extra passenger onboard as there is a previously unseen lady seated with the mum on the aft cabin roof. I wonder whether they had friends or family who lived in the area?\n\nThere follows quite a nice section of film of the Breydon crossing. The first shot shows a yacht tacking behind them between the marker posts, the distinctive tower of St. Nicholas’ Church at Great Yarmouth can be seen in the background A coaster then passes them – having taken a still from the film, I have identified it as being “Assiduity” which was one of the fleet of coasters built by F.T. Everard and Sons of Greenhithe in Kent. The company had been founded in 1880 and their coasters were a familiar sight on the River Yare and at Great Yarmouth over the years, instantly recognisable because all of their ships had a name which ended in “ity”. The cameraman turns round to film it disappearing and another motor cruiser is seen following it. Having crossed Breydon, the film now cuts to show a sunny scene as the family continue cruising on what I presume must be the lower Waveney between Breydon and St. Olaves. There is then a brief shot of two of the boys rowing the tender back to Countess of Light which is moored on a riverbank at an unknown location. Unfortunately, there is just not enough background visible to be able to identify it, but I can only assume that it must have been on the River Waveney somewhere between St. Olaves and Oulton Broad. There is a little more footage taken inside Countess where mum appears to be preparing food whilst the youngest children look on … this may possibly be a lunch stop!\n\nThe next scene shows Countess of Light moored at Oulton Broad in front of the gates which stand at the entrance to Nicholas Everitt Park. The land here had been gifted to Lowestoft by Howard Hollingsworth in the late 1920s to be used in perpetuity as a public park after he had purchased it as part of the estate of his good friend Nicholas Everitt following his death in 1928. One of the boys is seen swabbing down the decks before the camera pans round to show a very busy Yacht Station. Whilst there, the family obviously decided to hire a couple of rather smart motor launches as there is quite a nice section of footage showing them bombing around the broad. Presumably there were either no speed restrictions at this time or, if there were, then they weren’t sticking to them! The first launch is helmed by the father who has the youngest child accompanying him. The registration number of the launch is W63 which was identified for me by Clive Richardson as being called “Vivo”. The second launch has the other two sons in it and has a registration number of either W381, or W387 and, once gain with thanks to Clive, this was “Miss Anne” – both launches were part of his father’s fleet at Oulton Broad, before the company moved to their present site at Stalham.\n\nBoth launches had been built by Jimmy Fletcher at Commodore Road in the very early 1930s, “Miss Anne” was a Brooke Marine kit which was fitted with one of their Dominion motors – Jimmy Fletcher had previously been a foreman at the Brooke’s yard. “Vivo” was apparently once run over and sunk by an MTB which belonged to the Yarmouth bookmaker Toby Sutton! There is some great footage of the broad itself as they race round it – the old maltings buildings can be seen, as well as Commodore Road with the railway line in the background. The father appears to be filming much of this from his launch and the boys are having a great time! The two lads have then picked up mum and their female passenger who are both seen seated in the back as the launch passes the camera once again.\n\nThis may have been another overnight stop as in the next scene the family are shown on the seafront at Lowestoft, approaching Claremont Pier – Lowestoft’s South Pier can be seen in the background. They are filmed walking past the “Claremont Snaps” stall and are then seen standing on the promenade with the pier and it’s pavilion in the background, the rifle range which stood at the entrance is on the left. Claremont Pier was opened in 1903 and had been built by the Coast Development Company who owned the “Belle” passenger steamers. Between 1898 and 1903 they built piers at Southwold, Felixstowe and Lowestoft, primarily as landing stages for their steamers which regularly travelled up and down the east coast from London. In 1912, the pier was extended and revamped and the grand pavilion building which is seen in the still above was erected. The steamer services were stopped with the outbreak of war in 1939 and the army took over the pier, removing a large section of the decking to scupper any chances of it being used as a landing stage by the enemy in the event of an invasion. After the war, the army continued to use the pier and it’s buildings as a training centre, finally handing it back in 1948 by which time it was in a rather derelict state. The pier was bought by the actor George Studd who carried out the necessary repairs and had a new pavilion building built. Although the pavilion was once again renovated in the 1980s, the pier beyond it was left and is now, sadly, in a serious state of disrepair and closed to the public.\n\nWe then see the family arriving back at the Yacht Station, Countess of Light has moved further up and is now moored near to the top end. Leo Robinson’s stores can clearly be seen in the background as the family walk towards the boat and climb onboard. Leo Robinson operated a large fleet at Oulton Broad, building many fine motor cruisers there, and also ran the yachting and general provisions stores on Bridge Road, as can be seen in the background of the still on the right. The stores were later taken over by Robert Waller who continued to offer provisions to visiting boaters from the premises which incorporated a large restaurant and tearooms overlooking the broad. The building now houses a wine bar, a kebab shop and an Indian restaurant. In the next scene the two youngest sons have taken to the dinghy once more and are filmed rowing around in the area between the spot where Countess is moored and the old public jetty.\n\nThere is a little more footage of Oulton Broad Yacht Station as the father films Countess of Light from the jetty as she moves off and cruises towards him, giving some great views of the boat itself. The rest of the family are on deck with the eldest son at the helm. The background is quite busy with people and boats and, as Countess swings round and passes, you can see a large number of rowing dinghies moored up and awaiting hire. You can also see the building which now houses Jeckell’s, but in 1933 was the home of Jack Robinson’s Yachting Agency. Jack was the younger brother of Leo Robinson and he had set up his own boatyard on Oulton Broad during the early 1920s. He had also started the Broadland Yachting Association with John Jenner which was a rival agency to Harry Blake’s. Along with representing several other boatyards, Jack’s “Ashore or Afloat” brochures also contained the details of holiday bungalows which were available to hire at various locations around the Broads.\n\nIn the next post, the film continues as the family travel to Geldeston and then back along the Waveney through Beccles, beneath the bridges at Haddiscoe and Reedham, before mooring up at Cantley.\n\nI am starting to make my way through the second cine film from the early 1930s which follows a family holiday onboard the Herbert Woods motor cruiser “Countess Of Light” taken in early June 1933. The previous four posts featured stills from their holiday on the Norfolk Broads in May 1932 when they had covered a large part of the northern rivers, visiting Horning, Coltishall, Horsey and Irstead along the way.\n\nThe 1933 film begins in much the same manner as the first, with the family seen leaving their home in the Morris Major saloon. As previously mentioned, it is believed that the family hailed from the Leeds area and the journey to Norfolk is likely to have taken them at least six hours to complete. The first section of the film shows them stopping off en-route for a picnic and it soon becomes evident that there is another family member in tow this year – a young girl of around 10 or 12. Why she hadn’t come to the Broads in the previous year is a mystery … maybe she hadn’t fancied the idea, or maybe the parents were unsure whether a boating holiday would be suitable. Sadly, we are unlikely to find out. Mum is seen standing at the back of the car buttering bread whilst the two youngest children go off and explore the surrounding area which, I assume, must be a farm track. The next scene is presumably yet another stop as the car is now parked at the side of a road with the family seen sitting on the verge munching on sandwiches! Looking at the probable route they would have taken from Leeds, this may have been filmed in the Lincolnshire area.\n\nThe film then cuts to more scenes of eating and drinking, but this time it is inside what I believe to be the Bridge Hotel at Potter Heigham. The family are seated at a table next to windows through which you can see the river and collection of boatsheds which look remarkably like those which stood at Potter Heigham at this time. Also, as mentioned in an earlier post, the interior looks identical to a scene in the first film where the family had stopped off for a meal on the way back from Horsey. No doubt they had decided to have afternoon tea before going round to Herbert Woods to pick up their boat, which would have had a takeover time of 3pm in the 1930s. One thing that is noticeable throughout this years holiday is that the mum is looking incredibly elegant and extremely fashionable, and where the youngest lad had seemingly been stuck in his school uniform for the last trip, the clothing regulations appear to have been relaxed a little in 1933.\n\nWe then see the family having arrived at the Broads Haven yard, mother and daughter are filmed walking away from the car to the boat where the rest of the family are waiting…. there are some lovely old cars parked in front of the sheds in the background! This year, they have gone for a much larger cruiser – “Countess Of Light” which bears the registration number B64. This has proved to be a bit of a mystery as Craig’s wonderful Boats of the Norfolk Broads database had the entry for B64 as being Prince Of Light which until recently was still to be found on the Broads, although I believe she has now been sold and moved to a different waterway. Countess Of Light was thought to have been either destroyed or moved away from the Broads before this film was shot, but obviously this wasn’t the case given the evidence we have here. Study of the Blakes brochures from the 1930s shows that Countess Of Light was listed in the 1933 and 1935 editions, but there was no Prince Of Light listed in either. By 1939 there was no Countess but Prince had appeared … so was she just actually renamed? If anyone can shed any light (no pun intended!) on this then please do get in touch.\n\nCountess of Light was 42 feet in length with an 11 ft beam and was the largest of the Light cruisers. In 1933 she was listed as being one of the three “Duchess Of Light” class, Empress Of Light being the third. These 8-berth cruisers slept two in the aft cabin which had an adjoining toilet and washbasin, two in the forward cabin, whilst the seating in the saloon made up into a further two double berths. There was another toilet compartment next to the forward cabin and opposite that was a fully fitted out bathroom. This was quite a rarity as there were only a handful of the larger motor cruisers which came fitted with a bath, although they had commonly been found on pleasure wherries in the past. Between the bathroom and the saloon was the galley which ran the full width of the boat; “so that cooking and preparation of meals is done in real comfort“. The brochure entry went on to say; “Special features are a sunshine roof over saloon, plate glass adjustable and removable windows, sliding scuttles, double sideboards, serving hatches, full length side decks, and folding canopy while the boat is fitted throughout thoroughly and tastefully in the usual style of the ‘Light’ cruisers“. The price of a week’s hire in June 1933 would have been £17 and it certainly sounds as though she was the height of luxury in motor cruisers at that time!\n\nThe film then moves to show the family moored by the riverside at what is believed to be Stokesby. Two of the boys are seen fishing from the dinghy behind Countess, whilst the daughter is seated on the coachroof with a rod in hand. Given that this was filmed in early June, I wondered whether there had actually been a Close Season for fishing at this time. Blakes held an annual angling competition during the 1930s and in 1933 there were prizes of £2 and 2 shillings for the heaviest roach, rudd, perch, bream and jack caught during the year. The 1933 brochure mentioned that there had in fact been a Close Season on the Broads since around 1912 but, interestingly, this was suspended during the Bank Holiday weekends of Easter and Whitsun, a practice which it seems continued until at least the outbreak of the Second World War. The family did seem to have indulged in quite a bit of fishing this year, although it has to be said that the only evidence of them catching anything was film of an eel on the end of a line! The still above, right shows the next scene where the family are seated at the saloon table eating a meal – this really gives a good indication of how well the boat was fitted out as we see the blue and white, willow patterned “Yuan” ware which all of the light cruisers were equipped with. Mrs Woods ensured that only utensils and crockery of good quality were used on board the Light cruisers and, apparently, even the cutlery was engraved with “H. Woods for Boats“.\n\nMy guess is that this was the first nights destination and it may well have been breakfast that they were eating in the previous scene. The next section of the film shows them all on the green at Stokesby where they are seen using the old village handpump. We tend to take it for granted these days that we can just pop into a boatyard, or pull up at a quay, and fill up with fresh water from one of the many blue hoses which can be found around the Broads, but it seems to have been much more of an effort back in the 1930s! I have seen a few old photographs of various handpumps which were situated near to the riverside in Broadland villages and the family are seen filling up at another one later in the film. The Light cruisers came equipped with large enamel jugs which were used to transport the water back to the boats – as mentioned previously, the fresh water tank was situated right in the bow. I’m not sure how large the water tank was, but it must have taken a few trips, or required very regular fills to keep it topped up in this manner, but I guess that it was all part of the adventure! Having filled up their jugs, the family are then filmed as they walk back across the green, as can be seen in the still above, left – the handpump was located behind the white picket fence seen in the background.\n\nBack onboard, they are getting ready to cast off from the moorings at Stokesby as what is probably the most famous of the Broadland passenger steamers passes. The Queen Of The Broads was built by Critton’s yard at Cobholm in Great Yarmouth in 1889, her sister ship The Pride Of The Yare was launched in 1892. Both were owned by the Yarmouth and Gorleston Steamship Company and the Queen Of The Broads operated daily trips between Great Yarmouth and Wroxham, carrying up to 180 passengers at a time, whilst her sister ship ran similar trips on the southern rivers. The Pride Of The Yare was later sold and was moved to the River Trent in Nottingham but the Queen Of The Broads continued to operate on the Broads until 1976 when she was withdrawn and broken up. She was replaced by a brand new, deisel engined “Queen Of The Broads” in 1977.\n\nIn the next post, the family cross Breydon Water and head down to Oulton Broad before continuing along the Waveney to Geldeston!\n\nHaving covered a large part of the northern rivers during the week, the family are now reaching the end of their 1932 holiday onboard “Spark Of Light” and decide to head down the Bure to Great Yarmouth for a day at the seaside. There is a little footage of their passage along the Bure en-route.\n\nThe riverside area of the Bure at Great Yarmouth does not the have the most inviting of images these days, which does little to encourage a stop-over, but the yacht station still continues to attract many boaters during the summer months who wish to enjoy all that the seaside town has to offer. In the 1930s a visit to the seaside would have been a must on a family boating holiday on the Broads! In the first still, the family are seen on the seafront at The Prince’s Tea Saloon where ice creams have obviously been purchased for the children. Like many other seaside towns around the UK, the resort had become a popular as a destination for day trips and holidays during the Victorian era when the coming of the railways had provided an easy means of travel around a vast network of rail lines which spread across Britain. The large passenger steamers which plied their trade up and down the south east coast brought in yet more visitors. The seafront had seen mass development during the latter half of the 19th century with buildings for both accommodation and entertainment springing up along Marine Parade. Wellington Pier had been opened in 1854 and was joined just a few years later by the Britannia Pier. Initially, it was the wealthier members of society who been encouraged to visit these resorts, but the Bank Holidays act of 1871 meant that the middle and lower classes had also found themselves with the time and opportunity to spend a day out at the seaside, and Great Yarmouth continued to change to meet their needs too. Attractions such as the Aquarium, the magnificent revolving tower and the slot machines and rifle ranges of the Jubilee Exhibition (an early amusement arcade really) were all opened in the latter decades of the 19th century.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century further attractions arrived in the form of the Scenic Railway and an accompanying small fun fair (the forerunner to the Pleasure Beach), the Hippodrome Circus opened in 1903 and the Winter Gardens, where dances and concerts were held, in 1904. Dancing was hugely popular during the inter-war years with many Broadland villages and towns holding regular events throughout the week in hotels, halls and pavilions. By the late 1920s, the Pleasure Beach was well established, the Venetian Waterways and boating lakes and the Great Yarmouth racecourse had also opened, so there would have been plenty to occupy the family in 1932! The next section of the film shows the youngest child approaching the camera in a small pony and trap – this looks to have been taken on Marine Parade. There are several other people walking around in the background and a lovely old bus passes at one point. The pony is initially being led by a young lad who lets go as they approach the camera and go past.\n\nWe are then back onboard “Spark Of Light” as they make their return passage along the Bure. The first scenes show the family eating lunch as they cruise along. We are soon at Acle where the father films the road bridge as they approach. This bridge was actually quite new at the time. As can be seen in some of the older photos and postcards on Broadland Memories, the Bure at Acle had been straddled by a stunning medieval, three arched stone bridge. This had been replaced in 1931 by the structure seen in the still on the left. I’ve actually got quite an interesting photo of this under construction somewhere within my archives, and may well post it on here at a later date. Whilst not as aesthetically pleasing as the medieval bridge had been, this 1930s effort was certainly a lot more attractive than the current road bridge which was installed around 1996.\n\nThe film now cuts to see them approaching the entrance to the Broads Haven yard at Potter Heigham, the camera continues to roll as they swing round and pass beneath the footbridge to enter the mooring basin. The Broads Haven yard had opened in 1931 so was still in its infancy when this film was shot. Herbert Woods had submitted plans for the new mooring basin and associated buildings which had been approved in 1929. Work had begun on digging out the 2 acre basin and constructing boatsheds, workshops, garaging for clients cars and other ancillary buildings soon afterwards, the work being completed in 1931. The basins were actually dug out by hand and some 60, 000 tons of clay were removed in the process, this being used to build up the surrounding land on which the workshops etc. were constructed. The total length of the quay heading installed was around 1800 feet. The use of the term “Pioneer” in relation to Herbert Woods is extremely apt as his development of Broads Haven became the model for the modern hire fleets.\n\nAlthough still part of Harry Blakes agency, Herbert also started producing his own “Jolliday’s” boating brochure at this time, copies of which are now highly sought after by collectors! The next scene shows Spark Of Light, along with another of the boats in Herbert Woods fleet, moored outside the large sheds. I suspect that this was in fact the last night of their holiday, the family having decided to return to the yard ready for the early start they would need in the morning to make the long journey back to Leeds. Filmed from the other side of the basin, we see the mother and two of the children get into the tender and start to row across the water towards the cameraman.\n\nWe see some nice shots of the basin as they row round and you get a real sense of the scale of the project which Herbert had undertaken to create this facility for his fleet. The building up of the fleet and the development of new motor cruisers had continued apace whilst construction on the yard had been going on. The 1933 edition of Blakes boating brochure listed a total of 31 “Light” cruisers available for hire – three in the 8-berth “Duchess” class, twelve of the 6-berth “Beam” class (which included Spark), eight of the 4-berth “Western” class and eight of the 3-berth “Delights”. The names of the classes seemed to have been jigged round and changed over the years, but the fleet continued to grow and by the outbreak of war in 1939 Herbert had 48 “Light” cruisers listed in seven different classes, along with his fleet of “Lady” yachts which had been built at Broads Haven from the mid 1930s onwards. The wartime activities of the yard are also a fascinating read if you can pick up a copy of the Jennifer Woods book which I mentioned in a previous post.\n\nThere is some more nice footage of Herberts fleet and the yard as the cameraman continues to film the mooring basin. One dominant feature which is missing from the skyline is the famous Woods tower. This was built as part of the second phase of construction and development at Broads Haven which begun around 1934. The tower housed a large water tank which provided a reliable source of fresh water for his fleet, and also a reception area, offices, store rooms and a third floor flat. At the same time, Herbert had a large general stores built at the entrance to the yard which was stocked with everything that the holidymaker could possibly need for their week afloat. An advert in Blakes 1935 brochure called it “The most modern store in Broadland“, and Broads Haven “The Complete Yacht Station” where moorings and water were free!\n\nAs the camera pans round for the last time, we see the mother sitting beside Spark Of Light before it cuts to the last scene from the family’s 1932 holiday where we see mum adjusting the youngest sons shorts and making sure his shirt is tucked in. The fact that the poor lad seems to have been stuck in what looked like his school uniform for virtually the entire holiday illustrates just how formal life could be back then! Not only should children be seen and not heard, but young boys didn’t get to wear long trousers until they reached a certain age – no matter what the weather was like! It is clear from these films that they were a very “proper” middle class family and I would dearly love to find out more about them.\n\nThat brings us to the end of the first film. In the next post I will move on to the start of their second holiday on the Broads in June 1933 when they returned to Herbert Woods at Potter Heigham, with another family member in tow, to hire a larger motor cruiser in which they head south across Breydon Water!\n\nIn part one and part two of the series of posts on the 1930s cine film we saw our family travelling from Leeds to Herbert Woods Broads Haven yard at Potter Heigham to pick up “Spark Of Light” for a week’s holiday in May 1932. The first couple of days were spent on the Upper Bure where the family visited Coltishall and Horning but we now move on to what is probably some of the most fascinating footage from their 1932 holiday as they cruise up the River Ant.\n\nThe first shot we see is of open countryside, but then the camera pans round to show the sails of two windpumps turning in the distance as the family head upstream on the River Ant towards Ludham Bridge. The sails we see belong to what is either a hollow post or trestle mill which stood just below the bridge and the magnificent Beaumont’s Mill. Also known as Ludham Bridge South Mill, it is now referred to as Beaumont’s Mill as the last keeper in the latter years of operation was Charles Beaumont who worked there from around 1916 to 1937. Quite a few of the Broadland Drainage pumps became known by the name of the marshmen who looked after them! Sadly, the mill was demolished in the early 1960s but you can find more information and photographs of it on the wonderful Norfolk Mills website – there are also several old photographs and postcards which feature Beaumont’s Mill on the main Broadland Memories website.\n\nWhen I first got to watch the film, it was just so exciting to see what is such a familiar landscape but with one of the long lost drainage mills still in working order. In the 1800s there were apparently 240 drainage mills dotted around the Broads- of those, there are just 74 remaining most of which are now derelict. It’s sad to think that so much of this heritage has been lost or now lies in a severe state of neglect. Once a vital part of the rural economy, the pumps drained the surrounding marshes so that cattle could be grazed all year round – the animals were often tended to by the same marshman who looked after the nearby mill amongst his other duties. The mother of the family is then seen sitting on the coach roof, ducking as they pass beneath Ludham Bridge as the family continue to head upstream. The bridge seen was erected in 1915 and replaced the medieval single arched stone bridge which had long been a serious hazard to navigation, with many vessels being unable to pass through, it was often referred to as the “bung hole”. As road traffic increased during the middle of the 20th century yet another new bridge was needed, and the concrete structure you see today was installed in the early 1960s.\n\nThe photographer then captures footage of yet another drainage mill with its sails turning – I was unable to put a name to this, so must give thanks to Alison Yardy who instantly recognised it as being the small, brick tower mill which stood at Irstead. This is yet another mill which is no longer with us. As they approach, a sailing cruiser tacks across the river in front of them. The scene then changes to show the youngest son who is in the aft cabin of Spark, filmed through the doors leading from the wheelhouse. It cuts to show him popping his head up through the forward hatch in the coach roof before showing some more general footage of their passage up the Ant. I’m not quite sure how far they travelled as there are no real discernible landmarks to be seen, but they pass a few smaller craft on the river and may actually have turned round at Irstead to head back.\n\nCertainly, by the next scene, they are on their way back down the Ant as we come across yet another operational drainage mill – once again, my thanks to Alison who informed me that this is actually Neave’s Mill, the tower and cap of which still stand on the banks of the Ant a short distance above Ludham Bridge. What threw me in the still you can see was the building which stands behind it – this apparently housed an auxiliary engine for the mill and the concrete base on which it stood can still be found on the site. Back at Ludham Bridge, the cameraman has been dropped off and films “Spark Of Light” as she passes beneath the bridge – the remains of the mill tower which still stands to the north of the bridge can be seen in the background. It was already derelict by this time and, a few years later, was converted for use as a pill box during World War Two with an anti-tank mortar emplacement outside. During the war, the bridge itself was fitted with chambers which were designed to house explosives which would have been detonated to destroy the bridge in the event of an enemy invasion – these chambers could apparently still be seen up until the bridge was demolished.\n\nSpark then pulls in to a little cut below Beaumont’s Mill, presumably to pick up the father who has been filming them from the riverbank. It’s interesting to see that a quant pole was obviously supplied with Spark as they use it to fend off from the bank. Continuing downstream on the Ant, the family then encounter a reed lighter, piled several feet high with what was presumably marsh hay, being rowed at a fair old rate by two men. It is quite fascinating to witness part of the local rural life which would have once been an extremely common site, but must have been a dying tradition by this time. The next scene shows the family in the wheelhouse as they cruise along – there is a mill turning in the background and I think this may actually have been shot on the Thurne as the river just looks to wide too have been the lower Ant. The Mill may have been either Coldharbour or Horsefen, but it just too distant to be able to identify it properly.\n\nThe reasons that I believe it to be the Thurne become clear when we move to the next section of the film, as the family are seen cruising back into Potter Heigham and past the familiar landmark of “Dutch Tutch”. This unusual building began life as a helter skelter which stood at the entrance to Britannia Pier in Great Yarmouth. After the disastrous fire which swept through the pier and pavilion in December 1909, the helter skelter was dismantled and sections of it were transported to Potter Heigham where it was converted for use as a holiday home. You can read more about Dutch Tutch and the fire in this earlier blog entry. The camera pans round and you see a few more of the riverside bungalows, with moored boats, as they approach the bridge. As previously mentioned, Potter Heigham was another area which had seen a mass of riverside development as bungalows were erected during the early years of the 20th century. A detailed history of these can be found in the excellent book, “A History of the River Thurne Bungalows” by Di Cornell, copies of which can usually be found on sale at the newsagents stand in Lathams. The appearance of so many of these riverside dwellings wasn’t welcomed by all and in 1950 the author J.Wentwoth Day famously described the Thurne development as “bungaloid slum” much to the disgust of the local residents!\n\nIn the next scene the family are almost upon the old road bridge and you get a brief glimpse of George Applegates boatyard on the left, and the Bridge Hotel on the right as they approach the central arch. The camera keeps rolling as they get closer …. and closer … and closer …. it doesn’t matter how many times I have seen this film now, I just still want to shout DUCK!!!!! The film then cuts to the other side of the bridge, in fact they have just passed beneath the old rail bridge and are looking back towards both bridges, the old boatsheds which stood on the right hand side are clearly visible. The rail bridge was originally built as part of the Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway line which had opened in 1877. The line initially carried passengers from Yarmouth Beach station to Martham, but by 1880 had been extended across the River Thurne at Potter Heigham to take passengers on up to North Walsham and Stalham. In 1893 it became part of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The line was closed in 1959, the bridge being demolished in 1969 to make way for the new road bridge which carries the A149. In the early 1960s the loads being put onto the old medieval road bridge by the increasing levels of traffic were a cause for concern and the County Council had meetings with its surveyors to discuss plans for a new road bridge at Potter Heigham. The discussions included proposals to dismantle the medieval bridge and replace it with a more modern structure but eventually, as we know, the new road bridge was constructed on the line which had carried the M&GN railway.\n\nThere is a brief shot of further cruising on the Upper Thurne above Potter Heigham before the film cuts to show two farmworkers who appear to be pushing rotary hoes in a field. If they were having to hoe the entire field like this then it must have taken quite some time and been back-breaking work! I think that this may have been taken at Horsey as the following scenes show the family walking past a junction for the B1159 to Palling and Stalham, before cutting back to “Spark Of Light” moored in what looks like Horsey Dyke. Even at this time, Horsey Dyke was mentioned as being one of the few moorings at which you would have to pay a fee along with the Yachting Stations at Great Yarmouth and Oulton Broad, and Barton, Salhouse and Wroxham Broads. Blakes brochures made great emphasis of the fact that there could be very little extra expense involved above the cost of hiring your craft when cruising on the Broads. They estimated that the average cost of provisions for a week “including meat, minerals, beer, etc., etc.” was around £1 and 10 shillings per person although it warns to allow for any “private” expenditure, but continues; “It is only when the craft puts into Yarmouth or Norwich, that it is possible to spend.”\n\nHeading back down the Thurne from Horsey, the family are seen towing a sailing cruiser behind them – towing was actually prohibited by hire craft then, as it is today. It is actually quite a comical scene though as one of the yachts crew is seen standing on the bow for a lengthy period in what can only be described as a very Leonard Rossitter in full “Rigsby” pose! There follows some more general footage of the Upper Thurne with a few sailing cruisers seen and another passing motor cruiser. We see another mill with sails turning in the distance – this could possibly be Martham or High’s Mill at Potter Heigham.\n\nThe film moves on to some interior shots of the family taking afternoon tea or lunch at a hotel – I think this may actually be the Bridge Hotel at Potter Heigham. In 1933 they start their week with a meal at the hotel, and the interior seems to be identical to that seen in this piece of footage. Blakes give the average cost of a meal at an inn as being around 3 shillings and sixpence a head. There were several inns and hotels advertising the availability of lunches and meals around Broadland, and the home baked pies from “Willow” at Potter Heigham came highly recommended! An advert for Willow mentions that their provisions boat visited the moorings at Potter Heigham twice daily, called at Ranworth and South Walsham Dykes on Thursday afternoons, and attended all the Regattas during July and August. Other stores around Broadland also operated provisions boats which took fresh daily supplies out to the most popular mooring spots during the day.\n\nI will complete the family’s 1932 holiday in the next post when they head off to Great Yarmouth for a day at the seaside before returning the boat to the Broads Haven yard at the end of the week."
