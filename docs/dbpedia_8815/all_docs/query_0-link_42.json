        "text": "Brentford – Southall Crossrail Link (Brentford Docks Line)\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. Converting this existing three-mile freight line to passenger services would provide a link to the new Elizabeth Line, supporting major housing and employment growth on the Great West Road site and relieving pressure on the A4.\n\nFind out more about Brentford – Southall Crossrail Link (Brentford Docks Line)\n\nOxford – Cowley\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. The section from Oxford to Cowley is intact as a freight-only line. The 2017 Budget gave a small amount of funding to consider reopening. A subsequent 16 miles of line to Thames and Princess Risborough should also be considered.\n\nFind out more about Oxford – Cowley\n\nHenbury Loop (north Bristol)\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This six-mile freight-only line is due to be partially reopened as a spur in 2021. It would offer new passenger rail services in north Bristol and also facilitate a Bristol Temple Meads – Avonmouth – Bristol Parkway service and access to the redevelopment of Filton Aerodrome.\n\nFind out more about Henbury Loop (north Bristol)\n\nOkehampton – Tavistock – Bere Alston\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. Happily, regular passenger services from Exeter to Okehampton have recently been restored. We think the line from Okehampton – Tavistock – Bere Alston should also be reopened. This 23-mile reinstatement would include a reopening of the 5.5 miles between Bere Alston and a new station outside Tavistock, allowing a direct route to Plymouth. The reopening has widespread support including from the County Council.\n\nFind out more about Okehampton – Tavistock – Bere Alston\n\nPortishead – Bristol\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This seven-mile reopening would connect the commuter town to Bristol, avoiding the busy M5. Update: this project has been given final approval by the government and is being taken forward as part of the MetroWest project.\n\nFind out more about Portishead – Bristol\n\nMarch – Wisbech and potentially on to King’s Lynn\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This is an eight-mile reinstatement connecting Wisbech (population 30,000) to March and onward to Cambridge. The eight-mile route onward to Kings Lynn would create a strategic link to the ECML.\n\nFind out more about March – Wisbech\n\nHaverhill – Cambridge\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This route would improve commuter access to Cambridge. The route follows the former Stour Valley Railway and could be extended a further nine miles to Sudbury.\n\nFind out more about Haverhill – Cambridge\n\nShirebrook – Ollerton\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This would be a six-mile extension of the Robin Hood line from Warsop to Ollerton, with new stations for Warsop, Edwinstowe and Ollerton. The line is operational, being used as a test track.\n\nFind out more about Shirebrook – Ollerton\n\nMatlock – Buxton\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. If reopened for passengers and freight, this former mainline route would link three cities, reconnect isolated communities and serve the Buxton quarries. MEMRAP is calling for 13 miles of missing track to be replaced, and a further 23 miles of single-track upgrades at each end, to reinstate the Peaks and Dales Line and fully reconnect the North West and East Midland regions by rail.\n\nLeek – Stoke\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This mothballed railway line (in operation until 1988) would bring Leek (population 21,000) back onto the network, allow freight traffic from a nearby quarry and give an existing heritage line a connection to the mainline.\n\nFind out more about Leek – Stoke\n\nStratford – Long Marston – Honeyborne line\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This line would create a strategic through route. Around 15,500 houses are planned for the Stratford upon Avon District between 2016 and 2031 including 6,000 at Long Marston.\n\nFerryhill – Pelaw\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. The Leamside Branch – connecting the ECML to the Newcastle-Sunderland line at Pelaw – is an intact line. It would be suitable for a variety of service options including a regional service linking the Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear, freight services to the Sunderland Nissan plant and a diversionary freight route for the ECML.\n\nFind out more about Ferryhill – Pelaw\n\nAshington Blyth and Tyne\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. Now a freight-only line, it once served towns including Blyth, Ashington and Bedlington, giving access to Newcastle, the Tyne and Wear Metro and potentially Edinburgh. It would significantly improve connectivity for several large towns largely through use of existing alignments.\n\nFind out more about Ashington Blyth and Tyne\n\nSkipton – Colne\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This is an 11.5-mile link creating a through route from Leeds to Liverpool. The formation is largely intact. The line passes through a conurbation of 500k and has the potential for local, regional and freight services. The reopening would include Earby station and new park and ride station near Barnoldswick.\n\nFind out more about Skipton – Colne\n\nSkelmersdale – Liverpool\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. This largely intact three-mile extension of Merseyrail’s Ormskirk line would bring Skelmersdale (population 39,000) onto the network and offer a new station serving the north of Kirkby. This would be the terminus for for Merseyrail’s Northern Line, with connections to Wigan and Manchester.\n\nFind out more about Skelmersdale – Liverpool\n\nPoulton-le-Fylde – Fleetwood\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. A 5.5-mile branch line originally ran from Preston to Fleetwood but closed south of Poulton in 1970. The line continued as a freight route until 1999. The alignment is intact. We would like to see this line reopen for passenger services and freight.\n\nFind out more about Poulton-le-Fylde – Fleetwood\n\nThornton – Leven in Fife\n\nWe think this line is a #1 priority. The Levenmouth rail link aims to reopen five miles through Leven with Thornton where it would join the Fife Circle Line. It would improve local connectivity. Freight facilities could serve the Diageo distillery.\n\nFind out more about Thornton – Leven in Fife"
