        "text": "Lowestoft commemorates 175 years since the arrival of the railway on Tuesday May 3, the anniversary of the line between Norwich and Lowestoft being opened.\n\nTo mark the occasion a special timeline of events will be unveiled on the anniversary by Waveney MP Peter Aldous at the towns station, the most easterly point of the entire UK rail network.\n\nIn 1844, Sir Samuel Morton Peto who resided at nearby Somerleyton Hall purchased Lowestoft Harbour and announced plans to construct a railway from Reedham. Following Parliamentary approval, construction started in 1846 with the line opening to goods traffic on May 3rd 1847 with passenger services commencing a few months later on July 1.\n\nAfter the arrival of the railway the town grew considerably, attracting major industry in addition to trading links via the port to Europe. Morton Peto also created a fashionable resort to the south of the harbour. The initial route to Norwich was followed in 1859 by a line south to Ipswich and in 1903, a direct route to Great Yarmouth.\n\nThe railway brought huge prosperity to the town, with a network of goods lines conveying products from major factories including war rations from the Maconochie canning factory and later produce from famous brands such as Morton and the Cooperative Wholesale Society. The railway enabled fish caught in Lowestoft, to be available in Manchester or London within hours.\n\nLowestoft railway station is a great survivor having escaped serious damage in two World Wars, fire, floods, attempts by the local authority to relocate it away from the town centre and the infamous Beeching Report.\n\nKey historic events around the station include, in 1915 the former Great Eastern Railway stables becoming the first UK railway premises to be bombed in a Zeppelin Air Raid, the 1938 arrival of over 500 Jewish children escaping Nazi oppression in Europe as part of the Kindertansport Initiative and the evacuation of over 3000 children away from the threat of invasion and bombing during World War 2. The station was even used as a filming location for Anglia Television’s acclaimed drama series, Tales of The Unexpected.\n\nIn recent years, Network Rail has invested over £60m upgrading signalling and level crossings as well as creating brand new freight sidings which operated for the first time earlier this year. In 2019 Greater Anglia introduced a brand-new fleet of trains which operate services from Lowestoft to Ipswich and Norwich.\n\nThe special timeline has been installed by the Wherry Lines Community Rail Partnership and the Lowestoft Central Project, who in recent years have substantially rejuvenated and restored, the station creating an exhibition space inside the former parcels office and most recently, opening the town’s Tourist Information office.\n\nThe original route is now part of the Wherry Lines and below are some of the major events for the railway in Lowestoft over the past 175 years…\n\n175 YEARS OF THE RAILWAY IN LOWESTOFT 1847 — 2022\n\nIn 1844 Sir Samuel Morton Peto who resided at Somerleyton Hall, purchased Lowestoft Harbour and announced plans to construct a railway from Reedham to Lowestoft.
