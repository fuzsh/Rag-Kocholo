        "text": "Serving the villages of Dent, Cowgill and South Lakeland, Dent Station lies on the Settle and Carlisle line and was opened in 1877. It’s the highest station in England at an altitude of 1,150 ft (350 m) and overlooks the village more than 400 ft (120 m) below.\n\nDuring the 1970s the Grade II listed station buildings were transformed into an outdoor pursuits centre, offering places for pupils who took part in caving, potholing, map reading and other survivalist courses. With minimal facilities, the gloriously traditional stone buildings have settled into the Yorkshire countryside as though they had been here as the Moors evolved.\n\nDent makes a great base for exploring Yorkshire and with Northern’s commitment to eco-friendly travel, bike carrying facilities are being created across our trains, allowing you to enjoy the countryside by bike.\n\nHow far is the walk from Dent Station to the village centre?\n\nIt takes around 15 minutes to walk down the steep hill into the village of Dent, going via Lea Yeat Brow.\n\nDoes Dent Station have car park facilities?\n\nThe station has 8 car parking spaces that are open all day, every day, but lacks bike storage facilities.\n\nHow far is Dent Station from Dent?\n\nDent Station is around 4 miles from Dent.\n\nWhat facilities are available at Dent Station?\n\nDisabled Access - step-free access through part of the station, ramps and Induction Loops available."
