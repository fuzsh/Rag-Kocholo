The box was opened by the L&NER in 1926 replacing an earlier wooden structure and contained a 56 lever frame (which seems rather an overkill) and closed along with the line between Beccles and Yarmouth South Town, in November 1959. After being derelict for many years, the box has been lovingly converted into living accommodation. Note the wartime Pill Box on the left.",
