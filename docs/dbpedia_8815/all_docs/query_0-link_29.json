        "text": "HERRINGFLEET is a village in the north of Suffolk; it is on the river Waveney. The ‘fleet’ part of the name means stream – the Herring part has nothing to do with fish, unfortunately; it means the people of Herela. This can be deduced from the Domesday version of the parish name. Until 1974 the settlement around the ruined priory of St Olave’s was part of Herringfleet, but in the redistribution of parish boundaries St Olave’s was transferred to Fritton. Fritton had always been part of Suffolk, but is now in Norfolk. The rump of Herringfleet remains in Suffolk. Now the resulting parish of Herringfleet is tiny, having about 50 inhabitants in total, and no village centre. There is however a church in the village, dedicated to St Margaret.\n\nHerringfleet church has an early example of an East Anglia’s round towered church. The Saxon bell openings give the tower a mid-eleventh century date and architectural unity for the tower, which cannot be said for many of the round towers, which have a later upper stage imposed on the Saxon base. The thatched roof of the nave and porch also give the church an air of antiquity; I believe the reed thatch to have been renewed relatively recently. The church has been very well looked after, which I am slightly puzzled about as it must have a very small congregation.\n\nThe Leather family lived at Herringfleet Hall for many years, and John Francis Leather oversaw the renovations to the church that were undertaken in the 1820s. Apart from the tower, the bulk of the church is basically late medieval. There is a fine collection of medieval English and continental stained glass, which must have been assembled by John Francis. He travelled to the Rhineland after fighting at the Battle of Waterloo, where he acquired some fine examples which he brought back with him.\n\nThere was a railway station in the village; it should have been called Herringfleet station, but it went by the name of St Olave’s. This station was on the line from Yarmouth South Town to Beccles, which opened in 1859 and closed a hundred years later in 1959; this was well before the Local Government reorganisation that move St Olave’s to Norfolk. St Olave’s station was next on the line to Haddiscoe High Level, which was linked to Haddiscoe Low Level by a footpath. The Haddiscoe Low Level Station still remains, now called simply Haddiscoe Station; it is tiny place ever to have had two railway stations. It stands just across the river from St Olave’s on the Norfolk side. This is on a branch of the Wherry Line which takes trains from Norwich to Lowestoft. The trains that went from Great Yarmouth via St Olave’s station ultimately terminated at London Liverpool Street. The trains joined the East Suffolk Line from Lowestoft at Beccles where the coaches from Yarmouth and Lowestoft were combined.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES of the PAST"
