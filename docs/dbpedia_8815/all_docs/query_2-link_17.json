        "text": "Which stations… have the most unpredictable service?\n\nProbably Ince & Elton .\n\nWhich stations… had novelty name signs?\n\nSeveral stations have had their name signs temporarily changed to support an advertising or charity fundraising campaign. Known examples are shown here with links to photographic evidence where possible, along with any relevant dates known. Note that, to qualify for this list there must have been a physical change at the station; lesser alterations limited to customer information system (CIS) screens, for example, are out of scope.\n\nStation Novelty name Reason Note Barnsley Interchange Barnsleigh Interchange Charity fundraiser Sign fitted 10 December 2019 in aid of Barnsley Hospice Blackpool North Blackpool North Pole Charity fundraiser Sign fitted 10 December 2019 (still present 11 January 2020) in aid of Donna's Dream House Bond Street London Underground Burberry Street Clothing brand advertising Signs fitted 16 September 2023 to 19 September 2023 Bradford Forster Square Bradford FOSTER Square Charity fundraiser Sign fitted 15 May 2023, likely removed 28 May 2023 Cambuslang Cambus langjump 2014 Commonwealth Games support Rendition had very long space in name to suggest the sport Canada Water London Underground Buxton Water Bottled water advertising Sign fitted 26 April 2015 only Chessington South hieroglyphics Chessington World of Adventures Resort advertising Sign fitted 29 September 2020 only Chillwell Road Nottingham Express Transit 'Chills'-well Road Hallowe'en observance Signs fitted 23 October 2022 to early November 2022 Dingwall Ding-Ding!

Names are as given on National Rail, so includes qualifiers such as geographical areas.\n\n23 characters\n\nBirmingham International\n\nChafford Hundred Lakeside\n\nExhibition Centre (Glasgow)\n\nFolkestone East Staff Halt\n\nSt Leonards Warrior Square\n\nWavertree Technology Park\n\nWest Hampstead Thameslink\n\nWorcester Foregate Street\n\n24 characters\n\nBirkenhead Hamilton Square\n\nBurnside (South Lanarkshire)\n\nCaledonian Road & Barnsbury\n\nChapeltown (South Yorkshire)\n\nDunfermline Queen Margaret\n\nRadcliffe (Nottinghamshire)\n\nSt James Street (Walthamstow)\n\nStratford-upon-Avon Parkway\n\nTop ten\n\nSouthampton Airport Parkway 25 characters\n\nJames Cook University Hospital 27 characters\n\nLondon St Pancras International 28 characters\n\nPrestwick International Airport 29 characters\n\nManchester United Football Ground 30 characters\n\nHeathrow Terminal 4 (Rail Station Only) 32 characters\n\nHeathrow Terminal 5 (Rail Station Only) 32 characters\n\nRhoose Cardiff International Airport 33 characters\n\nHeathrow Terminals 2 & 3 (Rail Station only) 35 characters\n\nHeathrow Terminals 1, 2 & 3 (Rail Station only) 36 characters\n\nThe various Heathrow stations are awkwardly named on National Rail; the qualifier in parentheses does not appear on station signs (and Terminal 5 does not even name Heathrow on signs). Excluding this, the Terminals 4 and 5 stations become 18 characters and the Terminals 2 & 3 station (renamed from Terminals 1, 2 & 3 on closure of the airport's terminal 1) becomes 20 characters. The inconsistent lower case 'only' for terminals 2 & 3 is as given on National Rail.\n\nThe famous Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch has 58 characters but is shown in truncated form as 'Llanfairpwll' on National Rail.\n\nQueenstown Road often has the qualifier Battersea (making 23 characters) but National Rail does not have the term.\n\nManchester United Football Ground no longer appears on National Rail and Folkestone East Staff Halt had no need ever to appear there.\n\nJames Cook had 'James Cook University Hospital Station' 34 characters on signs when first opened on 24 March 2014, then just 'James Cook' 9 characters by the time opening formalities took place on 18 July 2014. National Rail uses the longer version without the word 'station'.\n\nNumber of words\n\nThis listing considers the number of words used by National Rail for station names. Hyphenated names are considered as separate words.\n\nFive words\n\nLondon St Pancras Eastern Interim\n\nPen-y-Bont (Mid Wales)\n\nSt Annes-on-the-Sea\n\nSt Keyne Wishing Well Halt\n\nSilvertown & London City Airport\n\nSix words\n\nHeathrow Terminal 4 (Rail Station Only)\n\nHeathrow Terminal 5 (Rail Station Only)\n\nSeven words\n\nNone\n\nEight words\n\nHeathrow Terminals 2 and 3 (Rail Station only)\n\nNine words\n\nHeathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3 (Rail Station only)\n\nHeathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3 (Rail Station only) was renamed Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3 (Rail Station only). Excluding the awkward qualifiers, particularly for the Heathrow stations, the longest current station names by number of words are just five words long. Of the remaining contenders, Silvertown & London City Airport and London St Pancras Eastern Interim (only ever a temporary station) have closed leaving St Annes-on-the-Sea and St Keyne Wishing Well Halt as the longest. It is an interesting coincidence that both are Saints.\n\nWhich stations… have the shortest names?\n\nA list of stations with short names, as given on National Rail.\n\nThree characters\n\nAsh\n\nAyr\n\nEly\n\nIBM\n\nOre\n\nPar\n\nWem\n\nWye\n\nIBM no longer appears on National Rail.\n\nFour characters\n\nAber\n\nAcle\n\nBryn\n\nCroy\n\nDeal\n\nDent\n\nDiss\n\nDrem\n\nDyce\n\nFord\n\nHook\n\nHove\n\nHull\n\nIver\n\nLake\n\nLiss\n\nLooe\n\nOban\n\nPyle\n\nRhyl\n\nRoby\n\nSarn\n\nStow\n\nSway\n\nTain\n\nWick\n\nWool\n\nYarm\n\nYate\n\nYork\n\nWhich stations… are open but not served by trains?\n\nSince 1 April 1994 (when the privatisation structure took effect), these stations have had their passenger service removed (for reasons other than prolonged planned engineering works the definition is subjective) but officially remained 'open'. Those struck through (thus) have since closed or been re-served.\n\nAltnabreac last served 11 November 2023\n\nAshford International international portion only, last served 30 March 2020; may be served again from 2025\n\nAspley Guise last served 1 December 2022; re-served 20 November 2023\n\nAtherstone last served 22 May 2004; re-served 12 December 2005\n\nAyr last served 25 September 2023; re-served 4 December 2023\n\nBarlaston last served 22 May 2004\n\nBarrow Haven last served 7 May 2022; re-served 9 November 2022\n\nBarrhill last served 15 November 2023; re-served 1 July 2024\n\nBedford St Johns last served 1 December 2022; re-served 20 November 2023\n\nBedworth last served 22 May 2004; re-served 13 June 2005\n\nBow Brickhill last served 1 December 2022; re-served 20 November 2023\n\nBrigg last served 1 January 2022; re-served 14 January 2023\n\nCroxley Green last served 22 March 1996; official closure 26 September 2003\n\nFenny Stratford last served 1 December 2022; re-served 20 November 2023\n\nFolkestone Harbour last served 20 March 2009; official closure 31 May 2014\n\nGirvan last served 15 November 2023; re-served 1 July 2024\n\nHeathrow Terminal 4 last served 9 May 2020; re-served 14 June 2022\n\nIBM last served 9 December 2018\n\nInce & Elton irregular service through 2023; last served 13 October 2023; re-served 20 November 2023.

It is not limited to stations; there are undoubtedly other designations since then.\n\nWhich stations… have post boxes on them?\n\nFull list on this page .\n\nWhich stations… were built in a triangular arrangement?\n\nPlatforms are required on all three sides to qualify here. Please contact the editor if you can prove (or otherwise) the arrangement where detail is unclear.\n\nAmbergate\n\nBishop Auckland\n\nEarlestown\n\nForres unclear if south-to-east platforms existed\n\nQueensbury\n\nRutherglen\n\nShipley\n\nWood Lane London Underground Central line\n\nDinting had three sets of platforms but was not built in a triangular arrangement. When built it had platforms on the main east-west line and on the east-south branch to Glossop. The layout was later rearranged with today's west-south curve (with platforms), which severed the earlier curve and platforms. A new east-south curve was built on a new alignment without platforms.\n\nWhich stations… are not accessible by road?\n\nGenerally, stations are accessible by footpath. Some exist(ed) for interchange only. Some were constructed by heritage railways or access arrangements changed post-preservation.\n\nAbbey North British Railway\n\nAltnabreac\n\nAsh Town\n\nAshey Isle of Wight Steam Railway\n\nBala Junction\n\nBeasdale access uncertain\n\nBeeston Tor Leek & Manifold Valley Light Railway\n\nBerney Arms\n\nBlack Rock\n\nBoscarne Exchange Platform\n\nBurnhill\n\nCairnie Junction 1 June 1898-14 June 1965?\n\nCampbell's Platform Ffestiniog Railway\n\nCefn-Onn\n\nCamber Sands Rye & Camber Tramway\n\nClogwyn Snowdon Mountain Railway\n\nColeford Junction\n\nColnbrook Manchester Metrolink; initially interchange only with emergency exit, later opened as a full stop\n\nConsall\n\nCorrour\n\nCounty March\n\nCountry Park Severn Valley Railway\n\nCreosor Junction\n\nCutlers Green\n\nDduallt Ffestiniog Railway\n\nDeadwater\n\nDovey Junction\n\nDukeries Junction\n\nDungeness\n\nEastry\n\nElvington\n\nFreshfield Bluebell Railway\n\nGolf Club Halt\n\nGolf Links Rye & Camber Tramway\n\nGrogley\n\nHaddiscoe\n\nHalfway Snowdon Mountain Railway\n\nHazel Grove Midland Railway\n\nHolehouse Junction 2 December 1895-3 April 1950\n\nHolton Heath road access provided from &ap;1940s?\n\nHope Exchange later opened as a full stop\n\nIncline Top\n\nIngra Tor\n\nKelston\n\nKillin Junction 1 April 1886-?\n\nKirriemuir\n\nLambley\n\nLewiefield\n\nLinley\n\nLochskerrow road access provided from 1950s\n\nLongcross\n\nLympstone Commando\n\nManulla Junction Iarnród Éireann; originally full station, later interchange only\n\nMethven\n\nMiddlewood\n\nMorebath Junction\n\nNant Gwernol Talyllyn Railway\n\nNew Hadley\n\nNewton Dale North Yorkshire Moors Railway\n\nOtford Junction\n\nPilmoor road access provided from 1879\n\nPlas Ffestiniog Railway\n\nPort Victoria\n\nRaglan Footpath\n\nRheidol Falls Vale of Rheidol Railway\n\nRhiwfron Vale of Rheidol Railway\n\nRiccarton Junction\n\nRiver Douglas\n\nRocky Valley Snowdon Mountain Railway\n\nRoudham Junction\n\nSt Olaves Junction/Herringfleet Junction\n\nSinfin Central\n\nSmallbrook Junction\n\nSparrowlee Leek & Manifold Valley Light Railway\n\nStretford Bridge Bishop's Castle Railway\n\nSummit Snowdon Mountain Railway\n\nThe Midden Wells & Walsingham Railway\n\nThor's Cave Leek & Manifold Valley Light Railway\n\nUralite\n\nWaddon Marsh\n\nWest Ashfield London Underground training 'station' in office block\n\nYarwell Junction Nene Valley Railway\n\nIn addition, these stations were used for interchange only for part or all of their existance, but it is not known if any type of external access was possible.\n\nAbbots Wood Junction November 1850-1 October 1855\n\nAberdare Junction 29 October 1855-30 April 1856\n\nAbingdon Junction 2 June 1856-7 September 1873\n\nAlderbury Junction February 1872-?\n\nArdwick [LY] probably 1852-1853 though existence uncertain\n\nBushbury 2 August 1852-30 June 1856\n\nCarnforth [Fur/Mid] 6 June 1867-2 August 1880\n\nEast Grinstead High Level 1 August 1882-15 October 1883\n\nHereford Junction dates unknown\n\nHunthill Junction dates unknown\n\nKemble 12 May 1845-1 May 1882\n\nMarron Junction circa 1878-1883\n\nNorth Kent Junction 1 September 1849-?\n\nSiddick Junction 1 September 1880-1 March 1890\n\nWhich stations… have a platform 0?\n\nStation Note Bradford Forster Square new platform 0 considered, a side effect of Transpennine Route Upgrade, but ruled out Bristol Temple Meads new platform 0 under consideration Cardiff Central opened by May? 2002, initially for occasional/one-off use; later upgraded for regular use Chippenham south side platform is referred to as 'platform 0', though it currently has no track Doncaster temporary platform used 27 May 2000 to at least 1 June 2000; permanent platform opened 4 December 2016 (first trains called 12 December) Gravesend opened 6 January 2014 Haymarket opened 27 December 2006 Hooton former platform 2, adjacent to station building, used by charter trains; since renumbering 18 May 1985 often referred to as 'platform 0' Leeds opened 27 December 2020 (first trains called 28 December) Liverpool Lime Street from 30 July 2018 former platform 1, now trackless, referred to as 'platform 0' London Kings Cross opened 25 (formalities 20) May 2010; taken out of use 20 December 2020; returned to use 26 April 2021 Preston temporary use of old parcels platform, used in 2004 Rainham (Kent) opened 29 March 2016 Redhill opened 2 January 2018 Stockport opened for occasional use &ap;18 September 2005; regular use March 2008 Westbury south side platform is referred to as 'platform 0', though it currently has no track\n\nWhich stations… have names reflecting commerce?\n\nGenerally the stations listed were named according to the 'business' (in its loosest sense) they serve rather than to commemorate a site. Thus, for example, stations named after public houses are shown even if a community later took the name, but not stations named after the community that was itself named after the public house.\n\nAll stations are on the national network unless stated otherwise. Terms in [square brackets] are to aid identification only and are not part of the name. The nature of the naming is given; the term 'pub' refers to any public house, hostelry, inn or hotel.\n\nNote that not all stations are currently open and words such as 'halt' are omitted. The list is somewhat subjective; the editor's decision is final, but generally the 'benefit of the doubt' is given.\n\nThe reader is invited to explore these pages to find out more about church and pub name derivations, including for non-station assets.\n\nAbbey [Cumbria] church\n\nAbbey & West Dereham church\n\nAcrow factory\n\nAll Saints Docklands Light Railway;
