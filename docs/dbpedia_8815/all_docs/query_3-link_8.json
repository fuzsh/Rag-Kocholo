Has this arrangement caused problems anywhere by leaving people unable to get across the crossing to catch a train because the same train closes the crossing? (I've noticed that some level crossings have a long wait from the barriers going down to the train coming.). I noticed Habrough as being one station where the above might occur - the station has staggered platforms, so in both directions the train goes across the level crossing before arriving at the platform. (Do train crew in these instances look out for people on the wrong side of the crossing and wait for them to get across before leaving).\n\nOr people rushing across the crossing trying to catch the train or crossing in front of the train they have just got off (are drivers supposed to look out/sound their horn when moving off, because otherwise pedestrians using the crossing have no way of knowing that the train is just about to depart).\n\nSponsor Post - registered members do not see these adverts; click here to register, or click here to log in\n\nR\n\nRailUK Forums\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#2\n\nTomnick\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n10 Jun 2005\n\nMessages\n\n5,853\n\nI'm sure it must catch some 'last minute' people out, particularly at those stations which sit between a level crossing and its protecting signal (meaning that the barriers need to be down well before the train arrives, and will remain so until it's gone) or where something in the other direction means the barriers are down for a few minutes beforehand. You'd have to be really late to get caught out at Habrough though - the barriers should come down little more than half a minute before the arrival of the train.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#3\n\nTrainfan344\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n13 Oct 2012\n\nMessages\n\n2,306\n\nHaddiscoe has a foot crossing between platforms.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#4\n\nWestboy\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n20 Oct 2008\n\nMessages\n\n35\n\nTackley in Oxfordshire has it's only acces from the Village to the Oxford platform across a foot crossing.\n\nWas a fatality there a few years ago (07?) where the report concluded the victim confused the train that hit her with the train she wanted to catch (and which would have stopped before the crossing).\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#5\n\nJoeGJ1984\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n7 Nov 2010\n\nMessages\n\n521\n\nHaddiscoe has a foot crossing between platforms.\n\nThe Station Facilities page for Haddiscoe on the National Rail website warns that \"This station has Barrow or Level crossing.

Train staff?\n\nI don't know the station, but looking at the images there doesn't seem to be any signs that discourage you from crossing, and if I did have to catch a train from the far platform I certainly wouldn't want to wait until the train arrives on the scene before crossing (which would have passed over the crossing before entering the platform - I'd want to be on the platform before the train arrived). I don't know if there is any signalman nearby.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#8\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#9\n\n83G/84D\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Oct 2011\n\nMessages\n\n5,980\n\nLocation\n\nCornwall\n\nHayle station has a foot crossing, with coloured lights.\n\nhttps://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha...=FUbCOtlZUGjFnFdYajzubQ&cbp=12,288.14,,1,2.82\n\nAnd there have been several \"near msses\" here with people alighting from up trains ignoring / not seeing the red lights and crossing in front of an unsighted down train.\n\nIt is proposed to close the barrow crossing and divert it under the nearby bridge provided some improvements can be made by Network Rail and Cornwall Council.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#10\n\nCrossover\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n4 Jun 2009\n\nMessages\n\n9,296\n\nLocation\n\nYorkshire\n\nLots of stations have this arrangement. A few on the West Coastaway have - Southbourne (SOB) being one that I have used. Not staggered platforms at Sittingbourne but it means that one way, the barriers are down so the protecting signal can clear. The other way, my friend who I was meeting said they were down as we were at Emsworth, the previous station (though that train clears the LC before making the station call at SOB)\n\nSherburn-in-Elmet is another station which crossing is via an LC (though closed to vehicles now) - not a busy station though, that one!\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#11\n\nTheEdge\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n29 Nov 2012\n\nMessages\n\n4,489\n\nLocation\n\nNorwich\n\nBuckenham and Halesworth both have foot crossing access only.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#12\n\nsteamybrian\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n26 Nov 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,763\n\nLocation\n\nKent\n\nThere are several stations on the Settle and Carlisle line with foot crossing access only to one of the platforms.\n\nFor example- Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Ribblehead, Dent and Garsdale\n\nSturry and East Farleigh are unusual in having staggered platforms each side of a level crossing\n\nLast edited: 8 Feb 2013\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#13\n\ngnolife\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n4 Nov 2010\n\nMessages\n\n2,041\n\nLocation\n\nJohnstone\n\nNavigation Road is quite an easy one to get caught out at - the level crossing spends a lot of the time down because of the Metrolink - usually about 3 or 4 minutes out of 6 - meaning that it is very easy to get to the Level crossing 5 minutes before the train's due, and still miss it because your on the wrong platform.\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#14\n\nATW Alex 101\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Dec 2010\n\nMessages\n\n2,084\n\nLocation\n\nEllesmere port\n\nAlfreton has a barrow crossing but there is a sign saying that it cant be used when the station is unstaffed and to use the footbridge where possible\n\n8 Feb 2013\n\n#15\n\nyorksrob\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n6 Aug 2009\n\nMessages\n\n39,870\n\nLocation\n\nYorks\n\nHam Street on the Marshlink still has a foot crossing between staggered platforms.

It was better pre-electrification because there were fewer trains and local control."
