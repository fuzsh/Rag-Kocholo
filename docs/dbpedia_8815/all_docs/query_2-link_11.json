        "text": "In recent times, the humble, enamel totem has reached into the hearts of collectors. Utilised as the corporate image when British Railways came into being in 1948, it was decided that regional colours would be adopted and around the end of 1949 early 1950, they began to appear on the majority of UK stations, large and small. The vast majority measure 36in x 10in, some with flanges, some without. Some stations were only perhaps fitted with two whereas large stations such as Clapham Junction would have been riddled with them. Extremely collectable today, reminding enthusiasts of holidays, spotting trips or just simply commuting or visits to stations. Many fall into themes such as those with the word Junction or a particular line with successive station names. Many collectors start with an example from each region. A definitive book British Railways Station Totems by Richard Furness & Dave Brennand is an informed treasure for the collector.\n\nGWRA are the undisputed World record holder for a Totem price and have sold more Totems since 2021 than any other auction house."
