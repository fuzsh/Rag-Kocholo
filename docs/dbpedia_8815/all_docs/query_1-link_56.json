        "text": "National strategy\n\nA network-wide strategy is needed which covers the full range of issues. At its most basic, this would mean things like eliminating lineside trees that could fall onto the line or the OLE. That’s not as simple as it may appear, given that many such trees are not on the railway’s land nor in its ownership. However, let’s start with the easy stuff and get rid of those that Network Rail does have control of. It won’t be popular and may involve managing tree preservation orders and so on, but it needs doing so that we no longer need speed restrictions every time there is a gale forecast.\n\nThe Dawlish-type scenario is much more difficult. I am sure that my fellow engineers can design and construct better structures than the existing (or recently existing!) ones to support and protect the line along the Cornish and Devon coastline. I am sure that they could take into account the expected further increases in the height of the tides and surges to be faced in the future. Whether this would be cost effective for the whole of the length of ‘at risk’ railway is doubtful. I also imagine that, however good these structures may be, they will not provide an impregnable defence against the sea, and at some future time there would be further service disruption.\n\nDawlish cannot be the only place where such intractable problems may be foreseen, and strategies must be developed to manage each of them. There is already talk in the media of the possibility of reopening old alternative rail routes to the West Country, such as the line via Okehampton. That is one possible approach that would offer more benefits than just another way round when the sea gets rough. In normal times, it would additionally increase network capacity and provide a rail service to communities that lost it many years ago.\n\nThe restoration of former rail routes has been successful already, particularly in Scotland, so why not in a serious way in England and Wales too?\n\nPriorities\n\nFinally, I have been concerned to see the current weather effects being used by some in the media to open up yet another front of attack on HS2. Why, they argue, spend all that money on a new railway when we can’t even keep the existing ones open when there is a bit of bad weather? Let’s have some of the cash to put right the existing network.\n\nI have no time for such ideas. The existing network hasn’t the capacity to cope with demand when the weather is good and all is working perfectly. Perfecting its weather resistance will not alter the shortfall in capacity, just make that capacity more reliably available.\n\nOur country needs to face up to the need to spend strategically on its infrastructure. To spend both to make existing long-lived infrastructure robust against climate change and to meet future demand changes and increases by providing new infrastructure. Those two are not alternatives, they are equal essentials that must both happen.\n\nI was privileged to sit on a panel that assisted the Institution of Civil Engineers to draw up its responses to the public consultations on the Phase 1 and Phase 2 proposals for HS2. One of the Institution’s most important comments in both its response documents was the insistence that the country needs a proper transport strategy. One of the greatest difficulties in arguing coherently in favour of HS2 is the inability to show that it fits the country’s future transport needs because we do not have a transport strategy properly developed in response to a valid assessment of what those needs will be.\n\nI go further, supporting far greater engineers than myself, people like Sir John Armitt. I say that there is a vital requirement in this country for a strategic plan for our infrastructure, not just our transport infrastructure. Which of our politicians has the guts to take up that requirement and do something positive and effective about it?"
