        "text": "Hope Valley Line is a good example of where semaphores are still in use.\n\nI intend to spend some time along the Hope Valley in 2018 for a whole lot of reasons, semaphores being just 1 of many\n\nRegarding NRs information in the link in the second post, I've just checked a couple of my local crossings and can say that the information cannot be taken as gospel. Agnes Crossing is described as a Public Footpath when it is, in fact, an Accommodation Crossing for access to a single property. Also Millers crossing which is a Public footpath crossing between Limestone Hall Crossing and Kirksanton Crossing is absent.\n\nI merely posted the link without warranty of accuracy. A few that I looked at had me questioning my 'local' knowledge of some former stamping grounds. There were quite a lot of 'typos' and data that I found, shall I say, 'unexpected'.\n\nIn the defence of NR on the naming front, the names of crossings locally and in NR's books may well be different. As far as the 'missing' crossing goes did you do both a postcode and map search?\n\nI intend to spend some time along the Hope Valley in 2018 for a whole lot of reasons, semaphores being just 1 of many\n\nI merely posted the link without warranty of accuracy.

As far as the 'missing' crossing goes did you do both a postcode and map search?\n\nThanks for that, I did a search on postcode rather than just on the name and it turned up as Taylor's Crossing which is described as a 'Private User worked Crossing with Telephone no whistelboard'. In LNW North RouteSectional Appendix Module NWF http://archive.nr.co.uk/browse docu...on north western north sectional appendix.pdf page 83 the name is Millers LC while Agnes Crossing is missing. I can understand that there was a data 'Black Hole' during the transition from BR to Railtrack to Network Rail but considering trains pass over daily and Risk Assessments have been done, I'm less than impressed by the standard of information which is held by the body which announces to the world on its website 'We own and operate the railway infrastructure in England, Wales and Scotland on behalf of the nation'. It's such anomalies which leave gaps in the records and can lead to disaster. NR have been criticised in the past for not knowing their assets and I feel that this situation will persist for some time to come. It's the persistence of incorrect (or anomalous) information that concerns me.\n\nAbout a year ago a young lady from Network Rail came across my drive to inspect Miller's Crossing not knowing that she was looking at Agnes Crossing and, indeed, was unaware that Agnes Crossing existed. I had to point out to her the actual layout in the area.\n\nAshton moss and branch line.\n\nRainford junction.\n\nChester to altrincham line.\n\nSouthport to wigan wallgate - chapel lane has a non block signal for good measure as well.\n\nThe set up at Chapel Lane crossing is such that on the Down line a three-aspect colour light distant signal (a rare beast) is provided. Single yellow when Chapel Lane is \"on\", two yellows when Chapel Lane is \"off\" but Parbold home signal (which protects the level crossing) is \"on\" and green only when the line is clear at least as far as Parbold starter, some distance beyond Parbold station.\n\nHML.....semaphores at Stanley, Dunkeld & Pitlochry.\n\nAlso Stirling, Dunblane, Greenloaning (albeit switched out), Blackford, Errol, Carnoustie, Leuchars, Cupar.\n\nNo doubt there's quite a few more up here but these are the ones that I can think of at the moment.\n\nStirling was resignalled in autumn 2013(?); possibly the last \"major\" semaphore installation in Scotland.\n\nThe latest edition of Modern Railways has a photo of a brand new semaphore at Henwick, just west of Worcester Forgate Street (page 48).\n\nIt's generally reckoned that the last major \"islands\" of semaphore signalling will be Worcester and Shrewsbury. However given how Network Rail's resignalling programme has slipped by many years it's more than possible that electrification could see those areas resignalled while others still retain semaphores. Not sure where though. In the meantime the need to maintain systems in good working order will doubtless see occasional further brand new semaphores.\n\nBut why use a semaphore and not a colour-light for a brand new signal? There are plenty of places where colour-lights and semaphores are mixed.\n\nOperationally, its easier to do like for like replacements, as you don't need to keep issuing updates to drivers about individual signals changing, hence reducing causes of confusion. Wholesale resignalling is different, as everything can be done at once including drivers learning the new setup.\n\nIt may also be cheaper to just do a like-for-like replacement compared to installing power cables and doing extra safety checks which would be needed when swapping to colour lights from semaphores.\n\nCabling costs can be significant. At one location guards highlighted the desirability of having an OFF indicator moved about 30 metres. Apparently the quote for doing so exceeded £10k! It didn't happen.\n\nIt was mentioned here at the time when new semaphores were added at a location where they previously didn't exist, namely at Banbury to facilitate reversals there during a GWML blockade which saw trains running Paddington - Chiltern route - Banbury (reverse) - Oxford - Didcot West curve and then normal route.\n\nAt the time Banbury was still a semaphore \"island\" and there were doubtless plenty of spare positions in the lever frame.\n\nPress release\n\nhttps://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds...y-upgrades-in-norwich-yarmouth-and-lowestoft/\n\nResidents of Lingwood, Cantley and Brundall are invited to information drop-in sessions about the major signalling upgrade to the Norwich, Yarmouth and Lowestoft rail lines.\n\nThe sessions take place in January, ahead of a nine-day closure of the lines from Saturday 10 February affecting services between Norwich, Yarmouth and Lowestoft and between Lowestoft and Ipswich. Network Rail representatives will be on hand to talk about the upgrades and answer any questions.\n\n19 January 2018 – Lingwood and Chapel Road drop in session at Lingwood Village Hall – 11:00 – 13:00 & 16:00 – 18:30\n\n30 January – Brundall drop in session at East Hills Café Bistro, Brundall Bay Marina – 10:30 – 12:30 & 14:30 – 16:30\n\n31 January – Cantley drop in session at Cantley Village Hall – 10:30 – 12:30 & 14:30 – 16:30\n\nThe next phase of work begins on the 10 February as part of a £68million investment to upgrade the signalling system and replace some of the oldest signalling equipment on the network. A total of 66 new colour light LED signals, 22 power operated points and a remote computer-based signalling control system will replace levers and physical operations, providing safer and more reliable journeys for passengers.\n\nFour level crossings will be closed temporarily on various days in the run up to and during the work as changes are made to bring them up to modern safety standards, diversions will be in place:\n\nChapel Road level crossing will be closed to vehicles and pedestrians on Sunday 21 January from 8am to 8pm\n\nLingwood level crossing will be closed to vehicles and pedestrians on Sunday 28 January from 8am to 8pm\n\nBrundall level crossing will be closed to vehicles and pedestrians overnight from 6pm Sunday 11 to 6am Monday 12 February\n\nStrumpshaw level crossing will be closed to vehicles and pedestrians on Sunday 4 February between 8am – 8pm\n\nCantley Road will also be closed at nights from 11pm – 4am Saturday 3 March 2018 until Monday 5 March 2018\n\nLevel crossings that are currently operated by a crossing keeper will be replaced with a modern barrier type remotely controlled by a signaller using CCTV cameras.\n\nMeliha Duymaz, Network Rail’s route managing director for Anglia, said: “This is a significant project that will not only transform rail travel for passengers in this region, but also bring benefits for motorists and pedestrians. We are working to provide a sustainable and efficient railway which uses modern technology, to improve safety and reliability as part of our Railway Upgrade Plan. I’d like to thank passengers for their patience while we carry out this important work and urge anyone using these services to check how their journeys will be affected ahead of travelling.”\n\nThe work will take place at several locations and there will be significant work on the Norwich-Yarmouth-Lowestoft lines between October 2017 and March 2019. This will result in changes to train services and passengers are advised to check before they travel at www.nationalrail.co.uk or with their train operator.\n\nFor more information about the project go to www.networkrail.co.uk/nyl\n\nI went up to Norfolk last September to photograph some of the boxes and signals there . I noticed several new signals had been erected so when I got back I had look at the signal maps website which shows all the signalling as proposed in 2017 not sure if it has been revised since then. However it is worthy of comment.\n\nThe new signalling is basically a two- aspect system with some three aspects here and there at junctions etc.. and is not really designed to increase headways. At both Brundall & Reedham turn back signals will be provided at the down end of the up platforms a useful feature but will it be used much ? Lingwood will get a down starter with a three aspect home but not in the up direction, why ? Cantly is much the same but the other way round. Reedham swing bridge will not get a separate signal in the down direction to protect the bridge instead it relies on the station starter . Haddiscoe will get ( After many years ! ) stop & distant signals in the up direction but none on the down ? Also it looks like Acle will not be signalled for up movements through the down platform. So unless things have been altered would readers like to comment on the above."
