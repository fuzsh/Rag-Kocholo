        "text": "Two miles from the village of Haddiscoe and close to the village of St Olaves, Haddiscoe train station is served by Abellio Greater Anglia on the Wherry Lines in Norfolk. Typical off-peak services see trains from Haddiscoe depart once every two hours in each direction between Lowestoft and Norwich. Due to its location at the end of a minor road, Haddiscoe is not served by rail replacement services.\n\nSomewhat isolated in locale and relatively distant from the villages it serves, Haddiscoe train station has minimal facilities. Cycle stands and a car park are both available for passenger use, but as there are no ticketing provisions present at the station, passengers should purchase tickets in advance or on the train. Customer help points are present on both platforms, and there is a payphone located in the station car park. Waiting shelters are present on both platforms. There's step-free access to both platforms.\n\nFind address details, station facilities, live departure times and train arrivals for Haddiscoe station."
