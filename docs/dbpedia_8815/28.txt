By the above title I mean stations where the only way to get to one or the other of the platforms is via a level crossing or foot crossing. Has this arrangement caused problems anywhere by leaving people unable to get across the crossing to catch a train because the same train closes the crossing? (I've noticed that some level crossings have a long wait from the barriers going down to the train coming.). I noticed Habrough as being one station where the above might occur - the station has staggered platforms, so in both directions the train goes across the level crossing before arriving at the platform. (Do train crew in these instances look out for people on the wrong side of the crossing and wait for them to get across before leaving).

Or people rushing across the crossing trying to catch the train or crossing in front of the train they have just got off (are drivers supposed to look out/sound their horn when moving off, because otherwise pedestrians using the crossing have no way of knowing that the train is just about to depart).

I'm sure it must catch some 'last minute' people out, particularly at those stations which sit between a level crossing and its protecting signal (meaning that the barriers need to be down well before the train arrives, and will remain so until it's gone) or where something in the other direction means the barriers are down for a few minutes beforehand. You'd have to be really late to get caught out at Habrough though - the barriers should come down little more than half a minute before the arrival of the train.

Tackley in Oxfordshire has it's only acces from the Village to the Oxford platform across a foot crossing.

Was a fatality there a few years ago (07?) where the report concluded the victim confused the train that hit her with the train she wanted to catch (and which would have stopped before the crossing).

Haddiscoe has a foot crossing between platforms.

The Station Facilities page for Haddiscoe on the National Rail website warns that "This station has Barrow or Level crossing. We do not recommend that you use it without assistance." I don't get this as the crossing seems to be the only way to access platform 2. And it's an unstaffed station, so nowhere to find assistance from.

Signalman? Train staff?

I don't know the station, but looking at the images there doesn't seem to be any signs that discourage you from crossing, and if I did have to catch a train from the far platform I certainly wouldn't want to wait until the train arrives on the scene before crossing (which would have passed over the crossing before entering the platform - I'd want to be on the platform before the train arrived). I don't know if there is any signalman nearby.

Hayle station has a foot crossing, with coloured lights.

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha...=FUbCOtlZUGjFnFdYajzubQ&cbp=12,288.14,,1,2.82

And there have been several "near msses" here with people alighting from up trains ignoring / not seeing the red lights and crossing in front of an unsighted down train.

It is proposed to close the barrow crossing and divert it under the nearby bridge provided some improvements can be made by Network Rail and Cornwall Council.

Lots of stations have this arrangement. A few on the West Coastaway have - Southbourne (SOB) being one that I have used. Not staggered platforms at Sittingbourne but it means that one way, the barriers are down so the protecting signal can clear. The other way, my friend who I was meeting said they were down as we were at Emsworth, the previous station (though that train clears the LC before making the station call at SOB)

Sherburn-in-Elmet is another station which crossing is via an LC (though closed to vehicles now) - not a busy station though, that one!

There are several stations on the Settle and Carlisle line with foot crossing access only to one of the platforms.

For example- Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Ribblehead, Dent and Garsdale

Sturry and East Farleigh are unusual in having staggered platforms each side of a level crossing

Navigation Road is quite an easy one to get caught out at - the level crossing spends a lot of the time down because of the Metrolink - usually about 3 or 4 minutes out of 6 - meaning that it is very easy to get to the Level crossing 5 minutes before the train's due, and still miss it because your on the wrong platform.

Alfreton has a barrow crossing but there is a sign saying that it cant be used when the station is unstaffed and to use the footbridge where possible

Ham Street on the Marshlink still has a foot crossing between staggered platforms. Also Pevensey Bay and Normans Bay platforms are only accessible to eachother by level crossing.

Howden in Yorkshire also has this arrangement.

And Buckenham & Haddiscoe although already mentioned are the same layout. Salhouse as well has a foot crossing only.

Downham Market had its foot crossing closed due to safety concerns, so the only way to access the opposite platform now is by level crossing. Plans for a footbridge fell through after concerns about aesthetics and disabled access, if I recall.

Foxton and shepreth both only have access by the level xings and it has been know it to cause problems. It has been known for people to get stuck the wrong side of the xings trying to get on an up train so they can see the driver but the problem is that the gates won't rise until that train has left.

Very difficult to explain to people though as you acknowledge them then drive off leaving them behind!

The southbound platform at Penistone is only accessible via the foot crossing, which is right at the South end of the Northbound platform with access at the opposite end! Luckily with only an hourly service and the crossing being where it is (and all trains stopping) it's not likely to be the scene of an Elsenham-style tragedy. Speaking of which, has a footbridge been provided at Elsenham now?

Between the parallel lines

Betchworth's two platforms are only linked by a level crossing. What makes this situation worse is that firstly people are more likely to trespass to get their train due to the very low service frequency off-peak, and secondly that the roadside path which goes over the level crossing offers no protection to pedestrians - despite the road being a very busy route with poor visibility and relatively high speeds.

There's a perfect example of most (road vehicle) drivers' attitudes to safety in general, and in particular to level crossings. :-x

I recall my surprise at finding Dent station, there being no obvious way to get to the other platform until I saw the barrow crossing at the end of the platform.

Then again I must live a sheltered life in Greater Manchester.

I have been caught out by Gnolife's example at NVR but fortunately my pushbike made the travel to Gatley instead less time-consuming.

I've been caught out by the barriers at Blythe Bridge a couple of times.

I've seen one or two people there wanting to get on a Crewe-bound train get caught out, then nonchalantly walk onto the other platform and then across the tracks in front of the waiting train.

Cononley is a problem one, where the LC is closed for considerable periods and the up platform is on the far side from the village. There was an instruction to Northern traincrew to keep a lookout for passengers trying to get across to catch their train. It was better pre-electrification because there were fewer trains and local control.
