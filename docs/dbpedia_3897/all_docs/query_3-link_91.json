        "text": "\"Sweet dreams are made of this, who am I to disagree?\"\n\n'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' captured the imaginations of the MTV generation worldwide.\n\nAnnie Lennox's striking androgynous appearance complete with a short orange-dyed buzz cut and three-piece suit made Eurythmics immediately stand out.\n\nBut they weren't all just style over substance - the pair's mix of Lennox's incredible voice and Dave Stewart's studio wizardry helped create one of the decade's darkest chart-toppers.\n\nWhen Stevie Wonder joined Eurythmics for gorgeous live version of 'There Must Be An Angel'\n\nAnnie Lennox and Eurythmics' 10 best songs ever, ranked\n\nWhen mischievous David Bowie pranked Annie Lennox by calling live TV show to make song request\n\nSo what inspired 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)'? How was it received when it was released? Why was there a cow in the music video?\n\nHere's all you need to know:\n\nWho wrote ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)’?\n\nEurythmics was a duo of two key songwriters - Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart who would write their music together with equal contributions, as was the case with ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)’.\n\nLennox and Stewart met when they both studied at the Royal Academy of Music where they started a band with fellow students called The Tourists.\n\nAfter limited success, Lennox and Stewart broke away to form the Eurythmics, though they broke up as a romantic couple shortly after starting their new project.\n\nThey were compelled to continue writing songs together due to their creative chemistry, which influenced the majority of their songs moving forwards.\n\nDave Stewart later recalled: \"This causes many problems, yet through all of this we ended up writing a lot of great songs, some were about 'our' relationship and some were about our relationship with the world around us.\"\n\nWhat is ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)’ about?\n\nAccording to Lennox's book, Annie Lennox: The Biography, Lennox explained that the song is about the search for fulfilment and the \"sweet dreams\" that motivate people's lives.\n\nDave Stewart later said: \"It's actually a very sort of existential, spooky record asking if this is what the world has come to. Is this what our dreams are made of? I suppose it was reality, basically, what we were writing about. It wasn't a Disney kind of world.\"\n\nThe song has a dark edge because the band were struggling to make ends meet at the time due to their failed first album, and were commenting on keeping the drive to make your dreams a reality when the world becomes increasingly more bleak.\n\nLennox and Stewart's relationship was on the ropes too, given that they were former lovers and failing musicians, with Lennox recalling it was written immediately after a bitter fight they'd had.\n\n\"I thought it was the end of the road and that was that,\" she said. \"We were trying to write, and I was miserable. And he just went, well, 'I'll do this anyway.'\"\n\nDid the music video help Eurythmics break America?\n\nIn short, the music video for 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' helped the Eurythmics to make a huge impact in the US.\n\nLike most British bands during the early 1980s, MTV acted as a gateway to superstardom if an artist had the right components.\n\nWith Annie Lennox's cropped, bright orange hair and tailored black suit, American audiences were exposed to a female presented as androgynous for the first time.\n\nHer appearance alongside the iconic synth-pop beat and catchy vocal line made the Eurythmics instant superstars.\n\nWhy was there a cow in the music video, and what did it mean?\n\nThe cow in the music video for 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' was Dave Stewart's idea, who was inspired by surrealist artists like Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel.\n\n\"A few people were saying, 'Dave, why the cow? Annie is so good-looking'\" he later commented. \"Those people should go buy a copy of Purple Cow by Seth Dogin, about how to make your business remarkable. It was written 20 years after I had the purple cow in our video - which certainly did the trick and made my whole life remarkable.\"\n\nNot only did the cow baffle fans at the time, it also caused several logistical problems as there wasn't any major studios that could accommodate such animals, so the music video was shot in a London basement.\n\nAnnie Lennox admitted filming in a basement with a cow was one of the most surreal experiences of her life, saying: \"The video is a statement about the different forms of existence. Here are humans, with our dreams of industry and achievement and success. And here is a cow.\"\n\nHow did the song perform when it was released?\n\n'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' was released on 21st January 1982, but was locked out of the top spot in the UK charts by Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart'.\n\nThough the single was the Eurythmics breakthrough on this side of the Atlantic, it wouldn't be released in the US as the label heads deemed the track unsuitable for release as there was no obvious chorus.\n\nIt was only because the song generated a following due to a local DJ in Cleveland who began playing it that RCA eventually released it in the United States.\n\nEventually released in May 1983 in the US, 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' slowly climbed to the top of the Billboard US charts.\n\nThe song is consistently voted one of the most iconic songs from the decade, and helped Eurythmics become a global success.\n\nWho else has covered ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)’?\n\nCountless artists have covered 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' since it was originally released.\n\nThe most known versions from other artists are MIKA, Leona Lewis, Nouvelle Vague, Bat For Lashes, and Yo La Tengo.\n\nIt was Marilyn Manson's 1995 cover that was the biggest charting success however, becoming the gender-bending goth rocker's first major breakthrough hit."
