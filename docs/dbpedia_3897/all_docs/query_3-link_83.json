        "text": "She truly is the Angel of our Dreams üëº‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSince Little Mix started their hiatus back in May 2022, fans of Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall have been calling out for their solo music - and the girls have not disappointed! July 2024 has seen the release of Jade's debut solo track 'Angel Of My Dreams', so here's the low down on everything you need to know.\n\nWhile Leigh-Anne has released songs including 'Don't Say Love', and Perrie putting out her debut solo song 'Forget About Us' co-written by Ed Sheeran, Jade has been teasing us with studio pics for months. Now that her debut solo single is here, get clued up on Jade's solo career so far right here.\n\nJuly 2024: 'Angel Of My Dreams'\n\nJade's first solo track 'Angel Of My Dreams' has most certainly NOT disappointed - with the pop/dance banger embedding into our brains almost immediately! Taking to Instagram on the day of release, Jade wrote: 'Angel Of My Dreams is officially out in the world and I don‚Äôt know whether to cry or laugh ... üòÇ\n\n'This song means everything to me - my love/hate letter to the music industry, telling my story from the beginning of my journey to now. It‚Äôs the perfect introduction and launch into my world as a solo artist so buckle ... up lolllll.' (sic)\n\nWhen did Jade Thirlwall release solo music?\n\nThe wait is finally over! Jade announcing on 2nd July 2024 that her debut solo single would drop just over two weeks later on 19th July.\n\nJade's first solo track is called 'Angel Of My Dreams', with the singer sharing a short clip of the song to showcase her sound and what we can expect from her future solo music.\n\nStarting off sounding like a more melodic ballad, the song soon switches to a more bass-heavy dance track, which is sure to get fans dancing. The track is described as 'frenetically shapeshifting', as well as 'gloriously OTT', with Jade expressing that she is: \"Setting the tone of who I am as an artist on my own.\"\n\nSpeaking about her solo music, Jade said: \"What I'm going for is a pop punch to the face. I want people to be like 'oh my god, I didn't expect that' ‚Äì but then want to listen to it again\", with her continuing: \"I didn't want to do a safe first single\".\n\nJade teases that the wait is over\n\nPrior to the announcement of 'Angel Of My Dreams', 27th June 2024 saw the biggest tease to date at that point. Taking to her social channels to share a teaser video, Jade wrote: 'No more \"soon\" jadeofficial.com'.\n\nIn the Reel, a still pic of Jade wearing a long dress can be seen falling backwards, while other clips of her prepping her solo music play in the background, accompanied by a song, which slows down as the video finishes, heightening the anticipation.\n\nAfter posting this video fans and celebrity friends have been leaving messages of excitement. Little Mix bandmates Perrie and Leigh-Anne wrote: 'Ahhhh she‚Äôs coming!!!! üòçüëèüèª', and 'Arghhhhhhhhhh I'm screaming! Literally screaming! Let's go my girl üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•', (sic).\n\nMeanwhile songwriter Kamille commented: 'Yassssssüî•üî•üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è'. (sic) And Olly Alexander said: 'let‚Äôs goooooo'. (sic)\n\nWhat did Jade say about her new music?\n\nIn May 2024, Jade took to Instagram to tell her fans: 'I‚Äôm working laaaaate cos I‚Äôm a singer'. (sic) In the photo dump of pics and videos, which are very varied, Jade can be seen wearing some headphones, sitting on a tube, and singing in a mirror-selfie video in front of some bunk beds.\n\nHer former bandmate Leigh-Anne commented: 'Drop the album already', and a fan wrote: 'Jade, when's the new music coming?'. Another said: 'CANT WAIT FOR YOUR SOLO!!!' (sic)\n\nBack in March 2024, Jade shared another photo dump, which included a video of herself posing next to the microphone in a recording studio. Although there was no sound in the short clip, fans were quick to share their excitement over the possibility of solo music from Jade in the comments section.\n\nOne person wrote: 'she's in the booth nobody panic !!' Another fan said: 'we NEED that second clip unmuted.' Someone else commented: 'can't wait to see your debut single', whilst one person said: 'patiently waiting for music'. (sic)\n\nThis came after Jade previously shared a blurred photo to her Instagram Stories, writing on the photo 'proof for the fans that I'm in the studio finishing songs not just doing tik toks dw teehe'. (sic)\n\nMeanwhile, back in November 2023 Jade shared a series of pics to her 10 million followers as she told her fans: 'Ayeayeayeaye'. (sic) One photo showed Jade standing in front of a bookshelf with several awards, including BRITs and MTV Awards, whilst another photo showed her wearing headphones as she stood in what looked like a studio, with a microphone in front of her.\n\nThe others photos featured the singer's boyfriend Rizzle Kicks star Jordan Stephenson and her mum Norma.\n\nAt the time, fans were quick to call out for more information on Jade's solo music, with one writing: 'WE WANT MUSIC!!!!', and another commenting: 'We need the album Jade ‚ù§Ô∏è'.\n\nWill she be releasing an album?\n\nJade hasn't revealed many details just yet about her full album, however she has been working away in the studio on multiple tracks, and told us she has a name for it, and what the influences are behind it.\n\nIn an interview on KISS, with Ellie Prohan she said: \"I think this album as a whole is about me, kind of I wanted to literally sound like I'm finding myself and this experimentation of sounds and influences and genres.\n\n\"Why not have a chaotic first pop album? You know, and let the fans in on that experience, and it's been so fun to make genuinely.\n\n\"You know, obviously there's the slow songs on there, but there's I'd say a lot of the musical influences on the record as a whole are like the stuff I listened to growing up, which would be a bit of like Diana Ross, but then mixed him with, like Cascada, mixed in with a bit of Janet.\n\n\"I mean, so it's definitely a merging of the stuff I was inspired by growing up.\"\n\nSpeaking about the album's name, she said: \"I definitely will not be allowed to tell you that yet.\"\n\nShe went on to reveal: \"I've known the title since the I first did like my first session for this album. Yeah, I knew straight away what I wanted to call it so...\"\n\nWill she be collaborating with other artists?\n\nAlthough Jade hasn't released any details about a full album just yet, including if she has collaborated with any other artists, previous rumours have surrounded her working with Jax Jones.\n\nJax previously said: \"I was in the studio with Jade and she is mega-cool and super-talented. She is also such fun to be around. We wrote something really cool so hopefully that can come out too.\"\n\nBack in 2021, the pair were snapped in a recording studio together, and Jade told us: \"We just had a cheeky session a while back, I still haven't even heard the song to be honest, but I know it's a good'en, whatever we wrote together.\"\n\nTake a look through Jade Thirlwall's career:\n\nNow read:\n\nJade Thirlwall: Everything you need to know about the Little Mix singer üíï\n\nJade Thirlwall hints there could be a collab with Calvin Harris in the works\n\n18 times Jade Thirlwall and her mum Norma were the CUTEST on Instagram ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
