        "text": "New Jersey-raised artist Fletcher, who we've mentioned on two of our 2022 Pride lists, has announced her debut studio album. It's called GIRL OF MY DREAMS and will be out September 16.\n\nThe album's release is previewed by the new single \"Her Body Is Bible,\" and will be followed by a lengthy U.S. tour. The trek includes stops in Atlanta, Boston, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Denver, Portland, and more. More information can be found here.\n\nIn a press statement, Fletcher said of the album, “So much of my past work has been focused on other people and on my relationships: all the people who have broken my heart, all the hearts that I’ve broken. For my debut album it felt right to do a deeper dive into self-exploration, and all the different facets that make up who I am.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I wanted it to be the most honest, raw, and complete representation of the complex and sensitive-ass Pisces that I’ve always been. It took a long time and a lot of reflection to create a body of work like that, but it’s important to me that my music comes directly from lived experience.”\n\nSo far in her career, Fletcher has released a string of singles and EPs since 2016. That year, she released the EP Finding Fletcher, in 2019 she dropped the EP you ruined new york city for me, and in 2020 she released her third EP THE S(EX) TAPES. She also had a song on the soundtrack for Promising Young Woman, titled \"Last Laugh.\"\n\nGIRL OF MY DREAMS will contain 13 tracks total. You can pre-save it here.\n\nListen to \"Her Body Is Bible\" and see Fletcher's album announcement below.\n\nCheck out our selection of free stations streaming Fletcher music at Live365.com.\n\nRather listen on our app?
