        "text": "Katy Perry becomes the first woman, and second artist overall following Michael Jackson, in the 53-year history of the Billboard Hot 100 to send five songs from an album to No. 1, as “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” becomes the fifth chart leader from her Capitol Records set “Teenage Dream.”\n\nThe historic Hot 100 coronation follows the album’s prior No. 1s “California Gurls” (featuring Snoop Dogg), the lead single from “Teenage Dream,”; the title cut; “Firework”; and, “E.T.” (featuring Kanye West). The set bowed atop the Billboard 200 album chart dated Sept. 11, 2010, and has sold 1.7 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nBillboard Exclusive: Katy Perry Responds to Making Hot 100 History\n\n“Hitting No. 1 is always a great moment, but when it turns into a small piece of history, you’re reminded of how many millions of people are connected to each other by even one tiny event,” she tells Billboard in an exclusive statement. “Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen. Ever since I was 9 years old, singing into my hairbrush, I’ve dreamed very big dreams, but today is bigger than my dreams. What a nice first birthday present for ‘Teenage Dream’!”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nWhile Perry is the first woman to achieve the honor, she is the second artist to manage the feat after Jackson. The late King of Pop sent five songs to No. 1 on the Hot 100 from “Bad” in 1987-88: “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You” (with Siedah Garrett); the title track; “The Way You Make Me Feel”; “Man in the Mirror”; and, “Dirty Diana.”\n\nKaty Perry Poll: What’s Your Favorite ‘Teenage Dream’ Single?\n\nJackson notched his quintet of No. 1s from “Bad” over nine months and two weeks. Perry’s five toppers from “Dream” spans one year, two months and one week, dating to the first week at No. 1 for “Gurls” on the Hot 100 dated June 19, 2010. (The newest Hot 100 is dated Aug. 27, 2011).\n\nWhile Jackson earned the achievement more quickly, Perry has spent more time atop the Hot 100 in each artist’s respective commanding stretch: Jackson’s five No. 1s from “Bad” totaled a combined seven weeks in charge. With the first week on top for “Friday,” Perry is up to 18 total weeks at No. 1 with her No. 1s from “Dream.”\n\nPhotos: Katy Perry’s 30 Most Outrageous Outfits\n\nFollowing “Gurls,” which reigned atop the Hot 100 for six weeks, the title song from “Dream” began a two-week command on the chart dated Sept. 18, 2010. “Firework” spent four weeks at No. 1 beginning Dec. 18, 2010, and “E.T.” landed at the apex for five weeks starting April 9, 2011.\n\nPerry’s streak of five Hot 100 No. 1 singles promoted to radio is the most by a lead artist since Mariah Carey scored a similar run in 1990-91. Whitney Houston holds the chart record with seven consecutive leaders in 1985-88.\n\nAdditionally highlighting Perry’s stretch of dominance, she has inhabited the Hot 100’s top 10 for an unprecedented 66 consecutive weeks, dating to the arrival of “Gurls.” Perry shattered the prior mark of 48 straight frames in the top 10, set by Ace of Base in 1993-94.\n\n“Friday” takes over the Hot 100 summit by spending a second week atop Radio Songs, registering 148 million in all-format audience (up 1%), according to Nielsen BDS. The song rebounds 5-4 on Digital Songs with 156,000 downloads sold (up 14%), according to SoundScan.\n\nKaty’s ‘Last Friday’ Remix Featuring Missy Elliott: Listen\n\nCapitol last week released a remix of “Friday” featuring Missy Elliott. The remix accounted for 25% of the song’s overall digital sales in the Aug. 8-14 sales tracking week; it was discounted to 69 cents at the iTunes and Amazon mp3 stores in that span.\n\n“Friday” spent two weeks at No. 1 on Digital Songs in early July following the premiere of its eight-minute-plus video which features cameos from the likes of musicians Rebecca Black, Kenny G, Debbie Gibson and Hanson and actors Corey Feldman, Darren Criss and Kevin McHale, the latter two of whom star in Fox’s “Glee.” The clip has registered 80 million views on YouTube.\n\nPerry ascends to Hot 100 history by displacing LMFAO‘s “Party Rock Anthem,” featuring Lauren Bennett and GoonRock, after the song spent six weeks at No. 1. The track dips to No. 2, slipping 1-2 on Digital Songs (160,000, down 13%) and holding at No. 2 on Radio Songs (142 million, down 3%).\n\nAt No. 3 on the Hot 100, Maroon 5‘s “Moves Like Jagger,” featuring Christina Aguilera, bounds up five places with dual Digital and Airplay Gainer awards. “Jagger” swaggers 2-1 on Digital Songs (219,000, up 38%) and 32-18 on Radio Songs (47 million, 37%) following the premiere of its video Aug. 8.\n\nBillboard 200: Jay-Z & Kanye West’s ‘Throne’ Sells 436,000\n\nRounding out the Hot 100’s top 10 are Nicki Minaj‘s “Super Bass” (3-4); Bad Meets Evil’s “Lighters,” featuring Bruno Mars (5-5); Lil Wayne‘s “How to Love” (6-6); Pitbull‘s “Give Me Everything,” featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer (4-7); Foster the People’s “Pumped Up Kicks” (13-8) (the chart’s sole title making its first top 10 appearance; it led Alternative Songs for five weeks beginning in June); Britney Spears‘ “I Wanna Go” (7-9); and, OneRepublic’s former No. 8-peaking “Good Life” (11-10).\n\nAll charts, including the Hot 100, Digital Songs and Radio Songs will be refreshed tomorrow (Aug. 18) on Billboard.com."
