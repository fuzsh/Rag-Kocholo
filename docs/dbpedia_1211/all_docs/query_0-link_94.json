        "text": "Column writing can be difficult. I have lots of ideas, but sometimes I can't stretch them out to more than 500 words.\n\nThis week I've decided to take a cue from one of my old column-columns and share some random observations that I couldn't quite make work as full-fledged pieces.\n\nI'll do better next time. I swear.\n\n— I have too many records. So many, in fact, that I could listen to one every day for more than two years and never listen to the same record twice. Some people might say this borders on the obsessive, but I choose to believe I'm just thorough.\n\n— Moving records is hard. The sheer weight of them is enough to make some people refrain from ever starting a collection in the first place. According to Google, a stack of 100 of them weighs 46 pounds, which means my collection weighs too much. Less than one of the McCrary twins, yes, but still too much.\n\n— The cover can be the entire reason you buy the record. However, if the cover is exceptional, the music often does not live up to the expectations it raises. I would like to write a column about my favorite album covers, but they would either be too cliched, or not printable in a family newspaper.\n\n— Like album covers, bands can sometimes not live up to their own hype. The Beatles are not an example of this, but many of the other bands people consider iconic I consider middling. I'm looking at you, the Grateful Dead.\n\n— Incidentally, one of the funniest things I ever heard was in the music section at a Barnes & Noble store. A tiny child pointed to a book about The Dead, and her dad said in the nicest way possible, \"Oh, honey, that's a dumb band.\"\n\n— I don't care how Paul McCartney feels, Mark Lewisohn is the Beatles' best biographer by a landslide. I just wish he would finish his second (and then third) volume.\n\n— I would love to do a column about Captain Beefheart's avant garde work, but given that the titles of some of these albums (\"Trout Mask Replica,\" \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\") are their most accessible aspect, this probably will not happen.\n\n— I once stopped a party cold by putting on a Captain Beefheart album. People were not appreciative, but I would do it again.\n\n— The worst record label I've ever encountered is 4 Men with Beards. The albums it reissues are often classics, but the pressings are so bad that you would be much better off listening to a low-quality CD of the same recording. And that's saying something.\n\n— Discogs is one of my favorite websites/apps, but I'm confused about something. Some bootlegs are available for sale on its marketplace feature, and some aren't, the reason being that they are bootlegs. So why do they sell some and not others? It's annoying, if for no other reason than I need to get a copy of Monster A Go-Go, a collection of Japanese rock tracks from the 1960s, and it's not available there.\n\n— When I reached 100 records I thought I had enough. The same thing happened when I reached 200, 300, 400, etc. I have come to the conclusion that I will never have enough. I am fine with this. Maybe.\n\nThis week's playlist:\n\nThe Milkman of Human Kindness — Billy Bragg\n\nAcross the Universe — David Bowie\n\nTrue Affection — Father John Misty\n\nTrouble Every Day — The Mothers of Invention\n\nWalk On — Neil Young\n\nOne Dyin' and a Buryin' — Roger Miller\n\nLiving Without You — Harry Nilsson\n\nCrazy Face — Van Morrison\n\nStephanie Says — The Velvet Underground\n\nI Believe — Stevie Wonder"
