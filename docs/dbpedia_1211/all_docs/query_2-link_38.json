        "text": "With Slipknot supposedly releasing a new album in 2019 I can’t think of a better time to start looking through their discography beginning with 1999’s self titled album, Slipknot…\n\nPersonally I feel that when an artist uses their own name for a title of an album the best time to do it is on a debut album. On Slipknot’s 1999 album, Slipknot, using the bands name for a title makes the most sense to me as this album serves as an introduction to Slipknot in the best way possible. This album seems to capture the core of the band which is even more impressive considering the album is 20 years old this year. While the band certainly aren’t the same band they were when they recorded this album it still feels like years later this album manages to get at the root of the band and what they’re about.\n\nMusically this is one of the heaviest albums the band have recorded taking influence from thrash metal, heavy metal and industrial metal. There are even elements of rap-rock which is something that has slowly worked its way out of the bands sound over the years which is a shame as on this record when it is used it’s really unique and interesting to hear a rap-style delivery in a metal song. The obvious example of this is Spit It Out which has become iconic in the bands discography. The mixture of vocalist Corey Taylor’s unclean vocals performed with a hip-hop flow is really interesting and really adds to the aggression, the lyrics also have a very smooth flow and give the song a really nice pace.\n\nThe sampling by Craig Jones and the turntables by Sid Wilson really are a large part of what makes Slipknot stand out and gives the band their unique sound. Their presence is felt in full force on the self titled album and from the start they helped give Slipknot their unique sound. Look to tracks like (sic), Eyeless and Tattered & Torn for examples of the impact they have on the band.\n\nThe more electronic elements of the band help give the album a disjointed almost industrial sound that really adds to the horror aspect of the album as much of this album feels like it could be in the soundtrack to a horror film. This is especially true of the song Prosthetics, a track I don’t hear a lot of people talk about and often goes overlooked. The instrumental opening gives off a sense of unease which is then followed by Corey Taylor’s mumbled vocals which again add to the horror feeling. Even when his unclean vocals come in you can still hear quiet mumbling in the back ground which still creates this horror vibe. Even more so when the deranged laughing comes in around the three quarters mark.\n\nThe eight minuet track Scissors its brilliantly dark and again captures the bands more theatrical side as the track relies a lot on creating a creepy atmosphere before hitting the listener full force with its aggression in a vicious and brutal manner. I especially love when the music cuts out leaving Corey’s voice isolated. Almost like an eye of the storm effect when the listener is given a moment of calm before being hit full force again when the music picks back up and Taylor lets loose with the vocals in an almost animalistic manner.\n\nIf I did have any issues with the album I would say that some songs get overshadowed by others on the album. Diluted for example is a track I find myself forgetting about as it doesn’t stand out as much as other songs. The distorted vocals on the track do sound good but this album is full of other songs which use the distorted vocals in more interesting ways. The music also doesn’t make the song stand out that much, with the exception of some whistling sounds which are an interesting choice but don’t do much for me personally. I also feel Scissors works much better as a closing track than the hidden track Eeyore, which is still a good track but doesn’t fit as well as Scissors does as a closing track.\n\nAlso while I have praised the album for it’s aggression and harsh vocals I do feel that lyrically this album overall isn’t as good as later releases by the band. Personally for me I don’t mind that some of the songs have weaker lyrics as this album is more about the instrumentation and a hell of a good vocal performance from Corey Taylor. However I still feel that while not an issue for me I could see how other people looking for a more lyric-driven album could take issue with the bands debut.\n\nWhile not perfect this is still an incredibly strong first outing for the band. The record still holds up and is still an important milestone in the bands discography and well worth the listen for any fan of modern metal. The highlights of this album really are the vocals and the music and any flaws this album may posses are far outweighed by the positives.\n\nScore: 4/5\n\nFavourite Songs: (sic), Eyeless, Spit It Out, Liberate, Scissors\n\nLeast Favourites: Diluted, No Life, Purity"
