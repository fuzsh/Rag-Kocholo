        "text": "hii! I’m the creator of cycles (VOIDCYCLES) someone recently posted something about my album in a concert group on roblox and many people are being misled by it! my album is not real, it is fan made and just a project that somehow got pretty popular amongst the wiki! I am not lying, this isn’t a rumor, it is simply a fan made album on a fan made wiki![]\n\n\"How do I say this politely?\"\n\nCYCLES has been nominated for the 2023 Ginger Bread Man Award!\n\n❝𝕮𝖆𝖓 𝖂𝖊 𝕵𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝕭𝖊 𝕳𝖔𝖓𝖊𝖘𝖙?❞\n\nCYCLES has been nominated for Valentines Awards 2024\n\nBy this label, VOIDCYCLES has finished this page & album.[]\n\nCYCLES (stylized in all uppercase) is the fourth studio album by Melanie Martinez, It was released on July 17th, 2025. Following the albums release, July 27th, 2025, The album was re-released with 4 new bonus tracks and a super deluxe pack. This is the first Melanie album to have been made in 2 years and also the first super deluxe album from the talented creator.\n\nBackground[]\n\nCoinciding with the release of PORTALS in March 2023, during an interview with a magazine outlet, Melanie announced how she had planned out her next album after PORTALS, “I have my next album planned out, as far as what I want to do – same with the album after that and they also both have super deluxes attached to them.\"\n\n2023[]\n\nDuring an Instagram Q&A on June 24th, 2023, where Melanie asked fans for questions relating to her musical future in the new year, a fan asked \"Will we have a new album seperate from PORTALS? Maybe a film, singles, a new EP, or music videos?” Melanie replied, \"I'm planning on putting out music videos for this year. As for the next album and film I make, it will be attached to my third album in some kind of way and that will probably take a while to conjure up.\"\n\nIn an interview with a magazine outlet, Melanie touched on Cry Baby's growth in her upcoming projects: \"She's gonna be evolving and transforming more, Her growth isn’t going to be as literal as PORTALS, She’s not gonna have several million different bodies, you know, it’s not going to be like that, even if it was, I wouldn’t be able to showcase them all. But… Shes definitely going to get more into depth with herself and really understand the universe around her and how it works, Haha. but I can’t say anything or else it’ll be a spoiler, enjoy that! *Melanie laughs*”\n\nIn an interview with a talk host, Melanie was asked \"What can fans expect from your in-the-works music?\" and she responded with, “A completely new realm and perspective within her past works, there is currently going to be many changes and opportunities for crybaby to continue growing.” stating how her future music would be different from her past work.\n\nIn a Q&A, Melanie shared something that broke and also inspired her fans. A fan asked her, “What will happen to crybaby for your 5th album? Will her story continue or will it not?” Melanie responded with, “Sadly, for my 5th album.. Crybaby’s soul will give out. Her light bulb will stop shining, and letting her rest in everlasting sleep where her soul will be only remembered as an artifact in the spiritual realm, she will be history. Her soul will diminish into the air, putting all her memories to rest, CYRANIUM. 💗”\n\nOn September 26th, 2023, Melanie revealed on the Travis Mills Show that she would be making the album with the same producers who helped on her debut album, Cry Baby, commenting on her session with Kinetics and OneLove that was already booked. In the same interview, she also stated that the movie would \"ratio out\" to have \"more film than musical scenes and a better diameter and storyline/plot than K-12, put out the characters feelings and emotions aswell as fixating the viewers perception on the each of the characters perspective.”\n\nOn December 4th, 2023, during an interview with Hollywood Life, Melanie revealed that the fourth album will \"pick up\" where the third one “left off” with a cliffhanger, saying that: “You’re not going to see like a song from PORTALS in the next album, it’s not gonna be like that type of picking up, but it will be technically picking up from where it left off.” This could mean a different idea where Crybaby was presumed as a siren in MILK OF THE SIREN, maybe the siren was the body after Crybaby’s second body, the songs each taking place within the different bodies crybaby has?\n\n2024[]\n\nOn January 4th, 2024 during an interview with the Grammy Museum, Melanie confirmed that there will be 13 maybe 14 tracks on the album, Within the same interview, Melanie once again stated that Cry Baby would \"go into cycles of death and life.”\n\nOn February 14th, 2024, Melanie posted multiple Instagram photos sharing her experience in Washington in regards to the creation of the album, with a caption writing:\n\n🌲🌧️❄️\n\nIn my little forest, isolated for a month in Washington, covered in rain and evergreen trees surrounding me, releasing rain water fragrances into the damp forest, Im writing an album I feel is crucial to make. No human interaction, just relishing in the feeling and fragrance of a wet forest, pushing my motivation to the highest high ✨✨✨✨ When I create it is freeing and rewarding. Releasing past feelings from past moments and past lives, by keeping the energy at bay to be able to co-create with the universe something that will be felt, seen, related, and heard in the future.\n\nUntil then, I will breathe in rainwater and wet soil to bring you the most worthiest album. 🌲\n\nAdditionally, in one of the slides of the Instagram post, she was seen performing/singing an unknown song. This was later confirmed as \"RAIN” She then proceeded to post multiple Instagram stories describing the process of CYCLES:\n\nI was reincarnated to be here, was rebirthed once again and transformed. My heart pounds at the sight of the trees swaying in the dark rainy forest outside my huge glass windows, reminding me to wake up and feed into natures soul to relish my writing in love. Couldn't have dreamt of a more sacred space to create this album. Only ever coming here to finish this project. 🌲🍾🌲\n\nSo many deep layers of this album was unlocked here🥺 I feel beyond tapped in with my universal guiders and ancestors and truly believe that every melody and every lyric on this record came straight from them.\n\nAlso in 2024, Melanie was also seen on an Instagram story dancing, recording, and singing to an unknown song from her third album. The song was later confirmed to be \"APOLLO”\n\nOn March 31st, 2024, Melanie replied to a comment on TikTok saying that the album would be released in a little later in 2025.\n\n2025[]\n\nOn December 6th, 2024 Melanie stated she would try to release the album's first single during March or April. On February 21st, 2024, during a meet and greet, Melanie confirmed that the album would have 13 songs and some form of a deluxe/super deluxe. She also stated that the lead single would be released sometime in spring 2025 along with a music video, and there would be no featured artists on the album. Additionally, she said that she would like to create music videos for her favorite songs on the album, and release the deluxe/super deluxe seperate from the album, although the deluxe and super deluxe made it into the album either way.\n\nOn March 14th, 2025, Melanie Martinez posted a photo shoot she did with Verde, Following this, Coach Wave proceeded to post a behind-the-scenes video of the shoot to his Instagram, captioning the post \"VINES” After a fan had asked if the song was the album's lead single, Melanie replied with:\n\nno, that was just a random song idea that never got finished that got leaked - the actual songs I will be putting out this year yall haven't even heard yet 💗\n\nOn April 23rd, 2025, Melanie posted an Instagram story, where she announced that the album is in the mixing stage and that she hopes to release it in the following months. In the same story, she also said that she will put out a couple of songs and music videos within the month to start the new era.\n\nRelease & Promotion[]\n\nThe promotion for CYCLES was somewhat extraordinary to her previous album, PORTALS in March 2023. A selection of snippets were released alongside animated visuals to tease the upcoming project. On April 30th, 2025, a song was distributed among streaming services under Melanie's name, titled \"birth” which would later turn out to be an edited variant of the song “MLEKO” the lead single for the album. Within this, another snippet of the same track was posted to her social medias, each titled with different words. the word for this track was, “birth”\n\nA visual accompanied this snippet, which featured a virtual scene in a forest, with a large candle as the main subject. The words \"born with love” can be seen carved into said candle, confirming the fictional birth of Melanie's most popular character once again, She had archived all of her previous posts - and even changed most of her YouTube video thumbnails to a screenshot of the visual - furthermore driving the point that her prior work regarding Cry Baby was deprecated. This would be the first fans would know regarding the album.\n\nThe following day, a pattern began to emerge. A new snippet was uploaded to Melanie's social medias, this time captioned “choose with love” Also uploaded with an animation and secondary image, the location \"CYCLES” was tagged onto the Instagram post - just as the first snippet was. Due to this, fans were starting to speculate the album's title. As the next day arrived, a new snippet did as well. \"discarded with hatred” was posted on June 2nd, 2025 featuring a pale, obviously dead split haired woman and a pale pink skinned alien aside each other as its animation, also including a secondary image.\n\nNow that the fanbase knew they could expect a new single each day, they also noticed a story line forming. Each snippet's visualization depicted a new era of this transforming soul, beginning with the death of Cry Baby, then minimal molecular development, and then a significant embryo. The videos were telling a story of the rebirth of Cry Baby. \"ridden with energy” would be the next snippet to arrive, featuring a video of different creatures reaching out from the soil, presumably their graves, to protect a little bubble of energy swirls, likely Cry Baby’s soul. This was assumed to be what encased the rebirthing Cry Baby in its death and life phase, rejuvenating to birth into a new body.\n\nOn June 3rd, 2025, Melanie posted an Instagram story announcing that the \"Rebirthing\" of the soul of Cry Baby was soon-to-come in the next 12 hours. When the time limit was reached, a live-action video was posted, depicting Melanie, dressed as the same creature as the prior body, except she had 5 eyes and swirls of purple across her body. She had been breaking out of the wet soil. It is somewhat important to note this was on the 3rd, which reads as the date as a number Melanie has referred to a lot as a transforming and evolving number to her, alongside 222, 333 is her evolving number.\n\nOn this day, the title, cover art and release date were also announced, as well as some details regarding the album's lead single. Some details included that it would release the 17th, a month and 10 days before the albums release.\n\nAfter announcing some of the main details about CYCLES, articles started to resurface on the internet with the then just released news. In most of them, Melanie described the album with a phrase, saying: \"Cycles is like saying, death and life cycles, death and life phases, we’re all the same.”\n\nOn June 14th, 2025 Spotify sent out an email to Melanie's top fans containing a message from Melanie announcing a limited edition cassette of CYCLES. There were only 3,000 copies of the cassette which were available for fans to purchase until June 25th at 2:22pm EST or while supplies last.\n\nOn June 16th, 2025, a day before the release of \"MLEKO” Melanie announced the track list on her official website. She shared the link though an Instagram story. The page contained lyric pages to each track on the album, one by one, the tracks' lyrics would be revealed everyday. However, MLEKO’s lyrics were locked for an unknown reason.\n\nOn June 23rd, 2025, Melanie performed at a live festival, She performed twelve songs in total, seven of them being from her upcoming album. Following her performances, several of the song's titles became trending on Twitter, such as \"ALIVE” and “COSMIC”, Users said ‘ALIVE’ sounded something you’d hear when spirits went to war, a K-12 sounding song, while ‘COSMIC’ sounded a lot like NYMPHOLOGY, a song on Melanie’s previous album, PORTALS.\n\nOn June 24th, 2025 Melanie performed at Lollapalooza in Chile at the Axe Stage, She performed twelve songs in total, five of them being from her upcoming album.\n\nOn June 17th, 2025 Melanie announced the lead single for the album, \"MLEKO” revealing the cover art on Instagram as well as confirming the release date (June 17th) of the track.\n\nOn June 25th, 2025, A CYCLES Global Listening Event was hosted in local indie record stores around the world. It was announced on the same day “MLEKO”’s audio version was released. People got to listen to the album before its release, including exclusive giveaways for the album. All events were free. A few hours later, Melanie announced that the \"MLEKO” music video would be released the next day on June 26th.\n\nOn July 25th, 2025, Melanie released “NEPTUNE” as the second single, just two days before the album was released.\n\nOn July 7th, 2025, people from the United States began to notice posters of Cry Baby displayed in some places. The poster contains a large text asking: \"HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CREATURE?\", and a phone number, \"TEXT (917) 810-3395\". After texting, it will send an automated message saying: \"THIS IS NOT A JOKE! If you’re reading this right now, I’m so sorry. :((( 6 years ago a girl named Cry Baby was sent to a boarding school by her mother, to where she died there. Send this poster to 22 people or she’ll hypnotize you and drag you into the afterlife with her. Be careful!!!”\n\nOn July 9th, 2025, Melanie updated her Instagram bio to include lyrics from a previously leaked song, teasing its release along with the deluxe. The description of \"teen beats\" playlist on Spotify also hinted the theme of that song. Later on, Melanie posted on Spotify, \"stream to unlock dlx🚨\", following with a forwarded text to every person who saved the contact from the posters, \"🌲🕸️🌧️ TONIGHT 9pm PST/12am EST\", emojis indicating the song as \"CHANGE”\n\nCandle Creation[]\n\nStarting on June 2nd, a new promotion strategy “Candle Creation” was introduced, and implied continuously. It was posted as a single video to honor Martinez’s 4th album, CYCLES. It was a virtual fantasy video of a large lit candle, with energy swirls and galactic energy swirling uncontrollably around it. Specks of purple and green orbited the candle, a heliosphere around the candle. As many said, the candle must’ve represented the universe, the fire represented the sun, and the molecular specks were representing planets. Energy balls suddenly twisted and turned, gasses overpowering each other and sending a ray directly into the soil. The soil seemed to defend itself, flares shooting back out. Suddenly the soil shook, and Crybaby’s soul was born. A pink and purple swirly hand reached out of the soil until it was pulled back in, the video ending.\n\nLyrics of “CONSTELLATIONS” was pasted below.\n\nWas it all for a stupid game?\n\nPushing back my emotions till I feel pain.\n\nIve tread your waters lightly.\n\nWill you ever fucking treat me nicely?\n\nInto the soil, orbiting the candle.\n\nConstellations right up above my eyes,\n\nReaching out to knead on the handle.\n\nLyric Reveal Page.[]\n\nThe lyric reveal page was a list of all tracks on the album and their lyrics. The lyric reveal page was first announced on June 17th through Melanie Martinez's Instagram stories and it officially confirmed the track list for CYCLES. The page was updated roughly on a daily basis, providing a track's lyrics one at a time for the most part.\n\n17 June 2025 Following the single release of \"MLEKO” the lyric page link was shared on Martinez's Instagram stories, featuring the lyrics for \"MLEKO”\n\nRoughly the next day, the lyric page for \"MLEKO” was locked with no reasons, but two days later, the lyrics for \"NEPTUNE” revealed.\n\n20 June 2025 The lyric page locked \"MLEKO and unlocked \"NEPTUNE” officially revealing lyrics to the song.\n\nThis cleared up confusion amongst Martinez's fans who speculated the lyrics \"NEPTUNE” featured \"Neptune’s cold sinner bubble” instead of the actual lyrics: \"Neptune’s cold inner bubble”\n\n21 June 2025: The lyric page locked \"NEPTUNE” and unlocked \"DROPLETS” officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n22 June 2025: The lyric page locked \"DROPLETS”and unlocked \"ALIVE” officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n23 June 2025: The lyric page locked \"ALIVE” and unlocked “FAERI” officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n24 June 2025: The lyric page locked \"FAERI\" and unlocked \"VISION\", officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n27 June 2025: After two dormant days, the lyric page eventually locked \"VISION\" and unlocked \"VENE” officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n28 June 2025: Seemingly returning to the \"day-to-day\" releases with only a few tracks left, the lyric page locked \"VENE” and unlocked \"APOLLO”\n\n29 June 2025: The lyric page locked \"APOLLO” and unlocked \"CONNECT” officially revealing the lyrics to the song.\n\n30 June 2025: the lyric page locked \"CONNECT” and unlocked two lyrics for the first time: \"COSMIC\" and \"CREATIONS” revealing the lyrics for the both of the song.\n\n1 July 2025: The lyric page released all the track lyrics all at once.\n\nAt first, Melanie Martinez was releasing lyrics on a daily basis as perceived with the release of \"MLEKO” (elapsed by two days) to \"VISION” However, there was a two day gap before \"VENE” was revealed. Afterwards, daily releases returned until a day before the album release, where both \"COSMIC” and \"CREATIONS”were revealed. Finally, on the album release day, all the lyrics became available at once to the public, along with snippets and music videos. It is unknown whether the lyric page was updated in accordance with local time zones.\n\nCommercial and Chart Performance[]\n\nGlobally, the album was a commercial success. It represents Melanie's highest debut week gross, reaching almost 270.000 copies, 2.2 higher than PORTALS. The album debuted atop the Australian and New Zealand Charts, becoming her first chart-topper in those countries respectively. The album reached the Top 3 in the UK, Scotland, Ireland and the United States becoming her highest charting album in all of them. Elsewhere, the album reached the Top 10 in The Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania. The album also appeared in the Top 30 in both Belgium regions, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nNotably, the album is on track on being Melanie's best selling album to date.\n\nTheme[]\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music, Melanie had revealed the theme of the album, stating:\n\nI wanted to challenge my own’ perspective by essentially just saying: Just like before, after Cry Baby’s vessel on earth has died, she lives on as a spirit in the spiritual realm until her soul picks up a new body to live in temporarily. This was important for me to show the cycles of being a human and humanoid empath creature with this record—to give people hope that there’s more lives to come after this one.\n\nAll of the songs on this album are based on the perceptive I tried for PORTALS, something I did with past life regression books, I read into the cycles of life and death particularly now, which helped me design and create this ethereal project.. All of them disguised with outer world themes for double/triple meaning, to create a frequency for humans to relate to while still here on earth, waiting for our time to come. Melanie Martinez\n\nTour[]\n\nThe link to the tour page is here, CYCLES TOUR\n\nTracklist[]\n\nThere are 13 tracks on the CD with 3 additional on the deluxe version.

When it’s got you, it’s got you.”\n\nThe eighteenth track, “RAIN” doesnt directly mention death, but describes it with a verse. ’I believed when you said, that he’s gonna take care of us.. We thought, you were kind.. And I believed, you were different. You put me through hell and back, when will I ever learn? Put my lifeless body down, stop feasting on my blood. I won’t feed you any more blood to nourish your foresaken body.”\n\n“CONNECT” \"CHANGE” and \"CONSTELLATIONS”, within various others do not follow the same rule.\n\nMelanie revealed in an interview for Apple Music that this album marks the beginning of the total end of Cry Baby's spiritual life. While the first three albums and many EP’S.. Dollhouse EP, Cry Baby Album, Pity Party EP, Cry Baby’s Extra Clutter EP, K-12, After School EP, and PORTALS told the story of Cry Baby's life, CYCLES dived straight into into Cry Baby's afterlife experiences, right before her various rebirths.\n\nThe first song written for this album was \"CHANGE”\n\nThe last song written was \"RAIN”\n\nUnlike with Melanie's past albums, the deluxe tracks do take part in the development of the story, hence them also having transitions between each other.\n\nAll of the tracks will have music videos and the music videos will be released in the order they appear in the tracklist. However, it's likely that this is only for the standard edition tracks, although not exactly confirmed.\n\n“APOLLO and \"CONSTELLATIONS\" are the only tracks in the album that lack a transition.\n\nMelanie has stated that CYCLES is her favorite album to date, and the second one she hasn't grown out of quickly.\n\nMelanie stated that she would not include songs that had leaked before the album's release. However, despite several songs being leaked prior to the album's release, they still made it onto the album.\n\nThese songs include \"MLEKO, \"VISION, \"CONSTELLATIONS\", \"CREATIONS” and \"CHERUBS\" (from the deluxe edition of the album).\n\nThe album was named one of the best albums of 2025 by Rolling Stones.\n\nEXCLUSIVE PAGES[]\n\nTHE FOREST FIRE"
