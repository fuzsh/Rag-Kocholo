        "text": "The fascinating true story of the year in which everything changed in the music business.\n\nThis is the story of a year in which the record business appeared to be firing on all cylinders, when the CD was at its commercial zenith, bringing in staggering sums of money for the global record business. The good times – and they were phenomenal times, both culturally and financially – looked like they would never end for record labels.\n\nYet by December 1999, a bomb had been squarely set under their core business. All was to change with the arrival of digital music delivery.\n\nEamonn will tell the true story and not simply the oft-repeated tale of an industry complacent and caught napping."
