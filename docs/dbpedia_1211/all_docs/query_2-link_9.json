        "text": "\"This is us coming back strong.\"\n\nThis section looks at the 'Euphoria' North American album release. The third album after 'Pyromania' and 'Hysteria' to feature a title ending in 'IA'.\n\n\"Nobody has made a record like this for a long time.\"\n\nDef Leppard released their seventh studio album Euphoria on this day in 1999 in the USA and Canada.\n\nThe album was initially released in the USA and Canada and was one of the first albums to be streamed online.\n\nA special called 'Radio Free Euphoria' was streamed on the band's website from 4th June 1999. On the same day the Red Hot Chili Peppers also streamed their album 'Californication'. One of the first times any artists had done this.\n\nThe album was released in the USA and Canada on 8th June 1999 and went on to chart at Number 11 in the USA.\n\nFollowing it's UK release on 14th June it also peaked at Number 11.\n\nAlbum Recording\n\nWork on album began at Joe's Garage studio in May 1998. The band took a break after the end of the Slang tour in April 1997 during which time Joe and Phil worked with The Spiders From Mars (later to become the Cybernauts). The initial songwriting took place from late 1997 into early 1998.\n\nThe album was recorded with co-producer Pete Woodroffe in Joe's Garage Studios 1 and 2. Rick Allen did not join the band for much of the album sessions and instead recorded his drum parts at his home studio in California as he wanted to be close to his family.\n\nThe sessions went on until March 1999 when the album was completed and then mixed in April. The finished album was handed to the record company for release on 15th April 1999.\n\nClassic Leppard Sound\n\nThe band returned to their trademark sound after the slight detour the >Slang album in 1996. The big vocal harmonies, classic songwriting and pop sensibilities were back in full force on this album.\n\nAlmost rebelling against the grunge era of the mid 90s, the band wanted to recapture the sense of melody, fun and excitement of their biggest records 'Pyromania', 'Hysteria' and 'Adrenalize'.\n\nSingles\n\n'Promises' was the lead single and video from the album. In the UK the band released two CD singles which saw 'Promises' and 'Back In Your Face' used as a Double A Side. Each was the lead track over CD's 1 and 2 though no video was made for 'Back In Your Face'.\n\nA second single was released around the world. The Rick Savage written ballad 'Goodbye'. Both singles failed to reach the UK or US Top 40. Although 'Promises' did reach Number One on the US Rock charts.\n\nReturn Of Mutt Lange\n\nIn keeping with the return to their classic sound producer Mutt Lange returned to work with the band for the first time since his executive producer role on 'Adrenalize'. He worked with the band in Dublin for four days and co-wrote three songs - 'Promises', 'All Night' and 'It's Only Love'.\n\nMutt also played guitar on 'All Night' and contributed backing vocals to that song and 'Promises'. He would go on to work with the band again before the 'Sparkle Lounge' album but the song/songs have yet to be finished or released.\n\nDamon Hill/Guest Appearances\n\nA number of guests appeared on the album. Most notably British Formula 1 driver Damon Hill (the 1996 world champion). Damon lived close to Sav in Dublin and met the band during a party over Christmas 1998. He was invited by Phil (or Pete Woodroffe) to play guitar on an album track. He played the \"ride-out solo\" at the end of 'Demolition Man'.\n\nOther guests included the band '(SIC)'. A three piece fronted by then ex-The Almighty singer Ricky Warwick who sang the HEY's and did handclaps for 'Back In Your Face'. Co-Producer Pete Woodroffe got his first songwriting credits with the band on 'Paper Sun' and 'Guilty'."
