Just days after announcing the album, she revealed during her first 2024 Eras Tour show in Japan on Feb. 7 the project had been in the making since October 2022.\n\n“I’ve been working on it for about two years,” she said. “I kept working on it throughout the U.S. tour, and when it was perfect — in my opinion when it’s good enough for you — I finished it and I am so, so excited that soon you’ll get to hear it.”\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, she said, \"Tortured Poets is an album — I think more than any of my albums that I’ve ever made — I needed to make it. It was really a lifeline for me.\"\n\nMany fans have theorized the album centers around Swift's ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The pair dated for six years before breaking up last year."
