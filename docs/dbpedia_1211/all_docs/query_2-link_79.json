        "text": "Welcome to our new series, Run That Back. This month, we’re publishing one throwback album review per day for releases ranging from one month to a decade old. Each author is writing from their experience based off a fresh listen — whether they missed the record in the first place or haven’t touched the record in a while. Whatever the reason, quality music is still quality music and it’s always worth checking out — even if it means veering from your usual tastes. Read more about the series right here.\n\nSometimes if you’re lucky when you fly from Cleveland to New York City, as the plane steadily climbs after takeoff, you’ll be able to glimpse Lake Erie’s coastline unfurl below you.\n\nFrom up high you can look down and spot the markers dotting this part of the Great Lake: downtown and Key Tower; the east side’s factories and industrial plants; suburbs like Euclid, Willoughby, and then Mentor-on-the-Lake; I-90 as it strings its way towards Buffalo and Boston. It’s a fascinating bird’s-eye view which definitively lets you know you’re leaving Cleveland, with everything slowly vanishing before you see nothing but green-and-brown Upstate New York 29,000 feet below.\n\nSome people make this flight regularly; others, both natives and not, make it once or twice per year. It goes without saying, however, that this experience is the city’s final goodbye, a parting shot worthy of stamping on an incredibly large postcard. For many northeast Ohioans, it’s the last impression they have of the city before setting out for greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nLiterally and figuratively, “flight” is the story of Cleveland and its people.\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony left on a bus. As a 1996 Los Angeles Times story points out, the Cleveland quintet set off for Southern California in 1993 in search of former NWA member Eazy-E, the only person who they thought would understand their raps. Of course, they tracked him down, prompting the hip-hop legend to sign the group and launch their career.\n\nBone’s journey out of Cleveland might not have been on a plane, but it took abandoning their birthplace to achieve success. “When we found him, we found our way out,” Wish Bone told the Times’ Heidi Siegmund Cuda. BTNH’s full-length debut, E. 1999 Eternal, was the stunning end result of this metaphorical flight from Cleveland’s east side, one of the Golden Era’s most unheralded (and oddest) releases which perfectly summed up the group and its city.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how different E. 1999 Eternal was at the time. With the exception of the group’s super-hit, “Tha Crossroads” (a remix which was an altogether different song than the original), the LP was an anomaly. If you had to pigeonhole it, the album was “West Coast,” but only in the sense that West Coast musicians had an overwhelming hand in making it. Thanks to South Central L.A. native DJ U-Neek, E. 1999’s producer, the album draped listeners in a post-apocalyptic soundscape, as if U-Neek heard Snoop Dogg’s “Murder Was the Case” and thought, Hell, let’s make this grimmer. Eazy-E, despite passing away from AIDS shortly before the album’s release, executive-produced the effort, but his involvement is the extent of the album’s West Coast influence. The Chronic or Doggystyle it wasn’t.\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony and ‘E. 1999 Eternal’ put Midwestern, and more specifically Cleveland, rap on the map — and it was just as bleak as the city at the time.\n\nAnd as far as the album compares to east-coast rap at the time (geographically, Cleveland’s only an eight-hour drive from New York City), there is no connection. Perhaps the closest East Coast cousin to Bone was the Wu-Tang Clan, whose producer, The RZA, partially grew up in Steubenville, Ohio, a burnt-out steel town two hours south of Cleveland. However, the Wu’s brand of hardcore rap never quite reached the heights of Bone’s cinematic gloom-and-doom — not to mention the Clan were the group instrumental in reviving East Coast hip-hop. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and E. 1999 Eternal put Midwestern, and more specifically Cleveland, rap on the map — and it was just as bleak as their hometown.\n\nIn the 1990s, Cleveland saw its beloved football team bolt, hemorrhaged residents for the fourth straight decade, and literally became deserted every day once the sun went down. Thanks to a particular basketball player from nearby Akron, as well as a regenerating Rust Belt DIY culture which is again emphasizing Cleveland as a hub for food, arts, science, and culture, national media today has marked the city for its upward trajectory. Whether or not it’s true (to be fair, it’s clear the change has primarily benefitted the city’s predominantly white west side, as The Ringer’s Daniel Gray-Kontar explains), the Cleveland of BTNH’s youth was dark — hence everything from E. 1999’s exceptionally graphic material to the cover artwork.\n\nGranted, not everything was so bleak. E. 1999 contains one of the best weed-rap songs of all time, “Budsmokers Only,” which finds the group at their harmonizing best as they belt the song’s title as the hook. And the single “1st of Tha Month” brought to light the significance of welfare check day, while building a song sunny enough to cause suburban kids from Rocky River to Hudson to ironically sing along.\n\nBut it’s everything else which cements E. 1999’s legacy. From the startling morose harmonizing of “Da Introduction,” to the hearse-drawn G-funk of “Shotz to the Double Glock,” the LP is a propulsive horrorcore staple. Perhaps E. 1999’s mission statement comes in the form of the aptly titled “Land of the Heartless,” the audible gut punch preceding “1st of Tha Month.” Nowhere is the grim nature of Cleveland’s reality better focused than when Layzie Bone coolly spits, “so n*gga, don’t start shit/ Because we kill in The Land of the Heartless, die.” Layzie’s several flicks of the tongue roll off with an ease that feel as casual as mentioning how late Slyman’s Restaurant stays open. The line’s only made more potent by the strokes of brutal hyperrealism (“lookin’ down the barrel of this Mossberg chrome”) punctuating the group’s rhymes throughout the album. It’s not hard to see how these high-flying moments, effortlessly shifting between barbershop-quartet hooks and double-time murder talk, helped single-handedly influence future rappers like A$AP Rocky.\n\nFor BTNH, it was just another day on the block.\n\nToday, Cleveland’s estimated population today is almost a third of what it was at its peak in 1950. With the exception of Columbus, the rest of the state’s largest population centers have at best treaded water when it comes to retaining residents. BTNH’s old neighborhood of Glenville on the east side is no exception. As Gray-Kontar’s story explains, “Glenville is one of three Cleveland neighborhoods most affected by the city’s population loss. And while Glenville is three percent younger than other Cleveland neighborhoods, home ownership is declining.” So it doesn’t matter if a handful of Ohio State, Miami, or Ohio University grads decide to take their talents to the Forest City for a few years fresh out of college—part of the city is still dying, and it’s on the east side where BTNH grew up, Asiatown still exists, Slovene Village still occupies, and the legacy of the city’s Jewish population lives on.\n\nIt’s the kind of flight you can’t see from 29,000 feet.\n\nRyan keeps the boosters boostin’ and the computers ‘putin (no Vladimir).
