        "text": "Niko Moon has announced his eagerly awaited sophomore album, BETTER DAYS, with the uplifting, genre-blending crooner making the lead single, âFALLING FOR YOUâ, available immediately. The project is set to drop on January 19th 2024.\n\nâFALLING FOR YOUâ stays true to the chart-topping singer-songwriter's penchant for combining sleek, Hip Hop-inspired beats with his trademark rasp and a plethora of energising lyrics.\n\nThe new project will be Niko Moon's first full-length release since 2021's GOOD TIME, which spawned the hugely popular title-track. âGOOD TIMEâ went on to become the Texas native's first No. 1 single on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.\n\nIt established Niko Moon's clear-cut sonic recipe, which infuses optimistic, motivational themes with uptempo instrumentals that blur the lines between country, R&B and trap.\n\nInterestingly, BETTER DAYS, which will be released on Niko Moon's own label, Happy Cowboy Records, is not due to include any of his recently shared singles, âBETTER WITH YOUâ and the Zac Brown Band-assisted âHEAVEN HAS A BARâ.\n\nNonetheless, the album will feature a highly anticipated appearance from one of the biggest names in the contemporary country scene, HARDY, who guests on âAIN'T NO BETTER PLACEâ.\n\nIn the past, Niko Moon has expressed his desire to include a cover on each album. On GOOD TIME, he shared an innovative, high-octane take on Travis Tritt's âIt's A Great Day To Be Aliveâ, and judging from the tracklist for BETTER DAYS, it looks like Niko Moon has recorded his own version of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's âFishinâ in the Darkâ.\n\nThe project will also include never-heard-before songs such as âSOMEWHERE SOUTH OF HEREâ, âFOREVER FEELINGâ, âDRINKING GAMESâ, âTHE GOOD LIFEâ and more.\n\nAs Niko Moon's fans keenly look forward to the January 19th 2024 release date for BETTER DAYS, they can get into the festive spirit by jamming the recently released revamped version of Mariah Carey's âAll I Want For Christmas Is Youâ by Niko and his wife, Anna."
