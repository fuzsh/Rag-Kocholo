        "text": "Slipknot kicked off their 25th anniversary North American tour on Tuesday night (August 6) in Noblesville, Indiana and treated fans to a throwback set of 1999-era material.\n\n“Nothing you will hear tonight was written after 1999,” singer Corey Taylor told the crowd, as the band donned their old-school red jumpsuits and era-appropriate masks. Slipknot is celebrating the 25th anniversary of their 1999 self-titled album (their first with Taylor) and played a 14-song setlist featuring fan-favorites and deep cuts including “No Life” and set closer “Scissors,\" which they haven't played live since 2000.\n\nSlipknot will traverse the country this summer and fall, including a stop in their home state of Iowa for the star-studded Knotfest. The tour is also notable, as the band's playing with their recently revealed new drummer Eloy Casagrande. Although they're celebrating old material, the metal icons have also teased a new song called \"Long May You Die,\" which they recorded with Casagrande.\n\nWatch fan-footage of \"No Life\" and \"Scissors,\" and check out Slipknot's full setlist below."
