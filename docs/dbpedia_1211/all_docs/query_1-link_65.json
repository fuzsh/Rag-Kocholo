Whether we do a full-length album or an EP or just a song, we have a lot of different options. It’s a matter of whenever the right moment happens. That’s the beauty of the way you can put music out these days. You don’t have to wait for any gatekeeper to tell you that the timing is right.\n\nBillie was also asked if he’s started writing about politics again or if the songs would be more in line with what was released on Father Of All:\n\n“You know, as long as it’s put to my language, then who knows? There was stuff on the last record that was political, like ‘Graffitia’. There’s a certain amount of isolation and feeling paranoid on the last album that fit with where we are as a society. The way we get information is almost like having voices inside your head. With the new stuff that I’m writing, I don’t know – a lot of it is kind of more self-deprecating and funny. Not that I’m doing a comedy record or anything. On one hand it feels autobiographical and funny, but on the other when you look at it you can put a social commentary twist to it.”\n\nApril 17/20 – In an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Father Of All producer Butch Walker confirms he will soon begin working on Green Day’s next album:\n\nI’m actually still working. I do a lot of records by myself, and I’m finishing up (producing) three records, so it’s taking most of my time – a Wallflowers record, the new Jewel and Matt Nathanson. And I’m getting ready to start another Green Day record. I’m working in isolation, which is cathartic, anyway.\n\nApril 7/20 – Billie Joe updates Kerrang Magazine on what has kept him busy during the Coronavirus quarantine:\n\n“I’ve been writing a lot of music, and I had all these melodies in my head, so I wrote, like, six songs since all of this has been going on,” he says. “I don’t know when I can get together with Mike and Tré, but I told them to make sure that they’re quarantined for now, and then I hope down the road we can get back in the studio with [Father Of All… producer] Butch Walker.”\n\nFeb 13/20 – Billie joined Zane Lowe on Beats 1 for a FaceTime interview and revealed more plans for new music later this year:\n\n“We have more songs. I’ve written, like, three or four since the first single (Father Of All) came out. I mean, the way people are able to put out music now, we’re so stoked, because now we can just put stuff out anytime we want – we’re completely unstructured. So to put out a single here, or an EP there, or contribute something to what would eventually be an album… we don’t really know, but we’re into it. So hopefully maybe there’ll be even more music this summer. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nWhen asked how many songs Green Day have left from the Father Of All sessions, Billie added:\n\n“We’ve got, like, seven songs left from that session. And then, yeah, then there’s like four more so we have almost another album’s worth of stuff right now.”\n\nSept 10/19 – In an interview on KROQ with the Kevin & Bean Show while promoting Father Of All Motherfuckers and the Hella Mega tour, Billie mentioned that 17 tracks were recorded in the FOAM sessions. Only 10 songs made the album so that left 7 songs on the cutting room floor. Billie had this to say about those extra tracks:\n\n“Maybe we’ll just put out another album next year or something like that. We don’t know cause we are off our contract with Warner”"
