        "text": "Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are getting ready to drop their joint album, Vultures, next month. Several teases of new music have been made and multiple release dates have come and gone with no sign of the project. From the first rumors he was working on a new solo effort to the album release parties that included one of Kanye's infamous rants, here's everything we know about Ye and Ty's new album.\n\nKanye West Prepping New Solo Album\n\nKanye West's last officially released album, Donda, dropped over two years ago. In the time since, Ye has been marred in relationship drama and controversy. However, in August of 2023, reports emerged Ye was hard at work on new music. Chicago producer Orlando \"Fya Man\" Wilder conducted an AMA on Reddit where the Donda collaborator spilled some beans on Ye's progress.\n\nFya Man described the tracks Ye was working on as \"Old Ye but new with the times.\" He also confirmed the controversial producer was working on the album at his birthday party back in June.\n\n\"Music was worked on heavily, and the party was amazing,\" Fya Man noted.\n\nNew Album Details Emerge\n\nLater in August of 2023, more details emerged on the popular subreddit page, GoodAssSub. According to the Reddit account Insurge, a user known for leaking music, the album in progress was sounding like \"a mix of The College Dropout and The Life of Pablo.\" The user alleged the release would contain an \"insane\" list of guest appearances.\n\nYe Previews New Track at London Fashion Show\n\nIn early September of 2023, Kanye previewed a new song at the Mowalola SS24 fashion show in London.\n\n\"P***y like a Steph three, straight water/Baby what's the killer price? Kevin Costner,\" Ye raps on the track below.\n\nRundown Spaz Releases Song With Kanye Feature\n\nPine Bluff, Ark. rapper Rundown Spaz released the track \"First Day Out (Freestyle) Pt. 2\" on Sept. 5, 2023. The song features a guest verse from Kanye. While Ye's lyrics are believed to be an A.I.-generated, the verse, in which Ye addresses his recent NSFW moment in Italy, got people talking.\n\nDespite the talk that the verse may be fake, the song is still on DSPs and YouTube, which seems that Kanye isn’t tripping over its release if it is A.I.-generated. Either way, it added to the talk that Kanye was back in the studio recording new music for an upcoming album.\n\nJesus Is King 2 Leaks\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2023, Kanye and Dr. Dre's Jesus Is King 2 album leaked. The 15-track release features several songs from the original album over new Dre beats and contains guest appearances from Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Travis Scott, Pusha T and more. It is unclear how the album made its way to the internet. However, there is a possibility the vaulted tracks were purposefully leaked in order to garner buzz for Ye's upcoming album.\n\nTy Dolla $ign Is Involved in New Album\n\nTwo days after the Jesus Is King 2 leak, TMZ reported on Sept. 27, 2023, that Ye was in the lab working feverishly on the new album with Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nKanye West Postpones New Album With Ty Dolla $ign\n\nAccording to a Billboard report published on Oct. 13, 2023, Kanye West briefly slowed the release of his new album with Ty Dolla $ign as they looked for a partner to distribute the project. A collaborative album between the two was initially set to be released that day, but apparently, Ye was struggling to find someone to help distribute the project.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Announce Stadium Listening Events Then Postpone Them\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2023, Ty Dolla $ign announced on Instagram that he and Ye would host a multi-stadium listening event the following month. \"Multi-stadium listening event November 3,\" the post read, which also featured the yen and dollar signs symbol.\n\nHowever, shortly after Ty's announcement, a Billboard report published on Nov. 1 confirmed the event was postponed. The newly formed duo's new album would not drop on that date either.\n\nTy Dolla $ign Promises Joint Album With Ye is Coming \"Real Soon\"\n\nVideo circulating on Nov. 12, 2023, showed Ty Dolla $ign pausing a recent concert to update his fans on the status of the project.\n\n\"I just landed on a flight from Saudi Arabia,\" Ty Dolla said. \"I've been out there recording a part of my album with my brother Ye. And that's coming real soon.\"\n\nSources Confirm Kanye West Is Recording New Album in Saudi Arabia\n\nAfter Ty Dolla $ign's update, Instagram user @__nrda shared an Instagram post on Nov. 10, 2023 that purports to show Ye's current living conditions while he works on the new album. The photos show luxury tents set in the desert, while another photo shows an open laptop next to speakers and a keyboard. The photos were reportedly taken at Named Ashar Tented Resort in Alula, Saudi Arabia.\n\nRead More: Kanye West Apologizes to Jewish Community in Hebrew Post\n\nKanye West Boasts About Having Sex With Jewish Woman in Song Snippet\n\nWhile working on the album in Saudi Arabia, one of Kanye West's songs leaked online on Nov. 16, 2023. The snippet of the unreleased song began circulating on social media, with Ye heard rapping about how he's not anti-Semitic because he slept with \"a Jewish b***h.\"\n\nAnother snippet of the song was also leaked and played on Chicago's Power 92 radio station. In that clip, Lil Durk could be heard rapping on the untitled track.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Drop New Song \"Vultures\" Without Lil Durk Verse\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign officially dropped their new song \"Vultures\" on Nov. 22, 2023. Fans were upset when the final version didn't include a verse from Durkio. The song instead features the rapper Bump J.\n\nKanye West, Ty Dolla $ign and Bump J Perform \"Vultures\" for the First Time\n\nOn Nov. 27, 2023, Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign and Bump J performed \"Vultures\" for the first time together while in Dubai. The surprise performance went down during Lil Durk's show at the nightclub Blu Dubai. Durkio's verse was then added to the studio version of \"Vultures\" on streaming services.\n\nTy Dolla $ign Shares Handwritten Tracklist and Kanye Previews New Song\n\nTy Dolla $ign posted a handwritten tracklist for Vultures on his Instagram page on Dec. 8, 2023. The tracklist was shortly followed by a social media clip of Ye standing with his back to the camera, as a rendition of The Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody\" can be heard in the background. Fans put two and two together and noted this was likely the opening track for Vultures since \"Everybody\" appears as the first song on the tracklist Ty shared. Fans also pointed out that a song called \"New Body,\" which features Nicki Minaj, and was initially part of Kanye's unreleased 2018 project Yandhi, was now included on the tracklist.\n\nKanye West Previews New Music With Future and Young Thug at Art Basel\n\nDuring Miami's Art Basel weekend in December of 2023, Kanye West was filmed on video previewing a batch of unreleased music inside a Jamaican restaurant. He ran through \"Everybody,\" as well as two new songs featuring Future and Young Thug.\n\nKanye West Announces Vultures Rave to Celebrate Album\n\nShortly after the impromptu listening session during Art Basel weekend, Playboi Carti posted a screenshot on his Instagram Story on Dec. 9, 2023. The screenshot showed a text sent by Ye inviting him to a rave in Miami on Dec. 12.\n\nThe message reads: \"It's ye checking in family Got your number from Wheezy.\"\n\n\"¥$ [Ye and Ty Dolla $ign]...VULTURES…RAVE…MIAMI…SAW…GRASS…MILLS…12…12…12…AM.\"\n\nRead More: Cam'ron Says Kanye West Plays Crazy When It's Convenient\n\nKanye West Wears Black KKK Mask During Miami Album Listening Event\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's Miami rave went down as promised on Dec. 12, 2023. Their joint album, Vultures, was officially scheduled for release on Dec. 15. However, during Ye's eventful listening party, he made headlines for donning a black KKK mask while previewing new music.\n\nThe event took place at the Wynwood Marketplace in Miami, and included Lil Durk, Offset, Kodak Black, Freddie Gibbs and Chris Brown, among others, supporting Ye and Ty, who were both in attendance. Video captured from the event also showed Ye performing the album's title track while wearing a black Ku Klux Klan-inspired hood. Fans noted the hood was actually a prop from 2013, where Ye put the garment on three Black men in the video for his single \"Black Skinhead.\"\n\nNorth West Previews New Song on Vultures\n\nYe's Miami listening party was also eventful because during the event, North West previewed some new bars she had on her father's Vulture's album.\n\n\"It's your bestie/Miss Miss Westie/Don't try to test me/It's gonna get messy/It's gonna get messy/Just, just bless me,\" North West can be heard rapping in a clip from the event.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Announce Second Vultures Rave Event, But It Gets Shut Down\n\nShortly after the first rave, social media personality YesJulz confirmed that a second Vultures rave would take place in the Las Vegas desert at 11 p.m. on Dec. 14, 2023. However, YesJulz then reported early on Dec. 15 that the rave was shut down by police.\n\nThe rave was able to resume despite this setback. Videos captured from the event, in which each ticket cost over $2,000, show Ye and TY$ in tow with multiple rappers including Quavo, Rich The Kid, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk and more. Ye premiered new music off Vultures and again ran through previously unreleased songs that he premiered at the Vultures Miami rave event on Dec. 12.\n\nThe rave was ultimately relocated to what appeared to be a hotel room, and YesJulz continued to livestream the whole event.\n\nKanye West and Kid Cudi Reunite at Vultures Rave Event\n\nDuring the Las Vegas rave event, Kid Cudi and Ye were notably seen reuniting and hugging it out on Dec. 15, 2023. The close collaborators had experienced a massive falling out over Cudder's lyrics being cut from Ye's Donda 2 album. Issues between the pair also arose after Cudi stood by his friendship with Pete Davidson, who was dating Ye's now-ex-wife back then.\n\nAnother video of the heartwarming moment confirmed Ye's new song, \"Gun to My Head,\" actually features Cudi.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Release Vultures Merch\n\nAlso on Dec. 15, 2023, as fans waited patiently for Vultures to drop, Ty $ and Ye stoked the fire by unveiling merch to support the album on Kanye's Yeezy website. Bandanas, shirts, shorts and the $200 YZY Pod sock shoes were all included, as well as a pre-order link for the Vultures album. The pre-order link merely claimed the album would ship \"in 2024.\"\n\nKanye West Goes on Heated Rant, and the Album Doesn't Drop\n\nIn the early morning hours of Dec. 15, 2023, Kanye closed out his second Vultures listening event by going on a lengthy rant. Ye called out Drake, Jay-Z and a slew of others for not supporting him over the past year and criticized Adidas as well. Ye also called out the \"Jewish n***as\" who would simply brush off his rant as another \"episode.\" The rapper even said he wanted to \"slap the s**t out of Mike Rubin.\"\n\nThe rant was captured via YesJulz's livestream on Instagram.\n\n\"Y'all ain't stop that Adidas s**t,\" Ye said. \"Y'all n***as let Adidas crash the richest n***a of all time. I put up one tweet and then Ari Emanuel put, 'Oh we gotta drop this n***a,' and all n***as just watched. The only n***a that had the Trump hat. The only n***a that went and got them billions. The only n***a that break through all kinds of ideas in fashion. I've been called a f**got so many times for tight jeans. I got n***as from Chicago that I take care of that still try to sell me.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Who you think the old man call? When we put Drake on stage, who you think the old man call? You know what I'm saying. N***a, just 'cause I had a car, n***a. F**k everybody, n***a. That's what I'm trying to say to you n***as right f**king now, n***a. Drake, this is what you been waiting for. Jay-Z, this is what you been waiting for. Adidas, this is what you been waiting for. Kim, this is what you been waiting for.\"\n\nElsewhere in the tirade, Ye said, \"N***as be hanging around these n***as for the money on some Mike Rubin s**t. I slap the s**t out of Mike Rubin I see that n***a, man, you know what I'm saying? Yo, f**k these n***as, bro...I'm on my Farrakhan Don s**t right now, bro. Because guess what? These Yeezy's gonna sell. They sabotaged the show today. They sabotaged the Instagram. They cut off the f**king Adidas contract. Then they wanna go get light-skinned Ye. You get what I'm saying?\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Vultures never hit streaming services on Dec. 15.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign Push Vultures Back to New Year's Eve\n\nA rep for Kanye and Ty$ confirmed with XXL that Vultures was delayed until Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's Vultures Doesn't Drop on New Year's Eve\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2023, Vultures didn't drop as planned once again. The album was then pushed back to Jan. 12, 2024. Ty Dolla $ign ushered in the new year with a Vultures neck tattoo, giving hope that the album could still eventually see the light of day.\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's Vultures Reportedly Not Finished\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2024, Malik Yusef hopped on Instagram and posted a photo of himself on FaceTime with Ty Dolla $ign singing in the recording booth. Yusef captioned the photo: \"Epicness loading………….,\" alongside the hashtags #viltures[sic] #badkids #yezzyseason11. In the comment section, one fan asked a couple of questions regarding the image.\n\n\"What song he recording for?\" the person asked to which Yusef replied, \"all of em.\"\n\nThe fan asked a second question: \"Redoing verses or making new ones?\"\n\nYusef replied: \"Both.\"\n\nPresumably, this meant Vultures was still under construction, and no update was made in regards to when it'd be completed.\n\nVultures Confirmed for February Release Date\n\nAfter weeks of radio silence, a representative for Kanye confirmed that Vultures is now set to drop on Feb. 3, 2024."
