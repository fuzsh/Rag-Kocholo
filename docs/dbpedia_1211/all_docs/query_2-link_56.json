        "text": "As Gavin Rossdale briefly reflected on the last 30-plus years of Bush's career, he seemed very comfortable talking bout the rejections he faced in those early days.\n\n\"Every single moment was a different stepping stone of rejection at that point in my life,\" Rossdale told Chuck Armstrong on Loudwire Nights Wednesday (July 31).\n\nHe admitted he doesn't hold any bitterness toward those rejections, because had it not been for them, he may not have gotten to the point where he could make Bush's debut album, Sixteen Stone.\n\n\"Life is full of rejections. I mean, how can you possibly live a life without consistently getting fucked? I don't know how else to do it. At some point, someone's always trying to fuck you ... I hope that serves as a message of hope for everyone that's getting fucked. You're not alone.\"\n\nGavin Rossdale Reflects on 30 Years of Sixteen Stone\n\nWhen Rossdale confronted the reality that Sixteen Stone turns 30 years old near the end of this year, he was quick to say it doesn't feel like it's been that long.\n\n\"It feels like a rush,\" he told Chuck. \"A blur. It's quite disarming, because it's such an unfortunate number. If I can think 30 years backward or be aware of that time, I therefore could think 30 years into the future — and then I'll be dead. This is like, 'Wow.'\"\n\nAs Rossdale mentioned that, he recalled what it was like for him as an artist three decades ago.\n\n\"The best thing about being young is there is literally no horizon,\" he shared.\n\n\"It's sobering. It's like my daily ice bath. The mention of those kinds of numbers, it's like an ice bath ... I hate them.\"\n\nBush's Next Album Is Coming\n\nThe conversation wasn't all about reflecting for Rossdale. As it neared its end, he did give fans a peek into the future for Bush.\n\n\"We've done a new Bush record,\" he revealed. \"[We've] recorded 10 songs.\"\n\nHe said they considered releasing a new single ahead of Bush's tour with Jerry Cantrell, but they ended up deciding they didn't want to take attention away from the band's recent greatest hits compilation, Loaded.\n\nREAD MORE: Serj Tankian Admits 'The Door Always Remains Open' For New Music From System of a Down\n\n\"[So we'll] start fresh in the new year,\" Rossdale said, adding that the tracks are all recorded and done and now are ready to be mixed.\n\n\"I'm trying to keep [the album] to 10 songs.\"\n\nWhat Else Did Bush's Gavin Rossdale Discuss on Loudwire Nights?\n\nOne of the reasons he doesn't feel compelled to write a tell-all memoir anytime soon\n\nWho are some of his favorite bands right now that give him hope for the future of rock and roll\n\nHow he got into taking ice baths in the first place\n\nListen to the Full Interview in the Podcast Player Below"
