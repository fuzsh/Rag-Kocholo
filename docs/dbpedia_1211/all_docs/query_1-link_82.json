The new material is being recorded at Private Ear Recording with engineer John Paul Peters, and is hopefully due out later this year… because we all really need new Propagandhi.\n\n\"Here's us looking sharp [at] Private Ear Recording with engineer John Paul Peters and asssistant engineer Catie celebrating shortly after having our minds blown witnessing Jordo rip it up on his mighty drums!\" wrote Propagandhi in an Instagram post from the studio.\n\n\"This next record is going to be top notch!! 'We want more drum fills, please! How about a really long wicked roll that goes into two more rolls and then into another super roll, thanks!'\"\n\nWho is Propagandhi?\n\nPropagandhi is currently founding guitarist and vocalist Chris Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky alongside guitarist Sulynn Hago and bassist Todd Kowalski. Propagandhi has released seven albums starting with their 1993 debut How To Clean Everything."
