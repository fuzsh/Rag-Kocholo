        "text": "About the New York Vehicle Inspection Program (NYVIP3)\n\nNew York State (NYVIP3) inspections include a check of on-board diagnostic system (OBDII) on non-exempt vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) less than 8,501 pounds and that are gas-powered or diesel-powered vehicles with a model year less than or equal to the current year minus two and greater than the current year minus 25.\n\nFor example, as of January 1, 2023 the model years of non-exempt vehicles that are subject to an OBDII test as part of the inspection will be 1999 through 2021.\n\nInspections also include the current\n\nsafety inspection\n\ngas cap check (gas-powered vehicles only)\n\nvisual inspection of emission control devices (for gas-powered vehicles only)\n\nLicensed inspection stations use (NYVIP3) equipment to monitor the on-board diagnostic system (OBDII) of your vehicle. If the OBDII detects a problem that can result in excessive emissions, a malfunction indicator light (MIL) illuminates to inform the driver or automotive technician.\n\nThe inspection station also uses the NYVIP3 equipment to record most other safety and low-enhanced emissions inspections.\n\nWhat vehicles are exempt from the on-board diagnostic system (OBDII) and low-enhanced emissions inspection?\n\nThese vehicles are exempt\n\nmotorcycles\n\nvehicles less than two model years old\n\nvehicles more than 25 model years old\n\ndiesel-powered vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) more than 8,500 pounds\n\nelectric-powered vehicles\n\nvehicles that have historical plates\n\nvehicles subject to the heavy vehicle safety inspection\n\nWhat emissions inspection is required if a gas-powered vehicle is not required to have the OBDII test and is not exempt from emissions inspection?\n\nA non-exempt gas-powered vehicle that is not subject to the OBDII emissions inspection is subject to the low-enhanced emissions inspection. Diesel-powered vehicles are exempt from the low-enhanced emissions inspection.\n\nHow will I know if my vehicle passed or failed the OBDII test?\n\nThe inspection equipment prints the test results and a receipt. If your vehicle fails the test, the test result will indicate the reason for the failure. It will also provide helpful information to an automotive technician who repairs the vehicle.\n\nIf my vehicle requires repairs to pass the inspection, will the warranty on my vehicle cover the repairs?\n\nRead the ownerâ€™s manual and other documents for your vehicle to get information about the warranty on the emissions control equipment.\n\nThe vehicle manufacturer is required to warranty\n\nemissions failures for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles\n\nspecified major emission components for 8 years or 80,000 miles\n\nIf you have questions, contact the automobile dealer or manufacturer.\n\nWhat can occur if my vehicle fails the OBDII test?\n\nIf your vehicle is required to receive an OBDII emissions test, and it does not qualify for a waiver (see below), the vehicle must pass that inspection in order to receive an inspection sticker. The failure of the vehicle to pass the inspection can prevent the renewal of the vehicle registration. You must have the vehicle repaired to meet the standards and pass a re-inspection.\n\nInspection waivers\n\nA vehicle that is required to have the OBDII inspection can qualify for a waiver (valid for 1 year) if the vehicle\n\nfails the OBDII inspection, but ultimately passes the safety inspection, the gas cap check (gas-powered vehicles only) and the visual inspection of the emissions control devices (gas-powered vehicles only)\n\nreceives repairs that are related to the failure of the OBDII inspection and the cost of the repairs is at least $450\n\ndoes not pass the OBDII inspection during a re-inspection\n\nAfter the re-inspection, if the vehicle qualifies, the inspector can print a waiver form. Both you and the inspector must sign the waiver. The inspection station keeps the waiver and other related documents. The inspector then issues the inspection sticker for your vehicle valid for 1 year.\n\nTo qualify for a waiver\n\nyou must have the inspection report that shows the failure from the initial New York State registered inspection station\n\nthe inspection report for the re-inspection must show that your vehicle failed the OBDII test, but that your vehicle passed the safety inspection, the gas cap check (gas-powered vehicles only), and the visual inspection of the emissions control devices (gas-powered vehicles only)\n\nthe emissions control system of your vehicle must be intact, and must not show any evidence of tampering (gas-powered vehicles only)\n\nyou must have work orders and receipts that prove that repairs related to the vehicle emissions system were completed at a NY State-registered repair shop, or at an out-of-state repair shop\n\nthe work orders and the receipts must document that the cost of the repairs, parts, labor, and related sales tax was at least $450\n\nif you complete the repairs yourself, the calculation of the cost of the repairs includes only the cost of the parts that were used and does not include your labor\n\nHow do I get a 10-day extension of my current inspection?\n\nYou can receive inspection receipt that includes a 10-day extension if\n\nthe previous inspection was expired at the time of the inspection\n\nyour vehicle passed all parts of the inspection except the test of the OBDII readiness monitors\n\nYou cannot get more than one extension from the DMV.\n\nThe inspection indicates that my vehicle is \"not ready\" for the OBDII test. What can I do? Where can I get information about the OBDII readiness monitor status of my vehicle?\n\nRead the DMV brochure A Consumer Guide to Readiness Monitor Failures as Part of the New York State Vehicle Inspection Program (C-114)\n\nWhat is the warning light on my dashboard that displays the words, \"Check Engine\", or similar words? What can I do if the warning light illuminates?\n\nThe warning light is the malfunction indicator light (MIL) of the OBDII system. The color of the MIL is red or yellow. The MIL can display the words, \"check engine soon\", \"service engine soon\", or words that are similar. The MIL on some vehicles displays the image of an engine with the word, \"check\".\n\nThe MIL normally illuminates when you insert the key and turn the vehicle ignition toward the position that starts the vehicle engine. If there is no problem, the MIL does not remain illuminated while the engine operates. If you start your engine and the MIL remains illuminated, your OBDII system has a problem.\n\nThe problem may reduce fuel efficiency, increase air pollution, or cause harm to your vehicle. Take your vehicle to a qualified automotive technician to determine the severity of the problem and what service or repairs are required. Normally the illumination of the MIL is not an indication of a malfunction that requires immediate attention, but an unresolved malfunction may lead to more serious problems or costly repairs.\n\nTo indicate a possible serious malfunction, the MIL flashes on and flashes off while the engine operates. Take your vehicle to an automotive technician immediately, and only operate your vehicle if necessary. Do not operate your vehicle at fast speeds, and do not use your vehicle to carry or tow a heavy load.\n\nHow can I learn more about OBDII?\n\nTo learn more about safety inspections, read the DMV brochure, New York State Vehicle Safety/Emissions Inspection Program for Cars and Light Trucks (C-50).
