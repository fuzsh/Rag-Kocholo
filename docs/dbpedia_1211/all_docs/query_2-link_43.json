To see alternate articles, check out ...Baby One More Time.\n\n...Baby One More Time is the debut studio album by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was released on January 12, 1999, by Jive Records. It became a worldwide commercial success, reaching the top five in 19 countries, and number one in 15, including the U.S Billboard 200. The album and its singles helped propel Spears into mainstream popularity.\n\nWith the release of the lead single, \"...Baby One More Time\", Spears became a pop phenomenon; the single peaked at number one in the Billboard Hot 100, a feat Spears would not repeat for another ten years, in October 2008, when her single \"Womanizer\" peaked at number one on the chart. Every single released in the United Kingdom charted within the top-five position in the UK Singles Chart and the top-three position in the Eurochart Hot 100.\n\nThe album's lyrics and its music videos maintained the typical virgin-like image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears. The album is certified 14× Platinum by the RIAA. ...Baby One More Time has sold 26 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the most successful albums of all time and is Spears' most successful and best selling album to date.\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 1996, Spears briefly recorded demos with R&B group Boyz II Men's recording company Stonecreek. In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense.\n\nHer mother, Lynne, asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing a Whitney Houston song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels which required a professional demo. He sent her an unreleased song from Toni Braxton and Britney rehearsed for a week and recorded it in a studio with a sound engineer. Britney traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four record labels and returned to Kentwood, Louisiana the same day.\n\nThree labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop groups such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls and that \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson or another Tiffany.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Jive Records executives returned calls to Rudolph and they appointed Spears to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month. He reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\"\n\nSpears recorded ten songs with White that included \"Autumn Goodbye\", \"E-Mail My Heart\", \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\", \"I'm So Curious\", \"I Will Still Love You\", \"Soda Pop\" and \"Thinkin' About You\".\n\nShe also recorded a cover of All Seeing I's version of Sonny & Cher's 1967 single \"The Beat Goes On.\" White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production while additional production was done by English electronic music group All Seeing I.\n\nAfter hearing the material Britney recorded, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Britney flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April of 1998 with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.\n\nMartin showed Britney and her management a track titled \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\". However, other executives were concerned that the line \"Hit Me\" would condone domestic violence, deciding later on to remove this from the song's title. While the line is still used in the song itself, the necessary context is given within the lyrics.\n\nBritney revealed that she \"didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous, so I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '...Baby One More Time'.\"\n\nBy June 1998, the album was completed and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oréal. ...Baby One More Time was released as her debut album on January 12, 1999.\n\nUrban Outfitters reissued the album on vinyl for the first time in 2017. 2,500 copies pressed on pink vinyl were made available for pre-order on August 14, 2017, selling out within 2 hours, with the albums being shipped out in November 2017.[1][2] A clear vinyl was released a year later on October 5, 2018.[3]\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of the \"...Baby One More Time\" single's release, the album was also made into a picture disc vinyl[4], and American retailer Target also reissued the album on a limited pink cassette tape.[5]\n\nSpotify[]\n\nTrack Listing[]\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\n{{{edition}}} No. Title Writer(s) Producer(s) Length\n\nNotes:\n\nIn early pressings of ...Baby One More Time, a hidden spoken message by Spears following \"The Beat Goes On\" is included. The message includes Spears thanking fans for buying her album and also promotes the then-upcoming Backstreet Boys album, Millennium, with snippets of songs featured on the album.\n\nMany countries changed the cover of the album as their governments deemed the American cover as innapropriate. However, this seems to have changed overtime as in 2023, ...Baby One More Time was reissued on vinyl with the American album cover in European countries. [citation needed]\n\nThe rainbow in the poster varies on the version of the album the International one has more colder colors while the American one has more warmer colors.\n\nScrapped debut album[]\n\nBritney's debut album was supposed to come out during Autumn of 1998 as \"Britney Spears\". However, the original idea got scrapped, following the massive success of \"...Baby One More Time\".\n\nPromo for this version of the album can be found inside the single's physical CD copies.\n\nThe photograph used in the Britney Spears album's cover was also used as the cover for the Taiwanese version of ...Baby One More Time.\n\nThis would've been one of the three self-titled albums by Spears, as she later released two eponymous albums, Britney (2001) and Britney Jean (2013).\n\nUnreleased & Unused Songs[]\n\nUnderlined songs can be found online.\n\n\"I Have Nothing\" - A cover song originally released by Whitney Houston, written by David Foster and Linda Thompson.

Spears mentioned the sound of the album as \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger [and more] contemporary\".\n\nThe album was originally going to be titled Britney Spears.\n\nThe word \"baby\" was said 25 times in the title track, ...Baby One More Time.\n\nThe title track is Spears' only song to be performed on all of her tours and residencies.\n\nSpears' A&R knew that the title track would be a big hit, calling it \"a fucking smash\".\n\nThe title track was originally offered to girl group TLC as a sequel to their single \"Baby-Baby-Baby\" for their album FanMail (1999) but was rejected.\n\nThe song was also offered to the girl group Solid HarmoniE.\n\nThe title track's music video was originally supposed to be animated, featuring Spears dancing on a vinyl record.\n\nAnother concept was supposed to feature Spears as a superhero fighting a giant robot monster.\n\nBoth of these concepts were scrapped, and the iconic high school-themed music video was filmed instead.\n\nThe original version of \"Sometimes\" (which had a guitar intro and a different outro) was replaced by the single version. The original version can be found on first pressing promos of ...Baby One More Time and the album sampler.\n\n\"Soda Pop\" was used on the soundtrack of the film Pokémon: The First Movie. There was also a promotional single inserted in the series of Britney dolls released in 2000.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Born to Make You Happy\" were partially rewritten, because Spears refused to sing a few verses which had sexual references. The lyrics were then modified by the authors.\n\nSome initial copies of the album came with a business card from Britney.\n\nCD Poster[]\n\nUnlike her later albums, ...Baby One More Time's booklet is depicted as a poster rather than a booklet, with photoshoot pictures of Spears on one side, and credits on the other.\n\nArtwork[]\n\nPhysical version variants[]\n\nCD variants[]\n\nVinyl variants[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nTemplate:...Baby One More Time/Index"
