Released by Epic Records in the United States on November 9, 1999, When the Pawn... was wholly written by Apple, with production by Jon Brion.\n\nTitle[]\n\nThe album's title is a poem Apple wrote in response to unfavorable reactions from readers of an unfavorable Spin cover story about her. \"It came from being made fun of,\" she said, \"and then, of course, it becomes a thing I'm being made fun of for.\"\n\nUpon its release, When the Pawn... broke the record for longest album title at 444 characters.\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe first single, \"Fast as You Can\", was fairly popular and received moderate radio and video airplay. It reached the top 20 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and became Apple's first top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up singles, \"Limp\" and especially \"Paper Bag\", which was nominated for a Grammy Award, were less successful. Apple's boyfriend at the time, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, directed videos for all three singles.\n\nIn 2019, Apple collaborated with King Princess on a cover of \"I Know\". The song was released for Spotify's RISE program on January 25.\n\nA reissue by Vinyl Me Please was announced in 2020 featuring a new cover chosen by Fiona herself, marking the album's first ever vinyl pressing.\n\nArtwork[]\n\nOfficial artwork made for the album.\n\nReception[]\n\nOn the U.S. Billboard 200, When the Pawn... debuted at number 13 with 103,000 copies sold in first week.
