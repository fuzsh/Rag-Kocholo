        "text": "The Jacksonville Jaguars had absolutely no answer for Derrick Henry on Thursday night. The supersized running back for the Tennessee Titans bulldozed his way past a team that prides itself on defense in one of the most audacious rushing displays in N.F.L. history.\n\nThe numbers were staggering. Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, carried the ball 17 times for 238 yards and four touchdowns in Tennesseeâ€™s 30-9 victory. It was just the 10th time since 1950 that a running back has rushed for at least 200 yards and four touchdowns, and the 6-foot-3, 247-pound Henry did it on five fewer carries than any of his predecessors while averaging an outrageous 14 yards per rush.\n\nThere were plenty of memorable moments in the game for Henry, but none topped the 99-yard run midway through the second quarter in which he fought his way through several tackle attempts to match Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys for the longest rushing touchdown in N.F.L. history."
