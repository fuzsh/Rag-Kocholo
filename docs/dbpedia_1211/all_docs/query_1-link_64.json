        "text": "That also made Swift the most streamed artist in a single day in the platform's history, and \"Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)\" became Spotify's most-streamed song in a single day as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple Music declared TTPD the platform's \"biggest pop album of all time\" based on first-day streams.\n\nSwift's fans have waited for \"The Tortured Poets Department\" with bated breath since she announced the album while accepting a Grammy in February. Following her announcement and some light social media promotion, Swift was low-key in promoting the album, suggesting she knew the album would be a hit with or without the fanfare that typically proceeds a major release.\n\nFlashy press tour or not, Swift's fans showed up in a streaming frenzy that is paying off. Though much of her billionaire fortune comes from touring, Swift makes tens of millions from her record sales and streaming.\n\nWhile artists featured on the album, like Post Malone and Florence and The Machine, will likely receive a streaming boost, Boomer artists who Swift name-dropped in her lyrics, including famed stars like Patti Smith and Stevie Nicks, could also find some new fans.\n\nRepresentatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."
