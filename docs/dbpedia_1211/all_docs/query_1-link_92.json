        "text": "Last week, Jack White declared he was “going to pour out a right and mighty blessing on Detroit.”\n\nA promise made — and delivered — on Monday night, Aug. 5, at a packed Saint Andrew’s Hall in the Detroit-born rocker’s home town.\n\nThe rock ‘n’ roll impresario may be based primarily in Nashville these days, but his heart is still deeply embedded in Detroit. Just two months ago he played at the Michigan Central opening concert, and White and his band used a five-day break between festival gigs in South Korea and Scandinavia to play a ferocious Motor City show, announced just a few days before and instantly sold-out, to celebrate the official release of his latest album, “No Name.”\n\nThat set — a raw and loud but also diverse 13-song set — was surprise-dropped on July 19, given away free to customers at White’s Third Man Records stores in the Cass Corridor, Nashville and London. It came out formally last Friday, Aug. 2, and on Monday White and his quartet rolled seven of the new songs into the 21-song, nearly 100-minute set, including the night’s first four numbers — “Old Scratch Blues,” “That’s How I’m Feeling” (shouting “That’s my town, right there!” during a call-and-response exchange), “Morning at Midnight” and “It’s Rough on Rats (If You’re Asking).”\n\nLater on he served up “What’s the Rumpus?” and “Archbishop Harold Holmes,” the latter with a quick-paced vocal cadence not unlike fellow Detroit icon Eminem’s. He saved the joyful “Underground” for the encore, sandwiched between the Raconteurs’ “Steady, As She Goes” and the show-closing anthem “Seven Nation Army.”\n\nWith his wife Olivia Jean looking on from the balcony — as well as Detroit Tigers star and broadcaster Kirk Gibson and John Fogerty and his band members (who played Sunday, Aug. 4, at the Pine Knob Music Theatre) — White was in an ebullient mood, filled with frenetic energy as he leapt around the stage and between his bandmates, goading the crowd into singalongs. “I’ve seen so many shows in this building, but I’ve never really played here,” White — who had performed at Saint Andrew’s with early bands such as Goober & the Peas and the Hentchmen — told the crowd. He shouted out his 93-year-old mother, who he said was watching from the balcony, and spoke about how he and bassist Dominic Davis “caught the Fort Street bus a block from here” as kids.\n\nHe also shouted out his 93-year-old mother, who he said was watching from the Saint Andrew’s balcony. And before playing the White Stripes’ “Hotel Yorba” he joked that, “I have to be careful; the last time I played this song in Detroit I got married” — referring to his on-stage proposal and marriage to Olivia Jean on April 8, 2022 at the Masonic Temple Auditorium.\n\nWhite — who took in a Tigers game on Sunday afternoon as well — also offered some musical nods to his Michigan lineage, covering the Stooges’ “I Wanna Be Your Dog” (bookended with the White Stripes’ “Cannon”) and tossing The Go’s Keep On Trash” into the encore. He included a few of his other solo career highlights — “Love Interruption,” “Why Walk a Dog?” and “Lazaretto” — and there were, of course, plenty of White Stripe favorites, from other staples such as “The Hardest Button to Button” and “Ball and Biscuit” to deeper choices like “Little Bird” and “Hello Operator.”\n\nIt was yet another memorable and even historic-feeling night for White, who’s stacked up more than his share of those in the metro area. “Thank you for all the love you gave tonight,” he said during the band’s final bow. “I hope we we gave as much love back to you. Music is sacred!” And on Monday White’s music felt like a blessing indeed.\n\nTigers retire Hall of Famer Jim Leyland’s No. 10\n\nTotally Tubular Festival opens an 80s time capsule at Meadow Brook\n\nWith summer practices underway, Oakland’s Greg Kampe largely positive on transfer portal additions"
