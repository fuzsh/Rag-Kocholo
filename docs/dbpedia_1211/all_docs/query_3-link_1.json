        "text": "The drought is almost over—Katy Perry is entering a new era.\n\nOn June 17, the pop star shared an Instagram post with news that she’s dropping a new single called “Woman’s World” on July 11, followed by the music video on July 12. “Get ready to pop off,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn the cover art, shot by photographer Jack Bridgland, Perry is dressed in a white bikini with sci-fi, robot legs as she stands on top of what looks like a galaxy.\n\nIn celebration of the news, Perry posted a TikTok that same day with behind-the-scenes footage of her cover shoot, lip-syncing to a 15-second snippet of her single.\n\n“Sexy, confident / So intelligent / She is heaven-sent / So soft, so strong,” she sings.\n\nAccording to Variety, this single will be our first taste of Perry’s sixth studio album. While we await its arrival, we’ve gathered everything we know about her new music so far.\n\nWhat is the album called, and when does it come out?\n\nPerry’s sixth studio album, formerly called “KP6” by fans, is officially titled 143, and it drops on September 20.\n\nOn July 10, just one day before the arrival of “Woman’s World,” the singer took to her social media accounts to share the news with her followers. She posted the cover art, also by Bridgland, which shows her levitating in front of a colorful vortex.\n\n“143. THE ALBUM. SEPTEMBER 20TH. PRE-ORDER NOW,” she wrote, including the link to her website.\n\nThe number 143 is code for “I love you.” It takes the number of letters from each word in the phrase: I (1) love (4) you (3).\n\n“I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,” Perry said in a statement.\n\nIn a press release, Capitol Records added that the album is “a sexy, fearless return to form for the multifaceted musician. Jam-packed with the kind of empowering and provocative pop anthems fans have come to love, 143 is an album with a lot of heart—and a lot of BPM.”\n\nCan any songs be heard?\n\nAfter releasing her single “Woman’s World,” Perry shared a teaser on July 19 for the next song she plans to release, “Lifetimes,” which was also produced by Dr. Luke.\n\n“I know you feel it/ Can you believe it?/ I’m gonna love you ’til the end and then repeat it,” she sings in the clip. “For life/ For life.”\n\nIn a video on instagram, Perry danced to her own tune. She wrote in the caption, “143 IS A PARTY AND EVERYONE’S INVITED: SOUND ON.”\n\nWhat has Katy Perry said about her new album?\n\nPerry has been dropping subtle hints leading up to her big announcement.\n\nOn April 13, Perry attended the 2024 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony wearing a classy black off-the-shoulder gown and carrying a clear glass purse. Inside the bag, she carried a small scroll that read “KP6: TOP SECRET,” which got the internet buzzing with talk of more music.\n\nThat month, Perry shared with Access Hollywood that KP6 will be her “happiest” record yet.\n\n“I just have yet to make a record from a place of feeling really happy and whole and full of love,” she explained. “Sometimes artists are like, ‘Oh, that’s boring, you want to make music from kind of like a tougher place,’ but actually it’s very bright and joyful, like pure joy and fun and playful and celebratory and a party.”\n\nThen on May 8th, two days after the 2024 Met Gala, Perry seemingly suggested that her upcoming project might be coming in the fall.\n\nThe pop star tweeted, “wow ppl are STILL texting me that they can’t believe they missed me at The Met or OMG you killed it etc etc… welp, hold on to your common sense hat cause we in for a ride this fall…”\n\nIn fact, her teasing the album dates as far back as 2023. Early that August, at one of her Las Vegas residency shows, Perry said from the stage, “If you couldn’t love me in my Witness (2017) and Smile (2020) eras, then you can’t love me in my KP6 era.”\n\nBefore “Woman’s World,” the last time Perry released music was in 2020. In recent years, she has shifted her focus to being a judge on American Idol for seven seasons. But after retiring from the singing competition show at the end of its 22nd season in May 2024, Perry seems to be preparing to gear back into full pop stardom.\n\nThis story will be updated."
