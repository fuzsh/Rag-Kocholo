        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 2014, Lana Del Rey released her third studio album, Ultraviolence. The finished tracks were recorded for the most part with producer Dan Auerbach at his Easy Eye Sound studio in Nashville. It features “West Coast,” “Shades of Cool,” the title track, and “Brooklyn Baby.” With Auerbach playing guitar on most tracks, the songs bring a psychedelic rock feel to her sound. “Brooklyn Baby” was written with Lou Reed in mind. They were set to collaborate, but he died the day she arrived in New York. The album landed on many publications’ best of 2014 lists, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1958 - Frank Zappa graduated high school from Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, CA.

It features “Hypocrite” and “Desire Lines.”\n\n1995 - Alanis Morissette released her album, Jagged Little Pill. The album made Morissette the first female Canadian to score a U.S. No. 1 album. Named after a lyric from \"You Learn,\" the album topped the charts in ten countries and has sold more than 33 million units worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Jagged Little Pill was turned into an award-winning Broadway musical, which ran from 2019-2021.\n\n1997 - Rumors saying Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon could double as the soundtrack for \"The Wizard Of Oz\" boosted the already phenomenal sales of Dark Side.\n\n2003 - The Arctic Monkeys made their live debut at The Grapes pub in Sheffield, England.
