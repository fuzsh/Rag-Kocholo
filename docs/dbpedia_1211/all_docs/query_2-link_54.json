        "text": "Played it an hour or so after I learned of his sad passing... or that it was now confirmed. On went the headphones, while I was reading about him on the headphones.\n\nSo many great songs on it and I've loved little Red Corvette since it was reissues in the mid-80s. Ok, the title track did get overplayed at the turn of the millennium but I love hearing it again now. Plenty of fairly lengthy tracks to get into; something that I am fond of with certain artists.\n\nAlthough I have most of his albums (although I admit I've not heard some of the very early and last few - but I think I'll be in the majority with that) with so much to enjoy on all of those - I do actually like Batman a lot, for example... among others (glad that it often gets its due on this forum) it's still this that I rate as the best I've heard from him.\n\n1999 is awesome. This album is in my top5 Prince albums.\n\nI first noticed Prince with the single 1999 and Vanity 6's Nasty Girl in 1983. I saw them on a Dutch video music show (toppop) where they showed both promo video's. Needless to say Jill Jones caught my attention (the blond girl behind the keyboard) and that made me listen to the song... I think I must have played the song to death before When Doves Cry was released the next year. Made me a Prince expert with my friends ;-)\n\nMost of the songs are a huge step forward in Prince's discography. As much as I like the previous two records, this is something else. According to the Peach&Black Podcast (a well known Aussie podcast about Prince), this album can be considered as the baseline for Prince music. This is Prince and everything that came before or after can be compared to this album (PP is rock-Prince, etc). This is the Minneapolis sound. Indeed with a lot of Linn drums and other electronics and samples, but much better done then most of the synth music from that period (or any for that matter).\n\nStandout songs are (besides all of them...) 1999, Little Red Corvette, Lady Cab Driver and All The Critics Love U In New York. Without giving the other songs not enough credit, these four are really special. Just listen to the lyrics to find out that Prince hasn't lost the nastyness. It's more subtle now (\"Cause you had a pocket full of horses. Trojan and some of them used\" from Little Red Corvette). Most of the songs are extended in jams with a lot above the 6 minute mark.\n\n1999 was the last song recorded (WB wanted a hit single) and was suppossed to be in harmony all the way through in stead of each singer a line. Hopefully this version will see the light of day someday .\n\nThe guitar solo from Little Red Corvette was actually a combination of two solo's. A nice anecdote is that Dez (his guitarist) played those on record and said he couldn't do them together in concert. Prince just laughed and said he had to (or else). In the end Dez recreated that solo almost like it was on record in concert.\n\nWith the album came the tradition of great b-sides. How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore is just as essential Prince as any other hit single.\n\nThis ablum has been released as a single album in some countries in Europe first, before the 2lp was finally released.\n\nThe tape version of that 1lp contained How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore.\n\nHa, ha, I actually do like it, but not as much as most other do, and I like it less than the other albums from the \"classic period\" - which is still odd enough I guess...\n\nI would say it's more of a \"side step\". With the preceding albums he was on a progression that had a clear direction, and to me with this album he takes a turn from that direction he seemed to be heading in, but that new direction does not lead to the next stage, which is another side step. I think it would have been interesting to have heard an album that is the natural progression from Controversy to Purple Rain, because this doen't feel like a link between those. But from then on he started side stepping all the time, never doing what would have been the natural progression or predictable next step, which is one more reason why he was Prince.\n\nI have that album (as illustrated above) and actually think it is a pretty good single disc distillation, but I would rather have had a single disc with more of the songs, but in shorter versions."
