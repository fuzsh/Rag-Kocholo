        "text": "98 Degrees: performs in the music video \"The Hardest Thing\" from the album \"98 Degrees and Rising\" recorded for Motown and Universal Records. The music video begins with shots of a boxer and a dancer. The group performs in front of the glowing lights of Las Vegas and in a boxing ring.\n\nThe video features Ricky Martin performing in a pub with his band and hanging out with a lady (Nina Moric) at different locations, including New York city. One scene shows several women taking their shirts off and performing choreographed dance moves while it rains; this scene coincides with the line in the pre-chorus \"She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain\". Various snippets of the video seem to merge into each other over the duration of the song. Towards the end of the video, Martin gets distracted by his lady partner while driving, causing him to drive erratically and causing another car to veer and hit a fire hydrant, releasing a fountain of water; this was also the first scene of the video.\n\nKid Rock performs in the music video \"Bawitdaba\" from the album \"Devil Without a Cause\" recorded for Atlantic Records. Kid Rock stands in a dry dusty field as people before a variety of motorcycle students. He also sings as he dances in a trailer park surrounded by several women.\n\nThe video features the women in three different outfits: white, black, silver and Left Eye in blue. When there are shots of the women together they have two different outfits: black and silver. T-Boz's hair is fuchsia in the video. It also features a scene of Chilli on a swing singing. It also features T-Boz dancing as well as Left Eye. As Left Eye's rap begins, she is in a garage-like place with white clothes on while rapping. It also shows her practicing fighting moves in a futuristic blue outfit. One of the final scenes shows TLC fighting each other, while also dancing and having fun.\n\nJennifer's being spied on in her roomy mansion by a voyeur following her every move on hacked closed circuit television. She seems to be aware of this, and gives him a show. But he's not getting her love.\n\n98 Degrees: performs in the music video \"I Do (Cherish You)\" from the album \"98 Degrees and Rising\" recorded for Motown and Universal Records. The music video begins with a shot of a bride at a wedding. The group performs in black suits as they stand in front of pillars.\n\nJordan Knight performs in the music video \"Give It to You\" from his self-title album recorded for Interscope Records. Jordan Knight sings and dances with back-ups in the parking lot of a county fair in front of a Ferris wheel. He sings to a girl who is serving carnival customers at a food stand.\n\nThe music video, directed by Jorn Heitmann, features Lou Bega singing and dancing with flappers, possibly a homage to the music of the 1920s and 1930s. The video includes clips of old-style movies and newsreels showing trumpets, big bands and the like. The Disney version of the music video features Lou Bega performing against a white background with a live band, and the women's names are replaced with names of classic Disney characters. Footage of Mickey Mouse Works cartoons and clips of Lou Bega performing against a checkered background is intercut throughout the video."
