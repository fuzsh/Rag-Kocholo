        "text": "The woman behind “Espresso,” , is releasing many more songs this summer. Sabrina Carpenter kicked off the first week of June by announcing her new album, Short n’ Sweet, will be out on August 23. “This project is quite special to me, and I hope it’ll be something special to you too,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nCarpenter shared her album cover art and preorder links. Ahead, all she has revealed about the project so far.\n\nWhy is the album called Short n’ Sweet?\n\nCarpenter likely chose the cheeky title to reference her height, as she is 4’11”. Before she announced the project, fans spotted billboards featuring tweets about Carpenter’s height.\n\nOn her site, the preorder description for the CD also brings up her petiteness: “Short n’ Sweet showcases the scintillating spirit of Sabrina Carpenter, the pocket-sized pop star with a larger-than-life artistic presence.”\n\nWill “Espresso” be on the CD?\n\nYes. Carpenter describes the hit song as her album’s “debut single” on her site.\n\nHas the tracklist been released?\n\nYes, on July 9, Carpenter shared the 12-song tracklist. The songs are:\n\nTaste\n\nPlease Please Please\n\nGood Graces\n\nSharpest Tool\n\nCoincidence\n\nBed Chem\n\nEspresso\n\nDumb & Poetic\n\nSlim Pickins\n\nJuno\n\nLie to Girls\n\nDon’t Smile\n\nWhat will the second single be, and when is it coming out?\n\nWhen she announced Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter hinted that the second single would be out on Thursday, June 6. She wrote, “I also have a surprise coming for you on Thursday night so keep an eye out!!”\n\nOn June 2, she also shared what seems to be a teaser for a new song:\n\nHas Carpenter said anything about what her next album will be like?\n\nIn March, Carpenter spoke to Cosmopolitan and briefly mentioned that she’d started working on her next era: “I’m trying to really take this experience in [performing the songs on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour] before moving on to the next thing…but I’ve been working on the next thing for a minute. I’m starting to feel like I’ve outgrown the songs I’m singing, which is always an exciting feeling because I think that means the next chapter is right around the corner.”\n\nWhen asked what her next chapter looks like and whether she’ll focus on music or acting, Carpenter said, “I go to the movies and I get really jealous of the people in the movies. I’m like, ‘Oh, I want to be in a movie.’ And then I go to concerts, and I get jealous of people onstage. I’m like, ‘Oh, I want to be onstage.’ I think that’s a good sign. The hardest thing for me to do sometimes is to stop and take a moment to recognize how much I grew in the last year. I didn’t think 24 was going to be special at all. When I turned 24, I was like, ‘What is this year even made for?’ Because 21 is always very pronounced, 25 is always very pronounced. But the middle ages, oof. Even with songs, there’s, ‘Nobody likes you when you’re 23.’ But shit about 24.”\n\nShe also addressed her flirty songwriting style, which can be heard on “Espresso” and the outros from her Emails I Can’t Send track “Nonsense.”\n\n“It’s funny too, writing the [‘Nonsense’] outros, because I feel like I’ve learned a lot more about sexuality through writing those than people think,” she said. “I think people think I’m just obnoxiously horny, when in reality, writing them comes from the ability to not be fearful of your sexuality as opposed to just not being able to put it down.”"
