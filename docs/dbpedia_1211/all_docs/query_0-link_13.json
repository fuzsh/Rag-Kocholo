        "text": "I should be riding on the float in the hit parade/instead of sitting on the curb behind the barricade/another verse in the doormat serenade. -- Put Me on Top,'' Aimee Mann\n\nJuly 1999: Aimee Mann can't sit around these days waiting to hear what the record-label executives think of her new album. She is far too busy doing things for herself -- choosing press photos, writing her own bio, running to Fed Ex and, literally, licking stamps. But things weren't always this way.\n\nJuly 1998: Aimee Mann is holed up for the fourth day in a row in the windowless, hyper-air-conditioned bunker that is Mad Dog Studios in Burbank, Calif., recording two new songs for her third solo album, trying her best to create some magic. Outside, the sun is ridiculously bright, the heat stifling, the whir of traffic numbing. Adding to the unreal out-of-time feeling that 10-hour days in a dimly lighted, soundproof room can produce is the fact that the singers Sheena Easton and Jeffrey Osborne are in the next studio shooting a Christmas video.\n\nMann is here today because shortly after she delivered seven new songs to Geffen Records, she was told by her manager, Michael Hausman, that the A&R executives ''didn't hear a single.'' A few days after she got the bad news, she said, more resigned than angry: ''There's never a single unless you're earmarked for greatness in the first place. I wish it would be called for what it is. Like, 'These are good songs, but they're just not grabbing me for some reason.' Or, 'Production-wise, this doesn't fit into the format of radio right now.' Or some sort of practical thing. But it never is. 'Well, it's just not a single.' How can I correct that? 'Oh, well then I'll write some magical thing that will put you into a trance.' But having said that, sometimes I think it is magic. Sometimes I think they think it's magic. So they're waiting for magic.''\n\nShe heaved a big sigh -- and then gathered steam. ''But don't tell me it's not a single. A single is a record company's job: to pick out a song that they think is good and make sure people hear it. It's also incidentally, their job to come up with a way of selling records if, say, I don't have a single at all. What I still have is a great record with great songs.'' I asked Mann if she is ever tempted simply to give them what they want. ''I've sort of tried to do it,'' she said. ''I'll keep it in mind. I'll think, 'Well, this is pretty catchy' or 'I've kept this simple enough lyrically so that any moron can understand it.' But anytime I do that I get bored, and then I don't know how to finish the song. I really have to force myself to write and get into the studio, because this is the only career I have.''\n\nSo, having resigned herself to the necessity of incanting some magic and delivering a single, one of the two songs that she is recording at Mad Dog today is called ''Nothing Is Good Enough.'' Mann is known for writing clever, disappointed love songs that can also be read as damnations of the music industry. Lyrically and musically, they are sharp and subtle, angry and vulnerable. Her last solo record's title -- I'm With Stupid'' -- was a sardonic reference to her choice in both lovers and labels. ''Nothing Is Good Enough,'' however, is a bit more direct. It's a song about defeat and the misery of delivering new material to an indifferent record executive.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
