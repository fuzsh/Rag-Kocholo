        "text": "Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill broke a record for female artists with five Grammy Awards on Wednesday, and the Titanic ballad My Heart Will Go On sailed on with four awards, including song and record of the year.\n\n\"This is so amazing . . . this is crazy because it's hip-hop music,\" said Hill, who stepped away from the Fugees to win album of the year for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and best new artist.\n\nIt was the first time a rap artist had ever won in those major Grammy categories.\n\nMadonna, now that she's turned 40, won her first musical Grammys, including best pop album for her excursion into electronica, Ray of Light. She also won best dance recording and best short form music video.\n\nShania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer Orchestra each were double winners.\n\nThe 23-year-old Hill, who led with 10 nominations in nine categories, also won best rhythm and blues album. Her hit song, Doo Wop (That Thing) won best R&B song and best R&B vocal performance.\n\nHill's best new artist win was something of a misnomer since she won two past Grammys with the Fugees. She read a passage from the Bible and thanked her children for, among other things, \"not spilling anything on mommy's outfit.\"\n\nHill, whose music mixes rap and R&B and touches on family and political issues, beat Carole King's record for most Grammys ever by a female artist in one night. King won four in 1971 for Tapestry.\n\nMy Heart Will Go On also won the female pop vocal for Celine Dion and as best song written for a motion picture or television. James Horner and Will Jennings picked up the writing trophies.\n\nThe Academy Award for best song was one of 11 Oscars for Titanic. The soundtrack was the top-selling album of 1998, with more than 9-million units sold.\n\nActor-rapper Will Smith won best rap song for his good-natured Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. He paid tribute to God, \"the jiggiest wife in the world\" (actor Jada Pinkett Smith) and his son.\n\nIn another rap category, Jay-Z's Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life won best album. The rapper had said he would skip the show because he doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap. The Beastie Boys won duo or group performance for Intergalactic.\n\nIn his 12th Grammy victory of the 1990s, Eric Clapton won male pop vocal for My Father's Eyes.\n\nCrow won best rock album for The Globe Sessions and paid tribute to A&M Records, just swallowed up in a corporate merger.\n\n\"This is a really nice thing for me,\" she said, adding, \"I want Lauryn Hill to produce my next record.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' Wide Open Spaces was an upset winner for best country album over the better-known Garth Brooks and Twain.\n\nYou're Still the One won best country song for Twain and husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and female country vocal performance for Twain. Vince Gill won best male country vocal performance for If You Ever Have Forever in Mind.\n\nBest female rock vocal performance went to Alanis Morissette for Uninvited.\n\nThe Setzer Orchestra, riding the swing revival, captured two pop honors, performance by a duo or group and instrumental performance.\n\nThe male R&B vocal Grammy went to Wonder for St. Louis Blues. The tune also earned him and two colleagues the award for instrumental arrangement with vocals. The two Grammys brought Wonder's career total to 21.\n\nAnd the winner is ...\n\nA partial list of 41st annual Grammy Award winners announced Wednesday:\n\nRECORD OF THE YEAR: My Heart Will Go On, Celine Dion.\n\nALBUM OF THE YEAR: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Lauryn Hill.\n\nSONG OF THE YEAR: My Heart Will Go On, James Horner & Will Jennings.\n\nNEW ARTIST: Lauryn Hill.\n\nFEMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE: My Heart Will Go On, Celine Dion.\n\nMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE: My Father's Eyes Eric Clapton.\n\nPOP PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL: Jump Jive an' Wail, Brian Setzer Orchestra.\n\nPOP COLLABORATION WITH VOCALS: I Still Have That Other Girl, Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach.\n\nPOP INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCE: Sleepwalk, Brian Setzer Orchestra.\n\nDANCE RECORDING: Ray of Light, Madonna.\n\nPOP ALBUM: Ray of Light, Madonna.\n\nTRADITIONAL POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE: Live at Carnegie Hall _ The 50th Anniversary Concert, Patti Page.\n\nMALE ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE: Fly Away, Lenny Kravitz.\n\nROCK PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL: Pink, Aerosmith.\n\nHARD ROCK PERFORMANCE: Most High, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nMETAL PERFORMANCE: Better Than You, Metallica.\n\nROCK INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCE: The Roots of Confidence, Pat Metheny Group.\n\nROCK SONG: Uninvited, Alanis Morissette.\n\nROCK ALBUM: The Globe Sessions, Sheryl Crow.\n\nALTERNATIVE MUSIC PERFORMANCE: Hello Nasty, Beastie Boys.\n\nFEMALE R&B VOCAL PERFORMANCE: Doo Wop (That Thing), Lauryn Hill.\n\nMALE R&B VOCAL PERFORMANCE: St. Louis Blues, Stevie Wonder.\n\nR&B PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL: The Boy Is Mine, Brandy & Monica.\n\nR&B SONG: Doo Wop (That Thing), Lauryn Hill.\n\nR&B ALBUM: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Lauryn Hill.\n\nTRADITIONAL R&B VOCAL PERFORMANCE: Live!
