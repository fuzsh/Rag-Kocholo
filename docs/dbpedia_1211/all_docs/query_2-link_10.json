        "text": "New Age group Secret Garden wrote “Heartstrings,” an instrumental song from the duo's first CD, Songs From a Secret Garden. Streisand incorporated the song into her wedding as “I've Dreamed of You,” with lyrics added by singer-songwriter Ann Hampton-Callaway. “The Sunday before Barbra got married, I got inspired to turn it into a wedding song,” Callaway explained. “I knew that sometime this year she and James were planning to tie the knot, so I decided to tell the story from Barbra's perspective. When I faxed the lyric to Barbra's producer that evening, he was very happy with it, and, after a few minor changes, sent it to Barbra. Monday, I learned that Barbra loved the song and that she wanted me to record a demo and send it immediately. Tuesday, I recorded the demo and overnighted it to Barbra's assistant. Apparently, three hours before the wedding, she heard the demo and decided to sing the song along with a song she has already planned to perform by Melissa Manchester and Tom Snow. It was my playing and Irwin Fisch's string arrangement that accompanied Barbra as she sang 'I've Dreamed Of You' to James Brolin. It's a revelation to me how in love Barbra must be to have the courage to be so spontaneous on such a momentous occasion. A friend of mine who spoke to Marvin Hamlisch was told it was an absolutely stunning moment.”\n\nColumbia Records released a CD single of the song (#38K 79211) as the album's first single.\n\nGeorge and Ira Gershwin's classic “Isn't It A Pity?” became Barbra and Jim's favorite song and was used on their wedding day to welcome the newlyweds to their post-wedding celebration under the supervision of Marvin Hamlisch, who announced them as “Mr. and Mrs. Brolin.” Originally included in the Gershwins' 1932 Broadway musical, Pardon My English and previously recorded by Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Feinstein, Johnny Mathis, Mel Torme, and others, the song perfectly described the wedding couple.\n\n“The Island” — Brazilian songwriters Ivan Lins & Vitor Martins wrote \"Começar de Novo\" (“Once and Again”) in 1979. Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote the English lyrics. They also wrote new lyrics for Streisand's record of the song on A Love Like Ours. Originally, the song ended with the lyrics “keep your arms around me, love, we're almost there.”\n\nStreisand explained, “In the original lyric, I felt the lovers didn't quite go far enough ... the couple see the island, but never quite arrive there (I'll leave this to your imagination!). So, I asked Marilyn and Alan if they could write a final verse to complete the moment.”\n\nOn our little island, Not a soul can hear us\n\nSilently exchanging fantasies and feelings\n\nEndlessly exploring, learning one another\n\nTill the morning finds us\n\nYou were made to love me, and I was made to love you\n\nKeep your arms around me, lose yourself completely\n\nMake it last forever\n\nI can see the island, shining there before us\n\nNow we're getting closer, just keep your arms around me\n\nCome, my love, we're there ...\n\nPictured: Rolf Løvland and Barbra Streisand\n\n“Just One Lifetime,” written by Melissa Manchester and Tom Snow, was sung by Streisand to James Brolin at their wedding. “Marvin Hamlisch had written a wonderful chamber-music arrangement for [Barbra's] wedding,” said producer Arif Mardin. “She sent me a cassette of that, and I incorporated a little bit of Marvin's music at the beginning and at the end of the album version of the song — you can almost imagine the wedding beginning when you hear it.”\n\nMelissa Manchester wrote and recorded “Just One Lifetime” for her Mathematics album. “When we were newly married, Kevin and I were sitting in bed one morning, and he said to me ‘Just one lifetime won't be enough time to love you,’ and I said, ‘Hold that thought — there's a song there somewhere,’ and I ran to phone Tom Snow with the great idea.”\n\nIn 1999, Manchester felt the song would resonate with this time in Barbra's life (i.e. falling in love and a pending marriage), so she sent along a new demo of the song to Streisand. “She loved the chorus,” Melissa explained, “but she couldn't follow the verses, musically or emotionally, so she asked if they could be reworked. Tom Snow and I ended up creating an entirely new song, one that really mirrors Barbra's emotional state now. It is an entirely different song than the one I recorded in 1985. Originally, I got a phone call from Barbra's associate saying she wanted to record the song on her album in November — could I please send lead sheets, etc. — and I was so thunderstruck by this news that I kept asking him to repeat it. By the fifth time, when he reassured me, ‘Yes, she's really going to record it,’ I thanked him and hung up. Luckily nobody was home, because I was screaming ‘Thank you, God!’ at the top of my lungs for 10 minutes, until I finally hyperventilated and had to lie down. A week or two later, there began a flurry of phone calls from the same gentleman, who was being very cryptic about his mission. He kept asking for tapes of the song in different keys, minor lyric changes, one version of the song edited and one without the edit ... Finally, I heard that Barbra made this her wedding anthem — it was beyond belief!”\n\nThe song “Wait” was written years ago for an unproduced Streisand album. Alan Bergman (who wrote the lyrics to it with his wife Marilyn) elaborated: “We worked on the ending [of “Wait” with Michel Legrand]. We changed the ending from the original years ago.”\n\nDean Pitchford and Tom Snow wrote “If I Never Met You.” Pitchford wrote lyrics to the Fame theme song, the songs in Footloose, and other songs with Peter Allen. In 2004, he praised Streisand's rendition of “If I Never Met You”: “It's very heartfelt and it was written about my life partner, whom I've been with going on 13 years.”\n\nPitchford elaborated to writer Carl Wiser about the recording session of “If I Never Met You.” — “[Barbra] was in the studio working with our friend Jay Landers, and they called Tom and me late one night, and they played us the track as she had recorded it. When they played it for me, there was one lyric I wasn't understanding correctly, and she had also mis-sung a note, and I pointed them out. She was very grateful, and she went back and she corrected both of them.” Pitchford explained that Streisand “was gracious about it. She was just so lovely about it. The thing I've discovered over the years of working with Barbra is that she really wants to be involved in a creative give-and-take. She likes when she's got conversation started.”\n\nDean Pitchford summed up his excitement by explaining that “not only did we get a recording of the song I wrote for my husband, Michael, but we got a recording from Barbra Streisand, for goodness sakes.”"
