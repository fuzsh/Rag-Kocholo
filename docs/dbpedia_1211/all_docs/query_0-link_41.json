        "text": "Environmental toxicologist by day, burgeoning DJ and producer by night, Jayda G is a big favourite at STW HQ. Her own productions combine a little of the analogue haziness that’s come to be associated with the Canadian Riviera, with the leftfield sensibilities of the Sex Tags crew; no coincidence, given she runs the Freakout Cult label and party with multifarious Sex Tags co-founder DJ Fett Burger. Her DJ sets are filled with diversity, warmth and soul with a strong affinity to the vinyl format, which makes her an ideal guest to run through some favourite album art. She tells us her picks “gravitate towards collages, psychedelic graphics and illustrations”, with some stunners from Prince, Erkyah Badu and Jimi Hendrix in the mix.\n\nListen to a playlist with tracks from all the albums below and catch Jayda at Dance Tunnel (11th June) alongside Brian Not Brian.\n\nEddie Hazel – Games, Dames and Guitar Thangs (Warner Bros.)\n\nThe artwork on this album is awesome. It is one of my favourite examples of the stylistic flair of the 70s. Love that Eddie Hazel is on a horse with this amazing parrot cape flowing behind him. The random assortment of images in a collage aesthetic is right up my alley. I’ve been loving this guitar album since my teenage days. I come back to this artwork often.\n\nErykah Badu – New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) (Universal Motown)\n\nIn my opinion this is one of Badu’s best albums since Mama’s Gun and the artwork is captivating. With various themes of purple and a highly detailed psychedelic jungle forest, again this album artwork emulates an aesthetic that I gravitate towards. I also love the symbolism of the album cover such as the woman coming out of the robotic Badu with a tuning fork and a love female tattoo. I love the layers of meaning and visual imagery. Badu is always on a next level new age tip. Can’t help but appreciate.\n\nPrince – 1999 (Warner Bros.)\n\nNow I know the unforgettable Prince just died and 1999 is his most famous album, but it’s also honestly one of my favorite covers. I am a huge Prince fan. I’ve been listening to his tracks since I was in the womb (for real). I love the 1999 cover because, as a kid, I thought it was so strange that there wasn’t a full picture of Prince on the cover – just his eyes and mouth in a collage of drawings plus a phallic 1. Again, there is running theme here – a love of intricacy that one can keep coming back to.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience – Axis : Bold As Love (Reprise)\n\nAs a preteen, I loved Jimi Hendrix, especially the song ‘Bold As Love’. The album cover was another fascination of mine. It was one of my first introductions to Vishnu imagery. Jimi stands in the center, clad in various Hindu symbols coupled with psychedelic pinks, organs and blues. A feast for the eyes.\n\nRascalz – Really Livin’ (Calabash Records)\n\nThis cover is true underground Canadian hip-hop at its best. I had a poster of this album cover hanging above my bed as a child. For the non-Canadian’s out there, the Rascalz were an influential hip-hop group from Vancouver in the early 90s. My brother was the group’s manager for a decade and because of this affiliation I had all of the Rascalz’s merchandise. I love these early illustrations and artwork done by Nelson “Dedos” Garcia. This was my first introduction to hip-hop imagery and the aesthetic."
