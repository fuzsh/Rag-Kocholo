The title is 90 words long, so it is usually listed as When The Pawn....\n\nThe album's full title is: When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring There's no body to batter when your mind is your might So when you go solo, you hold your own hand And remember that depth is the greatest of heights And if you know where you stand, then you know where to land And if you fall it won't matter, cause you'll know that you're right It's a poem Apple wrote after seeing her 1997 Spin magazine interview, where the writer couldn't grasp that her personality was genuine, writing, \"Before she has fully become a person, she has become a persona. It's taking her some time to decide which part of her is the image, and which part is real.\" This sets the mark for longest album title, but other acts take note of the ensuing publicity and beat it, notably Chumbawumba with their 160-word release known as The Boy Bands Have Won in 2008. As for the songs, they're a deep dive into Apple's psyche. The first single, \"Fast As You Can,\" is a warning to any would-be suitors: \"you want no part of this.\" \"I Know,\" later covered by Elvis Costello, is about a guy who could keep up with her intellectually, but wasn't available. The three-year gap between When The Pawn... and Apple's debut album, Tidal, is only half the time she takes to release her next album, Extraordinary Machine, which appears in 2005 after deciding to re-record it completely.\n\nCategories\n\nRecord Breakers\n\nReleases"
