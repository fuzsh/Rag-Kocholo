        "text": "By freelance writer Michael P Coleman\n\n“I’m privileged to be in this role and help serve as a visible example that people can accomplish whatever it is that they want to accomplish in their lives.”\n\nIf you Google “The Power of Attraction,” I wouldn’t be surprised if a picture of Dr. J. Luke Wood popped up.\n\nWood was sworn in as California State University, Sacramento’s ninth president last summer, about 20 years after first declaring, as a teenaged undergraduate at the institution, that he would lead the organization one day. The 41 year old visionary is a former fifth grader who had been suspended dozens of times during that single academic year. He went on to earn bachelor’s and master’s degree at Sac State, then a Masters of Education and a doctorate in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at Arizona State University.\n\nToday, Wood is the youngest president in Sac State’s history.\n\n“I certainly had people here [at Sac State] who didn’t think I could amount to anything, and [they] communicated that to me,” Wood confided, after I asked about a rumor that suggested the same. “But the worse thing you can do with me is tell me I can’t do something. Someone told me I couldn’t box, so at 38 years old, I picked up boxing and competed. I have a ‘prove them wrong’ kind of ethos.”\n\nBECOMING LUKE WOOD\n\nIf anyone ever had an opportunity to hone that ethos in the school of hard knocks, it’s Wood. After being born in Oakland, California to a mother who struggled with mental health and substance use and was incarcerated, he and his twin brother entered the foster care system. They settled in a home in McCloud, a town of fewer than 1,000 people located at the foot of Mt. Shasta in far northern California. The future Sac State president told me that his high school was home to about 100 students.\n\n“Growing up was a very oppositional experience,” Wood recalled. “I was in this home of very diverse children who were all in the system — either foster or long term care, guardianship, adoption. Across the street, there was a group home, and the rest of the town was nothing like that. When I was in fifth grade, I had a teacher who saw me as a black foster kid. That teacher suspended me 42 times.”\n\nWhile that experience would have set back other students for the rest of their lives, it led Wood to later focus his research on school suspensions as they relate to foster youth. But more on that in a minute! You’re probably wondering how a foster kid who had been suspended 42 times turned it around and became the president of one of the nation’s leading universities.\n\nAt the risk of giving you a clichéd answer, it’s in the book…one of the 16 tomes that Wood has published during his distinguished career.\n\n(Spoiler alert! The next year, Wood’s sixth grade teacher really saw Wood, and instilled in him a lifetime love of learning.)\n\n“Years later, I wrote a study highlighting high rates of disproportionality for black students in California, as it related to foster youth,” Wood continued. “We did a really big webinar on the topic, and afterward a state legislator asked whether we had recommendations on what needed to be done. I wrote that foster youth should have access to their court appointed attorney or social worker when they’re in the expulsion hearings, so that they have someone in the room who is advocating for them.”\n\n“A lot of times, those youth are easy to suspend and pick off because they don’t have the family there advocating for them,” Wood continued. “A lot of the suspensions, like the ones for me, are bogus. They’re just the way for a teacher with poor classroom management skills to manage other children: by using somebody as an example.”\n\nThe resulting bill, AB-740, was based on Wood’s personal experience in the foster care system. It was signed into state law in 2022.\n\nA few other of Wood’s early experiences also inform him as president of Sac State.\n\n“When I was a kid in high school, the American Legion put on a program called Boy State. Now it’s called Boys and Girls State,” Wood remembered. “They bring top rated high schoolers from across the state to campus for a political camp that lasts a week, during which they live in the residence halls, visit the state capital, learn about policy, and learn about the political process. My original plan when I was young was to work in the political arena. I came to Sac State for that camp, and I fell in love with Sacramento, being close to the capital, and the park-like campus with trees and nature.”\n\n“I also fell in love with the diversity. It was something that I wasn’t used to, but I saw as so beautiful,” Wood shared. “I never looked back, and decided when I was a junior in high school that I was coming to Sacramento State. I had the ability to go to pretty much any campus that I wanted to, but I chose Sac State because I felt comfortable and at home.”\n\nAs Wood walked me right up to those Sac State facility and administrators who had told him that he would “never amount to anything,” I asked him to tell me about those first few semesters on campus.\n\n“For four years I was in student government,” Wood recalled. “During that time, I was really critical about what I saw the campus was doing to support, particularly, black and African American students, and students of color in general. I would tell everyone “I’m going to be president of Sacramento State.’ Since last summer, there have been hundreds of people who’ve walked up to me and said ‘I remember when you used to say that!’ It wasn’t for the title. It was for the impact that I could have, and seeing something different.”\n\n“When you walk and try to do something good, a lot of people will say ‘No’ or ‘That can’t be done,’ Wood continued. “Where [some] people see walls, I see bridges. I was put on a path, and I’m trying to walk in that purpose to create the experience that [our] students deserve.”\n\nThis writer spent the first half of my career working in higher education. I’ve been on a first-name basis with the leaders of some of the country’s top universities. I have never met a university president more passionate about the students he serves, or more impressive, than Dr. Wood. I’m not a Sac State alumnus, and I’m proud of him! So I could only imagine the pride that members of the campus community have felt since last summer when Wood was sworn in as president.\n\n“I’ve noticed two things,” Wood reflected. “Many of the faculty and staff who supported me and taught me over 20 years ago are still doing work here, so it’s a full circle moment for me, but it’s also a full circle moment for them, because I’m what they produced.”\n\n“From the students’ perspective, I’m a younger president,” Wood continued. “I’m black. I’m a former foster child. I’m a first generation college student. I have had students tell me that seeing me in this role makes them think they can do whatever they want in their lives. The response from those who are former foster youth, as well as from black and African American students, gives me chills every time. I’ve had students walk up to me and ask if they can shake my hand or give me a hug, and they start crying because of what it means to them.”\n\n“I carry that on my shoulders. I’m privileged to be in this role and help serve as a visible example that people can accomplish whatever it is that they want to accomplish in their lives.”\n\nBefore I asked Wood about his first few months in the president’s chair, and the future of Sac State, I had to ask him whether, just as he has encountered those who had been in his corner 20 years ago, he had bumped into any of the people who told him that he would “never amount to anything” as he strolled across campus.\n\n“Yes, I have,” Wood said slowly, gathering his thoughts. “That was a long time ago. Those conversations were key developmental moments in my personal life. What I hope is that, as I have grown in my life, and changed the way that I think about the world, and how I approach other people, my hope is that they have similarly grown, as well. And so, I hold nothing against them, and only wish the best for them.”\n\n“And at the same time,” Wood added, “I want to create systems of accountability within our organization to make sure that the messages that they would would send to an 18 year old kid today, who [might be] from the middle of nowhere, are the messages that are building that kid up and making them stronger, not tearing them down.”\n\nThat “thump” that you may have just heard was Wood dropping the mic.\n\nWOOD’S FIRST MONTHS AS PRESIDENT\n\nI was curious about what Wood’s first few months as president of Sac State had been like — even as I wished I were a student there! I also wondered what his biggest challenge had been so far.\n\n“We’ve been doing 100 days of listening,” Wood said. “I think we’ve done 75, 75-minute sessions with the community and the campus — students, faculty, and staff — and community members, and religious institutions. It’s been really good just getting to know and hear about the things that people are talking about within our community, and some of the things they want to see for the future.”\n\n“I think that one of the challenges that we’ve had is we have limited resources as a state institution, and the goal to provide the highest quality service to our students, and to support them and ensure that every single one of them has an opportunity to walk across the stage. Figuring out how to make very important efforts and initiatives work in a resource-strained environment is one of the challenges.”\n\nWood told me that, already, he had begun to envision big changes for Sac State’s campus.\n\n“You’re going to see us have more of a residential campus feel in the future,” Wood promised. “I was fortunate that when I was a student here, I lived in the residence halls. That’s not the most common experience that our students have. Right now, we’ve got 2,100 beds on campus, and I want to have 5,000-7,000 students who are living here, because it will help us with a number of issues all at once.”\n\nAs a former non-traditional student who commuted to and from campus, this writer leaned in.\n\n“First, it will help us with enrollment. Taking a full course load is important, and we know that residential students take more classes, because of proximity,” Wood said. “It helps with food insecurity, housing insecurity, transportation concerns, employment barriers — all of those issues are mitigated when the student knows where they’re going to be laying their head at night and where their next meal is going to come from.”\n\n“It also helps with graduation rates,” Wood continued. “When a student goes home to live off campus, they go home to a place to lay their head. When they go home here, they also go home to academic advising, tutoring, supplemental instruction, [and] resident hall advisors who are working with them. They don’t really leave the institution…so the learning continues. It just creates a well-rounded student who is ready to go out and be able to transform the lives of their families and their communities.”\n\n“Another of my goals is to expand the reach of our Guardian Scholars Program, which serves former foster youth,” Wood added. “My goal is to have the largest program in the country serving former foster youth, and to be known for the kind of support that we provide. I’m also focusing on building up mental health support for our students. One of the first things that I did was hire seven more therapists to focus on and provide support for our students. Coming out of the pandemic, we have students who are struggling with depression, anxiety, and other mental health pressures at an astounding rate. Of course, that has a disproportionate impact on minority communities, and is even more adversely impacted by cultures within our minority communities that oftentimes don’t seek out mental health support because of stigmas associated with it, and the lack of cultural responsiveness that oftentimes is given to them by providers.”\n\nOn the early December morning that I sat down with Wood, the country was reeling after having heard the news of a shooting on a college campus in Las Vegas the day before. Sadly, that type of news story has become all too common over the last two decades. I asked Wood what he was doing to protect students, faculty, and staff at Sac State.\n\n“My background is in student affairs, so those are issues that I’m very familiar with,” Wood said. “When I came in, it was on the heels of other issues that had happened at Sac State that had been dealt with under President Nelson, some pretty recurrent issues with anti semitism and, of course, ongoing issues that we hear about from students who identify as Muslim and students who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community. We’re a microcosm of society. Society’s messed up, and so there are going to be things that happen on campus that are concerning.”\n\n“I established a presidential task force on campus safety to give me recommendations on what we can do,” Wood continued. “But I also told folks: establishing a task force is not action. That’s a plan for reaction. We’re installing video monitors so that we can communicate in real time when issues come up. We’re working on developing a better text-based system to communicate with students.”\n\n“So we’re doing a lot around it, because this is a campus just like any other in the country. These are regular experiences. It’s not about if it’s going to happen. It’s really not even about when it’s going to happen: it’s about how often.”\n\nWOOD’S TAKE ON THIS YEAR’S SACRAMENTO MAYORAL RACE\n\nBefore I let Wood get back to work — it had already been a particularly busy day for him, as Sac State faculty had started a strike just hours before we sat down to talk — I had to ask him about the upcoming mayoral race in Sacramento, as I wondered whether he had a perspective about the kind of person who should next lead our city. Wood was, after all, originally interested in politics. As I asked the question, I wondered whether Wood, if he had taken that path, would have succeed President Barack Obama in the White House. Wood is that impressive.\n\n“I just hope that we have a mayor who understands the importance of a university in serving as an engine for economic development for the local region,” Wood said. “Sacramento State has 278,000 living alumni, and the vast majority of them are living in this region. I want a mayor who understands the importance we play in helping the city accomplish its goals, and creating a better future for Sacramento.”\n\nAfter spending almost an hour with Wood, I couldn’t envision a more engaged or committed leader for Sac State, and pondered what the institution might do if he were to move on.\n\nIf Wood has anything to do with it, we won’t have to worry about that for quite some time.\n\n“This may sound like a political answer, but it’s the truth: this is it,” Wood said, when I asked him about his next professional step. “I plan on being here. Sacramento State has a history of very long serving presidents — 12 years, 19 years, 20 years. I plan to be here for the rest of my career.”\n\nWelcome home, Dr. Wood. In this writer’s estimation, Sac State is in excellent hands.\n\nLearn about California State University, Sacramento at csus.edu.\n\nConnect with freelance content creator Michael P Coleman at MichaelPColeman.com."
