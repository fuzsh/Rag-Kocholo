        "text": "Dr. Luke Deitz was born and raised in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. He attended Johns Hopkins University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a double major in chemistry and psychology. He stayed at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for his medical degree and completed an internal medicine internship at the University of Maryland. From there, he gained tremendous clinical and surgical experience in the highly regarded ophthalmology residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Dr. Deitz received his fellowship training in pediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA.\n\nDr. Deitz specializes in both the medical and surgical management of pediatric eye conditions, as well as adult strabismus. He adds a wealth of knowledge and innovation to the Wright Eye Center. Dr. Deitz draws on his tight-knit family upbringing and small-town roots in providing warm, compassionate care. His patients, both young and not-so-young, have always appreciated and often commented on his bedside manner and his rapport with children. He shares in the mission of continuing forward strides in the arenas of clinical research, the education of pediatricians and future pediatric ophthalmologists here and abroad, and world-class patient care, including assuming the responsibilities of the Foundation’s special needs clinic.\n\nEducation\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nFellowship – Pediatric Ophthalmology and Adult Strabismus\n\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nOphthalmology Residency\n\nCompletion Date: June 2010\n\nPost-doctoral research fellow\n\nWilmer Ophthalmological Institute\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nPreceptor: David Guyton, M.D\n\nUniversity of Maryland Medical Systems\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nInternship in Internal Medicine\n\nCompletion Date: June 2005\n\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\nBaltimore, MD – Degrees conferred: M.D.\n\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nDegrees conferred: Bachelor of Arts Chemistry, Psychology\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\n\nGraduation Date: May 1999\n\nOphthalmology Resident\n\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nPost-doctoral research fellow\n\nWilmer Ophthalmological Institute\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nPreceptor: David Guyton, M.D\n\nIntern in Internal Medicine\n\nUniversity of Maryland Medical Systems\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nSenior Laboratory Technician\n\nBiomechanics Laboratory\n\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nResearch Assistant\n\nBiomechanics Laboratory\n\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nTai Scholarship\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\n\nGolden Key National Honor Society\n\nCharles Carroll Fulton Scholar\n\nAlpha Epsilon Delta – National Premedical Honor Society\n\nDean’s List, Johns Hopkins University\n\nBeta Theta Pi Scholar\n\nBausch & Lomb Scholar\n\nNational Merit Commended Scholar\n\nActive Professional Memberships:\n\nAmerican Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus – Member-In-Training (2010-present)\n\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology – Fellow (2008-present)\n\nLos Angeles Society of Ophthalmology – Member (2010-present)\n\nActive Professional Licenses:\n\nCalifornia Medical License\n\nCurrent Board Certifications:\n\nAmerican Board of Ophthalmology\n\nPublications\n\nAbstracts\n\nInoue N, Manson T, Deitz LW, Elias J, Frassica F, Chao EYS: Strain contribution to the morphology of the canine supraspinatus tendon insertion site.
