        "text": "Lukasz ‘Dr. Luke’ Gottwald\n\nSongwriter/Producer, Kemosabe Records/Sony Music,\n\nPrescription Songs\n\nTwitter: @TheDoctorLuke\n\nMedicine Man\n\nLukasz Gottwald, aka Dr. Luke, 38, has been a prolific hitmaker since he started making beats for Rawkus Records during the late ’90s. The songwriter/producer’s success has only snowballed, and the past year saw him chalk up hits on the Mainstream Top 40 chart for Jessie J (“Domino”), Flo Rida (“Good Feeling”), Rihanna (“You Da One,” “Where Have You Been”), Katy Perry (“Part of Me,” “Wide Awake”) and B.o.B. with Taylor Swift (“Both of Us”). He also executive-produced B.o.B.’s Strange Clouds, won a second consecutive ASCAP songwriter of the year award, co-produced Perry’s “Part of Me” film and sold a 50% share of his Kemosabe Records label to Sony Music.\n\n“It’s been great,” the Rhode Island native and one-time “Saturday Night Live” band guitarist says. But Dr. Luke adds that his primary focus is always the future, which includes executive-producing Ke$ha’s next album and working with new artist Becky G. “I think sometimes people get caught up in what they’ve done, and that’s a slippery path,” he explains. “Even when you have a record that’s No. 1, that means it was done in the past, probably months ago. I’ve been judged every time for the last hit I did, so it’s really about what you’re doing in the moment that dictates the now and the future.”\n\n« PREVIOUS: Mike Flynn | NEXT: Peter Gray »\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nRETURN TO 40 Under 40 INDEX\n\nBUY SINGLE ISSUES OF BILLBOARD MAGAZINE HERE"
