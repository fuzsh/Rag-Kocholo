        "text": "I am driven by a passion for providing patient-centered care with the ultimate goal of restoring individuals to the activities they love, enabling them to embrace life to the fullest again. I am an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at St. Luke’s University Health Network. I love to treat all types of orthopedic injuries in all areas of the body with the patient’s best interest in mind. With a specialized focus on sports-related injuries of the upper and lower extremities, I am dedicated to performing minimally invasive arthroscopic procedures to manage tendon, ligament and labrum injuries and perform open ligament reconstructions, cartilage procedures, shoulder replacements and fracture care of the upper and lower extremities.\n\nI was born and raised in northern New Jersey and have spent a great deal of time in the Lehigh Valley. I completed my undergraduate degree at Moravian University, where I was a four-year collegiate basketball player. I started my medical training at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. I then traveled to Providence, RI, where I completed my orthopedic residency at Brown University. I stayed at Brown University for an orthopedic trauma fellowship, treating patients at Rhode Island Hospital, one of the busiest trauma centers in New England. While in Rhode Island, I helped care for the Brown University athletic teams and the Providence Bruins (Boston Bruins minor league affiliate). Finally, I completed my orthopedic training at Duke University with a fellowship in sports medicine and shoulder surgery. During my time in Durham, I served as assistant team physician for all the Duke University and North Carolina Central University athletic teams and high schools in the area.\n\nOutside work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and children, outdoor activities, playing golf and basketball and attending sporting events of all levels."
