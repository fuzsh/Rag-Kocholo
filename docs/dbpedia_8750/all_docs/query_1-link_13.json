Dr. Roberts also holds a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Davidson College.\n\nDr. Roberts loves seeing the transition that occurs when a person who has been self-conscious about their teeth and smile their entire life develops into a radiant, confident person with a great smile to back it up! He also loves our patients for their friendly and positive attitudes. Dr. Roberts knows that achieving a great smile is a team effort, and without patients who are willing to work with him it would be impossible to achieve such beautiful and functional final results.\n\nWhen he’s not busy creating beautiful smiles, Dr. Roberts is deeply involved in continuing education concerning both traditional orthodontia and Invisalign®.
