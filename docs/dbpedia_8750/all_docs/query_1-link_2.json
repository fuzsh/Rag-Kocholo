        "text": "Rhode Island, a state of the United States, located in the New England region, is known for a diverse and thriving music scene.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1733, the first organ said to be designed for church use, was installed at Trinity Church in Newport.[citation needed]\n\nIn the late 1990s, the state's music scene, which is centered around the capital city of Providence, became nationally known for the noise rock scene that revolved around the Fort Thunder artists' collective.[citation needed]\n\nThe state is home to a wide range of artists performing of a number of genres, most notably folk rock, jazz, hardcore punk, hip hop, and Cape Verdean music.[citation needed]\n\nThe state is known for the famous Newport Jazz and Newport Folk festivals.[citation needed]\n\nState song\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1996, Rhode Island declared \"Rhode Island, It's for Me\" as the official state song. The lyrics were written by Charlie Hall, the music was written by Maria Day, and the piece was arranged by Kathryn Chester.[1] \"Rhode Island, It's for Me\" replaced \"Rhode Island\", which was subsequently named the official state march.[citation needed]\n\nOther state-affiliated songs\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Rhode Island\"\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout\n\n[edit]\n\n“Rhode Island”, written by T. Clarke Browne, was the official state song for over 50 years, when it was replaced by “Rhode Island, It’s For Me”.[2] It has since been renamed the official state march.[3]\n\nLyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are the lyrics for the song \"Rhode Island\":[4]\n\nHere's to you, belov'd RHODE ISLAND,\n\nWith your Hills and Ocean Shore.\n\nWe are proud to hail you RHODY\n\nAnd your patriots of yore.\n\nFirst to claim your independence,\n\nGreat your heritage and fame.\n\nThe smallest State in all the Union,\n\nWe will glorify your name!\n\n\"Rhode Island Is Famous for You\"\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout\n\n[edit]\n\n“Rhode Island Is Famous for You” was originally written by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz in 1948, for Inside U.S.A., a 1940s Broadway show about the U.S. States. The number was performed by Estelle Loring, who was awarded a Theater World Award for the piece, and Jack Haley.[5]\n\n“Rhode Island Is Famous for You” also served as the theme song for Buddy Cianci’s Radio Show, and was performed by Robert Goulet and Cianci himself at his 1995 mayoral inauguration.[5]\n\nThe song has been covered by Blossom Dearie, Michael Feinstein, Nancy Lamott, Mandy Patinkin, John Pizzarelli, and Erin McKeown.[citation needed]\n\nThe song has recently[when?] been featured on the podcast Crimetown.[clarification needed][citation needed]\n\nPopular music\n\n[edit]\n\nProvidence\n\n[edit]\n\nProvidence, the state's capital, has a very strong local independent music scene, known especially for its contributions to the genre of noise rock, most notably the groups Lightning Bolt, Daughters, Black Dice, and Arab on Radar. Rap artists such as Sage Francis and John Phelps, formerly known as Lunchbagg, are among the notable figures combining DIY philosophy with Hip Hop. Other rap artists such as Dee Gomes, Jae Lynx, King OSF, J Duce, and Vick Mucka have grown prominent fan bases by representing the city's harsher neighborhoods and have gone on to sign with major record labels.[citation needed]\n\nOther indie rock and alternative artists from the city include Les Savy Fav, Dicky Barrett (vocalist for ska group Mighty Mighty Bosstones), ZOX, The Low Anthem, Downtown Boys, and Deer Tick. Noise/Punk 5 piece, Hairspray Queen are also from varying neighborhoods in the City.[citation needed]\n\nSinger-songwriter, musician, and lyricist Jeffrey Osborne was born and raised in Providence. Osborne spent over a decade as the drummer and lead vocalist for the American R&B/funk band L.T.D. Amongst his biggest hits with the group were \"(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again\" (1977), \"Concentrate on You\", \"Love Ballad\" (1976), and \"Holding On (When Love Is Gone)\" (1978). Osborne subsequently launched a successful solo career in 1982, charting with hit songs including \"On the Wings of Love\", \"I Really Don't Need No Light\" (No. 29 and No. 39, respectively, on the pop chart), \"Don't You Get So Mad\" (No. 25), \"Stay with Me Tonight\" (No. 30), \"Plane Love\" (No. 10 R&B, No. 6 dance), and \"We're Going All the Way\" (No. 48).[citation needed]\n\nBased in Providence, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the most influential music institutions in the state.[citation needed]\n\nCollege Hill\n\n[edit]\n\nRhode Island School of Design has been the alma mater of many popular musicians. Three members of Talking Heads met at the college, but did not form the band until they moved to New York City.[citation needed]\n\nNotable musicians who attended Providence's Brown University include Wendy Carlos, Lisa Loeb, Mary Chapin Carpenter, OK Go singer Damian Kulash, Duncan Sheik, ZOX, Lawrence, and Will Oldham, who dropped out after one semester.[citation needed]\n\nNewport\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport has a much smaller scene, with Throwing Muses being its most successful rock band. The group formed in 1981 and recorded and toured until their hiatus in 2003. The band's lead guitarist and secondary songwriter, Tanya Donnelly also formed Belly, best known for their hit \"Feed the Tree\", which went to #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in 1994. Donnelly was also briefly guitarist for The Breeders.[citation needed]\n\nThe singing family The Cowsills, who had Top 40 hits from 1967 to 1969 also are from Newport. They were the inspiration for the fictional Partridge Family.[citation needed]\n\nSince 2000, Newport has cultivated a small ska punk scene, headed by the Sublime cover group Badfish and the punk band Big World.[citation needed]\n\nRockabilly singer Jody Gibson (née Joseph Paul Katzberg), who had a Gold Record with Good Morning Captain, spent much of his later life in Newport.[citation needed]\n\nRest of the state\n\n[edit]\n\nOther well known Rhode Island musical artists from elsewhere in the state include John Cafferty, Blu Cantrell (who had a #2 Hot 100 hit with \"Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!)\" in 2001), Combustible Edison, Sage Francis, Monty Are I, Draco and the Malfoys, and Billy Gillman. The pop music producer and songwriter Dr. Luke was born in Westerly.[6]\n\nOther music\n\n[edit]\n\nIndigenous music\n\n[edit]\n\nPortuguese music\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the large population of Portuguese immigrants in Southern New England, Portuguese traditional music is played in small communities. Usually Roman Catholic churches are the center of the communities activities, where music is played.[citation needed]\n\nFado, which has been compared with the Spanish flamenco, is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness, and melancholia (loosely captured by the word saudade, or \"longing\"). Fado performers play at local venues throughout Rhode Island and Southern Massachusetts.[citation needed]\n\nThe Azores is the major heritage of many Portuguese-Americans. In Rhode Island, most Portuguese traditional music is played by Azorean people. Azoreans maintain some distinct musical traditions, such as the traditionally fiddle-driven chamarrita dance. This dance and music is played mainly at weddings and Church festivals.[citation needed]\n\nAzorean-Portuguese sensation Jorge Ferreira is a popular musician throughout New England, singing at many festivals and events.[citation needed]\n\nCape Verdean music\n\n[edit]\n\nOf special importance is the music of the large Cape Verdean population. Although Cape Verdean music is largely unknown outside of the expatriate community, Rhode Island is the acknowledged center for Cape Verdean morna and other styles in the United States.[7]\n\nMusic festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nNewport Jazz Festival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Newport Jazz Festival began in 1954 by George Wein and has been documented on recordings by Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Muddy Waters, Nina Simone, Ray Charles, John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. The 1958 festival was documented in the 1960 film Jazz on a Summer's Day. The festival moved to New York City in 1971. In 1985, the festival was revived in Newport as a JVC Jazz Festival.[citation needed]\n\nNewport Folk Festival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival began in 1959, co-founded by Jazz Festival founder George Wein. The festival is best known for the July 25, 1965 performance of Bob Dylan, where he performed for the first time with electric instruments. Like the Jazz Festival, the folk festival moved to New York City in 1971, but returned in 1986. Notable performers at the festivals included: Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Bonnie Raitt, Alison Krauss, Ry Cooder, Little Feat, Janis Ian, Suzanne Vega, Violent Femmes, The String Cheese Incident, Indigo Girls, and The Pixies.[citation needed]\n\nNewport Music Festival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Newport Music Festival is a classical music festival that began in 1969 as a summer season of the Metropolitan Opera. The outdoor venue was not conducive to classical music performance, and instead the grand rooms of the stately Newport mansions were put to use for chamber music concerts. The early concerts utilized many members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Mark P. Malkovich, III has been the general director for 31 of the 37 seasons. It has become known for giving young international artists, such as Inessa Galante, a venue for their American debut.[citation needed]\n\nSunset Music Festival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sunset Music Festival began in 1997 in Newport and has included performances by acts as varied as Saves the Day, Jason Mraz, Paula Cole, moe., Little Feat, Jack's Mannequin, Peter Frampton, Bo Bice, Bruce Hornsby, Guster, Something Corporate, Ben Folds (who has played at several festivals), Better Than Ezra, Cheap Trick, Gin Blossoms and Anna Nalick and also local artists like Becky Chace, Zox, and Monty Are I.[citation needed]\n\nList of popular musicians/bands from Rhode Island\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
