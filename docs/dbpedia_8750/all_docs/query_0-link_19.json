        "text": "The stars of the political movie Ella McCay have been in Rhode Island for the last few months, but some new Hollywood faces could be showing up soon.\n\nYet another major motion picture might soon film in the Ocean State, bringing names such as Austin Butler with it.\n\nIt's probably the perfect movie to be filmed in Rhode Island, too.\n\nDeadline.com recently revealed that City on Fire, the first book in a crime novel trilogy from author Don Winslow, was set to be made into a feature film from Sony's 3000 Pictures.\n\nREAD MORE: All the Ella MacCay Film Locations in Rhode Island\n\nWriter Justin Kuritzkes is reportedly adapting the best sellers and Butler is producing for the first time alongside David Heyman and Shane Salerno.\n\nBetter yet, Butler is also starring in the film, his first starring role since an Oscar-nominated performance in Elvis.\n\nThere's no better place for them all to bring their talents than little â€˜ol Rhody.\n\nThat's because author Winslow set his crime family trilogy in Providence.\n\nThe books tell a fictional tale of feuding Italian and Irish crime families. Butler would play the main character, Danny Ryan, a man determined to build an empire or die trying.\n\nWhere else would you film a movie about crime family wars of the '80s and '90s than The Renaissance City, right?\n\nWinslow also still has a family home in Matunuck, so he could easily be around to help scout sites for his series.\n\nREAD MORE: These Famous Faces Call Rhode Island Home\n\nNo film schedule or locations seem to have been decided and the scripts are reportedly still in the writing stages, but 3000 Pictures has fast-tracked the picture so it definitely wants to get filming soon.\n\nHere's hoping that filming uses the real Providence for a movie set in Providence."
