        "text": "Saint Luke, the author of the third Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, is a pivotal figure in the New Testament, offering a unique perspective on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as well as the early Christian church.\n\nWhile the Bible does not provide specific details about his birth and death, historical and traditional sources offer some insights into his life.\n\nWhen Was St.Luke Born and When Did He Die?\n\nThe exact dates of Saint Luke’s birth and death are not recorded in the Bible, and as such, there are no direct biblical verses to cite for this information.\n\nHistorical and ecclesiastical tradition suggests that Luke was born in Antioch, in modern-day Turkey, around the year AD 6-9.\n\nRegarding his death, various traditions suggest that Luke died at the age of 84, around the year AD 84-90, but these are based on early Christian writings and church history rather than direct biblical accounts.\n\nHow Old Was St Luke When He Died?\n\nBased on the traditional accounts that suggest Saint Luke died around AD 84-90 and assuming he was born around AD 6-9, he would have been approximately 75-84 years old at the time of his death.\n\nAgain, it is important to note that these figures are derived from historical and ecclesiastical traditions, and not from explicit statements within the Scripture.\n\nSaint Luke’s contributions to the New Testament, through the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles, provide a foundation for understanding the life of Jesus and the early church.\n\nDespite the lack of specific details about his birth and death in the biblical text, Luke’s writings continue to be a vital part of Christian doctrine and history, highlighting his significant role as an evangelist and historian of the early Christian era.\n\nInteresting Facts about Luke\n\nSaint Luke is a fascinating figure with several intriguing aspects related to his life and contributions to the New Testament:\n\nGentile Author: Luke is believed to be the only Gentile author of the New Testament books. His perspective provides a unique viewpoint in the predominantly Jewish context of the Bible’s authors.\n\nCompanion of Paul: Luke was a close companion of Paul the Apostle. His writings in the Acts of the Apostles often include first-person narratives, especially in the “we” passages, indicating his presence on some of Paul’s missionary journeys.\n\nPhysician by Profession: Colossians 4:14 refers to Luke as “the beloved physician,” suggesting that he had a medical background. This profession may have influenced his detailed and compassionate portrayal of Jesus’ healings.\n\nDetailed Historian: Luke is known for his meticulous historical details in both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. His attention to detail has provided valuable insights into the cultural and political context of the 1st century.\n\nEmphasis on Women and Marginalized: Luke’s Gospel uniquely highlights the roles of women and marginalized individuals in Jesus’ ministry, emphasizing themes of inclusion and social justice.\n\nArtist Tradition: Though not mentioned in the Bible, tradition holds that Luke was also an artist and possibly the first iconographer, having painted portraits of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and other prominent biblical figures.\n\nRelated – Interesting Facts about Mary Magdalene Here!\n\nLongest Contribution to the New Testament: Although Paul wrote more books, Luke’s contributions to the New Testament (the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles) account for the largest portion by word count.\n\nDedication to Theophilus: Both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are addressed to an individual named Theophilus. The identity of Theophilus remains a matter of speculation, with theories ranging from him being a high-ranking Roman official to a symbolic representation of Christian believers (“friend of God”).\n\nEmphasis on the Holy Spirit: Luke’s writings place significant emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in the life and ministry of Jesus, as well as in the early Christian community.\n\nPatron Saint: Luke is considered the patron saint of artists, physicians, surgeons, students, and butchers, reflecting the diverse aspects of his life and the impact of his work.\n\nSaint Luke’s contributions extend beyond his written works, influencing various facets of Christian tradition, art, and theology.\n\nHis unique perspective and detailed accounts continue to offer valuable insights into the life of Jesus Christ and the early church."
