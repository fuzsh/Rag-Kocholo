Promise 1.0, created in 2015, is a state aid program aimed at supporting Rhode Islanders attending college in the state. Not only does it provide financial support to full-time students, it also incentivizes talented Rhode Islanders to remain in the state, as well as provide support to the higher education sector. The program is a crucial component of the State’s higher education policy, increasing access to education and supporting the long-term health of the State’s economy.\n\nKey Facts:\n\nFrom 2015 to 2020, independent institutions of higher education received $2 million annually. In 2020, State funding for the program was cut to $1.5 million.\n\nPrior to 2015, state funding for student aid was much higher, with $16 million going to students in 2008. In today’s dollars, that would be the equivalent of funding the program at $21 million annually.\n\nSince its inception, non-profit colleges and universities have matched state contributions dollar-for-dollar, resulting in $26 million in scholarship funds.\n\nNearly 80,000 students attend Rhode Island institutions of higher education. Many of these students remain in Rhode Island after graduation, applying their expertise to the Rhode Island economy.\n\nNon-profit higher education is the second largest non-governmental sector in the state, after healthcare. The sector spends $4.6 billion in local communities and supports 30,000 jobs across the state.\n\nContact your legislators:\n\nPlease contact your legislators to voice your support for #Promise4All. Find your senator and representative HERE. For sample language in support of this increase, please click HERE.\n\nWelcome Crystal Williams\n\nAICU Rhode Island is delighted to welcome Crystal Williams as the new President of Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nWilliams most recently served as Boston University’s inaugural vice president and associate provost for community and inclusion since 2020.
