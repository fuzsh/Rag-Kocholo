This is a complex task given that we are a binational CSO (Mexico-USA), and we work with both fiscal years; following the fiscal and accounting rules of both countries. At the beginning of hercareer Lupita worked in private sector companies, until she worked for the first time in a CSO, Sol del Niño Museum, where she worked for just over 9 years.

At the end of his studies, he worked 5 years in geophysical exploration projects to locate groundwater and mineral storages in arid areas of Guanajuato, San Luis Potosí and Puebla. These experiences were his introduction to drought and the impact of anthropogenic actions on the pollution of water resources, which inspired him to do more for the environment. Since June 2017, he has been the coordinator of hydrological monitoring at Sonoran Institute, where he leads a team of water professionals that collects hydrological data to measure environmental impacts in the Colorado River Delta. He turns data into information that is the scientific basis for decision-making in water management. He collaborated in designs and ecological restoration plans where he identified areas that require actions to improve hydrological connectivity and optimize the use of water that sustains the flora and fauna of the region.
