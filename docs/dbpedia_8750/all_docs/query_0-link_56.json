There is a parking lot for the building so you do not have to pay for parking.\n\n1351 South County Trail - East Greenwich: We are located within the Greenwich Medical Center Office Park. When you enter from South County Trail, continue straight to the second building on your right. When you enter the building, we are on the first floor immediately to the right upon entering.\n\n111 Brewster Street - Pawtucket: We are located on the lower level of the Primary Care Center. We are the building beside the old Memorial Hospital, and we share a parking lot with the hospital. Look for the American Flagpole. Go through the sliding glass door, where security is located. Take the stairs or elevator on the right down to the lower level."
