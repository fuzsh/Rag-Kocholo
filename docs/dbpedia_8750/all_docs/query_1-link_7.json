        "text": "Doja Cat doesn’t plan to be under the doctor’s orders anymore.\n\nThe newly minted pop star is distancing herself from controversial music producer Dr. Luke, who for years has been embroiled in a legal battle with singer/songwriter Kesha.\n\nDoja Cat, whose given name is Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini, said she hadn’t “worked with [Luke] in a very long time,” and also hinted that he may have taken more credit than he was due for her breakout success.\n\n“There’s s--- that he’s credited for, where I’m like, ‘Hmm, I don’t know, I don’t know if you did anything on that,’” she told Rolling Stone magazine. “The point is he’s gotten some credit for s---. And, y’know, it’s whatever. I don’t think I need to work with him again. I don’t think I need to work with him in the future.”\n\nShe quipped, “It was definitely nice of me to work with him.”\n\nThe “Kiss Me More” hitmaker, who herself has skirted controversy in the past, later walked back those comments in an email to the outlet noting that she “may have said something that someone could interpret as me saying that [Dr. Luke] had taken credit on things he didn’t deserve to.”\n\n“I just want to be clear that I have no firsthand knowledge of that being the case and I don’t want to participate in the rumor mill,” she added. “The credits on my music are accurate, and I don’t want to imply anything else.”\n\nThe 26-year-old Tarzana, California, native added that she made her initial remarks due to “sensitivities in the past about certain people attributing my general success to the work of others — in particular, men.”\n\nThe former Soundcloud rapper’s debut EP “Purrr!” and her two subsequent albums, “Pink” and “Planet Her” were released through Dr. Luke’s Kemosabe Records.\n\nThe award-winning producer, whose real name is Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, was nominated for a record of the year Grammy Award in 2021 for Doja Cat’s chart-topping single “Say So” under the pseudonym “Tyson Trax.”\n\nUnder his legal name, Dr. Luke currently has a nomination for album of the year for this year for her acclaimed “Planet Her” opus.\n\nKesha has accused Dr. Luke of sexual assault during their years-long partnership, allegations which he has vigorously denied.\n\nBefore the disgracing controversy, the 48-year-old Providence, Rhode Island-born protege of Swedish super-producer Max Martin crafted music for Rihanna, Britney Spears, Shakira, Nicki Minaj, Flo Rida, Ne-Yo and scored hits for Pink, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson and Miley Cyrus."
