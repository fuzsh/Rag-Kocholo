        "text": "Rhode Island, stand up.\n\nLast night, at the 65th Grammy Awards, Rhode Island native Viola Davis achieved a rare and prestigious achievement: EGOT status.\n\nAfter winning an Emmy, Oscar, and Tony, Davis secured her coveted status after winning a Grammy for her performance of the audiobook for her memoir, “Finding Me.”\n\n“I just EGOT!” she shouted as she accepted the award with a bright smile.\n\nDavis is the third Black woman to achieve this status, alongside Whoopi Golberg and Jennifer Hudson, and she is the first person from Little Rhody to have the holy grail of titles.\n\nViola’s Hometown\n\nShortly after being born in South Carolina in 1965, Viola Davis and her family moved to Central Falls, Rhode Island where she grew up. She attended Central Falls High School and credits her alma mater for her love of stage acting. It’s there that her love for the arts blossomed.\n\nA Rhode Island College Grad\n\nDavis majored in theater at Rhode Island College and participated in the National Student Exchange before graduating in 1988. She attended Julliard School after that and starred in her first professional stage role in 1992.\n\nFor the past thirty years, Davis has been cultivating one of the most impressive acting careers of this generation.\n\nThe Best Representative for Rhode Island\n\nAs a Rhode Island native, I have followed Davis’s career in complete awe. Having a woman like Davis represent the Ocean State fills me with such pride, and truthfully, it makes me work even harder.\n\nShe is a living example that greatness can be achieved in even the smallest of places if you work hard enough, and Viola Davis is the definition of hard work."
