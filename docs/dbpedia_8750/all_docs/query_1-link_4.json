        "text": "Have you ever turned on the network news on television and said, \"I know I've seen that face before, but where?\"\n\nMany anchors and reporters on cable network news and over-the-air news broadcasts come from local television markets. We all start someplace.\n\nSmall television and radio markets are often breeder markets for up-and-coming talent. It's kind of like the minor leagues in professional sports. Some make it to the majors, but most do not.\n\nOver the years I have been a part of the broadcast industry, I have known or watched young, talented broadcasters chase that dream.\n\nThe Providence, Rhode Island, television market has produced several stars. Some are content to remain in Providence -- a big fish in a small pond -- while others move on to larger markets such as Boston, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Still, others hit the network level.\n\nSome notable names who transitioned from Providence television news to the networks include CNN's Alisyn Camerota, who worked for WLNE-TV Channel 6. Kristen Welker, also from WLNE, landed at NBC News.\n\nMike Gorman left WPRI-TV 12 for NBC Sports Boston. The late Mark Haines, a Channel 12 alum, worked for CNBC. WPRI reporter Charles Rocket, now deceased, was a regular on NBC's Saturday Night Live.\n\nWJAR-TV 10 seems to have produced the most network stars. Brooke Anderson and Denise LeClair Cobb went to work for CNN. Jack Edwards and Steve Bethiaume landed at ESPN. Dylan Dreyer, Kathryn Tappen, Meredith Vieira and Matt Lauer wound up at NBC.\n\nPerhaps the biggest network star to launch from Providence is Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour reports for CNN and PBS and has worked for ABC and NPR.\n\nBorn on January 12, 1958, in London, England, Christiane Maria Heideh Amanpour graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1983, summa cum laude, and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.\n\nAmanpous worked for WJAR-TV during college as an electronic graphics designer before becoming a reporter.\n\nShe is divorced from James Rubin and has one child."
