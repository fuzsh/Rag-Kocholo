        "text": "Lukasz Gottwald known professionally as Dr. Luke, is an American record producer, songwriter and singer. Gottwald is known for working with Kesha, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne and other famous acts. He has been working with Kim Petras since 2016.\n\nWork with Kim\n\nBodies of work:\n\nEra 1 (Singles, 2017-2019)\n\nTURN OFF THE LIGHT, VOL. 1 (EP, 2018)\n\nClarity (Album, 2019)\n\nTURN OFF THE LIGHT (Album, 2019)\n\nSingles:\n\nReminds Me (2020)\n\nMalibu (2020)\n\nUnreleased songs:\n\nDark Part Of Your Heart\n\nOther songs:\n\nANYMORE\n\nControversy\n\nSince her breakthrough, Petras has faced endless backlash for working with Dr. Luke, due to the allegations that he has abused Kesha physically, mentally and sexually. About that Kim has made a public 'apology', saying \"While I've been open about my positive experience with Dr. Luke, that does not negate or dismiss the experience of others or suggest that multiple perspectives cannot exist at once.\"[1] She repeated her apology in an interview for Genius, and said the whole conflict was about “a lawsuit that I don’t want to talk about, that I have nothing to do with.”\n\nHer fans and critics have continued to question why the artist hasn’t moved on to less controversial collaborators. The answer likely lies in her aforementioned publishing deal, which she signed with Luke’s Prescription Songs while she was still a struggling songwriter.\n\n“Yes, he signed me. It’s like that,” she answered to Genius. Whether Petras believes Dr. Luke or not is mostly irrelevant when her career is tied to his. Attempting to formally cut ties with the producer, even amidst his current level of scrutiny, could involve a legal battle and would in all likelihood be an epic act of career self-sabotage right when her music is hitting its stride.[2]\n\nAlthough Luke is credited on all her published work, it's likely that they didn't work together for every single song she's done, and he receives credits because of their publishing contract.\n\nOn August 2019, Kim said in an interview for The Sun that she's thinking about cut her ties with Luke. When asked if she'll work with him in the future, she responded \"I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not.\"[3]\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nKim met Dr. Luke through Aaron Joseph, when he send him an e-mail with some songs they worked together. Luke quickly contacted them to sign a publishing contract.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n<references>"
