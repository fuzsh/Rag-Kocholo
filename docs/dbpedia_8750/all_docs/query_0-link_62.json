        "text": "Des Moines, Iowa (KWQC) - Luke Toporowski has loved hockey for longer than he can remember.\n\n“I think my parents got me on the ice when I was two years old maybe not even walking and right then I probably fell in love with it,” Toporowski said.\n\nA few years before Luke was born, his dad moved to the Quad Cities to play for the Mallards.\n\n“When I first came here I had no idea about the Quad Cities, I’m originally from Canada,” said Kerry Toporowski.\n\nLuke is the son of Kerry Toporowski, one of the greatest Mallards of all time. After moving all over the country throughout his hockey career, Kerry decided to call Bettendorf home with his family.\n\n“After playing here for a couple years, the town warms up, the people are great people the town is great cities the Quad Cities and the schools you can’t beat the school system here,” Kerry said.\n\nThe biggest drawback was the lack of hockey opportunities. Kerry’s two sons and daughter played for the Quad City Ice Eagles but after a few years, the family was ready for a bigger challenge.\n\n“If they wanted to move on and continue to excel we had to make the decision to play elsewhere,” Kerry said.\n\nNearly every day for several years the Toporowski family would drive to Chicago for practice and games.\n\n“It’s tough I mean it makes you grow up a lot obviously having to do homework in the car and have to kind of be good with time management,” Luke said.\n\nThe hard work paid off. Nearly two years ago, Luke became the first Quad City Native to ever sign an NHL contract.\n\n“You want to make the NHL and chase those dreams you’ve had since you were four or five years old,” Luke said.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Luke’s job has taken him all over the Country. Most recently spending nearly two seasons playing for the Providence Bruins in the AHL, the primary development team for the NHL’s Boston Bruins. Getting to Rhode Island for the games wasn’t easy for the Toporwski family.\n\n“We’d only get out there two-three times a year and we’d try to watch the games on the computer,” Kerry said.\n\nThat all would change last month. The Bruins traded Luke to the Minnesota Wild sending Luke to the the Wild’s AHL team in Des Moines.\n\n“It’s kind of like a dream come true everybody gets to watch you play and support you and it’s kind of the people who got you there,” Luke said.\n\nNow those people who got Luke where he is, are at nearly every game. Including Luke’s older brother Jake who is an assistant coach for the Des Moines Buccaneers junior hockey team.\n\n“He’s over every night for dinner unless one of us is out of town he’s over every night for dinner right after practice, 2 p.m. he’s getting there,” said Jake.\n\nQuality time with family, including Luke’s newest family member, his 3-month-old niece.\n\n“He’s in love with her I know he’s said that in some other interviews but it’s not an understatement he takes her out of my arms if I’m holding her something he loves her, he’ll babysit her if we need her babysat,” Jake said.\n\nWherever Luke Toporowski’s career takes him, he’ll have nothing but gratitude for this stop in Iowa and the people who helped him get so far.\n\n“You kind of are grateful for every day you wake up and you get to pursue this as a job,” Luke said. “They made tons of sacrifices so like I said I wouldn’t be here without them and I’m just grateful for that.”\n\nLuke Toporowski is the first Iowan to ever play for the Iowa Wild. He’s hoping to become the fifth Iowan to make it to the NHL."
