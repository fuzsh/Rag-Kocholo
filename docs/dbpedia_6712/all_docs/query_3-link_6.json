        "text": "Hi all,\n\nAfter recieving a set of celestron 20 x 80's the other day and having a play with them, I wasn't convinced they were up to much. Nothing with them being too big (as I have a tripod) just that the eye relief was awkward.... might jus be my big nose!! and the f.o.v just didn't seem right - maybe a knocked prism. So I decided to send them back and go for these instead. I know I have compromised with the size of the objective lenses but they are a much more managable size all in all.\n\nWhat do u think??\n\nHi Austin,\n\nAre you able to offer any more details re quality and performance, please? In particular I have a few specific questions in mind: How evident is the chromatic aberration looking at, say, Jupiter? Do stars come to pinpoint focus, and what proportion of field if only in centre? Is the eye relief sufficient for spectacle wearers? And can you confirm if the claimed closest focus distance (which I've seen quoted in two different places as 9m and 10.5m) is approximately correct (say well under 15m)?\n\nLike you I started looking at 20x80s, trying the Celestron first - but one of my critical uses is wildlife spotting in a hedgerow 15-20m away, and close focus was too far. Then hunting around I found the Revelation ones which a question to shop said focuses down to 10m, so I ordered, and was shocked to find closest focus actually about 40m! They went back, more searching, challenging claims of short distance asking for confirmation, with several that initially said <15m turning out to be considerably more: Bressler 20x80, Konus Giant 20x80, and then the Visionary 20x80 was confirmed as 15m so I ordered - and was again disappointed, this time 23m. Nice clear image when in focus, even handheld for a couple of minutes, but not close enough for my use. With clear skies I tried them for astro use - nice and sharp on stars, but whan I looked at Jupiter the CA gave about half a diameter blue semi-disk on one side and yellow on the other side: it was horrible! All the other 20x80s under several hundred Â£ have closest focus distances >15m, so now I'm reduced to considering 20x60 even though it'll have a much darker image.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nPaul"
