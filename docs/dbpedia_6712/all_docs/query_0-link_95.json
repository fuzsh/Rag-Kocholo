        "text": "The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects orbiting it. The solar system is enormous and held together by the Sun’s tremendous gravitational pull that holds the planets and the asteroids in orbit. The solar system also comprises eight planets around the Sun. These planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical paths known as orbits. The solar system also contains small irregularly shaped objects made of rock, metal, and carbon called asteroids.\n\nImportant Solar System Questions with Answers\n\n1) How many planets are there in the Solar System?\n\n(a) 9\n\n(b) 8\n\n(c) 7\n\n(d) 10\n\nAnswer: (b) 8\n\nExplanation: There are eight planets in the Solar System. The eight planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n2) Which planet is the closest to the Sun?\n\nMercury is the closest planet to the Sun. At an average distance of just 57.9 million km, Mercury orbits closer to the Sun than any other planet.\n\n3) Match the following\n\n1. Biggest Planet\n\nVenus\n\n2. Smallest Planet\n\nNeptune\n\n3. Coldest Planet\n\nJupiter\n\n4. Hottest Planet\n\nMercury\n\nAnswer:\n\n1. Biggest Planet\n\nJupiter\n\n2. Smallest Planet\n\nMercury\n\n3. Coldest Planet\n\nNeptune\n\n4. Hottest Planet\n\nVenus\n\n4) Solar System is located in _____ galaxy.\n\nAnswer: Milkyway\n\nExplanation: Solar system is located in the Milkyway galaxy.\n\n5) Why is it called the Solar System?\n\nThe planetary system is named the “solar system” because the Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, “Solis,” and anything related to the Sun is known as “solar.” Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nQ6) Where do most comets arrive from?\n\nComets are believed to have two sources. Short-period comets originate from the Kuiper Belt, and Long-period comets originate from the Oort Cloud.\n\n7) How did the Solar system originate?\n\nThe Solar System originated 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.\n\n8) What is a solar system made of?\n\nThe solar system consists of the Sun—an average star in the Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies orbiting around it:\n\nEight planets with approximately 170 known planetary satellites\n\nNumerous asteroids, some with their satellites\n\nComets and other icy bodies\n\nExpansive reaches of highly tenuous gas and dust known as the interplanetary medium\n\n9) Is solar system expanding?\n\nSolar systems do not expand despite existing in an expanding universe because of the binding force of gravity.\n\nQ10) Is Sun the hottest in the Solar System?\n\nThe hottest place in the Solar System is the Sun. The temperature of the Sun’s surface is a mere 5,800 Kelvin, while the centre of the Sun is around 15 million Kelvin.\n\nPractice Questions\n\nWhy does the Moon change its shape daily?\n\nMeteors are not visible during the day. Explain the Reason.\n\nExplain why we see the same side of the moon.\n\nDo stars emit light only during the night?\n\nAssume the distance between earth and sun becomes half of its present distance. What is likely to happen to life?\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSolar System\n\nBlack Hole\n\nLifecycle of Stars\n\nWhy do stars twinkle?\n\nDwarf Planets\n\nSuggested Videos\n\nStay tuned to BYJU’S and Fall in Love with Learning!"
