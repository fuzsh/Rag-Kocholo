        "text": "Saturn Electronics Corporation was founded by Nagji Sutariya in September of 1985. From the beginning, SEC focused on quality. One of the most important principles was to learn from, but never repeat, mistakes. From this seemingly simple philosophy, Saturn grew 25% yearly over the next fifteen-years passing the $20 million threshold in 2000. Finally, it was Saturn's fiscal discipline that allowed us to survive the North American PCB market crash of 2001 / 2002.\n\nQuality Manufacturing\n\nWe attribute our continuous growth to growing customer satisfaction, a growing referral base, and the overall increase in the use of electronics in manufacturing. Management never forgot the original focus on quality. As a result, Saturn achieved its ISO9002 certification in 1985. In 1998, Saturn became only the fifth PCB Fabricator in the United States to achieve QS9000 certification. Next, we turned our focus towards strict, customer-specific certifications. Between 1998 and 2000 we invested approximately $3 million towards quality and capacity improvements and were certified for high-reliability, safety, and under-hood applications.\n\nManufacturing Capacity"
