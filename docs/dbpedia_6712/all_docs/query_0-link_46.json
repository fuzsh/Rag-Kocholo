        "text": "On the surface, Saturn seems calm. But the appearance of the largest and hottest vortex ever seen in the solar system has astronomers thinking that Saturn’s atmosphere has more going on than meets the eye.\n\nThe oval-shaped maelstrom was created when two warm spots in Saturn’s roiling cloud deck merged. The subsequent storm was invisible to human eyes but shone brightly in infrared wavelengths. It was accompanied by an unprecedented temperature spike that released tons of energy, equivalent to an enormous planetary belch.\n\nAll this action is linked to the “Great Springtime Storm” that raged through Saturn’s northern latitudes over late 2010 and much of 2011. This global storm was the largest recorded tempest since 1903 and grew so large that the storm head traveled all the way around the planet and encountered its own tail. After the most visible effects subsided, scientists considered the storm over.\n\nTemperatures in the storm skyrocketed to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and a huge amount of ethylene – a colorless and odorless gas not typically seen on Saturn — suddenly appeared. The merging hotspots produced 100 times more ethylene than scientists thought possible on Saturn and no one knows where it came from. An odd soupy mixture of gases was also spotted encircling the vortex.\n\nThe bright beacon is now expected to slowly fade away and be gone by 2013, though astronomers wonder if there are further surprises to be had on Saturn. Two papers describing the vortex will appear next month, one in the Astrophysical Journal and another in the journal Icarus.\n\nVideo: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nNo, You Can’t Have a Solar-Powered Passenger Plane\n\nGuilt-free air travel is a beautiful dream, but there’s simply no way to get enough solar energy to keep a cabin full of people in the air.\n\nNo, the Seine Cleanup Wasn’t a Failure\n\nThe goal of the Seine-cleansing project is to produce swimmable conditions for the people of Paris for years to come—the Olympics was just a milestone in getting there.\n\nTuariki Delamere’s Somersault Could Have Launched a New Era in the Olympic Long Jump\n\nThe New Zealander came up with a better way to jump, using a front flip in midair. But the sport’s stodgy authorities shut him down before the 1975 Games.\n\nAbortion Rights Groups Rush to Back Kamala Harris\n\nActivists believe that the vice president, who is already the leading voice for reproductive rights in the Biden administration, will champion their cause.\n\nThe Mysterious Discovery of ‘Dark Oxygen’ on the Ocean Floor\n\nResearchers believe they have discovered oxygen being produced 4,000 meters below the sea surface, and think polymetallic nodules—the sought-after bounty of deep-sea miners—could be the source.\n\nHow to Save Your Home From a Wildfire\n\nSmall improvements to the roof, siding, windows, and vents of your house can make a big difference when threatened by the risk of flames.\n\nThe New Gods of Weather Can Make Rain on Demand—or So They Want You to Believe\n\nIn a gold-trimmed command center on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, scientists are seeking to wring moisture from desert skies. But will all their extravagant cloud-seeding tech—planes that sprinkle nanomaterials, lasers that scramble the atmosphere—really work at scale?\n\nNewly Discovered Moon Caves Could One Day House Astronauts\n\nAnalysis of lunar imagery has ended a longstanding debate over whether there are accessible underground areas on the Moon; an emptied lava tube in the Sea of Tranquility is of particular interest."
