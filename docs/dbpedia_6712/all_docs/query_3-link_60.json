        "text": "Hosted Jupyter and Streamlit Dashboards, ML Model Deployment and Scheduled Jobs\n\nThe top rated cloud ML platform that runs on every cloud. Loved by data scientists and IT Security alike.\n\nAwards\n\nManaging the cloud for ML teams is painful\n\nCloud resources are expensive. If someone leaves something on when they go on vacation they could blow the monthly budget.\n\nSecurity is critical. One wrong move and someone can expose proprietary data and intellectual property on the internet.\n\nWhen individuals configure their own servers you end up with multiple ways of doing the same thing, and no deployment is reproducible.\n\nScaling parallel jobs is hard. Dask and Ray clusters can be hard to run efficiently with fault tolerance.\n\nSaturn Cloud: How it works\n\nStep 1: Configure credentials for data access and Git\n\nCode that runs in Saturn Cloud is just vanilla Python and R code. We load your code from Git and it reads data from the same place it currently reads from. We use IAM roles when possible to authenticate and and encrypted secrets otherwise.\n\nStep 2: Specify the libraries your code needs\n\nEverything running in Saturn Cloud runs in a Docker container. Bring your own docker images, or customize our images with the Saturn Cloud image builder. Developing in docker means your work is much more reproducible..\n\nStep3: Develop in the cloud with JupyterLab, PyCharm or VS Code\n\nSaturn Cloud Development Workspaces feel like developing on laptops, except you have much better hardware. Workspaces support SSH so you can connect any desktop IDE like PyCharm or VS Code.\n\nStep 4: Deploy your work as a deployment or a job\n\nCode deployed in Saturn Cloud runs in the exact same environment it was written in. Deployments can be any web application. Build dashboards with Streamlit, Shiny, Plotly, or Bokeh. Deploy models with Bento ML or FastAPI. Jobs can be any script. Use them for daily ETL or model retraining.\n\nAvailable on Every Cloud\n\nGet the best prices and services across multiple cloud providers with the same user interface\n\nTech specs\n\nWhat's Included\n\n&check;Jupyter and R development environments\n\n&check;Support for desktop IDEs including PyCharm and VSCode\n\n&check;Training, fine-tuning and data processing jobs\n\n&check;Job Scheduling\n\n&check;Model deployment including endpoints for LLMs\n\n&check;Managed Dashboards including Streamlit, Plotly, Bokeh and Panel\n\n&check;Fine grained access control including IAM role support\n\n&check;Administrative tools, cost controls, and quotas\n\n&check;Installation within your cloud account and VPN\n\n&check;Support for restricted internet access and transparent proxies\n\nAvailable Integrations\n\n&check;Model versioning\n\n&check;Model monitoring\n\n&check;Experiment tracking\n\n&check;Vector databases\n\n&check;Data storage and data warehouses\n\n&check;Enterprise identity providers and SSO\n\n&check;Connections to on-premise infrastructure\n\n&check;Networked storage\n\n&check;Intrusion detection and response platforms"
