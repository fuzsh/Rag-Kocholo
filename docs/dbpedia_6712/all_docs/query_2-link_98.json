        "text": "From the guys who brought you the excelent look into the future of Buick a few weeks back, here comes a preview (with a bit of artistic license) for the future of Saturn here in North America.\n\nGMI's Revitalization in Action: The Dream Saturn Lineup Debuts!\n\nA summary in photos:\n\nGMI/RIA\n\n2011 Saturn Signal (Opel Corsa)\n\n(New base model for Saturn brand, likely competitor to Ford Fiesta and the like when it hits US shorts in the near-future- Ed.)\n\n2011 Saturn Astra (Opel Astra)\n\n(If the new car is the next-best-thing to the Golf, this should match the MKVI once again. Look for more standard power, better fuel economy, and a slightly higher price- Ed.)\n\n2010 Saturn Sky (Opel GT)\n\n(The current success of the Sky guarantees a successor, albeit a non-radical change. More power is the name of the game, with a wider assortment of engine options and trim levels- Ed.)\n\n2012 Saturn VUE (Opel Antara)\n\n(Expect more power, more fuel economy, and all together a better competitor to the upcoming VW Tiguan and the future CR-V and RAV4- Ed.)\n\n2012 Saturn Aura (Opel Vectra) [May be pushed-up to 2010-Ed.]\n\n(If the current Aura is a surprise, prepare to be shocked by the next Aura. A near-identical match to the European cousin, the Aura should receive like other Saturns, more power and more fuel economy- Ed.)\n\n2012 Saturn Outlook\n\n(Expect much the same with the Outlook, albeit with improvements everywhere, and the inclusion of a slightly de-tuned model so Saturn can distance itself a bit from the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave- Ed.)\n\n2011 Saturn Switch\n\n(What do you think that is going up against? GM doesn't want the Ridgeline to sit alone, so here is the alternative- Ed.)\n\nThoughts?\n\nWhy? - what great, memorable cars did they produce before GM took over in 1929?\n\nSorry, my mistake. Should have been more accurate. Before the 90's, Opel was somewhat free to do what they liked. They were really succesful and making big money. Then the Americans came (don't know the exact year, could have been end of the 80's too) with the brilliant idea that Opel could make even more money if they saved on production, engineering and other costs. Only it wasn't that brilliant actually. These measures had a negative result on the build quality and the sales dropped. It might also be the cause of Opel being late with building an MPV and succesful SUV, but I'm not sure about that. Although Opel is almost back on his feet again, I don't like any of the cars they produced the last 20 years.\n\nSorry, my mistake. Should have been more accurate.

It might also be the cause of Opel being late with building an MPV and succesful SUV, but I'm not sure about that. Although Opel is almost back on his feet again, I don't like any of the cars they produced the last 20 years.\n\nLets be honest here, simple economics states that having one company build a stupid amount of products that do essentially the same thing is less cost effective than building one, maybe two products that do the same thing. We (Americans) didn't do anything to 'screw-up' Opel, that was part of their own doing. For the last 10 or so years, our Opels have been heavily re-badged, with all-new exteriors and interiors. The only car that ever came close to looking like an Opel was the previous generation Chevrolet Malibu, and obviously the current Saturn Aura which gladly accepts that it is a direct-descendant of the Vectra.\n\n...What it comes down to here is that GM is tapping a company for cars that are quite a lot better than the current crop of American and in many cases Japanese sedans/coupes/hatchbacks/etc, and GM finally realized that it was idiotic to let these products go to waste. By aligning Saturn with Opel/Vauxhall (and to a lesser extent Holden, w/o VE), they bring great cars to North America, wipe the smirk off of Toyota's face, position themselves similar to VW in the marketplace, and altogether do better for the company.\n\nQuite frankly, I don't see the negative in that...\n\nJim Prower\n\nand WHY chase the Ridgeline?\n\nA lot of people over at GMI are a bit concerned over that as well, but the RMI team felt that if the Outlook is supposed to be modeled after the Pilot, a Ridgeline-like model can't be far off. Their argument is that the Ridgeline is in a segment all of its own, and while GM has no problem doing the BOF Pickups (Silverado, Sierra), they may need to get into the UB class with rising fuel prices, demands for car-like drives, etc.\n\n...The good news is that if GM does it, they'll do it right. A wide range of engine options, including a V8, not to mention a six-speed slushbox, and 'real' 4WD would all be available. That indeed is a few steps ahead of the Honda...\n\nLets be honest here, simple economics states that having one company build a stupid amount of products that do essentially the same thing is less cost effective than building one, maybe two products that do the same thing.

In order to save costs, rebadging is a good alternative if you want to be part of multiple segments on the market. Almost every manufacturer rebadges these days or develops cars together with other manufacturers. It's sad that the diversity decreases, but at least the manufacturers can survive.\n\n(Sorry for going off topic one more time):\n\nWhere I'm talking about, is that American managers once decided that Opel needed to cut costs in the development and production deparment. This way Opel would have earned higher profits for GM. Only it worked solely on the short term. On the long term the quality of the products deteriorated and the amount iof sells and profits dropped. 'Coincidentally' I dislike all Opels from after that occurance.\n\nNot to rub anything the wrong way, but all these cars are just average over here, the Vectra isn't the best saloon, the Corsa isn't the best city car, the Astra isn't the best hatch etc. Vauxhall don't really offer anythng exciting of their own, the VX220 was built by Lotus and the Monaro and R500 were built by Holden. What America is doing, is just taking the Vauxhall Vauxhalls and building them in America. They arn't bad cars, it just amuses me as to how these are going to be able to do so much for GM in the US sales wise. Most Vectra sales in the UK are probably fleet sales, Corsa's are usually bought by new drivers and Astra's arn't bad, they're an alternative to the better but more expensive Golf and Leon etc ut they can't out do the Focus for price or build. Overall there's nothing that great about them though.\n\nMost GM-educated people are well aware that the Opel/Vauxhall cars are indeed 'average' by every sense of the word, however, the European definition of average is generally better than that of American average. This is why the cars that don't change between the US and Europe (notably the Passat, Legacy, Accord/TSX, etc) are normally better than what would be their 'average' competition here in the US.\n\nGM:\n\n- Saturn Aura and Vectra are near-identical (Saturn gets a longer wheelbase, different interior).\n\n- Pontiac G6: Based on Vectra, looks nice, interior isn't very nice.\n\n- '08 Malibu: Next-best-thing to the Aura/Vectra, still based on the same platform, etc.\n\n- The Astra will be the Astra for Saturn later this year. No plans for a Chevrolet version, as that will go Delta II.\n\nFord:\n\n- Mondeo is vastly superior to the Fusion (aka Mazda 6) in looks, performance, and quality (presumably) as well.\n\n- Focus would be great if we had the MKII. We certainly do not...\n\nChrysler:\n\n- Caliber: Yeah, you know whats that like. (Read, crap)\n\n- Avenger/Sebring: Same story as above.\n\n...Just my opinion though..."
