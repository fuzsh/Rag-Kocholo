        "text": "Saturn\n\nSaturn is in the constellation of Aquarius, at a distance of 1,306,287,786.0 kilometers from Earth. The current Right Ascension is 23h 17m 55s and the Declination is -06° 51’ 46” (apparent coordinates). The magnitude of Saturn is 0.67 (data provided by JPL Horizons).\n\nSaturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is the second largest planet in the Solar System after Jupiter. It has a diameter of 116,460 kilometers and a mass of 5.68 x 10^26 kilograms, making it approximately 95 times more massive than Earth. Saturn is a gas giant planet with a composition similar to Jupiter, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of other gases. The planet is famous for its extensive ring system, consisting of numerous narrow, bright rings composed of ice particles, rock debris, and dust. Saturn has a day length of 10.7 hours and an orbital period of 29.4 Earth years. The planet has 82 known moons, with the largest being Titan, a moon with a thick atmosphere and the only known moon with stable liquid on its surface. The planet has been explored by multiple spacecraft, including NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission, which spent 13 years in orbit around Saturn and its moons.\n\nCelestial Coordinates\n\nApparent\n\nRight Ascension 23h 17m 55s\n\nDeclination -06° 51’ 46”\n\nHour Angle 23h 48m 24s\n\nSideral Time 23h 06m 20s\n\nJ2000\n\nRight Ascension 23h 16m 39s\n\nDeclination -06° 59’ 51”\n\nAdditional Information\n\nConstellation Aquarius\n\nMagnitude 0.67\n\nRise and Set Times\n\nToday's rise, transit and set times of Saturn from Greenwich, UK (all times relative to the local timezone Europe/London):\n\nAzimuth: 96.9° RISE 21:06\n\nMax altitude: 31.7° TRANSIT 2:34\n\nAzimuth: 263.1° SET 7:57\n\nVISIBILITY RIGHT NOW\n\nSaturn is above the horizon from Greenwich, UK.\n\nRight now it is placed in the South direction at an altitude of 31.60° above the horizon.\n\nGiven its current magnitude, Saturn is visible to the naked eye, easy and bright under dark skies, might be more difficult from heavily light polluted areas.\n\nGo to interactive sky chart\n\nIf you need to access this information frequently for your observations, you can create a simple customized Quick Access page, so that you can easily bookmark it in your browser favorites or add a shortcut to your mobile phones' home screen.\n\nFinder Charts\n\nSky map showing Saturn in Aquarius on August, 17 2024.

Light takes 1h 12m 37.307s to travel from Saturn and arrive to us.\n\nDistance Km 1,306,287,786.0\n\nDistance AU 8.7319945123\n\nLight Travel Time 1h 12m 37.307s\n\nThe following chart shows the distance of Saturn from Earth as a function of time. In the chart the distance data is measured in Astronomical Units and sampled with an interval of 1 day.\n\nThe value of the reported distance might be somewhat inaccurate around the times of closest approach for objects passing extremely close to Earth. The value of the distance of Saturn from Earth is also available as a real time updated value in the Live Position and Data Tracker.\n\nClosest Approach\n\nBetween 1 January 1600 and 30 December 2499, the closest approach of Saturn to Earth happens on Wed Dec 11 1619 at a distance of 8.012797 Astronomical Units, or 1,198,697,442 kilometers:\n\nDate Wed Dec 11 1619\n\nDistance Kilometers 1,198,697,442\n\nDistance AU 8.012797\n\nNOTE: values for the closest approach are computed with a sampling interval of 1 day.\n\nLight Curve\n\nThe following chart is the predicted light curve (visual magnitude as a function of time) of Saturn, according to the most recent ephemerides data. Magnitude data is sampled with a 2 days interval and there might be inaccuracies for objects changing brightness very rapidly during the course of a few days. For comets there could be large discrepancies between the observed and predicted brightness because of their highly dynamic behaviour.\n\n15 Days Ephemeris\n\nThe following table lists the ephemerides of Saturn computed for the past and next 7 days, with a 24 hours interval. Apparent celestial coordinates are provided.\n\nDate Right AscensionR.A. DeclinationDec.
