        "text": "Scientists at the University of Houston have made a major finding about Saturn’s climate that shows the planet has a big energy imbalance. A study in “Nature Communications” questions how planets evolve and how their climates change over time, especially for gas giants like Saturn.\n\nWhat is Energy Imbalance?\n\nUsing data from the Cassini probe, the team saw that Saturn’s large orbital eccentricity causes its energy supply to change a lot from season to season. The amount of solar energy Saturn receives changes a lot as it moves around the sun because of this difference. Its energy is affected by both sun radiation and deep inside heat, which adds to its complicated thermal structure and climate system.\n\nImplications for Planetary Science\n\nThis newfound imbalance on Saturn is very important for learning about how gas giants grow and change over time. It makes me think that similar imbalances might exist on other planets like Uranus, where the impacts would be stronger because of its high obliquity and eccentric orbit.\n\nCassini Mission’s Contribution\n\nThe Cassini probe, which was launched in 1997 and kept working until 2017, was a big part of this finding. NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency all worked together on the project. The information gathered has been very helpful in understanding Saturn’s energy budget and things that happen in its atmosphere.\n\nMonth: Current Affairs - June, 2024"
