        "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The solar system has a new winner in the moon department.\n\nTwenty new moons have been found around Saturn, giving the ringed planet a total of 82, scientists said Monday. That beats Jupiter and its 79 moons.\n\n“It was fun to find that Saturn is the true moon king,” said astronomer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science.\n\nIf it’s any consolation to the Jupiter crowd, our solar system’s biggest planet — Jupiter — still has the biggest moon. Jupiter’s Ganymede is almost half the size of Earth. By contrast, Saturn’s 20 new moons are minuscule, each barely 3 miles in diameter.\n\nSheppard and his team used a telescope in Hawaii to spot Saturn’s 20 new moons over the summer. About 100 even tinier moons may be orbiting Saturn, still waiting to be found, he said.\n\nRELATED: Where to go stargazing in Colorado, from parks to small towns\n\nAstronomers have pretty much completed the inventory of moons as small as 3 miles around Saturn and 1 mile around Jupiter, according to Sheppard. Future larger telescopes will be needed to see anything smaller.\n\nIt’s harder spotting mini moons around Saturn than Jupiter, Sheppard said, given how much farther Saturn is.\n\n“So seeing that Saturn has more moons even though it is harder to find them, shows just how many moons Saturn has collected over time,” he wrote in an email. These baby moons may have come from larger parent moons that broke apart right after Saturn formed.\n\nSeventeen of Saturn’s new moons orbit the planet in the opposite, or retrograde, direction. The other three circle in the same direction that Saturn rotates. They’re so far from Saturn that it takes two to three years to complete a single orbit.\n\n“These moons are the remnants of the objects that helped form the planets, so by studying them, we are learning about what the planets formed from,” Sheppard wrote.\n\nJust last year, Sheppard found 12 new moons around Jupiter. The Carnegie Institution had a moon-naming contest for them; another is planned now for Saturn’s new moons.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether any planets beyond our solar system have even more moons. For now, Saturn has the most known moons.\n\nMonday’s announcement came from the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center.\n\nHelp name the 20 newly discovered moons\n\nThe Carnegie Institution for Science is hosting a contest to name all of Saturn’s new moons.\n\nPotential names should fall under one of three categories, according to Carnegie.\n\nInuit mythology: “Two of the newly discovered prograde moons fit into a group of outer moons with inclinations of about 46 degrees called the Inuit group. All name submissions for this group must be giants from Inuit mythology.”\n\nNorse mythology: “Seventeen of the newly discovered moons are retrograde moons in the Norse group. All name submissions for this group must be giants from Norse mythology.”\n\nGallic mythology: “One of the newly discovered moons orbits in the prograde direction and has an inclination near 36 degrees, which is similar to those in the Gallic group, although it is much farther away from Saturn than any other prograde moons. It must be named after a giant from Gallic mythology.”\n\nTo participate, tweet a suggested moon name to @SaturnLunacy with the hashtag #NameSaturnsMoons and explain why you picked it. Carnegie emphasized that photos, artwork and videos were encouraged.\n\nBefore submitting a name, make sure it’s not already in use. The International Astronomical Union has an alphabetic list of existing names, as well as a searchable database. You can find more info about the naming process for astronomical objects here.\n\nThe contest opened Monday, Oct. 7, and will run through Dec. 6.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
