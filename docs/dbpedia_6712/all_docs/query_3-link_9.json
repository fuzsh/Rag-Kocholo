        "text": "Saturn's gravity is only 6% higher than Earth\n\nSaturn in fact doesn't even have a surface. \"Surface gravity\" for gas giants is defined as the 1-bar level, where atmospheric pressure is similar to Earth's. This severely limits the available materials for building and sustaining a colony and greatly complicates the problem of building anything there.\n\nAdditionally, while the \"surface\" gravity is only a little higher than that of Earth, the escape velocity from the same level is far higher...35.5 km/s, over 3 times Earth's 11.2 km/s. The delta-v cost of reaching a minimal orbit will be greater by a similar proportion. Realistically, we don't have any propulsion system capable of the sort of delta-v required to reach orbit from Saturn.\n\nJupiter has Chernobyl-level radiation...\n\nThis is an argument for not colonizing Jupiter or its inner moons, not for colonizing Saturn.\n\nVenus and Mars are bombarded with UV radiation\n\n...which can be blocked with sunscreen. Someone exposed enough to be vulnerable to UV radiation on either of these would be far more concerned about their imminent death by asphyxiation, immolation, or exposure to near-anhydrous sulfuric acid. They would not survive if similarly exposed on Saturn, either.\n\nKronothermal energy\n\nYou will not be able to simply dangle cables into the warm interior to collect energy. Aside from the wind issue, to generate power you need a conveniently accessible temperature gradient, not just a hot location.\n\nSaturn has useful chemicals and elements\n\nSaturn's atmosphere is almost entirely hydrogen and helium, with only trace amounts of other substances. Even if you could collect useful amounts of ammonia and sulfur compounds from the clouds, there is little you can do with those in the absence of, well, everything else on the periodic table. Saturn's atmosphere is cripplingly resource-poor.\n\nVenus at least has a surface you could conceivably gather materials from, and the surface of Mars is rich in useful minerals, while the toxicity issues are ridiculously overblown: perchlorates are a little more toxic than table salt, their low-level effects can be reduced with iodine supplements, they are rapidly excreted rather than accumulating in the body, and they are quite easy to remove or destroy.\n\nBad idea\n\nFirst, BillOnne's answer is quite correct - anyone who goes there is staying there permanently, the delta v to get to orbit is prohibitive. Which does not, in and of itself, make colonisation impossible, just a one way trip with no escape possible if things go wrong. Which leads to the next points...\n\nYou note (peak) wind speeds of 1700 km/hour as an advertisement for wind power. However, the real issue is 1700 km/hour relative to what. You have correctly assessed that colonists would need to be occupying airships \"floating\" in the atmosphere, since the pressures at depth would crush any human-occupied structure easily. Which means that if everything was going well, a human-occupied colony airship would be zipping along at 1700 km/hr relative to an outside observer, but at close to zero relative to the atmosphere it is floating in. Practical upshot - usable wind speed for power generation is nowhere near the windspeed perceived by an outside observer. Although there still will be relative wind speed, as described below.\n\nIt gets worse, though. Systems with high wind speed are never a uniform speed all the way through and are never a consistent speed at all altitudes. (Note that most aircraft do their best not to fly into hurricanes / cyclones - it's not the absolute speed but the windshear and turbulence that make this an activity reserved for hardened aircraft and harder pilots conducting weather research.) As Saturn's wind systems interact any habitat will be tossed around like a kite in a tornado, making normal life impossible. The difference in speeds at different altitudes will also make it impossible for any cables to allow geothermal/kronothermal power generation to last more than a fraction of a second before snapping.\n\nShort version, any colony dropped into Saturn's atmosphere will be tossed around in the very cold, stormy air, with no way for colonists to escape or find somewhere safe to effect repairs when something breaks."
