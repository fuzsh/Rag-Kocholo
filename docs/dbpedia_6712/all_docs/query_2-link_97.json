        "text": "Stephen (Steve) has been with SATURN since 1995 and holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Lehigh University. His expertise in the engineering and sales of hoists and crane components comes, in part, with working directly with the original SATURN owners. Having gained this insight, Steve can now take his motivation for continual self-improvement and transfer it to his everyday business performance.\n\nHis overall goals are to make progressive changes in all aspects of the company as well as to develop stronger client relationships.\n\nEugenio (Geno) has been with SATURN since 1978 and has learned the business from the ground up, starting as an assembler and moving up to manufacturing supervisor. For almost 20 years, he has gained immense knowledge and hands-on experience working on the manufacture, installation and repair of hoists and overhead cranes.\n\nAn immigrant from Portugal, Geno is now a United States citizen living his American dream of having his own company. His main goals are to streamline operational elements and improve overall manufacturing efficiency."
