        "text": "YAY!!! i thought for sure i was screwed with 20 pin... i got one more question. my saturn came with a crappy rf adapter and i can't seem to find RCA hook up anywhere.. i already ordered the s video hook up cause it was so cheap ($5) but i don't have any tv's with s-video so i really need the RCA hook up.\n\nDoes anyone know any good places to buy saturn stuff? Paticularly the RCA hook up.\n\ni ordered from here. i can't tell exactly what mod chip i am getting but it said it was 21 pin.. the picture makes it look like i might be getting the one with the blue wire. they have a link for the mod chip on the site that gives you installation instructions. they mentioned something about a 64 pin ic saturn and that soldering the blue wire improperly can result in a fried saturn. but then i might not be getting the mod chip that requires the blue wire and then again i may not have the 64 pin ic saturn. i think i can do it.. if i get uncomfortable i might wait for my friend to do it who is an electrician pretty much.\n\nwhy is there anything i should know?\n\nthanks for the info i will check those links out in a little bit. Is there a way to know for sure if my saturn is the 64 ic or not without opening it? i will prolly have to open it up and find out.\n\nman how fustrating to find that a lot of these mods for saturn are picky on the type of saturn you got... what happened to the all in 1 mod with instructions for all the different models? i know psx mods used to have that.\n\ni think i have the 64 pin... i am looking at the cd board and i see 2 square chips each with 16 pins on each side.. looking at the 64 pin ic thread you sent me. The pic shows a rectangle chip with less pins.\n\nSo i am assuming i have the 64 pin ic saturn. The ribbon cable is also twisted.\n\ni think my mod chip will be here on wednesday most likely.\n\nthanks for the help\n\nYeah that looks like the one. I can't be sure if its the exact same model but its definently shaped the same way with the same amount of pins.\n\ndoes the 64 ic present compatability probs with most 21 pin mods?\n\nRight now i been the swap trick and that has been working great so far. So could to direct me to a thread that specifiically gives step by step install for 64 pin ic saturn?\n\nThanks again\n\nThanks alot! A few more questions. I am a lil confused on all the different models. i know there is a 20 pin and a 21 pin saturn, but whats makes a saturn model 1 or model 2?\n\nI read everyone keeps saying 21 pin model 1 or 21 pin model 2.. whats the difference? oval buttons?\n\nIs there a 20 pin model 2?\n\nWhats makes 64 ic so imcompatable with most mods?\n\nAlso out of all these models what is the difference in terms of stability, performance and reliability?\n\nOh yeah it looks like i just got an email from jandaman saying they just shipped the product on the 20th. so it looks like i will most likely get my mod chip on thursday or friday.\n\nThanks again."
