        "text": "Saturn’s magnetic field resembles that of a simple dipole, or bar magnet, its north-south axis aligned to within 1° of Saturn’s rotation axis with the centre of the magnetic dipole at the centre of the planet. The polarity of the field, like Jupiter’s, is opposite that of Earth’s present field—i.e., the field lines emerge in Saturn’s northern hemisphere and reenter the planet in the southern hemisphere (see Earth: The geomagnetic field and magnetosphere). On Saturn a common magnetic compass would point south. Saturn’s field deviates measurably from a simple dipole field; this manifests itself both in a north-south asymmetry and in a slightly higher polar surface field than is predicted by a pure dipole model. At Saturn’s one-bar “surface” level, the maximum polar field is 0.8 gauss (north) and 0.7 gauss (south), very similar to Earth’s polar surface field, while the equatorial field is 0.2 gauss, compared with 0.3 gauss at Earth’s surface. Jupiter’s equatorial field, at 4.3 gauss, is more than 20 times stronger than Saturn’s. If one represents Saturn’s magnetic field as produced by a simple current loop with a specified magnetic moment (see magnetic dipole), then that magnetic moment is about 600 times Earth’s, whereas Jupiter’s magnetic moment is 20,000 times Earth’s.\n\nSaturn’s magnetic field is generated by the fluid motions in the electrically conducting portion of the interior of the planet. This region, in which hydrogen exists in a fluid metallic state around a central rocky core, comprises the inner half of the planet. Compared with Jupiter, less of Saturn’s mass and volume consists of this conducting metallic fluid, which may partly explain why Saturn’s magnetic field is much weaker. Jupiter’s interior is also hotter, so the fluid motions in its interior may be more vigorous, possibly contributing even further to the differences in the field strengths.\n\nSaturn’s magnetosphere is the teardrop-shaped region of space around the planet where the behaviour of charged particles, which come mostly from the Sun, is dominated by the planet’s magnetic field rather than by interplanetary magnetic fields. The rounded side of the teardrop extends sunward, forming a boundary, or magnetopause, with the outflowing solar wind at a distance of about 20 Saturn radii (1,200,000 km [750,000 miles]) from the centre of the planet but with substantial fluctuation due to variations in the pressure from the solar wind. On the opposite side of Saturn, the magnetosphere is drawn out into an immense magnetotail that extends to great distances.\n\nSaturn’s inner magnetosphere, like the magnetospheres of Earth and Jupiter, traps a stable population of highly energetic charged particles, mostly protons, traveling in spiral paths along magnetic field lines. These particles form belts around Saturn similar to the Van Allen belts of Earth. Unlike the cases of Earth and Jupiter, Saturn’s charged-particle population is substantially depleted by absorption of the particles onto the surfaces of solid bodies that orbit within the field lines. Voyager data showed that “holes” exist in the particle populations on field lines that intersect the rings and the orbits of moons within the magnetosphere.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAstronomy and Space Quiz\n\nSaturn’s moons Titan and Hyperion orbit at distances close to the magnetosphere’s minimum dimensions, and they occasionally cross the magnetopause and travel outside Saturn’s magnetosphere. Energetic charged particles trapped in Saturn’s outer magnetosphere collide with neutral atoms in Titan’s upper atmosphere and energize them, causing erosion of the atmosphere. A halo of such energetic atoms was observed by the Cassini orbiter."
