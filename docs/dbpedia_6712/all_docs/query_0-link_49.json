This energy is thought to come from the continued cooling of the planet after its gravitational collapse during the formation of the solar system. Because of this, the weather on the planet is internally driven: it depends on the energy emitted by the planet itself. On the other hand, the weather on Earth is externally driven, by the sun!\n\nSaturn has some of fastest winds in the solar system; winds have been measured up to the speed of 1800 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe planet’s rings are made up of bits of ice, dust and rock; these can range from the size of a grain of sand up to sizes larger large buildings. The rings also contain moonlets (likely chunks of the ancient body that broke up to produce Saturn’s rings) and ‘propeller’ structures (gaps in ring material thought to be caused by the moonlets). The evidence for moonlets and ‘propeller’ structures suggests there is a dynamic between Saturn’s moons and rings.\n\nMissions\n\nCassini (1997)\n\nMission to study Saturn and its moons\n\nVoyager 1 & 2 (1977)\n\nMission to explore Saturn and Jupiter, but later extended to Uranus and Neptune as well\n\nPioneer 11 (1973)\n\nFirst mission to explore Saturn"
