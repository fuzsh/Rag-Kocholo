The E15 or E20 will get it moving fast, but not too insanely fast.\n\nAlso, the motors with the black smoke just look \"wrong\" in a Saturn V.\n\nThanks for the feed back, I think I will try an AT E20-4 for the next launch, before I move up to F's. I still want it to stay low enough so I don't loose it thought..3-400' feet would be an ideal flight for me. I only launch at a rather small field compared to some of you. It's like 1000' by 300' but the winds blow the long ways.\n\n[POW]Eagle159;210314 said:\n\nI bought some D12-3 engines, which should get the Saturn to 150 feet.\n\nIs there any other engines to fly with this model to get like 300' or so feet?\n\nQUOTE]\n\nWe have a single engine version that's flown 20+ times on a D12-3 with no engine related problems. The only time it went hinky was when it hung up slightly from a dirty rod.\n\nThe key using a single D12-3 is to make sure to launch perfectly straight up, loose chutes, clean 4' rod, winds 5 mph or under. Much wind = no flight.\n\nIf you got it to 150' then you did very well. You must have built very light. Ours only hits about 100'. Personally I say cluster it but you should fly it on whatever you are comfortable with. Our 5 engine cluster does quite well on 4 A8-3's & 1 D12-3 (about 200') or 4 C6-5.s & a D12-5 (about 375'-400')\n\nVerna\n\nwww.vernarockets.com"
