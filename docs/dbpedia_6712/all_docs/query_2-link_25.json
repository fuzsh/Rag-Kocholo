        "text": "In a kiss-and- tell book about life in the executive suite at the General Motors Corporation, John DeLorean complained about the burden that paperwork imposed on top G.M. managers when he was a vice president there.\n\nBefore an executive went to a meeting, he was expected to read the advance text of every presentation to be given, Mr. DeLorean recalled. ''There were literally 600 to 700 pages a day to be read and processed,'' he marvelled in the book, ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors,'' published some years ago.\n\nLast week, General Motors formed a new company to make the Saturn, its first new brand-name since World War I, and one of the ideas is to make cars without that blizzard of paper.\n\n''They're going to have their own business systems,'' said Roger B. Smith, General Motors' chairman, and the enthusiastic patron of the new subsidiary. ''We want the minimum amount of paperwork. We've given them an 8 1/2-by-11 sheet of paper and told them to get everything they can on that, and throw the rest away.''\n\nAccording to G.M. executives and auto industry experts, the Saturn Project and the corporation that has been formed to bring the new subcompacts to market later this decade are something more than an effort to fight imports. They also represent an attempt to fundamentally change the way the automotive giant operates. The objective is to blend advanced technology with a faster-moving, trimmer management to speed up the development of new products and to cut costs sharply.\n\nG.M. is not talking about many details of the project, and indeed, many remain to be decided, according to participants. ''What exists now is an attitude and a direction, but not a lot of specifics,'' said Joseph J. Sanchez, 54 years old, the New York City native who was named as president of the Saturn Corporation last week.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
