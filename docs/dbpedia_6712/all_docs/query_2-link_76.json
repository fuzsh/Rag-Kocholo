        "text": "Saturn VIN Check: What is a Saturn VIN?\n\nThe Saturn Corporation was an American automotive company established by General Motors in 1985. It operated independently of its assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.\n\nDuring the last few years of its existence, the company had an HQ in Detroit, Michigan. It catered to the American and Canadian markets and boasted unique vehicles. However, despite its efforts, the company failed to capture a satisfactory customer base, leading to its dissolution in 2010.\n\nThe Saturn VIN decoder is a tool that provides important information about a Saturn vehicle. Saturn vehicles were produced from 1985 to 2009 by the General Motors Corporation. The VIN code for Saturn vehicles contains 17 characters, including letters and numbers, which reveal detailed information about the Saturn vehicle's production, features, and specifications.\n\nIf you need to buy a new or second-hand Saturn vehicle, EpicVIN offers online tools to help you get important information about the vehicle. Our DMV VIN check provides details about the history of any car, while our vehicle history reports can help you avoid buying a stolen or damaged vehicle.\n\nList of Saturn Models\n\nAstra\n\nAura\n\nIon\n\nL200\n\nL300\n\nLS\n\nLS1\n\nLS2\n\nLW1\n\nLW2\n\nLW200\n\nLW300\n\nOutlook\n\nRelay\n\nSC1\n\nSC2\n\nSky\n\nSL\n\nSL1\n\nSL2\n\nSW1\n\nSW2\n\nVue\n\nSaturn VIN Number Lookup\n\nThe Vehicle Identification Number is a unique code issued to every vehicle by the manufacturer. It consists of 17 characters, including numbers and letters. The first three characters tell you where the car was made, and the next five characters tell you what month it was built. The remaining characters are unique to that specific model and its matching parts. Our Saturn VIN lookup helps you verify information from the seller by telling you what each of these characters mean.\n\nWhile our free Saturn VIN check will provide manufacturing information, a vehicle history report can tell you much more. With access to government and commercial databases, we can run a vehicle owner lookup and search for accident reports, title registrations, theft reports, liens, and other information tied to the car. We collect this information in an easy-to-read report that can tip you off about potential problems including legal issues and accident damage.\n\nThe Saturn VIN decoder offers several features that make it a useful tool for anyone who needs to know more about a Saturn vehicle, such as the vehicle specifications.\n\nThe VIN consists of 17 digits and conveys all the important information about a Saturn vehicle, including its accident history, engine type, production year, model, and matching parts. So, if you're shopping around and need to run a motorcycle VIN check or an RV/ATV check, we've got you covered.\n\nWhere to Search for the VIN?\n\nWhere can you find the VIN on a Saturn? The vehicle identification number is unique to each vehicle and can be found on a wide range of official documents, including the title, registration, and insurance policy. It's also added to several locations on the car. Here are the most common places where you'll find the VIN on a Saturn:\n\nDashboard - Look at the dashboard through the windshield to find a metal plate near the bottom corner of the glass.\n\nDriver-Side Door - Check the driver-side door and look for a sticker between the sill and latch. The VIN is next to a barcode on older models. On newer models, look for a silver sticker with your VIN on it on the side of the B pillar between the front and rear doors.\n\nFirewall or Inner Fenders - The VIN plate for older vehicles is located on the firewall. More recent models may have the VIN etched into the middle of the firewall, or on one of the inner fenders.\n\nEngine or Transmission - On most models, Saturn stamped the VIN on the engine and transmission. It can be located on the rear of the engine or on the transmission bell housing. Some front-wheel drive manual transmissions have the VIN etched into the top center of the case; other engines also have it etched into the front of the block, but this is usually obscured by accessory belts and other components. Keep in mind that these numbers won't be correct if the engine or transmission were replaced.\n\nIf you don't have your vehicle identification number handy, we also offer license plate lookup, which finds and decodes the VIN for the vehicle currently registered to that plate.\n\nðŸŸ¡ Basic Report Cost: Free ðŸŸ¡ Saturn VIN Database: 1.9M+ ðŸŸ¡ Car-on-Sale Photos: Up to 100 ðŸŸ¡ Full Report: Extensive History\n\nComprehensive VIN Decoder Guide\n\nThe Saturn VIN decoder works by analyzing the 17-character VIN code and breaking it down into different sections. Each section of the code represents different information about the car, such as the country of origin, the manufacturer, the model, the year of production, and the engine type. The Saturn VIN decoder then interprets the code and provides the decoded information in a clear and easy-to-read format.\n\nCharacters 1, 2, and 3: World Make Identifier\n\nThese characters identify the country where the vehicle was manufactured, the manufacturer, and the division.\n\n1st â€“ Country\n\nCodeStandard\n\n1\n\nU.S.\n\n5\n\nU.S.\n\n2nd â€“ Manufacturer\n\nCodeManufacturer\n\nG\n\nGeneral Motors\n\n3rd â€“ Make\n\nCodeMake\n\n8\n\nSaturn\n\nZ\n\nSaturn\n\nCharacter 4 and 5: Platform and Series\n\nCodePlatform\n\nA\n\nlon\n\nAF\n\nlon 1 (Std Trans)\n\nAG/ AJ\n\nIon 2 (Auto Trans)\n\nAK\n\nlon 3 (Std Trans)\n\nAL\n\nlon 3 (Auto Trans)\n\nAZ\n\nlon 2 (Std Trans)\n\nJR\n\nLS (Std Trans)\n\nJS\n\nLS (Auto Trans)\n\nJT\n\nLS1 (Std Trans)\n\nJU\n\nLS1 (Auto Trans), LW1 (Auto Trans)\n\nJW\n\nLS2/LWS (Auto Trans), L300/LW300\n\nZE\n\nSC1 (Std Trans)\n\nZF\n\nSC1 (Auto Trans), SL (Std Trans)\n\nZG\n\nSC2 (Std Trans), SL1 (Std Trans), SW1 (Std Trans)\n\nZH\n\nSC2 (Auto Trans), SL1 (Auto Trans),SW1 (Auto Trans, LHD)\n\nZJ\n\nSL2 (Std Trans), SW2 (Std Trans)\n\nZJK\n\nL Series\n\nZK\n\nSL2 (Auto Trans), SW2 (Auto Trans, 1993-99)\n\nZM\n\nSW1 (Auto Trans, RHD)\n\nZN\n\nSC1 (Std Trans), SW2 (Std Trans, 2000-01)\n\nZP\n\nSC1 (Auto Trans)\n\nZR\n\nSC2 (Std Trans)\n\nZY\n\nSC2 (Auto Trans)\n\nCharacter 6 â€“ Body Type\n\nCodeBody Type\n\n1\n\n2dr coupe\n\n1\n\n3dr coupe\n\n1\n\n4dr coupe\n\n5\n\n4dr sedan\n\n5\n\n4dr coupe\n\n8\n\n5dr S/W\n\nCharacter 7 â€“ Restraint System\n\nCodeRestraint System\n\n2\n\nManual Belts (Dual Front)\n\n4\n\nAutomatic Belts (91-96)\n\n4\n\nManual Belts (w/Driver/Pass-Front/Side)\n\n5\n\nAutomatic Belts (w/Drive)\n\n5\n\nManual Belts (w/Driver/Pass-Front/Side)\n\nCharacter 8 - Engine Type Year Manufactured Model\n\nThe VIN is a unique serial number used to identify the engine of your vehicle. Some characters in the VIN are reused for different engines; so, itâ€™s hard to decode directly. Our search tools do this work for you.\n\nCharacter 9 â€“ Check Digits\n\nIt is generated by a formula using all North American VINs. When entering data, this helps to catch errors.\n\nCharacter 10 â€“ Model Year\n\nThere are alternate letters and numbers in this character, like 0-9. There is no use of letters that can be confused with numbers, such as \"O\" and \"Q\".\n\nCharacter 11 â€“ Factory\n\nIt identifies where the vehicle was built at its final assembly plant. You'll commonly see these Saturn factory codes:\n\nCodePlant\n\nS\n\nSpring Hill, Tennessee\n\nY\n\nWilmington, Delaware\n\nZ\n\nSpring Hill, Tennessee\n\nRemaining Characters â€“ Serial Number\n\nSerial numbers were assigned sequentially to each product line by Saturn. It is possible for two cars to have the same serial number, but they will not have the same VIN.\n\nSaturn VIN Samples\n\nSaturn recalls by VIN is a tool that can help you check your Saturn vehicle history. The VIN number consists of 17 digits and conveys all the important information about a Saturn vehicle, including accident history, engine type, production year, model, and matching parts. If you want to buy a new or second-hand Saturn vehicle, always use a VIN decoder before signing papers to avoid buying a stolen or damaged vehicle.
