        "text": "An unusual atmospheric phenomenon has been detected in our solar system’s ringed planet, Saturn.\n\nFor the first time, researchers have detected a “massive energy imbalance” in this gas giant. This suggests that the planet isn’t experiencing energy balance in the way that planetary scientists expected.\n\n“This is the first time that a global energy imbalance on a seasonal scale has been observed on a gas giant,” said Liming Li, a physics professor at the University of Houston.\n\n“Not only does this give us new insight into the formation and evolution of planets, but it also changes the way we should think about planetary and atmospheric science,” Li noted.\n\nData from the Cassini spacecraft\n\nThis discovery came from data collected by the Cassini spacecraft, which spent nearly 20 years exploring Saturn. While scouring through the data, researchers came across a huge energy imbalance on Saturn, which had previously gone unnoticed.\n\nA seasonal energy imbalance occurs when a planet absorbs more energy from the Sun than it emits back out into space during a given season. The Earth also experiences seasonal variations in the amount of sunlight received, but these variations are usually small.\n\n“Every planet gets energy from the Sun in the form of solar radiation and loses energy by emitting thermal radiation. But Saturn, like the other gas giants, has another energy input in the form of deep internal heat affecting its thermal structure and climate,” explained Xinyue Wang, a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\n\nReason behind this imbalance\n\nThe researchers reveal that the likely reason behind this is Saturn’s large orbital eccentricity. Earth’s orbital eccentricity is pretty small hence there is no substantial seasonal energy imbalance.\n\nSaturn has a more elliptical orbit than Earth, which is almost circular. This leads to great variation in the distance between Saturn and the Sun throughout the year. As a result, Saturn receives significantly more solar energy when it is closer to the Sun than when it is farther away.\n\nThis causes Saturn to undergo significant seasonal changes in absorbed solar energy.\n\n“Earth does have a measurable energy budget, but it’s primarily determined by absorbed solar energy and emitted thermal energy,” said Xun Jiang, a professor of atmospheric sciences. “Earth’s internal heat is negligible and its seasons last only a few months compared to seasons that are several years long on Saturn,” added Jiang.\n\nThis discovery could have major implications for understanding Saturn’s weather patterns. Scientists believe this energy imbalance may play a key role in developing extreme giant storms on the planet.\n\nMoreover, the current gas giant climate models assume a balanced energy budget, but this finding suggests a major revision is needed.\n\nThe team now intends to explore other gas giants, such as Uranus, which has a tilted axis and wobbly orbit. They predict that Uranus may have an even bigger energy imbalance.\n\nThe press release stated that a “flagship probe mission” is expected to be developed in the next decade to study the gas giants, which could provide more detailed observations of this atmospheric phenomenon.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications."
