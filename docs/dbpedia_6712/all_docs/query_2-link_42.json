        "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — Saturn Satellite Networks is close to securing funds for another attempt at getting its small geostationary satellite manufacturing business off the ground, according to an executive for the U.S.-based firm.\n\nThe company said in a Dec. 20 news release that equity investors have promised to fund nearly half of its $500 million Space BroadbandNetworks-1 (SBN-1) program, which comprises six identical satellites destined for geostationary orbit (GEO) in 2025.\n\nThese backers include German investment firm EMP Structured Assets and an unnamed U.S. defense contractor that Saturn vice president Kevin Reyes said would be disclosed “very soon.”\n\nReyes told SpaceNews that Saturn has a commitment letter from the Export–Import Bank of the United States, the country’s export credit agency, which it plans to initiate in the first quarter of 2023 to cover the rest of the project’s financing needs.\n\nOnce Saturn finalizes contracts with equity investors, he said the Melbourne, Florida-headquartered manufacturer would start ordering parts and conduct preliminary and critical design reviews to commence manufacturing, assembly, and testing.\n\n“Actual manufacturing and integration will start later in 2023 or early 2024,” he said via email.\n\nReyes said the company has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with “a preeminent heavy lift launch system operator” to deploy all six satellites on a single mission in the second half of 2025.\n\nDeployment delays\n\nThe project aims to put Saturn back on track following setbacks for a company established five years ago by former executives of satellite operator ABS.\n\nThe SBN-1 satellites are based on Saturn’s Intelligent Space Node (ISN) platform, which is an evolution of the NationSat platform Saturn developed three years ago after investing in NovaWurks, a satellite developer based in California.\n\nSpaceNews reported in 2019 that Intersputnik, a Moscow-based intergovernmental organization that resells satellite capacity, had signed up as a customer for the first NationSat mission. This mission was at one point slated to fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission in 2021.\n\nReyes declined to identify Intersputnik as the customer for the first NationSat, saying the mission was canceled “as the project did not materialize as anticipated.”\n\nSaturn had also once planned to deploy one or two NationSats with Northrop Grumman’s OmegA rocket in 2021 — despite not having a customer for them — before plans for that launch system were scrapped.\n\nUnlike NationSat, Saturn says its Intelligent Space Node platform uses independently steerable and shapeable beams that would enable their operators to move and tailor capacity to adapt to changing mission needs.\n\nIntelligent Space Node is also designed to operate with about seven kilowatts of power, compared with five kilowatts for the NationSat platform.\n\nIn the Dec. 20 news release, Saturn said phased array antennas from Austin, Texas-based CesiumAstro would enable SBN-1 to provide high-throughput services at more than 120 gigabits per second, despite being much smaller than typical GEO telecoms spacecraft to save costs.\n\nWhile GEO telecom spacecraft usually weigh thousands of kilograms, Reyes said SBN-1 satellites would have a mass of around 650 kilograms.\n\nSBN-1 has secured more than $1 billion in usage commitments from satellite operators and other end users, according to the news release, via commercial arrangements that include full and partial satellite leases.\n\nSaturn is still marketing the NationSat platform, which Reyes said has completed a preliminary design review and is suitable for operators and countries that prefer a dedicated mission with bespoke payloads.\n\nThe company also offers a two-kilowatt satellite platform, called MiniGEOSat, and a version of ISN designed for non-geostationary orbit (NGSO).\n\nReyes said Saturn has “executed a launch agreement” with a U.S.-based company to deploy its first satellite to NGSO in the second half of 2024.\n\nIn addition to serving payload customers, he said the mission aims to demonstrate a broadband constellation called Curvanet that is being developed by Saturn sister company Curvalux."
