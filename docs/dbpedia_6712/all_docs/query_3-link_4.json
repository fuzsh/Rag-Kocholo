        "text": "Saturn INT-20 was a S-IC with S-IVB as second stage. The S-IVB being 360 tons lighter than S-II, acceleration was terrific.\n\nBoeing suggested to remove a F1; even with four engine, payload matched that of Saturn INT-21.\n\nhttp://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/lvs/satint20.htm\n\nIn 1971, with the reusable booster cancelled, Boeing promoted a flyback S-IC. The S-IC would be turned into a giant aircraft, flying back to the Cape after jettison.\n\n(As shown in Orionblamblam APR)\n\nhttp://www.up-ship.com/eAPR/ev1n2.htm\n\nResult was the Saturn Shuttle.\n\nhttp://www.astronautix.com/graphics/s/shusat1c.gif\n\nProblem with the Saturn Shuttle = the vehicle length. The external tank ontop the S-IC sounds ok, but having a 100 tons orbiter on the side… bad.\n\nMy idea consists of INT-20 / Saturn-shuttle hybrid.\n\nThe Shuttle / external tank is replaced by a S-IVB with an Apollo CSM / LAS. This S-IVB is mounted on the side of the S-IC, a bit like the external tank is the current shuttle.\n\nResult is something like that (perdon the crude thing)\n\nhttp://s68.photobucket.com/albums/i24/Archibaldlecter/?action=view&current=Prsentation1.jpg\n\nThanks to the weight of the \"flyback hardware\" added to the S-IC, the fifth S-IC can probably be added again.\n\nThe idea driving this concept ? some fun with alt-history…\n\nNASA obtains the Saturn-Shuttle in 1971, but the orbiter / external tank are cancelled in 1974-76 as too expensive, leaving NASA with the flyback S-IC only.\n\nOf course one can delete the CSM ontop of the S-IVB and replace it by a large payload to LEO. No idea of the payload...\n\nI’m curious about this flyback S-IC… any chance it would have worked ? It is three times bigger than the actual orbiter, but its speed is also much lower (2.5km per second)\n\nOr is it just like trying to fly an A380 at mach 5 ? I mean, utterly mad ?\n\nFeedback welcome…\n\nA true 1.5 SSTO.\n\nThruth be told, the Saturn V was some amzaing machine. Just think about what follow = the S-II and S-IV were kind of expendable SSTOs, thanks to an outstanding T/W ratio.\n\nThey were close from the fatidic 92% limit (8% structure, 92% propellants = SSTO)\n\nIf you add the 1.5 SSTO to the list... darn, every Saturn stage can reach orbit !\n\nAlas, they have to be expended, because if you add TPS + recovery systems, you degrade the T/W ratio, and say goodbye to SSTO.\n\nUnless you \"reuse\" the stages... in orbit!... bring back the wet workshop concept, and apply it to this S-ID, to the S-II and S-IVB.\n\nOr, even better, rebuilt the Saturn V in orbit (!!) and fire every stage again (sounds crazy)"
