At Bellows Systems, we manufacture gas turbine exhaust expansion joints able to withstand high-temperature exhaust gases generated at high flow velocity such as the one created inside a Gas Turbine Exhaust System.

We currently carry Exhaust Expansion Joints for almost all models and variants of Solar Gas Turbines models including,

Saturn 20 – 18″ SS Expansion Joint

Centaur 40/40S – SS Expansion Joint

Centaur 50/50S – SS Expansion Joint

Taurus 60/60S – SS Expansion Joint

Taurus 70 – SS Expansion Joint

Mars 100 – SS Expansion Joint

The Expansion Joints are a critical part of turbine exhaust duct system. Turbine units create intense conditions, which consist of extreme heat, vibrations and flutter. Bellows Systems metal Expansion Joints for Solar Turbines have been design to better resist fatigue failure due to these conditions.

In addition to Exhaust Expansion Joints for Solar Gas Turbines, Bellows Systems can also provide the air inlet Expansion Joints. The composite fabric expansion joints can be custom manufactured to suite your installation.
