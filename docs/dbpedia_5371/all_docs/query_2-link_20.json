        "text": "I was looking forward to a visit to Norfolk Island ever since my girlfriend moved there for work in April. Because of my work commitments it was six months before I could visit and it seemed like forever waiting for that. But here I was finally flying in an Air New Zealand jet two hours east of Brisbane into the South Pacific. Through a break in the clouds the tiny island – 35 sq km wide – hove into view, the only landmass on the 2000km submarine Norfolk Ridge linking New Zealand to New Caledonia. It looked beautifully green to my eyes and awfully lonely.\n\nNot completely lonely. There are three islands in the group. Beyond Norfolk Island is Nepean Island (foreground) and larger Phillip Island (background). Norfolk is the only inhabited island. Access by sea is difficult to all three islands due to surf conditions and surrounding cliffs. Norfolk has had three human migrations, the earliest and least known the Polynesian population that lived here c800-1200. British settlers had hints of this settlement but it wasn’t until 1974 that archeologists found 26 pieces of obsidian in Emily Bay, which testing revealed came mostly from the Kermadec Islands near New Zealand. Those settlers disappeared for unknown reasons and their lasting heritage was the Polynesian rat which survived on the predator-free island.\n\nThe highest part of the island is 319m Mt Bates in Norfolk Island national park. It was the first sight of those aboard HMS Resolution captained by James Cook in his second voyage of discovery in 1774. Cook came ashore at what is now Captain Cook Lookout (below) and found it uninhabited island which he claimed for Britain.\n\nCook was interested in the beautiful pine trees named for the island (which he named for the Duchess of Norfolk). “The chief produce of the island is Spruce Pines which grow here in abundance, from two to three feet diameter and upwards,” Cook wrote. “It is of a different sort to those in New Caledonia and also to those in New Zealand and for Masts, Yards (etcetera) superior to both.” Norfolk’s pines and flax were crucial in Britain’s ongoing interest in the island as its Navy depended on Russian imports.\n\nWhen Britain sent convicts to Cook’s other Australian discovery at New South Wales 14 years later, Norfolk Island was a critical part of the plan. Admiralty orders to First Fleet commander Arthur Phillip were to “send a small establishment (to Norfolk) and prevent it being occupied by any other European power”. Within a month of landing in Sydney Phillip appointed Philip Gidley King governor of the island and ordered him to sail with a convoy of 22 (including 15 convicts) to begin a second British settlement in the Pacific. After failing to find landfall on the north of the island they came ashore on March 6, 1788 at “Sidney Bay” (now Kingston) on the south side.\n\nFor a few weeks the new settlers cleared land, sowed seeds and cut timber. They planted crops close to the beach then pushed back to the more fertile soil of sheltered Arthur’s Vale. They fought rats, parrots, caterpillars and worms for enjoyment of the crops but gradually built up a working supply of food. The flax plants proved unsuitable for Navy use.\n\nEast of the settlement lay the island’s only sheltered bay with a lone pine and a sandy beach. King saw several turtles in the bay and named it Turtle Bay. It was later renamed Emily Bay and today provides safe swimming and wonderful snorkeling in the coral reefs. King’s lone pine remains majestic guarding the bay.\n\nWhile Norfolk thrived, the food situation in Sydney was desperate. In 1790 Phillip sent 183 convicts and a consignment of marines to the island. First Fleet flagship HMS Sirius approached Kingston on March 19 but crashed upon the reefs in heavy surf and was wrecked. No one was killed and they got most provisions to shore. It was a terrible blow to the island and to the safety of the Sydney colony. On hearing the news Phillip contemplated ending both settlements. It took the arrival of the Second Fleet later that year to save the colony. A Slaughter Bay plaque marks the spot of the sinking and a nearby museum hosts one of Sirius’s six anchors.\n\nThe first British settlement lasted 26 years. Despite its early flourishing, Britain was concerned about the expense of upkeep, its distance from Sydney and the lack of a safe anchorage. The last convicts were removed to Van Diemen’s Land in 1814. The buildings were destroyed to prevent further use and a dozen dogs were left behind to eat what stock remained.\n\nThe island was empty for 11 years before the British found another use for it. It would become the home for the doubly damned – the worst prisoners in Sydney and Hobart. New settlers rebuilt the crumbling walls of the first settlement according to the instructions of colonial secretary Lord Bathurst: “my object was to hold out that Settlement as a place of the extremest punishment short of death”. A succession of sadistic commanders treated their prisoners with contempt far from Sydney’s gaze.\n\nBeyond hope of redemption, convicts mutinied many times without success. In 1826, 50 convicts bound their overseers, robbed the stores and took boats to Phillip Island where they were eventually re-captured. In 1834 100 convicts rose up, aiming to take charge of a boat and sail to freedom. They were overcome by the military garrison and the rising was crushed. Authorities convicted 29 men and 13 were hanged. Nine including William McCulloch are buried in Kingston Cemetery.\n\nAs well as a formidable jail, the British built a fine military barracks and a commisariat store. In 1840 a new commandant arrived named Alexander Maconochie, determined to treat prisoners as humans. Maconochie installed the mark system which gave points and incentives for good behaviour. Though welcomed on the island, Sydney authorities had doubts about his leniency and he was replaced by another martinet in 1844. The island continued with vicious commanders until Britain announced its intention to end the convict establishment in the 1850s. The island faced a new future as home for the Pitcairn islanders.\n\nThe Pitcairners arrived at Kingston in 1856 as the final prisoners left. The new arrivals were the descendants of the Bounty Mutiny in 1789. HMS Bounty under Captain William Bligh was taking breadfruit cargo from Tahiti to the West Indies when mutineers led by Fletcher Christian took command. They released Bligh and fellow officers who made a remarkable 6500km escape on a longboat to Kupang in West Timor (unaware of the new Norfolk colony a third of the distance away). The mutineers went to Tahiti and picked up native women whom they took to remote Pitcairn Island. Sexual troubles on Pitcairn caused foment and most of the men were killed but their pregnant women survived and raised families which became a peaceful settlement over the next 70 years. By the 1850s they were outgrowing their island. Their exemplary Victorian morality had many supporters in England who suggested they move to Norfolk.\n\nThough some returned to Pitcairn in the following years, most settled on Norfolk, taking the military homes in Kingston’s Quality Row. They believed Queen Victoria granted them ownership of the island, which the British disputed. They survived on rudimentary farming and whaling. An inquiry report in 1905 was dissatisfied with the level of cultivation on the island and suggested commonwealth control and the withdrawal of privileges including the use of Quality Row cottages. The Pitcairners burned the cottages in protest and gradually fanned out across the island.\n\nBy then Pitcairners shared their island with British missionaries who long coveted the pagan souls of the South Pacific. John Coleridge Patteson was the first Anglican bishop of Melanesia in 1861. He sailed across the region landing in Norfolk in 1864. Two years later New South Wales governor Sir John Young gave permission for a training school and bishop’s headquarters with a grant of 40 hectares on the west of the island. The station was established on St Barnabas Day, and the saint gave his name to the mission. By 1899 it held 210 Melanesian scholars and a large staff of missionaries. The Pitcairners were not consulted and led separate lives to Barnabas mission, though it employed some and provided a market for produce.\n\nIn 1902 the Pacific Cable Board opened a station at Anson Bay (above) and Norfolk became an important link in the Pacific cable system. The cable linked Vancouver to Fanning Island (now Tabuaeran, Kiribati), and Fiji to Norfolk where it divided to Southport in Queensland and Auckland. It provided employment and its communication facility accelerated Norfolk’s inclusion in the outside world.\n\nThat inclusion was turbocharged by the Second World War and the need for an airstrip. In 1942 Australian and American engineers selected a spot at Longridge. They cut down the penal era Avenue of Pines and completed the airport by 1943. Though the island was outside the theatre of battle, the new airport became an important link with South Pacific islands and hosted 2000 servicemen. After the war, it enabled the new industry of tourism.\n\nToday over 40 percent of the island’s GDP is generated by tourism. Most tourists arrive by air, but the cruise market is increasingly important. Pictured is P&O’s Pacific Explorer moored off Cascade on the north side of the island to allow 1600 passengers day tour access on the Sunday I was there.\n\nA third temporary groyne access has been created on the eastern side at Ball Bay. This allows Boral to tow equipment from Brisbane to redo the airport runway. The barges contain asphalt to repair and resurface the runway and materials and trucks to support an on-site mobile batch plant. A tug tows the barges and cargo from Australia in rough seas and the groyne (built from local rocks) will be dismantled at the end of the project.\n\nThough the airport project is run by Norfolk Island Regional Council, it has increased Pitcairner grievances against the Australian government. After years of mismanagement, Canberra abolished the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, with the territory now run by an Administrator and an advisory council. A new Regional Council was elected and most Commonwealth laws including taxation, social security, immigration, customs and health were extended to Norfolk Island. Islanders held a referendum in 2015 where 68 percent voted for a say in their own future, but were ignored by Canberra. Aggrieved Pitcairners set up a “tent embassy” at Quality Row. Embassy occupier Duncan Sanderson says islanders struggled with mortgages alongside the new requirements to pay Australian income tax. They pay land duties on previously untaxed ancestral properties and some are ineligible for previous pensions under Norfolk’s own welfare system.\n\nPitcairners believe they are not Australian, and Victoria granted them the island in 1856. Houses often have the Norfolk flag flying prominently next to the union flag (the Australian flag is conspicuously missing). Pitcairners consider themselves the island’s “indigenous people” and have appealed to the UN. In Norfolk’s main town Burnt Pine, the theme is continued by a Centre for Democracy and a “field of democracy” display. Each green hands placard is signed by an Islander collectively imploring the world to “unite and join their crusade for continued custodial rights.”"
