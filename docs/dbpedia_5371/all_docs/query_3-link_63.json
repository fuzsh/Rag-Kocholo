Introduction\n\nThe genus Xenobrochus, with the type species Gryphus africanus Cooper, 1973, was erected by Cooper (1981) for short-looped brachiopods having a small size, rectimarginate anterior commissure, and a loop with anteriorly convex transverse band. So far this genus is represented by eight species (Logan, 2007; Bitner, 2008). Particular species differ from each other mostly in the presence or absence of the cardinal process, the size of the outer hinge plates, and the presence of a median fold in the transverse band.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to describe a new Xenobrochus species, previously erroneously attributed to X. australis Cooper, 1981 (see Bitner, 2009). However, examination of the type material of X. australis kept at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN-BRA-78-14a) excluded the present material from that species.\n\n2. Material\n\nThe material examined here was collected during three cruises to the Norfolk Ridge south of New Caledonia, SW Pacific (Fig. 1 ). The major part of the material (272 specimens) was dredged during the cruise SMIB 8. This cruise was carried out within the research program \"Substances Marines d'Intérêt Biologique\" (SMIB) organized by the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD, formerly ORSTOM) and Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN). The aim of this program was to collect deepwater invertebrates for experimentation. The cruise SMIB 8 was carried out from 26 January to 3 February 1993 on board RV Alis (Richer de Forges & Chevillon, 1996; Bouchet et alii, 2008). A minor part of the material was dredged during the cruises NORFOLK 1 and NORFOLK 2 in 2001 and 2003, respectively (see also Bitner, 2009).\n\nThe total number of specimens is 307 (210 articulated specimens and 97 separate valves), all housed in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, under the inventory numbers NMHN BRA-3211-3221.\n\nClick on thumbnail to enlarge the image.\n\nFigure 1: Map of the Caledonian part of the Norfolk Ridge with seamounts indicated; stations with brachiopods are indicated by a star.

In the original diagnosis Cooper (1981) described the foramen as submesothyrid to permesothyrid. Surprisingly, in the diagnosis given in the Treatise (Lee, 2006, p. 2140) a foramen is described only as permesothyrid, although most species of Xenobrochus have a mesothyrid foramen. Also the size of a foramen is variable, from large to small (see X. rotundus Bitner, 2008). Similarly, outer hinge plates can vary from relatively wide (see Bitner, 2009: fig. 6 C, D) to rudimentary or absent (see Bitner, 2008: fig. 6 F, H). The main controversy concerns a cardinal process. According to the diagnoses (Cooper, 1981; Lee, 2006) it should be broad and semielliptical in all species. However, the cardinal process is not mentioned in the description of X. africanus (see Cooper, 1973; Hiller, 1986; Laurin, 1997) and the species X. translucidus has no trace of a cardinal process (Dall, 1920, p. 320).\n\nXenobrochus norfolkensis sp. nov.\n\nSynonymy: 2009 Xenobrochus australis Cooper; Bitner, p. 11, fig. 6A-D.\n\nHolotype: The specimen in Fig. 2 E-H (NMHN BRA-3211).\n\nParatypes: the specimens in Fig. 2 C, D, I-L ; Fig. 3 A-K (NMHN BRA-3212-3217).\n\nType locality: Norfolk Ridge, seamount Eponge, stn DW 146-147, 24°55'E, 168°22'E, 508-532 m.\n\nEtymology: Refers to the type locality, Norfolk Ridge.\n\nDiagnosis: Small Xenobrochus with elongate oval outline, rectimarginate; beak erect, foramen medium, mesothyrid, symphytium visible; no cardinal process, outer hinge plates triangular, loop rounded with a wide, anteriorly convex transverse band.\n\nMaterial examined: The material examined comprises 271 specimens collected during the cruise SMIB 8, 33 specimens collected during the cruise NORFOLK 1, and 2 specimens collected during the cruise NORFOLK 2.

Shell surface smooth, ornamented only by growth lines. Beak erect, beak ridges rounded. Foramen of medium size, circular, mesothyrid. Deltidial plates conjunct forming a visible symphytium. Lateral commissures straight, anterior commissure rectimarginate.\n\nVentral valve interior with pedicle collar relatively wide, excavate anteriorly. Teeth small, hooked-shape with weak swollen bases (Fig. 3 B-C ). Dorsal valve interior with short but high inner socket ridges and deep dental sockets. No cardinal process; the surface between socket ridges rough. Outer hinge plates triangular, relatively wide. Crural processes short, blunt, directed ventrally. Loop short with a broad, rounded transverse band convex anteriorly; a weak median fold on the transverse band observed in some specimens. Lophophore zygolophous. Muscle scars oval, well defined on both valves.\n\nUltrastructural analysis was carried out on the transverse section as well as on the inner surface of both valves. The shell is composed of three layers (Fig. 4). The microgranular primary and fibrous secondary layers are very thin, 4.5-6 µm and 3.5-4.6 µm, respectively. The fibres are 12.5-26 µm wide and 1.7-2.9 µm thick. The tertiary layer, 125-130 µm thick, consists of large prisms. The prisms observed on the internal surface are interlocking irregularly showing discrete character (Fig. 4 A-C ). The punctae are wide. The maximum shell thickness in X. norfolkensis is 137 µm.\n\nClick on thumbnail to enlarge the image.\n\nFigure 2: Xenobrochus norfolkensis sp. nov., SEM micrographs, cruise SMIB 8, Norfolk Ridge.\n\nA - B: dorsal view of articulated specimen, and enlargement of the posterior part to show details of the beak; st.

The additional material now available for investigation is much richer (272 specimens) and was collected earlier from the same region during the cruise SMIB 8.\n\nInitially, based on the absence of the cardinal process, the material collected during NORFOLK 1 and NORFOLK 2 was assigned by me to Xenobrochus africanus (Cooper, 1973), a species already reported from the New Caledonia region (Laurin, 1997). Nevertherless, I transferred it to X. australis Cooper, 1981, following the suggestions of one of the reviewers (Bitner, 2009). However, examination of the type material of this species allows excluding the Norfolk brachiopods from X. australis which is much larger (maximum length 15 mm), has a prominent cardinal process, very long crura and a distinct median angulation on the transverse band. None of those characters is observed in the studied material.\n\nThe presence of the cardinal process in such species as Xenobrochus indianensis (Cooper, 1973), X. agulhasensis (Helmcke, 1939), X. anomalus Cooper, 1981, X. naudei Hiller, 1994, X. rotundus Bitner, 2008, as well as in as-yet undescribed material from the New Zealand region, clearly distinguish those species from the material from the Norfolk Ridge (Cooper, 1973, 1981, 1983; Hiller, 1986, 1994a, 1994b; Bitner, 2008). X. indianensis has incurved beak and partly concealed symphytium (Cooper, 1973, 1981; Laurin, 1997), while in X. norfolkensis sp. nov. the symphytium is wholly visible. Additionally, the pedicle collar in X. anomalus is tubular and extravagantly developed (Cooper, 1981; Hiller, 1994b). In turn, X. rotundus can be distinguished from the studied specimens by its rounded outline, a small foramen and absent outer hinge plates (Bitner, 2008).\n\nOnly two species of Xenobrochus, X. africanus (Cooper, 1973) and X. translucidus (Dall, 1920) have no cardinal process like X. norfolkensis. In size X. norfolkensis is closest to X. africanus, but they differ in hinge plate width and loop outline; in X. africanus the hinge plates are rudimentary and the loop has a characteristic angular boundary between the descending branches and the transverse band (see Cooper, 1973, 1981, 1983; Hiller, 1986). In turn, X. translucidus is larger than X. norfolkensis and has a partly concealed symphytium and narrower hinge plates (Dall, 1920; Cooper, 1983).\n\nThe microstructure of Xenobrochus has here been investigated for the first time. Although the shell of terebratulides is usually built of two layers, many short-looped brachiopods including Xenobrochus have a three-layered shell (MacKinnon & Williams, 1974; Bitner, 2007). The prismatic tertiary layer in X. norfolkensis is very thick when compared with the primary and secondary layers and the fibrous secondary layer is exceptionally thin, being even thinner than the primary layer.\n\nRare traces of gastropod predation activity are also observed on the investigated specimens. Of 307 specimens 25 (~8%) bear drill holes.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe family Dyscoliidae is characterized by a very short loop with a horizontal or anteriorly convex transverse band. Of 11 members of the family five genera are living today (Lee, 2006). While the genera Dyscolia Fischer et Oehlert, 1890, and Abyssothyris Thomson, 1927, also have their representatives in the fossil record, three other genera, Goniobrochus Cooper, 1983, Acrobelesia Cooper, 1983, and Xenobrochus Cooper, 1981, are known only from modern waters. In addition, Dyscolia and Abyssothyris have a worldwide distribution, being recorded from all oceans (Logan, 2007). But Goniobrochus and Acrobelesia are monospecific and restricted to small regions; Goniobrochus to the south-east of Mar del Plata, Argentina (Cooper, 1983), while Acrobelesia to the Gulf of Gascogne and the Canary Islands, north-eastern Atlantic (D'Hondt, 1976; Cooper, 1983; Logan, 1983; Álvarez & Emig, 2005).\n\nThe genus Xenobrochus, including the species described herein, is now represented by nine species and is restricted to the Indian Ocean and West Pacific (Fig. 5 ) with a wide depth range from 65 to 1272 m (Logan, 2007; Bitner, 2008, this paper). Apart from X. africanus and X. indianensis that are recorded from the western Indian Ocean and south-western Pacific (Cooper, 1973; Laurin, 1997; Bitner, 2010), other Xenobrochus species seem to have restricted distributions: X. agulhasensis and X. naudei in the Indian Ocean off southern Africa (Hiller, 1986, 1994a). X. anomalus and X. australis are also found in the Indian Ocean; the former south-east of Marion Island (Cooper, 1981; Hiller, 1994b), the latter west of Heard Island (Cooper, 1981). In the Pacific Ocean three species are recorded. X. translucidus occurs off the Philippines and Borneo (Dall, 1920; Jackson & Stiasny, 1937; Cooper, 1983) and X. rotundus in the region of Fiji and Wallis and Futuna Islands (Bitner, 2008), while X. norfolkensis can be regarded as endemic to the Norfolk Ridge.\n\nClick on thumbnail to enlarge the image.\n\nFigure 5: Geographical distribution of the species of Xenobrochus.
