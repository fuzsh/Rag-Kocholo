        "text": "May 26, 2022\n\nCENAO-WRR\n\nNAO-2018-02169\n\nFEDERAL PUBLIC NOTICE\n\nThe District Commander received a joint application for Federal and State permits as described below:\n\nAPPLICANT\n\nMr. Corey Cotman\n\n7701 Bradbury Road\n\nHenrico, VA 23231\n\nWATERWAY AND LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED WORK: The project is located in non-tidal headwater wetlands of Fourmile Creek a tributary of the James River, at 7566 Strath Road, in Henrico County, Virginia. A vicinity map is attached.\n\nPROPOSED PROJECT: The applicant proposes to construct a seven-lot single-family subdivision, roads and stormwater management facility.\n\nPROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED: The applicant’s stated purpose is to provide housing in the growing community of Henrico County.\n\nAUTHORITY: Permits for the work in waters and wetlands are required pursuant to Sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act (Public Law 95-217). The Corps must comply with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (54 U.S.C. § 306108), 36 CFR Part 800, regulations implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C, Processing of Department of the Army Permits.\n\nPURPOSE OF PUBLIC NOTICE: In compliance with regulations implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Norfolk District is soliciting comments on the proposed project from the public; Federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Native American Tribes; and other interested parties. This public notice provides an opportunity for members of the public to express their views on the undertaking’s effects on historic properties and resolution of adverse effects. Comments are requested to assist in evaluation of the effects of the project on historic properties and evaluation of alternatives or modifications which could avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties.\n\nHISTORIC PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION: The Norfolk District, Regulatory Branch identified historic properties within the USACE permit area. A cultural resources survey was conducted on the project site and a report prepared: “Stallman Ridge, 7566 Strath Road, Henrico County, Virginia, DHR #2021-3829, Phase I Intensive Cultural Resources Survey”, dated 2021, by Browning and Associates, Ltd. The cultural resources survey and report are a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties. The project site is located within the potential National Register boundary of the Darbytown & New Market Roads Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5071), the Darbytown Road Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5072), and the Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5073).\n\nADVERSE EFFECT DETERMINATION: In consultation with the SHPO, and in consideration of views concerning effects provided by consulting parties, the USACE applied the criteria of adverse effect to historic properties within the permit area. The USACE determines that the proposed federal action would result in an adverse effect on the Darbytown & New Market Roads Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5071), the Darbytown Road Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5072), and the Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road Battlefield (DHR ID#043-5073). The USACE is consulting further to develop and evaluate alternatives or modifications to the undertaking that could avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties. The US Army Corps of Engineers (Norfolk District), Virginia Department of Historic Resources, the permittee and other consulting parties are proposing to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.\n\nCOMMENT PERIOD: Comments on this project should be in writing and can be sent by either email to julie.s.hamilton@usace.army.mil, or by regular mail, addressed to the Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers (ATTN: CENAO-WRR), 803 Front Street, Norfolk, Virginia 23510-1011, and should be received by the close of business on June 25, 2022.\n\nPRIVACY & CONFIDENTIALITY: Comments and information, including the identity of the submitter, submitted in response to this Public Notice may be disclosed, reproduced, and distributed at the discretion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
