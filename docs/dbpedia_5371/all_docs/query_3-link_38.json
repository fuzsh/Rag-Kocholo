        "text": "Norfolk Marine Park no-take areas\n\nEmily and Slaughter Bay - complete no-take area\n\nCemetery Bay - no-take of any echinoderm species.\n\nDue to the ongoing issue of storm and groundwater pollution entering the lagoon at Emily and Slaughter Bay, and the important role of herbivorous fish and echinoderms in controlling algal growth, a complete no-take area has been established in this area, in support of local custom.\n\nIn recognition of the role that Cemetery Bay plays as a source of echinoderms to the lagoon, Cemetery Bay will be a no-take area for these species.\n\nFrom 15 February 2023, until further notice, Emily and Slaughter Bays will be a complete no-take area. Cemetery Bay will be a no-take area for echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea urchins, starfish, brittle stars, sand dollars and crinoids). Fishing for kingfish and other finfish species is still allowed at Cemetery Bay.\n\nThe determination can be found on the Federal Register of Legislation.\n\nAbout\n\nRich in history, Norfolk Marine Park, surrounding Norfolk Island, supports diverse temperate and tropical marine life.\n\nRunning through the marine park is the Norfolk Ridge, a long, narrow, steep-sided undersea ridge with seamounts and pinnacles.\n\nIt acts as a line of oceanic stepping stones, connecting deep water marine species from New Zealand to New Caledonia.\n\nNorfolk Island and the marine park offer unique nature-watching experiences for visitors, and are well worth the journey.\n\nThe marine park contains the wreck of the HMS Sirius, one of the First Fleet flagships. It foundered in 1790.\n\nThe marine park begins 1400 kilometres offshore, east of Evans Head in New South Wales. It covers 188,444 square kilometres, with depths from the high tide mark to 5000 metres.\n\nIt has National Park and Multiple Use zones, as well as a Special Purpose Zone immediately around the island itself. This Special Purpose Zone allows both conservation and sustainable use in an area highly valued by the Norfolk community.\n\nExplore\n\nExplore a coral reef lagoon in a glass-bottom boat. There are astonishingly colourful fishes, corals and other marine life to enjoy.\n\nOr, grab your binoculars and look out for foraging seabirds, including white terns and red-tailed tropicbirds, and humpback whales when on their migration.\n\nFind out more about visiting Norfolk Island National Park, managed by Parks Australia, or visit Norfolk Island tourism.\n\nDiscover\n\nThe marine park contains over 20 known shipwrecks listed under the Historic Shipwrecks Act.\n\nThe most famous is HMS Sirius, a flagship of the First Fleet.\n\nHMS Sirius was wrecked on the coral reef off Slaughter Bay, Norfolk Island in 1790.\n\nRegional protection\n\nBoth New Caledonia and New Zealand have marine protected areas that adjoin Norfolk Marine Park - this extends the protection for the seamounts along the Norfolk Ridge.\n\nMap of marine protected areas (PDF)\n\nPublications"
