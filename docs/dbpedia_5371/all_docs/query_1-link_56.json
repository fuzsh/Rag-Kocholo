However, it tends to quickly become second nature.\n\nTo best utilize your wallet, we recommend placing your most used cards on the outside of your card stack and closest to the inner plates of the wallet for easy access.\n\nHowever, when it comes to getting the cards on the inside, we recommend using the fan method, which is similar to when you fan out playing cards.\n\nHere are the fan method steps:\n\n1. Push your cards up through the thumb hole at the bottom of the wallet.\n\n2. Pull your cards out a little more so that the edge of your cards are sticking out in the middle of the elastic.\n\n3. Hold the card closest to you with your thumb, and fan out the rest of the cards with your index finger while holding the back card with the rest of your fingers for stability.\n\nPrefer video tutorials?

The plastic chip is small and flat with an electronic tag and embedded antenna that can transmit information to an RFID reader. A tag can be read from up to several feet away and does not need to be within direct line-of-sight of the reader to be tracked.\n\nRFID-blocking technology disrupts the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the card reader so that no one can access the information without your permission. Remember, it’s not just your money they can steal, but also your personal details, including full names and addresses.\n\nRFID-blocking wallets are made from thin, durable metal, such as carbon fiber and aluminum. These special materials prevent unwanted radio frequencies from penetrating the card case and activating the RFID tag on your credit, debit, or ID cards\n\nAll of our wallets block RFID with the two aluminum inner plates.\n\nWant to learn more? Feel free to check out our blog post about RFID blocking!\n\nWas this article helpful? 11 0\n\nWhile we do not sell any wallets this way, you are able to configure your wallet with both the Cash Strap and Money Clip installed.\n\nYou can either purchase a Wallet with both included in the package, or you can purchase a Cash Strap wallet and also the replacement Money Clip. Then you will be able to simply add on the Money Clip to the front side of the wallet.\n\nWas this article helpful? 18 1\n\nCarbon Fiber is made in sheets and then filled with resin. Forged Composite uses a paste of fibers (500,000 fibers per square inch) mixed with a resin that is squeezed out to make almost any shape. Since the fibers aren't oriented in any particular direction, the finished part is strong all around, while remaining light. Our Forged Carbon, Forged Ember, Forged Gold and Forged Pacific wallets have the same weight and strength as the Carbon Fiber model just with a different visual appearance.\n\nWas this article helpful? 9 0\n\nYes!

Here you will find a few different ways to go about finding the perfect fit, these include:\n\nString or floss method:\n\nYou can get to the correct ring size using a simple piece of string or dental floss. Here’s what you need to do:\n\nWrap the measuring tool (string or floss) around the base of your finger.\n\nTake your pen or marker and mark the place where the string overlaps.\n\nConvert the measurement to a ring size.\n\nOur printable ring sizer chart:\n\nUsing the chart to get accurate measurements is relatively easy. Essentially, you’ll need to perform only two steps:\n\nuse the chart to measure your existing ring (if available).\n\nMeasure the ring finger using the chart.\n\nYou should place the ring on the chart so that its inner edge matches with a particular circle on the chart. This will give you the inner circumference of the existing ring, which will be an excellent point for orientation moving forward.\n\nWrap the strip of paper with the chart around your finger. Find where the strip overlaps and mark the precise point.\n\nRing sizer tool:\n\nRing sizing tools are relatively simple to use and come in plastic and metal variants. These tools are essentially special strips that you can wrap around your finger to get precise measurements. A sizer does pretty much the same thing as the described homemade methods. However, as a professional tool, it’s much more reliable than paper or floss.\n\nYou can go to your local jeweler and ask them to use their sizer. Or, if you want to have the tool available at your home, you can find ring sizers available for purchase online.\n\nWas this article helpful? 1 1\n\nWide vs. narrow bands\n\nPerhaps it doesn’t sound obvious, but different band widths may call for different sizes. A narrow band will fit nicely at the point where you measured your finger. However, a wide band might be just right for that point but too tight a few millimeters away.\n\nTo ensure you have the right size for a wide band, measure where on your finger the band should start and end. Then, use the described methods to get exact dimensions at the highest and lowest points on your finger. If the measurements differ, go with the larger one.\n\nTemperature and finger size fluctuations\n\nInterestingly enough, your finger size isn’t always the same. We’ve already brought up finger swelling, and that’s because this phenomenon can happen at any time. The temperature has a particularly strong impact here.\n\nYou should account for finger size fluctuations when choosing the ring size. Besides taking care of this aspect when measuring, think about whether your fingers tend to swell often. If so, it might be a good idea to get a slightly larger ring.\n\nInternational ring size conversion\n\nIf you’re shopping for rings internationally, you should know that not all countries have the same sizing convention for rings. A particular U.S. ring size might be completely different across both the Atlantic and the Pacific.\n\nFortunately, there’s a handy conversion chart that you can use to “translate” one ring size to another. Consult this official international chart to convert ring sizes easily.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nMeasuring multiple times\n\nAlthough a single measurement might seem sufficient, it would be best to repeat it several times. The point here is to get consistent results across all measurements, so you can be sure the dimensions are absolutely right.\n\nMeasuring at different times of the day\n\nSince finger size can fluctuate, measuring in the morning, afternoon, and evening will be the optimal way to get reliable results. Measure several times a day, especially when the temperature is at its highest and lowest points.\n\nAccounting for knuckle size\n\nWhile you’ll measure the actual area of your finger where the ring will be, you’ll do well to take knuckle size into consideration. After all, what good is a beautiful Ridge ring that fits perfectly on your finger if you can’t get it past the knuckle?\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nEach of the Ridge Rings is carefully crafted with a dual-layer design; with an outer beveled edge for on-hand style and comfort and an inner convex shape for a comfortable, no-pinch fit.\n\nThe Forged Carbon and Carbon Fiber 3K Weave Rings have an inner Tungsten ring with a Carbon Fiber outer finish.\n\nThe Burnt Titanium and Stonewashed Titanium Rings have an outer Titanium Ring with an Inner Titanium Ring designed for comfort.\n\nThe 24K Gold, Royal Black, Alpine Navy, and Gunmetal Rings have an inner Tungsten ring for comfort with an outer Tungsten Ring with the color coating for style.\n\nWas this article helpful? 3 1\n\nUnfortunately, no.

To maintain the integrity of the material, steer clear of harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.\n\nTo ensure your Ridge silicone band stands the test of time, avoid exposure to extreme temperatures or extended periods of sunlight, as these factors may lead to discoloration or warping. Also, avoid wearing your band during activities that involve heavy impact or that come into contact with sharp objects.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nOur silicone wedding rings boast a multitude of benefits when compared to traditional mens rings. A standout feature is their safety aspect; silicone bands are non-conductive, ensuring they won’t carry electricity like metal rings can. This safety feature makes them a top choice for professionals in industries where electrical hazards are a concern.\n\nAdditionally, Ridge bands offer remarkable resistance to scratches and dents, exceeding what metal alternatives can provide. With a variety of colors and designs currently on the market, silicone rings allow you to showcase your unique style while representing your lifelong commitment.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nWhile we do not sell any wallets this way, you can achieve this by ordering a Money Clip wallet and removing the clip.\n\nThis can be done by loosening the screws around the clip, sliding it out, and then re-tightening the screws to reconnect the Inner and Outer Plates.\n\nIf you already have a Cash Strap wallet, you can purchase a Money Clip Elastic, switch the Elastics out and you're all set!\n\nWas this article helpful? 2 0\n\nBefore attaching the AirTag® Money Clip to your Ridge wallet, install the Apple AirTag® in the Money Clip.\n\nUse the provided T5 Torx driver to remove all 4 screws from the back of the Clip and remove the back plate.\n\nInsert the AirTag® into the Money Clip with the Apple Logo facing you.\n\nReplace the backside of the clip and all 4 screws. Ensuring all screws are securely tightened.\n\nAttach the AirTag® Money Clip to your Wallet.\n\nOur wallets are constructed with Inner Plates and Outer Plates.

There is no need to unscrew anything other than this.\n\nStep 2: Inserting - Hold the tension plate down with your thumb and place the keys on the dowel. The keys should lay perpendicular to the plate in an L shape. The Keycase will secure 2-6 keys.\n\nStep 3: Securing - Place the top plate back to align with the dowel. Insert the screw back through the plate into the dowel. Tighten in place, you should not need to apply too much pressure. You will feel clicks as the locking mechanism falls in and out of place and the screw gradually tightens and secure the plate and keys. Do not over-tighten.\n\nWas this article helpful? 2 1\n\nSome customers have expressed difficulties getting the KeyCase to reassemble after taking the clip off.

We do not recommend placing it in the dishwasher as this could cause exterior damage and discoloration. The lid is top-rack dishwasher safe.\n\nSoak your bottle or tumbler in warm, soapy water for 10 minutes (soaking for long periods of time could cause damage to your bottle). Then, clean all parts of your product and lid thoroughly. After washing, rinse and set aside to air dry, storing your bottle and tumbler separately from its lid.\n\nIn need of a deep clean? Mix 1 part cleaning vinegar, 1 part water, and 1 Tbsp. baking soda inside your bottle. Let that sit overnight. The next day, pour out ¾ of the mixture and add another 1 Tbsp. of baking soda.

This is crucial for softening the hair.\n\nAlways use shaving cream!\n\n3-Pass Shave\n\nIt's highly recommended to shave with three full passes when using a OneBlade razor.\n\nBegin by lathering your whole shaving area with your shaving cream or shave soap of choice.\n\nOn your first pass, make long, slightly overlapping strokes with the grain.\n\nRe-lather, then on the second pass, make shorter, overlapping strokes going across the grain.\n\nRe-lather as needed, then on your third pass, go against the grain if necessary.\n\nWe recommend watching OneBlade’s tutorial, which can be found here.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nThe Ridge Razor by OneBlade is covered by a lifetime warranty!\n\nRidge warrants that the Ridge Razor by OneBlade is free from manufacturing defects and is functional as intended for the life of the product.\n\nPlease note that this warranty does not cover lost, stolen, or disposed of Bottles; cosmetic damage; damage caused by accident, abuse, neglect, shock, improper use or storage of the product; or unauthorized modifications or repairs.\n\nIf you need to submit a Warranty Claim, please do that here.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nWe recommend using pliers to gently grip the blade, lift it up, and pull it firmly backward. This should remove the blade without any damage to the razor. Just be careful not to lift up with too much force.\n\nThis may be caused by shaving cream, whiskers, or minerals in tap water building up inside the razor head over time, leading to a lodged blade. If this is the case, cleaning the razor thoroughly is a good idea.\n\nInstructions for cleaning your OneBlade Razor can be found here.\n\nWas this article helpful? 0 0\n\nOur goal in designing the Ridge Check-In was to create a bag that is minimalist yet substantial, thoughtful but not overbuilt.

The Strengthening Tray can be attached to any phone case as it features adhesive backing.
