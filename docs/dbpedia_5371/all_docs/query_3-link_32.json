The view across the valley to the bay is wonderful and the location is perfect.\n\nPatrick\n\nThank you for sharing this beautiful location with us.\n\nIt was a delight to open the curtains each morning and see the lush pastures, the majestic pine forest and the sparkling ocean at Cascade Bay.\n\nThe cottage was welcoming and comfortable. We had everything we needed to make home-cooked meals when we just wanted to be at home together.\n\nWe hope to return again soon.\n\nPhilip & Amanda\n\nA wonderful, quaint place to sit and enjoy the Island. The views from the room was scenic and tranquil. It is only a few minutes drive from town but feels a world away. The unit has soul, a bit quirky but so comfortable with a well supplied kitchen, and relaxing lounge chairs and bed. The wifi was a bonus that worked well. Sitting out on the private back verandah in the sun having breakfast looking at the view was the best way to start the day.\n\nCarla\n\nSylvia and I had the most relaxed and wonderful 12 days on Norfolk Island staying amongst the scenic views and tranquility of 'The Ridge'.\n\nWe would like to thank you both for being so warm, welcoming and helpful, and for making our stay with you one of our most memorable holidays we've had.\n\nDavid & Sylvia.\n\nWe recently spent 5 glorious days on Norfolk Island, staying at The Ridge.\n\nWe were amazed by the views across the valleys to the ocean, the lovely accommodation with all facilities and the ever helpful and friendly Teneille and Phillip. They have thought of everything - down to a spare mobile phone if required. Need a hire car - sorted. Recommendation for a good restaurant - done.\n\nThanks for making our stay so enjoyable.\n\nUwe."
