        "text": "Australian External Territories, group of non-self-governing dependencies of Australia; apart from claims in Antarctica, the external territories of the Commonwealth of Australia are made up entirely of islands and cover an area almost as large as Australia itself. They consist of innumerable small reefs, cays, and atolls between the Great Barrier Reef of Queensland and longitude 157°10′ E, and several remote and diverse islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans. These latter oceanic outposts represent the tips of submerged mountain ranges, many of volcanic origin. Those in the tropics often support fringing coral reefs, or atolls. Each of the Australian external territories was considered uninhabited when it was first annexed by Great Britain.\n\nThe Australian External Territories consist of the Australian Antarctic Territory, comprising all claimed islands and territories other than Adélie Land situated south of latitude 60° S between longitude 45° and 160° E (however, all Antarctic claims are in abeyance as per the Antarctic Treaty and are not recognized by most countries); Christmas Island, once a source of high-grade phosphate; the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, consisting of 27 islands in two atolls; Norfolk Island, noted for its indigenous pine (species Araucaria excelsa); Heard Island and McDonald Islands, transferred from Britain to Australia in 1947; the Ashmore and Cartier Islands in the Indian Ocean; and the Coral Sea Islands, scattered over 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 square km). Only Christmas, Norfolk, and the Cocos Islands have permanent inhabitants. (The now-independent countries of Nauru and Papua New Guinea also were once part of the Australian External Territories.)"
