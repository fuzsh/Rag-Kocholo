        "text": "This newly constructed home takes into consideration the unique characteristics of the location – it's situated on the periphery of the sand dunes that are an integral component of the conserved coastal area in Norfolk. Stuart Everatt of Cowper Griffith Architects tells us about the project.\n\nwww.cowpergriffith.co.uk\n\nDoor details:\n\nArchitect: Cowper Griffith Architects\n\nContractor: Robson Construction\n\nStructural Engineers: Cambridge Architectural Research\n\nLighting Design: Workplane Lightplanning\n\nDoor: Ridge in iroko\n\nJoinery: C.M Whitby\n\nMetalwork: Arc Fabrications\n\nCross Laminated Timber Structure: Eurban\n\nStained Glass: Leading Lights of London\n\nTimber floor: – Bowsprit – the new and reclaimed flooring company\n\nTimber cladding: finger-jointed sweet chestnut boards\n\nBricks: Vande mortal Bricks - Linea 6012\n\nUF: Why did you choose an oiled finish for the Iroko front door?\n\nSE: The luxurious oiled Iroko finish of the door was deliberately chosen to contrast with the muted, softer tones of the flint and sweet chestnut. The external architectural forms of the building were designed to be simple and legible in two wedge shapes: the larger element clad in sweet chestnut vertical boarding which will weather to a dark silver grey over time; and the smaller form was clad in locally sourced dark grey knapped flint. We wanted the front door to be a statement feature, which stood out from the rest of the building in its colour and texture.\n\nUF: What inspired the brick wall in the hallway?\n\nSE: Internally, the feature brick wall was designed as a visual link between the first floor living room and hallway below, as a way of creating continuity between spaces that are physically separated. The bricks were laid with recessed mortar joints to create interesting shadow patterns in the sunlight, and the strong horizontal lines of the brickwork reinforce the horizontal pattern of movement through the building. The hallway was designed to be a darker, more compact area, which tempers the sense of arrival and compels you to venture up to the bright, spacious first floor living room with its large expansive glazing and views to the coastline.\n\nUF: Any details you can share about the storage and bench. We particularly like the little window above the bench which seems quite architectural.\n\nSE: The storage and bench are a piece of bespoke birch-faced plywood joinery designed by Cowper Griffith Architects and fabricated by C.M Whitby in Norfolk. They were designed to be simple, restrained and robust, to fit in with the ethos of the hallway design. The window cill sits flush with the top of the bench and was designed to provide background light while its thin proportion and position allow a sense of privacy from the road. The window is deliberately positioned to frame distant views of the local church tower.\n\nUF: Any particular reason for choosing the floor – was it the client’s choice or yours?\n\nSE: The hallway flooring is a wide engineered oak board, which runs parallel to the brickwork. A lot of thought went into the specification of the flooring and it was agreed that a washed oak would provide a sense of softness to contrast with the harder brickwork of the feature wall. The same oak boards can be found throughout the house as it was important that the contrast between downstairs and upstairs wasn’t too harsh and that the warmth and lightness of materials from the first-floor trickles down into the hallway."
