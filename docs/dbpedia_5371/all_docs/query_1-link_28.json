Given the multitude of approaches to community construction and the diverse nature of communities themselves, it's clear that brand communities are invaluable. Here are three industry sectors primed to cultivate their own vibrant communities... #communitybuilding\n\nDoes being a good neighbour mean doing different things for different people, in different built environments? It does, and if we intend to create prosocial cities for Canada's future, we have some work to do to understand and support better neighbouring. This article presents focus group research with community housing residents in Metro Vancouver.\n\nEffective property management involves more than just maintaining buildings and collecting the rent. It‚Äôs about fostering community, nurturing relationships, and providing exceptional service to both landlords and tenants. When tenants feel respected by their property manager and landlord, they are more likely to rent the property for longer which is a win-win situation for everyone. üôå #community #propertymanagement #tenantrelations #happytenants\n\nOur CEO, Maya Kambeitz, shares a feature in this issue of PIVOT magazine in a timely conversation around the current \"housing conundrum\" here in Canada. The article offers a perspective on how we got here - and how we can get out again. As Maya eloquently puts it \"We've prioritized community housing in this country before and we can do it again.\" Give the article read and let us know your thoughts in the comments!\n\n\"If you build it they will come\" - but it needs to be the right thing, in the right place: good insight in this article from Shahi Islam showing the importance of placemaking to the housebuilding agenda. Building housing is only part of the challenge, and placemaking is a key consideration - housing needs to be relevant and appropriate, and it must deliver what communities need, now and into the future. That means a creative approach to design and use, and utilisation of the range of tenures and housing types available to use - affordable, BtR and open market. Done well, housebuilding and building houses can deliver value and values; let's see plenty of purpose and creative placemaking please - Barry McKeown Ben Pariser. #livingsector #affordablehousing #btr #placemaking\n\nAre you planning your move to Belcourt Seven Oaks?
