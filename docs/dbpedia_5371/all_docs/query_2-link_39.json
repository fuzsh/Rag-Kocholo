        "text": "I’ve just spent another blissful two weeks on Norfolk Island, my fifth visit in the past two years. Having explored most of its charms (plus neighbouring Phillip Island) on previous visits, this time it was all about relaxing at a time of year when the days are long, the weather is delightful, and the island’s coral beach, Emily Bay (seen above) is packed with locals and tourists enjoying its charms.\n\nThe Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) is a native species, and the most common tree on the island. It is not a true pine but a species of conifer. These spectacular trees attracted James Cook when he arrived in 1774, thinking they would make a good source for ships’ masts. However the British settlement that followed him found it was not resilient leaving Britain to rely on Russia and the Baltic states for supply in the remainder of the era of sail.\n\nNorfolk Island rose three million years ago from a submarine ridge linking New Caledonia with New Zealand and was originally much larger. Pounding waves steadily eroded the landscape carving out basalt sea stacks, creating a safe place for seabirds beyond land predators. This photo was taken from Captain Cook lookout, near where Cook landed on the island’s north coast. Five of the northern islands have been named: Moo-oo (not shown, named for the cyperus lucidus moo-oo grass that grows there), Green Pool (named for its permanent water supply), Cathedral Rock, Elephant Rock and Bird Rock.\n\nBird Rock viewpoint (with Elephant Rock in the foreground) is a vigorous 2km up and down walk from Captain Cook along the Bridle Track with great sea views along the way, the largest Norfolk Island pines on the island, and plenty of bird life. Bird Rock is home to hundreds of birds such as wedge-tailed shearwaters (night fliers known as ghost birds for their moaning calls), masked boobies, red-tailed tropicbirds, sooty terns and black noddies. Bird Rock is the only place on Norfolk where the Christinus guentheri gecko survives. Better known as the Lord Howe island gecko where it also survives (as well as Phillip Island) it is considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nA blissful spot on the east coast is One Hundred Acres Reserve. It is not part of the national park but grazing stock have been excluded from the reserve for 140 years and it remains free of woody weeds spread by cattle like cherry guava. The reserve is the primary breeding place for black noddies. Shearwater muttonbirds also nest in exposed cliff top locations.\n\nThe black noddy also known as the white-capped noddy (Anous minutus) is a seabird from the family Laridae. They were called noddies because of the behaviour of both sexes who constantly dip their heads during their breeding display. They are tolerant of humans to the extent that they can be picked up off the nest. The genus name Anous is ancient Greek for “stupid” or “foolish” (analogous to the “booby” – Spanish for stupid – as both birds are easy to capture).\n\nEach day we walked from Emily Bay to the Flagstaff on top of the hill. There are 200 steps up the 60m hill with a view of Kingston’s harbour from the top. Arthur Phillip’s instructions for the First Fleet settlement of New South Wales included a directive that Norfolk Island was to be settled and secured as soon as possible after landing at Botany Bay. HMS Supply, with Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, settlers, and convicts, arrived at Kingston on March 2, 1788. The site had fresh water and low, flat ground as well as relatively safe anchorage.\n\nThe colonists cleared the thick undergrowth near the shore and built shelters and storehouses in the months after landing. By end 1788, Sydney Bay, as King called it before it was renamed for him, consisted of thatched and weatherboard buildings on either side of a clearing that ran from the foot of Mount George (Flagstaff Hill) to the sea. They cleared areas around the town and in Arthur’s Vale at the head of the swamp, for crops and livestock. In 1789 they cut channels to drain the swamp behind the settlement allowing better access to the interior and providing ground for cultivation.\n\nOn March 19, 1790 First Fleet flagship HMS Sirius was wrecked on the reef (marked by a plaque above) while attempting to anchor off Kingston. Its crew and passengers remained on the island while King left the settlement on HMS Supply leaving Major Ross of the Royal Marines in command to proclaim martial law. Starving settlers survived on sparse rations and by eating ground nesting birds and their eggs. They gratefully named the bird the Providence Petrel.\n\nOn King’s return in 1791 they built a jail and began burning lime to make mortar and plastic. King built a more permanent Government House fortified with a palisade fence. However it was abandoned after the first settlement ended in 1814. In 1824 the British reopened the island as a peniteniary for the worst of the worst, ”the doubly damned.” The current government house was built on the same site a year later.\n\nA convict uprising in 1826 resulted in four deaths and the later execution of two convicts in Sydney. After a series of murders in 1833, authorities decided accused prisoners should be tried on Norfolk Island and three prisoners were executed. Hard labour included work in gangs and in the Crankmill and quarries. An official report described convicts working from dawn to dusk in building and agriculture. Another mutiny took place in January 1834. Nine convicts died while 13 more were found guilty and executed. Major Joseph Anderson’s arrival in 1834 heralded considerable changes. Much of Kingston’s appearance today is due to Anderson’s tenure. He directed the construction of the Commissariat Store, the New Military Barracks and in 1836 commenced work on a New Gaol based on the radiating-wing principle, five wings all visible to the centre.\n\nIn 1856 the island was handed over to the Pitcairn Islanders after the penal colony was closed. The Pitcairners were the descendants of the mutineers of HMS Bounty and Tahitian women. Mutiny leader Fletcher Christian and most of the mutineers were murdered on Pitcairn, but their descendents survived. The community remained isolated until 1808 when it was visited by American whalers. By the mid 1800s the community were devout Christians and had outgrown the island. As part of the settlement process 20 hectares of land away from Kingston were allotted to each household.\n\nIn the early days the Pitcairners lived in the former officers’ houses at Military Row (now Quality Row). Number 11 Quality Row was the first to be built in the 1840s. Originally intended to be the Protestant clergyman’s home, it eventually became the Catholic priest’s home. The building is an outstanding example of Georgian architecture. It now houses Norfolk Island Regional Council administration, archives and meeting rooms. The annex contains change rooms for the adjacent sports field.\n\nBird life on Norfolk is always enchanting. This is one of a family of white-faced herons that live near the golf course end of the bay. Herons are known as “harnsers” in the English Norfolk but these ones are Egretta novaehollandiae which as the name suggests are from “New Holland” (Australia). The white-faced heron is highly flexible and uses a wide variety of habitats featuring shallow water. It has been increasing its range in Australia and is now the most abundant heron in New Zealand. It was first reported there in 1868, first reported as a breeding species in 1941, and has increased expansively since the 1960s, now found throughout both islands.\n\nThe island’s emblematic bird is the green parrot or Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii). This endangered species used to live across Norfolk before humans arrived in the 1780s but after extensive clearing of trees and introduction of feral predators, fewer than 50 individuals remained by the 1970s. While land clearing ceased, competition for suitable nesting sites is fierce with introduced species such as rosellas and common starlings, and predation from rats and cats remains a threat. In recent years, the population has responded well to recovery activities, now expanding beyond the borders of the Norfolk Island National Park on the northern side of the island.\n\nThe national park is home to Norfolk’s Second World War heritage. The island was an important airbase and refuelling station for service personnel between Australia, New Zealand and the Solomons. The island was considered strategically important due to the cable station which linked Australia and New Zealand. A small New Zealand unit of infantry and artillery called N Force garrisoned the island between October 1942 and February 1944. At its peak N Force consisted of 1488 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. Barry (no relation). The island proved too far from the theatre of war and was abandoned leaving behind a few relics from the radar station.\n\nA modern addition to the national park is this CSIRO water measuring equipment. Though the island gets good rainfall, drought is not unknown. The Norfolk Island water resources assessment project looks to improve water security. The equipment traps additional water for exposed forest sites by intercepting water droplets from passing clouds in a process known as cloud interception. Norfolk Island will need more innovative solutions to deal with 21st century problems of climate change."
