        "text": "Went on a weeknight at 6pm. Busy, but not overwhelming. Restaurant was clean. Food cooked quickly and was very hot and fresh. The hot chicken sando was HUGE and incredible. I honestly like it better than Hot Chick downtown, and the entire combo costs $1 less than Hot Chick’s sandwich alone. Two people could eat this sandwich. My husband had soy Korean nuggets, and there were so many he couldn’t finish them. Portions very generous. Highly recommend & hope they open more — we drove 40 minutes each way to visit!\n\nVery very good! I’ve been trying all the chicken places in the area and this is the best by far, the chicken is huge, slaw and special sauce was seasoned perfect! I got medium heat but it honestly didn’t taste hot, so not sure if spice was left off or not. I got the loaded french fries, fries are under the chicken and everything else. They were super busy but still provided excellent customer service, can’t wait for Herndon location to open, it’s closer. Highly recommend.\n\nThe chicken sandwhich and waffle fries were amazing. The chicken breast was massive, the meat was tender, and the breading was and crispy even once I took it home. Medium spicy level was not too hot at all. The waffle fries have a really nice seasoning on them, and the sauce they give you to dip in is great. Went back the next day and got chicken and waffles. It was incredible.\n\nCame here today after learning about it on Instagram. I’ve enjoyed the other chicken spots in the area, and since this is close to my house, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI ordered the sando combo, medium spice. The lady who took my order was super nice and brought me the food outside where I was sitting. The combo came with waffle fries and a soda. The fries were seasoned well and were crispy. The sauce that came with them for dipping was fantastic! Not quite sure what it was, but the sauce went very well with the fries.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was AWESOME. It was hot (temperature) and has a great crunch to it. I think the bun was brioche and was excellent. Somebody said the medium temp was sightly hotter than Popeye’s chicken sandwich, and I would agree with that. The slaw was very good and complimented the chicken very well. I can’t wait to go back. Highly recommended!\n\nFinally Chicken meets flavor in Northern Virginia, had heard rave reviews about hangry joes, and once you eat there you will understand what the hype is all about, i had the nashville chicken sandwich with colesaw and pickles on the side, you have to select the spice level and i had opted for the medium one, which is very hot, but the chicken was moist, flavourful and very yummy, the size of the sandwich is very big but ample chicken portions and the service in this location is extraordinary, the lady in front is very courteous and friendly. I would certainly go back again.\n\nProbably the BEST chicken sandwich I have ever had! The chicken had a crispy outside, and a very juicy inside. Portion size of the chicken breast was perfect. I ordered the Hot spicy level, which initially seemed not very spicy, but built up to a nice consistent heat. They have 4 spice levels, Hot is number 3 with Angry Hot number 4 (waiver required). The coleslaw and pickle on the sandwich worked well, and had a great flavor. Recommend this chicken sandwich if you are in search of a tasty Nashville chicken sandwich."
