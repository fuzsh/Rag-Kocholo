Each Dunkin' franchisee is an independent employer and thus solely responsible for hiring decisions and all other employment-related matters for the franchisee’s restaurant(s). The terms “Company,” “Dunkin',” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to the specific entity (corporate or franchise) that owns and operates the Dunkin' restaurant to which you are applying. Nothing on this site should be construed as Dunkin' being involved in or having control over a franchise employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Any employment-related questions regarding a franchise restaurant should be directed to the franchisee.\n\nDunkin' and its franchisees are equal opportunity employers."
