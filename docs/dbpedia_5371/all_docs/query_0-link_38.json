        "text": "Imagine a lush, beautiful island with sandy beaches, jagged cliffs and tall pine trees filled with a local community that enjoys a simple, laid back way of life. Sound like paradise? Welcome to Norfolk Island.\n\nAn external Australian territory in the Pacific Ocean located northeast of Sydney, it’s one of Australia's most isolated communities and one of its oldest territories, having been settled six weeks after Australia's founding settlement in New South Wales. With a diverse environment, this island is of major biological importance with many native species only found here. Lying on a 100 kilometer ( mile) long plateau on the Norfolk Ridge that runs all the way from New Zealand to New Caledonia, the waters surrounding Norfolk Island – warm waters to the north and cooler waters coming up from the south – are perfect for seeing sharks at various times of the year. These include the galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis), also referred to as ‘bronze whalers’ here, silky sharks (C. falciformis), oceanic white tips (C.longimanus), blue sharks (Prionace glauca), and many more. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are also spotted frequently by fishers and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) are commonly caught by them.\n\nIt’s the tiger sharks that interest Flinders University the most. This year marks the third year of intensive research activity at Norfolk Island led by Flinders University’s Professor Charlie Huveneers, Director of the Marine and Coastal Research Consortium and Research Leader of the Southern Shark Ecology Group. While it started small, the study has now grown into an international multi-university research endeavour, and financial support from grants and donations has enabled this work to flourish. “We first went to Norfolk Island to examine the impact of microplastics on the tiger shark population and expected minimal effects in an untouched part of the Pacific, but we found much more,” says Huveneers in a press release. “We were astonished to find probably the largest aggregation of adult tiger sharks in the world.”\n\nCommon in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout the world, these sharks get their moniker for the bright tiger-like stripes running down the sides of their body that fade with age. The last remaining member of the Galeocerdo genus, they are famous for eating just about anything they find or are able to capture, earning the nickname “trashcans of the sea.” Scientists have seen their global population numbers drop, thanks to targeted and accidental catch in fisheries, making them be listed as “Near Threatened (NT)” on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nBut why are the sharks here? “The island has its own waste disposal problems, including offal from culling old cattle from its extensive livestock population, which might explain the large population of enormous, well-fed sharks, as most of the sharks we’ve tagged are over four meters (13.1 feet) in length,” explains Huveneers. This incredible tiger shark population has provided a wealth of research opportunities, made possible by ongoing funding from the Neiser Foundation and the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, United States. The numerous research trips to the Norfolk Island have allowed Flinders researchers to apply acoustic tags and satellite tags to monitor tiger shark movement, and collect swabs, muscle and blood samples to study the shark’s diet and microbiome. “Our focus on tiger sharks now informs the wider knowledge of sharks, which are highly vulnerable to the impact of people,” says Huveneers.\n\nMore than one-third of all sharks, rays, and chimaeras are now at risk of extinction because of overfishing, according to the latest study that has re-assesed their IUCN Red List of Threatened Species extinction risk status. But even though sharks are in peril due to our actions, many fear sharks for their ability to cause humans harm. Tiger sharks are known as one of the top three shark species to have negative interactions with humans (i.e. bites); the other two are bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great whites. While one would think a large population of sharks would lend to many bites in Norfolk, records that date back to 1892 show that the island has had zero fatal attacks to date. The only alleged incident of an unprovoked ‘attack’ was a laceration to the arm a fisherman received in 1892. This statistic is a mystery to many, although some point the finger to the fierce protections the Islanders have over their waters to make sure the world below the waves stays healthy.\n\nWe have much to learn from the sharks in Norfolk’s waters. Hopefully we have time to do so."
