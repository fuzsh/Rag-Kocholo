        "text": "Introducing Bristol Ridge, Our Newest Ann Arbor Townhome Community\n\nMarch 25, 2021\n\nLiving in Ann Arbor is all about opportunity with a walkable downtown, world-class arts and culture, and more than 150 parks where residents can embrace the outdoors. In fact, Ann Arbor was recently ranked sixth on Niche.com’s list of Best Cities to Live in America list. It also ranked fifth for Best Cities to Raise a Family and second among Cities with the Best Public Schools.\n\nNorfolk Homes offers homebuyers the opportunity to enjoy all the benefits of life in Ann Arbor with the convenient and maintenance free lifestyle at their new Bristol Ridge Townhome community that launches mid-April 2021. Contact Norfolk Homes to join the VIP list. Interested buyers can reserve one of 7 townhomes at pre-construction prices starting Saturday April 10, 2021\n\nLiving in Bristol Ridge\n\nLocated off Pontiac Trail, Bristol Ridge keeps residents within a short drive of downtown Ann Arbor and both University of Michigan campuses with quick access to spacious parks in Northeast Ann Arbor.\n\nBristol Ridge is within walking distance of Olson Park which spans 54 acres with a central pond, dog park, basketball court, rock-climbing playground and trails winding through wetlands and woods. The public Leslie Park Golf Course is situated just south of the community and earned the title of Golf Digest’s No. 1 Municipal Course in Michigan. Outdoor adventurers will also love the Gallup Park and Argo Park Liveries where they can rent canoes and kayaks and ride along the Huron River. A trip from park to park takes 1 1/2 hours and crosses 3,7 scenic miles. The Gallup and Argo Ponds offer calm, stillwater paddling on either side. Paddleboards, paddle boats and tubing are also available at many parks throughout the area.\n\nDowntown Ann Arbor is divided into four distinct commercial districts: Kerrytown, Main Street, South University and State Street. The Main Street District is the heart of the city with unique shopping and dining ranging from small, local establishments to national chains like Warby Parker and Moosejaw. Scattered venues have live music throughout the year and the Ann Arbor Farmers Market is open every Saturday and Wednesday with local meats, produce, and other products. Kerrytown offers eclectic shopping, South University is a vibrant college town neighborhood and State Street is the cultural hub with historic architecture, galleries, and award-winning museums.\n\nA floor plan to fit your needs\n\nBristol Ridge will feature Norfolk Homes’ brand new 2582-2594 square foot Keswick townhome floor plan with three bedrooms, three full bathrooms and a half bath on the main floor.\n\nResidents can enter the Keswick Plan from the attached garage. This main level entry space serves as a mudroom with ample closet space and optional custom built cubbies. Tiled floors are perfect for wet and muddy weather. A flexible recreation room sits behind the garage which can be used as an office, guestroom, man/womancave or secluded home office depending on your needs. The front door opens to the main living area designed for entertaining with an open floor plan that combines the dining room, kitchen and great room as well as a private balcony located off the great room. The second level master suite is private from the second bedroom and full bath. The laundry is housed on the second level. The first building released for sale has fully finished walk-out basements with a full bath. The walk-out basement provides the third bedroom or additional recreation or home office space.\n\nPerfectly situated in Northeast Ann Arbor"
