        "text": "June 6, 2023\n\nCENAO-WRR\n\nNAO-2022-01808 (23-V0724)\n\nFEDERAL PUBLIC NOTICE\n\nThe District Commander has received a joint permit application for Federal and State permits as described below:\n\nAPPLICANT\n\nNP Austin Ridge, LLC\n\n3315 N Oak Trfy\n\nKansas City, MO 64116\n\nPROJECT LOCATION: North of Accokeek Creek, west of I-95, in Stafford County, Virginia.\n\nPROJECT SIZE: Approximately 195 acres\n\nNEAREST WATERWAY: Accokeek Creek\n\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE: 38.417222; -77.434167\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE: The applicant has proposed to construct four warehouse and associated parking, utilities, internal roads, and stormwater management ponds to serve the Washington DC metropolitan area. As proposed, the project would impact 0.17 acre of palustrine open water; 0.74 acre of palustrine emergent wetlands; 0.98 acre of palustrine forested wetlands; and 560 linear feet of stream channel.\n\nAVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION: The applicant has evaluated alternative sites and alternative layouts for the proposed project. These alternatives are discussed in the Joint Permit Application and are under review. The Corps will issue a permit for the proposed project only if all wetland and stream impacts have been avoided and minimized to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nCOMPENSATORY MITIGATION: The applicant has proposed to purchase 2.79 wetland credits and 604 stream credits from a wetland/stream mitigation bank(s) allowed to sell credits within the 02070011 Hydrologic Unit Code.\n\nIn addition, the applicant must obtain an Individual Section 401 Water Quality Certification or waiver from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) assuring that applicable laws and regulations pertaining to water quality are not violated.\n\nA copy of the joint permit application can be found on the Virginia Marine Resources Commission’s website (application).\n\nAUTHORITY:\n\n( ) Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403).\n\n(X) Sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act (Public Law 95-217) and Title 62.1 of the Code of Virginia.\n\n( ) Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1413).\n\nFEDERAL EVALUATION OF APPLICATION: The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. The decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefits which reasonably may be expected from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All of the proposal's relevant factors will be considered, including conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, cultural values, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, flood plain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people. The Environmental Protection Agency's \"Guidelines for Specification of Disposal Sites for Dredged or Fill Material\" will also be applied (Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act).\n\nThe Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Preliminary review of the application indicates that no EIS will be required.\n\nComments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity. Anyone may request a public hearing to consider this permit application by writing to the District Commander within 30 days of the date of this notice, stating specific reasons for holding the public hearing. The District Commander will then decide if a hearing should be held.\n\nENDANGERED SPECIES: After conducting the Norfolk District Endangered Species Act (ESA) Project Review Process, the Corps has made the preliminary determination that:\n\nNo listed/proposed/candidate species and/or designated/proposed critical habitat under the ESA of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544, 87 Stat. 884), as amended, will be affected. Based on this “no effect” determination, no further coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required.\n\nThere may be an effect to listed/proposed/candidate species and/or designated/proposed critical habitat under the ESA of 1973. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Information and Planning and Consultation (IPaC) Official Species List and Species Conclusion Table are attached for review and comment by the FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).\n\nAdditional information might change any of these findings.\n\nHISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES:\n\nHistoric Resources eligible for inclusion or included in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are in or near the Corps permit area or would likely be affected by the proposal.\n\nAdditional information may change any of these findings.\n\nESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT: The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-267), requires all Federal agencies to consult with the NMFS on all actions, or proposed actions, permitted, funded, or undertaken by the agency, that may adversely affect Essential Fish Habitat (EFH).\n\nThere is no EFH in the Corps area of responsibility.\n\nVIRGINIA’S COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM: For compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended for projects located in Virginia’s Coastal Zone, the applicant must certify that federally licensed or permitted activities affecting Virginia's coastal uses or resources will be conducted in a manner consistent with the Virginia’s Coastal Zone Management Program (Virginia CZM Program), and obtain concurrence from the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Office of Environmental Impact Review (OEIR). It is the applicant’s responsibility to submit a consistency certification to the OEIR for concurrence or objection, and proof of concurrence must be submitted to the Corps prior to final permit issuance. A template federal consistency certification can be found in the Federal Consistency Manual here: https://www.deq.virginia.gov/permits-regulations/environmental-impact-review/federal-consistency . For more information or to obtain a list of the enforceable policies of the Virginia CZM Program, contact the DEQ-OEIR at (804) 659-1915 or e-mail: bettina.rayfield@deq.virginia.gov.\n\nThe applicant has not submitted concurrence.\n\nVIRGINIA’S SECTION 401 WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM: The Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 Certification Rule (Certification Rule, 40 CFR 121), effective September 11, 2020, requires certification, or waiver, for any license or permit that authorizes an activity that may result in a discharge. The scope of a CWA Section 401 certification is limited to ensuring that a discharge from a Federally licensed or permitted activity will comply with water quality requirements. To comply with the Virginia Section 401 Water Quality Certification Program and the Certification Rule, the applicant is responsible for adhering to the procedures outlined in the Certification Rule when requesting certification from the certifying authority, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. In accordance with Certification Rule part 121.12, the Corps will notify the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator when it has received a Department of the Army (DA) permit application and the related certification. The Administrator is responsible for determining whether the discharge may affect water quality in a neighboring jurisdiction. The DA permit may not be issued pending the conclusion of the Administrator’s determination of effects on neighboring jurisdictions.\n\nCOMMENT PERIOD: Comments on this project should be in writing and can be sent by either email to Silvia.B.Gazzera@usace.army.mil, or by regular mail, addressed to the Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers (ATTN: CENAO-WRR), 803 Front Street, Norfolk, VA 23510-1011, and should be received by the close of business on July 6, 2023.\n\nPRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY: Comments and information, including the identity of the submitter, submitted in response to this Public Notice may be disclosed, reproduced, and distributed at the discretion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
