On 31 July 2024, the Department will end rolling enrollment for new Industry Partner applications; to be considered under the open enrollment structure, applications must be received no later than 15 July 2024. A revised DOD SkillBridge Industry Partner Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) goes into effect on 15 July 2024 with new criteria for future partnerships.\n\nEffective 1 October 2024 DOD SkillBridge will transition to structured application enrollment periods.\n\nFall Enrollment Period: 1 October â 1 December\n\nSpring Enrollment Period: 1 February â 1 April\n\nExisting industry partners in good standing who have an expired MOU listed on the DOD SkillBridge Authorized Organizations are automatically extended through 30 September 2024; MOU renewals will be processed prior to the 30 September 2024 expiration.\n\nProspective SkillBridge organizations are highly encouraged to attend a bi-weekly DOD SkillBridge New Partner Application Process Information Sessions.
