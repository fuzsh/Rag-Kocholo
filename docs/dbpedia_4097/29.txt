The 9th Army Technical Research Laboratory (第9陸軍技術研究所, Dai kyū Rikugun Gijutsu Kenkyūjo?), also called the Noborito Laboratory (登戸研究所, Noborito Kenkyūjo?), was a military development laboratory run by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 to 1945. The lab, based in Noborito, Tama-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan focused on clandestine activities and unconventional warfare, including energy weapons, intelligence and spycraft tools, chemical and biological weapons, poisons, and currency counterfeiting. One of the weapons developed by the lab was the fire balloon, thousands of which were launched against the United States in 1944 and 1945. The unit, which at its peak was staffed by 1,000 scientists and workers, was disbanded upon Japan's defeat at the end of World War II.

On 7 April 2010, a museum, called the Noborito Institute for Peace Education, was opened at the lab's former site. The museum exhibits artifacts from the lab and gives information on the unit's mission and operations. The museum sits on the Ikuta campus of Meiji University.
