        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1945-46, U.S. officials made similar discoveries in both Germany and Japan, unearthing evidence of unethical experiments on human beings that constituted war crimes. The outcomes in the two defeated nations, however, were strikingly different. In Germany, the U.S. played a key role in bringing Nazi physicians to trial and publicizing their misdeeds. In Japan, the U.S. played an equally key role in concealing biological warfare experiments and securing immunity for the perpetrators. How we are to understand these very different responses?\n\nSheldon Harris, in his authoritative history of the Japanese biological warfare program, argues that during November 1945-March 1948:\n\nThe questions of ethics and morality as they affected scientists in Japan and in the United States never once entered into a single discussion… In all the considerable documentation that has survived…, not one individual is chronicled as having said [biological warfare] human experiments were an abomination and that their perpetrators should be prosecuted. The only concern voiced was that of the possibility of exposure that would cause the United States some embarrassment should word of the bargain ever become public knowledge.1, p. 305\n\nIn alleging that “questions of ethics and morality” were never raised, Harris seems to mean that no questions were answered in ways he agreed with. Much as we sympathize with his moral outrage, his statement is uninformative about the actual reasoning that the U.S. scientists employed as justification.\n\nIt is informative to compare the American response in Japan with the work of one important figure in Germany, Canadian Air Force officer John W. Thompson. Thompson recognized the German experiments as war crimes that set a dangerous precedent for the scientific community, and was uniquely influential in persuading Allied authorities to act.2\n\nWe first briefly summarize the experiments in the two countries, then describe Thompson’s activities in postwar Germany. We next recount the U.S. investigations of Japanese biological warfare experiments. We conclude by comparing the two Allied responses to medical war crimes and propose reasons for the difference."
