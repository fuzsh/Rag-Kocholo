        "text": "BARL Associated Faculty\n\nDirector: Dr. Clark Spencer Larsen\n\nDr. Debra Guatelli-Steinberg\n\nDr. Samuel D. Stout\n\nDr. Mark Hubbe\n\nBARL Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources\n\nThe Bioarchaeology Research Laboratory is a large, shared laboratory space for research programs in bioarchaeology and skeletal biology. The main laboratory space includes a sink with a hazardous waste trap, fume hood, eyewash station, burn cabinet for storage of contain hazardous chemicals, and a whiteboard. The main laboratory space also includes two large central laboratory benches that can seat eight workers each. A long laboratory bench provides workstations for several microscopes and a desktop computer. Cabinets underneath these benches are used to store equipment for sample preparation and microscopy. Six glass cabinets extend above this long counter and provide space for laboratory equipment and microscopic slide storage. Three cubicles with desks each house a dual-screen desktop computer and provide workspace for graduate students and visiting researchers. Beyond the cubicles, floor-to-ceiling metal cabinets provide storage space for research materials. A smaller room is adjacent to the main laboratory space and primarily houses workspace for visiting researchers, students, and faculty personnel. The room houses an extensive dental cast research collection (Renee M. Menegaz-Bock Dental Anthropology Collection). There are three primary office spaces for graduate students, Clark Larsen, and visiting researchers.\n\nComputer Facilities\n\nThe Bioarchaeology Research Laboratory houses five Dell OptiPlex 980 computers with dual-screen monitors, a Windows 10 Enterprise operating system, and a Microsoft Office 2018 suite that are available to anyone working in the laboratory. The laboratory, office, computer lab, and personal computers all have access to the following software programs through The Ohio State University Office of the Chief Information Officer: Adobe Acrobat Professional Version XI, statistical computing software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.), statistical computing software SPSS version 23 64-bit, and spatial analysis software ArcGIS version 10.2, ImageJ (NIH) and FIJI (NIH) and the statistical computing software R x64 3.2.2 (The R Foundation). All departmental computers are connected to a printer.\n\nThe laboratory computer connected to the Olympus BX51 computer and SPOT digital camera also includes the software SPOT Advanced 4.7 to run the digital camera and Adobe Photoshop CS2 for photomerging adjacent images into a single image. This computer is also connected to a Wacom Intuous 9” x 12” digital tablet.\n\nDepartment of Anthropology Resources\n\nThe Department of Anthropology employs one administrative assistant who assists with ordering laboratory materials, one graduate program coordinator who assists graduate students with completing graduation requirements, one systems manager who maintains and repairs computer equipment, and one fiscal officer who oversees grant fund and other expenditures. The Ohio State University Office of the Chief Information Officer provides technical support for university computer networks, university-supplied software, university computer accounts, and computer hardware in university locations. The Ohio State University Office of Environmental Health and Safety provides, collects, and disposes of containers for disposal of biohazardous waste, chemical waste, and sharps, all of which are present in the Bioarchaeology Research Laboratory. This office also provides online training modules to certify researchers to work in the Bioarchaeology Research Laboratory, currently classified as Biosafety Level 2.\n\nOther Equipment/Materials\n\nPreparation of bone and tooth thin sections: Anatomical dissection kit, Dremel 400 XPR (with cut-off wheels No. 409, 429, and 540), Buehler Isomet 1000 Diamond Blade Saw (with series 15LC diamond wafering blades of diameters 4 inches and 6 inches, and a measured kerf of 534 µm), dressing sticks for diamond blade saw, Cool2 Cutting Fluid for diamond blade saw (Concentrated, 1 L), chucks for holding bone to saw (screw chuck, large and small wafer chuck, target holder for petrographic slides, assorted slide holder chucks), xylenes for slide cleaning, (1 gallon), 75 x 50 x 1 mm glass slides (15 boxes of 72 slides each), 75 x 25 x 1 mm glass slides (16 boxes of 72 slides each), 1 x 3 inch petrographic slides (7 boxes of 72 slides each), mounting media for mounting bone to slide (crystal bond, super glue, duco cement, permount), a Mitutoyo digimatic micrometer for measuring section thickness, a Waterpik cordless water flosser for washing out bone marrow, ultrasonic cleaner, and distilled water (~1 gallon).
