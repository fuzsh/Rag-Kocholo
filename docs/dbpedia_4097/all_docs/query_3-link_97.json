        "text": "Patent granted for invention of Alternate Energy Light Trap\n\nMonitoring insects in light traps enable the farmers to know the types of insects lurk in the field and whether or not they are at a manageable level. Once the insect population in the light traps crosses economic threshold level (ETL), the farmers can decide the type of pest management practices they have to undertake. Nature provides a multitude of benefits to humans in the form of natural control of insect pests by their natural enemies. However, the intensification of agricultural production system in recent decades has led to a decline and loss of biodiversity due to increasing use of chemical pesticides. So, to reduce the indiscriminate use of chemical insecticides in the agricultural, horticultural and other crops, an advanced Solar based Alternate Energy Light trap (AELT) was invented by Dr. Shyamaranjan Das Mohapatra, Principal Scientist (Entomology) and Dr (Mrs) Mayabini Jena, Former Principal Scientist & Head of Crop Protection Division of ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack and a patent application No. 341/KOL/2014 was filed by the institute in March 18, 2014. The AELT device traps several flying insects in the crop fields utilizing solar powered system (to lit the lamp at night) which is the first of its kind in India for which the patent has been granted on February 8, 2021 with Patent No. 357993.\n\nThe AELT includes a light trap unit for attracting the flying insects; a collector unit coupled to the light trap unit for receiving the trapped insects from the light trap. A funnel is fitted to direct lured insects into the insect collecting unit. (Read More)"
