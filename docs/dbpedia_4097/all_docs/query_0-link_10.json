        "text": "WORLD WAR II: A Selected List of References\n\nCompiled by Jon Simon, Congressional Research Service and\n\nAlbert E. Smith, Jr., Humanities and Social Sciences Division\n\nJune 1992\n\nINTRODUCTION At 4:45 AM, September 1, 1939, the German military machine known as Blitzkrieg (lightning war) ripped through the border of Poland, its 2,000 planes and 2,800 tanks overwhelming the ill- prepared Polish defenders. Two days later Britain and France declared war against Germany. The Second World War had begun. It officially ended on September 2, 1945, when Mamoru Shigemitsu, foreign minister of Japan, signed the formal instrument of surrender on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Bay. In those six years between the invasion of Poland and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world was caught in the most destructive war in history. Armed forces of more than seventeen million fought on the land, in the air, and on the sea. Thousands of soldiers perished under fire. The civilian toll-- from concentration camps, bombings, disease, and starvation-- reached uncountable millions. From the beginning, the catastrophic events of the war generated an enormous body of literature. Fifteen hundred entries under the subject heading, \"World War, 1939-\" are listed in the Cumulative Book Index covering 1938-1942. The first cumulative volume of the Bibliographic Index, covering the same period, cites more than three hundred bibliographies about the war. Fifty years later the Library of Congress Computer Catalog includes fifty thousand titles on the subject. This guide was prepared to make the huge volume of material less daunting to the general reader or the beginning researcher. We have identified the most useful reference tools-- bibliographies, dictionaries, chronologies, histories, and documentary sources--in the Library of Congress that pertain to the war and United States involvement. However, this bibliography is not intended to be comprehensive. Although it was prepared using the Library's collections, we have selected titles with an eye toward availability. Almost all the reference sources are in English and have been published or reprinted within the last ten years. (Significant titles published earlier or in other languages are cited in several of the listed bibliographies.) In addition to the traditional reference sources, we have included a section of general histories which offer a good introduction to the political, diplomatic, or social aspects of the war. Also, we have incorporated bibliographic essays and bibliographies from the backs of books if a specific topic was otherwise poorly covered. The guide is divided into eight sections, within which entries are listed alphabetically. Descriptive annotations were provided unless a title was self-explanatory. For the convenience of readers using the Library of Congress, location information is provided for books that are part of the reference collections of the Main Reading Room (MRR), Newspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room (N&CPR), Microform Reading Room (MicRR), Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division (M/B/RS), Geography and Map Division (G&M), and Local History and Genealogy Reading Room (LH&G). Most titles cited are also available at large public and research libraries. A reference librarian can provide assistance in finding these items.
