        "text": "A five-year-old boy looks on as a Japanese soldier enters his village near Nanking in July 1942. The soldier has a bag stuffed with candy and pastries.\n\nHe gathers near the playing children. As he hands out the treats, a broad grin spreads across his face. The kids are ecstatic.\n\nThe boy gets a bar of chocolate and sprints with joy.\n\nWho doesn’t enjoy candy?\n\nBut the kid soon finds out that the candy he ate wasn’t regular candy. He shivers with a fever. Blisters erupt on his body. He can’t stop throwing up.\n\nTo the horror of his parents, the boy soon dies. Panic spreads as other kids in the village who ate the sweet treats fall ill and many of them drop dead.\n\nThe smiling Japanese soldier gave the kids candies and cakes laced with anthrax.\n\nIt was a part of a horrific experiment.\n\nHe was following the orders of a heartless scientist, a man who didn’t care about the lives of other humans. He thought his sadistic research could help his country win the war."
