Her research focuses on RNA as it forms a variety of complex globular structures, some of which function like enzymes or form functional complexes with proteins. Her lab's research into RNA biology led to the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 as a tool for making targeted changes to the genome. In bacteria, CRISPR systems preserve invading genetic material and incorporate it into surveillance complexes to achieve adaptive immunity. Crystal structures of diverse Cas9 proteins reveal RNA-mediated conformational activation. Current research in the Doudna lab focuses on discovering and determining the mechanisms of novel CRISPR-Cas and associated proteins; developing genome editing tools for use in vitro, in plants, and in mammals; and developing anti-CRISPR agents. New discoveries in this field continue at a rapid pace, revealing a technology that has widespread applications in many areas of biology.\n\nSee also: https://innovativegenomics.org\n\nIn the News\n\nHighly Targeted CRISPR Delivery Advances Gene Editing in Living Animals\n\nPrecision-targeted gene editing on specific subsets of cells while still in the body is a step toward a delivery method that would eliminate the need to obliterate patients' bone marrow and immune system before giving them edited blood cells.\n\nA History of Innovation: Berkeley Entrepreneurs, Companies that Changed the Way We Live\n\nThe culture and spirit of innovation at UC Berkeley throughout history can be seen in the changemakers who have helped in countless ways to improve our lives and our world.\n\nIGI’s ‘Audacious’ New Frontier for CRISPR: Editing Microbiomes for Climate and Health\n\n$70M funding will catalyze a bold new initiative led by Jennifer Doudna and Jill Banfield to apply precision genome editing to microbial communities.\n\nWhat Makes Omicron More Infectious Than Other COVID-19 Variants\n\nAs the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly around the globe earlier this year, researchers at Gladstone Institutes, UC Berkeley, and the Innovative Genomics Institute used virus-like particles to identify which parts of the virus are responsible for its increased infectivity and spread.\n\nIn 10 years, CRISPR Transformed Medicine. Can It Now Help Us Deal With Climate Change?\n\nComing from a long line of Iowa farmers, David Savage always thought he would do research to improve crops. That dream died in college, when it became clear that any genetic tweak to a crop would take at least a year to test; for some perennials and trees, it could take five to 10 years. Faced with such slow progress, he chose to study the proteins in photosynthetic bacteria instead. But the advent of CRISPR changed all that.\n\nChan Zuckerberg Initiative Puts $11 Million Into Carbon Capture Research\n\nNew funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative kickstarts CRISPR-enabled carbon removal research at the Innovative Genomics Institute\n\nOmicron Infection Leaves Unvaxxed With Little Protection Against Variant\n\nIn unvaccinated people, infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 provides little long-term immunity against other variants, according to a new study by researchers at Gladstone Institutes and UC San Francisco (UCSF), published today in the journal Nature.\n\nBerkeley’s Bakar BioEnginuity Hub Opens Its Doors\n\nUC Berkeley’s campus community this week celebrated the grand opening of the Bakar BioEnginuity Hub (BBH), the campus’s bold new home for research and innovation. After two years of seismic upgrades and renovations, BBH celebrated its opening this month. Bakar Labs, the facility’s flagship life sciences incubator, has been operational since mid-November, offering space to tenant companies.\n\nCRISPRing the Microbiome is Just Around the Corner\n\nTo date, CRISPR enzymes have been used to edit the genomes of one type of cell at a time: They cut, delete or add genes to a specific kind of cell within a tissue or organ, for example, or to one kind of microbe growing in a test tube. Now, the University of California, Berkeley, group that invented the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology nearly 10 years ago has found a way to add or modify genes within a community of many different species simultaneously, opening the door to what could be called “community editing.”\n\n$17 Million Will Launch Trial of CRISPR Cure for Sickle Cell Disease\n\nA small clinical trial of a CRISPR cure for sickle cell disease, approved earlier this year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has received $17 million to enroll about nine patients, the first of which may be selected before the end of the year. The funds — $8.4 million from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and $8.6 million from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) — were awarded to UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland, which will coordinate the four-year clinical study in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, and UCLA.\n\nUsing two CRISPR enzymes, a COVID diagnostic in only 20 minutes\n\nFrequent, rapid testing for COVID-19 is critical to controlling the spread of outbreaks, especially as new, more transmissible variants emerge. A research team at the UC, Berkeley is aiming to develop a diagnostic test that is much faster and easier to deploy than the gold standard qRT-PCR diagnostic test. The team has now combined two different types of CRISPR enzymes to create an assay that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in less than an hour.\n\nHigh-powered, but supportive, environment draws students to Nobel winners’ labs\n\nOn the morning that University of California, Berkeley, professor Jennifer Doudna won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, her first stop after a 7 a.m. press conference and subsequent media interviews was her campus lab in the Innovative Genomics Institute. When she exited the elevator with her family at 10:30 a.m., she was greeted by dozens of graduate students and lab staff, while several dozen current and former lab members joined in via Zoom.\n\nNobel Prize ceremonies go virtual for Doudna, Genzel\n\nFor the first time since World War II, winners of this year’s Nobel Prizes will not be receiving their medals and diplomas from the King of Sweden in Stockholm. The pandemic has forced the Nobel Committees to deliver the medals to recipients at their homes, with just immediate family and consular or embassy officials in attendance.\n\nNew CRISPR-based COVID-19 test uses smartphone cameras to spot virus RNA\n\nIdentifying and isolating individuals who may be contagious with the coronavirus is key to limiting the spread of the disease. But even months into the pandemic, many patients are still waiting days to receive COVID-19 test results.\n\nUC Berkeley campus reacts to this week’s two Nobel Prize wins\n\nIn just two days, UC Berkeley is two Nobel Prizes richer. Today (Wednesday, Oct. 7), biochemist Jennifer Doudna won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, for the co-development of CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing tool that allows scientists to rewrite DNA.\n\nFirst Day in a Nobel Life: Jennifer Doudna\n\nWhen UC Berkeley biochemist Jennifer Doudna went to sleep last night, she didn’t give serious thought to her chance of winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Then, a phone call woke her up today, just before 3 a.m. It was a reporter, asking for a comment about winning the prize.

For more on this, see our press release at Berkeley News.\n\nFullStory (*requires registration)\n\nKen Alltucker\n\nCoronavirus tests performed in labs are the gold standard for accuracy, and antigen tests are a fast and inexpensive alternative. But backers of a third type of test, developed by a Nobel Prize winner using cutting-edge CRISPR technology, say it has the potential to be all three: rapid, accurate and inexpensive. Dr. Jennifer Doudna, a University of California, Berkeley researcher whose pioneering work in CRISPR earned a share of this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry, said the test can be done quickly and doesn't require a lab. \"We have a ways to go before CRISPR-based diagnostics reach widespread use, but I believe we'll see an impact during the current pandemic,\" Doudna said. \"Because it is simple to adjust these tests to detect other targets, the platform we're developing now is laying the groundwork to deploy CRISPR for rapid diagnosis during future outbreaks.\"\n\nJill Cowan\n\nThe New York Times talks to UC Berkeley biochemist Jennifer Doudna about her winning the Nobel Prize in chemistry and about the impact the pandemic has had on her work. \"I'd love to see science become more integrated into our daily conversations. It seems that in the past, at least in certain societies, science was much more integrated. And I would love to see us work toward that. We could be using different forms of media, whether it's in cartoons or short videos, and more conversational use of language that isn't exclusive - not using jargon. One of the things that I've seen in my career is that there's been an unfortunate change in the opposite direction where scientists are increasingly distrusted.\" For more on this, see our press release at Berkeley News.\n\nFullStory (*requires registration)\n\nMichael Cabanatuan\n\nUC Berkeley biochemist Jennifer Doudna won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for her work helping to develop a genome-editing tool, a breakthrough in biomedicine.

Stories on this topic have appeared in dozens of sources around the world.\n\nJoe Palca\n\nA new COVID-19 testing system that harnesses CRISPR gene-editing technology takes significantly less time to report results -- roughly 40 minutes, compared to the 4-to-6-hour turnaround with currently used tests. The scientists developing the CRISPR test are from UCSF and Mammoth Biosciences, a startup co-founded and advised by molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna, one of CRISPR's co-inventors. On Thursday, the researchers published a second study demonstrating the test's capabilities in the largest-yet sample of real patients in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology. Speaking of how easy and self-contained the test is, compared to others currently used, Charles Chiu, associate director of the UCSF clinical microbiology laboratory and the scientist leading the study with Mammoth, says: \"I can run it now myself at home. ... What we really want to develop is something like a handheld, pocket-sized device using disposable cartridges\" that nonexperts could use. He says they plan to submit the test for FDA approval next week. Stories on this topic have appeared in more than 100 sources around the world, including CNET, KPIX Online, and KTVU--link to video.\n\nErin Brodwin\n\nA new COVID-19 testing system that harnesses CRISPR gene-editing technology takes significantly less time to report results -- roughly 40 minutes, compared to the 4-to-6-hour turnaround with currently used tests. The scientists developing the CRISPR test are from UCSF and Mammoth Biosciences, a startup co-founded and advised by molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna, one of CRISPR's co-inventors. On Thursday, the researchers published a second study demonstrating the test's capabilities in the largest-yet sample of real patients in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Biotechnology. The test does currently have some flaws, including false negatives, but, as Charles Chiu, associate director of the UCSF clinical microbiology laboratory and the scientist leading the study with Mammoth, says: \"The advantage of this test is that it could be done rapidly, and even multiple times, if needed. ... We literally went from nothing to an assay in three weeks. ... This is a state-of-the-art technology. ... It's going to undergo a lot of regulatory scrutiny because it's going to be the first of its kind.\" Chiu says they plan to submit the test for FDA approval next week.\n\nMatthew Herper\n\nMolecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna, co-inventor of the CRISPR gene editing technology, is leading a team of academic and industry researchers in setting up a testing site for the COVID-19 coronavirus. Using a 2,500-square-foot laboratory, they will serve the Bay Area, processing more than 1,000 samples a day. Later, if the need is there, they hope to be able to process 3,000 a day. \"This is a big, big issue here in the U.S.,\" Professor Doudna says. \"We need to ramp up testing very fast. It's been problematic for various reasons. And so we are building and implementing a clinical testing laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus to do exactly that. ... It's unbelievable to see how fast this is coming together and people writing software just overnight to put such a complicated pipeline in place and ensure that it's secure.\" For more on this, see our press release at Berkeley News. Another story on this topic appeared in Berkeleyside.\n\nNidhi Subbaraman\n\nAs scientists race to find new diagnostic tests for the COVID-19 coronavirus, molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna is working on solutions using the CRISPR gene-editing technology she co-invented. Through Mammoth Biosciences, a biotechnology startup she co-founded, she aims to validate the CRISPR-based approach called DETECTR. It uses CRISPR to recognize specific genetic sequences and cut them. In the process, it also cuts a 'reporter' molecule added to the reaction, and that quickly shows if the viral genetic material is present. \"Every single time we have an outbreak, we're one step behind in that we don't have a rapid diagnostic to detect that new organism,\" says Charles Chiu, an infectious-diseases physician at UCSF, who is working with Mammoth Biosciences. \"The key advantage is that a CRISPR reaction is incredibly specific and can be done in 510 minutes.\" Another story on this topic appeared in Science.\n\nDaniel Markus\n\nIn an interview about the CRISPR gene-editing technology she co-invented, molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna is asked how she feels about indications in human clinical trials that CRISPR is showing promise for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. She responds: \"Deeply moved, because I think for any of us working in science, the idea that our work could someday help someone with a health care situation that they and their families are facing, that's really why we do our work. So I feel very excited about the potential of the technology. ... Of course, I'm cautious. I want to make sure that it proceeds in a very appropriate, regulated fashion, and these trials that we're seeing the early announcements for right now are going exactly down that path. ... Assuming that those trials pan out, the big question will be how do we make sure that this technology is affordable and accessible to people that need it? That's really the challenge that I'm now thinking more and more about and working on at the Innovative Genomics Institute.\"\n\nGreer Fay Cashman\n\nMolecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna is sharing the 2020 Wolf Prize in Medicine with colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute in Berlin for their co-invention of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. The international prize is awarded in Israel by the Wolf Foundation, and it is widely considered a stepping stone to the Nobel Prize. For more on this, see our press release at Berkeley News. Stories on this topic have appeared in hundreds of sources around the world, including Haaretz (Israel).\n\nSarah Morgan\n\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office has granted UC its 20th US patent on CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technologies, co-invented by molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna. It was the 18th CRISPR-Cas9-related patent awarded to UC and its collaborators in just the last year. \"2019 was an incredibly important and fruitful year in our continuous efforts to sustain UC as the leader of CRISPR-Cas9 IP in the US,\" said Eldora Ellison, UC's lead patent strategist on CRISPR-Cas9 and a director at Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein & Fox. For more on this, see our story at Berkeley News.\n\nMelr Rinde\n\nBiochemist Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues rocked the research world in 2012 when they described a simple way of editing the DNA of any organism using an RNA-guided protein found in bacteria. Discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology sharply accelerated work on human and nonhuman gene editing, helping researchers develop potential treatments for HIV, sickle-cell disease, and muscular dystrophy. Doudna, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has become the public face of CRISPR and an advocate for robust public discussion of the ethical implications of gene editing. In November 2018 she visited the Science History Institute to give the annual Ullyot Public Affairs Lecture and receive the accompanying award. Before the talk Distillations writer Meir Rinde sat down with Doudna to find out what scientists can do with CRISPR, whether we should worry about designer embryos, and how to grow 500 tomatoes on a single plant.\n\nClaire Hoffman\n\nIn a series called \"Women Shaping the Future,\" molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna is profiled for her co-invention of the CRISPR gene-editing technology, which the writers describe as \"capable of changing the DNA of any living thing almost as simply as using a find-and-replace function in a word processor.\" While noting the life-affirming potential of the technology -- from curing heritable diseases to enhancing crops -- they also highlight her leadership in ensuring that the technology is used ethically and responsibly. Professor Doudna was also interviewed by BBC--link to audio.\n\nClaudia Dreifus\n\nMolecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna received the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize recently at Rockefeller University in New York. The honor, established by Nobel Laureat Paul Greengard and his wife, the artist Ursula von Rydingsvard, recognizes women scientists. Before the ceremony, Professor Doudna talked to this reporter, and their conversation is transcribed here. Asked about some of the difficulties she's experienced in patent cases related to her co-invention of the CRISPR genome-editing technology, she says: \"The truth is that no one can ever take away from me the joy of the actual discovery. No one can take away those moments in the lab when we saw something in nature that had never been seen before. ... That's what I love about science. You go into the lab, do an experiment, and get a little bit of knowledge about the world that unravels another piece of the mystery of nature. I love that.\"\n\nMegan Molteni\n\nA new lab co-founded by molecular and cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna will explore genome surgery options for patients with rare genetic disorders. Using the CRISPR gene-editing technology she co-invented, she intends to find ways to edit out faulty genes, curing the diseases at the source -- in their genetic code. Professor Doudna has established a number of labs to explore various uses of the CRISPR technology, but often the pressure of turning a quick profit prohibits costly research that would benefit small populations. Since this would help people with rare diseases, she chose to house this lab at Gladstone, a nonprofit biomedical research center affiliated with UC San Francisco. \"We're focused on what's going to be best for patients in the long run, not simply what product can we quickly bring to market. ... We need to step back and figure out how to ensure in the future that this technology is not something only available to the 0.1 percent.\" For more on this, see our story at the Berkeley College of Chemistry.\n\nLoading Class list ..."
