        "text": "Frank Baldwin Jewett (1939–1947)\n\nWorld War II was foreshadowed in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Mussolini's assault on Ethiopia in 1935, Italian and German interference in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and Hitler's march into the Rhineland in 1936. Then Austria and Czechoslovakia fell to Hitler, and Albania to Mussolini. Upon the full-scale German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Britain and France declared war against the Third Reich. A week later President Roosevelt declared a state of limited national emergency.\n\nFrank Jewett, a man of great vigor and action, elected to the presidency of the Academy in 1939, was soon the driving force behind the Academy's mobilization for the war effort. Possessed of a keen intellect, wide interests, and an amazing talent for friendship, he could be, when the occasion called for it, outspoken and colorful in his speech and correspondence; and, happily for history, he kept meticulous records.\n\nAs a member of the Science Advisory Board and its Executive Council, he had tended to be wary of the partnership of science and government. Some in the Academy might deplore this cautious attitude, but none denied his talent for getting things done.\n\nLike presidents before him, Jewett would have many occasions to remind the membership of the one and only purpose of the Academy, to respond to any department of the government \"whenever called upon.\" Out of some idiosyncrasy, Jewett invariably wrote and quoted it as \"whenever requested,\" and it was dutifully printed that way in Academy publications. 1\n\nDescended from New England ancestors who settled in Massachusetts in 1632, Frank Jewett was born on September 5, 1879, in Pasadena, California, a community at that time of some twelve houses. Paternal relatives had earlier purchased a large section of the surrounding country, and his father had been given a wild tract of twenty-five acres as a wedding present.\n\nHe was graduated in 1898 with an A.B. degree from nearby Throop Institute, which later became the California Institute of Technology. An adviser persuaded him to do his graduate work in physics at the University of Chicago, where he roomed with Oswald Veblen and was for a time Michelson's research assistant. After receiving his Ph.D., he went to MIT in 1902 as an instructor in physics.\n\nHis career, however, was not to be in physics, but in engineering. After two years at MIT, he heard of an opening in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and joined it as a transmission engineer. His life and calling coincided almost exactly with the first seventy years of the telephone.\n\nJust three years before Jewett's birth, Alexander Graham Bell had obtained his first patent, and in 1877 formed the Bell Telephone Company. Entering the young industry when he was twenty-five, Jewett was sent first to the company offices in Boston, where he demonstrated an extraordinary knack for seeing the solution to problems and supervising the necessary engineering research. He rose rapidly to the top of its engineering department and from there went to the New York office. By 1912, he was an acknowledged expert on long-distance telephone transmission and was made Assistant Chief Engineer of the Bell System's manufacturing unit, Western Electric. He went on to become Chief Engineer in 1916, and Vice-President and Director in 1922.\n\nShortly after the Engineering Department of Western Electric became the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Jewett was made its President early in 1925 and a Vice-President of AT&T, in charge of all research and development in the Bell System.\n\nHe was elected to the Academy in 1918, in recognition of his achievements in communications research and development and his services to the Signal Corps and Navy in World War I, and was active in its affairs from that time on. He had come to know Vannevar Bush in 1917 when they met at the Navy antisubmarine laboratory at New London, Connecticut. Jewett was then an advisory member of the Navy's Special Board on Submarine Detection; and Bush, with doctorates in engineering from both Harvard and MIT, was engaged in research at the laboratory. 2\n\nIn 1923, shortly after Jewett became Chairman of the Research Council's Division of Engineering, he brought in Bush as a member, who not long after his election to the Academy in 1934 took over the division chairmanship. The close association was furthered by their membership in other Academy–Research Council committees, notably the Committee on Scientific Aids to Learning. 3"
