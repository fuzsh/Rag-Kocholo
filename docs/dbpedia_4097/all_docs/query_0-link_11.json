        "text": "Lessons Learned and Unlearned: The Drivers of US Indirect-Fire Innovation\n\nMAJ Brennan S. Deveraux\n\nArt of War Scholars Series\n\n191 Pages\n\nPublished: 2024\n\nLessons Learned and Unlearned analyzes nearly a century of US artillery innovation and adaptation, focusing on the pressures of incorporating new technology, applying combat experience, and assessing external threats. Indirect fire’s role on the battlefield has been repeatedly reshaped by new technologies on the one hand and organizational and doctrinal changes on the other. This research examines successful and unsuccessful historical indirect-fire adaptations since the birth of indirect fire—identifying innovation themes, insights into future issues, and recommendations for more effective indirect fire.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nNot Just Lucky\n\nHow Patton’s Third Army Adapted to Generate Information Advantage, 1944\n\nSpencer L. French, Major, US Army\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nIn August 1944, Patton’s Third Army smashed through German defenses in Normandy and broke out in a rapid pursuit across France. Third Army’s success was substantially due to its effectiveness at generating operational level information advantage. Information advantage enabled Third Army to gain and maintain the initiative, anticipate decisions, and extend operational reach. Yet when Third Army activated in England in the Spring of 1944, it possessed neither the information forces nor the staff processes to generate information advantage effectively. This study examines how Patton successfully embedded a unique military culture that encouraged rapid adaptation within Third Army’s information forces. Specifically, it explores how Patton’s visionary leadership created a sense of organizational urgency, reducing change resistance. It also analyzes how Patton’s coalition established robust feedback loops and a culture of self-criticism and experimentation. Finally, it looks at how Patton leveraged diverse expertise to develop devastatingly effective solutions to complex problems. Improvements in Third Army’s ability to generate information advantage resulted not from any technological advance or material factor but from a military culture that encouraged adaptation.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nArmies in Retreat\n\nChaos, Cohesion, and Consequences\n\nTimothy G. Heck and Walker D. Mills\n\nPublished: 2023\n\nIn Armies in Retreat: Chaos, Cohesion, and Consequences, editors Timothy Heck and Walker Mills have culled together a collection of essays that fills a critical gap in publications and literature covering large-scale combat operations. Every battle has two sides: the victors and the vanquished. This book explores retreating armies—those that maintained cohesion and later succeeded and others that devolved into chaos. Ultimately, this book is about surviving defeat and designed to inform leaders about what to expect when the unexpected happens, to prevent the shock and mitigate some of the terror on every side so they can respond with resilience and cohesion. Retreat, while unpalatable, can ultimately lead to military or national survival, even victory.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nNisei Spirit: The Cultural Identity of the 442nd RCT\n\nBy David F. Bonner\n\n67 Pages\n\nPublished: 2022\n\nThe majority of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II consisted of second-generation Japanese Americans, or Nisei. An enduring sense of duty instilled by their families and a tight-knit network of Nikkei communities in the United States shaped the combat motivations of the Nisei soldiers. Author David Bonner examines this strong cultural identity, paired with the task cohesion and the primary group cohesion theories, as it forms a framework for achieving a better understanding of small-unit effectiveness. This is a story of unparalleled fortitude in the face of adversity, ranging from prejudice in the rear to seemingly overwhelming odds on the frontlines.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nA Battle Report: Alam Halfa (CSIRP)\n\nCPT Hart and Generalleutnant Bayerlein, MG Roberts\n\n46 Pages\n\nPublished: 2012\n\nTHE BATTLE OF ALAM HALFA IN 1942, fought as August turned into September, was a turning point of the war in the Mediterranean-indeed, more truly a turning point than the more celebrated \"Battle of Alamein\" that followed, in the fall. For by the time this started, late in October, the British build-up of strength in North Africa so vastly exceeded that of the German and Italian forces under Rommel as to ensure the frustration of his attempt to overrun Egypt-leaving only the question of how long he could cling on to the door, and whether he could escape destruction.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nBattle of Metz\n\nCSI Battlebook 13-A\n\nBy J. McNulty, et al.\n\n84 Pages\n\nPublished: 1984\n\nThe battle of Metz is but one episode in what is commonly referred to as the Northwest Europe Campaign during the final year of World War II. The campaign really began on 25 July 1944 when the Allied armies broke out from the confines of the Normandy Peninsula and ended in May of the following year when the German Army surrendered unconditionally. To reduce the scale somewhat further, the operations that made up the Battle of Metz and which lasted from September through December 1944, were part of the Lorraine campaign, waged during the same period by the Third U.S. Army.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nDefending the Driniumor: Covering Force Operations in New Guinea, 1944\n\nLeavenworth Papers No. 9\n\nBy Dr. Edward J. Drea\n\n189 Pages\n\nPublished: 1984\n\nThe U.S. Army’s extensive amphibious campaigns in the Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II have been all but forgotten today. The conduct of those far-flung operations, the sustenance of more than twenty-seven U.S. Army infantry divisions, and the imaginative planning required for bold thrusts deep into the enemy’s rear areas offer timeless lessons for commanders. Moreover, a new aspect of the Pacific War has recently surfaced: the ability of the U.S. Army to read the most secret Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) codes-in short, to “see deep” for the purposes of operational planning. This Leavenworth Paper correlates, insofar as possible, the influence of Ultra intelligence on the conduct of General Douglas MacArthur’s Aitape, New Guinea, campaign. The signals intelligence community regarded the U.S. XI Corps’s destruction of the Imperial Japanese 18th Army as one of the singular achievements of the intelligence craft during World War II.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nDesert Warfare\n\nGerman Experiences in World War II\n\nBy MG Alfred Toppe\n\n113 Pages\n\nPublished: 1991\n\nAnalysts continue to assess the data from Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm as a means of improving the military's to function efficiently in desert terrain. The information gleaned from this effort will enhance the already considerable of knowledge on the subject derived from the historical record. That record, of course, is incomplete, in that much valuable information was never and much that was has been lost or forgotten. When contributions in the latter category are located or rediscovered, they should he given the dissemination they merit.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nJapan's Battle of Okinawa, April-June 1945\n\nLeavenworth Papers No. 18\n\nBy Thomas M. Huber\n\n160 Pages\n\nPublished: 1990\n\nDuring the Pacific war, from 1937 to 1945, the Japanese military grew to an end strength of 7 million men. Over the course of the war, this represented some 28 million man-years of uniformed service to the Japanese Empire. Imperial service spanned every conceivable environment, from subarctic in Manchuria to steaming rain forest in New Guinea, and every conceivable adversary, from a Soviet armored corps at Nomonhan in 1939 to isolated nationalist guerrillas in the Philippine archipelago. Moreover, there is an abundant literature in Japanese on these experiences in the form of official histories, unit histories, memoirs, biographies, and studies by scholars and journalists.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nMerrill's Marauders\n\nCombined Operations in Northern Burma in 1944\n\nBy Dr. Gary J. Bjorge\n\n62 Pages\n\nPublished: 1996\n\nDuring World War II, the United States fought as a member of the largest military coalition ever formed. Across the world, millions of American soldiers, sailors, and airmen joined with the fighting forces of other nations to defeat the Axis Powers. As they did so, they wrote many new chapters in the history of coalition warfare and combined operations. Of those chapters, none illustrates the benefits and the difficulties inherent in this type of warfare more vividly than does the story ofwhat happened to “Merrill’s Marauders” in northern Burma.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nSoldier Extraordinaire\n\nThe Life and Career of Brig. Gen. Frank “Pinkie” Dorn (1901–81)\n\nBy Alfred Emile Cornebise\n\n266 Pages\n\nPublished: 2019\n\nDr. Alfred Cornebise's biography of BG Frank \"Pinkie\" Dorn offers a case study of the importance of cultural immersion and foreign language skills in creating flexible and adaptable officers who can successfully work with Allied forces to achieve success in wartime. While serving as an aide to GEN Joseph Stilwell in the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater of World War II, Dorn commanded \"Y Force,\" comprised of twenty Chinese divisions engaged in liberating northern Burma and southern China from Japanese control. But it was Dorn's years of service as an \"Old China Hand,\" that enabled him to successfully train, equip, advise, and eventually lead Allied forces in large-scale combat operations. Thus, Dorn's life serves as a model for both Foreign Area Officers (FAOs) who immerse themselves in a foreign language and culture in order to facilitate military cooperation in times of crisis, as well as Soldiers of the new Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) tasked with training host-nation forces. BG Dorn was undoubtedly one of the Army’s unsung \"Engineers of Victory\" in World War II.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nSoviet Night Operations in World War II\n\nLeavenworth Papers No. 6\n\nBy MAJ Claude R. Sasso\n\n66 Pages\n\nPublished: 1982\n\nOne of the more perplexing problems contemporary military planners face is that of conducting night operations. Psychologically, night has atways been a realm of the unknown and the uncertain, magnified by imaginatron. Whrle dealing with this psychological barrrer to the conduct of battle at nrght, the soldier must also cope with a myrrad of more tangrbfe problems. Coordination of forces in battle at night tests the mettle of the most proficient leader and the most hrghly trained force. Yet, the fact is that those armies that can operate successfully at night have a marked advantage over adversaries who cannot.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nAttack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941\n\nA Study of Defending America\n\nBy LTC Jeffrey J. Gudmens and the Staff Ride Team Combat Studies Institute\n\n176 Pages\n\nPublished: 2005\n\nThe Pearl Harbor Staff Ride Handbook is the ninth study in the Combat Studies Institute’s (CSI’s) Staff Ride Handbook series. LTC Jeffrey Gudmens’ handbook on Pearl Harbor allows individuals and organizations to study this battle not only in the context of the Japanese attack but, more importantly, in the context of issues that are relevant to the current global war on terror. In addition to analyzing the actual attack, Gudmens also enables users of this work to examine the problems associated with conducting joint planning and operations between the US Army, the Army Air Forces, and the US Navy.\n\nHe also provides insights into the problems of a Homeland Security environment in which intelligence operatives from a foreign nation (and potentially even recent immigrants from that foreign nation who are now US citizens) can operate with little hindrance in a free and open democratic society. Additionally, this study provides an opportunity to look at how military commanders and planners prepared for their wartime mission with inadequate resources and equipment. Each of these issues, and others analyzed herein, is as relevant to us today as it was almost 65 years ago. Modern military professionals for whom this handbook was written will find a great deal to ponder and analyze when studying the events leading up to, and including, the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nStanding Fast: German Defensive Doctrine on the Russian Front During World War II: Prewar to March 1943\n\nCSI Research Survey No. 5\n\nBy MAJ Timothy A. Wray\n\n230 Pages\n\nPublished: 1986\n\nIn this Research Survey, Major Timothy A. Wray provides an excellent survey of the intricacies of employing defensive tactics against a powerful opponent. Using after-action reports, unit war diaries, and other primary materials, Major Wray analyzes the doctrine and tactics that the Germans used on the Eastern Front during World War II.\n\nAt the end of World War I, the Germans adopted the elastic defense IR depth and continued to use it as therr basic doctrine through the end of World War II. However, because of limitations caused by difficult terrain, severe weather, manpawer and supply shortages, Soviet tactics, and Hitler’s order to stand fast. German commanders were unable to implement the Elastic Defense in its true form. Even so, innovative and resourceful unit commanders were able to adapt to the harsh realities of combat and improvise defensive methods that saved the German armies from complete annihilation.\n\nDownload the PDF\n\nThe Soviet Airborne Experience\n\nCSI Research Survey No. 4\n\nBy LTC David M. Glantz\n\n232 Pages\n\nPublished: 1984\n\nDeep battle, a major element in both U.S. and Soviet doctrine, is a tenet that emphasizes destroying, suppressing, or disorganizing enemy forces not only at the line of contact, but throughout the depth of the battlefield. Airborne forces are a primary instrument to accomplish this type of operation. While the exploits of German, British, and American paratroops since 1940 are well known to most professional soldiers, the equivalent experience of the Soviet Union has been largely ignored—except in the Soviet Union. There, the Red ·Army's airborne operations have become the focus of many recent studies by military theorists.\n\nDownload the PDF"
