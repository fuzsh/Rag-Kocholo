Conway Twitty, who started as a teen rock idol in the 1950s and crossed over to country to become a star, died Saturday at age 59.

His wife, Dee Henry, other relatives and some of his band members were with him at Cox Medical Center-South when he died of complications from surgery after a blood vessel ruptured in his stomach.Twitty collapsed on his tour bus during a rest stop in southwest Missouri. He was on the way home to Hendersonville, Tenn., from a performance Friday night in Branson.

"I've just been sitting here crying," said Sandy Brokaw, Twitty's press representative. "I was in awe of the man."

Twitty was born Sept. 1, 1933, as Harold Lloyd Jenkins, named after the silent movie star. He changed his name in 1957 by borrowing from Conway, Ark., and Twitty, Texas.

After spending many years as a songwriter, his performing career took off with the name change. He recorded more than 40 No. 1 hits, including "Hello Darlin'," "Tight-Fittin' Jeans" and "Linda On My Mind."

"Everyone will remember Conway Twitty, industry and fans alike, as the consummate singer and performer, who has been this wonderful and dynamic presence in our business for over 30 years," said Bruce Hinton, chairman of MCA Records in Nashville.

Mel Tillis, who said Twitty and his wife were at Tillis' Branson theater Thursday night, called Twitty a great singer.

"He didn't do a lot of talking on stage, he said he let his music do his talking," Tillis said. "He was a song's best friend, because he could really sing."

Twitty and Loretta Lynn won the Country Music Association's Vocal Duo of the Year award in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975. They won a Grammy for their 1971 duet, "After The Fire Is Gone."
