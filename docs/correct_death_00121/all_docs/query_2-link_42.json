        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Though not a member of the Grand Ole Opry, Conway Twitty was in the thoughts of many members Saturday night.\n\n\"We're all a little sad here tonight,\" opening act Ricky Skaggs said from the stage of the Grand Ole Opry House. \"We loved Conway Twitty very much. His records will live on and on. \" The 59-year-old Twitty died Saturday of complications following surgery for a ruptured blood vessel in his stomach. He collapsed on his tour bus during a rest stop in southwest Missouri. He was on the way home to Hendersonville, Tenn., from a performance Friday night in Branson, Mo.\n\nBackstage at the Opry, many of country music's legends talked about Twitty and his impact on the country music scene.\n\n\"I knew Conway very well,\" Little Jimmy Dickens said. \"I was always amazed at how hard he worked onstage to entertain his fans. He didn't get the credit he deserved. I lost a good friend and the world has lost one of the greatest entertainers that ever lived. \" Two men remembered Twitty's love of baseball.\n\nThe first time Hairl Hensley, a Grand Ole Opry announcer, met him, Twitty had brought a boy's baseball team from Oklahoma City to Nashville to play ball. Hensley was supposed to interview the artist about music, but he talked to the boys about baseball.\n\nBill Anderson recalled an early 1970s game.\n\n\"One of my favorite memories was when Conway chartered a DC-9 jet, picked up me, my band and my softball team and flew us to Oklahoma City. We played Conway's softball team in a charity game at 89er Stadium. We had 10,000 people there, and raised $30,000,\" he said.\n\nBackstage, Hank Snow said, \"He and Loretta Lynn did one of the first fund-raisers for child abuse. He was a very fine person. He was a fine artist, a good writer, good at everything. I sure hate to lose him. \" Stonewall Jackson and Twitty started their careers about the same time. They had hits at the same time, Jackson's \"Waterloo\" and Twitty's \"Make Believe. \" They worked together a lot, and Jackson remembered Twitty fondly.\n\n\"He was a great family man, he'll be missed an awful lot,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"I remember one time when he was changing from rock to country, he told me I was his favorite country singer. I was honored by that. \" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 541897"
