        "text": "Harold Lloyd Jenkins (September 1, 1933 – June 5, 1993), better known by his stage name Conway Twitty, was an American country music singer and songwriter. He also had success in the rock and roll, R&B, and pop genres. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of Country Music Association awards for duets with Loretta Lynn. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\n\nOn June 4, 1993, Twitty became ill while performing at the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He collapsed on his tour bus after the show and was rushed to a hospital. He was rushed into surgery, but died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, in the early hours of the following morning at Cox South Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, at the age of 59. Loretta Lynn, who frequently was his chart making duet partner, was at the hospital because her husband Oliver was recovering from heart surgery, saw Twitty briefly as he entered the hospital. Twitty was buried at Sumner Memorial Gardens in Gallatin, Tennessee, in a red granite vault, under his birth name “Harold L. Jenkins”. There are spaces reserved next to him for his wife and his son Michael.\n\n25 Number Ones is an album from country music artist Conway Twitty, released August 24, 2004, comprising 25 songs. The album reached number 29 on the U.S. Billboard country albums chart and features such hits as “Hello Darlin'” and “Tight Fittin’ Jeans”."
