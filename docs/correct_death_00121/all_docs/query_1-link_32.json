        "text": "Conway, city, seat of Faulkner county, central Arkansas, U.S., 25 miles (40 km) north of Little Rock. Primarily a community of educational institutions, it is the home of the University of Central Arkansas (1907), Hendrix College (which moved there from Altus in 1890), and Central Baptist College (1952). Arkansas Childrenâ€™s Colony (1959), for the mentally handicapped, is also in the city.\n\nFounded in 1871 and incorporated in 1875, Conway was named for a family who moved to Arkansas in the early 1800s. Its economy was long based on the schools and regional agriculture. Manufacturing began after World War II, fostered by the establishment (1962) of an industrial park. Data processing and the manufacture of motor vehicles, automotive equipment, and furniture are now important components of the economy."
