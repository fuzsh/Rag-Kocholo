        "text": "HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. - A somber group of country music's finest gathered Wednesday in this Nashville suburb to honor music great Conway Twitty, who died Saturday in Missouri.\n\nTwitty was buried by his family in private services Sunday.\n\nThe star-studded memorial service at the First Baptist Church was a way for friends and fans to say their farewells.\n\nThe 2,200-seat church was packed with Twitty's fans seated in the balcony. The main floor contained country stars past and present and a scattering of press. No cameras were allowed inside.\n\nThe altar area was bedecked with floral arrangements from friends, fans and other stars unable to attend.\n\nThe memorial service opened with Twitty's recording of \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit. \" The Rev. Dr. Glenn Weekly gave the opening prayer and a short sermon from the pulpit.\n\n\"We're here to praise the God that made Conway Twitty,\" said Weekly, who concluded with a reading of the 23rd Psalm.\n\nTwitty's daughter, Kathy Twitty, talked about her father and related a touching story he told her when she asked why the industry so long ignored him.\n\n\"This is the saddest day of my family's life, but it also is a celebration of father's life, a celebration of his new life with the Lord,\" she said with a tear-choked voice. \"Country lost a superstar. We lost the heart and soul of our family. \" Ralph Emery, host of the television show Nashville Now, followed Kathy Twitty, telling Twitty stories of his own between tributes by Vince Gill, George Jones, the Statler Brothers, Ronnie McDowell, the Oak Ridge Boys, Tammy Wynette, Connie Smith and Reba McEntire.\n\nAt the TNN Music City News Country Awards Monday night, Gill, an Oklahoman, had not decided what to sing at Twitty's memorial.\n\nAt the ceremony, Gill, an Oklahoman, talked about his first gig in Nashville, a show at Twitty City. He sang harmony for Twitty for six years.\n\nGill sang his own composition, \"When I Call Your Name. \" Jones was brief in his comments.\n\n\"For the last three years we toured together, our bands became family,\" he related. \"I feel sad for his family and fans, I loved him very much and I'm speechless. \" \"Twitty was the kind of guy, as soon as you turned your back, he'd say something nice about you,\" said one of the Statler Brothers before the group sang \"Rock of Ages. \" Two surprise speakers were Porter Wagoner and Mae Boren Axton, mother of singer Hoyt Axton.\n\n\"He was a soft-spoken boy determined with a quiet sense of humor,\" Mae Axton recalled. \"Harold Jenkins (Twitty's real name) was my friend. He always gave so much and asked so little. \" Emery told a quick Twitty baseball story and recognized fellow softball players Barbara Mandrell and Bill Anderson.\n\nWynette's contribution was \"Precious Memories,\" followed by Smith singing \"How Great Thou Art. \" During the service, an occasional clap was heard, but after Smith's performance, applause finally rang out. Laughter was often heard at some of the Twitty stories.\n\nThe final tribute was given by Oklahoma native McEntire.\n\nIn a shaky voice, she recalled working with Twitty and learning how to give 110 percent, because he did. She said she regretted never telling Twitty what he had done for her, so she stopped her tribute to publicly thank Mandrell and the Statler Brothers for their influence on her career before continuing.\n\n\"I used to open the show for Conway, I loved to hear Conway close the show,\" McEntire said. \"I'm not ready for Conway to close the show. \" \"Take it away, Conway,\" she added.\n\nEmery introduced Twitty's recording of \"Why Me, Lord,\" and dismissed the congregation. No one moved. At the end of the song, the audience stood and paid a final tribute to the man who had 55 No. 1 records.\n\nAs Twitty's recording of \"Why Me, Lord\" finished, another ovation broke out.
