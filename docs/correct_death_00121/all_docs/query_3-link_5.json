        "text": "Conway Twitty (born September 1, 1933, Friars Point, Mississippi, U.S.—died June 5, 1993, Springfield, Missouri, U.S.) was an American singer who started as a successful songwriter and rockabilly performer but later became an even bigger country music star, using his rich, tremulous baritone to specialize in country ballads.\n\nTwitty was drawn to music as a child but initially envisioned a career as a baseball player. However, following military service in the Korean War, he headed to Memphis to become a rockabilly musician. He struck gold with the 1958 pop recording \"It’s Only Make Believe\" and not only had other hits but also appeared in such teen movies as Platinum High School (1960). However, his first love remained country music, and, when his star began to wane in the early 1960s, he reinvented his image.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nTwitty, backed up by the Lonely Blue Boys and, later, the Twitty Birds, eventually scored more than 50 number one hits on the country charts. He was known for his lost-love classics and for his steamy love lyrics; his hits included \"Tight Fittin’ Jeans,\" \"Hello Darlin’,\" \"You’ve Never Been This Far Before,\" and \"After All the Good Is Gone.\" During the early 1970s Twitty teamed up with Loretta Lynn, and the two produced a string of duets, notably \"Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\" and \"After the Fire Is Gone,\" which won them a 1971 Grammy Award. They also won the Country Music Association’s vocal duo award for four consecutive years (1972–75)."
