        "text": "BransonâsÂ Conway RememberedÂ features an incredible performance by Mike Walker, whose uncanny tribute makes this show truly memorable! Â The late Conway Twitty, a Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter, thrilled country and pop music fans alike with his dozens of chart-topping hits, like âHello, Darlinâ,â âTight Fittinâ Jeans,â âAfter All the Good is Gone,â âI Canât See Me Without You,â and âAfter the Fire is Gone.â Â His first huge hit landed in the top spot on the pop charts in 1958; âItâs Only Make Believeâ had music fans everywhere thinking it was Elvis Presley singing the popular song! Â Twittyâs last concert performance found him in Branson; sadly, he passed away during that fateful visit, creating a very special bond between the country music superstar and Americaâs biggest live show destination. Â\n\nIn addition to Conway Twittyâs Grammy Awards, he was blessed with numerous other industry accolades, including awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, both as a single artist, and in duets with the queen of country, Loretta Lynn. Â With such an astonishing history of hit music, this iconic artist isnât an easy one to portray, but Mike Walker'sÂ Conway RememberedÂ appears to channel the spirit of Conway Twitty in all his musical glory.\n\nHelpful Hints/Additional Information\n\nYou can see Conway Remembered at Hughes Brothers Theatre.\n\nThe theatre is located at 3425 West 76 Country Boulevard.\n\nConway Remembered is family-friendly and appropriate for all ages - children 12 and under are free.\n\nThe Hughes Brothers Theatre has a gift shop and concession area in the lobby.
