        "text": "Not a ‘Bobby’ or a ‘Johnny’ – but a Twitty!\n\nConway Twitty was born and raised in the South and became the most successful rocker to convert to country of all time.\n\nTwitty was born on September 1st, 1933 in Friars Point Mississippi Harold Lloyd Jenkins. The Jenkins family would head off to Arkansas where young Jenkins at the age of 10 formed a country-oriented combo called “The County Ramblers”.\n\nAt age twelve he hosted a local radio program on Saturday mornings. As were so many others, Jenkins was captivated by Elvis Presley and so he headed to Memphis to consult with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips – seeking advice and guidance. Not sure if he was successful but we do know that Harold didn’t record in the famed studio.\n\nAccording to legend, Harold changed his name to a more memorable one – taking the names of two towns he observed on a road map – Conway, Arkansas and Twitty, Texas! The character “Conrad Birdie” derived his name from Harold (played by Jesse Pearson).\n\nIn 1957, Twitty landed a Mercury Records contract which result in two minor charting records. Next, he moved onto MGM Records. A DJ who was told to spin the record “I’ll Try” fortunately elected to play the other side “It’s Only Make Believe”. The song started slow but then began a constant climb on the charts culminating in Twitty’s first and only number 1 pop/rock flavored recording. Twitty;’s backing band was called “The Lonely Blue Boys” naturally.\n\nConway Twitty was definitely not a pop “Bobby”, “Billy”, “Johnny” or even a “Fabian” – He had a rougher edge and he set himself somewhat apart from the pop males of the day by composing many of his own tracks. He was cruising right along for a time, hitting the charts with regularity but not setting the charts on fire.\n\nThen, around 1965, Conway decided to take a stab at country music – something he always wanted to do. Initially DJ’s ignored Conway’s efforts not wanting to acknowledge a rocker among their ranks – but then he broke through in 1966 with “Guess My Eyes Were Bigger” his second effort after signing on with Decca Records – a label solidly anchored in Nashville. This would be Conway’s debut Country success (number 18) but was a mere shadow of what was to follow. (Three of Conway’s earlier rock releases managed to dent the R&B charts.)\n\nFour more moderate country hits would follow landing in the middle of the charts and then came the big breakthrough first with “The Image of Me”\n\nexploding at number 5 in March of 1968 followed a few months later by his first Country top song – “Next In Line” both composed in full or in part by writer Wayne Kemp.\n\nConway went on to place a total of 98 songs on the charts – most of them Country – with an incredible 40 number 1’s! This earned him the title as the “Top Country Artist” in the 1970’s, the number 2 Country Artists in the 1980’s and the number 5 ranked country artist of all time behind Eddy Arnold (#1 – 21 number 1’s), George Jones (#2 -13 number 1’s), George Strait (#3 – 43 number 1’s ) and Johnny Cash (number 4 – 13 number 1’s).\n\nBeginning in 1971 Conway teamed up with Loretta Lynn to chart 14 times with five going number 1 and all of them going Top Ten.\n\nConway definitely found his niche – steamy – sultry – country songs – And changing labels (Elektra – Warner Bros.) didn’t mark the end as was so often the case – number 1’s just kept rolling in.\n\nIn case you are wondering, the top ranked female country artists is Dolly Parton (number 7), followed by Reba McEntire (number 11) and Loretta Lynn (number 20). The top country groups are Alabama (number 16), the Statler Brothers (number 44) and the Oak Ridge Boys (number 56).\n\nTwitty’s personal life was a bit rocky marrying four times – twice to one lady.\n\nConway was appearing live with Jim Stafford in Branson on June 4, 1993 when he suddenly collapsed on stage. The next morning on June 5th, Harold Jenkins passed away leaving behind a great country and rock legacy.
