        "text": "Conway Twitty was a role model for fellow performers and an idol to his fans, a tearful Reba McEntire recalled Wednesday at a memorial service for the country music legend.\n\n\"I loved the roar of the crowd when Conway went on stage,\" McEntire said. \"I'm not ready for Conway to close the show yet.\"\n\nMcEntire and some of the other biggest names in country music were among 2,000 friends, fans and family members who crowded into the First Baptist Church in this Nashville suburb for the service.\n\nTwitty, 59, who had more than 50 No. 1 records, died Saturday in a hospital in Springfield, Mo., after a blood vessel burst in his abdomen. Private funeral services were Sunday.\n\nMcEntire recalled that she made concert tours with Twitty early in her singing career and learned much from him.\n\n\"He'll always be a legend in my heart and my mind. If I can be one-fourth the role model to some little kid that Conway was to me, I'll be thrilled.\"\n\nCountry star Vince Gill, who sang harmony on Twitty's records 10 years ago, said Twitty liked to tease him about their work together in the mid-1980s.\n\n\"Even after I did okay and had hits, he called me his \"little harmony singer,'\n\n\" Gill said.\n\nHarold Reid of the Statler Brothers said Twitty had a rare gift of thoughtfulness.\n\n\"He was the kind of guy that the minute you turned your back on him, he'd say something nice about you,\" Reid said as several mourners sobbed softly.\n\nAmong others paying their respects were Garth Brooks, Barbara Mandrell, Mickey Gilley, Tammy Wynette, Naomi Judd, Little Jimmy Dickens and the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nIn a recording career of more than 30 years, Twitty had hits such as It's Only Make Believe, Hello Darlin', Linda on My Mind, Tight Fittin' Jeans and Slow Hand. He was known for his trademark growl-like singing voice and throbbing ballads that often were sexually suggestive.\n\nTwitty had more No. 1 hits than any performer in any field of music. According to The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, the Beatles had 20 and Elvis Presley 18. Twitty started in the 1950s as a rock 'n' roll singer, but switched to country music in the 1960s."
