The Republic of Kievan Rus (Ukranian: Київська Русь) (pronounced, kɪɛvæn rus) (in-game: "KievanRus", formerly: "Dinkraine") is a faction created by DinksterDaily. It is located in Ukraine (including Crimea), (some territories of Moldova, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia?), the Sea of Azov, and Northwestern Caucasus. It borders Pogland to the north, Bosnia to the southwest, and the Corvarian Empire to the southeast.

The previous name "Dinkraine" is a portmanteau of the German Dinkster and romanized Ukraine.

The capital of Kievan Rus is located in the city of Sevastopol on the disputed Crimean Peninsula.

Dinkster has built the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and the "Slav Squat" statue.

While the shape of the faction mostly resembles the borders or real life Ukraine, the proportions are very off, as KievanRus claims land up to the Vistula (real life Poland) and owns most of Slovakia, as well as claiming territory around USSR and Poyo. This includes parts of the Urals and the Caucasus.

Dinkster has said that his faction will be a democratic republic, even though real Kievan Rus had always been a monarchy.
