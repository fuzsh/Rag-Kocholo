        "text": "The Franks\n\nThe Franks, a Germanic ethnic group, emerged from the lower reaches of the Rhine River. During the period of mass migration, they migrated into Gaul, where they successfully established a kingdom of considerable magnitude and influence in Europe subsequent to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. The zenith of their impact was witnessed under the reign of Charlemagne (742-814), whose rule played a pivotal role in shaping the course of Europe during the Middle Ages and beyond.The Roman conquest of Gaul, which was successfully carried out by Julius Caesar during the 1st century BCE, established the Rhine River as the definitive boundary of the Roman world. Consequently, the river assumed the role of a political demarcation line between 'civilization' (namely, Rome) and the 'barbaric' Germans who resided beyond its banks. In the Roman perception, these Germans were commonly depicted as being tall, fair-haired, unclean, and predisposed to acts of violence. Over the course of several centuries, the Roman legions stationed along the Rhine frontier effectively deterred the incursions of the Germanic tribes, until the gradual erosion of Roman authority, exemplified by events such as the Crisis of the Third Century, facilitated the infiltration of certain Germanic peoples into Roman territory. There exist various accounts regarding the origins of the Franks. The historian Gregory of Tours, writing in the 6th century, posits that the Franks originated in Pannonia and subsequently migrated to the Rhineland before settling in Thuringia and Belgium. In contrast, the Chronicle of Fredegar and the Liber Historiae Francorum, both of which are of uncertain authorship, offer more legendary accounts that trace Frankish origins back to the Trojan War. According to these myths, King Priam led 12,000 Trojan refugees to Pannonia, where they established the city of Sicambria. Some remained there, while others followed a leader named Francio to the Rhine, where they became known as the 'Franks'. The connection to Troy was likely an attempt by the Franks to establish a lineage on par with that of the Romans, who also claimed descent from the Trojans. While this origin story is undoubtedly mythical, some contemporary scholars, such as Ian Wood, contend that there is little evidence to support the notion that the Franks undertook any significant migration and instead propose that they originated in the Rhineland. During the reign of King Clovis I (r. 481-511), the Franks underwent a well-known conversion to Christianity. Prior to this, however, it is believed that they adhered to a form of ancient Germanic paganism. This particular belief system was characterized by a pantheon of multiple deities, each of which was associated with specific local cult centers. Additionally, forests were considered to be sacred spaces within this mythology. Prior to their unification, each Frankish tribe adhered to its own distinct set of laws, which were orally transmitted and recited by a designated law speaker. However, during the reign of Clovis between 507 and 511, a comprehensive civil law code was formulated to govern the newly established Frankish kingdom. This legal code, known as Salic Law, derived its name from the influential Salian tribe. Primarily composed in Latin, Salic Law primarily addressed matters pertaining to inheritance and criminal justice, thereby serving as a foundational framework for subsequent legal systems across Europe. Subsequently, another Frankish law code, known as the Ripuarian Law, was compiled circa 630, coinciding with the ascendance of the Ripuarians within the Kingdom of Austrasia. The Franks were initially recognized by a contemporary Roman source in 289 CE, although it is likely that the Franks had been involved in conflicts with the Romans for several decades prior. A Roman marching song from the 260s mentions the unfortunate deaths of many Franks, while archaeological evidence suggests that the Franks began their attacks on Roman Gaul as early as the 250s. By the end of the 3rd century, the Franks had launched multiple invasions into Roman territory, utilizing both land and sea strategies. Historical records indicate that Frankish pirates ventured into the Mediterranean, conducting raids as far as North Africa. In 486, Clovis initiated his conquest of Gaul by defeating Syagrius, the final major Roman official in Gaul, and capturing the city of Soissons. Utilizing this power base, he launched campaigns against the Alemanni, the Burgundians, and the Visigoths, thereby expanding Frankish influence throughout Gaul and Aquitaine. Clovis' conversion to Nicene Christianity (Catholicism) in approximately 496 marked the beginning of the gradual Christianization of the Franks. This conversion was significant in establishing Frankish Gaul as a stronghold for Catholicism, as opposed to Arianism, a competing Christian sect that was favored by other barbarian kingdoms. In the latter part of his reign, Clovis ruthlessly annexed the other Frankish kingdoms and executed their leaders, thereby unifying the Franks as a single people for the first time. At the time of his death in 511, Clovis reigned as \"King of All the Franks\" and held dominion over all of Gaul, with the exception of Burgundy, Provence, and Septimania. Following the passing of Clovis, the Merovingian kingdom underwent a division among his four sons, which may have set a precedent for future successions. Initially, the sons worked collaboratively to build upon their father's conquests, successfully expanding their territory by conquering Burgundy, Provence, and Thuringia in the 530s. Additionally, the sons of Clovis campaigned against the Visigoths in northern Spain, sent armies into Italy, expanded Frankish influence into Bavaria, and secured an annual tribute of 500 cows from the Saxons. With the passing of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in 526, the Merovingian kingdom emerged as the largest and most powerful barbarian successor state to have replaced Rome in western Europe. Despite their achievements, the Merovingian rulers frequently engaged in conflicts and consistently sought ways to undermine and conspire against one another. In the year 558, Chlothar I, the youngest son of Clovis and reigning from 511 to 561, emerged as the triumphant figure. This victory came after enduring decades of rivalry with his siblings, which involved the heinous acts of murdering his nephews and executing his own son. By outliving his brothers and inheriting their territories, Chlothar I successfully reunited the Frankish kingdom under his sole authority. Regrettably, his reign was short-lived, lasting less than three years before his demise in 561. Consequently, the kingdom was once again divided among his four sons, leading to the formation of three distinct Merovingian realms: Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy. The demise of Chlothar I instigated a fresh wave of machinations, internal conflicts, and targeted killings, driven by the intense rivalry between Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia (l. c. 543-613) and Queen Fredegund of Neustria (d. 597). This protracted confrontation endured for several decades and escalated into proxy wars waged by the offspring and descendants of these queens, until its culmination in 613 when Queen Brunhilda was ultimately vanquished and executed by King Chlothar II (r. 584-629), who happened to be the son of Fredegund. Chlothar II successfully reunited Francia and assumed the prestigious title of \"King of All the Franks,\" yet his triumph came at a considerable cost. In order to consolidate his position, he was compelled to make substantial concessions to the nobility. The 614 Edict of Paris formalized the customary privileges of the aristocracy and decentralized authority, placing it in the hands of regional elites. Dagobert I, the son of Chlothar II, reigned as the final Merovingian monarch to exercise substantial royal power during his tenure from 623 to 639. Despite the Merovingian dynasty's continued reign for over a century following Dagobert's demise, their authority gradually waned as the mayors of the palace emerged as the de facto powers behind the throne. The decline of Merovingian influence prompted the chronicler Einhard to label subsequent Merovingian rulers as \"rois fainéants\" or \"idle kings\". In the year 687, the Kingdom of Austrasia achieved a significant victory over Neustria and Burgundy at the Battle of Tetry, thereby establishing itself as the predominant kingdom in Francia. This triumph resulted in an increase in power for the esteemed aristocratic family, commonly referred to as the Pippinids or the Arnulfings, who had long served as mayors of the palace of Austrasia since the reign of Dagobert I. Despite their newfound influence over the entire realm of Francia, the Pippinids did not seek to claim the throne for themselves, instead choosing to govern through their Merovingian puppets. The Franks, at that time, were not yet willing to accept any other dynasty to rule over them. However, this sentiment would eventually shift following the dynamic reign of Charles Martel (l. c. 688-741), a member of the Pippinid clan who assumed the position of mayor of the palace of Austrasia in 715. Charles, the great leader of the Franks, achieved a momentous victory over the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours in 732. This triumph solidified his position as the de facto ruler of Francia, showcasing his exceptional prowess and strategic brilliance. By 737, Charles' personal influence had grown to such an extent that he no longer felt the need to appoint a new ruler after the death of his puppet king, Theuderic IV. The throne remained vacant, a testament to Charles' unrivaled power and authority, until his own demise in 741."
