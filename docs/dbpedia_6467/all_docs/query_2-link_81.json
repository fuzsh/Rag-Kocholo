        "text": "Middle Ages - C3C Scenario - Succession Game series\n\nRBC13D - Kievan Rus\n\nSee the general thread for rules, but nothing special\n\nbeyond the usual RB list of non-exploits. (Dastardly non-exploits\n\nare fine, as typical, with one worker per civ thru turn 50)\n\nWe'll be doing this one on Demigod, with a goal that should make for a\n\nvery fun and a delightfully brutal game - we'll be going explicity for a\n\nConquest Victory. That means we will have to wipe out 17 nations!\n\nWe're Commercial and Religious, led by Royal Majesty Murik. AI Aggression Normal.\n\nWe know: Norse Tradition, Masonry, Alphabet, and Mysticism.\n\nNorse Tradition gives our Berzerks, 70 shields, 6.2.1, amphib assault. They rock!\n\nSeafaring gives Longboats, 3.2.6 and capacity 4, enough for... an army. They rock!\n\nSmithing gives a Blacksmith which is a 100 shield factory! They rock!\n\nViking Sagas opens a wonder which is a combo of +2 Magellan and Heroic Epic. It rocks!\n\nWould we ever want another tree? We might actually - as we never get an 'aqueduct'\n\nByzantine flavor leads to Aqueduct and Cataphract (4.3.2), and a Spy with see-invisible.\n\nWest church gives Monastary(+50% sci), Knights (5.3.2), Crusader (4.3.1). Not so great.\n\nArab flavor gives library, Ansar (5.2.3!), Assasin (5.1.1+stealth), Sipahi(6.3.3), aqueduct.\n\nThe Arab tree seems our best second addition, if we want to pick one up. We can (must)\n\nself-research the first one in a flavor, and can trade for later ones. Much later in\n\ngame, next age gives Swiss Mercs (3.5.1) and some other so-so bldgs and units.\n\nWe're in the \"Viking\" age and need *two* required techs to get out into the next age,\n\n\"The Crusades\", where Arab learning, Western Church, and Map Making are available.\n\nOnly 4 required techs there, then the high middle ages has many techs open to all.\n\nNote \"Sheriff's Office\" with Divine Right costs 240 shields but is a courthouse, a bank,\n\ntemple and a half-factory all rolled into one! The courthouse equivalent, imporant\n\nfor our civ, is the Town Hall, available with Code of Laws. The Magna Carta wonder, late\n\nin game, gives a Town Hall in every city. The Great Wonders almost all seem nice, but\n\nI don't know which if any we'll want to build. Given that we'll be assaulting every single\n\ncapital in the game, I would tend to say \"none - capture wonders.\"\n\nIt's Mass Regicide, so each nation gets 3 King units, and if they die, so dies the\n\nwhole nation. The best (only?) way for us to win without winning on VP or letting\n\nsomeone else win will be to take out those kings specifically, and not get into\n\nlong drawn out wars all around.\n\nThe year is 843 AD, our setup includes 4 zerks, 2 swords, 5 workers, 1 settler, no boats.\n\nKiev (size 2): Vladimir, 2 zerks, 2 workers, rax, market. Needs a temple badly!\n\nNovgorod(1): Oleg the Wise, zerk, worker. *60% corruption!* Temple and market.\n\nVitebsk(1): Mstislav. Zerk, worker, no bldgs. 33% corrupt.\n\nYaroslavl(1): A worker. Nearby is a sword. No bldgs. 33% corrupt.\n\nOne settler with a sword in a very good spot, halfway between Kiev and Novgorod.\n\nWe are *not* on the coast and will want to get a decent coastal city before too long\n\n(but no huge rush, as a sneak attack by other Vikings would lose it )\n\nThe Swedes are partly up on the coast past Novgorod. Such a city will be corrupt.\n\nDid I mention we're in Monarchy, where we will stay the whole game?\n\nStrategic thoughts\n\n- The Vikings 'start' the strongest but don't have as much to look forward to compared\n\nto other civs. Time is on the side of the Arabs, as the Sipahi is the uber unit of the\n\ngame, plus Ansars and Assasins, and they have to defend, not crusade.\n\n- Once in the next age, research Arab learning and go down that path by trading.\n\n- Thus it would make sense to go clockwise perhaps? Turks first before they get any\n\nserious units, then Fatmids before they have a monster stack defending Jerusalem,\n\ncontinue around after Fatamids. Then with longbows and Zerks in place, wipe out our\n\nViking brothers by same-turn amphib attacks by zerks/longboats, and finally our\n\nneighboring Europeans, when we've got our own Knights or Siphai, rolling East to West.\n\n- Our 'ideal' setup would be 3-6 armies, some Berzerks and some Cataphracts\n\n(EDIT - had Sipahi here, but only Turks can build), so that not only\n\nour losses will be minimal, but also our VP's. These armies can march up unhindered to\n\nopposing king-cities, and take them out quickly, then rinse-repeat on next civ.\n\n- We're NOT militaristic, so leaders won't be as easy as other recent SG games.\n\n- I've compiled a list of king's starting-cities, to be posted later.\n\nDiscussion questions for our team:\n\n- Long term approach to conquest?\n\n- Any specific early focus?\n\n- When to take to the sea?\n\n- Dense-ish builds, as we'll never have more than size 12, most perhaps size 6.\n\nAlso, since goal is conquest, not domination, don't waste effort holding cities.\n\nRoster: (room for a fifth, but only a committed strong player please)\n\nCharis\n\nJabah\n\nGrimjack\n\nAkots\n\nThanks, and good luck all!\n\nCharis\n\nI've already posted in the main thread that city names are weird sometimes. After looking at some maps of Russia 9th through 14th centurty, the following list would be more appropriate:\n\nKiev - already built\n\nNovgorod - already built\n\nVitebsk - already built\n\nPskov\n\nYaroslavl - already built, needs ' in the end\n\nMurom\n\nRostov\n\nPereyaslavl- Zalessky\n\nPolotsk\n\nSuzdal'\n\nVladimir\n\nSmolensk\n\nRyazan'\n\nTurov\n\nVolyn\n\nLadoga\n\nLyubech\n\nIzborsk\n\nMoscow\n\nTver\n\nPosition of the current settler would more or less fit with Smolensk if founded on the spot. IMHO, if the players can just rename the cities when they are built according to that list... Did not want to ask too much.\n\nAlso, there is a king Oleg the Wise???? This is very weird mistake. Either Yaroslav the Wise or simply Oleg.\n\nMGL list is more or less fine but SGL list is weird with\n\nNicolai Lobachevsky - lived in 19th century (?)\n\nVladimir Zworykin - American (!) invented TV (?)\n\nMikhail Lomonosov - lived in 18th century (?)\n\nHowever, unlike cities, this would be impossible to make right. Just in case we get one, please rename if possible to Nestor (historian), or Andrei Rublev (artist and inventor).\n\nGame plan. Looks fine. However, I think Sipahi can be built only by Turks. Not sure about Ansars but looks like they can be only built by Cordova, Fatimid, and Abbasids. We can get only cataphract which is a mediocre unit with reasonable defence value. Not sure about dromon. It has 4 transport capacity but so is the longship. Also, dromons are slow (movement 4) but have lethal sea bombard. Overall, Byzantine tree looks more tempting IMHO.\n\nAnother problem is that getting out of Black Sea requires Constantinople to be captured and well as another city near it (Nicea, if I remeber correctly). Northern route is risky and Russia did not go through it till late 17th - early 18th century because of Sweden which is difficult to reach and hence get rid of. May be they will let us build a Baltic port city in time to change the history. Going in circles from Turks to Abbasids is an option also but this is a very long way. The map is huge indeed.\n\nBerserk armies would be great. May be 5 or 6 or 7 are needed overal. To make them more powerful, HRE would be great to capture and may be one of the targets after it is built?\n\nIt might be also a good idea to have no or little RoP agreements even with remote civs. There is no reason why we might need them. They have to die anyhow. In case of RoP, they all would rush with their settlers to the east to build there. They would rush anyhow so it may be a good idea to settle everything there to grab the land and increase free unit support. However, it is not a very fertile area and corruption would be tremendous even with commercial trait.\n\nEarly wars with Turks is certainly an option because they can get way too powerful later in the game. And in terms of money making opportunites, contacts and Map Making can provide for a huge income boost.\n\nThanks all for checking in! First turn will be heavy on exploration, fog busting (using kings, as suggested, then brought home for MP duty), making contacts, and just getting our cities up and running.\n\nAs seen in other Viking threads, the time of Viking domination is *NOW*, and we REALLY will want to press this hard before others get Knights and good units. With defenders of str 2 we will chew them up and spit them out\n\nAt least the ensuing early GA will not be despotic\n\nI hope to get started tonight, soon if not.\n\nQuestions - some may get answered over next few turns when we have more info, but any thoughts on these questions now or later would be good...\n\n- Just *HOW* early a war, and which foe?\n\n- Turks early sounds good. Abassids right after them before they get too much into turtling, and with better units?\n\n- Cataphracts seems great for us eventually. You guys weren't suggesting catapults were you? When it's 6 on 2, that's a major waste of 20 shields imho for our game\n\n- How many more cities to try to settle before going to war?\n\n- In general, are we going to try to hold a bunch of cities and expand into a big empire as we conquest, or stay fairly small and rely on a fewer number of excellent cities pumping zerks and cataphracts along with our armies to go on a capital razing quest?\n\n- Grimjack asked: \"We have four zerks and two swords at start. Would that be enough for a quick rush at a close neighbour?\" imho that's enough to eradicate two tribes, but that's just me! Which close neighbor?\n\n- I too would expect to expand in the direction of our capital, but there are two reasons we would not - i) if we have a definite first foe in mind, expanding in that direction is excellent. ii) if we have a very definite second weakish foe in mind, and he wants to settle extensively south of Kiev, that would save us many settlers\n\n- How much are we going to be getting into using the seas, and into fighting our \"Viking brothers?\" They're so bloodthirsty I'm not too upset we have no coastal cities If they land and THEN try to attack us, then the 6 vs 2 goes OUR way and they'll be repelled.\n\nThanks,\n\nCharis"
