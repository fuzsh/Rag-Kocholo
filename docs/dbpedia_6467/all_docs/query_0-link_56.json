        "text": "In addition to its current status as the largest country in the world be present borders, Russia has previously held other territories across Eastern Europe through union or conquest. The Kievan Rus’ emerged as a state during the ninth century, laying the foundations for the area now known as Russia. The decline of Kievan Rus’ from the eleventh century onwards saw the emergence of several successor states. The Tsardom of Russia emerged in 1547 and continued until the establishment of the Russian Empire in 1721. Monarchical rule in Russia ended with the 1917 Russian Revolution.\n\nThis list includes monarchs who ruled Russia and surrounding geopolities that at times were under Russian control before the Russian Revolution, therefore there may be overlap with other Eastern European countries who came under its authority in the premodern era.\n\nCheck out some of these Russian rulers below!\n\nOlga (c. 890/925-969)\n\nElizabeth Petrovna (1709-1762)\n\nCatherine the Great (1729-1796)\n\nAlexandra Fyodorovna (1872-1918)\n\nBibliography\n\nBeem, Charles.
