        "text": "An overview of the Time of Troubles, with a focus on the interplay between Church and State and their evolving relationship over the course of the period.\n\nThe 1888 commemoration of the 900th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus’ in Kiev constitutes one of the great performances of Alexander III’s scenario of power. Participants gathered to celebrate St. Vladimir’s choice of Orthodox Christianity and the significance of Kiev in the Russian land. There on the empire’s periphery, they confronted the complex relationship between Kievan Rus’, Holy Rus’, the Russian nation, and the Russian Empire. The nationalizing idiom of Alexander III’s scenario of power sought to smooth out difference and forge a common, monologic myth, yet that scenario could not work without the all-Russian nation, which by definition implied difference.\n\nThere are a number of people and funding agencies that I would like to thank. I owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. John-Paul Himka. His talk at the University of Northern British Columbia challenged my assumptions of nation and nationhood and inspired me to do this work. Dr. Himka comments were invaluable to my writing of this article. Likewise, Dr. Oleg Kharkhordin was instrumental in my completing this paper. His comments and his expertise was greatly appreciated. Dr. James McDonald, Chair of Anthropology at UNBC and Sarah ...\n\nIn this paper, I seek to demonstrate the history of Paganism in Rus’ and the process by which it was exposed and converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity through providing both primary and secondary sources that shed light on the aforementioned questions. Section one discusses the Pagan practices and beliefs found in Rus’ before its conversion. Section two of this paper will demonstrate how Byzantine Christianity entered into and had an influence on the Russian culture of the 10th century. In sum, Russia transitioned from Paganism to Christianity in the 10th century by influence of Christian Byzantium which altered Russian culture forever.\n\nThis paper focuses on the people and religions that predated the first true Russian state, Kievan Russia. Although it has been generally accepted that Russian history began with the Varangians, current Russian historical authority includes the early tribes as an integral part of Russia’s heritage. These tribes and their religions include the Avars, Magyars, Slavs, Varangians, Byzantines, Kagans, Islamic Arabs, and Islamic Bulgars. The thesis for this paper is the following: The final religious choice by the Princes of Kiev was based not primarily on religious zeal but on political and economic expediency. This portion includes Chapters 1 and 2, covering the Avars, Magyars, Slavs, and Bulgars. The rest will be uploaded in the near future."
