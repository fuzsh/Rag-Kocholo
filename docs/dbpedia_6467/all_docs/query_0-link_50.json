The Monarchy of Kyivan Rus’ have since 987 supporting the Christian religion.\n\nRus' culture\n\nThe Monarchy is a national symbol, as much as other parts are. In this way the Monarchy is as much part of the Ukrainian culture as the Tryzub.\n\nImpartiality\n\nNo politician is liked by the entire nation. The Monarch is above ideology, and as such can be an impartial mediator and a symbol of unity."
