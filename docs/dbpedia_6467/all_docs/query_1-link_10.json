In Muscovy of the 16th and 17th centuries, the boyars formed the highest rank of the aristocracy, and had the right to advise the tsar in a duma, or advisory group.\n\nCap of Monomakh: According to tradition, the Byzantine emperor presented this crown to Grand Prince Vladimir of Kiev (r. 1113-25). The Cap of Monomakh has come to symbolize the Russian throne and its historic links to the religious and cultural traditions of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nCaucasus: The Caucasus mountains form an almost solid rampart extending northwest to southeast across the isthmus between the Black and Caspian seas.\n\nChurch Slavonic: The oldest literary language of the Slavs, employed in the first translations of ecclesiastical writings from Greek to Slavic in the second half of the 9th century.\n\nConstantinople: In 330 C.E., the ancient city of Byzantium was proclaimed the capital of the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Empire, and renamed by Emperor Constantine the Great. In 1453, the city and what remained of the empire fell to Ottoman invaders. The city was renamed Istanbul.\n\nCossack (pl. Cossacks): A privileged peasant soldier in tsarist Russia, preeminently a member of the cavalry and horse artillery. Prior to the 18th century, Cossacks were runaway peasants and others who had fled to the steppe region between the Dniepr and Don rivers and formed free, self-governing communes organized along military lines. The Cossack population constituted a separate class or estate in the Russian Empire.\n\nCrimean Khanate: A realm in the Crimea that detached from the Golden Horde in the 15th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Khanate often invaded Russian territory. The Khanate was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire until the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74, and became part of the Russian Empire in 1783.\n\nDecembrists: Members of secret revolutionary societies whose activities led to the uprising of December 1825 against Tsar Nicholas I (r. 1825-55). These groups consisted of officers who advocated either a republic or a constitutional monarchy. On the death of Alexander I, they persuaded several regiments to refuse loyalty to Nicholas in favor of his elder brother Constantine, who they believed would grant a constitution.

Before adopting the title of Tsar in 1547, the rulers of Muscovy also used this title.\n\nHoly Alliance: The name given to a 19th-century organization that provided collective security for Europe after the Napoleonic wars.

They tortured and murdered suspected traitors, robbing and pillaging their victims’ property.\n\nOttomans: A Turkic-speaking people who by 1400 had managed to extend their influence over much of Anatolia and even into Byzantine territory, as well as Macedonia and Bulgaria.

Territory was expanded, including at the expense of Muscovite Russia in the Far East.\n\nRaskol’: A Russian term meaning “schism,” and here specifically concerning the split between the official Russian church and church dissenters who broke away in the second half of the 17th century over reforms to the traditional services and texts. The dissenters were expelled from the official church as heretics.\n\nRomanov Dynasty: The House of Romanov, an old boyar family, was elected in 1613 to serve as Russia’s second ruling dynasty, after the end of the Rurikid dynasty.
