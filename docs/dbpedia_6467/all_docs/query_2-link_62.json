        "text": "How Vladimir the Great created modern Russia, as told by me.\n\nIf you recall our story from last week about Olga of Kyiv (and her never ending revenge plots), you’ll remember she later was the first pagan Slav to convert to Orthodox Christianity.\n\nHer grandson Vladimir later converted the entire Kievan Rus basically overnight. Much the way the Slavic tribes were united by inviting a common ruler, Rurik (a Viking who began the first Russian dynasty), monotheism was invited by Vladimir to further solidify the Kievan Rus as a people.\n\nThe Rurik dynasty, by the way, ended 7 centuries later when Ivan the Terrible murdered his eldest son, and the only heir fit to rule. After over a decade of panic called the Times of Trouble, the Romanovs were eventually elected (becoming the second and last monarchy of dynastic Russia)\n\nSo, Vladimir sends some emissaries to go check out the Vatican, head of Roman Catholicism; Constantinople, capital of Orthodox Christianity; as well as some representatives from the Bulgarian Muslim and Jewish population. He ended up with some pros and cons:\n\nCons: Jews get circumcised, Catholic churches are boring, Muslims can’t drink."
