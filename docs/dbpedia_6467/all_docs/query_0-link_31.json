        "text": "Prince of Novgorod\n\nBox/Folder item 1/1 1\n\nRurik, 830?-879\n\nAccording to the 12th-century \"Primary Chronicle,\" Rurik was a Varangian chieftain of the Rus' people who gained control of Ladoga in 862 and built the Holmgard settlement near Novgorod. He was the founder of the Rurik Dynasty and reigned from 862-879.\n\nGrand Princes and Dukes of Kiev\n\nOleg, the Grand Duke of Kiev, was Rurik's successor and he moved the capital to Kiev, founding the state of Kievan Rus', a territory covering what is now parts of Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus. Over the next several centuries, the most important titles were those of the Grand Prince of Kiev and Grand Prince of Novgorod whose holder (often the same person) could claim power over all the areas.\n\nBox/Folder item 1/1 2\n\nOleg, Grand Duke of Kiev, 855?-912\n\nAlso known as Oleg of Novgorod, he was a Varangian prince who seized control of Kiev from Askold, a prince of Kiev, laying the foundation of the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. He reigned from 882-912.\n\n1/1 3\n\nIgor', Grand Duke of Kiev, 878?-945\n\nAlso known as Igor I, he was a Varangian and the son of Rurik, the first ruler of Rus'. Due to his excesive greed in collecting tributes from the Drevlians, they killed him in 945. There is controversy about when he reigned, some sources citing that he reigned from 913?-945, while others cite from 941-945.\n\n1/1 4\n\nOlga, Grand Duchess of Kiev, Saint, 890?-969?\n\nAlso known as Saint Olga and Saint Helga, she is known for her obliteration of the Drevlians, a tribe that killed her husband Igor, the Grand Duke of Kiev in 945. Their son, Sviatoslav Igorevich was only 3 years old when his father Igor I died, and she reigned as regent of Kievan Rus' for her son until he was 15 years old from 945 until 960. Her efforts to spread Christianity through the Rus’ earned Olga veneration as a saint. She also changed the system of tribute gathering (poliudie) in the first legal reform recorded in Eastern Europe.\n\n1/1 5\n\nSviatoslav Igorevich, Grand Duke of Kiev, 942?-972?\n\nAlso known as Sviatoslav I of Kiev, he is famous for his persistent campaigns in the east and south. His efforts precipitated the collapse of two great powers of Eastern Europe: Khazaria and the First Bulgarian Empire; and creating the largest state in Europe. Although he died at age 30, he accomplished much in the last decade of his life. After his death, his conquests were not consolidated into a functioning empire and no stable succession existed, causing a fratricidal feud among his three sons.\n\n1/1 6\n\nVladimir, Grand Duke of Kiev, 956?-1015?\n\nAlso known as Vladimir the Great and Saint Vladimir, he was the natural and the youngest son of Sviatoslav Igorevich who designated him ruler of Novgorod, and he gave Kiev to Yaropolk, his legitimate son. After Sviatoslav's death, a fratricidal war erupted in 976 between Yaropolk and his younger brother Oleg, ruler of the Drevlians and ultimately, both men were killed, leaving Vladimir ruler of Kievan Rus' from 980 to 1015.\n\n1/1 7\n\nIaroslav, Grand Duke of Kiev, 978-1054\n\nAlso know as Iaroslav the Wise, he was grand prince of Novgorod and Kiev three separate times, and united the two principalities for a time.

He was restored as a tzar of Kiev from 1155 to 1157.\n\nGrand Princes of Vladimir\n\nBy the early 11th century the Rus' state had fragmented into a series of petty warring principalities. In1097, the Council of Liubech brought together Rus' princes and resulted in the division of Kievan Rus' among the princes, effectively establishing a feudal system.
