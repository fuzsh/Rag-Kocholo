        "text": "The Duchess of Edinburgh has become the first member of the Royal Family to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion.\n\nOn Monday she went on a one-day visit, on behalf of the Foreign Office, to \"demonstrate solidarity with the women, men and children impacted by the war\".\n\nThe duchess paid her respects to those who had lost their lives in the town of Bucha during the Russian occupation.\n\nThere was also a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Royal Family has been unusually outspoken in its support of Ukraine, with King Charles marking the second anniversary of the invasion in February by warning of the \"indescribable aggression\" and the \"unprovoked attack\" by Russia.\n\nOn his state visits to France and Germany the King had spoken of the importance of supporting Ukraine - and the sympathies of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, had been suggested when she appeared beside a big bowl of flowers in Ukrainian national colours.\n\nBut up to now none of the royals had come to Ukraine during the war, until this surprise visit by Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, who is married to Prince Edward, the King's youngest brother.\n\nDuring her trip Sophie talked to survivors of sexual violence and torture, and at an evening reception at the residence of the UK ambassador to Ukraine, Martin Harris, spoke about her experience meeting survivors in other countries marred by conflict.\n\n\"Women and girls pay the highest price in terms of human costs,\" she said, adding: \"Rape is used to demean, to degrade and to destroy.\"\n\nSophie also heard from children who had been returned to Ukraine after being forcibly separated from their families and visited a bridge which was blown up to stop Russian soldiers advancing on Kyiv.\n\nIn her meeting with President Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska, the duchess gave them a private message from King Charles and discussed support for survivors of sexual violence in conflicts.\n\nThe duchess has been a supporter of the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative - and Queen Camilla recently spoke of the importance of preventing the sexual violence that all too often takes place in war zones.\n\nThis unexpected visit is a symbolic message of royal support for Ukraine. Soon after the start of the war in 2022, Charles, then Prince of Wales, visited Ukrainian refugees who had come across the border into Romania.\n\nPrince William also visited British troops in Poland near to the Ukrainian border.\n\nThe royals also appeared to have become embroiled in the disinformation war - with the British Embassy in Russia having to say that claims that the King had died were fake news.\n\nSecurity researchers also warned that social media conspiracy theories about the Princess of Wales were being amplified by Russian disinformation networks.\n\nBut Sophie has gone a step further with her visit into Ukraine. It adds to her list of trips to places not usually visited by the royals."
