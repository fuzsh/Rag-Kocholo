        "text": "How can there be a Ukrainian Royal Family when Ukraine is a republic?\n\nA family is considered royal when its founder or one of the past heads was a reigning monarch and doesn’t cease to be royal if the country where it reigned becomes a republic. Bulgaria, Serbia, Portugal, Italy, and Romania, to name a few, are all republics where royal families still exist.\n\nIf the Ukrainian Royal Family exists, why have I never heard of it?\n\nThe reason for this lies in hundreds of years of suppression of Ukrainian monarchist traditions, first by the Russian Empire, then by the Soviet Union. Headed by the House of Romanov, the Russian Empire for obvious reasons didn’t want to remind the world that the descendants of another Rus’ monarchy still exist, while the Soviet Union was opposed to the concept of monarchy altogether.\n\nHow legitimate is your claim? Didn’t the Rurik dynasty die with Vasili IV?\n\nTo answer this question we must understand that a royal family, once established, may never go extinct. When a monarch leaves no offspring their throne and title are inherited by the closest relative (usually a sibling or a nephew, depending on succession laws) and so on; this is how the lineage to the British throne may have up to 1385 members. While it’s true that a direct male descendant of Rurik doesn’t exist, the princely title he once had may not disappear as long as at least one his descendant is alive. To find the entire family tree of the Ukrainian Royal Family, please refer to the respective page.\n\nGenealogy\n\nShouldn't the Royal House have been regnant at the time of the Congress of Vienna in order to be recognized?\n\nThis is indeed a common misconception among some monarchists, however it has no base in reality, as there are both current (Belgium) and former (Greece, Italy, Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania) European monarchies established after the Congress of Vienna. The last time a monarchy was proclaimed in Europe was less than 100 years ago (the Kingdom of Albania in 1928), and there is no reason why it can't be proclaimed today.\n\nAre you advocating an overthrow of the republic and restoration of monarchy?\n\nWhile the Ukrainian Royal Family certainly advocates monarchism, we acknowledge that modern-day Ukraine has more pressing issues than changing the foundation of the constitutional order, and oppose any violent acts in violation of the Ukrainian constitution and laws. We see the restoration of the monarchy in Ukraine as the end goal that can only be achieved through public advocacy, with respect for Ukrainian laws and in line with the wishes of citizens. In the meantime, our mission is to promote Ukrainian and Rus’ monarchist traditions, and campaign for establishing a legal status for the Ukrainian royalty and nobility.\n\nHow is monarchy relevant in the 21 century? There are plenty of developed countries that are republics.\n\nIt’s certainly true that many republics are good countries to live in. However, if we look at statistics, the advantages of monarchy become fairly obvious. Only 44 sovereign states out of approximately 200 that exist have a monarch as Head of State; however, 18 out of 30 richest countries by GDP (PPP) per capita are monarchies. The 11 European monarchies that exist (without the Holy See) top the ranks in median income, healthcare, quality of infrastructure, life expectancy, and government cleanliness. For comparison, the examples of Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and even of our neighbor to the East clearly showed that whenever a monarchy is deposed, it’s replaced by a brutal dictatorship, and it takes decades if not hundreds of years for a country to return to normalcy if return at all. Finally, even countries traditionally regarded as the strongholds of democracy often have elements of monarchism: San Marino, the oldest republic in the world, still has recognized nobility (even though new titles aren’t granted anymore); Switzerland has nobility as well. The United States has a de facto aristocracy, known as the old money, that can be considered nobility in all but name.\n\nDo you support the European integration of Ukraine (EU and NATO membership)?\n\nUkraine has been a member of the European family for hundreds of years. Ukrainian history is part of European history, and our Western neighbors are the countries most similar to Ukraine in terms of culture, mentality, and traditions. At the same time, taking a stance on political issues is traditionally outside the role of a monarch, who serves as the impartial arbiter for all citizens. It is for the same reason that Queen Elizabeth II never delivered her opinion on Brexit or Scottish independence.\n\nWhat are your views on the ongoing since 2014 conflict?\n\nThe relations between Ukraine and Russia don’t currently exist, and can’t exist until a permanent peace is achieved. An agreement, should it ever be reached, must guarantee the territorial integrity and sovereignty, which are not for sale and can’t be compromised no matter what.\n\nWhat is your position regarding the Romanov family?\n\nWhile we respect the right of Russians to have a monarchy should they desire so, and condemn the establishment of the USSR and the barbaric execution of the Imperial Family, we categorically reject any implication that Ukraine should be under Russian sovereignty, or under the sovereignty of the House of Romanov.\n\nWhy are you using the Julian calendar and Anno Mundi?\n\nThis was the calendar used by Medieval Rus', our ceremonial usage of the Julian calendar and Anno Mundi is an homage to this practice."
