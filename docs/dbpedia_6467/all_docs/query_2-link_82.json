        "text": "Yaroslav the Wise looks like a good place to start - have him create a Western European system of power transferring from father to son and you can eliminate some of the problems; create Russian equivalent of European royalty and let those who aren't int he main line become royals in some way. Eitehr that or have an elected system like the Holy Roman Empire. I'm not sure who to have influence him in that direction, but as a general rule, civil wars tend to be bad for a country's stability.\n\nAfter that, avoiding the fourth crusade might help, though Constantinople was declining some before, I think, as a trade route.\n\nHow the Koevan Russ could survive to this day? How strong could it be?\n\nKievan Rus in a narrow sense of the term (confederation with the most senior principality being one of Kiev) was too exposed to the Steppe and the traditional trade route North-South by the Dnieper was dying thus hitting it economically. However, if you mean just “Rurikid empire” regardless it’s center, then there a transition from the exposed Southern center of gravity to a more secure one in the Central Russia, Vladimir. Except for that, the ruling dynasty remained the same all the way to 1610 when the last Rurikid Tsar, Vasily IV Shuisky, was deposed.\n\nHow the Koevan Russ could survive to this day? How strong could it be?\n\nWell, as with anything pertaining to Kievan Ruś, things are not as clear-cut as they seem, even with the narrow sense of the term. Traditionally, in the West, we have assumed that the progression as stated in Russian history is normative, but there were other ways of making it work, such as a surviving Lithuania not united with Poland (Lithuania contained much Kievan Ruśian territory at one point, and even Slavonic was used as the chancery language at Vilnius). Another is a surviving Halych Kingdom which could be used to bring back much of what we now call Ukraine and Bielaruś (Belarus) under its control, creating a unique Ruthene identity in the process separate from developments in Muscovy. It would also help if the Kievan Patriarchate never moved north and remained close by. It's not going to cover the whole of Kievan Ruś - that's impossible - but it could preserve a nucleus of the way things used to be in a more compact area. It's also not going to necessarily be the Riurikid dynasty but a Riurikid dynasty by other means, by descent through Roman Mstyslavych the Great and Daniel Romanovych Halićkyi. As strange as it sounds, it also just might work, at least for the south and keeping the core areas together."
