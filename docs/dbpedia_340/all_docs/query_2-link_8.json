        "text": "1 Silent Cinema: The Beginning of Film Form (1895 – 1928)\n\nFilm history begins well before the invention of the motion picture camera. To understand how and why the film industry has grown to become the primary mode of artistic expression in the world, we must first carefully trace the path of early cinema, which developed the movie standards that we use today. Cinema storytelling became standardized remarkably quickly – within the first two decades of its existence. The rules by which we make film today are more or less these same rules, which were developed out of industry competition, global wars, audience reception, and incorporation of radical art movements. These historical influences on the film industry in its early stages developed a sturdy film form.\n\nThe first element in this film form is the technical aspect of watching moving images. Cinema does not literally show us movement, but it does show us a fast succession of still images. The origin of cinema lies in our need for this illusion of motion and the subsequent industry race to create a movie camera capable of recording and projecting images for the viewing pleasure of its audience. This movie camera would have a light source to capture a series of images composed of ‘frames’ onto a flexible, and reproducible celluloid. The cinema apparatus would also need a projecting medium to create the illusion of motion by playing these frames back at a specified speed or frame rate (the number of frames per second). In this way, cinema can be thought of as still images set into motion, and thus the story of cinema also becomes the story of animation, of photography, and the development of other technologies. While the movie screen appears as a seamless flow of images, it is in fact dark part of the time. The optical phenomenon known as ‘persistence of vision’ and its counterpart, the phi phenomenon — the mental act of suturing the gaps between frames or images – aids in the appearance of a constantly lit screen and the continuity of the image. Before the advent of photography, many early optical devices exploited the specialized way in which humans process light to trick the eye into conceiving motion.\n\nPre-cinematic technologies (6th c – 1980)\n\nThere were many different pre-cinematic devices using light sources to project images that paved the way for cinema— from the camera obscura as early as the 6th century to the magic lantern in the 18th century. The camera obscura, also often known as a pinhole camera, was basically a box with a hole on its side that reproduced a naturally occurring optical illusion. Light from an image set in front of the camera obscura passes through the hole, reproducing and inverting the image within the opposite surface inside the pinhole camera. The magic lantern, on the other hand, was one of the earliest projectors of images onto a ‘screen’ or wall. It used a concave mirror to project light from a light source through a rectangular sheet of glass or paper containing the image to be screened. A lens at the front of the lantern would then focus the image.\n\nThe 18th century also saw the appearance of phantasmagoria: a type of horror exhibition chiefly produced through the magic lantern that projected images of demons and skeletons onto walls, smoke, and transparent curtains to frighten its audiences. From its inception the pre-cinematic device operated as a medium of light and film, introducing ideas of phantasms or ghosts embedded within the very structure of the medium. The idea of ghosts in film introduces a defining way in which cinema began to be imagined as a tool to represent or re-imagine and interpret reality. In light of the phantasmagoria, we see one of the earliest aims of the cinematic device as entertainment. The first films of cinema, though, would provide a document or archive of the ghosts of the past, from the people, places and events that were recorded onto celluloid.\n\nThe invention of photography (1820s -1880s) and other pre-cinematic effects such as the zoetrope (1834) in the 19th century brought about a seismic shift in the possibilities of the cinematic apparatus. Photography in particular brought the celluloid technology to make images not only reproducible but also more accessible to the masses. During the mid-1800s to the 1880s two men, English professional photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) and French physiologist Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904), were using photography to study the locomotion (movement) of humans and animals. Both men aided in the evolution of motion photography by developing breakthrough camera techniques that set individual images into motion. Muybridge used dozens of cameras to capture motion across separate negatives placed in sequence to each other. In 1879 Muybridge projected these still images in rapid succession onto a screen for the first time from an invention he called the zoopraxiscope, an important predecessor of modern cinema. Muybridge can thus be credited with creating some of the first moving pictures. His contemporary Marey used chronophotography to depict movement through multiple exposures onto a single photographic plate. Marey designed a camera called the fusil photographique or “photographic gun”, which allowed the user to take individual shots rapidly. As one of the earliest camera devices to record sequential movements, Marey’s photographic gun was one of the many important steps towards a fully functioning movie camera. Muybridge and Marey’s experiments into chronophotography— still photographs that recorded movement—are understood as laying the foundation of cinematography.\n\nWhile Muybridge and Marey set the template for moving pictures, the need for a cinematic device capable of recording movement instantaneously grew. This early movie camera also had to be portable, allowing budding filmmakers and film exhibitors ease of travel, access, and exhibition. In 1889, American entrepreneur George Eastman engineered celluloid ‘roll film’ which became the industry standard. Prior to Eastman’s more durable and flexible emulsion-based celluloid, paper sensitive film and glass plates were the norm for experiments in photography and movement. The crucial invention of celluloid technology would allow for the filming of longer subjects, and the easy transfer and exchange of films. All that remained to achieve cinema, as we know it, was the rapid development of the movie camera apparatus. The rise of the technology, which lead to the creation of the first movie cameras, occurred akin to an arms race, where the desire to create a recording and projecting medium, which set images to motion, was also tied up in the financial possibilities of cinema.\n\nAn interesting figure during this time in film history is Frenchman Louis Le Prince, who lies at the center of an enduring mystery that has never been solved. Le Prince worked in England and is credited with shooting what may have been the first moving picture sequences as early as 1888. In 1890, at the eve of his first public demonstration, he mysteriously disappeared with all his patent applications allowing other inventors to outpace him and be attributed with the invention of cinema. While Le Prince’s work arguably did not influence the commercial development of cinema due to the secrecy around it, his presence sets up an argument for the first films emerging in England, Leeds, rather than that long held thought the cinema began in America and France.\n\nEdison, Kinetoscope, and Lumière Brothers (1891 – 1895)\n\nCinema technologies were invented in different countries at different times, but the earliest date has been set at 1891, with the American inventor Thomas Edison’s Kinetograph camera and Kinetoscope viewing box: a type of peep show device, activated by putting a coin in the slot. Edison’s assistant, W. K. L. Dickson is credited with much of the work patented by Edison and was key to the formation of the first machines capable of recording and screening moving images. But it would be Dickson’s four-hole-perforation of 35mm Eastman roll film that would change the course of film history. These perforations on either side of a film frame permitted the film to be pulled by gears through both the camera and viewing apparatus and would become the standard in the industry. Edison built a studio called the Black Maria (pronounced ‘Mar-iah’) in New Jersey, named after its resemblance to the cramped black police wagons that transported criminals, to create numerous shorts such as Fred Ott’s Sneeze (1894), the first movie to be copyrighted in the United States, Annette Dances (1894), The Boxing Cats (1894), one of the earliest forms of the cat video now popularized on the internet today, and The Kiss (1896). The stage was set for the film industry in the United States to be born on the East Coast, and more specifically in New Jersey.\n\nMany of Edison’s earliest films were filmed by William Heise and Dickson, two of the most prolific filmmakers marking the beginnings of cinema. These early films produced within the Black Maria were characterized by black backgrounds and sunlight from the studio’s roof, which opened to allow for natural lighting. Because recording these films required a bright light source, Edison had the revolutionary studio built on a revolving track to follow the movement of the sun for optimal lighting throughout the day. These continuous one-shot films were often short, no more than around 20 seconds in length, with a fixed frame that kept the audience at a distance, as observers of life. Edison’s films ran the gamut from comedic to intimate snapshots of life, often featuring notorious figures like Annie Oakley and other people and places of note. In seeking to document reality these first films eventually began to introduce the idea of cinema as more than just pictures that move, but rather moving pictures that told a story.\n\nBy 1894 Edison had Kinetoscope parlors across the U.S. and Europe. Each machine, though, could serve only one audience member at a time, since it could only fit one set of eyes in the peephole, and was limited to exhibiting a single short film. Although popular, the Kinetoscope’s days were numbered by the continued race by inventors to discover a commercially viable way to project films to large groups of spectators. Germans Max and Emil Skladanowsky, for example, developed the Bioscop movie camera and projector in 1895, which utilized two strips of film rather than the standard 35mm single strip film. They are credited with projecting a program of their own films to a paying audience in Berlin almost two months before the Lumière Brothers’ famous first film-projection for a public audience at the Grand Café in December 1895 Paris. In 1895, Dickson also left the employment of Edison to partner with inventor Herman Casler, Henry Norton Marvin and Elias Koopman in the American Mutoscope Company, which by 1908 would become the Biograph Company. Dickson and Casler would invent the Mutoscope, a type of flip-card peep show device that would provide direct competition as a cheaper alternative to Edison’s Kinetoscope. By 1896, Dickson and his partners would launch their own Biograph camera and projector in their continued attempt to wrest control of the American film market from Edison’s monopoly.\n\nAlthough the Edison camera was patented as the first motion picture camera, the official birth of cinema is often considered to be 1895 with the Lumière Brothers who successfully were both able to record a series of images on a flexible, transparent medium (35 mm nitrate-based celluloid film) as well as project the sequence in a system accessible to the commercial growth of cinema domestically and internationally.\n\nInspired by the Kinetoscope, in 1895 Frenchmen Louis and Auguste Lumière debuted the groundbreaking Cinématographe. The Cinématographe operated as a recording camera, printer or developer of the filmed images, and projector, while also being small and portable, making it the first all-in-one commercially viable film camera. Importantly, the machine used a slower exposure rate of 16 frames per second, a rate that would become the standard international film speed, as compared to Edison’s application of 46 frames per second to his cinema apparatus. Using the Cinématographe, the Lumières filmed their factory workers leaving at the end of the day. The resultant film, Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory (1895) is considered to be the very first motion picture made with this innovative machinery. By the time of the Lumières’ celebrated first film screenings for a paying audience at a café in Paris, the Lumières had a program of ten films that met with wide public acclaim and economic success. These films allowed a glimpse into early documenting of everyday life from August Lumière and his wife feeding their baby, to the arrival of a train, and men playing cards. Others showed early comedic skits like a young boy tricking a gardener into spraying himself with a hose by stepping on it.\n\nLike Edison’s first films, the Lumière Brothers’ first films were single moving scenarios taken in one shot, composed like a photograph or painting, and short in length, usually under a minute long. The Lumière films, though, were marked by their ability to easily take their camera to the streets, resulting in on-location shooting, and films composed of simple settings and narratives that often focused on nature or everyday people. By 1896 trained cameramen and projectionists were sent across the globe with the Cinématographe to find new subject matter to shoot, and to show their films to new, appreciative audiences, thus launching the beginning of film history in many other nations.\n\nThe Actualites: Cinema as realism\n\nThese earliest films created in the 1890s revealed an awareness of an audience and sought to create something amusing or actual for their entertainment. In this way, most of the films were non-fiction or actualities, what might be considered an early antecedent of the documentary, that presented real settings and events for audience viewership. Some actualities, such as the traveling actualities where the camera is attached to a vehicle, provided the first examples of camera movement in cinema. For instance, Canadian James H. White’s Panoramic View of the Champs Elysees (1900), made for the Edison company, presents its mobile view from what appears to be a horse-drawn carriage. Films of foreign lands and news reels also constitute actuality films. The fiction film, especially the simple comedy, was also an important genre for these early films.\n\nEarly films had no introductory titles, credits or intertitles, which contributed to the loss of many of these films in the annals of film history. Many films consisted of a variety of shorts from different directors spliced together in a reel without individual identification, and maybe stored in someone’s home, office or studio. Although most early films of the 1890s consisted of a single continuous shot, some filmmakers filmed different shots of the same subject which could then be screened separately, spliced into other shorts, or run all together creating a type of multiple shot film dependent on the needs of the exhibitor. The exhibitors of these early films were the first editors because they often had the sole power to decide which shorts would be shown in a reel to audiences and in which order.\n\nBy the end of the 1890s, films were becoming longer and exhibiting multiple shots, requiring producers and directors to begin exploring new ways of telling stories through early forays into editing. Though these early films are now called “silent films”, they were not silent at all. In fact, these first films were typically accompanied by some type of live or recorded music. Pianists, musicians, and sometimes whole orchestras would play sheet music or improvise for movie audiences. Many also used phonographs to provide music for their film shorts, especially Edison in his Kinetoscope parlors.\n\nWith the demand for film as entertainment, many other film studios rose to provide competition with new cameras and movies to take hold of the budding industry within their respective countries. In France, for example, Pathé Frères was founded in 1896 and by the early 1900s became the largest vertically integrated film company in the world. They would create the lightweight Pathé camera, based on the patented Lumière design in the early 1900s, which would dominate the global industry well into the end of the 1910s. Gaumont Film Company, founded by inventor Léon Gaumont, produced their first films in 1897 and quickly became the chief rivals of Pathé Frères. Alice Guy-Blaché, the industry’s first female director, quickly rose through the ranks in Gaumont’s company to become the Head of Production from 1897 to 1907 directing the host of the company’s popular actualities. Between 1910 and 1914, Guy-Blaché was the first woman to own her own studio plant, The Solax Company Studios — the largest pre-Hollywood studio in America — in Flushing, New York from where she directed and produced hundreds more shorts and eventually feature length films. From Italy, to Denmark and Japan, film industries and cultures thrived, opening the door to new ways of understanding cinema as a product not just of realism but of fantasy and storytelling.\n\nIn 1896, the Lumière Brothers screened the now infamous fifty-second film L’Arrivée d’un train en gare de la Ciotat (Arrival of the Train at La Ciotat Station) to Parisian audiences. The film showed the everyday scene of a train pulling into a station and passengers boarding and disembarking. Despite the familiarity of these actions, audiences reacted with fear and delight at seeing this mundane scene captured on film. One founding myth of cinema is that audiences ducked their heads when the train approached the screen’s limits, as though it would burst out of the wall to hit them. This famous anecdote of spectators running, screaming from the sight of an approaching train has taken on the status of urban legend and has been undermined by many critical film scholars.\n\nIt is easy to hear this urban legend and assume that early spectators had a childlike relationship with the screen, where they were unaware of the artificiality of movies and took the images too literally. But film scholars disagree with this assessment of early cinema goers. Tom Gunning sets forth a concept of a ‘cinema of attractions’. It can be difficult as students of cinema to see where the attraction lies in these first black and white early film shorts containing little plot, movement or stylistic development. The idea of early cinema as a ‘cinema of attractions’ considers how new experiences of space and time in modernity (technological revolution, railway developments, electrical and communication systems, the new automobile, the increase of a global society) and the shock of an emerging modern visual culture affects the way in which these early spectators perceived the screen.\n\nRather than laughing at the naiveté of these first spectators who ‘believed’ what they saw on screen, as students of cinema we can think about why might the spectator have been affected by the technology of this new medium. For Gunning, the basic aesthetic of early cinema was the visual shock rather than narrative. The early cinema spectator were thrill seekers, standing their ground in the face of a rapidly approaching train, not helpless naïve children. They delighted in the imaginary threat of the train. Of early cinema, one of the most popular genres were films of approaching vehicles, suggesting that spectators were attracted to the visual shock of cinema, rather than a blind terror.\n\nThere is an awareness of the audience in these films that actively attempt to visually startle. In L’Arrivée d’un train en gare de la Ciotat, for example, even though the camera itself does not move for the length of the film, it is deliberately positioned so that the tracks approach it at a diagonal. This framing causes shifts in shot size based on the train’s movement alone — from long shot, to medium to close-up. The camera angle creates dynamic shot that increases the tension of the everyday train pulling into a station and creates the thrilling sensation of a train racing towards its audience. These early films posit an understanding of cinema as astonishing spectacle that holds the ability to fascinate audiences.\n\nGeorges Méliès: Cinema and the magic tradition\n\nGeorges Méliès is considered by many to be one of the most important filmmakers in the early years of cinema because he shifted away from the moving photographs of Edison and the actualities of the Lumières towards story and narrative expression. He was exceedingly successful both in France and internationally during his career, and he was often imitated or illegally pirated by filmmakers like Thomas Edison who was resentful at the competition in the market. Because he controlled all aspects of his film production – screenwriting, directing, acting, producing, and distribution – many today consider Méliès to be the first auteur of cinema.\n\nMéliès was present that historic day in 1985 when the Lumière Brothers stunned audiences in Paris with their Cinématographe and its program of films. Inspired, but unable to purchase the machine from the brothers, Méliès procured his own camera-projector from British inventor Robert W. Paul, and small film studio called the Star Film Company. In 1896, Méliès soon began screening his own films to audiences. Initially one-shot reel films of no longer than a minute, Méliès’ early films quickly became marked by his use of special effects or magic tricks, which popularized multiple exposures, dissolves, stop motion and split screen photography among other techniques in cinema.\n\nIn Un Homme de tete (The Four Troublesome Heads, 1898) Méliès enters the frame and proceeds to remove his head placing it on a table. Every time a new head appears on his shoulders, the director removes it until four identical Méliès heads interact with each other—three on the table, and one on his shoulders in a technically impressive early use of multiple exposures. Méliès’ take on Cinderella, Cendrillon (1899), similarly provided one of the earliest uses of dissolves, and was the director’s first use of lavishly designed multiple scenes to tell a story in cinema. Méliès’ cinema was distinct and influential in its ornate stage design, which drew the spectacle of the theatre into motion pictures. The magical illusion of his camera presented elaborate stories in ways that were impossible in live theatre and startlingly new to the medium of the screen. Méliès would often appear in his films and use direct address with his audiences, creating a self-reflexivity that encouraged audience awareness of the camera and artificiality of the screen. Audiences were part of the magic trick or adventure on screen in this way.\n\nA Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904) remain two of the most influential early films of science fiction. The respective scenes of the space shuttle flying into the moon’s eye in A Trip to the Moon and the sun swallowing a flying train in The Impossible Voyage are still two of the most iconic images in film history. Méliès used his camera to embrace the air of scientific discovery and exploratory hope for the future that marked the time period. A Trip to the Moon was the first example of science fiction on film in its imagining of not just the journey from the earth to the moon, but the perspective of the earth from the moon. Important also to Méliès’ storytelling innovations was his use of linear editing to establish continuity between his shots to tell simple stories. Filmmakers across the globe were still figuring out how to tell a story through rudimentary editing that kept narrative clarity for audiences across space and time. Melies’ 11-minute A Trip to the Moon successfully kept its spatial and temporal logic from scene to scene, using editing to sequentially follow its characters on their journey to and from the moon.\n\nFor all his cinematic innovation, movement in Méliès’ films happened not through the camera, but through set design. His cinema of tricks mandated a very steady or fixed camera through which he could swap in other objects to create jump cuts, so his camera never moved, preventing him from experimenting with shot sizes and camera movement the way in which other filmmakers would. Early British films, especially, continued the Méliès magic tradition and were known for their special effects cinematography, for example, James Williamson’s The Big Swallow (1900) and Cecil Hepworth’s Explosion of a Motor Car (1900). Through these films you can begin to trace the begins of the editing tradition in early cinema. In The Big Swallow a man walks angrily towards the screen until his open mouth fills the camera view. Williamson invisibly cuts on the black interior of the character’s mouth to a black back drop into which a cinematographer and his camera falls, then back again to the now laughing and chewing face of the man to suggest that the angry man his swallowed the cameraman.\n\nAs the name suggests, Explosion of a Motor Car presents the spectacle of an exploding car that slowly scatters the body parts of the car’s passengers in a comedic and playful way. Hepworth’s film features one of the earliest uses of Méliès’ popularized stop motion effect to negotiate the shock of the modern experience with the presence of the rapidly developing technology of the automobile. By 1912, Méliès was considered old-fashioned due to changing film practices, and he became outpaced by his peers. Despite the global popularity and imitation of Méliès’ films and their special effects, the dominant form of cinema today is not one filled with tricks and fantasy, but rather of a narrative embedded in realism. The Pennsylvanian director, Edwin S. Porter, would be a key figure in encouraging this direction of modern storytelling. From the one-shot films of the Lumières to the tricks of Méliès to Edwin S. Porter, we see a steady development of cinema from dependency on technology to aesthetic play and towards greater realism.\n\nClassical storytelling and Classical Hollywood cinema\n\nOriginally a film projectionist and equipment expert, Edwin S. Porter quickly rose in the ranks of the Edison Manufacturing Company. Working with his future collaborator George S. Fleming, Edison would become a prolific cameraman and director for the majority of Edison films. In 1903 he directed two seminal American films, Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery, providing important forays into the use of continuity editing to deepen narrative in early cinema. A major problem for early filmmakers was the establishment of temporal continuity from one shot to the next. The films of Georges Méliès were especially influential to Porter in their lessons on storytelling through continuity across narrative time and space. A Trip to the Moon held a particular familiarity to Porter as he had illegally duplicated it for distribution by Edison in October 1902, allowing him a closer understanding of the mechanics of editing together a story for narrative clarity. The 6-minute film The Life of an American Fireman (produced in late 1902 and released in January 1903) grew out of this experiment with continuity.\n\nJames Williamson’s 5-minute British film, Fire! (1901), was one of the very first films to edit multiple shots together chronologically to create a cohesive narrative sequence. Although Fire! skillfully used editing to heighten the emotional tension of firefighters racing to rescue a family with a baby from a burning house fire, it struggled in its narrative clarity. The spectator is often confused about the proximity or distance of spaces from each other. The opening scene, for example, shows a police officer who has noticed a home on fire running off-screen for help and immediately arriving at a fire station. Subsequent shots, though, highlight the horse-drawn fire engines sprinting to the scene of the fire which now appears to be a distance away.\n\nInspired by Fire!’s technical skill and narrative, Porter created Life of an American Fireman (1903), a dramatized nine-shot narrative that combined multiple staged scenes of firemen coming to the rescue with actuality film of a real fire brigade. Porter’s film begins with a fireman thinking about his wife and daughter, one of the first films to feature a character’s inner thoughts and thereby humanize the figure of the fireman. Porter further deepens the audience investment in his film through one of the first uses of the close shot in early cinema. Fading in and out between images of the fireman thinking of his family to a close shot of someone pulling an alarm, and firemen reacting to the alarm, Porter displays an advanced use of continuity between shots that maintains a sense of temporal and narrative pacing and meaning across shots. His sophisticated attempts at continuity extend to sequenced shots of horse-drawn fire engines all going in one direction. Despite depending on wide, fixed shots to tell its story, Life of an American Fireman exploded into audience’s consciousness, taking what had been done before by disparate filmmakers to another level that made the popular genre of the firefighting film even more in demand. It would be with Porter’s next film, The Great Train Robbery, that the direction of cinema would firmly turn towards the realist narrative as its dominant form compared to the fantasy-driven narratives of Georges Méliès.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery remains Porter’s most famous and influential film to the development of classical storytelling in cinema. A story about a gang of bandits who hold up a train, Porter’s film is arguably the most popular film of the pre-1905 period and prompted many imitations. The Great Train Robbery tells its story in eleven shots, moving back and forth between scenes of a tied up telegraph operator, his discovery by town folk who mount a posse to apprehend the bandits, the anticipated train robbery, and shoot-out that leads to the bandits’ death in the end. Porter makes the device of editing central to his storytelling, with a film language focused on creating a sense of time passing between shots, while simultaneously stimulating audiences by cutting between different locations in the building of tension and drama. While there were other fiction films composed of multiple shots being created during the time period, The Great Train Robbery challenged the expectations of the frontally composed and theatrical films still being made by most filmmakers at the time. It displayed an unparalleled level of continuity of action, on-location shooting, and narrative clarity across shots that served to increase the realism of Porter’s film.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery ends on a shocking final insert of a bandit shooting his gun directly into the camera, in a breaking of the fourth wall, which shows its awareness of the spectating audience. This famous ending reverberates in modern cinema today in homages placed in films like Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990), the gun barrel sequence in the James Bond movies, and George P. Cosmatos’ Tombstone (1993) where characters fire their guns at the camera. Porter was one of several filmmakers across the globe whose work pushed forward the development of classical storytelling and editing during the era.\n\nThe 1905-1912 Nickelodeon boom created the moviegoer who now went to the movies as a habit. This explosion of permanent indoor exhibition spaces across the United States that were dedicated to screening motion pictures made huge profits from charging just a nickel for admission. With the demand for more films to screen to these habitual audiences, by 1906 early cinema began to be dominated by narrative storytelling necessitating the rapid development of a visual language of expression. It is within this era of the Nickelodeon boom that Biograph actor-turned-director, D.W. Griffith, would leave the company in 1913 to produce a body of infamous films that would change the face of modern visual storytelling. Learning from earlier films and his own experimentations, Griffith developed the rules of continuity editing at a scale never seen before in his most influential film The Birth of a Nation (1915). Griffith shot his scenes with multiple cameras to create a continuous flow of dramatic storytelling while maintaining continuity in space and time across his numerous cuts.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation was the highest-grossing film of the silent film era, but for all its innovative camera techniques and narrative achievements, it was also highly controversial and socially devastating. Griffith’s film tells the story of the American Civil War through a focus on two white families torn apart by the conflict and the threat of the freed slave. Three hours of racist propaganda, The Birth of a Nation starts with the Civil War and ends with the Ku Klux Klan riding in to save the South, and more specifically white women, from the uncivilized emancipated slaves. The origin of stereotypes like the loyal Uncle and Mammy characters became popularized through their prominently portrayal by white men in black face in these characters’ unwavering service towards their owners.\n\nIn contrast, the other slaves within the narrative are ruined through their freedom, having become violent, arrogant, and sexually aggressive. In the middle of the second act, Flora, a young white woman flees the unwanted attentions of Gus, a former slave turned Union soldier, who wants to marry her. Rather than be despoiled by a black man, she jumps off a cliff, leading her brother to form the Ku Klux Klan to avenge her death. In The Birth of a Nation, lynching is the tool suggested to exact vengeance and bring order to the land. Through filmmaking tools, Griffith creates sympathy for the white characters and demonizes black slaves as dangerous narrative elements to be destroyed. The editing cuts closer to Flora to set up character psychology that highlights her purity, and it cuts increasingly faster between Flora, Gus, and her brother, who desperately searches for her, to create drama and tension. Editing and a sweeping orchestral score is used in The Birth of a Nation to emotively portray the Ku Klux Klan as heroes and to position the audience on their side, in a revisionist history of America’s birth.\n\nAlthough Griffith is often incorrectly credited with introducing innovations such as cross-cutting, and the close-up, Griffith effectively used these techniques to show several competing lines of action, moving between different shot sizes and groups of characters, with a clarity of story that remains astounding for the 1910s. In the climax of The Birth of a Nation, Griffith displays a sophisticated use of parallel editing that builds tension and excitement in terms of emotional and narrative cues. Cutting between Klan members riding to the rescue, to a white family under siege in a small cabin by black soldiers gone mad with too much freedom, to Lillian Gish fighting for her virtue against the mulatto, Silas Lynch, Griffith cuts from full-figure shots to close-ups to accentuate the drama. In the little cabin, as a father prepares to kill his own daughter to save her from the bestiality of attacking black soldiers and characters desperately fight to hold off the horde, Griffith inserts a close-up of a child crying to further manipulate audience emotions. He consistently returns to the sight of the Klan as the white characters’ only hope and creates drama by shortening the shot lengths to accelerate the pace and deepen the emotional stakes. Though the content of Griffith’s film was immediately criticized by many viewers and has become a dark spot in film history, he has been revered for filmmaking techniques that effectively manipulate viewer emotions. Griffith’s mastery of crosscutting provided a foundation for narrative action and pacing in cinema, which underpins modern Hollywood cinema today.\n\nWhen The Birth of a Nation opened to audiences in 1915, it was met with standing ovations across the country by white audiences, but also the counter-pressure of massive protests organized by the NAACP (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) due to its dangerous misrepresentations and liberties taken in recounting history, which many American filmgoers at the time mistook as accurate. Griffith’s film singlehandedly aided in the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, who actively used The Birth of a Nation as a recruiting tool. While The Birth of a Nation is considered by many to be the foundation of modern Hollywood cinema, it is also representative of racism, white supremacy, and America’s history, and it cannot responsibly be understood separately from its politics and ideology. Understanding this connection between Hollywood’s foundations and the ideology that it perpetuates is important to historically orient Hollywood practices today, like whitewashing and the use of racist stereotypes. A criticism or study of Hollywood cinema today must take into consideration its beginnings rooted in Griffith’s sensational film.\n\nAfter the record-breaking success of Griffith’s three-hour The Birth of a Nation there was no going back. The multi-film reel or feature film became the norm. With longer films came other stylistic standards: more restrained acting style and the further development of character psychology, which would lead in turn to the emergence of the star system and fan magazine culture like Motion Picture Story Magazine (1911) and Photoplay (1911). The classical style of storytelling and editing evocatively showcased in Griffith’s film set in place the editing practices that still make up the basis of Hollywood cinema to this day. More recently Hollywood films have drawn from the troubled historical legacy of The Birth of a Nation to speak to contemporary concerns in America. In 2016 Nate Parker released The Birth of a Nation, which repurposed Griffith’s film title to challenge a white supremacist version of events and tell the story of the birth of America from the slave’s perspective. Although also marked with controversy, Parker’s film won numerous awards, and the distribution rights were bought for $17.5 million by Fox Searchlight Pictures, breaking the record for the largest amount paid to date for a Sundance Film Festival production. In Spike Lee’s 2018 film, BlacKkKlansman, referencing The Clansman, the original title of The Birth of a Nation, Klan leader David Duke screens Griffith’s film for the Colorado Springs chapter after a secret induction ceremony. Using audience awareness of The Birth of a Nation as the foundation of the American film industry, Lee’s film reengages Griffith’s in a satirical examination of race and politics in modern America.\n\nGriffith was only one of many directors creating feature length films during the silent film period important to the development of Classical Hollywood cinema. Mentored by Alice Guy-Blaché, Lois Weber was a prolific director, screenwriter, and highly recognized and sought after talent in Hollywood alongside D.W. Griffith. Unlike with D.W. Griffith, the course of film history has obscured Weber’s importance to silent cinema laying its creative trajectory chiefly at the feet of men. In Suspense (1913), a roughly 10-minute film in which a man, chased by police, steals a car in his haste to reach his remotely located home to save his wife and baby from a threatening tramp, Weber engages in superior editing to heighten the suspense and narrative clarity of her story. Using a variety of film techniques from a three-way split screen to introduce characters in order to explain space and location to the audience, to a key hole effect to create a close-up, and cut-ins to cut closer to the action, Weber produces an immersive experience for her film audience. In one startling moment, Weber places the spectator within the point of view shot of the young mother in peril as she peers from her upstairs bedroom window and meets the gaze of the tramp who looks straight into the tilted camera representing the shocked mother’s, and audience’s, gaze. Weber cleverly heightens the tension and emotion of her film through her manipulation of shot sizes and parallel cutting between the home invasion and the husband on his way, building upon the legacy of the rescue sequence that D.W. Griffith would display on the immense stage of The Birth of a Nation.\n\nOne of the early directors to create feature-length films in the 1910s, Lois Weber’s 1914 film, The Merchant of Venice, is widely considered to be the first American feature directed by a woman. In 1916, she would be the first, and only, woman elected to the Motion Picture Directors Association in honor of an oeuvre that addressed the social issues within her time and her own personal politics. In films like Hypocrites (1915), Where Are My Children? (1916) and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1917) she challenged the power and hypocrisy of religious institutions and issues of contraceptives and abortion, respectively.\n\nBy the end of the 1910s the feature film was a staple of Hollywood cinema, and the industry was steadily migrating to the West Coast to take advantage of the year-round sunlight and good weather crucial for outdoor filmmaking. Classical Hollywood narrative form informed a universal language of cinema that still remains the norm today. In other countries around the globe, directors began taking alternative approaches to telling stories visually that would continue to impact on the development of the medium through the rise of an international avant-garde cinema. This alternative to Hollywood narrative cinema would use its cinema to encourage new representations of reality, and to call forth a new cinema spectator."
