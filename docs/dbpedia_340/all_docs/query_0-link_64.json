        "text": "The second Maine Silent Film Festival is a two-day event blending comedy and drama at the historic Alamo Theatre in Bucksport with live accompaniment by Doug Protsik, focusing on rare and unusual films seldom screened theatrically. This yearâ€™s themes are films that were made here in Maine and a look at war films through time.\n\nWednesday, July 24th starting at 7:00pm\n\nMade in Maine\n\nThere are many silent films set in Maine but relatively few of them were actually shot here. This evening begins with two short comedies filmed on location in Maine and concludes with a feature drama not only filmed here but written by a Maine author and produced by a Maine-based studio.\n\nThursday, July 25th starting at 7:00pm\n\nAt War\n\nWhether comedy or drama, historical or contemporary, war has been a perennial topic in silent film. This evening is a chronological look at war films beginning with three short dramas and concluding with a First World War feature comedy.\n\n2024 Program"
