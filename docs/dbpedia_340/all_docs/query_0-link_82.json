        "text": "Timeline\n\nHistory of Motion Pictures\n\n1900-1909\n\nA Brief Overview of the Decade\n\nEven before Queen Victoria died in 1901, the first decade of the new century was already challenging the old assumptions and old philosophies of the Victorian Age. In 1900 Sigmund Freud published his book, “The Interpretation of Dreams”, which challenged the way people interpreted human motivations. Frank Lloyd Wright reinterpreted architecture; Max Planck introduced Quantum Physics; Albert Einstein introduced his Special Theory of Relativity; Isadora Duncan reinterpreted dance; and the painters Picasso and Braque introduced Cubism.\n\nThe Wright Brothers successfully flew their airplane in 1903, and by 1909 the French aviator, Louis Bleriot, became the first flyer to cross the English Channel. Marconi sent a wireless message more than 1800 miles across the Atlantic Ocean; Commander Peary made it to the North Pole; the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed; and Jack Johnson became the first black boxer to hold the Heavyweight Champion of the World title.\n\nAlthough many people were humming the hit song “In My Merry Oldsmobile” during the middle of the decade, by 1908 Henry Ford introduced the sturdy, inexpensive “Model T”, making it finally possible for the masses to own an automobile. Into this exciting mix “Nickelodeons” were introduced in 1905, an inexpensive outlet that allowed motion pictures to evolve from being a mere curiosity to become the entertainment of choice for the working classes. A little over two years later there were almost 9,000 Nickelodeons in operation in the U.S."
