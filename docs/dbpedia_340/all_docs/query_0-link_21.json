        "text": "The phenomenon of the star is, in many respects, emblematic of the workings of modern mass culture in its constant alternation between repetition and sensational exaggeration. Star personas may promise a reassuring familiarity, but since they are part of the mass-cultural universe, they are simultaneously subjected to the dynamic of continuous transformation and fictionalization. In the emerging star system, familiar figures never stay stable but are continuously updated, amended, and optimized with alternate and parallel versions, remakes, rewritings, and reinventions.1 [End Page 22]\n\nThe star is ready made and unique, and while stardom is no singularly cinematic phenomenon, the cinema at all stages reflected the latently paradoxical implications of this convergence of the standardized and the singular. In this article, I will explore the emergence of the cinematic star system in the 1910s against the backdrop of the broader entertainment industry and its stylized showcasing of performers, celebrities, and sensations. Movie stars epitomize the professionalization of the cinema as an institution and the conventionalization of filmic modes of address and affect management. At the same time, female stars tamper with the ways in which gender and sexuality are inscribed into the protocols of mass culture and contribute to more pervasive social negotiations of diversity and distinction.2 I argue that family relations—imageries of sisterhood and mother-daughter links—were prominently mobilized for these purposes. Sisters and mother-daughter constellations are enacted in the films of the 1910s as disturbing or delightful doubles, as alternative casts of one mold, and thus represent larger concerns around the mechanical reproduction of individual specificity and the recalcitrance of tradition against progress and change. Their representation dovetails with a pervasive remapping of temporality and modernity in gendered terms.3 Cinematic juxtapositions of simultaneity and sequence, of stagnation and acceleration, or of linearity and recursion serve to carve out ‘female’ temporalities that deviate from and strain against the larger regimes of space-time regulation unfolding across the social field in the course of technical, scientific, and industrial modernization.4 By and large, the changing conditions of modernity, especially in their reorganization of public-private relations and labor conditions, caused anxiety and stress. Particularly for white men, however, these changes also came with unprecedented affordances and options for self-invention. Other groups—including women, people of color, and the otherwise marginalized—needed to carve out possibilities and liberties for themselves in the spatiotemporal grid of modernity that competed with and contested the dominant white male model of success.5 The movies function as an index of these negotiations. [End Page 23]\n\nFocusing on the 1910s means exploring a period in which the cinema charted a separate space in a larger culture of entertainment, thereby emancipating itself for good from the compartmentalized aesthetic of the variety stage. This development was regarded as a sign of medial maturation by some critics—a sign that the cinema was coming into its own—while others associated the process with the loss of the very quality that had distinguished the medium to begin with. This latter stance was exemplarily voiced by Gilbert Seldes in 1922, when he lamented a sell-out of mass-cultural entertainment to shallow genteel sensibilities. He specifically attributed this loss of originality to the star system exemplified by the “Gishes and Talmadges and Swansons and other fatalities.”6 Seldes deplored the uncoupling of the movies from the popular arts and claimed that a new cinematic agenda of respectability that valorized character and personality was about to efface the older aesthetic of “action” and “effect” that had informed the most potent sites of popular artistic expression: the film serial, the slapstick film, and the burlesque.7\n\nLike all nostalgic reminiscences, Seldes’s conjures up an ideal that has more to do with the perceived shortcomings of the present than with the perfections of the past.8 As Lea Jacobs points out, Seldes’s latently gendered juxtaposition of an anarchic and vigorously masculine vernacular culture of the 1910s with a domesticized and feminized mass culture of the 1920s effaces the fact “that the enthusiasm for the sentimental and pathetic . . . was just as profound an aspect of popular taste as that for slapstick or burlesque.”9 In any case, it is ironic that two sister pairs—Lillian and Dorothy Gish and Norma and Constance Talmadge—whose careers started in the 1910s, head the list of Seldes’s new character actresses. Sister acts were, after all, very much a phenomenon that the 1910s and the 1920s had in common. For Seldes, however, the phenomenon of the star sisters served to emblematize the standardized star performance of his days.\n\nIndeed, cinematically “there has never been an era for sister acts like the 1920s,” as Jeanine Basinger points out.10 But at the same time, the cinematic siblings signal the mass-cultural entertainment practices of the past—particularly the variety stage and the one-reel melodrama—whose disappearance Seldes excoriated. These acts’ continuity across the decades indicates the persistence of sentimental affect, which was coded as feminine throughout the transitional era and far beyond. In their evocation of the sister acts that formed a staple piece of the 1910s performance cultures, the cinematic siblings prove to be complicatedly entangled in a longer history and do not, in fact, mark a distinct new phase. [End Page 24]\n\nIn what follows, I will explore the shared roots of theatrical and cinematic sister acts and star sisters in order to bring to the fore the aesthetic of doubling that underpinned popular female gender performances of the 1910s across the entertainment scene and mapped alternatives to contemporaneous cultural scripts of heterosexual love and marriage. I will then trace the ways in which cinematic enactments of female family relations were changing in the course of the decade, owing to new performance styles that increasingly emphasized psychological complexity and veracity. However, while a particular pattern of sibling stardom fell out of fashion by the 1920s, the aesthetic of doubling persisted well into that decade. The cinematic representations of mother-daughter relations later in the 1910s, like the sister acts at the beginning of the decade, serve to figure alternative routes for female life stories without expressing blatant resistance to the social status quo."
