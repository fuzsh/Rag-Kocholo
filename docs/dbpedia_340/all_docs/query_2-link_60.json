        "meta_description": "Tennessee Williams’ classic play The Glass Menagerie (1944) was an extension of the Expressionism that was then prevalent in mid-century Europe. The Expressionist Movement was marked by certain characteristics: a rejection of realism in favor of dreamlike states; non-linear, often disjointed structures; a utilization of imagery and symbolism in the place of naturalism; a focus on abstract concepts and ideas.",

Unifying features included rebellion against artistic and social conventions of the day, and bold innovation. The overall aim of expressionism was to offer a total spiritual renewal by confronting the darkest aspects of reality. The movement influenced a number of artists, writers, and poets around the world, including James Joyce and T.S. Eliot. Among them were 20th-century American writers who questioned widely-accepted beliefs. They opened new psychological and emotional dimensions within their works. In the 1920s, expressionism found an outlet on the American stage through experimentalists from the Theatre Guild and Provincetown Players such as Susan Glaspell and Eugene O’Neill. Starting in the 1940s Tennessee Williams adopted expressionist techniques and incorporated them through dialogue, action, sound, setting, stage design, and lighting into his dramatic works such as The Glass Menagerie (1944), A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), and Camino Real (1953).\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica’s entry on Production Aspects for Expressionist Theatre provides background context on the movement related to theatre.\n\nCertain theatrical techniques can be classified as expressionist. See Modern Theatre in Context: Expressionism from Canada Research Chair in Performance and Culture for a detailed description. A synopsis is noted below:\n\nDramatic characters are usually social or spiritual archetypes;\n\nSpace/time categories are symbolic and suggestive of abstract places such as \"the world,\" \"a church,\" \"a graveyard\";\n\nHighly visual staging involves atmospheric lighting to express the emotional nuances of the play and various expansion devices, (i.e. staircases) to make the stage space more suggestive and symbolic;\n\nNew style of acting rejects realistic communication in favor of expressive movements.\n\nTennessee Williams adopted such expressionistic techniques and integrated them into The Glass Menagerie as a way to present several of his themes. He used them to highlight reality as subjective, expose the dehumanization and grotesqueness effected by modern urban culture, and express the resulting angst over that condition. This drama is characterized by dreamlike states rather than realism, and imagery and symbolism rather than naturalism.\n\nFor more information on the Expressionist techniques of Tennessee Williams, click here (PDF).\n\nTennessee Williams’ oeuvre has always been difficult for critics to categorize. In the seven decades since The Glass Menagerie premiered on Broadway, this play has been diversely classified as idealist, naturalist, symbolic, poetic, and romantic, among others. Indeed, in this and other plays Williams often combines different elements in pursuit of what critic John Gassner calls “a fusion of naturalistic detail with symbolism and poetic sensibility.” According to drama critic Kenneth Tynan, Williams achieves a new kind of romanticism “not pale or scented but earthy and robust, the product of a mind vitally infected with the rhythms of human speech.” His subject is the often “terrifyingly ambiguous” human nature as he observed it—brilliantly rendered into dramatic form. Nancy Tischler sums it up:\n\nThis play, unique among Williams’ dramas, combines poetic and unrealistic techniques with grim naturalism to achieve a gossamer effect of compassion, fragility, and frustration typical of Tennessee Williams at his most sensitive and natural best.\n\nA detailed biography of this author’s life and work is available from the EDSITEment-reviewed Poetry Foundation, which offers myriad assessments of Tennessee Williams’s dramatic techniques by lead scholars and critics.\n\nEncourage students to cast, direct, stage, perform and/or film their expressionist scenes from the Summative Assessment. Then ask the class as a whole to identify and discuss the effects of expressionist form on the content.\n\nHave students represent a scene graphically—e.g., in a comic strip—to illustrate the interplay of form and content in a scene from The Glass Menagerie.\n\nHave students compare the following reviews from the first two productions of The Glass Menagerie in the 1940s with the reviews of the play from two productions mounted in 2013. Discuss how elements of expressionist techniques and theatrical devices used in each production may transcend or be influenced by the social milieu of that time.\n\nReviews of original productions:\n\nThe New York Times review of the play’s original 1944 production in Chicago;\n\nThe New York Times review of the play’s subsequent 1945 debut on Broadway.\n\nReviews of contemporary productions:\n\nThe review “Wounded by Broken Memories” of the 2013 Broadway production at the Booth Theater;\n\nThe review “The Shape of Memory, Both Fragile and Fierce” of the 2013 production at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nView one of the many films versions of the play and have students write a review of the film performance. Discuss the additional challenges and/or benefits of producing a film based on a stage-play.\n\nHave students read Tennessee Williams’ essay, “The Catastrophe of Success,” which describes the fallout of the overnight success of The Glass Menagerie. Then have them use the Launchpad to complete an analysis of this informational text."
