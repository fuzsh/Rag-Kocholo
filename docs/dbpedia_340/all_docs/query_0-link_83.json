        "text": "British Involvement\n\nBritain first pledged naval support in July 1950, then troops on the ground, with 27 Brigade (then based in Hong Kong) arriving in Korea in August 1950. After discussions during the first year of the war, British forces became part of the 1st Commonwealth Division, formed in July 1951.\n\nBritish military personnel were involved in fighting throughout the war, often in very harsh conditions. Among its most well-known battles was the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951, where the 29th Brigade – famously the 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment – attempted to halt advancing Chinese forces. There were heavy casualties and many servicemen were taken prisoner, including the Commanding Officer of the Gloucestershire Regiment, Lt. Col James Carne, later awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry.\n\nIn Britain itself, the war’s outbreak was initially greeted with dismay, as well as concern about whether war might once again influence ordinary people’s lives. There was some confusion too for, whilst Britain had strong links to other parts of East Asia through its empire, little was known generally about Korea. The war also raised political issues, especially about the costs of rearmament as Attlee’s government (like other European post-war governments) had been elected in 1945 on a promise of a more comprehensive welfare state. Yet despite moments of concern and the involvement of many thousands of service personnel – including young conscripts – the war gradually faded from view in Britain, even while the fighting continued."
