        "text": "The early 1920s witnessed a spike of interest in the import of European stars to Hollywood, as the film studios hired talent scouts to keep a constant watch on successful stage and film actors on the continent. Vilma Bánky’s Hollywood career began when she was signed to Samuel Goldwyn’s film studio in 1925. This paper analyses the characteristics of Bánky’s star image, particularly in relation to her conspicuously white features and the story of her discovery, which successfully located her within the Cinderella narrative. To the movie going public, Bánky achieved stardom through being discovered by a film producer rather than through conscious efforts, thus, her story was encoded as a patriarchal text that denied her any form of agency. Bánky’s star publicity suggested she incarnated the highest ideals of whiteness; her gentle way of being and feminine charm was a natural extension of her physical attributes. Fan magazines propagated the concept of perfect white womanhood by emphasising tranquillity, elegance and grace as characteristics inherent to her persona. ‘Miss Banky’s charm is a subtle, winsome appeal which one associates inevitably with the truly feminine’, declared one columnist writing for Picture Play. The fan discourse also showed Bánky as an eager subject of Americanisation, as an actress who owed her ‘lucky break’ not only to her producer, but an individual in debt to transformative power of America at large.\n\nThe paper explores aspects of the careers of actresses who appeared in silent films. An ultimate aim is to examine the effect that the coming of sound film had on these careers. There undoubtedly was an effect but the paper suggests it has possibly been exaggerated. Much of the `popular' literature, at least, concentrates on the `stars' who are not typical. Most of the actresses were not stars, or not for very long, and had relatively short careers as far as film went, and had relatively long and, one hopes, otherwise normal lives. Some biographers tend to emote about the `tragic' lives that Hollywood actresses lived. In fact we don't know much about the majority of these lives. Based on a sample of about 1700 actresses for which basic information is available some of the `myths' that have accumulated about actresses and Hollywood in the 1920s are queried.\n\nWhat motivates feminist film research today? Exploring women’s contribution to silent cinema, scholars from across the globe address questions of performance, nationality, industry, technology, labor, and theory of feminist historiography. The volume builds on the thematic, methodological, and material diversity that characterized earlier efforts in women’s film history, and the originating context of the sixth Women and the Silent Screen conference (Bologna, 2010). Much emphasis is given to the transitional period of silent cinema (1910s to the early 1920s), which emerges as the field where feminist film scholars are beginning to claim their own theoretical and historical ‘place’. While giving a new impetus to the idea of transitional cinema, the collected essays also illuminate the importance of film’s transnational circulation. Questions of nation and nationhood, and women’s inclusion or exclusion within these terms, are examined in connection to issues of cultural globalization. How did American serial queens impact early Chinese film? How did the variety stage accommodate American films in Rio de Janeiro? Along what lines might we discuss women filmmakers who literally toured the world? These are just some of the issues that are discussed in the volume. Each investigation prompts us into distinct acts of cultural contextualization. A particular focus on acting and the agency of the actress is shared across the volume. The fundamental figure of the actress links multiple threads of scholarship, traversing different films and national cinemas. Alice Guy, Asta Nielsen, Florence Turner, Lois Weber, Mary Pickford, Esfir’ Shub, Pearl White, Vera Karalli, Aleksandra Khokhlova, Elsa Lanchester, Louise Fazenda, Sarah Bernhardt, Gemma Bellincioni, Angelina Buracci, Yin Mingzhu, Leni Riefensthal: these are but some of the names that are encountered across the essays in the collection. New findings are exposed and new research perspectives are opened through these and other figures, allowing us to uncover original ways of thinking about women’s visibility and agency on film.\n\nDrawing upon Broadway musicals ranging from Irene (1919) to Gypsy (1959), American Cinderellas on the Broadway Musical Stage considers how Broadway musicals from the 1920s through the 1950s adapted and transformed Perrault's fairy tale icon in order to address changing social and professional roles for American women. Drawing heavily upon historical research in American culture and gender studies, Cantu analyzes female lyricists and librettists who were significant in translating Perrault's heroine to the contexts and concerns of the American \"working girl.\" In exploring how these and other writers (of both sexes) adapted the Cinderella myth to a twentieth-century urban landscape, this book challenges traditional assumptions about the American musical's relationship to both feminism and modernism -- placing the Cinderella story into the Broadway musical canon.

Coda: Rewriting the Broadway Cinderella Story EDITORIAL REVIEWS \"What Maya Cantu has achieved is to link mid-twentieth-century Broadway and Hollywood's fascination with Cinderella imagery and plots to modern feminism, and to the shifting conditions of American women. This book opens a rich vein of musical theatre study not unearthed before. She has written a real gem: fresh, comprehensive, engaging - often even revelatory.\" – Stuart Hecht, PhD, Associate Professor, Theatre, Boston College, USA and author of \"Transposing Broadway: Jews, Assimilation, and the American Musical\" \"'American Cinderellas on the Broadway Musical Stage' convincingly argues for the Cinderella motif as crucial to American musical theatre. Instead of pre-modern waifs and princesses, however, Maya Cantu finds her Cinderellas among the working girls, gold diggers, broads, boss ladies, and prostitutes of modern American culture, reminding us of the centrality of spunky girls in the musical. An insightful and illuminating read.\" - Pamela Robertson Wojcik, Professor, Department of Film, TV, and Theatre, University of Notre Dame, USA \"This book is not only a smart, fascinating, and entertaining celebration of Broadway's love of the working girl's rags-to-riches dream, but also an engaging, thoughtful and perceptive exploration of our cultural values and the theatre artists who shaped them. A joy!\" – Jack Sharrar, PhD, American Conservatory Theater, author of \"Avery Hopwood: His Life and Plays\"\n\nAbstract For well over fifty years, “girls as princesses” has been a staple of childhood play. In 2000, The Disney Corporation released its \"Princesses\" line of merchandise - - eight princesses marketed together as a group for the purpose of creating a single brand which can be more easily mass-produced. As such, the princess industry has grown significantly in the last ten years. This paper explores the heavily marketed princess motif on the development of gender identity in young girls. The messages of simplistic and traditional, hyper-gendered performances are powerful and ubiquitous, and such fixations need not be encouraged in primary classrooms. Primary teachers in particular could use alternative and varied metaphors for gender roles when choosing books, stories, and learning activities for their classrooms, and they can create space for critical discussions regarding young children's perceptions of gender roles. Because children appropriate cultural material to participate in and explore their world, mindful engagements with their teachers seem necessary."
