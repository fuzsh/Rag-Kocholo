Blink and you miss beautiful and I mean BEAUTIFUL shots.\n\nScenes getting intercut with random shots and angles, average length of 0.9 seconds, climbing one step THREE cuts, everything moving with shaky cam have no idea what’s going on in any of action scenes.\n\nthat opening chase deserved better.\n\nthe warehouse/rope fight deserved better.\n\nthat opera scene especially deserved better.\n\nFunny enough it’s the shortest Bond film. Imagine that\n\nHas a movie ever been ruined for you by the editing? Madam Web is a recent one with some odd ass editing"
