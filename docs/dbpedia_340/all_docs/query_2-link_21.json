        "text": "his refers to the process of embedding a specific message or commentary within the generic patterns of a film beyond the core myth of that specific genre. So, while a Western might be about man civilizing the wild, a specific Western like High Noon can also have an allegorical message about McCarthyism in 1950s America. When filmmakers use their films to relay personal or political messages like that, they are in essence using the genre as a vehicle to carry their ideas. Genres make great vehicles because they are so recognized and popular with the public. When the viewers go for a fun day or night out at the cinema, their guards are down. If a filmmaker were to just state outright their personal or political beliefs, viewers would likely resist or shut down. They might even walk out. However, if the filmmaker can hide it underneath the facade of a comedy or western, the public takes it, internalizes it and only later might realize what the film was saying. In that sense, it is like giving someone a bitter medicine by hiding it inside cherry syrup - sugarcoating the pill, in essence. Using humor, sex, action or any other \"enjoyable\" things are great ways to slide political messages, moral complaints, sermons or any other hard sells past the viewers.\n\nthis is the core of the genre. The various themes and ideas in the film eventually coalesce in one basic message or moral, and this is the reason why specific genres are made and watched over and over. A culture will use these genres to tell itself stories about why it does certain things in certain ways, why it believes what it does and what the meaning of life is for that society. The deep truths and beliefs at the core of a genre become almost religious experiences, stimulating people often to watch films over and over because of how it reinforces their beliefs and makes them feel about their own lives. The traditional ideas and institutions of society end up being supported and praised in these ways, and cinema sometimes serves as a kind of social force, bonding people together, teaching them cultural mores and providing them with meaning. The question is not whether films do this or not - they do. The question is whether or not a genre's message is valid and worthy of being promulgated. At different times in history, a culture will reassess its views and even perhaps change them. Art can be an important tool in this process of assessing beliefs, at times helping to create them, at others to reflect them, most likely usually a little of both. The Revisionist phase of film genres saw filmmakers and viewers enjoying a constant overturning and rejection of all the classic genres. However, by the Postmodern phase, many genres still existed and were as powerful and popular as ever. Their enduring hold on the public is no accident - people seem to hold the core myths of these genres dear to heir hearts no matter the time or place. Genres like romance, comedy and horror seem to either always be with us, or at least cycle into popularity on a regular basis. Genres like westerns and musicals seem to have mainly faded from the popular consciousness and lost their importance to our collective psyches, cycling back very rarely and weakly, if at all. Why is this? Well, if you pry open the layers of the genre and identify the core, you will likely see why. When a society stops believing that the core myth of the genre is valid or important, it will drop them. If there is no way to update or revise it, it will eventually die out. By the time the core myth dies out, the conventions and iconography of that genre are also likely no longer very interesting to a culture. The core myth of the western deals with civilization taming the wild and bringing law and order as a good thing to the uncivilized. What changed in the way society thinks to invalidate this core myth? First, we simply ran out of \"wild\". Once America had fully settled the western frontier, there was nothing left. Every corner of the map has been pretty much mapped out by now, so the idea of going into the wild to civilize it simply doesn't have the same kind of pull on our psyches. Further, the very idea of \"civilizing the natives\" has become questioned - forcing Native inhabitants of any land to take on European or American religious views or societal structuring policies is now viewed as hubris or worse - cultural imperialism, perhaps even genocide. And finally, the specific idea of European Americans killing Native Americans and taking over their land has been losing favor for a long time - the imagery showing them being shot or rounded up is extremely distasteful to a modern audience. When taken together, these modern trends in the way society sees itself and thinks about the core myth of the genre have essentially rendered that genre no longer valid. Can it be revived? At times, a filmmaker may try to revise the western, or poke fun of it, but it appears as if the genre is kaput as a vital artistic and entertaining means of expressing societal fears and desires"
