        "text": "196. Life’s Shop Window. US, Box Office Attraction Co., October 1914. Directed by J. Gordon Edwards, synopsis by Mary Asquith, it starred Claire Whitney as Lydia Wilton and Stuart Holmes as Bernard Chetwin. The end of the story was changed so that Lydia returns to Bernard. In a letter (17 February 1924) now in the New York Public Library, Cross wrote to the literary agent Eric Pinker that she had never sold the film rights of Life’s Shop Window.\n\n197. Five Nights. GB, Barker Motion Photography, May 1915. Directed by Bert Haldane, script by Rowland Talbot, it starred Eve Balfour as Viola, Thomas H. MacDonald as Trevor and Sybil de Bray as Suzee.\n\n198. Paula. GB, Bamforth Co., November 1915. Directed by Cecil Birch, it starred Hettie Payne as Paula and Frank McClellan as Vincent. A film of this name based on Cross’s novel, probably the same film but just possibly an American remake, was released in the US in 1918. See American Film Institute Catalog, FI 1911-1920, ed. Patricia King Hanson and Alan Gevinson (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 282.\n\n199. The Night of Temptation. Italy, Collosseum Films, 1919. Directed by G. Serra, script by Kenelm Foss, it starred Aurele Sydney."
