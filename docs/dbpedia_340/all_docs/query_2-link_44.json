Mise en Scene:  Set in Space  High-tech computers  Use of futuristic props  Use of violent actions and gore, including makeup  Strange futuristic costumes and space suits  Aliens physical actions/movements are incredibly powerful compared to humans\n\n3. Mise En scene : Sci-fi Common Settings: Props: Space (Gravity) Post-apocalyptic cities ( I am Legend) Weapons (Han Solo’s blaster) Dystopian setting (Hunger Games) Auto-9 pistol (Robocop)\n\n4. Mise En scene : Sci-fi Costumes: Things in common: •Most sci-fi films have props such as weapons and technologically advanced equipment •Sometimes the villain wears some form of armor e.g. Darth Vader •The hero usually wears generic clothing e.g. Will Smith(I am Legend), Sarah Connor (Terminator) Metallic armor Colourful costumes (Star Trek)\n\n5. Sci fi props and costumes • Sci fi props are unreal. • Costumes are over top • Super heroes dress to look appealing e.g. attractive strong. • Villains dress to look unappealing e.g. scary, unattractive, evil\n\n6. • In sci-fi films the mise en scene is most commonly …. • Space • Future setting e.g.- Avatar • Past setting e.g.- Back to the future • Low-key lighting and when there is bright lighting it is usually lazar blue • Costume & Props • In sci-fi films the characters usually are armed with props, they can be the regular swords and weapons • Depending on when the film is set the props can vary. For example in many future setting films the props are made up and do not exist, because it is set in the future the weapons are very different and not possible to create at this time.\n\n7. Setting & Props: • Elements of destruction in key locations. Fire, burning- usually inflicted by someone trying to take over, a threat to the world/ • Typically bright colors: blue, red, to show futuristic and developed characteristics. • Dull colors are sometimes used. These show that although the movie is set in the future, the story still focuses on past ideas. Instead of productive development, the world seemed to in fact go back in time.\n\n8. Elements of Mise en scene • Settings and props • Costume, hair and makeup • Facial expressions and body language • Lighting and colour • Positioning of objects/characters in the frame\n\n9. Settings and Props • Settings and locations play an important part in film making and are not just backgrounds • Sets are either built from scratch or a great deal of time/money is spent finding a set that already exists • Settings can manipulate an audience by building certain expectations and then taking a different turn\n\n11. Costume, hair and makeup • Acts as an instant indicator to us of a characters personality, status and job • Tells us immediately whether the film is set in the present and what society /or culture it will centre round • Certain costumes can signify certain individuals e.g. Black cloak of a vampire, Spiderman's costume – AUDIENCE INTERPRETATION\n\n12. SETTING Time – The future, an alternative timeline or an historical past that contradicts historical records Place – Outer space, other worlds or alternative versions of earth Why – It gives a different setting to the present allowing viewers to see the narrative from a more neutral perspective. ‘It place the unfamiliar and alien in the context of the familiar’\n\n13. Settings – usually not on Earth, Settings are usually made from scratch, graphics or in fact a location which is has not been explored or discovered yet. They have a common element of interference usually by the anti- hero. Most Sci-Fi's also are also associated with futuristic elements, advanced technology Costumes – Usually indicate the characters personality and role in society such as jobs\n\n14. PROPS Futuristic props are used to represent the scientific advancement at the centre of the film E.g. weapons – High tech Space- Spaceships Why – New technologies to explore futuristic social, political and philosophical issues\n\n15. COSTUMES/MAKEUP Costumes and make up are used to make the characters look more realistic - which overall ensure the narrative and film is also realistic.\n\n16. props District 9 Star Wars Pacific Rim The Fifth Element Props in Science fiction films show the viewer how far technology has come since the present. Normally it is a weapon or form of transport. In some films its just a small indication that tech had become a bigger part in peoples lives e.g. small robot assistants, holograms, hover cars, better communication.\n\n17. The star wars and star trek setting have very much in common because they both set in space. And both have a large space ship. Another connection is Terminator salvation and back to the future. They both have a connection because Terminator Salvation is set in the disaster future , but Back to the future is set in the recent past . Another connection of setting is the planet Pandora in the movie Avatar and the dark mysterious world of Prometheus the reason why they have a connection is because they both have aliens living on their own land.\n\n18. costumes Hunger Games The Fifth Element The Matrix Star Trek Star Wars Costumes give an idea f the sort of class a certain character is, how culture has changed in this time period and the primary purpose of a character\n\n19. props District 9 Star Wars Pacific Rim The Fifth Element Props in Science fiction films show the viewer how far technology has come since the present. Normally it is a weapon or form of transport.
