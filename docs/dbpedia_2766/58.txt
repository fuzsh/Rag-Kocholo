Arthur Lake (1905-1987)

Born Arthur Silverlake in Kentucky on April 17, 1905, Arthur Lake was born into show business, as his parents had a vaudeville act which he joined while still a youth. In the late 1910s, the family made its way to California, where Arthur Lake would soon enter films as a juvenile lead. In 1924, Lake signed with Universal Studios and acted in many silent short subjects, nearly all of them comedies. But when Lake's contract was up in 1930, Universal dropped his option, sending his career into decline. Lake freelanced at Monogram, RKO, and other studios until signing a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1938 to portray Dagwood Bumstead in the Blondie series of films. The popularity of the first film, Blondie, in 1938 led to three follow-up films in 1939 and the introduction of the CBS radio series of the same name.

Suddenly, Lake was famous but soon became so identified with the role that he rarely portrayed another character. In total, Columbia released 28 Blondie films, but the series---and Lake's career---ended following the release of Beware of Blondie in 1950. In 1957, Lake returned to the Dagwood role in the short-lived Blondie television series, with Penny Singleton being replaced by Pamela Britton. When the series was canceled, Lake retired from the screen and concentrated on his sizable business interests and dabbled in stage acting. He retired in the early 1970s and passed away on January 9, 1987, at the age of 81. Lake's wife, Patricia, whom he married in 1937, was raised as the niece of actress Marion Davies but was actually the daughter of Davies and newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst.

Penny Singleton (1908-2003)

Born Dorothy McNulty in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 1908, beautiful brunette Penny Singleton practically grew up onstage, starting out in vaudeville while still a child. Singleton's song-and-dance routine was highly successful, ensuring her a lot of Broadway exposure by the late 1920s. By the mid 1930s Singleton was a song-and-dance veteran, yet her career had reached its peak. She then left New York for Hollywood, picking up small supporting roles in films. Upon marrying Dr. Lawrence Singleton in 1937, she ceased using 'Dorothy McNulty' and changed her name to Penny Singleton. The following year, when actress Shirley Deane backed out of the role of Blondie, Singleton bleached her hair blond and was signed by Columbia.

While the film series and radio show had become a success, Singleton's marriage withered and soon ended. She then married producer Robert Sparks, in 1941. Sparks produced the first twelve films in the Blondie series before he enlisted in the Marines during World War II. Singleton stuck with Blondie until the series fizzled in 1950. She returned to her performing for live audiences in the 1950s, and in the early 1960s signed on to voice the character of Jane Jetson in Hanna-Barbera Productions' The Jetsons, first aired by ABC in the fall of 1962. Singleton stuck with the role after her husband's death in 1963 and continued to lend her vocal talents to Jetsons animation through the late 1980s. Penny Singleton passed away on November 12, 2003, following a stroke.
