        "text": "Arthur Robert MacLean Barrow was a surveyor and civil engineer.\n\nHe lived at 2061 Beach Avenue in 1905.\n\nFamily Background\n\nArthur Robert MacLean Barrow was born in London, England on April 3, 1866. His parents were Alexander MacLean Barrow (born about 1832) and Sarah Constance Mallett (born about 1839).\n\nIn 1881, Alexander Barrow was a retired merchant who was living in Caterham.\n\nArthur’s grandfather was Thomas Culliford Barrow (1793-1857), who was a clerk in the British Navy pay office. Thomas’s sister, Elizabeth Barrow, married John Dickens in 1809, and was the mother of Charles Dickens, the English novelist.\n\nEarly Life\n\nArthur attended Radley College in Oxfordshire from 1879 to 1882. He studied mechanical engineering.\n\nIn 1889, he appeared in the list of graduates in the Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nTo India\n\nBy 1892, Arthur was living in India, where he worked with the locomotive department of the North Western Railway in Sukkur.\n\nMarriage to Elizabeth Houghton\n\nOn November 16, 1892, in Karachi, Arthur married Elizabeth Alexandra Houghton. Elizabeth’s father was John Samuel Houghton (1840-1872), who had been a railway refreshment room contractor. (In the 1881 census of England, Elizabeth A. Houghton was the step-daughter of James Bradford. Elizabeth’s birthplace was Bradford in Yorkshire.)\n\nTo British Columbia\n\nArthur and his family arrived in British Columbia in 1896. In 1897, they were living in the City of Nelson.\n\nElizabeth died in Nelson on June 16, 1897.\n\nMarriage to Daisy Houghton\n\nIn 1898, in Calgary, Northwest Territories, Arthur married Daisy Illman Houghton, who was Elizabeth Houghton’s sister. Daisy was born on January 21, 1872, in Brighton, Sussex, England and she was christened in Brighton on February 14, 1872. Daisy’s parents were John Samuel Houghton and Emma Jane Houghton.\n\nCareer in British Columbia\n\nArthur became a BC land surveyor in 1899.\n\nIn 1902, he appeared in the list of graduates from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. His address was in Nelson, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, Arthur auctioned his furniture and household effects as he got ready to move away from Nelson.\n\nIn 1903, Arthur was living on Hill Island in the Gulf Islands, along with his brother, Francis John Barrow (1876-1944).\n\nFrom 1907 to 1910, Arthur was surveying the townsite for Prince Rupert, which was the Pacific terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.\n\nIn 1910, he was elected as an alderman in Prince Rupert’s first city council.\n\nMilitary Service\n\nDuring the First World War, Arthur served with the 30th Railway Battalion, Royal Engineers. He returned from the war in early 1919.\n\nLater, the family lived in Smithers, Johnson Landing in the Kootenays, and Pouce Coupe, in the Peace River District.\n\nDaisy: Death in Victoria\n\nDaisy died in Victoria, British Columbia, on November 27, 1921. She was buried in Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria.\n\nArthur: Later Life\n\nArthur retired in the 1930s.\n\nHe died in Victoria on March 8, 1953.\n\nChildren\n\nLucy Constance Barrow\n\nArthur Robert MacLean Barrow and Elizabeth Alexandra Houghton had one daughter. She was Lucy Constance Barrow, who was born on November 11, 1893, in Rajahmundry, Madras, India.\n\nLucy was living in Vancouver in 1901.\n\nShe died in England on June 30, 1915.\n\nElizabeth Barrow\n\nArthur Robert MacLean Barrow and Daisy Illman Houghton had one daughter. She was Elizabeth Barrow, who was born in Nelson, British Columbia on December 28, 1900.\n\nOn August 25, 1923, Elizabeth married Gordon James Reading in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Gordon was a civil service clerk, who was born in Chiswick, Middlesex, England on May 16, 1889. His parents were James Reading and Elizabeth Reynolds.\n\nOn October 27, 1924, Gordon travelled to the United States.\n\nOn November 24, 1924, Elizabeth and her son, Rodney, travelled to the United States.\n\nIn 1930 and 1940, Gordon and Elizabeth were living in Seattle, Washington, along with their son, Rodney.\n\nIn 1944, Gordon applied to become a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nGordon died in Seattle, Washington on June 9, 1961.\n\nFurther information on Elizabeth is not available.\n\nGordon and Elizabeth had a son, Rodney Maclean Reading, who was born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, on August 1, 1924.\n\nHe moved to the United States with his parents in 1924.\n\nOn December 23, 1950, in Seattle, he married Gloria Sutton.
