She had a fighting spirit and overcame all the obstacles in her life. Words often used to describe her are strong-willed, feisty, caring, supportive, generous, honest, loving, and loyal. One of her favorite pastimes was going to the opera. She always knew how to laugh at herself, and was fearless when faced with adversity.\n\nJune’s avid interest in academics bloomed early, and she adored going to school up to grade 8. Without the option of continuing on to high school, she went to work different jobs to help support her family.

After getting married, raising two children, and helping her husband grow and run a successful business, June turned her sights back to her own educational pursuits. As an adult, she went on to achieve her high school diploma, Bachelor of Arts from Glendon College, an undergraduate degree in social work from York University, and masters degree in Social Work from Carlton University. She then used her qualifications to go to work in Toronto, where she had a career as a social worker. Later, June kickstarted her retirement by traveling the world. She will be remembered as a leader and a role model for women, a strong believer in the importance of education, and to always advocate for yourself.\n\nThe matriarch of the family, her magnetic personality was felt by everyone in her presence. She was a caretaker and loving wife, and taught us all to put fairness and family above all else. Maintaining her dignity and bravery until the end, she will be remembered for her determination and unwavering support of\n\nher loved ones.

Predeceased by his father, Roger, Mike leaves behind his devoted wife Jessica, cherished daughter, Paige, mother, Linda, sister, Tammy (John, Megan, and Tristan), and extended family and friends near and far.\n\nMike spent his younger years living the quintessential country life spending summers on the water with fond memories of camping on Lake Cecebe, swimming at the locks, riding his bike on the dirt roads, and of course playing sports with a special love for hockey.\n\nMike was a master landscaper whose commitment to quality and attention to detail was unmatched. Mike’s design talent and deft skill were a substantial contribution to the town he loved. From the Huntsville town dock and Rivermill park to the trees and granite stones at the corner of Main Street and his design contribution to the G8 Flag Park, next time you pass one of these features think of Mike and appreciate his contributions to Huntsville’s community.\n\nA straight shooter, Mike could always be counted on to “tell it like it is”. Mike was known for always being busy and had little patience for being idle. As Mike could often be heard saying, “all this laying around would ruin a good man.”\n\nMike had a passion for all things outdoors, from snowmobiling to four-wheeling to ice hockey. He was a true family man being a dedicated dad and uncle and stalwart husband and his favourite times were spent with family and friends being outdoors on Fairy Lake or being in the bush by the fire on Brown’s Road.\n\nMike’s strength and fortitude were never more apparent than in the last three years during a Herculean fight with cancer. Mike would not want to be remembered for the time he spent fighting but, instead, for all of the time he spent living. In the famous words of Mike Brown, Next Goal Wins.\n\nA visitation will be held on Friday, December 2, 2022, at Billingsley Funeral Home from 2-4 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. The funeral service will be held in the funeral home chapel on Saturday, December 3, 2022, at 10 a.m. A Celebration of Mike’s Life will be held at the Active Living Centre, Huntsville on Saturday, December 3, 2022, from 1-5 p.m. Messages of condolence can be left at www.billingsleyfuneralhome.com\n\nIn Mike’s memory, a trust fund has been set up in lieu of flowers.

Eng (Mining)\n\nIt is with profound sadness that the family shares the death of David on the evening of November 26th, at the AlgonquinGrace Hospice in Huntsville, in his 82 nd year.

He was a proud Papa of his three grandchildren: Kyle, Emily, and Marie Claire. David was born in Toronto to the late John and Elizabeth Mason. He enjoyed travelling and all things nature. He loved hiking and was proud to have hiked the Camino after retirement.\n\nDavid worked more then 45 years in the mining and investment business and passed all exams including the Partners and Directors exams. David founded and managed three public companies in the resource investment banking, uranium development, and exploration sectors. Algonquin Park called, and David settled into retirement by supervising the building of a log home on Oxtongue Lake. So many wonderful memories and David’s humour will be part of his legacy. During\n\nhis illness, he wrote and published a book ……making quick decisions on the value of resource properties. Proceeds of the book will go to the CIM Foundation Technical Professional Development Scholarship.\n\nIn honour of David’s life, please consider a donation to the Canadian Blood Bank. All the many transfusions received were so essential for sustaining his quality of life over the past year. Donations can also made to the CIM Foundation for the Mining Professional Scholarship in memory of David. You may contact Deborah Smith-Sauvé at [email protected].\n\nMany thanks to the incredible Health Care team in Huntsville and our Family Physician Dr ‘Nelson’ in whom David had so much admiration. A family burial service will be held at Bayview Cemetery, Port Rowan. Ontario on Dec. 2. Funeral arrangements are entrusted to Jeffrey Glendinning Funeral Home, Port Rowan. A Celebration of Life will be planned for a later date.\n\nWhen tomorrow starts without me, please try to understand, that an angel came, called my name, took me by the hand, and that I will be leaving behind all those I dearly love. When tomorrow starts without me, don’t think we’re far apart, for every time you think of me – I’m right there in your heart.\n\nGARNHAM, Sandra Lily (nee Fenton)\n\nPassed away peacefully at her home with her family at her side on Thursday, November 10, 2022, at the age of 64.

The angel said my place was ready, in heaven far above, and that I’d have to leave behind all those I dearly love. But when I walked through Heavens Gates, I felt so much at home, for God looked down and smiled at me and told me “Welcome Home”. So when tomorrow starts without me, don’t think we’re far apart, for every time you think of me – I’m right there in your heart.\n\nPETALIK, Roland “Rolly”\n\nIt is with broken hearts that we announce the passing of Roland Petalik, beloved husband to his wife, Betty.

At the age of 87, Carol passed away peacefully with her family by her side at Port Perry Hospital October 3rd, 2022. Beloved Carol is survived by her husband of 68 years, Robert Jack Beatty. Loving, devoted Mother of the late Robert Roy “Bobby” Beatty, James Bernard Beatty, Linda Charmaine Raeburn (Chris) and a second mom to Yvonne Hargreaves. Dearest Nana of Melissa Hargreaves, Amanda Hargreaves (Kaine Nelson), Christina Beatty/Carvalho (Danny) and the late Patrick Beatty. Adored Great Grandmother/Nana of Mikayla and Ciara Hargreaves. With a huge heart and beautiful soul, Carol embraced so many and was a caring mother, aunt or ‘Nanny Carol’ figure to numerous family friends and a cherished member of the Rose Lake Family.\n\nThe treasured daughter (‘Baby Lamb’) and only child of Robert and Eleanor Dick, Carol was born and raised in East York, Ontario, with the loving support of her Grandmother Ellen Kain. Carol and Bob were married in 1954 in Willowdale and later moved north to the Barrie area where they resided, worked and raised their family. Carol and Bob spent their weekends and summers at Rose Lake – Utterson, Ontario, where they and a close-knit group of friends established a unique cottage community back in the ʼ50s. Now into the 4th generation of ‘Rose Lakers’, many fond memories were made with their life-long friends. Prior to retirement Carol purchased her dream home of a heritage farmhouse in Springwater Township with a pond and creek. The ‘farm’ was a special place where family traditions were celebrated and where grandchildren enjoyed adventures in the country and sleepovers with Nana. It was also where creatures great and small were nurtured as Carol was a dedicated, caring foster parent to both domestic and wild animals – rehabilitating orphaned or injured wildlife.\n\nThe Beatty family would like to sincerely thank Doctors Dyall, Wray, Mercer and MacDonald and the entire medical team at Lakeridge Health – Port Perry Hospital for their exceptional, compassionate care during these last difficult couple of weeks. They would also like to graciously thank all the staff at Butternut Manor Retirement Home of Uxbridge for loving and caring for Carol the past few months, along with her dedicated PSW team over the last few years, who also became family.

Though her disease made her unable to eat in her final months, she still baked generously without occasion, to spread lasting joy that her family will remember most fondly.\n\nShe spent her final days quietly at the cottage on Lake of Bays tending to her love of gardening, ensuring her climbing roses, Lilies, Sedum, or marigolds were bright and beautiful.\n\nPeggy embodied beauty, generosity, and incredible strength of spirit in everything she did and will live on in the lives of those she touched.\n\nThe family would like to thank Mississauga-Halton as well as Simcoe North Muskoka Home and Community Care and Hospice Huntsville for their thoughtful care and compassion.

Fondly remembered by nieces, nephews, cousins and friends from across the country. Jack was born in New Toronto and was grounded to his early years with lifelong friends from junior school and his KRT club. Summers at the family cottage on Lake Muskoka played a big part of his life and future.\n\nJack’s first career was spent with his Father at Pudicombe Motors – Mercury dealerships on Dundas Street, Toronto then to Richmond Hill. His second career began in 1969 when he and Jacquie moved permanently to Muskoka and purchased Pow Wow Point Lodge on Peninsula Lake. Years of sharing “Howell Hospitality”, hosting guests from around the world and supporting the evolving tourism industry, were his passions. Jack was president of Muskoka Tourist Association and active in Muskoka Winter Association and Chamber of Commerce. Jack always enjoyed a good laugh while reminiscing about the capers and shenanigans of the guests and all the wonderful people who worked at Pow Wow over the years. His Charter Membership at Hidden Valley Highlands Ski Club (now Muskoka Ski Club) provided a legacy for his children and grandchildren that brought him great joy. In retirement he enjoyed winters in Florida and happy hour discussions.\n\nHis faith was demonstrated in his volunteer work as a Warden at All Saints’ Church and St Paul’s Grassmere and as a member of the advisory committee of the Anglican Foundation-National Church. The family would like to thank Dr. Rich Trenholme and Dr. Roy Kirkpatrick for many years of care.

His dream was to come to Canada to start a new life after the turmoil of the war years. Arriving in 1953, he started “doorknob polishing” to find a job, learned the language, finally accepted a linesman position at Mimico PUC. He came to Muskoka in 1957, built a log cabin by hand, and loved it so much he made Muskoka his permanent home in 1969. His first job was at Brooks Furniture and Appliances in Bracebridge, then Wiik and Hoegland Pipe Plant, and then Kimberly-Clark head of Electrical Maintenance Department until his retirement in 1995.\n\nAfter retiring, Nancy and Hermann bought a farm and enjoyed the life of haying, raising cattle, chickens and turkeys, 2 pet goats and a pig. In 2016, he wrote two short books, Life in Germany, and Life in Canada. He was an avid reader of history and at age 90 he took up woodworking, crafting lanterns, bowls, and anything that was challenging. He remembered his mother saying, “whatever you shout into the forest, that is the way the echo comes back”. He was also a proud member of Unity Masonic Lodge, and Strong Lodge, where he had many friends. He was always curious and loved a challenge.\n\nThere’s an old saying “Time Flies”, but Hermann would say, “Time is always here, but we have a heavier foot on the pedal.”\n\nA celebration of life will be held at Trinity United Church, September 24 at 2:00 pm. There will be a memory box available to drop in your favourite memory of Hermann.
