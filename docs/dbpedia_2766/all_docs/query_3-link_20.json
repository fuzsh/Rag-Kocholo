        "text": "For centuries, Indigenous peoples lived and traveled across the land now known as Colorado’s Front Range, including the long hogback ridge extending between the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the grasslands of the Great Plains. In particular, members of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe hunted animals and gathered seasonal plants in this fertile land. It is likely they came across fossils of extinct plants and animals and recognized the differences from the wildlife they were encountering themselves.\n\nIn 1876, Arthur Lakes, a professor at Jarvis Hall (which would become the Colorado School of Mines) in Golden, identified many fossils along the west side of the Dakota Hogback. This hogback would eventually be named Dinosaur Ridge. Sending the fossils to Yale Peabody Museum c/o Professor Othniel Charles Marsh, the paleontologist named many well-known dinosaurs from these remains. These included Apatosaurus, Stegosaurus (the Colorado State Fossil), Allosaurus, turtle fossils, and more. These specimens represent animals that lived 150 million years ago in the Late Jurassic Period, also known as the “Age of Giants.”\n\nIn 1937, during the construction of West Alameda Parkway, dinosaur tracks were uncovered on the east side of Dinosaur Ridge in the 100-million-year-old rocks of the Dakota Group, representing the Early Cretaceous Period. These tracks are those of duck-billed herbivores and ostrich-like carnivorous dinosaurs. Recent research has revealed that these tracks represent only a small number of the extensive track-bearing beds of the Dakota Group, which can be traced from Boulder, Colorado, to northern New Mexico. Because these strata represent the shoreline sediments of an ancient seaway that was frequently trampled by dinosaurs, these beds have been dubbed the “Dinosaur Freeway.”\n\n1860\n\nThe Rooney family establishes a homestead and begins what would become the largest cattle ranch in Colorado history at the eastern base of the hogback in the early 1860s.\n\n1874\n\nArthur Lakes finds a Tyrannosaurus rex tooth on South Table Mountain in Golden and recognizes it as belonging to a large carnivorous dinosaur. (T. rex was not named by paleontologists until a partial skeleton was unearthed in Montana in 1905).\n\n1876\n\nThe first dinosaur bone fossils are collected from what would become the world-famous Morrison Formation of Late Jurassic age. Some of the most iconic dinosaurs now known lived and died in the area now called Dinosaur Ridge, including Stegosaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, and Allosaurus, long before the Rocky Mountains uplifted. Arthur Lakes, a professor in Golden, led excavations at 15 quarries along the Dakota Hogback in the Morrison area in search of dinosaur fossils.\n\n1879\n\nOtis Rooney discovers the first horned dinosaur fossils from a gulch near the intersection of the present Alameda Parkway, Bear Creek Boulevard, and West Jewell Avenue.\n\n1887\n\nThe first Triceratops discovery to be published occurs near present day North Federal Boulevard in Denver. (Two large horns were misidentified as bison horns.)\n\n1902\n\nArthur Lakes discovers the first dinosaur footprints in Colorado along the Front Range near Colorado Springs.\n\n1937\n\nAlameda Parkway is constructed to provide easier access from Denver to Red Rocks Park. Dynamite blasting reveals hundreds of dinosaur footprints, mostly Iguanodon-like tracks, perhaps from Eolambia. Carnivorous theropod tracks were also present.\n\n1952\n\nOtis and Al Rooney build the house that now serves as the Dinosaur Ridge Main Visitor Center Gift Shop.\n\n1973\n\nJefferson County Open Space (JCOS) purchases 69 acres known as the “Nelson Hogback.” This was the first parcel of many that now comprise the 2,461-acre Matthews/Winters Park where Dinosaur Ridge is located.\n\nThat same year, the Dinosaur Ridge area is nationally recognized for its uniqueness and historical and scientific significance when the Department of the Interior designates the Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark on November 7, 1973.\n\n1975\n\nCouncil Tree, also known as Inspiration Tree, is placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ute Mountain Ute tribal Chief Colorow is said to have held councils near the tree in the late 1800s. The ponderosa pine is thought to be 400-500 years old.\n\n1976\n\nRooney Ranch (Jefferson County’s oldest ranch) is designated a Jefferson County Landmark.\n\n1982\n\nGovernor Richard D. Lamm signs an Executive Order on April 28 establishing the Stegosaurus as Colorado’s state fossil following a 2-year campaign by 4th graders and their teacher Ruth Sawdo at McElwain Elementary School in Thornton.\n\n1988\n\nKickoff meeting “Re. Development and Protection of Colorado’s Dinosaur Resources” (the origin of Friends Of Dinosaur Ridge) is held at the University of Colorado at Denver.\n\n1989\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of Dinosaur Ridge (FODR) forms to address increasing concerns regarding the preservation of the site and to offer educational programs on the area’s resources. Articles of Incorporation are filed on April 25.\n\n1990\n\nFODR publishes “A Field Guide to Dinosaur Ridge” authored by paleontologist and UC Denver professor Dr. Martin Lockley.\n\n1992\n\nA large concretion falls out of the road cut on Dinosaur Ridge and cracks upen revealing wood that has almost completely altered to carbon.\n\nThe first major paleontological excavation since the Yale dinosaur bone excavations of the late 1870s is performed at the main tracksite. Six parallel dinosaur trackways are revealed on the southern side of the sloping tracksite.\n\n1995\n\nUSGS approves the placename, Dinosaur Ridge.\n\nFODR pilots its first summer camp for 10- to-12-year-old students. Two one-week sessions are held.\n\n1996\n\nConstruction begins on the Dinosaur Ridge Visitor Center in a historic stone house on West Alameda Parkway, and officially opens on October 22.\n\n1998\n\nFODR completes a stabilization project at the Bone Bed site on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge.\n\n1999\n\nThe main tracksite pedestrian ramp and seating area are completed on Dinosaur Ridge.\n\n2000\n\nThe Dan Turner Field Experience Fund is created to assist lower-income schools with the cost of taking field trips to Dinosaur Ridge.\n\n2001\n\nStabilization of the “Bulges” tracksite is completed on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge.\n\nFODR’s board appoints the organization’s first Executive Director, Joe Tempel.\n\nFODR renovates the historic Rooney barn and moves its administrative offices inside.\n\n2002\n\nFossil Trace Golf Course opens in Golden and FODR begins hosting tours of the trace fossils at the location now known as Triceratops Trail.\n\n2004\n\nTriceratops Trail is completed adjacent to Fossil Trace Golf Course.\n\n2006\n\nDinosaur Ridge is selected by The Denver Post as one of the “Top 10 Things to Do Before You Die.”\n\n2008\n\nTrek Through Time, a small exhibit hall, opens inside the historic barn.\n\nPublic traffic along West Alameda Parkway is closed from Rooney Road to HWY-93 across Dinosaur Ridge.\n\n2009\n\nThe location of Arthur Lakes’ Quarry 1 is rediscovered about one half mile north of Dinosaur Ridge along HWY-93.\n\nScientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s EarthTime Project dated volcanic ash layers exposed at Dinosaur Ridge’s road cut. Using the uranium-lead zircon method of dating they found the ash to be 106 million years old.\n\nFriends of Dinosaur Ridge, the Morrison Natural History Museum, and Triebold Paleontology, operator of the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, formed the Dinosaur Corridor.\n\n2011\n\nThe Morrison Fossil Area NNL is expanded to include Triceratops Trail making it the Morrison-Golden Fossil Areas National Natural Landmark.\n\n2013\n\nThe Ute Council Tree located near Rooney Road and West Alameda Pkwy is named a Jefferson County Historic Landmark.\n\nThe Harvey Family Foundation purchases a Sikh Temple located on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge inside Entrance 1 to Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre in 2012. The property is given to FODR as a secondary operating location. The Discovery Center opens to the public with a gift shop and exhibit space in 2013.\n\n2016\n\nDr. Martin Lockley announces the discovery of two trace fossils on Dinosaur Ridge north of the main tracksite. These fossilized “leks” were likely pseudo-nests scraped into soft ground by dinosaurs during courtship.\n\nA Raptor track is identified on Dinosaur Ridge; the first discovered in Colorado and only the second found in North America.\n\n2018\n\nDinosaur Ridge is formally made a state-approved curatorial fossil repository.\n\n2019\n\nJefferson County, working in conjunction with Friends of Dinosaur Ridge, publishes a Master Plan for Dinosaur Ridge which includes plans for a new Visitor Center.\n\nA greeting kiosk is built near the head of Triceratops Trail adjacent to 6th Avenue east of 19th Street in Golden.\n\nThe organization celebrates its 30th year with seven public events and a homecoming extravaganza for co-founders and longtime supporters.\n\n2020\n\nDinosaur Ridge shuts down all tour, program, and gift shop operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
