        "text": "+++ SCHMIDT, Frank Leon\n\nSept 22, 1946 – Nov 19, 2022\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce the death of Frank Schmidt on Nov 19, 2022 after a two year battle with cancer. Frank is survived by his loving wife Anne Marie and his sons Michael (Tanya), Peter (Amanda), Jerome (Elsa) and daughter Mary (Matthew) as well as his loving grandchildren Melanie, Danielle, George, Mario, Melina, Bronwyn, Penelope and Malcolm. Frank was predeceased by his parents, Ambrose and Helen. He was born and raised in Richmond, attended Vancouver College and graduated from UBC. His love of travel began with a backpacking trip through Europe and the Middle East in 1969. Frank was a great provider for his children and coached many of their sports teams – football, baseball, lacrosse and soccer. He began working in Prince Rupert Pulp Mill’s technical department as well as serving in boiler water treatment in various other BC mills.\n\nAfter retirement, Frank and Anne pursued a life of travel visiting 138+ countries in all seven continents. Travel also comprised of train trips in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Morocco, Peru, Europe, India, China and Mongolia. His passion was collecting model trains especially those made for the Canadian market culminating in a published book. He also loved to work in his vegetable garden each year providing great crops for the family. We would never leave on vacation until the tomatoes were harvested!\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Joseph the Worker, 4451 Williams Road, Richmond on December 2 at 11am with reception to follow. A private internment for family will follow. REST IN PARADISE, FRANK.\n\n+++ RADOMSKI, Grazyna Maria Teresa\n\nJuly 22,1932 - October 28, 2022.\n\nGrazyna passed away peacefully at home in her 90th year. Her love of family and her enjoyment in family life and her spirit were maintained until the end.\n\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, she was predeceased by her mother Maria and brother Lech-Marian in Poland; her father, Lt. Col. Henryk Bazylko, in 1975 in Abbotsford; and her husband, Dr. Tadeusz Radomski in 2000 in Abbotsford.\n\nShe led an extraordinary life including her escape from the advancing military invasion at the start of WWII. Uprooted from her birth country, she travelled on strafed trains across Europe, and ended up on a ship, the MS Batory carrying troops to France from Greece, that survived torpedo attacks in the Mediterranean. Her Lt.Colonel father had to leave her in the south of France for the duration of the war while he and his soldiers rejoined the Polish Government in Exile and the war via England. She continued her schooling in Scotland and England, and met her future husband in Ireland through a mutual friend. They were married in London, England, where she worked as a physiotherapist, and began a family. Moving the family and dog to Saskatchewan for what was only to be a one year stay in Canada turned into a lifetime when the family later settled in Abbotsford and expanded.\n\nGrazyna led a life of limitless heart, openness, and spirit. Happiest when entertaining friends and family with imaginatively prepared and presented gourmet meals, and hosting memorable gatherings and parties. The doors were always opened and the guest room was always occupied.\n\nSome of the things she will be remembered for include being an advocate for her family and friends, the affection she drew from everyone, generously full of Polish hospitality, and being a model of motherhood in action.\n\nShe is survived by her children Yolanta, Witold, Christopher (Karin) and Elizabeth, and her grandchildren Kara, Leah, and Jesse.\n\nMass of Christian Burial was held Friday, November 4, 2022 in St. James, Abbotsford. Interment followed at Hazelwood Cemetery, Abbotsford.\n\n+++ VANDERZALM, Joan Elizabeth\n\nFebruary 16, 1936 – October 26, 2022\n\nJoan was a loving wife, mother, grand-mother, and great-grandmother.\n\nShe was born in New Westminster, the 5th of 10 children, growing up on “Douglas Road”. She regaled to her children on how tough her and her siblings were – all with a twinkle in her eye. On September 5, 1956, she married her beloved husband, Nick, and spent the rest of their married life in the house they built behind the nursery. There they raised their 5 children: Debbie (Mike), David (Cindy), Wim (Alison), Cindy (Mark) and Sarah (Mike). This house became more than a house. It was the home to innumerable gatherings for both sides of the family – Ericksons and VanderZalms. Here was where Auntie Joan shone. We will all miss her amazing meals …. and her pies!\n\nHer faith and her church, St. Peter’s, were a constant in her life. She was a member of the Catholic Women’s League where she also served as president, and she always kept the priests well stocked with her baking. Nick and Joan made sure that the grounds of the church were adorned with beautiful flowers and the liturgical celebrations well decked out with poinsettias and Easter lilies.\n\nJoan is also survived by her 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren with 2 more great-grandchildren on the way. She will be greatly missed. Our hearts, however, are lightened knowing that she is back together with Nick and all her beloved family that has predeceased her.\n\nA funeral mass was held November 3, 10 am at St. Peter’s Church, 330 Royal Ave. New Westminster. Immediately following there was a reception at Kearney’s Funeral Home at 219 6th St. New Westminster.

He was always so proud of his sons, spending his spare time at the rink watching their games, then later on, his grandsons play hockey. He was a faithful attendee at daily mass and helped train and schedule the parish Altar Servers. Faith and family were his greatest loves.\n\nIn lieu of flowers please consider a donation to Chalice.

At the age of four, he fled with his family to Macau to escape the Japanese invasion. There, he attended the Istitudo Salesiano with his older brother Pedro, where his father worked as a secretary.\n\nIn the following years, his family faced a punishing twist of fate when his father died. Coping with distress as a young widow, his mother found work with the Precious Blood Sisters and through the missionary, she found grace in knowing God. As a devout Catholic, she instilled her spirituality in her children. Fr. Aloysius was baptized in Macau in 1944. After the war ended in 1945, he followed his family and settled in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1949, Fr. Aloysius responded to his calling and joined the Salesian of Don Bosco. In 1953, he went on to study philosophy at the Novitiate Salesian Seminary in Naples, Italy where he stayed for several years. In 1959, he studied theology at Melchet Court, Sherfield, England, where he entered his lifelong journey into priesthood.\n\nFr. Aloysius was ordained in Macau on December 18, 1965. He started first as a teacher and administrator in Salesian schools and then discerned the call to serve as a diocesan priest. He came to the Archdiocese of Vancouver in 1972 and was incardinated into the Presbyterate of the Archdiocese in 1979. He is most remembered for having served for a long time with dedication and zeal at Saint Francis Xavier Parish, in Vancouver.\n\nAs a former teacher, Fr. Aloysius was dedicated to nurturing the spiritual maturity of his ministry. He founded the local Council of the ‘Knights of Columbus’ in St. Francis Xavier Parish in 2005. He was very supportive of the Knights which earned him a 4th Degrees member ranking, titled ‘Sir Knight’. He was also the founder of ‘Saint Joseph Sodality’ for family heads.\n\nLike a good shepherd who is constantly on the lookout for green pastures, Fr. Aloysius tirelessly devoted himself to his ministry. With keen observations and confidence, he identified areas in which promotion and upgrade were apparent. Under his leadership, he led the building of a home for the elderly - Happy Manor was opened in July 1979. In the following year, the new parish daycare center was also completed. Father was always committed to help and respond swiftly to requests. Since 1975, he took up additional ministry work in Seattle for the Catholic community there. His heart was moved with compassion when he learned that ‘they were like sheep without a shepherd’. He commuted to Seattle once monthly over a period of ten years.\n\nIn 1995, Fr. Aloysius was invited to serve at Our Lady of Good Counsel, in Pearl City, Honolulu, Hawaii. The congregation grew quickly, and in the summer of 1997, a Chinese ministry was established at Our Lady Star of the Sea Parish, where he was appointed associate pastor. After four happy years in Hawaii, father was called back by Archbishop Adam Exner to oversee the new Saint Francis Xavier School and church projects. Fr. Aloysius witnessed the inauguration of the new Saint Francis Xavier church and retired from active ministry in 2008.\n\nFr. Aloysius studied and spoke many languages and believed that language is the key to broadening one’s horizons. Since his retirement, father devoted his time to work with the Sisters of the Epiphany, a member of the Salesian family in Shaoguan, China, as a volunteer English teacher. Although technically retired, he continued to contribute much of his time and expertise to serve at St. Theresa Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn his later years, another door opened at Saint Joseph’s Seminary and Church in Macau. Invited by the bishop of Macau as a guest pastor, Fr. Aloysius immersed himself in a seminarian’s life of quietness and solitude. There, he reconnected with his distant memories of living in Macau during his childhood. In his retirement years, Fr. Aloysius maintained a part-time presence in Vancouver and led several pilgrimages to Europe, South America, and Asia.\n\nOver his fifty years’ span as pastor, Fr. Aloysius touched the lives of many. His presence was found in every facet of our lives, through baptisms, sacraments, housewarmings, marriages, celebrations, and beside hospital beds. We have known him as a pastor, teacher, confessor, counsel, brother, and a friend. Father fell ill in the beginning of 2022 and bravely fought his illness. He passed away peacefully on May 20, 2022, in the comfort of his home. At the end of his life, Fr. Aloysius felt that he found contentment and fulfillment in his life as a priest, servant, man of prayer, preacher of the Word, mediator and man of the people.\n\nVigil Prayer & Viewing was on Sunday, June 5th, 2022, 6:30pm at Saint Francis Xavier Church, 428 Great Northern Way, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFuneral Mass was held on Monday, June 6th, 2022, 10:00am at Holy Rosary Cathedral, 646 Richards Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nBurial to follow Funeral Mass at 1:00pm at The Garden of Gethsemane, 15694 - 32 Ave., Surrey, B.C.\n\n+++ALEXANDER, Rev.

Alfred maintained lifetime friendships with many of his Forestry classmates. In 1959, Alfred met his Marguerite while she was working as a lay apostle for Bishop O’Grady in Terrace, BC. They married in 1960 and theirs was a marriage rooted in deep love, faith, mutual admiration, and respect. Alfred’s entrepreneurial spirit and sense of adventure led him to work in Terrace, BC, Hudson Bay, SK, Abbotsford, BC and western and southern Turkey. He founded Westree Custom Cedar Products in 1982 in Abbotsford, BC and grew the business for over 3 decades with his son Marc. While most of his career was devoted to forestry, Alfred’s passion for flying small aircraft led him to own and manage Abbotsford Air Services at the Abbotsford Airport from 1973-1980 where he also served as a director of the Abbotsford Airshow. Alfred was a wonderful father. He had a great curiosity about virtually everything and took a keen interest in all of his children’s pursuits. Hunting and fishing were two of his favourite pastimes. In later years, Alfred and Marguerite divided their time between their homes in White Rock, Peachland and Indian Wells, CA. Alfred served his communities in many ways including as a Rotary and Board of Trade president, and a Grand Knight in the Knights of Columbus. Both he and Marguerite were ushers at Good Shepherd Parish in White Rock for 17 years. He lived his life guided by a deep and abiding faith. He was a man of tremendous integrity, and many experienced his quiet generosity in times of need. He will be missed by everyone whose life he touched. Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated at Good Shepherd Parish on April 7th, 2022 with interment at the Gardens of Gethsemani.\n\n+++SMITH (nee LYNCH), Patricia Mae,\n\nDecember 29, 1927 – March 23, 2022\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec.
