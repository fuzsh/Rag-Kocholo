        "meta_description": "Jameel Russell interviews William Campbell, a well-known barber from Milwaukee, on June 22, 2015. Campbell tells of how he became a barber and his triumphs and struggles as a black business owner dealing with changing hairstyles and changes in employment in the black community. Campbell also speaks on his experience working for Miller Brewing Company. <br><br>This interview is part of an oral history series done of Milwaukee residents on the effects of Milwaukee plant closings on the city's African-American community since 1970. The Wisconsin Historical Society, in collaboration with the Wisconsin Black Historical Society & Museum, sponsored an oral history project that ran June-August, 2015. Four Milwaukee high school and college students were trained in oral history techniques by UW-Milwaukee professors Michael Gordon and Rob Smith and then interviewed black residents who had first-hand knowledge of these events. In the interviews, students asked about four broad areas: 1) family history; 2) education; 3) work history; 4) and the plant closings and their consequences. Interviews took place at the Wisconsin Black Historical Society & Museum under the supervision of museum director Clayborn Benson, who also conducted the initial interview.<br><br>The linked transcript has not been meticulously proofread. Before quoting from this interview, verify passages by comparing them against the audio recording.",
