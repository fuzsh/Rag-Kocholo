        "text": "Thomas Kelly Stockstrom exchanged his earthly tent for his heavenly one on Thursday, August 1, 2024, after a long battle with cancer. He was born to Arthur Stockstrom, Jr. And Martha Ann Galleher Stockstrom on June 20, 1955, in St. Louis, Missouri. He met the love of his life, Jane Ethel Hunt, while attending Bemidji State University. They married shortly after graduation and moved to the Detroit Lakes area where they raised their family for 30 years on 119 acres of land by Shell Lake.\n\nOver the course of the years, Kelly worked in Quality Control for Dynamic Homes, as Assistant Manager at Noeske Lumber and then ran his own business, K.S. Enterprises, Inc. manufacturing and installing kitchen cabinets and hardwood flooring. He learned his love of woodworking from his grandfather, Arthur Stockstrom (“Papoo”) who took him under his wing on their visits to the family farm. Kelly loved the great outdoors and partook in many a duck hunting trip with his father, son, son-in-law, and grandsons. His other passions were fishing, gardening, and dabbling with taxidermy. Not one for idleness, he was affectionately dubbed “Kelly-Kelly go-go,” as there were always projects in the works.\n\nKelly’s faith walk was of utmost importance to him. His goal was to be known by His Lord and to make Him known to others. He served as an elder at Harvest Church for a number of years and mentored many. He was also involved in the community, serving as a school board member at Frazee-Vergas for over 5 years.\n\nKelly was dearly loved and will be immensely missed. He is preceded in death by his parents, Arthur Stockstrom, Jr. and Martha Ann Galleher Stockstrom. Surviving him are his children Sarah (Aaron) Boyer, Ryan (Jessica) Stockstrom and Leah (Andrew Freeding) Stockstrom as well as grandchildren Joshua and Madison Boyer and Samuel, Ashton, Olivia, and Elizabeth Stockstrom. He is also survived by his brother, Arthur Stockstrom III (Jill).\n\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to the staff at Perham Living for their wonderful care for Kelly over the past few months.\n\nA visitation service will be held at Harvest Church, 806 Frazee Rd, Frazee, MN, from 5-7 PM (Visitation 5-6 PM/Prayer and Sharing 6-7 PM) on Thursday, August 8, 2024. The funeral service will take place at 11 AM on Friday, August 9, 2024 at Harvest Church with visitation one hour prior. Interment will be at Oak Grove Cemetery in Detroit Lakes. Flowers can be sent to Harvest Church. In memoriam can be given to the family which will be donated to Perham Living for a dedication in their courtyard.\n\nDavid-Donehower Funeral Home, Detroit Lakes is assisting the family."
