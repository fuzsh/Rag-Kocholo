        "text": "– January 13, 1925\n\n– October 21, 2011\n\nSo very loved by family and friends, Art peacefully passed away on October 21, 2011 at the age of 86.\n\nHe was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and spent his school years in Regina. There, his school principal was influential in Art’s desire to serve his country in WW II and at the age of 17 “fibbed” his way into the Royal Canadian Navy. On finishing his service, he was given the opportunity to continue his education and graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Business Administration.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, he travelled many diverse paths; sales, management, investment, development, computer programming and teaching. He enjoyed the challenge in each area and strived to excel in everything he did.\n\nArt’s involvement in the community was also varied; he served as a Jaycee Senator and President and served in many areas that touched his concern.\n\nArt’s strong faith in God was important to him and he served in his church wherever needed; on committees, boards and as one of two elders who were lay Pastors when waiting for the permanent Pastor of his church.\n\nHe loved boating and was head of the Power Squadron out of Vancouver where there were many pleasurable trips with family and friends.\n\nHis grandchildren delighted in his make-up story-telling when the families got together for special occasions!\n\nHe was a gentle, caring and considerate man and we will miss him very much!\n\nArt is survived by his loving wife Kathy, his last living sibling Shirley and Art and Kathy’s blended family of 7 children: Dan (Theresa), Marcy, Bonnie (Blayne), Rob, Randy (Kim), Chuck (Amie) and Camille (Eric). He also leaves behind 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.\n\nGoodbye dear one until we are with you again. God bless you.\n\nA service and Celebration of Life will be held at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church at 713 4th Street, Castlegar, BC on Friday, November, 4, 2011 at 11:00 am with Pastor Ron Abresch officiating. Sarah Greenwood with the Castlegar Funeral Chapel has been entrusted with arrangements.\n\nAs an expression of sympathy, donations in Art’s name may be made to the www.facebook.com/groups/ParkinsonSocietyBC/.\n\nParkinson Society of British Columbia, Suite 600 - 890 West Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6C 1J9 or online at"
