        "text": "October 14, 1963 - April 4, 2023\n\nWe lost our beloved Arthur to liver failure on April 4, 2023. He was devoted to his wife Jocelyn and children Max, Eva, Nikolas and Olivia.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by all who knew him. In the many tributes our family has received, Arthur has been repeatedly described as a leader, legend, icon and force of nature; always hardworking, dedicated, respectful, kind and generous, a proper old-school man.\n\nArthur was a gentle, giving man who worked tirelessly to provide for his family. He faced every challenge in life with unparalleled strength and integrity. Family was his utmost priority and he was an excellent father - leading by example, debating and teaching life lessons with an emphasis on manners and respect. He took great joy in active pursuits with his family and friends - biking, surfing, playing hockey and tennis.\n\nArthur was fiercely competitive but always aware of the level of his companions and made sure that everyone made it home safely.\n\nEarly in life, Arthur learned the importance of hard work from his parents, Gotthardt and Ingrid. He instilled that same work ethic in his children. He was always there for them and he taught them the importance of family, hard work and doing what is right. Arthur was a true role model to his family, his co-workers, the students of TFA and the community. Arthur was incredibly generous - offering his time, assistance, guidance and care.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Alberta with a law degree, Arthur went on to practice law in Edmonton before returning to join the family business in Fernie, B.C. He worked with his parents and siblings, Gordon and Carmen, to evolve their enterprises and prepare the next generation for the future.\n\nWhen not working, or spending time at his children's numerous activities, Arthur gave endless time volunteering for many organizations, including Fernie Minor Hockey, Fernie Youth Soccer, The Fernie Academy and the City of Fernie. He was particularly committed to the Design Review Panel and plowing the Fernie Outdoor Rink.\n\nArthur truly believed in community and service to that community through his supportive, pragmatic, intelligent, outspoken, kind, witty and diligent manner. He was relentless in his support of his passions and those of his children. He loved spending time at the lake with his family and friends.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we are requesting donations be made to any of the youth organizations Arthur volunteered for or to liver.ca. His family strongly urges you to become an organ donor by searching your provincial registry online - this requires only your name, date of birth and healthcare number.\n\nAn organ was not offered to Arthur in time to save his life; however, typical of the man he was, he was able to donate to eight recipients in need.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Holy Family Parish at 2 p.m. on April 29, 2023.\n\nService Details\n\nCelebration of Life\n\nSaturday, April 29, 2023\n\n2:00 PM\n\nHoly Family Parish 521 4 Ave, Fernie\n\nAbout the Author: Black Press Media Staff\n\nRead more\n\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\n0\n\nShares\n\nShare by Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on X\n\nShare via Text Message\n\nTrending\n\nDialogue and debate are integral to a free society and we welcome and encourage you to share your views on the issues of the day.
