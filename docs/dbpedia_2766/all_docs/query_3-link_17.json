        "text": "Arthur Lake\n\nArthur Lake was an American actor known best for bringing Dagwood Bumstead, the bumbling husband of Blondie to life in film, radio, and television.\n\nAt the time of his birth in 1905, Arthur Silverlake, Jr.‘s father and uncle were touring with a circus in an aerial act known as “The Flying Silverlakes”. His mother, Edith Goodwin, was an actress. His parents later appeared in vaudeville in a skit “Family Affair”, traveling throughout the South and Southwest United States. Arthur first appeared on stage as a baby in Uncle Tom’s Cabin and he and his sister, Florence, became part of the act in 1910. Their mother brought the children to Hollywood to get into films, and Arthur made his screen debut in the silent Jack and the Beanstalk. Florence became a successful actress, achieving a degree of fame as one of the screen wives of comedian Edgar Kennedy.\n\nUniversal Pictures signed him to a contract, where he acted in westerns as an adolescent character actor. Shortly after the formation of RKO Pictures in 1928, he signed with that studio, where he made Dance Hall and Cheer Up and Smile. During this early sound film era, he typically played light romantic roles, usually with a comic “Mama’s Boy” tone to them, in films such as Indiscreet with Gloria Swanson.\n\nArthur Lake is best-known for portraying the Blondie comic strip character of Dagwood Bumstead in twenty-eight Blondie films produced by Columbia Pictures from 1938 until 1950. For the first seven of those years, a radio version was also broadcast with Lake in the Dagwood role. He also portrayed the character in a short-lived 1957 Blondie TV series. His work in the popular Blondie radio show earned him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6646 Hollywood Blvd.\n\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";amzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"hwof05-20\";amzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"search\";amzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";amzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";amzn_assoc_region = \"US\";amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = \"Arthur Lake\";amzn_assoc_default_category = \"All\";amzn_assoc_linkid = \"55eff95a50b66e89ff63cd2b2fd4e0af\";amzn_assoc_search_bar = \"false\";amzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Arthur Lake\";"
