        "text": "Arthur Brittain Netherby was a banker and financial agent. He lived at 1884 Haro Street in 1919.\n\nFamily Background\n\nArthur Brittain Netherby was born on July 12, 1881, in Wellington County, Ontario. His parents were Stephen Brittain Netherby (1835-1921) and Sarah Catherine Weeks (1844-1928). Stephen Netherby was a teacher and a school principal.\n\nStephen Netherby died at Barnet, British Columbia in 1921.\n\nSarah Netherby died at Bridge River, British Columbia in 1928.\n\nEarly Life\n\nArthur went to school in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nHe later became an employee of the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nMarriage to Flora MacDonald\n\nOn June 10, 1908, in Nelson, British Columbia, Arthur married Flora MacDonald. She was born on October 30, 1885, in Brandon, Manitoba. Her parents were William Alexander Macdonald (1860-1946) and Mary Elizabeth Gamble (1864-1921). William Macdonald was a lawyer and judge who lived at 1875 Robson Street in 1909, at 1816 Haro Street from 1910 to 1918, and at 1884 Haro Street from 1920 to 1941.\n\nFamily Life in British Columbia and Saskatchewan\n\nUntil 1916, Arthur and Flora were living at 623 Carbonate Street in Nelson. Arthur was the manager of the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nIn June 1916, Arthur became the manager of the Royal Bank in Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nTo Vancouver\n\nIn November 1918, Arthur and his family moved from Regina to Vancouver.\n\nFrom 1919 to about 1923, the Netherby family was in Vancouver.\n\nIn 1919, Arthur was the manager of the Reliable Investment Company, and he was living at 1884 Haro Street.\n\nLater in 1919 he became a bond dealer with W.G. Wright and Alex C. Paterson.\n\nIn 1920, the Netherbys were living at 876 Bidwell Street.\n\nArthur did not appear in the 1921 Vancouver directory.\n\nIn the 1921 Canada census, Flora was living with her parents at 1884 Haro Street, along with four children: Elizabeth Netherby, Greta Netherby, William Arthur Netherby and Helen Naomi Netherby. Arthur was not listed.\n\nIn 1922, Arthur was back at 1884 Haro Street, and he was working as a broker in the Credit Foncier Building at 850 West Hastings Street.\n\nIn 1923, Flora was living in apartment 32 in Englesea Lodge at 2046 Beach Avenue.\n\nTo United States\n\nAccording to the 1930 United States census, Arthur and Flora immigrated to the United States in 1923.\n\nIn 1929, Arthur was the defendant in a Vancouver lawsuit involving the disappearance of bonds. He did not file a defence, and the plaintiff obtained a default judgment.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the Netherbys were in Seattle, Washington.\n\nIn 1932, Flora filed for a divorce from Arthur.\n\nIt appears that Arthur died in Tulsa, Oklahoma in February 1933.\n\nFlora: Later Life\n\nDuring the 1930s, Flora travelled frequently to Hawaii, sometimes with other family members.\n\nAt the time of the 1940 United States census, Flora was living in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nIn 1942, Flora was at 4412 Marguerite Avenue in Vancouver, along with her father, William Alexander Macdonald.\n\nFlora died in Seattle, Washington, on March 7, 1950.\n\nArthur and Flora had the following children.\n\nWilliam Arthur Netherby\n\nWilliam Arthur Netherby was born in Vancouver in September 7, 1909.\n\nIn 1930, he was living with his parents in Seattle, Washington.\n\nHe married Fritzie G. Given, on December 21, 1934, in King County, Washington. Fritzie was born in Washington State in 1911. Her parents were Harry G. Given (1878-1950) and Louise M. Diehl (1882-1941).\n\nWilliam became a naturalized United States citizen on July 31, 1941.\n\nWilliam died in 1964, and he was buried in Acacia Memorial Park, Lake Forest Park, King County, Washington.\n\nFritzie died in 1970, and she was also buried in Acacia Memorial Park, Lake Forest Park.\n\nElizabeth Netherby\n\nElizabeth Netherby was born in Nelson, British Columbia, on December 3, 1910.\n\nShe never married.\n\nShe died in Vancouver on October 1, 1972. She was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nGreta Netherby\n\nGreta Netherby was born in Nelson, British Columbia, on December 3, 1910.\n\nShe was working as a typist for the federal income tax department in the late 1940s.\n\nShe married Walter Johnson. He was born on July 1, 1895, in Norway. He died on October 15, 1952. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nGreta later married Carl Johanson. He was born in Vancouver on October 16, 1907. His parents were Carl Johanson and Maria Peterson.\n\nCarl Johanson died in Vancouver on November 16, 1957. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nGreta later married Herbert Kitchener Hussey. He was a construction partsman. He and Greta lived at 1773 Davie Street in Vancouver.\n\nHerbert died in Williams Lake on May 13, 1971. Greta died in Vancouver on May 1, 1978.\n\nHelen Naomi Netherby\n\nHelen Naomi Netherby was born on June 1, 1918, in Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1938, she was married to Harold Wilfred Ajax (1916-1997).\n\nIn 1940, Harold and Helen were living in Twin Falls, Idaho.\n\nIt appears that they were later divorced.\n\nHelen died on March 30, 1973 in Seattle, Washington.\n\nSources\n\nStephen Brittain Netherby (father of Arthur Brittain Netherby)\n\nStephen Britton Netherby (1838–1921); Birth: 12 NOV 1838, Hillier Township, Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada; Death: FEB. 26, 1921, Barnet, British Columbia, Canada (ancestry.ca).\n\nStephan Brittain Netherby (12 November 1838 – 9 February 1921); https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LZFD-CDS.\n\n“Ontario Census, 1861,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MQQP-QB6 : 9 March 2018), Stephen Nethery, Hilier, Prince Edward, Ontario, Canada; citing p. 54, line 46; Library and Archives Canada film number C-1069-1070, Public Archives, Toronto; FHL microfilm 349,317.\n\n“Canada Census, 1881,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MVXK-J2X : 20 May 2019), Stephen B Nethery, Wellington, Hillier, Prince Edward, Ontario, Canada; from “1881 Canadian Census.” Database with images.
