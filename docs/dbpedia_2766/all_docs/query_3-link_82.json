        "text": "Editor's note: This column was first published by the Reno Gazette Journal in 2012. It's being reposted now on the anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death.\n\nMarilyn Monroe, the blond \"sex goddess,\" died a tragic death on Aug. 4, 1962, in Los Angeles. The coroner ruled the actress' death at age 36 a suicide, albeit under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThe biggest mystery — more likely myth — associated with her Nevada connection is that Marilyn Monroe's now well-known affair with President John F. Kennedy included a tryst at the Cal-Neva Lodge.\n\nOne documented account of Kennedy visiting Lake Tahoe was as a Massachusetts U.S. senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Gov. Grant Sawyer had arranged for Kennedy to address a joint session of the Nevada Legislature in Carson City on Feb. 1, 1960. A reception was scheduled for Sunday evening at the Governor's Mansion, followed by a talk at the civic auditorium.\n\n\"When Kennedy and Pierre Salinger and their party got to Reno, they eluded the press and sneaked off in a car and went up to Lake Tahoe and looked it over before coming to Carson City,\" according to Gov. Sawyer in his oral history, \"Hang Tough.\"\n\nRichard Ham, a Sawyer aide, stated in an interview that Kennedy was briefly staying at the Riverside Hotel and asked Ham to provide him with a car that he could drive alone to Lake Tahoe before going to Carson City. Kennedy apparently visited the Cal-Neva Lodge after a stop at Squaw Valley, the site of the 1960 Winter Olympics.\n\nHowever, it was virtually impossible that Marilyn Monroe was at Lake Tahoe to greet the aspiring presidential candidate. Monroe, by all accounts, was in Hollywood at the time, rehearsing scenes for the movie \"Let's Make Love.\" Her marriage to her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller, was clearly troubled and would soon end in divorce. At the time, she pursued a short-lived affair with co-star Yves Montand.\n\nSome writers conjecture that Monroe was also having an affair with Sen. Kennedy while he was campaigning in the Los Angeles area. Donald Spoto, the most rigorous of Marilyn's biographers, wrote in 1993 that the so-called \"love affair\" between Kennedy and Monroe was fleeting and did not begin until after the first documented meeting in October 1961 at Peter and Patricia Kennedy Lawford's Santa Monica beach house. In fact, Spoto claimed Monroe was intimate only once with Kennedy on March 24, 1962, when both the president and Marilyn were Bing Crosby's house guests in Palm Springs, California.\n\nIf Spoto is right that any other claims to the contrary cannot be substantiated, then Marilyn Monroe's getaways to Lake Tahoe during and after the filming of Arthur Miller's \"The Misfits\" had nothing to do with John Kennedy, and more to do with her attraction to Frank Sinatra.\n\nFilming of \"The Misfits\" in Nevada began in July 1960 in Reno and concluded in October after scenes had been shot in and around Pyramid Lake and Dayton. At long last, Monroe worked with her childhood film idol, Clark Gable. Both Monroe and Gable had earlier been divorced in Las Vegas — Gable from his second wife, Ria Langham, in 1939 and Monroe from first husband, James Dougherty, in 1946.\n\nMeanwhile, in the summer and fall of 1960, John Kennedy was busy campaigning for the presidency after winning the Democratic nomination at the Los Angeles convention in July.\n\nThere is nothing on record at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston that identifies Kennedy, officially or unofficially, visiting Lake Tahoe or Northern Nevada during his presidency. Monroe is known to have made her last visit to Lake Tahoe at the invitation of the Lawfords during the weekend of July 27-29, 1962, just prior to her apparent suicide.\n\nThe events surrounding Marilyn's short stay at Sinatra's Cal-Neva Lodge are controversial, confusing and contested, making it very hard to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWe know that she met Dean Martin briefly to discuss the off-again, on-again filming of \"Something's Got to Give.\" Joe DiMaggio, her second husband, was there, and according to one account, there was a reconciliation and talk of marriage. Still other accounts have Peter Lawford telling Monroe that all communication with John and Bobby Kennedy was cut off. There have even been unsubstantiated claims that Monroe tried to commit suicide or was drugged while staying at the Cal-Neva.\n\nThe truth in its entirety will likely never be known about the JFK-Monroe affair.\n\nHowever, the stories about a liaison between Kennedy and Monroe at Lake Tahoe are unsupported and may well represent a titillating, modern-day presidential version of the \"George Washington slept here\" myth.\n\nGuy Rocha is the former Nevada state archivist."
