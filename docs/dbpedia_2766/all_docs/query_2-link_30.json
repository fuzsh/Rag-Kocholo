A group of patrolmen, known as the Gibsland Posse, had studied their movements and discovered they moved in a circle around the edges of five midwestern states to prevent officers from pursuing them over state lines into another jurisdiction.\n\nWith in-depth knowledge of their typical movements, the Gibsland Posse hatched a plan and set up an ambush along the Louisiana State Highway. On the morning of 23rd May 1934, the posse remained concealed in their hiding spots when they saw Clyde driving a car at high speed towards them. The posse had persuaded Ivy Methvin, father of Barrow Gang member Henry Methvin, to position his car on the side of the road in an attempt to lure Clyde into stopping his vehicle and getting out to talk to Henry.\n\nWhen Clyde fell into the trap, the posse opened fire before the car had even fully stopped. Clyde was killed instantly by a headshot. The posse proceeded to fire over 100 rounds into the car, emptying their weapons as they were determined not to take any chances. The coroner reported seventeen entrance wounds on Clyde’s body and twenty-six on Bonnie’s, including several headshots each.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nHitler Becoming Dictator of Germany\n\nPaul von Hindenburg was President of Germany from 1925 up until his death on 2nd August 1934. The day before his death Hitler had heard that he was on his deathbed and had the cabinet pass the Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich. This new law meant that, upon Hindenburg’s death, the role of President of Germany would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the Chancellor (the position that Hitler was currently in). Hitler created the new title of Führer und Reichskanzler (which means Leader and Chancellor of the Reich).\n\nMere hours after Hindenburg’s death on 2nd August 1934, it was announced that, as a direct result of this law created by Hitler, Hitler became both the head of state and head of government for Germany, making him the absolute dictator of Germany. On 19th August 1934, Hitler held the 1934 German referendum to see if the German people approved of Hitler taking the position of Führer. The result of this referendum was 90% in favor of Hitler becoming the dictator of Germany."
