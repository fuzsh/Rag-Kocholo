The project looked at 16,000 individuals drawn from census data for Alnwick, Brighton, Bristol, Dundee, Greenock, Leeds, Merthyr Tydfil, Morpeth, and Winchester. The research project was funded by the UK Economic & Social Research Council and was based at the Universities of Oxford and Northumbria.\n\nFunding\n\nThe Professions in Nineteenth-Century Britain\n\nEconomic and Social Research Council\n\nFind out more...\n\nHistory"
