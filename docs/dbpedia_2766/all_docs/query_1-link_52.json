        "text": "November 6, 1945 - May 6, 2023\n\nLarry Bulat was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend.\n\nHe passed away peacefully in Abbotsford, British Columbia on May 6, 2023, at the age of 77. Larry was born to Ethel and John Bulat in Mountain Park, Alberta on Nov. 6, 1945.\n\nAfter graduating from Strathcona High School in 1964, Larry attended Simon Fraser University, where he studied Biochemistry. It was at university where he met the love of his life, Gwen. From their first date to their wedding, a mere three months passed.\n\nAfter graduation, the couple embarked on a tour of Europe before returning to start their teaching careers in Fort Nelson.\n\nIn time, Larry and Gwen moved back to the Fraser Valley, where they purchased 5 acres of land in Mission and built a home together. They raised three sons: Ryan (Heidi), Jarrett (Tamara), and Nathan (Kelly). Larry continued to work as a Math teacher at Mission Junior and Mennonite Educational Institute.\n\nLarry's faith in Jesus played a significant role in his life. He and Gwen were active members of Mission Alliance Church, where they formed many cherished friendships and made lasting memories.\n\nUpon retiring in 2000, Larry and Gwen moved to Shuswap Lake. There, they developed new friendships and became involved with River of Life Community Church. Retirement allowed Larry and Gwen to indulge their love of travel, exploring many destinations together.\n\nAs a grandfather, Larry was deeply invested in the lives of his grandchildren. His eight grandchildren, John, Jackson, Mckenna, Anna, Lucia, Jane, Amelie, and Zadie, will miss him dearly.\n\nLarry is predeceased by his beloved wife of nearly 55 years, Gwen.\n\nTheir marriage served as an inspiration to many. Larry's faith was a source of strength and encouragement for those who knew him, and he was always generous with his time and energy, supporting his family and friends in their times of need.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Larry's memory to Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Canada.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at Northview Community Church, 32040 Downes Rd. on Thursday, June 1, 2023 at 1:00 p.m."
