        "text": "Print This Page\n\nJames A. Larson, age 87, of St. Michael, Minnesota, passed away peacefully on July 9, 2024, at CURA of Monticello.\n\nHe was born on December 4, 1936, in Minneapolis, MN to Carl and Elizabeth Larson.\n\nJim held different management positions throughout his career which took him to Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, and back to Minnesota in 1999.\n\nJim’s Catholic faith was so important to him. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus. When he could no longer attend church, he watched Catholic Mass every Sunday morning and attended Rosary during the week.\n\nJim was a loving husband of 64 years to Kathryn. He was also a devoted father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was always there when needed. He most enjoyed spending time with his family which included time at the cabin in Northern Wisconsin on Mud Lake, and yearly trips with his children and grandchildren to Treeland Resort in Hayward. Jim also shared his love of fishing with his family which included fishing trips to Wisconsin, Minnesota and Canada.\n\nHe was always kidding around with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren and loved to see their reactions. He enjoyed attending their sporting events and school events, and the many birthday parties. Jim would always remind us during the year of how many days until his birthday. Jim had a sweet tooth and the kids loved sharing in his love of ice cream and chocolates. He would also never turn down a game of Farkle.\n\nJim had a way with dogs and there wasn’t a dog that didn’t love him, especially when he had a pocketful of treats.\n\nJim enjoyed meeting friends over coffee several times a week as he loved to socialize with everyone. His wit and humor will truly be missed.\n\nWith everything he went through in the past couple of years, we admire him most for his strength, kindness, positivity, and he was one who never complained.\n\nJim is survived by his wife, Kathryn; his children, Linda Nelson (DeWayne) of Eau Claire, WI, Sandra (Dan) Zahler of Maple Lake, MN; his grandchildren, Josh, Kyle, Sara, Anna and Steven; great-grandchildren, Mason, Carson, Eden, Elliott, Emma, Maven and Chloe.\n\nJim was preceded in death by parents, Carl and Elizabeth Larson; daughter, Susan; and sister, Patricia.\n\nThe family would like to extend a special thank you to CURA of Monticello and Moments Hospice for their loving care of Jim.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be held Friday, July 19, 2024 at 11:00 AM with visitation one hour prior at the St. Michael Catholic Church (11300 Frankfort Parkway NE, St. Michael, MN). The service will be livestreamed via the link: https://www.youtube.com/c/StMichaelCatholicChurchStMichaelMN\n\nPrivate interment will be held at Mary, Queen of Peace – St. Martin Cemetery in Rogers, MN.\n\nFuneral arrangements have been entrusted to The Peterson Chapel of St. Michael-Albertville. Online condolences for the family may be directed to www.thepetersonchapel.com"
