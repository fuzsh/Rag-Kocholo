With his family by his side, Len was called to heaven to be reunited with his beautiful wife, Sylvia on July 2, 2023.\n\nLen will be remembered lovingly and is deeply missed by his four children David (Kelly), Tami (Marty), Laurie Ann and Sharon (Mark). Len cherished and leaves behind 6 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren; Jason (Kristen - Addison, Evelyn, Garrett), Lauren (Dave - Grace, Jack, Will), Tyson (Tara - Willa), Colton (Julia), Adam (Jen - Madison, Olivia, Arabella), Megan (Brian - Mason, Dylan), his furry friend Patches, as well as numerous extended family and good friends.\n\nBorn in Nelson on November 15, 1931, Len was the 6th child in a family of eight and spent his youth growing up in Nelson and Grand Forks. After graduating from high school in Grand Forks, Len attended Trail Business College which landed him a long career with Cominco beginning in 1951 as a steno clerk at Blue Bell Mine in Riondel. He closed the books on his career as an Accounting Supervisor in Metal Sales 40 years later in Trail. Len and Sylvia married on November 3, 1956, and settled in Riondel to raise their family before moving to Trail in 1965.\n\nIn his younger years, Len was an incredible athlete and competed in baseball, fastball, hockey, curling, golf, and skiing. He was an even better armchair athlete in his later years, mastering all of these sports and more. Len always cheered for the underdog in any sport but was devoted to the Canucks and Blue Jays. He was always thrilled and proud to attend his grandchildren's sporting events and was their biggest cheerleader.\n\nLenny's passions included his family, his best friend Patches, the stock market (particularly green days; \"you see I know these things\"), casino time (\"you don't look broke\") with his guardian angel and devoted nurse Laurie Ann. Affectionately known as Lenny to some and Arthur to others, Len enjoyed camping at Willow Beach for 55 years and was instrumental as one of the pioneers of the Willow Beach campground as we know it today. Len took great pride in his tenure as treasurer at WB.\n\nLenny will fondly be remembered for his charm, his spirit of generosity, his love of people and friendly disposition, his playful sense of humour, his quick wit and his hilarious penchant for always getting in the last word. A few of his Lennyisms such as \"You're closer than you think\"; \"You can see I got this sore thumb\"; Did I show you my watch?\" and \"That's the name of that tune\", will be held close to our hearts. Bababalushski, the Grand Forks Mohawks and the Lenny hair flip will go down in history.\n\nMost of all Len loved to laugh and laugh he did! ALWAYS!! It was his gift! He always looked for the positive in every situation (\"well look at it this way\"). Today is a new day; tell a joke, get up to some shenanigans, share a quick-witted comment with others and think of Lenny when you do it because that's what he thrived on. It kept his mind sharp and you on your toes! His happiness was derived from seeing others happy!\n\nWith a bright smile on his face, \"what will be will be\", said Len as he raised his wine glass in heaven with Sylvia and the other Willow Beach pioneers. You are so loved and missed beyond measure because \"you iz impOtant\"! We are grateful that dad picked us to be his children and for the gifts he has left with us to treasure. We promise to do our best to carry on his legacy of positivity, laughter, lightheartedness, and integrity. We love you forever and always.\n\nThe family would like to acknowledge Laurie Ann for her extraordinary efforts and commitment in caring for Dad, especially after Mom passed on. Dad always said, \"he lived a good life\".\n\nThere will be a celebration of life for Len and Sylvia to be announced at a later date.\n\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\n0\n\nShares\n\nShare by Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on X\n\nShare via Text Message\n\nInMemoriumLogo Your condolences will be approved within one business day.
