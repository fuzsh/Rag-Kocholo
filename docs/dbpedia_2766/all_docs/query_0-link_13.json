        "text": "February 14, 1928 - November 11, 2018\n\nIt is with great sadness that the family of Joe Perrier announces his passing on Sunday November 11th, 2018 at Kootenay Lake Hospital after a short illness. Joe was the son of Arthur and Frances Perrier and was born and raised in Nelson where he lived his entire life.\n\nAs a young man, Dad worked for the Ministry of Forest in the Burns Lake area for 3 years before returning to Nelson to marry the love of his life, Vivian MacGillivray. After their marriage, he worked for the Department of Highways as a grader operator. Dad then worked for the City of Nelson's Power Plant before moving on to the City's Meter Department. Dad retired from the City at the age of 62.\n\nDad and Mom were ardent square dancers with the Nelson club for 32 years, always travelling to jamborees throughout B.C., Alberta and the Northern United States. Dad loved camping with his children while they were young, often in a tent where they were known to be flooded out by the rain. He built his own wooden boat with a 50HP Mercury outboard and was often known to travel up and down the west arm of Kootenay Lake with his wife and children through sun and storms. He and Viv loved to travel to baseball tournaments all over B.C. with their youngest son.\n\nAfter retirement, Dad spent many hours woodworking, creating various bowls, cutting boards etc. signing these off as created by \"Cho\". He was a jack of all trades, building his own homes, cabinets, renovations, tinkering with his own car repairs and much much more.\n\nThe thrill of downhill skiing caught Dad at a young age and continued well into his 50's. Dad enjoyed playing with his John Deere lawn mower so much that he put a blade on it so he could plow snow in the winter.\n\nDad always loved to share stories with anyone who listen. Baker Street will be a lot quieter now.\n\nDad is survived by his 5 children, 7 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren: Bryan (Gloria), grandchildren Chris (Amanda) great grandchildren Ben and Isabelle and grandson Justin; Dianne, grandson Peter Williams (Isabelle Leclerc) great grandchildren Mikaela and Kona, Kai and Teo; Carol Grace (Rob) grandchildren Samantha and Matthew (Devin); Brad (Deeanne) and Ken (Andrea) grandchildren Connor and Will.\n\nDad was preceded in death by his wife of 62 years Vivian (January 2015), sister Naida Palmer (November 1982) and grandson Braden Williams (January 2016).\n\nThe family would like to thank the 3rd floor nursing staff of the Kootenay Lake Hospital, Doctors Kennedy and McBride and especially Doctor Sonnichen for his continued care of Dad over the past several years.\n\nA Celebration of life for Joe will be held on February 16, 2019 from 1 pm - 3 pm at the Hume Hotel, 422 Vernon Street Nelson, B.C., V1L 4E5, 250-352-5331.\n\nWe, Joe's children, invite you to come and share an afternoon of stories, adventures and memories of Joe. Over the years he sure shared enough of his own and now we want to hear yours!\n\nLight refreshments with be served. No host bar"
