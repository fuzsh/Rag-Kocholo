        "text": "Neither the bills of sale nor the deposition reveal how Hackett arrived in Fayetteville or how Jacob Cartwright came to own him, but they do make clear that Hackett was born around 1817 and that the white people of Fayetteville knew him only as “Nelson.” Why, when, and how he took the last name Hackett, which he used to describe himself in Canada, remains unknown.\n\nThe little that is known of Hackett’s physical appearance and demeanor comes from accounts of his flight from Fayetteville and legal documents related to his extradition from Canada. A reporter for the Peoria Register and North-Western Gazette, who crossed paths with Hackett on his return to Fayetteville in May 1842, offered the most detailed description of the fugitive and his flight. The journalist described Hackett as “handsomely formed, about 30 years old, of very prepossessing address,” adding that he “wore his hair nicely combed, was genteelly clad, and was in short a negro dandy.” That Hackett signed depositions in Canada with an “X” suggests that he, like most enslaved people, was unable to write.\n\nAlfred Wallace and the abolitionists provide differing accounts of Hackett’s escape from Arkansas. Both parties knew that Canada would not return Hackett for simply escaping slavery and tailored their accounts to emphasize or deemphasize Hackett’s alleged thefts. Wallace, who admitted to leaving Hackett unsupervised for “two or three weeks” at a time, testified that on or about July 17, 1841, Hackett stole several items before fleeing Fayetteville. The thefts included a gold watch from the home of a neighbor, Onesimus Evans, and “one roan Mare, aged ___, branded with figure 2 on her left foreshoulder, and also one blue beaver over-coat, the body and collar of which were lined and faced with black silk velvet, and also a quantity of Mexican Silver, and Gold of the coin of the United States, of the value of 100 £” from the Wallace home. Wallace initially claimed that Hackett had raped a white woman before the thefts and escape, but he ultimately dropped the claim, offering no evidence to the Washington County Grand Jury or Canadian authorities that such a crime occurred. Abolitionists, though, portrayed the thefts as incidental to Hackett’s escape. According to Charles H. Stewart, a white abolitionist who interviewed the fugitive in Detroit, Hackett had accompanied Wallace to a horse race “a considerable distance” from Fayetteville. Wallace did not return home but directed Hackett to take the horse and other items back. Instead of heading to Fayetteville, Hackett made his escape. As Stewart wrote, “Hackett finding himself well mounted, under circumstances that permitted absence, directed his course towards liberty . . . . At the time he had in care the outside coat of his master, and he also had his gold watch.” Both accounts are problematic. Wallace admitted to being out of town at the time of Hackett’s escape, not returning to Fayetteville until July 24, but nonetheless he testified under oath about what happened. Stewart never accounts for why Wallace would be travelling with a fur coat in Arkansas in July.\n\nWallace Brothers\n\nWhile little is known about Hackett’s life in Fayetteville, more is known about the lives of Jacob Cartwright and the Wallace brothers, though little of it touches directly on the life of Nelson Hackett or even slaveholding. In the summer of 1840, the very time that ownership of Hackett passed from Cartwright to Willis Wallace to Alfred Wallace, the town was in the final throes of what one participant called the “Fayetteville War.” The Wallace brothers led one faction in the conflict, while minister-turned-lawyer Alfred Arrington and Cherokees associated with the Treaty Party formed the other. Although it certainly built upon longstanding animosity, the Fayetteville War began in June 1839 when Willis Wallace stabbed and killed Nelson Orr, a Cherokee passing through Fayetteville on the Trail of Tears on his way to the Indian Territory. A grand jury, headed by Alfred Wallace and including Cartwright, refused to charge Willis Wallace in Orr’s death. Later that year, after Willis Wallace killed another man on the streets of Fayetteville, Arrington went to the Indian Territory and returned with a force of over thirty armed men determined to bring Willis Wallace to justice. The Wallace brothers assembled a force of their own at their grocery on Fayetteville Square and deployed the town’s cannon to confront Arrington and his allies. Cooler heads ultimately prevailed, and the confrontation ended without more bloodshed, but the town remained tense for several years as low-level violence and fears of Cherokees roiled the population. It remains unknown if Nelson Hackett was among those who took up arms to defend Willis Wallace during the troubles.\n\nIt is not clear if Hackett’s sale to the Wallace brothers was related in any way to the Fayetteville War, but the Wallace brothers’ main antagonist, Alfred Arrington, penned the most detailed description of the Wallace brothers: “[Riley Wallace, the youngest] was exceeding cruel without being brave; always ready to fight, but never to fight fairly . . . . Alfred was of a similar character; perhaps he was more intrepid in spirit; but he was less dreaded in that country than either of the others, on account of another strong propensity in his nature, that partially neutralized its excessive destructiveness—he had inordinate acquisitiveness. . . . itchingly avaricious! . . . . [Willis] was wholly a creature of passionate impulses.”\n\nArrington’s account of the Fayetteville War also provides the only description of any of the Wallace brothers’ interactions with enslaved people. It involves Willis. After murdering a groom at an altar in Georgia, Willis escaped with the help of two enslaved men who were waiting nearby: “with a calm step, he [Willis Wallace] left the room, walked deliberately to the large gate, some hundred paces from the door, mounted his horse, which was there held ready for him, by two of his father’s negroes, who had been waiting his return, with three large double-barrel shot-guns, one of which he took in his hand, cocked both barrels, and they all three rode away at a brisk gallop.” Although Arrington did not witness the episode and exaggerated events to sell books, he understood the Wallace brothers as people who entrusted enslaved men with weapons and depended upon them in a fight.\n\nPersonal Record Book, Washington County Courthouse, Fayetteville, AR\n\nBills of sale for “a certain negro boy named Nelson about twenty four years of age” at the Washington County courthouse.\n\nA brother [James Burr] from the [Mission] institute having been in Missouri, saw some slaves who longed for freedom, and agreed to help them across the Mississippi river. On the twelfth of July, in company with him and another brother [George Thompson], I started for the place appointed. James and I walked four or five miles back into the country. The first human being that we saw was a woman and her son hoeing tobacco. James spoke to her, and walked on. He found that she wanted to be free and agreed to help her. We next came to a house. James went in and learned from a slave, the whites being absent, that the slaves he had seen before were in the field alone. We went to them, it being now sunset. We asked them if they were going; they told us they were, and that one living a mile from them, where they had some clothes to get, was going with them, and that they would come three hours after dark. We were seen by white men while with the slaves. After dark we came and waited, anxiously listening for the signal. After some time we heard a distant whistle, and by answering repeatedly soon came to five slaves, three fourths or four fifths of a mile from the river, on a bottom prairie. After salutations and professions, we started in a foot path for the river, rejoicing in the prospect of helping the oppressed to liberty and happiness.\n\nAlthough none of the extensive documentation of the arrest and imprisonment of Thompson, Burr, and Work explicitly mention Hackett, Work’s jail diary celebrated the escape of many fugitives at the time Hackett would have been in the area. On July 26, 1841, for instance, Work wrote: “we overheard a conversation, by which we learned that six slaves had crossed the Mississippi the night before, and that some persons appeared preparing to go to the river to intercept other fugitives.” It could very well be that Hackett was among the six who had crossed on July 25 or the others trying to do so on the next day.\n\nJust as Hackett knew to flee to Marion City, his pursuers recognized that it was the place he would most likely try to cross the Mississippi. Alfred Wallace had dispatched George Grigg to track Hackett and bring him back to Fayetteville in order “to show his fellow slaves that there was no security for them in Canada.” Grigg, though, could not follow the fugitive’s trail across Missouri, but he picked it up in Marion City. In the words of the Peoria Register, “No trace of him [Hackett] could be found until the officers got to Marion City.”\n\nuntrustworthy. The petition concluded that, if Hackett were returned to Arkansas, he would “be tortured in a manner that to hang him at once would be mercy,” a punishment far too harsh for the alleged crime. Hiram Wilson, an American evangelical ministering to the fugitive community in the Toronto area, later insisted that if Thomson had lived long enough to consider the fugitive’s plea that Hackett would have most certainly been emancipated.\n\nOn the same day that Hackett petitioned to be released, September 18, 1841, Alfred Wallace began the formal extradition process by convincing the acting governor of Michigan to request that the Province of Canada return Hackett to the United States. The next day, September 19, Governor General Thomson died, creating a situation in which no one had the authority or the willingness to act. The province’s attorney general bought some time by recommending that the acting governor general reject the Michigan application, insisting that any extradition request would need to come from either the United States government or Arkansas’s governor and be based on formal charges made by a grand jury. This prompted Wallace to return to Arkansas to secure the necessary documents. There Wallace got what he needed, indictments of Hackett on charges of “Grand Larceny” from a Washington County grand jury and a formal request for extradition from Arkansas governor Archibald Yell.\n\nThe acting governor general then asked the Province of Canada’s Executive Council—a cabinet that advised the governor general—to weigh in on the matter. An Executive Council committee reviewed the petitions and depositions and recommended to the incoming governor general, Charles Bagot, that Hackett be sent back to Arkansas. The Executive Council followed the precedent set in 1829 that a fugitive could only be returned for an offense that would have made him liable to arrest in Canada—being a fugitive from slavery was not a crime in Canada but theft was. The Executive Council concluded that there was sufficient evidence to charge Hackett “had the offence wherewith he is charged been committed in this Province” and that he should be sent back to Arkansas “to be dealt with according to the law.”\n\n​In Princeton on the night of May 12, 1842, or thereabouts, Nelson Hackett escaped and remained at large for two nights before he was recaptured. Like Marion City and Quincy, Princeton was a center of Underground Railroad activity, much of it revolving around the white abolitionist Owen Lovejoy who had moved to the town in 1838. Lovejoy, while serving in Congress in the late 1850s, boasted of his longstanding efforts to assist those fleeing slavery on their way through Princeton: “Owen Lovejoy…aids every fugitive that comes to his door and asks it. Proclaim it then from the housetops. Write it on every leaf that trembles in the forest, make it blaze from the sun at high noon…I bid you defiance in the name of my God!” Hackett’s captors, perhaps aware of the town’s reputation, isolated him from the townspeople. The account in the Peoria Register noted, “Care was taken to keep Nelson as secluded from observation as possible, and he had no converse with a single person in Princeton.”\n\nIt is not clear if Hackett knew of Princeton’s reputation, sensed his captors’ anxiety, or just felt that the town just afforded him the last best chance of freedom, but that night he escaped. Before the seven men went to sleep in a second story room of a tavern, Hackett’s captors made sure that the windows and doors were secured, but one of the men woke at about 3:00 am to discover that Hackett had freed himself from his hobble and fled through a window. The Peoria Register explained, “The jump from the window was by no means perilous, it being but 10 to 12 feet to the ground, but everything else connected with his escape is a mystery.” The paper speculated that Hackett might have somehow been aided by one of the New York travelers but admitted that there was no evidence that that had happened."
