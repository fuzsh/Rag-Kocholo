In Seychelles, there are three official languages: English, French, and Creole. Creole is the local dialect used by Seychellois for everyday communication. In general, you will be understood in any of these languages, whether it's English or French. However, French is slightly more common in Seychelles.

So, when you visit Seychelles, consider having a French phrasebook with pronunciation on hand. It will help you navigate the islands more comfortably. It's advisable to download and print a Russian-French phrasebook in advance, as you might not easily find one in local stores. A few useful phrases in French can greatly enhance your travel experience.
