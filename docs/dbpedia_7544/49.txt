Languages in Seychelles

The most widely spoken language in the entire Indian Ocean islands is Creole and it is considered to be Seychellesâ€™ lingua franca. As a first language by most Seychellois, the language is used extensively throughout schools, governance and even in media. English is also taught in schools. A small portion of the population has English as the first language. It is also an official language in business and governance. In order to facilitate tourism effectively, most people involved in tourism are able to speak English. More than a third of the population speaks English.

The Creole language is a combination of the French language with words and syntax of African and Asian languages that were spoken by the slaves. Although it is based from the French language spoken in the 1700s, it bears little resemblance to the modern French now.

The 3rd official language in the country is French. Since the first immigrants of the islands were the French after the French colonists left the territory, the language has not retained its original form. It was the language used by the Roman Catholic Church, and now, the older people utilize French in correspondence and some formal occasions. About a small percentage of the population use French language as a means to communicate to fellow countrymen. Some of the televised programs are in French. The term Seychellois is often commonly referred to people who can speak the 3 official languages.

The people of Seychelles are very serious in their language. They have put up the Creole Institute in the capital city of Victoria to promote Creole literature, language and culture. The government increased its emphasis on Creole as they are hoping to establish a distinct culture and heritage. The government also sponsored course materials to teach foreigners the Creole language.
