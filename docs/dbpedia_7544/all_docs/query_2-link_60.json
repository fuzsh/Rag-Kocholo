        "text": "Country description\n\nThe Seychelles is a tropical island paradise, an archipelago of 115 islands located northeast of Madagascar in the western Indian Ocean. The country is divided into two primary island groups: the Mahé Group, which consists of over 40 granitic islands characterized by mountainous terrain and lush tropical vegetation, and the Outer Islands, composed of over 70 flatter coralline islands and atolls with unique ecosystems.\n\nThe Seychelles has a rich history. Known earlier to Arab traders, the first Europeans to document the uninhabited Seychelles were the British in 1609. France later claimed the islands in 1756, naming them after King Louis XV's finance minister, Jean Moreau de Séchelles. After a series of skirmishes, the Seychelles fell under British control in 1814, formally ceded by the Treaty of Paris. The Seychelles gained independence from Britain in 1976, becoming a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. Post-independence, Seychelles experienced a period as a socialist one-party state from 1977 to 1993, before a new constitution in 1993 brought about multi-party democracy in the islands.\n\nDespite being one of Africa's smallest countries, Seychelles boasts a relatively high-income economy according to the World Bank. The country relies heavily on tourism as its economic cornerstone, with tourism directly contributing over 26% of the GDP in 2019 according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. The Seychellois people are a vibrant blend of European, African, and Asian descent, which is expressed in Seselwa, the French-based Creole language, as well as in the nation's cuisine, music, and dance. Seychelles is also recognized internationally for conservation efforts, protecting almost half of its land territory and boasting two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Aldabra Atoll and the Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve.\n\nWorkforce description\n\nThe Seychelles workforce is relatively small, with an estimated labor force of approximately 53,700 in 2020. The country is experiencing an aging population trend, similar to many developed nations, which could potentially lead to a future decrease in labor force size. However, the workforce has a relatively balanced gender ratio, with women making up a significant portion of employment.\n\nIn terms of skill levels, Seychelles boasts an adult literacy rate of over 95%, reflecting a well-educated population. There has been significant investment in developing vocational skills, particularly in sectors like tourism and hospitality. Despite this, the Seychelles still experiences skills gaps in certain specialized areas like technology and engineering, and relies on foreign workers to fill some of these positions.\n\nThe service industry is the largest employer in the Seychelles, with tourism and related sectors such as hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies being primary job creators. Government and public administration also hold a significant share of employment. While less prominent than in the past, fishing and agriculture sectors still contribute to employment, especially in the Outer Islands. The Seychelles is also seeking to diversify its economy with efforts in the \"Blue Economy\", focusing on sustainable use of ocean resources, as well as in financial services and Information and Communications Technology (ICT).\n\nCultural norms impacting employment\n\nIn Seychelles, the relaxed island lifestyle significantly impacts the approach to work. While dedication is valued, there's less emphasis on working extremely long hours compared to some other cultures. Seychellois culture also prioritizes family and community connections, which may lead to flexible work arrangements to accommodate family obligations and social events.\n\nCommunication Styles\n\nBuilding rapport is crucial before diving into business discussions in Seychelles. Seychellois generally favor a friendly and personable communication style. Direct criticism can be considered impolite in Seychellois culture, so managers may use a more nuanced approach when providing feedback or handling workplace issues. While English is the official language for business, Seychellois Creole is commonly spoken. Understanding basic Creole phrases shows respect and helps connect with colleagues.\n\nOrganizational Hierarchies\n\nTraces of Seychelles' colonial past and the respect for elders linger in workplaces. It's common to find greater formality in dealings with superiors compared to Western cultures. While there might be a clear hierarchy, major decisions in Seychellois businesses often involve discussions aimed at arriving at a consensus. According to a cross-national study on cultural values, the Seychelles leans slightly more towards the collectivistic side than individualistic cultures.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that these are broad generalizations. Individual personalities and workplaces in Seychelles, especially those within multinational companies, may exhibit a mixture of traditional and more globalized work norms.\n\nKey industries and employment sectors\n\nTourism remains the uncontested powerhouse of the Seychelles economy, encompassing hotels and resorts, restaurants and catering, transportation, tour operators and travel agencies, and recreational and cultural activities. Another established core sector is fishing and fish processing, with industrial tuna fishing being a key source of export revenue. Smaller-scale fishing and fish processing support local markets and the tourism industry, while aquaculture is expanding to meet rising demand. The public sector is also a major employer in Seychelles, with jobs in public administration, education, and healthcare.\n\nEmerging and Growth Sectors\n\nSeychelles is actively promoting sustainable ocean-based economic activities, known as the Blue Economy. This includes sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, marine renewable energy, and ecotourism and marine conservation. The country has also positioned itself as an offshore financial center, offering company registration, banking services, and investment management. Seychelles aims to develop its Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector as a knowledge hub, including software development, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and digital services.\n\nNotes on Employment\n\nThe tourism industry provides the most significant direct and indirect employment in Seychelles. Emerging sectors like the Blue Economy and ICT hold promise for new job creation and economic diversification."
