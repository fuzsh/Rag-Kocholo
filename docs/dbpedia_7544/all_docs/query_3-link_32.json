Neo-Darwinian Creolistics: Whence and whereto? A sketch\n\nThe main goal of this essay is to constructively deconstruct the age-old myth that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\" and to demystify the methodological (mis)practices that underlie this myth and its corollaries throughout Creole studies and beyond.\n\nI start with some notes on historiography and methodology, connecting certain trends in 20th and 21st century creolistics to outdated (quasi) Darwinian concepts in early 19th-century comparative-historical linguistics. Then I move to linguistics per se, inspecting the empirical and theoretical bases of creolists' foundational assumptions about Creole diachrony and synchrony. This will (re-)establish the epistemological limits of certain key terms in Creole studies, including \"pidgin(ization)\", \"creole/creolization\", \"young\" vs. \"old\", \"simple(st)\" vs. \"(most) complex\", etc. I will argue that these terms, although perhaps useful as a-theoretical heuristics and as sociohistorical approximations, cannot serve as theoretically-grounded linguistic-structural taxa: Given Universal Grammar and its Cartesian-Uniformitarian foundations (Chomsky 1966, 1981, 1986, 1995, etc.), there cannot be any invariant and sui generis set of structures and processes that fall under the labels \"Creole\" and \"creolization\". Assuming Universal Grammar (UG), creolization reduces at the individual level to the same sort of cognitive processes that underlie idiolect formation through language change, and so are Creole languages aprioristically undistinguishable from non-Creole languages--that is, there is no synchronic Creole typology that excludes non-Creole languages. As I show below, such claims go against the grain of the most ancient and the (still) most prevalent dogma in Creole studies.\n\n1.1 Historiography and Epistemology: From Schleicher to Popper\n\nMy essay is best introduced by the following quotes from Schleicher (1863), Saint-Quentin (1872) and Adam (1883) on simple(st) grammars and from Osthoff & Brugmann (1878), Foucault (1972) and Popper (1965) on methodology. The first two sets of quotes ((1)-(2)) are words from the past and the last three ((3)-(5)) are words of caution for the future, and all five are relevant to linguists' time-honored search for simplest grammars. These quotes speak for themselves, and eloquently so.\n\n1.1.1 (Pre-)Darwinian linguistics: Schleicher (1863) on the `Tree of Language'\n\n(1)\n\na.\n\n\"THE RULES NOW, WHICH DARWIN LAYS DOWN WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIES OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS, ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO THE ORGANISM OF LANGUAGES, THAT IS TO SAY, AS FAR AS THE MAIN FEATURES [OF DARWIN'S THEORY] ARE CONCERNED.\"\n\n(Schleicher 1863 [1869: 30], emphasis in original; also see 1869: 16-17)\n\nb.\n\n\"The construction of all languages points to this, that the eldest forms were in reality alike or similar; and those less complex forms are preserved in some idioms of the simplest kind, as, for example, Chinese. ... In this remote stage of the life of speech, there is consequently no distinction ... between verbs and nouns; there is neither declension nor conjugation.\" 1 (Schleicher 1863 [1869: 51])\n\nc.\n\n\"[L]anguage is of significance not only for the elaboration of a scientific [i.e., taxonomic] systematization of humanity, but also for the evolutionary history of man. ... [T]he various stages of languages are to be considered as the perceptible, characteristic traits of various grades of man. ... Now language has revealed itself to science as something that has evolved very gradually ... The comparative anatomy of languages shows that the more highly organized languages evolved very gradually out of simpler language organisms, probably in the course of very long time spans.\"\n\n(Schleicher 1863 [1869: 79])\n\n1.1.2 Neo-Darwinian creolistics: Saint-Quentin (1872) and Adam (1883) on simple(st) languages\n\nNeo-Darwinian creolistics: Saint-Quentin (1872) and Adam (1883) on simple(st) languages\n\n(2)\n\na.\n\n\"[Creole grammar] is, therefore, a spontaneous product of the human mind, freed from any kind of intellectual culture. ... [W]hen one studies its structure, one is so very surprised, so very charmed by its rigor and simplicity that one wonders if the creative genius of the most knowledgeable linguists would have been able to give birth to anything that so completely reaches its goal, that imposes so little strain on memory and that calls for so little effort from those with limited intelligence. An in-depth analysis has convinced me of something that seems paradoxical. Namely: if one wanted to create ab ovo an all-purpose language that would allow, after only a few days of study, a clear and consistent exchange of simple ideas, one would not be able to adopt more logical and more productive structures than those found in Creole grammar.\"\n\n(Saint-Quentin 1872 [1989, 40-41]; my translation)\n\nb.\n\n\"[Cayenne Creole] grammar ... is nothing but the grammar that is common to the languages of GuinÃ©e. The latter we can call langues naturelles as opposed to langues cultivÃ©es. For the botanist, plants that are naturelles are superior to plants that are cultivÃ©es to the extent that the former are pristine products that are free of intentional adulteration. Likewise, for the linguist, the speech of peoples considered primitive has primacy over the speech of civilized peoples: the former is closer to the sort of grammatical instincts of which children's utterances reveal processes that are simple, logical and fast. ... [Cayenne Creole] grammar is more naturelle than that of Sanskrit, Latin and French. But this grammar did not spontaneously emerge in Guyane; it was imported from Africa. ... \"\n\n(Adam 1883: 4-5; my translation) 2\n\n\"In reality, the Malagasy slaves [who created Mauritian Creole] have brought along to Mauritius their native grammar, but not the forms that I have previously mentioned [inflectional gender marking, inflectional plural marking on verbs, the avoir (`to have') auxiliary , the verbal copula]. These forms are the product of an evolution that has not happened in the Polynesian and Melanasian Languages. In dealing with such forms, Malagasy speakers kept their native grammar ... In Mauritius, this native grammar reasserted its influence. ... \"\n\n(Adam 1883: 7; my translation)\n\n1.1.3 On Cartesian-Uniformitarian linguistics: The Neogrammarians\n\n(3)\n\na.\n\n\"These [methodological] principles are based on a two-fold concept, whose truth is immediately obvious: first, that language is not a thing which leads a life of its own outside of and above human beings, but that it has its true existence only in the individual, and hence that all changes in the life of a language can only proceed from the individual speaker; and second, that the mental and physical activity of man must have been at all times essentially the same when he acquired a language inherited from his ancestors and reproduced and modified the speech forms which had been absorbed into his consciousness.\"\n\n(Osthoff & Brugmann 1878 [1967: 204])\n\nb.\n\n\"If someone could once and for all manage to get rid of these generally harmful expressions \"youth\" and \"old age\" of languages! These and many others in themselves quite innocent grammatical terms have so far been almost exclusively a curse, hardly a blessing. For the child who was born in Greece in the Homeric age, who became aware of the speech forms of his linguistic community by hearing them, and who then reproduced them in order to make himself understood by his fellow men--for that child were these speech forms ancient?\n\n(Osthoff & Brugmann 1878 [1967: 205-206])\n\n1.1.4 Foucault (1972) on \"chimera and reverie\" in linguistics\n\n(4)\n\n\"Suffice it to recall that the quest for primitive language, a perfectly acceptable theme up to the eighteenth century, was enough, in the second half of the nineteenth century, to throw any discourse into, I hesitate to say error, but into a world of chimera and reverie--into pure and simple linguistic monstrosity.\"\n\n(Foucault 1972: 223)\n\n1.1.5 Popper (1965) on (criticisms of) myths as science\n\n(5)\n\n\"Thus science must begin with myths, and with ... the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. ... The critical attitude, the tradition of free discussion of theories with the aim of discovering their weak spots so that they may be improved upon, is the attitude of reasonableness, of rationality. It makes far-reaching use of both verbal argument and observation--of observation in the interest of argument, however.\"\n\n(Popper 1965: 50)\n\n1.2 Schleicherian roots of Language and route to progress: From isolating to agglutinative to inflectional/fusional\n\nTaken together, the quotes in (1)-(5) suggest that the search for \"the world's simplest grammars\" has been going on for quite a while, and so has the dogma that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\". This search for \"simplest grammars\" is part of a larger search for, and larger myths about, the origins and evolution of our species. This search seems driven by an apparently innate drive to (in Schleicher's phrase) \"classify humanity\".\n\nSchleicher's Glottik is linguistics as natural history. By definition, its morphological taxonomy of languages qua organisms is regulated by universal natural laws and reducible to the genealogical mapping of their teleological development toward \"idioms of higher organization\" (Schleicher 1850, 1863, 1865; etc).\n\nIn the intellectual climate of early 19th-century, Schleicher's pre-Darwinian language-as-organism evolutionary approach belonged to the \"normal science\" of his period (\"normal\" in the Kuhnian sense). In retrospect, Schleicher's Glottik can be viewed as one of the central myths that gave vigor, status and popularity to comparative-historical linguistics (see Hoenigswald & Wiener 1987 and Alter 1999 for comprehensive overviews and, specially, for an array of positions similar to Schleicher's through much of the 19th century and beyond).\n\nAt the core of Schleicher's language-as-organism evolutionary hypothesis was a then-attractive congruence between, on the one hand, the simple-to-complex Darwinian evolution of biological organisms from \"one-celled organisms\" to \"higher living being\" and, on the other hand, the postulated historical progression of languages, through variation and subspeciation, from isolating to agglutinative to inflectional/fusional (Schleicher 1863 [1869: 50-60]; also see Schleicher 1850 [1852: 6-13]). In the Schleicherian organic school, linguistic evolution, on a par with biological evolution, was to be modeled by a \"tree of life\", a Stammbaumtheorie--a genealogical (\"family\" tree) diagram depicting phylogenetic relationships, with (at most) one parent for each daughter node. 3\n\nSchleicher tries to establish his morphology-as-biology congruence by, inter alia, metaphorically taking the \"simple cell\" and the \"simple root\" as \"the common primitive forms\" of biological and linguistic evolution, respectively (Schleicher 1863 [1869: 55]). More explicitly, Schleicher takes \"the radical elements [i.e., isolating root morphemes] as the cells of [prototypical primitive] speech\" (1863 [1869: 53], emphasis as in original) and posits an isolating proto-language--one made up exclusively of affixless roots--at the evolutionary beginning of each language phylum. The proto-language's monomorphemic words are the linguistic analogues of the \"one-celled organisms\" at the roots of biological evolution. Thus, Chinese with its tendency toward isolating morphology is most primitive while Sanskrit with its inflectional/fusional morphology is most advanced since, according to Schleicher et al, inflectional/fusional morphology marks the highest degree of complexity and perfection (see (1b) and (2b); also see Schleicher 1850). It is thus that morphology--inflectional morphology, in particular--has long served as the chief measure of evolutionary progress and/or structural complexity (but see note 1 ). 4 Related measures are found in 20th- and 21st-century linguistics, as in the works of (e.g.) Jespersen 1922: 233-234; Whinnom 1971: 109-110; Samarin 1980: 221; Seuren & Wekker 1986; Bickerton 1988: 274-276; Comrie 1992: 208-209; Seuren 1998: 292-293; McWhorter 1998, 2000a,b, 2001; etc (cf. note 6 ; see Chaudenson 1994 and DeGraff 2001 for overviews and critiques).\n\nTime (i.e., language age) is a critical factor in Schleicherian models of linguistic complexity. In such genealogical-cum-teleological approaches to the linguistic systema naturae, time is built-in as a pre-requisite for the development of complexity in both biological and linguistic evolution: complexity qua \"higher organization\" takes \"very long time spans\" to evolve (see (1c)). Thus, the following three related propositions:\n\n(6)\n\na.\n\nComplex species (i.e., those more advanced in the evolutionary hierarchy, connoting greater perfection) must be relatively old. 5\n\nb.\n\nYoung languages and the early ancestors of old languages are necessarily simple (i.e., more primitive in the evolutionary hierarchy).\n\nc.\n\nThe youngest/earliest languages are the simplest (i.e., most primitive).\n\nIn the domain of Language, the hypothetical original species--Schleicher's ultimate Ursprachen--have had no time to evolve any complexity; thus they are located at the prototypical primitive stage (i.e., the isolating/affixless stage) while \"languages of a higher organization [e.g., Indo-Germanic] have arisen from simpler forms, through a process of gradual development\" (Schleicher 1863 [1869: 50]). It is in this vein that Schleicher (1865 [1983: 79]) takes language to be \"of significance not only for the elaboration of a scientific [i.e., taxonomic] systematization of humanity, but also for the evolutionary history of man\" (cf. note 4 ).\n\n1.3 A foundational myth: Creoles as contemporary Ursprachen\n\n\"Systematization of humanity\" via linguistic structures and (alleged) lack thereof is also found at the very inception of creolistics and throughout its existence. Creolists' own `classic' systematization is based on the age-old orthodoxy that Creole morphology is EXTRAORDINARILY simple or simplified from a diachronic and/or synchronic perspective. 6\n\nIn the 17th-19th centuries, such orthodoxy had explicitly \"race\"-based underpinnings. One taken-for-granted piece of \"normal science\" (in Kuhn's terminology) revolved around the notion that non-whites were inferior human beings, and so was non-whites' speech considered inferior to whites' speech. For candidate (perhaps ambiguous) illustrations of such beliefs, see the works of early creolists such as Pelleprat 1655, Saint-Quentin 1872 (see (2a)), Baissac 1880, Adam 1883 (see (2b)), along with 18th/19th-century dictionary and encyclopedia entries for the word \"Creole\" (see, e.g., Pierre Larousse's 1869 Grand Dictionnaire Universel du XIX SiÃ¨cle and Vinson's entry in the 1889 Dictionnaire des sciences anthropologiques). In such works, the distinctive features of Creoles were not due to socio-historical factors only, but they were also taken to reflect the inferiority of their (non-European) speakers. The latter were deemed to be cognitively unable to master the \"complexities\" of European languages. Per this orthodoxy, \"primitive\" people spoke \"primitive\" languages (see 3.1; cf. (2) and note 35 ).\n\n1.4 Toward Cartesian-Uniformitarian creolistics\n\nAt the turn of the 19th-century the Neogrammarians, while adopting Schleicher's seminal insights in comparative-historical methodology (e.g., with respect to the reconstruction of unattested proto-forms), fought hard to get rid of his excessively organic and teleological metaphors. The Neogrammarians' stated goal was to understand Language and language change through the study of variation among (related) idiolects and through the study of universal laws (e.g., sound-change laws) that are ultimately rooted in the psychology and physiology of individual speakers. This was a shift of interest from the reconstruction of Ursprachen from archives to the analysis of contemporary idiolects in vivo (i.e., as manifested in individual speech). For Neogrammarians (see (3)), grammars live in speaker's minds, not in society; thus, the study of individual grammars as manifestations of \"psychical [i.e., psychological] organism\" should take epistemological priority over \"Historical Grammar\" (i..e, \"descriptive grammars of different periods ... tacked together\"): only the former is truly \"scientific\" (see Paul 1890 [1970: xxxvii,xliii,1-19]). As Osthoff and Brugmann 1878 [1967: 198] put it, what needed correction is the methodology whereby \"[l]anguages were indeed investigated most eagerly, but the man who speaks, much too little\".\n\nContinuing this \"Cartesian\" (i.e., universalist and mentalist) trend into the 20th-century, Boas and his students, including Sapir, assumed both the existence of language universals, the \"psychological reality\" of idiolects and the independence of phenotypes, language and culture across humanity (see, e.g., Boas 1911: 11; Sapir 1921: ix,207ff). Both Boas and Sapir reacted strongly against the sort of Romantic ethnocentrism inherent in Schleicherian correlations between morphology, age and complexity. About the (non-)rapport between linguistic morphological types and cultural evolution, Sapir wrote:\n\n(7)\n\n\"[A]ll attempts to connect particular types of linguistic morphology with certain correlated stages of cultural development are vain. Rightly understood, such correlations are rubbish. Both simple and complex types of language of an indefinite number of varieties may be found spoken at any desired level of cultural advance. When it comes to linguistic form, Plato walks with the Macedonian swineherd, Confucius with the head-hunting savage of Assam.\" (Sapir 1921: 219)\n\nSapir's view is robustly supported by cross-linguistic evidence both within and across genetic phyla, among languages of similar and dissimilar time depths (e.g., English, Icelandic, German, Chinese, Wampanoag, Kivunjo and Nicaraguan Sign Language). In a related observation, Thomason (1980) pointedly notes that inflectional morphology can vary greatly within single genetic groupings, as in Indo-European:\n\n(8)\n\n\"[T]he general pattern of development from flexional to isolating morphology is well known. But this progression is much more advanced in some branches of the family than others, and the least elaborate inflectional systems in modern Indo-European languages--those of the western European languages, say--bear little resemblance to the most elaborate systems, such as noun declension in most Balto-Slavic languages. It is not just a matter of a reduction in the number of cases or gender distinctions; often, the categories themselves have changed.\" (Thomason 1980: 361)\n\nSapir's and Thomason's observations are worth keeping in mind throughout the discussion in this paper.\n\nThe Schleicherian genealogical classification of language by age cum complexity loses further grounding with the advent of Chomsky's \"Cartesian Linguistics\" in the second half of the 20th-century (see, e.g., Chomsky 1966, 1981, 1986, 1995). As in the Neogrammarian dogma in (3), grammars are inherently parts of human biology, not autonomous living organisms that undergo birth, age, senility and death independently of their speakers. Generative linguistics' objects of study are, in Cartesian mode, internal properties of individual minds (i.e., mental grammars qua I(NTERNAL)-LANGUAGES). Thus, generative linguistics is \"internalist biolinguistic inquiry\" (Chomsky 1995: 1-11, 2001: 41-42) and is intrinsically Uniformitarian (cf. Descartes's assumption that \"reason is by nature equal in all men\" and Descartes's notion of knowledge as mental representations; see Chomsky 1966 for relevant discussion).\n\nPer current assumptions in biology, the basic morphology of the human brain is uniform across the species. It has thus become more difficult, if not impossible, to theoretically correlate biological evolution with cross-linguistic variation, unless one adopts a quasi-Lamarckian view of language change whereby cross-linguistic typology can be reduced to genetic variation across human groupings. In this quasi-Lamarckian scenario, language-specific structures (e.g., isolating vs. agglutinative vs. inflectional/fusional morphology) would be correlated with variations in the human genetic blueprint. This is not a likely scenario given current results in language acquisition and biology: linguistic structures do not evolve and are not transmitted like DNA. 7\n\n1.5 Back to Schleicher(ian creolistics)'s Ursprachen\n\nNotwithstanding current advances in Cartesian and Uniformitarian (bio)linguistics, there is a sense in which Schleicher's approach has survived the 19th century into the 20th and now 21st century, albeit under new theoretical guise. While modern linguistics is making steady advances in its exploration of our intrinsically human and species-uniform Universal Grammar (UG), \"creolistics\" has kept up, and even revived, early 19th-century notions of language evolution. Indeed, creolistics is perhaps the only field where the search for a genealogical and typological class of \"simplest grammars\" is still at the center of contemporary research. It is thus that certain trends in creolistics are reviving Schleicher's Glottik with Creole languages as the new class of youngest, thus structurally simplest, linguistic species. In this modern Glottik, Creole languages are living specimens of Ursprachen (i.e., contemporary proto-languages--\"the world's only instantiation of spoken language having been \"born again\"\" in McWhorter's (Â§2.3) evangelical phrase).\n\nHowever, an empirically and theoretically grounded implementation of the claim that the world's simplest and/or most optimal grammars are Creole grammars still constitutes the holy grail of creolists through an un-broken lineage of research programs (see note 6 ). In the 20th and 21st century, starting with (e.g.) Jespersen 1922 and up to McWhorter 2001, linguists have used morphosyntax to try and identify sufficient and necessary conditions that would make Creoles deeply special in a structural and synchronic sense. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of these contemporary observations on Creole morphosyntax are quite reminiscent of those encountered in 17-19th century texts. (See DeGraff 2001b: 88-98 for further details). For example, consider the statement that \"creoles are natural languages reborn from a radical reduction of their source languages into makeshift jargon\" (McWhorter 2001: Â§4). This statement finds direct antecedents throughout Creole studies, from its very inception (see note 6 ).\n\nAn explicit quantification for the alleged maximal simplicity of Creole grammars is offered in McWhorter 2001. Even though it makes no reference to Schleicher, McWhorter's recent work (1998, 2000a,b, 2001) is, of late, the most sustained and perhaps most widely read effort to articulate a structural basis for Schleicherian linguistics, with the aim of categorizing languages according to some explicit complexity hierarchy. McWhorter tacitly assumes the Schleicherian dogma whereby linguistic typology must, at all costs, include a genealogically and structurally well-defined class of \"simplest grammars\". In his revamped complexity scheme, Prototypical Creoles are the new Ursprachen, languages created ab ovo from virtually \"ground zero\" complexity (McWhorter 2001: Â§4.4). This is somewhat reminiscent of Saint-Quentin's structural claims in (2a). Thus, McWhorter's hierarchy continues the Schleicherian tradition of putting certain languages (here Prototypical Creoles) in a deeply-special class of linguistic neonates--contemporary fossils of Language at its evolutionary incipience. In a nutshell, the argument is that: \"because so much of a grammar's complexity results from the operation of random accretion over time, creoles display less complexity than the rest of the world's natural languages\" (McWhorter 2001: Â§2.3).\n\nThe central assumptions here are (i) that Creole languages are markedly younger languages than non-Creoles; and (ii) that this age difference is linguistically measurable and significant, contra Osthoff & Brugmann's (1878) admonition in (3). These assumptions are related to THE foundational claims in Creole studies, namely the oft-repeated dualist statement that Creoles are \"non-genetic\" languages that emerge via an abnormal \"break in transmission\" whereas non-Creole languages gradually evolve \"genetically\" via \"normal transmission\" (the modern locus classicus for this claim is Thomason & Kaufman 1988: 8-12, 206 and passim); see 3.3 for discussion). In the classic Creole-genesis scenarios, Creole youth stems from the \"pidgin-to-creole life cycle\" as signaled by the concomitant morphological bottleneck (see references in 1.2 and in note 6 ). In the most recent exponent of this dogma, Creoles are \"born as pidgins, and thus stripped of almost all features unnecessary to communication\" (McWhorter 2001: Abstract).\n\n1.6 Toward Cartesian creolistics (redux): A guide for \"learning by debunking\"\n\nAs will become obvious through the development of the present critique, current research on Creoles as contemporary Ursprachen (e.g., McWhorter 2001--\"The world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\" (this volume)--hereafter abbreviated WSG 8 ) presents us with a \"modern\" collage of pre- and neo-Darwinian claims about language evolution. The antecedents of such claims go back to the structural-cum-genealogical speculations of (e.g.) Schleicher 1863 (see (1)) and Saint-Quentin 1872 (see (2a)). Thus, a full-fledged Popperian (see (5)) critique of (neo-)Schleicherian-cum-Quentinian creolistics can proceed via a close examination of the proposal in WSG about age-complexity correlations. This proposal conveniently provides us with an updated adaptation of linguistic-genealogical arguments that have run virtually uninterrupted through the past two centuries. A critique of this proposal will, I hope, clear up the scene for empirically-responsible and theoretically-grounded Cartesian-cum-Uniformitarian creolistics (i.e., the sort of creolistics that does not assume any a priori fundamental structural distinction between Creoles and non-Creoles). 9\n\nAs we'll see below, modern creolists' measures for age-complexity correlations--like their early 19th-century intellectual antecedents--amount to an empirically, theoretically and logically flawed view of Creole formation and language change. Bearing in mind that \"science must begin with the criticism of myths\", these re-formulations of Schleicherian linguistics provide a valuable point of departure for learning from our mistakes and for advancing our knowledge (in Popperian mode; see (5)). My critique will thus exemplify \"learning by debunking\" (in Gould's (1996: 351-353) terminology). Indeed I share in Umberto Eco's optimism in his book Serendipities where he so describes various brands of \"lunatic\" linguistics (cf. Foucault's allusion to \"chimera and reverie\" in (4)): \"[E]ven the most lunatic experiments can produce strange side effects, stimulating research that proves perhaps less amusing but scientifically more serious\" (Eco 1998: iix). 10 Here are the two \"serendipities\" to be derived from the discussion of neo-Darwinian (or neo-Schleicherian) creolistics below:\n\n1.\n\nestablish the epistemological limits of the terms \"pidgins\", \"creoles\", \"young\" vs. \"old\", \"simple(st)\" vs. \"(most) complex\" as linguistic-structural and historical-phylogenetic taxa;\n\n2.\n\npromote the study of language contact and its ubiquitous outcomes (including \"Creole genesis\") in a Cartesian and Uniformitarian analytical framework.\n\nFundamental to neo-Schleicherian arguments about Creoles' lack of complexity are the two notions \"pidgins\" and \"features unnecessary to [basic] communication\". These notions still remain ill-defined. I will argue in Section 4 that there can hardly be a core set of basic-communication features that defines the structural essence of ALL pidgins. As for the exclusively-Creole combination of structural features claimed to be \"predictable from the history of creoles in pidginization\", this typology will be argued to be deeply problematic, on both empirical and theoretical grounds (see Section 2 and references in note 12 ). Problematic as well, at least from a linguistic-theoretical standpoint, is the notion \"age of languages\": I will argue that thus far no well-defined and independent (i.e., testable and non-circular) LINGUISTIC metric can objectively measure the age of languages.\n\nYet it is the age of languages that in Creole studies is often taken (in a manner reminiscent of early nineteenth-century--Schleicherian--linguistics) as one crucial factor leading to complexity differentials between Creoles and non-Creoles. For neo-Schleicherians, Creoles' lesser complexity is yet another \"predictable result of their youth\" (see, e.g., WSG: Â§1), notwithstanding the fact that there is still no reliable litmus test for young languages as a linguistic class (see (7)-(8); also see Sections 3 and 6).\n\nWhat about \"complexity\" per se? Here too creolists enlist terminology and assumptions that will be shown to be ill-defined and empirically- and theoretically-controversial in fundamental ways. For examples, the \"complexity metric\" in WSG: Â§2.4 is theoretically peculiar: it is based on an arbitrary list of superficial linguistic features with no psychologically-relevant, theoretically-grounded or independently-motivated unifying bases. In fact, the conceptual foundations of this metric are either left undefined (along with, e.g., \"communicative necessity\", \"basic [human] communication\" and language \"age\") and/or are made largely incompatible or irrelevant to what we (seem to) know about linguistic typology, historical linguistics, language acquisition, language processing and theoretical linguistics (cf. WSG's interpretation of \"complexity\", \"Universal Grammar\", etc.). Furthermore, the choice and testing of creolists' complexity metrics is often circular, tendentious and empirically flawed (see Sections 5 and 6).\n\nChomsky once wrote that \"linguistic theory must be constructed with explicit and precise definitions and operational tests\" (1957: 233). In the absence of empirically- and theoretically-grounded definitions of \"creoles\", language \"youth\", \"pidgins\", \"basic [human] communication\", \"complexity\" and so on, what are we to make of the proposition that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\" because Creoles, and only Creoles, are \"born again\" languages? I take it that, in the absence of \"explicit and precise definitions and operational tests\" this most simplistic proposition can provide us with only a mismeasure of Creole languages and, indeed, a mismeasure of Creole SPEAKERS if one assumes a Cartesian (or Humboldtian) approach whereby languages are properties of minds. 11\n\nIn what follows, I will document the theoretical, empirical, and bibliographical lapses that undermine the recent (and not-so-recent) claims that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\". In particular I will review the foundational assumptions upon which traditional and recent claims about Creole complexity (or lack thereof) rest. These assumptions touch on the following questions, which I address in turn:\n\n1.\n\nHow are \"Creoles\" defined? (Section 2)\n\n2.\n\nHow does one measure the \"youth\" of languages? (Section 3)\n\n3.\n\nCan we determine the features \"necessary to basic human communication\"? What is the relationship between \"basic human communication\" and \"simplification\" in \"pidgins\"? Does Universal Grammar define \"basic communication\" requirements? (Section 4)\n\n4.\n\nWhat is the epistemological status of complexity metrics in Creole genesis scenarios? (Section 5)\n\n5.\n\nGiven all of the above, (how) can we falsify the claim that \"a subset of creole languages display less overall grammatical complexity than older languages\"? (Section 6)\n\n2. Defining \"Creole\"\n\nWhat's in a name? Long ago, Francis Bacon (1620 [1994: 64-65]) warned us that that there \"are names for things that do not exist (for just as there are things without names because they have never been seen\" and that certain \"obscure and deep seated [terminology] is derived from an incorrect and unskilled abstraction\". Furthermore, he wrote,\n\n(9)\n\n\"[W]ords are applied according to common understanding. And in consequence, wrong and inappropriate application of words obstructs the mind to a remarkable extent. [...] [W]ords plainly do violence to the understanding and throw everything into confusion, and lead man into innumerable empty controversies and fictions.\" (Bacon 1620 [1994: 55])\n\nIn 1878, the Neogrammarian manifesto also warned linguists against the \"belie[f] that they have ... fathomed the essence of [a] phenomena when they have devised a name for the thing\" (Osthoff & Brugmann 1878 [1967: 202]).\n\nWhat exactly are creolists from Saint-Quentin to McWhorter comparing when they make claims to the effect that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\"? What is the exact scientific purpose of this comparison? The postulation of some structural essence common to all \"Creole\" languages is central to the present discussion as it has been from the beginning of Creole studies. That this structural essence is the outcome of \"simplification\" is another age-old tenet in Creole studies. As Chaudenson (1994: 41) notes, \"the idea that Creole are simplified versions of their European ancestors is as old as Creole studies\".\n\nYet it has often been argued in Uniformitarian (non-dualist) fashion that \"creolization is a sociohistorical, not a structural, process\" (Mufwene 2000a). In this view, Creoles cannot be distinguished a priori from non-Creoles on strictly synchronic structural grounds. I myself have now adopted a strictly language-external definition whereby \"Creole\" is a sociohistorical attribute that connotes the results of particular types of (abrupt) language contact marked by exacerbated social distance cum power imbalance (see DeGraff 1999a,b and references therein for overviews). I also take it, as a working hypothesis within the generative framework I work in, that: 12\n\n(10)\n\n\"[C]reoles [as mental entities, i.e., I(nternal)-languages] are no more and no less than the result of extraordinary external factors coupled with ordinary internal factors [...] [Within mentalistic approaches to language creation and language change,] THE NOTION OF `CREOLIZATION' AS A UNITARY AND DISTINCT LINGUISTIC PHENOMENON EVAPORATES\" (DeGraff 1999b: 477; emphases added)\n\nThe Cartesian-Uniformitarian position in Creole studies has long been opposed by the dualist orthodoxy that assumes a strong form of `Creole exceptionalism'. Per this dualism/exceptionalism, Creole languages--thus Creole speakers--are deeply special, with genealogical and structural properties that are fundamentally distinct from their non-Creole counterparts. This is grosso modo the position of neo-Schleicherian creolists who posit both a diachronic exceptionalism (\"pidgin ancestry\" and Creole \"youth\") and a synchronic exceptionalism (a \"Creole Prototype\"). These distinctions are straightforwardly Schleicherian in the rapport they try to establish between complexity and time: \"creoles are the world's only instantiation of spoken language having been \"born again\", when speakers expanded pidgins\" (WSG: Â§2.3), and Creoles' exceptional youth (i.e., their exclusive \"pidgin ancestry\") entails that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\". As in Schleicher's evolutionist scenario, it is assumed that \"much of a grammar's complexity results from the operations of random accretion over time\" (WSG: Â§2.3). However, these genealogical and structural distinctions lack theoretical and empirical substance.\n\n2.1 Haitian Creole: An anti-prototype Prototypical Creole\n\nOn the synchronic structural front, the Creole Prototype is equated to the combination of the following traits (WSG: n1):\n\n(11)\n\na.\n\nlack of \"inflectional affixation\"\n\nb.\n\nlack of \"tone distinguishing monosyllabic lexical items or encoding morphosyntactic distinctions\"\n\nc.\n\nlack of \"opaque lexicalization of derivation-root combinations\"\n\nThe assumption is that inflection, tone and opaque derivation-root lexicalizations increase complexity. As of the lack of complexity-inducing morphological processes in the Creole Prototype, it is assumed as a consequence of the hypothetical pidgin-to-creole cycle, its concomitant morphological bottleneck and the correlates thereof vis-Ã -vis the ab ovo growth of Creole affixes (WSG: Â§5.2):\n\n(12)\n\na.\n\n\"when language \"begins anew\" amidst pidginization, the linguistic vehicle consistently lacks affixation entirely or exhibits it only minimally, with affixes developing only slowly even when the pidgin is creolized\"\n\nb.\n\n\"observed and documented processes of language change make it clear that the main source of affixes is erstwhile free morphemes\"\n\nThere is already a plethora of data and observations that, taken together, invalidate the empirical and theoretical claims in (11)-(12) about Creole morphogenesis. 13 14 Yet, in creolistics and in other human sciences, complexity rankings and genealogical scenarios are no simple matters, scientifically and sociologically (see, e.g., Gould 1996 for relevant caveats). Thus, the need to address the claims in (11)-(12) from ground-zero up, starting with the theoretically and empirically central aspects of the Creole Prototype.\n\nTo start with, let's take Haitian Creole (hereafter HC). This sociohistorically prototypical plantation Creole has been argued in DeGraff 2001b: 69-88 to manifest both \"inflectional affixation\" and \"opaque lexicalization of derivation-root combinations\", contra the predictions in (11). Moreover virtually all HC affixes are etymologically related to French affixes (i.e., virtually none of these affixes result from grammaticalization), thus shedding doubt on the claims in (12).\n\nWell-documented facts of Haiti's sociohistory and demographics teach us that HC should count as a bona fide Creole, even a \"most Creole of Creoles\", one whose historical conditions \"have been perfect for the preservation of a basilectal Creole\" (McWhorter 1998: 809, 812, 2000b: 206). But, in Creole studies, even established historical facts can be tinkered with to fit the scenario du jour: After robust HC data were advanced as counter-examples to pro-prototype claims (see DeGraff 2001b), HC's privileged status as \"basilectal Creole\" and \"most Creole of Creoles\" got revoked. HC is now taken to \"not exemplify the Creole Prototype in the purest possible form\" because of alleged \"contact over the centuries with French\" (WSG: 143).\n\nHistorically, linguistic interaction in colonial Haiti between Europeans and Africans was by far the most intense at the onset of contact, with French structures having had the most influence in the formation of (proto-)HC quite early on, in late 17th through early 18th-century. Thereafter, contact with French speakers was greatly reduced after the sugar boom in the middle of the 18th-century: the labor needs of expanding sugar plantations led to a drastic increase in the arrival rates of Africans. Before the sugar boom, the colony was still made up of mostly small homesteads--the sociÃ©tÃ© d'habitation--many of which subsequently and gradually gave way to the brutal segregation of the plantation economy--the sociÃ©tÃ© de plantation. (See Baker & Corne 1982, Chaudenson 1992, Chaudenson & Mufwene 2001 and Singler 1996 for an overview of the historical and demographic details and for pointers to the relevant literature.)\n\nAfter the independence battles of 1791-1803, the French presence was virtually eliminated. There have always been, and still exist, various degrees of contact between HC and French, specially at the higher echelons of society, with concomitant contact phenomena in both languages as naturally expected. However Haiti's history has allowed post-genesis HC to evolve in relative isolation from its socially-remote, albeit prestigious, lexifier. Haiti is the only New World plantation society that eliminated most of its \"lexifier\" population through war. From the sociÃ©tÃ© de plantation onward, French has been especially remote from (most of) the monolingual peasantry, Haiti's numerical majority. More generally, the vast majority of contemporary Haitians in Haiti are monolingual Creolophones with relatively little contact with other languages (one notable exception is the region alongside the Haitiano-Dominican border where HC speakers are regularly exposed to Spanish varieties; see DeGraff 2001b: 68 for one linguistic-structural consequence of this contact in the domain of morphology). Such a degree of linguistic isolation is quite unlike the situation in other Creole-speaking communities in the Caribbean. These well-known sociohistorical and demographic facts explain why Haiti does not offer the same sort of \"Creole continuum\" that is found in the former English colonies of the Caribbean. Unlike (say) the English-lexicon Caribbean Creoles, HC by and large (i.e., the majority of HC speakers) did not \"remain in contact with the lexifier\" (contra WSG: n17). It thus seems unlikely that the bulk of HC morphology would have been created post-genesis via late borrowings from French (e.g., after the elimination in 1803 of the majority of potential \"lenders\"). 15\n\nFurthermore there is no evidence that there ever was an earlier stage of (proto-)HC where all Creole varieties were uniformly devoid of all affixes. Such an affixless stage is even less likely considering that most of the HC lexicon is etymologically French and that HC speakers--like any other human speakers in our documentable past--are, in principle, able to extract morphological (e.g., affixal) information from stored patterns in their lexicon. In fact, whatever mental capacities would enable late-borrowing(-cum-restructuration) of French affixes in the course of HC's post-genesis diachrony would have also enabled the adoption/adaptation of similar French affixes at the earliest stages of (proto-)HC. This is specially so given the numerical preponderance of French over Africans and the lesser racial segregation at the early stages of contact. In other words, the sociolinguistic context was more learner-friendly at the onset of contact--during the sociÃ©tÃ© d'habitation--than later on--during the sociÃ©tÃ© de plantation (see note 15 ). No known (psycho- or socio-) linguistic principle could have forced all the speakers in the (early) contact situation to systematically ignore all morphological patterns in the available lexifier varieties (also see Appendix I).\n\nSimilar remarks apply to the diachrony of \"opaque lexicalizations of derivation-root combinations\" in HC--throughout I am assuming Uniformitarianism (e.g., that innate mental capacities for Language have remained uniform across the species in the past few millennia and across socioeconomic contexts; see (3)). Indeed, if HC speakers could create such morphology via \"borrowing\" through POST-genesis (reduced) contact with French speakers, then no known (psycho)linguistic constraint would prevent the creators of HC from creating this morphology at the ONSET of contact (e.g., during the sociÃ©tÃ© d'habitation, when the demographic and sociolinguistic factors were MORE favorable for the acquisition-cum-reanalysis of such forms via relatively HIGHER exposure to French speakers and, thus, more intimate familiarity with the lexifier). I must note again that, as far as we can tell, the bulk of the HC lexicon (both roots and affixes) has always been etymologically related to French (see 3.3). This means that Creole creators from the get-go massively adopted (at the very least) French lexical forms, including opaque lexicalizations.\n\nThus, we can conclude that HC--a bona fide prototypical Creole in the sociohistorical sense--with its inflectional and derivational morphology and its opaque lexicalizations represents a robust counter-example to classic neo-Schleicherian claims about Creole morphogenesis via an affixless pidgin (also see Appendix I).\n\n2.2 The Creole Prototype is an anti-Saussurean artificial language\n\nOn the theoretical front, given the very nature of the lexicon (in the Bloomfieldian sense) as the repository of Saussurean arbitrariness and given now-standard results in (psycho)linguistics, there seems to be no reason to expect \"opaque lexicalization of derivation-root combinations\" to take millennia to develop. 16 Indeed, it can be reasonably argued that \"lexicalization entails that the form is no longer generatable via metaphorical inference and now requires storage as an independent form\" (WSG: n10). In this statement, \"lexicalization\" is clearly defined, in Cartesian fashion, in terms of mental processes in the heads of individual speakers, namely \"metaphorical inference\" and lexical \"storage\". The latter is what's normally (and crucially) involved in the creation of \"opaque lexicalizations\" as Saussurean (thus, holistic) signs in the speaker's mental lexicon. To also claim that such a mental process necessarily requires \"millennia\" to unfurl (see McWhorter 1998: 792f, 798, 812, etc.) leads to a scenario in which individual speakers can live for millennia--not a likely scenario.\n\nA more realistic and theoretically-grounded alternative is to assume that opaque lexicalizations as properties of I-languages (thus, of individual minds, in concert with communal conventionalizations and cultural transmissions) do not require millennia to develop: like other Creole lexical items, opaque lexicalizations can be innovated in Creole grammars or they can be \"inherited\" from (and via exposure to speakers of) the source languages (see Fattier 1998; DeGraff 2001b: 76-82). Regarding the \"inheritance\" of opaque lexicalizations, a pro-prototype creolist could try and argue that such \"inherited\" lexicalizations should not count for testing the prediction in (11c) because they were not developed over millennia by the Creole speakers themselves. But this argument is circular since (Prototypical) Creoles are a priori defined as young languages by pro-prototype creolists. The argument is fallacious in yet another way: many bona fide opaque lexicalizations in (e.g.) contemporary English were not innovated by the current generation of English speakers--these lexicalizations were \"inherited\" by modern English speakers'. 17\n\n2.3 Empirical and methodological considerations\n\nOn the strictly-empirical front, tone, inflection and opaque lexicalizations have been documented in a variety of Creole languages; see, e.g., the observations and references in Muysken & Law 2001 and Muysken (to appear). Muysken & Law make the important observation that:\n\n(13)\n\n\"There is no doubt that in many core creoles there is very little inflectional affixation. This is also to be expected since in the second language acquisition of the European colonial languages, during the early stages of the process of creole formation, inflection is often lost. However, the contributing superstrate and substrate languages were not very rich in their inflection either, and in several cases (Berbice Dutch Creole, Papiamentu, Cape Verdean) we do get some inflection. If we take creolization in typologically very different languages ... there is simplification and regularization of inflection, but not loss of inflection. The absence of inflection is the singlemost frequently noted supposedly typological feature of creoles, and indeed may be the way many people identify a language as a Creole. However, it may be the accidental by-result, from a scholarly point of view, of the limited typological spread in the languages contributing to the proto-typical creoles.\" (Muysken & Law 2001: 49)\n\nIn a similar vein, GivÃ³n (1979, 20-21) remarks that the \"reduction of inflections\" in Caribbean Creoles is as expected given the inflectional profiles of the substratum. From this perspective, the synchronic structural criteria in (11) and the concomitant diachronic assumptions in (12) are empirically and theoretically flawed. In the following section, I address, inter alia, the assumptions in (12). These assumptions crucially enter in the theoretical basis of (neo-)Schleicherian genealogical creolistics.\n\n3. Creoles, how \"old\" are you?\n\n3.1 Creoles as \"born again\" languages?\n\nThe widespread consensus across time, across space and across theories in creolistics and beyond is that Creoles are young languages--linguistic neonates that embody an evolutionary prior stage in relation to non-Creole languages (see DeGraff 2001b for an overview). Girod-Chantrans (1785 [1980]) found HC to be \"nothing but French back in infancy\". Adam (1883: 3) reports that \"[i]n Europe, Creole speech is universally considered an infantile jargon\" (also see (2b)). Jespersen (1922: 228) wrote that Creole creators spoke \"as if their minds were as innocent of grammar as those of very small babies ... [thus, Creoles'] inevitable naÃ¯vetÃ© and ... childlike simplicity ... \". In Hall's (1962) pidgin-to-creole life cycle, Creole languages are the one exception to the principle of \"\"normal\" language [being] handed down from generation to generation\". Bickerton's Language Biogrogram Hypothesis turns Creole speakers into linguistic \"Adams and Eves\" (in Richard Price's terminology, as cited in Corcoran 2001). Seuren and Wekker (1986: 66, 68) and Seuren (1998: 292) contrast languages that are \"older or more advanced\" and \"sophisticated\" to Creoles, which are \"younger or less advanced\"--\"beginning\"--languages (see note 16 ). Thomason & Kaufman (1988: 8-12, 206, 211, etc.) consider Creoles as non-\"genetic\" (i.e., \"parentless\") languages that, unlike \"genetic\" languages like English, have evolved via some kind of \"abnormal [break in] transmission\" (see note 22 ). WSG: 131 follows suit: \"[A]ll [of the world's natural languages'] grammars ... trace back tens of millennia. ... with one exception ... : ... Creole languages have, by definition, existed only for several centuries at the most. ... The oldest known creoles today ... trace back to the late fifteenth century ...\".\n\nIn quasi-Schleicherian mode (see (1)) and against Neogrammarian warnings (see (3)), the notions \"younger\" vs. \"older\" language often form the cornerstones of dualist claims about complexity differentials between Creoles and non-Creoles (see note 17 ). For example, the proposition that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\" is argued to be \"a predictable and, in the end, rather unremarkable result of creole languages' recent origins\" (WSG: 162). More explicitly (WSG: 132):\n\n(14)\n\n\"[T]ens of millennia of drift would leave all grammars existing during that timespan equal in terms of the amount of complexity accreted beyond the bounds of the genetic specification for language. This stipulation predicts, then, that one subset of the world's natural languages, creoles, would differ from the rest of the world's natural languages in displaying less of this kind of needless complexity.\"\n\n3.2 Why/How do we \"age\" languages?\n\nThere is one fundamental question that is evaded throughout: How does one scientifically measure the \"age\" of languages for the (presumably) scientific purpose of correlating language age with language complexity?\n\nIndividual speakers (be they Creole-speaking or not) do not live through millennia. Neither do their respective \"I(nternal)-languages\" qua Cartesian mental grammars. So the statement that non-Creole languages--and only non-Creole languages--have existed for \"tens of millennia\" surely cannot refer to I-languages. Such \"tens of millennia\" estimates must apply to some extensional notion of language--perhaps some (reified succession of) socially-determined \"E(xternal)-languages\" or communal languages (see (3) and note 17 above on relevant methodological caveats, going back to the Neogrammarians).\n\nAnd still we are faced with the fundamental question: When do E-languages (or some communal/sociohistorical reification thereof) commence? Under certain definitions and for certain well-defined purposes, language age can certainly serve as a useful heuristic in various disciplines, including archeology, ethnography, anthropology, historical linguistics, etc. For example, one can say that, in a sociohistorical sense, HC is a \"young\" language as it marks the identity of a newly-created community--a community that did not exist before the 17th/18th-century (I thank Heliana Mello for an enlightening discussion of this point). In a somewhat related sense, varieties of (say) Indian English and the corresponding (speech) communities may also count as \"young\". But notice that this sort of youth is not necessarily correlated with increased structural simplicity: in some ways, \"young\" Indian English may even be more complex than the Queen's \"old\" English (consider, say, the phonology of retroflex stops in Indian English). Similar remarks could, in principle, apply to any \"old\"-\"new\" language pair, as with (e.g.) European and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nNotions such as language birth, age, and death are also assumed implicitly and a-theoretically when we use terms such as \"Proto-Indo-European\", \"Latin\", \"Old French\", \"Middle French\", \"Modern French\", etc., as classificatory devices. But, notwithstanding the popularity and sophistication of Stammbaumtheorie qua \"Tree of Language\" (cf. Darwin's Tree of Life), old vs. new linguistic species cannot be discriminated by any measure that looks like biological genetic criteria (e.g., DNA, interfertility). There is no clear notion whereby E-languages can be taken to reproduce like living organisms. Neither do we have clear linguistic-structural analogues for the DNA sequences that have now become so handy in tracing biological phylogenesis (see 1.4 above about the (im)possibility of quasi-Lamarckian linguistics). 18\n\nThere are a number of fascinating sociological factors vis-Ã -vis why, when and how certain languages start being (perceived as) \"new\" languages with birth certificates that distinguish them from their relatives. As a facile illustration, one can compare the status of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish (or Spanish, Portuguese and Italian; or Serbian and Croatian) as \"distinct\" languages vs. that of Chinese as \"one\" language. Suffice it to say that these distinctions are more relevant for issues of identity (and) politics than for strictly-linguistics (typological) matters.\n\nAnother example will drive the point home (in a metaphorical and litteral, if not statistically-representative, sense): In New York, I once saw a sign that advertised (in Haitian Creole!): Isit nou pale Franse `Here we speak French' (I have updated the sign's orthography to fit the official HC phonemic norms; see Dejean 1980). The HC-as-French sign had been proudly displayed by a Haitian employee next to a Spanish sign advertising AquÃ­ se habla EspaÃ±ol.\n\nOne may well chuckle at this story and argue that it is surely not representative of Haitians' meta-linguistic attitudes, but we still need to ask: What are the precise linguistic-structural criteria--the operational typological threshold--that would classify (e.g.) Missouri French and Cajun French as BONA FIDE varieties of French while HC is usually not so classified? Perceived notions of (non-)distinctness (in this case, between French and historically-related varieties) may be quite useful (or harmful) for creating and promoting stereotypes, political identities and community boundaries, but they seem to have little to do with linguistic typology per se. It is thus not so surprising that the perception of separateness between a Creole and its source languages is not uniform across all Creole speakers (see, Winford 1994: 45-48; MÃ¼hleisen 2000: 84-92 for recent discussions).\n\nFor typological and sociological reasons (e.g., regarding Creole-based education), I myself consider my native HC to be \"distinct\" from its Romance and Niger-Congo ancestors. For linguistic-typological reasons, one may well consider some variety of modern continental French (as spoken by Jean-Yves Pollock, say) to be distinct from its Latin and Old and Middle French ancestors as well as to its American relatives (QuÃ©bec French, Missouri French, Cajun French, etc.); and so do Modern English fall into distinct varieties that in turn are distinct from Proto-Germanic and Old and Middle English varieties. In a somewhat related vein, I can also envisage, for methodological reasons, that children's early grammars are \"distinct\" from the grammars of their models--the older peers and caretakers that provide children with Primary Linguistic Data (see, e.g., Rizzi 1999 and references therein for discussions of children's \"grammatical invention\").\n\nIf our discussion of age-related complexity differentials (and the concomitant claim about \"the world's simplest grammars\") is to advance in a scientifically viable manner, we need an independent, theoretically-grounded measure for measuring the birth and age of (new vs. old) languages in some linguistically-relevant fashion that is impervious to our (often tacit) preconceptions, otherwise creolistics may well become the world's most simplistic science. Recall Chomsky's (1957: 233) statement that \"linguistic theory must be constructed with explicit and precise definitions and operational tests\". Such explicitness and precision is even more urgent when dealing with languages that have generally been stigmatized from the very moment that they were identified and \"baptized\". 19\n\nIn the absence of such measure (and given the discussion in Section 2; see note 19 ), can we rely on our intuition to discriminate newborn from multi-millenarian languages? The question is not so simple.\n\nLet's get back to the case of Jean-Yves Pollock as a speaker of Modern French. What exactly does it mean to say that (Modern) French is an old language? Here we must be terminologically picky in order to try and make sense of this question whose presuppositions are infected with metaphors that contradict one another. Do the idiolects of Pollock and his peers underlie an E-language that has existed for tens of millennia? If so, his (E-)French would actually include, and be the continuation of, a very long ancestry, including at least Middle French, Old French, Latin, etc. and all the varieties in between. And so would Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Roumanian, etc., be continuations (i.e., Schleicherian growths) of Latin and its descendants along the Stammbaum lines that connect Latin to the corresponding Romance variety. In other words, if each Romance language qua old language has, by definition, existed for \"tens of millennia\", then Romance speakers all speak a selfsame continuation of their common ancestor (say, Latin), which, in turn, implies that all Romance languages constitute the selfsame multi-millenarian language, by transitivity. Not a satisfying result, at least not for Romance linguists who have done much work to isolate robust parametric differences within Romance.\n\n3.3 Creoles as multi-millenarian morphosyntactically-wrinkled neonates\n\nLet us ask again: Can linguistic typology help us decide whether a given language has existed for \"tens of millennia\" or is \"born again\" and \"begins anew\"? Can neo-Schleicherian (i.e., genealogical) creolistics constructively engage linguistic theory in any scientific way (e.g., in any way that resembles how evolutionary biology engage (phylo)genetic analysis)?\n\nTake morphosyntax. Can relatively well-understood typological properties (e.g., lexical semantics, derivational morphology, underlying word-order, scrambling, nominal case morphology, presence of definite articles) be used as genetic tracers for writing up the \"birth certificate\" of languages? Let's assume so (only for the sake of argument), and let's take these typological properties as the analogues of, say, DNA sequences in the dating of biological species (but see notes 18 and 20 and Appendix II). Then, along the afore-mentioned typological dimensions, HC can be argued to be more similar to Modern French than Modern French is to Old French or to Latin. Thus, on the counts of both perceived similarity (in the eyes of certain Creole speakers like that HC speaker in the Brooklyn store mentioned in 3.2) and typological closeness (along certain typological variables), HC seems no younger (or no older) than Modern French. 20\n\nWhat about morphology? It can be straightforwardly argued, as in 2.1 (also see Fattier 1998 and DeGraff 2001b, contra Lefebvre 1998), that most HC affixes historically derive from French affixes. Here the lexifier-creole similarities greatly exceed, both in cardinality and in systematicity, the sparse correspondences that have been used to argue for the \"Afrogenesis\" of French-lexicon creoles such as HC and Mauritian Creole from a single 17th-century West-African pidgin ancestor (see Appendix II). In the case of HC, the lexifier-creole morphological continuity is not at all surprising: most of the HC lexicon is etymologically related to French. In turn, the French lexicon itself is mostly derived from Latin--with French emerging through language contact as occasioned by Roman imperialist conquests (compare with Creole genesis in the context of Europe's imperialist conquests in Africa and the Americas).\n\nThus, the very morphology and history of HC (as compared to the morphology and history of, say, French) challenges the exclusive \"born again\" or \"recent origins\" status bestowed on radical Creoles as a class by neo-Schleicherian creolists. As far as I can understand neo-Schleicherian techniques for linguistic phylogenetic analysis and for identifying language birth (but see notes 18 and 20 and Appendices I and II), HC's etymological longevity and uniformity and its morphosyntactic inheritances-cum-restructurations should be the exclusive province of multi-millenarian languages. 21\n\nRecall the classic \"pidgin-to-creole life-cycle\" scenarios whereby pidginization creates a radical bottleneck for lexical and morphological development, thus forcing Creoles to emerge from affix-less ancestors (see note 6 ; also see (12) and discussion in 4.2 below). A related and more general assumption is that \"affixation ... emerges from the grammaticalization, reanalysis, or reinterpretation of material which was not originally inflectional\" (WSG: Â§5.2). Taken together, these assumptions entail that affixes in allegedly young languages such as HC must, in general, emerge via the grammaticalization of erstwhile free morphemes (see (12)). These scenarios are robustly contradicted by HC where, from genesis onward, almost all affixes have had, and still have, cognates in French affixes--which in turn often have cognates in Latin morphology. Etymologically these cognates diagnose millennia of seemingly un-broken transmission, quite an ancient pedigree for the morphology of a \"most creole of creoles\". Indeed, there is no documented stage in HC diachrony where the language was affix-less or with most affixes derived from \"erstwhile free morphemes\" or with most affixes derived from outside of French (also see Section 2 and, specially, Appendix I).\n\nIn this respect, Goodman (1964: 26-28, 122-124) gives a variety of HC examples in the nominal and verbal morphosyntactic domains that suggest that \"the initial speakers were exposed to a French which was virtually as complex inflectionally ... as is standard French\". Putting aside the fact that \"standard French\" (specially back then) was an artificially constructed language with few, if any, native speakers, Goodman's contention seems somewhat extreme, for at least two reasons: (i) most whites in colonial Haiti, and even in France, were more likely to be illiterate speakers of rural \"patois\"--Langue d'Oc, Langue d'OÃ¯l, Norman French, etc.--than fluent speakers of standard/literate French (see, e.g., Chaudenson 1995: 18; Chaudenson & Mufwene 2001: 151-153); and (ii) not all Creole creators were exposed to the same (non-native approximations of) native French varieties: right from the onset of contact, there must have existed a continuum of contact varieties, which were subsequently modulated through sociolinguistic factors into later varieties, including those known to us today (see, e.g., Alleyne 1971, Mufwene 2001; also see note 15 and Appendices I and II).\n\nNonetheless Goodman's point about HC's morphological complexity vis-Ã -vis its lexifier is valid to the extent that the available archival and comparative evidence suggests a robust degree of etymological continuity, which in turn disconfirms the radical morphological bottleneck posited by the pidgin-to-creole scenarios. Alleyne (1971: 172-174) makes a similar point, subject to similar caveats, when he gives linguistic evidence from French- and English-lexicon Creoles that their lexifiers \"in their full morphological systems where used in the contact situation\". In the same vein, Mufwene (2000b: 9) writes that \"to the extent that English pidgins and creoles, as well as indigenized Englishes, can ultimately be traced back to Old English, they all have a long history\". Thus, as Goodman, Alleyne, Mufwene and many others have argued before, there seems to be little, if any, evidence that Creole genesis must prototypically proceed via \"a radical reduction of [the] source languages into makeshift jargon\" (cf. WSG: 144).\n\nTo recapitulate: Language age has long been taken as the crucial factor that determines level of complexity--this is in keeping with Schleicher's intuition about the genealogy of morphology (see 1.2). Schleicherian linguistics takes for granted the existence of some independent, precise and operational \"language dating\" algorithm for genealogical/phylogenetic analysis. Yet the language-dating heuristics that have thus far been used to diagnose language youth (e.g., pidgin-to-creole symptoms such as development of new affixes via grammaticalization) simply fail to account for robust data in HC. The latter's morphology is incompatible with its postulated ancestry in some hypothetical affixless pidgin. HC, as a sociohistorically prototypical Creole language, manifests multi-millenarian morphological wrinkles.\n\nAt this stage, this reader is left begging what sorts of criteria are tacitly applied in creolists' genealogical heuristics. Thus far, it looks like we're dealing with either some arbitrary (perhaps sociologically motivated but unstated) presuppositions and/or some circular argument. The circularity would go something like this: Creole languages are \"new\" because they are Creole languages whereas non-Creole languages are \"old\" because they are not Creoles. 22\n\nCan creolists' theoretical elaborations on the concept \"pidgin(ization)\" and its import in the \"pidgin-to-creole life-cycle\" get us out of this conundrum?\n\n4. On \"pidgins\", \"simplification\" and \"basic communication\"\n\n4.1 Epistemological issues: Vagueness, circularity, falsifiability, etc.\n\nOne time-honored tradition in Creole studies views pidgins and the proto-creoles they gave birth to as paragons of \"basic [human] communication\" with near-zero complexity. The precursors of this view go back to (e.g.) Saint-Quentin (1872) and Schuchardt (1914); see (2a) and (19). We find similar views in 21st-century neo-Schleicherian creolistics (WSG: 126): 23\n\n(15)\n\n\"Creole creators, in creating the pidgin that later developed into a creole, strongly tended to eschew traits from their native languages which were incidental to basic communication, and that such traits were therefore absent in the natural languages that the pidgins were transformed into.\"\n\nI myself don't trust my intuitions on the elusive notion \"basic communication\", and specially not so in the teleological-functional context of (15) and its congeners in Creole genesis scenarios. Above all, I don't know what the evolutionary and structural correlates of basic communication are. Has UG specifically evolved to perfectly implement basic communication? Is UG a, or THE, perfect (post-)pidgin grammar? What are the morphosyntactic requirements of \"basic communication\"? Are syntactic categories like N(P)s, V(P)s, C(P)s, etc., \"functionally central\"? What about XP-movement and other structural transformations? Couldn't \"basic communication\" do without them on a par with (e.g.) formal languages? Ditto with respect to (abstract) Case marking and the X -vs-XP distinction. Is there a maximum number of thematic roles per verb in \"basic communication\"? What is the shape of the lexicon in \"basic communication\"? What is the minimal phonemic inventory required by \"basic communication\"? Etc., etc. (Cf. note 35 .)\n\nFrom what I gather in the UG literature (e.g., from Linguistic Inquiry articles), there isn't much there that can be straightforwardly related to \"basic communication\" needs. And it even seems that there are sociolinguists interested in language change who, like generativists, are quite skeptical about teleological functionalism. For example, Labov 1994: Ch. 19 bears the title \"The overestimation of functionalism\". In the next chapter on \"The maintenance of meaning\", Labov concludes:\n\n(16)\n\n\"A good many theories of language put forward recently would explain language structure as the result of the intentions of the speaker to communicate meaning to the listener. There is a part of language behavior that is subject to conscious control, to deliberate choice, to purposeful and reflective behavior. But as far as I can see, it is not a major part of the language faculty, and it has relatively little influence on the long-range of language structure.\" (Labov 1994: 598)\n\nGiven such widespread, plus my own, skepticism about teleological explanations for language structure, I had hoped to find a clear structural definition of \"basic communication\" in 21st-century Schleicherian writings. After all, \"basic communication\" is THE linchpin of Creole genesis scenarios based on age-complexity correlations. Yet \"basic communication\" is thus far left without any explicit and operational criteria. No independent algorithm is provided to derive the denotation of this term and its linguistic profile. This is (methodo)logically debilitating. In absence of independent criteria for \"basic communication\", Schleicherian creolists' arguments risk circularity of the following sort:\n\n(17)\n\na.\n\n\"Basic communication\" comprises whatever structural properties make up (many? most? all?) Creole languages\n\nb.\n\nConversely, out of the vast array of superficial cross-linguistic distinctions, let's (arbitrarily?) select a quite small inventory of features that happen to not exist in (many? most? all?) Creoles and let's make these features \"incidental to basic communication\". In other words, features that are absent in (many? most? all?) Creoles are not \"basic\" to communication.\n\n(18)\n\nFeatures \"incidental to basic communication\" include \"ergativity, grammaticalized evidential marking, inalienable possessive marking, switch-reference marking, inverse marking, obviative marking, `dummy' verbs, syntactic asymmetries between matrix and subordinate clauses, grammaticalized subjunctive marking, V2, clitic movement, any pragmatically neutral word order but SVO, noun class or grammatical gender marking (analytic or affixal), ... lexically contrastive or morphosyntactic tone beyond a few isolated cases\", and \"lexicalized derivation-root combinations\" (WSG: Â§6 and n20)\n\nThe reasoning in (17) is the theoretical essence of neo-Schleicherian creolistics while the list in (18) is explicitly offered as a negative litmus test for basic communication. Yet, no independent justification and theoretical argument is advanced to explain why the features in (18) are \"incidental to basic communication\". Given the vast array of superficial cross-linguistic distinctions, why the ad hoc list of 15 features in (18) and not others? For example, why should ergativity, but not accusativity, be dispensable in basic communication? Pending answers to these and other questions above, it seems to me that appealing to some arbitrary list of scattered features to derive creoles' simplicity via a \"basic communication\" pidgin that lacks such features runs immediately into theoretical trouble (e.g., circularity, theoretical vacuity and unfalsifiability).\n\n4.2 On the making of \"pidgins\"\n\nWhat are \"pidgins\" and how do they emerge? One thing that we seem to know, based on a variety of comparative evidence, is that pidgins (be they \"early\"/\"reduced\" or \"extended\"/\"expanded\") cannot be uniformly reduced to some sort of lowest-common-denominator \"basic communication\" natural language: In standard descriptions, \"early\" and \"extended\" pidgins fall at opposite ends of the structural and functional continuua.\n\nAbout \"EARLY pidgins\", one common observation is that they often emerge as reduced communication systems used in restricted and specialized contexts (e.g., for sporadic limited exchanges outside of one's speech community). The prototypical, if controversial, definition for (early) pidgins is that they arise as \"makeshift adaptations, reduced in structure and use, no one's first anguage\" (Hymes 1971: 3; also see Schuchardt 1909; Jespersen 1922: Ch. 12; Bloomfield 1933: 472-473; Hall 1962: 151-153; etc.; see references in 1.2 and note 6 ). Bickerton (1999: 49), for one, considers early pidgins to be \"reduced well below the minimum required by natural languages\". It may even be argued that early pidgins may be unlike native languages to the extent that early pidgins' (lack of) structure seems to fall outside the formal boundaries for natural languages as set by UG (see DeGraff 1996b, 1999b: 499-500 for some discussion). It seems then that the \"drastically reduced linguistic structure and lexicon\" of early pidgins with restricted functions is the result of \"the very first stage of rudimentary language learning\" (Hall 1962: 151-153). These structural and functional restrictions immediately dis-qualify early pidgins as candidates for viable full-fledged systems for human communication, IF--and this is a big \"IF\"--\"viable full-fledged ... human communication\" entails the ability to encode for transmission the expressive needs of normal human beings across a functional range of topics. Something along the lines of this assumption is adopted in WSG: Â§2.3 where it is claimed that pidgins in the pre-expansion stage are \"universally agreed to be rudimentary codes not fulfilling the needs of full language\".\n\nAs for \"EXTENDED pidgins\" (e.g., in Melanesia), they seem to function beyond and above \"basic\" communicative needs: these pidgins incorporate various structural properties that are as formal (i.e., not \"functionally central\") as that of any full-fledged natural language (see, e.g., Hall 1962: 154-155; Keesing 1998, 1991, Siegel 1999; below I illustrate non-\"basic\" features in pidgins).\n\nIt thus appears that, as in other cases of (I-)language creation by adults, the making of pidgins leads to distinct-looking results depending on contingent sociohistorical specifics. In Hymes's (1971a: 69) words, \"the characteristics found in development to, and of, a pidgin admit of degrees. ... pidgins and pidginization are instances par excellence of variable adaptation of means to an audience and situation\".\n\nCartesian-Uniformitarian methodology (see, e.g., (3)) invites us to sort out historical processes and the external entities they create (\"E-pidgins\", say--social entities) from psychological processes and their concomitant individual-level creations (\"I(nternal)-Pidgins\", say--mental entities); see Paul 1890, Andersen 1983 and Siegel 1999 for useful overviews and methodological caveats (also see note 17 ). My (null) working hypothesis is that the making of I-Pidgins (I-Pidginization, if you will) enlists cognitive processes that commonly unfurl, not just in situations of abrupt and/or limited language contact, but also in the various instances of second language acquisition in \"ordinary\" contexts of language contact.\n\nIn this Cartesian (i.e., mentalist and internal) perspective, I(NTERNAL)-pidgins are not sui-generis: they are the internal linguistic states--(transient or crystallized) interlanguages, if you will--in which adult language learners (qua second-language creators in need of a lingua franca) routinely find themselves. When viewed EXTERNALLY a stabilized (E-)pidgin, on a par with a communal (E-)language with native speakers, is a reification and conventionalization of the creations of individual speakers interacting in specific sociohistorical contexts, with their particular linguistic ecologies and their particular communicative requirements. From that perspective, the fact noted above that pidgins in distinct sociohistorical matrices may widely differ from one another (i.e., that pidginization and pidgins \"admit of degrees\", in Hymes's words) can be naturally and constructively related to, inter alia, the observed variability in the outputs of second-language acquisition (e.g., with respect to the structural profiles and functional characteristics of adult learners' interlanguages and fossilizations thereof); see DeGraff 1999b: 479-508 for one overview and some references.\n\nThis Cartesian \"I-pidgin(ization)\" working hypothesis seems heretical to the field at large (see Siegel 1999 for one recent overview of diverging perspectives). Indeed, one (now familiar) truism in creolistics is that pidginization is a sui generis process that eschews (virtually) all morphology (see Jespersen 1922; Hjelmslev 1938; Bickerton 1988; Seuren & Wekker 1986; Seuren 1998; McWhorter 1998, 2000a,b, 2001; etc.). Per this truism, pidgins are uniformly (and, for some, teleologically) designed ab ovo as simplest languages. The corollaries of this truism--the pidgin-to-creole life-cycle and its concomitant morphological bottleneck--constitute received wisdom in language-contact and historical-linguistics textbooks. By definition, the pidgin-to-creole cycle is exclusive to Creole formation and is radically different from processes underlying the diachrony of non-Creole languages. It is noteworthy that this scenario is still part of the communis opinio in Creole studies notwithstanding the fact that the \"classic\" pidgin-to-creole litmus test fails on representative Creoles, including HC (see Section 2 above; also see Alleyne 1971). At this point, a bit of critical historiography is in order, before exploring modern exponents of the pidgin-to-creole cycle.\n\nThe view that pidginization entails a morphological bottleneck--a \"stripping\" of language-particular morphology--is already found in Schuchardt's (1914) description of \"the creole before [it] become[s] the native language of the majority\":\n\n(19)\n\n\"For the master and the slave it was simply a matter of mutual comprehension. The master stripped off from the European language everything that was peculiar to it, the slave suppressed everything in it that was distinctive. They met on the middle ground.\" (Schuchardt 1914 [1980: 91])\n\nSchuchardt's hunch echoes through much of contemporary creolistics. We still find allusion to \"stripp[ing]\" as in Bickerton's (1988: 272-278) claims that \"a sharp, and in some cases quite radical, reduction in the structural properties of the original target language was an essential prerequisite for new language formation\" and that such reduction entails that, in the formation of radical Creoles, \"the target's bound morphology [is] stripped ... thoroughly\".\n\nMore recently, Schuchardt's \"simpl[e] matter of mutual comprehension\" has been linked (as in (20a)) to \"basic communication\" and its \"functionally central\" features (see, e.g., (15) and (20b)). Here, one ill-defined term--Schuchardt's \"middle ground\"--is replaced in WSG by another ill-defined term--\"basic communication\"--which, in turn, is based on some ill-defined mechanics for \"stripping away virtually all of a language's complexity (as defined in [WSG]), such that the complexity emerging in a Creole is arising essentially from ground zero\". And both the early-20th and the early-21st century scenarios involve \"deliberate design\" (somewhat reminiscent of \"naive or teleological design\" as critiqued by Labov 1994: Ch. 19-20; see (16); also see Paul 1890 [1970: xliv-xlvi]):\n\n(20)\n\na.\n\n\"[P]idgins [are] stripped of almost all features unnecessary to communication\" (WSG: Abstract)\n\nb.\n\n\"[Pidgins are] communication vehicles deliberately designed to eschew all but the functionally central\" (WSG: Â§2.3)\n\nIn (19), Schuchardt takes some intuitive impression of \"basic variety\" cum \"baby/foreigner talk\" (cf. Bloomfield 1933: 472, Ferguson 1971, 1975, 1981) to a structural extreme. He assumes that speakers in contact situations can systematically suppress structures that are \"peculiar\"/\"distinctive\" to their respective native languages in order to create an \"emergency language\" for \"mutual comprehension\". But this entails that, whenever speakers of (say) languages and need an \"emergency language\" for \"mutual communication\", speakers can correctly decide which of their native structures will \"meet with [ speakers'] total incomprehension\", and vice versa. And this would be why, in the European-African \"emergency language\", the Europeans eliminated European affixes (e.g., plural-marking suffixes such as English -s) while the Africans, in analogous fashion, suppressed the expression of African affixes (e.g., plural-marking prefix such as Duala ma-); see Schuchardt 1914 [1980: 91-92].\n\nI find Schuchardt's claims in (19) and its modern implementations (see paragraphs below) theoretically and empirically challenging, even if seemingly common-sensical. In particular, I don't understand the psycholinguistics of finding the \"middle ground\". Ferguson (1971, 1975, 1981) seems right that every native speaker can resort to some recognizable and negotiable simplified register for speaking to linguistically-handicapped foreigners. Yet, notwithstanding the broad tendencies identified by Ferguson and others toward universals of simplification (see, e.g., contributions to Clyne 1981), foreigner talk doesn't seem to constitute a cross-linguistically well-behaved \"simplest\" structural type. Ferguson himself (1971: 146, 148; 1981) shies away from positing (simplification in) \"foreigner talk\" as a general, absolute and sui generis process in pidginization. Instead, regarding simplification, Ferguson cautiously notes:\n\n(21)\n\n\"It is ... clear that relative simplicities [e.g., smaller lexicon, less morphology and allomorphy] occur under a wide variety of circumstances, such as in pidginization, normal diachronic change, language acquisition, language pathology and register variation, although the details differ from one set of circumstances to another. It is also clear that simplification is rarely if ever the exclusive diagnostic characteristic of a particular language/variety/register in comparison with another ... \"\n\nIt may well be the case that all contact situations entail simplification (however defined--e.g., as reduction in structural irregularities) to some noticeable extent. It may also be the case that simplification can happen without (large-scale) language contact (I return to this below). 24 However, speakers engaged in language contact are neither telepaths, nor (psycho)linguists, nor fluent in each other's languages. Therefore they cannot SYSTEMATICALLY decide what in their native speech should unambiguously count as \"peculiar\"/\"distinctive\" to the foreigner's ear. Furthermore, in deciding what's \"peculiar\"/\"distinctive\", the \"middle ground\" creators must, strangely enough, abstract away from phonetics--the language-particular component that is most accessible to the foreigner's ear. This is much easier said than done. For now, the (psycho-)linguistics of negotiating this \"middle ground\" strikes me as quite mysterious. One (perhaps less mysterious) alternative then is to posit that speakers of any pair of languages and know in advance what the \"middle ground\" ought to be, independently of any contrastive analysis of vs. . A cognitive pre-requisite for successfully establishing this \"middle ground\" is that speakers of and (and of all other languages) share a universal set of hardwired instructions for finding this \"middle ground\" as \"simply a matter of mutual comprehension\" (see Clyne 1981 for bibliographies on foreigner talk; also see 4.4 on simplification in pidginization).\n\nOne possible non-innatist, TELEOLOGICAL answer to the puzzle of Schuchardt's \"middle ground\" equates the latter to a pidgin qua (near-)perfect \"basic communication\" system (see (20)). This hypothetical pidgin is built almost exclusively on \"functional central\" features (i.e., it is \"stripped off of almost all features unnecessary to communication\"). However, it is still not clear how speakers (or linguists for that matter) can \"deliberately\" sort out between \"functionally central\" vs. communicatively \"unnecessary\" linguistic properties. Deciding what is \"functionally central\", and why, remains an ever-elusive task that has long frustrated expert linguists who are deliberately tackling this problem in the leisure of their research offices, thus the lively debates in functional linguistics toward the discovery of deep-seated, (i.e., non ad hoc) correlations between function and structure. (Also see Mufwene 2000a: 72-76 for socioshistorical arguments agains the teleological view of pidginization and creolization.)\n\nThere's one camp though where something like \"basic communication\"--qua universal set of INNATE instructions for finding the \"middle ground\"--has been proposed. Recently, Klein & Perdue (1997) have proposed that all second language learners go through a stable and universal \"basic variety\" (BV) stage. This BV, although not mentioned in WSG, somewhat looks like \"basic communication\" in WSG, at least in spirit: BV is a well-defined I-language, a pre-determined state of the language faculty. The BV's prototypical features are: no inflectional morphology, no grammatical morphemes, (NP )-V-NP order, tense-marking via adverbials, no movement, no complex hierarchical structure, etc. (Klein & Perdue 1997: 311-326, 332, 336) These \"organizational principles\" are genetically wired via some sort of \"core UG\", thus relatively independent of the native and target languages. Here's how K&P locates BV vis-Ã -vis UG:\n\n(22)\n\na.\n\n\"[T]he human language capacity provides us with the potential to process very complex structures but does not force us to do so. ... [BV] IS simple and still extremely functional\" (Klein & Perdue 1997: 302; compare with (20))\n\nb.\n\n\"[F]ully fledged natural languages are but elaborations of this BV. They add some specific devices, such as inflectional morphology or focus constructions; they also add some decoration, pleasant to the ear, hard to learn, but faithfully handed down from one generation to the next. But essentially, they build on the same organizational principles.\" (Klein & Perdue 1997: 304; compare with the \"contingent accumulation of \"ornamental\" elaboration that older grammars drag along with them\" in WSG: Â§2.3)\n\nc.\n\n\"[T]he BV simply and directly reflects the necesary, rather than the more accidental, properties of the human language capacity\" (Klein & Perdue 1997: 304; compare with (29))\n\nNot only is K&P's BV controversial among second-language researchers, on both empirical and theoretical grounds (see articles in Jordens 1997), but more to the point its postulated structure is quite unlike what we see across pidgins (see 4.3). That pidgins do not instantiate a uniform structural template is also recognized by Klein & Perdue 1997: 340. Furthermore K&P's \"basic variety\" is expressively handicapped and lacks some of the structural characteristics (e.g., complex hierarchical structure) associated with full-fledged languages (Klein & Purdue 1997: 302, 333). Thus BV is not a good candidate for an expressively adequate \"basic communication\" system. Plus the ban on (complex) recursion in BV does make it an un-likely candidate for a prototypical (\"simplest\") human language. In fact BV would require more, not fewer, constraints to prevent Merge from creating complex embeddings; this makes BV quite im-\"perfect\" as an I-language (pace Klein & Perdue's (1997: 337) claim that BV is a \"perfect\" I-language). If BV is as \"perfect\" as claimed by K&P, then the ban on complex embeddings in early interlanguage is not a strictly I-language phenomenon rooted in some core parameter-setting; instead such ban must be a side-effect of rather superficial online production strategies that ease the processing burden of the non-native learner at the beginning of acquisition.\n\n4.3 Are pidgins designed ab ovo from \"ground zero\" complexity?\n\nThe exclusively teleological-functional definition of pidgins--as speech that \"eschew[s] all but the functionally central\" (see (20))--is incompatible with a variety of well-documented facts from psycholinguistics and contact linguistics.\n\nOn the empirical front, alongside robust evidence for various kinds of simplification in pidginization, there are well-documented pidgin structures that are `inherited' from (some of) the source languages (see below). In other words, these structures were not \"eschewed\" from the Creole creators' native languages, whether or not these structures were \"functionally central\". The retention and reanalysis of source-language structures in pidginization (and creolization) is not surprising given what psycholinguists and sociolinguistics have taught us about language transfer in second-language acquisition (SLA) and about the dynamics of contact linguistics (see Weinreich 1953; Labov 1994, 2001; Mufwene 1990, 2000a,b 2001; and DeGraff 1996b, 1999b,d for some overview and further relevant comments). Besides, the fact that certain pidgin structures are absent in many \"old\" languages across phyla and across time suggests that not all pidgin structures are required for basic communication. This too is unsurprising. The sociolinguistic specifics of each instance of language contact are contingent on history. It is thus tautological that pidgins' source languages (and other relevant sociolinguistic factors in language contact) vary across time and space. Pidgins will thus `inherit' (and re-analyze) selected patterns from the languages in contact. Since it cannot be the case that every such \"inheritance\" exists in every (\"old\") language, these \"inheritances\" cannot all be taken as \"functionally central\" to \"basic communication\", lest many \"old\" languages are communicatively dysfunctional.\n\nCounterexamples to (20) go as far back as Schuchardt 1914, if not earlier. Schuchardt documents widespread substrate influence on the developing \"emergency language\" at all levels of structure: syntax, lexicon, lexical semantics, proverbs, etc. For Schuchardt (1914 [1980: 93]), such transfers are quite natural: 25 \"[T]he slaves spoke the creole not only with the Whites but also among themselves while their mother tongue was still in existence, the latter being moreover constantly revived to some extent by the continual immigration from Africa\".\n\nThis rudimentary sketch of the socio- and psycho-linguistics of language contact in Creole genesis has since been confirmed and refined across a wide variety of cases. It has now been painstakingly documented that pidgins are pregnant with (reanalyzed) structures from the languages originally in contact, alongside structural innovations. Such massive transfers, restructurations, innovations give rise to an array of syntactic options for any given semantic function within and across pidgins. Unsurprisingly distinct pidgins select distinct functions for morphosyntactic marking and their morphosyntactic options often enter into competition for the expression of similar functions. 26\n\nNow, one could well try and argue that whatever source-language properties survive pidginization and make it into the Creole must be \"functionally central\" properties that are \"necessary to human [basic] communication\". In other words, given evidence for admixture in Creoles (see, e.g., references in notes 26 and 31 ), if Creoles begin anew at virtually ground zero, then it must be the case that language transfers do not introduce (substantial) complexity in Creole genesis. Witness the following quote from WSG: 27\n\n(23)\n\n\"Creole languages are unique in having emerged under conditions which occasioned the especial circumstance of stripping away virtually all of a language's complexity (as defined in this paper), such that the complexity emerging in a Creole is arising essentially from ground zero, rather than alongside the results of tens of thousands of years of other accretions\" (WSG: Â§4.4).\n\nThis postulated \"stripping away\" entails that pidginization systematically filters out from the languages in contact \"the results of tens of thousands of other accretions\", allowing the retention of only features that are \"functionally central\" (cf. WSG: n11, 13). However, given the right ecology, admixtures do carry along \"incidental\" features from the languages in contact. This carry-over of source-language features is favored by (e.g.) relative homogeneity of (some of) the languages in contact, relative exposure to these source languages, the socio-psychological profiles of the speakers in contact and other sociolinguistic incidental factors (see the references in 26, specially works by Alleyne, Mufwene, Siegel, Singler, and Thomason & Kaufman). Such factors may even include the whims of \"one [pidgin] speaker\"; see Nichols's (1986: 240) speculations about the grammaticalization of evidential marking in Chinese Pidgin Russian (see (24b)). No matter how they get carried over into the emergent contact language, these admixtures cannot all be subsumed under the (still elusive) category of \"functionally central\" properties. Indeed these admixtures and concomitant restructurations-cum-innovations do not seem required by basic communication; they even include some of the \"incidental\" features in (18). To wit, the very preliminary sample in (24) (also see the discussion in 6.4).\n\n(24)\n\na.\n\nCapeverdean Creole has object clitics and inflectional number marking (Baptista 1997: 262, 2001); Baptista 2001 also documents suffixal number marking in a variety of contact languages.\n\nb.\n\nChinese Pidgin Russian has one grammaticalized evidential marking (Nichols 1986; also see (25)).\n\nc.\n\nFanagalo Pidgin has noun classifiers (Heine 1978: 223). 28\n\nd.\n\nKitÃºba exhibits a periphrastic aspectual marker preceding the verb and a bound tense marker suffixing onto the verb (Mufwene 1997: 179).\n\ne.\n\nThe Lingua Franca exhibits inflectional gender marking and agreement (Muusse & Arends 2001).\n\nf.\n\nMobilian Jargon has, inter alia, OsV word order where \"s\" denotes a pronominal subject, with \"S\" denoting a non-pronominal--full--NP subject (Drechsel 1993: 356-357, 1997: 128-135).\n\ng.\n\nNdjukÃ¡-Trio Pidgin exhibits OsV, in addition to sOV and SOV; and in wh-questions, the wh-object can occur either before or after the subject (Huttar & Velantie 1997: 105-108). 29\n\nh.\n\nNubi Arabic has lexically and morphosyntactically contrasting tone (Heine 1982: 26, 41, 42, 43, etc).\n\ni.\n\nPalenquero has object clitics (Schwegler & Green, to appear).\n\nj.\n\nPalenquero has (at least) three strategies for sentential negation: preverbal negation, discontinous double negation (with simultaneous pre- and postverbal marking) and postverbal negation (Schwegler & Green, to appear).\n\nk.\n\nPapiamentu manifests both tone and stress (Rivera-Castillo 1998).\n\nl.\n\nSolomons Pijin has a postverbal (and non-affixal) aspectual marker that exists alongside other TMA markers that are preverbal (Keesing 1991: 325-330).\n\nm.\n\nTaimyr Peninsula Russian-based Pidgin has predominating SOV order (Wurm 1996: 86-87).\n\nWhat this means from a superficial (E-language) perspective is that pidginization and creolization appear to drag, restructure and (re-)create arbitrary amounts of so called \"long-ago\"/\"baroque\"/\"random\" accretions\", thus perpetuating, and adding to, whatever complexity may have already existed in prior diachronic cycles. (Also see note 26 and see Muysken & Law's (2001: 49) caveat, cited above in (13).)\n\nIn a related vein, the sheer structural diversity of pidgins refutes the claim that pidgins are \"communication vehicles deliberately designed to eschew all but the functionally central\" (see (20)). 30 Pidgins' structural diversity includes patterns that are unfamiliar to speakers of \"old\" languages like English and French. Commenting on such diversity while sketching the `exotic' character of Chinese Pidgin Russian, Thomason & Kaufmann sum up this picture much better than I can, so I quote at length:\n\n(25)\n\n\"Like the "
