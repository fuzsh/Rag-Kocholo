Depending on the time of your arrival, you can take care of your provisioning if you haven’t already ordered it through us, or you can visit the town. Our receptionist will advise you about beaches, bars/cafes, restaurants or places of interest.\n\nYou can leave your luggage at the Sunsail reception during this time.\n\nYou will find a cyber-coffee bar and restaurant at the Marina.\n\nThe technician at the base will give you detailed technical explanations and advice about the boat. Take advantage of his presence by going over all of the boat’s equipment. Whenever possible, we ask you not to load the boat with your baggage before the inventory has been checked. It is also preferable that the boat handover instructions be done with a minimum of crew present. We ask you to check the equipment on board with the aid of an inventory list in the manual given to you with the boat’s documents. This verification will help you to memorise where everything is located. Someone from customer service will stop by to help you finish this inspection and answer any questions you may have.\n\nOut of hours\n\nThe Sunsail base staff will wait at the marina until 7:00 pm. After 7:00 pm you will find a sign on the reception door indicating your boat name and its berth. Your boat will be open and there will be a sign with your name on it. The boats equipment will be ready for the night. The base staff will be at your disposal the next day to conduct the relevant briefings.\n\nOn departure\n\nThe boat must be returned and ready for debriefing and checks at 9:00 am.\n\nIf you have booked an early morning flight on the day your charter is ending, it is preferable you return to port in the middle of the afternoon the day before to carry out these formalities.\n\nBefore disembarkation please collect a debrief form from reception.\n\nThe debrief form is to let us know if you have encountered any problems with the boat or broken anything during the trip, this enables us to rectify problems for the next charter.\n\nIn addition to filling in forms we also require you to bag dirty laundry and leave in the cockpit, empty all cupboards and fridges of food and throw away, return snorkel gear and any lifejackets borrowed from reception and ensure that the boat is handed back to Sunsail in a clean and tidy state. We reserve the right to charge for boats left less than shipshape.\n\n(back to top)\n\nSail\n\nAbout the marina\n\nMarina facilities\n\nFacilities at the base include showers and toilets (open 24hrs a day) and located near the Sunsail office.

This rating scale is designed as a guide based on the prevailing conditions during the most popular season.\n\nLevel 3 – Equates to 20 days sailing, 400 miles on an equivalent yacht or RYA Day Skipper qualification with experience to a higher level.\n\nRYA Coastal Skipper qualification\n\nICC qualification with experience to a higher level\n\nWind/Weather – 10-25 knots\n\nNavigation – Understand tidal flow, ability to navigate in open waters, cope with strong currents and be able to make a passage plan\n\nAnchor/Mooring – Primarily anchoring, some slightly more exposed anchorages with poor anchor holding ground.\n\nSeychelles port authorities have recently updated their sailing certification requirements, which require skippers to submit all the necessary qualifications as detailed no later than 7 days prior to the departure date. All qualifications must be in English or French – no other language will be accepted. If your qualification is in another language, you will need to obtain a certified translation of your qualification. Sailing requirements here.\n\nTo submit your qualifications, please email paperwork@thlmarine.com.\n\nSailing grounds\n\nSkippered charter information\n\nThe skipper’s time is booked from 12:00pm to 12:00pm in 24-hour periods. If you have reserved him for the first day of your charter and have a 6:00pm start, he will use this time to ensure he is happy with all aspects of the yacht and will be at the base to meet you upon your arrival. If you have reserved him for a later date on your charter he will start at 12:00pm on that day.\n\nThe skipper is responsible for the safety of the yacht at all times. He is not permitted to dive with you, nor leave the vessel overnight. He must conduct a safety brief with you before leaving the dock regardless of the duration of his contract with you.\n\nFor “check-out charters” (anything less than the full duration of the charter) the checkout skipper’s time is booked from 6:00pm to 6:00pm to allow for a meet and greet in the evening and go over basic systems, then a full day with you the next day. This skipper is required to give you a thorough briefing on all aspects of the yacht and dinghy, in addition to assisting you with planning an itinerary for the trip and advising you on how to contact the base, the return to base procedures, and the emergency assistance procedures. It is suggested that you attend the scheduled chart brief that will be supplemented by the skipper during his time with you on the yacht. It is also suggested that you make it clear exactly what you want to cover… anchoring, docking, etc.\n\nThe skipper will be required to give you as much information as you require concerning the yacht and its systems, sailing skills, and navigation in general.\n\nThe skipper fee does not include food or beverages for the skipper and is therefore your responsibility. It is suggested that you discuss this on the first day with the skipper and establish whether you will give the skipper cash for meals, whether you have included him in your provisioning, or whether you will accommodate him as part of the group for meals ashore.\n\nThe skipper must have his own cabin. For one-day check out skipper’s it is your responsibility to get the skipper back to the base. If you prefer not to come back to the base you must pay for his expenses (ferry, taxi, etc.) to get him back to the base.\n\nThe average tip for a skipper is 15 to 20% of the skipper’s fee. This is, of course, at your discretion.\n\nMore information on Skippered Charter Options.\n\nDownload Sunsail’s Seychelles Cruising Guide here.\n\nDeck Hand\n\nPlease note that a deck hand is a legal requirement in the Seychelles if travelling to the outer islands.\n\nLuggage + packing list\n\nWe would highly recommend packing prescription medicine and essential clothing (swimsuit, t-shirt and shorts) in your hand luggage as occasionally your luggage may arrive at the base after you do.\n\nPlease pack using soft-sided bags, as these are easier to store on your yacht.\n\nSailing area restrictions\n\nAs far south as the South of Mahe.

Floatation devices are highly recommended for children but are not a substitute for supervision.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings\n\nCheck warning flags and signage on the beach and only swim where it is permitted. Not all beaches have safety information, and you should not assume they are safe.\n\nBeware of dangerous currents, these can be extremly powerful in the Seychelles. Not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags.\n\nBeware of underwater hazards, such as reefs, rocks, sudden changes in depth and marine life.\n\nNever swim where a sign says not to e.g. in zoned areas for jet boats or jet skis.\n\nNever swim at night or after drinking alcohol.\n\nLook out for others\n\nNever swim alone, ‘buddy up’ with others in your party and use the snorkel vests provided.\n\nKnow how and where to get help. If you see someone in difficulty; raise the alarm, preferably the emergency services. Ensure you know the correct number for the country you are in.\n\nDo not overestimate your ability\n\nConsider swimming lessons before you go if you think it would be useful to learn proper swimming technique.\n\nEven if you regularly swim in a pool, remember that open water swimming can be very different.\n\nSafety\n\nAll yachts are equipped with adult life jackets, harnesses, snorkel vests & diver down flags. You can see all this equipment demonstrated in our online safety briefing, and we strongly recommend that you make use this equipment during your holiday. This safety equipment will be displayed in the saloon of your boat on boarding. If you have any questions feel free to ask our base staff during your briefing.\n\nWe have a very limited supply of children’s life jackets on base so highly recommend that if you are travelling with children, you bring their own. This ensures that children have correctly fitting jackets that are comfortable for them.\n\nChildren should not be allowed in the dinghy without a life jacket or buoyancy aid and should wear a buoyancy aid or harness while on deck.\n\nChildren under the age of 16 should not operate an outboard engine and should be supervised at all times when in the dinghy.\n\n(back to top)\n\nEat\n\nProvisioning\n\nAll provisioning orders should be placed no later than 7 days prior to the charter start date.Sunsail Provisioning offers a wide range of Food and Drinks packages to suit your party’s needs.\n\nDining\n\nRestaurants\n\nIn Victoria itself there are 4 restaurants open in the evenings, serving Creole or Chinese food with many other places to eat at Beau Vallon, a short taxi ride away.\n\nMany different bars and restaurants can be found around the islands and there are 3 casinos and a cinema on Mahé.

The average price is from 55 to 90€ per day with insurance.\n\nWalking\n\nAnse Major – 1-1.5 hrs each way. This relatively easy trail winds its way along the rocky north western coastline of Mahé, leading to the small secluded beach of Anse Major. Much of this trail lies within the boundaries of the Morne Seychellois National Park, with spectacular rock slopes (called ‘glacis’ in Seychelles) and native vegetation typical of the drier areas of Mahé.\n\nVallée de Mai – Praslin – 2-4 hrs. The legendary Vallée de Mai is one of two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Seychelles, and was once believed to be the original Garden of Eden. This hauntingly beautiful primeval forest is home to some 6,000 Coco de Mer trees. The paths allow some flexibility in that hikers can double back before completing the entire track, but to explore all the paths and really absorb the atmosphere of the Vallée de Mai, it’s best to allow 3-4 hours.\n\nWater toys + sports\n\nFishing\n\nGame fishing and bottom fishing are excellent on Bird Island! The island’s close proximity to the Seychelles Continental Shelf means that fishing starts immediately after ‘Na Zdravi’ (the boat operated by the island’s only hotel) leaves the protection of the reef. Almost all of the charter time on the boat is spent fishing … not traveling to distant fishing grounds.\n\nAddress: PO Box 1419, Victoria, Mahé\n\nTel: +248 22 49 25\n\nFax: +248 22 50 74\n\nEmail: reservations@birdislandseychelles.com\n\nWebsite: www.birdislandseychelles.com\n\nDiving\n\nScuba diving is strictly regulated in the Seychelles.
