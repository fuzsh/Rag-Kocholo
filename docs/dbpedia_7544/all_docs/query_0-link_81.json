        "text": "CURRENCY\n\nSeychellois Rupee (1 USD = 13.68 SCR – May 2019).\n\nLANGUAGE AND POPULATION\n\nSeychelles has three official languages: Seychellois Creole, English, and French. The most widely spoken is Creole, a language with French roots and influences from Africa and Asia. However, English is the official language of business and the majority of people within the tourist industry speaks English.\n\nCapital City\n\nVictoria, on Mahé Island, is the capital of Seychelles.\n\nReligion\n\nChristianity, by a long way, is the most practiced religion in Seychelles. The majority of Christians (76%) are Roman Catholics. However, as a multicultural nation, Seychelles does have followers of many other faiths including Hinduism, Islam, and the Baháí Faith.\n\nSIZE\n\nMade up of 115 islands, the landmass adds up to 459 km2 with a population of 95,843 (2017).\n\nGovernment\n\nSeychelles runs democratic elections every five years to choose their president who is both their head of state and government leader. The current president (2019), Danny Faure of the People’s Party, was sworn in during 2016 following the resignation of former president James Michel.\n\nUnique Experience\n\n• Head to Bird Island to meet Esmeralda, the largest free-roaming tortoise in the world, weighing more than 300 kg (661 lbs) and he is estimated to be around 170 years old\n\n• Go on an animal safari looking out for the rare black parrot and the Gardiner’s Seychelles frog, one of the world’s smallest frogs\n\n• Go on a day tour at Curieuse Island from Praslin Island where you can snorkel, see a giant tortoise, swim and sunbathe, and enjoy a sumptuous lunch\n\n• Try the famous Takamaka drink, best mixed with pineapple juice\n\n• Rent a car and drive along the coast on Mahe, the main island, and go all around the island. You will see local eateries, food night market (south) and lots of green nature and amazing white sand beaches\n\nPre-plan with Agencies\n\nWe recommend a DIY as it is the norm for most visitors especially because most people only stay in 1 or 2 places. You can then arrange your chosen activities and excursions via a tour operator arranged through your accommodation. You will also find independent tour providers on the streets.\n\nHotel Information\n\nIf you are hoping to save some money on your trip, it’s possible to organize it yourself. Stay in cheaper hotels, eat street food, and use public transport.\n\nTransportation\n\nIf you’re staying on the larger islands of Mahé and Praslin, it’s possible to ride the local buses. However, if you’re on a smaller island, such as La Digue, hiring a bike and cycling is more convenient.\n\nIsland Hopping\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some island hopping, you can take the inter-island ferries which also provide magnificent views. Domestic flights can take you between Mahé and Praslin, taking around 15 minutes.\n\nTime allocation 3and itinerary suggestion\n\n• If you’re taking an international flight, you will arrive on Mahé island, near the capital Victoria. Spend the next three to four days exploring the island, making sure to visit the Morne Seychellois National Park, Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market, Port Glaud Waterfall, and the Botanical Gardens.\n\n• If you have time, fit in a trip to Bird Island, which is a 30-minute flight away from Mahé. We recommend arranging a boat transfer though if that option is available to you. Better for the environment! Here you can spend a couple of days watching the local wildlife and a bit of time with Esmeralda, the tortoise.\n\n• Next, take a ferry over to Praslin. Here, you should visit the Vallee de Mai Nature Reserve, relax on the beautiful Anse Lazio Beach, and visit the Giant Tortoise Farm in Curieuse Island.\n\n• After, head to La Digue for another three days. Here, you’ll be able to visit Anse Marron (“perhaps the most stunning natural pool and beach combo on the planet,” according to Lonely Planet). You could also visit the Notre Dame de L’Assomption, a yellow Catholic church, and finally relax on the Anse Source d’Argent Beach.\n\n• Finally, spend your last day or two on the beaches of Mahé, such as Anse Takamaka, relaxing before your flight home.\n\nBudget\n\nSeychelles is not a budget destination, although it’s possible to save money along the way. Street food is a cheaper alternative to pricier restaurants while hiring a bike or riding the local bus is relatively cost-effective. You should budget for at least $160 per day for your trip, which includes accommodation.\n\nAn excellent meal in one of Seychelles’ best restaurants can cost upwards of $50 per person. Street food is significantly cheaper at just $3 to $5. Expect to pay around $1.30 for a 1.5-liter bottle of water and around $1.60 for a half-liter of domestic beer.\n\nA stay in a guesthouse costs anywhere from $60 to $90 while a luxury hotel room can go from $350 upwards. There are also some AirBnB places available even though it is actually not allowed to rent out via AirBnB locally. So if you go with this option, make sure to coordinate properly with your host first, especially what address to put at the immigration when you arrive in Seychelles."
