        "text": "Dialects of a language are typically defined as mutually intelligible, which allows speakers of different dialects to communicate (Gooskens et al., Reference Gooskens, van Heuven, Golubović, Schüppert, Swarte and Voigt2018; Trudgill & Chambers, Reference Trudgill and Chambers2017). However, a small body of research suggests that both adults and children may have difficulty using dialect features that are present in one dialect but not the other as cues in spoken language comprehension (Bühler, Reference Bühler2017; Beyer et al., Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015; De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Edwards et al., Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014; Jones et al., Reference Jones, Kalbfeld, Hancock and Clark2019). For instance, Bühler (Reference Bühler2017) found that adult Swiss German speakers show processing differences (as measured by ERPs) in a word comprehension task with words that have dialect-specific pronunciations that result in different pronunciations in Swiss German and High German.\n\nDifficulty using dialect-specific features as cues for spoken language comprehension has also been observed in dialects of American English with speakers of African American English (AAE), a non-mainstream dialect, and Mainstream American English (MAE), a dialect that is considered to be “standard.” Research has shown that both AAE and MAE speakers can have difficulty using phonological and morphological features that are not within the respective dialects as spoken language comprehension cues (Beyer et al., Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015; De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Edwards et al., Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014; Jones et al., Reference Jones, Kalbfeld, Hancock and Clark2019). The differences in how AAE and MAE speakers use features present in one dialect but not the other are of interest, particularly for AAE-speaking children. This is because the primary medium of instruction within the classroom is spoken language and the dialect of instruction is almost always MAE (Brown et al., Reference Brown, Sibley, Washington, Rogers, Edwards, MacDonald and Seidenberg2015; Byrd & Brown, Reference Byrd and Brown2021; Connor & Craig, Reference Connor and Craig2006; Edwards et al., Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014; Gatlin & Wanzek, Reference Gatlin and Wanzek2015; Labov & Baker, Reference Labov and Baker2015). Since MAE is the predominant dialect used within the classroom for instruction, academic success depends in part on the accurate and efficient comprehension of MAE to understand new concepts. Therefore, if AAE-speaking children have difficulty understanding their MAE-speaking teachers, this could lead to academic consequences based on how students use MAE features as comprehension cues and not their academic abilities. While there have been efforts to move away from MAE as the “standard” dialect for academic instruction and performance, they have been slowed by political and societal barriers (Barton & Coley, Reference Barton and Coley2010; Paris, Reference Paris2012; Sleeter, Reference Sleeter2012; Young, Reference Young2010; Young et al., Reference Young, Barrett and Lovejoy2014). As advocacy continues to promote linguistic diversity within the classroom, there remains a need to understand how dialect differences impact the academic experiences of AAE-speaking children, specifically in spoken language comprehension.\n\nThere has been limited research examining how listening to a contrastive feature, which is a feature present in one dialect but not the other, impacts spoken language comprehension. The existing evidence suggests that both adult MAE speakers and child AAE speakers have difficulty using contrastive features as comprehension cues. This type of linguistic mismatch can occur when speakers of one dialect hear a different dialect that contains contrastive features. For instance, MAE-speaking courtroom stenographers, who are trained to be 95% to 98% accurate in transcribing a verbatim record of proceedings, on average transcribed only 60 % of AAE speakers’ sentences accurately (Jones et al., Reference Jones, Kalbfeld, Hancock and Clark2019). MAE-speaking stenographers were particularly inaccurate in transcribing the speech of AAE speakers when it included common and frequently used AAE features. These findings are further supported by work that has examined how adult MAE speakers used stressed /bɪˈn/ (hereafter ‘stressed BIN’), a feature of AAE, to comprehend AAE sentences in a spoken language comprehension task (Beyer et al., Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015). Stressed BIN refers to an event in the remote past or an event that has occurred for a long undisclosed period of time (Beyer et al., Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015; Green, Reference Green1998; Labov, Reference Labov1972, Rickford, Reference Rickford1975). Beyer et al. (Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015) presented adult AAE and MAE speakers with prerecorded sentences that included both stressed BIN (e.g., She been on the phone), regular been (e.g., She has been on the phone for a long time), and fillers. They found that while AAE speakers accurately used stressed BIN to infer an event that occurred a long time ago, MAE speakers incorrectly assumed that it referred to an event that occurred in the recent past. Beyer et al. (Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015) described the MAE speakers’ interpretations of stressed BIN as pseudo-comprehensions, where the listener felt confident in their understanding of what they heard but ultimately failed to use the cue appropriately.\n\nThe small number of studies that evaluate how linguistic mismatch impacts children’s listening comprehension has focused on how AAE-speaking children use contrastive features that are present in MAE but not AAE to comprehend MAE words or sentences they hear. Edwards et al. (Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014) investigated how 4- to 8-year-old children who spoke AAE interpreted MAE words that are ambiguous in AAE but not MAE because of phonological and morphological differences between the dialects. For example, consonant clusters can be optionally produced in AAE (e.g., gold can be produced as /ɡoʊld/ or /ɡoʊl/) but only as /ɡoʊld/ in MAE (Green, Reference Green2002). Edwards and colleagues found that AAE-speaking children were less accurate at comprehending words that were ambiguous in AAE due to phonological and morphological differences between the dialects (e.g., plural marker –s and final consonant clusters) in comparison to words that did not have dialect-sensitive features. Furthermore, dialect density (quantified as the number of features of AAE that children used in a language sample relative to the total number of sentences in the language sample) predicted performance independently of language experience (quantified as vocabulary size).\n\nOther studies have examined the impact of linguistic mismatch on children’s comprehension of verbal morphology in sentences. De Villiers and Johnson (Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007) examined how AAE- and MAE-speaking children, aged 4–7 years, used third-person singular -s in spoken language comprehension tasks. Overt third-person singular marking is obligatory in MAE, while zero marking is obligatory in AAE (e.g., The cat eats the mouse in MAE vs. The cat eat_ the mouse in AAE; Green, Reference Green2002, Reference Green2010; Newkirk-Turner & Green, Reference Newkirk-Turner and Green2016, Reference Newkirk-Turner and Green2021). De Villiers and Johnson found that MAE-speaking children produced third-person singular -s by the age of 4 years but did not reliably use it as a comprehension cue in sentences where the plural morpheme on the noun is coarticulated with the beginning of the verb (e.g., The cat sleeps on the bed) until the age of 6 to 7 years. By contrast, AAE-speaking children did not reliably produce third-person singular -s in production or use it as a comprehension cue at the age of 6 or 7 years (De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Newkirk-Turner & Green, Reference Newkirk-Turner and Green2016, Reference Newkirk-Turner and Green2021). Beyer and Hudson Kam (Reference Beyer and Hudson Kam2012) used a picture-choice task to examine how AAE- and MAE-speaking children in 1st and 2nd grade used a wider variety of morphological forms that are contrastive between AAE and MAE (e.g., past tense -ed, third-person singular -s, future contracted -ll; she’ll or he’ll). In the task, participants listened to sentences that were produced in MAE and were instructed to select the picture that best matched what they heard. In the test sentences, participants had to rely on the verb morphology as cues to comprehend the tense of the sentence (e.g., “She walk ed from the library”). Beyer and colleagues found that both AAE- and MAE-speaking children correctly comprehended sentences with shared morphological forms (e.g., plural -s); however, only the MAE-speaking children successfully used contrastive features that are produced in MAE to comprehend tense in MAE sentences. There was no age- or grade-related change in how contrastive dialect features were used as comprehension cues to understand MAE sentences. These results suggest that although AAE-speaking children are consistently exposed to MAE in the classroom, they are more likely to use their grammatical knowledge of AAE when comprehending MAE sentences they hear.\n\nHowever, the studies that have evaluated how AAE-speaking children use contrastive dialect features to comprehend MAE sentences have focused on features that typically have lower phonetic saliency (e.g., past tense -ed, verbal -s). The term “phonetic saliency” was brought into the acquisition literature by Leonard et al. (Reference Leonard, Eyer, Bedore and Grela1997) and Leonard (Reference Leonard2014) and has been used to refer to morphological features that are usually realized as final consonant clusters that are coarticulated with the following word in spontaneous speech, and whose duration is influenced by the position of the morpheme within the sentence. Inflectional morphemes with low phonetic saliency are generally produced later with full-syllable morphemes that have greater phonetic saliency (e.g., contractible copula and auxiliary vs. uncontactable copula and auxiliary) (Bortolini et al., Reference Bortolini, Arfé, Caselli, Degasperi, Deevy and Leonard2006; Leonard et al., Reference Leonard, Eyer, Bedore and Grela1997; Leonard, Reference Leonard2014). While the comprehension of low-phonetic-saliency morphemes has been less well studied, as compared to production, there is some evidence that phonetic saliency also affects comprehension. For example, 5-year-old MAE-speaking children are not reliable at using verbal -s as a comprehension cue, although they consistently use it in production at earlier ages (De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Kouider et al., Reference Kouider, Halberda, Wood and Carey2006; Lukyanenko & Fisher, Reference Lukyanenko and Fisher2016; Wood et al., Reference Wood, Kouider and Carey2009). This raises the possibility that prior findings with AAE-speaking children confounded linguistic mismatch and the phonetic saliency of the features used for testing. To address this limitation, the current study examines a feature that is produced as a whole syllable which has increased phonetic saliency. This allowed us to determine the extent to which linguistic mismatch impacts how AAE-speaking children broadly use MAE morphology for sentence comprehension.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine if a contrastive morphological feature with greater phonetic saliency (a whole syllable), was vs. were, also leads to differences between AAE- and MAE-speaking children’s performance in spoken language comprehension tasks. In AAE, the same verb form (was) is used for both plural and singular subjects, while MAE differentiates between single and plural verb forms (She was walking/They was walking in AAE and She was walking/They were walking in MAE; Green, Reference Green2002; Green & Sistrunk, Reference Green and Sistrunk2015; Newkirk-Turner, Oetting, & Stockman, Reference Newkirk-Turner, Oetting and Stockman2014). Footnote 1 The use of was with both singular and plural subjects is a highly consistent feature of AAE and shows a minimal decrease in use with age in elementary school (Craig & Washington, Reference Craig and Washington2004; Washington & Craig, Reference Washington and Craig2002). In addition, both was and were are produced as whole non-contracted syllables in both AAE and MAE, and thus they have more phonetic saliency than previously tested features (e.g., past tense and third-person singular -s), which can have shorter duration times and become less distinct when coarticulated. Furthermore, the use of auxiliaries such as was and were are used consistently as comprehension cues in young MAE-speaking children (Kouider et al., Reference Kouider, Halberda, Wood and Carey2006; Lukyanenko & Fisher, Reference Lukyanenko and Fisher2016; Wood et al., Reference Wood, Kouider and Carey2009).\n\nThis study will also examine if a participant’s dialect density is predictive of how was and were are used as a comprehension cue. There is conflicting evidence on how dialect density, a measure of dialect use in production, predicts how MAE features are used in spoken language comprehension. Edwards et al. (Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014) found that dialect density was predictive of how AAE speakers comprehended words and phrases that contained contrastive dialect features. Other studies (De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Beyer & Hudson Kam, Reference Beyer and Hudson Kam2012) did not directly examine the relationship between dialect density and comprehension; however, they did not observe age- or grade-related changes in comprehension of MAE. Since, previous research has shown that as age and grade increase, AAE-speaking students’ dialect density decreases (Brown, et al., Reference Brown, Sibley, Washington, Rogers, Edwards, MacDonald and Seidenberg2015; Gatlin & Wanzek, Reference Gatlin and Wanzek2015), this suggests that a decrease in the production of AAE features may not equate to increased use of MAE verb morphology as a comprehension cue. This study will evaluate if dialect density is predictive of how AAE-speaking participants perform in a spoken language comprehension task with a more phonetically salient cue, was and were.\n\nThis study addresses two questions: (1) are there differences in how AAE- and MAE-speaking children use was and were to comprehend spoken language? and (2) does dialect density predict how was and were are used to comprehend spoken language for AAE speakers? One possibility is that children who speak AAE will perform similarly to their peers who speak MAE because of the greater phonetic saliency of was and were, relative to the previously tested features (i.e., -ll, -ed, and verbal -s). This would suggest that previous results are due to the lower phonetic saliency of the features, and children who speak AAE use information about MAE grammar to interpret MAE sentences if the feature is phonetically salient. Alternatively, it is also possible that children who speak AAE will have difficulty using was and were to differentiate between singular and plural subject despite their increased phonetic saliency because the differences between how inflectional verb morphology is used in AAE and MAE will influence how AAE-speaking children attend to the feature as a comprehension cue. The latter result would support the claim presented in the previous studies that children who speak AAE, and potentially other non-mainstream dialects, use the morphological rules of their predominant dialect to interpret sentences spoken in another dialect such as MAE. Lastly, it is possible that changes in dialect density will be predictive of how participants use was and were as comprehension cues and that as dialect density, or the number of AAE features produced, increases participants will be less sensitive to the auxiliary verb as a cue. Alternatively, it is possible that changes in dialect density will not be predictive of how participants use was and were, which would mean that familiarity or production of an MAE feature may be unrelated to how an MAE feature is used as a comprehension cue by a child who speaks a non-mainstream dialect. The results from this study will broaden our theoretical understanding of how children who speak different varieties of American English attend to contrastive features to process sentences in dialects that differ from their own.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate if there were differences in how AAE- and MAE-speaking children used a more phonetically salient contrastive feature to comprehend MAE sentences. The results revealed that even when the contrastive feature had greater phonetic saliency relative to morphological cues used in past studies, AAE speakers did not use it as a comprehension cue to differentiate between singular and plural nouns. This supports previous inferences that AAE-speaking children are not reliably sensitive to MAE morphology that are zero or optionally marked within their dialect (Beyer et al., Reference Beyer, Edwards and Fuller2015; De Villiers & Johnson, Reference De Villiers and Johnson2007; Edwards et al., Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014) and suggest that the linguistic mismatch between features of MAE and AAE may impact spoken language comprehension, regardless of the phonetic saliency of the feature.\n\nIn AAE, subject–verb agreement is variably produced and was is used with both plural and singular subjects. Thus, plurality must be derived from the subject, not the verb which explains why Black AAE speakers may be less sensitive to the auxiliary verb in the ambiguous sentences (Green, Reference Green2002; Newkirk-Turner et al., Reference Newkirk-Turner, Oetting and Stockman2014). The results from this study suggest that children who use AAE features in production, which is how participants were classified as MAE or AAE speakers, are also likely to also use these same dialect features in comprehension (e.g., optionally marked subject–verb agreement). On average, AAE speakers chose the 2-person image about 75% of the time for the verb was and about 95% of the time for the verb were in the ambiguous sentences. These results suggest that AAE speakers were not sensitive to verb number as a cue and instead relied on a general preference to interpret Carolyn May as a conjoined noun phrase in the ambiguous sentence. The pattern of selecting a 2-person image regardless of the verb aligns with how was is used in production for AAE speakers.\n\nMoreover, differences in dialect density did predict how Black participants used the auxiliary verb to determine subject number. The results from the current study are in line with the results from Edwards et al. (Reference Edwards, Gross, Chen, MacDonald, Kaplan, Brown and Seidenberg2014), which found that dialect density predicted how AAE-speaking children used contrastive features as comprehension cues to interpret MAE words and phrases beyond vocabulary size (language experience). Despite there being a general decline in the production of AAE features as AAE-speaking children progress through school, it appears that how a contrastive feature is used for comprehension is influenced by the predominant dialect the speaker produces. Black participants who had a higher dialect density (i.e., AAE speakers) consistently used AAE in their productions on the DELV-ST and used their grammatical knowledge of AAE to interpret the MAE sentences. By contrast, the Black participants who had a lower dialect density (i.e., MAE speakers) primarily used MAE in their productions on the DELV-ST and used their grammatical knowledge of MAE to interpret the MAE sentences. Overall, changes in dialect density suggests that participants’ linguistic experiences, as measured by the dialect features they produce, may shape what cues are used for comprehension.\n\nThis study suggests that even with increased phonetic saliency, there are difference in how AAE- and MAE-speaking children use the auxiliary verb to comprehend MAE sentences and that dialect density is predictive of sensitivity to the auxiliary verb. Furthermore, this study suggests that participants’ linguistic experiences are influential in how children comprehend dialects that differ from the dialect they predominantly speak or are exposed to at home, which was demonstrated with the AAE speakers. These results suggest that researchers should take into consideration how children’s linguistic experiences influence how they process sentences in MAE (Childs & Mallinson Reference Childs and Mallinson2004; Cukor-Avila, Reference Cukor-Avila2001; Grieser, Reference Grieser2015; Major et al., Reference Major, Fitzmaurice, Bunta and Balasubramanian2005; Mallinson & Childs, Reference Mallinson and Childs2004; Rickford et al., Reference Rickford, Duncan, Gennetian, Gou, Greene, Katz and Sciandra2015; Wolfram & Beckett, Reference Wolfram and Beckett2000; Wolfram & Kohn, Reference Wolfram and Kohn2015). Furthermore, these findings raise additional questions as to how observed differences between AAE- and MAE-speaking children’s performance in spoken language comprehension tasks may impact academic performance. It is possible that linguistic mismatch in spoken language (1) is resolved in naturalistic contexts where there are additional prosodic, visual, and repetition cues that improve comprehension (DeDe, Reference DeDe2010; Spivey et al., Reference Spivey, Tanenhaus, Eberhard and Sedivy2002) or (2) adversely affects AAE speakers by causing perceptual processing costs that impact other cognitive processes such as working memory (Mainela‐Arnold et al., Reference Mainela‐Arnold, Misra, Miller, Poll and Park2012; Montgomery, Reference Montgomery2000; Terry et al., Reference Terry, Connor, Thomas-Tate and Love2010, Reference Terry, Thomas, Jackson and Hirotani2022). However, additional work is needed to examine if these observed differences lead to fine-grained differences in how students parse MAE sentences and how that connects to academic performance.\n\nLimitations and suggestions\n\nThere were several limitations to this study. One limitation was the virtual recruitment and administration of the study. Although the virtual administration of this study allowed for a diverse sample, it limited the experimenter’s ability to evenly match the number of AAE and MAE speakers because linguistic variation was established after participants consented to participate in the study. Likewise, the virtual administration allowed for more accessibility for participants to complete the study but limited the experimenters control over the testing environment. Although participants were encouraged to find a quiet room and use headphones during the study, distractions (e.g., noise, internet connections, etc.) could not be controlled. In addition, despite stimuli norming, there was a 2-person bias for the ambiguous name Carolyn May, even for the MAE speakers in the was condition in ambiguous sentences (though not in unambiguous sentences).\n\nConclusions\n\nTo date, there has been limited research on how AAE-speaking children use features that are marked in MAE but not in AAE to understand MAE sentences. This study added to this body of work by demonstrating that regardless of phonetic saliency, AAE-speaking children are less sensitive to MAE morphological features that are zero or optionally marked within their dialect. This work improves our knowledge about how linguistic variation can influence what cues children find relevant and reliable to comprehend sentences within another dialect. Furthermore, the results from this study demonstrate that linguistic mismatch, which has been primarily studied in reading and writing, also impacts what auxiliary verbs AAE-speaking children are sensitive to during spoken language comprehension. These findings help us better understand how linguistic mismatch may shape listening comprehension experiences, which will allow for the development of strategies to mitigate these effects as advocacy continues for linguistic inclusivity within the classroom."
