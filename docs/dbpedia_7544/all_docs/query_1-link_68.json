        "text": "The Influence of English on the Seychellois Creole\n\nStudying the Seselwa Creole and the influence that English has had on it can help provide insights into the way that the languages interact with one another. The Seychellois Creole developed though the need for communication between African slaves and the French colonizers that brought them to the island. The creole contains aspects of French along with many African language borrowings. Much of the creole's structure is rooted in French including the use of articles such as 'le, la, les, and du', and the presence of tense, aspect, and mood markers. Although Hapselmath (2009) states, \"dialectal and colonial French varieties of the 17th and 18th centuries spoken by the French settlers constitutes the bulk of the Seychelles Creoles lexicon\" (p. 218), Seselwa is still used widely throughout the country and has expanded over time to include borrowings of other languages, including English.\n\nLinguistic Features of Seychellois English\n\nSeychelles English Speakers:\n\nThe voiceless interdental fricative [θ] is often pronounced as the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] - Example: three→free\n\nThe final alveolar and velar stops, [k], [d], and [t] are often dropped - Example: cake→cay climbed→climb height→high\n\nThe words kit and bit do not rhyme, kit remains [kɪt] but bit becomes [bət]\n\nThe vowel sound[ɪ]occurs next to velars in words like kiss, gift, and sing\n\nSubstitution of long [e] for short [ɪ], no morphological distinction between words like seat/sit, sheep/ship\n\n[ʊ] is pronounced as [u] - Example: words like foot and book are pronounced as [fut] and [buk]\n\nSubstitution of [o] for [a] - Example: stop, block, rock are pronounced as [stap], [blak], and [rak]\n\nLinguistic Features of Surrounding Areas\n\nIn Madagascar, French and Malagasy are the official languages but much like in Seychelles, English is gaining ground in the sectors of tourism and global politics. The English spoken in both countries is influenced by both French and the local language used there. Below is a description of the linguistic similarities and differences between the two varieties of English spoken in Seychelles and Madagascar."
