        "text": "Historically, the islands have attracted a broad diversity of peoples from the four corners of the earth that has included freed slaves, European settlers, political exiles, adventurers, traders of Arab and Persian origin, as well as Chinese and Indians.\n\nPractically every nation on earth has been represented in this melting pot of cultures, each one contributing its special influence to todayâ€™s vibrant yet tranquil society. Seychellois Creole, also known as kreol, is the French-based creole language of the Seychelles. It shares official language status with English and French (in contrast to Mauritian and Reunion Creole, which lack official status in Mauritius and La Reunion).\n\nSince its independence in 1976, the government of the Seychelles has sought to develop the language, with its own orthography and codified grammar, establishing Lenstiti Kreol (the Creole Institute) for this purpose."
