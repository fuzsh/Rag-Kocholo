        "text": "Interviews\n\nReading and analyzing scholarly articles are excellent ways to gather information on the research completed in regards to a specific country, but an interview can provide an authentic and first hand view that is invaluable to a project such as this. There is information concerning Seychelles and the use of English within the country that simply cannot be found within the pages of even the most insightful peer reviewed work. The interviews below provide a unique understanding of the status and use of the English language within different spheres of the country of Seychelles. (Interviews edited for the sake of clarity.)\n\nJoelle Perreau\n\nDean of the Arts and Social Development Department at the University of Seychelles\n\nSpecializes in linguistics, didactics, and communication\n\nHave you noticed any recent increases in the use of English in Seychelles and if so, what do you believe has caused this increase?\n\nYes, our school system is mainly in English and we listen to tv, music, films etc in English.\n\nDo you believe that English is regarded as a privileged language compared to French and the Seychellois Creole?\n\nNo. I believe Seychellois feel more at ease speaking English. French is too close to creole so they hesitate more.\n\nLinguistically, how does the variety of English spoken in Seychelles differ from that of the variety that is considered to be the \"standard\"?\n\nPhonetically and phonologically (the pronunciation.)\n\nHow does the government in Seychelles view the English language and do you think that the policy they create supports its use?\n\nWell it is our main official language. So they do ask questions in it because everybody mostly is still comfortable with English being our administrative language.\n\nIn your work at the University of Seychelles, how often do you use and hear English compared to other languages?\n\nDaily I hear English. But also creole and French. But it would be English and creole as often as each other, French less.\n\nReflection\n\nSpeaking with Ms. Perreau provided insights into the academic use and value of the English language in Seychelles. Her knowledge of linguistics and position at the University of Seychelles mean that she has an extensive knowledge of language and how it is utilized in education. Her response to my first question frames English as the lingua franca of the Seychelles Education system since it is used primarily in the university classroom. It is also of note that cultural media in Seychelles is listened to primarily in English. Ms. Perreau also explained that English is often preferred to French and Creole because people feel more comfortable using it. That means English must be widely practiced and accessible to many. When asked about the linguistic difference between Seychellois and standard English varieties, Professor Perreau stated that the main differences can be found within the pronunciation. This means that the speech sounds differ between the dialects, most likely as a result of the mixing of phonology between the creole spoken in Seychelles and English. When asked about the government's role in the implementation and policy of English, Perreau explained that it is the main official language and it is considered to be the administrative language. If the government uses English primarily to communicate with the public, it is very likely that it is held in high esteem and the language policy would reflect that. This claim is supported by Professor Perreau's final answer stating that at the university, she hears English being spoken very often. It was interesting to learn that English and the Seychellois Creole are spoken about the same amount in the college setting. This suggests that they both have prestige through out the country and that many students in Seychelles are bilingual or even multilingual.\n\nMalan Horak\n\nSeychelles deep sea fisherman\n\nWhere in Seychelles do you live and how long have you been in the country?\n\nI have been living here on Eden Island for the last year and a half.\n\nHow often do you speak English and how often of you hear it being spoken around you?\n\nEnglish is literally all around you everyday, you constantly speak or get spoken to in English.\n\nIs American culture (music, tv, media) popular in Seychelles?\n\nYeah I'd say the American culture is actually quite big over here, with so many people from different countries here, it's like a thing everybody has in common.\n\nIn what settings (work, speaking with friends, at the market) do you use English?\n\nWe use English the whole day. I fish here in Seychelles and all 5 crew on our boat are different nationalities so English is our middle ground.\n\nHow is the English language treated in Seychelles? Is it a good thing to know how to speak it?\n\nYeah its a good thing, you won't survive here without it.\n\nReflection"
