        "text": "Seychelles Creole is a creole language spoken in the Seychelles by about 70,000 people. It is one of the official languages of the Seychelles, along with French and English. It is a French-based Creole and has much in common with Mauritian Creole. Other names include Seselwa Creole French, Seselwa and Seselwa Kreol.\n\nSince the Seychelles became independent in 1976 the Seychelles government has sought to develop the the Creole as a language. They set up the Lenstiti Kreol (Creole Institute / l'Institut créole) to standardise the spelling and grammar. Today Seychelles Creole is used in everyday conversation, in schools and in shops, and is the mother tongue of the majority of Seychellois.\n\nsource\n\nwikipedia.org, omniglot.com & ethnologue.com"
