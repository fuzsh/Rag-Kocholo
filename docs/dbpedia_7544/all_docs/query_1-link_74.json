        "text": "When you visit countries in which French is an official language, of which there are many, you’ll be amazed at its variations. It truly is diverse.\n\nThe many French flavors alone are enough to make you want to master the French language and a great way to practice is to visit countries in which French is spoken.\n\nIf this is your aim, you’ll need to know which countries French is the official language.\n\nTake a look at the list below.\n\nHow many French speakers are there in the world?\n\nAcross the globe, there are approximately 267 million French speakers.\n\nThe language is the seventh most spoken language after English, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali.\n\nWhat should you know about the French language?\n\nHere are five facts that you should know about the French language.\n\nThe largest number of French speakers are located in France. In France, there are approximately 60 million native French speakers. In the European Union, French is the second most spoken language.\n\nThe French language is called a Romance language because its roots go as far back as Latin, which is the language spoken by the Romans. The language grew over time and, in 1539, it became the official language of France due to the proclamation of François I.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that there are at least 28 dialects across the many French regions. In addition to the Normand, Paris and Marseille dialects, there are many other dialects such as that spoken in Burgundy, Gascony, and Lorrain.\n\nThere are regional accents to be aware of in France too. Compare the pronunciation of the French word for tomorrow demain and how it is pronounced in the south of France demaing. It’s quite a difference!\n\nYou’ll hear French spoken in many countries that were former colonies of France. You’ll notice, for instance, that there are many French speakers in African countries and that French is an official language in these countries as well.\n\nCountries where the official language is French\n\nWith these French facts and statistics covered, let’s now look at countries where the official language is French.\n\nBelgium\n\nNative French speakers: 8.7 million people\n\nBelgium’s official languages include German, Dutch and French. Roughly 40% of the Belgian population speaks French, and 60% of the Belgian population speak Dutch.\n\nThere are also a few other languages spoken in Belgium. The Romance language Walloon is one example, which also has a few distinct dialects such as Picard.\n\nBenin\n\nNative French speakers: 3.8 million people\n\nIn Benin, several languages are spoken. There are a few indigenous languages such as Dendi, Bariba and Yoruba. French is the official language in Benin.\n\nBenin has also adopted a few customs of French culture, one of which is French cabaret, and the biggest religious group is Roman Catholicism due to the European influences of the colonial period.\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nNative French speakers: 4.75 million people\n\nThe West African country, Burkina Faso, is multilingual. French is its official language, brought to the country during colonial times. The French language is used for administrative purposes, in addition to public services.\n\nOver 60 languages that are spoken in Burkina Faso are indigenous languages, which include Mossi and several Gurunsi languages.\n\nSome of the cultural influences of the colonial period, such as Western-style theatre, have remained in Burkina Faso.\n\nBurundi\n\nNative French speakers: 939,657 people\n\nThere are three official languages in Burundi: English, Kirundi and French.
