Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war and once again following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. Other issues facing the government are the curbing of the budget deficit, including the containment of social welfare costs, and further privatization of public enterprises. Growth slowed in 1998-2001, due to sluggish tourist and tuna sectors. Also, tight controls on exchange rates and the scarcity of foreign exchange have impaired short-term economic prospects. The black market value of the Seychelles rupee is half the official exchange rate; without a devaluation of the currency the tourist sector should remain sluggish as vacationers seek cheaper destinations such as Comoros, Mauritius, and Madagascar.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $605 million (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 1.5% (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $7,600 (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture : 3.1%\n\nindustry: 26.3%\n\nservices: 70.6% (1999)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 6.1% (2001 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\ntotal:30,900 (1996)\n\nby occupation:industry 19%, services 71%, agriculture 10% (1989)\n\nUnemployment rate: NA%\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues:$249 million\n\nexpenditures: $262 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1998 est.)\n\nIndustries: tourism; fishing; processing of coconuts and vanilla, coir (coconut fiber) rope, boat building, printing, furniture; beverages\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1992)\n\nElectricity - capacity: 33,000 kW (1995)\n\nElectricity - production: 160 million kWh (2000)\n\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 148.8 million kWh (2000)\n\nAgriculture - products: coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava (tapioca), bananas; broiler chickens; tuna fishing (expansion under way)\n\nExports:\n\ntotal value: $182.6 million (f.o.b., 2001)\n\ncommodities: fish, cinnamon bark, copra, petroleum products (re-exports)\n\npartners : UK 48.1%, Italy 23.1%, France 14.8%, Netherlands 2.7% (1999)\n\nImports:\n\ntotal value: $360.2 million (f.o.b., 2001)\n\ncommodities: manufactured goods, food, petroleum products, tobacco, beverages, machinery and transportation equipment\n\npartners: Italy 13.3%, South Africa 10.7%, France 9.9%, UK 8.0%, Singapore 7.7% (1999)\n\nDebt - external: $240 million (1999 est.)\n\nEconomic aid:\n\nrecipient: $16.4 million (1995)\n\nCurrency: 1 Seychelles rupee (SCR) = 100 cents\n\nExchange rates: Seychelles rupees per US dollar - 5.7458 (January 2002), 5.8575 (2001), 5.7138 (2000), 5.3426 (1999), 5.2622 (1998), 5.0263 (1997)\n\nFiscal year: calendar year\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones: 19,635 (1997)\n\nTelephone system:\n\ndomestic : radiotelephone communications between islands in the archipelago\n\ninternational: direct radiotelephone communications with adjacent island countries and African coastal countries; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean)\n\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 2, shortwave 2 (1998)\n\nRadios: 42,000 (1997)\n\nTelevision broadcast stations: 2 (plus 9 repeaters) (1997)\n\nTelevisions:11,000 (1997)\n\nTransportation\n\nRailways: 0 km\n\nHighways:\n\ntotal:280 km\n\npaved:176 km\n\nunpaved: 104 km (1997)\n\nPorts and harbors: Victoria\n\nMerchant marine: none\n\nAirports: 14 (2001)\n\nAirports - with paved runways:\n\ntotal : 7\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n\n914 to 1,523 m:4\n\nunder 914 m: 2 (2001)\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\n\ntotal : 7\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 3\n\nunder 914 m: 4 (2001)\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitary branches: Army, Coast Guard, Marines, National Guard, Presidential Protection Unit, Police Force\n\nMilitary manpower - availability:\n\nmales age 15-49: 23,210 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\n\nmales : 11,554 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $11 million (FY01)\n\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 1.8% (FY01)\n\nTransnational Issues"
