        "text": "Seychelles: one of Africa's most treasured archipelago.\n\nEmbracing Seychellois hospitality and warmth\n\nEver wondered what it feels like living in Africa's smallest country? I bet you haven't the slightest feeling, but judging from experiences garnered from touring in isolated rural locations including travels to the countryside, you can boast of having experience. But it can't be compared with living in Seychelles. The amazing feeling of peace and innate quiet.\n\nSeychelles is the least populated sovereign African country with an estimated population of about 100,000 people.\n\nFamously known for its islands and beautiful beaches, Seychelles is slowly becoming a favorite tourist sensation and a home for expatriates. It is famously known as one of the tourist-friendliest locations in Africa.\n\nThe Seychellois are peaceful, friendly, kind, and accommodating. Most tourists and expats often almost never leave with complaints. There are rarely dangerous animals in these locations, just domesticated dogs that attack people, but on a few recorded occasions.\n\nCrime rates in Seychelles are relatively low with just a few crimes documented each year. It's safe to call the place a safe haven for tourists.\n\nSeychelles is a multilingual country. There are three languages spoken in Seychelles, they include; Creole, English, and French. But the Seychellois prefer to speak Creole often regarded as Seychellois Creole.\n\nThe Seychellois Creole is a French-based Creole. More than 98% of its vocabulary can be traced back to the French language of the 17th and 18th centuries, via the French settlers who arrived in the Seychelles from Mauritius and Réunion.\n\nCommon Phrases of the Seychellois Creole include;\n\nWi: Yes\n\nNon: No\n\nOrevwa: Goodbye\n\nOli toilet?: Where's the toilet?\n\nMersi: Thank you\n\nMon apel: My name is\n\nKomman Sava?: How are you?\n\nAllo: Hello.\n\nThe Seychellois Creole is basically broken-French. It's like the West African Pidgin commonly spoken by Nigerians, Cameroonians, Ghanaians etcetera, is broken English laced with some local languages.\n\nIn common, with subtropical Africa, there are two seasons in Seychelles. This include; The wet and dry season. The heaviest rains fall between January and February, but the rainy season runs from November to March. The dry seasons are seen usually between May through October.\n\nThe luxury holidays in Seychelles are available all year round, and the sea is calmer between April and October. Seychelles is the perfect country for a honeymoon visit, regarded by so many as one of the many paradises on earth. In Seychelles, there are no major natural hazards, no serious disease, no malaria and the island itself is situated outside the hurricane zone. If you are planning a trip here you will find that tourism is well-protected and tourists rarely face any trouble which regards crime at least.\n\nHere are a number of beautiful places to visit when you plan your next visit to Seychelles:\n\nTHE MAHÉ ISLAND\n\nMahé Island is the largest island and one of the most popular places to visit in Seychelles. Mahé boasts of verdant forests, the highest mountain ranges of Seychelles, and over 65 beaches with a vast diversity of flora and fauna. The island is also famous for the Beau Vallon beach and the numerous tourist attractions of Victoria city – one of the tiniest capital cities of the world. You will never get enough of this island if you visit for one day.\n\nTHE PRASLIN ISLAND\n\nPraslin Island is another beautiful place to visit while in Seychelles. It is also referred to as the Isle de Palme.\n\nThere are hotels built on this Island which even makes it more blockbuster. Rare species of black parrots are found on this Island, so tourists are often advised to carry along binoculars that would make observing these parrots easier.\n\nTHE COUSINE ISLAND\n\nThis beautiful Island is home to endangered and exotic species of birds and animals. These include, inter alia, Seychelles brush warbler, hawksbill turtle, Seychelles magpie robin, Seychelles turtledove, and wedge-tailed shearwater. This is an untouched granite island and this place is also an especially ecologically private one. This is the perfect Island for tourists seeking privacy.\n\nTHE MOYENNE ISLAND\n\nThis Island is home to Giant Tortoises that roam here freely, the old ruins, and the pirate graves. Located towards the north coast of Mahe island, this island was abandoned until a Yorkshire editor purchased it in late 1960s and was the only person to inhabit the island until his death in 2012. As of now, this place remains a nature reserve and is visited by many tourists from all across the world as part of some organized trips.\n\nANSE LAZIO\n\nAnse Lazio is ranked as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world as per multiple international surveys. Anse Lazio is famous for its shady Takamaka trees, white sand, and glittering waters. The beach offers ample opportunities for swimming and snorkeling. The picturesque beach makes it one of the must-visit tourist attractions in Seychelles for a honeymoon trip.\n\nANSE GEORGETTE\n\nMuch like its popular counterpart, Anse Georgette is a beach of breath-taking beauty. But what makes Anse Georgette so special is that it is less busy and more intimate. This makes it one of the best locations to visit for a honeymoon.\n\nBEAU VALLON BEACH\n\nThe Beau Vallon Beach is among the most popular tourist attractions in Seychelles. The beach offers watersports – such as jet skiing and water skiing – and picturesque views of Silhouette Island. Also known to be one of the most commercial beaches in Seychelles.\n\nVictoria: Where Seychellois culture and modernity converge.\n\nTHE SEYCHELLES NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM\n\nOne of the most important tourist attractions of Seychelles, the National History Museum in Victoria city exhibits flora, fauna, and geological history of the archipelago. The museum also imparts awareness about the major environmental problems so as to preserve the natural heritage.\n\nThere are other beautiful places to visit while in Seychelles, but these places listed are a standout. The capital of Seychelles, Victoria, is located on its largest Island the Mahé Island.\n\nIt's important to remember that Seychelles is one of the 48 countries in Africa that offer free visa and entry. So next time you are in doubt of where to visit, Seychelles is one sure destination to have in mind."
