        "text": "Category: Africa Indian Ocean - Seychelles - Careers - Interviews and portraits - Career - Interviews\n\nInterview made by Vanessa Guerrier-Buisine on 2024-08-08\n\nWe took advantage of one of the rare moments of calm in Thomas Matrat's professional life to talk to him about his career and his vision of an international career. It was an opportunity to discover this free spirit's attachment to the hospitality industry, which offers him a wealth of personal, cultural and professional contacts.\n\nWith his smile, kind nature and refreshing spontaneity, Thomas Matrat embodies the quintessence of hospitality. So, it's hardly surprising that it's in the field that the Sales Director thrives most. There, he excels at forging lasting relationships at trade shows, workshops and guest visits.\n\nThe 32-year-old from Burgundy began his career after completing a BTS in Accommodation Management at the Lycée François Rabelais in Dardilly. His first experiences took him to Corsica and the Alps, before he settled in Paris at the Pullman Montparnasse. Ambitious and determined, he continued his studies at the CMH in Paris, obtaining a degree in International Hotel Industry Management, before joining the Hilton group in Portugal for a work placement. The Conrad Algarve was to be his springboard before he took a leap to the Maldives in 2017. There, he made rapid progress in sales, honing his expertise and his obvious penchant for luxury resorts.\n\nBack in Portugal, he tried his hand at other luxury hotel groups, but found himself reminiscing about his time with the Hilton Group that an opportunity prompted him to take off again for the Seychelles. Now Sales Director for the country's six Hilton resorts, Thomas Matrat sails between Europe and the tropical island nation. Captivated by Hilton's values, he has discovered the American company to be the ideal environment for his personal and professional growth.\n\nThomas Matrat shared his enthusiasm and his experience as a French living abroad with Journal des Palaces. Discover how he blends professionalism and humanity to forge a successful international career in the luxury hotel industry.\n\nWhat is your current role with the Hilton Group in the Seychelles?\n\nI oversee sales for Waldorf Astoria Seychelles Platte Island, Mango House Seychelles LXR Hotels & Resort, Canopy by Hilton Seychelles Resort, Hilton Seychelles Northolme Resort & Spa, Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa, and DoubleTree by Hilton Seychelles Allamanda Resort & Spa, specifically targeting the European market.\n\nIn my role, I travel frequently to find new guests and to maintain relationships with our existing partners. My primary mission is to meet the objectives for the six resorts by implementing new strategies and leading my team across Europe.\n\nGiven my frequent work travel throughout Europe, I aim to spend time in the Seychelles each quarter. I spend two to three weeks in the archipelago discovering the latest hotel developments, meeting the teams and immersing myself in local life. It's the best way to promote the resorts at trade shows, workshops, and guest visits I make in Europe.\n\nWhen did you set your sights on a career in the international luxury hotel industry, and what were your motivations?\n\nI started my studies in hospitality because my dream was to work for the Ritz in Paris, a hotel that has always fascinated me. Although I didn't join the Ritz, new opportunities arose, particularly in the Maldives.\n\nInternships abroad were a compulsory part of my training. Hence, it brought me to Scotland and Portugal at a very young age. I was thrilled to meet new people and experience different cultures. The world is a beautiful place and there's so much to discover. In my mind, considering a career in the luxury hotel industry in France would have meant choosing Paris as my main destination. I was more attracted to resorts and tropical islands. I like selling the dream.\n\nWhen the general manager of the Conrad Algarve hotel where I was working mentioned, a job opening in the Maldives, I seized the opportunity. I was in need of a significant change, and I'm not one to do things halfway. I wanted to continue growing within the Conrad portfolio, and the Maldives perfectly aligned with my aspirations. For me, it was an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone by leaving my current lifestyle behind, while maintaining a work-life balance by staying within the Hilton group.\n\nWhy did you decide to stay with the Hilton Group? What are the Group's values that appeal to you so much?\n\nThe Hilton Group is very much in tune with the times, constantly modernizing and evolving, whilst prioritizes its employees in every aspect. From exclusive preferential rates for team members to providing excellent career development opportunities and comprehensive training programs for aspiring general managers, the company provides team members the opportunity to thrive, grow and succeed.\n\nRecognition is exceptional within the group. The CEO Light & Warmth Award recognizes employees who have excelled. We feel valued and important across the entire Hilton Group, not just within individual brands.\n\nAdditionally, team members are able to participate in task force where one goes to a different property to lend a helping hand for instance, during an opening  it is the companys way of leveraging on the strength of its international team whilst encouraging solidarity throughout the group.\n\nHilton is also committed to creating positive environmental and social impact through its Travel with Purpose programme. The company launched its Travel with Purpose 2030 goals to cut the organizations environmental footprint in half while doubling the investment in social impact across its value chain by 2030 in line with the Sustainability Development Goals objectives and timeline.\n\nWhat were you not prepared for? Is there anything you would have liked to have known before leaving for abroad?\n\nApart from the administrative aspect, I think the biggest difficulty I encountered was the culture shock. In the Maldives, I wasn't prepared, so I had to adapt to the different cultures, religions, and perspectives between the expat community and the local population. Ramadan, which is widely celebrated in the Maldives, including prayer times in the workplace, was one of the highlights of this adaptation. This immersion in local customs broadened my understanding and appreciation of various religions, cultures, and the diversity of the world.\n\nIt's been the same since I started working in the Seychelles. Although French is one of the country's official languages, the culture is very much Creole, with the rhythm of island life. It's important to understand that even though I work and have my work permit in the Seychelles, I'm not a Seychellois.\n\nOne aspect I've had to adapt to is the variation in legislation between countriescovering job protection, salary conditions, social security, and pensions. These differences require careful planning.\n\nWhat do you think are the benefits, and possibly the challenges, of international experience?\n\nIt's easy to find yourself isolated, far from family and friends, but very quickly new people join your circle of acquaintances. I've been able to improve my English considerably because in my case, immersion is more beneficial to my learning than being in the school system.\n\nWorking abroad is a luxury that allows me to discover new methods and strategies across various destinations and properties. It also provides the opportunity to travel extensively; being based in a country far from France enables me to visit nearby countries that are otherwise distant from France.\n\nIs the French community in your destination large? Is it easy to integrate locally?\n\nIntegration is very straightforward. Typically, if one work in the hospitality industry, you are sociable and friendly by nature, which makes things easier. I wasn't surrounded by French in the Maldives, but in the Seychelles, the French community is bigger. I tend to prefer to mingle with the locals to fully immerse myself in the country.\n\nIt's always nice to talk to other French about our experiences, but I prefer to get to know people from all over the world who enrich my knowledge of cultural and religious differences. That's why I'm always curious and ask many questions of the locals, who then see that I'm genuinely interested in them, and naturally take me under their wing.\n\nYou live between Europe and the Seychelles. What do you enjoy most about living in Seychelles, both professionally and personally? Can you give some concrete examples?\n\nCompared with the Maldives, which is an island hotel from which you rarely leave, in the Seychelles there is a plethora of possibilities. You can mingle with the locals, go to the cinema, shopping, organize a cook-out, hiking, etc. For instance, I adore, going to the beach for a morning swim and to catch the sunrise for a positive start to the day. I also enjoy visiting local restaurants or discussing typical dishes with my colleagues so that I can recreate them later\n\nFrom a professional perspective, I like the fact that the team is very close-knit. We manage six resorts, with a total of 408 rooms and villas. That means we must be organized and meticulous. The head of sales plays a vital role in our team and even though I'm the only French in a multicultural team that includes people from South Africa, local Seychellois, Germany, Mauritius, etc., we're all united by the challenge we've been tasked with since we arrived.\n\nWhat advice would you give to luxury hotel industry professionals who want to work abroad? And to young people just starting out in their careers?\n\nI'd say go for it! They shouldn't be afraid because it's an unforgettable and enriching experience.\n\nI'd also advise them to think about their retirement and make contributions. To achieve this, you need to contact the pension fund for French living abroad to make sure you don't lose your rights. Someone I know went to the United States for a few years and, when they reach retirement age, they had to work longer to recuperate their lost years of pension contribution. This may not seem like a priority at the start of your career, but it's an important choice to make. It's a shame not to do it and regret it later because then you work intensively all your life, only to miss out when it's time to end your career.\n\nWhen you start working abroad, it can be challenging to return to France because you quickly get a taste for it, and opportunities open very quickly.\n\nMore generally, what advice would you give to a young person who wants to make a career in the luxury hotel industry?\n\nI'd recommend never hesitating, being willing to step out of your comfort zone and being open to criticism. We all make mistakes, but we learn from them, just like when you learn a new language.\n\nThe luxury hotel industry is a unique realm that opens countless doors and allows for personal growth. Entering this field requires passion and a thirst for new adventures.\n\nIn the luxury hospitality industry, substantial budgets are allocated to fulfil guests' dreams and desires. This makes delivering on promises not only exciting but also incredibly satisfying.\n\nBe strong-minded and courageous to do it. You must seize the first opportunity because it will be a springboard. It's prestigious to work in luxury, and it's a wonderful world for those who are passionate about it."
