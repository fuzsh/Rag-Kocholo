Visit cdc.gov for the latest information.\n\nTravel Advice\n\nYour health and safety are important to us. For advice on how to stay safe while on charter, please review our Travel Advice Information. Current travel and safety information can be obtained by visiting travel.state.gov\n\nSwim Safe\n\nTake extreme care when swimming or snorkelling in the Seychelles, even on organised excursions, and particularly with children or the elderly.\n\nBeaches which are safer at certain times of the year can be dangerous for swimming at other times.\n\nBeaches at the southern tip are not recommended for swimming at any time.\n\nSeek local advice about the conditions before you visit beaches.\n\nSnorkel vests, Life Jackets and Diver Down flags are all available on board.\n\nChildren\n\nTalk to children about water safety at the start of a vacation, making them aware of the potential dangers.\n\nAccidents can happen at any time on vacation, but often they happen on the first and last day, so keep watch and do not get distracted when your children are playing by, or in the water.\n\nChildren in or near water should always be supervised by an adult and never left unattended.\n\nGet in the water with them, it is easier to keep an eye on them as well as good fun. Floatation devices are highly recommended for children but are not a substitute for supervision.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings\n\nCheck warning flags and signage on the beach and only swim where it is permitted. Not all beaches have safety information, and you should not assume they are safe.\n\nBeware of dangerous currents, these can be extremly powerful in the Seychelles. Not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags.\n\nBeware of underwater hazards, such as reefs, rocks, sudden changes in depth and marine life.\n\nNever swim where a sign says not to e.g. in zoned areas for jet boats or jet skis.\n\nNever swim at night or after drinking alcohol.\n\nLook out for others\n\nNever swim alone, ‘buddy up’ with others in your party and use the snorkel vests provided.\n\nKnow how and where to get help. If you see someone in difficulty; raise the alarm, preferably the emergency services. Ensure you know the correct number for the country you are in.\n\nDo not overestimate your ability\n\nConsider swimming lessons before you go if you think it would be useful to learn proper swimming technique.\n\nEven if you regularly swim in a pool, remember that open water swimming can be very different.\n\nSafety\n\nAll yachts are equipped with adult life jackets, harnesses, snorkel vests & diver down flags. You can see all this equipment demonstrated in our online safety briefing, and we strongly recommend that you make use this equipment during your vacation. This safety equipment will be displayed in the saloon of your boat on boarding – If you have any questions feel free to ask our base staff during your briefing.\n\nWe have a very limited supply of children’s life jackets on base so highly recommend that if you are travelling with children, you bring their own. This ensures that children have correctly fitting jackets that are comfortable for them.\n\nChildren should not be allowed in the dinghy without a life jacket or buoyancy aid and should wear a buoyancy aid or harness whilst on deck.\n\nChildren under the age of 16 should not operate an outboard engine and should be supervised at all times when in the dinghy.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nThe Moorings offers comprehensive travel insurance for your peace of mind.

For the Amirantes an authorization is required.\n\nMooring Areas: any mooring on the nearby islands except Police Bay, in the south of Mahe, Coco Islands and Grand Anse in Praslin (Dangerous access).\n\nIn the Marine Parks and Beau Vallon Bay in Mahé, the anchorage is restricted.

The Moorings team will take care of it for you.\n\nVisiting the islands: The owner’s permission must always be obtained before visiting private islands. Some islands or moorings are forbidden for environmental and conservation reasons. Taxes are payable to go ashore on some islands. Taxes vary from one island to another.\n\nAnything else you need to know will be explained during the chart briefing.\n\nIt is strictly forbidden to sail alone, we require two persons minimum on board.\n\nDeck Hand\n\nPlease note that a deck hand is a legal requirement in the Seychelles if travelling to the outer islands.\n\nCharts & Pilot Books\n\nAll the charts and pilot books you will need for the sailing area are issued at your chart briefing.\n\nNighttime Sailing\n\nYou must be moored at least one hour before sunset. Night Sailing is not allowed without permission from the base manager. The decision to allow night sailing is based on your skill level and can be requested in advance. You will need to fill out the Sailing or Power resume for the base to review but we cannot guarantee approval.\n\nMooring/Buoying\n\nAn IA system as in Europe. Red cylindrical buoys and even numbers to port; green cones with odd numbers to starboard. The channel leading to Victoria Harbour is perfectly well marked by numerous buoys. However, in the Seychelles, buoyage is poor and limited to some scattered buoys. Do not hesitate to ask our base manager if you have any doubts.\n\nNautical Charts & Documents\n\nMost nautical charts of Seychelles are of British origin (Admiralty Charts).There are four maps which give the depth in meters.\n\nN° 721 : This map, to 1/750 000 scale covers the zone of Mahe and neighboring islands up to Bird and Denis to the north. It also covers the Amirantes to the west, Astove to the SW and Coetivy to the SE.\n\nN° 722: Access to Victoria and harbor. Scale: 1/25 000.\n\nN° 724: This map gives details of some of the islands of the Seychelles with different scales (Desroches Island, Bird Island, Denis, Curieuse and the north coast of Praslin the passage between Praslin and La Digue with Saint Anne Baie).\n\nN° 740: Scale 1/300 000. Covers Mahe and neighboring islands and stretches to the north up to Bird and Denis Island.\n\nN° 742: This map covers Mahe and neighboring islands up to Aride Island to the west and Frégate Island to the east. Scale: 1/125 000.\n\nThe Pilote Cotier – Beneteau N°15 (Voiles et Voiliers – Alain Rondeau) is the first nautical guide covering the Seychelles, in English and French. Some abstract information concerning the islands can be found in the Nautical Instruction N° L9 of the Hydrographic Service of the French Naval Ministry (SHOM) and the sailing Direction N°3 of the British Admiralty.\n\nHazards\n\nWe would like to draw your attention to two of the most frequent causes of accidents in our region:\n\nRunning Aground & Propeller fouling.\n\nTowing In Seychelles. It frequently happens that the captain of a vessel that has taken another vessel (or a vessel that has been abandoned) into tow has the right to claim ownership or compensation for the towed boat. To prevent any unpleasantness from being towed, always be sure to have enough fuel, to avoid going aground or damaging the propeller shaft. Do not be towed for a minor problem. Beware that assistance at sea is an obligation, and towage can be negotiated. If towage is really necessary for the safety of the crew and the boat, come to an agreement before a witness (use the VHF). Never take the other boat’s towline, it is like handing your boat over to them. Instead, give your own towline and should they refuse, their intentions become obvious. Inform the base as soon as possible so they can take the necessary steps with the insurance company.Moorings Fees & Taxes\n\nThere are landing and visitor fees for certain islands. The amount per person/per cruise for one week is approximately 100€. We advise you to anticipate a small cash reserve on board to cover these fees. You will then avoid trying to find the money at the time of landing. These fees are usually paid in foreign currency to the island’s custodian who will provide you with the tickets. The fees listed below are provided as a guideline. Fee can also be paid in USD.\n\nSte Anne Marine Park: Open daily from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm. 15€ per person per day + 100 SCR for the boat for night mooring\n\nIle Coco Marine Park: Open daily from 8:30am to 5:00pm. 15€ per person per day\n\nCousin Island: Open Monday to Friday, in the morning only. 30€ per person.

Walking tours are an excellent way to see the islands’ exotic flora and fauna. Guided tours can be arranged through hotels and Travel Services Seychelles, or you can set out on your own, for the excellent trails on Mahe, Praslin, Silhouette and Aride in particular.\n\nBird Watching\n\nBird watching Visitors come from all over the world to see some of the rarest birds on Earth. Eleven species are only found in the granitic Seychelles, including the Magpie Robin (now only on Fregate), the Seychelles Warbler (its refuge, Cousin Island, is now a reserve) and the only remaining Indian Ocean flightless bird, the White-throated Rail on Aldabra. Huge seabird colonies exist on Bird Island and on Aride with 10 breeding seabird species. Migrants from both Arctic and Antarctic regularly turn up and, in fact, many new Seychelles species were first spotted by birding visitors.\n\nNightlife\n\nOther than a few theatres and discos, most nightlife is in the larger hotels. The specialty is local entertainment. “Camtolet” music, originating in a mix of waltzes, polkas and quadrilles often accompanied by dancers, is performed. Moutia, an African dance form based on prayers which slaves turned into work chants, is typical drums and rhythm. And, of course, the famous Sega dance. Many hotels offer evening barbecues, dances and folk singing. Typically, the larger hotels will have more entertainment on more days while the smaller ones will have one or two person bands. There also is the fabulous Casino des Iles on Praslin.\n\nInteresting Sites\n\nPlease visit the Itinerary Page for more of the best places to visit on your trip.

From M ay to Octob er southeasterly winds blow almos t const a ntly with clear s kies. T hose winds d rop in Novem b er, giving way to northeasterly winds bringi ng heavy r ain cloud s . The heaviest rainfall is in January and can reach 370mm/4.5 in. Th e patte r n of south e aster l ywinds r eturn s in April . In between these two periods there are two shorts periods of flat calms or light winds. April and May are the sunniest months; however, the cloudiest months still manage a daily average of five and a half hours of sun. These slight climate changes barely affect the temperature, which remains at a steady 82°F to 86°F (28°C to 30°C) and the level of humidity which is close to 80% year-round. In the Seychelles, weather is constantly changing. Neither rain nor sun ever become set for long periods.\n\nThe entire Seychelles area is subject to currents that develop with the monsoon.\n\nThe NW monsoon gives rise to a current to the East from December to April. Its average speed is 1.5 knots, though speeds of 4 knots have been recorded locally. In April the current reverses. From June to September, currents flow westwards at a regular rate of 1.2 knots but passages through flats can increase the speed to approximately 4 knots. The return to currents flowing east takes place in December.\n\nHistorical weather (averages by month):\n\nTides\n\nTides are semi-diurnal and asymmetrical with a gap of about six hours between high tide and low tide. The tidal range is as low as 1.80 m at spring tides and 1.40 m at neap tides.Tides give rise to currents which can be quite strong in the straits between the Islands or in the channel leading to lagoons, which may empty completely at low tide.There can be quite considerable differences in height between the two daily high tides. On y our yacht y ou will find a tide table f or your refer e nce.\n\nWeather forecast\n\nWhen you arrive at the base, we will provide you with a weather forecast for the next 24 hours. SBC, Seychelles Boarding Corporation, the public radio of Seychelles on medium wave 1368 KHz, broadcasts a weather report in Creole between 7.30 a.m. and 8.15 a.m. The same weather bulletin is broadcast in English between 8.30 a.m. and 8.45 a.m. Seychelles Radio can provide a forecast on request on VHF channel 16.
