        "text": "The national languages of Seychelles are Seychellois Creole, English and French.[1] Seychellois Creole, a French-based creole language, is by far the most commonly spoken language in the archipelago and is spoken natively by about 95% of the population. Nevertheless, the country was a British colony for over a century and a half, and the legacy of British Seychelles made English remain the main language in government and business. French was introduced before the British rule.[2] It has remained in use largely because it is used by the Franco-Seychellois minority and is similar to Seychellois Creole.\n\nLanguages of SeychellesOfficialEnglish, French, Seychellois CreoleSignedSeychelles Sign LanguageKeyboard layout"
