        "text": "Old Vladivostok is known for its great mix of architectural styles: Orthodox Christian chapels and Lutheran churches, places in German Gothic and Romanesque style, and intricate Russian Baroque and Asian architecture.\n\nThere are even buildings that boldly combine several styles in one! You can see this amazing variety during a 30-minute walk from the train station to Pushkin Theater.\n\nVladivostok Train Station\n\nOne of the oldest and most beautiful buildings of the city, the Vladivostok Train Station, is the first thing people will see when arriving here by train.\n\nThe Vladivostok Train Station was founded in 1891, simultaneously with the Trans-Siberian railroad. The Crown Prince Nikolai Alexandrovich (future Russian Emperor Nicholas II) personally participated in the ceremony.\n\nIn 1912 the original simplicity of the building design was changed to match the Russian baroque style of the Yaroslavsky Train Station in Moscow, symbolizing the unity of the great Russian Empire.\n\nThe Brynner House\n\nWalking вown Aleutskaya Street from the train station towards the city center, you will see the Brynner House, a light three-story building constructed in the early 20th century.\n\nYulius Brynner was born in Switzerland. At the end of 19th century he immigrated to Vladivostok via Japan and soon became one of the richest and most powerful entrepreneurs in Vladivostok. His grandson, Yuliy Brynner, was born in Vladivostok in 1920 and very soon after left Russia with his family. In America he made a brilliant movie career, known by his fans as Yul Brynner.\n\nIn 2012, a statue of Yul Brynner was erected in front of the home where he was born. His son, Rock Brynner, a special guest of the Pacific Meridian International Film Festival, participated in the ceremony.\n\nThe \"Grey Horse\"\n\nTwo tall buildings (#17 and #19) on your way to the center that stand out from the rest of the buildings on the street are jointly called the \"Grey Horse\". The architectural style is best described as Stalin’s Empire; back in the 1930s, these 7 to 8-story buildings were the tallest structures in Vladivostok.\n\nVersailles Hotel\n\nWalking past the Arsenyev Primorye Museum and going uphill towards the sea, at the very beginning of Svetlanskaya Street you will see the Art Nouveau building of Versailles Hotel, erected in 1909. By design, it is an upscale hotel with boutiques and a fancy restaurant. Admiral Kolchak, Somerset Maugham, Bertolt Brecht, and Ho Chi Minh all stayed at this hotel at one time or another.\n\nThe GUM Department Store\n\nBuilt in 1882–1884 by the \"Kunst and Albers\" Trading Company, the GUM Department Store is one of the most magnificent landmarks of Vladivostok. All construction materials were brought by sea from Europe, including the cast iron gates, bricks, and tiles. The building was restored in the early 20th century, preserving the art nouveau style that we know today.\n\nThe Pushkin Theater\n\nBuilt in 1907–1908, the Pushkin Theater was the largest center for the arts and culture in Vladivostok before the Soviet Revolution of 1917. The building changed many hands and served many purposes during its long life; today, the Far Eastern Federal University has taken the Pushkin Theater \"under its wing\"."
