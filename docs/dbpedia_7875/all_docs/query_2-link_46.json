        "text": "Yul Brynner was an ‘Academy’ award-winning actor. A terrific performer, Brynner impressed millions of viewers with his skills, looks, and bustling energy. Born as a Russian, he made his way in acting in the United States. Though he has played a variety of roles in films and theatre, he is best remembered for his role of ‘King Mongkut of Siam’ in the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical ‘The King and I’ for which he won two ‘Tony Awards’ and an ‘Academy Award’ for the film version. He played ‘King Mongkut’ 4,625 times on stage. He shaved his head to portray his character in 'The King and I' and went on to maintain the look as a personal trademark after becoming known for his shaved head. While ‘The King and I’ was the magnum opus of his career, he did several other films, including ‘The Ten Commandments,’ ‘Anastasia,’ ‘The Ultimate Warrior,’ ‘Westworld,’ and ‘Futureworld.’ Also an accomplished guitarist, Yul Brynner often played gypsy songs in Parisian nightclubs early in his career. Additionally, he was also a television director, model, photographer, and author of several books."
