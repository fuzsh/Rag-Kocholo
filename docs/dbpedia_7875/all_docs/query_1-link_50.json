        "text": "Best known for his two-time Tony and one-time Academy Award-winning role as King Mongkut in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical The King and I, Yul Brynner (1920–1985) was also a musician, a trapeze artist, and a photographer. He was of Swiss, Russian, Romani, and Mongolian descent and spoke 11 languages. The magnetic star lived and traveled the world many times over.\n\nPublished in 1983, The Yul Brynner Cookbook honors the actor’s multicultural experience. It begins with Russian and Japanese dishes, the cuisine of Brynner’s birthplace, Sakhalin Island—alternately claimed by both Russia and Japan—and the Romani and Swiss fare of his mother and father’s heritage, respectively.\n\nBrynner immigrated to China, where he lived for much of his early childhood, and then to Paris in the early 1930s; the cuisines of both countries are thus also featured. The food of Thailand represents the final section, no doubt an homage to the role he performed over 4,000 times.\n\nYou will find a dizzying diversity of dishes:\n\nblini, borsch, and stuffed cabbage\n\nsauteed bamboo shoots, nigiri, and yakitori\n\ndandelion soup, goulash, and rabbit stew\n\nfondue, veal cordon bleu, and chiffon cake\n\nchiao tze, vegetable duck soup, and Szechuan pepper beef\n\ncoquilles St. Jacques, vichyssoise, and souffle Rothschild\n\nmasaman curry, ginger fish, and coconut rice custard\n\nIt is uncommon to find a cookbook that so effectively captures such a range without muddying the subject matter. Not the final word on any cuisine, but worthwhile and engaging, unburdened by the usual kitsch of a celebrity cookbook.\n\nWe offer a Fine first printing of this scarce title. The page edges are beginning to fox, otherwise the book block and case are as new. The jacket is unclipped and Fine, save for the remnants of an old price sticker on the cover."
