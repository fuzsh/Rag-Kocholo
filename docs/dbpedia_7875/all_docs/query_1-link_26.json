        "text": "\"Yul Brynner: The Man Who Was King\" will be presented in the metropolitan area on WNET Channel 13 at 10 PM ET. The hour-long special focuses on Brynner's career and also examines his Russian roots and his early career as a circus clown and acrobat. The documentary features comments from his children, Rock and Victoria, as well as interviews with fellow actors Eli Wallach and Rita Moreno. WNET will repeat the special May 4 at midnight. Yul Brynner was born in Vladivostock, Russia, in July 1915 and made his Broadway debut in a revival of Twelfth Night in 1941. Best known for his work as The King in The King and I, Brynner's other Broadway credits included The Moon Vine, Lute Song and Home Sweet Homer. The actor, who reprised his role as the King of Siam to Academy Award-winning effect in the film of \"The King and I,\" died Oct. 10, 1985 of lung cancer.\n\nFor more information visit www.pbs.org."
