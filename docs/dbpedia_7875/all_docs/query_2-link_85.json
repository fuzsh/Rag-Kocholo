        "text": "Actor. He was the son of Boris Briner, a Swiss-Mongolian engineer and inventor, and Marousia Blagavidova, the daughter of a Russian doctor. Born in their hometown of Vladivostok and named Yuliy after his grandfather, Jules Briner. Raised in Russia, China, and France, he dropped out of school and became a musician, playing guitar in nightclubs with the Russian gypsies. He became an apprentice at the Theatre des Mathurins and worked as a trapeze artist with the famed Cirque d'Hiver company. He traveled to the United States in 1941 to study with acting teacher Michael Chekhov and toured the country with Chekhov's theatrical troupe. In 1941, he debuted in New York as Fabian in \"Twelfth Night\" when he was billed as Youl Bryner. He worked in the TV series, \"Mr. Jones and His Neighbors\" and then starred with his wife, Virginia Gilmore, in the first TV talk show, \"Mr. and Mrs.\" In 1950, he was the director of a children's puppet show on CBS, \"Life with Snarky Parker.\" He made his film debut in \"Port of New York\" (1949). Two years later, Mary Martin recommended him for what would become a signature role, the King in Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical \"The King and I.\" He became an immediate sensation in the role, reprising it for film for which he earned the Oscar for Best Actor. Only eight actors have won both a Tony and an Oscar for having portrayed the same role on stage and screen. For the next 20 years, he maintained star status in his film career, appearing in 37 movies, maintaining his unique look throughout. In the 1970s, he returned to the stage and spent most of the rest of his life touring the world in a revival of \"The King and I.\" Beside his Tony and Oscar awards, he was a recipient of the prestigious Connor Award, given by the brothers of the Phi Alpha Tau fraternity of Emerson College in Boston. He also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When he developed lung cancer in the mid-1980s, he made a powerful public service announcement denouncing smoking as the cause, to be broadcast after his death. He died in New York aged only 65 years. He was one of the most fascinating, unusual, and beloved stars of his time.\n\nActor.
