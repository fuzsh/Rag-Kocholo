        "text": "Each year Il Cinema Ritrovato, among its many strands, focuses on the work of a number of directors from different parts of the world, and every year there’s one on an underappreciated director from the Golden Age of Hollywod. This year was the turn of Anatole Litvak, a director I confess to knowing nothing really about, aside from having heard the name (and indeed, that’s part of the point of this strand). Litvak, it turns out, was born to a Jewish family in Kyiv, raised in St Petersburg, and made his first films in Germany in the early-1930s, before making a move to France (for the obvious reasons), then to the United States, where his career flourished. He never won any of the top prizes, though films he directed did win Oscars, usually for acting (most notably, Ingrid Bergman’s win for Anastasia). In the end, I didn’t expect to watch quite as many of his films, but they were mostly screened on 35mm celluloid prints, and they fit nicely into my schedule. Having thus seen eight of his films in close succession (there were five others I didn’t make it to), I didn’t fall head over heels for any one of them, but together they feel like the work of a solid journeyman and a capable craftsman of cinema.\n\nThe earliest of his films I caught at the festival was Cœur de lilas (Lilac, 1932). I suppose you can’t really call this crime film (before it becomes a romance) “poetic realism”, but it does at least bear some relationship to those films being made contemporaneously in France, often also starring Jean Gabin. It’s a film that plays with a grimy underworld (as a cop goes undercover to reveal the titular woman as a murderer before promptly falling for her, a plot apparently as old as cinema, and probably older than that), but it still has a sort of nostalgic haze to it that feels more akin to Marcel Carné than some of the harder edged crime titles that would come later. Gabin is good, of course, iconic even, but the film as a whole is a little underpowered.\n\nHaving fled the Nazis in Europe, Litvak made it to the States, where he still got to make films about where he grew up, such as Tovarich (1937), which takes its name from the Russian for “comrade”. It’s a fun film, despite it being about two former members of Russian aristocracy exiled to France (and played by actors from France, Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert), where they are forced by circumstances to take work as domestic servants. The way the setup is introduced is rather delightful, as we find the two at a 14th July ball in Paris asking everyone they meet why people are celebrating this particular date, only to discover to their horror that it is due to the downfall of aristocracy. Anyway, as the film develops the jokes continue to fly, ably delivered by the leads, who charm their way into everyone’s affections, but then you expect these bankers and capitalists living in their grand mansions to be rather loose in their feelings (both parents and children seem to fall in love with the two). It’s all very charming.\n\nThe following year saw Litvak direct another comedy with an eye-catching title, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938), even more preposterous than the previous. It is such a silly film but it’s nice to have that respite sometimes, especially when everything is so precisely anchored in full silliness as this is, from its title to its screenwriter (Barré Lyndon! a pseudonym, sadly) to the very mannered central performance by Edward G. Robinson in the title role. It’s an urban crime film, it’s a medical thriller, there’s courtroom drama, a bit of romance, and (for me, not reading the credits ahead of time) a surprise appearance by a young and very welcome Humphrey Bogart, who to a certain extent is acting in a different film but that’s sort of his role. As I said it’s daffy and that’s fine.\n\nA couple of years later Litvak moved on to City for Conquest (1940) with a similar type of leading man (compact, punchy: I always get James Cagney confused in my head with Edward G. Robinson). It’s relatively unheralded as a movie, but it may have been my favourite of the ones I saw in Bologna. This is a fun film with a lot of ambition in dealing with New York and intercutting two stories: of James Cagney’s young boxer looking to break into the big time (well, not initially, but he is persuaded to be more ambitious by his love for the leading lady) and Ann Sheridan as a dancer who loves him but has her own career (with a smarmy dancer played by Anthony Quinn). As well as this, the boxer has a brother (a young Arthur Kennedy) who wants to compose the great American symphony but settles for commercial work (the same tune played in a jaunty jazz style, which disgusts Cagney but seems to delight everyone else). The plot feels a little overstretched but everyone puts their best into it and it’s never boring.\n\nPerhaps World War II was the time when Litvak made his best films, because the following year saw Blues in the Night (1941), another underrated film that tries a lot of stuff (not all of it successful, but certainly interesting). I mean, there is a lot going on in this film, at least some of it delightful. The use of montage sequences was excellent (the travelling by map with pointing figures overlaid, the learning piano with keys over the camera, among others), and the interplay between the characters in this itinerant jazz combo was fun. That said the whole story is set up via the titular blues tune played by a group of Black musicians overheard by our (white) protagonists while in an adjacent prison cell, a song which leans heavily on betrayal by a dame and indeed there is one such in the film (Priscilla Lane) who brings nothing but bad luck to our hero (Richard Whorf). And given all that backstory, the choice for his character name (repeated very frequently) feels quite distasteful, so I’ll just refer to it as the J-word. Still, the film itself moves along at a great pace and despite my best instincts I liked it.\n\nSkipping ahead to later in the decade, Litvak continued to push noirish horror with Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). My initial response to this film—which is very much based around a performance (a true, capital-P, Performance) by Barbara Stanwyck—was a sense of exasperation at her character. It is a rising crescendo of panic and shrieking hysteria, as a mad woman trapped in what seems to be a fairly arid marriage (to Burt Lancaster), and confined by her own non-functional body to the top floor of a city townhouse (not really sure why her room is all the way up there) steadily loses her mind more and more after overheating a murder plot. Quite who will be murdered in the end isn’t really much of a spoiler but watching Stanwyck’s flailing performance is to see a woman who has spent her whole life getting what she wants and unaccustomed to any pushback, learning that there are limits even to what money can buy. It’s based on what the credits call a “famous radio play” and one can certainly see how that might have worked but director Litvak is good at expanding out the claustrophobic scenario with some elegant shots.\n\nI don’t personally love a war movie but having emigrated from Europe and having been involved with filming the war effort, Litvak was well-placed to make Decision Before Dawn (1951). It was filmed just after the war in some of the ruined German locations where the events happened and tells a fairly gripping story of a small unit of American officers who recruit Germans to their cause to do infiltration and spying missions. There are a lot of square-jawed heroic types but Oskar Werner is the real central figure as a guy codenamed “Happy” which probably gives you enough of a hint as to his story. Still, it all moves along at pace with plenty of intrigue and some fine filmmaking on show.\n\nThe last of Litvak’s films screened at the festival (though hardly the last film he directed) was probably the biggest production of his career, Anastasia (1956). This widescreen Technicolor pageant of aristocratic white Russians in exile (returning to the idea of his earlier, quite different, Tovarich) certainly has all the hallmarks of a big Hollywood picture, and it’s no wonder it won all those Oscars, including for Ingrid Bergman as lead actress. She of course does some Acting as the (is she? isn’t she?) title character, and given the film suggests her character is essentially that of an actress, the idea that being Anastasia is a performance itself must have been persuasive to the awards judges. I mean her performance is fine and so is that of Yul Brynner as Bunin but they’re both big, of course, as you somewhat have to be when the screen and the costumes and the vast palatial rooms are this big too. Unlikely to be one I’ll be coming back to, attractively mounted though it is."
