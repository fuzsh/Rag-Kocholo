Diána Igaly’s father and mother were sport shooters, so it was no surprise that their daughter took her first shot at the age of six and became a shooter by the age of 13. Within the sport, she specialized in skeet and double trap. Between 1982 and 2007, she was a 22-time Hungarian champion.

Internationally Igaly won four World Championship and six European Championships, earning 32 medals at world competitions. Igaly competed in four Olympics, finishing 42nd in open skeet at Barcelona, 3rd at the inaugural women’s skeet competition in Sydney, became Olympic champion in Athina (with perfect shot of 25/25 in the final), and finished 11th in Beijing.

Before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Diána Igaly took the Official Oath on behalf of Hungarian athletes preparing for the Olympics. Following her career as an athlete, she founded a shooting club in Törökbálint in 2007, where the goal was to educate young people in skeet shooting.

Between 2013 and 2016 Igaly was a member of the General Assembly of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, and actively participated in the work of the Athletes’ Committee. In 2013, she was elected vice-president of the Hungarian Shooting Association and sport director of Hungarian skeet and trap shooting.
