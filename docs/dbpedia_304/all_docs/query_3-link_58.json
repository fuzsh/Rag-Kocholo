        "text": "Michael Phelps won his fourth swimming gold medal yesterday, while drugs and contested results dominated off the field on the sixth day of the Athens Olympic Games.\n\nPhelps took the 200-metre individual medley in Olym-pic record time on a golden night for the United States at the pool. Phelps has two bronze medals, giving him the largest personal haul so far of any athlete in Athens.\n\nDoping again tainted weightlifting with the International Weightlifting Federation suspending Wafa Ammouri of Morocco, Zoltan Kecskes of Hungary, Viktor Chislean of Moldova, Pratima Kumari Na of India, Myanmar's Nan Aye Khine and Sule Sahbaz of Turkey for failing drug tests.\n\nLater in the evening, another Indian weightlifter, Sanamacha Chanu, who finished fourth in the 53-kg category, became the seventh weightlifter to test positive\n\nWhen the depleted competitions started, Liu Chunhong of China broke all the world and Olympic records on her way to gold in the 69-kg weightlifting class.\n\nEszter Krutzler of Germany took silver and 17-year-old Russian Zarema Kasaeva became the young-est medallist in the sport with bronze.\n\nControversy continued at the equestrian venue.\n\nFrance, Britain and the US prepared appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to protest the three-day team results, which downgraded their places when Germany was finally awarded gold.\n\nThe CAS has already dismissed an appeal from Canadian rowers David Calder and Christopher Jarvis over their elimination from the second semifinal of the men's pair event.\n\nAmong the 15 medals awarded yesterday, China won two golds in badminton.\n\nOverwhelming favourite Zhang Ning defeated Audina 8-11, 11-6, 11-7 for the women's singles title. The match came eight years after Audina won silver for Indonesia at age 16.\n\nZhang Jun and Gao Ling edged the British pair of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms 15-1, 12-15, 15-12 in the mixed doubles.\n\nGermany won their fourth gold when Manfred Kurzer took the running target event. It could be the event's last Olympic gold, with the discipline's inclusion for the 2008 Beijing Olympics under review.\n\nDiana Igaly won Hungary's second gold of the games in skeet shooting with a score of 97. Wei Ning of China won the silver in a shoot-off with Zemfira Meftakhetdinova of Azerbaijan.\n\nGreece won the first sailing medal with Sofia Bekatorou and Aimilia Tsoulfa clinching the gold in the 470 sailing class by building an insurmountable lead with one race left.\n\nBritain won its first gold medal of the games when Shirley Robertson, Sarah Webb and Sara Ayton followed suit in the Yngling class.\n\nIn archery, Italian Marco Galiazzo took gold in the men's 70-metre, beating Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan with Australian Tim Cuddihy third."
