        "text": "Hungarian Olympic Triumph!\n\nby Bryan Dawson\n\nDid you know...as of 2016, Hungary ranks 8th in the world in medals at the Summer Olympic Games despite its being torn apart after WWI and losing half her population and 2/3 of her territory. This does not include an additional 6 medals won in the Winter Olympics nor the Hungarians that won medals as nationals of other countries after borders were redrawn or after large-scale emigration.\n\nFerenc Kemeny,\n\nfounding\n\nmember of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe beginnings of the Olympic movement in Hungary go back further than the Games in Athens. Ferenc Kemeny, a great pacifist and member of the International Peace Bureau, was one of Pierre de Coubertin's first kindred spirits, with whom he struck up a friendship in the 1880's.\n\nKemeny took an active part in the Congress for the re-establishment of the Games held in Paris in 1894 and was one of the founding members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin supported Kemeny's suggestion to hold the first Olympics in Budapest in 1896 in honor of Hungary's 1000 years of statehood. While the dream of hosting an Olympics is not yet realized, Hungary has won more Olympic medals than any other nation that has never hosted the Games.\n\nHungary in the Olympics - Select a Year:\n\nFeatured 2000 Olympians\n\nSzilveszter \"Szilas\" Csollany:\n\n(b. 4/13/1970, Sopron, Hungary)\n\n\"Lord of the Rings\"\n\nCaptured the World Championship in 2003 at the \"old\" age of 32 ending his streak of five silver medals in world championships.\n\nLook at this incredible record:\n\n2002 World Champion\n\n2000 Olympics - Gold\n\n1996 Olympics - Silver\n\n1998 European Champion; Silver in 2000\n\n1991 European Cup Champion - Pommel Horse\n\n20-time Hungarian Champion\n\n2-Time \"Sportsman of the Year\" (2000, 2002)\n\n- See this interesting site in Hungarian where he personally answers questions from fans.\n\nZsolt [Madár / Firebird] Erdei\n\n(b. May 31, 1974 in Budapest, Hungary)\n\nWorld Champion Boxer\n\nZsolt Erdei is the former undefeated Lineal & WBO light heavyweight champion, and WBC cruiserweight champion. Erdei is also the first Hungarian to win a world title in two weight divisions.Erdei won the WBO light heavyweight title from Julio César González by unanimous decision on January 17, 2004, and successfully defended the title eleven times. On November 13, 2009, he relinquished his WBO light heavyweight title and moved up to cruiserweight. Erdei defeated Giacobbe Fragomeni on November 21, 2009, for the WBC cruiserweight title. Most of Erdei's matches during his professional career were promoted by Universum boxing, and most were in Europe. In 2011 Erdei decided to have more matches in the USA[2] and fought Samson Onyango and Byron Mitchell as his first opponents there. The Mitchell fight which was set up by Lou DiBella ended with Erdei knocking Mitchell out in the 6th round (TKO)\n\n[More on Wikipedia]\n\n[Watch him on YouTube]\n\nFeatured 2002 Winter Olympian, Dana Antal:\n\n(b. 4/19/1977, Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, Canada )\n\nStar Forward on Canada's \"Golden Girl's\" Hockey Team!\n\nDana's hockey career began in Esterhazy, Saskatchewan at the tender age of five.
