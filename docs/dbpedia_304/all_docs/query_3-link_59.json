        "text": "Perazzi would have a \"MOUNTAIN OF STASTISTICS\" within their factory about their findings and test results about the differences between their 18.4, 18.5, 18.6 & 18.7mm barrels.\n\nA company of Perazzi's quality and stature would not be making 0.1mm barrel increments (being 0.003937007874 inches) in four separate planned stages/alternatives/developments unless the maths and physics behind their decisions guaranteed that there would be a valid outcome and positive benefits for their shotguns and customers.\n\nWhere in the above quote is there any false statement ?\n\nPerrazi have moved on with their barrel technology and for the last several years their 18.4mm Type 2 choke tubes have been OBSOLETE from the Perazzi factory. True, False, or you just don't like that fact either.\n\nPlease tell me your reasoning's why Perazzi do not readily make their 18.4mmm Type 2 choke tubes available.\n\nPerazzi's lack of wanting to supply a specific type/series of choke tube speaks volumes.\n\nJust facts nothing else.\n\nPhil\n\nThe aspect that you are either ignore or are ignorant of is the thing know as \"marketing\". The positive benefits accrued by same are not particularly for customers but decidedly for Perazzi's bottom line. Hype and BS know no boundaries when simple $ are involved and a planned and considered response to a propagandized marketplace is the way of the world. Change is always better cuz we say so and why would we lie? I wonder ............?\n\nIf you believers of BS would care to put some significant $ up I'd be willing to to test any of my obsolete 18.4bore/Type 2 choke Perazzis with plastic wad ammo against whatever so long as Mr. Winston oversees the data collection and analysis since I know that he has no vested interest in ANY particular outcome.\n\nAnd now, sad to say, I must bid a fond, but not reluctant, adieu to this impressive collection of misinformation and Hogwarts Physics. When the BS reaches the current depth it is simply time to move on.\n\nhave a nice day\n\nMr Semperfi\n\nI too have a liking for the Perazzi 18.4mm barrelled shotguns with the Type 2 choke tubes myself, and prefer the L models that are rib-less between the barrels :hand10: got the MX3, the 4 and a 5 when Litt's had a auction to raise cash and also gave Litt's Â£800.00 (GBP) for a cased Mirage with all the extras a month later.\n\nYou are on the wrong track with your comment in your answer, the gist of the discussion was about recoil and softer shooting \"on the shoulder\" and would finish this quick short post by saying that without knocking or finding any faults with the Perazzi 18.4mm barrels, my only observation is that the Perazzi 18.7mm barrels are somewhat better at having/showing some reduction in recoil which the 18.7mm centre ribbed guns show as they are also heavier as well.\n\nPerazzi don't need any help with any Hogwarts Physics or any BS advertising \"They have been consistently winning Olympic Medals since the 1960's\" Pretty sure that their 18.7mm bore trap guns were very well represented in the last Olympics.\n\nYou misunderstand the nitty-gritty of the thread and a little bit touchy.\n\nI will send you a box of fibre wads in the post.\n\nPhil\n\nOlympic use\n\n1964 Tokyo[6]\n\nEnnio Mattarelli ITA.

The bore gauges to be used shall be capable of measuring the diameters set out in Table 1B of Appendix I. Such bore diameter shall be deemed to be that measured at a depth of 23 centimetres from its breech face.\n\nAbove the words METRIC MEASUREMENTS in that diagram the standard short sharp angle of a forcing cone is exampled before and in front of the arrowed \"B bore line\"\n\nThen picture another drawn line \"from the end of the parallel chamber that is intersected by another arrowed line that shows the chamber length\" and continue that line \"all most\" up to the arrowed \"B bore line\" but not of any greater distance/measurement than 20 to 22 centimetres from the barrel breech face.\n\nIf that \"NEW\" forcing cone profile was machined into any 12 gauge barrel there would be \"no way at all\" that any charge of shot would not clear the chamber and bore of the barrel in a smoother bore transition giving a slightly reduced recoil and should someone then additionally choose to overbore the barrels up to the start of any choke constriction there would be a further slightly reduced recoil effect \"but\" tight chokings would put back a slight and minimal recoil effect.\n\nAll of the above would also comply for our British Proof House's approval via a Reproofing Test.\n\nCan you ask Mr. Semperfi where I have gone wrong with the above detail because he is a bit touchy with me ?\n\nAll of the above is very MINIMAL in reducing felt recoil and testing for softer shooting cartridges would also produce MINIMAL recoil relief.\n\nHope I am not offending you with plain logic and a pinch of Physics.\n\nSorry in advance.\n\nPhil.\n\nP.S. >>>\n\nCould also have said \"take your normal choice of 30 gram cartridge unload all of the shot out of it and refill it full of confetti instead of shot. When you pull the trigger the only recoil that you will feel against the breech face which is then transmitted horizontally through to the stock, will only be the smaller bare powder charge recoil because there is not much resistance within the barrel for all of the confetti to negotiate any of the bore reductions and constrictions of the hole barrel length.\n\nQuite nutty over here in some weddings and such other events to have a \"shotgun salute\"\n\nPhil\n\nI'm well aware of the Perazzi record and I applaud it. It has been my pleasure to use Perazzis nearly exclusively for the last 25 or so years. That does not imply that I am ignorant of recent marketing ploys that they have adopted to enhance sales. Good for them. Cashing in on a delusional market is simply good business practice, but it doesn't mean that I have any obligation to actually believe anyone's sales hype. Obviously you and others seemingly do.\n\nAnd now, sad to say, I must bid a fond, but not reluctant, adieu to this impressive collection of misinformation and Hogwarts Physics. When the BS reaches the current depth it is simply time to move on.\n\nThe above comment was directed to the original quest of the OP. And this is just for you\n\nExcept that the drawing in that link is completely misleading.\n\n\"The factory cone\"\n\n\"The lengthened cone\"\n\n\" The forcing cone in a shotgun barrel forces the shot charge or shot column down in diameter in transition from the shotgun chamber to enter the bore\"\n\nThat's not true. The shot charge or shot column is not the diameter of the chamber, since the inside of the hull is closer to 0.740 (Federal Paper) than 0.8. And the drawing then exaggerates the picture anyway.\n\nHere's what an 870's and a Vandalia-rib Krieghoff's forcing cones really look like, If you hold them in your hand, you can hardly tell them apart. Note the fact that inside of shells is a lot smaller than the outside and so the shot charge is smaller too.\n\nNow let's go back a little.\n\nEarly on,\n\n\"Eddie: \"Removing and lengthening the forcing cones does reduce felt recoil.\"\n\nand I asked:\n\n\"How does it accomplish this, Eddie?\" (see message 40 in this thread for a more complete discussion)\n\nNo one has even made a stab at explaining that, as far as I've noticed. In fact, we've come full circle once again.\n\nmxsst: \"If that \"NEW\" forcing cone profile was machined into any 12 gauge barrel there would be \"no way at all\" that any charge of shot would not clear the chamber and bore of the barrel in a smoother bore transition giving a slightly reduced recoil and should someone then additionally choose to overbore the barrels up to the start of any choke constriction there would be a further slightly reduced recoil effect \"but\" tight chokings would put back a slight and minimal recoil effect.\" (Post 126 in this thread.)\n\nSo I'll ask it again.\n\nHow, mxsst, does this work? Please stick to physics and engineering principles and keep it short and sweet. No long diversions into Perazzi's high-quality gunsmithing and marketing or the amazing ways the UK tests gun, please. Just a few, clear sentences on\n\n1. How a smoother transition gives slightly reduced recoil and\n\n2. How \"tight chokings would put back a slight and minimal recoil effect.\"\n\nAgain, please stick to these two question and keep it short.\n\nTwo dogs, you are invited to participate too, of course, also keeping it short, and clear and reality (that is, physics) based.\n\nNeil\n\nYou know, I'm a big Perazzi fan. I got my first over 20 years ago. Shoot one now. Will likely choose a Perazzi as my next gun as well. Their workmanship is second to none in the industry. But, I still take issue with the claim that they moved to overbored barrels as a result of performance. Answering one question would change my mind and I'm sure others. With the premiere research facility and personnel, leading the industry in innovation and technical advances, and a list of winning shooters in all disciplines of shotgunning to the point of dominating the sport, why were they dead last behind Browning, Winchester, Beretta, Benelli and pretty much everyone else in getting a technically advanced, researched and crafted overbored barrel to the market? Could it be that they knew it was the latest \"gotta have\" for \"buy that last target at any cost\" shooters and were waiting for the fad to pass? Surely their research indicated it was a huge improvement over those skinny little, poor performing, old style bores. As the leading innovators in shotgun performance generating winning performances in the shooting sports one would think they would lead the field in technical excellence to build a product that would guarantee their continued dominance.\n\nBut that's exactly not my question, mxsst. In fact, I specifically asked that you not resort to off-point citations like \" the amazing ways the UK tests guns\" and I think you have to give me some credit for so accurately anticipating your next action.\n\nAgain, you wrote:\n\n\"If that \"NEW\" forcing cone profile was machined into any 12 gauge barrel there would be \"no way at all\" that any charge of shot would not clear the chamber and bore of the barrel in a smoother bore transition giving a slightly reduced recoil and should someone then additionally choose to overbore the barrels up to the start of any choke constriction there would be a further slightly reduced recoil effect \"but\" tight chokings would put back a slight and minimal recoil effect.\" (Post 126 in this thread.)\n\nAnd my questions were:\n\n\"How, mxsst, does this work? Please stick to physics and engineering principles and keep it short and sweet. No long diversions into Perazzi's high-quality gunsmithing and marketing or the amazing ways the UK tests gun, please. Just a few, clear sentences on\n\n1. How a smoother transition gives slightly reduced recoil and\n\n2. How \"tight chokings would put back a slight and minimal recoil effect.\"\n\nAgain, please stick to these two question and keep it short.\"\n\nNo one here as ever tried to address any of that, and since you are an apparent proponent who understands these things, I think it's up to you to explain how it works.\n\nYours in Sport,\n\nNeil\n\n:hand26: Neil, us Brits have been at this bore tweaking and fettling malarkey a bloody long time :3a:\n\n\"On the 15th of June 1893 Horatio F. Phillips, sometimes gun editor of THE FIELD, was granted a patent in which, âThe gun barrels of shot guns are made of diminishing internal diameter for the cartridge chamber to the muzzleâ¦\"\n\nProving that extending forcing cone geometry has been around a long time, and it was claimed that even though the muzzle diameter was reduced down to 18 gauge and others down to 20 gauge that there was less vibrational recoil transmitted through the stock.\n\nThere is more later it's 01.17 over here\n\nPhil\n\nBack in the '20's and all the way up to the '50's shoe stores almost all had a patented fluoroscopic shoe fitting machine that xrayed people's feet. It was pure-dee Quackery but it was patented. There was also an electric prostate warmer that people with enlarged prostate shoved up their butt to relieve their inability to urinate. Patented. Pure-dee Quackery. But patented. Then there was the Recto Rotor I leave that one to your imagination ....\n\nSo just because a thing is patented does NOT make that thing into the Cat's Pajamas.\n\nBy now, I think, mxsst, readers who have gotten this far will have seen that the claims of reduced recoil resulting from changes to forcing cones have no physical explanation and are just another of the countless mythologies of shotgunning; were it not so at least someone here who believes in this magic would have at least written one word defending the assertion in terms of physics or logic. It has not been done because can't be done.\n\nI had an interesting correspondence with Mr. Digweed, OBE, on May 15th, 2009.\n\nNW: \"Hi George,\n\nI'm a faithful reader of your book and immediate past-president of the Amateur Trapshooting Association in the US. You are being quoted on trapshooters.com as giving up full chokes because you noticed more recoil from them than more open chokes.\n\nhttp://www.trapshooters.com/noframes/cfpages/thread.cfm?threadid=189355\n\nI wonder if you could, in a one-sentence reply, confirm or disconfirm this? Thank you,\n\nNeil Winston\"\n\nHis reply:\n\nGD: \"Dear Neil\n\nNot true at all, I have no idea where people get this rubbish from! I have always used full and full chokes, and will continue to do so.\n\nKind regards\n\nGeorge\"\n\nNW: \"Thanks, George. I appreciate your willingness to help us out.\n\nNeil\"\n\nI've been a fan of his ever since, of course.\n\nNeil"
