        "text": "Michael Phelps, born in Baltimore, Maryland on June 30, 1985, is widely recognized as one of the greatest swimmers and most decorated Olympians of all time. Phelps's passion for swimming was ignited at a tender age of seven, largely inspired by his sisters who were competitive swimmers. His early exposure to the sport, coupled with his natural talent, led him to join the North Baltimore Aquatic Club where he trained under coach Bob Bowman, a relationship that would prove pivotal in shaping his career. Phelps's first taste of international competition came at the age of 15 when he competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, making him the youngest American male swimmer to participate in the Olympics in nearly seven decades. Although he didn't win a medal, his performance was impressive enough to hint at the bright future that lay ahead. It was the 2004 Athens Olympics that catapulted Phelps into the spotlight. He clinched six gold and two bronze medals, setting a new standard in competitive swimming. This was just the beginning of his record-breaking spree; in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Phelps won an unprecedented eight gold medals, surpassing Mark Spitz's record of seven golds in a single Olympics. Beyond his Olympic success, Phelps has also made his mark in other major swimming competitions. He has won numerous World Championship titles and broken several world records. Phelps announced his retirement after the 2012 London Olympics but made a comeback in the 2016 Rio Olympics where he added five more gold medals and one silver to his collection. His total Olympic haul stands at a staggering 28 medals, 23 of which are gold, solidifying his status as the most successful Olympian ever. Phelps's dedication towards his sport, his exceptional skill and his ability to consistently perform at the highest level have left an indelible mark on the world of swimming. He remains an inspiration for aspiring athletes across the globe.\n\nFrederick Carlton \"Carl\" Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete who won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games. Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set world records in the 100 m, 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relays, while his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100 meters 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters 10 times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet 71 times. His accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, \"Olympian of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated and \"Athlete of the Year\" by Track & Field News in 1982, 1983, and 1984. After retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.\n\nMark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former competitive swimmer and nine-time Olympic champion.

Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds, a silver, and a bronze, in addition to five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years, he set 35 world records, two of which were in trials and unofficial. Swimming World Magazine named him World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972.
