        "text": "Lienz, a small town of 12,000 inhabitants, is the capital of East Tyrol – a 750-year-old, yet modern place, bustling with life, with a Mediterranean atmosphere and famous for its historic center. The town gives home to the first and only 5-star luxury wellness hotel in East Tyrol, the Grandhotel Lienz.\n\nSituated at an altitude of 678 meters, the town lies at the confluence of the rivers Isel and Drava, surrounded by the Hohe Tauern National Park (Austria's largest national park) to the north and the stunning Lienz Dolomites, which are said to be among the most beautiful mountains in the world, at around 3,000 meters, to the south. Lienz is also known as the city of sunshine, as it boasts more than 2,000 hours of sunshine a year, 300 of the 365 days of the year are sunny.\n\nThe vibrant town is enlivened by cozy cafés, restaurants and chic shops, and the proximity of Italy is a clear feature of the Lienz lifestyle: people live life here in the spirit of ‘La Dolce Vita’.\n\nPampering luxury\n\nThe first and only 5-star luxury wellness hotel in East Tyrol, the Grandhotel Lienz, opened its doors in April 2009. Situated directly on the banks of the river Isel, Austria's only glacier river, and only a few minutes from the historic center of Lienz, the hotel offers a rich variety of services.\n\nThe owners of the Grandhotel Lienz, the Simonitsch and Westreicher families, are true to their philosophy of pampering their guests not only with luxurious surroundings, but also with a personalized service. Guests can enjoy a host of pleasures in this magical atmosphere: elegant hotel furnishings, spacious rooms and suites to meet the highest standards, exquisite culinary delights and the GrandSpa spa & wellness area are all part of the pampering luxury.\n\nThe 72 luxurious guest rooms (some with a separate children's room) and the four exclusive Royal Suites are decorated in a predominant combination of burgundy, blue and green, combined with gold and dark woods, on each floor, overlooking the beautiful Dolomites and the Schober mountain range.\n\nThe atmosphere of exclusivity and special details is preserved in the five restaurants spread over a total of 640 m². In addition, a bar, an impressive lounge with a fireplace and a multi-level hotel terrace with a magnificent view directly overlooking the banks of the river Isel, serve to ensure a pleasant stay for guests. The hotel is also an exclusive base for lovers of golf, skiing, nature and culture.\n\nCulinary delights\n\nMr. Flaschberger, the hotel's chef, conjures up new and light dishes from old, traditional recipes. His culinary concept is a traditional cuisine of seasonal and regional products, complemented by knowledge of modern nutrition. The 'dolomitic' cuisine aims to give full expression to the region's products.\n\nThe \"5 Sterne Gourmetpension\" – 5-star gourmet catering – includes a buffet breakfast in the morning and a four-course menu in the evening.\n\nThe hotel's wine cellar is available for small to large events for a fee. There is a wine to suit every culinary taste, with 170 different types of wine to choose from. 70% of the wines come from the wine-growing regions of Austria and 30% from all over the world. The wine selection is never brief, as the owners ensure the purchase of 6,000 bottles of wine every year.\n\nGrandspa: spa & wellness\n\nThe Grandhotel Lienz has a spa & wellness area of over 1,400 square meters, with indoor and outdoor pools, seven treatment rooms and a ‘private spa’ for couples. In addition, guests can enjoy a bio sauna, Finnish sauna, several steam baths, a serai bath, relaxation areas and a romantic garden on the banks of the river Isel.\n\nThe rich offer of treatments ranges from serai and wrap baths, ayurvedic treatments, relaxing treatments with aromatic oil, hot lava stone and East Tyrolean Mountain honey massage to medical massages (e.g. lymphatic drainage, sports massage).\n\nMedical care\n\nThe spa and wellness area includes a so-called \"SymbioMed Medical Care\" section (245 m²), where Dr. Peter Lechleitner, a university professor, offers his patients valuable treatments in his private practice. The tests offered range from basic and intensive health assessments, fitness and vascular assessments, slowing down the ageing process, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy and weight reduction.\n\nLEISURE ACTIVITIES IN AND AROUND LIENZ\n\nLienz and its surroundings, a winter and summer holiday paradise, offer a wealth of activities for young and old alike.\n\nSchloss Bruck\n\nThe town of Lienz has a rich historical and cultural heritage. Attractions include Schloss Bruck, Lienz's ancient castle and symbol of the town. The huge castle complex was built in 1252. It became the property of the town in 1943 and has since been home to the town museum. The old tower of the castle offers a magnificent view of the town.\n\nAguntum\n\nThe Romans were the first to settle in the Lienz valley and founded Aguntum, the only Roman city in Tyrol, which flourished during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Today, the ruins of Aguntum and the museum exhibition bear witness to these times, offering a fascinating insight into Roman culture.\n\nOLALA International Street Theater Festival\n\nExtraordinary light shows, breathtaking acrobats and performers, humorous mini-performances and clowns entertain the audience. 90% of the performances are usually free! The Olala Festival has grown to become one of the most important, innovative and exciting festivals of its kind in Europe, and Lienz's summer cultural calendar would be unthinkable without it. Last held before the pandemic, the festival hopes to be back as soon as possible.\n\nKletterpark Lienz\n\nFor endless opportunities to spend active leisure time and a special challenge, every member of the family is welcome to visit the exciting adventure park on the Schlossberg Mountain in Lienz, created in 2010, where young and old can test their skills on sliding rope courses of varying difficulty and at different heights.\n\nActivities in winter and summer\n\nLienz is the starting point for a wealth of sports. The Lienzer Bergbahnen – Lienz Mountain Railways – take visitors up to 2,278 meters. In the summer, you can go hiking or mountain biking in the mountains, or rafting on the Isel glacier river. In winter, Lienz is a skiers' paradise, with two excellent ski areas nearby. The Hochstein and Zettersfeld ski slopes are about a five-minute drive from the hotel. A visit to the cozy mountain huts is, of course, an unmissable program at the stations of the mountain ski routes.\n\nThe 27-hole golf course ‘Dolomitengolf Osttirol’, which is co-operated by the Grandhotel Lienz, is only a 10-minute drive from the hotel."
