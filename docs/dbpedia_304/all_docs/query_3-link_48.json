        "text": "ATHENS, Greece — Russia is one of the biggest, most powerful teams in the world. Already well aware, the United States received another reminder.\n\nStanislav Dineykin had 20 kills and three blocks to lead the Russians to a four-set victory over the Americans, 22-25, 25-20, 25-16, 25-23 on Thursday.\n\nAfter opening with a five-set loss to the Netherlands, Russia has won two straight. With opposite Clay Stanley struggling against a towering Russian block, the United States fell to 1-2.\n\n\"I need to do a better job of seeing that they're there — or hitting it a little sharper or hitting it more down the line,\" said Stanley, who still finished with 22 points.\n\n\"I took a few good swings down the line and I was feeling good on that,\" he said, \"but you can only take so many before they start to figure it out.\"\n\nRussia took its first lead of the fourth set at 14-13, and things went back and forth until Alexey Kuleshov blocked a kill attempt by Stanley to make it 24-22.\n\nThe Americans were only able to fend off match point once. Fittingly, the 7-foot-1 Dineykin ended it with a kill that bounced off Lloy Ball.\n\n\"Both teams played very well, but we made less mistakes,\" Dineykin said.\n\nThat's exactly how the Russians succeed.\n\nAfter falling behind 7-1 and losing the first set, Russia found its rhythm. Nearly impossible to blow out with their grinding, defensive-oriented style, the Russians play a smart, patient game and use their raw power at the net when it matters most.\n\nGiven a spark from reserve middle blocker Andrey Egorchev, Russia won the last three sets. Vadim Khamuttskikh, the bearded, animated setter who is playing in his third Olympics, deftly guided the offense.\n\nDineykin and his fellow blockers frustrated Stanley and the other American hitters, and the Russians' serve was nearly flawless.\n\n\"That's one of the strong points of their game,\" U.S. libero Erik Sullivan said. \"They get up by a couple — that just makes it that much easier for them to do that. I think they hit three balls out.\" -->\n\nStill, the Americans have been playing well — erasing the memory of a winless tournament in 2000.\n\n\"I'm really, really proud of this team,\" coach Doug Beal said. \"We haven't given up a set that the other team hasn't had to play really well to beat us.\"\n\nIn other events Thursday:\n\nSOFTBALL\n\nUnited States 7, Greece 0 (5 innings): Lisa Fernandez pitched a one-hitter Thursday as the two-time defending gold medalist United States won its sixth straight shutout in softball, a shortened-game victory over Greece. Greece (2-4) did all it could. The United States (6-0) simply wore down the Greeks — whose team includes several Americans of Greek ancestry — and put an opponent away after five innings for the fourth time under the so-called mercy rule. China, Japan, Italy and Australia also posted wins Thursday. Canada (2-4) can still make the semifinals but must beat Italy on Friday and hope China (3-3) beats Japan (3-3).\n\nTENNIS\n\nThird-seeded Martina Navratilova won't win an Olympic medal after she and partner Lisa Raymond lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to fifth-seeded Shinobu Asagoe and Ai Sugiyama of Japan in the quarterfinals, one step shy of the medal round.\n\nIn women's singles, top-ranked Justine Henin-Hardenne beat two-time major champion Mary Pierce of France 6-4, 6-4, while No. 2 Amelie Mauresmo outlasted No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-2. French Open champion Anastasia Myskina was the first woman to reach the semifinals, beating Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-1, 6-2.\n\nThe upsets continued on the men's side, with No. 3 Carlos Moya joining Roger Federer and Andy Roddick on the sideline after a 6-2, 7-5 quarterfinal loss to Nicolas Massu of Chile.\n\nChile is guaranteed to win a tennis medal for the first time because Massu's teammate, No. 16 Fernando Gonzalez, followed up his surprise victory over Roddick by beating No. 8 Sebastien Grosjean of France 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.\n\nARCHERY\n\nMarco Galiazzo won Italy's first archery gold medal while the South Korean men kept up an unsuccessful Olympic streak. Galiazzo beat Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan 111-109 for the gold. Tim Cuddihy of Australia, who beat two South Koreans along the way, took bronze.\n\nBADMINTON\n\nChina won the first two gold medals in badminton, with world champion Zhang Ning beating Indonesian-born Dutchwoman Mia Audina 8-11, 11-6, 11-7 in the singles final. China also flaunted its dominance of the sport in mixed doubles, with Zhang Jun and Gao Ling edging the British pair of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms 15-1, 12-15, 15-12 in a thrilling final.\n\nThe bronze medal in the mixed doubles went to Jens Eriksen and Mette Schjoldager. China also won bronze in the singles.\n\nBEACH VOLLEYBALL\n\nBrazilians Emanuel and Ricardo routed Americans Dax Holdren and Stein Metzger 21-17, 21-10 to finish a perfect run through pool play. Despite the loss, the 12th-seeded Americans advanced to the medal round. Later, top-ranked American women Misty May and Kerri Walsh got their toughest test of the tournament but stayed unbeaten with a 21-17, 21-17 win over 10th-seeded Czechs Eva Celbova and Sona Novakova.\n\nBOXING\n\nU.S. medal prospect Andre Ward beat Italy's Clemente Russo 17-9 to advance to the quarterfinals as the Americans finished 6-1 in preliminaries. The Americans sent eight fighters into the second round, with two advancing on byes.\n\nCANOE-KAYAK\n\nFormer Olympic champion canoe racer Joe Jacobi and partner Matt Taylor clinched a semifinal berth in whitewater slalom event. Single American kayakers Brett Heyl and Scott Parsons also advanced to Friday's semifinals and finals\n\nEQUESTRIAN\n\nBritain, France and the United States will jointly appeal a decision to award Germany the gold medal in the three-day equestrian event. The judges gave Germany the gold Wednesday and France the silver, while Britain took bronze. The same officials, concerned that Germany's Bettina Hoy might have crossed the start line twice on the show jumping course, probed further. Judges docked Germany 14 points, dropping it from first to fourth in a decision that lifted the United States to the bronze. Germany then lodged a protest, an equestrian appeals committee reversed the decision of the judges and the Germans reclaimed the gold. The United States was left empty-handed.\n\nFENCING\n\nDamien Touya scored the final touch to give France the team saber title over Italy, 45-42.\n\nTouya also scored the winning touch in a 45-44 semifinal win over the United States. The Americans then lost the bronze-medal bout to Russia.\n\nJUDO\n\nNoriko Anno won the 78kg class in judo, giving Japan its sixth gold medal in 12 judo classes with one day of competition remaining. Ihar Makarau of Belarus beat Jang Sung-ho of South Korea to win the gold medal in the 100-kilogram class after defending Olympic champion and three-time world champion Kosei Inoue of Japan lost in the quarterfinals, his first defeat in major international competition in four years.\n\nROWING\n\nThe American lightweight double sculls team of Steve Tucker and Greg Ruckman gave up too much distance in the six-boat semifinal and was fourth behind Poland, Greece and Denmark — one spot and 3.6 seconds out of contention for Sunday's final.\n\nSHOOTING\n\nDiana Igaly of went a perfect 25-for-25 to win the gold medal in skeet shooting, finishing with a score of 97 to easily outdistance silver medalist Wei Ning of China and bronze medalist Zemfira Meftakhetdinova of Azerbaijan.\n\nWATER POLO\n\nHungary 7, United States 5: Defending Olympic champion Hungary handed the United States its first loss in men's water polo preliminaries. Tamas Varga scored his second goal on an extra-man play to seal the match with 1:27 remaining. Tony Azevedo scored two goals before he hit the post with an attempted equalizer at 6-5, then the Hungarians blocked shots by Layne Beaubien and Wolf Wigo to thwart a furious American comeback attempt in the last minute.\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING\n\nLiu Chunhong of China broke three of her own world records in winning the 152-pound (69kg) weightlifting gold medal. Taner Sagir of Turkey won the gold medal in the 77-kilogram class with 826.5 pounds (375 kg). Sergey Filimonov of Kazakhstan won silver and Oleg Perepetchenov of Russia the bronze.\n\nThe 19-year-old Chunhong, the defending world champion, set records in the snatch of 270 pounds (122.5kg), the clean and jerk of 337 pounds (153kg) and total lift of 606 pounds (275kg). Five weightlifters were suspended for flunking drug tests they took before the Olympics, and 21 world-class weightlifters have been suspended this year."
