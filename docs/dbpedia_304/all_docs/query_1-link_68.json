HCNORABLE WALTER M. PIERCE, Governor of the State of Oregon. Dear Sir: In compliance with Section 4432, Title XXX, Oregon Laws, we have the honor to submit herewith the report of the State Highway Commission for the period December 1, 1922, to November 30, 1924. The Commission appreciates the confidence you have imposed in them in the administration of the state highway program, and expresses its thanks for your helpful counsel. Acknowledgment is made of the cooperation of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and the Forest Service, the assistance given by the County Courts throughout the State and the. many courtesies extended by other state officers. Respectfully submitted, OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION Wm. Duby, Chairman, H. B. Van Duzer, Commissioner, W. H. Malone, Commissioner. Sixth Biennial Report OF THE State Highway Commission State of Oregon 1923-1924 PART ONE The state highway system, because of the rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles and the demand made upon it for better trans- portation facilities, has become an important factor in the economic life of the state. From small beginnings with the enactment of legislation providing for the present organization and present plan of financing, the program has progressed until at the end of the present year, which marks the end of the eighth working season, a network of improved roads has been spread over the state reaching into every coun and affording direct interstate connection as well. The program of the present biennium has, in a large measure, consisted in completing unfinished contracts, placing new contracts to fill gaps in the main through highways, and extending branch highways and connec- tions, aS well as maintaining previous construction, so that travel may secure the maximum benefits from the state highway investment. The state highway system is 4,464 miles in length, of which there has been improved by the Commission to date 720 miles of paving, of which 170 miles are of cement concrete type and 550 miles of bituminous type, 1,861 miles of crushed rock or gravel surfacing and 2,174 miles of grading. ‘These figures do not include the forest roads on the state highway system, which are constructed under the supervision of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, which reports a total of 237 miles of surfacing and 302 miles of grading. In addition there are some counties which have graded or improved sections of state highways with their own forces or by direct ‘contracts and of which this department does not have a record. To be added to the total, also, are the state highways in Multnomah County and through incorporated cities of more than 2,000 population, which have done their own work without assistance from the state. Considering these added mileages, but noting the fact that graded roads have been graveled -and graveled roads have been paved, the present status of the state high- “way system is 879 miles of paving, 1,948 miles of graveled or crushed rock surfacing, 318 miles of graded roads unsurfaced, and 1,318 miles unimproved. There have been approximately 1,000 bridges of standard design over 20 feet in length constructed by the department during the period of its activities. 8 SIXTH BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE The gross expenditures.of the Commission, not including market roads, beginning in 1917, have: been $75,855,012.11, of which $10,532,981.83 is county funds, $7,384,396.89 government funds, $321,257.61 railroad funds and $57,616,425.78 state funds. Of state funds, the sum of $7,452,237.79 has been used in the payment of principal and interest on the bonded indebtedness. WF VEAP ET I Male fad The work accomplished in the biennium by the Commission totals 36.7 miles of paving, divided into 31.5 miles of concrete type and 5.2 miles of bituminous type, 580 miles of rock or gravel surfacing, 415 miles of grading and 115 bridges of over 20-foet span. The forest road construc- tion reported by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads is 154 miles of sur- facing and 142 miles of grading for the same period, which is in addi- tion to the state figures. The total amount expended in the biennium, excluding market roads, is $21,117,597.30, of which state funds total $14,269,970.83, county $3,785,- 883.89, railroad $223,876.84, and Federal Aid $2,837,866.24. Of state funds, the sum of $4,083,099.64 has been used for the payment of prin- cipal and interest on the bonded indebtedness. Included in the above state funds there is $1,092,660.31 of state funds expended for forest roads to which should be added $725,942.05 of county cooperation and government forest funds of $1,725,176.76, making a total forest road expenditure of $3,543,779.12 on state highways. The outstanding features of the work accomplished during the bien- nium are briefly noted. On the Pacific Highway, between Oregon City and Canemah, a new location, eliminating a railroad grade crossing and a dangerous, narrow plank roadway along the river, has been graded and graveled. At Pudding River, a new reinforced concrete and steel bridge, replacing an old light structure, has been constructed. The concrete paving south of Halsey has been completed, and a standard steel bridge to supplant the inadequate ferry service has been commenced at Harrisburg. The pavement between Eugene and Goshen has been thickened and widened. The one-half mile north of Cottage Grove has been graded and paved. Spanning the North Fork of the Umpqua River near Winchester, a few miles north of Rose- burg, a reinforced concrete bridge consisting of seven 112-foot arch spans, which has been named in honor of the former chairman of the Commis- sion, the Robert A. Booth Bridge, in appreciation of the splendid service which he has rendered the State. In October, 1923, following the opening of new paved sections on the Pacific Highway in Washington, the Pacific Highway in the two states was officially dedicated with appropriate exercises at Olympia and Salem. Supplementing the Pacific Highway is the West Side Pacific High- way, which was opened for through traffic in October of the present year, which was made possible by the completion of the Holmes Gap- Rickreall paving contract in 1923 and the Monmouth South contract in 1924, which had been the subject of litigation in Polk County, and had — delayed the completion of this highway. The most important improve- ment in the Willamette Valley, however, has been the completion of the Albany-Corvallis pavement, and the beginning of the new bridge across the Willamette River at Albany, both of which have been urgently needed.

On the upper highway, grade widening and resurfacing has improved the section between The Dalles and Umatilla. The new bridge across the Umatilla River has been com- menced. Between Umatilla and Pendleton, on the Old Oregon Trail, grade widening and resurfacing has improved conditions. The last sec- tion, located at the summit of the Blue Mountains, was dedicated by President Harding on July 3, 1923, scarcely a month before his death. The new bridge across the Snake River at Ontario has just been opened to traffic. With the completion of the Minam Hill Section, the La Grande- Wiallowa Lake Highway has been graded and rock surfaced in its entirety, thus opening Wallowa Lake by an improved highway. Similarly, the completion of the Cascade Gorge Section of the Crater Lake Highway now completes an improved highway from Medford through the Crater Lake National Park to Fort Klamath. Progress on The Dalles-California Highway has been rapid, made possible largely by generous cooperation in Wasco County, where the grading has been completed throughout and the entire unsurfaced section placed under contract for surfacing in 1925. South of Bend, continuing to the Klamath County line, grading has been completed or is under con- tract, while in Klamath County grading and surfacing have been com- pleted from Klamath Falls to a point six miles north of Sand Creek, with a 17-mile section adjoining on the north under contract for grading and surfacing. The Sherman Highway, in Sherman County, and its connec- ’ tion in Wasco County, completed in the present year, gives a through all-year connection over an improved highway from Bend to the Columbia River, except for a six-mile gap at Crooked River. The opening of the John Day Highway by completing the gap between Olex and Gwendolen, north of Condon, and surfacing between Spray and the North Fork, has made possible all-year travel into the John Day Valley, with resulting saving to the residents of that region in decreased : hauling costs on wheat, wool, etc. The extension of the forest project from Prairie City through Austin to Unity, all of which has-been graded and part surfaced, will be the means of opening this entire highway to through travel from Ontario, via the wonderful Picture Gorge and fossil beds, to Arlington, as an alternate route to the Old Oregon Trail. Beginning at Astoria and going south, new improvements will be found on the Roosevelt Highway. The new Lewis and Clark bridge, | replacing an old structure of light construction, will soon be open for travel. Three miles of new grade and surface between Seaside and Cannon Beach Junction and the improved section between the Tillamook County line and Mohler is.noted in the program for the biennium. Between Jetty Creek and Brighton, construction of a three-quarter-mile section has just been completed, which removes a barrier on the coast route in Tillamook County. South of Tillamook, between Hebo and Siletz Bay, is continuous improvement, opening up a hitherto undeveloped section. North of Newport grading is under contract between Agate Beach and Rocky’ Creek, an eight-mile section, which will be followed by surfacing. In southwestern Lincoln and western Lane and Douglas Counties, there has been no improvement on the Roosevelt Highway. Beginning at the Coos County line, a forest grading contract is in progress to Hauser. From Hauser to the north shore of Coos Bay is a completed graded and OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION et a surfaced roadbed. South of Marshfield, the completed Coquille-Bandon section makes possible all-year travel from Northern Curry County over improved highways. South of Arizona Inn to Mussel Creek, grading is in progress, while south of Gold Beach there is-now continuous improvement from Hunters Creek to Myers Creek. There is a vast amount of work yet to do on this highway. Surveys, however, have been practically com- pleted over its entire length. Last season was the first winter that all-year travel passed over the Coos Bay-Roseburg Highway and the Corvallis-Newport Highway, which has marked a new era in transpor- tation to these coast communities. The McKenzie Highway is now completely graded through the national forest between Blue River and Sisters, and only 12 miles yet remain to rock surface. Travel from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon will be greatly ‘expedited by this route. Mention should also be made that the Mt. Hood Loop, after several years of construction, has now been com- pleted from the Multnomah County line, near Sandy, circling Mt. Hood and north to Hood River City, and next year will be open to travel. The name Redwood Highway has been given to the former Grants Pass-Crescent City Highway, in order to have the same designation in Oregon that it has in California, and thus avoid confusion. During the biennium, new bridges have been constructed over the Applegate and the East Fork of the Illinois River, and the new connection to the Cali- fornia state line via Elk Creek has been graded and bridged. Extensive progress has been made on the California side, and with the removal of the Oregon Mountain barrier, this road will become an important inter- state connection. The road to Oregon Caves, branching off near Kerby, has been improved and is carrying increasing traffic each year. On the Prineville-Lakeview Highway, eight miles of grading along the west shore of Summer Lake has been completed, and Paisley and Lakeview are now joined with a standard graded and surfaced road, while between Klamath Falls and Lakeview, the Drews Valley Sec- tion, in Lake County, and the Dairy-Bonanza Section, in Klamath County, have reduced the unimproved mileage between the two county seats. A substantial improvement on the Baker-Unity Highway has been made by regrading the road over Dooly Mountain, in Baker County. These and many other improvements, which are not men- tioned, will be found described in detail and shown in the progress maps in the State Highway Engineer’s report, which follows. The personnel of the Commission has been changed because of the resignation of the former commissioners. Wm. Duby of Baker succeeded W. B. Barratt on March 27, 1923, H. B. Van Duzer of Portland succeeded J. B. Yeon on April 1, 1923, and W. H. Malone of Corvallis succeeded R. A. Booth on May 28, 1923. Wm. Duby was elected chairman of the Commission on May 28, 1923. Herbert Nunn resigned as State Highway Engineer, effective April 1, 1923. Roy A. Klein, Assistant State Highway Engineer, was appointed State Highway Engineer, which was later confirmed on June 26, 19238, by the present Commission. Mr. Klein also serves as secretary to the Com- mission. The Commission has held 35 meetings in the two-year period, occupy- ing 62 days. In addition, the members of the Commission, individually, a SIXTH BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE have traveled about the state extensively in the interest of highway matters, and have given a considerable part of their time at home to the details of the work. The County Commissioners of Multnomah County have generously granted the use of a suitable room in the Multnomah County courthouse, Portland, for the meetings of the Commission, which has proved a great convenience to bidders, representatives of the counties and communities and others who have had business to transact with the Commission. In the two-year period, 895 bids have been received on state projects and 35 bids on projects advertised for the counties. A total of 144 state contracts and six county contracts have been awarded. Competition has been keen, but in a few instances it has been found necessary to readver- tise the projects, with the result that lower bids were secured. Practically all work has been done by contract, except that on a few resurfacing jobs it has been found advantageous to do the hauling and processing with state equipment, the contract being limited to the fu rnish- ing of materials at the bunkers. Generally speaking, industrial conditions during the biennium have been good, with the result that work has been handled expeditiously and with a fair margin of profit. In the first year of the period, 1923, a short- age of labor was experienced which retarded progress to some extent, but the present year, 1924, has witnessed a return to more normal condi- tions, with ample labor, material, equipment and supplies obtainable at _short notice. As a consequence, jobs which had been carried over from the previous year were quickly finished, and new projects were rapidly carried through to completion. It is believed that the 20-mile section on the Sherman Highway from Wasco County line through Shaniko to the head of Cow Canyon establishes a record, in that both grading and sur- facing of the entire unit were completed in the remarkably short time of eight months. As a result of favorable conditions during 1924, there are fewer projects being carried over than in any other previous year. While there have been a very few instances in which contractors have become financially embarrassed, and it has been necessary for the ' surety company to step in and finish up the jobs, yet the percentage has been very low, considering the amount of work under construction; in fact, lower than in other years, which speaks well for the ease of contractors engaged in state highway construction. The state financial program has been greatly assisted by redebal Aid allotments, which began in 1917, at first as an aid to the construction of post roads, but later broadened to include a system of intrastate and inter- state roads adopted by joint action of the state and government in 1922. - This system approximates 7 per cent of the mileage of the public roads ‘ within the state, or 2,784 miles. Federal Aid funds may be spent sisal on this system. Originally the Federal law provided for 50 per cent baperasiin by the states, but a later change gave an advantage to the states having large areas of public lands by providing that the cooperation could be reduced in proportion. Under this amendment, Oregon is required to cooperate 39 per cent. There is a limiting factor, however, as to the maximum Federal Aid expenditure per mile, excluding bridges of over 20-foot span, which applied to Oregon gives a maximum allotment per. mile of $18, 341 of federal funds. ao STIV4 HLVAVIM JO HLYUON SHIIN LHDIG LAOGTV LNIOd V NOU AYVI HLVWVIM GNV AVMHDIH VINUOMITVO-SSTIVG BHL OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 13 Supplementing the Federal Aid Act, appropriations are made by the Federal Government for the construction of roads within, partly within or adjacent to the National Forests. This appropriation is divided into two parts, one for forest highway work which is applicable to state highways or important county and community roads, and the second to roads and trails for forest development. Under the law, the state, Bureau of Public Roads and Forest Service are required to agree on a system of forest highways. This has been prepared, and the major details tentatively agreed upon but not in entirety. The principal projects completed or in course of construction under cooperative agreements are the Mt. Hood Loop from the west forest boundary to the north forest boundary, the McKenzie Highway from Blue River to Sisters, the Crater Lake Highway from Trail to Ft. Klamath, excluding the section within the Park boundaries and a section between McLeod and Cascade Gorge, the John Day Highway between Prairie City and Unity, and the Coast Highway between Neskowin and Siletz Bay in Tillamook and Lincoln Counties, between Hauser and Lakeside in Coos County and between Brush Creek and Euchre Creek in Curry County. There should also be included, the Alsea Highway between Waldport and the Benton County line, the Ochoco Highway through the Ochoco Forest east of Prineville, The Dalles-California Highway between Ft. Klamath and Crescent, and other important projects. The Commission appreciates the cordial cooperation between the local representatives of the Bureau of Public Roads and the Forest Service in carrying out a successful forest road program which has been an immense aid in advancing the state high- way program.

Briefly mentioned, attention is directed to the Canemah crossing on the Pacific Highway in Clackamas County, the Oro Dell and Perry crossings on the Old Oregon Trail in Union County, and the Blodgett crossing on the Corvallis-Newport Highway in Benton County. OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 15 Also grade crossings have been eliminated by relocation on one side of the track avoiding a double grade crossing such as in Coos County on the Coos Bay-Roseburg Highway north of Myrtle Point. Traffic counts are made at monthly intervals during the summer months to secure definite statistics as to the number of vehicles using the roads. The stations are selected with a view to securing representa- tive averages rather than large counts. At some points, however, higher than 8,000 vehicles per day have been counted. Indicative of the increase in traffic are the counts made at points on the main traveled highways not influenced by local travel at approx- imately the same date in the month of July in each of the past four years. Significant also is the number and the increase in nonresident vehicles, 1924 1922 1923 1924 ee ee eS = Pacific Highway near Wolf Creek: ML Oy 8 WERE LG Hy a lye es cp ara oh a a ge Lae 151 268 583 678 OTERO ee re ete PIRI EARN EEL SAS eee oe 168 160 240 337 EIS) GGL) Speier ne eae We ee O eee Pee IY Ps ea 319 428 823 1,015 Old Oregon Trail, Nolin (north of Pendleton) : : INOTT REST ENE fo io To hencose-op bodes np aevasictere onus baieeseae eee 63 139 275 344 OLrELOM Mee Se eke ILO lili ge RAR AS URES SR CMe LS el SS 139 169 231 288 Binten aie ee een teak AO NeVicen, |)” ore ae eee 202 308 506 632 Old Oregon Trail, Meacham: IN OUTPOST CLL Ere ee tees ee te ere seen eA wy Fe 38 | 87 104 ee V203 OES Or ee Ae ee PIES ORE ee Pe PEEVE PELE NEAR LC eM | rch 98 86 70 320 TR OUI Me eis eee en ae tle Te NUL fa neon RO! 136 173 174 593 The average percentage of each class of traffic as indicated by traffic counts taken in months of June, July, August, September and October in years of 1923 and 1924 at approximately 200 representa- tive points scattered over the State is as follows: PEN O IESG TEU WT Tee eee a AR ee eee Lsst MEOtOreyele mei fee en see) cian ee ae 0.715 Orevon passenger: automobiles, _4 x... 2-2 222-.,--+22-<tenqe-sesenerannes 69.425 Nonresident passenger automobiles ................2.--------s2--+00+ 20.844 TT IGIKS 21 REO TSE LIA Cee UII LOY eee cet es ken tel rect lade cea 4.142 PIT OL SEO Vi GTe Un wil CT) Ol penn clemes.

It is hoped that property owners in greater numbers will refuse: to sell advertising rights and thus permit the disfigurement of the land- scape. Travelers prefer natural scenery to miscellaneous reading mat- ter. Since the value of outdoor advertising of this nature derives its value from the travel on the highway, it would not be unfair to tax such billboard space for the benefit of the road fund. Distance and direction signs have been placed to plainly mark the state highways, and frequent caution signs at schools, cross roads, curves, railroad crossings, etc., have been erected to make travel safer. Informa- tive signs, such as bievations of mountain summits, historical points, etc., have also been: placed. 16 ‘SIXTH BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Concrete mile posts indicating the distance from Broadway and Wash- ington streets, Portland, have been set on the entire length of the Pacific and West Side Pacific Highways, also. the Upper and Lower Columbia River Highways and Old Oregon Trail: through to Ontario. These mile posts, having been accurately set, become: an interesting and informative guide to tourists as well as affording valuable aid in designating mainte- _ nance operations, etc. Supplementing the mile posts, each bridge, culvert or other structure has been measured in and indicated on the department records with the proper decimal of the mile in which it is located. This permits the immediate location of all bridges and structures. Center lines of pavements on curves have been painted as a safety measure, and the results have more than justified the expense. The Commission is pleased to report progress in the matter of ras planting along the routes of state highways. In several instances civic 2ssociations have planted trees on the state highways near their respective communities, and it is hoped that this practice will be continued. Some tree planting has, been done by state forces in Eastern Oregon, partic- ularly. along the Columbia River. The Commission takes pleasure in announcing the acceptance of appointment on an Advisory Committee on Tree Planting by Jesse A. Currey of Portland, Prof. A. R. Sweetser of the U. of O., Eugene, and Profs. A. L. Peck and G. R. Hyslop of O. A. C., Corvallis. The State is fortunate in securing the services of these men who are authorities on this subject. Efforts to preserve standing timber along the routes of state high- ways have been successful in a limited way. Cooperative arrangements with Deschutes County and the Shevlin-Hixon Company, will result in saving a: stand of pine timber along The Dalles-California Highway in Deschutes County south of Lava Butte. It is hoped that federal legisla- tion may be enacted in the near future which will make possible the exchange of timbered areas along the highway for equivalent stumpage in the national forests. Especially desirable is such a program along the Ashland-Klamath Falls, Ochoco, The Dalles-California, McKenzie, Willamette, Crater Lake and Coast Highways. An urgent need at the present time is the securing of a timbered strip along the Old Oregon Trail over the summit of the Blue Mountains which is rapidly being cut off for the firewood. The Commission is now authorized to purchase or condemn property for park purposes a distance of 300 feet on each side of the roadway which has been done in. a few instances, principally in timbered areas. It has been found that in several places where splendid parks were available, the springs which would furnish the water supply were located more than 300 feet away so that the necessary water could not be secured or protected by the purchase of sufficient area to prevent contamination. Also, in many cases some natural beauty spot which it would be desirable to acquire is located at a greater distance than the prescribed limit. Therefore, it is recommended that the limit be removed from the present law. At Clatsop Crest on the Lower Columbia River Highway in Clatsop County, a twenty-acre park site donated by the heirs of the Bradley Estate has been improved by leveling up the grounds, installation of a water supply and sewage system and the building of a comfort station, also a THE JOHN DAY HIGHWAY IN GRANT COUNTY ON we ie at ee OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 17 ‘building for living quarters and store. The privileges were given for a | ‘two-year period to the highest bidder, whose duty it is to clean up the park grounds and keep the buildings in sanitary condition. ) Helmick Park a five and one-half-acre timbered area, on the south bank of the Luckiamute River on the West Side Pacific Highway in Polk County, the gift of Sarah Helmick, was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on September 12, 1924, coincident with the opening of the West Side Pacific Highway. On the Columbia’ River Highway between Mosier and The Dalles, ‘Mayer Park, a tract of 260 acres, has been generously donated to the State by Mark A. Mayer of Portland. The westerly portion of the tract includes the Rowena Heights, a precipitous point rising to an elevation of about 600 feet above the water, from which a splendid view up and down the river can be had, rivalling Crown Point in Multnomah County. This viewpoint is being improved by a roadway circling the rim and protected with a masonry parapet wall. Later it is hoped that sanitary conve- niences may be provided by the civic organizations of the nearby cities or interested public spirited citizens. A considerable portion of the park lies on the east slope extending toward Rowena through which the high- way loops in its descent. This area is covered with a growth of oaks which make convenient resting and camping places during the summer season. By means of condemnation, a timbered tract at Emigrant Springs, ‘the site of the Old Oregon Trail dedication by President Harding, has ‘been secured at a cost of $3,000. It is planned to improve the spring with a drinking fountain and to develop park facilities. It is hoped that further donations of park sites to the public along state highway routes may be made by generous public spirited citi- zens to preserve the natural scenic beauties and provide free resting places for the traveler. Drinking fountains have been constructed at several places along the highways which is a convenience much appreciated by tourists. Acting upon authority conferred upon it by the legislature, the Com- mission has located state highways through cities and towns so as to elim- inate right angle corners in so far as possible and also avoid congested business streets and the hazard of street car traffic. This is the fifth year since the Market Road Fund has been available, and in that period a sum in excess of $10,000,000, including both state and county funds, has been expended under this statute. With this. expendi- ture, a large mileage of important market roads has been improved with grading, rock or gravel surfacing and pavement; also, many new bridges have been constructed. During this period Multnomah County has contributed the sum of more than one and one-quarter million dollars to the fund which has -been divided among the other counties, by reason of the provision of the law which prohibits any county from receiving more than 10 per cent of the fund while Multnomah County pays into the fund approximately one- | third of the total. The present law provides that the market road projects shall be selected by the County Court but that the plans and specifications shall be approved by the State Highway Commission. Most of the counties have selected meritorious projects leading from producing points to market centers and are securing excellent results.

In other coun- ties, however, the funds have been spread over very many projects with the result that no definite permanent improvement has been secured; in fact, there are cases where the funds have been largely dissipated if considered in the light of the original intention of the act. The matter of approval of the plans and specifications by the Commis- sion is not conclusive. Both may be prepared according to the best approved practice, but there is nothing compulsory in the law to require adherence to them on the part of the county, and the road itself may be constructed without regard for plans or specifications. Under the present law, the payment of the state share is predicated on a showing that the levy to match state funds has been made and after plans and specifications have been approved by the engineer, but the actual expenditures by the county are uncertain and difficult to check, particularly where done by county employes on a day labor basis. | The matter of maintenance of market roads is, in many instances, being neglected. After once being constructed from market road funds, there should be an obligation upon the county to maintain them. It is thought that the law should be amended to permit a part of the fund to be used for that purpose. In brief, the Commission recommends that the Market Road Law be amended to provide that a definite system of market roads in each county be approved, and that expenditures from the fund be made only upon that system in a consecutive manner, to the end that the best inter- ests of the entire county may be served. Also that the State Highway Commission, or its engineer, should have authority to inspect and chal- lenge the work during progress and at completion, in order to insure compliance with plans and specifications as well as formal approval of the plans before work is commenced, and the payment of market road funds to the counties be thus conditioned upon proper construction according to approved design and location. The Commission’s interest in the whole market road matter is to assist the counties to secure the best construction in the proper location and give the counties the benefit of the larger experience of its engineers. It is not its intention to encroach upon or assume the duties of the county officer on whom is the responsibility for the county road program, - but in any event, in the judgment of the legislature, whether the Commis- sion’s authority should be increased or curtailed, more definite responsi- bility for the expenditure of this fund should be fixed and not continued divided as at present. It has been suggested by several of the counties that the market road fund be made available for use on state highways, which is not possible at present because of a Supreme Court decision which prohibits its use for this purpose. The application of market road funds as a part of county cooperation on state highway construction would be found very convenient in some counties where other funds are very limited and where state highways are also important market roads, the improvement of which has been held up because of lack of funds. Paving operations during the period have been considerably less than in former years, a total of 37 miles of new paving having been laid. The two paving projects, Holmes Gap-Rickreall and Monmouth South, were both constructed of cement concrete laid seven inches thick and 16 feet wide with extra width on curves and with gravel shoulders. On the WALLOWA LAKE AND A PART OF THE LA GRANDE-WALLOWA LAKE HIGHWAY OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 21 Albany-Corvallis paving, a design having a width of 18 feet and a thick- ness of seven inches over the center 14 feet, tapering to 10 inches at the edges, was adopted, which design gives a pavement of very high strength. A new feature in resurfacing work, which has caused much favorable comment, is the new pavement between Eugene and Goshen; originally a 16-foot 2-inch bituminous pavement on compacted stone base. Traffic requirements made thickening and widening imperative. Two-foot cement concrete shoulders, seven inches thick, were added to each side, and approximately 314 inches of bituminous material added to thicken the center section, giving a 20-foot width and not less than five inches of thickness. The Commission appreciates the necessity of keeping all highways up to a high standard, and for that reason extensive and continuous main- tenance is necessary. On pavements, cracks must be filled, depressions restored, breaks repaired, shoulders rebuilt, etc. On macadam roads, dragging must be done at the proper time to maintain a smooth riding surface. In addition, ditches and culverts must be kept open, slides removed, weeds cut, papers and litter picked up, guard fences repaired and repainted, bolts in bridges tightened, timber bridges renewed, steel bridges repainted, channels cleared, etc. Snow removal on main highways has become an important feature of the maintenance work in order to secure the maximum use of the road and avoid delays to travel. The Pacific Highway over the Siskiyou Mountains has been kept open for four successive seasons, and the Old Oregon Trail cver the Blue Mountains between Pendleton and La Grande was kept open last year for the first time as well as many other main roads. To efficiently handle heavy falls of snow, snow ploys and tractors supplemented by blades mounted on trucks and blade grading machines ‘are stationed at strategic points about the state. Also, the construction of snow fences in locations where excessive drifting occurs has been found necessary. It is confidently expected that with this preparation and equipment the main highways can be kept open throughout the entire year at a reasonable expense. Since April 1, 1921, the state has taken over the maintenance of all finished sections of the state highway at its entire expense without help from the counties, although not specifically required to pay the entire costs under legislation on this subject. Under this policy in the previous biennium there was expended the sum of $1,052,268.31 and in the present biennium the sum of $2,688,021.82. The rapid gain in the registration of motor vehicles in the State, increasing from 48,632 in 1917 to approximately 193,000 in 1924, together with the great increase in tourist traffic, has added to the maintenance problem in the same proportion. Road surfaces which have carried light traffic well, rapidly disintegrate and wear out under the greatly increased traffic burden put upon them. The heavy use of the roads has demonstrated that 2-inch bituminous pavements are not adequate, and many of these pavements laid several years ago must soon be thickened and widened to meet increasing demands of traffic. Six-inch cement concrete pavements are also found inadequate, and the present standard is seven inches thick in the center with thickened edges. Quarters for patrolmen have been constructed north of Ontario on Snake River and also at Siskiyou on the Pacific Highway in Jackson County, so as to provide living quarters for men at strategic points where there are no other accommodations. 22 SIXTH BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE To facilitate paving repairs and also handle small projects the Com- mission purchased, in 19238, a portable bituminous paving plant, turning in as part payment a stationary plant purchased some years before. Dur- ing the first season the plant made repairs on the Multnomah County Line-Hood River Section and also widened the pavement to correspond with the widened roadbed. In 1924 the same plant covered the Pacific Highway between Myrtle Creek and Oregon City as well as a few miles on the West Side Pacific Highway, repairing pavement and widening curves. It was also used to pave the uncompleted gaps at Myrtle Creek, McVeigh Overhead and Pudding River. A second portable plant, similar in design, was purchased and delivered late in 1924, which operated on the Lower Columbia River Highway and the Tualatin Valley Highway. The very heavy traffic on the Upper Columbia River Highway and Old Oregon Trail made necessary the resurfacing and widening of this unit between The Dalles and Pendleton. On account of the sandy subsoil and extremely dry conditions on this section, a clay binder was added to the new material which results in a more compacted surface, less dust and more resistance to the formation of corrugations. Clay binder has also been added on The Dalles-California Highway in Deschutes County and also on the Prineville-Redmond Section which has remedied former conditions. Oiling has been done on some heavily traveled sections which has eliminated the dust nuisance and prevented a loss of binder and filler materials. The larger sections so treated were the Columbia River High- way east of The Dalles, through Wasco and Sherman Counties, and the Mt. Hood Loop in Clackamas County. The most important bridges constructed during the biennium were the Pudding River structure at Aurora, the R. A. Booth bridge at Winchester, the Lewis and Clark River bridge near Astoria, the Snake River bridge at Ontario and the Winchuck River bridge in Curry County, with numerous smaller structures of adequate strength and pleasing design. Mention should also be made of the Umatilla River bridge at Umatilla and the Willamette River bridges at Albany and Harrisburg which have been commenced in the present biennium. The distribution of surplus war materials begun in 1919 has been practically completed, and very little equipment has been distributed recently. The government allotment of trucks and tractors has formed the nucleus of the Department’s maintenance equipment, particular use being made of the lighter trucks and smaller tractors for dragging searifiers and blades. The tractors are especially advantageous in snow removal and in processing operations on resurface projects. Many trucks have been equipped with water tanks especially needed in surfacing opera- tions. Other trucks have been equipped with dump bodies and have been used for hauling materials. Many trucks have been allotted to the counties for their use at approximately cost. Some equipment has been rented to contractors on both department and other work, and there has been a substantial return from this source. It is the policy of the Com- mission to convert this surplus war equipment into equivalent road value. The use of state equipment is properly charged against each project on a rental basis, so that by the time the equipment is worn out the cost will have been liquidated and each project will have been charged its proportionate amount. OREGON STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION 23 The main shops for the repair and maintenance of business cars, trucks, tractors, graders and other types of road building equipment are located at Salem, with branch shops at La Grande and Klamath Falls. A new brick building has been erected on the grounds at Salem to house a heating plant, wash room, locker room and provide gasoline filling and greasing facilities. The new building, by separation from the rest of the frame buildings, will reduce the fire hazard. The Equipment Department, in addition to paying for all new equipment, turned back into the state highway fund a substantial sum at the close of the biennium which is applied to the reduction of the equipment capital account. Fire insurance in limited amount is carried on business cars and trucks and also on parts and supplies in the shops. Under a ruling of the Attorney-General, there seems to be no provision of the law which author- izes insurance on buildings. Since the Commission owns some buildings in various parts of the state, it would seem to be good business practice to carry fire insurance on these, and legislation on this point is rec- ommended. The Commission has exercised its control over state highways as authorized by law, and franchise for water pipe lines, gas mains, sewers and telephone, telegraph and power lines are given only after satisfactory arrangements have been made as to the proper placing of poles or pipe lines so as not to interfere with highway widening, etc., in the future. One requirement insisted upon is that new wire lines take care of the existing lines by relocation to avoid crossing and recrossing the high- way and the use of common user poles where possible. Log hauling is permitted on state highways only by special permit, and the Commission grants these permits only after investigation of the route proposed to be hauled over and the posting of a bond to guarantee faithful compliance with the terms of the permit and a bond to make good any damage in excess of ordinary wear. in The protection of the roads against overloading and speeding is a matter which requires constant vigilance. The Commission employs six: traffic officers who work under the direction of the Chief Inspector of the Motor Vehicle Division of the Secretary of State who employs an equal number. This arrangement is made so that the work of the two departments will coordinate and harmonize and avoid duplication of effort. Many of the Commission’s regular employes working in various parts of the state are deputized to enforce the traffic laws. These men do not receive extra compensation for this work. Since the preparation and publication of the last biennial report, the case of Warren Brothers Company vs. Huber, which is a case involving the validity of the Warren patent, and in connection with which a claim was made for royalty for pavements laid for the State of Oregon by Oskar Huber, the appeal from the decision of the Federal Court has been per- fected, and the cause was argued October 15, 1924, before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The matter has not been disposed of as yet by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but a decision is expected soon. It is the contention of the Attorney-General’s office that a decision in the Huber case is not controlling with respect to similar pavements laid by other contractors. The total yardage involved in the Huber case is 74,542 square yards, for which the Federal Court in its decision allowed 25 cents per square yard as royalty. From this decision an appeal was taken to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. 24 SIXTH BIENNIAL: REPORT OF THE. The Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, has not urged. its alleged.claim for royalty resulting from what the Company claims is an infringement of its patent in connection with the construction of lift spans. employed in the Young’s Bay bridge near Astoria. . Litigation in connection with this alleged infringement. has been threatened, but as yet. nothing definite has been done. This matter has been placed by the Highway Commission with the Attorney-General. Betterments on the main traveled roads are becoming an urgent neces- sity because of the great, increase in traffic. In order to meet the emer- gency, roadbeds should be widened.now so as to give plenty of time for settlement. Also many changes should be made to straighten alignment and reduce curvature in keeping with higher standards of construction. Widening and straightening such as above described has already been. completed between Hood River and Cascade Locks and,on the’ Lower Columbia River Highway between. Svensen and Astoria. Lt 1s) also apparent that with the increase in, traffic, pavements will have to be. widened also, so adequate financial provision should be made to meet these | conditions. The Commission serine Pecumarante that no: new roads be added to the state highway map until the present system is completed. It is believed. that the present system, which represents approximately ten per cent of the public road mileage, is adequate to cover the needs of the state. An interesting comparison is made with the state highway mile- age of the two adjoining states, Washington and California. In Wash- ington, with greater population and wealth and approximately 100,000 more motor vehicle registrations, the state highway mileage is approxi- mately 75 per cent of. that of Oregon, while in California, with approxi-_ mately 1,000,000. more registrations than Onez On the state highway system is only 46 per cent greater. The report of the Engineer follows which gives in detail the various projects undertaken during the year. It, will be noted that the program is well advanced, but that there are still many important gaps to be filled and extensions and connections made to roads which form important links in the state highway system, to properly serve all sections of the state. The actual accomplishment of work during the biennium has been somewhat less than during the previous period because of lesser available funds. However, the work has been very gratifying to the Commission for the reason that in many cases the work which has been done will affect the coupling up of many completed sections of finished highways which heretofore have not been available for full service by reason of the uncompleted sections adjacent. In other cases, extensions and con- nections have been constructed opening up large sections of producing country or making possible connections with adjoining states. All of these improvements bring closer to completion the comprehensive system of state highways toward which the supporters of. the highway program have been working since the initial steps were taken in 1917. As one highway after another has been opened up, the realization has come to all that the immense sums invested in the state highway system are coming back in dividends of increased business, better markets, higher property values, more pleasant travel, decreased motor vehicle operating costs and all the other benefits that go hand in hand with good roads and econom- ical transportation.

The market road tax is not added to the income statement, neither is it shown in the dis- bursements. The amount of federal aid for future years is wholly dependent on Congressional appropriation. The amount of county coop- eration is wholly an estimate, the point having been reached where many of the counties have reached their legal bonded indebtedness limit.
