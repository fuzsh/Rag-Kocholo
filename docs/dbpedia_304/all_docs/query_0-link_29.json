If it was me buying I would want to know the original owner and the complete history of that MX8 or any other expensive high end shotgun before buying.\n\nFor all you guy's recommending a used Perazzi to this poster I would like you to consider something.\n\nI totally agree all things being equal the Perazzi MX8 is the superior shotgun by far.\n\nBut you are recommending a used competition shotgun with a lot of unknowns.\n\nFor instance it is my observation that some competitive shooters like to \"tune\" their gun's mechanical's thinking this will help them be better.\n\nI have seen once or twice one of these used guns getting bought by a trusting buyer.\n\nI have witnessed doubling issues from trigger work done by an unknown gunsmith.\n\nI have read of barrel work done to these guns but why someone would know better than Perazzi how these barrels should perform I cannot understand.\n\nAm I being overly concerned here? If it was me buying I would want to know the original owner and the complete history of that MX8 or any other expensive high end shotgun before buying.\n\nWell, yea. But, we all know there a more than a few REALLY GOOD gunsmiths that work on Perazzi guns and can fix almost anything (Except barrels some knuckle head decided needed to be \"improved\" by back boring or drilling holes in or some such nonsense.)\n\nI personally live close enough to Lucio Sosta that I would never let anyone but him touch my guns. (And of course, it is easy enough to send him a gun or part of one and it is probably 3/4 of his work.)But all you have to do is ask for a good Perazzi mechanic on this web site and you will get many who can help.\n\nAttachments\n\n319 KB Views: 163\n\nWell if you think that by spending 3 times the money to get a better mousetrap will make you a shoot better. fill your boots.\n\nYou force me to respond.\n\nPerazzi has been used by more clay sports shooters to win major championships than ALL other guns combined world wide and in the US since about 1980. That is, Olympics, World Cups, ATA events (Grand American events, Zone shoots, State shoots etc.), Skeet championships both international and American, Sporting Clays and the unrecorded pigeon shoots. Perazzis have been and are shot by more ATA All Americans than all other guns combined. (Ever hear of a guy named Dan Bonillas?)\n\nHere is a list of Olympian Champions since 1996:\n\n1996 Atlanta\n\nKim Rhode USA. Double Trap Ladies. Gold. Model MX12.\n\nMichael Diamond AUS. Olympic Trap. Gold. Model MX8.\n\nJosh Lakatos USA. Olympic Trap. Silver. Model MX10.\n\nLance Bade USA. Olympic Trap. Bronze. Model MX8.\n\n2000 Sydney\n\nMichael Diamond AUS. Olympic Trap. Gold.

Model MX8.\n\nLook up the champions in the shotgun sport of your choice. Perazzi absolutely dominates.\n\nOh, and as for me, I am an old trapshooter who also likes to shoot lots of other clay sports. I got to AA27AA on the back of my Perazzi and yes, I sure as hell do think it \"makes me shoot better.\"\n\nWanna list the Beretta achievements during the same time?\n\n(By the way, what does \"fill your boots\" mean?)"
