Hungarian Diána Igaly had won the 1998 and 2002 World Championships. At Sydney in 2000 she had won a bronze medal in this event and entered the 2004 Olympics as the favorite. After the qualifying round she led the defending champion, Azerbaijani Zemfira Meftəkhətddinova, by only one bird. But she went clear with 25 of 25 in the final to win the gold medal by four points. Meftəkhətddinova tied at 93 with China’s Wei Ning but lost the shoot-off and won bronze. The fifth-place finisher, Kim Rhode (USA), was gold medalist in double trap in 1996 and 2004.

The 1948 Olympic ice hockey tournament saw two US entries: one affiliatied with the international Ice Hockey Federation, and one affiliated with the US Olympic Committee. Both were barred from entering, but the former competed anyway, only to be disqualified later.
