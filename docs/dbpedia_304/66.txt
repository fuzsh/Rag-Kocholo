On a very sad day for our shooting sport, the Hungarian Shooting Federation and the whole European shooting sport community are deeply shocked and broken-hearted over the tragic loss of the HSF Vice-President, Olympic champion, multiple world and European gold medalist, Mrs. Diana IGALY who passed away at the age of 56 due to consequences of the corona virus infection.

Mrs. IGALY was a highly successful athlete, won Olympic bronze in Sydney 2000, Olympic champion in Athens 2004 in addition to 4 world and 5 European titles in skeet women event.

Her death represents an irreplaceable loss for our shooting sport as her vast experiences, knowledge, wisdom will be very hard to recover if ever this might be possible.
