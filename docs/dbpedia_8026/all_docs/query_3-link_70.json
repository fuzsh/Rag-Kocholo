Clarke was a British science fiction writer, inventor and futurist who gained fame for his classic science fiction novels. He co-authored the screenplay of the 1968 movie '2001: A Space Odyssey' with the director Stanley Kubrick. Clarke wrote, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' Referring to the DVD in his hand, he said, 'If I were able to give Thomas Edison this disc, he would have no idea of what it was or how it worked. It would be magic.'."
