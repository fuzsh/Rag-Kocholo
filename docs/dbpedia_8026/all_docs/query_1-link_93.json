        "text": "2001: A Space Odyssey is by far the most disturbing movie I have ever watched. So what about the book?\n\nAbout the Book\n\nTitle: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nAuthor: Arthur C. Clarke\n\nSeries: Space Odyssey #1\n\nPublished: 1968\n\nGenre: classic sci-fi\n\nRating: 4/5 stars\n\nThe Premise\n\nSynopsis (from Goodreads):\n\n“On the Moon, an enigma is uncovered.\n\nSo great are the implications of this discovery that for the first time men are sent out deep into our solar system.\n\nBut long before their destination is reached, things begin to go horribly, inexplicably wrong…\n\nOne of the greatest-selling science fiction novels of our time, this classic book will grip you to the very end.“\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nI watched the movie of this in August and it has got to be one of the most unnerving things I have EVER watched. I don’t know what exactly it was– the very little dialogue, the extended sequences of silence, the lack of explanation for anything, the monolith theme song from hell, and of course *this* scene:\n\nbut I was really shaken up after I watched it. I liked the movie but it was inexplicably disturbing to me. Really disturbing. Maybe that’s why I liked it. I was creeped out.\n\nThe book is much less creepy, it goes into more detail about, well, everything and it is actually possible to follow the plot without the help of Google.\n\nConsidering the movie and book were developed at the same time, I was kind of surprised at the amount of differences there were between the two.\n\nThe plot itself is very intriguing, but I don’t want to spoil anything. There are a lot of really interesting themes such as the humanity or inhumanity of AI, humanity’s place in the universe, the progress of evolution… the book ended kind of abruptly but apparently there are several sequels. I will have to read them.\n\nAnd it is so ahead of its time, too. The technology is described in great detail and a lot of it pretty much does exist today.\n\nBut of course, though the book was prescient and all, behold the sentence that reminded me it was written in the 60s:\n\n“[the space pods] were usually christened with feminine names, perhaps in recognition of the fact that their personalities were sometimes slightly unpredictable. Discovery’s were Anna, Betty, and Clara.”\n\nClassic sci-fi will classic sci-fi… moving on…\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThis was a pretty interesting book and one that’s relatively well-known in the classic sci-fi canon, so I’d recommend it to anyone who finds that interesting.\n\nHave you read or watched 2001: A Space Odyssey? If so, what did you think of it?\n\nIf you liked this post, consider subscribing to Frappes & Fiction. I post about the books I read, the books I think YOU should read, and anything else on my mind."
