Clarke\n\nA comic by Luis Paadín\n\nThe Blast\n\nA story by Ramon Mas Baucells\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nArthur C. Clarke\n\nThe skin on my arms is raw. My feet a mass of sores. I walk slower and slower as the inertia wanes. It’s the exhaustion of the last day, the beat prior to the Blast. Those of us who sit down now will turn to dust. I sometimes envy them. To stop. To die. But I’d be incapable of doing a No-Further. I believe in the rhythm, I was taught to carry on.\n\nJust like every three thin moons, the pilgrimage takes the shape of a snake and slips between the ash and the ruins. The first one must already be hearing the Blast. Soon it will be me. I just have to endure the Wait.\n\nThose-Who-Know-How-It-Was explain that the course of time started with the Bang. They say that the world of before was evergreen, that there was no need to hunt or to protect yourself, and that it was called the past. They also say that this could never be like that, except when we’re receiving the Blast. The Blast is our link to what existed before the Bang, when the beat was always there and all around, and rhythms bounded about freely.\n\nFinally, I can see the Rusty Temple and I whoop in silence. In the line, you have to keep the words inside your head. It’s the law. If we turn our thoughts into sounds, they throw us out of the Wait. We mustn’t let the receiver of the Blast perceive any noise interference.\n\nI’m the first in line. Face to face with the sorcerer. He places the silver disc in the palm of his hand, grips it with his fingers and raises it within a hair’s breadth of my face. I can see my reflection – eyes downcast, mouth pulled into a grimace. Now he says the eternal words.\n\n“May the rhythm keep you among the living, may the powerful voice give you strength for the next ninety suns, may you return to me during the third thin moon. Haf fan.”\n\nHe places the disc inside the mechanical mouth and I put on the headband, with the sonic sponges over my ears. He closes the mouth and presses some buttons. The sacred name flashes on the small rectangular screen. Number 2. Always number 2.\n\nHe presses the triangle.\n\nThe Blast penetrates my ears. Three beeps and the rhythm bursts forth. It echoes around the sides of my skull. Sounds with an inexplicable origin spike me with the divine infection. My feet move by themselves. Straight away comes the Mother Voice, the Primordial Impulse, the song that begot the first movement. It reaches right to the depths of my worn body and spreads outwards. A wave of shivers run down my arms and legs. The Mother Voice sings in an unknown language, from before the great Bang, the language used by gods and machines.\n\nI close my eyes and my chest swells. I recharge my batteries, as the old folks would say. The Blast will keep me going for the next ninety suns. Three thin moons. The primordial voice disappears, then returns, then goes, comes back again. I soak up its energy. Dei Just Uona, Dei Just Uonaaaa. I melt into the Primordial Impulse. Dei Just Uona, Dei Justa Uonaaaa. It energises me. It brings me up. It carries me away. Guels Just Uona Haf Fan.\n\nWhen the sounds stop, the sorcerer takes the headband off me. I’m filled with a supernatural force. It’s the rhythm created by the gods, to feed the machines. Now I want to hunt, to copulate, to build. I feel capable of anything. I’m the carrier of the Blast and I have ninety suns ahead of me. Haf Fan.\n\n404\n\nA story by Lucía Lijtmaer\n\nThe fuel on which science runs is ignorance.\n\nMatt Ridley\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Can you tell me what’s happened?\n\n-No, sorry.\n\n-But something’s happened.\n\n-It’s an error. That’s all I know.\n\n-Really?\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Can’t it be fixed?\n\n-As I said, that’s all I know. Something went wrong. Our engineers have been informed.\n\n-The engineers? Since when is this a problem for engineers? And anyway, what engineers are you talking about? Some kind of collective?\n\n-Actually, I think the problem is that you didn’t send the completed request on time.\n\n-The request? What request?!\n\n-We’re very sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused you. Thanks for noticing.\n\n-I don’t get this at all.\n\n-Things will be back to normal soon.\n\n-Do you promise?\n\n-Yes, I promise.\n\n-Thank you. Goodbye.\n\n-Come back again soon. Goodbye.\n\nThe Third Law\n\nA gif by Ferran Esteve\n\nWas Arthur C. Clarke right?\n\nAn exploration of the magical nature of technology\n\nAn interactive piece by Oscar Marín\n\nIn 1962, in his book “Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible”, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated his famous Three Laws, of which the third law is the best-known and most widely cited: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”.\n\nThe visualization below aims to explore this concept, offering a general classification of ‘magical acts’ and a timeline of what could be the evolution of their technological counterparts (you can click on any technology or ‘magical family’ and visit Wikipedia to get an idea of the concept). In this way, to the ‘technological non-initiates’ of the 1400s, a web search would have been seen as a ‘scrying act’ and video streaming a ‘clairvoyant experience’."
