        "text": "It is a while now since I first fell about laughing watching The Goodies send up Arthur C Clarke and his ‘Mysterious World’.\n\nClarke was always one of my favourite writers – sharp, witty, clever and creative. I was not the only one to think so. The fact that Clarke drew the attention of Messrs Garden, Oddie and Brooke-Taylor underscored his status as twentieth century icon. By the 1970s he was a household name across the western world – and was, with Asimov and Heinlein, regarded as one of the ‘big three’ SF authors of the century. Unlike them, he was English. From Somerset, in fact – and retained that rolling –r and z-for-s accent to the end of his life (not quite, “Aaaaar, thaat do be a noice jarrr of apple zoider.”)\n\nA lot of Clarke’s pop-status flowed from his role as author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick’s 1968 SF movie that – partly by chance – struck chords with a generation wanting an ‘ultimate trip’ of a different kind. He had also made a huge name for himself in the emerging space field – starting in the late 1930s when, as a member of the British Interplanetary Society, he got involved in their design for a moon rocket.\n\nMore on Clarke’s science in a later post. Today I’m going to talk about Clarke the writer. In his lifetime – setting aside the travesties that emerged when he franchised his universe towards the end of his life, and yes, I’m talking about those awful Rama sequels – Clarke wrote over 70 books. Mostly science fiction, many of them collected short stories. He penned one novel about his experiences with the RAF. He also wrote science essays, principally futurist rather than explanatory. Not that he lacked the science chops – we are talking here about the man who conceived the ideas for both the communications satellite and the tablet computer.\n\nMany of his stories were exceptionally funny – Tales from the White Hart in particular. Can you use negative feedback and an amplifier to shut up an annoying opera singer? Absolutely. And then have it blow up because the energy has to go somewhere. Can a scientist invent a word-counting machine to prove he has a nagging wife, only to have her foil it with a tape loop? Oh yes…\n\nYet although Clarke wrote the hardest of hard science fiction – solidly grounded in real physics and maths – he infused his work with a spirituality that was lacking in some comparable American works. Think Childhood’s End. The universe was not about the products of physics; it was also, he insisted, about the metaphysical. But that did not mean ignoring science. The fact that he achieved a compelling balance for his readers between the needs of rationality and the need to feed the soul underscored his sheer genius.\n\nHis books and stories were about people. That came out particularly in A Fall of Moondust – where passengers and crew of a moonbus were trapped underneath a dust sea. It was a classic ‘sunken submarine’ tale, focussing wholly on the reactions of the people – the dynamics of strangers thrown together under threat to their lives. It was, of course, brilliant.\n\nHis creativity was second to none; his imagination laid out not one future but many – all entirely believable. His Earth of a thousand years hence didn’t have star travel. But it did have towers rising to geosynchronous orbit, something he explored in The Fountains of Paradise and also his 3001:A Final Odyssey semi-sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The discontinuity between these books also highlights another feature of his writing. He reinvented. His 2001-series books, in particular, offered variations each time – to the annoyance of completists and canonites who insisted it had to be ‘retroactively’ given continuity. In fact it was simply a function of the fact that Clarke was exploring his concepts. The detail of their expression was less crucial than the exploration of new ideas. To me, that was a far more creative way of approaching fiction, for an author, than having to nit-pick back through old ideas to satisfy trainspotters.\n\nThere are key lessons for all writers in this. And more. Clarke was a stylist par excellence. His writing was simple and straight-forward – evocative, capturing the feel without layering up adjectives. He could pitch for any age – witness his ‘kidult’ novel Islands In The Sky. His scenes were inevitably described from character viewpoint. He was also a master of the punch-line twist, a feature that he frequently wove into his stories and novels – take the last line in Imperial Earth, for instance. Or Rendezvous with Rama. He used recurring motifs, notably the ‘last impression’ as a character departed for the last time – used with particular effect in both A Fall of Moondust and Rendezvous with Rama. Later, Clarke played with post-modernist techniques, jumping his narratives and using devices to carry the story forward. Parts of Rendezvous with Rama were narrated by diary and letter. The Hammer of God was almost wholly post-modernist – in part courtesy of its origins as an essay on future society.\n\nTo me, Clarke was inspirational, as a writer, in so many ways. He demonstrated how important it is to write clearly. He showed how vital it is to have the human side – even in non-fiction. And through these things his work taught me an awful lot about how to write.\n\nI’ll post part 2 – Clarke’s science – on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile – what do you think of Clarke the writer? Has his writing inspired you? Do you use any of his techniques?What was your favourite Clarke story or book? Do tell.\n\nCopyright © Matthew Wright 2011"
