        "text": "Is the world over yet? Is it okay if I am disappointed either way? I don't mind being left behind and unchosen as long as I get some answers. I'm used to being picked last and if God turns out to be some giant bully in the sky collecting belief and love like lunch money, I'm fine with that. Honestly if I were God, I wouldn't care if anyone believed in me at all, I'd stomp out the human race as a failed experiment regardless and leave the Earth to the plants and animals. I wouldn't stand for modern culture mucking up my terrarium. I'd ferment all the fruit in the trees and let the monkeys and elephants get wasted! It's not like they have to drive home or anything. If God created drunk caterpillars, willow trees and fish tacos then I certainly do love him but am I really expected to worship an entity who is more passive-aggressive than me? It's difficult.\n\n1991's MICHAEL TOLKIN film THE RAPTURE is simply unforgettable which makes it all the more strange that it is mostly forgotten; I guess asking questions and not saying exactly what people want to hear isn't the best way to be popular-who knew? MIMI ROGERS brings new meaning to the word revelation as Sharon, a woman bored out of her skull by her stupid job who has a bunch of random sex because it's almost like not feeling bored anymore. One day she notices that folks who have found God are even happier than folks who have foursomes that include DAVID DUCHOVNY and so she decides to get born again. God's love has a price though and soon the invisible taskmaster is forcing her to jump through many a hoop. I've watched enough Oprah to identify a toxic relationship when I see one. Face it Sharon, he's just not that into you.\n\nWhen I first saw THE RAPTURE it shook me like a shake weight. No matter what your personal beliefs are it is sure to challenge them. Rather than painting Sharon as a loon waiting for a ship that never comes in, it pushes her smack dab into the middle of the apocalypse, trumpets blaring and all. Yes, the end of the world does arrive as predicted but not before Sharon has lost everything that made the world's destruction worth giving a crap about. I think Sharon's spiritual journey is rather an admirable one. What's infinitely less admirable is the fact that once she has a child, she drags her offspring along for the ride too. She's not a bad person, it's just that her belief system has painted her into a corner where critical thinking is no longer an option. To even question God is an act of treachery. Her faith is strong just not strong enough to withstand a moments scrutiny.\n\nBecause it concerns religion, THE RAPTURE is sure to offend some folks but writer/director TOLKIN is hardly being provocative for the sake of being provocative. The film takes its subject matter seriously and has a sincere curiosity about exactly what the unequivocal existence of God would mean. THE RAPTURE bypasses the usual stalemate of belief vs. non-belief and jumps ahead to the next ladder rung. God exists alright but he has some serious explaining to do. Judgment Day arrives but, in a crazy switch-a-roo, it is God who is judged. It may seem blasphemous to some but if the act of wondering and questioning is a sin then damn me now. I don't know what God you believe in, but mine can handle some constructive criticism without a hissy fit.\n\nYou really do not have to believe in anything to enjoy THE RAPTURE besides good storytelling and the power of film. Somehow its low-budget makeshift end of the world is emotionally devastating on an epic scale. TOLKIN's insistence that the demolition of one spirit be accountable for, coupled with ROGER's undaunted performance is ultimately as moving as any hymn. If THE MIST got you hot under the collar than you might want to take a rain check but if you welcome an investigation into the spiritual without the usual cowardly boundaries I say step forward, there's no reason to linger in limbo."
