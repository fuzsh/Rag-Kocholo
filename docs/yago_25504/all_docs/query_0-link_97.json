        "text": "Spirituality is maybe the last taboo of the modern age. Often questioned in this era of science and logical objectivity, the sway that metaphysical philosophy still has over our society is nonetheless as potent as ever.\n\nCalgary Cinematheque invites you to a provocative selection of visionary, sometimes intense and magical films. Each one showcases a different aspect of world religion to illustrate both a sense of the divine, but also a sense of humanity. A humanity that often creates its entire social structure around what it believes.\n\nSamsara (2023) Directed by Lois Patiño\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nIn the jungles of Laos, an elderly woman named Mon prepares for the end of her years by listening to a Buddhist monk read The Tibetan Book Of The Dead. What follows is a symphonic and cinematic voyage to the Bardo, the transitional realm between life and death. Director Lois Patino utilizes extraordinary, shapeshifting and chimeric visions of the lushness of nature and immersive soundscapes to create a fully captivating and visionary journey to the next life.\n\nThe Rapture (1991) Directed by Michael Tolkin\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nStarring Mimi Rogers in a performance hailed by Marxist film critic Robin Wood as “one of the greatest in the history of Hollywood cinema,” The Rapture is a terrifying and impassioned theistic provocation in an age of post-religiosity. This film will challenge viewers, leaving nonbelievers grappling with dark theological questions and believers questioning the foundations of their faith."
