        "text": "One day, out of the blue, Peter Witner (Peter Weller) decides to live dangerously. Tired of his job at an ad agency, he announces that it's time for a change. \"I welcome what my next step in my journey is going to be, and so I quit,\" he announces serenely at a business meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter's wife, Katherine (Judy Davis), is experiencing her own business difficulties, in response to which she goes shopping. Meeting at home that evening, after an arduous day that Katherine has spent wasting money and Peter has spent in bed with his mistress, they make love stimulated by the fantasy that they are somewhere else. \"It's not real,\" Katherine acknowledges afterward, vaguely troubled. \"I don't think you're really here.\"\n\nSensing that they have indeed reached some kind of precipice, the Witners respond by giving a party, during which one friend delivers some sanguine advice. \"Peter,\" he says, \"when you sail beyond the horizon you fall off the edge of the world. Forget what they taught you in school. The earth is flat.\"\n\n\"The New Age,\" a frequently caustic, ambitious film about going over that edge, is the work of Michael Tolkin, whose corrosive talents have real bite. As the novelist and screenwriter behind \"The Player,\" Mr. Tolkin painted an unforgettably cold-blooded portrait of nouveau Hollywood. And his second novel, \"Among the Dead,\" plumbed the darkest, angriest thoughts of a plane crash survivor. \"The Rapture,\" his haunting film about a woman bent on religious redemption, gazed with frightening intensity upon the failings of a morally debased world.\n\nIn writing dialogue for \"The New Age,\" Mr. Tolkin shows off that same sharpness, with a pitiless ear for his story's glib Californian characters. Phrases like \"following my bliss\" and \"money's not money; money's just an expression of something else\" summon the laissez-faire satirical style of Paul Mazursky, whose best films of the 1970's simply let such characters skewer themselves with small talk.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Tolkin tells a story that recalls the trendy truth-seekers of Mazursky films like \"Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice\" and \"Blume in Love.\" As Peter and Katherine fall into a fiscal sinkhole, they gravitate to various New Age teachers and healers while also moving into retailing, opening a boutique. The place, called Hip ocracy, is so au courant that a couple of spiritual advisers appear to give advice on where the dressing rooms ought to be. Not directly in line with the front door; too much bad energy from the street.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
