        "text": "“The Rapture: The Beginning of the End” is a close-up look at the scriptural event known as the Rapture. The documentary follows best-selling authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, as well as other Biblical experts, as they examine and decipher the doctrine of the Rapture. They address questions about the time frame, who will be removed from Earth, what will happen to those left behind, what percentage of people believe in the Rapture, etc. Natural disasters are addressed as well. The documentary also has film clips from the recent “Left Behind” movie starring Nicholas Cage.\n\nThe experts look into why the Rapture is Biblical even if the word isn’t found in the Bible. Or is it? We are pleased to award this documentary our Dove “Faith-Friendly” Seal for ages 12+. This profound film is both educational and entertaining."
