        "text": "Details:\n\nThe Block Museum of Art and Pritzker Pucker Studio Lab: Chicago Mental Health Film Showcase present:\n\nTHE RAPTURE (LE RAVISSEMENT) - Regional premiere\n\nRSVP\n\n(Iris Kaltenbäck,2023, 97 min, DCP, France)\n\nLydia (Hafsia Herzi), a caring young midwife, drifts through Paris after the relationship with her boyfriend falls apart. When her best friend Salomé (Nina Meurisse) becomes pregnant, Lydia spirals out of control, relentlessly throwing herself into her work at the maternity ward, while secretly obsessing over a one-night stand with Milos (Alexis Manenti). After taking worrisome risks with the delivery of Salomé's baby, Lydia helps out by babysitting while simultaneously spinning a web of lies that has dire consequences. Anchored by a beautifully subtle yet powerful performance by Hafsia Herzi, THE RAPTURE combines the tense, suspenseful elements of a procedural with an intimate view of Lydia's solitary existence and her ultimate unraveling. Far from didactic, the film reveals complex feelings and expectations about motherhood, romantic relationships, and friendship that bear down on Lydia. The first feature film by French director Iris Kaltenbäck, THE RAPTURE (LE RAVISSEMENT) premiered at the 2023 Cannes Critics' Week where it won the Prix SACD.\n\nFollowed by a post-screening discussion between Suzanne Rosenfeld, psychoanalyst, member of the Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute, andAmanda Parraguez, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University, specializing in 20th-century French literature and film.\n\nIn recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, Northwestern University's Pritzker Pucker Studio Lab presents the Chicago Mental Health Film Showcase (May 23 - 24, 2024) – two days of films, conversations, and a creative workshop with film consultant and narrative therapist Poh Lin Lee.\n\nAbout the lab: Northwestern University’s Pritzker Pucker Studio Lab for the Promotion of Mental Health via Cinematic Arts creatively examines representations of mental illness and health on screen."
