        "text": "Oct. 4, 2006 -- Organizers of the 19th Annual Virginia Film Festival have found God. And they are bringing “Him” to Charlottesville.\n\nLegendary actor Morgan Freeman is the latest to join the star-studded guest list for Revelations: Finding God at the Movies, the theme of this year’s Virginia Film Festival. The program of nearly 60 films and over 100 guests will explore the unique relationship between spirituality and cinema. The event, sponsored by the University of Virginia, is scheduled for October 26-29.\n\nVirginia Film Festival Director Richard Herskowitz expressed his satisfaction that after months of searching for films about God in the movies, “We found Him in our own backyard.” Morgan Freeman recently followed up his role as God in the hit film Bruce Almighty by filming the sequel, Evan Almighty, nearby in Crozet, Virginia. Freeman will return to the area to present his upcoming feature, 10 Items or Less. According to Herskowitz, “Freeman’s performance in this film is truly revelatory. He is funny and charismatic playing a movie star slipping out of the limelight. And it’s another sign of divine intervention that the production company backing the film, Freeman’s own, is called Revelations Entertainment.”\n\nFreeman will present Ten Items or Less accompanied by director Brad Silberling and producer Lori McCreary, Freeman’s partner in running Revelations Entertainment. They join a growing list of high profile talent confirmed for this year’s event, including actors Robert Duvall and Liev Schreiber and novelist/screenwriter Michael Tolkin.\n\nFor more information on the 19th Annual Virginia Film Festival, visit www.vafilm.com."
