        "text": "It is just before 1 P.M., and Michael Tolkin is sitting in The Ivy with all the Hollywood players.\n\nDavid Geffen, in a T-shirt, is huddled in whispered conversation with a hefty man in an expensive suit. The other tables at the restaurant on North Robertson Boulevard -- one of the most popular hangouts for Hollywood executives -- are filled with the tanned, the blond and the wealthy.\n\nA laughing blonde woman in a tight gray sweatsuit enters and table-hops. She resembles one of those only-in-Hollywood early-morning television exercise instructors. Mr. Tolkin stares at the woman with some confusion.\n\n\"Uncanny,\" he whispers. \"She obviously went to the same plastic surgeon as someone I know. She obviously saw this person I know and said, 'I want that!' The same thing! It's cheeks, chin, nose, eyes, breasts and lyposuction. She's had it all. You can tell. It's off the rack. Body by Doctor Fisher.\"\n\nMr. Tolkin glances around, amused and a bit uncomfortable. After years of struggle as a screenwriter, he wrote a scabrous novel, \"The Player,\" about a cunning studio executive who kills a screenwriter and gets away with it. It was published in 1988. The novel, of course, was transformed into the critically successful Robert Altman film with the same title. In places like The Ivy, the movie is a big inside joke.\n\nAlthough he's a hot writer in town right now, Mr. Tolkin is unrecognizable to the crowd at The Ivy. After all, he's only a writer. But given the success of \"The Player,\" isn't he a Player? \"No!\" he says firmly. \"I am not a Player. I can't green-light a picture. I doubt that I could get Kevin Costner to work with me on my next script.\n\n\"Look, nothing really happened until I was 40,\" continues the 42-year-old writer. \"There was a long period of frustration. People now say, 'Is this beyond your wildest fantasies?' Well, no, that's impossible. Nothing can be beyond my wildest fantasies. But it has been extraordinarily interesting to see what celebrity is, what attention is. Kafka said the devil is in the distractions and, well, in the last few months the distractions have been fantastic.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
