        "text": "By night Sharon (Mimi Rogers) leads a life of studied decadence, a response to the perfect emptiness of her days. When not tethered to her anonymous job as a telephone operator, she engages in mate-swapping sex with strangers, doing so in the impersonal confines of a friend's furniture store. \"What if things go out of control?\" asks a propective partner at the start of one such event. \"What's control got to do with it?\" Sharon tauntingly replies.\n\n\"I think he wants to know if you have any limits,\" suggests Vic (Patrick Bauchau), the friend who joins Sharon for these sexual adventures and whose own motives have more to do with libido than self-loathing. \"I haven't found them yet,\" Sharon says.\n\nBut in \"The Rapture,\" Michael Tolkin's fierce, frightening exploration of religious faith pushed to the breaking point, she finds those limits with the force of a revelation. Without warning, Sharon wakes up in the middle of the night in a frenzy of disgust. She orders a male acquaintance out of the bed she now says is unclean; she showers, flosses, changes the sheets and declares herself reborn. \"I need a new direction in my life,\" Sharon says. \"There is a God. I know it.\"\n\n\"The Player,\" Mr. Tolkin's scathing novel about a Hollywood executive who commits murder as a quasi-logical extension of his professional life, looks mild in comparison with what he has in mind this time. At first, that is belied by the eerily matter-of-fact manner in which he presents Sharon's conversion. Now she smiles more. She speaks of her new faith with serene self-assurance. She speaks of it so much that she begins to log seven-minute conversations with people calling her for directory assistance, which causes her supervisor to complain. \"Henry, God made me an information operator for a reason,\" she tells him smoothly.\n\nAll of Sharon's friends marvel at this transformation, particularly Vic, who thinks at first that she must have found a new man. \"Is he as bad a boy as I am?\" Vic slyly inquires. \"I think you should meet Him,\" Sharon replies. When her meaning begins to dawn on Vic, his leer evaporates and he tells Sharon to wake him when it's over.\n\nBut it doesn't end. Sharon, who always glimpsed what she thought were vague warning signs that the world was in peril, now becomes sure that Armageddon is near. And she aligns herself with a cult of like-minded individuals. All have had similar visions; all follow the teachings of a strange, oracular young boy; all wait with quiet certitude for what they know will come. In this, Mr. Tolkin is chillingly far away from the kind of movie theology that suggests the Apocalypse can be held at bay by a Terminator, that death is just a second chance, or that heaven is filled with thoughtful angels attending to the love lives of those on earth.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
