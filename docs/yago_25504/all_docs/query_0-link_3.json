        "text": "The one film I hadnâ€™t watched for my thesis and quite blown away by it. Begins sort of as a conspiracy thriller, a search for something more in a world full of lurid and meaningless action, and in many ways could be a prototype for The Matrix. Instead, itâ€™s actually more of an addiction film (much better than Requiem, though thatâ€™s not particularly difficult) in which drugs and sex turns into faith, which then builds into something stranger as it goes along. Tolkin has a truly dynamic paletteâ€”from the slow, methodical tracking shot in the moody blue haze that opens the film, to the jagged and hyper-bloated colors of the filmâ€™s erotic encounters, to a finale out of Bergman (withâ€¦\n\nA coworker said to me today, \"thank god it's Friday, now we just wait for retirement\" and the aimless rat race begins, void of purpose and meaning nestled in my hedonistic soul... should have waited for Rapture instead. There's an Atom Egoyan onion quality about it, sexual and mysterious, unpeeling each layer carefully to reveal another societal shadow self. The empty, the worthless, the meandering, the sad. Best representation of faith I've seen, for it isn't illustrating believers as spineless hypocrites or something, but capturing what faith is really about -- like knowing a secret you long to share with someone and in this case, that secret could grant you immortality. All you have to do is love and trustâ€¦\n\n\"Come on Mom, let's die\"â€” Mary.\n\nWhy does the poster look a bit racy?ðŸ˜­ With a different main storyline from the poster, it's enough to fool me lmao\n\n.\n\nTbh, this is not my cup of tea (one of the reasons is; cause I'm a non-Christian) BUT, The Rapture has a great atmosphere that feels very apocalyptic and melancholic and Mimi Rogers gives a very good performance!\n\nTo shake off the boring and monotonous work as a 411 phone operator for general information, Mimi Rogers (as Sharon) and her libertine mentor Patrick Bauchau cruise the city for swingers at night. Sharon has a non-consequential existence that isnâ€™t geared of anything for long-term value; her sexual adventures are just a way to numb everything out. But then she becomes curious, then converted: A born-again Christian who believes in the signs of almighty God, and prognostic that a worldâ€™s end rapture is coming within the next several years.\n\nAnd so the movie jumps ahead years at a time, quite easily with itself â€“ it has a curious elliptical style, although the episode with Sharon picking up hitcher James LeGrosâ€¦\n\nMy last New Cult Canon column, posted today. Excerpt:\n\n\"Tolkin doesnâ€™t pose these questions subtly. He poses them explicitly, sometimes gracelessly. Relatively new to filmmakingâ€”he had scripted Gleaming The Cube and wrote the novel The Player, which heâ€™d adapt for Robert Altman the next yearâ€”Tolkin offers some of the clinical atmosphere he would apply later to his underrated follow-up, The New Age, but heâ€™s more interested in simply following his heroineâ€™s moral journey from one extreme place to another. And thereâ€™s value in that: Movies about spiritual matters can get tacky when they try to find cinematic ways to express the infinite (just look at that girlsâ€™ Trapper Keeper folder Peter Jackson made called The Lovely Bones), but Tolkin hasâ€¦"
