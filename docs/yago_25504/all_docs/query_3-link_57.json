        "text": "Director/Producer Amanda Ladd-Jones is Alan Ladd, Jr.’s youngest daughter from his first marriage. She was born in London, six weeks before her father—Laddie, as he’s known to his friends—moved the entire family back to L.A. to begin his famously successful stint at 20th Century Fox. Amanda’s film education began at a very young age, seated on the floor of her father’s screening room while he ran movies for the industry’s most accomplished filmmakers. Between spending time on that screening room floor and visiting her dad at the office and on set, Amanda gained an insight into filmmaking to rival even the best film schools. After graduating high school in Los Angeles, Amanda moved to New York where she attended college and worked as a freelance film and television production accountant. In between jobs, Amanda pursued her passion for storytelling by writing screenplays. Eventually, Amanda’s screenwriting led her back to Los Angeles where she graduated from UCLA’s accredited screenwriting program. With LADDIE, Amanda set out to tell her most personal story of all—the story of her father, the quiet everyman behind STAR WARS and some of the most iconic films of the last 50 years.\n\nMake sure to subscribe to Popcorn Talk! - http://youtube.com/popcorntalknetwork HELPFUL LINKS: Website - http://popcorntalk.com Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/thepopcorntalk Merch - http://shop.spreadshirt.com/PopcornTalk/ ABOUT POPCORN TALK: Popcorn Talk Network is the online broadcast network with programming dedicated exclusively to movie discussion, news, interviews and commentary.

Her column, “Suburban Exposure,” covered politics and contemporary culture as well as her family and community, but she discontinued it after her sons left home and stopped providing her with material. She has freelanced for numerous publications including the New York Times. In addition to an undergraduate degree in history, she holds an MBA in economics and international business, and her first book, Toyland: The High-Stakes Game of the Toy Industry continued her work in business journalism. As a staunch feminist, Sydney particularly relished interviewing many of the leaders of the women’s movement for her first biography, Gloria Steinem: Her Passions, Politics, and Mystique.\n\nShe is involved in the leadership of two biographers’ groups, Women Writing Women’s Lives (WWWL), which is affiliated with City University of New York (CUNY), and the biography seminar of New York University (NYU). Although her biography of the Mankiewicz brothers is about two men, Sydney is grateful to have been grandmothered into WWWL. The NYU group addresses biographies by and about both men and women. Sydney also belongs to Biographers International Organization (BIO) an international group that supports biographers and biography. Its newsletter, The Biographer’s Craft, featured an interview with Sydney in its December 2019 issue.
