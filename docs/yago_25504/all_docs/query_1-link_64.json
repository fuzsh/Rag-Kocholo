        "text": "Screenwriter: Iris Kaltenbäck\n\nProducers: Alice Bloch-Robin, Thierry de Clermont Tonnerre\n\nCo-Presented by LACMA and Jacqueline Lyanga, Founder and Artistic Director of Global Cinematheque. Filmmaker travel support is provided by UniFrance.\n\nFeaturing a conversation with filmmaker Iris Kaltenbäck.\n\nThis winter, join guest curator Jacqueline Lyanga, Global Cinematheque’s Founder and Artistic Director, for a spotlight on auteur women of contemporary world cinema. This free public screening series will showcase debuts and second features from women who both write and direct their films. These filmmakers all bring their own distinct point-of-view and visual and narrative style and evolve the representation of women in cinema. The series will feature the Mexican film Tótem by Lila Avilés, the Malaysian film Tiger Stripes by Amanda Nell Eu, the French film The Rapture (Le Ravissement) by Iris Kaltenbäck, and the British film Girl by British-Nigerian filmmaker Adura Onashile.\n\nLydia, a midwife highly invested in her career, is going through a bad break-up that is making her feel like she has lost control of her life. Yet, when her pregnant best friend Salomé asks her to monitor her pregnancy, she cannot refuse, and neither of them is prepared for the turbulent emotional journey that they are about to embark on. Kaltenbäck’s first feature deftly explores and unravels the mythologies of motherhood and sisterhood with the influence of filmmakers Kelly Reichardt and Lucrecia Martel on display. The Rapture had its world premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival as part of the Critics Week (Semaine de la Critique) program where it won the SACD (Authors Society) Award.\n\nFilm Begins at 7:00 pm"
