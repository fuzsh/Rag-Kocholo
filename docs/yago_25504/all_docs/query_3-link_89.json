Sunset Boulevard (Directed by Billy Wilder, 1950)\n\nSunset Boulevard remains the great grand-daddy of “movies about movies.” Just as the titular road runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, the legendary “home of the stars”, so the film of the same name seems to run through the heart of all films about cinema.\n\nNearly seventy years after it was made, Sunset Boulevard has itself acquired the kind of mythical status that Wilder identified as the legacy of the original silent movie stars, such as Norma Desmond. Desmond, of course, was immortalised by the glorious Gloria Swanson, who was herself a legend of the “silent screen” who had largely failed to make the transition to “talkies,” making the film at least semi-autobiographical for her. In fact, the film was at least semi-autobiographical for all the principals. William Holden, who plays the desperate screenwriter Joe Gillis who becomes involved in a mutually exploitative (and ultimately mutually destructive) relationship with Norma, himself hailed originally from the Midwest, as Gillis does; Erich von Stroheim, Norma’s butler who had originally been her husband and director, was once a great film director (as he himself declares, one of the greatest of the silent era) reduced to the status of a jobbing actor; and of course Billy Wilder, the director and co-writer, was originally an Austrian immigrant with poor English who struggled to survive in “movie-town” after fleeing Nazi-dominated Europe. When Joe virtually crashes into Norma’s house when he is fleeing the bailiffs who want to repossess his car, it is tempting to see a little of Wilder himself in the role, fleeing the Nazis who wanted to kill him and every other Jew in Europe.\n\nSunset is aptly named first because it formally marked the end of the silent era (more than 20 years after it had actually come to an end with the arrival of Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer), and secondly because it represented a final great flowering of some of the finest talents of that remarkable age, the true dawn of cinema, including Swanson, Von Stroheim and even “old Stoneface” himself, Buster Keaton, who, the film suggests, went from being one of the most famous film stars and directors in the world to just another hand in a game of cards played by the old and almost completely forgotten.\n\nThe film itself, of course, is completely unforgettable."
