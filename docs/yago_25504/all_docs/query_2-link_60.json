        "text": "The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce honored actor David Duchovny with the 2,572nd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday, January 25, 2016. The star in the category of Television was dedicated at 6508 Hollywood Boulevard in front of the FOX Theatre.\n\nHelping Emcee and Hollywood Chamber President/CEO Leron Gubler to unveil the star were “X-Files” creator/director/executive producer Chris Carter and comedian Garry Shandling. “Fans are thrilled that their favorite actor David Duchovny has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is beloved by audiences worldwide for his television and film work,” stated Ana Martinez, Producer of the Walk of Fame ceremonies.\n\nEvent was live-streamed exclusively on www.walkoffame.com\n\nBorn and raised in New York City, Duchovny attended Princeton University where he played one season as shooting guard on the school’s basketball team. He received his Master’s Degree in English Literature from Yale and was on the road to earning his Ph.D. when he caught the acting bug.\n\nSubsequently, Duchovny emerged to become one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood. The star of 20th Century Fox Television’s international monster hit “The X-Files,” he was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series, he was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his highly acclaimed and some say risqué appearances on “The Larry Sanders Show.” In January 1997, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. He has been nominated for a total of three Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guild and a TV Critic’s Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. The press and the public both agree that Duchovny brings a fierce intellect, a quiet intensity and an acerbic wit to his roles on both the small screen and the silver screen.\n\nFans will be happy to know that thirteen years after the original series run, the next mind-bending chapter of “The X-Files” will be back with a thrilling, six-episode event series from creator/executive producer Chris Carter, with stars Duchovny and Gillian Anderson re-inhabiting their roles as iconic FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. This marks the momentous return of the Emmy- and Golden Globe Award-winning pop culture phenomenon, which remains one of the longest-running sci-fi series in network television history.\n\nThe two-Night Season Premiere airs Sunday, January 24, 10:00-11:00 PM ET/7:00-8:00 PM PT and Monday, January 25, 8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT on FOX. Beginning on Monday, January 25, the series will air in its Monday 8 PM timeslot.\n\nSince “The X-Files” debuted, millions and millions of self-proclaimed “X-Philes” spent their Sunday nights wide-eyed in anticipation as their hero, the brilliant and sullen FBI agent Fox Mulder, explored cases deemed unbelievable or unsolvable by the Bureau. Duchovny’s remarkable performance on “The X-Files” earned him the title of “Zeitgeist Icon” by Laura Jacobs in The New Republic, and “the first Internet sex symbol with hair” by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.\n\nDuchovny added the role of director to his already extensive list of accomplishments when he wrote, directed and starred in three critically acclaimed episodes of “The X-Files,” titled “The Unnatural,” which starred Jessie Martin; and “Hollywood A.D.”, starring Garry Shandling and actress Tea Leoni, and “William”. Other directing credits include the Fox hit series “Bones,” as well as, six episodes of “Californication.”\n\nDuchovny’s passion for renegade films has brought him critical acclaim for his performances in the feature films “Kalifornia,” in which he co-starred opposite Brad Pitt; “The Rapture,” the controversial film directed by Michael Tolkin in which Duchovny starred opposite Mimi Rogers; and “Julia Has Two Lovers,” in which he turned in a much heralded performance as a telephone hustler. Duchovny played Roland “Rollie” Totheroh, Charlie Chaplin’s longtime confidante and cameraman in the Sir Richard Attenborough directed “Chaplin,” which starred Robert Downey, Jr. in the title role; and starred in the smash hit “Beethoven,” opposite Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt. Feature credits include the Dreamworks action-comedy “Evolution,” opposite Julianne Moore and directed by Ivan Reitman, the MGM romantic-comedy “Return To Me,” opposite Minnie Driver, directed by Bonnie Hunt. “The X-Files” movie, and “Playing God,” with Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie. David went on to appear in a hilariously funny cameo in Ben Stiller’s film “Zoolander.”\n\nDavid is still recognized for his role as Dennis/Denise Bryson, the transvestite detective in David Lynch’s breakthrough television series “Twin Peaks.” Duchovny also spent four seasons as the impassioned narrator of Zalman King’s erotic anthology series Red Shoe Diaries,” which began as a feature length telefilm for Showtime.\n\nIn 2002, he starred in the Miramax ensemble comedy “Full Frontal,” for director Steven Soderbergh, co-starring Julia Roberts and George Clooney. David made brief returns to television, first appearing in good friend Bonnie Hunt’s show “Life With Bonnie,” in which he guest starred as over-the-top weatherman Johnny Volcano, for which he was nominated for an Emmy in 2003. Following that, he made a memorable appearance on “Sex And The City,” as an ex-flame of Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw character.\n\nHe made his feature directorial debut in 2005 with “House Of D” which he also wrote and appeared in. The film, which starred Robin Williams and Anton Yelchin, vividly captured the spirit of youth in all its joy and heartbreak.\n\nOther feature credits include “Trust The Man,” “The TV Set,” “Things We Lost In The Fire,” “The Secret,” “The X-Files: I Want To Believe,” and “The Joneses.”\n\nDuchovny ventured onto the stage starring off Broadway in Neil LaBute’s play “The Break Of Noon” in which he reunited with his “X-Files: I Want To Believe” co-star Amanda Peet.\n\nNext, he worked on the independent features “Goats” opposite Vera Farmiga, Ty Burrell, Graham Phillips and Dakota Johnson; “Phantom” opposite Ed Harris and the independent feature “Louder Than Words” opposite Hope Davis and Timothy Hutton.\n\nHis other long-running series “Californication” ended its 7-year run in Summer of 2015 for Showtime. Hank Moody marked another seminal character portrayed by Duchovny that has made it’s its way into our pop culture lexicon, and for whose portrayal he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Comedy series.\n\nDuchovny recently released his first studio album for ThinkSay Records which is being distributed by Caroline, and is available for download on iTunes.\n\nHis first novel Holy Cow was released by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in February 2015 and hit The New York Times® Best Sellers list. Hisnext book called Bucky Fu##ing Dent will be published on April 5th.\n\nEarlier this year he was seen in the Tomorrow Studios /NBC series “Aquarius,” which he executive produced and in which he stars. The complete series was released on premiere day on NBC.com, the NBC app and VOD. He is currently shooting the 2nd Season of “Aquarius” for NBC.\n\nDuchovny supports several charities including his recent hosting of “Red Nose Charity Day” to raise money for impoverished children in the U.S.\n\n***\n\nALL PRESS MUST RSVP TO ANA MARTINEZ AT (323) 468-1376 OR Stargirl@hollywoodchamber.net\n\nABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME www.WalkOfFame.com\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon.
