        "text": "Fergie, who appeared in the Weinstein Co.'s film \"Grindhouse,\" will play Saraghina in the film, a woman \"who introduces Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) to the world of sexuality,\" according to the industry paper.\n\nAs previously reported, Day-Lewis will head the cast of the screen adaptation of the Maury Yeston-Arthur Kopit musical of the same name. The star of \"There Will Be Blood\" stepped into the role of Italian filmmaker Guido Contini that was vacated by an over-worked Javier Bardem.\n\nCasting for the film also includes Penelope Cruz (Carla), Marion Cotillard (Luisa), Sophia Loren (Guido's Mother), Nicole Kidman, Kate Hudson and Judi Dench. The Weinstein Company produces the venture; Yeston and Kopit are on board as co-executive producers.\n\nRehearsals will begin in August at Shepperton Studios with filming scheduled to begin in October.\n\nYeston, who won a Tony Award for his score to Nine, has penned three new tunes for the upcoming film. According to the Daily Mail, the new tunes include \"Take It All,\" which will be performed by Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz and Marion Cotillard; and Cinema Italiano, which will be a big dance number performed by a Vogue journalist (Kate Hudson). The title of the third new song was not named. The 1982 Broadway musical Nine was inspired by Federico Fellini's film \"8 Â½.\" Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Michael Tolkin has penned the screenplay for the movie musical. The late Oscar-winning writer and director Anthony Minghella (\"The English Patient\") was brought in to rewrite Tolkin's screenplay shortly before his death in March.\n\nNine centers on Guido Contini, a heralded film director (much like Federico Fellini) who, fearing he is losing his touch, escapes to a Venetian spa for rejuvenation. Blurring the lines of fantasy and reality, the women in Contini's life swirl around him: His mother, his wife and his mistress ultimately serve as both distraction and inspiration."
