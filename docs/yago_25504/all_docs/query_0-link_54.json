        "text": "Directed by Michael Tolkin | USA | 110 mins\n\nWhile best known as the screenwriter for Robert Altman's pitch-black satire The Player, Michael Tolkin's remarkably ambitious directorial debut, The Rapture, tells the story of Sharon, a listless Los Angeles telephone operator, whose life finds orgiastic hedonism and apocalyptic Christianity in equal measure, only to have these seemingly disparate poles—the carnal and the sublime—tested in ways that, whether literal or metaphorical, prove enduringly unendurable.\n\nStarring Mimi Rogers in a performance hailed by Marxist film critic Robin Wood as “one of the greatest in the history of Hollywood cinema,” The Rapture is a terrifying and impassioned theistic provocation in an age of post-religiosity. This film will challenge viewers, leaving nonbelievers grappling with dark theological questions and believers questioning the foundations of their faith.\n\nWritten by David Telfer.\n\nRated 18A for sexual content.\n\nPart of our Divine Awakenings Series\n\nIn the spirit of respect, reciprocity and truth, we honour and acknowledge that this screening takes place on Moh’kinsstis and the traditional Treaty 7 territory, as well as the oral practices of the Blackfoot confederacy: Siksika, Kainai, Piikani as well as the Îyâxe Nakoda and Tsuut’ina nations. We acknowledge that this territory is home to the Otipemisiwak Métis Government of the Métis Nation within Alberta District 6. Finally, we acknowledge all Nations, Indigenous and non, who live, work and play, as well as help steward this land, honour and celebrate this territory."
