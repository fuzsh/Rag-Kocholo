In doing so, it locates the series within its genre; highlighting the ways in which it drew on, developed, and in some cases rejected earlier tropes, motifs and dramatis personae. Following on from this, the article will discuss the release of Left Behind: The Movie, its failure at the box office and critical panning, and the consequences that these have had on the rapture film industry. Finally, it concludes by discussing two recent releases by the mainstream production company The Asylum/Faith Films and what these mean for the future of the rapture film genre.",
