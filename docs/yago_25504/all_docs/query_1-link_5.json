While she has enjoyed professional success, she is less fortunate in her private life: another relationship of hers has broken down. At the same time, Lydia finds out that her best friend Salomé is pregnant. She supports her friend through her pregnancy and is in charge of delivering the baby. Shortly after the birth, Lydia is spending time alone with Salomé's baby when she runs into Milo, with whom she had a one-night stand after her break-up. She passes off Salomé's child as her own, and tells Milo that he is the biological father. At first Milo is suspicious, but he then embraces his new role as a father. Lydia works hard to keep up the lie.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHafsia Herzi as Lydia\n\nAlexis Manenti as Milos\n\nNina Meurisse as Salomé\n\nYounès Boucif as Jonathan\n\nRadmila Karabatic as Jelena\n\nDusko Badnjar as Ivan\n\nAna Blagojevič as Miléna\n\nGrégoire Didelot as Philippe\n\nMathieu Perotto as Julien\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Rapture is the feature film debut of French director Iris Kaltenbäck, who also wrote the screenplay.
