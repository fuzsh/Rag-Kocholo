        "text": "Spend any amount of time with me and it will likely become clear that I am not a religious person. Though I’m willing to concede the notion that there may be some greater universal forces at play in our lives, mostly because I’m terrified of the idea of blinking out of existence when my meat suit finally wears out, I think religion – all religion – is a bunch of absolute horseshit narcissists and sociopaths use to hoodwink the vulnerable and the stupid. I don’t have an issue with spiritual rituals and practices or the maintaining of traditions as long as they’re geared towards fostering peace within yourself while trying to make the maliciously long arc of life a little less fucking tedious for others. But when you’re asking people to believe in fairy tales and telling them they need to endure misery in life in the hopes that their faith will be rewarded when they die, I’m inclined to help you to the express line of that discovery.\n\nBut it’s easy to question these things when you exist outside a structure which reinforces the often dangerous notion of faith. See, we have an issue with how we define faith in this world, often confusing it with belief. Belief means you’ve accepted the truth of something, which is fine as long as you’re prepared to re-evaluate that belief if it’s properly challenged. Faith can be far more menacing. Faith is placing complete and utter trust in something or someone and when you sacrifice that to religion it means that you willingly accept what your being sold without the need for proof. Once you’ve crossed that line the opportunities for dangerous manipulated increase multi-fold.\n\nOne of the great leaps of faith religion asks you to make is that if you behave the way they tell you while you’re alive, when you die you get to go to a place where everything is just awesome all the time. No matter what happens on Earth, no matter how bad it gets, no matter how terrible people are or how much you or anyone else suffers if you just stick to your faith and do whatever is asked of you, you’ll be one of the Jenga pieces left standing when the game ends. And depending on what you believe, the Rapture is when god will finally shake the table. According to these people, if you’ve chosen to give your self over to Jesus Christ as the iterative representative of god, pledge your love and devotion to him and ask for his forgiveness, he will open up the gates and usher you through to paradise with a symphony of trumpets and al the Moose Tracks ice cream you can eat. Of course like all religions it’s an entirely self-affirming, self-serving rule set that states only the people who follow this specific iteration of the religion are going to be saved in the end.\n\nHowever the right amount of distance allows for an interesting question; how far are you willing to take your faith and what do you do if the reward isn’t worth the cost? This is one of the ideas that writer/director Michael Tolkin took on in his 1991 directorial debut, The Rapture. The film follows Mimi Roger’s Sharon as she finds redemption from her empty, hedonistic lifestyle after hearing of people dreaming of a mysterious pearl and a young boy prophesying Revelation. Convincing lover Randy (David Duchovney) to join her in salvation, she questions her faith after his murder and a series of visions leads her to take their young daughter to the desert to await the end of days. When her willingness to endure finally collapses she makes a terrible choice. And when the end comes, knowing all she has to do is ask for forgiveness and profess her love for god to join her family in paradise, she instead questions why she should love a god that allows such suffering to occur.\n\nLet me get this out of the way – The Rapture isn’t an interesting piece of filmmaking from the perspective of creating a cinematically engaging work. Even if you reduced the challenges to the films $3M dollar budget, as a first time director (who would only go on to direct a handful of times despite a long career as a writer and producer) Tolkin didn’t really have what it took to envision or produce the film in an interesting manner. It’s a professional production to be sure; it doesn’t look like it was created by a bunch of third year film majors over a weekend in their parents backyard. But it’s not an interesting piece of a visual storytelling. The Rapture exists in the cinema of ideas, taking a thought process or perspective and dramatizing it through character. Though the film doesn’t name any specific religious affiliation for Sharon and Randy, it’s pretty obvious their faith is meant to reflect an experience of the then growing Evangelical Christian movement in America. The film isn’t an examination of faith in terms of the mechanics, structures, beliefs or practices of that or any other religion. Instead, it tries to compress the experience of, “being saved” and living in that faith even when if ultimately disappoints you.\n\nTolkin is unflinching in his perspective on the material. Working with cinematographer Bojan Bazelli the film is solid. It’s not stylish, but it’s smart and along with Thomas Newton’s sparse scoring it gets the job done in supporting the various emotions of Sharon’s journey from sinner to faithful. But let’s be clear; no one is going to accuse Tolkin of being a visionary filmmaker based on this work. It’s restrained palate and low contrast imagery does the job needed to support the films moody text and that obviously matters, but many would say the point of cinematic filmmaking is to elevate the text and bring the audience inside the material in a way words can’t do alone. It shouldn’t be seen as a dealbreaker, but it might present a significant barrier of entry for some.\n\nIt’s hard to say whether or not the film is a condemnation of religious faith or if it’s specifically making a point out of those end times bible beaters, but what I found most significant is that it doesn’t poke fun at the characters for maintaining or practicing their faith. Where other films would lead the audience into a conflict between the demands practicing their faith places on the characters and the reality of the world around them, the conflict here isn’t that whether or not that faith was misplaced. There is no ambiguity about the reality of god in this universe and that’s where the ultimate conflict arises. It’s an interesting examination of the idea of living a religious life, specifically within the context of end times prophecy, as Sharon is forced to confront the, “reality” that at the end (at least in this universe) how you lived your life doesn’t matter as long as you’re penitent in the last minutes of armageddon. It’s a rather profound observation that many have attempted to rationalize within their own religious boundaries but can never quite seem to get over the literality of the text. What this leads to is a character who, instead of finding a resolution, ends their arc in perpetual conflict, trapped in a literal purgatory as the sole human attempting to hold god responsible for its apathy towards humanities living experience.\n\nIn doing so, this asks the audience to contemplate a question about the nature of hell in a world where there is only heaven and Earth. Where does a sinner go when they believe they should be punished and god won’t pull the trigger? C.S. Lewis once said the doors in hell are locked from the inside and we reside there in our rejection of god. This is envisioned in the film not as a place of wailing and suffering under brimstone streaked skies of fire. Instead it’s simply a barren land within sight of paradise where the sole resident stays because they demand of god the one thing god cannot seem to give; proof that it cares. A self-imposed purgatory is purgatory still, and a truly loving god wouldn’t allow anyone to punish themselves, would it?\n\nWhile this is a very interesting idea, and Mimi Rogers does excellent work with some very difficult material, another thing anyone who knows me will tell you is that I don’t give bonus points to a film based on how interesting or challenging the material is. Choosing or creating interesting material is incredibly important to making an engaging film but you still have to deliver on that film. The great solace a filmmaker can take is, no matter what someone like me might think, is that they come away from the the experience feeling as if they got as much of their vision for the film up on the screen within whatever limitations they might have had. A powerful idea executed clumsily or cheaply won’t have much impact. But a powerful idea executed competently and with clear focus on a goal is going to stick with people. So while The Rapture may not be the most exhilarating cinematic experience, the filmmaking on display is competent and focused enough that the ideas have some sticking power. (Note: I took a protracted break from this article that was months long and I was able to pick back up where I left off because the film, for what it is, stuck with me. I consider that meaningful, even if the material ultimately doesn’t challenge my perspective very much.)\n\nThe Epicurean Paradox posits, as put by Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor, that the existence of evil in the world means that god can not be both all good and all powerful. While The Rapture doesn’t directly call out this paradox it does stand as a kind of look at the idea in practice. How can a being, supposedly the embodiment of love and goodness, allow terrible suffering to occur even if it only takes a few words after the fact to gain access to everlasting paradise? How is it right or fair that everyone gets the same chance at the end no matter how they chose to live their life? If true justice means everyone is held accountable for the pain they cause who then holds god accountable for the results of their, “mysterious ways”? The Rapture may not be the most exciting cinematic experience but it is an interesting look at the dark side of absolute faith and the price we pay for our piece of paradise.\n\nClever endings aren’t my bag.\n\nLaterz"
