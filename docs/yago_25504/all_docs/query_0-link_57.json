It stars Mimi Rogers as a woman who converts from a swinger to a born-again Christian after learning that a true Rapture is upon the world.[4]\n\nThe low-budget film was a box office disappointment while critical reception was generally positive, with Rogers' performance praised as perhaps the best of her career."
