Directed by Michael Tolkin | USA | 110 mins

While best known as the screenwriter for Robert Altman's pitch-black satire The Player, Michael Tolkin's remarkably ambitious directorial debut, The Rapture, tells the story of Sharon, a listless Los Angeles telephone operator, whose life finds orgiastic hedonism and apocalyptic Christianity in equal measure, only to have these seemingly disparate poles—the carnal and the sublime—tested in ways that, whether literal or metaphorical, prove enduringly unendurable.

Starring Mimi Rogers in a performance hailed by Marxist film critic Robin Wood as “one of the greatest in the history of Hollywood cinema,” The Rapture is a terrifying and impassioned theistic provocation in an age of post-religiosity. This film will challenge viewers, leaving nonbelievers grappling with dark theological questions and believers questioning the foundations of their faith.

Written by David Telfer.
