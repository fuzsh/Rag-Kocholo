The Rapture is a 1991 drama film written and directed by Michael Tolkin. It stars Mimi Rogers as a woman who converts from a swinger to a born-again Christian after learning that a true Rapture is upon the world.[4]

The low-budget film was a box office disappointment while critical reception was generally positive, with Rogers' performance praised as perhaps the best of her career.
