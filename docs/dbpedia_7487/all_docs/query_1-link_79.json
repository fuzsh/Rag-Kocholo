        "text": "Somehow I just discovered math rock like this past weekend which is wild to me since my musical tastes in the mid 2000s were firmly in the emo and the emo-adjacent stuff. I strayed away from that a bit as I got older but recently have gone back and started listening to all the old albums I used to love and then YouTube started recommending me math rock guitar videos and the rest is history.\n\nI've not yet dove fully head first into what I think most folks would classify as actual math rock and have stayed on the emo side of it with groups like American Football. Any recommendations on the genre or just generally things I should be looking for?\n\nEdit: Amazing suggestions from all. I've added it to a YouTube playlist I'll keep updated. Cheers everyone!\n\nYeah, I feel like most people get into math rock via emo, specifically American Football (which is an amazing album). I feel like a generally good starting point for more traditional math rock is Hella's Hold Your Horse Is. It might be a little harsher than what you're expecting though. I'd also recommend Don Caballero, specifically their album American Don really got me into the genre when I was a teenager. If you want something a little more accessible, Battles' first album Mirrored is really fun.\n\nCovet\n\nRolo Tomassi\n\nAre Rolo Tomassi math rock(these days?)? Granted I haven't heard them in about 12 years when they were playing at a bunch of venues in the north including my local but they couldn't have been anything further from math rock. They were pretty much a noise band back then.\n\nAnyway, math rock..\n\n(Little Explorer and Jesus Years were a couple of bands who went on to form Crash of Rhinos who were also great. Used to play in my town all the time. Brilliant live. Drummer was a machine even though he had the physique of a 12 year old)\n\nThe Math Rock Collective - Youtube\n\nThe above channel is a great resource for math rock.\n\nPeople will police the term and say this isn't that this isn't this, including my recommendation, but I'll still say it: tricot\n\nCheers for the suggestion. I get policing the genre in terms of what people consider stuff to be but honestly as long as it's at least adjacent and evokes the same feel then I'm super lax on genre personally. People can get a bit gatekeeper-y and use it as a way to feel elitist and it makes it hard to just enjoy music. So no worries there.

I'm just blown away I had never heard of math rock as a genre or even American Football at all. It's right up 14 year-old me's alley. Music is wonderful isn't it? There's really just so much out there that you couldn't ever listen to all of it if you wanted to.\n\nThe midwest emo stuff really bridges naturally into it.

Give it a listen."
