        "text": "No, and no.\n\nGenesis doesn't even come remotely close to \"math rock.\"\n\nAnd \"Turn it on Again....\" where is the \"angular melody\" or \"dissonant chords?\"\n\nMath rock is stuff like Dillinger Escape Plan, Zevious, Lightning Bolt, Battles, etc.\n\nIf you need a progressive rock era influence to call \"proto math rock,\" the only contender of any renown would be 1973/74-era King Crimson.\n\nThe \"unusual time signatures\" thing seems to be tripping people up. Yes, math rock deploys lots of changing time signatures, just like heavy metal uses distorted electric guitars. But just as not all rock music with distorted electric guitars is heavy metal, neither is all rock music with unusual time signatures \"math rock.\"\n\nI think that the best answer is \"at times, maybe.\"\n\nAmong the characteristics you mention as some define it, here's my opinion, and I've played jazz, rock, punk, classical and prog on bass and guitar over the past 40 years:\n\nComplex, atypical rhythmic structures - Yes, but I would state that the rhythmic structure is somewhat based upon meter, which is the basis of time signature. Rhythmic structure is not directly linked to meter;\n\nIrregular stopping and starting - I can't comment on this; it's no more part of prog than it is of classical, but prog has some basis in classical;\n\nCounterpoint - this is a contentious point. It's used regularly in classical and rarely in rock. Now, Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia did this to great effect. You'all may not like the Good Old Grateful Dead, but they used counterpoint more than any rock band I know of;\n\nOdd time signatures- hardly unique to prog. See Stravinsky and Schoenberg, but maybe that makes your point;\n\nAngular melodies - See Soft Machine, Henry Cow, Grateful Dead, and Zappa, none of which are particularly prog;\n\nExtended, often dissonant chords - see so much material that isn't prog. Albert Ayler, Steve Lacy, Cecil Taylor, Don Pullen, Sam Rivers, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Sun Ra/Arkestra, and at times, Grateful Dead. And that's just a few.\n\nYou can't simplify complex approaches into a single genre. While I don't particularly care for Genesis in any way shape, or form they had their time and it was well-earned and deserved. So no, I don't consider them to be math rock per se. I don't think about that sort of categorization at all. I don't see the point."
