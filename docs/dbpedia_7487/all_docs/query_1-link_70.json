        "text": "The New Yorker had an article recently on progressive rock — it’s origins, reasons for its popularity, and reasons for its subsequent unpopularity — and one of the best things about this article was that they actually got this one very crucial detail right — the most quintessential, most prototypical, most genre-defining prog-rock band is actually King Crimson — not Jethro Tull, not Genesis, and definitely not Pink Floyd.\n\nThis is a very nice article on prog rock, and bolsters one of my main criticisms of the genre — they tried to make rock music into serious “art”, but to do so they looked mainly to classical music for inspiration and tried to recreate the symphonic form within a rock context — which is all well and good, except then it just became classical music played with rock instruments — where, then, is the high art that is quintessentially “rock” in nature? Why not just play Wagner in a heavy metal form or Mozart with synths?\n\nWhile prog rock fell short of this lofty aim of making a “high art” version of rock, it was, I think, post-rock that truly succeeded for the most part — and by post-rock I do not mean the sugary third wave stuff like God is an Astronaut or This Will Destroy You or Sigur Ros, I only use the term to refer to first- and second-wave post-rock, from Talk Talk/Bark Psychosis in the late 80s to Slint in the early 90s through Mogwai and GY!BE in the late 90s and early 2000s (bands like Tortoise and Mogwai are still going strong, churning out an album every year or two, but their early work is what stands as a testimonial to their impact, that truly defined the genre for everything that followed). For clarity, I have included a playlist at the end of the post for examples of what I mean by post-rock.\n\nPost-rock recreated the rock genre by adding innovations and techniques that can be considered hallmarks of high art — adding noise/drone, complex textures, alternative timbres, “wall of sound”, etc. that can serve as alternative tools and metrics to the traditional concepts like harmony and melody — and truly absorbed ideas and elements from everywhere including jazz and Indian classical music and adapted them enough to make a uniquely “rock” sound while still remaining true to the roots — and did this without turning rock into jazz or classical music, like prog rock ended up doing. The musical arrangement in post-rock was minimalist as opposed to prog-esque maximalist, but most importantly, it was something new — not a rehashed, even if cleverly rehashed, version of the old.\n\nTracks like “Djed”/ “Glass Museum” (Tortoise), “Washer”/ “Nosferatu Man” (Slint), “Like Herod”/ “Music for a Forgotten Future” (Mogwai), “Eden”/“Ascension Day” (Talk Talk), “Storm”/ “Static”/ “Sleep” (GY!BE), etc. re-define rock as a genre and as a sound — much more than, say, punk or grunge or alternative/indie rock which are so much more banal and uni-dimensional and unoriginal in comparison, enjoyable though they may be, and are little more than the sum of their constituent parts .\n\nOf course, there are indeed rock genres that are truly innovative and have a very unique sound, like shoegaze and math rock and the various subgenres in metal, but post-rock draws inspiration from and incorporates elements of each of these, so I don’t mention them separately.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nAlso, it never ceases to surprise me what people expect the “typical” length of a song should be. The incredulity with which the writer considers the lead song “that was more than six minutes long” is amusing to say the least — nearly all post-rock songs easily touch or pass the 6-minute mark (“Take Me Somewhere Nice”), most are closer to 8–10 minutes (“Helicon 1”, “Like Herod”), and many go on for more than 20–25 minutes (“Music for a Forgotten Future”).\n\nI think one of the main reasons for songs becoming longer might be that music consumption has moved beyond the radio and into collectibles and streaming services — the radio is still there, but since they have to cater to a large audience, they keep the song lengths reasonably short, so that even if you don’t like a particular song that is playing, it will soon end and you need not change the channel. This is no longer true for tapes, cassettes, cds, vinyl, and personalised curated playlists on Spotify, hence longer tracks are no longer a deal-breaker. Of course, for nearly all rock genres, the primary and most “important” way of consumption is live performances — as opposed to listening on the radio or on vinyl, etc. This is not really true anymore for prog-rock and post-rock — the studio recordings and live performances of these songs are often very, very different from each other (to the extent that Mogwai actually released a separate album consisting solely of their live performances, for the same songs that have already existed for years as in-studio recordings). The raw energy of the live performance in a positive feedback loop with the cheering crowds is something that is impossible to capture in a studio recording — but on the other hand, you also cannot replicate all the subtle details of in-studio musical arrangement during a live performance. It is the latter in which prog rock and post-rock shine — complex musical arrangement is a hallmark of both genres, unlike, say, punk or grunge — so the studio recordings offer a unique experience that is on an equal footing with live performances, or perhaps even in excess of, in importance.\n\nOf course, judging musical merit by the length of a song (as the article seems to suggest), and whether it has any “movements”, falls prey to that same kind of thinking that considers “classical music” as the be-all-and-end-all of Western music as an art form. It’s an antiquated mode of thinking, and so very antediluvian that it deserves to be locked up in a chest along with all the Dickens novels, as something that made sense in the past but is unhealthy to glorify or obsess over anymore.\n\nAs a final note, I really dislike musical (or literature or scientific) terminology which have temporal semantics, like “progressive rock”, “post-rock”, “modernism”, etc., because they invariably outgrow their moniker, and it sounds anachronistic when talking about them. Is progressive rock still progressive? Is post-rock still post-rock or are we doing post-post-rock? Is “modernism” still modern? Even post-modernism is decades old now, and people are talking about a post-“post” era. At some point we will run out of all the descriptors (we have already cycled through “progressive”, “post”, “new” and even “nu”) and when that happens, how shall we talk about music anymore?\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\nPlaylist of selected samples from first- and second-wave post rock:"
