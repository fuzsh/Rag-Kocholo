Nothing too special aside from the bootlegs.\n\nSeeing as how no one even cared about that other slint thread, maybe people will keep this one bumped.\n\nWhat pedals did they use? Does anyone know for sure? I heard it was all just boss, mxr, dod type stuff. Someone said DS-1. This sounds right, but not completely. There are quite a few tones that are way fuzzier.\n\nAnyway; math rock.\n\nThe obvious choices: Slint, Shellac, Rodan, June of 44, Don Caballero, Battles\n\nLesser known math rock; Drive Like Jehu, Crain.\n\nAnyone have anymore lesser knowns?\n\nDiscuss the majesty of math rock.\n\nI don't know if Cap'n Jazz counts, but they definitely had some pretty out-there stuff. But they don't really fit with most of those bands (Drive Like Jehu was a bit heavier, but prob the closest out of all of them). Another lesser known group that would fit in with all of that is a File-13 band called Shake Ray Turbine who were absolutely mind-blowing. Just my 2cents\n\nI don't know if Cap'n Jazz counts, but they definitely had some pretty out-there stuff.

Another lesser known group that would fit in with all of that is a File-13 band called Shake Ray Turbine who were absolutely mind-blowing. Just my 2cents\n\nyeah, I had alphabeticala834w3ia or whatever on my desktop for awhile, but I decided I wasn't ever going to listen to it, so I ditched it.\n\nUp some Shake Ray? just a song maybe to give us an idea? I'll trade an album with you if you want.\n\nI dont get the term. People call TOOL math-prog-art-rock.\n\nIve also seen Meshuggah dubbed \"math-metal\". Great band, btw. {censored}, both are great bands.\n\nTool isn't math-y at all. They're prog metal. Math doesn't just mean oblique time signatures and shifting them at break neck speed, it's just... i don't even think it's a real term, it's just a scene really. Like grunge.\n\nI thought meshuggah was just a stoner metal band or something.\n\nMathcore is bull{censored} like DEP.\n\nHaha, bands are starting to call themselves Deathcore. Death metal with post-hardcore. hahahhaha.\n\nI can't wait for Bootgaze, the metal version of shoegaze.\n\nA lot of math rockers hate the term math rock and math rocker. I don't know why. Maybe they don't want anymore pretentiousness assigned to them then they already have.\n\nI just don't like putting music into boxes, especially when most of those bands are doing something outside of the box (and they are all pretty different). I also hate the terms 'shoegaze' 'grunge' 'screemo' and all this other nonsense...it's just all so meaningless and I think most good original music deserves to be taken on it's own merit not shoved into some stupid scene or genre.\n\nI flew to NYC to see Slint play Spiderland in July. It was as unbelievable of an aesthetic experience as I have ever had. Absolutely spectacular.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't concentrate on the gear too much, just the playing.\n\nSpiderland is as good as {censored} in this world gets and the last 40 seconds of Good Morning Captain may be the greatest part in musical history.\n\nI just don't like putting music into boxes, especially when most of those bands are doing something outside of the box (and they are all pretty different).

I don't agree with it, but it does help give an idea of a band. Unless you're some faggot who tires endlessly over what kind of genre the band is in.\n\nI flew to NYC to see Slint play Spiderland in July.

You know they're working on a new album? Well, sort of. They were looking for a rehearsal space somewhere in louisville a few months back and they were going to mess around and see where it took them. Did they play \"King's Approach\" when you saw them? Someone in the netherlands said they played it, and it was a new song. Playing GMC in your basement is awesome too as well, believe it or not. Especially if you have a telecaster.\n\nI'll post the links to the GPro files of the Slint songs i mentioned in the other thread.\n\nhttp://ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/s/slint/breadcrumb_trail_guitar_pro.htm\n\nhttp://ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/s/slint/nosferatu_man_guitar_pro.htm\n\nThe breadcrumb trail one has a lot more thought put into it, it seems. the nosferatu man only has one track and the drum track where it's only the drums. for cues I guess. they're pretty accurate though.\n\nMost bands don't really seem to like being called any sort of sub-genre; math-rock, shoegaze, etc... I guess it helps to describe a group to someone, but I could see it being annoying. Analphabetapolothology is everything cap'n jazz did (as far as I know), and I really love that album. It took a while to get used to it when I was in junior high/high school (the vocals mainly), but it eventually became one of my favorites. They were actually on the way to play a show with my friends' band when they broke up. As for Shake Ray Turbine, I don't really know how to upload anything, but here: http://www.myspace.com/shakerayturbine Some interesting stuff on Wikipedia about them, too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Ray_Turbine\n\nWould Chavez fit with any of those bands? Probably not, but I always tend to think of them when I think of Slint, Shellac or DLJ\n\nI really like Slint, but I got into them way late, and backwards. I discovered the band Tortoise and loved them, and then found out that David Pajo used to be in Slint, so I checked them out and liked them. I know \"Spiderland\" gets more praise but my favorite Slint stuff is the first two songs on Tweez. The first time I heard Slint I thought \"WHERE did this stuff come from?\" I would love to see them on tour and I hope they do some new material, too."
