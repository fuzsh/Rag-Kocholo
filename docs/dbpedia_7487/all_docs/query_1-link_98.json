        "text": "Math rock, post-rock, noise-rock and instrumental\n\nWe’ve always been passionately involved with leftfield genres of music; and outside of our jobs as music PRs, we have even toured in bands that would happily fit in one or more of the genres above.\n\nWe pride ourselves in our eclectic tastes and specialist knowledge of writers and editors’ musical interests. This is particularly important when working on math-rock, post-rock, noise-rock or instrumental rock campaigns: although there is arguably more fan support than ever before for leftfield music, particularly across social media, there is less and less rock and specialist media that cover these genres. With Prescription, you’ll have a PR team which will search out writers, columns and new publications that will.\n\nOur team have strong connections with the key traditional rock publications — Kerrang!, Upset, Metal Hammer, Classic Rock, Prog, Louder, New Noise Magazine and Louder Than War — but we’ve also been able to secure coverage for a number of math rock / post-rock artists in areas such as MOJO, Q, Uncut, the Guardian, Total Guitar, Guitar Techniques, The Line Of Best Fit, The Wire, the Quietus, Stereogum, Consequence of Sound, Brooklyn Vegan and NPR.\n\nTrack record\n\nOur previous clients include the ground-breaking post-rock act Slint, who hired us as their UK partners to publicise the anniversary set of “Spiderland” on Touch & Go.\n\nFor this, we achieved lead reviews in Mojo, Q, Wire, Uncut and more – selling out the box set ahead of release.\n\nWe also worked “Two”, the first album from the avant-garde rock act Owls in 13 years, and saw American Football play a triumphant first set of shows in the UK, selling out all 7 dates.\n\nWe’ve also worked extensively with name artists including Belfast’s And So I Watch You From Afar, Oceansize frontman Mike Vennart, Brighton math-rock favourites Delta Sleep, the darkly cinematic Caspian and seminal modern math-rock giants The Fall Of Troy, securing coverage in rock areas and further afield.\n\nWhether you’re an established artist or label looking to build on previous press coverage or a new artist trying to break into the media for the first time, we have the means to get your music in front of the right people in the key areas that are most likely to cover your music.\n\nIf you’d like to discuss your project, get in touch today."
