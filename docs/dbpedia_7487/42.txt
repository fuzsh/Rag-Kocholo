Math rock is a style of music that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures, counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often dissonant, chords. It is rooted in post-hardcore and progressive rock, and often incorporates elements of jazz, funk, and noise rock. Math rock is known for its use of intricate guitar work, often accompanied by drums and bass guitar, as well as its tendency to avoid repeating musical structures. Many math rock bands have strong DIY sensibilities, often producing their own music and artwork.

The history of math rock can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when bands such as Don Caballero, Slint, and Rodan were starting to experiment with unconventional rhythms and atypical song structures. This music was heavily influenced by post-hardcore, progressive rock, and jazz, as well as punk and noise rock. As the genre developed, it began to incorporate more complex rhythms, dissonant chords, and extended musical structures. By the mid-1990s, math rock had become a distinct genre with its own recognizable sound.
