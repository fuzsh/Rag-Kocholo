        "text": "WHO'S INVOLVED\n\nJARED GARFIELD is the writer, director and co-producer. Jared is an actor/writer with a background in dance and choreography. He has created dance films such as Phone Romance (commissioned by Canvas) and A Memory of Me (commissioned by Dance Film Festival UK). This will be his first narrative fiction.\n\nCAMERON RICHARDS of Lonely Kite Pictures is co-producing. Cameron has a proven track record in creating powerful and impactful shorts, including The Sea, which starred Anna Friel and Russell Tovey and was released in association with Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nTWAN PEETERS is the Director of Photography. Twan is a Dutch cinematographer and alumni from The National Film & Television School in the UK. His work is focussed on narrative fiction, documentary, music video’s and art films shot across the UK and the Netherlands.\n\nISABEL GARFIELD is on Production Design. She is an artist and art department trainee with experience working on TV productions and scenic painting. Her credits include Heartstopper (Netflix) and she trained at the Royal Drawing School. Her art work will be featured in the film.\n\nPATRIZIO KNIGHT is our composer. Patrizio is a British/Italian composer based in Brighton. Most notably, he composed the music for Channel 4 and Netflix production The Circle, Channel 4 production Rise & Fall as well as scoring the award winning feature film Twice Shy. Previously to composing, Patrizio toured internationally as a session musician playing on some of the worlds most prestigious stages.\n\nSHANA SWASH will play 'Tara'. Her credits include; My Feral Heart, Eastenders (BBC), Top Boy (Netflix) and Love Without Walls, which recently won Best Film at the UK Film Awards and has been nominated in four categories at the National Film Awards.\n\nTONE AND FEEL\n\nThe film will aim to subvert expectations of what a British family comedy drama can look and feel like: soft colour tones, working class characters from inner city London, honest and imperfect lighting. The film will feel like it could go to very dark places, but it never quite travels that far. Silence will deepen the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, amplified by other sounds that we wouldn’t ordinarily take much notice of - the kettle boiling, the printer printing, a clearing of the throat, the sipping of tea. Key tonal references are Alexander Payne's Nebraska for it's dry wit in the way it deals with family relationships. Also Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story and Hagai Levi's Scene's from a Marriage in how they explore resentment and conflict.\n\nTHE DIRECTOR'S VISION\n\n\"I want to show the messiness of grief, family and the emotional experience of being\n\ndisinherited. I want to explore how we connect to places and material objects differently,\n\nand the awkward parallel meanings they can hold. A house is on one hand a home where we spent our most formative years, full of memories and emotion, but also a material asset. And for Jake an opportunity for a different life. At its heart it's a human story about a brother and sister, who are worlds apart finding\n\nthemselves thrust together by the most profound shared experience siblings can have, and\n\nthe challenge of them navigating it together. I want audiences to go away from this with a\n\nrenewed sense of value in the meaningful relationships they have, and to offer hope that no matter how difficult, bridges can always be built between us.\""
