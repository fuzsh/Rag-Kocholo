        "text": "We caught up with up-and-coming artist Natalie Red about her eagerly awaited EP, ‘Silence Through These Walls’. This vibrant new project continues to challenge conventions and overturn genre clichés, from the vertiginous rhythms of the EP’s debut single “U Been On My Mind” to the serene and captivating atmospheres of her latest track “Official”. No less exciting, the EP’s namesake track “Silence Through These Walls” dazzles with compelling hooks and bright melodies, marking a quintessential end to this enchanting five-track endeavour. Natalie’s poetic skills are reflective and connect profoundly, drawing listeners into a limitless sonic landscape. Her latest EP builds on the momentum of her earlier singles, including the dynamic “OVER”, a zestful cut of PC Music-inspired futurism that affirmed her as a noteworthy talent.\n\nKALTBLUT: You’ve mentioned that the lyrics of your latest song “Official” express frustrations with today’s dating scene. Could you elaborate on how your personal experiences influenced the writing of this song?\n\nNatalie: Well, I wrote this song before experiencing what the lyrics talk about. Maybe I manifested it through the song but everything came true. I feel like my generation has such a short attention span that plays into losing interest quickly along with having the illusion of choice. People think they have so many options to choose from and date when in reality, it’s often not true. I think that my generation is less likely to settle down, commit, and focus on one person at a time, which sucks.\n\nKALTBLUT: With your EP ‘Silence Through These Walls’ on the horizon, what themes or messages do you hope to convey through this collection of songs?\n\nNatalie: All the songs explore themes of love, nostalgia, and longing. The lyrics are a mix of my own personal experiences and made up stories. I like to also pull inspiration from the people around me, whether it be my family, friends, or anyone else that I meet. I hope that listeners of this EP feel a sense of peace, relatability, and fun. I want people to live life to the fullest and understand that the bad always comes with the good. You cannot truly appreciate what you have if you haven’t experienced a loss of it in some way.\n\nKALTBLUT: You’ve cited a range of influences from Ariana Grande to Pharrell Williams. How do these artists shape your musical vision, especially when it comes to production?\n\nNatalie: For me, Ariana Grande was always my pop star icon. She taught me how to sing and do riffs & runs. I also learned about performances through her and how to carry yourself as an artist. Pharrell is my biggest production influence but he also inspired me by the way he thinks. I like to watch and listen to a lot of interviews of artists and Pharrell’s have always been my favorites. With production, he isn’t afraid of trying new things, thinking outside of the box, and standing out. He knows the importance of artistry and being yourself, which I really resonate with.\n\nKALTBLUT: Considering your successful past singles like “OVER,” which music industry recognitions or responses have meant the most to you, and why?\n\nNatalie: Honestly, any magazine, playlist, radio show, etc mean a lot to me because at the end of the day, I’m still making music from my small bedroom and never would’ve guessed that the industry would ever take notice. So to get that recognition is really great and it also validates me and my musical capabilities. It pushes me forward and motivates me further. Also, whenever an artist says that they like my music or they want to work with me, it’s a huge compliment.\n\nKALTBLUT: The London music scene seems to be a significant part of your artistic development. How has the city and its cultural dynamics influenced your approach to music?\n\nNatalie: London has definitely changed my music taste because there are such diverse sounds found here. The main thing I discovered when I moved here was a different kind of electronic music which was jungle, garage, and drum and bass. This was all new to me but I’ve always been a big fan of electronic and pop music. I just knew I had to blend it into my music.\n\nKALTBLUT: You’ve been noted for resisting stylistic categorization. How important is genre flexibility to you, and how do you navigate it in your creative process?\n\nNatalie: Honestly, I just make music and experiment a lot so by accident, I tend to blend genres a lot. I never think about what genre I’m going for but usually, it’s always within the electronic music genre. I believe that’s what I’m best at. However, I’m not opposed to trying out new things and different genres!\n\nKALTBLUT: Can you share more about your involvement with Loud LDN and how being part of a female and gender-expansive collective has impacted your music career?\n\nNatalie: I actually joined them a few months ago but haven’t been involved too much yet. I definitely need to get in touch more. I do talk to a few artists there and it’s really nice to have a community of female and non-binary artists because the industry is so male-dominated. It creates a safe space and an opportunity to make friends and meet potential collaborators.\n\nKALTBLUT: Looking forward, how do you see your sound evolving, and are there any other musical styles you are eager to explore?\n\nNatalie: I’ve been really into early 2000s pop music lately. I’d like to make some songs like Lady Gaga. Her song “Telephone” is one of my favorites. It’s just super fun pop music and I want to experiment with less sad music because a lot of my music tends to have sad undertones haha. Sometimes, I want to make some trashy club music. But then other times, I want to make super nostalgic and sad ballads.\n\nKALTBLUT: Lastly, for young artists looking up to you, what advice would you give about forging their own path in the increasingly complex music industry?"
