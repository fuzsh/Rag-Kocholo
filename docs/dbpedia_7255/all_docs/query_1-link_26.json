        "text": "I was photographing in colour for over 50 years. Occasionally I’d put a B&W film in the camera but I was still photographing in colour, there just happened to be B&W film in the camera. Of course, the results were unimpressive.\n\nFor the past couple of years I have moved to trying to tackle B&W properly. Because I’m a beginner I can probably explain my starting steps better than a seasoned expert who might find it harder to remember the process he/she went through.\n\nSo how do you ‘see’ in B&W? Simple. You can’t. And setting B&W mode on a digital camera doesn’t help. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, what are you photographing? Flowers? People? Landscapes? Architecture…? No, none of these. You’re photographing light and absence of light. A photography book I came across years ago made a big impression on me because of its title – “The Keepers of Light” (by William Crawford). Colour or B&W, we are always photographing light and absence of light. For B&W you absolutely need to change your mindset to think about light and its absence not the object you are pointing the camera at.\n\nSecond how do you meter? Do you know what your meter is doing and how to interpret the results? In my view the best meter is Sunny 16. If you can use Sunny 16 you are beginning to understand light, and know the difference between incident light and reflected light. Incident readings will make dark areas with highlights look like just that (when converted to a positive), whereas a simple reflected meter will overexpose unless you understand how to correct it.\n\nThird, choose a film and stick to it. While you are practicing use an inexpensive film (e.g. Kentmere, Foma, outdated stock) and shoot lots thinking about the first two points above. I suggest 100asa – this is fine for day or night and generally very flexible. Don’t be afraid to open your lens up to keep exposure times manageable hand held. And don’t be afraid to go to 1/15 or 1/8 second with a 50mm lens.\n\nFourth – processing your negatives [see the note below]. A hybrid process – film capture and development, digital processing of the negatives to a digital image – offers greater flexibility and ease than a purely analogue workflow. For 35mm, a digital camera and macro lens offers higher quality and is quicker than using a flatbed scanner. The scan may be a raw file which you need to interpret in software as a film negative (the software then converts to a positive), remove residual colour by clicking B&W mode, then tackle the tone curve. Note that whether your capture was on film or digital the B&W image shown will probably have a camera or software chosen tone curve – get rid of this and start with a straight line tone curve. If you make any adjustments at all generally make very minor changes (e.g. adjusting black or white points and a slight ‘S’ curve). Usually the straight line curve will be good for many situations.\n\nFinally, “seeing in B&W” is a misnomer. What you have to do is “pre-visualise” – think how the scene will appear when converted to B&W the way you want it. You will only be able to pre-visualise after taking negatives and making positives many times. It’s a learning process. It’s also surprising that often images which are nothing in colour are striking in B&W so don’t stick to your usual subject matter, experiment.\n\nThe images are from various times over the last 18 months, taken with a Pentax LX, Leica iiig, M3 or MP, on Ilford FP4 or Fomapan 100.\n\nNote on negative processing. See my articles on Rodinal (Adonal) on this site. I recommend stand development using 100:1 dilution – simple, reliable, automatically compensating for over and under-exposure. Use distilled or pre-boiled water for the final wash with only a few drops of rinse aid, and hang to dry in a still-air area.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nShare this post:"
