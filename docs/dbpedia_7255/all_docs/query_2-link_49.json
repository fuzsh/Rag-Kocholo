        "text": "So, horror is a word that comes with much bad rep. The range of bad CGI ghosts and costume- humanoid beasts are part of parcel of horror as a genre. Sad as it may be, horror in recent times has been diluted and stripped of anything but cheap jump scares and plot holes that grow bigger with every minute of wasted dialogue.\n\nDo I have some unjustified bias towards the horror genre? No–well, maybe. For the record, horror media is like buying a happy meal. You know you’re buying crap food for the reward of a plastic toy that’s probably made with the tears of child labour from China. But you still buy it anyways for the cheap thrill of getting a random toy.\n\nAnyways, that’s besides the point. I had Parasite on my radar for a while because it was not listed as PG18+ movie despite it being horror so I wondered how it would compensate for the scary factor while being relatively family friendly. I must say, Korea is dominating the media field, having both conquered music worldwide with Kpop and Kdramas and movies being hits with the crowd.\n\nWell, let’s dive right in shall we? To make up for my lack of reviews, I’ll do my best to make a worthy comeback! (spoilers ahead!)\n\n< PLOT SUMMARY>\n\nKi-woo belongs to a family of fraudsters that wallow in poverty. He manages to get a tutoring job through a recommendation from his friend and takes on a new identity as “a-basic-English-name-that-Asians-think-is-fancy-but-can’t-for-the-life-of-me-remember-it”and seduces the rich, young daughter that he was supposed to tutor. Through manipulating the naive and well-off family, Ki-woo, his sister, mother and father manages to be employed by the whole family while under false personas.\n\nWhile the family continues to be oblivious about their hired help’s true lives, Ki-woo and his family discover a dark secret hidden inside the luxurious mansion and in turn, suffers as their carefully crafted personas fall apart.\n\n<REVIEW>\n\nPlot twists. Plot twists–that are actually plot twists. Holy-balls. I was honestly not expecting the whole “people live in the walls” story line, if anything, I thought it was the “evil-housekeeper-that’s-actually-a-ghost-tied-to-the-house”. So it was an interesting choice to make the story more realistic and less tied to supernatural reasons. I appreciated it and it made the film stand out against the mass number of scary Asian movies.\n\nNow, the part that caused many to praise the film. The theme of social status and the second unexpected major plot twist. If you haven’t watched the film yet, stop here and come back after you’ve seen it because it’s really crazy. Gone? Okay so the massacre part. Yeah–you know, the part where everybody dies? I did not see that coming at all and it caught me off guard, like some sort of sudden-death battle royale situation, a total 180 from the main plot.\n\nWhat spurred on the massive death count? It was Mr Kim, the father and phony driver. He snapped after seeing the rich dad beckoning him for the keys, the disregard for his daughter who’s clearly in worse shape than the fainted son. This, along with the poor attitudes of the well-off family towards the shunned lower-class family brought on the massive rage of the father, Mr Kim.\n\nIt’s honesty, brilliant how they forshadowed the father’s incoming mental snap, small things such as the snarky attitude of the rich dad’s driving test, his comment on the musty smell on poor dad (from now on, it’ll be easier to call them poor/rich family than typing out all of the Korean name one by one). The last review I did was of Crazy Rich Asians and while the film attempted to highlight the social stigmas and status difference in modern society, I said in my review that it did not quite hit the mark for me. This film, on the other hand, did.\n\nA problem I find with modern-day films are the lack of subtlety. It’s very blatant in its message and it makes a story less real, less–how should I put it, good? Show not tell is something my teachers have always emphasised on and while this film does not drool over the theme of societal difference and the mistreatment between classes, it makes it’s point clear.\n\nThe small push-and-pull between the scenes of the fake identities of the poor family and the actual poor family, it’s jarring and so in your face that you can’t help but get scene whiplash. It just shows how fake the rich are and how easy it is to live a completely different life just by forging some documents and changing your form of speech. Really fascinating stuff.\n\nAnyways, back to the plot of the basement dwelling literal “parasites”. Parasites being creatures that take advantage of other creatures by sucking the literal life out of them. Really commend the play on words there monsieur Bong Joon-ho. When the “parasites” were revealed, I held back a chuckle. It can also be interpreted two ways with the poor family being the parasites of the rich family, the rich family being parasites of the poor family be making them bend to their wills, sucking their identity of being poor, lower-class citizens.\n\nIt’s honestly, a splendid film. I have nothing but praise. Especially to the actors and the casting. They are perfect without being too, well–plastic surgery-idol-monsters, sorry if it’s harsh but I’ve lost count of the number of ethereally beautiful leads that are apparently supposed to be “average-looking” in dramas. The cinematography is brilliant, I do enjoy the set designs and it’s not repetitive and unrealistic in dialogue, huzzah!\n\nI suppose if I had a criticism, I felt like the ending was rather abrupt. I mean, it was not too bad as compared to most shows which end it on a cliche and single note. But, I guess, it was cheeky of them to tease a happy end and instead make it a open ending. The mood was so somber and I suppose it worked in favour of the film rather than against it, still, would be nice to have more closure.\n\nAh, it seems that I’ve lost my touch in writing reviews and am going in circles yet again. Well, no matter, I’ll step up my game. Also a little self-promotion, if you’re in Singapore in January, pop by suntec. An anime convention will be held there on 4 January called Arata, I’ll be booth-ing as an artist so feel free to pop by for some sick merch."
