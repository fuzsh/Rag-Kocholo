        "text": "Gimel Vav says:\n\nConsider this color wheel from art class:\n\nLet's talk about black and white with filters over the lens first. Let's say you put an orange filter over the lens. It lets in orange and blocks out anything directly opposite from it which is blue. The closer it is to the orange, the more white it looks. The closer it is to the blue, the more black it looks. Red-Violet and Yellow-Green will both look medium grey. So, if you use an orange filter with black and white film, the sky will look dark. Clouds which are white are composed of all colors, so they will still come through white. That's how you increase the contrast of clouds against the sky when you use an orange filter with black and white film. A red filter will give you the same effect, but not as strongly.\n\nLet's say you use a red filter with black and white film. If something is red, it will look white on the film because the filter lets red light pass through. If something is green it will look black on the film because the red filter blocks green completely. Just look through a red filter at something green to verify this.\n\nNow, let's talk about black and white film with filters over the flash. Now, there is a subtle difference. You are only producing light of a certain color or combination of colors. Let's say you use a red filter over the flash and take a picture of something that's green and there is no other light source. The green thing will look black on the film because the green thing does not reflect red light and that's all you're trying to bounce of of it. Red things reflect red light, so they will be lit up and show up as white on the film. Things that are opposite the flash color on the color wheel will show up black. Things that are the same color as the flash color will show up white. The \"darker\" or \"deeper\" the color, the more selective the light will be and the less powerful it will make the flash because it's blocking out more light.\n\nIn general colored flashes don't work too well with black and white film, but colored filters over the lens - especially orange and red - are extremely useful in the daytime.\n\nages ago"
