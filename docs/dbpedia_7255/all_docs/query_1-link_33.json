Your film really has to be dead flat to scan well, and 120 is a larger surface area and therefore has a better chance of not being totally planar during the scan. I warm up my negatives and then stick them under a book or other totally flat surface with weight for a whole day.\n\nColor films are however actually less sharp than their black and white counterparts. The line pair resolution of color films is much less, likely due to their being made up of coupled dyes and the orange mask that is placed over negative films.\n\nColor negative and positive films are pretty similar in their characteristics of resolution, but it really depends on which film you are talking about.\n\nRemember, \"sharpness\" is meant to be the perceived contrast of edges of fine details throughout the image. Monochromatic silver grains can render higher resolutions than multicolored dye any day.\n\nmarkbarendt\n\nJoined\n\nMay 18, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n9,422\n\nLocation\n\nBeaverton, OR\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#3\n\nColor films are however actually less sharp than their black and white counterparts.

The Lp/mm here is about 30 at 50% contrast:\n\nhttp://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e113/e113.pdf\n\nHere's the Data sheet for portra 400, where the MTF 50 of the longest wavelength red, is also about 30-40 Lp/mm:http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e4050/e4050.pdf\n\nHere's Kodak Tri-x 400, a fairly lower resolution film among black and white films, it can still resolve about 50lp/mm at MTF 50: http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f4017/f4017.pdf\n\nOf course there are other factors such as development and what lens you ate using, but otherwise resolution is essentially a measure of perceived sharpness at MTF50.\n\nDon't expect the same fine details from even Kodachrome 64 slides as from say, Ilford FP4.\n\nThe image size will also affect perceived sharpness as the eye (or your computer screen) can only resolve so many line pairs at a specified distance. At a small enough size the same lens imaging on color and black and white films the same scene, the images will look indistinguishable in their \"sharpness\".\n\nT-Max 400 resolves about 75 Lp/mm, while t-max\n\n100 resolves about 120, and even the grainy P3200 can resolve about 75 Lp/mm at MTF 50: http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f4016/f4016.pdf\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Oct 3, 2013\n\npolyglot\n\nJoined\n\nJun 12, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n3,467\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Australia\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#6\n\nAs an overgeneralisation, yes it is true that most C41 films are softer than (some) B&W films and chromes.\n\nPractically nothing is less grainy than Acros or TMX, and nothing in ISO400 is as good as TMY2, so there's that. But then, nothing is coarser at a given ISO than Fomapan, so it depends which films you are comparing.\n\nIn my experience, Ektar is about as sharp and smooth as Velvia, maybe even better and RVP50 is the smoothest reversal film on the market, so the \"best\" C41 is smoother than the smoothest chrome. But then, the cheaper (Reala) and older (400VC) C41 films are very coarse compared to chromes of similar vintage (RDP, RXP), whereas the newer CN emulsions (New Portra in 160 and 400) are very fine. P400 is better than Reala and RXP but can't match RDP. P160 is probably as good as RDP.\n\nSo you can cut it whichever way you like really. Quantitative comparisons are also very difficult because MTF50 on the film means an entirely different thing on a negative as a positive because of the contrast gain in the printing process. A C41 neg that will achieve the same MTF50 in a print will have a lower MTF50 in the negative, which means comparing it to the MTF off a chrome is unreasonable. But then, chromes can have a higher Dmax, which means they naturally have the opportunity to get better acutance than any reflected print can achieve.\n\nJust shoot what you like. If you want to try a colour neg that looks like a chrome, get some Ektar and print it optically.

There's less you can do to control \"sharpness\" anyway with your color films. If\n\nYou want fine details, larger format, if you want relatively small prints, 35mm should be fine.\n\nPrest_400\n\nJoined\n\nJan 1, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n1,358\n\nLocation\n\nSweden\n\nFormat\n\nMed.

On screen the scans differ a lot in color (I prefer much more film) compared to digital (which I use in a more careless way, BTW; Only JPG). For me a 8x12\" print is quite big at the moment and medium speed film should fulfill nicely. Some grain doesn't hurt and it can help in acutance.\n\nSlide needs a careful approach to (hybrid) printing, as I found it loses \"crunch\" (transmittive to reflective media).\n\nI've gotten some Portra 400 to try and want to get a bit of ektar for next spring. As of products, Portra 400 has lots of praise for what it delivers, being ISO 400.

But overall, comparing apples to oranges is a waste of time.\n\nIt's not bullshit. I am aware of the other factors and that the idea of sharpnes is a subjective one to begin with. Those numbers are a useful means to understanding why color slides or negatives may appear to have less resolved detail than black and white films. I used to shoot Kodachrome long ago and was disappointed when I scanned them a couple years ago on an Imacon scanner and found their resolved details were\n\nNo match for most of my Black and white negatives. There is something to the fact that light has to travel to three layers, not counting the filter layer in color film. The MTF is useful for understanding the maximum capabilities of a film like we may know a digital cameras resolution, of course the lens resolving on that film determines how much can be revealed. There is no number crunching at all, just simple comparing of numbers to try to understand some of the different properties.\n\nAcutance of the film during processing is different than the actual resolved detail as it can alter the contrast between resolved details and the perception of sharpness can be very high. If the details are not recorded however, no amount of processing can create them, which is why I mentioned this problem of resolution/sharpness arises mostly from printing very large or scanning very high resolution and realizing the film doesn't have incredible detail after a certain size. Of course you don't take the numbers to heart and say \"well crap, I'll never shoot color again now\" because that's just stupid.\n\nNikanon\n\nJoined\n\nJul 11, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n433\n\nLocation\n\nChugwater, Wyoming\n\nFormat\n\n35mm RF\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#14\n\nI may have misunderstood the science here(quite likely) but the source you quote seems to suggest that P3200 has a resolution the same as TMax400 and is better than the colour film you give as an example.\n\nI am particularly surprised that P3200 matches Tmax400 and beats I think it was Portra you mention\n\nGood as P3200 is for a fast film my limited experience with it suggests to me that even at a 5x7 size print a P3200 neg doesn't match a TMax 400 neg\n\nWhat's others' experience of this?\n\npentaxuser\n\nAll the numbers say is that under the specified conditions, the film can resolve up to this amount of detail at this percentage of contrast. The maximum a film can resolve is at a very low contrast at the end of the curve. Likely P3200 using the developer stated is able to resolve what it can because at around 70 Lp/mm the perceived contrast Is still high enough likely due to the large grain size but the finer the recorded details go the grains become too large to differentiate anymore. T-Max 400 may not be as grainy but may have reduced ability to resolve more than P3200 due to its heavy use of tabular grain and dye.\n\nI am not saying this is why, I am just trying to reason this out. The fact exists that this film did record this detail under the set conditions although it likely wont record that much if used normally in a real world situation.\n\nmarkbarendt\n\nJoined\n\nMay 18, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n9,422\n\nLocation\n\nBeaverton, OR\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#15\n\nNikanon first I think we are comparing apples to oranges.

There are all kinds of ways of tweaking these things, and I'm not referring to digital manipulation. Sometimes a grainier film appears\n\nsharper than a fine-grained one, sometimes it doesn't. It can even depend on which dye layer of a color film is predominantly exposed. We could talk for hours and hours about this. Those of us who cut our teeth on Kodachrome 25 thought the 64 version stunk. It's all relative.\n\nBut if detail is a priority in color, take a look at Ektar.

A color neg film primarily marketed for portrait use, like Portra 160, will be engineered with fine grain but\n\nlow contrast. That can be altered to some extent by how you print it; but it behaves differently than something like Ektar, which has been\n\nengineered for a different range of potential applications, even though it belongs to the same general family by the same manufacturer. You\n\ncan take a black and white film like HP5, develop it in pyro, and it will look like utter mush under a high-powered loupe, if you compare it to\n\nTMax 100. But when you print both of them at, say a 5X magnification, the HP5 will actually seem crisper or apparently sharper. Change the\n\ndeveloper or make significantly greater scale enlargement, the effect will be different. There are just way way too many variables to make\n\ncrude generalizations.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nRichard Man\n\nJoined\n\nSep 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n1,249\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#21\n\nThe thing that got me on this is that I have shot rolls of Provia / Sensia 35mm XPan (35x66) format in the late 2000s in Japan / HK. I processed those rolls myself and I have 6 4+ feet long canvas prints hanging on my wall right now that I look at everyday. They are canvas prints so obviously we are talking about prints with texture. In any case, while I have not printed huge yet with the color films, but I just do not think the 35mm Portra 160/400 from the same camera/lens have that type of ... visual impact. The 120 and 4x5 of course do, but lets just say I am not happy with the 35mm color film and I want to know whether it's something I can tweak or I should \"give up\" on that process.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 21, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n29,845\n\nFormat\n\nHybrid\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#22\n\nso many technical conversations just boil down to subjectivecrap ..\n\ndo what you want and enjoy what you do. ...\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Oct 3, 2013\n\nDr Croubie\n\nJoined\n\nMar 21, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n1,987\n\nLocation\n\nrAdelaide\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#23\n\nThanks for all the comments.

The bit down the bottom about Monet is especially interesting, years before colour photography and computers.\n\nBut between negs and slides, no idea. I've just been scanning a very-expired Gold 400 shot on my 1/2-frame Agat 18k. Having no lightmeter, and very expired film, a lot of them were underexposed. Those had massive grain even viewing on-screen at 4x6 print-size. Others were perfectly exposed and the results looked good enough at about 8x10\" print-size.\n\nIn lab conditions, with a certain MTF/% definition of 'sharp', maybe Velvia beats most negs. Maybe Ektar even beats Velvia. but go out in the real world and shoot something else, and the results might be different. (wow, i think I've heard exactly the same thing on gear-head forums about the D800e vs D800 vs 5D3 and Zeiss lenses vs Canon's L)\n\nmarkbarendt\n\nJoined\n\nMay 18, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n9,422\n\nLocation\n\nBeaverton, OR\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nOct 3, 2013\n\n#24\n\nThe thing that got me on this is that I have shot rolls of Provia / Sensia 35mm XPan (35x66) format in the late 2000s in Japan / HK.
