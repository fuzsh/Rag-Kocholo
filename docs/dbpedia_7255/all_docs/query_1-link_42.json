        "text": "Out in the Night is a documentary that tells the story of a group of young friends, African American lesbians who are out, one hot August night in 2006, in the gay friendly neighborhood of New York City. They are all in their late teens and early twenties and come from a low-income neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. Two of the women are the focus – gender non-conforming Renata Hill, a single mother with a soft heart and keen sense of humor, and petite femme Patreese Johnson, a shy and tender poet. As they and their friends walk under the hot neon lights of tattoo parlors in the West Village, an older man sexually and violently confronts them. He says to Patreese “let me get some of that” as he points below her waist. When she says that they are gay, the man becomes violent and threatens to “fuck them straight”. He spits and throws a lit cigarette. Renata and Venice defend the group and a fight begins, captured by security cameras nearby. The man yanks out hair from Venice’s head and chokes Renata. Then, Patreese pulls a knife from her purse and swings at him. Strangers jump in to defend the women and the fight escalates. As the fight comes to an end, all get up and walk away. But 911 has been called and the man involved has been stabbed. Police swarm to the scene as their radios blast out warnings of a gang attack. The women are rounded up and charged with varying degrees of gang assault, assault and attempted murder. Three of the women plead guilty. But Renata, Patreese, Venice and friend Terrain claim their innocence. They are called a “Gang of Killer Lesbians” by the media. In activist circles they become known as The New Jersey 4.\n\ndirectors statement\n\nImmediately following the arrest of the NJ4 on August 18th, 2006, and after reading many salacious headlines, I became interested in their case. However, it was the first of many New York Times articles that really gave me pause. “Man is stabbed after admiring a stranger.” I was outraged. This was not a flirtatious interaction. It was harassment and assault.\n\nInitially, I did not set out to document this story. As a white filmmaker, I did not think I should. Instead, I focused on advocating for their legal fees and ultimate release. Yet, as time passed, media interested wanned, and with their appellate trails looming, I wanted to keep their stories centered.\n\nUnder the neon lights of the gay-friendly neighborhood of New York City, four young Black lesbians were violently and sexually threatened by a man on the street. They defend themselves and were charged and convicted in the courts and in the media as a 'Gang of Killer Lesbians'.\n\nWho has the right to defend themselves? This question is asked in Out in the Night, a documentary film that sheds light on the New Jersey 4 and how the media's prejudicial representation of these young women perpetuated harmful stereotypes and biases, leading to their wrongful incarcerations."
