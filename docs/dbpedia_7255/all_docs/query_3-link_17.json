        "text": "Finding the right film formats, film types and film sizes are some of the most challenging parts of shooting analog film as a professional photographer.\n\nThat said, the industry changes quickly, and because there are so many different kinds of photographic film for cameras that if you’re new to analog (or switching back), there can be a pretty steep learning curve.\n\nToday, I’m giving you a complete step-by-step tutorial for those new to the world of camera film. By the end of this article, you’ll know the differences between film stock types, film formats, sizes and more. Let’s get started!\n\nWhat are the most common film formats?\n\nE-6 color reversal, C-41 color negative, and black & white negative are the most common film formats. Here's more about each of them:\n\nE-6 color reversal (slide film)\n\nE-6 color reversal, also known as slide film, is a type of color film used in photography.\n\nIt is called \"reversal\" because the developed film produces a positive image directly on the film itself, which is often referred to as a \"slide\" or \"transparency.\" Unlike color negative films (such as C-41 films), which produce a negative image that needs to be further processed to obtain a positive print, slide films provide a positive image directly when developed.\n\nE-6 slide film creates a positive image on the film itself.\n\nAfter developing the film, you'll have a direct positive image that can be viewed on a lightbox or projector without the need for any additional printing or scanning. Slide films are known for producing vibrant and saturated colors, which can make your images pop and appear very visually appealing. Slide films have a lower latitude compared to color negative films, which means they are less forgiving when it comes to exposure errors.\n\nYou need to be more precise with your exposure settings to get the best results.\n\nE-6 slide films come in various ISO (film speed) ratings, just like other films. Higher ISO films are more sensitive to light and are suitable for low-light situations, but they may have more noticeable grain. The development process for E-6 slide film is different from color negative films (C-41).\n\nE-6 films require specific chemicals and processing times to produce the positive image on the film.\n\nOnce your E-6 slide film is developed, the individual frames are typically mounted in cardboard or plastic mounts, protecting them and making them easy to handle. You can view E-6 slide film images by projecting them on a screen using a slide projector. Alternatively, you can also scan the slides to convert them into digital files for sharing and printing. Slide films offer a unique look and feel, which many photographers find appealing for artistic and creative purposes.\n\nC-41 color negative film\n\nC-41 color negative film is one of the most common types of color film used in photography, and it's a great starting point for beginners.\n\nUnlike E-6 slide film, which produces a positive image directly on the film, C-41 film creates a negative image that needs to be further processed to obtain a positive print. This process allows for easy and convenient printing, scanning, and sharing of your photographs.\n\nOne of the benefits of C-41 color negative film is its forgiving nature when it comes to exposure.\n\nIt has a wide latitude, meaning it can handle a range of different lighting conditions and still produce usable results. This makes it an excellent choice for photographers who are still learning to manage their exposure settings.\n\nC-41 film is typically rated with an ISO number, indicating its sensitivity to light.\n\nLower ISO films (e.g., ISO 100) are ideal for well-lit situations, while higher ISO films (e.g., ISO 400) are better suited for low-light or fast-action scenarios. Beginners can experiment with different ISOs to understand how they affect the look of their photos.\n\nAfter shooting your C-41 film, you'll need to take it to a photo lab for processing.\n\nThe C-41 process is a standardized method used by most labs, making it widely accessible. The film is developed, and the negative images are then printed or scanned to produce positive prints or digital files.\n\nC-41 color negative film offers a versatile and approachable entry into film photography.\n\nIt provides beginners with the opportunity to experiment with various lighting conditions, compositions, and subject matters. Additionally, the ability to print or scan the negatives makes it easy to share your creations with others and delve into the world of analog photography without the complexities of slide film processing.\n\nBlack and white negative film\n\nBlack and white negative film is a classic and versatile type of film widely used in photography.\n\nUnlike color films, it captures images in various shades of gray rather than color. This simplicity allows beginners to focus on fundamental aspects of photography, such as composition, lighting, and texture, without the distraction of color.\n\nBlack and white negative film comes in different ISO ratings, just like color films.\n\nLower ISO films, such as ISO 100 or 200, are ideal for well-lit situations and offer fine-grained results. On the other hand, higher ISO films, like ISO 400 or 800, are more sensitive to light and are suitable for low-light conditions or faster shutter speeds.\n\nDeveloping black and white film is relatively straightforward compared to color film.\n\nMany photographers enjoy the hands-on experience of developing their film in a darkroom, which adds a creative and tactile element to the process. However, if you don't have access to a darkroom, you can still get your film processed at a professional lab.\n\nBlack and white film allows you to emphasize contrast and highlight the textures in your images.\n\nThe absence of color can lead to striking and dramatic photographs, making it an excellent choice for various artistic expressions. It also offers more forgiving latitude in exposure, giving beginners some room for experimentation and learning.\n\nWorking with black and white negative film can be a rewarding experience, teaching beginners essential photographic principles while offering artistic freedom.\n\nIt's an excellent way to develop a deeper understanding of composition, lighting, and the nuances of capturing moments in grayscale.\n\nWhether you're interested in street photography, portraiture, or landscapes, black and white film provides a classic and timeless medium to express your creativity.\n\nFilm Formats & Sizes\n\n135 (35mm) standard format\n\n135 film, also known as 35mm film, is a popular and widely used film format in photography.\n\nIt consists of a strip of light-sensitive celluloid, typically 35mm wide, with perforations along the edges for precise feeding in cameras. This film format is versatile and accessible, available in various types such as color negative, black and white, and color slide films. 135 film is used in 35mm film cameras, which are common among both amateur and professional photographers.\n\nAfter capturing images on the film, it needs to be developed, and the negatives can be printed or scanned to produce physical prints or digital files.\n\nThe 135 format has played a crucial role in the history of photography, making it a timeless and widely cherished medium for capturing moments and artistic expressions.\n\n126 film\n\n126 film, also known as Instamatic film, is a cartridge-based film format introduced by Kodak in 1963.\n\nIt gained popularity for its ease of use, making photography more accessible to the masses. The film is enclosed in a plastic cartridge, which simplified loading and unloading in cameras, eliminating the need to handle the film directly. The format used square frames, and the images were typically 28mm x 28mm in size.\n\nHowever, despite its initial popularity, 126 film eventually declined in usage and was discontinued by most manufacturers by the 1990s.\n\n828 film\n\n828 film was a film format introduced by Kodak in 1935 as an alternative to standard 35mm film.\n\nIt was designed for use in the Kodak Bantam camera and produced larger negatives measuring 40mm x 28mm, which were slightly larger than those from 35mm film. The film came in specially designed metal spools, making it easy to load and use in the camera. Despite its advantages, 828 film faced challenges as it was incompatible with regular 35mm film cameras and processing equipment.\n\nAs a result, the format declined in popularity and was eventually discontinued by Kodak in the 1980s.\n\nMedium format film\n\n120 film\n\n120 film is a medium-format film used in photography, known for producing higher-resolution images compared to 35mm film.\n\nIt comes in a roll, and the film is 61mm wide, offering various frame sizes depending on the camera used. Common frame sizes include 6x4.5cm, 6x6cm, 6x7cm, and 6x9cm, among others. The larger negative size of 120 film allows for greater detail, smoother tonal transitions, and better image quality, making it popular among professional and advanced amateur photographers.\n\nThe film is loaded into cameras that support medium-format photography, and after capturing images, the roll needs to be developed by a specialized photo lab or by using home development methods.\n\nDespite the rise of digital photography, 120 film remains cherished for its distinct and nostalgic quality, attracting artists and enthusiasts who appreciate the unique characteristics of analog photography.\n\n220 film\n\n220 film is a medium-format film that shares similarities with 120 film but has double the film length, allowing for twice as many exposures without the need to change the film spool.\n\nUnlike 120 film, which typically provides 12 or 16 exposures, 220 film offers 24 or 32 exposures, making it ideal for photographers who want to maximize their shooting capacity. However, because of its longer length, 220 film requires cameras with specific film backs designed to accommodate the larger number of frames. Despite its advantages in terms of increased shots per roll, the popularity of 220 film has diminished over time, and its availability has become limited compared to 120 film.\n\nNevertheless, it remains a sought-after option for photographers who appreciate the convenience of extended shooting sessions without interruptions for film changes.\n\n620 film\n\n620 film was a type of roll film used in photography, first introduced by Kodak in 1932.\n\nIt is essentially the same as 120 film in terms of image size and format, but it comes on a slightly different spool with a smaller diameter. The film's width is 61mm, and it offers various frame sizes depending on the camera used, including 6x4.5cm, 6x6cm, 6x7cm, and 6x9cm, among others. The primary difference between 620 and 120 film is the spool size, which means that 620 film is not directly compatible with cameras designed for 120 film.\n\nHowever, with some slight modifications or adapters, 120 film can be used in cameras originally meant for 620 film.\n\nOver time, the popularity of 620 film declined, and it was eventually discontinued by Kodak in the 1990s.\n\nLarge format film\n\nLarge format film is a type of photographic film that is significantly larger in size compared to smaller formats like 35mm or medium format.\n\nIt is commonly used in large format cameras, which range from 4x5 inches to even larger formats like 8x10 inches or beyond. The large negative size allows for unparalleled image detail, sharpness, and tonal range, making it a preferred choice for professional photographers, fine art photography, and specialized applications like architectural and landscape photography. Large format cameras offer extensive control over perspective and focus, using movements such as tilt, shift, and swing, allowing photographers to manipulate depth of field and correct distortion.\n\nThough large format photography requires careful consideration, time, and skill, the results can be breathtakingly beautiful and stand out for their exceptional image quality and artistic expression.\n\nFilm Formats & Sizes\n\n135 (35mm) standard format\n\n135 film, also known as 35mm film, is a popular and widely used film format in photography.\n\nIt consists of a strip of light-sensitive celluloid, typically 35mm wide, with perforations along the edges for precise feeding in cameras.

A lower ISO value indicates lower sensitivity to light, while a higher ISO value implies higher sensitivity. When shooting in low-light conditions or situations that require faster shutter speeds, increasing the ISO can help capture properly exposed images. However, higher ISO settings may introduce more noise or grain in the image, while lower ISO settings provide cleaner and smoother results.\n\nSelecting the appropriate ISO setting is essential for achieving well-exposed and high-quality photographs, as it directly influences the exposure and overall image appearance.\n\nFilm Grain\n\nFilm grain refers to the visible texture or granular appearance that can be seen in photographs taken on film.\n\nIt occurs because of the way light interacts with the light-sensitive grains in the film emulsion during the development process. Higher film speeds (ISO) and underexposure can intensify the grain, while lower film speeds and proper exposure tend to produce finer grain or a smoother appearance. Film grain can add a distinct and artistic quality to images, evoking a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, and it's often favored by photographers seeking a vintage or classic look in their work.\n\nHowever, in some cases, excessive grain can be considered undesirable, particularly in situations where high image clarity and sharpness are essential.\n\nUnderstanding film grain allows photographers to make intentional choices about its presence and influence on the overall aesthetics of their photographs.\n\nColor Balance\n\nColor balance refers to the distribution of colors in an image, ensuring that the white and neutral tones appear natural and without any unwanted color casts.\n\nIn photography, it's essential to achieve accurate color balance to represent the true colors of the scene as perceived by the human eye. Proper color balance is influenced by the color temperature of the light source and the type of film or white balance settings on digital cameras. Adjusting the color balance involves fine-tuning the levels of red, green, and blue channels to create a neutral and balanced representation of colors.\n\nA well-balanced image looks visually pleasing and true-to-life, while an improper color balance can lead to unrealistic or unappealing color shifts that may require post-processing adjustments to correct.\n\nMastering color balance allows photographers to convey their intended mood and atmosphere while accurately capturing the essence of the subject in their photographs.\n\nContrast\n\nContrast in photography refers to the difference between the brightest and darkest areas of an image.\n\nIt is a critical element in shaping the visual impact and mood of a photograph. High contrast images have a significant difference between light and dark areas, resulting in strong shadows, deep blacks, and bright highlights, which can create a dramatic and dynamic effect. On the other hand, low contrast images have minimal differences between light and dark areas, often leading to a softer, more subdued appearance.\n\nPhotographers can control contrast through various factors, including lighting conditions, exposure settings, and post-processing techniques.\n\nUnderstanding and using contrast effectively enables photographers to emphasize certain elements, add depth and dimension to their images, and create striking compositions that evoke different emotions and visual experiences.\n\nLatitude\n\nLatitude refers to the ability of a film or digital sensor to capture a wide range of tones, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights, without losing detail or becoming overexposed.\n\nA camera with good latitude can handle a wide variety of lighting conditions, providing flexibility for the photographer to expose a scene correctly and still achieve a well-balanced image. High latitude is desirable in situations with challenging lighting, such as high-contrast scenes or situations where the exposure needs to be adjusted on the fly. Understanding the latitude of your camera or film allows you to make informed decisions about exposure settings, ensuring that you capture the full range of details in your photographs and have more flexibility in post-processing to fine-tune the final image.\n\nFilm base\n\nIn photography, film base refers to the material on which the light-sensitive emulsion is coated to create photographic film.\n\nThe film base provides support and stability to the emulsion, allowing it to be handled and processed. It plays a crucial role in determining the physical characteristics of the film, such as its flexibility, transparency, and durability. The two main types of film bases are cellulose acetate (commonly known as safety film) and polyester (often referred to as PET or Mylar). Cellulose acetate was widely used in older films but has largely been replaced by polyester, which is more stable and resistant to degradation over time.\n\nFilm base, together with the emulsion, influences the overall quality and longevity of the film, making it an essential consideration in the production and preservation of photographic film.\n\nFilm processing basics\n\nHow film is processed\n\nFilm processing is the method of developing exposed photographic film to produce negatives or positives that contain the captured images.\n\nThe process typically involves several steps: first, the film is loaded onto a developing reel in complete darkness to protect it from light. It is then moved through a series of chemical baths, which vary depending on the type of film being processed. These chemicals work to develop the latent image captured on the film, bringing out the tones and details.\n\nAfter the development is complete, the film is rinsed to remove any residual chemicals, followed by fixing to make the image permanent and stable.\n\nThe final step is washing the film thoroughly to ensure it is free from any remaining chemicals. Once the film is processed, it can be either printed in the darkroom or scanned to create digital files, allowing the captured images to be viewed, shared, and preserved.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, exploring the world of analog film photography opens up a realm of creativity and artistic expression for beginners.\n\nUnderstanding the various film types and formats, such as color negative, black and white, slide films, and the classic 35mm, medium format, and large format, empowers photographers to make informed choices that suit their artistic vision and shooting preferences. Each film type brings its unique characteristics, from the vibrant colors of C-41 films to the timeless elegance of black and white. Embracing the distinct qualities of film and experiencing the tactile process of shooting and developing offers a rewarding journey for photographers seeking to create evocative and authentic images.\n\nAs you embark on this analog adventure, embrace the learning process, experiment, and let the magic of film unfold before your lens, reminding us of the beauty in simplicity and the artistry in each frame."
