So here is the Idea.\n\nI would like the folks who do or have done it name the color films they prefer to convert to B&W and show an example and tell us why you prefer this film over others you have done this with.\n\nAll conversation of WHY? can stay out of this The why is because I know a majority scan here and converting to B&W from Color films can sometimes be better aesthetically from the original.\n\nWork flows and software you use and how you use it is welcome.\n\nAs always keep it professional and please no fighting. You can disagree and explain why but no name calling\n\nOriginally posted at 7:07PM, 4 March 2015 PDT\n\ninetjoker edited this topic 115 months ago.\n\nAlan Klein 100 says:\n\nI use Lightroom to convert color to BW as you can darken or lighten major groups of colors. ie. Orange, Yellow, Red, Blue, etc. I could use Portra. But I think using Velvia allows me the choice of using color that \"pops\" as well. I don't particularly care for Portra when shooting landscapes. For scanning, I use an Epson V600 ansd scan flat doing all adjustments in post with Lightroom. I also started shooting BW film because I thought it would be interesting to see the differences with converting color to BW.\n\nHere's conversion using Velvia 50.\n\n115 months ago\n\nBurnt Umber says:\n\nI don't have a favorite film but if i did, it would probably be any E-6. I like the tight almost non existent grain which gets me closer to Scala than any other B&W film processed as a positive.\n\nCan't post examples here because they are all of naked people, and that is a flickr no/no which makes me sad.\n\n115 months ago\n\nBurnt Umber says:\n\nFuji NPH-400\n\nOne last Ektar 100:\n\nAs for workflow I scan with either a Nikon Coolscan V ED for 35mm which is totally badass-a-saurus, or a Epson v500 which is terribly average. I scan everything as a TIFF format at 4000DPI for the Nikon of 4800DPI for the Epson. I scan with no adjustments at the point of scanning and i use the scanner supplied software. Only \"adjustment\" is running Digital ICE\n\nI run PS-6 with the Google Silver Efex Pro addon. I rarely if ever accept any of the presets but use them as a base to work with.\n\nOriginally posted 115 months ago.\n\nBurnt Umber edited this topic 115 months ago.\n\nRichard Wintle says:\n\nI used to really like Fuji Superia Reala in 120... sadly no longer produced. I think I only B&W converted it on one occasion but I was very pleased with the results. Although, looking at it now, I think I should have pushed the white point farther towards pure white.\n\nA colour photo from the same occasion looked like this:\n\nConversion was using the B&W conversion option in Photoshop CS4. By far the best method for me, allowing tweaking of individual colour channels. Lightroom, Camera Raw, and even Photoshop Elements (to a degree) allow for similar control. The colour exposures were scanned by the lab on a Noritsu Koki minilab but if I were doing it now I would use my Epson V550.\n\nOriginally posted 115 months ago.\n\nRichard Wintle edited this topic 115 months ago.\n\nBeccaG says:\n\nIf you're using an older version of photoshop that doesn't have the black and white conversion tool (which if I recall came into being on CS2 or 3) then the channel mixer is a decent way of converting colour images to black and white.\n\nHere is a tutorial, but there are a ton more on the internet.\n\nwww.photoshopessentials.com/photo-editing/black-and-white...\n\nBut my own word of advice (and that of others that convert colour to b/w often) is make the colour version the best you can possibly get it prior to conversion, whether that be in camera or post processing. If the colour version doesn't have decent highlights, shadows, contrast, and a range of tones then a conversion probably isn't going to save it, although... YMMV.\n\nPersonally I tend to only convert digital images, but I have converted a colour film shot once - it was portra 160NC and would have been converted using Nik Effect or the black and white tool in photoshop.\n\nOriginally posted 115 months ago.\n\nBeccaG edited this topic 115 months ago.\n\nsteve-jack says:\n\nSome really nice shots so far, Becca I especially love that shot of yours.\n\nI don't usually look to convert a colour shot to B&W but not because I see anything wrong in doing so. Its just I have probably taken the shot considering the colour in the scene and I also only have one film back so I go with whatever film I have loaded. I find when I have loaded a B&W film I have to just keep walking as I have yet to really see the world in monotone.\n\nFuji provia 400, scanned in colour and using the scan software on the Epson V500 adjusting the colour saturation as far as it not becoming blocky. Then a custom tweak of the B&W sliders in photoshop to emulate ir\n\nFuji provia 100f using a similar technique\n\nagain fuji provia 400 and only converted to B&W to try and save a bad exposure\n\nI had a look for others and it appears I have converted ektar to B&W but I prefer the original colour version.\n\nSo without consciously thinking about it, fuji provia lends itself to B&W\n\n115 months ago\n\nRichard Wintle says:\n\nPossibly relevant... in perusing Greg Heisler's \"50 Portraits\" book, which has detailed notes at the end about cameras, film, exposures, lighting and so forth, I found that a few of his very strong B&W portraits had in fact been shot on colour film. I guess he printed them in B&W. In fact I think some of them might have been on colour slide film... so duplicating them in B&W perhaps? Unfortunately details of that part of the process are lacking.\n\n115 months ago\n\nCircles_of_Confusions☯ says:\n\nYose Rizal (rizalflex):\n\nEh! is right! :) You are right. B&W film has way better density range. I think what they are saying is color film allows them to get shadow detail and highlights they like? So, 'better' for them when shooting color films in how it looks to them, compared to when shooting B&W. BUT, exposure is very different for B&W and if done like color film, you have lost a lot of density of B&W film... yes?\n\nI'm listening and watching this video right now to learn and understand why B&W has greater density (I should use the term 'Tonal Scale' I think?) than color film: Video Link\n\nP.S. Do B&W films have more tonal scale than color films? I mean, can one get greater tonal range from a color negative without having to do special exposure and processing? And, if I do the special exposure and processing for B&W, would I end up with more tonal scale, given the same scene?\n\nOriginally posted 115 months ago.\n\nCircles_of_Confusions☯ edited this topic 115 months ago.\n\njpr_me says:\n\nThis thread made me just go back for something I could quickly turn into BW from a negative that I'd never seen or used before. It was shot on Kodacolor Gold 100 at Highgate, Vermont, June 15, 1995, and shows the crowd at one of the last Grateful Dead shows running into the air field seconds after the fence had been crashed. So many people got in this way that the Dead made it a free show several minutes later. Converted to BW in Lightroom.\n\n[ ]\n\nOriginally posted 114 months ago.\n\njpr_me (a group admin) edited this topic 114 months ago.\n\nFelim O says:\n\nI have been found out :o\n\nJust a quick background to the online listings. To keep our C41 processor running I needed a steady supply of films to process, basically to keep things ticking over. The amount of films coming through the mini lab door could fluctuate I thought it time to expand onto the internet.\n\nMy local population is 58K and the whole of rep of Ireland is 4.5 million. BUT our neighbour the UK has 64 million so where better to advertise than on ebay UK, And guess what, in the last year it has been a big success. Fuji laughted at me when I told them but then had a sharp intake of breath when I showed then the figures. All the better that the prices are in pound Sterling.\n\nThe result is that we are very busy with film processing C41, cross processing and B&W.\n\nThe free postage means I am restricted to EU.\n\n114 months ago\n\nif.photons.were.grey says:\n\nBeccaG:\n\nThis shot is so great, and yet mildly disturbing somehow.\n\nAnyway, on the main question, and along the lines of what Becca said, I'm no expert, but I would have thought it's more about the data that you've got, rather than which film that works well... Converting to LAB color in PS and checking the luminence channel shows how the different colors are separated by intensity. If you don't have it roughly right there, I would think it wouldn't look good, no matter what the film. So that would depend on what you photographed and how you exposed it.\n\nHaving said that, I haven't been able to get the same look by conversion as I get out of the box with Caffenol and TMAX though.\n\n114 months ago\n\nkraig7777 says:\n\nExcept for a few really great looking exceptions here what I'm seeing are muddy looking blacks with no detail, same as I see in most digital b&w conversions.\n\nI only have to ask why because, if you can't do your own b&w processing then how do you do your own color processing? Where I live I have to send everything out now, b&w and color, or learn how to start processing myself (I'm on a tragically low budget right now, maybe soon I won't be *fingers crossed*).\n\n113 months ago"
