        "text": "“If These Walls Could Talk” is returning to the small screen. HBO will air the groundbreaking, Emmy-nominated abortion drama December 9 at at 8:00 p.m. ET. The film will also be available to stream for the first time on HBO Max.\n\nDirected by Cher and Nancy Savoca, “If These Walls Could Talk” explores abortion through three stories set in 1952, 1974, and 1996. Its cast includes Demi Moore, Sissy Spacek, and Anne Heche. Each segment follows a woman dealing with an unplanned pregnancy.\n\n“If These Walls Could Talk” made its world premiere at the Toronto international Film Festival in 1996 and aired on HBO later that year in a “landmark high for HBO female viewership,” per a press release from the network.\n\n“We are so grateful to HBO for allowing us to make this film and the conversations it inspired in 1996,” said Suzanne Todd, who exec produced the film with Moore. “HBO Max making it available to a new generation of audiences will hopefully once again bring attention to the issue of women’s healthcare.” This topic remains as timely as ever in wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade earlier this year.\n\nCheck out a new trailer for “If These Walls Could Talk” below."
