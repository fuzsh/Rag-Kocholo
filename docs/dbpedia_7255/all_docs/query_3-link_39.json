        "text": "One of the most rewarding feelings as a color film photographer is finally seeing your film after sending it out to be developed. The anticipation kills me every time. Sometimes I send out as many as ten rolls, not knowing what each roll contains, and coming back surprised.\n\nIf you are interested (or a beginner) in film photography, this is your sign to pick a film camera and get started! Any 35mm camera will do to begin your color film journey. My favorite starter cameras are the Pentax K1000 or Nikon N65 (if you want something with more automatic settings).\n\nNow that you have your camera, have you ever thought about how we got to the photography we experience today? Many of us take for granted the fact that we see color in our photographs. But the history of how color film came about was a very long process. It took many inventors and visionaries to figure out how to bring the colors we see in reality to a photograph.\n\nThe History of Color Film\n\nWhen was color photography first invented?\n\nColor first appeared in photographs through hand-coloring around 1851. Photographers hired trained painters to paint their black-and-white images. A valuable aspect of this collaboration was that it employed painters at a time when they felt threatened by photography. However, this process didn’t completely satisfy consumers. The colors were far from accurate and couldn’t depict the true colors of nature that everyone desired.\n\nAbout a decade later, in 1861, physicist James Clark Maxwell ran an experiment to show that you could create all colors from a mixture of red, green, and blue light. He would make three lantern slides, each equipped with the same color filter he created the image from. Superimposed together, they make a recognizable reproduction of what one sees through the camera.\n\nNot long after, Louis Ducos du Hauron came into the picture. He created a method that combined colored pigments instead of light. Using three black and white negatives, Hauron made three images taken through a red, green, and blue filter. He would then dye them separately in the same color. When combined, they would create a color photograph. This method led the way to the current idea of color processes.\n\nIn the 1890s, the first process of color photography based on Maxwell’s theory came about called Autochrome. Invented by brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere, this process combined the filter screens (red, green, and blue) and emulsion on the same glass support. Before, those two processes were kept separate. It became the first usable and commercially successful screen process. Autochrome plates were very simple to use, however, exposure times were substantially long. On bright, sunny days exposure times would still be at least one second long, and on cloudy days, around 10 seconds or more. Even in well-lit studios, the subject could be sitting for at least 30 seconds.\n\nAfter Autochrome, many other types of processes followed. A notable film process that gained popularity was Dufaycolor. It first appeared in 1932 as a 16mm cine film and then in 1935 as a roll film. Unlike Autochrome, Dufaycolor appealed to consumers for its fast exposure times and the ability to capture that snapshot moment. It was one of the last screen processes and remained on the market until 1951.\n\nAt this point, all of the color processes were additive. Meaning it relied on adding together red, green, and blue light. However, the film we know and use today uses a subtractive color process, adding cyan, magenta, and yellow together. Invented by Louis Ducos du Hauron, his process used colored dyes or pigments rather than filters. The colors cyan, magenta, and yellow absorb one of the primary colors (red, green, and blue). Cyan absorbs red light, reflecting a mixture of blue and green light, while magenta absorbs green light and yellow absorbs blue light. By superimposing these three complementary colors, Hauron achieved accurately represented colors. This process removed the long exposure times and dense transparencies used in the additive process.\n\nAround the early 1920s, we started to get closer to current-day color film: Kodachrome. Invented by Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky (with the help of Kodak director Dr. C.E. Kenneth Mees), Kodachrome essentially was a black-and-white film where color dyes were added during the development process. Though this brought us closer to the final solution, the development process was pervasive and took 28 stages of development, dying, and bleaching. So though it was a big step for color film, it was not quite there.\n\nFinally, we arrive at one of our final processes: Agfacolor-Neu. Created in 1936 by the German company Agfa, it anchored the color couplers to the individual emulsion layers of the film. This process allowed for home processing, unlike Kodachrome. The details of this color photographic process became widely available after WWII. Other photography companies obtained them, creating their versions of the film process. With the perfection of dye-based multi-layer color films, a brand-new era of color photography came about. This process has developed into what we see today.\n\nYou can read more in-depth about color film history here\n\nColor Film Today\n\nPresent day, there are many different types of color film to choose from with exceptional quality. Film also comes in various formats, including 35mm, 120mm, 4x5 sheet film, 8x10 sheet film, and a few other obscure sizes. With so many film options available, selecting which one fits your style can be difficult. Throughout my photography career, I have used a variety of color film stocks.\n\nBelow are my top 5 color film stocks on the market that I think you should use.\n\nBut first…what do 35mm, 120mm, and 4x5 mean?\n\n35mm Film: Meaning 35 millimeters (in size), it is a common type of roll film widely used by hobbyists, and emerging and professional photographers. 35mm film is the standard for film photography.\n\n120mm Film: Also called medium format, 120mm is similar to 35mm but bigger, measuring 120 millimeters. This film is more widely used by emerging and professional photographers and offers finer grain, sharper images, and more information. A larger film size allows your photograph to accept more information and light.\n\n4x5 Film: 4x5 sheet film, and other large format films, differ from 35mm and 120mm. While the other two are on rolls, large format film comes in sheets. Meaning, every image has to be loaded into the camera versus being able to shoot consistently on a roll. The benefit of this film is that it offers a remarkable amount of detail and sharpness to images. With the film being 4x5 inches, you get a considerably larger image. While this format is not the most popular among mainstream photographers, many fine art professionals and emerging photographers (like me) still photograph with it.\n\nTop 5 Color Negative Films To Try Today:\n\nNote: All photographic examples below are mine!
