        "text": "21 Jump Street (2012), directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, was released in March 2012 and quickly became the new “must-see” comedy. The film is actually an action/comedy and has many of the aesthetics and visual components of a classic comedy and an action film. Comedies are known for having high-key, low contrast lighting. This eliminates most shadows and keeps the focus on the characters, and not on creating visual complexity. The lighting stays consistent throughout most of 21 Jump Street, even when there is a change in the time of day or tone. For example, the tone changes from light/comical to suspenseful quite often in 21 Jump Street, but the light remains even and the shadows filled in. The film stays appropriate to the tone not by lighting but by other film components, such as the music or the pace of the editing. The editing style stays true to both the comedy genre and the action genre. During a scene that is meant to push the narrative forward or has the specific purpose of displaying an actor’s comedic skills, the shot only changes or cuts when necessary. The editing pace is slow and stays focused on the characters, for the dialogue and physical comedy is what the filmmaker wants the audience to pay attention to. Action films are known to have fast paced editing and quick shots. This is in order to built tension and suspense, along with displaying the chaos of the action. The action scenes in 21 Jump Street apply themselves to this editing style. When the action picks up in a scene, the shots get noticeably shorter and the editing pace gets much faster. The editing style can cater to both comedy and action in a scene as well. A great example of this is when Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are cops on park duty. They spot one of the most notorious drug gangs in the parking lot and decide to make their first bust. The suspense rises as they jump onto their bikes and speed off toward the biker gang. The editing, along with the depth perspective (which affects the perceived speed of movement), makes the two cops seem as if they are going incredibly fast on their bikes. The shot cuts away and then back again, revealing that Schmidt and Jenko are actually peddling at an average to slow pace. In the second shot, there was no cut aways to different angles or quick pace editing, but one single camera movement following them. The depth perspective also changes and the shot becomes much more compressed. The first shot lends itself to the visual markers of an action film, while the second shot lends itself to the visual markers of a comedy film. The change between the two shots adds to the humor of the situation. The costumes in a comedy are usually kept simple. They have to reflect the character’s personality but also don’t want to overshadow it. There are some cases in which the costume is used as part of the joke. A lot can be found out about Schmidt and Jenko by the way they wear their police uniforms. They have the same exact uniforms, which consists of black knee-length shorts and a black polo (covered with police badges, their name, etc.). Jenko wears his polo with the collar popped, signifying his cockiness and lack of respect for the uniform. It is also tight to his body, showing off his fit physique. Schmidt wears his collar down and the polo buttoned up almost all the way. An audience can gather from this that he takes his position as a cop very seriously. The uniform is also much baggier on Schmidt, putting emphasis on the fact that his body is not as fit as Jenko’s. Schmidt’s costume in the very first scene of the film is an example of the costume used for comedy sake. He walks into the High School in a large white t-shirt, baggy jeans, a gold chain, braces, and bleach white hair. It not only introduces Schmidt as “the nerd” but the Eminem wardrobe knockoff also aims to get a laugh from the audience. The film is set in the present and had a budget of $42,000,000. Most of the film is aesthetically simple, as comedies generally are, so it can be assumed that most of the technical budget went toward the action scenes and special effects. The filmmakers very successfully used the visual design in 21 Jump Street to switch between the comedy and action scenes in the film. Even more effective was the visual design’s ability to unnoticeably and successfully blend the two genres when needed.\n\n(Note: Screening Blog #1 was written on 80 Blocks from Tiffany’s. I watched the film in my Culture and the Moving Image class at the Gish theater.)\n\nGary Weis’ documentary, 80 Blocks from Tiffany’s (1979), follows several different gangs, former gang members, and police officers to discover what it is to live in the Bronx in the late seventies. In the first few scenes of the film, color doesn’t make itself extremely noticable. The camera sweeping over New York City, with frames and frames of deep space, are what first catch your eye. But after the grand opening, things become more personal. During the interviews with a few different gang members is when you first notice color. When your eye catches the deep red-orange t-shirt one gang leader is wearing, you then realize there had been a lack of color in the previous scenes. The city is bland and made up of mostly greys, blacks, whites, and washed out blues. This gives the location and area a mood and the film a particular tone. The area is rough, poor, in distress, and living at the bottom of the social-class system in NYC. The lack of color helps represent this. As a result, when colors do show up the contrast can’t be missed. In one particular scene, every gang member is wearing either black or white, while the president of the gang is in red. This draws your eye to him, makes him stand out among the others, and also adds to his intimidating domineer. Color becomes even more prevalent as the film goes on. The colors show up primarily in the gangs’ hideouts. There is a bright blue colored wall, covered with vibrant posters. The posters, painting, and art contain bright yellows, reds, greens, and blues. With men sitting in black and white in front of these walls, the colors fill up the room. Graffiti on the the plain brick walls outside also create an amazing and beautiful contrast. It symbolizing the gangs of the city, which adds irony to its allure and artistry. The colors become an important part of the film because they represent the culture and liveliness of the gangs. Their presence is well known in the city and it becomes recognizable in the film due to these contrasts in color. The color not only distinguishes the gangs from the other elements in the documentary, but sets a specific tone for each different location shown. The culture and style of the world of the gangs are brought to life by the colors and help the audience to better understand their story."
