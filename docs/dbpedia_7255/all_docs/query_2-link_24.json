        "text": "<poem> Mother Superior: Outside, life's a mess. No one's pure of spirit any longer. There's no wrong or right, just wrong and wronger People have amused themselves to death.\n\nOutside, life is grim. Filled with smut and scandal to the brim. I suppose there may be room for Him - Frankly, I don't plan to hold my breath.\n\nBut here within these walls, Days are filled with grace. God is in his place, His wisdom still respected. Here within these walls, Life has a different pace From life beyond our doors. And for what it's worth, This life's now yours!\n\n[...]\n\nOutside all is vice. People now are absolutely shameless. Most, including those who shall be nameless. Hardly seem to know or even care.\n\nOutside, all is sin. And I won't have the outside coming in. Trust me, it's a battle you won't win - Frankly, dear, you haven't got a prayer.\n\n[...]\n\nSo put aside your gluttony! Put aside your pride! As for carnal lust, You need a break, I trust. Put it all aside! Put aside intemperance! Profanity as well! Put aside each remnant of your former worldly shell.\n\nMother Superior: Here within these walls, (Ave)\n\nDeloris: (Christ on a stick, what holy mess)\n\nMother Superior: All is stripped away.\n\nDeloris: (Look at this huge freakin' penguin dress)\n\nMother Superior: Surrender and obey, (Maria)\n\nDeloris: (Look at this place, this is Hell I guess)\n\nMother Superior: That's all that is expected.\n\nDeloris: (So un-fabulous baby)\n\nMother Superior: Here within these walls, (gratia)\n\nDeloris: (Stuck in this dump with that Jesus freak)\n\nMother Superior: All else is kept at bay.\n\nDeloris: (There ain't no way that I'll last a week)\n\nMother Superior: Through the world may go astray, (plena)\n\nDeloris: (I'm too fabulous baby)\n\nMother Superior: Here eternal truths hold sway.\n\nMother Superior: Here within these walls, (Salve Regina) Life is truly blessed! (Mater misericordiae) Here you're God's own guest (vita, dulcedo) celestially protected.(et spes nostra salve).\n\nHere within these walls, All's for the very best, And always shall be thus And if heaven's will be done, Here she'll just be one more nun, (Salve Regina) Safe within these walls as one of us!\n\n(salve, salve, amen.)"
