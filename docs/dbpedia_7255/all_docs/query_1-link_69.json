The capital was a simple circular form, with some mouldings, under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions, but later more restrained. Above a plain architrave, the complexity comes in the frieze, where the two features, the triglyph and guttae, are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples. In stone they are purely ornamental.\n\nDormer Window: A perpendicular window located in a sloping roof; triangular walls join the window to the roof. Dormer windows are sometimes crowned with pediments, and they often light attic sleeping rooms; “dormer” derives from “dormir,” French for “to sleep.”\n\nDouble Doors: Two adjacent doors that share the same door frame, and between which there is no separating vertical member. Double doors are often referred to as “French doors”, due to their preponderance in French architecture.\n\nDraughting/Drafting: Technical drawing process used to create a plan to build a set.\n\nEaves: The projecting edge of a roof that overhangs an exterior wall to protect it from the rain.\n\nEclectic or Eclecticism: A mixing of various architectural styles and ornamentation of the past and present\n\nElevation View: Architectural drawing of a view of the vertical planes of the set showing their relationship to each other.\n\nExploded View: A view of a set, piece of furniture, prop, graphic, or product with all its components separated, usually to show how it is assembled.\n\nExposed Rafters: Rafters that are exposed to the outside of a building. Rafters are the inclined, sloping framing members of a roof, and to which the roof covering is affixed.\n\nFacade: An exterior wall, or face, of a building or set. The front facade of a building or set contains the main entrance, the rear facade is the rear exterior wall, and the side facades are the side exterior walls.\n\nFinial: Ornament at the top of a spire or roof.\n\nFinish: An architectural finish is a standard finish characterized by a uniformly good appearance. This finish is most often specified for “exposed” surfaces. Often times we are not using a proper architectural material to finish a surface in the film industry. For example, the paint department might be directed to ‘finish’ a wall or flat/flattage as steel or wood.\n\nFloor Plan: The architectural blueprint of the arrangement of rooms in a building or film set.\n\nGimbal: The mechanism used to spin or rotate a room, set, or scenery piece on set. This device cradles an object allowing it to be steady even though what is beneath it is unsteady.\n\nHardware: The metal fittings of a building, such as locks, latches, hinges, handles, and knobs.\n\nJoinery: Woodworking joints in carpentry.\n\nMasonry: Being of stone, brick, or concrete.\n\nMatte: A flat, not glossy finish.\n\nMezzanine: Intermediate level between a floor and ceiling that occupies a partial area of the floor space.\n\nMillwork: Interior wood finish components of a building or set, including cabinetry, windows, doors, moldings, and stairs.\n\nModel: A three-dimensional reproduction of an object used in a film. Also a three-dimensional representation of a set used in preproduction.\n\nMoulding: A strip of wood, plaster, or other material with an ornamental profile.\n\nMullions: The structural units that divide adjacent windows.\n\nNTS: Stands for Not To Scale which is labelled on drawings when a drawing is not drawn perfectly to scale.\n\nPanel: A smooth surface, usually rectangular (or sometimes circular) in shape and framed by a molding, and often featuring decorative, sculptural carving.\n\nPanelling: A millwork wall covering constructed from rigid or semi-rigid components. These are traditionally interlocking wood, but could be plastic or other materials. Panelling was developed in antiquity to make rooms in stone buildings more comfortable. The panels served to insulate the room from the cold stone.\n\nPartition: Interior non-load-bearing wall.\n\nPlan: A technical drawing used to construct a set.\n\nPlinth or Pedestal: The base or platform upon which a column, statue, monument or structure rests. A plinth is a lower terminus of the face trim on a door that is thicker and often wider than the trim which it augments.\n\nProscenium Arch: An arch framing the opening between the stage and the auditorium in some theatres.\n\nRiser: Vertical face between two treads of a stair; also a raised stage platform or seating platform.\n\nSection View: A drawing view created by cutting through another drawing with a section line.\n\nSkin: The external layer of a structure, building, wall, or furnishing that is visible to the viewer.\n\nSpan: Distance between supports.\n\nTolerance: The amount that dimensions can be wrong without affecting the performance. Each can have its own specification for tolerance. Tolerances may be used to specify allowable variations in strength, stability, the mix of a material, the performance of a system, temperature ranges and so on.\n\nTransom: Window or element, fixed or operable, above a door but within its vertical frame.\n\nTread: Horizontal surface between two risers of a stair.\n\nTrim: Decorative building elements often used to conceal joints.\n\nTruss: Structural element made up of a triangular arrangement of members that transforms the nonaxial forces acting on it into a set of axial forces on the truss members.\n\nVault: Arched form.\n\nVeneer: Thin layer, sheet, or facing.\n\nWainscoting: A broader term referring to decorative panelling used for centuries as: a) a wall accent; b) insulation and; c) to prevent (and cover up) damage to walls. It typically is made of wood and covers the lower three or four feet of an interior wall."
