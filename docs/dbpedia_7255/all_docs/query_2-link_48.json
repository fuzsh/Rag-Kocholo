        "text": "Today’s Wiki-est Amazonian Googlies\n\nAcross\n\n1 Snake charming snakes : COBRAS\n\nSnake charmers don’t actually hypnotize their cobras, but they do train them. The snake is trained to “follow” the movement of the end of the pungi, the instrument that the charmer uses in the act. The snake presents no danger to the charmer or the audience, as it is typically defanged or has it’s mouth partially stitched up so that only the tongue can be moved in and out. Not a very nice practice …\n\n11 Many a plaid cap : TAM\n\nA tam o’shanter is a man’s cap worn traditionally by Scotsmen. “Tams” were originally all blue (and called “blue bonnets”) but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of the Robert Burns poem “Tam o’ Shanter”. A pom-pom adorning a tam is known as a toorie.\n\n“Tartan” is sometimes called “plaid” over here in the US, and is a word not used in the same sense outside of this country. In Scotland, a plaid is a blanket or a tartan cloth slung over the shoulder.\n\n15 Like notes that aren’t sharp, briefly : LOFI\n\nLofi hip hop is a genre of music that combines chill-out music with elements of hip hop.

I think the idea is that competitors fight each other in various disciplines to see who is the “best of the best” …\n\n22 Larry’s housemate on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” : LEON\n\n“Curb Your Enthusiasm” is an improv comedy show aired by HBO that was created and stars Larry David, the creator of “Seinfeld”. As an aside, Larry David sat a few feet from me at the next table in a Los Angeles restaurant a few years ago.

I think it is now generally accepted that there is a fourth fundamental state matter, namely plasma. Plasma is a state without a definite shape or volume, and in that sense is similar to a gas. In a plasma, electrons have been ripped away from their nuclei, forming a conductive electron “sea”. Plasmas are created from gases by applying a massive voltage difference or an extremely high temperature.\n\n28 “If These Walls Could Talk” star : DEMI MOORE\n\nDemi Moore was born Demetria Guynes and took the name Demi Moore when she married her first husband, Freddy Moore. Moore’s second husband was Bruce Willis. She changed her name to Demi Guynes Kutcher a few years after marrying her third husband, Ashton Kutcher. However, Kutcher and Moore split in 2013.\n\n“If These Walls Could Talk” is a TV show anthology in three parts that focuses on three women, in three different times, and their experiences with abortion. Demi Moore leads the 1952 story, Sissy Spacek the 1974 story, and Anne Heche the 1996 story. The show’s title is a reference to the house in which the three women lived.\n\n35 “__ the fields we go … ” : O’ER\n\nThe traditional Christmas song “Jingle Bells” was first published in 1857, penned by James Lord Pierpont. We associate the song with Christmas, although in fact Pierpont wrote it as a celebration of Thanksgiving.\n\nDashing through the snow\n\nIn a one horse open sleigh\n\nO’er the fields we go\n\nLaughing all the way\n\n36 Actress who played Lucy on “Raising Hope” : BIJOU PHILLIPS\n\nBijou Phillips is a retired actress, and daughter of John Philips, leader of the Mamas & the Papas vocal group.\n\n“Raising Hope” is a sitcom that aired for four seasons starting in 2010.

In the 1800s, Scotsman John Loudon McAdam developed a style of road known as “macadam”. Macadam had a top-layer of crushed stone and gravel laid over larger stones. The macadam also had a convex cross-section so that water tended to drain to the sides. In 1901, a significant improvement was made by English engineer Edgar Purnell Hooley who introduced tar into the macadam, improving the resistance to water damage and practically eliminating dust. The “tar-penetration macadam” is the basis of what we now call “tarmac”.\n\n53 Special attention, for short : TLC\n\nTender loving care (TLC)\n\n55 Kit filled with money and passports, in spy movies : GO BAG\n\nA bug-out bag (also “go bag”) is a portable collection of items that one would grab when evacuating from a disaster. One well-accepted guideline is that a bug-out bag contains all that would be needed to survive for 72 hours. A related kit is a get-home bag that might be kept in one’s car or place of work. A get-home bag contains the items needed to get back home in the absence of public transportation. My wife and I put together bug-out bags a few years ago, after moving into an area that is at high risk for wildfires …\n\n59 Nomadic invader : HUN\n\nThe Huns were a nomadic people who originated in Eastern Europe in the 4th century.

By 1927 the airport had expanded and earned the name Chicago Municipal Airport. In 1932 Midway was the world’s busiest airport, a title it held for thirty years. In 1949, in honor of the WWII Battle of Midway, the airport was renamed again to Chicago Midway Airport. Then in 1955, along came Chicago International Airport and all the major airlines started moving their operations over to the newer facility. Today, Midway is a major hub for Southwest.\n\nDown\n\n1 Cell component? : CAMERA\n\nWhat we mostly call a “cell phone” here in North America is more usually referred to as a “mobile phone” in Britain and Ireland. My favorite term for the device is used in Germany, where it is called a “Handy”.\n\n3 Congo ape : BONOBO\n\nThe bonobo used to be called the pygmy chimpanzee, and is a cousin of the common chimpanzee. The bonobo is an endangered species that is now found in the wild only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa. Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest species to humans genetically.\n\n4 Box score total : RUNS\n\nIn the world of sports, a box score lists the score of a game as well as achievements of the competing teams and team members.\n\n5 “The Phantom Menace” boy : ANI\n\n“Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace” was the fourth film released in the “Star Wars” franchise, and the first in a prequel trilogy (the first three films were Episodes IV, V & VI). “The Phantom Menace” was released in 1999, twenty-two years after the original “Star Wars” movie, and sixteen years after the previous episode, “Return of the Jedi”.\n\n7 Teeny circus performer : FLEA\n\nIn a real flea circus, fleas are attached to miniature items that create the illusion that the fleas are performing circus acts. The fleas are harnessed by wrapping a metal wire around their bodies, which is then attached to props. Because fleas have such strong legs, they can then move objects that are a lot larger than they are. Apparently, the concept of a flea circus originated with watchmakers in the early 1800s. The artisans used the “circus” to demonstrate their metalworking abilities.\n\n8 Nutrient-rich soil : LOAM\n\nLoam is soil made up of sand, silt and clay in the ratio of about 40-40-20. Relative to other soil types, loam is usually rich in nutrients and moisture, drains well and is easy to till.

I haven’t seen this one yet, but it does sound very interesting …\n\n12 Some tall antiques : ARMOIRES\n\n“Armoire” is the French word for “wardrobe”, and is used in English for a standing closet that stores clothes.\n\n24 How caviar may be served : ON TOAST\n\nCaviar is the roe of a large fish that has been salted and seasoned, and especially the roe of a sturgeon. Beluga caviar comes from the beluga sturgeon, which is found primarily in the Caspian Sea. It is the most expensive type of caviar in the world. 8 ounces of US-farmed beluga caviar can be purchased through Amazon.com for just over $850, in case you’re feeling peckish …\n\n25 Ore refinery : SMELTER\n\nMetals are found in ore in the form of oxides. In order to get pure metal from the ore, the ore is heated and the metal oxides within are reduced (i.e. the oxygen is removed) in the chemical process known as smelting. The oxygen is extracted by adding a source of carbon or carbon monoxide which uses up the excess oxygen atoms to make carbon dioxide, a waste product of smelting (and, a greenhouse gas).\n\n27 Koothrappali on “The Big Bang Theory” : RAJ\n\nRaj Koothrappali is a character on the sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” who is played by British-Indian actor Kunal Nayyar. Nayyar is married to Neha Kapur, a former Miss India.\n\n30 __ tai : MAI\n\nThe mai tai cocktail is strongly associated with the Polynesian islands, but the drink was supposedly invented in 1944 in Trader Vic’s restaurant in Oakland, California.

He has appeared in concerts and recorded with the Beach Boys several times.\n\n55 __ the lily : GILD\n\nTo gild is to coat with gold. The phrase “to gild the lily” means to add unnecessary ornamentation, to try to improve something that is already ideal.\n\n57 AC measures : BTUS\n\nIn the world of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), the power of a heating or cooling unit can be measured using the British Thermal Unit (BTU). This dated unit is the amount of energy required to heat a pound of water so that the water’s temperature increases by one degree Fahrenheit.\n\n58 Ellipse points : FOCI\n\nOne way to envision the two foci of an ellipse is to imagine two nails sticking up out of a board, placed a small distance apart. A loop of string is placed on the board, with the nails in the middle. A pen is placed inside the loop, and moved as far away from the nails as possible, confined by the string. The pen is then run around the nails, stretching out the string so that it is taut. The pen will draw an ellipse, and the point where the nails are, they are the ellipse’s two foci.\n\n60 Language along the Mekong : LAO\n\nLao, the language of Laos, does not use spaces between words (or periods!), although this is apparently changing. Spaces are used between sentences and clauses.\n\nAt over 2,700 miles in length, the Mekong is the twelfth longest river in the world. It rises in the Tibetan Plateau and empties into the South China Sea at the famed Mekong Delta in Vietnam."
