        "text": "Film Identification\n\nIt is important to be able to identify the types of film in your collection in oder to care for them appropriately. Cold storage is used to preserve two types of fim, cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, while blacka nd while pilyester film is stable and does not require cold storage. All color media does require cold storage regardless of its film base.\n\nBecause cold storage space is usally limited, it is important to target only those film collections requiring cold storage, and to identify nitrate film because it has additional fire code requirements.\n\nThere are three major types of plastic films used in photography--cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetat, and lastly, polyseter film. Cellulose nitrate was introduced in about 1890. It was used for a variety of formats, from motion picture film to various sheet films and even microfilm. Because it was highly flammable, the manufacturers began to replace these various formats with a safer versuib called safety film made from cellulose acetate. By the 1930s, cellulose acetate was commonly found in almost every format, such as 8-millimeter motion picture film, in the 1920s for x-ray films,and for sheet films in the 1930s. In 1960, polyester was introduced as another plastic film, although it stil competes with acetate, which is found on many formats today. Polyester film, however, is very stable and does not require cold storage, while acetate and nitrate deteriorate rapidly at room temperature and do require cold storage.\n\nThis tool can be used to help you identify a piece of film as polyester or cellulosic, but it cannot be used to differentiate between the cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate films. This identification is important because all cellulosic film requires cold storage, and most polyester films are stable in a normal archival environment. Here's a brief demonstration on the use of this tool.\n\nThis is a piece of polyester film, and as most films, the center of the film is very dark, so it's hard to get a good read on the film through the polarizing lens. however, if you take a part of the film that is light, like along the edges generally, put it between the viewer, hold the viewer up to the light and look through it, and if it's a polyester, you'll see what are called interference colors, or the reds and green colors. If you take a piece of cellulose acetate film, do the same thing, find a spot that's light, put it between the viewer, the two polarized films, hold it up to a light source, it will be dark. It will be dark black or blue and there will be no interference colors. This identification technique comes in very handy if the film is in relatively good condition and also if it's not edge marked and you can't readily tell if it says nitrate or safety."
