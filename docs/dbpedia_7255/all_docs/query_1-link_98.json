Automat sold hot pies from vending machines. Iâ€™m pretty sure they sold hotdogs too but I was only really interested in the pies.\n\nI was defeated by a huge stack of pancakes at the Brooklyn Diner. One day, Iâ€™ll go back for round 2!\n\nI have a whole heap of colour photos to share once Iâ€™ve whittled them down to a few favourites ðŸ™‚"
