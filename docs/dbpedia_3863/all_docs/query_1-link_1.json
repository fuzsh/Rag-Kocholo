        "text": "Soon these hot houses, called “pineries”, became symbols of wealth and prestige. King Charles II in England was presented with the first pineapple grown in England in 1677 and other monarchies and aristocrats in Europe began building pineries.\n\nIn 1723 Chelsea Gardens of London built a “pineapple stove”, that heated their hot house in order to cultivate the tropical plants for the needed 18 month growing cycle. In 1733 France’s King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple grown in a hot house pinery in the city of Versailles. Even Catherine The Great of Russia ate pineapples grown in pineries on her estates. Eventually pineapple rivalries broke out among the aristocratic families of Europe.\n\nInterestingly the fruit was rarely eaten by most aristocrats, instead being used again and again as displays at dinner parties. They were carved into stone, wood and woven into carpets and drapes, making the pineapple a symbol of luxury.\n\nPineapple madness began to spread across Europe and eventually back to the New World. The American colonies revered the pineapple just as much as the Europeans did. Imported from the Caribbean, they were very expensive with a single pineapple costing as much as $8000 in today’s dollars. In 1751 George Washington, having tasted pineapples in Barbados, built a hot house at his Mt Vernon estate and grew pineapples. “Pineries” had become an engineering marvel of the times designed to provide constant temperature and light to grow the fruit in temperate zones throughout the world.\n\nThese heated glass greenhouses became a great way to show off one’s wealth with pineapples as well as oranges and mangos becoming popular crops. Pineapples also came into high demand by ship captains, including Captain Cook, as they were a great source of vitamins and could fend of scurvy. Pineapple patches could be found in harbors around the world and boosted their demand and exclusivity.\n\nChristopher Cumo, author of “Foods that Changed History” writes that “pineapple was the fruit of colonialism” with the Spanish, Portuguese, French, British and Dutch who all sought to establish pineapple plantations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nThere are stories of a Spanish shipwreck that may have brought the first pineapples to the Big Island around the mid 1520’s but the first record of pineapples being grown for commercial purposes in Hawai’i comes from a Spanish ship pilot named Don Francisco de Paula Marin. Marin arrived in Hawaii in 1794 and became a trusted advisor to Kamehameha the Great. Marin became an interpreter for the King and assisted in acquiring western weapons for Kamehameha’s attack on Oahu. For his service he was given land in Honolulu near Pearl Harbor. He acquired various seeds and plants from the Spanish in California and from English trading vessels.\n\nIn 1813 Marin introduced several crops he believed could thrive in the tropical and subtropical climates of Hawaii. He planted coffee, cotton, mangos, pineapples and grapes. By 1815 his wine grapes did so well in Honolulu that his wine became very popular. Today’s Vineyard Street in Honolulu was named after his vineyard.\n\nJohn Kidwell, an English immigrant from London, established himself as a nurseryman and gardener in San Francisco in 1879 at the age of 29. Many of his best customers were from the Hawaiian Islands who bought flowers, plants and shrubs to import to the islands. They pointed out to Kidwell the advantages of establishing a nursery in Honolulu. Kidwell did just that, arriving on Oahu in 1882.\n\nKidwell arrived just as the Kingdom of Hawai’i had nearly completed a transformation from subsistence agriculture to a market economy. The land reforms of King Kamehameha III in the 1850’s allowed foreigners to buy large tracts of land to be used for commercial agriculture which was soon to be dominated by sugar cane plantations.\n\nThe expansion of the sugar economy was also accompanied by a demographic transformation. The native Hawaiian population had been steadily declining for decades, due mostly to introduced diseases which killed a large portion of the original population discovered by Captain Cook in 1778. An estimated 80% of native Hawaiians were gone by the early 1880’s. The population loss became counterbalanced by European and American immigrants and their descendants who established a large portion of the sugar industry. Workers were recruited from Asia to fill in the labor needs and the economic power of the planters grew. By 1875 the Kingdom of Hawaii was ruled by King David Kalakaua and the kingdom had its own constitutional government, legislature, courts and police. However, the economic power of the sugar planters meant the Hawaiian government was dependent upon them for its revenues.\n\nEven though sugar was dominate in the islands there was a great demand for fresh Hawaiian pineapples in San Francisco. Pineapples from the Big Island of Hawai’i, known as “Wild Kailua” were picked green and sent to Honolulu to be shipped to the US. John Kidwell, familiar with hot house pineapples in London, realized these wild growing pineapples were of poor quality.\n\nKidwell and Big Island grower Charles Hansen brought pineapple shoots to Oahu in 1885 and planted 4 or 5 acres in the Manoa Valley. They grew larger here but still lacked the flavor Kidwell desired. He began researching horticultural periodicals and found a much praised variety in Florida called the Smooth Cayenne. He ordered a dozen plants that same year and another 1000 from Jamaica the following year. The crop was just over 60% successful but not quite to his liking, so he order 4 of every kind of pineapple known from London nurseries receiving 31 different species. However the Smooth Cayenne produced the best flavor and size.\n\nKidwell also developed the propagation of pineapple plants from stumps, cutting the tops off the fruit and replanting them. This however made the crownless fruit rot quicker in transport and in 1889 Kidwell began to delve into pineapple canning. His first cases of canned pineapples were shipped from his now 10 acre Manoa Valley plantation to San Francisco. However due to US tariffs on canned imports the endeavor lost money even though dealers considered the product superior.\n\nEven though sugar was dominate in the islands there was a great demand for fresh Hawaiian pineapples in San Francisco.

However due to US tariffs on canned imports the endeavor lost money even though dealers considered the product superior.\n\nIn 1901 James Drummond Dole, a graduate of Harvard Bussey Agricultural Institute began experimenting with several crops on his 64 acre homestead. He decided pineapples were more suited to the central Oahu land and formed the Dole Hawaiian Pineapple Company. Dole sold 125,000 cases of pineapples in 1905 and expands his operation by building Iwilei Cannery near Honolulu in 1907. By 1909 three major companies, Dole, Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple, were growing and processing pineapples the US market. In 1910 Dole hired engineer Henry Ginaca to build a pineapple coring and peeling machine. Until this invention pineapples were hand cut at a rate of 15 per minute. By 1913 Ginaca’s machines was processing 100 pineapples per minute and required only 3 to 5 workers. This revolutionized pineapple canning and these machines are still in use today.\n\nDole began a marketing campaign in US national women’s magazines promoting pineapples and recipes. His marketing efforts became a huge success and soon he begins looking to expand his acreage.\n\nWith financial help from his family he purchases the island of Lana’i in 1922 for $1.1 million and begins planting around 20,000 acres, creating the largest pineapple plantation in the world and earning the islands nickname “The Pineapple Island”. Dole builds a harbor, lays out a small town for his workers and by 1930 was exporting 65,000 tons of pineapples per year. Hawai’i exported over nine million cases of pineapples from eight different canneries that same year. Hawaii was now supplying 80% of the world’s canned pineapples.\n\nHarvard Square Library – Quotes of James Dole – “Pineapple growing created the necessity for a market, and in order to enlarge the market to the entire United States (and other countries) and to extend the marketing season throughout the entire year, a cannery seemed necessary. This meant that money had to be raised and a company started, and this necessitated more land, which had to be leased. I started my first pineapple plants in the spring of 1901, our company was incorporated in December of that year, and in the summer of 1903 we put up our first season’s pack of 1893 cases. In 1923 we packed 2,038,671 cases, or 43,497,828 cans. The period between has been one of repetitive cycles of more land, more pineapples, more cannery. Our plantings in 1923, if extended in a straight line, would have made a double row from New York to San Francisco.\n\nDole on the Island of Lana’i\n\nThe island of Lana’i sits almost dead center in the Hawaiian islands archipelago. It had always been sparsely inhabited even in ancient times but Kamehameha’s war of unification had nearly emptied the island. Sugar cane production was attempted by Chinese immigrants in the 1830’s but was short lived. In 1854 a group of Mormons from Utah were granted a lease by the Kingdom of Hawai’i on the island and in 1862 Walter M Gibson arrived to reorganize the settlement. He purchased the ahupua’a (ancient land division running from the mountains to the sea) of Palawai with church money but put the title in his own name. Despite being excommunicated from the church for this deed, he continued as leader of the colony and had acquired most of the island by the 1870’s for cattle ranching. Gibson went on to become the Minister of Foreign affairs for King David Kalakaua and eventually Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1886.\n\nIn 1890 Gibson’s daughter and son in law formed Maunalei Sugar Company on Lana’i but their business failed in 1901. Soon after Louisa Gay purchased a portion of the estate and by 1907 possessed most of the land on Lana’i. They planted 1200 acres of pineapples and by 1910 Honolulu newspapers had reported that the crop had been a success:\n\n“…Several thousand pineapple tops have been sent to Lanai by the Lanai Company to develop its pineapple enterprise. The pineapple experiment on Lanai has been successful. The first ones raised weighed about eight and a half pounds each, but later ones were not so heavy, on account of the rows being too close. The industry will be developed on the island and made one of the principal crops.” (Hawaiian Gazette, November 22, 1910:8)\n\nThe crop did well but the island’s rugged roads and harbor made transporting fruit to market difficult. Gay would eventually sell the island to James Dole’s Hawaiian Pineapple Company in 1922 for $1.1 million – $29 million in today’s dollars.\n\nDole’s Lana’i plantation became the world’s largest pineapple plantation with over 16,000 acres in cultivation employing over 1000 Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Korean and Puerto Rican immigrants. Agriculture began to decline and in 1961 Dole Food Company reformed into a new company named Castle & Cooke. Dole Food Company CEO David H Murdock bought out Castle & Cooke in 1985 and began planning on phasing out pineapple and developing the island as a tourist destination. The last harvest in 1992 ended a 70 year tradition of pineapples on Lana’i.\n\nDavid and Henry Baldwin purchased the land in West Maui above Honolua Bay in 1889 as a ranch. A year later they planted pineapple as an experimental crop. The fruit grew well here so they expanded the acreage over several decades and by 1909 the Baldwins formed the Maui Pineapple Company. Ranch manager David Thomas Fleming, a Scotsman, converted the Honolua Ranch into a pineapple plantation in 1912.\n\nIn 1920 a canning operation was created called Baldwin Packers (today’s Lahaina Cannery Shopping Center) for the Honolua pineapples and by 1924 was canning 4,500 cases per day!\n\nBy 1933 over 22,000 acres of pineapples were under production. The company’s crop, a hybrid called “Maui Gold”, became popular and the with pineapples cultivated on both sides of the island the company became the second largest pineapple producer in Hawai’i.\n\nProduction of Hawaiian canned pineapples peaked in 1957 and began a steady decline when foreign based plantations and canneries in the Philippines, Asia and Costa Rica began producing pineapples at labor costs around one-tenth that of Hawai’i. As canneries continued to close the industry shifted to the production of fresh pineapples for the local markets. Dole closed it’s cannery on Oahu in 1991, Del Monte ceased operations in 2008 and Maui Land & Pine closed it’s cannery in 2009. Today only two plantations remain. Dole Plantation on Oahu still produces fresh pineapples on a small scale as well as the Maui Gold Pineapple Company in upcountry Maui.\n\nFresh Hawaiian grown pineapples can be found on all the islands today and in some west coast markets. They are quite different from canned pineapples in that they have low acidity and are much sweeter. This is due to the work of the Pineapple Research Institute at the University of Hawai’i.\n\nIf sugar was the king of Hawai’i, than pineapple was it’s queen. In fact it can be said that pineapple and Hawai’i are still synonymous to this day. If you add pineapple to a pizza or burger it becomes a “Hawaiian” pizza or burger.\n\nBack in the 1950’s and 60’s, if you were a Hawaiian going to school on the mainland, chances are your nickname was “pineapple”. That’s how ingrained the association with pineapples and Hawaii was and is. Hawai’i and pineapples became synonymous back in the 1920’s with the Dole Pineapple Company but the pineapples history in the islands spans over 100 years. Generations of local residents worked in the pineapple fields with many kids experiencing their first summer job while working in the pineapple canneries."
