        "text": "Article: Hawai'i Doesn't Want Visitors Right Now, or Ever. Here's Why.\n\nApr 1, 2023\n\nHawai'i Doesn't Want Visitors Right Now, or Ever. Here's Why.\n\nWe get it, it's cold where you're from. You want to escape the snow covered streets & trade your view for something warmer. Hawai'i might seem like the attractive option for you as it's an easy domestic flight, currency is the same & you won't need to change your eSIM. Some native Hawaiians have been begging people to stop coming to Hawai'i for years & here's why you should listen. The tourism industry does not directly help anybody of Native Hawaiian descent. Yes, there is no doubt that tourism is the biggest economic factor in the islands. However, you might be surprised to find out that there are ZERO hotels owned & operated by anyone of Native Hawaiian descent on the island of O'ahu. There is only 1 on the Big Island of Hawai'i.\n\nEver wondered why there are so few native Hawaiians working in the tourism & hospitality industry?\n\nIt is not necessarily accurate to say that all Native Hawaiians & locals dislike tourists. Although most don't. Many Native Hawaiians work in the tourism industry & rely on it for their livelihoods. But, more commonly, people find that there are less and less Native Hawaiians willing to work in the tourism and hospitality industry. There are Native Hawaiians & other residents of Hawai'i who have valid concerns about the impact of tourism on the islands.\n\nThe narrative that \"natives welcomed us\" often propagated by some individuals can be traced back to the colonial history that has shaped the tourism industry in Hawai'i. This perspective tends to overlook the nuances of the local population's feelings towards tourism and the historical injustices they have faced. It can inadvertently perpetuate a colonizer savior mentality, where outsiders believe they are benevolently embraced by indigenous communities. However, such a viewpoint oversimplifies the complex relationship between native Hawaiians and the impact of tourism.\n\nThe reduction of tourism in 2020 allowed Hawaii's natural resources, such as beaches and coral reefs, to recover from the impacts of over-tourism. However, the heavy reliance on social media has led to an influx of visitors seeking the same popular spots, resulting in overcrowding and environmental degradation. The excessive use of social media to promote tourism has also perpetuated stereotypes and cultural appropriation, leading to tensions between local communities and tourists. The main reasons you shouldn't visit Hawai'i are:\n\nCultural Appropriation: Hawaii has a rich & unique culture, & some tourists may not show proper respect for it. For example, some tourists may wear sacred Hawaiian symbols, such as the hula skirt, as a costume without understanding the cultural significance behind them. This may not entirely be a visitor's fault as many companies and organizations promote a warped view of \"Hawaiian Culture.\" Often this is done to promote their financial interests and feed into a visitor's ideation of an accommodating paradise. Unfortunately, this can easily lead to more confusion about Hawaiian culture and lead to a lack of respect.\n\nDisrespect for the environment: Hawaii is known for its beautiful natural environment and animals that can be found nowhere else on the planet. But, the increase in tourism has resulted in problems such as overcrowding, littering, an overextension of our rescue and emergency resources & damage to the fragile ecosystem. Some Native Hawaiians may feel that tourists do not show enough respect for the environment. We've seen too many viral videos of disrespectful visitors coming too close to wildlife & we've had enough.\n\nDisrespect for locals: Visitors act rudely or disrespectfully towards locals, which can be seen as a lack of respect for the Native Hawaiian culture & people. They go viral for harassing critically endangered monk seals. They step on sacred burial grounds to get a better view of a sunset & steal the lava rocks when they leave. They take the wrong way on illegal hikes - putting local first responders in danger & wasting already strained resources by needing to get rescued. After devastating fires that killed hundreds on Maui, they board snorkeling tours & swim around in waters where people died 24 hours earlier. They spray non-reef safe aerosol sunscreen all over the beach. They feel entitled to their \"expensive vacation\" & don't tip on their tours or restaurant outings. They bring their mustang convertible road rage driving to our already overcrowded streets & roll their rental cars into our harbors. They demand refunds for the weather being rainy when nature doesn't look like postcards. They try to sue hotels for beach recommendations when their own lack of swimming abilities put them in danger. Many unknowingly contribute to modern day colonization by moving to the islands & have the audacity to ask for a kama'aina discount at local businesses, meanwhile they can't even pronounce the word \"kama'aina\". And after all of that, tourists & transplants have the gall to ask \"where's your 'Aloha Spirit'?\", a phrase that has been taken from its native origins & transformed into a popular marketing tool to propel the tourism industry by promoting a welcoming & friendly atmosphere in nature, hotels, stores, & restaurants. They don't like hearing that they aren't wanted, & leave hate comments on blog posts written by Hawaiians.\n\nEconomic disparities: While tourism can bring in revenue to the islands, there are concerns that it can also create economic disparities, with tourists benefiting more than locals. Some Native Hawaiians may feel that the tourism industry has not done enough to address these disparities. To make matters worse, more and more natives are getting priced out of their homes from foreign or out-of-state investors and corporations. Many visitors feel that they are helping the economy because of the money that they spend. However, the majority of businesses serving visitors are not owned by indigenous people of the islands.\n\nCorruption & Hawaiian Identity: It's crucial to acknowledge the deep-rooted issues that go beyond surface-level interactions in Hawai'i. The concept of blood quantum, often used to define Native Hawaiian identity, is inherently discriminatory & serves as a reminder of the historical injustices faced by indigenous communities. Furthermore, the mismanagement of tourism revenue by certain politicians has exacerbated the divide, perpetuating a cycle where the KƒÅnaka Maoli population sees little benefit from the influx of visitors. It's imperative to recognize these systemic issues & strive for a more equitable distribution of resources that respects the dignity & heritage of Native Hawaiians, ensuring that the proper reparations are paid for their land being stolen.\n\nThere Are Other Options: While tourism is a prevalent industry in various parts of the world, it's important to recognize that the impact of tourism on different communities can vary significantly. For instance, comparing tourism in destinations like San Diego or Nantucket to Hawai'i in 2023 requires acknowledging the distinct historical and cultural contexts. In many cases, the tourism industry in these contiguous U.S. cities does not carry the same weight of colonization and displacement as seen in Hawai'i. Hawai'i's indigenous population has faced generations of colonialism, land loss, and cultural suppression, which can intensify the consequences of tourism-related development.\n\nIt is important to note that these concerns are not universal, & some Native Hawaiians welcome tourists who show respect for the culture and environment of the islands. Although due to the behavior of the majority of tourists, it's fair to say that most indigenous people of Hawai'i do not welcome tourists. Quite the opposite of welcoming, they wait at the airport with \"Go Home\" signs. They plead all over social media for visitors not to come. Aside from your next visit not being welcome by the natives (which should be enough), here are some other reasons to dissuade you from hopping on the plane:\n\nCost: Hawaii is one of the most expensive states in the US to visit, & the cost of flights, rental cars, accommodations, and activities can add up quickly. If you're traveling on a budget, you may find it difficult to justify the expense.\n\nCrowds: Hawaii is a popular tourist destination, & many of its attractions can get crowded, particularly during peak season. If you prefer a more secluded or peaceful vacation, Hawaii may not be the best choice. Additionally, legal short-term rental accommodations are often only allowed in certain zones such as Waikiki or the Ko'olina area. If you wanted to stay somewhere local, you won't find those options in Hawai'i.\n\nDistance: Hawaii is quite far from many parts of the world, and the travel time can be long and tiring. If you don't enjoy long flights or have limited vacation time, you may want to choose a destination that is closer to home.\n\nWeather: While Hawaii is known for its warm and sunny climate, it can also be subject to hurricanes, heavy rain, and other extreme weather events. If the only time you can travel is in the winter, you may have heavy rains during your entire stay here. Additionally, if you're traveling during hurricane season, you may want to consider other destinations. Even in the summer, the weather changes every five minutes & you could be subject to rainstorms for your entire trip even if the forecast predicts sunshine.\n\nEnvironmental impact: Hawaii is a fragile ecosystem, and its delicate environment can be easily disrupted by large numbers of visitors. If you're concerned about your carbon footprint or the impact of tourism on the environment, you may want to choose a more sustainable travel destination. For instance, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat, over 85% of the food consumed on the islands must be imported.\n\nThe best way to help Native Hawaiians is from a distance. You are not helping by visiting. Here are some of our favorite charities & organizations that you can contribute to instead of coming to Hawai'i. There are many reputable Hawaiian charities and organizations that are dedicated to supporting various causes throughout the islands.\n\nHawaii Community Foundation: The Hawaii Community Foundation is a philanthropic organization that supports a wide range of causes throughout Hawaii, including education, the environment, health, and the arts. They work with donors to create customized giving plans and provide grants to organizations that are working to improve the lives of people in Hawaii.\n\nMalama Maunalua: Malama Maunalua is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to restoring and preserving the health of the Maunalua Bay in Oahu. They work to remove invasive species, replant native plants, and educate the community about the importance of protecting the bay.\n\nHawaiian Humane Society: The Hawaiian Humane Society is an animal welfare organization that provides a range of services, including animal sheltering, pet adoption, and animal welfare education. They are committed to protecting and improving the lives of animals in Hawaii.\n\nThe Aloha United Way: The Aloha United Way is a nonprofit organization that brings together community resources and supports a range of causes throughout Hawaii, including education, financial stability, and health. They work with local businesses, nonprofit organizations, and individuals to create positive change in the community.\n\nKupu Hawaii: Kupu Hawaii is a nonprofit organization that works to empower youth and communities in Hawaii through environmental conservation and sustainability, green jobs training, and education. They provide training and employment opportunities for young people and support initiatives to protect and restore Hawaii's natural resources.\n\nAina Momona: ‚ÄòƒÄina Momona, which translates to \"fertile or rich land\" in Hawaiian, stands as a passionate community initiative focused on fostering environmental health and sustainability while advocating for social justice and Hawaiian sovereignty. Anchored at the heart of this endeavor is the Keawanui Fishpond and Cultural Learning Center, nestled within the Ka ªamola ahupua'a of Moloka ªi. This site encompasses the expansive Keawanui Fishpond, a 55-acre loko kuapƒÅ (enclosed wall fishpond) that graces the island's southern shore. In days past, this area thrived with numerous loko i ªa, encapsulating the heritage of an abundant aquatic ecosystem. If you wish to support their vital efforts, consider making a donation to ‚ÄòƒÄina Momona and contribute to the preservation of this remarkable cultural and environmental legacy.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many reputable charities and organizations that are working to improve the lives of people in Hawaii. Before donating, it is important to do your own research to ensure that your money is going to a legitimate and effective organization.\n\nThe native people of Hawaii, and other colonized places, have a right to express their concerns about the impact of tourism and colonization on their cultures, traditions, and communities. As responsible travelers, it's important to listen to and respect the perspectives and wishes of those who call a place home, and to approach travel and tourism with sensitivity, awareness, and humility. Travel can be a way to learn, connect, and broaden our perspectives, but it's important to do so in a way that does not exploit or harm the places and people we visit. Currently, visitors cause more harm to the Native people of Hawai'i than good by visiting.\n\nWhile Hawaii is a beautiful destination with much to offer visitors, it's important to consider the impact of tourism on the islands' delicate ecosystems, cultures, and communities. As a responsible traveler, it's important to be mindful of the resources you use, the waste you generate, and the ways in which you can support local businesses and communities. By taking the time to educate yourself on the history and culture of Hawaii, respecting the environment and its inhabitants, and supporting sustainable tourism practices, you can have a more meaningful and respectful experience while contributing to the long-term health and well-being of the islands. It is the opinion of the majority of Native Hawaiians in Hawai'i that tourism needs Hawai'i more than Hawai'i needs tourism. Mahalo for listening to us, please DO NOT COME!\n\nThis blog post represents the informed perspectives of multiple authors, each with backgrounds as Native Hawaiians and individuals from marginalized communities who have deep roots in Hawai'i. Its intention is to provide valuable educational insights for those seeking to understand the nuanced reasons behind potential reservations Native Hawaiians have toward your next Hawai'i vacation. Should any aspect of the content raise concerns, we encourage a conversation, recognizing that differing opinions contribute to meaningful discussions. Our aim is to foster a respectful exchange of ideas and insights. We invite open and constructive dialogue; recognizing that varying viewpoints contribute to robust discussions. However, we must assert that if any content sparks disagreement, it's imperative to reflect on whether one's perspective aligns with the entitlement often associated with the visitors we discuss.\n\n74 comments\n\nI was born in Hawaii and left as soon as I was able to on my own. I have never gone back except for weddings and funerals. The only things I really miss are native Hawaiian foods like poke and ake, and saimin. I do not recognize the place anymore. I do not think I ever liked living there. I read a lot and it seemed to me that Hawaii did not have anything except sand and lava rock. I also never liked the way the local people talk and there were dark-skinned aggressive kids called ‚Äúmokes‚Äù in school. I actually got along better with the haoles!\n\njohn k\n\nAugust 9, 2024 at 6:45 am\n\nThe hypocrisy of European Americans has no limits. All of the whining we see in the U.S. about ‚Äúillegal aliens‚Äù coming into ‚Äòyour‚Äô country, even though these lands were occupied by their ancestors when yours had to sail for 3 months on a boat to get here, and then you all turn around and criticize Hawaiians for asking you to stop coming to the lands that they are actually from, that their ancestors are from, and that they still live in.\n\nI‚Äôm guessing the reason that most of the comments sound like they‚Äôre coming from the mouths of colonizers is because most of the writers are decedents of colonizers. This article is not just about Hawaii, it‚Äôs also about the mainland. European Americans have a very short memory and an unwillingness to acknowledge known history, otherwise they would remember that their ancestors arrived to these lands on rickety boats filled with rats, hoofed animals and disease. All of the comments about ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an economic solution‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you vote for a Hawaiian Governor‚Äù or ‚Äúyour islands are garbage‚Äù (even though European Americans are the ones who continually bring the trash to the islands) are completely ignoring the one, plain truth that the author outlined; these are not your lands, and none of the economic/political/racist culture that came over on your boat belongs to these lands. Neither is anything between ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù or ‚ÄúTexas‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù your lands. And of course you will reply ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not going to leave, and I‚Äôll travel where I want to.‚Äù That is fine. So long as you know that these lands reject you. What do I mean? If you consider the fact that your ‚Äòcountry‚Äô has the worst rates of all types of cancers, diabetes, obesity, mental health disorders, poisonous foods (that your European ancestors will not allow to be sold in their countries), mass shootings (predominantly by European Americans), drug addiction, air/water/soil pollution etc. you might begin to understand that the European culture that arrived on the boats does not function in harmony with these lands and you are witnessing the effects. The area known as the ‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù may have been taken by force, but if you honestly believe that the energy of these lands, which was cultivated by Native Americans through 30,000+ years of blessing the earth/making offerings to the earth/burying ancestors in the earth/thanking the earth, then you are truly no wiser than any of the Europeans that arrived on boats 300 years ago. Asking permission to enter one‚Äôs lands, and the lands of their ancestors, is how you enter with harmony, and with respect. Exactly the same as you would do before attempting to enter someone‚Äôs home. So why should you honor it when Hawaiians ask you not to come? Because it‚Äôs not your home, it‚Äôs not your country, and it‚Äôs not the land of your ancestors. And the irony is; you would most likely be welcomed by the naturally hospitable Hawaiian culture once you learned to show respect to their lands, their culture, their ancestors and their energy, because respectful people are always open to respectful people.\n\nJustin\n\nJuly 9, 2024 at 7:04 am\n\nHello, I have never been to Hawaii but have been to other places around the globe and by chance just came across this blog. What I can‚Äôt understand is, if the majority of native people of Hawaii feel the way that you described, why is there a white Governor ‚ÄúJosh Green‚Äù elected there instead of a native born Hawaiian who would represent the interests of all the indigenous people there? I could see that when it was a territory and the U.S. Presidents were assigning Governors, they were all white men, but once Hawaii became a state, this should have stopped because the power of the vote was then held by the Hawaiian people. From 1959 until now, in 9 elections, you Hawaiians have only elected 1 TRUE Hawaiian. The rest have been Asian and mostly White. Why would you Hawaiians continue to vote for people who are against your best interest and for the interest of Colonial greed?\n\nMT\n\nJuly 4, 2024 at 3:12 pm\n\nHaha. This article is a joke. Your islands are nothing special.\n\nJJ\n\nJune 21, 2024 at 8:49 pm\n\nI‚Äôve been living in Hawaii for a few years now so feel like I should have a voice too. I think visitors numbers should be restricted. Social media influencers without enough followers should be discouraged from coming, anybody who moved here after 2022 should not be allowed to buy property etc.\n\nKaren Thunberg\n\nJune 19, 2024 at 6:02 am\n\nAs a globally indigenous person, I have deep respect for the concerns for the land, culture, and creating equity. How do healthcare conventions fit in? Local orgs hosting them doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean equity and representation of/for indigenous residents, so should respectful people boycott those conventions? Do indigenous healers seeking to practice and/or learn indigenous healing methods have any welcome or is that a boundary at this time?\n\nBig colonizer energy from other commenters. For those saying Hawai‚Äôi is a US state: they are an UNWILLING, colonized nation fighting to regain sovereignty. Even the most basic internet search will tell you that the US claimed ownership through some extremely dubious and underhanded means. Indigenous Hawai‚Äôians had no willing participation in becoming a state/colonial subject. They have a right to self-determination.\n\nIndigenous peoples around the globe are fighting an extractive tourist industry. People wanting to visit respectfully are not the problem but they are such a minority. Machu Pichu in Peru is facing permanent closure to tourists because the sheer number of visitors is causing irreparable damage and erosion to the site. Even if everyone is respectful, the excessive visitation is beyond what the land and sites can handle. You are not entitled to a trip that may irreparably harm priceless and sacred cultural land and artifacts.\n\nPuerto Ricans, folks indigenous to Turtle Island, Native Hawai‚Äôians, and people of the global majority everywhere are facing gentrification due to an extractive form of tourism. Hotels are bad enough, but companies like AirBnB and Vrbo buy up normally affordable houses and apartments for residents and then turn them into vacation rentals. This drives the cost of housing for residents way up and significantly decreases the available housing to a fraction of what is needed. If you‚Äôre feeling defensive as a (would-be) tourist, it‚Äôs for a reason. This isn‚Äôt about YOU, but your presence isn‚Äôt going to help anything. It won‚Äôt make a point or fix the problem. Listen to the indigenous locals. They‚Äôre not gatekeeping the past; they‚Äôre safeguarding the future (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/can-indigenous-land-stewardship-protect-biodiversity-).\n\nNour\n\nJune 12, 2024 at 4:38 pm\n\nWell come to the mainland and see all the illegal aliens here destroying everything.\n\nRaymond\n\nJune 7, 2024 at 5:51 am\n\nHere‚Äôs the Deal.\n\nBeen coming here for years. And I noticed this year after the unfortunate fires, restaurants and businesses are starting to clean up more and try and upkeep places lot better.\n\nWidening the road in Lahainia is inevitable and making it 100% walkable through the main street. This after speaking with locals.\n\nThe truth is, many did not have insurance and that‚Äôs a big no no. Free and clear homes were lost because they were not insured. Businesses were not insured.\n\nThats on you. Regardless of your culture, which I respect, you must see your wrongs as well. You can use the tools of the US to better yourselves and protect yourselves and many didn‚Äôt.\n\nThe buildings were ready to fall apart. Thats the reality.\n\nChange is constant.\n\nNo culture goes unchecked through history.\n\nYou must find a way to find that balance of culture and also reality of the country you live in.\n\nI will be back and will keep coming.\n\nAloha\n\nAxel\n\nJune 7, 2024 at 5:51 am\n\nOh the poor racist Hawaiians. White America should take all their money and inventions and abandon the island hell hole. ‚ÄúNative‚ÄùHawaiians (who came from some where else also) and simply racist narcissists and can keep their garbage islands.\n\nMark\n\nJune 6, 2024 at 9:55 am\n\nI have a couple of ideas to help citizens of the Hawaiian islands out. I have been to Waikiki and Kona many times. I live in Alberta Canada we have 2 very popular destinations Banff and Jasper both are National parks. Entry fee to get into parks. In Jasper you can not own property if not a resident. Lovey place to visit and not over crowded. Some owners have bed and breakfast rooms,and vacation rentals. Also there are the hotels. Banff on the our hand many people from out of the country own. Which makes it hard for people to even work there. Rent to high. The place is over crowded.\n\nAlso the big hotels seem to want it all. I remember reading about 3 years ago . One hotel trying to get rid of all the vacation rentals . And wanting all the big spenders to stay in the hotels. Okay then you need to step up and employ 50 percent of Islanders and since you always want to increase your profit line maybe it is time all hotels can start to pay into a fund that will go to the low income families as a supplement benefit as a monthly payment.\n\nMaybe it is time that changes really need to be made.\n\nBrenda\n\nApril 24, 2024 at 6:39 am\n\nIt is inaccurate to say that going to a place like San Diego is less impactful and more ethical. It is accurate to say that the displacement, horror, and destruction of humans native to San Diego happened longer ago, whereas the displacement, horror, and destruction of humans native to Hawai‚Äôi is not only more recent, but also happening now in real time.\n\nJennifer Black\n\nFebruary 9, 2024 at 9:37 am\n\nI‚Äôve never been to Hawai‚Äôi and between my lack of finances and reading this article I doubt I‚Äôll ever go. I love the music but I can listen to it from home and maybe see some travelling musicians if they ever play locally. I didn‚Äôt get to see the Hawaiian Voyaging canoe H≈çk≈´le ªa when it came by but it was still a pretty exciting event to know about. I wish all the best for Hawai‚Äôi and her people.\n\nalice\n\nFebruary 6, 2024 at 2:10 pm\n\nThanks for the perspective. I‚Äôve visited Oahu twice and Maui once. I had a ‚Äúgood‚Äù time by most tourists standards, but I could sense something wasn‚Äôt right and really felt like I didn‚Äôt belong and was exploiting the native peoples. Like the time we took a drive on some back roads in Maui and about 4 times as we approached each small village we were stopped by groups of small kids dancing in front of our car and then asking for tips. On one level you could think this was cute or entertaining, but for me I felt bad for these kids and their families that this is what they‚Äôve been reduced to, dancing for tourists, like a native people‚Äôs minstrel show , begging for a few dollars. We also visited the Polynesian Cultural Center ‚Äì again, on one level you could view it as entertaining and informational, but for me it looked and felt like exploitation. When I read about its history I realized this place is like the California Missions the Spanish built that were the site of so much injustice and decimation of indigenous people there. I will definately won‚Äôt be visiting Hawaii again. I also think the fact that so many billionaireswho have recently built huge compounds, fencing off the land from locals, speaks to how mainlanders view and treat Hawaii ‚Äì like a settlement where they can do whatever they please.\n\nDale\n\nJanuary 29, 2024 at 11:08 am\n\nI‚Äôve read a few comments from the ‚Äúsocial media influencers‚Äù and talk about a problem. That‚Äôs the main thing driving tourism, and you wonder why you get mixed feedback from living there üòÇ. I went a few years back and decided I didn‚Äôt want to post anything. Not just there, but anywhere for this reason exactly. I think social media has been weaponized to an extent and I feel bad for the influx of ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù. I think instead of all of the hate though, people should try and approach each other from a place of love. I also believe social media posts should be limited when dealing with more vulnerable areas such as Hawaii and other vacation hotspots. Many others have also mentioned a tourist tax which I believe would be helpful if it went to families struggling on the island. Just my opinion; worth price charged.\n\nJohn Doe\n\nJanuary 29, 2024 at 11:08 am\n\nI feel sorry that you are going through this.\n\nWe have many trips to Maui and Kauai in the past and enjoyed our vacations there.\n\nWe‚Äôll take your feelings into consideration and if a significant number if you do not want mainland visitors we will stay away until you sort it out.\n\nYour indignation is understandable. Your resentment against what you consider colonization is understandable. I want to respectfully point out that you are not exceptional in your experience. This has happened the world over and throughout history.\n\nFor better or worse, the world is connected and you won‚Äôt be able to keep yours paradise isolated and pristine forever.\n\nAlso, know that you are always welcome to use the resources of the rest of the country as help.\n\nIf you at least allow yourselves to view the rest of us in the US as fellow citizens, not just outsiders, it may be helpful going forward.\n\nSom / California\n\nSom Sikdar\n\nJanuary 25, 2024 at 4:39 pm\n\nI understand the message and will respect it. I am shocked to see how many people are angered by it or feel it doesn‚Äôt apply to them. I just got an appeal from the Maui food bank so I will send another donation. And I will stay away. I visited Kauai roughly 15 years ago, I stayed with friends, not native Hawaiians, who were longtime residents. I took a week long Hawaiian language class at the local community college, and also a guided visit to a sacred site, seeing how to maintain them. I bought pottery from art students at a show and sale at the college. And attended a hula festival with dancers, groups of all ages and levels of skill. I‚Äôm glad I did but won‚Äôt return as I do believe staying away is the best way to preserve and respect the community.\n\nJoan\n\nJanuary 25, 2024 at 4:39 pm\n\nAloha. I am a social media influencer and moved here in 2021. I‚Äôve found nothing but love and kindness but granted I do not hang around with too many native islanders. I‚Äôve tried being friendly but find they do not respond when I suggest ways to improve their life. Rent is not too bad so I am not sure why people are complaining? I‚Äôve certainly lived in more expensive places. For example, I found a 3 bedroom house for less than I paid for an apartment in my last location. I now have a room for my pottery (a lifelong dream) and a room to let out for airbnb (which covers my food).\n\nKaren Thunberg\n\nDecember 26, 2023 at 7:36 am\n\nThis comment section reads like a comedy sketch about the problem.\n\nThe only successful land management in the history of the modern world was indigenous management, This is true across the country. Hawaii has been a state for less than 100 years and the refers are dying, clean freshwater is scarce, many species are endangered, and an unsustainable amount of development to support an unsustainable amount of tourism has threatens every conceivable aspect of the landmass. Hawaii must return to Hawaiian control to continue to exist.\n\nInvoking the Lahaina fires as evidence that tourism is acceptable is offensive nuttery. The fires are an indictment of the overcrowding and the prioritization of development and wealth.\n\nI see commenters repeatedly explaining they are the exception ‚Äì no. I get wanting to be but accept that your presence alone is active harm and active colonization.\n\nThere are not exceptions.\n\nI see commenters comparing this to tourism at ‚Äútheir‚Äù homes. Is the place you live your ancestral homeland? As an indigenous person I assure you that across the country this is an issue most indigenous people agree on, and we also understand that Hawaii has very limited land and resources, next to no recognition for Natives, no recognized sovereign government, no settlement of their claims to title, and are experiencing active magnified colonization with outsized impacts. Dont speak overtop of them and don‚Äôt speak overtop of the people who have lived tens of thousands of years on the land you live on either.\n\nCommenters saying you only want to help Hawaiian people ‚Äì tourism is not a help. It‚Äôs feeding the massive corporate structure harming Hawaii and making Hawaiian people housing insecure,\n\nCommenters explaining Native Hawaiians were nice to them and kind and welcoming ‚Äì that is not relevant. What are they supposed to do, heckle you? Frighten you? Harm you? It‚Äôs like saying a woman invited a rape by smiling at a passerby. Being a kind and polite person does not mean you have blanket consent to use of their culture or homelands.\n\nWe love Hawaii, we love Maui, we love our Hawaiian family, for many years we went. We felt safe vacationing to a place with lots of other Indigenous people and enjoyed that specifically. However it has become apparent over the last decade that tourism in Hawaii is harming and that there are no exceptions. For years we considered ourselves the exception too ‚Äì since we are allies. However that was flawed and we are now being allies by traveling elsewhere. Decolonization is an action. In the case of Hawaii the action is staying away.\n\nThere may be a time a sustainable form of tourism led by Indigenous people is available. To have any chance of a world that can get there the system in place has to fall.\n\nApril\n\nDecember 21, 2023 at 9:00 am\n\nWe are local (12 years) but not native. We try to respect everything about Hawaii. We do see a lot of tourists come in and have that entitled attitude, \"we paid a lot of money and we can do what we want) They walk on the coral, they speed around, they fight or argue with the merchants and restaurant people. They go into local areas and act this way and it really leaves an impression that all nonnatives are like this. Which adds to the problems.\n\nA big problem and one of the driving factors of high cost is people buying as many properties as they can and using them as incomes. Homes are to live in not for profits. Even the apartment complexes have become ‚Äúsqueeze every time you can get out of people‚Äù. This drives the cost of everything up. The people that live there must make more money to afford the rental or mortgage costs. There needs to be a restriction on B&B, rentals and purchasing. no one needs to own multiple houses or apts!\n\nRespect the people and the Land and Sea. They are sacred to the Natives.\n\nAloha nui loa\n\nmarc\n\nDecember 18, 2023 at 7:06 am\n\nAs a U.S. citizen who deeply values Hawaiian culture and stands firmly against all forms of racism, I have found a unique way to express these principles through my travel and shopping choices. My annual visits to Kauai are not just a testament to my love for its stunning landscapes and rich culture, but also a reflection of my commitment to principles of respect and inclusivity. Despite facing unwelcome attitudes from some locals and local businesses, I continue to cherish Kauai and, interestingly, have chosen to recommend both the island to my friends.\n\nMy experiences in Kauai, while occasionally marred by discriminatory practices by some locals and local businesses, have not diminished my admiration for the island. In fact, I enthusiastically encourage my friends to visit Kauai to experience its breathtaking beauty and the warm, inclusive atmosphere offered by many. This recommendation comes with a caveat based on my personal experiences: to be mindful of where they choose to spend their money.\n\nIn line with this, I also recommend Costco as the go-to shopping destination while in Kauai. This suggestion stems from my personal stance against the discrimination I encountered in some local establishments. Costco, with its commitment to consistent customer service and a non-discriminatory approach, aligns with the values I and many of my friends hold dear. It provides a reliable shopping experience where all customers are treated with respect and dignity.\n\nThis combination of recommending Kauai for its cultural and natural beauty, along with Costco for shopping, reflects a balanced approach. It acknowledges the complexities of traveling in today‚Äôs world, where personal values, experiences, and consumer choices intersect. By sharing my experiences and choices, I aim to guide my friends in making informed decisions that align with their values, ensuring that their travel and shopping experiences are both enjoyable and ethically sound.\n\nIn conclusion, while my advocacy for Kauai remains strong, it is coupled with an awareness of the realities of local business practices. Recommending Kauai along with Costco is my way of navigating these complexities, allowing for a travel experience that respects cultural beauty and stands firm against any form of discrimination.\n\nBob Rhaid\n\nDecember 13, 2023 at 6:42 am\n\nNo revolving doors either way! No tourists in. No Hawaiians out! There. That‚Äôs solved.\n\nMeliana\n\nDecember 7, 2023 at 7:17 am\n\nMy husband and I have been to Hawaii multiple times over the years. We love it and we‚Äôre always gracious and kind to everyone we met there. We were very respectful to the people and the environment. To read this breaks my heart. It‚Äôs too bad that some irresponsible people have made the Native Hawaiians feel that way. When the fires happened on Maui we were heartbroken and donated money to help the Native people rebuild. But having said this, if the Native Hawaiian people truly don‚Äôt want us there, it‚Äôs easy. We never will return. I don‚Äôt say that in anger or disrespect, I‚Äôm just being honest. Even though we never personally did anything wrong, I don‚Äôt want to go somewhere that I am not welcome. But I hope the Hawaiian people are able to rebuild in peace. Aloha.\n\nKitty McConnell\n\nDecember 4, 2023 at 6:09 pm\n\nDear Native Hawaiians,\n\nWithout Haole‚Äôs, you would have been eradicated by the Japanese 80 years ago. Although they may have kept a few of you for medical experiments and sex slaves.\n\nClyde Benke\n\nOctober 26, 2023 at 5:45 pm\n\nMe and my wife honeymooned on Maui and Oahu in 2021. It was my #1 bucket list place to visit. We talked with locals very candidly throughout our stay and, although there were some cold upon first glance locals; after realizing we were respectful to their culture and respectful of their land. We found that most of the natives we talked with were very nice and shared family stories and history of the islands with us.\n\nI am very saddened to hear so many stories of disrespectful tourists, and I don‚Äôt blame the indigenous people and their apprehension to tourism.\n\nThis article was wonderful at explaining why people shouldn‚Äôt visit Hawaii and hopefully we can foster a society that respects culture in the future so that one day all locals would love to invite us to share in the beauty of the islands ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nMahalo üå∫\n\nJoeyravioly\n\nOctober 16, 2023 at 3:57 pm\n\nThis article so accurately and compassionately explains the concern those of us residents have been trying so diligently to share with visitors. The entitlement, lack of any empathy or respect for the aina, people, wildlife, culture, history and environment is more than appalling, it is near criminal. If tourism is not managed, if extractive tourism continues to deplete and overrun . . . there will be no more so-called ‚Äúgolden goose‚Äù . . .\n\nMauiArtist\n\nOctober 15, 2023 at 11:34 am\n\nReplying to Alex Rodriguez:\n\nIn case you didn‚Äôt know Hawaii can SUSTAIN ITSELF WITHOUT HELP. People that are not from Hawaii specifically Maui, have absolutely no right to expect a welcoming and respect for a place you have no business going to at a time like this. There are people‚Äôs houses that have literally burned down to ashes and you‚Äôre mad because you can‚Äôt come and visit?! Like are you kidding me. Don‚Äôt be calling everyone in Hawaii Hawaiians. Hawaiian is an ethnicity. First of all who said that Hawaiians do not care about your family? Hawaii is all about Ohana ( Family ). Natives in Hawaii sometimes do like tourist but it reflects on how you act while visiting here. Second of all Natives here in Hawaii care a lot about supporting small businesses because all we have are each other here. And how dare you tell Hawaiians to suck a boner, like are you fucking kidding right now. Hawaiians are very respectful towards people and sometimes tourists. Now as a KƒÅnaka Maoli I can say that I am not that fond of tourist but I have met some tourist and my family are close with some. Third of all Natives in Hawaii do not like tourist because of the way they treat us and how they leave Hawaii. Some tourists leave Hawaii with no respect for our land, are special beliefs or wildlife. For example throwing rocks at Hawaiian Monk-seals, leaving trash all over the creation, and expecting respect for acting so poorly with everything. People that are not from Hawaii has to understand that we don‚Äôt have a lot out here in the middle of the ocean so we haft to use things wisely and we need to respect our resources.Oh and FYI you spelt howley wrong its Haole. If you don‚Äôt know Haole does not mean white. It means individuals who are not Native Hawaiian or is not a Hawaiian descendant. So think before you say something stupid like that. Saying that Hawaiians are not welcoming because you came here. We are going through a time of crisis and some tourists think that its a joke and a place to be sight seeing because its not. Please understand that we need to grieve in peace and we don‚Äôt tolerate being disrespected by people who had not been in our shoes. -Thank you.\n\nNakela AR\n\nOctober 10, 2023 at 6:51 am\n\nI honestly think every person commenting on this blog isn‚Äôt seeing both sides of the picture here. Coming from a local who is born and raised on Maui, yes it is true that tourists/travelers alike bring a lot of money to our state and yes most of our money comes from them. But, Hawaii can also sustain itself without having tourists or travelers giving us the money. Tourism is a VERY big part in our state‚Äôs economy, but we aren‚Äôt going to rely on it whatsoever. Yes, it brings in a lot of money for us, but we are able to do it ourselves. In my personal opinion, everyone just argues about MONEY.\n\nPeople from hawaii (and some other places) don‚Äôt rely on your money to support us. Yes Hawaii is a U.S state, but some might not know that Hawaii is a U.S state illegally. Before Hawaii became a U.S state, we had sustainable lives with a sustainable economy. But, the cost of living went up, the food prices went up, and a lot of locals had to leave because it was getting too expensive to live here anymore. So, I think that‚Äôs why some tourists might think that they are the reasons why hawaii is getting its money. But the truth is, it is and it isn‚Äôt.\n\nI‚Äôve personally read some of these comments on this blog and what some people have to say about the locals are very disrespectful and unrealistic. Because I‚Äôve lived here all my life, i‚Äôve seen how locals and tourists can act, and it goes both ways. Some tourists come to the islands thinking that they are entitled to everything because ‚Äúthey give us the money to survive‚Äù; some of them are rude to the locals, disrespect us by taking pictures of Lahaina (after the fire that caused everything to burn down) because they simply want too, and act like we owe them something because they simply think so. And yes, some Hawaiians can be rude too. Some of them hate ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù because some ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù come to Hawaii and buy/take away the land that we have left, or some Hawaiians think that tourists are taking away everything we built and just disrespect our culture in general. In my opinion, it‚Äôs all about how you act and how you decide to react. If you want to be rude, we‚Äôll be rude back, if you want to be disrespectful, we‚Äôll disrespect you back, if your respectful to us and our land, we‚Äôll do the same for you.\n\nI also want to respond to a specific message that someone has said on here. ‚ÄúMy taxes are going to rebuild Lahaina‚Äù. I want to address this issue because here‚Äôs the thing, you don‚Äôt know where your tax money is going, the country doesn‚Äôt tell you where its going so don‚Äôt assume that its going directly to the town of Lahaina. And Lahaina is still is ashes, to this very day. It‚Äôs been over 2 months since the deadly fire and nothing has been done, so if you want to help, then help, if you want to donate, then donate, but don‚Äôt just assume something that you aren‚Äôt even sure about.\n\nI also want to address that some tourists and travelers think that all Hawaiians/locals are the same. The answer to this comment is no we aren‚Äôt. Specifically to this comment ‚ÄúHawaiians in general, can suck a boner.‚Äù Let‚Äôs be clear, not all Hawaiians will act the same way you do. Us Hawaiians and locals would love for you to come to the islands and visit with your family, please do, but do not disrespect our culture, traditions, and lifestyles. And some tourists will say ‚Äúwe felt so unwelcome and we aren‚Äôt coming back.‚Äù These comments really surprised me because im not sure how we‚Äôre supposed to make them feel ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù. Just out of curiosity, are we just supposed to greet you with a genuine smile or maybe a lei everywhere you go? Lets be clear, coming to Hawaii is a choice that you make, and if you do decide to come, the please come, but don‚Äôt expect to be entitled to feeling ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù everywhere you because you want to feel the ‚Äúaloha spirit‚Äù. All we ask when you come, is to respect us, our culture, and our ƒÅina.\n\nThank you,\n\nMai\n\nMai (local)\n\nOctober 9, 2023 at 5:38 pm\n\nI left hawaii for this reason. I‚Äôm japanese and i dont stick out much to locals but when i moved there during covid i got so much hate from people who i would talk to socially. i couldn‚Äôt tell anyone what my job was or where i was living because i didn‚Äôt realize how bad the economic disparities were. i was pretty embarassed for myself looking back, i am only glad that i didn‚Äôt post about it on tiktok or something like ‚Äúcome move to hawaii with me‚Äù like so many social media influencers do. I didn‚Äôt know the island was facing so much modern day colonization. i could sit here and say the same thing happens in san francisco but its really not the same at all. it probbaly was a few decades ago when there were actual indigenous people there but the ive learned that government is so corrupt and hawaiians are owed reparations for what was done to them. honestly there should be some huge tourist tax or just tax people who have multiple homes there. when i moved there and was renting, it was in a really nice beach area in one of the most expensive spots on oahu, and the owners were never around. there was a girl who lived on the property to check on maintenance and stuff but she told me that this was one of the MULTIPLE homes that the owners had and it kinda made me sick. i moved away to hopefully make room for people who are native or born or raised there so hopefully start some generational wealth and stop being dependent on an industry that chooses profit over the people.\n\nSara Taneguchi\n\nOctober 9, 2023 at 5:38 pm\n\nI thought about whether I should comment or not, and I really don‚Äôt think my comment will make any difference, but here goes.\n\nI‚Äôm from Brazil (my grandmother came from indigenous tribes) and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, I‚Äôve always felt connected to Hawaii. Maybe it‚Äôs because I grew up seeing the suffering that my ancestors went through in Brazil, and thinking about all the suffering that the Hawaiian people went through.\n\nIt was always my dream to visit Hawai‚Äôi, and as you said, I didn‚Äôt have the money or the opportunity. Until this year and I had the greatest pleasure in the world to visit the Big Island.\n\nSince I set foot on the island I could only cry. It was an emotion that I don‚Äôt know how to explain. And I‚Äôm crying right now again writing all of this. Being there and feeling the songs, seeing up close a story that I previously only knew from books or documentaries was something out of the ordinary.\n\nI can say that I felt the Aloha‚Äù. We try our best to buy/go to local restaurants. Because it is possible to feel everything you described in the text. Everyone treated me so well, maybe it‚Äôs because they felt my love and respect for the island.\n\nI would like to apologize for all those who do not treat the island or the locals with the same respect. And I would like to thank all the wonderful people who found my way on this journey. The hugs from strangers when I was crying with emotion. Hearing ‚Äúmahalo/aloha‚Äù and only good things, feeling like they were being spoken from the heart. I will never be the same person after this place!!! I will be eternally grateful!\n\nAna\n\nOctober 2, 2023 at 8:44 am\n\nI am amazed at how entitled people are. How hard is it for someone to understand that Aloha is a 2 way street? Why expect it if you don‚Äôt even understand it or give it? Your vacation is never more important than your attitude or the people who live there (and whose home it is in the deepest sense of the word). I‚Äôm not even Hawaiian in the least bit, it‚Äôs just really not that hard to understand. No wonder the ‚ÄúUgly American‚Äù tourist trope exists.\n\nNot Hawaiian or haole\n\nSeptember 9, 2023 at 1:19 pm\n\nSacred rocks and hula hoops what a joke. Of course your white masters don‚Äôt respect the silly traditions of ungrateful savages.\n\nTywoyesesozo\n\nAugust 30, 2023 at 3:47 pm\n\nTo those who are using this comment thread as a platform to express, ‚ÄúYou say you don‚Äôt want us but look ‚Äì you actually NEED us‚Ä¶‚Äù have some compassion. People are suffering. Whether your agree with them on not, whether you like them or not ‚Äì show kindness.\n\n‚ÄúLearn to do good, seek Justice, correct oppression, bring Justice to the fatherless, and plead the widow‚Äôs cause.‚Äù Isaiah 1:7\n\nPerhaps if we stopped worrying about receiving respect from people who have been pushed down for generations and started offering respect without expecting reciprocation, we‚Äôd begin to mend a broken fence.\n\nPraying for Maui.\n\nHeather\n\nAugust 25, 2023 at 8:19 am\n\nI‚Äôve been to Hawaii twice and had a great time. Because I‚Äôm Asian and dressed like a non-tourist I think I flew under the radar a little. But I could tell when talking with locals it was a bit icy. Now I better understand why.\n\nKeith\n\nAugust 17, 2023 at 3:36 pm\n\nI have a bucket list of places that I would like to travel to before I meet my maker, and Hawaii is on my top 20.\n\nHowever, I understand the resentment by native Hawaiian‚Äôs towards tourism. My mother (GOD rest her soul) came from Puerto Rico, and I hate what tourism has done to island. I hate that non natives own all the good land, and have beautiful mansions, while the natives are basically a permanent underclass.\n\nIMHO, Hawaiians (like my friends and family in PR) have suffered many historical wrongs at the hands of non natives, and they should be allowed to live their lives without a bunch of entitled tourist ruining their islands. I know, its never going to happen, but I would like to see every square inch of land on Maui and the surrounding islands returned back to native Hawaiians.\n\nI realize that many people, especially white people from the mainland are going to be upset with a blog like this, but the truth is often hard to hear. Tourism doesn‚Äôt help native Hawaiian‚Äôs and no amount of liberal talking points is going to change that.\n\nIf I never get to visit Hawaii I can live with that ‚Ä¶ preserving the eco system of the islands is way more important than a few pic‚Äôs of myself on a beach at sunset. I think I can do more good just by donating to a few Hawaiian charities and organizations.\n\nLouis Arroyo\n\nAugust 17, 2023 at 3:36 pm\n\nSo funny all the comments on here getting angry and not one of them addressed the part with all the links of tourists in the news stealing sacred lava rocks or getting too close to the seals. Got a lot of talk saying how they disagree with the authors but won‚Äôt comment on the literal factual news articles of tourists using our fire department & putting our underpaid medical first responders on the line & desecrating & disrespecting our land.\n\nMy family lives on homestead land and we talk all the time about how the economy could ‚Äútank‚Äù as you guys are saying and we wouldn‚Äôt care at all. We grow our own food and own our land. Thats all we need or want. Like go ahead and stop coming. We encourage it. It will just leave Hawai‚Äôi to the real Hawaiians left or anybody else who really wants to be here. All this big talk from visitor acting like we eat outta their hand. Go ahead and leave. From a 6 generation Kanaka Oiwi, please don‚Äôt come here & be so entitled. If you already have a ticket, just spend money and go home. The charities mentioned above are good. There are alot of other good ones too.\n\nJordyn\n\nAugust 15, 2023 at 1:24 pm\n\nTo the author, Thank you. Sincerely. And, please hear my heart when I say I‚Äôm hurt and upset. Not at you, but at tourists who don‚Äôt deserve the right to visit such a sacred place in the first place and have ruined so much for so many. People who have no heart, wherever they travel, whatever they do. People who think it is okay to take up beds at shelters in the name of VACATION while they have a perfectly good airline ticket to return home. Instead, after such a tragedy they still expect to go on excursions while on the same island thousands of people are in deep mourning. People who SNORKEL just off the shore of Lahaina while first responders and volunteers and are still in the process of active search and rescue. Shame on you, people who wouldn‚Äôt understand Kokua in any language. You actually don‚Äôt deserve to set foot on such sacred ground. Never did.\n\nGrowing up in California, I am fortunate to have visited the islands several times over the past 30 years and was hoping to return again in October. You‚Äôll have to take my word for it but I‚Äôm not just a respectful traveler, I believe in service as a lifestyle. Which is why for me it is so hard to contemplate never visiting such a sacred place again. It has been a temple for me‚Äîliterally saved my life as an adolescent by getting to experience the incredible beauty and energy on the islands‚Äîchanged me.\n\nHowever, knowing how real the sentiment is from native Hawaiians, we are in the process of cancelling our travel plans to Kauai for October, maybe forever, out of Aloha, love, and respect. And, as always, we would have done all the right things mentioned in some of these posts: community service; shopping local; demonstrating love and respect to people and nature. I just wish there was another way. I wish the government could put a sustainable cap on the number of visitors allowed per month (like a visa). Put taxes directly into the hands of locals. Practice actual Stewardship. But money is the root of all kinds of evil so I guess I‚Äôm not surprised that responsible tourism management hasn‚Äôt happened.\n\nI also wonder if my decision not to return to this place that I care so deeply for, that awakes my soul, just opens up one more seat on a plan for someone else who will not understand or treat the place and people I love with nearly as much respect my family and I would. I wish there were applications required to visit Hawai‚Äôi. People like me will hear you loud and clear, and stay away. People without the ears or eyes to understand will still come, and do the same selfish stupid shit that they do everywhere they go.\n\nTo the comments comparing places like California, Colorado, Florida and so many other places‚Ä¶ You aren‚Äôt wrong. But Hawai‚Äôi is different. I probably couldn‚Äôt win a research based scientific debate on the topic against you. But I‚Äôm right. :)\n\nI realize Hawai‚Äôi rightfully belongs to Native Hawaiians. And my sincere hope is that you gain independence and return the Kingdom of Hawaii to a sovereign nation. If that happens I also hope you‚Äôll consider the right way to allow people to experience real Aloha‚Äîas we are all ultimately citizens of the world here on Earth, and for such a brief moment.\n\nSincere Aloha! (And, prayers and tears) ‚Äì Sean\n\nSean (Haole)\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 11:13 am\n\nSome people have to move to Hawaii. My husband and I moved because he was stationed here at Schoffield with the 25th. He is over in Maui helping RIGHT NOW. We are white. I‚Äôm trying to do as much as I can right now to help. However, my husband went over to help, so did everyone. Yes we are Haoles, but I can tell you this hatred you see online is not the majority because they‚Äôve shown nothing but kindness since we‚Äôve moved here. When there is any natural disaster or people need help, the national Guard, Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, and Army all go in without question and their families know they may not return. Due to the state of the world I don‚Äôt know if my husband will be sent off and go to war, however I know his sacrifice and it‚Äôs our sacrifice too. They don‚Äôt hate everyone from the mainland or from other countries because whenever I have met someone they thank him and Mark told me everyone is thanking him. They don‚Äôt hate all Haoles, they know there are people that genuinely care for the community and would do anything for it. My husband and I are one of them. As long as you are respectful and understand that there are places you should honestly not go then they‚Äôre cool. Also, know your limits don‚Äôt go to the beach and try out a 10 ft wave if you‚Äôve just learned how to surf‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not Haoles mindset thats just plain stupid mindset. Like going up to take a selfie with a bison‚Ä¶stupid is what stupid does. All in all they really are kind here, just like anywhere as long as you respect their culture and environment.\n\nCaroline\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 11:13 am\n\nI understand and empathize with the hatred the hawaiians have toward tourists as I know what irresponsible tourism means and that civilians don‚Äôt see the money.\n\nThis is my question, have you ever been to Florida? We don‚Äôt see the money. Like you, some irresponsible tourists come and go to our coral reefs and they are damaged, they‚Äôve fished on the beaches and off shore bringing sharks closer to our waters making us the shark capital of the world for shark attacks, they chum the water bringing sharks, we have people by the millions flock our roads in Orlando and Miami making it harder to get to work, we are theme parks, and they have colleges come yearly with drunk kids.\n\nYes this boosts are economy, we have learned to accept it, learned they have devastated our national wildlife parks, but we have no voice because the wealthy talks. So if you don‚Äôt want us to visit- don‚Äôt visit Cali (they have same situation), NY (devastation in tourism is real there), Chicago (talk about murder capital), how about South Africa and any country that has a safari?, or Italy (no one is kind to their culture), Mexico/Peru/Costa Rica (some tourist litter), Thailand/Japan/China (some will go to sacred sites and take selfies)- in China people have gone to the forest that people are known to kill themselves and there is a heavy presence of iwu there.\n\nStaying in one place for the rest of your entire life, never visiting, and being a RESPONSIBLE tourist that shows respect to the culture and locals-to get an understanding of the atrocities they‚Äôve gone through but also appreciate the wildlife is also irresponsible.\n\nThat leads to people thinking they are the best because they are close minded. No country or culture is clean and perfect throughout history. While people that don‚Äôt appreciate your culture should never come, those that want to learn and educate themselves should. Therefore they can learn the world is far greater from themselves. To appreciate nature, to see the depletion of coral reefs and that 90% will be gone by 2050. Someone from a landlocked state or country may read/hear this, but if someone they trust tells them this isn‚Äôt true who are they to believe if they don‚Äôt see it with their own eyes.\n\nWe need to protect the world and show the devastation that man has created. Creating travel semesters where tourists may not travel that way everything can recover a bit may be helpful. However, we can‚Äôt stop everyone from visiting new places. That would be along the same parallel as banning books and erasing history. Humans need to know their history so we can try not to repeat itself-even though history repeats itself all the time. However that‚Äôs just my take on it.\n\nIsabella\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 5:54 am\n\nI don‚Äôt think any of the angry haoles commenting on this blog post are even reading it. The post is called ‚ÄúHawaii doesn‚Äôt WANT tourists.‚Äù All these idiot commenters talking about how tourism is 21% of Hawai‚Äôis economy when one simple Google search will tell you Hawaiis native people don‚Äôt see any of that money. The money might as well not even go there at all.\n\nReading the comment from the deplorable human saying they‚Äôll laugh in the rear view of their mustang, I hope your plane doesn‚Äôt make it.\n\nIt is absolutely valid for Hawaiians to ask for money and tell you not to come. We owe them reparations for stealing their land and holding their queen hostage. I encourage the author of the blog post to not approve any more ignorant comments from idiots.\n\nThe people who are comparing tourists in San Diego and nantucket to tourism in hawaii has to be a joke. Or any of the ‚Äúnative Las Vegas person here!‚Äù Like no you‚Äôre not. The indigenous people of that place are long gone because of you. Native Hawaiians are experiencing colonization and the killing of their people RIGHT NOW and you uneducated tourists don‚Äôt want to listen. Why do tourists not want to be told that they aren‚Äôt welcome?\n\nBiggest colonizer mentality. I‚Äôm so sorry for the rude comments. This blog post has every right to complain about tourist. Maybe they‚Äôre offended because the blog post is accurate. If you guys weren‚Äôt stepping on heiau and moving there and asking for local discounts and having the biggest level of entitlement I‚Äôve ever seen, they wouldn‚Äôt be having their conversations. STAY OUT OF HAWAII. You‚Äôre obviously not wanted.\n\nWhy do most of the hate comments have fake emails? If you‚Äôre going to say that shit, say it with your name and don‚Äôt be a coward.\n\nCasey\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 5:08 am\n\nThe gods reply was wildfires.\n\nAmerica\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 5:08 am\n\n‚ÄúIf you like Hawaii, f*ck off. We would still appreciate your money, so please donate to these charities while still f*cking off. Did we mention to f*CK off?‚Äù\n\nLOUD AND CLEAR\n\nDrinkinswish\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nI appreciate reading this article as I‚Äôve read and learned much about the history of Hawaii in the past weeks. In addition, I learned more about the history of Hawaii during one of my tours in Hawaii in Oahu specifically last month. I did visit Hawaii, and I respected the land and fell in love with it. I didn‚Äôt know anything about the history until I got there. The tour guides are incredibly informative and it saddens me to learn this on vacation!\n\nI never felt unwelcome. In fact, they make you feel so happy and welcome they make you want to return over and over again if you could. I tried to eat local as much as I could, and tipped as best I could.\n\nTime has passed since I returned home, and as I‚Äôm settling in, and trying to find ways to help Maui even after donating some money,\n\nI worked three jobs for a year and a half to save money just to take my 18-year-old autistic son because he begged me to go to Oahu when he graduated high school.\n\nI wish I knew then what I know because while I want to help you preserve your culture and land, I also don‚Äôt want to be somewhere I not considered a ‚Äúcolonizer ‚Äú as if I was not alive over 100 years ago and created the current situation. I‚Äôm the daughter of immigrants!\n\nI never knew that the money I was spending there wasn‚Äôt helping anyone!\n\nI respect your feelings and the land, and empathize with the hardship in Hawaii, and especially with what Maui is experiencing right now.\n\nTo the people that are speaking harshly to the innocent people in the mainland, remember, tone is everything and there are many people on this side that are really looking out and want to do better and help on your side. They want to help and make change for you. Just like there are a handful of people that are rude, there‚Äôs a huge outpouring of people that are kind helpful and just want to be there and be kind and hopeful.\n\nLastly, as we can see many people visit Hawaii, and even when I was there, it‚Äôs not only people from the mainland, I can‚Äôt tell you how many Japanese were they are spending a fortune in the malls and stores. According to a tour guide, much of the revenue from the Ala Moana Mall goes education in Oahu.\n\nI‚Äôm sure people from the mainland will slowly stop visiting Hawaii. Just remember, as I previously stated, it‚Äôs not just people from the mainland, while I was there the majority of people that were there weren‚Äôt even from the United States. There were so many different languages being spoken, There are people from all around the world visiting, trying to embrace that beautiful culture and island.\n\nI came home with this wonderful feeling of how wonderful the Hawaiian people are with so many beautiful things to say about them. How wonderful they treated me how beautiful your land is ‚Ä¶. Feelings of positive energy and grace‚Ä¶\n\nThose feelings quickly went away after seeing all those rude comments on social media. Please don‚Äôt come back at me and say that I‚Äôm comparing or being inconsiderate my about the disaster because what happened in Maui was a horrible act of nature and I was already home and trying to help from here!\n\nWhat the people in Maui are doing in unity is an act of humanity, which is what happens after destruction. When the government gets their shit together (damage is accounted for) humanity takes over first! Keep in mind, iyou already see they don‚Äôt let go of tourism dollars, do you think they‚Äôre gonna let go of the money that people are donating right away or the things that people are bringing in barges involved right away. They need to account for everything every last thing. The bigger the bulk, the longer it takes to count and that is truly sad. Government sucks anywhere and everywhere ‚Äì in Hawaii, New York, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Greece, Peru ‚Ä¶anywhere.!!! stay strong,!! Stay united because that‚Äôs what destruction does show you your strength. You‚Äôre a strong as your problem!\n\nRegardless of how your people have made me feel now, I still pray for everyone‚Äôs well-being\n\nCathy\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nInteresting perspective. But let‚Äôs not forget Hawaii is currently an official US State and US citizens from anywhere have a right to visit as we please. Now I do not intend to mean that we should do as we please when there. I am a responsible tourist and respect both nature and people whenever I travel with my family. Your unwelcoming attitude along with others locals is quite ridiculous. You do not own the land. No one does. I pay federal taxes that are currently going to be used to rebuild Maui. You‚Äôre not going to stop me from visiting whenever I want to and quite frankly I don‚Äôt care if you hold up a sign telling me to go home. I‚Äôll laugh at you in the rear view mirror of my mustang convertible.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not a disrespectful person, but if my family is facing disrespect from a local while we are spending our hard earned dollars on our family vacation ‚Äì I‚Äôll fight back.\n\nYou should spend some time learning about the economics of your home island and you‚Äôd know that 80% of your economy is either directly or indirectly supported by tourism. Don‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt tell me (a responsible and respectful tourist) where I can and cannot vacation. You just sound stupid. The audacity to list charities for helping Hawaii and at the same time telling us to go home. Get a clue. See you on my next trip and I am praying for the people of Lahaina currently.\n\nJ\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nI and my family went to Hawaii in1999. My parents also went in 1997 and we all enjoyed it very much. Well, if what I just read is true, I have just too much respect and appreciation to ever return. How deplorable and intrusive. I‚Äôm very sorry for that, and also for the comments of any rude bloggers.\n\nAaron Williams\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nEnd-stage capitalism and global over population are both core issues here.\n\nPlus many powerful people are simply not that nice.\n\nDrusus\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nThis article makes some very broad assumptions. First, I could say the same thing where I‚Äôm from in Southern California. My ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù little beach town in North San Diego was considered a ‚Äúworking class‚Äù town before urban sprawl and the influx of people moving South from both the Bay Area as well as LA Counties. Our home prices are currently up over 500% from around 1999-2000. I wish no one would come to where I live but unfortunately population growth coupled with low cost travel has affected us all. Additionally, people want to visit areas of the US that are beautiful (weather, beaches, etc).\n\nThis article downplays the importance of tourism dollars into the local economy. Tourism is greater that 20% of Hawaii‚Äôs economy and is its largest industry. Without it, roads, schools, jobs would be greatly affected just from the tax revenue alone.\n\n‚ÄúTourism is the largest single source of private capital for Hawai‚Äôi‚Äôs economy. In 2019, Hawai‚Äôi‚Äôs tourism economy has recorded. ‚û¢ State Tax Revenue: $2.07 billion (1.4%,$28.5 million YOY versus 2018). ‚û¢ Visitor Arrivals: 10,424,995 (+5.4% YOY versus 2018).‚Äù\n\nWhile it may be wishful thinking, tourism is only going to increase and like I experienced in my not-so-small anymore So Cal town, you better learn to make lemonade out of the lemons you are referencing in you are going to be in for a lifetime of disappointment.\n\nJustin\n\nAugust 14, 2023 at 4:53 am\n\nI am appalled at the ignorant comments on this blog post. Before you comment anything, did you even read the article? Native people are asking you not to come? DONT COME. Are you stupid? Colonization isn‚Äôt okay now and it never has been. Tourism dollars obviously don‚Äôt help native people. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand. The comment saying you‚Äôre booking a flight to Maui, you‚Äôre disgusting. Stay home. They are suffering right now and don‚Äôt want or need you.\n\nKristi\n\nAugust 12, 2023 at 8:39 pm\n\nIt seems a little short sighted to think tourism isn‚Äôt needed for the local economies, even if you aren‚Äôt in an industry supported by it. However, being someone who works in the hospitality industry, I understand lots of people are just not respectful in general, and although it‚Äôs not the majority, they are the ones who are remembered. I can understand why the locals would feel this way. We will be visiting in a few weeks and tried to be mindful of booking tours with locally owned companies and will try to eat at locally owned places. We will most definitely be respectful of the lands and traditions as we are merely guests in someone else‚Äôs home.\n\nJonathan Matte\n\nAugust 12, 2023 at 8:28 pm\n\nIt‚Äôs sad what they have done to Hawaii, and they are trying to do the SAME THING to Puerto Rico, but don‚Äôt get it twisted. At the end of the day, we are Latinos and if we ousted a Governor, trust and believe that we will fight this.\n\nMelissa\n\nAugust 12, 2023 at 8:28 pm\n\nThat‚Äôs okay I‚Äôve been there before several yrs ago & never really cared for it way too humid & people there seemed rude just like the person in this article who doesn‚Äôt want us there & says all the other locals don‚Äôt want us there but now since your state is being blown away from the wildfires don‚Äôt expect the rest of the states then to help you out financially. Your paradise state can help itself out, I‚Äôm done with states & countries with a disaster & talks about tourists behind their back saying they don‚Äôt want them there then beg us for financial help when they have a disaster well you Hawaiian people can help your ownselves out. I‚Äôm done with haters, kidnappers, thieves, murderers & rude, mean belligerent people!!!! And here I was going to send you a big donation for your fire in Maui but guess what honey? I‚Äôve decided not to after reading this nasty awful article. Good luck with all the wildfires going on there I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be plenty more.\n\nKenna\n\nAugust 12, 2023 at 2:41 pm\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."
