        "text": "White sand beaches, lush mountainscapes and an array of indulgent resorts – what’s not to love about Hawaii! A top choice for luxury beach holidays, Hawaii packs a punch with its sheer range of activities, rich culture and cuisine. Discover its Aloha spirit with us, as we dive deeper into each of its four main islands – The Big Island, Kauai, Maui and Oahu.\n\nBut first, you’ll need to decide where to go in Hawaii. Seeking adventure and exhilarating hiking trails? Or perhaps you want to learn more about the region’s rich culture? Or, maybe you’re keen to have some fun in the sun, and go island hopping. No matter what your interests are, here are our top Hawaii travel tips from our experts to help you make an informed choice.\n\nThe Big Island (Island of Hawaii)\n\nBest for: Hikes, volcanoes, Kona coffee\n\nThe Big Island is thought to have been formed around 400,000 years ago and its terrain is rife with dramatic volcanoes. It is home to the world’s most active volcano: the 1200-metre-high Kilauea.\n\nExploring the island’s rugged wilderness is a big part of the experience here. Add a wide range of activities to your agenda, from discovering otherworldly lava tubes to hiking up Mauna Kea for truly incredible stargazing. You could also journey around the turquoise-coloured coastline in a sea kayak or embark on a snorkelling adventure to spot green sea turtles and manta rays swimming among brightly-hued corals.\n\nIf you’re intrigued by ancient ruins, visit Puako Petroglyph Archaeological District on the Kohala Coast. Here you’ll find more than 3,000 petroglyphs, many of which were etched close to a millennium ago.\n\nMaui\n\nBest for: Romantic getaways, culinary experiences, underwater adventures\n\nMajestic Maui, with its multi-coloured sand beaches and epic sunrises from the Haleakala Summit, has long been a popular honeymoon spot.\n\nIt’s not just a great place for romance; some of the best snorkelling and diving can be experienced along Maui’s idyllic shores too. For guaranteed sightings of marine life, incorporate a boat trip to Molokini into your itinerary. This semi-submerged volcanic caldera hosts Hawaii’s only marine sanctuary and it’s teeming with schools of vibrant fish.\n\nMaui’s crystalline waters are also some of the best places to spot humpback whales. You’re most likely to see these gentle giants leaping above the waves between December and April, on whale-watching tours led by knowledgeable marine experts.\n\nNo holiday to Hawaii is complete without sampling some of its culinary delights. The Hawaii Food & Wine Festival held in Maui (and two other islands) in September and October is a great opportunity to enjoy cuisines from across the globe and sign up for cooking classes from well-known chefs.\n\nOahu\n\nBest for: Surfing, Hawaiian culture\n\nWondering where to go in Hawaii for for some sun, sand and surf? Oahu is the answer. It’s the atoll’s most populous island and Honolulu, the state capital, sits on its southern coast. Visit the WWII memorials in Pearl Harbour, tour the USS Missouri (the last battleship to be commissioned by the USA), and relax by Waikiki Beach. The crescent-shaped bay is lapped by some of the most impressive waves in the region, making it a hotspot for both amateur and pro surfers.\n\nPrefer an activity that’s a little less adventurous? The shoreline of Waikiki Beach is fringed by resorts, shops and dining spots. For a more relaxed holiday, take a trip to Kailua Beach on Oahu’s northeast coast. The stretch of powdery sand is straight out of a postcard, and its crystal-clear waters host numerous sea turtles. Elsewhere on the island, you’ll have the chance to ride a cycle along the edge of an extinct volcano or hike to Manoa Falls for a refreshing swim in its tranquil pool.\n\nKeen to experience Hawaiian culture on your trip? Allow us to incorporate a guided tour of Honolulu’s Iolani Palace – the USA’s only royal palace – into your itinerary.\n\nKauai\n\nBest for: Stunning vistas, film locations\n\nKauai is nicknamed the “Garden Island” and it’s easy to see why as you take in its sweeping, untouched landscapes. More than 75% of the island is inaccessible by car and it’s much less developed than the other three major islands. This makes it a great pick if you want a peaceful break away from the hustle and bustle of Hawaii’s larger resorts.\n\nThe 17-mile-long Na Pali Coast on the island’s North Side is particularly scenic and can only be reached by foot or by sea. Follow trails that weave their way through Kauai’s magnificent interiors or allow us to book you a catamaran ride that gives you access to the area’s idyllic beaches and enchanting sea caves.\n\nFilm buffs are sure to fall in love with Kauai. Several popular films such as Blue Hawaii, Jurassic World, Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and so on, were shot in the scenic locales of this island. Watch your favourite movie scenes come to life as you bask in the island’s mesmerising beauty.\n\nThe island offers its fair share of adventure activities too. Kauai’s Waimea Canyon is a great place for a hike, with several trails of varying lengths and difficulty levels. You could also choose to explore the island’s resplendent rainforests on a zip-lining adventure, or hop on to a rubber tube as you whizz past subterranean tunnels that were first carved out in the 19th century.\n\nGo on a holiday to Hawaii this year\n\nCan’t wait to explore Hawaii? Get in touch with our travel experts and we’ll curate your personalised getaway to this glorious corner of the globe."
