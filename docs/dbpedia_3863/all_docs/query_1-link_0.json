        "text": "Identification of the progenitors of plants endemic to oceanic islands often is complicated by extreme morphological divergence between island and continental taxa. This is especially true for the Hawaiian Islands, which are 3,900 km from any continental source. We examine the origin of Hesperomannia, a genus of three species endemic to Hawaii that always have been placed in the tribe Mutisieae of the sunflower family. Phylogenetic analyses of representatives from all tribes in this family using the chloroplast gene ndhF (where ndhF is the ND5 protein of chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase) indicate that Hesperomannia belongs to the tribe Vernonieae. Phylogenetic comparisons within the Vernonieae using sequences of both ndhF and the internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA reveal that Hesperomannia is sister to African species of Vernonia. Long-distance dispersal northeastward from Africa to southeast Asia and across the many Pacific Ocean island chains is the most likely explanation for this unusual biogeographic connection. The 17- to 26-million-year divergence time between African Vernonia and Hesperomannia estimated by the DNA sequences predates the age of the eight existing Hawaiian Islands. These estimates are consistent with an hypothesis that the progenitor of Hesperomannia arrived at one of the low islands of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain between the late Oligocene and mid-Miocene when these islands were above sea level. Subsequent to its arrival the southeast Pacific island chains served as steppingstones for dispersal to the existing Hawaiian Islands.\n\nDNA Sequencing.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses were conducted by using sequences of the chloroplast gene ndhF (ndhF is the ND5 protein of chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh leaves (14), followed by purification in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients. DNA extractions from herbarium specimens and silica-dried leaves were performed (15). Amplifications were performed in 50 μl with 1 μl of unquantified genomic DNA, 20 pmol of primer, 1× Tfl polymerase buffer, 0.5 units of Tfl polymerase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), 10 mM of MgCl2, and 0.2 mM of each dNTP. The first thermal cycle consisted of 3 min denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 50°C, and 1 min and 20 sec of polymerization at 72°C. This cycle was followed by 34 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min and 20 sec, followed by a final extension cycle of 72°C for 7 min. The amplified DNA was purified by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and the GeneClean II system (Bio 101). The purified PCR product was sequenced by the snap-chill method (16) using sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical product no. 70770) and 35S-dATP labeling.\n\nAmplifications of the ITS region used primers ITS5 and ITS4 (17) as modified by Downie and Katz-Downie (18). Complementary strands of the ITS region were sequenced by using primers P2, P3, P4, and P5 (17). For tribal level analyses, the chloroplast gene ndhF was amplified by using two primers, −52 and +607, and sequenced with 12 forward primers (19). For intergeneric comparisons within the Vernonieae, only the highly variable 3′ end of ndhF was sequenced.\n\nDNA sequences were aligned manually in macclade (20) for both ndhF and ITS data. The ITS sequences also were aligned by using clustal v (21) followed by minor manual corrections. The boundaries of ITS-1 and ITS-2 were determined by comparing the aligned sequence with published sequences from other Asteraceae (22). macclade was used to calculate transition/transversion ratios from the most parsimonious trees.\n\nPhylogenetic Analyses.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses were conducted by using three data sets. The aligned sequences for all data sets were deposited in TreeBASE (http://herbaria.harvard.edu/treebase/). The first data set examined the tribal position of Hesperomannia and it included the entire ndhF gene (2,235 bp) for 50 representative genera from eight tribes and all three subfamilies of Asteraceae (see ref. 23 for voucher information). Three genera of the subfamily Barnadesioideae were used as outgroups (19, 24). The two other data sets were designed to examine the position of Hesperomannia within the Vernonieae (Table ). One data set included the 3′ end of ndhF (804 bp) for two of the three species of Hesperomannia, 19 worldwide representatives of Vernonieae, and three genera of Liabeae as outgroups. The other used the ITS region and sampled the same two taxa of Hesperomannia, 16 representatives of Vernonieae from North and South America, Asia, and Africa, and one outgroup from the Liabeae. Sampling was not identical for these two data sets because it was not possible to amplify both ndhF and ITS for all available taxa. Phylogenetic analyses were performed for all three data sets by using paup (25) with all character changes unweighted. Parsimony analyses used a heuristic search with 100 random taxon additions, acctran, mulpars, tbr, and steepest descent options.\n\nTable 1\n\nSpecies*Geographic originTribe/section or subsection†Marker‡Hesperomannia lydgatei ForbesU.S.: HawaiiMutisieaendhF, ITS H. arborescens GrayU.S.: HawaiiMutisieaendhF, ITS Gutenbergia polytrichotoma Sch.

Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 replicates by using a Heuristic search and simple addition.\n\nRelationships of Hesperomannia Within the Vernonieae.\n\nThe affinities of Hesperomannia with other members of the Vernonieae were examined by using two independent sequences, 804 bp of the 3′ end of ndhF and the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat. For ndhF, two species of Hesperomannia and five genera of Vernonieae (Lychnophora, Piptocarpha, Stokesia, Gutenbergia, and Vernonia) were examined, including 15 species of Vernonia representing a wide range of taxonomic and geographic diversity (Table ). Three genera of the Liabeae were used as outgroups (19, 32, 33). The ndhF sequences included 154 variable sites, 68 of which were phylogenetically informative. Eight equally parsimonious trees of 224 steps were identified, with a consistency index of 0.81 and a retention index of 0.81. The trees indicated a strong relationship (bootstrap value of 90%) between the Hawaiian endemic species of Hesperomannia and four species of African Vernonia (Fig. ). Hesperomannia was sister to two African species (V. amygdalina and V. mesipilifolia) from subsection Strobocalyx.\n\nWe examined the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat to test the phylogenetic hypotheses suggested by the ndhF tree. The ITS data set consisted of four genera (Lychnophora, Stokesia, Gutenbergia, and Vernonia), including 12 representative species of Vernonia from all major geographic regions, two species of Hesperomannia, and one outgroup (Munnozia) from the Liabeae (Table ). The ITS sequences contained 456 variable sites, 351 of which were phylogenetically informative changes. A single most parsimonious tree was identified with 1,262 steps, a consistency index of 0.62, and a retention index of 0.64. The ITS tree (Fig. ) was congruent with the ndhF results in strongly grouping Hesperomannia with the same two species of African Vernonia from subsection Strobocalyx.\n\nDivergence Time.\n\nSequence divergences among 10 taxa ranged from 3.8% to 68.2% and 0% to −14.3% for the ITS region and ndhF gene, respectively (Table ). The high level of ITS sequence divergence was largely the result of the presence of indels and the fact that the highly conserved 5.8S coding region was not included. Relative rate tests indicated that a molecular clock was not rejected in most pairwise comparisons (Tables and ), including all those involving Hesperomannia and African Vernonia. The average sequence divergence between Hawaiian Hesperomannia and African Vernonia subsection Strobocalyx was 1.2 ± 0% and 20.20 ± 0.8% for ndhF and ITS, respectively. The average pairwise ITS sequence divergence between these two clades was about 17 times higher than the ndhF sequence divergence. Intrageneric divergence of Hesperomannia (0.38%) was about 29 times less than in Vernonia (10.97%). Although there has been considerable debate on rates of ITS sequence divergence (34–37), we selected the average rate of 0.78% nucleotide substitutions per myr proposed by Sang et al. (36) in Dendroseris for three reasons: (i) Dendroseris and Hesperomannia are in the same family (Asteraceae), (ii) both are endemic to oceanic islands, and (iii) species in both genera are woody, thus minimizing the effect of generation time on substitution rates. The divergence time between African Vernonia and Hesperomannia based on ITS sequence data was estimated to be 25.89 ± 1.03 myr ago. For ndhF we used the average rate of 0.05–0.07% per myr suggested by Wendel and Albert (38) and Seelanan et al. (39), which resulted in a divergence time of 17.14–24.0 ± 3.43 myr ago. The divergence time based on the nuclear sequence was only 1.08–1.5 times older than that estimated for ndhF and the two estimates are within each others’ SE. We also estimated divergence times within Hesperomannia. The divergence times for the ITS (4.91 myr) were again older than the estimate for ndhF (1.81–2.54 myr).\n\nTable 2\n\nLychVjonStokVposVchiHlydHarbVmesVamyVpop Lych0.0240.1080.0700.0330.0650.0650.0620.0620.046 Vjon0.3050.0880.0410.0120.0680.0680.0620.0620.034 Stok0.4370.3690.1340.0150.1430.1430.1360.1370.119 Vpos0.4230.3520.5270.0340.1030.1030.0960.0960.080 Vchi0.3110.2760.4440.3510.0750.0750.0720.0720.043 Hlyd0.5480.5050.6430.5240.5590.000*0.0120.0120.046 Harb0.5200.4960.6370.5390.5580.0380.0120.0120.046 Vmes0.5450.4460.6460.5230.5690.2170.2120.0000.040 Vamy0.5160.4540.6500.5200.5290.1960.2070.1100.040 Vpop0.5240.5160.6820.4940.5200.4480.4650.4310.431\n\nTable 3\n\nLychStokVjonVposVchiHarbHlydVmesVam LychNDNDNDNDNDNDNDND Stok0.007NDNDNDNDNDNDND (0.214) Vjon0.0010.008***NDNDNDNDND (0.068)(0.201) Vpos0.0040.0080.036NDNDNDNDND (0.077)(0.227)(0.061) Vchi0.0010.0080.0010.004NDNDNDND (0.057)(0.215)(0.041)(0.066) Harb0.0070.0100.000.0040.007NDNDND (0.081)(0.224)(0.078)(0.076)(0.081) Hlyd0.0090.0110.0090.0060.0090.001NDND (0.080)(0.224)(0.077)(0.073)(0.079)(0.121) Vmes0.0120.0110.0120.0120.0120.0140.006ND (0.079)(0.223)(0.072)(0.054)(0.077)(0.025)(0.029) Vam0.0120.0110.0120.0090.0110.0160.0110.0001 (0.078)(0.224)(0.073)(0.072)(0.079)(0.022)(0.016)(0.051)\n\nTable 4\n\nLychStokVjonVposVchiHarbHlydVmesVam Lych***ND***NDNDNDNDND Stok0.055***ND***ND*********(0.013) Vjon0.0070.071******NDNDNDND (0.018)(0.012) Vpos0.0330.0030.059***************(0.010)(0.014)(0.008) Vchi0.0050.0590.0240.043NDNDNDND (0.007)(0.013)(0.004)(0.009) Harb0.0000.0490.0130.0280.003NDNDND (0.009)(0.015)(0.010)(0.028)(0.010) Hlyd0.0000.0490.0130.0280.0030.005NDND (0.009)(0.015)(0.010)(0.012)(0.010)(0.002) Vmes0.0070.0540.0070.0340.0030.0160.016ND (0.009)(0.015)(0.010)(0.012)(0.010)(0.004)(0.004) Vam0.0070.0540.0070.0340.0030.0060.0160.001 (0.009)(0.015)(0.010)(0.012)(0.010)(0.004)(0.004)(0.002)\n\nPhylogenetic Position of Hesperomannia.\n\nPrevious workers considered Hesperomannia a close relative of several South American genera of Mutisieae, especially Stifftia, Stenopadus, and Wunderlichia (10–13). Our DNA phylogenies (Figs. – ) disagree with all previous studies and clearly indicate that Hesperomannia is closely allied to Old World species of Vernonia. The Vernonieae includes approximately 80 genera and 1,450 species, 900–1,000 of which are in the genus Vernonia (40). Vernonia includes two subgenera, Vernonia from the New World and Orbisvestus from the Old World (41). Several features distinguish these two subgenera, including basic chromosome number, sesquiterpene lactone chemistry, and morphology of the styles and pollen. Comparison of Hesperomannia with members of the Vernonieae provides convincing independent support for a close phylogenetic relationship with Old World species of Vernonia. Both have a chromosome number of n = 10, pollen with a continuous micropunctate tectum and echinate exine, and long slender styles with acute or obtuse tips.\n\nThe DNA phylogenies (Figs. and ) suggest a sister group relationship between Hesperomannia and African species of Vernonia subsection Strobocalyx. This subsection includes 28 species, 25 of which are distributed in tropical Africa with the remaining three species in Burma, China, and India (41). Despite the limited number of species examined, we believe that the phylogenies from two independent DNA markers provide strong support for a sister group relationship between Hesperomannia and African species of Vernonia for four reasons: (i) our sampling includes two of the three species of Hesperomannia and taxa from all of the major geographic areas and 12 taxonomic sections of Vernonia (Table ); (ii) support is very strong for both markers (Figs. and ); (iii) levels of sequence divergence are much lower between Hesperomannia and African species of Vernonia section Strobocalyx than between any species of Vernonia examined (Table ); and (iv) Hesperomannia and all African species of subsection Strobocalyx have type A pollen, whereas two of the three remaining Old World species (from Burma and India) have type B pollen (41).\n\nBiogeography and Evolution of the Hesperomannia.\n\nDespite the remarkable geographic distance between the Hawaiian Islands and the African continent, our molecular phylogenies strongly suggest a biogeographic connection between these two areas. The Hawaiian flora, which includes approximately 1,000 native species of flowering plants within 88 genera and 211 families (2), is derived exclusively from long-distance dispersal. Floristic affinities of the Hawaiian flora have been estimated to be 40.1% Indo-Pacific, 16.5% Austral, 18.3% American, 12.5% Pantropical, 2.6% Boreal, and 10.3% unknown (3, 4). The latter category includes plants that have been isolated long enough to have no apparent living relatives and probably includes some of the earliest immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nSupport for the possibility of a biogeographic connection between Hawaii and Africa is provided by recent molecular phylogenetic investigations of the Malvaceae (39), which demonstrate a robust relationship between the East African-Madagascan genus Gossypioides and the Hawaiian endemic genus Kokia. Seelanan et al. (39) proposed that Gossypium diverged from the Kokia/Gossypioides clade approximately 12.5 myr ago, but that Kokia and Gossypioides diverged much more recently, in the Pliocene. Such a relationship implies long-distance dispersal, which might be either directly to Hawaii or via islands in the archipelago that now are submerged. Floristic affinities between the South Pacific island of New Caledonia and Africa (42) also indicates a biogeographic connection between these areas.\n\nDispersal of the ancestor of Hesperomannia from Africa to the Hawaiian Islands seems unlikely given that these areas are currently separated by approximately 15,000 km. Carlquist (43) suggested that birds were the most likely dispersal vector of Hesperomannia, an hypothesis that achene morphology appears to accommodate. The fruit is small enough to be eaten by birds, and the dry achene surface is resistant enough to be viable after passing through an animal’s digestive tract. The achenes are too large and lack buoyancy for transportation over great distances by normal wind or air currents (44, 45). However, some members of Vernonia subsection Strobocalyx have a pappus of flattened bristles, which certainly would be conducive to wind dispersal. Bird migration pathways between the Pacific Oceanic Islands and Africa have not been proposed. Early workers (46–49) suggested several possible colonization routes to tropical Pacific islands. One of the main routes was from the New World. The other hypothesized route was that tropical Pacific land birds originated from the west, mainly from New Guinea southeastward to the Bismarcks, Solomons, New Hebrides, and Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThere are two likely hypotheses for long-distance dispersal of Hawaiian Hesperomannia. In the first, the New World served as a steppingstone from Africa during mid to late Tertiary when the Atlantic Ocean was considerably narrower than at present. This hypothesis is more or less congruent with divergence times estimated by using the two molecular markers in this study. The distance at that time may have enabled easier travel for the vector across the Atlantic Ocean. However, dispersal to Hawaii still would be difficult because there is no land along the Pacific coast of the New World except for the Galapagos, Juan Fernandez, and the few inshore islands (50). Another difficulty with this scenario is that there are few similarities between the biotas of Hawaii and South America. In the second hypothesis, the Hawaiian/African connection might be explained by long-distance dispersal via southeast Asia and the many Pacific island chains. It is likely that the biota of the tropical Pacific Oceanic Islands is derived primarily from the west (3) because numerous island chains eastward from New Guinea served as steppingstones for the transportation of propagules by birds. A possible dispersal route could have been northeastward in Africa to southeast Asia and finally to the Hawaiian Islands by using the many southeast Pacific Island chains as steppingstones. Under this scenario the possibility that the actual ancestor of the Hawaiian Hesperomannia already might be extinct is highly likely. It may, as pointed out by Fosberg (3), represent one of the oldest lineages in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nTime and Island(s) of Origin.\n\nThe Hawaiian Islands have existed as a group for at least 70 myr with spacing and location similar to that found today (51, 52). Colonization between older and younger islands is not considered to be continuous during this time period (53). Only the past 29 myr are thought to be relevant for understanding the origin of the endemic biota of Hawaii. The age of the eight current high islands ranges between 0.4 and 5.1 myr old (53–55). The divergence time (17–26 myr) between Hesperomannia and African Vernonia estimated by our ndhF and ITS sequence data predates the oldest high island, Kauai, on which H. lydgatei is found. Thus the ancestor of Hesperomannia is unlikely to have originated on one of the current islands. The estimated divergence times between Hesperomannia species (1.81–4.91 myr) is more recent than the ages of the current islands, which also supports our hypothesis that the ancestor existed on older sunken islands and arrived to the high islands recently.\n\nThe geology of the Hawaiian archipelago provides a framework to develop a scenario regarding the time and place of origin of Hesperomannia. Magma perforates the Pacific Ocean Basin plate, forming a series of discrete volcanoes as the plate moves slowly over the hot spot. This process has produced islands of various ages from Hawaii (0.5 myr old) to Kure atoll (29 myr) in the Hawaiian Ridge to the older Emperor Chain seamounts. As a result, a series of consecutively produced islands have been available for interisland exchange for many millions of years, much longer than previously was assumed to be the case with the extant high islands (4). Our estimated time of divergence of 17–26 myr for the Hawaiian and African clades would make any island between French Frigate Shoals and Midway atoll likely sites for initial arrival and establishment.\n\nIf the proposed scenario is correct, the dispersal of Hesperomannia ancestors occurred between the late Oligocene and mid Miocene when now-sunken islands in the Hawaiian archipelago were high above sea level. The estimated divergence time is consistent with the general view (56–60) that the family Asteraceae underwent explosive radiation and dispersal during or near the Oligocene/Miocene border. The extreme morphological changes subsequent to this dispersal have made it difficult to identify close relatives of Hesperomannia. Nevertheless, the close genetic relationship between Hesperomannia and Vernonia subsection Strobocalyx clearly shows ancestral connections between the Hawaiian Islands and Africa."
