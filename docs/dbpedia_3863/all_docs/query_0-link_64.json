        "text": "In its first part this paper discusses the rationale for the recognition of traditional water management structures in the light of the realities of water management and supply in South Africa’s rural areas. Based on the findings of two case studies it is argued that customary arrangements form part of the social adaptive capacity of communities and can aid integrated water resource management. In the second part, the relationship between traditional water governance structures and South Africa’s new National Water Act is explored and the case is made that South Africa’s law and policy framework supports the recognition of traditional water governance structures as part of the overall water management strategy. Based on these arguments, in its final part, the paper debates the role for traditional leadership in water management in the cross-over zone between traditional rural customs and the new democratic governance and service delivery structures in South Africa. Key words: tradit...\n\nThe concept climate change has proved to be a reality. As the negative effects of climate change increases, water resources continue to dwindle. This paper explores the potential within communities to use citizen participation to formulate a legally binding local water management constitution. A case study of the Biriiri-Runhenga Water Project (BRWP) was used. The study interrogates some often taken for granted group social dynamics surrounding the formulation of projects’ constitutions, which serve as a tool for viability and functionality to ensure harmonious and sustainable sharing of water resources. The interpretive paradigm forms the major philosophical backbone of the study. A qualitative approach with limited statistical inference was predominantly used within a case study design. Focus group discussions were conducted with BRWP beneficiaries in addition to face-to-face interviews with key informants. The key informants included project committee members and local traditional leaders. A passive participatory approach by the researchers was done at several meetings held by the beneficiaries between 2013 and 2018. The study revealed the aptitude of grassroots communities to participate in matters regarding rural development and water resources management. The study revealed very low citizen participation by the ordinary grassroots community people in the process, and a top-down approach by some government bureaucrats and traditional leaders was observed. The paper recommends more judicious citizen participation in local development and natural resources management.

Thus, the management of water for communal agriculture and water supply should be well coordinated to enhance drought resilience. Notwithstanding the interrelations among water management institutions in South Africa, there are complexities in the way these institutions work together, both in preparation for, and during drought times. In this article, we examine the governance of water resources in South Africa with a view to understanding institutional coordination in drought management at different operational scales. Using a qualitative approach, the roles and relationships between water actors at the local and regional level were analyzed for their adequacy in building local level drought resilience in a village in the Limpopo province, South Africa. Key informant interviews conducted revealed operational drought management challenges that emanate from communication barriers, coordination inconsistences...\n\nDemographic and socio-economic factors influence water resources governance at the household level particularly in rural areas of developing countries where culturally assigned gender roles in water governance hold sway. Rooted in the institutional bricolage and the Mass-elite theories, this paper analyses demographic and socio-economic factors influencing the dissonance of customary and statutory institutions in the governance of water resources in the study area. Employing a homogenous purposive sampling technique, three villages (that is, Shakawe, Tubu, and Shorobe) were selected for this study. Four hundred and fifty-five household heads were randomly selected to elicit pertinent demographic and socio-economic data through an interview schedule and expert purposive sampling technique was adopted to select 9 key informants from whom in-depth information was obtained. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 was used to analyse descriptive and inferential stat..."
