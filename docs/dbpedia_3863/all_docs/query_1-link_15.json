        "text": "Where to Go in Hawaii\n\nIt may be that your only knowledge of the islands of Hawaii comes from television episodes of Hawaii-Five-O or repeats of Magnum PI, but in fact Hawaii is the perfect destination for a holiday. So where should you go in Hawaii?\n\nHawaii offers the perfect mix of pristine sandy beaches, lush green forests, mountainous volcanoes and simply the clearest waters that you have ever seen. In addition, there is plenty for those interested in modern history and culture, and Hawaii has some of the nicest and most welcoming local people in the world.\n\nHawaii has it all making it a tropical paradise that is perfect for your next holiday. Let’s look at where to go in Hawaii…\n\nAloha Hawaii\n\nThe island of Oahu\n\nThe island of Maui\n\nThe island of Molokai\n\nThe island of Lanai\n\nThe island of Kauai\n\nThe island of Hawaii\n\nFreedom’s expert view\n\nAloha Hawaii\n\nWelcome to Hawaii. Are you already dreaming of getting off the plane knowing that you have just arrived in the tropical paradise of Hawaii? You will want to make the most of your time in Hawaii so let us help you do that; starting with some quick facts:\n\nWhere is Hawaii? Although not connected to the mainland, Hawaii is an American state, so the official spoken language is English and the currency is dollars.\n\nHow do I get to Hawaii? Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, approximately 2000 miles from California and the rest of mainland USA so a flight from California to Hawaii takes approximately 6 hours.\n\nIs Hawaii an island? Hawaii actually consists of 8 major islands (one of which is called Hawaii), although there are many other smaller atolls and sand bars that also make up the state of Hawaii.\n\nWhere to go in Hawaii? Of the eight major islands, only six have the infrastructure and facilities to accommodate tourism. These are Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai, Kauai, and Hawaii (also known as the Big Island)\n\nWhich Hawaiian island is best? Each island has a different character and offers different experiences, so although you could spend your holiday on one island, it is quite common to hop between a few different islands.\n\nOahu\n\nThis island is most likely to be your first introduction to Hawaii, as most international flights arrive here. The name Oahu (O’ahu) translates as “the gathering place” which is most appropriate as nearly three quarters of Hawaii’s population live on this island and more than six million tourists visit Oahu each year.\n\nThe capital, Honolulu, and the famous Waikiki Beach make Oahu the most multi-cultural and commercial of all the Hawaiian Islands. However, just a short drive from the city it is possible to discover rainforests, mountains, valleys and beaches with spectacular waves. One of the island’s most recognisable landmarks is Diamond Head, an extinct volcanic crater that overlooks the city and is great for getting a panoramic view of the island, or the ultimate sunset selfie.\n\nOahu is great for beach lovers. The best beaches of Oahu are undoubtedly in Waikiki. From Duke Kahanamoku Beach to Kaimana (San Souci) Beach, you can enjoy the best the ocean has to offer. Whether it’s surfing, a nice swim or just a lazy day at the beach, in Waikiki you can have it all.\n\nThe poignant memorial around Pearl Harbor (Harbour) is a must for all visitors to the island. An expert guide will take you through the incidents of that ill-fated day and show you the locations and memorials that are lovingly looked after today.\n\nThe island is also renowned for its cuisine and retail experiences. Being an island where Polynesian cultures meet Western and Asian influences, food and fashion are creative, colourful and flavoursome. Waikiki Shopping plaza is a good place to start but a visit to the Ala Moana Centre is almost compulsory. Perhaps take the Waikiki Trolley to see a bit of everything!\n\nMaui\n\nThe second largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago is most famous for its beaches, exceptional hiking trails and food. Naturally quieter than Oahu, the island offers a more relaxed atmosphere with high-end hotels and untouched green landscapes in abundance. Much like Oahu the beaches on Maui are exceptional with big waves perfect for surfers and wave-boarders, but also calm coves perfect for snorkelling and spotting wildlife. In particular whales often spend the winter sheltering in the calm waters around the island.\n\nIf you travel to Maui direct from Oahu or the American mainland you may be surprised by how undeveloped the island is. This has led to a deserved reputation for secluded resorts and premium outlets. However, don’t be put off by this high-end reputation, as there is a lot to see and do on Maui that costs nothing; The Road to Hana is one of America’s best driving routes. It is a curving route around mountains, passing by black sand beaches and waterfalls. It is one of Maui’s signature adventures. In the case of this adventure, it is just as much about the journey as it is the destination.\n\nAlong the way, major attractions are the Seven Sacred Pools and waterfalls of Ohe’o Gulch. Although there are no big distances to travel on Maui, it is advised to use an entire day exploring the Road to Hana. With its many curves and lookouts, it does take some time to see it all.\n\nMolokai\n\nThe least populated of all the Hawaiian islands, more than half of the residents of the island of Molokai are descendants of the island’s indigenous population. This gives Molokai a great reputation for preserving customs, land and culture above the promotion of economic and tourism development. Whilst you won’t find the coach tours and burger bars here, all tourists to Molokai will still receive the traditional warm welcome to this peaceful and tranquil island.\n\nMolokai is and island of contrasting scenery. The eastern side of the island is very green with lush tropical vegetation, whilst the western side is predominantly grasslands and beaches. One of the most photographed attractions on Molokai is to the north of the island where the mammoth sea cliffs rise more than 3000 feet above the ocean, and create Hawaii’s tallest waterfall.\n\nFor those looking to escape from the commercial and sometimes brash approach of resorts on some of the bigger islands then Molokai is the place to come and escape.\n\nLanai\n\nSheltered from the dominant winds by the neighbouring Maui island, Lanai is largely a rural island. In fact there are only 32 miles of tarmac roads on the whole island. However, it is also home to some of the most luxurious resorts in Hawaii. Whilst there is only one town on the island (Lanai City) which is filled with artisan shops and galleries, it is the resorts and championship golf courses that draw the majority of visitors to Lanai.\n\nFor the more adventurous Lanai also provides some of the best scuba diving and snorkelling opportunities in the whole of Hawaii and the beach at Hulopoe Bay has few rivals for its natural beauty.\n\nThe island of Lanai’s other claim to fame is pineapples. For much of the 20th century the island’s economy was dominated by pineapple production and the company of Dole owned the largest plantation. Almost all residents of the island were either directly or indirectly employed by the company. By the 1980’s tourism and more sustainable industries began to take over from pineapple production but it is still possible to see some of the plantation architecture retained around Lanai City.\n\nLocal pineapples are still harvested around the island, and it is almost compulsory to try some fresh fruit on your visit to Lanai.\n\nKauai\n\nMostly covered in lush tropical rainforest, Kauai has become known as the “Garden Island”, and it tends to attract those wanting to explore nature and wildlife. As far removed from the bustle of Honolulu as possible, Kauai has a relaxing laidback vibe that attracts hikers and retreat seekers alike.\n\nThe untouched forest and coastline has long attracted Hollywood filmmakers, whilst the pinnacles of the Na Pali coast are one of Hawaii’s most photographed natural attractions. These natural towers are inaccessible to cars, so are best viewed from the ocean or from the air. If a guided kayak or boat tour are not your thing, then a helicopter tour gives spectacular views.\n\nKauai’s other major natural attraction is Waimea Canyon. Often referred to as the “Grand Canyon of the Pacific” this gorge provides spectacular views in to the gaping chasm below. If you are looking for natural wonders in the Hawaiian islands, then you have to spend some time on Kauai.\n\nHawaii (Big Island)\n\nThe largest (and youngest) of the Hawaiian Islands is twice the size of all the other islands combined, and yet it is home to less than 200,000 people. There is no doubt the biggest reason for visiting the island of Hawaii is Volcanoes National Park, home to Mauna Loa and Kilauea. These active volcanoes are why the island is naturally growing each year, as molten lava reaches the sea and creates new land.\n\nThe Kilauea volcano has been erupting consistently since 1983, but its slow moving lava flows provide both an entertaining and educational reason to visit. Not surprisingly all the island’s resorts and hotels are located on the other side of the island, so it is a journey to the National Park to see the molten lava spectacle, but then how often do you get the chance to see a new part of the world being created?\n\nHawaii’s landscape isn’t all about the volcanoes. The island also features windswept deserts, cold tundra landscapes as well as high-canopied rainforests. It is a real island of contrasts. For those in to their stargazing then Hawaii’s lack of ambient light, make for perfect viewing conditions and there are a variety of tours that you can join for experts to point out exactly what you are looking at.\n\nAway from the hills, coffee is the largest crop cultivated on the Big Island, whilst the Kona district in the south of the island is home to sun bleached properties offering boutiques and bars and the remnants of Hulihe’s palace, once a holiday home of the Hawaiian royal family.\n\nHawaii’s Big Island attracts lovers of the great outdoors, that like their natural wonders to be explosive and hot, with hotels and resorts more relaxed and homely, rather than brash and modern.\n\nFreedom’s Expert View"
