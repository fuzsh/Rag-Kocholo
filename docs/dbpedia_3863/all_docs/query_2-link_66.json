This contains the ISO code for Mubarak Al-Kabir, as shown below.\n\nFIPS 10-4 Change Notice 12, dated 2007-06-11, has FIPS codes for the new and changed governorates. The table has been updated accordingly.\n\nThe Europa World Year Book 2001 reports that a sixth governorate was created in 1999-11. Its name is Great Mubarak. No further details are provided. Other sources give its name as Mubarak Al-Kabir, and show that it was formed from the southern part of Hawalli. It was probably named for Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah, who ruled from 1896 to 1915.\n\nI have acquired more recent census data for the governorates of Kuwait.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameKUWAIT ISO codeKW FIPS codeKU LanguageArabic (ar) Time zone+3 CapitalKuwait\n\nKuwait was under British protection from 1899 to 1961-06-19, when it became fully independent.
