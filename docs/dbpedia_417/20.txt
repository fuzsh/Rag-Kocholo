WVAH-TV, virtual channel 11 (UHF digital channel 24), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Charleston, West Virginia, United States and serving the CharlestonâHuntington television market. The station is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting; the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns ABC affiliate WCHS-TV (channel 8, also licensed to Charleston), operates WVAH-TV under a local marketing agreement (LMA). However, Sinclair effectively owns WVAH as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Piedmont Road in Charleston and transmitter facilities atop Coal Mountain, south of Scott Depot, West Virginia.
