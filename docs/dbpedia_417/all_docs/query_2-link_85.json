(WCHS/WVAH) — A West Virginia native and American hero was honored Saturday in Institute.\n\nWest Virginia State University graduate and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson now has her own statue in her honor.\n\nThe life-size bronze statue was unveiled Saturday morning on West Virginia State’s campus.\n\nJohnson was depicted in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures” and is also a Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient.\n\nSaturday, fellow West Virginians gathered to honor her legacy and hear from her two daughters who spoke at the events.\n\n\"This is an amazing day for West Virginia, and all West Virginians. This is one of our daughters, and we should be extremely proud of who she is and what she has accomplished and what she has remained to be,” WVSU President Anthony Jenkins said.\n\nJohnson turned 100 years old Sunday."
