        "text": "Reporter/Producer/ Anchor\n\nI enjoy meeting new people, telling their stories and learning new facts every day. I just love news.\n\nI joined the WCHS-TV/WVAH-TV as a reporter and producer in March 2013. Before moving to the Mountain State, I spent two and a half years reporting, producing and anchoring in Rapid City, S.D. I covered the passing of former U.S. Sen. Jim Abdnor and Native American activist Russell Means, one of the deadliest police shootings in Rapid City history and the pine beetle epidemic plaguing the Black Hills.\n\nMy family is of Jamaican descent, but I was born and raised in Queens, N.Y. I received my mass communications degree from Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Ga., in 2006. While attending Clark Atlanta University, I interned at WCBS-TV in New York City every summer and winter break as an Emma Bowen Foundation Scholar. I graduated from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in Syracuse, N.Y., in 2008 with a master of science degree in broadcast journalism.\n\nWhile at Newhouse, I was able to put my inquisitive nature to use by interning for Investigative Unit Correspondent Lisa Myers at NBC Nightly News in Washington, D.C.\n\nI’m a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and the Emma Bowen Alumni Association.\n\nWhen I am not bringing people news, I am baking, cooking, shopping, hiking, reading, practicing yoga or snapping pictures around town. I have a furry child named Bailey. He is a very active and loving Yorkshire Terrier."
