Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Charleston’s leading television stations today officially began broadcasting with NEXTGEN TV, a revolutionary new digital broadcast technology. The launch includes WCHS-TV (ABC), WOWK-TV (CBS), WSAZ-TV (NBC), WQCW (CW) and WVAH-TV (Decades).\n\nBased on the same fundamental technology as the Internet and digital apps, NEXTGEN TV can support a wide range of features that are currently in development. In addition to providing a new, improved way for broadcasters to reach viewers with advanced emergency alerts, NEXTGEN TV features stunning video with brilliant color, sharper images and deeper contrast to create a more life-like experience.\n\nNEXTGEN TV adds a new dimension to TV viewing, with vibrant video and new Voice+ dialogue enhancement that brings voices to the foreground. Movie theater-quality sound lets viewers hear every voice clearly and keeps volume consistent across channels. NEXTGEN TV also can be enhanced with Internet content to enable viewers to get the most out of live sports, live news, and live events in real-time, without looking away from the TV screen.\n\nPowered by ATSC 3.0, NEXTGEN TV is the most significant broadcast technology upgrade ever. Features available on NEXTGEN TV will vary by device and station as broadcasters roll out service across the country.\n\nToday’s launch in Charleston follows a decade of development and months of planning and preparation by the local stations. WSAZ-TV, owned by Gray Television, Inc, has converted to ATSC 3.0 transmissions. WSAZ-TV will broadcast its own programming, as well as the programming of the other participating stations, in NEXTGEN TV format. All programming of all participating stations will continue to be available in the existing DTV format, which can be received on all modern television sets. BitPath, which is developing new data broadcasting services, led the planning process and coordinated efforts across the five television stations.\n\nFrom Seattle, Washington to Washington, D.C., NEXTGEN TV service is already on the air in more than 35 cities across the country. Charleston viewers can learn more about NEXTGEN TV by visiting www.WatchNextGenTV.com, which offers a guide listing cities currently carrying the service, as well as links to available NEXTGEN TV set models.\n\nAntenna viewers without NEXTGEN TV sets can simply rescan their TV sets to ensure uninterrupted service.
