CHARLESTON, W.Va., Dec. 20 (UPI) -- A television station in West Virginia's capital has apologized for airing a photo of a state legislator instead of a convicted racketeer who had the same name.

During a late-night newscast, WVAH-TV reported that a federal appeals court upheld the racketeering conviction of Danny Wells, a former Logan County magistrate, and showed Wells' photo with the news item, The Charleston Gazette reported Thursday.

Only one problem: The photo was of Del. Danny Wells, D-Kanawha, a two-term state lawmaker and retired Gazette sports editor.

Wells said he didn't see the newscast but was alerted to it by viewers.

"I'm pretty upset about it," said Wells, adding that given the tenor of politicking today, the footage could wind up in a so-called attack ad. "I'm going to talk to an attorney about it. I can't see how my reputation was not damaged by it."

Matt Snyder, news director for WVAH and its sister station WCHS-TV, said producers immediately recognized the mistake and an anchor issued an on-air retraction and apology within minutes. When Wells called about the mishap, he hung up before hearing about the apology, Snyder said.
