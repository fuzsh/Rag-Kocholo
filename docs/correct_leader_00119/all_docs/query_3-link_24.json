        "text": "Greece's socialist leader George Papandreou was sworn in as prime minister this morning amid clear indications that the new government he will lead will seek to tap talent in the diaspora to address the multiple crises facing the country.\n\nThe English-speaking prime minister, propelled into office following an overwhelming victory in Sunday's elections, is expected to announce a cabinet this afternoon to take on Greece's financial and economic crisis and social malaise.\n\nUS-born Papandreou was educated in Sweden, England and Canada and is a Harvard University fellow. His closest aides include English-speaking Greeks born and brought up in Africa, America and Australia. The 57-year-old politician is himself more comfortable speaking English than Greek.\n\n\"Part of my identity is being a Greek of Greece and a Greek of the diaspora,\" Papandreou told the Guardian. \"I think in many ways being Greek is being ecumenical, open to the world. We are a country that has always been open with ideas and contact with the rest of the world as a shipping nation and tourist destination.\"\n\nThrough his network of connections as head of Socialist International, the global grouping of leftwing parties, Papandreou has already embarked on talks with renowned experts in the fields of economy and public health. The Nobel economics laureate Joe Stiglitz is in touch with him \"on a daily basis\", offering advice on how to rescue Greece's debt-ridden economy from the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nAlso a Harvard professor and international health expert now sits in the Greek parliament following his appointment as a non-elected MP with Papandreou's Pasok party.\n\n\"George has always said there is an untapped world and that is the other Greece in the diaspora that he is going to work with, talk to and take advice from to help us get the country out of this situation,\" said Dimitris Dollis, a Greek Australian who is among Papandreou's senior advisers. \"Ties with the diaspora are going to be much stronger.\"\n\nAmong candidates for prominent cabinet roles are George Papaconstantinou, a graduate of New York University and the London School of Economics who worked at the OECD in Paris, and Louka Katseli, a former economics professor at Yale.\n\nAfter years of introspection under the outgoing centre-right government, Greece is also expected to become far more \"open and outward looking\" in its foreign policy under Papandreou, who won international plaudits back in the 90s when he almost single-handedly improved relations with Turkey by daring to pursue reconciliation.\n\n\"Being parochial is a state of mind and we want to get out of it,\" said a source close to Papandreou who will be one of his senior foreign affairs advisers. \"The [outgoing] conservatives chose to tread water in a turbulent sea, no initiatives were taken and relations with out neighbours gradually stalled. Our approach is going to be a lot more cosmopolitan, open and creative which is George's natural inclination.\"\n\nThe change in style has been welcomed by western diplomats startled by the rise of nationalism and xenophobia in Greece in recent years."
