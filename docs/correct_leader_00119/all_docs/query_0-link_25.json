Named as one of Foreign Policy magazineâs \"Top 100 Global Thinkersâ in 2010 for âmaking the best of Greeceâs worst year,\" he speaks with authority on the state of the Eurozone today and the future of the European Union.\n\nHe is vice chairperson of the International Olympic Truce Foundation, an institution he promoted when the city of Athens was awarded the 2004 Olympic Games.
