        "text": "Beijing, April 2nd—Song Tao, Minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, held a video call here today with George Papandreou, President of Socialist International and former Greek Prime Minister.\n\nSong expressed, the CPC has always maintained sound exchanges and cooperation with Socialist International, and has seen our dialogues and exchanges go deeper since the establishment of strategic dialogue mechanism. At present, the international landscape is going through profound and complex changes, with global challenges emerging one after another. The CPC is willing to, in line with the principle of “rising above ideological differences and seeking mutual understanding and cooperation”, continue to intensify exchanges with Socialist International, deepen exchanges on concepts and mutual learning, enhance understanding and trust, and jointly promote international cooperation such as the Belt and Road cooperation, so as to better benefit peoples of all countries.\n\nSong said, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the CPC. Over the past century, the CPC has led the Chinese people in exploring a path suitable to China’s conditions, and made remarkable achievements. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, China has scored decisive achievements in poverty alleviation and building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and is embarking on the new journey toward a modern socialist country. The CPC enjoys firm support from the vast number of the Chinese people for its leadership. The CPC takes the people’s yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle, attaches high importance to protecting human rights, and resolutely opposes a few countries’ interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and smearing the CPC. We are willing to reinforce exchanges with political parties and organizations of various countries, including Socialist International, and safeguard multilateralism, so as to promote world peace, stability, prosperity and development.\n\nPapandreou congratulated on the 100th anniversary of the CPC, and appreciated the great achievements the Chinese people made under the leadership of the CPC, particularly lifting all residents below China’s current poverty line out of poverty, which is a major contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause. He said Socialist International cherishes its strategic dialogue mechanism with the CPC, and is willing to cement exchanges and communication on topics such as coping with climate change, boosting sustainable development, the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and safeguarding multilateralism, and facilitate the rational dialogue between the European Union and China on human rights. Papandreou said, Greece, the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games, looks forward to the success of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, and believes that the 2022 Winter Olympics will make contributions to peace and progress of the mankind and friendship of people of the world.\n\nEnditem"
