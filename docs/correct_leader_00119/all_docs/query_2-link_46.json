        "text": "After more than seven weeks of leaderless government as the veteran Socialist leader fights against kidney failure and pneumonia, pressure continues to grow in Greece for Papandreou to stand aside.\n\nThe opposition New Democracy party has fanned the flames by tabling a censure motion, which was preceded by a three-day debate this week. Despite opposition attacks, the decision as to whether to encourage the 76-year-old Papandreou to resign lies within his own family and the ranks of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) of which he has been the undisputed leader for 21 years.\n\nThe prime minister’s son, Education Minister George Papandreou, has indicated he is prepared to discuss “political truths” with his father, but has made it clear: “I will say what I have to say to my father with respect and not in the form of an ultimatum.”He is expected to have that conversation before PASOK’s central committee meets on 20 January to discuss the way forward.\n\nThe debate over a successor has ebbed and flowed within the party, and been determined both by loyalty to the prime minister and by the tone of the frequent bulletins on his health.\n\nThis week, one report stated Papandreou’s health had slightly improved and that he was able to walk short distances. A week earlier, PASOK officials said his doctor, Health Minister Dimitris Kremastinos, had reported that the prime minister was unable to take any kind of political decision and would be unlikely to do so until March at the earliest.\n\nFinding a solution to Greece’s political stalemate is further complicated by the pivotal role played by Papandreou’s second wife, Dimitra Liani. Until she herself was recently taken ill, she had carefully vetted any access to the prime minister. Speculation is now growing that a guarantee his wife would continue to enjoy a political role, possibly as a deputy, would persuade Papandreou to resign.\n\nThe dilemma is now splitting PASOK. Last week its executive bureau said the succession procedure would open on 20 January.\n\nUnder the Greek constitution, the task of electing a new prime minister falls to PASOK’s 169 deputies and a premier may only be replaced if he resigns, or dies.\n\nAlready almost 100 of the party’s deputies have contacted the chairman of the parliamentary group, Dimitris Beis, requesting the search begin for a successor. This has prompted Beis to predict: “By the end of the month we will have a new prime minister, unless Mr Papandreou resigns sooner.”But later other senior party members openly opposed any efforts to open the succession stakes. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias took the lead, telling reporters: “I am one of those who do not put deadlines. Those in a hurry hurt themselves and PASOK.”Justice Minister Yannis Pottakis reminded deputies this week of the conditions under which a prime minister could be replaced and said that the government could function without a premier for six months. Not all ministers share that view and Transport Minister Evangelos Venizelos countered that Papandreou’s illness had created an “immense political problem” and the central committee should now give the green light for the succession.\n\nPASOK would choose the next premier in a two-round ballot. The two leading contenders are former Industry Minister Costas Simitis and Defence Minister Gerassimos Arsenis."
