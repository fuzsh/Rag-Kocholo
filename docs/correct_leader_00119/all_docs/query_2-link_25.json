        "text": "\"A new global deal on taxing the super-rich is critical, as it will reduce #inequality and raise the trillions of dollars needed to invest in development policy and a just transition to #sustainable economies.\" Here is the letter of the #ClubdeMadrid, the largest forum of democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers, to the #G20 leaders in support of the Brazilian G20 Presidency’s proposal for a new global deal to #tax the world’s ultra-rich individuals. I am delighted to be one of the signatories, among leaders from across the political spectrum like Chile's Michelle Bachelet, Sweden's Stefan Lofven, Spain's Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, France's Dominique de Villepin, Canada's Kim Campbell, Australia's Julia Gillard and South Korea's Han Seung-soo.\n\nToday, all progressive #citizens feel inspired by the developments in #France. The #progressive forces acted in #unity, and the French people said no to #authoritarianism and #neofascism. At the same time there is intense concern. The victory itself, with the uncertainty it brings, provides a significant lesson: that the major challenge is not just the victory but the formation of a credible and effective progressive governance platform against the conservatives. And the message of the citizens of France is clear: they demand ongoing #participation in decision-making, to be #democratically engaged in addressing the real and major challenges of our present and our future. This is the only credible way to provide hope and #viable prospects for our societies.\n\nWith an almost absolute majority of 127 Yes, 2 No and 7 abstentions, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted this morning a Resolution based on the Report I presented as General Rapporteur on #Democracy on the subject of strengthening democracy through #participatory and #deliberative processes. You can learn more about it and see my speech here:\n\nHere is a draft outline of a report I am preparing for the Council of Europe (PACE). It is titled 'Strengthening democracy through participatory and deliberative processes'. This report will be discussed, amended in the Political Affairs Committee, then in the Plenary Session of the CoE. Once approved it goes to the Council of Ministers to be discussed and responded to. The recommendations become common - wealth for all 46 members states. I'd be glad to get any comments or further ideas on how we promote more citizen participation in our democracies. Below is the outline in PDF form."
