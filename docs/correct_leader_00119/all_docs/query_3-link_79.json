        "text": "The Greek political crisis paralysing the eurozone and threatening to plunge Europe into prolonged financial meltdown and recession could be resolved on Friday after George Papandreou indicated he might step down as prime minister even if he wins today's knife-edge vote of confidence in parliament.\n\nAfter a day of high political drama and farce, at least one minister indicated to the Guardian that Papandreou is under pressure to stand down whatever the outcome of today's vote. News agencies reported that the socialist premier, forced to withdraw his plan to stage a national referendum on the latest Greek bailout plan, had already decided to give way to his deputy and archrival, finance minister Evangelos Venizelos.\n\n\"He was told that he must leave calmly in order to save his party,\" one source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \"He agreed to step down. It was very civilised, with no acrimony.\" One scenario circulating in the Greek capital was that Papandreou, pressed by the opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, would quit to pave the way for a government of national unity or salvation.\n\nThis short-lived administration, possibly overseen by a technocrat such as former European Central Bank vice-president Lucas Papademos, would conclude negotiations with the EU and private creditors over the final details of the second rescue plan adopted at a eurozone summit early on 27 October. This foresees a €100bn cut or 50% haircut in bondholders' holdings of Greek debt, topped up with €30bn of EU funding, to cut the country's €360bn debt to 120% of GDP by 2020.\n\nThe transitional government would have the sole purpose of ratifying the €130bn (£112bn) aid package painstakingly hammered out in Brussels last week to rescue Greece from its debt spiral. \"It's a terrible day for the party and Papandreou personally,\" one government insider said. \"We are heading for an ignominious end as tragic as the crisis itself.\"\n\nOne Athens fruit seller summed up the anger at the country's politicians being felt on the streets: \"Guillotines should be erected outside parliament. They have brought us to this point of catastrophe. We are bankrupt. We are destroyed.\"\n\nPapandreou backed down over his referendum plan as it became clear that Greece faced the prospect of going bust within weeks after EU powerhouses Germany and France threatened to withdraw further financial support for the country until after the popular vote was held.\n\nFocusing the minds of terrified politicians, the threat encouraged a swift change of stance from the main opposition leader, Samaras. The leader of the New Democracy party, who had previously vehemently opposed the rescue plan, now says he will support its passage in the 300-seat parliament. The news was welcomed by German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who have been blaming the lack of political consensus in Greece for its inability to enact crucial reforms.\n\nWith the country poised for a tumultuous few weeks and possibly months, Venizelos warned that Greece could only wait for the next tranche of EU aid – an €8bn instalment that now depends on parliament ratifying the debt deal – until 15 December. \"We have cash reserves until that date but no longer,\" he said, adding that 180 deputies would have to back it.\n\nAs a sullen political truce descended upon a febrile, angry Athens, a wan Papandreou spoke of the dire consequences of rejecting the eurozone summit accord in a rambling 45-minute address to his parliamentary group held after an emergency cabinet meeting.\n\n\"We have waged a battle of titanic proportions,\" the leader said in a speech that sounded like a swansong. \"For our country to be saved, Greeks have to enforce the commitments in the agreement we have made with our EU partners.\" Then he hit out at Sarkozy and Merkel for the humiliating way they had treated Greece since his announcement that he intended to ask the people to vote on the rescue plan.\n\nThe day began with an extraordinary statement at 4.45am local time from Venizelos, who had enjoyed a frosty return flight from Cannes with Papandreou, during which he had apparently been unable to persuade the Pasok leader to drop his bombshell decision to stage a referendum on the 27 October deal – in essence, on Greece's membership of the euro.\n\nThe pair, who had fought a bitter battle for the leadership of Pasok in 2007, were summoned to the G20 summit by an enraged Sarkozy and Merkel, who, with Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, told them they would get no more aid until Greece ratified the rescue package – and effectively set the terms of the referendum question by making it about Greek membership of the euro.\n\nIn those early hours, sitting in the VIP lounge of Athens airport, it is reported locally, Venizelos launched an attack on his premier by telling him a referendum could not and should not be held.\n\n\"Greece's position within the euro area is a historic conquest of the country that cannot be put in doubt. This acquis by the Greek people cannot depend on a referendum,\" the finance minister declared.\n\nThe onslaught on the premier sent shockwaves through Athens which woke up to headlines proclaiming the country's humiliation at the hands of Sarkozy, Merkel and other leaders.\n\nRumours swirled that the government was about to fall and that the premier was off to the presidential palace to tender his resignation. An emergency cabinet meeting was held as political parties headed for their own meetings within the Greek parliament building behind the tomb of the unknown soldier.\n\nAs angry Greeks on mopeds drove past the parliament, shouting abuse at the politicians locked in crisis talks, or sat in cafes bitterly lamenting the country's demise and virtual bankruptcy, speculation mounted that Papandreou would be forced out of office, Samaras or Venizelos would take over as premier, or the country would turn to a government of national unity headed by Lucas Papademos, former vice-president of the European Central Bank and a well-respected technocrat with a cool head.\n\nPapandreou then tried to put an end to the political chaos with his speech to Pasok deputies. They needed to understand, he said, that Greece's membership of the eurozone was at stake, but that he would never have made that the core question of his planned referendum.\n\nIf that was not confusing enough, the US-born Papandreou began insisting that he had now learned what it takes to save a country and how a positive decision on the 27 October package would bring benefits for the long-suffering Greek people.\n\nThe prime minister, listened to in stony silence, made plain that this was his ultimate goal: to get the second bailout ratified by whatever means, including a referendum if necessary. But, he later said, a general election would be a \"catastrophe\" and a \"wider consensus\" was vital.\n\nHe was swiftly followed by Venizelos who laid out the political stakes more succinctly and clearly: the new rescue plan cutting €100bn from Greece's €360bn debt must be approved. He later said a snap election would render this impossible.\n\nLast night, from Cannes, José Manuel Barroso, European commission president, and Herman Van Rompuy, European council president, waded into the political fray by insisting that Greece \"needs to stick to the agreed package\" of 27 October.\n\nAntonis Samaras\n\nGreece's main opposition leader, has much in common with his rival and former roommate George Papandreou.\n\nHe doesn't drink or smoke, he speaks perfect English, and he was born into a family of pedigree. Both men attended the same US school and universities, reputedly shared the same girlfriends, and now live in Athens's affluent northern suburbs. But the similarities end there. While Papandreou is a progressive socialist, the 60-year-old leader of New Democracy is a hardcore fiscal conservative with nationalist views.\n\nSamaras, a Harvard-trained economist, is the first to say that despite their past friendship, he has nothing in common with Papandreou's outlook or politics – not least the leader's \"slavish\" endorsement of the recession-inducing austerity measures demanded in return for the aid Greece so desperately needs from the EU and IMF.\n\nFor the rest of the eurozone, the two men's failure to see eye to eye has played a pivotal role in exacerbating the economic crisis that has engulfed the country for almost two years.\n\nFrom the start, Samaras has opposed the \"growth through austerity\" remedies dished out for Greece, sparking accusations that he has put personal ambition before national interest. With the prospect of a national unity government now looking a distinct possibility, Greece's international creditors know that Samaras's views count more now than at any other time.\n\nOn Wednesday, as the Papandreou government began to collapse, the conservatives began to change tune, offering to support the bailout to safeguard Greece's future in the eurozone. But as Samaras called for Papandreou's resignation last night, the two men looked as far apart as ever."
