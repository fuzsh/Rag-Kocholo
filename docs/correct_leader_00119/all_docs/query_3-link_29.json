        "text": "\"Today I want to send a message of optismism to all Greeks. Our road, our path, will be more stabilised. Our country will be in a better situation. We will be stronger,\" Mr Papandreou said in the televised address.\n\nPhilippos Petsalnikos, current speaker of the Athens parliament, has been widely tipped to replace Mr Papandreou as prime minister. Although Mr Papandreou did not name a successor, he added:\n\n\"I want to wish every success to the new PM and the new government. I will support this effort with all my strength.\"\n\nAn official announcement, due at 6pm GMT, has been pushed back to tomorrow morning.\n\nPressure has mounted on Greece's two main political parties this afternoon to wrap up three days of critical power-sharing talks and name a new prime minister to take over at the helm of an interim government.\n\nOver the past couple of days, attention has focused more on Rome than on Athens amid concerns that Italy's economy was heading the same way as Greece's.\n\nThe fear that Italy is running out of time to get a handle on its debts hit markets in Europe hard Wednesday even though Italy's Premier Silvio Berlusconi pledged to stand down, echoing a similar decision from Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou.\n\nGreek officials defended the time it was taking for the new unity government to be established. Greece's big two political parties, the Socialist PASOK party and the conservative New Democracy, are renowned for their opposition to each other and have rarely worked together since the rejection of the monarchy in 1974."
