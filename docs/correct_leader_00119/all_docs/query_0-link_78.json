        "text": "Prime Minister George Papandreou addressed a special meeting of his cabinet this morning to discuss the new budget-reduction measures proposed by the Government and the approval of the IMF and EU joint loan mechanism. Here are some selected excerpts from his opening address:\n\n- “Avoiding bankruptcy is a red line for our nation”\n\n- “We have waged a battle of credibility and we have won”\n\n- “The decision of the European Union on the 25th March was decisive and historic for Greece, but also for Europe”\n\n- “I know that with the decisions today our citizens must suffer greater sacrifices. The alternative, however, would be catastrophe and greater suffering for us all”\n\n- “I have never sought to come to power for power’s sake, only to contribute. I’m not interested in sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice”\n\n- “My only goal is that when I turn over power, I will have done what is right—and we will have created together a different and much better Greece”\n\n- “At the end of my time in office, Greece will not be bankrupt—it will be reborn”\n\n- “I must stress again that Greeks have always come through difficult times both stronger and victorious. This is the case today, too. This is why I have every confidence in the strength of Greece”"
