        "text": "A new political party formed by George Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister in 2009-11, would get enough votes to enter parliament in a general election to be held on 25 January, according to an opinion poll published at the weekend.\n\nPapandreou announced on Saturday (3 January) that he was setting up the Movement of Democratic Socialists. In an opinion poll conducted just before the official launch of the party, 6.1% of those surveyed said that they would vote for the party (the threshold for entering the Greek parliament is 3%). Most of those who said they would back the Movement of Democratic Socialists were traditional supporters of PASOK, the centre-left party of which Papandreou was leader and which was founded by his father Andreas in 1974.\n\nThe return of Papandreou is likely to further complicate the political situation in Greece. The general election was called after the parliament failed to elect a new president in late December (the government’s candidate was Stavros Dimas, a former European commissioner). But according to opinion polls, the two largest parties do not have enough support to gain a majority. The far-left Syriza, which secured 16.8% of the vote in the 2012 general election, is on course to win 30.4% of the vote. The New Democracy party of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, which became the biggest party in 2012 with 18.9%, is currently polling at 27.3%.\n\nThe polls put the communist KKE on 4.8%, the centre-left To Potami on 4.7%, and the far-right Golden Dawn 3.8%. The biggest loser could be PASOK, which won 12.3% of the vote in 2012 but is predicted to get just 3.5% this time around. However, 22% of those polled are either undecided or would support independent candidates.\n\nIn a statement, Papandreou said that he wants to respond “effectively to the major challenges” of Greece. He added that his party would “work in the next parliament to ensure all necessary conditions for a safe and permanent exit from the [economic] crisis”.\n\nSeveral prominent members of PASOK have joined Papandreou’s new party, including Filippos Sachinidis, a former finance minister, and Dimitris Reppas, a former minister for infrastructure, transport and networks.\n\nPapandreou – the third member of his family to have served as Greece’s prime minister and PASOK’s leader in 2004-12 – has been critical of the party’s leadership in recent months. Evangelos Venizelos, the leader of PASOK and also Greece’s finance minister, said that Papandreou’s decision to create a new party was “very sad”.\n\nGreece’s problems have been the subject of much attention across Europe, as Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Syriza, is an outspoken critic of the austerity measures demanded by Greece’s international creditors.\n\nOn Sunday (4 January), German media reported that Chancellor Angela Merkel said a Greek exit from the eurozone was “inevitable” if Syriza won the election. However, German government officials said that Athens must continue to meet the requirements of its bailout schemes.\n\nFrançois Hollande, France’s president, said today (5 January) that “Greeks are free to choose their own destiny” but that “there are certain engagements that have been made and all those must be…respected”."
