        "text": "Georgios Papandreou (born Feb. 13, 1888, Kaléntzi, Greece—died Nov. 1, 1968, Athens) was a Greek liberal politician who served three terms as prime minister of his country and who established a political dynasty that spanned three generations.\n\nPapandreou studied at the University of Athens (L.L.D., 1911) and in Germany. He began his political career in 1915, served as governor of the Aegean Islands (1917–20), and was minister of education (1929–33) in the liberal antimonarchist government of Eleuthérios Venizélos. He broke away from the left wing of the Liberal Party and in 1935 founded the Democratic Socialist Party. During the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, he was in exile, and he was imprisoned by the Germans in 1942–44 during World War II. Managing to escape, he then headed the Greek coalition government (initially a government-in-exile) from April 1944 until after the German army withdrew from Greece in October 1944, but he resigned in December of that year as the country slipped into civil war. From 1946 to 1952 he held ministerial posts in several governments. During a subsequent period in opposition, he merged his Democratic Socialist Party with the Liberal Party and in 1961 organized a new centre-left coalition, the Centre Union."
