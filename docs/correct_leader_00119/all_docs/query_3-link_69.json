        "text": "Papandreou, Andreas Georgiou päˌpəndrāˈo͞o [key], 1919–96, Greek political leader, premier of Greece (1981–89, 1993–96), son of George Papandreou (1888–1968) and father of George Papandreou (1952–). He was jailed and tortured in 1939 and left for the United States in 1940. He was a naturalized American citizen for a time (1944–64) and taught economics in the United States, but he renounced his U.S. citizenship to serve in the Greek parliament and as an aide to his father. He was imprisoned after the 1967 military coup led by George Papadopoulos, then exiled.\n\nIn exile Papandreou formed what later became the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok). He returned to Greece after the fall (1974) of the junta and later served as the country's first socialist premier (1981–89). After leaving office he was tried and acquitted on charges of instigating the loss of government funds and accepting bribes. He overcame a personal scandal as well and, surprising many, again led Pasok to an electoral victory in 1993. In 1995 his health declined seriously, leading to a prolonged hospitalization, and in Jan., 1996, he resigned as premier.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.
