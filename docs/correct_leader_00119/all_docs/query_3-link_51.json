        "text": "ATHENS, Greece — Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Sunday agreed to step down and political leaders will meet Monday to form a new unity government to end the political crisis, the president’s office said.\n\nThe deal was reached after a meeting lasting nearly two hours between Papandreou, main opposition leader Antonis Samaras and President Carolos Papoulias, the Greek head of state.\n\n“An agreement was reached to form a new government to immediately lead the country to elections after ratifying the decisions taken by the European Council on October 26,” the president’s office said in a statement.\n\nThis is a reference to a hard-fought EU deal reducing Greece’s monster debt by nearly a third which had been placed in jeopardy by the political uncertainty in Athens, with European leaders threatening to withhold loan funds shielding the country from a looming bankruptcy.\n\n“Prime Minister George Papandreou has already stated that he will not lead the new government,” the president’s statement added.\n\n“Tomorrow there will be a new communication between the prime minister and the head of the opposition on the new prime minister and the new government.\n\n“Tomorrow the president will hold a meeting between political leaders,” it added."
