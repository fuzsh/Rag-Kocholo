Elton Brand surrendered his roster spot to allow a rookie to experience the NBA this season. Now, the team will harness that selflessness as a Player Development Consultant.

However else you see him, Elton Brand was, is, and will forever more be a class act. When he signed onto the team a year ago, it was with the full intention of helping the rookies transition from very structured NCAA basketball programs, to the less structured but far more demanding NBA environment. When he announced his return to retirement, it weighed heavily upon the hearts of many. One final act of selflessness, surrendering his spot on the 15 man roster to allow a rookie to take his place and play for the team.

Selflessness. Nobility. In the end, that’s his trademark throughout his career in the NBA. Elton Brand carries himself as few can in professional sports. Incredible Dignity.

And so, it was with wonderful to learn that Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Bryan Colangelo announced today that the organization has agreed with former Sixers forward Elton Brand to name him Player Development Consultant.

Tomorrowland

Ultimately, the Philadelphia 76ers are a team of tomorrow. But tomorrow will end up at the same mistakes as the past unless players learn from those mistakes. Elton Brand will see to it that they do.

Brand spent five of his 17 seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. His first stint was through the 2008-2012 seasons. His second term was the second half of last year’s season.

In this role, Brand will take the lead in assisting young players in every facet of their on- and off-court development, in addition to other responsibilities within the basketball operations department.
