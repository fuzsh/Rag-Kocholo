        "text": "“What I’ve learned is that GM job has got many facets, and that it’s a learned skill. It’s certainly got a public-facing nature to it, but management and very strong relationships are important,” Sixers managing owner Joshua Harris told ESPN on Aug. 27. “Very few people who are not sitting GMs have all of those components.”\n\nIn a little over three weeks, Harris and company have pivoted from that in the most extreme way possible, announcing that Elton Brand, who retired as a player less than two years ago, will be the team’s new general manager.\n\nThe news was first reported by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, with a source confirming the promotion to The Athletic Philadelphia.\n\nThe fact that the Sixers decided to go with an internal promotion is hardly surprising, as Harris and head coach Brett Brown have jumped at every chance they’ve been provided to talk about the confidence they have in the executives left over from Bryan Colangelo’s front office. That they went with Brand, who has little experience in this aspect of the sport to which he’s devoted his life, comes as a surprise.\n\nAfter spending training camp with the Sixers prior to the 2016-17 season, the second time in his career Brand had played under Brown, Brand announced his retirement from playing professional basketball in October 2016. He was hired by the Sixers, first as a player development consultant, less than two months later in December 2016, then promoted to general manager of the Delaware 87ers (now Blue Coats) in August 2017.\n\nAfter one season as general manager of the Sixers’ G-League affiliate, Brand was promoted just three weeks ago, adding on vice president of basketball operations responsibilities with the Sixers to his duties as GM of the Blue Coats.\n\nAll of which means Brand has precious little experience in the basketball operations department of an NBA team, inexperience that would seemingly contradict the statements made by Harris just a few short weeks ago. It also means we have very little to evaluate Brand’s competency on. It’s difficult enough to evaluate the role assistant general managers or vice presidents of basketball operations have with their previous clubs, even those who have been in the NBA for a decade or more. Doing so with a general manager who hasn’t held a high-level position with an NBA team is virtually impossible.\n\nBut when luring an assistant general manager away from a competitor and handing them the keys to the franchise, you’re counting on the experience they’ve accrued in a well-run organization paying off in a big way. With Brand, the Sixers are turning one of the most unique and attractive executive openings in recent memory over to a relative rookie at his craft.\n\nNone of which is to say that Brand isn’t smart, a hard worker, or a student of the game. People within the organization have been raving about Brand’s work ethic from the moment he joined the Sixers’ front office in 2016, long before anyone expected a spot at the top of the organization’s basketball operations department to open up. It’s fair to talk to people who have worked with Brand and assess him as an up and coming star, an executive with a bright future in the league who may very well be GM material down the line. But it would be almost unfair to expect Brand to have the institutional knowledge you would typically expect from the lead executive tasked with putting the finishing touches on a team many hope, if not expect, to seriously contend in the future.\n\nAt this stage of his career as an NBA executive, how many other teams would have considered Brand as a candidate for their open general manager position? That’s not necessarily a fair question to ask, as having spent the last twenty months working with Brand in his organizational roles, the Sixers have a better gauge of his ability than any other team would.\n\nBut that’s also why general manager searches tend to be wide and exhaustive, as there might be ten other such undervalued, or unknown, candidates around the league who could blow you away in an interview if given the opportunity. Harris showed little interest in performing such an exhaustive search, telling ESPN last month that the Sixers were “going to have a pretty selective list. This is not going to be huge tournament.”\n\nSo instead the Sixers, who went into the summer talking about how attractive their general manager opening was, went with the candidate with the least amount of experience of anyone they could have hired, to lead their team into one of the most exciting periods in franchise history. That doesn’t make it the wrong choice – Danny Ainge had no front office experience before joining the Celtics as their executive director of basketball operations in 2003 – but it does make it a decision fraught with risk and uncertainty.\n\nBrown’s role going forward\n\nEarly Tuesday afternoon at his annual media luncheon, Brown was adamant that he would not, and should not, be the team’s general manager going forward.\n\n“This is not something that interests me. I do not believe, in the role that I have as head coach, that it’s tenable,” Brown said when talking about maintaining his role as interim general manager in addition to head coaching duties. “I don’t feel this is best for the club. I’ve been very transparent about that, to owners, to you all, and I haven’t pivoted out of it. So the notion of ‘Can it work? Can’t it work?’ It can’t work.”\n\nBut few really expected Brown to be announced as the team’s long-term general manager, to be left doing the day-to-day grunt work for a job that can eat up 80+ hours per week of one’s life during most of the year, in addition to his responsibilities as head coach. The much more relevant question is whether Brown would have final say over personnel decisions, essentially the right to have to sign off on any move the team makes going forward. Brown was less forceful Tuesday in his denial that such an arrangement was possible.\n\n“The org chart, and how lines go, will also be revealed when we talk about the new general manager,” Brown said when asked whether he would have final say in the new arrangement. “I’ve done what I’ve done because I believe in either style of play, or trying to fight for a player. I haven’t always gotten my way, and nor do I think I should. I do think my voice needs to be heard.”\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers seemingly worked as hard as they could to make the most attractive job opening in recent memory as unattractive as possible, placing so many restrictions around what the incoming GM could, and could not, do that it was sure to give pause to some of the highly qualified candidates who otherwise would have been beating down the door to guide what should be a long-term contender.\n\n“[The GM job] does come with some questions about, well, they got a head coach in place for a while. There’s an existing front office that’s very respected so far. What thumbprint can a new guy really have on stuff? This is all true,” Brown acknowledged, talking about the restrictions a candidate would have on being able to build out their own staff.\n\nSome of it, such as the security of Brown himself, is entirely understandable, and expected. The improvement the Sixers have made over the last two years has been real, and Brown has earned respect around the league as he not only kept the team together over a difficult stretch of losing, but also showed his merits as a game-day tactician as the Sixers grew into a legitimate force in the NBA’s Eastern Conference. He earned the contract extension he received last spring and deserves the security to see it through.\n\nBut limiting how much say a potential general manager candidate has over their own staff makes you question whether Harris and the Sixers’ owners were really, legitimately interested in hiring an external candidate of merit to run the basketball operations department.\n\nOver the past few months “collaboration” has become the buzzword du jour around the Sixers and their GM search. It’s a bit misleading, as virtually all organizations are looking for a lead executive willing to delegate responsibilities and aggregate opinions before making a decision. The Sixers are not unique in that desire. Where the Sixers are unique is in the role the head coach is likely to have, both in future decision making and in the hiring process of the general manager who would, ostensibly, be his boss.\n\n“A lot. Absolutely. All day every day,” Brown said when asked Tuesday whether he was part of the selection process in the search a new general manager, before then being asked whether a coach having a say in that process is typical. “I don’t know. I just know that in the situation that I am in it is the case, and it should be the case. This isn’t a typical life that we’ve kind of lived.”\n\nWhen the Sixers discuss the new power structure at Thursday’s press conference, they’re likely to talk up Brand’s authority and downplay Brown’s role in the decision making process going forward. It makes sense, for all parties involved, to frame it that way. Doing so wouldn’t undercut Brand on his big day, keeps pressure off Brown if things go sideways and allows him to focus on coaching, rather than field questions over personnel moves, and prevents the ownership group from having to assuage fears that many fans and pundits alike have over a coach having too much say in player personnel decisions. Even if all future decisions have to be approved by Brown before being enacted, it does everyone involved a disservice to openly talk about that being the case.\n\nBut when you take a step back and look at which figure, Brown or Brand, the Sixers are more invested in, which person has a higher likelihood of being a fixture with the team going forward, the answer is quite obviously Brown. If placed in a “collaborative” setting where they all have the ear of Harris and David Blitzer, it would be a tough battle for Brand to make a decision that Brown was truly, adamantly against. Whether that’s formalized in an organization chart is beside the point. It’s all about who has the most influence over the ownership group.\n\nAnd such an arrangement would make sense. Elite sitting GMs such as Daryl Morey would likely view sharing decision making responsibilities with the head coach, and not being able to build out their own staff, as non-negotiable, something that could also be a sticking point for assistant GMs who have been on the short list as GM candidates for years. But a candidate looking at a rapid, unexpected rise, skipping multiple levels of the typical basketball executive life cycle who may not get that same rapid advancement opportunity from an outside franchise? It’s easier to get those concessions in that scenario, if it’s the best opportunity a candidate like Brand has before him for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt’s understandable that Brown, now entering his sixth season as the Sixers’ head coach and working alongside his third general manager, would want some say in the hiring process. That’s especially true given the reports that the previous general manager, Bryan Colangelo, wanted to replace Brown as head coach. “How do we find continuity? I’m really, really looking for a partner. I’m really looking for a consistent partner,” Brown said on Tuesday when talking about what he was looking for in a candidate.\n\nViewed through this lens and it starts to make sense for the parties involved. Brand gets to lead a high-profile team during what should be a very successful time for the organization, and Brown gets a partnership with an executive he has a history with, and one who is willing to make the concessions to secure Brown’s authority and job security, both of which are now at an all-time high. Both Brown and Brand are universally well-liked and viewed as hard workers, both of which count for something even if the relative inexperience of the group is a concern.\n\nThe Sixers will view this as the safe decision to make, to keep the current front office intact and to find someone who they have confidence can work in conjunction with Brown. In some ways, it is. The team is well-positioned for the future, which tends to make people risk averse.\n\nBut my perspective is slightly different. If, say, the Sacramento Kings were to go out and make a change at the top of their organization, and it didn’t work out, the mistake would cost the Kings a few years as they look to undo the moves made and the opportunities missed. But a decade from now few would truly lose sleep over that time lost by a franchise that has been stuck in mud for the longest of times.\n\nThe Sixers, on the other hand, are on the precipice of greatness, set to make a run of sustained success this franchise hasn’t seen in the lifetime of most of the fans reading this article. They may not get this opportunity again in the foreseeable future, which adds urgency and importance to the upcoming decisions needed to be made over the next twelve months. Hiring a general manager with virtually no experience is a risk, as is giving a coach, any coach, too much of a say in player personnel decisions. It isn’t just a lack of bandwidth that makes doing so risky, but also a recognition that the perspective of a coach and that of a general manager need to be different. It’s hard for any one person to sufficiently take both sides into consideration.\n\nThese concerns have almost nothing to do with either Brett Brown or Elton Brand as individuals, as basketball minds, as workers or as leaders. Maybe Brand truly is the best basketball mind available to the Sixers at this time, a gem hidden in their organization, someone whom the ownership group doesn’t need a track record of performance to determine his talent and readiness. And maybe Brown is the rare coach who can balance dealing with the day-to-day shortcomings of a team while also maintaining the longest view in the room. Neither would be the first in their new roles to do so. But betting on both of those being the case is quite the risk for the Sixers to take at this crucial moment in the franchise’s history.\n\nTop photo: Elton Brand (right), Delaware Blue Coats GM, representing the Sixers at the 2018 NBA Draft lottery.
