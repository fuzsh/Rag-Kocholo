        "text": "Brand cited an interesting inspiration for his work habits — the streetball legends of New York where he grew up. Many of the best regularly wowed crowds on playgrounds around the city with fancy moves and deep threes well into their late 30s even if they didn’t make it to the NBA. “There’s a lot of old guys where I come from,” Brand said. “I come from Riverside but I also played streetball and guys like ‘Half Man Half Amazing,’ — not Vince Carter, the real one [Anthony Heyward] — they would drink beer at halftime but they showed me so much love and how to play hard and not take things for granted.”\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers announced today the team has agreed to terms with free agent forward Elton Brand. Over 17 NBA seasons, Brand has appeared in 1,058 career games with 868 starts, posting averages of 16 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks per game. He has played 34,910 career minutes, which ranks him 67th all-time. Brand was also the recipient of the 2005-06 Joe Dumars Trophy, presented each season to the player who exemplifies the ideals of sportsmanship on the court."
