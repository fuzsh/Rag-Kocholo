        "text": "Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations Mitch Kupchak is stepping down to become an organization advisor, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Many league executives are expected to be considered by the Hornets, including Philadelphia’s own Elton Brand.\n\nThe Hornets, as many know, have been a mess internally for a while. Multiple players there have been in the news for all the wrong reasons. But it should be a somewhat intriguing position for some, as they have legitimate young talent in the form of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller to go along with what should be another high draft pick this year.\n\nAlong with Brand, Woj reports that the Hornets are expected to focus in on several sitting general managers, including New Orleans’ Trajan Langdon, Cleveland’s Mike Gansey and Clippers’ Trent Redden. Their search will include a few current assistant GMs, with the likes of Washington’s Travis Schlenk and Sacramento's Wes Wilcox among the candidate pool.\n\nThe Hornets are due for a massive shakeup, between a new basketball operations regime and Michael Jordan’s sale in his majority stake. They’re also in the midst of a $275 million arena renovations and have plans to build a new $60 million practice facility.\n\nBrand rapidly climbed the Sixers’ front office ladder after his second player retirement in 2016. He began as a player development consultant in December of 2016, later being promoted to general manager of the Delaware 87ers (now Blue Coats). A year later, he won the Sixers’ vacant general manager position and has been there since.\n\nNow, there’s a chance Brand will get another opportunity to be the lead decision maker for a franchise looking to turn the corner.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe Charlotte Observer’s Rod Boone reports that Philadelphia’s Elton Brand and New Orleans’ Trajan Langdon are ‘early front-runners’ for the Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations position:\n\nPer a source, the Hornets prefer a lead executive with previous experience and the early expectation is for the organization to hire a president as well as a general manager. The Observer has also learned New Orleans Pelicans GM Trajan Langdon and Philadelphia 76ers GM Elton Brand — who are no strangers to the Carolinas — are considered the early front-runners to replace Kupchak.\n\nBoone goes on to mention that Brand’s previous G League experience could provide him an upper hand in the interview process. The Hornets have developed several players utilizing the Greensboro Swam, the G League affiliate of the Hornets. Before taking the job with the Sixers, Brand was in charge of the Delaware 87ers."
