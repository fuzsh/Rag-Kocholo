        "text": "The Knicks could be looking within the Sixers' organization during their GM search.\n\nTeam president Leon Rose has reportedly \"targeted\" Sixers GM Elton Brand for the same role with the Knicks, according to Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News. The report went on to say that Rose would wait to see if Brand, 41, would be let go after this year's playoffs.\n\nIt's a little hard to imagine the Sixers parting ways with Brand despite the team underperforming this season. Though his big moves of stealing Al Horford away from the Celtics, acquiring Josh Richardson in a sign-and-trade for Jimmy Butler and signing Tobias Harris to a near-max deal haven't panned out, the organization seems to be high on Brand.\n\nA team source on Wednesday confirmed Brand is under contract beyond this season and said the organization is very happy with his work since being named GM in 2018. The source cited Brand's leadership and strong working relationships with players, agents, and executives around the league.\n\nThat's in line with what managing partner Josh Harris told NBC Sports Philadelphia back in October.\n\n\"When the Bryan Colangelo situation occurred, we went through a really long search to try to figure out who was the right person for the job of general manager,\" Harris said. \"Obviously, [Brand] hadn't been in the front office very long, but all of his strength as a leader and his intelligence and his ability to communicate and his history with the game and with our team and with our city. All those things really were very large in the decision. …\n\n\"… and he's increasingly putting his insignia, his imprint on the team, and it's really great. I mean, today's NBA is a player's league. He was an All-Star player not that long ago. He's a really unique person. So I'm really happy that we're working together.\"\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia 76ers and their rivals in the NBA from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
