        "text": "Cuttino Rashawn Mobley (born September 1, 1975 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American professional Basketball player in the NBA who currently plays for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nCuttino, also known as the \"Cat,\" attended Incarnation of Our Lord grade school in the Olney section of Philadelphia. After graduating from grade school, Mobley attended Cardinal Dougherty High School and Maine Central Institute. After high school, he attended the University of Rhode Island, where he helped lead the Rams to an Elite Eight appearance in the 1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He was selected in the second round (41st overall) of the 1998 NBA Draft by the Houston Rockets. He played with them for six seasons before being shipped to the Orlando Magic along with Steve Francis and Kelvin Cato for Tracy McGrady in the 2004 offseason. After playing 23 games with the Magic, though, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Doug Christie (basketball). Mobley ranked third in the league in three-point percentage during the 2004-2005 season. He signed a five-year US $42 million deal with the Clippers on July 14, 2005. He is known for his three-point shooting, running the Clutch City shootout contest in Houston during his Rockets years. Mobley, along with Sam Cassell and Elton Brand, led the Clippers to the 2006 NBA playoffs.\n\nOn January 28, 2005, Mobley's home was burglarized. Thieves stole $500,000 in cash, jewelry, and other items from Mobley's Bel-Air, California home.\n\nMobley's half-brother, Daniel Smith (football player), was a wide receiver for the National Football League's Carolina Panthers. He is also the cousin of former NFL linebacker John Mobley.\n\n[]"
