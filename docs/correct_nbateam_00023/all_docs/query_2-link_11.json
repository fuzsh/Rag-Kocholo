        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nFree-agent big man Elton Brand has signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers, the team announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe 37-year-old appeared in 17 games last year with the 76ers, which was his second stint with the team after a four-year stay from 2008-2012. In 2015-16, he averaged 4.1 points and 3.7 rebounds in 13.2 minutes per game.\n\nMarc J. Spears of The Undefeated noted that the 17-year veteran has been in the league almost as long as his new teammate, rookie Ben Simmons, has been alive. But many, like Sam Smith of the Chicago Bulls' official website, believed that Brand was going to hang them up at the end of the 2015-16 season.\n\nBrand was the first overall pick of the Bulls out of Duke in the 1999 draft, spending two seasons in the Windy City, where he averaged 20.1 points and at least 10 rebounds per game in that span.\n\nHe was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2001 where he would stay for seven seasons, appearing in a pair of All-Star Games while putting together the most successful spell of his career. In 459 games, he averaged 20.3 points per game and added 10.3 rebounds.\n\nAfter injury problems that saw him appear in just eight games in 2007-08, Brand left the Clippers via free agency to sign with the 76ers, where his play began to decline.\n\nHis points per game decreased by almost seven, and the 76ers used a one-time amnesty under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement to release him, per the Associated Press via NJ.com.\n\nAfter short stints with the Dallas Mavericks and Atlanta Hawks, where he started a combined 37 games in three seasons, Brand made his return to the 76ers.\n\nHe's one of just 10 players in NBA history to record 15,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, 2,000 assists and 1,500 blocks, per the NBA:\n\nWith Philadelphia's logjam of young, talented big men in the frontcourt, Brand will likely play behind the likes of Simmons, Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid and Dario Saric.\n\nHowever, none of those players are over the age of 22, which could make Brand's veteran presence coming off the bench a vital acquisition to help develop and teach the young, budding stars in Philadelphia."
