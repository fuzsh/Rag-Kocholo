        "text": "When Sixers’ general manager Elton Brand met with the media back in August to discuss the direction of the team and the upcoming re-evaluation of the front office, one sentiment he went back to on multiple occasions was that the Sixers needed more “basketball minds”.\n\n“I felt like we need to strengthen our organization from top to bottom,” Brand said on August 25. “That starts with the front office also, so balancing our strengths with analytics and strategy with more basketball minds.”\n\nThe implication was pretty straightforward: in Brand’s eyes, the Sixers relied too heavily on analytics in the past.\n\nTo say that “analytics” leads to a uniform set of beliefs or styles of play would be overly simplistic. After all, there wouldn’t be much of a competitive advantage to be gained if everybody looked at the same data and arrived at the same conclusions, leading them to target the same players and prioritizing the same style of play as everyone else in the league.\n\nEven with that disclaimer out of the way, few would look at the Sixers’ roster and call it one which was arrived at by a strict adherence to the principles of advanced analytics. In a broad sense, analytics have helped push teams to embrace a more uptempo style of play, eschewing the bruising post-up play to focus on 3-point shooting and perimeter skill sets.\n\nNone of that comes close to describing the current Sixers’ roster. It’s not as though the Sixers pushed the analytical revolution to the extreme, and came up short because of their misguided belief in the dark arts of spreadsheets and calculators.\n\nI have been at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference almost every year and I just don’t remember sitting in on a talk decrying the usefulness of having capable ball handlers on the court. I also don’t know of an adjusted plus-minus variant which would have supported giving Tobias Harris $180 million. Somebody is free to correct me if I am wrong on either assertion, though.\n\nWhich isn’t to say that the Sixers didn’t rely on analytics, because they clearly did. Alex Rucker, previously a senior analytics consultant with the Toronto Raptors, eventually rose to executive vice president of basketball operations with the 76ers, the second-highest-ranking executive in the Sixers’ front office. Rucker, clearly, had a lot of input in the Sixers’ direction over these last few years. It is perfectly fair to question his role in the mistakes that were made.\n\nThe Sixers hired Peter Dinwiddie from the Indiana Pacers to be their new executive vice president of basketball operations, the exact title Rucker previously held. Rucker will be re-assigned within the organization, and the expectation is that his influence in decision making will be decreased substantially.\n\nEven if you took the most pessimistic interpretation possible of Rucker’s tenure with the 76ers, and say that he was the driving force behind every mistake that the 76ers have made over the last few years (which, of course, would likely be overly simplistic, unfair, and absolve Brand of all responsibility as the final arbiter of the team’s direction), that would still not be a repudiation of analytics as a concept or in their utility in the NBA; it would be a statement on the Sixers’ failures to interpret and analyze the data successfully.\n\nAny time a mistake is made by an organization that invests heavily in analytics, the narrative becomes that the mistakes are proof that analytics as a concept is flawed. It’s a phenomenon almost completely unique to the discussion of advanced statistics. If a team fails to find talent in the draft, a new scouting director is hired to make better decisions. Nobody suggests that watching games as a concept is flawed. But if a general manager who embraces analytics makes a bad move, we’re seemingly always drawn back into the ridiculous debate over the value analytics have in professional sports.\n\nScouting a game in person provides a front office with information. Advanced analytics provides a front office with information. Both need to be applied correctly to be of any use. Both, if used incorrectly, can lead to mistakes.\n\nOutside of Rucker’s demotion, two other key changes have occurred within the Sixers’ front office. Phil Jabour, who previously served as the Sixers’ director of scouting, was hired by the Kings to be their vice president of player personnel. That is a clear promotion for Jabour, who had previously worked with new Sacramento GM Monte McNair when the two were with the Houston Rockets. The Sixers also lost Sergi Oliva, their vice president of strategy, who took a position on the Utah Jazz coaching staff.\n\nAfter beginning the offseason by saying that they needed more basketball minds, the hiring of Dinwiddie as Brand’s second in command is an interesting choice. Dinwiddie’s background is in sales, with the collective bargaining agreement and negotiating contracts among his most oft-cited strengths since his career shifted to the basketball operations side of the Pacers’ organization.\n\nThe word on Dinwiddie is that he’s a positive addition to the front office, and I’m certainly not of the belief that in order to be a “basketball mind” you have to have been blessed with the genetic gifts necessary to play ball at an NBA level. Dinwiddie’s non-traditional basketball background in no way suggests that he’s a bad hire or not qualified for the job. But it is an interesting contrast with Brand’s previously stated intentions.\n\nPerhaps Brand’s objections to his front office staff at the time were less about a true, legitimate lack of basketball minds, but one more born out of Brand not having been given the opportunity to build out his own staff when he was hired back in 2018. Brand, now that he’s truly empowered, should certainly be afforded the opportunity to make his own staffing decisions. But, again, it’s just at odds with what he previously said when this process began.\n\nHaving lost Oliva, and demoted Rucker, without any additions of note to the analytics department, does raise a couple of cautionary flags.\n\nThe first concern is that it could suggest that the use of analytics, both in gameday strategy and in evaluating player personnel moves, will be diminished going forward. Whether you’re talking about stylistic changes to the game, coaching strategies, or player acquisition, analytics have become an integral part in all facets of NBA basketball.\n\nThe team that took the fewest 3s in 2019-20 still attempted more than any team did just a decade prior, and the slowest paced team of today plays at roughly the speed of Mike D’Antoni’s “Seven Seconds or Less” Suns. Some of the league’s best coaching staffs, like the Heat and Celtics, are devoted to the use of analytics, and many of the best teams of the last decade have been built with front offices at the forefront of the analytics revolution.\n\nThe second concern which is lingering in the back of my mind is that, with the departure of Oliva and the firing of former head coach Brett Brown, that Brand and company might have convinced themselves that the roster is fine, laying most of the blame on it not being utilized correctly rather than having the conviction to truly admit the mistakes that were made. The roster is not fine, and if the evaluation of the front office leads them to believe that small changes to the roster and a new strategic approach are enough to correct the mistakes of the last few years, then it’s tough to see a path towards true title contention.\n\nThere’s still plenty of time to see how the rest of the offseason plays out, of course, which is why these are only cautionary flags. There could still be changes coming to the Sixers’ front office, still additions to be made to the coaching staff, and the draft, free agency and trades to remake the roster.\n\nBut the Sixers’ problems, both in the front office and on the court, would not be fixed by having less information at their disposal. Analytics are not the bogeyman to explain away all of their problems. The answer for the Sixers should not be to minimize the role of analytics in decision making. The answer is to do a better job of using analytics to make informed decisions.\n\n(Photo: Jeff Haynes / NBAE via Getty Images)"
