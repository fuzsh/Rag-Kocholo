        "text": "CITY OF NEWBURGH He played college basketball at Duke, is a former first round NBA draft pick and his list of potential references include big-time coaches – from John Calipari, to Doc Rivers, to Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nMeet the latest candidate for the open Newburgh Free Academy boys' basketball coaching job.\n\nRoshown McLeod, who played with Elton Brand and Shane Battier at Duke (1996-98) before being selected 20th overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the '98 NBA Draft, has applied for the position.\n\nNow, for the obvious question: Why?\n\n“I've heard a lot about what's happened at NFA and I think I can help,” said McLeod, 35, told the Times Herald-Record. “Maybe people did things with the right intentions, but it didn't work out. The kids, the community, everyone deserves better. I want to build up this program the right way It should be something the whole community is proud of.”\n\nNewburgh school board President Dawn Fucheck did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment about McLeod's candidacy. The Record reported in Tuesday's editions that three internal candidates have applied for the NFA job – former coach Luke Pereira, jayvee coach Matt Brown and jayvee coach Dennis Maher.\n\nMcLeod last coached at national power St. Benedict's Prep School in Newark, N.J. He said he stepped down in April after one season because “administrators didn't have the same vision for the program”. McLeod, who lives in East Orange, N.J., has coached as an assistant at Indiana and Fairfield University.\n\nHe played forward in the NBA for Atlanta, Philadelphia and Boston from 1998-2002, averaging 7.2 points and 2.7 rebounds in 113 NBA games. McLeod's career was cut short by a knee injury.\n\nHe said he learned of the NFA job from “a friend” in Newburgh. McLeod graduated from Duke with a degree in psychology, but isn't certified to teach. McLeod is willing to go back to school to become a guidance counselor or teacher and would potentially stay at NFA “for a long time”.\n\nHe could certainly get by for now with just the NFA coaching stipend, worth about $5,000 per season. McLeod, married with two children, signed a four-year guaranteed contract worth $4.7 million when he was drafted. He owns several real estate properties.\n\n“I would take (the coaching job) for free,” said McLeod, who is already picking up support from the Newburgh community.\n\nFor all of his accomplishments on the court, McLeod thinks his upbringing makes him a perfect fit at NFA. He was raised by a single mother in the tough streets of Jersey City, N.J., going on to play for legendary coach Bobby Hurley Sr. at St. Anthony High School. Hurley, one of just three scholastic coaches inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, has won 24 state championships and four national titles in almost 40 years. Everyone of Hurley's players have graduated and only two have failed to go to college.\n\nMcLeod, 35, spoke humbly about his background, potential superstar references and famous basketball friends. If he gets the NFA job, McLeod said he would have high-profile players come to Newburgh to work clinics with the community and team. He speaks regularly with, among others, Brand, who plays for Philadelphia, former Knick John Wallace and Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving.\n\n“I think it's important for (the NFA) players and young kids to learn from guys like that,” McLeod said. “You want to play in college, you have to get the grades. You have to work hard. You take ownership for what you do on and off the court. They can learn a lot from those guys. I'm someone who wants to bring my experience to help these kids and be a big part of the community.”"
