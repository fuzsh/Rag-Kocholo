        "text": "ATLANTA — Two NBA jerseys hang in my closet, No. 44 for “Pistol” Pete Maravich and No. 21 for Dominique “The Human Highlight Film” Wilkins. They’re the only ones I’ve bought, reminders of Hall of Famers who entertained while they reinvented basketball with their originality.\n\nBoth started professional careers in Atlanta, and I followed the Hawks with fascination because of them. I even covered the team for parts of three seasons earlier in my career, when Wilkins was the superstar and current Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers and former Slam Dunk champion Spud Webb were his running mates at guard.\n\nThe Hawks were the Deep South’s only professional basketball team before the NBA awarded Charlotte, N.C., an expansion team in 1987. Memphis convinced the Grizzlies to move to Tennessee from Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2001. They were our team.\n\nThe Hawks occasionally played exhibition games in Nashville and drew fans from Middle Tennessee for games on road trips to Atlanta when they were all the rage on Ted Turner’s SuperStation WTBS. They seemed to belong to us..\n\nThis year, the Hawks jumped off the Sports page and onto the front page twice, vilified for racially insensitive comments from controlling owner Bruce Levenson and celebrated for a miraculous turnaround this season. They lost an entire fan base, the entire town, with a stunning betrayal before winning some of them back. They have gone from insult and inspiration, having won 14 of their last 15 games with victories over the NBA’s best teams and brightest stars.\n\nThe bizarre off season and sensational start grabbed my attention like nothing else in sports this year. The Clippers’ fiasco with owner Donald Sterling last basketball season was incredible enough, but the controversy in Atlanta hit closer to home.\n\nThe hometown of Martin Luther King Jr. was dumfounded when e-mails surfaced in the off season from Levenson, indicating the Hawks thought white fans were more important than black ones. Levenson’s e-mails also revealed a racially charged remark from General Manager Danny Ferry about a possible free-agent signee.\n\nThe comments hurt deeply in a Deep South city once burned to the ground in Sherman’s march to the sea and where racial issues simmer continuously.\n\nBecause of the distrust and sagging attendance, I thought the Hawks would be “Gone with the Wind,” relocated to places clamoring for pro basketball like Seattle, San Diego or Las Vegas. Levenson did the franchise a favor by immediately deciding to sell his share, though the sale has been arduous. Ferry took a leave of absence. At least their decisions allowed a healing process to begin.\n\nNo one thought it would happen overnight. That is, until what one former Atlanta columnist called one of the greatest miracles in the city’s long sports history. The Hawks have started this season 21-7, with second-best record in the NBA’s Eastern Conference.\n\nPhilips Arena was sold out Tuesday night for a game with the Clippers and likely will be tonight when the Milwaukee Bucks come to town. The new wave of enthusiasm came, unbelievably, after the once-beleaguered Hawks knocked off the Chicago Bulls with Derek Rose, the Cleveland Cavaliers with LeBron James, the Houston Rockets with Dwight Howard and the Dallas Mavericks with Dirk Nowitzki in four straight games. They rallied to stop the Clippers with Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, 107-104, Tuesday night.\n\nThe Hawks trounced James, the NBA’s best player, 127-98, in Cleveland. No one wins on the road by more than 29 points, especially against LeBron James. That’s hard to imagine. Improbable. Unpredictable. But it happened.\n\n“After what happened in the off season, this has got to be one of the miracles in the history of Atlanta sports,” former Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Terence Moore said. “It ranks right up there with Sid Bream’s slide into home plate for the Braves and the Falcons-Vikings NFC championship game.”\n\nMoore was referring to Bream’s mad dash for home in the 1992 National League Championship Series and the 1999 NFC championship game. Bream scored from second base on a close play at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates, sending the Braves to World Series, where they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games. The Falcons defeated the Vikings, 30-27, in overtime to advance to Super Bowl XXXIII, where they lost to the Denver Broncos, for the only time in franchise history.\n\n“It’s been miraculous up to this point,” Moore said. “And I stress up to this point. “\n\nThe Hawks’ victories have not been a fluke, and they’ve helped fans focus on the court instead of off it.\n\n“This was unexpected,” said Fox Sports analyst Mike Glenn, who played with Wilkins as a sharp-shooting guard in the 1980s. “We were hoping the Hawks would be a little above .500 because they were playing well at times last season.\n\n“We were expecting good, but not this good,” he added. “They have been successful because of teamwork. They move the ball around so well, passing, looking for the open short. You hardly see any one player dribble three times.”\n\nHawks coach Mike Budenholzer has been doubling as the Hawks director of basketball operations in Ferry’s absence. The former San Antonio Spurs assistant coach has been making the good choices, with a starting lineup that lacks anyone approaching the star quality of Maravich or Wilkins from bygone days, or big names like Rose and James from today’s NBA.\n\nUnheralded fifth-year guard Jeff Teague from Wake Forest and journeyman forward Paul Millsap of Louisiana Tech lead Hawks scorers, averaging 16 points per game. It’s hard to figure out, on paper, how they’re doing it.\n\n“We have a good team,” Budenholzer said, “but there’s much work to be done.”\n\nElton Brand, a 15-year veteran who was the No. 1 overall pick of the Chicago Bulls in the 1999 NBA draft, joined the Hawks last season. He’s seen his share of good and bad teams throughout his career, having suffered with the Clippers when they were one of the NBA’s worst teams (2001-2008).\n\n“This team is hot to prove itself,” Brand said. “I’ve never played for a team that’s been unselfish on both offense and defensively.\n\n“When they’ve got an open shot, they keep looking for a better open shot,” he laughed.\n\nThe Hawks’ starting lineup includes Teague, Millsap, center Al Horford, forward DeMarre Carroll and forward Kyle Korver. Carroll, who was reminded by Hawks vice president of public relations Garin Narain to take his hat off during interviews to comply with the NBA dress code, said the team has been on a mission this season.\n\n“Hey, I see LeBron with his hat on during interviews all of the time,” Carroll said to Garin.\n\nGarin reminded Carroll he was saving him potential fine money. And, of course, Carroll is no LeBron James.\n\n“We’re a good team,” Carroll said. “No, I think we’re a great team. Hardly anyone outside of this locker room believes that.”\n\nIt is hard to believe. But they’ve already done something few players have in their careers. They’ve captured the imagination of a city that seemed destined to turn its back on the Hawks.\n\n“We want to deliver for the fans,” Carroll said. “We’re playing great basketball team right now. Merry Christmas, but it does not stop here.”\n\nLevenson’s comments about fans were contained in e-mails he wrote about bridging Atlanta’s sports divide. He was hoping to increase fan attendance for the Hawks, who rank 25th this season among the league’s 30 teams.\n\n“In trying to address those issues, I wrote an e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive,” he said in a statement earlier this year. “I trivialized our fans by making clichéd assumptions about their interests (i.e. hip hop vs. country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another (i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our black fans). By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans.”\n\n“If you’re angry about what I wrote, you should be,” Levenson continued. “I’m angry at myself, too. It was inflammatory nonsense. We all may have subtle biases and preconceptions when it comes to race, but my role as a leader is to challenge them, not to validate or accommodate those who might hold them.”\n\nIf the Hawks keep playing beyond expectations, they’ll have a legitimate chance at making the NBA Finals. The Eastern Conference is weaker than in recent memory. Only five teams having winning records.\n\n“Things are much better, and this winning has taken the focus off the negative,” Glenn said. “Everything is better, from the entertainment at games to the talent on the floor. I have felt the difference.”\n\n◆◆◆\n\nJames Bennett is editor of The Daily Herald. Contact him at jbennett@c-dh.net"
