        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers forward has been playing in the National Basketball Association since 1999. That's when the Chicago Bulls made him the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. Brand justified that pick when he was named NBA Co-Rookie of the Year, along with Steve Francis.\n\nBrand started his road to fame by being the state tournament MVP for the Red Devils during the 1994-95 and '95-96 seasons, his sophomore and junior years, when the Red Devils won their first two state championships, the former in Class C and latter in Class B, in school history. They were also the first team in state history to win back-to-backstate titles after moving up a class.\n\nIndividually, in his junior year, Brand was named a Con Ed Scholar Athlete award winner, a rarity for someone who was a junior, and as a senior, he earned the Mr. New York Basketball award.\n\nBefore going onto the NBA, Brand played at Duke University, where he was named the John R. Wooden National Player of the Year in '98-99, leading the Blue Devils to the National Title Game."
