        "text": "PEEKSKILL – Byproducts of more than a decade of Daisy Brand’s hard work buzzed throughout the loud, crammed gym at Peekskill High School on Saturday.\n\nHundreds of adults lined the bleachers and circled the court. Dozens of campers worked through drills at stations run by former basketball stars, some of who leaned on an academic push she helped create just to graduate. And then there was her family — her son, Elton, tall and proud, and his siblings, cousins and more, all determined to continue everything Daisy started 10 years ago.\n\n“It makes it difficult not having her here in the flesh. This was her thing,” the 15-year NBA veteran said during Peekskill’s annual Elton Brand Youth Day, the first since Daisy passed away last month. “She worked tirelessly all year to make sure this day went well. Everybody picked it up, my brother, Artie, my cousin, Joyce, and her family. They did a great job filling those shoes because mom was the best, and this was her day.”\n\nAnd Peekskill was her city. Daisy Brand settled here after growing up in Tarrytown, but raising the man most synonymous with Peekskill was just one of her contributions to the community.\n\nBefore passing away at 64 from stomach cancer, she served for 10 years as the chairman of the board at C.A.M.P., INC., a non-profit organization founded in 2004 and dedicated to the betterment of the city’s youth. Brand’s Youth Day was central to that, bringing Elton home to be seen by scores of children, all of whom went home with a gift bag, a T-shirt, a pair of Nike sneakers and often a picture or an autograph.\n\n“It was her way to make sure Elton gave back to the kids and that the kids were able to see him,” said Brand’s brother, Artie McGriff. “She didn’t want him to be somebody that no one could reach, no one could get to.”\n\nWith her son away in one arena or another, Daisy Brand operated C.A.M.P., INC., directing its resources to much more than a once-a-calendar basketball clinic. The organization, located in downtown Peekskill, combined state funding and six-figure contributions from Brand to foster the talents of children — one arm being Peekskill High School’s Elton Brand Academy.\n\n“The Elton Brand Academy is actually how I made it through high school — after-school tutoring, extra help, one-on-ones,” said former Peekskill star Daquan Brickhouse, who now plays at Coppin State. “It’s a lot of things that help me and other kids here focus on their schoolwork and stay off the streets.\n\n“Miss Daisy, she was like a second mother to kids who didn’t have a mom. She always was doing what was best for any kid, no matter who you were or where you were from. If she could help, she’d help to her full potential. She’s truly missed, and I hope everything she’s done keeps going. It’s a great look for the city of Peekskill.”\n\nBrand’s cousin, Joyce Armstrong, has worked to sustain her aunt’s vision. First, she stepped in to organize the Youth Day, and then spent Saturday in Daisy’s shoes, putting out fires before they started and being the conduit between Brand and his campers.\n\n“As long as I’m alive, her legacy is going to live on,” Armstrong said.\n\nFamily members like Armstrong now hope Brand will return home for more than a weekend.\n\nAfter playing last season off the bench for the Hawks, Brand became a free agent. Although he intends to continue playing, the 35-year-old forward has yet to sign.\n\nBrand said Knicks president Phil Jackson emailed him 20 seconds after midnight on July 1 (the opening of NBA free agency) to express his interest.\n\n“I think he’s going to come on home. Hint, hint, hint,” Armstrong said. “We’re hoping. We want him to come to the New York Knicks. It was his mom’s dream for him to finish his career in New York.”\n\nThe former No. 1 overall pick out of Duke realizes the endpoint of his NBA career is near. His brother, Artie, believes playing here would be difficult with so many demands on Brand’s time.\n\nBrand admitted he was intrigued by the interest from Jackson and the Knicks, but he remained non-committal about his future.\n\n“We talked about it before she passed, obviously,” Brand said. “I want to be on a real good team. I think the Knicks are headed towards that. I could see that soon. That may be possible.”\n\nRegardless of his future, Brand’s involvement in Peekskill will continue. He once made the mistake of mentioning to his Peekskill coach, Lou Panzanaro, that Elton Brand Youth Day had run its course. Brand suggested Panzanaro discuss the possibility with Daisy.\n\n“I said, ‘No, you talk to your mom. We’re never ending this,’ ” Panzanaro said. “When I said to him just before the funeral, did he want to keep it going, he said, ‘Definitely.’ I think he’s more determined than ever to continue this for her and her memory.”\n\nAnd, of course, for her city, too.\n\nTwitter: @lohudinsider"
