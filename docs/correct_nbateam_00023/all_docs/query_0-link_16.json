        "text": "Elton Brand – Philadelphia 76ers GM After finishing his playing career in Philadelphia, Brand became a player development consultant and went onto become GM of the Sixer’s G-League team. In 2018 he was promoted to general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, but after a tumultuous two years he was demoted from lead decision making duties due to the arrival of the newly appointed President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey. Jake Fischer reported in July 2023 that Brand is expected to draw consideration from teams looking for a new front office.\n\n76ers re-sign Jeff Dowtin to a two-way contract\n\nShams Charania: The Philadelphia 76ers are signing guard Jeff Dowtin Jr. on a two-way NBA contract, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. Dowtin averaged 17.1 points and 5.7 assists across NBA Summer League for 76ers this season after playing 12 games for Philadelphia in 2023-24."
