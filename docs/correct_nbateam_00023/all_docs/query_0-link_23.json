        "text": "This past week saw a flurry of moves made by NBA general managers in light of the trade deadline on Thursday. One of those general managers was Elton Brand of the Philadelphia 76ers who made moves to acquire Tobias Harris and Boban Marjanovic, all while trading former first overall pick Markelle Fultz. After the plethora of moves, Brand has made it clear that all of that \"Trust the process\" stuff was for real as now the team is a contender to win a title.\n\n\"We believe we are in position to contend now,\" Brand said according to ESPN, \"and our moves reflect that belief.\"\n\nBrand also spoke about how his star players Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid may be young, but have played in a way that makes the team not only better but one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference.\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\n\"[Simmons and Embiid] rapidly improved over the last season, so the window is now,\" Brand said. \"The opportunity is now. So, once I saw that, we discussed taking a shot at it now, because who knows how long that window is going to be open?\"\n\nWith the 76ers of the belief that their time is now, it will be interesting to see how the rest of their season plays out and how far they can get in the playoffs."
