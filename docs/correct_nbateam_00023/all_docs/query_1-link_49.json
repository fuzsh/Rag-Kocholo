In his former position as a star athlete, he found a way to give back, and even today as the General Manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, Elton Brand continues to donate his own money to make sure we get our school work done by sponsoring the Elton Brand Academy in the PHS Library. The Elton Brand Academy offers free tutoring (complete with snacks) after school each day. Our free tutoring runs from 3-4:30 p.m. There are a lot of great teachers there to help by tutoring you in the subject you need help in and, should I mention again that it’s free?\n\nAll you have to do is get a blue permission slip from the main office, hand it in with a parent/guardian signature, and boom – you’re in. Once you enter you just sign in, choose a snack and drink, and get working!"
